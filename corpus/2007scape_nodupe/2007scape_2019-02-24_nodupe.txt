I can't tell if this is bait. Osbuddy used to be a bot client the developer was employed by jagex because of his knowledge about botting. Runelite has a vast majority of users, and was previously fully open source which allowed people to see there was no spyware. I believe it's still mostly open source aside from the deobfiscator or however its spelled. Runelite has way more features for free and is the superior client

Krystilia would be better money but it depends whether or not you want to go into the wildy. I did, and it taught me a lot about the game and was more interesting but it was occasionally annoying and you can’t use as good gear.

Try putting your username in as a new one and see if it resets itself. Only thing I can really think of to keep the same rsn.

The original recolour idea required the player to the heads to the crossbow. So you wouldn't be able to recolour the crossbow without being able to kill Vorkath or KBD anyway. But now we're playing with the idea of adding ornament kits as treasure trail rewards. This is just sort of a middle ground for the two ideas. People can make money from the scrolls, and there's also a use for the extra boss heads people have sitting in their bank.

It would be a significant hit I believe. Definitely not something you want to do unless it's client side. But daxi says your password is stored plaintext in the client while logged in. Dunno if true but there's that.

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All I was doing you was informing you that your joke was shitty, as not even the guy you were telling the joke to understood it, and you just ended up freaking him out instead. trying thinking before making a shitty joke. theres are kids on here and theres no reason to make some stupid fucked up joke like that that most people wont even understand.
---
I personally didnt takeoffense, but i said something because the guy you said the joke to literally responded with wtf! obviously implying your joke missed the mark, because it came completely out of left field. theres was no context at all behind it.
---
When did I say that?

What gang did you join?
---
&gt;playing with thumbs
---
Idk how you guys do it . I cant see shit and misclick. I hold the phone with thumb and in between index and middle and use my index fingers. Way better 
---
I just want to let you know that you typed that entire novel out for no reason. I didn’t bother reading it. Imagine the XP you could have gained in that time! Bummer..
---
Are you serious?
---
1 defence level equals 0.25 of a combat level, not accounting hp levels you would eventually gain, which I didn't even account for the benefit of the doubt. you'll most likely have to have protect item to use a new meta breaking item, so you can add 3 combat levels for 24 prayer gained at 0.125 per prayer level, but at that point you may as well get 31 or 43 or more, so add 1-3 combat levels on top of that.
---
A armour set or item that adds 1-2 max hits on top of the feasible alternatives for 10 combat levels and no noticeable gain in any other aspect like the defence itself (because you are going to be shredded apart at 30 defence just like 1 defence), is not going to compete with barrow gloves at 2.5 combat higher, fighter torso, berserker helm, or void.

that's easy, just find out where mum left her credit card

I dropped every duplicate scroll to an alt for approx 4 years worth of membership in bonds.

This is actually a re-purposed design I made a while back for a quest idea suggested by /u/below_job. Unfortunately it never gained much traction, hence reusing it here.

---
Wait a minute. You can do that?! What a fucking time to be alive, I had NO idea

Yeah nice thing about being ironman is that your membership is completely covered by all the useless drops you eventually get.

then why did  you try to act like me typing out anything stops me from getting xp you pansy.

Okay, but if you look at the yearly price change, they peaked with the release of mobile and are now trending toward pre-mobile prices.

---
What are you talking about dude? I got 72 mining before I got mem. I agree that f2p bots are a problem but it’s not impossible. You just aren’t trying hard enough 
---
doesn't matter at all. obby legs cost like 1m and are store bought with no other requirements than 60 defence. they feature +1 strength bonus, provide a set effect and have actual defence bonuses.
---
this would literally be +1 strength bonus and barely any defence. and in addition, due to demand by pures AND zerkers, it would cost far more than obby legs ever will.
---
if you want to risk this, if it were added, go ahead. but it wouldn't be cheap for you.
---
and all in all, it wouldn't break any metas - this coming from a guy who has all sorts of pking builds (1 def 20 def 45 def 60 def 70 def). in all honesty you could add +15 strength bonus to pures (and thus zerks) and you wouldn't even come close to the effect rigour has left pvp since its addition.
---
Something something engine work something farming code is a mess
---
New user. Only post is this one. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
My damn eyes hurt cause it's so bright..

I agree but disagree.  I don't think just graceful recolours will do, maybe ornament kits though to make it look completely different.  Idk
---
You can't get 40+ barrages without risking a lot of gear and you can't refreeze every hit. Just saying. 
---
Take your own advice and don't call me matey.
---
Why do you care if you can personally mute it? Toxic gamers are nothing at all new, and have been around since the beginning. Just ignore their outbursts or filter it out. Ain't like they can cause any actual harm, they are just words. 
---
One benefit of osrs is being able to tell what something is at a glance. The last one looks like it could be a black trim instead of rune.

the players at the highest level of skill in Counter-Strike: global offensive compete twice a year in a major championship with a prize pool of $1,000,000 USD. 
---
The organization hosting this major is ESL who has hired a cheeky production crew that is gaining notoriety for adding funny and informative blurbs (?) on the livestream. This one in particular references French player RpK who plays for team Vitality. (although his nickname is Tank so maybe 99 defence would have been a better choice..)

Do you have a slayer helmet?

But every post has this type of comment upvoted to the top?

It's not exclusive to pvp or pvm, they're just toxic people.
---
Most people actually just play the game and do some of both. What content you play doesn't make you an asshole, thats just how they are.

All this does is cause a separation from people who don't really care and are being targeted for thr content they like(whether it's a pvmer or a paper)

What's the best way to kill myself in the chaos altar? I'm using locator orb from ds2 which is fairly fast, but I can't keep multiple in case I lose it (d bone protect over it)
---
I tried using strange device from master clues, but it doesn't work without the clue in inventory. Rock cake is also very slow.
---
I thought locator orb would be the best, but I saw someone killing himself for 12s and didn't even need to finish off with the wine of zamorak. What was he using?
---
The original meme the first bubble says "Orange man bad?" and the second is like "Yes, orange man bad."
---
Lol for real. I had no idea he was referencing a movie! Totally threw me off 🤣
---
I haven't been able to find a way, just look it up
---
I also think ornament kits would be better, just recolours wouldn't take as much effort to implement, and I guess I was hoping for more mix'n'match too. That was my thought process.
---
So?
---
Because toxic gamers should be culled by reports so the environment is a welcoming one. This game is only harmed if people can just go around being toxic bullies. Youre aware we live in a society and while you can censor your surrounding people are generally expected to behave a certain way, right? Do you understand the word integrity? It applies to all aspects of a game. We ban botting, macroes hacking and hate speech alike because they are all detrimental to the health of tye game.
---
If you want to be dense and boil everything down to "lol why does it even matter its just ____ bro" thats cool, but you contribute nothing by dismissing bad behavior because it doesnt cause any "harm" which is entirely subjective of you.
---
nope they haven't, rs2/3 did and continue to do loads so i guess they are trying to get people who know about rs3's dxp but don't know osrs won't have them

I made an Ironman a couple days ago, and did the same thing as you. I was following oziris' guide, and I ended up dying trying to pick up the snape grass near the crafting guide because I forgot about the hobgoblins and was out of run energy so I couldn't run away, lost hardcore status... I ended up getting 35 wc before I decided that I was going to absolutely hate trying to play an ironman, so now I'm waiting out the week to get rid of iron status before making it a slayer alt instead.
---
Yea kinda 
---
in hindsight, this attempt at a meme was simply not funny and lacked the punch to be a front page contender, alas; my karma hasn't raised.

It’s not unless you’re stupid like me and you 
---
First use a slayer helm (I) over Void. Secondly for metal dragons use mage. Even a slayer staff (e) melts them and is cheap to use, but a trident is preferred if you can afford it.
---
Stop using broad bolts. Use Ruby bolts. They will melt.
---
My hc died at wintertodt lol I'd say he made it pretty far

I just top up the favor/collect resources/add coins once a week at the same time I do tears of Guthix.

I always think this too, but then I remember there are some good pkers out there

Lol.

Is it really this simple to get a barrows item? I kill all 6 dudes and 3 skeletons then open the chest. I'm at 48 chest count now and I've never gotten a drop so I'm pretty keen to say I haven't been doing something right

---
I solo pk at deep wildy altar often, the dudes doing bones always say "toxic" stuff while the pkers only say gf, bye, or things like that 
---
He says it as they die tho?
---
I had trained farming up to high 50s or so through quests and Tears of Guthix just because I never knew how to get into farming runs and absolutely hated the skill. (Don't fear for my RC exp, I'm one of those sickos that trains it normally and there's a dozen skills ahead of it in the ToG queue anyways)
---
then a dude in a discord told me to just ignore everything other than fruit trees (and maybe normal trees) and do one run of those each day I log in and bam swimming in levels
---
oh i see

If you died you didnt have much to lose. Also it's not a glitch. You were in an instance

experience helps a lot!

I agree. It sucks because every time I log in it’s close chat box, open up inventory. If it could just remember what stones you had open/closed from the previous session it would be a world better.

Don't 'Lol.' at us you grub we demand mole slippers

Be careful when fighting bosses.

---
Yeah my brother was watching a stream of an NFL game and the whole chat is just racial slurs.
---
He had to close the chat because it was just a wall of n-words
---
Unlikely possible with the way our objects are created ): The reason why we're generally against having too many of 1 type of item (max cape, slayer helm, blow pipe etc) is because each new variant needs its own config which is especially annoying when you lack parent/child coding capabilities :/
---
Pretty easy tbh 
---
The shitty thing is that it doesn't even make farming herbs more profitable. It just makes her runs longer
---
just spam click the wine 
---
cool, thanks. went pretty much as i expected, the change to bellows automation is infuriatingly slow so you just have to do it manually anyway lmao
---
Don't listen to people telling you to no life and go for a certain item or train a certain skill to xx level before anything.
---
Enjoy the game for what it is. Don't let the efficiency scapers ruin your enjoyment of the game because exploring, learning and enjoying doing things takes longer than purely doing some grind.
---
Look around and enjoy the game. You can always get more membership  in the future. Your stats are quite low, and a lot of P2P content will absolutely smash you. However there is still an absolute abundance of lower leveled things to do.

Sorry if it gets asked a lot, but why do there seem to be so many bots? I can follow them around for around 30 mins and it's so blatant it's not even funny. Whenever they are reported, it seems that the bots know how to react as to make it seem like they are true humans. 
---
Is this just something I have to deal with? I guess I might just have to buy member because I've heard bots don't run as rampant on member worlds.
---
YES YES YES!!!

I suppose so :P

Ow thats why, nice call of him ;-) PSYCHIC!

Potatoes don't yield much gp. And even if they are worth something it would crash the price which would benefit p2p and still screwing f2p.

Need to unlock it at arceus library

Id skip but if you must do them use mage. Cheap option is slayer dart or fire bolt with chaos gauntlets

Not to sound rude mate but do you think someone with a maxxed obby would intentionally change their attack style to completely ruin an account that has years of progress on it?

In the United States this would easily fall under the category of harassment and in any plave of business you would be fired or immediately ejected. In every facet of our society we strive to preserve public order, whether you agree with it or not we try to do the same thing in cyberspace, anonymity is the only thing that allows this behavior to really exist in the first place, we counteract that by reporting.

Are you going to thieve the men at the start, suiciding to them so you heal back up for starting cash? no because you're playing a hardcore even if you say you're not going to play it differently at all. 
---
i’m not sure what else then!
---
why wouldn’t you want to level att and def? not really into the game enough to know little stuff like that
---
Pathetic af lmao, glad you got told
---
Damn, that’s a queen size bed
---
wow I can actually see them implementing this into the game.  It looks simple yet unique and aesthetic.  great work.
---
I dont make that much money but I do make more than enough that $12 a month isn't really a big deal for me
---
I was never a member back in the day, so I’m surprised to see that arma cbow was such a late introduction in the main game
---
Usually watch/listen to educational stuff, like lectures, so I don't feel like i'm just procrastinating. 
---
Yeah but if you get higher than 2, it's basically pointless to do WT
---
Im 230 still waiting for that dex, gl
---
Guys no i really want to fuck that snake
---
You’re not being the person mr. Rogers knew you can be. 
---
60 att, 65 str, 50 def, how should I train my combat stats 
---
Don’t forget to flip it frequently for even cooking.
---
&gt; It's kinda like Call of Duty, but instead of there being a new Call of Duty game every year we get 3 competing BR's.
---
So nothing like CoD, really, since we have actual competition in the space. Call of Duty games never competed with one another. It was just the norm to play the most recent one and the old one was put on life support with 0 updates after the next one came out.
---
Competition is good and will drive everybody to make a better game. As soon as Apex entered the space, Epic fixed all the broken garbage everybody wanted to be fixed for 2 months and is giving away next season's battlepass for free to people who complete some relatively easy challenges before season 8.
---
I hate pvp mainly because i suck at it, the game would eventualy die without it tho, lets just endure it bros
---
Yes there are a few different ways to level slayer without using combat. Unfortunately I'm not knowledgeable enough on the subject to go into details.
---
oh and that's for both the picking the house and travel feature?
---
love it 
---
Guess that debate is closed then, wonder if he got many runs in while using it
---
I don't mind the wilderness risk tbh, I did a lot of zammy wines when f2p for money so I got used to dodging pkers lol. I was mainly wondering about money and efficiency differences yeah. 
---
With royal trouble done I bring it up to ~1.5m, which is enough for the next week + a few days buffer. I don't keep it at max because I'd rather use that 6m for merching or buying a useful item.
---
I wish I was that smart, mate.
---
This is sick, but I don’t think it should be a TT reward.
---
Instead, they need to get rid of all of the rewards that are like “Dragon kiteshield ornament kit, dragon plateskirt ornament kit” etc., etc. and just make it ONE item that is “dragon ornament kit”.
---
Thanks. Failed again. 
---
Tried range with RCB and also a mage run to see which I did best with. Mage was great on supplies but I got further on range
---
Your fucked
---
Yeah, sometimes someone in your group does something stupid and you have to deal with it.
---
It's called life.

You could of had an emblem

You probably reported it using the wrong category

My attack option changed from aggression with the rune scimitar to accurate with my rune 2h whenver I go to try and ko a person and the rune scimitar becomes set to accurate as well.  My attack exp was 37,279 and now its 41314. I didn't even know it was training attack until I leveled. 
---
I'm happy for him but inside I'm dying , 105 solo raids dry now 🙃
---
100% drop rate! That's OP nerf it Jagex.
---
Also grats man that's awesome luck lol 
---
Not that it will make you feel much better but C Engineer is 130+ dry on his hcim right now. Drop rate luck is a fickle mistress. 
---
This is how it is with all p2p items in f2p though
---
Does that protect over d bones or is it like the locator orb where you need a new one if you get pked?
---
Definitely the luckiest I’ve ever been in this game. Quite a rush :))
---
What was the purpose of all the censoring?
---
What is this scam? 
---
You should do it! We will be following your progress. 
---
they were at 1400 last april. this seems within reason on the year tbh.
---
Anonymous community they do sdmm clan pking lots of raids 1 and a good chunk of raids 2 after you get experienced at raids 1 I believe the website is rs-ac .com or its reversed
---
I'd rather not see this game turn into a hugbox like a Blizzard/Ubisoft game

Yes.

You can easily make that money back by Runecrafting Blood/Double Nature/Wrath runes.

Also if you need some help or have other questions, feel free to let me know and I can add you in-game and show you some stuff or answer your questions! Not a pro by any means but I do like sharing my experiences.
---
Thank you!

Don't forget the white noise buildup
---
I had the same problem. I couldn't even get a name like "tabletop" or "tweezers" so I just deleted the app and gave it 0 stars. 
---
The issue I have with farming is when I  start a grind i dont like to stop for anything. I dont like to re gear, so I end up grinding a boss for like 2 months before I do 1 more run lmao
---
It's inefficient to not wear full graceful due to the run Regen buff
---
Sure I can but what about a new player ?
---
Las Vegas = Sand casino 
---
How so? The helms can already be painted. It would only make sense to paint the rest of the amor.  If your concern is the same as others that there would be too much confusion, it’s not a very valid argument seeing as how the helms have been out forever and never even been mentioned before. I think people just like to complain a lot. The armors would be a great addition and a great refresher to that content that is practically dead because we can only do helms and shields. 
---
78 minutes! Holy sandals! that’s a long time for a fight save run. Good job though

P2p is way cooler

Unrealistic shit being in the game doesn't mean we should double down on adding unrealistic shit.
---
Some people ...
---
Easily billions. I dont have the game knowledge to do the calculations myself but to give a better idea he hit 200m runecrafting on his alt doing natures to fund his main. On top of that he was one of the first people to really abuse the karamja elite diary shop which let you sell stuff for above high alch price. He made billions just doing that. Most of the skills arent buyables but since he was doing ehp methods for a lot of it it becomes way more expensive. Cheapest 99 con is like 100m while ehp is a few 100m
---
If someone has a maxed main, they'd at least power level construction for convenience on an alt wouldn't they?
---
Who's forcing you to wear graceful?
---
Which feature?
---
You’re a gentleman and a scholar, cheers mate! 
---
Osrs powercreep is moving really slowly. We are 6 years into the progression of the game.
---
By this time in main game, EoC was already 1 year old. 
---
Simply put, we really don't need 120 skills and never will 
---
Yea
---
I don't have enough time to play the game normally....
---
I mean shit the dude maxed an ultimate Ironman- he god damn well better like the game if he’s putting in 7k hours! 
---
Pay via bonds by pking. I can easily make a few bonds worth in a night. 
---
If I were to pay with irl it wouldn’t matter since I have a career. Obviously we’re at different stages in life so $12 means more to someone than to me, so you have to come up with that justification on your own. Working is usually better gp/hr than playing.  But if you have a stack to merch with or you’re good at pking you can easily make a bond without much time involved. 
---
Fantastical, completely game breaking, and doesn't fit with OSRS lore. Interesting ideas though
---
I think when i ran the numbers a few months ago with oak larders it was around 46 m.  Not sure if i accounted for demon Butler tho. Just boosting for the pool with stamina and spec bar and an alter only cost me around 4-5m like 8 months ago.  It was sooooo worth it. If i had a 100m bank I'd get 82 con.

This is beyond science

It doesn't you can setup your phone on Tether mode as a secondary connection and it works fine its a bit finicky like after you failover, it won't fail back over to your main connection without logging out and logging back in once main connection is back, and making sure its prioritizing using your normal connection over your secondary

If you enter the wilderness, you willingly acknowledge you are entering a PvP area, yet you don't prepare yourself for PvP. You keep admitting this over and over in every reply and still complain that you get killed. You really need to take a step back and look at your logic, bud.
---
P.S.: It wasn't jagex who put the content there, it was all polled. 
---
~17 mil with oak planks.
---
i just hit my record so far this week, 145k xp an hour, mine is going up lmao.
---
I did admit that, but none of that means I want to pvp...
---
I like what rs3 does, let’s you attach it to the cape so it shows hanging down instead of worn
---
He said the GE was closed for the day due to slugs or something.
---
&gt; I'm literally being forced into wilderness for pvm content.
---
Then it's part of the content
---
Just do whatever you did to afford rigour for a few hours and get a non poverty setup?
---
Yeah I agree with that, as much as I don't like there being a new skill, warding is a much better place for it than clues. 
---
That reminds me, might not be a bad idea to stock up on infinity boots/eternal boots in csse warding ends up repopularizing magic 
---
Have you just stolen a picture of Ymir 
---
It's not, the content is kill this boss. The content is in a location flagged for pvp. I can get killed there by other players. The content is still pvm.
---
I tried 20 defence pure and it just is awkward. I was getting rekt by voiders/zerkers left right centre .. I had an advantage over 1 def pures but even then it was negligible.  
---
Meanwhile, the average pvmer in the wild talks the exact same way. I think the exact message I got a few nights ago killing someone at Vetion: 
---
“I don’t have a spade stupid fucking Ni***r”
---
Something about the wilderness just upsets people and makes them toxic af. 
---
You must be really new to runescape or just truly not understand what the wilderness is.
---
Depends on what level he had it setup, I've only tested it at a PC level and it worked fine but again I haven't been able to test it on a actual router lockup or similar kind of failure.
---
I manually setup the tether right at the PC, where I know some people go as far as having Modems and other stuff setup as a backup.
---
you don't need to but my name is Psychocow
---
Yep, no one has said a date though 
---
Ive Played rs since about 2004. I understand exactly what the wilderness is.
---
Rightfully so, 1 def pures are cringey annoying tweens 
---
So much PC Bitching about "muh N Word". Get over yourselves, Its classic trash talk in a competitive environment. And the OP is just salty cuz he sucks at PvP and died. Nice Mage Pray you doofus. 
---
Lol bru your username was my xbox gamertag many moons ago
---
It's like the skill wasn't updated for more than 17 years!
---
he fears no god
---
I don't even PvP, but my 1 def HCIM would love this.
---
I think it should have higher stats than iron like other "pure" pieces like bearhead, so if they made it have stats of steel platelegs(while still requiring 1 defense to equip) it'd be gucchi.
---
Bearhead has stats for Mithril FH so I think kilt having stats equal to steel legs would be balanced.
---
You can get it from The Collector in Varrock museum.
---
In the future if you have any questions about an item or pretty much anything, the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki) is a successful resource full of information.

Is this the new childbirth dialogue pre-tutorial island?

That's very hard to believe. Playing a couple months when you're 13 isn't the same as 'playing since'.

I feel like we should restrict recolors to only Rune. That way when someone sees these they can still read it as rune. Helps players express themselves and makes F2P less bland to walk through as players can progress and then buy these variants.

+1 from me.  
---
That's fair. Honestly I'd be pissed too. I haven't personally done it. So if can't speak on how it feels.

Varrok, lumbridge, falador, taverly, tier 2 farming guild and gnome stronghold have tree patches, you're gonna plant trees in those fuckers and pay the dude to protect them. Plant the best tree u can.
---
After some time, ur going to plant some fucking fruit trees, present in brimmhaven, catherby, gnome stronghold, tree gnome village and tier 3 farming guild. Those fuckers take forever to grow.
---
I'm not going to teach people how to do herb runs now because this fucking comment will have one upvote anyway, but if someone need a guide on that, there are fucking 9 patches and u need questing and shit

Wrong path mate.

If you want=forced, oh makes sense. I never knew an option was an obligation.
---
Imagine not knowing how to screenshot in 2019.... 
---
Do mithril bars using blast furnace, solid 500-600k per hour after 60, a little less before that.
---
The option has the word Skybox in it, if you want to look for it. I'm not at home or else I would tell you exactly where to find it. But it'll be in the settings list, I know that much! 
---
Look up the word forced.
---
10 Steel Dragon kill in and my RNG is blown for the year...
---
:D
---
What’s wrong with making the actual word that’s correctly spelt an insta-mute? It’s not like they’re bypassing the filter to say it. I’m usually pretty fine with not making words be censored or insta-muted but I think this one case, for that one word, would be completely fine even if it means people just start bypassing the system then. There’s almost no acceptable time to use that word in OSRS.
---
You have no idea of my hatred for you
---
Customer service is eh. Everything else is right tho
---
Mate you can still dick around in those titles. There’s a million ways to tell someone to fuck off without being a cunt about it. Looksie. Tons of colorful cursing at your disposal.

And now you've finally admitted your ignorance. Cheers mate, you're gonna keep getting owned in the wild until you start preparing yourself to enter the wild.
---
That is how all mems weapons work in f2p lol.
---
Hey at least you didn't alch your karamja gloves like me
---
Ok? Your point is not obvious, unless you are telling me to drop the clue. Which I wont do because I want to do the clue. Which requires me to go into the wildy despite me not wanting to pvp.
---
R for Raising membership to $11
---
WINTER IS COMING!!!!!
---
this definitely has potential it’s a really cool idea
---
How about. Nah 
---
No, I don't think the offenders should be muted. No, I don't think the n* word should be filtered.
---
It's called freedom of speech. People are going to express themselves. If they can't call you the n* word, they're just going to call you something else. Blocking the n* word won't magically make the game less toxic.
---
To elaborate on what swampertman is saying: click options, controls, and the top right option makes it so your follower is moved to the bottom on left click/ right click menu.
---
I will keep getting killed and that's fine. I've never said anything against that. How did I admit my ignorance?
---
Team Cape Alpha got my upvote hahaha

They need to optimize this game so badly. One day hopefully 😪

Except we are forced into other parts of the game we don’t want to be in. Do you really think pvpers want to do the question for bis gloves? But we’re forced to do it.
---
Unless you're getting to the point where your run is about to end, I don't think it's really worth prioritizing certain bosses. You're gonna end up killing them all anyway, so the order isn't really important.
---
As for ultimate force, I wouldn't use it on those bosses you mentioned, since they'll all die so quickly anyway. The only time I'd use ultimate force is for those annoying to kill bosses (like some of the DT ones) that you only put in there so you get more points from the other bosses. Otherwise just let the ultimate force go away without using it.
---
Honestly yes take it I’m too lucky, Zulrah on 217, Corp on 53, Jad on 2, kraken on 323, 1281, and 1291 and now this, too many pets too much rng

What about total level???

Oh must have been added after i stopped playing rs3 thats cool though

Yes they are they have to do quest, train, get gear, and make money to go pking you dont just make a new account and start pking at level 3.

This is really cool suggestion and I’d love a new prayer book in old school. But there’s no way this could be implemented without massive overhaul of the engine. Changing how many ticks an action takes is not a current function of the engine and would be very hard to implement without potentially game breaking bugs appearing in other skills. 
---
I opted for it, but honestly I could see myself living without it. It kind of depends on your Magic level/teleports unlocked, because it could potentially have the same amount of teleports as 3+ Portal Chambers.

Why don't curses belong in the game?
---
Nah mate it's fine. The upgrades you want to go for are: Dragon scimi, fighter torso, defenders. Wear best legs you can. 
---
If you plan on doing Slayer (you should) aim for slayer helmet, until then get black mask. For amulet slot it goes: Glory, Fury, Torture.
---
Rings: Just use warriors ring or something until you can get berserker ring then imbue it. 
---
Cape: God Cloak, Ardy cloak 2, Fire Cape
---
Don't really waste your money on obby cape, it's overpriced and prayer bonus is generally more useful.

Some people pay over a grand for tickets to a sports game. It just depends on what you wanna do. Maybe its their favorite streamer and they really want to help donate to them so they can produce more/continue to make quality content?
---
Obviously those huge donations are rare anyways, but theres nothing wrong with subbing or donating to a streamer you like thats providing you with a service aka content you enjoy. Its why you gotta pay for Netflix or t.v. subscriptions. It also supports them so they can do what they do and do it full time even if they have enough subs. 
---
It makes an A.

I do, it was more of a statement of disbelief that it took me that long. I did not believe for a moment that it would be done in 168 kills for a second

Was that The Iron Platoon??

Dude aint even being condescending, just stating why he cant logically understand why some people act that way (and thats probably because most peoples arguments are purely about nostalgia and emotional bias and not logically objective) about updates that would make the game more fun.

Dude didnt even mention curses at all either so no clue what youre going on about.

Farming is one of those skills that has a lot of nice little milestones which is incentive to keep pushing it. For example: 65 second tier of farming guild, hespori and anima patch, 72 you get calquat, 78 spirit tree with boost, 85 third tier of farming guild and hard farming contracts, 88 second spirit tree with boost.

To provide some answers to your questions:
---
For your first question, warding has never been polled.
---
For your second question, warding has never been polled.
---
For your third question, Old School currently has a schedule of having three major updates a year. For the most part, these updates are entirely new content and are massive in size. Warding is the scheduled to be the third update  of this year, behind prifdinnas. Even though Jagex has been producing these updates we still do get updates that fix up older parts of the game, like the QoL months and other smaller updates throughout the year. It's a balance; If Jagex spent all of their developer time trying to fix every little detail of the old game without any new content, this game would be dead.
---
nope. He’s my favorite lolcow though. 
---
While I, being a poor college student that spends way too much on other stuff, wouldn't do it, I can see why people do it. If you watch their stream for a few hours every day spending $5 to sub really isn't much. Plus you get emotes and stuff.

Do you know what smh means?

So crafting and smithing are bad? Let's remove them, then. 
---
Yes. If you click logout during a wave, it will say "okay we'll pause the fight caves after this wave." Then, when you finish killing everything in that wave, nothing new spawns. The game says "you can log out now. fight caves will resume the next time you log in." But this means you can sit around in an empty fight caves pit for as long as you want, using the free regen, until you're actually ready to log out. 
---
So by waiting \~half an hour in between waves like this, I can conserve my food as much as possible until the later levels.

Yeah that’s pretty much it honestly 
---
That’s quite a bit of money 
---
As an avid pker i agree. Id prefer a lot of these to be unpolled qol
---
Lucker :/
---
Yeah I don’t understand it. I get maybe a liiitlebmoney here or there, but that’s it.
---
I honestly am of the belief that people like Slayer because it's another XP drop, with big potential payoff, for something they where gonna do anyways. People where going to grind Melee and Range skills, so they get something extra. 
---
When it first came out I thought it was going to legitimately be a skill based around weird creaturea that needed special equipment, and to an extent it is. Except after you get your slayer helm, all sense of that is out the window. The moment I have to go slay cows thats out the window. 
---
Give me salt and steel/silver flakes in a bag to use against wights. Make me chuck fire at trolls to stop insane regeneration. How about imbuing potion, debuffing yourself, but making it possible to slay a bloodsucker/chupacabraesque creature. 
---
The skill had the potential to make you feel like a monster hunter. One that needed to plan and research your enemy before facing them. Instead im just putting on my spooky mask and hitting things I was going to hit anyways. 
---
Gz fuck u
---
Why does everybody keep saying to range the fight caves instead of maging them? 
---
Nah man I love seeing 300 of them when i wake up in the morning its a very big achievement and everyone is special!
---
Looks fine to me, good luck. Keep your cool for Jad.
---
It's one of my favourite skills right now for sure. Even though I've been getting fuck all from konar recently.
---
It depends entirely on your playstyle. If you like bossing a lot with a team, having a pvm focused clan is a godsend. I personally enjoy the social aspect and grind mostly solo, so a social clan was more my type. I'd recommend joining one, but it is by no means necessary
---
Curses break the game tbqh. And i say this as someone who already has a pure waiting for turmoil to eventually be voted in by the mogoloids
---
No warning for fighting Sara or zammy wizards when digging. These are more expected of course but I say keep people on their toes
---
It's not the same as before but that doesn't make it not runescape. I think the gameplay of it captures the sense of adventure well, it just needs some rebalancing with older content. 
---
When I did my favour I did hosidious to 100% then arceuss to 100% then locked it in and did hosidious again... I was a touch annoyed it’s a nice idea in theory but is annoying that it doesn’t auto lock in and the new system is better

Possibly, neither of us truly have any data so making up numbers like that doesn't really mean anything. You seem to value effort needed as your definition of how easy something is (you need to do more tries with justiciar because you're not learning proper methods). I'm saying that ease is the minimum skill required to finish a run, regardless of effort.

Rewind time!

By what exactly?

Thank you for the reply. I'm enjoying the game, absolutely. My main problem, is that I quickly forget or don't realize the importance or relevance that my quests have for me in benefits outside of just the basic skills. An example would be like completing the ardy diary and getting that tele, it's great, but what other things have I done that would help me out immensely without me even knowing. I guess I'm just waiting for everything to click. I know it will happen eventually, just impatient. I also love how helpful and responsive the community is, though. I guess I just keep chugging along.

You chose to limit yourself

Are you dense ?

---
Appearntly not if u set up a hot spot on a phone via data and the. Tether via usb
---
You don't have a counterpoint and your account probably shit so your opinion doesn't matter. 
---
You're mocking the mindset but it is a fact, from a purely efficient standpoint, activities like Managing Kingdoms are from mandatory because they don't provide any XP, no uniques, and don't have the highest GP/hr of a moneymaker so when playing efficiently, it's not efficient to do. 
---
Trying to lap people always motivated me while training agility.  
---
  
---
It would be cool to have a lot more community worlds for activities.
---
If you look closely you can see that the op is a hcim. In the picture girlfriend posted the guy isn't.
---
Dam that’s a really smart idea dude
---
Graceful set at blast furnace since goldsmithing gloves and ice gloves remove the set effect. Boots of lightness and spottier cape are better than graceful boots/cape there
---
Didn't he make a new HCIM too? Is he gonna do both or is he just sticking to the unofficial one til it dies?
---
I actually only had a 63% chance of getting the drop 
---
Why are u going for a dwh as a main?
---
You have chosen to limit yourself, why would you want something specialy only for you .. no sense .. either train defence and stop crying or don't use long-range.
---
Sorry for my ignorance. Trying to learn more about the game as I recently started playing again, since I was a kid. What does the 52s in the run icon mean? 
---
Is it better to be a strength or attack pure?
---
i have 50 divination from just spins, never trained it once.
---
It’s just pixels bro 
---
approximately 1 dhcb's worth of gp
---
I’m actually a zerker pure and I was doing it for bragging rights. The name change was after I passed the 5K Kills for it as a joke with my friends. That I’m defiantly Going to go more than double the KC. As I did make a mistake and mis read lizards and shamans which I’m getting shit for but oh well it’s reddit.  
---
Short: I just wana say I got it as a drop. 
---
You gotta do it at the farming guild you turkey
---
Commenting for later
---
Pure. 40 attack 70 range and whatever your max strength lvl is without gaining combat levels anymore and just go chuck addy arrows in f2p at people then throw a r2h to finish em off.
---
It’s a quick start. Then you can train and build your account in different ways until you find out your ideal build.
---
Non-cosmetic rewards are necessary for clue items to maintain value. 
---
Ironmen cash stack on suicide watch
---
It used to be I'm sure of that.
---
I guess I’m not the only one who did this
---
medium clue scrolls have a 1/300 chance (or around that) of dropping ranger boots, which are worth like 25-30m. people make posts all the time about getting rangers at low kc. this is kinda mocking those
---
PETA wants a word with you.
---
99% confidence interval for a 1/1k drop is around 4600 kills. GL
---
On the same account? Prob only wines and maybe fly fishing
---
On a new account? I'm going for dragon slayer completion on an UIM alt, and it's quite fun
---
I know this is a meme, but I actually developed my own way of pan fry cooking shark while I was in croatia.
---
Take it and cut it into somewhat thin filets, then let sit in a pan covered in milk for 12 hours beforehand
---
Take them out, pat dry with paper towel, cover in a croatian mix of spices (Paprika, garlic, salt, pepper, flour) maybe 1:1 on all the spices then 1:2-3 on the flour. Don't dilute it too much.
---
In croatia we'd use sun flower oil, since that stuff's the cheapest, but I've had a hard time finding it in America and it really gives a nice taste to the dish. Vegetable oil will do, though. Turn the heat up to med-high, preheat the oil, then slap those dusty filets in there for a minute or so on either side. Make sure the oil gets all of it. Remove with tongs when it's golden brown, serve with tartar sauce, or on it's own with a squeeze of lemon juice.
---
Tasty stuff.
---
Got it today at 600 kills. Sorry bro. 
---
Yes
---
I've got 70 farming without realizing it. After Watermelons it just levels so fast and snape grass makes it faster.
---
People were also much less interested in doing clues back in RS2. Solving them wasn't a very streamlined process like we have today, with the wiki and good 3rd party clients.
---
Fuck my ass
---
Cheers for the info
---
There's a setting in the third-party client Runelite to change the number in the run energy orb into the number of seconds remaining. When you do this, it shows an "s" next to that number to distinguish it from the normal display method.
---
They’rnt*

Ohh I get it lol

---
Its a cool idea but the problem is how would new weapons and armour fit into the game? Its already possible to stack god knows how much damage in 2/3 game ticks. 
---
I think for PVP items to work they need to fulfill a different role, for example being more affordable than an AGS but only really useful in PVP, or have a fundamental change to how PVP works like damage dampening at high levels.
---
I by no means know the answers, but I do know that the weapons we have today are already so powerful, for new ones to be useful something has to change
---
As someone currently getting 99 fish while doing all 9 patches + bush/cactus/hops because he just came back to the game after giving away all his gold - I feel attacked.
---
On top of that, it would save Jagex time by not having to reset the accounts affected by the change
---
Reeeeeeeeeee

Not watching it within an hour of its release? Fuckin casual

You don't know how to screenshot?
---
Why are you so fixated on age? Insecure much? Also what a pepega analogy dude. If your idea of a "luxury interior" consists of solitary fun-foam so you can't hit your head every time you make a turn, sure. I'd rather have something i could customize and pay less for. I get it dude. You're a form over function kind of guy. Drive a honda civic as long as it was signed by tim cook kinda guy. You can talk your crapbook up all you want, but at the end of the day you've paid 1500$ for the performance of a 400$ laptop with a better operating system. And since when is a video card used only for gaming?
---
I see we all had the same father. Every time I thought of runescape in my childhood. All I could hear was the impending sound of that fucking lawnmower. When it would cut out and I’d hear him come inside I knew my time was about up... that pressure god damn 
---
I think the fight caves strategy guide on the wiki prefers d boots over dhide boots for the guthan method, but I am not entirely sure. It does give a nice little extra defence, since the blowpipe shreds through tzhaar anyway.
---
He put a lot of effort into his vids as well. Highly reccomend idfap
---
Agree
---
They rolled back their stats manually.
---
I even have the notifications for his videos on. I've been on the road untill yesterday so I couldn't really watch it.
---
It’s amazing the browser didn’t crash with those high rez pixel animations
---
Why do people expect a screenshot? If you're turned off by the quality just dont look lol? I was on reddit on my phone and couldn't be bothered to snap with gyazo and sign in for a lil post I made in excitement. Seriously, fuck you and that other guy who said the same thing. How you could have never had to screenshot before in 2019 is beyond me. Save the snarkiness for when your mom is getting you up in the morning.
---
Man, that thing should act as a ring of life when you're in ToB. It's way too unforgiving towards HCIM.
---
What? That sounds terrible. Just learn to 1 tick like every other UIM has to learn. 
---
this is the same internet connection, though.
---
He’s my hero 
---
you would need to be in a location with 2 seperate ISP's routing to the same location on two independent routers using the same IP for an actual backup connection.

Almost as if that was the point. Almost.
---
Feels Good mayne
---
Happy cake day bro 
---
CuteCockMunch73
---
You lied to me.
---
Well for one the monsters have high magic defense. For another range is easier to reposition than ibans due to the 1 tick delay on autocasting every time you click the monster. 
---
I love this idea, really hope it gets added! Although I will just remind everyone that this would also be BIS strength bonus for all other accounts up to 70 defence, rune/berserker pures included.

thank you for feedback
---
thank you for feedback, was screenshotted off already developed windows media player file
---
How pedantic do you get. Even Jagex labels PvP as pking (PvP worlds not pking worlds).
---
No. You see, the most recently added skill is always the worst skill because the work that went into it was work that could have been put into improving other skills. Each skill bares the dead content burden of every skill that came before it.
---
Would there even be enough people to get boats running consistently? It's been a while since I've PC'd, I guess all the noobies will need void.
---
Doing the exact same thing, 94 currently.
---
Because it’s a troll post
---
Depends on points of course. For team raids if you get like 20k points a raid you should get around 4-5 drops in 200. For solos with 30-35k points per raid you should get 6-7.

I've been looking for a setup to start attempt the Inferno, but there's a lot of information out there that's contradictory. 
---
Amongst some things I've seen are [this setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsYv2mjQArw) featuring Justiciar and a regen bracelet, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9y2wog/bis_inferno_gear/) setup using ancestral, and [comments saying to bring bandos.](https://twitter.com/bellisosrs/status/984521377536466944?lang=en)
---
What's the current BiS for Inferno? Is it worth bringing a brimstone ring? Is there any adjustments needed to just get your first cape and then move onto faster setups from there?
---
Sweet WMO fam
---
Yeah exactly 
---
The last update to Chambers would like to have a word with you.
---
Grrrrfmpfmfff
---
is [http://oldschool.runescape.com](http://oldschool.runescape.com) the official site?
---
But now I can run on more repetitive pre-determined linear laps for a more expensive rune!
---
Because literally any change to any pvp causes outrage. 
---
It's subjective, personally, as a 2004 player, I enjoyed the quests but pretty much everything else you mentioned (summoning and dungeoneering especially) I despised. This game is quite old now and a lot of the old school community will have a different idea of what 'old school' is.
---
Personally I'd never touch this game again if dungeoneering or summoning was added.
---
But good idea. I wish the wildy bosses had more involvement with pkers in the wildy. 
---
You can’t expect Jagex to pander to everyone when an update is released. If someone doesn’t read up on the changes, that’s ultimately their fault. I had a buddy of mine that didn’t know the farming guild existed like 2mo after release because he never checked the update logs. Shit happens.
---
Vanilla?
---
It seems to have worked, thanks fella
---
In this case it is a verifiable fact that it would not impact skill ceiling as it would be less effective than current high skill options

Yeah You certainly were! Thx for enjoying that moment with me :)

Well they are pandering to everyone because they are resetting affected accounts. Im just saying whats the harm in a little message to PREVENT it from happning?
---
It would heavily devalue total worlds without adding anything new to the game. I could see this working from the beginning, but it's too late into the content's lifespan to change it that drastically. 
---
Thank you 
---
It definitely did that at some point back in the RS2 days. Not sure if it's in osrs though.

I hate you, 1k+ dry with 3 leather and 2 rings

I'm assuming that he's talking about the IP address assigned to the laptop in the router, however I don't see how that would prevent a disconnect seeing as the connection on Jagex's side would seem as though it is switching IP.
---
You make spongebob memes....
---
Yup! I just posted this question the other day :)
---
I got that mug too :D
---
The question is, what if you were in the middle of fighting something?  Would runescape handle reconnecting you in the same way?
---
nice
---
Thanks for naming the white team cape after me 🙏

Yes. Yes it is.

We still love it.

So what was the point you were trying to make?

Is it worth starting NMZ at 60 att, 53 str, 53 def? Should I train up to 60s so I can use obsidian?

So u dont use fkeys?

Thank you :)

Thank you for clarifying my point

Damn! There mist be more useful places where this can be used!

If I get to end-game and die, I'll be really demotivated as a hcim. Not really the same if it happened on a normie.

You used to be woke and then tim crook came up behind you and filled you with his poisoned ejaculate. It courses through your veins until your body gives and you wake up in a chinese factory, putting screws into screwholes 16 hours a day. Your body will give again. You can't take it. You can't handle this "life". Enough is enough. You jump out of the window only to be caught by the ant-iSuicide™ net and flung back to into your mechanical hell. Eventually your body gives out again, only this time for good. Your vision goes dark, but it's okay. You've longed for this moment. You finally shut your weary eyes only to awaken at the pearly gates. As you look around, a hand reaches out and touches your back. You turn around to see none other than bill. fucking. GATES. He takes you on a stroll through paradise and explains that it was okay to be wrong. Then he breastfeeds you for the rest of eternity. 
---
Just youtube it :)
---
To be fair monkey madness is classic to osrs. Changing any of the rules that existed since the quest came out doesn’t seem osrs to me.. if jagex has tweaked old quests successfully though I’d possibly be open to it
---
It might look better as just a gold trim around the edges like black armour (g) as opposed to gilded.
---
people are social on reddit you're just intolerable
---
100% support. I’ve wanted kilts in rs for awhile. Always been a cool concept to me. Also this would allow for pures to wear something besides chaps. 
---
That's a weird one, maybe with the new herb patches supply has gone up while demand has stayed steady? I notice that ranarr seed prices have gone up a little which could support this, herb runs are popular, more seeds needed per run, more ranarrs generated
---
Just my general thoughts, im no economist but they haven't crashed *that* much. Not like dragon harpoons, now we need dragon pickaxe added to a slayer monsters drop table lol
---
r/wooosh

Definitely trying this as soon as possible

If I remember correct didn’t they poll 2 of the blessed dhide pieces together? I read comments and it seemed like 1 of the pieces requiring 1def was fine to everyone but the other was OP, you only had the choice to vote no or yes to both

That is not social, that is having the urge to tell others what to do to comprehand your own dissatisfied life youre living right now.

As of right now I'm in a bit on a conundrum, I feel this post didn't age well to say the least. The title doesn't hold up as due to my lack of research I've added content that had already been brought up by mods as well as fellow players through the blessed d'hide shields. 
---
The most important thing to me now is; I don't want the concepts and ideas that are there to suffer under my lack of competence. I've been thinking about re-uploading, but at this point it would just come across as disingenuous towards those who already chose to support my suggestions. My sincerest apologies, please try not to dismiss this post due to this fact.

Why do OSRS players live vicariously through the game and act like it's a thing to celebrate when the game has a certain amount of players or their subreddit passes other subreddits in subscribers?
---
Very nice screen shot brother, I'm proud of you. There are a lot of idiots on this sub that could learn a thing or two from you.
---
Unpopular opinion: nbombs and sort is just a word and while not a very nice one it has just as much impact as any other insult could potentially have. Its just a word, an insult. Being called an asshole is just as bad. And really, Its not that bad. Its not like someone stole something or hurt you physically, all they did was say a word to you which has zero lingering impact.

For all of those skills you can just use staminas. Also, for agility, regular rc and smithing you're never standing still so the difference is pretty minimal

Duradel or Konar?

Bring a bit of gear but no risk so you can give them a smack in return

Fair call about suffering vs brimstone.

Is it worth bringing a set of Justiciar?

&gt;though that probably only matters if you have a max cape

I really don't and i'm not even close to getting one.
---
Cost for the setup isn't a problem though, i'm just trying to work out BiS gear.
---
I never said it's ok. I said the profanity filter is and solution to the problem. Turn it on and the scary words would be on your screen. Like I don't understand how this is a discussion. The game already has a solution and obviously OP isn't using that solution, but still crying. 
---
Learn to look after yourself and solve your own dilemmas in life instead of crying about it for someone else to fix. The solution is literally there in the settings
---
Is this bait? Literally reread my comment and then we’ll know who’s really stupid. Lol.

If you're using nieve and getting assigned 30+ then skip. Skipping duradel steel dragons is dumb though, just blow through them with trident and expeditious. You will absolutely lose money but it's a short points task.

They are based on the team capes already in game; Team cape i (green / Guthix) Team cape zero (red / Zamorak) and Team cape X (blue / Saradomin)  I've decided to add 3 more color variations to represent the other colors or gods if you would like. Team Cape 8 (Brown / Bandos) / Team Cape Z (Purple / Zaros / Ancient) and Team Cape Alpha (White / Armadyl)
---
i look at this and think of futurama calculon screaming "WHY?!"
---
Its the other way round tbh. These posts never get to homepage, whereas OSRS comparison posts on the rs3 sub are on homepahe daily.
---
They also hate the country just to the east of that
---
Reupload it with just the plateskirt suggestion and the team capes if you want. Wait like a week though, they’re good suggestions.
---
Rube literally 
---
Most of you are overreacting, I like osrs but I play on RS3. The game has like A LOT of content, really good content, quests are amazing. It is just a different gane than osrs and should not be compared. Also if somebody does not like treasure hunter playijg as an ironman is an amazing way to get into the game.

The whole point of Runescape is to be an asshole to eachother without repercussions. /s

Jagex: "So you want another Blast Furnace world?"

I don't understand the love for Runescape 3s graphics. They aren't bad, but they aren't good either. Really out of place and clunky for a modern game.

Ok cool, thanks for just leaving this here

That’s why I started telling my mom I was only going to stay up “a little longer” (my parents used to go to bed at like 8), only for my mom to throw the den room’s door wide open at 5 AM and go “it’s 5:00, go to sleep.” and walk away. Then I’d get like five hours of sleep and get up to mow the lawn in the sweltering heat, thinking about how many cannonballs I needed to make.

Mine is the complete opposite. GPU being enabled almost certainly causes my client to lag in dense areas (like fossil island). Turning it off completely eliminates all stutter and FPS drops tgoufh

Daddy shark. Do do Doo do do do

The thing is that hcim play in such a boringly passive way to preserve their hcim status, so they limit their progress and enjoyment, despite inevitably dying and having nothing to show for it. If you die IRL, you don't keep playing.
---
Cerberus, Grotesque Guardians, K’ril Tsutaroth, thermal nuclear smoke devil are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. 
---
Zammy with arclight is very effective, although the meta there is Tbow.
---
It doesn't really matter what end it's on. You're at the mercy of something you can't control.
---
Honestly, try playing an ironman on RS3 and you'd be surprised how good / fun the game actually has become.   
---
Even if you don't care about slayer xp, the other slayer masters should give more points/hour on average since you're not required to do tasks in specific areas, though you can still use Konar every 10th task.
---
Changing slayer masters doesn't reset your streak unless you're in the middle of a task and go to Turael to change it. If you're concerned about getting multiple bad tasks in a row then you'd probably be better off not using Konar and using Nieve if you take into consideration some tasks offered by Konar are bad tasks due to their location while the same task offered by Nieve would be fine because you could slay in a different area.

Thats literally how the build always worked.

Losing the status is demotivating because you have to reassess your objectives. I know what you're saying, but its a psychological thing for a lot of people.

In seriousness- no chance at Jagex labelling it for sure- at the very least I want people to be able to google up "agility world", find this and the other ancient thread talking about using the same world

Maybe that's more true at lower cb levels. I never got attacked by normals at chins.

But yeah, maybe a 90 cb green drag killer needs to worry about normals.

dude not even its like dying because the world around you literally disappeared for no reason outside of your control. 
---
Could you imagine if like 1/100 people just randomly ceased to exist? You're sitting in a lecture and suddenly fucking Gerad just falls through the ether under him and well that's that.

Maybe next time don't fucking wake up in the morning and attempt to live your life Gerad?
---
I came back to osrs a few weeks ago but got a little burnt out so i made an rs3 ironman and holy shit dude im so addicted im having a blast with it
---
I didn’t even know death runes die
---
Its what i went for... i do have a life you know...
---
Depends on the boss man, like mole is usually just for fun so it's a split of the drops, but at say KBD, you'd maximise damage using ruby bolts to get the loots. 
---
Honestly it depends on who you're doing the PvM with, but splitting loots makes it more fun 100%.
---
Looking for people to play the game with, thought it might as well be people in my area!

Thank you I'll think about it perhaps it's for the best.

I obviously wasn't expecting the pet upon completion, the cape was reward enough. It was just an unexpected bonus and I admit, extremely undeserved.
---
I used trident of the swamp, serpentine helmet and toxic blowpipe. For armor i used black dhide and mystic with obi cape. I got 75 magic, 80 ranged, 70 prayer and 80 defence.

Created one maself

I'm going to be honest I only just finished Jad so in my mind it seems fairly deserved. Regardless, awesome pet man anyone with that gear has had a grind anyways.
---
Isn't this a feature on mobile already? If it would auto log you I think it's too much of a security risk. If all it does is type in your RSN then I think it's useless and unnecessary. What they **should** add is the ability to paste in a username or change the position of your courser without having to backspace..

That edit is quite funny but dont do everytime ok thanks you

---
Why not make a minigame based off of an agility race? I always though a rooftop agility race course would be something agility desperately needs..
---
Starts in one of the big cities:
---
Groups of 5 enter in a "rooftop race" by taking to an npc or interacting with a scoreboard or something. Players can stake gp or items if they want to much like dueling arena. The basic reward for this would be a special currency or xp drops for 1st/2nd/3rd places plus whatever might have been staked during the race. If a currency would be designed like Mark's of grace for placing top 3 then make a couple pieces of new gear or an alternate version of the graceful outfit.
---
Pros:
---
Brings a fun activity into agility rather than mindlessly clicking in circles.
---
Brings people together for agility skilling.
---
Mire content for a very stale skill.
---
Cons: 
---
People might like it too much and all shortcuts will become pointless once everyone maxes agility.
---
No black background, no yellow text.
---
We know it’s you _Serene_.

Nice try.

You tryna doxx? Cmonbruh

It disturbs me that people are worried by strangers not posting on reddit. Dude could be doing 1000 more productive things, but nay, not posting on reddit = you're probs dead. Let people live guys. Nothing worrying about not using reddit..

Or they could have a scotland island in RS, we already have an africa so why not?

This is awesome, thanks bro!

It does give you another question though so why sarcasm

I really dislike the zeah hoods :(

&gt;play in such a boringly passive way to preserve their hcim status.

On a thread about a guy dying at tob 
---
absolutely senseless rant
---
Social media! 
---
Elite void all the way with salve ei but if you die like more than 1/10 times i dont think its worth.
---
I had to look up [this map] to see which ones were considered Africa but going by the outlines:
---
Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Niger.
---
I only know this because, one too many Sporcle quizzes.

I’m glad you finished senpai

What???? If you die 1 once at vorkath every 10 kills you’re still easily making profit

Is that a kkk hood? Never seen one before in-game

It's a cancer

That interface absolutely needs an "info" button like the spells one. Same with prayer.

Its better to learn zulrah or do other pvm for money.

Yeah pretty much. It’s not as simple as OP wants it. But once you open your keyboard to start typing (on iOS at least) it will show you stored accounts that you can one click to enter all info

I wonder what build OP plays

weirder than people that spend money on a vanity computer?

It depends, I might do a few more shows but the hype for the shows seems to have decreased. I will continue if people still are interested though!

Oh good, the weekly thread on this. 
---
Go to a world without many players and mine in the dwarf mine. Even if you have only 1 spot because of bots, it should go rather well.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
You can flinch elvarg and take zero damage. There’s guides on YouTube I recommend looking into it
---
Not if you’re dying only once every 10 kills. That’s 100k which is basically 1 kill. And zulrah takes way longer to learn than Vorkath. So much time at zulrah getting no loot because you are dying so much learning it.

Mithril is also from mithril and carbon. My science teacher looked at me when I suggested he had neglected to teach us about mithril and rune when going over common metals in class.

And then the students and teacher clapped.

You can also do a gp swap from a non iron to your iron on RS3 and buy the bonds there. This is usually cheaper than buying the bonds outright in OSRS

It was pretty out of place even back in '05.

Be a winner, kill a spinner

That's what I get for being an iron I guess

It's true my name is Adolf Einstein.

The balance is shocking. There is such a huge amount of content that never gets used because you level so fast. I'd actually go further and say the early games sucks too, it's a really overwhelming experience and really mismatched.

The distribution only matters when you pick stuff up, but favor is checked every day.

I'm calling bullshit, spins arent around anymore and there's no prizes that are 10m.

Is this happening often? Why is it still dropped in your inventory or ground instead of bank? Ffs even a pop-up saying I got it and need too visit X NPC to get it would be a hundred time better, no? 
---
He just did...
---
When someone doesn't realize that / anything is inserting code comments.
---
He said he would continue until he dies a true death. Then, he'd likely burn out immediately and then he at least has the new account.
---
Thankfully that's not how RNG works :) 
---
This might be world first
---
Stfu crybaby, it’s a grind like any other, but at new players’ expense. It’s basically griefing. 
---
I wonder how good these “pkers” are at pvp only games

IIRC there's a cap on the number of birds nest. If you can find a post in this sub about a big miscelania loot there was a lot of talk in the comments about it.

this reads like a tumblr fanfic post

I watched a couple of them and decided to log in, luckily my friend gave me a bond.

it’s definitely not B. If your accounts compromised then you might not even be able to secure it yourself if they’ve got their claws in deep enough

I mostly meant questing as the early but yeah I agree. Getting simple stuff as magic in osrs is a pain while on rs3 it's just a matter of time instead of effort.

The only real sturggle is getting 95 prayer/90 herblore for late game content.

Go spend how much you are willing to lose on return sets 20-40m then just get out there &amp; do it. Don't worry about losing your gear at the beginning. You gotta lose a bit to get better

Wow, it takes an investment like that?

Guess I better focus on questing more and clearing more of the game
---
The intent wasn't to insult OP or hurt his feelings, though, just to point out how "undeserved" it is.

I don't take commerce stream so maybe that's why it wasn't mentioned.

with just doing Addy Platebodies it's around 150k xp/hr, and after alching them it's 9,984 each...

Smelting the bars is about 50k an hour at blast furnace...   
---
I think profit is really small considering buying the ores coal and nature runes, but I increase the amount of ore by 500 every run... doing a few blood rune runs to help with the cost for coal... I think I could make money out of this method, but not for a while.

You're 100% right, for what it's worth. The wilderness is terribly designed from a game design point of view. The only reason any people who don't want to engage in PvP enter the wilderness is because Jagex stuffs it full of overpowered content to bait people into the wilderness. The wilderness (and all of the associated bosses, the chaos altar and revenants) is just a stain on an otherwise great MMO.

Its all about stats. Either work toward a pure 1def a zerker 45def or a med 70def. Other than having a designated account build you can be maxed, or close to.

If you are already a main account use it to make the gp for a second account that dedicated to pking. Many guides on yt show how to make a pure in 24 hours &amp; with little gp.

which you are free to recollect at any time.

Raids 1 already has Overloads. And it is probably best not to add an overload, especially if it would go for mils per dose. It would just serve to devalue challenges. For example, first ToB kill or Inferno even.

Maybe a quest item chest in your POH could be a workaround?

But thats like rough estimate and the math just happens to fit in. As in 10% annual growth would be 1,9487171 times the original in 7 years. Yes it's very close but I can't understand why there is that 70/10 since it is not the actual way to calculate this and doesent make connection with prosentual calculations normally used. You can only use thst formula to to figure out how long it takes to double something with 10% increase while requiring you to know the answer in some mode already. Why not just say it's 7 without adding the nonesense.

Nice yew seed.

I want to use god eggs to make overload cakes, melee range and mage specific, each cake provides 3 "doses".  Eggs are rare, and you need high cooking and woodcutting to get eggs.
---
the formula is years = 70 divided by growth rate
---
some people do 70, some 72, but considering growth rate is also an estimate i don’t see why it’s an issue. Also you can google “rule of 70” if you want, it’s very widely used

Can confirm. My Mac even screams when I try and play Minecraft

Look up the portal you should attack based on what combat style you’d like to use and then just go kill pests near that portal and the portal itself when it opens! Initially I thought it’d be tough but really it turned out to be pretty afk. Never needed potions or food either because if you die it’s no big deal at all.

pures are only a small part of the playerbase, and on top of that was the vast majority of them not affected, we're talking about maybe a couple hundred players at most here.

Why do we fall off the horse?

and no one learns about compound interest in math class. statistics isn't really common in high school and finance is generally an elective so economics would be the only time you would expect to learn it. I didn't learn about it until 12th grade.

Ive got multiple accounts with emails as usernames, i only remembered one account that i made back in 05, and i got it back after i made my main, sooo...
---
so toxic
---
STOP TELLING ME THE TRUTH
---
Earn lots of gold by doing something that is more tolerable to you than other methods (for me I enjoy killing wyverns I got 711k in 20 minutes once) then gain the skill requirements through the fastest exp methods  it’s probably not the “best” way but that’s how I go about it
---
I worked at one two years ago in a mall near me before I started college and they did. Who cares? Maybe different macs in different stores are setup differently?
---
This gives a way for hackers to access your banked gp without bank pin. They can just buy items off the GE and trade it to a mule. 
---
ive seen it in a bunch of math classes, they just dont call it compound interest, its all just different formulas to do with growth rates
---
it's understandable that it'll take some time, but as far as anyone is aware (apparently) they haven't even started yet, it's been 3+ days.
---
it's demoralizing to anyone that's yet to post in the official reset thread.

Damn I was joking ya’all too sensitive

Lol good luck

And again.. This is great lol. One more try u/_serene_

Honestly, I've never seen it before and I have a math degree, assisted in teaching plenty of college algebra classes where they cover interest rates. It's a useful trick though, and easy to see why it works.
---
In this case you are the toxic one.
---
I dont understand whats the fuzz about. Inferno takes no skill (its completely rng like cooking and woodcutting) and pets Come and go at the rate of fifty fifty: either youre gay, or not. Probably a bit. 
---
I take humidify to prep faster, works on wall. Still working on doing no preps
---
Wait, but shouldn’t it not be counting the b ring? So he will protect either the helm or the blessing (I think the blessing is worth more but I forget. 
---
Or is that not how it works?
---
Bro usually I like latinas and whites, but Ive seen damn fine girls there.
---
Use teleports? Amulet of Glory teles you to a furnace and bank, or you can use Fally TP (close to two banks, a furnace, the Mining Guild, Motherload Mine, and the dwarven mines).

It's made from the same type of dough but filled with 2 lines of chocolate. These are the most common "croissants" in Belgium and France.

holy shit, wtf why lmao....... We removing security features now?

Underrated
---
I'm not exactly sure what your complaint is. Are you unfamiliar with the concept of pointing something out that might be badly received, so you add something to soften the blow? This is just normal social interaction, dude. It shouldn't be difficult to understand.
---
Pretty sure all rune items are basically at Alch value at this point. Won’t make much of a difference.
---
Mole is easy solo, barrows technically is a boss, most wildy bosses
---
Cuz i'm not Korean? And I thought most played games in Korea are Pubg, LoL, Overwatch and all the other Pc bang games. No idea about Korean games outside black desert online. From what I have heard that game is basically p2w. 
---
Thought you could add +1 to the email address so you can use the same email each time?

The white knights have relocated to Lumbridge
---
I don't see people shitting on OSRS there, just people saying that the community of OSRS loves to bash RS3, which as this post whos comments we are currently in shows, is true.
---
Yeah because it happened to me. It can happen to anyone. Jagex told me I must have clicked a malicious link. I insisted I did not, that I only used the official Jagex client. They told me to be more careful...
---
I don't know where else to ask this, but does anyone know what happened to the saradomin statue in falador square? Now there is just a plinth there, instead of the statue I remember like the one in the background of this picture.
---
But it's what devs want, so it may happen regardless.
---
&gt;Clue Scroll Graphic Changes 
---
&gt;We would also like to include a graphical change to the way clue scrolls look in your inventory and bank. This is to make it easily distinguishable between the tiers of clue scrolls. We welcome any designs on helping make clue scrolls easier to identify. 
---
Yeah for the diary even if you have to tele out you can come back and she'll be right where you left her. 
---
Maybe my info is dated. I know rs3 did have disgusting inflation for years.
---
Then don’t unlock bosses
---
Same
---
Rs3 needs to eat gold not items.
---
What do you mean?
---
Might be a quest related thing, it was there yesterday when I checked
---
wollah 
---
Yea I have no idea, because I have received the message before so I KNOW it was a thing.
---
First traps, now RC? 
---
do you have goldsmithing gauntlets?
---
y dont i stick my foot inside u mole lol
---
I was 8 aswell as far as I know 
---
Purest get shit on by tanks. You clearly know nothing about pking so take your opinions elsewhere.
---
Strong no thx, the trimmed hoods looks nasty, and not everyone throws the hood , some actually like the way they look. 
---
Also subbed to both. Went to check the sub just incase i was wrong. There’s barely ever any mention of OSRS on that sub. 
---
I think it’s fair to say each sub equally shits on eachother. 
---
Nope, is it worth it for a new player?

It just makes you seem insincere, "you're shit and your accomplishment is undeserved, but congratulations!" is far shittier than just "you're shit kid"

I’d love them take your idea but make some sort of quest with it
---
Not to mention / isn’t even universal for programming comments and even for java it’s // not /.

Is that a normal client or runelite feature

You need to enter your pin for the GE too you know.

Been playing for a couple hours, same exact thing as Ronan's. Well made and will continue to play it!
---
You dont "need" a second account. But people, I, have account made to min/max my stats so that I have the highest damage possible to give me a better chance vs other who have similar accounts. You can pk on any account just you may get crushed by other who have better stats than you. 
---
The most common is a pure account. With these account people stay 1 defence because it keeps their combat level low with still having high damage. 
---
Homestly I'd be happy with just an indicator on which is a quest item, then I can easily sort it.
---
Right now I have no idea what is for a quest and what is a key for a random gate I probably won't use for another 3 years but when I will I'd hate myself for dropping the key which may or may not require several hours of stupid trekking to get...
---
Not true at all. Probability theory is SUPER mathy. Theoretical statistics is pretty mathy, although has a real-world flavor to it. Applied statistics isn't math.
---
It makes learning waves easier, the real difficulty is Zuk and 3x Jads which Justiciar doesn't help with at all.
---
Is it worth doing blast furnace for mith bars if I don't have the coal bag?
---
If you’re a member literally do a few quests (waterfall, fight arena, vampire slayer, tree gnome quest) using magic and never have to touch a single weapon under rune, then do monkey madness with magic, put xp on attack then train the last bit with rune scim til 60 then d scim til whip
---
drop them in f2p or no balls.
---
*laughs in ginger*

Thanks for the positive feedback! I'm glad you're satisfied with the plugin!

Congratulations you're one lucky q p!

i like the way it looks to be honest instead of just being one solid color 
---
Yea that's why I assumed he must be talking about the external IP, since the local IP wouldn't make any difference, but having the same external IP assigned from 2 different ISPs seems like a problem.
---
imo yes.
---
You could do Waterfall quest and get immediately from 1-30 attack and strength.
---
Achievement diaries give you good goals to go for.

Fairy Rings (From Fairytale part ii) are a great way to get around

Thank god for that /s I thought you were serious for a second

Understandable sir, have a good day

the point of this post is the chat
---
Seems like f2ps have it rough
---

---
Perhaps!
---
Thought my sarcasm was bleeding through enough, apparently not. 
---
Thanks for the reiteration of octopus though. :)
---
Unrelated, but does agility increase your running stamina?
---
[I like this new format] /s
---
Depends on how good you are. Ancestral + Arma + Suffering is considered the BiS because as long as you learn how the inferno works, it means you clear the waves faster so you use less resources and because you're doing the inferno faster, you don't have to maintain your perfect clicks for as long. Additionally, because you blow through the waves faster, you get to the more challenging portions quicker too so you can practice and learn those waves quicker.
---
Sometimes when people get comfortable with the waves, the later ones can have some bad spawns so people like to bring a BCP for their first completions just so they can camp pray Mage and tank the Ranger/Blobs when they reposition to another pillar without having to worry about missing flicks.
---
Justiciar is basically full wheelchair mode where you have no confidence in your skills at all and basically rely on RNG to tank range hits constantly and hope you don't splash. It's generally not recommended to use Justiciar unless you absolutely think you can't do it otherwise. Justiciar makes learning a pain in the ass because you can't get consistent runs, the runs you do take so long, but it makes mistakes a lot more forgiving too.
---
Thought the sarcasm was strong enough, but apparently I was wrong. :smile:
---
I've died more to Galvek than to post-quest Vorkath lol. I agree, Galvek probably is the hardest quest boss in the game. DS2 is still my favourite quest in game though.
---
No, what im saying is that the solid gold obsidian maul looks retarded, im not implying anything else bud.
---
It's 6x faster to mine now at lvl 99, so supply is out growing demand. 
---
DS2 for all of it's challenges is definitely my favourite quest in game. 
---
Looooooooser
---
Sort of. It increases the regen rate of your stamina.
---
As a member you can also use stamina potions which give 20 stamina per dose and lower stamina usage by 70% for 2 minutes. 
---
The amount you mine is scaled to your level causing a surge of ash to enter the econony. Supply is greater than demand right now. 
---
Titanus

Grats you're retarded

The bracelet. Look up expeditious bracelet and read it 
---
What is this? The jagex justice league?
---
They shouldn’t do promotions because you’re scared people will take advantage of them? Bonds are only 3m. If you think bot farms are really beating sweat over getting membership from prime you’re oblivious. 
---
Cant Jagex just make more spots for bursting in the catacombs already?
---
Happened to me but with my first unique (serp) on my btw. Feelsbadman :(
---
IMMATURE PEOPLE? 
---
Have you ever had a pure at a decent level go against an MSB-&gt;AGS pure? AGS already does 68/71 (no bring/bring) for pures, and with next to no defensives, it's accurate as hell. Now combine with a 40 Gmaul hit and a 25 MSB hit or a 30+ mage hit. Melee spec choices for pures are already heavily unbalanced to the point where if you're not playing a voider or zerker, you might as well teleport if you use your spec and the opponent still has theres but survives.
---
ive never gotten crashed or crashed anyone at dust devels in catacombs, how often does this happen?
---
no, ur not smart.
---
50 out of 50 would make it 100%
---
Is this the new meta?
---
This is the problem right here. They can't just ban people for runecrafting a bunch
---
Nah its really shit compared to osrs. Its better than regular rs3 sure but its not hard to beat that
---
The most people could do is rp :3 in the chat
---
He called that hed get rangers if he hit the a q p (in chat)
---
And.... YOINK
---
Did you take a screenshot, send it to your phone, then screenshot that picture to post? Only reason I can think of that bottom bar being there
---
W
---
I was a zerker before, so ive had rune for a yearish and just went for drag today 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
how i do that 
---
Would you feel the same way towards a rune defender ornament kit? Currently the only armor left in the gilded set to release, and would have that niche value with the zerker community.
---
Free as in it takes 10 hours to get? That's not really free, but yeah I agree it's good enough right now
---
Bots don’t care about crashing tho 
---
Just add hard reqs then jagex can just not give a duck 
---
Serp helm needed to be buffed as it was performing lower than its costs. An item dropped from arguably one of the hardest bosses in the game should not be as good as an easy quest item. Not to mention the fact that this kilt would be oriented towards PvP and not PvM. PvM is very differently in that Jagex can just make new bosses have more health, while that's not a possibility in PvP. If you keep adding things that are going to be BiS, you'll end up at a point where you simply oneshot someone from full health, which is neither fair or fun gameplay. 
---
More damage is not as detrimental in high defence pking, as the chance of you being hit is way lower, but in low combat pure territory, your attacks are way more accurate.
---
Yeah I took a screenshot to send to a friend, then decided to post it on here, but it was really zoomed out so I zoomed in on the tab and screenshotted again lol
---
But think how many alts you can run!
---
If you're a minor it's fine, but consent the law in my state is 16. It's weird if you're an adult saying this about minors cuz then that's statutory 
---
Good bot
---
If they are playing insane hours to accumulate and then sell gold, isn’t that just as bad in the grand scheme of things lol?
---
I like this idea, I was burned earlier on after dropping items used in later quests. Not too bad to reobtain them but kind of annoying. I think this could fit well they’d just have to use the same item list the wise old man already uses to remove items from your bank and instead of trashing them they can go to POH
---
How do we even use the snake charmer?!
---
As it should be. Just like mage demolishes melee, melee demolishes range, and range demolishes mage. That doesn't make up for the fact that pures are way too strong already.
---
Lmao this is hilarious, hating on apple is more 'sheep' than actually evaluating whether one is good for you or not?
---
Most programmers use mac's these days, as it's an easier option than dealing with windows and personally find it much faster to program in than linux.
---
Same bro.
---
Same with pestle and mortar being used to grind up herbs and shit, cuz who the fuck actually uses one of those irl? And with tinderboxes being used to light a fire... And moulds being used to make most jewelery (or castings)... And how leather was made. 
---
God damn dude RS taught me more than my mum
---
In second grade we had a spelling test and one of the words was "Defense", the American form of the word. I couldn't really remember how to spell it but then I realized that it was a skill in Runescape so I wrote "Defence" thinking I was a genius, I got it wrong.
---
This makes a lot of sense.

wahhhh

Hmm, I'll need to get some more keyboards so I can multibox with my feet....

Ha ha ha what’s so funny

Yup, that's how these things go though. People see one person do it on a thread that's on /r/all, and then repost it for karma for the next month.

The real powermove is saving it and waiting a month+ to post it. Long term investment, but HUGE KARMA POTENTIAL BOIS

Redwoods are huge trunks that are cut through like twenty feet up? Damn dawg those must be the redwood 2.0s cuz when I saw them they had the whole thing rendered
---
It's pretty useful for doing napkin math or rough mental estimates, but it's more accurate the more times you're compounding interest (and gives about a 1% error for continuously compounded interest), but how useful it is in real application is sketchy since you lose accuracy and calculators are so plentiful. 
---
The real useful part of it is that you can teach it to people in an economics class that have never seen logs before and it's super easy to understand
---
Ah. A man of culture I see
---
It’s interesting that you’ve had a positive experience. I’d say I have someone crash me almost half of the time. Or at least to the point where I always carry anticrash gear for when it happens. 
---
At least it leads to some hilarious interactions.
---
He taught you about addy, at least.
---
Why I am gey?
---
Well of course you fuck, how else they gonna keep out the rain.
---
It’s about 200-300. 150 if you’re lucky

Honestly getting a 99 def pure is my next goal after i max this account.

You should really get a coal bag before doing much blast furnace. It makes it almost twice as fast.
---
Did they nerf training at NMZ? I was doing the spellsey afk method for range, and I'm getting 10k xp less per hour than I was yesterday, doing the same exact thing, same gear, same arrows, same spot, same frequency of potting, etc.
---
Think he based it on this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igVLTttJDnk&amp;t=14s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igVLTttJDnk&amp;t=14s)
---
This must be an old picture
---
Its not just you no, but its past the point of adding upgrades in better gear... so what else can they add? new areas? need new gear. new quest? need new rewards. So Recolours make sense in a way.. Also they wont buff F2P.
---
It's the music that gets me.
---
That’s so sweet of you, u/METH_IS_LIFE

I think he did ask before, but I was a bit late to the part :)

yeah i got it a while ago but i didnt use reddit and now i do so i wanted to post it

Awesome and respectable clan. Very dedicated and respectful staff!

Are you soloing? Duo? Trio?

No, Liberia has a decent education system and a growing economy. It's not that bad tbh. Ever since the civil war ended a few years ago, it has been quite stable and peaceful. Except ebola, that set them back. But what do you mean, "the rest of the country"?
---
Agreed just as bad, but almost impossible to prove hence why we have this situation 
---
The GE will always sell to the highest offer. 
---
If 2 people are tied for the highest offer it‘ll go to the first offer as long as they have been logged in within 2 weeks.

&gt;statistics isn't really common in high school

That's terrifying.

Nice!

I also had the same kinda help with willow trees and how theyre planted on banks, and what they look like.

Definate article breach
---
Thank you to everyone that came! I had a blast doing these shows and it keeps me motivated to work on more material. However, I'm all out of jokes for now and coming up with more was a challenge even for the second show. I might do a show or two for people who missed these so that I can reuse some jokes but it will probably take a while to set up an original third show. Anyways, see you around folks!
---
When I was a kid I thought of having a multiplayer video game like this where if you die the game stops working, I’m sure I wasn’t the only one 
---
I wish green dragons still looked like that, much sexier.
---
Interesting to see everyone's different experiences. I've been crashed exactly once, and the guy changed his mind and hopped after I called him a dick for crashing. 
---
Awesome idea!
---
Horrid design. 
---
Don't forget about king of the skill, too.

I know, if he doesn’t start doing these videos bi-weekly I’m going to start having withdrawals

I havent had any problems with my FPS on any of my PC's... Oh wait they're not laptops.

Aha, start? We both know it’s already happened haha

Seeing that rev pkers pk single players with full teams and that is mechanically unfair, I propose we make the whole rev cave single combat to promote fair fights also. 
---
Boy I just did a midterm on statistics. Why am I so retarded? 
---
*cold sweats*
---
Yea that's definitely true. I think quests like FairyTale 2 are SUPER beneficial, as after I completed it, I never had to buy any TP amulets or tabs, since there's basically fairy rings all over RS.  My personal favorites for quests is the  Myreque Series and the The Return of Xeric Series. Those 2 in particular make me feel like I'm part of an exciting revolution to take down the evils that haunt RuneScape lol. It actually gets me excited and I dont mind the grind whatsoever

Now these are some Chad's.

When my stats were lower I was using nats to make some gold for supplies and then I came back to the game and saw nats had dropped 100gp 😳
---
But why
---
she has no gp for these, she loses gp on the ffa raids because she get this unlucky
---
No runecrafts is bad
---
I don't think it's necessary since dhide pants don't require defence or quest. But would be cool to complete set
---
their doing new clue scroll rewards so theres going to be more cosmetics, vote no if you dont want them.
---
Not an Ironman, but one week I finished all quests except mmii and ds2. Burnt my self out doing that nothing else was fun, until I tried out wildly slayer. Sorta odd but it’s exhilarating when you’ve gotta outrun a pker.
---
That's 2 months of membership, or 3 bonds
---
50/50, it either happens or it doesn't
---
Just like how you hid the Runecrafting?
---
Yeah well on my last post about 40 comments were asking the source and it was literally on top of r/all so
---
Thanks, which slayer master should I go to first? at lvl 1 slayer and lvl 53 mele stats. 65 combat level. Ive wanted to do slayer for a while
---
It isnt
---
I thought my screen on my phone was dirty af for a moment
---
Runelite has OSBuddy ge prices
---
Elite Void or Armadyl for ranging lvl 221 TzHaar-Ket at 85 range?
---
Not checking RS Hiscores via Runelite's built in interface smh
---
Would be worthless since they have worse stats than black d'hide. They would have to be equal or greater to have any real demand.
---
Herblore is good for moneymaking? i have 2M atm. but thats about it.
---
Never played an ironman, could you explain for me? I always just assumed you couldn’t trade request ironmen. 
---
Agro skeles or ask someone to tank lol
---
I love this
---
You're right! The thing is, I downloaded all the songs from [here](https://archive.org/details/OldRunescapeSoundtrack) and it didn't include all 599. If you know of a complete source, please tell me so I can fix it. In any case, you can always add your own songs and sounds to the program easily by just adding them to the folder.
---
Smithing is your only way yes. That's tough as hell but I don't think getting a rune scim has ever felt so good than a f2p ironman hitting 90 smithing
---
Why does the pic wobble??

I did this. Spent well over 2K USD for a VR setup. Ended up playing nothing but OSRS a few months down the road. Lmao

So we are playing that game...

For what it's worth, I've been training (albeit with melee) using the exact same bosses and have not experienced any changes in rates. Are you sure your XP/hr tracking method is correct? I know with RuneLite, particularly when logged in for long periods of time, it can occasionally display obviously incorrect rates. 
---
You have a lot of alts. And time on your hands.
---
Oh boy...
---
i love that natures are so cheap dont @me baby
---
When was the last time you changed your Password and Pin? Not changing that on a basis could mean your information was leaked. There's no way to bypass the pin other than waiting 3 days to change it, so it means someone had access to your account at one point and either waited or your computer has/had a RAT on it at one point whilst recording all your info.
---
OP clearly logged into the middle of a conversation...
---
a lot of money on botted accounts there. looks like wearing everything you can that doesnt require quest points. Answers the question of why 3a helm. bot in nmz to 99 combat stats then sell account. 
---
&gt;bae 
---
are you 13 lol
---
Not correct, 1,228,825 xp is required.
---
It's good to just pre-emptively announce that you're an ironman, just in case. 
---
##BanLynxTitanNow
---
You can get more from the guy who starts the shadow of the storm quest
---
But if I don't drop trick when making darklight and Arclight it will all be for naught
---
Why aren't you in the Woodcutting guild? Also you should work towards unlocking Fossil Island. Start on Birdhouse runs to get your Hunter up so you can eventually do Herbiboar. That will allow you to get Fossils which you can use for Slayer xp.
---
Ironmen are f2p now I see
---
I just recently got 91 runecrafting.  I cry.
---
Lmao. My entire computer is unorganized. 
---
yeah like add a pointy spike here and there and woah much cooler
---
Error on playback? Maybe it’s just my phone but it won’t load
---
In what scenario is a slayer helm not better? It gives better accuracy and damage bonuses than the entire void set. I think you're talking about killig them off-task. In that case void can be better than d'hide.
---
would be good cool to implement, maybe could be put in through a "third-age ornament kit" that you use on normal 3rd age to make it into these? like fury ornament kit?
---
You got 2 of the best rewards, stop feeling sorry for yourself.
---

Pointless. Your login email should be random anyway, so you're less likely to be hacked.

Did you end up getting those bowstrings?

Pures being able to wear blessed vams and chaps (they can already wear black dhide chaps and vams, so it would only be a +1 prayer increase/cosmetic)
---
What settings do I do to insta pickpocket? I'm trying and all that happens is i tap and the options appear as opposed to be holding for the options. Surely I want to be able to just spam tap for easy pickpocket.
---
hows HCIM in f2p? 
---
i have a few OSRS bonds on my main but dont know if i want to stick with a hardcore.
---
my main goal is try skilling enough to get supplies for wintertolt or is there a better way?
---
It probably depends on how easy-to-crash you look like. I've never been crashed on any task during 20m slay on an iron man
---
the only thing she knows about runescape from passively observing me is that its based in medieval times
---
Guthix is the best
---
I don't know if it varies by phone, but using an iPhone, it disconnects after probably 5-10 seconds of switching apps, and I believe pretty much instantly on locking the phone.
---
First time, I messed up the aggro and got hit for a 10 by the moss giant.  
---
Second time, I messed up and got hit by two 5's by the spiders inside the waterfall when using them for aggro.

Basically, I'm mentally handicapped. /wrist

You could have 1 shot jad with any 1 of those pixels.

Good thing Windows has 3+ ways to screenshot at any given time built in...

I haven't done Dks in some 12 years, do you still need 2 people to open the door to get to them?

weird, because I had the complete opposite.

this was the dps calc I used and armadyl came out ahead, which makes sense because tzhaar kets have 190 defence and void's multiplicative bonus makes it better on targets with low defence while flat accuracy bonuses (from ranger armour) are better vs high defence targets.  
---
blowpipe, addy darts, assembler, anguish, pegasians, imbued archer with void was averaging 64.92% chance to hit and 5.41 dps while the swapping void with armadyl and barrows gloves resulted in 72.93% chance to hit and 5.46 dps.

the update wasn't in the weekend.

Honestly, Dovy is a decent looking dude with a decent bank. Why did he ever settle for someone like her? 
---
In verziks room aren't there several models of justiciar? Any of them would be nice
---
I have a 20 def pure I'm working on myself, though I have little experience with pking. The biggest advantage 20 def seems to give is the ability to wear Mystic for more accurate magic. I'm not sure your pk style, but Mystic being the biggest strength makes it seem like tri-bridding is really the most/only viable option. Ranged/Melee probably isn't enough if you just stick to them.

not having an old RS3 account that hasn't logged in OSRS so you can have an username ironman. big yikkes from me 
---
his fall over the last year and a bit has been super strange
---
What the hell is the purpose of this stream? Faking drama for money??
---
That’s the joke 
---
You can drop a pet rock on the place the second person would stand and then open the door 
---
All the other pieces are worse than black dhide and they are doing fine
---
It's not even like he's flexing that he accomplished something. Just showing how it's interesting statistically
---
There's also this handy command you do on your keyboard..... don't make excuses for this dude to whip out his potato and take a picture

Congrats!

Yikes

Yeah, praise the God that cried himself to sleep when everyone else was duking it out
---
She cheated on him 7 months ago. He went to a hoorhouse and banged two girls yesterday. 
---
She was controlling him with "delete all girls etc".
---
Im going to sleep, if its still not fixed when i wake up then ill report it. 
---
No idea, thats why i posted here for help. 
---
Wtf I happening lol 
---
Did you have a Authenticator and 2 step verification on your email? Just having a bank pin isn’t enough.
---
The wise old man sorts your not needed quest items out

I got 99 and didn’t even get the photo boots mate. Doing better than me hahah!

I think that Herblore should be F2P.   But Slayer is OK if instead of Herblore.

Why is he streaming this lol

What World is it in?

Absolutely

Only support if it is a ocarina instead of an harmonica.

Unless they can get to a chair and have taken the courses to help themselves (self taught with books). Then you have to play through the fire and flames on expert and any mistakes breaks a rib making you choke faster.
---
I'm happy that he's looking for karambwans in this thumbnail 
---
You cant retroactively convict tho
---
god dman it im playing rs3 for dxpw
---
Would that be the same outcome with an acb over a blowpipe? Appreciate you helping!
---
Aww, you can tell they're perfect for each other :3 Both are cheaters and are still together

Some people don't have any common sense unfortunately

'I am the nicest guy in the world' if you ever have to say that, you are far from nice.

Yeah obbys are just cosmetic accounts at this point. There are some cool one's though, like Che Che has champions cape at 48 cb

he's showing intense restraint

Just kill vorkath for one hour lmao
---
Dovydas, is that you?
---
Watching it now, he touches her i'll be the first on the phone with law enforcement. I have enough information from past streams to know his police district.  
---
To be clear, this is not swatting. It will be a house call by an on duty officer for a legitimate domestic violence concern.

Meet A Friend, my Red Light District locked Hardcore Ironman. After recently impregnating my gf I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No loyalty, no trust, but this time I can't leave Netherland because of my pregnant girlfriend. All leading up to eventually taking on one of life's biggest challenges: taking care of another mans child.
---
Or you could've downloaded runelite from one of the phishing sites which masquerade as the official site 
---
346 Used to be the rooftop agility world, idk why they changed it
---
What’s with Runescape subs and calling new players “cute”? These are adults and grown men you are calling cute and it’s fucking weird. 
---
what a fucking scumbag “i’ll call the police if you touch my ethernet cable” imagine being that addicted 
---
Share how you did it fuckkkkk, Im so tired of being BROKE. Took me a good 2 weeks to make 1m, saving for a fury.
---
this post made me physically ill
---
I've seen you copy paste this to dozen other people, how about YOU provide some compelling reason and try to persuade me? Jagex do some really dumb shit, just because they say something doesn't mean I think it should be included....
---
Well then hurry up and get over that rope, you're not allowed to be on that side
---
If your Internet traffic is managed by your apartment block I'd say use a VPN for any and all traffic. That shit's creepy af.

Wow air runes are expensive these days.

Kill brutal black dragons instead of kbd! You’ll make more money

Haven't played for over a decade,  started up 2 weeks ago and am ready to take on elvarg, might go members after that
---
I'd be sick of hearing that voische too
---
Yeah, control in making it more fake. You have hundreds of 'We broke up :(' videos on yt with millions of views. 
---
No it doesn't, it's just a subdomain.
---

Risky move

You're doing great! I think?

Print screen button my guy

I got Torag platelets immediately after posting my comment. I think I need to complain more 🧐

I love you both

Theres no girls on the internet

ots stars and planets... on dark mode it looks like space

I support the decision to ban this dude from twitch for faking drama on stream, thats for sure. First selling out to gambling sites, then this... JFC
---
And i love Dovydas
---
Haha holy shit what the fuck is going on in his stream
---
Nice job stealing someone else's comment
---
so it's a swat

Minimal impact on xp rates, just saves some gp

wait yeah, shit

If you bought bonds in game with coins, you need to convert them and pay 10% of their value in coins to make them tradable between accounts again. 
---
If you bought bonds with IRL currency and they are in the wrong game (rs3 or osrs). Contact Jagex billing support and explain the situation.

A bad breakup

---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
But all they're doing is bickering? Calm down, white knight. Yikes..
---
yaaa this is pretty fucked up. regardless of who's at fault, he should not be broadcasting it. he should say "hold on stream I'll be back, and cut it off"
---
All jokes aside, real life &gt; RuneScape. He sounds like an addict
---
j
---
So you here to talk about why you're wrong?
---
brainlet memes &gt; normie porn
---
yikes x3
---
Honestly wouldn't be half shocked if this is all a stunt to get subs/donations. 
---
And me?
---
Bruh they are both trash people lmfaoo.
---
She's supposedly an abusive person according to A Friend
---
and hes an immature person w no spine who decided to put his personal shit on the spotlight. Like holy shit they are both absolute train wrecks as people
---
Shiet u mite b rite 
---
What are their names? For banning purposes?
---
A friend is a piece of shit on stream .. its absolutely pathetic and I hope he gets banned
---
Didnt even see that, but this was spammed for 1 hour straight on his stream. That's where I got it from
---
lul drop the user name in the comments fam 
---
Not sure if upvoting your post will help but I did it anyway.
---
Sure you too
---
I know I have to grind for barrows... what about some of those other items? Are they traceable?
---
True that jagex states to ignore the change request if it was not you.
---
Now you need 1 day from 1 to 2. I think it was a nice tradeoff but making it heavily afk was a bad move by jagex
---
i will give you three fiddy for all the accounts nothing more!
---
G
---
Yes!
---
Looks like you got Reddit behind you, so you'll be fine.
---
If you don't have Reddit Upvotes or a large Twitter following, you're fucked.
---
Yea wtf us that stream
---
ALSO ADD HORSES
---
Please find the nearest fire and nature runes and alch yourself. Jesus christ that was the most fedora wearing neckbeard shit I've ever read my whole life. 
---
Holy shit i need to see this, is there anyway to rewatch it?
---
Thanks for being a dick, in advance
---
Drop the shitty seeds, and from now on when you open seed packs turn on bank fillers then deposit all and drop the shitty seeds again
---
&gt;They only get leaked by using them on different websites.
---
Which a massive amount of people do. 
---
I doubt it's just coincidental that the amount of "I've been hacked" posts has been higher than normal over the last handful of months after a huge leak happened.
---
Guys I gave someone my money. He said he would double it and the. He took it. He’s a big liar. Can I make him give my money back???
---
Ahh totally forgot to check on mobile, thanks again tho fam
---
New Afriend drama? Where can I find this? 
---
A dysfunctional relationship reaching breaking point, live on stream.
---
Did you take this through a screen door or something?
---
Wow, I don't know even half of these countries existed until now.
---
no its real ads would never lie to you.. SIKE!
---
Check with the people who manage your Internet if the domain or port (43594 AFAIK) is blocked
---
Imagine being this triggered by a joke between two people. You ok, man? Who hurt you?
---
i love how this guy's viewer/follower count shot up, wholesome boys
---
99 str req. you’re not the chosen king, you’re just really fucking strong 
---
I hate it for pking. I reg play with chat closed and when chat is open, I see lower fps. Having to close it is just a nuisance when you're suddenly in a fight.
---
WISH I COULD'VE GONE WITH RYAN ON THAT COOL RETREAT!
---
Grats!
---
You can 1 tick people your level from full
---
im at night auditor at a hotel. So i work overnight i do like 3hrs of work and the rest is customer service but no one shows up from 2am-5am so i get to have some fun
---
"I'll just finish this clue and then I'll end the stream"
---
Congrats man! You got the pet?
---
 Congratulations! That is a decent chunk of change to get you going. 
---
What happend to him?
---
**back by popular demand!**
---
Tonight at the blue moon inn I’ll be hosting a joke contest. Participants will tell one joke each, ill pick the best two for a final joke off, and the crowd votes for a final winner who gets 1m gp!
---
**If you weren’t there last time here’s the rules:**
---
When I call your name step up next to me near the bar and tell one joke. Any jokes told out of turn won’t be counted.
---
Everyone will get a turn to say their joke so keep the chat to a lol or haha when other people are doing theirs. Just so we all get a chance to type a setup and punchline.
---
If you want to tell a joke talk to me in game before the show, simple as that! Also if you just wanna hear some jokes come out and help vote for a winner.
---
After the contest we tell some more jokes and drink some beer. Thanks to everyone who came last time and gave me a donation! They’re always appreciated. Last time we had a matching donor so the winner of the contest got another 1m gp on top of the prize money!
---
If you have any suggestions, especially if you came to the last one, reply to this and let me know.
---
East green dragons have 5+ bots with 100+ combat on every world. Revs, chins and some shops are full of venezuelans farming gold to RWT. Jagex doesn't care.
---
I did it for a couple hours and made about 2m.  But people bot so they are on 24/7. Fuckin bullshit man.  
---
Moms credit card. XD bossing with my clan allowed me to get some income and rev cave luck
---
it’s based on a lot of skills, not just firemaking 
---
Can I see a pic of the stats? I’m just curious 
---
What the fuck was he doing? Did he have another window open or something? ￼
---
Is that really worth it? If you even save any, you'll barely go even plus risk for ban
---
me and my arm are on talking terms getting better
---
YO WTF
---
D 
---
Wtf is going on holy shit, this is so fucking fun lmafo
---
Immortal golem mommy
---
thanks im like nervous feels like im going on a first date 
---
She told the police he hit her. Disgusting behaviour.
---
Thanks! Sadly no pet, maybe in the future though :)
---
Same, idk if you know where Greensburg is but I’m like 20 mins south from that, only thing we have is shitty weather
---
well that was something..
---
hell yeah! theyre trash! let me boot up and get some screens
---
you need to make friends with both arms dont be mean 
---
The police just showed up at his house 3 mins ago and the stream ended
---
This is a stretch to say the least. 
---
My manhood doesn’t seam to care though. 
---
nope, your feet very small
---
what a shame
---
she says he physically hurt her... wow this woman is crazy manipulative
---
ikr
---
It's a joke about how a friend has been streaming this clue step for hours but hes just bank standing and doing some kinda fake ass drama stream with his gf
---
That is not my email lol. That is a fake email the phisher used
---
Well good thing we live in 2019 and the entire argument was all while he was stationary in a chair streaming lmao.
---
i hate the grind of it!! but i do MLM so i might switch to iron 3tick method
---
Holy shit man, that's awful.  Best of luck to you.
---
Who is "she"? For those of us not watching a stream.
---
Just looked it up.  Guardians can mage but their magic level is one so it can only do 1 damage and they usually melee.
---
The walkers attack with crush based melee, leeches with slash based melee, and guardians with stab based melee.
---
what a dumb bitch, telling cops that dovy hit her...
---
He needed 700$ realllllly badly
---
Quirky enough to be a clue reward. I love it.
---
So i dont really understand mlm. The wiki says the sack limit is 81, but I can put 84 (3 full inv) in it. So am i losing 3 pay dirts when I put in 84?
---
Damn she called the cops and said he physically abused her.
---
He straight up lied to the officer that he wasn't recording anything while streaming to 17k people.
---
Hey it's me a friend, i just came back from smacking some bitches.
---
Then he lied about the stream to the cop... He should have said yes it's all recorded and you can watch the replay. But if he was smart none of this would be happening LUL
---
I did reported it in game. Found while doing dragon slayer 2.
---
Who is he speaking to over voice chat?
---
crazy bitch
---
His now-ex girlfriend
---
I hope someone has the vod before his gf deletes it.
---
In before nerf. 
---
Barely a she, his ogre of a "gf". 
---
He'll be fine, she told them he physically abused her yet he's got the whole 3 hours or so worth of footage to disprove everything she's said. She'll be in big trouble. 
---
smorc 
---
His girlfriend, he broke up with her yesterday and was badmouthing her on stream. 
---
i was going to do the same but then i realized how easy Zeah favours can be 
---
Dawn tha' hill
---
Jan has plastic boobs
---
How many red flags does he need before he leaves her behind completely...
---
gay mods stop white knighting and banning
---
Great rng! All in the wrong places
---
Olmlet though
---
I think he mentioned earlier that he didn't save any clips.
---
Well, that was the most intense OSRS stream I've ever seen. What a ride. I hope he gets out of that shitty situation somehow.
---
It all seemed so staged at first, I was sure he was doing it for attention. But now I have my doubts.. That was a real Dutch police officer.
---
Honestly this whole situation is uncomfortable and shouldn't be put on stream. I hope he was able to save the whole cast because she made false claims to the police that he was physical with her. What the heck. 
---
who can be this fucking stupid? everything that has happened today is on fucking film via twitch. god fucking damn
---
That slut should get hiv
---
Grats!!
---
Haha i saw you wcing before nice job :D 
---
She got some mental issues bruh.
---
It's not fake lol she called the cops, unless they are the best actors in the planet
---
