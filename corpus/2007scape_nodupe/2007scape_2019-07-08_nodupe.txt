I agree but I also propose we add an option to keep levelling your max HP by 1 for every $1 you spend. So if I want 250hp for Inferno I just drop $250 in runebucks and BAM.

His understanding of economics is just fine. If Jagex's customers are willing to pay $11/month, that means that they get at least $11 worth of enjoyment out of their membership. 
---

---
Also, you do support Jagex through using bonds. Someone, somewhere is paying real-life currency for them which you then buy on the GE.
---
Do you ever hit it on ceiling fans?
---
Yes
---
It just helps you escape pkers at rev caves. Most people don't have 85+ agil.

I think a mini quest would be good but not a full blown quest. The QP cape shouldnt be locked by those who complete raids/inferno imo. Unless the cape was seriously op.

Theres no law for company held competitions. By entering the competition, you are agreeing to their terms and conditions, which is essentially a legally binding contract. These conditions can be whatever they want, and they don't have to pay you a fucking penny for any reason whatsoever. You would have absolutely no legal ground to stand on, and would be laughed at. It's a competition, not the lottery.

It can be pretty rough depending on the team but overall it's pretty fun.
---
Couple tips:
---
Attacker is where I see the most lost points. Pay attention to what's called. It's easy to just miss the new call and keep using the wrong attack style or arrow.
---
Defender can be complicated. You have to drop the correct food to lure the runners to traps. There is a specific strategy that makes it pretty easy.  Drop a bunch of good food right next to the trap, 1 bad food a bit further away, and a bunch of good food near the spawns. [here's a map that shows it](https://imgur.com/lhLk1ph) and you can [read the Barbarian Assault strategy page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barbarian_Assault/Strategies) to get a better idea of it all.

Stop paying Jagex and they shut down the game... it's a cash cow business at this point. All cash cow businesses wind up closed eventually, let's go expedite the process.
---
Black cavaliers were a consistent 900k-1m, the other colors weren't much. White/black berets were around 200k but actually increased shortly after the GE was introduced, and then were consistently around 500k. Elegant clothing, mostly black/purple/white held it's value as well. The emote gear like flared pants and sleeping cap. Gnome scarf was like 1m. All of the God trimmed, gold trimmed, and gilded rune armor were pretty expensive, at least compared to what they are in old school.
---
I PK all the time on the BH world and I do fine, there's a few douches that rush all the time but you figure out who they are and skip them right away. It all depends on your combat bracket.
---
Thanks 5150!

I doubt there would have been a dime going to the developers, considering Runescape has hit record profits and this is still their pay.
---
Gz! I‚Äôve never gotten a rare, valuable drop. Sad boi.
---
what?
---
One inventory space to bank 3-7 dragon bones would be totally worth the inventory spot. Few monsters fill your inventory with drops that would be of higher GP value, especially ones that drop bones worth taking

I was about to rant about this, but I did some digging and do think this needs to be pointed out for context. The average wage for the UK is around 22K GBP. At around a +8000 GBP difference, this is already doing better than half of the people and is almost double the minimum. This is not an affordable wage for a family of four in the UK (about 2307/mo. according to Numbeo without rent) but for a single person, this is more than affordable at 675/mo. before rent and a rent of around 1035/mo. for a 1 bedroom apartment in the city center. At 30k/yr. you have 2,500 (before taxes) to spend which means a single person can rent a 1 bedroom apartment for 1035 and living on an average expenditure rate of 675 there is a leftover of  790 per month. This is good by all standards at this pay. I am lucky to have $300/mo. leftover for similar circumstances and I make almost as much in an area that's just as expensive for example. Granted, this is all Numbeo based and can vary, but for a single person, they're not hurting as bad as it might seem. Needless to say, they're developers and it's not a job that should pay so low, but this IS in line with developer pay for the UK. I still do think they deserve more, but I'd say that about all British developers earning such a low wage compared to other areas. Not even going to get into the business earnings, if you can't afford to pay your people, you're not responsible enough and don't deserve to have a business. Period.

Inflate deez nuts and adjust your mouth around them nerd.

You just have to push through and grind something out then you realize it‚Äôs not so hard. Once you‚Äôve got a couple grinds out of the way (barrows gloves, torso, defender, or void) you can start bossing/pking and have an advantage. That‚Äôs when the game starts really becoming fun imo.

Start out F2P and see how you like the game. You'll likely see a lot of bots and you'll struggle to make enough gold to buy membership in F2P, but it's a good way to get a feel for the game and decide if you want membership (which is where all the fun/good content is)

It wasn't first dmm tournament.

The fact that you guys are still going on about this shit is beyond disappointing.
---
It‚Äôs over. Continuing to be butthurt about getting our way is childish and a clear indication we aren‚Äôt deserving of polling
---
Jagex got sold to new owners. It‚Äôs the corporate big wigs that want to go full profits. 
---
The proposition if it stayed exactly how they proposed wasn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs the fear that people have of what it could become that got everyone scared and voicing their opinion.
---
thanks my dude
---
But at what point is it just greed? Why do corporations have to double profits every year just to ruin something they had going GOOD for them. I know this isn't just OSRS it's a majority of company's. And we shouldn't let things we enjoy go to garbage because someone wants more digits in this bank account. It's absurd to be like "yea you know what, fuck everything and just increase value" 
---
Again, why rs went to shit in the first place. Greed from jagex. 
---
Again.. the devs get paid 30-35k a year? Mate I started at a cheese factory my first job and made the same . It's hard to understand these reasonings
---
Absolutely! It could have been large lamps. :(
---
What would that do?
---
Let me make it into a shield for you.
---
I canceled my runescape membership last night, just not playing enough to justify paying for it in my opinion. I plan on coming back eventually, I've just gotten bored after hitting 99 fishing, cooking and woodcutting.
---
However I know I'll play F2P whenever I get that itch (I grinded a ton of fishing levels by powerfishing) but I'm wondering what I should even be doing. Here are my levels:  https://imgur.com/nqNbH8k

Definitely prefer skilling to combat, maybe F2P is just a waste of time tho and I should just wait til I get the urge to try a new skill out seriously.

What SCP is this?

Yea, like they‚Äôre going to start pushing nudes of RS characters into the community üôÑ

This happened to me today

That's the other option I was thinking of, just going for the slowest/cheapest 99 crafting possible.
---
Get and assembler, get rigour and augury, get anguish, upgrade over time to ancestral 1st then to get a sang staff, finally arma. Sell it all and get tbow, restart build.
---
Stealing silk at 52 thieving???
---
No. You do most of your damage with mage so the mage damage bonus should get priority over range. Anguish would be a good upgrade but I don't think you should sell tormented for it
---
Guards were on a madness, managed to find an afkable method with silk
---
There's no level requirements to get there and explore the island.

Always love your style. Still bummed I've no money for your RS3 Tarot

No online game lasts forever MTX or not. It's not worth overthinking it. Just enjoy the ride. 
---
*On a side note* in regards to your last paragraph private servers already exist but obviously will never be endorsed by Jagex so that option already does exist for you if you really wanted to host your own server.

Make $40k a year in Arkansas as a construction worker and own your own 3 bedroom home by the time you're 30: "Flyover country, just a bunch of uneducated inbred hicks with no culture"

That said, i played a Demon Hunter tank spec, i was quite literally unkillable so there was no point in trying to fight.

what am i supposed to beat my meat to now?

Mmm, I'd argue that this is a better crush weapon than LB Baxe, as it is only -2crush attack and -22str, but has 1 tick faster attack speed. 22str is prob like 5 max hit, but hitting 1 extra time in 5 hits it's a big advantage. Especially when calculating DPS without overkill xp. Idk tho, someone will do the math.

you can get ok crafting exp doing green dhide bodies if you have a bunch of money laying around. could dropmine iron. other than that i wouldn't really bother with anything in f2p with those stats.

This is exactly why the MTX business model works so well. It doesn't matter is 99% of players don't buy MTX or spend a small amount, because a very small amount of players will spend tens of thousands on it. [Here's another person spending $13K on rs3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjtZGjI29Qc) That one player makes them as much money as 1000 osrs players.
---
How is this sensible in any way? If you actually read the blog post on partnerships, the goal wasn't to make money directly through partnership, it was about attracting new players. The Twitch skin promotion for example was huge advertisement for the game and, per Jagex's statement, was highly successful at bringing in new players. Partnerships with OSRS Youtubers with audiences that already know about the game and most likely already play wouldn't attract anyone.

My idea of runescape isn't to get to the end, it's about having fun along the way. Otherwise you could just go on eBay or somewhere and buy a maxxed account.

Experience from industry internships, or, like in my case, relevant research experience. Plus the job market for CS is really good right now.

You've heard incorrectly. Cambridge does not have a high cost of living. Average salary is close to ¬£25,000 ($31k).

It's still a repost tho. It's been done

AFK skilling is still grinding, so I don't agree with you.

Its the same account o.o membership is the same
---
Was this vid specifically for OSRS or did we adopt it from something else?
---
Out of luck pay more attention next time
---
Yes, that is a good suggestion! :)
---
Yeah but Glassdoor is pretty unreliable as I don't think they do anything to verify salaries/reviews. I could just make one up right now for Jagex to make it look like the devs are paid terribly.
---
Could go for max, but I think I'll just go for 200m herblore.
---
Yes, that also males sense!
---
That doesn't make sense at all. Almost everything polled was clearly targeted at veteran players. How does redesigning houses (a skill that requires membership) or new emotes appeal to new players when construction is nowhere near an early game skill. The twitch thing makes sense because you're giving new players access to the full game and if they enjoy it they will feel more inclined to pay for another month.  This was clearly an attempted cash grab by Jagex.

i don't think this is a bad idea, but i also think that is reasonable for a video game development company to not put a bunch of eggs in the merch basket. making tasteful video game merch that is actually buyable/wearable is hard. they also just might not want to really get into the weeds of what it takes to seriously sell clothing at scale because they are, again, a video game dev company at their core.

Powermining iron is perfect, I can't believe I didn't think about it. Thanks!

All dope minus the Christmas lights at the top.

Of course the interns and 1 year devs will get 30k. they are fresh out of education with no experience. The new devs, like everyone else in the world, need to develop a skillset that makes them a valuable employee and not easily replaceable in order to "EARN" more than 30k. The latest Jmods seem to be college recruits and this is basic business.
---
This simply is not true. Game development pays well.

i need to learn those things im really not creative or smart to those, ive got a way to money kinda of thought, but havent made much of it since i stoped paying the overpriced membership, thanks for helping with the ideas thought.

Just pray flick. I dont get people who afk the game literally 100% of the time every day lol. Whats the point in playing. im always watching youtube or something on the side, but i got into the habit of pray flicking everything early on just cause i wanted speedier results and faster training.

Saves p pots. Faster tasks. Always go str bonus unless bossing where def is needed :).

Also wasnt saying that you afk only lol just meant that as a general statement. Pray flicking is a good habit to get into though.

he liks the dev, he wanta dev to get fair wage, you suggest to stop playing the game the dev works so hard and pour his passion on? so the dev is gonna end up fired with the project of is life close? thats for sure a great suggestion to help your favorite developper

Osrs has always been a side game for me. I‚Äôm almost 2200 total now and I‚Äôve afkd quite a lot. Only recently, maybe the last 5 months has osrs moved toward being my main focus game, but it‚Äôs kinda weird you can‚Äôt fathom the appeal to want to afk stuff like blood velds lol. Shit tasks aren‚Äôt fun. I‚Äôd much rather have my focus elsewhere than sitting there 1 tick flicking blood velds for 30-45 minutes for no reward besides mediocre xp. ‚ÄúWhat is the point of getting skills lol. To just flex and show them off?‚Äù Uhhh? What is the point of skills? The literal only point of most skills is just personal satisfaction from you sense of accomplishment no? 2 people have a mining cape, nobody knows that one guy did mlm and the other did 3t4g lol.

\[Tinfoil Hat\]: They have previously said that they will never add anything the players were against in response to a previous MTX scare. I don't remember which blog it was but the response was along those lines. They are bringing in mom's credit card warriors and are going to use them to introduce MTX. Which is hilarious because those types of players will make the game less sustainable in the long run. Jantleflux seems to have learned nothing.
---
^(But this doesn't matter because we all know Oldschool Oldschool Runescape will be a thing and we will all be suckered right back into clicking on a 20 year old game for thousands more hours.)
---
Torstols give quite a bit of xp per run, probably between a full tree run of maples and yews
---
Yea burn out is a real thing. No need to force yourself to play rs. Go do something else in life until you have a desire to play more runescape.
---
Reminder that jagex aleady turned over millions in profit last year.

Jagex don't need huge growth, it's probably a push from the CEO's. I'm just throwing out other options in an area I consider lackluster.

Go start a business and then have your consumers try and tell you how to run it. If enough people actually leave instead of complaining, things will change.

Okay I can agree with that. But how much? I‚Äôm sure if I was a dev there I would be happy with $1,000,000,000 per year, and I‚Äôm sure the company would like to spend $1 per year on me, but there is a middle ground, so yeah

Then that beloved Firecape, after 17 attempts because I'm awful at this game.

I'm having the time of my life playing this game. But I tell you, my favorite moment in my history of Runescape, the one that I can't believe I finally got to do?
---
I walked through that fucking gate at Taverly and roamed around for ten hours. I finally got to see that freaking waterfall I'd seen on the world map for 14 years.
---
They have raised the membership prices every 3 years so far...
---
Could you explore down there at all? üòÇ Anything in the chests?
---
Well the beauty of the internet is you can insult people‚Äôs morality all you want - anonymously!

This isn't a QoL recommendation

I‚Äôm just proud it‚Äôs not a fast/easyfirst 99

Rs3 still makes more money than osrs so if you are that desperate for mtx full blown in osrs... yeah sure!
---
he obvioulsy asked for tips about using the account effectively as built.
---
If you think grinding 300 green drags is too time consuming, I wish you luck on your future osrs endeavors
---
They need as many employees as possible working on MTX content for deadscape3
---
This subreddit is pretty easy to throw up pitchforks when efficiency is brought up.
---
You should find a subtle way to hide crabs into it that you can reveal if/when they choose it
---
I'll be sure to vote yes again the next time mtx comes around. Though I'll bust a fat nut if jagex decides to force mtx down your guys throat regardless of what you want. :)
---
This gonna be a trend for a week? If so I‚Äôm down
---
I had this happen, I told then it was disappointing and insulting. I left quickly after. He was fully aware of what type of raise I expected and I fucking worked my ass off to show I was worth that much since the moment I started there.
---
Current company gave me more than I asked and ahead of schedule, both my schedule and corporate's normal review cycle.
---
I'm hoping you're in a position to find a company that respects their employees.
---
Using runelite?
---
The pets are still OP, no other pet has any effects, boosts like that should go in an item slot. Just make them cosmetic, they look great
---
Lmao ¬£30k in Cambridge?
---
Top kek.
---
This is horrible, I hate &amp; love you at the same time.
---
Bring in new players, got it.
---
Damn, a true og here.
---
&gt;seems like effort for nothing 
---
bro
---
do u know what sub ur in
---
I think a lot of people that are upset are from the US. No insane 100-200k/year wages here in EU, but you don't have to pay for medical bills and in many countries the tution fees are not high at all or free.
---
got it at 267 kills, feels good man
---
I have gp to buy bonds I'm not asking for anything free only for what I've already grinded my noob booty off for and bought with gp.
---
How do I make Konar my gf
---
Seems like you are taking a lot of damage at only 350~ hp. I'd say just keep practicing rotations, you'll get it. You should really only be taking damage from snakelings, occassionally mage phase and when you mess up on jad phase or poison clouds. You definitely can do it with that setup, keep trying!!
---
Well when they have like 1 guy for working on the engine, then claim a lot of updates can't be done because of engine work. Then, more devs == better.
---
&gt;using video guides

&gt;asking the subreddit instead of looking on the wiki

Jeez you're helpless

Anyway he doesn't show you because you literally just use whatever bolts you have. It's an endgame quest so bring good bolts.

10% is a REALLY good return on investment in the business world
---
I'm not in the business world but my knowledge of interest rates at banks is somewhat solid
---
Oh wow I'm retarded, but to be fair that is also retarded
---
That's crazy dude. I'm a fresh college grad in America and I'm making 85k as a technical consultant in a pretty low cost of living area, but it's still technically up in the air where I'll exactly be
---
I do a review and salary for every job I have on there. It only helps people get paid more and know what to expect, and that helps the company by keeping turnover rate down.
---
Diamond are fine for all the fights up til galvek, then use ruby til like 250 hp
---
Half meme half truth
---
99 str but lvl 2 shotgun

Grats!!!!!

There‚Äôs a lot of circumstantial evidence including:
---
MMK leaving before securing a new job
---
Every Glassdoor review
---
Ayiza not being able to afford living close by
---
Historical salary postings.
---
It‚Äôs not that we know 100% that it‚Äôs true.  We don‚Äôt know that all the evidence is good.  But we do know that there is at least a decent bit of evidence backing up the rumor and virtually none disputing it.
---
Zmi is better exp
---
Yeah I'll play ososrs. I can't wait to grind rc again
---
Except Jagex didn't fuck up. He was disqualified fair and square, and the only reason people don't agree is because they have some weird hero worship for him.
---
Ash decided to pay 10k to appease a retarded community.
---
I'm saying to lie on glassdoor about their salary. Did you read my comment? Alledegly posting false info on glassdoor isn't the game
---
Dang, if any OSRS Devs want to come to Philadelphia, I'll help find you a gig. With the amount of pleasure (and sadness from losing DDS/Whip duels) I'd be happy to help anyway I can.
---
It really is great med level and ironman content, not game breaking but fits nicely with everything else. I feel like it‚Äôs being overlooked with the partnership drama going on but it‚Äôs certainly a job well done
---
Took me 2 hours. :(
---
Is there a reason you got 60 pray? I'm also a 75 attack zerk but I'm currently 52 pray. Thinking about getting 100 combat tho.
---
Amazon Jogre Slaying challenge
---
Gordon Ramsey's gnome restaurant challenge
---
College ain't free in the UK.
---
Most pure clans are 1-5 def but I think 13 def is cool. Just keep your attack either 50 or 60 and you‚Äôll still be really effective. 
---
I have a maxed 10 def pure and my only regret is getting higher attack bc I only fight zerks now. Also, slayer helm is the shit. Gl have fun :)
---
His foot is on the dropped plate. 0 fucks.
---
Can we put money towards an actual fucking customer support team while we're at it?
---
Are you paying money to get something ingame? Yes, you are. You may claim, oh, but Jagex isn't getting that money. But yes, they are.
---
Twitch will promote them more, which is advertising, which costs money.
---
In a roundabout way, they are getting you to give them money for an ingame cosmetic. It's a sneaky MTX and we should stand together and make it clear it's unacceptable.
---
[oops sorry](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/EMNDZC3)

Staff-less fairy rings is a pretty good upgrade. Diary is the most fitting unlock for it atm. I wouldn't be opposed to it being locked behind a quest with hard requirements. But those hard requirements should be *near* elite lumbridge tier
---
It's easier if you solve it in a certain pattern. You get the first row right then move down 1 row and get that one right. Once you are down to the final 2 rows you want to start solving both rows together from left to right. It takes a little time and practice but it's not too difficult.
---
I like it, can complete more clues, more afking with prayer. You can get either 80 attack or 65 pray if you want 100. I will go 99
---
Body pillow
---
For sure. And its yeah is like 60% iron update but normal players can utilize it very well. Nice zeah update too. Really cant complain unless you are a pvp only or semi maxed player :P
---
Ok, will do and thank you :)
---
? In osrs maxing is like 90% of the time consuming things in the game, unless u mean max combat only lol
---
PC principal gets 99 hp
---
Thanks for the explanation on this!
---
I'm about to do the boss fight and have my (e) bolts ready, so thank you :)
---
If they really wanted something like that, a patreon page or a gofundme type thing would be much more logical..
---
50/50
---
No just tired.
---
Yeah like blizzard has been doing for millions of wow players for years at $15/month, but better because they service more people and that $15 buys you multiple accounts.
---
haha what a retard
---
Yes looks like it
---
Well I guess it's great people like you don't speak out because you don't want to have devs feelings hurt. You're obviously not someone who cares about the games you play
---
Seriously, what kind of focus group could they put together to get tangible feedback?
---
Jagex: "Okay, you see this swampy area and its swampy walls?"
---
Focus group: "yes?"
---
J: "Now, and hear me out now, what if we let /you/ put that on the walls of your house?"
---
Fg: "that sounds like it would be a nic-"
---
J:"alright, we got their approval! Just tack the partnership delay at the end of the notes and we'll get this ball rolling!" 
---
Poll fails(cancelled), and a passive aggressive letter is put out. 
---
Honestly, if they had stopped the letter at "We hope that you continue to trust in the polling process, just as we do." It probably would have been received better. Then they could have, at a later date, put out a statement better explaining their position. 
---
They lost a lot of potential sympathy from the playerbase, because of that second half.
---
haha what a ret‚Äãard
---
Hard question to ask. The most common method is just farming zulrah but that's definitely mid-late game PvM content. Nets &gt;1.5m/hr
---
Top Pic seems to be from Nile Red's Ferrous Fluid creation video.
---
Just like irl nerd
---
I‚Äôm actually someone who plays the games I play for fun. The problem with multiplayer games is nerds like you who have nothing else so you mask obsessive protectionism over your ‚Äòthing‚Äô as you ‚Äòcaring‚Äô about the game. Ppl like you are the ultimate problem with multiplayer games and it‚Äôs why games you have to actually invest time in are dying. No one wants to be around you guys.
---
So an early pass which you pay money for to access content early doesn't count? ü§î
---
Maxed, average 1 min kills
---
Those two are devs doe.
---
Yo i know a kyle like this wtf
---
doesnt stack and it ticks down (-1) every 60s
---
As a new player in the mid-low levels I feel this hard lol
---
Price gouging necessities and pricing a video game a little higher are not relatable.
---
You can literally buy gold. Its pay2win.  
---
Partnerships were all time-delayed cosmetics at worst. Who gives a shit if someone gets a new type of wall in their house a month early for some real money? 
---
How is that worse than getting 99 construction a year early for real money?
---
Reddit doesnt ban for usernames
---
Keep making the great content you two....or else.

Imagine being this triggered

It wasn't one email and the passwords were all different.

If they were to release classic wow correctly (no invasive layering) id agree with that! No intrest in where the game or story are going on live.
---
Nope
---
Go get Ardy cape, work for a legends cape or try get a fire cape. If you can‚Äôt do any of that just buy an obsidian cape
---
Mean would be more representative, but the comment I replied to talked about the average.
---
Any 12-year old code is by default not "super easy to code"...
---
Which one? Isn‚Äôt there a few ?
---
I mean how about working on something good that people want? Just a thought.
---
They've stated in the past that the admin potato notifies mods if it's interacted with so I'd assume they just copied the code for other unachievable items.
---
&gt;Can do 25 med clues per hour though
---
Your original response assumed that is the norm though lol, which it is not.
---
Thats why I got those skills out of the way first.
---
You could watch a 15 minute java basic coding video on YouTube and youd be able to run your own runescape, with proper licensing of course.
---
You don't get to keep anything in life mate. The sooner you accept it the easier it is to enjoy.
---
if your not shooting for the firecape, try an obsidian cape. 
---
if your ballin and just going for fashion, team cape x, i, and zero are really cool. theres also the more expensive fashion ones like the cape of skulls. totally up to you.
---
Average doesn‚Äôt mean survivable.
---
75~ when osrs first came out, most recently got bgloves on 87 combat on a new acc, cause I've been lazy as hell and didn't feel like finishing it
---
please tell me this shit is going to be a trend here now whenever we hit 99s
---
Yeah that isn‚Äôt how that works, the entire purpose of any for-profit company is first and foremost to generate returns for investors. Anything else is secondary.
---
the fact that this is upvotes just proves what type of playerbase jagex is marketing towards, lol.
---
You have to take into account that servers cost a lot but I do think they should be paid a bit more
---
We have to choose between Konar and Nieve?
---
I mean the same applies for anything pures compete against zerkers at 88cmb but they are still pures lol.
---
I'm 5 year into QA (Win10 software) on 24.5K a year doing fine. Looking for a raise but did not expect 30K until around now
---
&gt;Show me where on the update blog this is at all remotely implied to happen.
---
RS3. 
---
&gt;Then show me where on the doll MTX touched you, because christ you're overreacting.
---
As sated above.
---
and therefor the company as well. welcome to business and economics for children what else did you realize today?
---
Yep exactly that lol
---
did they say this?
---
Majority of the player base hadn't even beat one boss in AQ by the time BC came out. People don't remember or realize just how intense it was to be a raider back then. Even now on private servers you see guilds spend up to an hour just getting required world buffs so they can eek put that extra damage needed to clear Nax. The prep time for some individual classes going into every raid week from AQ to Nax was multiple hours.
---
But I don't think we will see changes for some time I think Classic. The speed run community is alive and well for Vanila raising and dungeon running. Players who aren't hardcore but still enjloy the game will want to experience the raids as they were back then, and without changes.
---
You have to remember that Classic is being released as a strong and solid game without anything major missing from it. OSRS on release was a game far older than what most people actually wanted. Whether it was 2011 pre eoc or 2008 GE or skills like summoning or dungeoneering,  OSRS on release was not that game people really wanted so they got bored. OSRS was NOT a solid and strong game in 2007. Still early in development compared to its entire life cycle.
---
Nah they‚Äôre going to claim that they don‚Äôt have enough revenue to maintain the servers properly so that they can say partnerships would resolve the financial burden and are now a game integrity issue and put them into the game unpolled.
---
Mean = average 
---
Median is the better statistic to use
---
That‚Äôs a dishonest way to put it.
---
$50 million net profit?...
---
What? RuneScape is written in its own language, runescript, which is very difficult to use apparently
---
Great Big Puzzay
---
Lmao what
---
Pretty sure it's been around since the release of zeah
---
MMOs have never lasted, and we can only hope that OSRS can go so far, even when it learns from the mistakes RS3 made. Go to the gym or focus on your studies, religion (if applicable), whatever instead, as grinding those are completely in your control. On this game we're at the mercy of the chinese overlords fuck
---
Why elder maul over bludgeon? According to the dps calcs I did on day 1 bludgeon is about 10% more dps.

(Scythe is better but super costly)

muh sexism

smhing my smh btw

---
\*darkness\*
---
Or just use your house altar if you have one.
---
the learning curve for most of the game is more shallow than it has ever been, theres tons and tons of amazing resources to learn things, but even going in blind things have been made much easier than they used to be.
---
That is including London salaries, which drastically bloats the average. The median for full-time employees is ¬£27k.
---
That‚Äôs weird, because it does
---
At 88 cb the pure is still ok (75 99 1, with 99hp 52pray). 
---
The zerks there arent 99 str with 99hp yet.
---
Cabin fever for cave horrors.
---
If you dropped it, it would be obtained by others, therefore not changing the economy but just having new eco holders. If only a few players picked it all up it would Jack the price on alot of big items.
---
Definitely the ge made the game so much more practical and i loved it when it came in, i did like hopping around and buying rubies off all different people for different prices and on the forums, i had a massive collection then made ruby bolts (e) and made a complete killing.

The artists don't really work on content you play, not just look at. They work on the cosmetic side.
---
I think all the comments here are wrong -- the Wilderness sword slashes all webs everywhere (including outside the Wilderness), except this specific Forthos Dungeon one that is bugged.
---
Yup it's a different item with a different itemId. It cannot be sold on the GE. Only the sprite is the same.
---
Birdhouses my man
---
What do you think the role of artists are in Jagex? If they have no cosmetics to be working on do you think they are going to be working on the development side?
---
Elder maul was better on release when people were massing it. But solo I‚Äôd go the bludgeon hands down.
---
Bonds don't equal T bow, T bow equal T bow.
---
smhing my smh
---
Wow wow, no need to be rude man.  
---
As I already posted in previous comments, it wasn't on the wiki (until 8 minutes ago when the wiki was edited) and at this very moment I am at the Lesser Fanatic in Edgeville and he doesn't even speak of any web slashing rewards. So the only way I could know what the complete list of rewards were was by reading the wiki, where it **didn't** specify it should be in the wilderness only.
---
Pk other customers in the WIldy zones to get there tickets and cash them for prizes
---
Because it was edited like 8 minutes ago.
---
Okay mate but I think learning how to code a square box is slightly different to coding a MMO. 
---
But sure, send your cv through and I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt get back to you.
---
Oh gee, instead of putting the long awaited elven city there. 
---
Lets put a fucking Icy PvM boss there instead? Just so it doesn't "rip off RS3"
---
hopefully it doesn't get cancelled today then
---
Grinding mage training arena was so painful
---
RuneScape being shitty is part of RuneScape, trust me.
---
Are you wearing one of each of the gods items to stop them from all attacking you?
---
Bwuk.
---
I'm wearing a monk robe top and a Zamorak helmet but the Avansies keep attacking me
---
man i want someone to take a fat bong rip, chug a can of beer and then exhale after getting 99 cooking or something
---
Out of the loop here. What the hell boss is this?
---
If ur going for bossing you wanna get that def up. Ain't no one gonna take a pure bossing
---
Hey @ModHusky, Could you guys add the possibility to start an instanced fight by talking to a NPC there so Ironman can kill the big spider in peace too?
---
Okay, so to skip a task you can go to burthope and skip it with the slayer master there. 
---
Make sure you‚Äôre wearing a saradomin and Zamorak item. Maybe an aramadyl to be safe because you‚Äôre a noob. Then kill the saradomin rangers that are attacking hell hounds or some shit and you won‚Äôt take any damage, ez.
---
You missed one thing

Nice.

Salary is definitely below expected, even more so when you take into account that Jagex is based in Cambridge, and the price of living there can be comparable to London.
---
59 hunter? Get 60 and a heavy ballista already.
---
Ay thanks, this is a neat checklist to have
---
I don't and have not supported bonds. I don't like them, and the ability to pay real currency for in game money is gross.
---
The other side of the issue is without bonds you have (or still have, depending on outlook) rampant RWT issues. 
---
I work an hour a month so I don't have to work for multiple hours in game getting (3.5m x 2?) for a month of bonds and again, don't agree with them. 
---
They're in the game, the community seemed to want them, so what am I to do there.
---
The community does not want these latest actions, so here we are.
---
The childhood dream!
---
Yes.
---
Man you guys are all super friendly, thank you so much
---
I know this community can be mixed at times but I truly think this is one of the best ones for a game out there
---
You guys rock
---
You need an armadyl item to stop the avansies from attacking, and then a bandos item as well. If you have all 4 God items equipped nothing will attack you so you could then just do your task like normal with prayer or whatever you do
---
ARe you high? EA pay as low as $44k which lines up to ¬£35K, We dont have to pay out for private healthcare unless we choose too either. All keep in mind the gbp is very weak atm due to an unsure brexit and will only go back up once its sorted I mean shit I remeber when ¬£1 was $2, Came out to American and had a spending spree that year.
---
Just do the task.
---
Ge teleport with varrock tab is really nice tough
---
Fuck Pike
---
there are people that work with a passion (and next to no pay). just look at all the non-profit organizations. 
---
not everyones life is centred around money, just saying
---
Get a cheap armadyl item. You can get that pendant from the quest with Lucien i believe.
---
I enjoy it for Dag Supreme but might not be best spec weapon. Also is fantastic for yoinking points in CoX.
---
Best way to do it, imo, is to go to one of the god's room so that only those god's minions are there. For Spiritual Mages I use the Zamorak room. I just bring an Unholy Blessing with me so they're not aggressive and kill what I need. To get there, go to the dungeon, run north, jump the busted ice bridge. 
---
If you want to use the main area, just wear an item of each god.
---
Skipping like that will reset your task streak
---
What got moved?
---
Keep in mind that your slayer streak will reset to 0 if you take a task from the Burthorp master.
---
Slayer ring
---
Roughly 75 the last time i did it on my ironman
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I just got one of the rarest drops ever.
---
x5 Rune javelins = 1/82,739 (No ring of wealth)
---
x67 Nature runes = 1,4309
---
In the SAME drop
---
It has been done. I don't care about the streaks anymore
---
Nah he has a ridiculously stupid amount of quests just for his section
---
Ah.. I see. Well that is kind of unfortunate. Sometimes one of the fun or funny parts of RS in the past is showing up at a random crucial moment of another player's demise either during bosses or from other enemies (non-pvp) and being able to take their items, especially satisfying when it happens to a bot. 
---
But now it seems that is now limited to only in wildy. 
---
Yea.. I know. The reason for this change was because of DDos issues. I wonder if this is going to be a permanent change. 
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
yh but where is your dog at i wanna see him lol
---
Oh god yeh it's cheaper than London. That's not saying a lot though üòÇ
---
what should I improve?
---
Man you from the east side
---
I'm on 97 with 1 drop :(
---
He owns a bunch of shares which is how he isn‚Äôt piss poor. That‚Äôs how he managed to pay woox the $10k
---
Don't read it then
---
You just do solos and do 4 - 0???
---
Is there really? I wasn't aware. This is great.
---
Whip isn't a boss drop. There's a lot of weapons worse than whip but are worth more.
---
No. Nex.
---
fyi: zulrah is not as good a money maker as you make it out to be.
---
its great but not vortkath/ raids level of great. zulrah is just being botted and hence all her drops lost a lot of value since christmas.
---
Procedural gang.

I can‚Äôt get enough RPG III.

you forgot your humour tag

They might just only close the client when it updates. I know my pc only gets restarted once a week.
---
It's just a joke g
---
I think you have to log in with runelite for it to save. Not sure on that tho. Otherwise they don't close the client and get all the kills between updates
---
You can contact Jagex. I did the same thing and they transferred the bond over to the proper account. Took a few days, but I did get it resolved.

You can login with your Google account at the info pannel. This will make so the data gets stored and get synced at every login.

Doing this might reset all your settings though. There is a way around this but I don't know how.

Sure it‚Äôs a rude thing to do; however, I don‚Äôt think you should be banned for it.  I‚Äôve been crashed multiple times and I take it as a challenge to be better and gain better equipment so I can anti-crash.  I like the competitiveness to it.

Zerker is someone who keeps defence at 45, when you unlock berserker helm.  2k total level is just a high total level.

If any of you guys are interested the original songs on that vid are 'upbeat anthem' by naughty by nature, it then changes to 'feuer frei' by rammstein when the dharoks comes in.

Jagex, like any company with investors, is an insatiable profit machine, that somehow has convinced its own customers that it needs more money despite record profits, only hiring 10 devs for OSRS and hiring a metric fuck-all for support staff.

Truly ladies and gentlemen, this is a masterclass in greed.

I'd say it'd be more attitude/demeanor/how they present themselves, over popularity.

Yeah and in return for driving customers their way I'm pretty sure Jagex gets repaid in some other way than simply hoping it keeps members subscribed.  They said they wont waste dev time/money on those house styles in previous announcements, but they would if the partnerships pass.  Likely because they will be getting more money to put towards it.  
---
You really think Jagex gets nothing other than "a good reason to stay subscribed" out of partnerships?  lol

Genuinely, why?

For a lower level zerk pure with 84 magic/range, Zulrah feels like there's a really small margin of error.  When I've tried my attempts (6 so far) I always run out of food when Zulrah has more than half health left, and I'm not sure how much of it is just me messing up.

High total levels on pures/zerkers are generally impressive because they limit their attack, defense, and prayer. In this guy's case, he would probably be 2100 total if he was a main.

Seniors are 35k + starting - in Cambridge this is low, granted I don't know the specifics of how the market is effected for gaming, but senior web/design developers at the Uni of Cambridge have a base salary of ¬£54k

and my experience is that the University pays well but not private sector well - at least in lower entry requirement positions, I would assume this translates higher up.

I think on my main in RS2 I finished it for the first time at about 105-110 combat. I think I was level 62 when I went to do it on my zerker last year.

I've noticed that unless someone writes up the guide on reddit, there are basically no "guides" covering OSRS.  Which is a shame, because like you, it is sometimes more convenient to skim through to find exactly what you're looking for instead of listening to 60 seconds of intro's of YT videos.

This is not a dating site

Ya it's never changing back. Many people have suggested having to pay to reclaim your items. The idea would be you pay a percentage based on the value of the items you lost. This keeps it somewhat fair for people who don't have as much gp. The old death mechanic was a healthy item sink. The new method would act as a needed gold sink.
---
Use overloads instead man

how does a poisonous or not poisonous spider in any way shape of form make your gaming experience worse? i see no issue at all here.

if you dont care for the game as much as i do thats totally fine. but i have a right to voice my opinion when it comes to lore issues.
---
Okay I'm just going to go down the list as I read things.
---
Your stats aren't amazing, that will really limit you.
---
Bouncer has high defense (I think? been a while, maybe it was just high attack stats).
---
Use overloads, not supercombat potions. You can boost your xp a bit more by using prayer (in this case a high prayer bonus may be useful).
---
Ditch the full dragon, no reason to use it if you want better XP, you want all of the strength bonus you can get. Have you tried obsidian with SS? Do you have a dragon defender? Can you afford abby dagger? use Gmaul for spec.

No it's an mmo, not a single player game. You don't get an NPC to yourself guaranteed 100% of the time. Drops wouldn't be worth shit

That awkward moment when someone is so slow that they accuse someone of blatant racism, and when they call you out on it you crawl away like a fucking pussy.

The picture you linked is total amount of untrimmed capes in the game and not unique accounts with an untrimmed cape. I personally have 6 of my untrimmed cape which artificially inflates the number.

I believe you mentioned that an option to have a private instance would come later just like KDB and the Kraken have. I‚Äôm always worried that some greedy high level will come in and take the kill as they‚Äôve done several times after I spec the boss.

So you're genuinely curious how someone can make 21k/year? You seriously don't know what minimum wage jobs pay? They exist and plenty of people work them

i use blowpipe with 99 range and 3 range pots, 10 prayer pots and the rest absorptions. I get about 250k an hour.

Not to mention that there are loads of spiders with venom that is simply not potent enough to cause any harm to humans. Whether a spider the size of sriracha sauce would have weak venom like that is a different question though

It can be instanced and allow groups to enter, but it leaves it open for high levels to farm all the items into obscurity

This and 90% of real players chilling at the GE or Corsair cove, so new players get an empty Lumbridge filled with splashers and botters instead of any real meaningful interaction.

Instead of making it tradeable, make it useful but letting it stack and letting you pick five each day.

I thought that too, but Lathas is an NPC in DS2, so DS2 would have to be a req. quest for Song of the Elves, which it's not.

It's a shame, I wanted him to kick it too.

I'm pretty sure Ash does engine work though. Otherwise how else did he completely redo the bank code and rewrite parts of the game to allow Make-X?

To be fair, there‚Äôs no saying whether or not they will. Their most recent response to the last poll was a very subtle fuck you that (imo) reassured that when it comes down to it they will do what they want to do.

IIRC they will only respawn if they heal Jad to full hp. Make sure you attack them all to get them off Jad to avoid this

Otherwise just get their attention and run through Jad to block them. Careful with the prayer switches though as you could end up getting  meleed. Much easier to just kill them before jads at full hp though

One thing that was mentioned in one Q&amp;A was an npc who would let you reclaim items lost on death in the sarachnis boss room for something like 50k. Why was this not implemented? Is it because it isn't an instance?

&gt;And the meaning of choice with Olbertus is fantastic and feels like an RPG.

Spoken like someone who doesn't understand the game. RuneScape was never about having the player make choices and locking the player out of certain outcomes based on what decision they make, whether that be in quests, PvM etc. Game design like that works a lot better in games where it doesn't take so much time to get your stats up.

What kind of idiot bank would adjust their interest rate to match your risk level? Clear sign you have no idea. If you increase the interest rate on someone with bad credit, you're only increasing the possibility that they default because it'll get out of hand. The adjustment is made on the amount of the loan, allowing them a smaller amount until they build their credit. What school taught you finance?
---
To add on to this obby should be done on norm and DH on hard mode, and if you want to afk for long periods of time (10 mins+) obby is a really good option. I can afk 10 hours a day with an absolute maximum interaction time of 30 mins, the rest of the time you just leave it to get that sweet, sweet XP.

---
I‚Äôll try that out. Thanks
---
Perhaps they did, that doesn't change the fact that there are recent years (like 2016) where Jagex would have lost money or been barely profitable without MTX.
---
MTX had negatively affected the whole gaming industry, and one of those side effects is outdone are less willing to pay money upfront for games, so companies decide to try and monetize whales who subsidize the free-riders.
---
Freemium then got perverted into Paymium where you have paid games that people are willing to pay for that the devs realized they could get even more money off the whales.
---
For Jagex to not rely on MTX, membership cost have to go up, and they have to hope they don't lose too many people from raising the price of membership.
---
They could filter many spots out with mid level monsters or small quest requirements
---
Agreed i hope this game lasts forever
---
You have it right. Grinding to 70 agility is **not** for everyone, so you get your foot in the door with an agility bot. Then the path diverges. Get a bot for mining/RC/WC/combat? Maybe you know some programming and make your own. Maybe you setup a farm to get lots and lots of coal or something. Maybe you setup 100 accounts to march in unison at the GE. It all starts with running your first bot because you want to do a clue and training to 70 agility is absolute hell.
---
Pretty sure the mod blog about it says its not really for people who do vork, zulrah, tob, or cox regularly. The only people that do high pvm that are doing it are trying to fill collections log, pet hunt, or content stream.

Slayer is good money, keep at it. Once you hit 70 for kurasks and 75 for gargoyles you'll notice a big jump in money you'll be making from it. Plus since its combat you'll work your way up to more rewarding bosses for money . Work on diaries for dailies like battlestaffs, misc kingdom and get some herb runs in if you don't have much time to play they're all good passive money in the long run.

Yes, you loot the urns in the second highest and highest room you can enter. You can loot the grand gold chest in any room if you want additional chances at a scepter.  
---
  
---
A scepter is 100% worth it, you can just sell it when you're done and not having to search rooms manually saves so much time and translates to must better exp rates.  
---
My inventory when I do plunder is the scepter, some stams, a stack of noted gold seals, and a con cape, rest is food (brews if you want to stay there for a really long time, but monks, sharks, etc. are fine). My equipment is graceful chest, legs, and boots, serp helm, regen bracelet, and HP cape.  
---
I wouldn't suggest banking at the sophanem bank, just take a tele for your closest bank (dual ring will work well) then bank and tele back with the scepter.
---
Exactly. I still hop on for 'massive drop parties' where the guy logs out, pretending to be a girl for free gp, the little things. I liked pre GE because every bit of gear I found a seller and was able to buy felt like an achievement. Now its like everything but end game gear is worthless and I feel nothing acquiring it.
---
Idk either. But let‚Äôs assume you can bring your tools. I‚Äôd say magic would be out. So not magic/superheat. 
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a tree next to an ore patch anywhere that I can think of. And fishing spots are out too.
---
And $11
---
Not a massive amount. Banking probably takes 2 minutes at most, and you can do multiple runs before banking.

Don't be so racist.

Just ignore it haha. I have a maxed 13 def, 75 attack and it is fun to play on.

People flame me all the time but end of the day I can pk when I want and do most pvm content I want.
---
If you find it fun, go for it. I will say I don't pk as well as I used to (in part, I believe, because I'm mostly fighting zerkers).
---
To be honest, I didn't run into any problems with bots while playing on my F2P iron man last month, at least not at the spots where I was training. I've mined at al kharid mine and crafting guild, killed hill giants and ogresses, and I also chopped  willows in draynor village. At none of these spots did I find a significant concentration of bots, and the accounts I did run into seemed to be legitimate players. The only spots that did have those ugly stacks of random names were at the karamja fishing spot and edgeville furnace, but you don't need to compete for those resources so it didn't impact my exp rates.  
---
I don't know how a new player would approach his journey but as far as I can tell its perfectly possible to train up your account without the bots really affecting you, except from their influence on item prices I guess.
---
Doubly so for non ironmen.
---
Get out of your shell nerd
---
Oily rod and bait. You crack them open with a hammer and get onyx boly tips, lava scale shards or tokkul. It's in the part of tzhaar that you need a firecape to get into. If you end up doing it I'll see you there it's usually what I afk at work since it's slow and the gp isn't terrible. I'm getting 20k/xp an hour afking so it's pretty bad but again for afk and money it's decent for 80 fishing.
---
The argument ‚Äúthe high level iron community doesn‚Äôt want &lt;x&gt;‚Äù is the most obnoxious thing ever. I‚Äôm a 2200 total iron and could give 2 fucks about alternative methods for gathering shit.
---
You‚Äôre making a big deal over nothing.
---
The question was a tile to get multiple 99s. I clearly said there's tiles you can train one skill on.
---
That's actually sad, because you would think if venezuelans truly do this as a source of income or whatever, they would actually have a good account that has decent money making methods. 
---
I can run vorkath for 3 hours and make 2-5m depending on drops and luck, if a Venezuelan did this for 6 hours they could make roughly 5-8m and maybe hit a vis drop. That's also playing the game, etc. 
---
Especially considering apparently they don't get banned because they don't technically bot, they are always there, and they will play for legit 14 hours straight if they need the money. 
---
I imagine they would WANT maxed accounts to access raids, etc. 
---
IDK though, I know they apparently do what they do there because osrs can bring in as much money a month as a doctor (there was a legit Venezuelan who explained the osrs situation a year ago or so, explained how he had a medical professional family member who brought in less per month than he did), but I don't understand there thinking behind making that gp. 
---
TBH, I bet you osrs gp could become a crypto... I could actually see it being viable.
---
There's two shields bro I'm talking about the other one
---
So I know there are tons of bots around. But I honestly haven't been affected by them at all in my couple of months since rejoining the game. Maybe it's because I started up a membership after about a week but still.

Nowhere does it say it must be a btw

Because RuneScript is powerful. Make X is nothing complicated. It's a menu item, that takes an input variable of X and then stores that value to your account. If it exists, you show another field for it and the Make X still appears in case the user wants to change at any point. This would then be applied to the template of any Make items and would use a priority system for ordering the menus in the correct position.
---
RuneScript is powerful enough to do the farming rewrite. When they say engine, they literally mean engine. However a novice wouldn't need to do all that and it's a gradual path to get to Ash level and even then not many need to do what he's doing. The novice would refer to example quests, not hard to call a function where it's just spouting dialogue, doing basic checks and the like.
---
You only get what you leave tutorial island with, then have to walk directly to the tile and stay there until maxed in everything possible
---
You can fish karambwans at 65 fishing. They don‚Äôt give a ton of exp, (50 each) but they are worth a decent amount cooked on the grand exchange. 
---
I believe I saw somewhere you had 67 hunter as well. You could collect eclectic implings and sell on the g e. I believe they go for like 1.5-1.7k each and you can camp a spawn point in puro-puro.
---
Why do you have to ruin everything, always.
---
Oh right I had no idea there was another one sorry bud
---
Oh lort
---
Give it to Jagex. They made it about 7 years ago.
---
There's still no evidence they're only paid 30k. You're taking a reddit post with no source as fact for some reason
---
Average time to max is well over 2000, probably 2500 hours. Top efficiency (which almost nobody reaches is like 1500h to max, assuming u have all gp already)
---
It would fix the issue entirely if jagex "partnered" up with osbuddy and runelite and allow them to be the two alternate clients besides the original one, and then they should strictly ban all other clients, since 99% of them are used for exploits/bots/ unfair advantages.
---

The fact you managed to read that into my comment proves that YOU are the epitome of what's wrong with the gaming community.

Would you rather drink her bath water or suck a fart from her booty hole?
---
Require a mobile authentication at account creation, and only allow one or two accounts per number, per month. That would slow down accounts being created, and who doesn't have access to a phone in 2019?
---
I think you might just have some nostalgia goggles on. I only started playing after GE was released and I for sure would NOT want the old system. Being able to sell off a tab quick and easy is very nice. Also, yes, the main appeal of ironman is the 'do it yourself' aspect. Source: hcim btw

Adrenaline is a hell of a drug and it‚Äôs pumped into you at a great rate if you‚Äôre getting angry/ starting to boil. This is to aid your fight or flight response. Well the flight part uses a lot of energy so your body naturally fills you with a lot of adrenaline to aid in this (it assumes you‚Äôre going to be sprinting, say 200m+) but if you‚Äôre sticking around / stationary then the adrenaline just circulates. This is where the nerd rage comes in. Most nerds aren‚Äôt very athletic so they‚Äôre not used to the adrenaline you get naturally while working out. So it‚Äôs a new sensation. Your body tells your brain that you need to fight. HIT SOMETHING, it screams. Thus- random holes in the wall. Personally, I use a heavy bag a few times a week for 10-30min and that does wonders. Plus it helps with technique if I‚Äôd actually get into a fight again.

'I could be wrong' and I'm glad to be proven so for the sake of the guy who posted it. Feel pretty dumb now üòâ
---
Confirmed, that diary was the best thing I've ever done. ever. IRL or runescape.
---
I don't think it's a fault of the game design that so many bots exist. Sure, some of the bots are actual players botting because they don't want to have to do some of the more tedious tasks manually, but that does not make up the majority of bots.
---
The majority of the bots and the bots ruining F2P are bots owned by bot farmers trying to make real world money and they would exist no matter how the game was designed.
---
Always kinda wish this was recreated in OSRS. Feel like OSRS is missing content like this.
---
Hey you forgot to train all of your non-melee skills
---
I‚Äôll be honest I don‚Äôt have any of that gear (capes/serp/regen). Would I be better off sticking to full graceful then? But the ring advice is really helpful. Duel arena is a much better idea. And you‚Äôre right, I forgot the mummy moves around. Scepter it is!
---
Both? Both.
---
And they still can. Just not through mtx. Players want them. Just not like that. I think they‚Äôre great fitting award for elite diaries.
---
Who the fuck gilded this lmfao
---
Back to the temple with you.
---
Naxx was so difficult that back then only 1% of guilds were able to clear it.
---
There was 6 months between BC and Naxx which would be considered a reasonable time between a large content patch in WoW and a new expansion, since most people got very salty about SoO being out a year before the WoD expansion.
---
I think 6 months is a healthy amount of time, but given that you called it Nox I'm fairly certain you dont really know what you're talking about lmao
---
Currently 90hp and 65 agility. How many runs do you think I could pull if I use brews before having to bank?
---
slash is what I did for strength, but I guess it would be smarter to look at your bonuses and see if you have higher slash or stab bonus and do lunge if your stab is higher.
---
I went for computer stuff lol, was military tech school.
---
Also if you want a good look at the wilderness I‚Äôd go with a rune crossbow and dragonhide and cheap bolts, and do some wilderness slayer from Krystilia. You can get to know some spots and it gives you an idea of the dangers and different areas, and it‚Äôs kind of exciting almost getting pked
---
Not sure, but you gotta do the math to find out
---
Yeah definitely untrue
---
lol yeah, maybe they wouldn't be such good agents after all.

"Hey you can't bring that handgun on the flight! "

---
I went from like lvl 20 farming to 70 farming in a month with a pretty budget method. Just plant Willow Trees and Pineapple trees and you'll passively get it on time.
---
That seems like a huge stretch to make. Maybe they are turned off by the extremely low quality graphics and unengaging gameplay so once they finish tutorial island they just don't want to continue.
---
The average person isn't going to enjoy Runescape, and that's okay.
---
Yeah im using extended supers and praying the right thinks. It's mainly the ranged attacks that really hit me hard. There have been a few kills where I probably had enough supplies left for a second kill but decided not to risk it. I'll keep trying because maybe I'm just making more mistakes than I realize.

First of all, this thread is 4 months old. Don't revive it. Second of all, voting no to everything without even looking at it is just fucking ignorant. Third, isn't impersonating devs against ingame rules?

BANK SALE

The Giant Dwarf. No sane person would continue to do it after though.

It makes a giant difference when using BP as main weapon. Bring like 5 melee item swaps for the spec for better accuracy and max hit

You don't burn fish pretty soon, it's not a big deal. People still fish in lumby but drop the fish.

Why do I never see anyone talk about bank sales? I used to spend an hour or two at a time at the bank doing bank sales when I needed money.
---
Yes, thanks. Sorry for correcting you, just some people don't know.
---
I‚Äôm calling the police
---
I would be very surprised if there were bots that could do every quest. A lot of them require those little random-event-style visual puzzles, or boss fights like the one in Haunted Mine. And there are so many of them that I don't think it would be worth coding a bot to handle all of it.
---
Well it seems to be a mystery.  Why not test it out for 100 strikes each and get a general feel for it?

Man this sub is so great sometimes with the content and then I click on shit i hope my girlfriend never sees.

this is a very accurate explanation for calculating accuracy and all sorts of combat formulas, everything i do is based on this http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?317,318,712,65587452 which was in turn used by the same person to construct this spreadsheet for calculating dps https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit
---
I wrote a lot and ended up confusing myself, you can plugin the numbers, you'll find that against an opponent with just a dscim, the 20 def build is 2.88x more tanky.

These formulas and this sheet are very well verified and used by the high level community / pvmers

Learn the range/range rotation first . It is the easiest to learn
---
I did, the game was better then IMO
---
There are scripts for pretty much everything, so probably. I used to bot a long while ago (gave up after all the bans) and even then in the free scripts sections there were quite a few quest scripts available.
---
There's really no point. No high level players make cannonballs and they aren't going to start if you make them twice as fast. I think cannonballs are like 120-150k/h right now. So you'd be talking about a gold sink for max players that allows them to make up to 300k/h (probably less cause cball prices would decrease) by doing something they have no interest in.
---
Idk I tried a f2p cow hide bot a few years ago and they were able to detect and ban that almost instantly. Their counter bot methods are much better than they were back in 2010

My suggestion since this is more about F2P new members, reduce the number of F2P worlds.

You can't really use paypal on websites that easy, it's mostly bitcoin so it's impossible to chargeback. If you wan't to use a credit card they require a bunch of ID verifications and some stuff like that.

&gt; Or better yet, re-add hazardous random events to F2P
---
This is basically the same as captchas though. Bots won't care, it's a simple edit to their scripts. Normal players that wc half afk will lose their axe heads again. It's literally only punishing real players.

Yeah that one this morning, and I was checking out top post of all time yesterday since I'm new to the subreddit and swampletics was being memes everywhere and I just had no idea.  I was so lost.

Yeah would eliminate getting scammed by " friends "

it's a skull trick.

Yeah but it will be free in time and it will add more quest that wouldnt be harmful

Agree 100% one of the biggest problems with OSRS.

I'm pretty sure expanding the amount of F2P worlds was a half-assed lazy attempt at solving the botting issue

When they attacked you on the craws bow account they logged in on a new pking account with a similar name and gear to try and get you to attack the new account.

osrs has probably 25-30 minutes of possible dailies if you do them all. Which include miscellania, bstaffs, NMZ herb boxes, Herb run, tree run, farming contracts, hespori, seaweed run, birdhouse run.

But the difference is that in this game none of those really feel required unless you are an ironman.

The barrel in the Viyeldi Caves has a chance to give you a Paramaya Ticket, which grants you a ‚Äúnights stay at the luxurious Paramaya Inn‚Äù in the Ranger‚Äôs guild.

Hey - thank you so much for your post. I really appreciate it! I think I'll use this to get to 90 for a bit. Xp rates seem great compared to other skills and there's a bit of passive cash and a pet chance. Seems like a winner.

Hey good try, but during Spirit of Elid the genie references his brother and says that's he's his evil twin. Thus making him a biological male, but his gender is fluid.
---
As for swampy, he plays a model that is allowed to have a beard. As you know, JaGex is a degressive company and hasn't allowed that option for female identifying/female born individuals, thus meaning swamp is playing a male character, leaving his gender to be fluid.
---
As they are represented in this artwork their features have been changed so that they are both female presenting or transfemale. That's not right and it's homophobic as we already do not have an adequate enough representation of positive homosexuals in this game.

Nice try, try again, but try harder.

**I can't do the boss as high-levels are camping it with a scythe to get the pet! If the boss didn't have a pet then the high levels would go away**
---
* Without making the boss an instance or having multiple Sarachnis' rooms per world (which didn't make sense given she is the mother of the temple spiders), day 1 release was always going to be a problem, even more so considering that it was the 4th of July, a day that a lot of our American players will take off work.
---
* The reason the boss has a pet is because it just honestly felt like she should have one, given the scale of the boss and that there are easier bosses to kill with a pet. Also, getting a pet is a genuinely enjoyable experience that I didn't want to deprive any mid-level player killing the boss of.

* I also believe that the boss not having a pet would not fix the problem because the Collection Log exists. With the collection logs, players will still be farming this boss for the Jar/Cudgel in order to fill up the Sarachnis section.
---
* Worlds are already quieter than they were last week, I was even able to get over 100 kills on my own Ironman over the weekend, despite me having to hop worlds to find a quiet room so give it a shot yourselves!
---
I am one of the people who created a thread about why the boss is "ruined" because of the pet, and I still stand by what I said. When you make a non instanced boss with a pet without a BIS item. its going to be camped by maxed mains with BIS gear and the main item will be worthless in 2-3 months because the supply will greatly outmatch the demand for the item. I also think the collection log community is much smaller then the Pet hunting community by a big margin, although that could just be conjecture on my part. So adding a pet greatly devalues  the GP/Hour of the boss almost instantly. pretty much making it not worth doing a few months after the release, which is a shame because the mechanics of the boss and dungeon are super fun.
---
I have gotten about 75 kills on my account, it isn't super hard to find a world it just takes about 5-6 world hops and you will get a few kills and need to hop because someone will crash you. so that isn't the biggest issue. the issue is the longevity of the boss. if pet hunters did not camp there the Cudgle would face a steady decline in price, not the dramatic drop we are going to see in the next few weeks, making the boss worse money then barrows or other mid level money making methods.  I also disagree with their are easier bosses then this one to kill for the pet. the only ones I could think of would be the wildy ones, but those come with inherit risks that this one doesn't.
---
overall I love the design, love the boss mechanics, enjoy the lore, really appreciate making a boss that doesn't cater to end game content, but think the pet itself is enough to make this boss not worth doing for most players.
---
I am aware of those items on the drop table I am talking about buffing the drop table ? The 3 items you mentioned are incredibly easy to obtain from normal pvm so changing the item to something that wasn‚Äôt would definitely hold value ? Don‚Äôt get why you even commented üòÇ
---
You can if you use someone else's fire before you talk to the npc again
---
I love you so much for this

There's a bunch of dailies in osrs?

Especially for irons

I love you both

Dont openly admit to breaking the rules on an internet forum frequented by the devs of the game then G W E N T.

Use one of those two braincells

Some poor attempt to cram as many OSRS memes as possible into a single title, probably done by someone with English as a second language.

id rather die, i got auto weeder, missed 1 plant and rip 20 minutes, i want the farming outfit, but the minigame is cancer.
---
They did this in rs3 and all the ges are just super dead and now there's no "one spot" you can go and guarantee you'll run into people
---
Like y'all said about how the maps big and it spreads ppl out, but then you're trying to spread them out more
---
Went back to killing vork now and seem to be getting consistent 2 kill trips so I guess I was just screwing up way more than I thought haha.
---
Yes, because they're on the RDT and the RDT isn't rare to hit.
---
Dom tower was a decent update tbh. NMZ has potential but it‚Äôs over powered in rewards and xp, easily botted and out of place. Vote no to easyscape
---
At least wow classic probably isn't gonna have 10000 bots...
---
Is he confirmed to be Serene?

It makes sense. Jagex and Pornhub have so much in common. All their employees are getting fucked.

Congrats daddy Greg uwu

senko btw

Just never take it off.

Problem solved?

Any chance of Sraracha getting a recolor ability, maybe by consuming some extra pages? I really would like to have the blue and orange spawn colors as options

You realise Runescape 3 is a direct descendant of osrs? Like rs3 WAS old school Runescape. Then slowly over the years a lot of "not that bad" updates culminated in to "this is fucking terrible"

Wait that's awesome.

Wow this video is perfectly describes what mmorpg is and should be . Subbed

Whole house catches on fire

Noob go away man I‚Äôve never met a bigger nerd simple fact is buffing the drop table would make them worth doing üòÇ

Seriously. Lots of "not that bad" updates turned rs2 in to what rs3 is now.

Who are these investors and why are they all chinese?

All it would take is one false ban or rouge person and you got yourself a shit show there m8

They've been fighting bots for 17 years... You sitting here for 10 mins thinking isn't going to come up with a magical catch all solution they haven't thought of yet.

Interesting that Jagex introduced a feature that dorectly contradicts their in-game rules
---
373 people disagree.

Wait....
---
374 :)
---
dammmm
---
Yeah except with no instance they stop other players from having a go until days later.

Just hit 3k cerb kc myself, no puppy

I keep telling myself it's just a 60 something percent chance of getting it so far. Hang in there

you fucked it up
---
158/250 here. Was really hoping for 73 or 69.
---
Classic will die though, they said they wont add new content so after 2 years its kinda over
---
When your rude, and hateful, and can't even be bothered to treat someone with common decency, they won't stay around to endure it forever. That's common decency 101.
---
It's actually just a reddit app that tries to hard to be cool with the kids, using references that don't fit.
---
Till they whip out a gmaul and use karambwans? No.
---
One of Jagex's goals right now is to attract new players whereas for years OSRS has benefitted from lapsed ones. Making the pay hurdle sooner is not a good way to do that.
---
Yes WoW may retain more players but that's because you have to pay to even play like you say. But WoW isn't built in a way that would have a smooth F2P to P2P transition, OSRS/RS2 has been built on that model from the start. And it's a good model.
---
The problem is F2P is an absolutely atrocious experience for a new player. So they have 2 options really:
---
1. Free P2P trial so then they go to shitty F2P and pay to get back to what they were doing
---
2. Fix F2P which is not an easy task.
---
We out here.
---
Yeah I mean look at Disney, been doing it for years

Why does that kid have massive tits/pecs? Or is that something else?

Oops, you're correct. Hopefully it's not too late for OP lol

So the to you only used 100 is the weird glitched one is all I was saying

Stackable food is a no for me, especially if it restores run too.

i think ressetting stats would be a very good gold sink idea say a maxed main resets stats to 1 def after paying 15mill or w/e

It's just meant to be a turn the valves and brute force it kind of thing... :|
---
I think you can take the boat at all times. And then depending on which valves are turned in which direction, you go to different spots in the cave. So if you go too far, you close a valve and if you don't go far enough you open a valve. It's been ages, though, so please don't quote me.

It will get removed automatically :(

What should I have stats wise tho 90s and minimum 78 herb? I have no idea what basic raids gear would look like

I know, it's a little sad. I spend a fair bit of time on w377 doing shades with people and I swear every 10m someone asks 'what's the point of this?' I have no good answer, but making I find making sacred oil and burning shades surprisingly relaxing. Fiyr shades are okay training with salve &amp; void as well.
---
I have experienced many cultures and customs as well in my travels around the globe both as a civilian and in the military. Certainly there were cultures I experienced as you describe, and those were against my personal values. 
---
However, In leu if writing a massive book I suggest you find some readings on the ‚ÄúPhilosophy of Ethics‚Äù, take a course at university if that is a feasible option for you. 
---
For a short reflection into why one would *shiver* at your statement I suggest specifically delving into Cultural Relativism (DMR), Moral Relativism and Moral Absolutism. 
---
[Stanford ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/#ForArg) is an excellent starting point when delving into these muddy waters but again I recommend taking a course at Uni to help better process these ideas.

Like sure. I don't remember the exact month, or what my ZIP code was, when I created the account. I COULD search up some of this stuff on emails received when I made the account, but I can't access my email with this information. I mean, the account is years old, I can't recall all that shit.
---
There is a thin line in my opinion between Patriotism &amp; nationalism I am not talking about nationalist socialism that is a different ideology 
---
I don't believe that there is anyone on earth who agrees with everything their country does there always will be internal politics, especially in this age where information is so freely available.
---
Not every nationalist would agree with war because not all wars are in its nations best interest.  
---
Most world leaders are in corporate pockets or profit from war they are globalists not nationalists so they are enemies to begin with.
---
nationalists/patriots would rather get rid these country leaders
---
than risk their culture being wiped away but wouldn't have to think twice about giving their lives defending it.
---
Well of course I'm praying ranged. And yes I am killing the ads when I solo it. But I think the little mage spiders are either too accurate or hit too hard for how accurate they are. They cause me to eat more food than the entire rest of the encounter. As per my post I am wearing karils top and bottom which should help my mdef a lot
---
Congrats!
---
Now with four assistants, you've got no excuse for your max fire cape :)
---
Pretty much mystic in all cases between those three. If you didn't need the magic accuracy (eg Barrows) you would just use melee armor. Splitbark and skeletal don't really have niches as far as I know, because you either all in on damage, or use different armor even if it has a negative bonus. 
---
Typically you look at the def stats of your enemy, and use the type of attack they're weakest to. Outside of maybe pvp, the combat triangle isn't super helpful. Even then, it's not exactly the end all be all formula.
---
So if someone wants their house to say have the haunted mansion theme. It‚Äôs okay to wait until the next Halloween event to get it.. but waiting for a promotion to finish to get something isn‚Äôt the same thing?
---
Both are free, both you have to wait for, both are achieved in game. 
---
I agree that a cosmetics store is not required, but the vocal community just made it very clear that they don‚Äôt want partnerships what so ever. Meaning those new player incentives/teasers people want gone. 
---
The free membership promo‚Äôs, gone
---
People weren‚Äôt actually signing up to twitch to claim those offers, majority of they didn‚Äôt have it signed up for the trial, got their membership and cancelled the trial. They didn‚Äôt pay a cent
---
Now that it‚Äôs something cosmetic that doesn‚Äôt effect the game what so ever as EVERYONE gets it anyways, apparently the sky is falling down. 
---
Mtx will join this game more than it already is, it‚Äôs the in thing. It‚Äôs a mobile game now and they thrive off of it. Unfortunately it‚Äôs a matter of time. 
---
Peoples argument that cosmetic mtx is what ruined rs3 is bullshit, the ability to buy xp and the evolution of combat ruined that game, not cosmetics.
---
I trust our devs not to make that same mistake twice.
---
Lmfao, I very much know how the mechanics work. So don't down vote me cause you're a salty child.

its not great money and the pet is ugly as can be but its really easy to get into and pretty braindead to camp so people do it.

You should get paid for this
---
I believe BA Queens pays out 6m per torso per leecher.
---
And yes they do training, but you only need a 17 minute trial in order to run for them, so the average competent person  shouldn't require too much training.
---
If u can't get kills with an ags idk what to tell u man
---
Are you like 15 with no idea how a business works? The devs get paid salaries and jagex is a company worth hundreds of millions of dollars. They make millions off of bonds and membership. Devs don‚Äôt get paid a share and your numbers are way off base, they‚Äôre revenue and profit reports are all public.
---
Thanks for your complaint, random citizen! No need to go post your own content. We'll just whip up a new batch. Would you like fries with that?

Still more dangerous than a bottle of toothpaste lmao

Fuck mining

It's scary for the players with PTSD from RS3, because??? Are they scared that the Devteam changes the poll results without us knowing or something? Still not following sorry, clearly I'm missing something.

That‚Äôs not a bad salary at all tho so ion get the big deal

Yes, but I'm also 10hp. Training it is roughly 10-20k xp per hour at lower levels and 20-40k or more once you get above 50ish and have good RNG with gangs.

I don't get why people say any remake of an oldschool game is automatically a copy of osrs. Those remakes often get attention due to succesful private servers
---
The time for the raid?!? That‚Äôs like a 90 min raid
---
Yeah, I am actually surprised with the increase in valuation given that the prior parent company was going through bankruptcy/restructuring, and thus were in a position where they probably should've had less negotiating power and thus had a lower reserve price.
---
Ultimately though, the price that Jagex was purchased for has already happened. Maybe the prior parent really puffed the company with fancy "trends", I should hope they didn't falsify anything. Realistically, I think there isn't much room for further MTX monetization of RS3, and considering that OSRS hasn't been fully monetized MTX-wise, it appears like to an investors that the seemingly intuitive place to seek further MTX monetization, in lieu of subscriber growth/subscription price hikes.
---
Certainly, if I were an investor, I wouldn't've paid the multiple that was paid for Jagex, as it seems rather risky to me compared to something like an investment in Global Large Cap Equities.
---
Osrs is the only game I play. I don‚Äôt watch tv or do much else in my ‚Äúfree‚Äù time. Since mobile came out I‚Äôve had many more opportunities to play
---
I'd pay $11 for that.
---
More Devs would be cool. Also if they promised no MTX. Hell i'll pay $15 for that promise.
---
In most cases what is better depends on what you are fighting and other factors. If you are just looking at dps then use this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit?usp=drivesdk (on mobile right now so I hope the link works)
---
I personally don't know much about gear choices but I know for mage the thing that matters most is getting the things that increase magic damage (I forget which atm, there's like 3) and after that is magic attack which would only help you hit more often.
---
honestly embarrassing now
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/40Idny0

Yeah I did POH for maybe 300 kills then started bringing food and stuff. The long tap delay is ridiculous on mobile. It should be shortened imo

None of this is acceptable

Probably the same reason you got butt hurt because they mined rocks that dont belong to you

Oh thats pretty cool. It sounds kind of like what disney does for disabled guests. Except you have the lazy river and stuff to pass the time. I'll have to go soon.

W-what power...

Not a fan

Which kit is that?

In this case it was.
---
Yeah I'm an endgame player and have made well over 62m in a day before. So when I realized 62m for a years membership was a thing, it was the easiest decision ever. But I get there's players struggling to keep theoretical food on the OSRS table

I'm definitely betting on this. She's a goner.

That or the dude with all the pigeon cages. Lol jk.

Gargoyles aren‚Äôt until like 70 slayer or something so by the time you even get the slayer level you‚Äôll be fine

Never, 2b is nothing compared to how much effort ironmen have put into their account to be at that point. Bragging rights alone more than the item itself.

assuming so based on her wording
---
I'm glad someone is finally making fun of these idiotic 99 videos.
---
Ge made the game possible for new players, it was an amazing update.
---
Think they came from Jagex vacancy pay bands. Remember seeing a screenshot of some Jagex careers with really low pay bands.
---
I mean if you are making reddit post about zulrah I suppose you are closer than u think to remembering all of the rotations. Just get some image on the side, and go tank it until full rotation ends.

Thank You, I did submit a request to the Support Section. Although, I'm not 100% sure it went through as I had sent it in through my Phone, and I am afraid that sending a duplicate request would harm my chances for an appeal.

Dunno if you care, but for comparison, I've done 450 sarachnis kills and have about 32 of each page
---
Pyramid Plunder
---
Yes, but this isn't like that -- there is a sufficient alternative. It's not like if you fight Olbertus the altar is permanently destroyed. You just need to offer 200 bones. This is just an action you took and its consequence. There's a way to fix the consequence so your analogy is not comparable at all.
---
It's constructive feedback. Developers need feedback so they can accurately gauge how their update affects all sorts of different players, beyond the scope of what they originally design for. 
---
"Complaining" as you call it is not a bad thing; in fact it's one of the most valuable resources this sub can offer to Jagex. Whining‚Äìwhich is complaining without trying to be constructive‚Äìis. This comment thread is not whining.
---
Honestly, the price of those drops fits in well IMO. Compare it to the KBD, which was the first boss I remember killing with friends back in 2007. It's even less dangerous due to the fact its not in the wilderness, therefore I think 20-25k an hr is definitely fair with the added chance of pet/cudgel.
---
Maybe in 3 years when summoning and EoC get released

---
Try not using an ad hominem attack or insulting resumptions? I will not use one in response, because I am a better man than that. 
---
The post is a thought experiment intended to provoke thoughtful discussion, not someone making baseless claims about my age, my intelligence, understanding of corporate finance, and saying that numbers exist without linking them. I am not focusing on the complexity of implementation in Jagex's corporate environment as is, because I do not know enough about Jagex's current ownership agreement. If you know more please let me know! All I do know is that if you add you assumptions then yes, of course the idea makes no sense, and I do not know enough to comment specifically on the financial flows because I do not know the cent-by-cent break down of every dollar that enters Jagex. I know so little that all I did was make axiomatic assumptions about one additional dollar and applied some basic arithmetic with taxes.
---
If you have a more realistic model of how a dollar is broken down as it enters Jagex, please tell me! I have a decent background in finance from a macro-economic policy perspective, but knowledge about the granular workings of how an individual dollar paid by a customer navigates multi-stakeholder corporate enterprises wherein companies owned by there enterprises function as liquidity flows to be invested elsewhere please let me know! That shit's hard to find discrete information on. 
---
Also, I tried to address my lack of knowledge here
---
***Let‚Äôs magically assume we live in a world where one more USD a month per sub minus ‚Äúprocessing fees‚Äù goes directly to the people who code/develop the game.*** 
---
I make no claim about the following:
---
- revenue
---
- profits
---
- bonds
---
- shares
---
You make no claim about:
---
- subscription numbers
---
If you have them please link them! I'd appreciate that because I coudl not find them specifically for OSRS, only an aggregation of OSRS and RS3.

Lastly, salaries of a business are to me dependent on cashflow, liabilities, outlays, and assets. I know this isn't a money goes in money comes out in paychecks equation.

Well the only thing i don't like is they added a pet lol turning low level content into high level content, i have no idea why they hell they feel the need to include a pet in every little thing at this point the games saturated with pets.
---
Buyables will retain value as when you use them, it‚Äôs removed from the game.

I suppose. They were saying on the Q&amp;A how jagex was looking to hire a proper esports person who's worked in the industry for a while. Archie didn't have that qualification obviously. I'm curious to see how this all goes

If you‚Äôre going purely for points do every 1-9 at turael and the 10th at konar, otherwise stick with nieve/dura for normal tasks and still use konar for 10ths. It‚Äôs never worth using chaeldar

I‚Äôd ignore that guy, you are always going to find miserable people who are negative for no reason.

‚ÄúDevs don‚Äôt get paid a share‚Äù not really sure what he was getting at with this comment or what he meant, but if he is talking about a direct % share of revenue, well he would be correct in insinuating that it was incorrect for you to assume that all of the additional revenue would go towards funding salaries, however he would be incorrect in thinking that the extra revenue would have no effect on them or they would get ‚Äúno cut‚Äù of it. Their salaries are going to be funded from the revenue generated by the bonds/membership that he mentioned (assuming they are not funding any salary/wages with working capital) 
---
Without looking at their actual numbers and doing a high level educated guess, I would assume that the amount available for a new developer as a % of total expenses would have to be less than the total % increase of revenue from the new members ship price. (Not going to be this straightforward but just a high level example, they want to be able to show investors/higher ups that they are increasing net cash flow as a % of sales if they are adding more direct expenses and raising consumer cost)
---
That being said, I‚Äôm sure if they ever do increase membership prices they will not be wanting to add any additional expenses unless it is *absolutely* necessary, so probably will not happen unfortunately (my opinion) 
---
Also your post was well written and structured  while you also stated that you are probably wrong, so that guy had no reason to be a dick (probably just had a bad day at work or something)
---
He posts about as much as serene and serene alts (20+ comments every day) and started posting right around the same time as the (last of the?) previously known accounts stopped posting, *and* he posts on the same subs, and he's swedish just like serene.
---
Idiot didn‚Äôt blur out his compass, thanks for doing the grind for me
---
Everything on this boss is perfectly balanced with the exception of the cudgel being lacklustre.
---
Well then make it a choice instance like KBD.  You can do it in a group,  or pay gold to solo it.
---
The stuff we normally kill is way too good. Nerf vorkath and zulrah, and maybe even raids tbh
---
Agreed, but I would't call it Esports.
---
For me personally, seeing like 6b+ is when I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs a lot‚Äù
---
I can relate to that too well I think
---
If he can even get another fire cape to sacrifice to try Inferno
---
Yeah dt is the biggest point multiplier in nmz for some reason
---
i wish the rat pits werent so dead. i love cat content
---
There are always new accounts being made and it's likely people have a main to buy a ton of bones for their new account.
---
Basically anything you would normally use a blowpipe at. It‚Äôs better than rune cbow almost all the time
---
I started doing vork sans rigour and dhcb and have made enough for both CASUALLY doing it for a few months....he shits out Mils/hr for everyone
---
pls no kingdom hearts shit
---
art is fine i just hate the subject
---
This bwana has power
---
Zulrah is pretty easy honestly. Just need to change prayer before anything else and youll be find
---
Mintmadcow had a video where he said around 1m/hr.
---
What
---
Guys what if jagex let you redecorate your house to look like google offices if you enabled Authenticator
---
Lmao look at this weirdos post history

Do you have the diary done for more runes?

What a weird time sink, operating a troll reddit account all day.
---
omg yes please, I really fucking need this to exist
---
may i know whats your mage/range stats
---
&gt; mind numbingly boring enemies with lots of health
---
hydra has a pet too
---
PLEASE make this happen! Would purchase for sure.
---
dude, wow classic is 3 years younger than 2007 runescape. Obviously osrs now is much farther than wow classic but comparing 2007 to classic... pretty close.
---
There are mains lvl 122 wearing obby capes. Not like that‚Äôs me or anything
---
My boi
---
Doesn't appear to have history working for EA or anything horrible, looks like we got a winner.
---
Try ironman :)
---
Not meming. The game becomes a lot more interesting when it's not just boiled down to 2 activities:
---
1. Do your most profitable activity currently available
---
2. Buy skills and bankstand
---
3. (Optional) get impatient and spend irl cash to avoid playing the game. 
---
It really is fun when all in game activity becomes useful, low level drops are exciting, not just another little bit to your cash stack. 
---
Create a F2p one and give it a go, you've got nothing to lose by trying it
---
It was only my 7th attempt and I'm quite happy with that.
---
Buy the tabs?
---
they fixed most of that pre eoc. and its 500 kills to unlock but then you only need like 5-10 kills to get the item each time
---
Wheel, Snipe, Celly, Bud.
---
statistically challenged has wildy only ironman
---
Snipey no sniping!
---
The only faking I do is when the football is about to start and I am balls deep.
---
Manical monkeys are 1,000 hunter xp drops in osrs, so nice to see, only like 120k xp/h tho
---
OK.
---
Let's say bones crash hard everyone will start buying again cause of the low price. Thus again raising the price cause the demand will be so high.
---
Serious can someone please explain why this happens
---
I am interested in how she plans to make a heavily rng based game competitive ;p
---
That chat tho
---
Honestly man I've thought about iron man and think that added challenge would certainly be pretty fun as hell, especially in the beginning. But this game is way too fucking tedious for that lol
---
I love these so much but I have no idea why
---
I must ask, why the Bandos Godsword over say, Saradomin?
---
what does this mean
---
&gt;this

---
Kyle is that you?
---
...it‚Äôs not even instanced. It‚Äôs a kid level boss. Delete this nephew.
---
 Damn I got that like two months ago and sold for 29m
---
If no dhcb blowpipe is so much better lol
---
I genuinely do not like the games?
---
He makes good points, idk dude
---
Has there been any talk about that? It could be a nice tweak. There would be a lot less bots farming it...
---
Are you the same dumbass that's been making new accounts and spamming the various ironscape CCs flaming Sin? Nice edit btw, 10/10.
---
Yeah was just curious if there was a specific reason why you hated it.
---
Not only that, after shitting himself he decided to publicly post about it on twitter.
---
Did he think it was impressive? What did he expect peoples reactions would be?
---
I only sort by new...
---
i don‚Äôt get what you mean by in a perfect 1v1 situation, especially considering if you‚Äôre getting skull tricked that‚Äôs pretty impossible to do solo
---
it definitely does feel outdated but not doing it that way just sounds super hand holdy to me
---
and yes, if you are good at pking and staying calm, then throwing hits back at them at trying to catch a freeze is definitely better. The average pvmers are not going to meet that criteria
---
Octopus have 6 arms and 2 legs
---
The Mods working on OSRS seem pretty great, just overworked and poorly resourced for such a successful game, which is down to Jagex being stingy.
---
No excuses.
---
Ground items
---
Menu entry swapper and ground items
---
Yeah, I saw that. I'm a low level btw and reckon there's more pressing things to spend 32k on. Figured it'd be a relatively short (1/128) grind but I've been at it 4 days now in between fishing and cooking food and crafting arrows and ultimately wanting to know for curiosities sake.
---
Fucking weeb
---
r u ok?
---
I identify as a Cooked Mackerel. This might have been my biggest achievement yet.
---
is that a whiteclaw? your name chad or what
---
Given his points and KC, hes likely a learner and you dont bring ring switches when you're learning. Zerker is best ring to bring if you arent switching
---
Fakes
---
I'd personally be in support of that but the amount of upheaval that would cause for ironman accounts would be insane. People that may be hundred of hours from starting Zulrah-post SOTE lock already having all her uniques, etc.,
---
Yea.. Not a safe sex smasher of thots apparentlyüò¢üò≠ü§¶
---
Sheesh. Do that a couple times and that's my entire bank lol.
---
How many more posts should we expect congratulating jagex on this update?
---
Better than my team cape :)
---
I think they might've talked about adding more reqs to Zulrah before but I don't think there's been any requests/posts that gained traction talking about locking Zulrah behind Song of the Elves, especially since it's already locked behind Regicide.
---
I saw that too. I'm not worried.
---
Level up your HP through Str training. Don't keep too much cash on the account since it can always be recovered. Enjoy pking
---
I prefer rs3 art over osrs any day, I just play osrs due to eoc + mtx.
---
there's more in the dungeon than just the boss
---
I bet this is exactly what you expected when you first made the account
---
Yes real players buy GP, idk why are you so surprised by this, this is pretty common in every major mmorpg game
---
I grew up with the old (1-9) FF games. Squaresoft or enix have not put out anything worthwhile after those.
---
this is why this is my favorite sub
---
u/JagexSween
---
Why buy from gold sellers when u can buy the bonds and do the same?
---
Well that solves that
---
You should do the quest death to the dorg. For bone crossbow (bolts like 2gp ea) and gives you access to storerooms which is good ironman gp for low lvls.
---
I can respect that. Final Fantasy could make for a good crossover. I always thought Cloud looked awesome.
---
the gear you need for 3m/hr is basically de facto beyond t75 though
---
Can you just use English words, please?
---
Fuck instances.
---
Funny if you go 1500 world rev caves you‚Äôll see a dude named BIKER always bolt ragging
---
Would you use cudgel over leaf bladed battleaxe ?
