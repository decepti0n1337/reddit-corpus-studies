&gt;Also why would kourend spider be attached to Morytania whatever the fuck lorewise. Makes no sense

to be fair a random plant boss in kourend has lore connection with another random plant in morytania

You only have to kill one brother to loot the chest. But you would have to kill more skeletons/rats/worms if you want to increase your potentiometer for more runes. Also, any brother you haven‚Äôt killed can appear in the crypt as you are opening doors.

Not buying GP for me staking was the cancer.

Make an iron meme
---
So you did blood runes? I'm a bit confused because I'm going for 99 myself, I'm currently 94 but according to this calculator I'd only get 64 mil, which isn't really a whole lot, whereas Natures would get me 270 mil. 
---
I've done natures from 91-94 so far and I do feel like I'm going to/gonna get capral tunnel from it, so I am debating whether to switch to blood runes, which would be a lot easier but then I would lose 180 mil, and money is why I went for RC in the first place.
---
Grats on getting 99 though.
---
How long did it take to get to 99?
---
Takes away any temptation
---
450 blood runes? Lucky bastard
---
Best way to avoid this would be to just make an ironman
---
You could wait till group ironman comes out and play with your mates?
---
Nothing to loose, no one can see your kdr. Just set up your f keys and set up your inventory before you start
---
‚ÄúDue to no fault of your own‚Äù. If you brought more than 3 items you were willing to risk, knowing that disconnects are part of the game... that‚Äôs something you should be willing to accept. The normal game mode is dying because so many people are terrified of losing their items. Okay so you lost some shit? GRIND IT BACK. That is the game. If you just keep your things forever once you get them then the excitement dies very quickly.
---
Ultimates. My B
---
Direct buffing rather than balancing isn't QOL, and that's where we differ on this.
---
Fixing tap/F key inputs as far as the game interprets them is QOL/bug fix/integrity changing.
---
Allowing players to move all menu buttons to one side is QOL.
---
Allowing players to have two menus open at once, a feat no other RS player has ever achieved, is not QOL.
---
Ultimate. Sorry.

I got the head on my ironman :)))))

pyramid is easy. u can also get rewarded with pharaoh's sceptre! at lvl 51, you can get to room 4.first go in, search saracophagus, then the chest in middle. from there attempt to pick locks on the doors. there are 4 in each room. only one of the doors allows access to a deeper room. do not loot the artifacts and stuff, as the lower room youre in, the less xp you get. so your goal is to move the deepest you can at your lvl, and loot the artifacts. so after you reach the next room which requires lvl 31 thieving, same thing search saracophagus, and chest. move onto next room that requires lvl 41 thieving. here, due to the time it takes to get there, u have time to loot this full room, including artifacts etc, then move onto the following room requiring lvl 51 thieving and looting everything there before your timer is up. you should get decent xp/h. if u loot a pharaoh's sceptre from saracophagus or chest, gz on making bank! its 1/1k from either or, essentially 1/500 per room.

Brutal bruh dragons. They don't do any damage instead jungleflux partners with Google then use your internet history to launch sarcastic personal attacks about your darkest secrets and mental health struggles.
---
I mean really you should max without seeing a single pet. Seeing em pre 99 except for maybe farming if you're just doing pet patches and not trees is lucky on its own.
---
[removed]
---
Id beg to differ!
---
Hear me out! Revert to the old death mechanics BUT give players the option to keep the current ones by setting their account to EASY MODE. Easy mode players would keep current death mechanics but also have a large steaming diaper icon above there head permanently (like the pk skull) and next to their name in chat (like a pmod crown).  Problem solved, you‚Äôre all welcome.
---
Yes you can log out and take a break in between waves
---
I got mine at 42m xp which was just shy of sub 1k at the time. You got this mate :) doing all your pet patches?
---
You lucky bastard
---
ddosing would start back instantly if it went back to old death mechanics. it doesn't happen now and "you dont see it as much of an issue anymore" is because theres literally no point in doing it. Give them a reason to and it'll happen. 
---
We saw how much servers sucked when dmm tournament finals would happen, every single time.

There's no place like PoH
---
I‚Äôll have you know it took me 212 kills for my Vorki thank you very much
---
the guy who wrote the language for the original items died in a tragic linguistics accident
---
Magic stone create bad
---
Nope that's perfectly normal even if you trained from 1 to that 20m experience with pet being out and pet patches 
---
Seeing people be disappointed in no pet before hitting 99 hurts. It's stupidly lucky to get it in any skill that quick. Farming is one of the few you can heavily modify by just training with pet patches.
---
Mechanically it's not hard, but it is gear/level restricted. You will not be able to farm many kills/hr with low stats and poor equipment.
---
If you‚Äôre just AFKing the combat I strongly recommend you to put a few hours when u get mems and unlock fossil island. Ammonite crabs are the best / most afk combat xp AND they drop fossils for free XP lamps and prayer XP later. 
---
Also every hour you can do your birdhouses for the fastest hunter XP in the game and it only takes a minute. You can get expensive seeds and a consistent profit of bird nests every time you need a quick break.
---
Real unpopular opinion : death mechanics are fine and a good modernization to the game. Introducing other ways to sink items like kraken tentacle is a better method.
---
The obsession with old death mechanics seems to be a nostalgia obsession. Players simply don't want to lose all their progress from one death.
---
Old death mechanics will punish newer players more heavily than older players, as newer players will die more frequently. We want to implement a system that reduces the wealth hoarded, not those just getting started.
---
Oh I don't even think you'd get it in 200m of just herbs. It's rate on a herb patch is insane
---
Same here.
---
Damn I'm jealous of the 4 elites. I've had some solid luck lately at cerb with prims, but ive seen 3 elites in 1200 KC haha
---
The flail is what I had in mind when making this post. I didn't want to say 75 attack because then people would say I was devaluing the bludgeon and complain about power creep, but I don't think the cudgel should be the best one-handed crush weapon since it comes from a mid level boss.
---
Someone had a lil much to drink...
---
A great way to find a 4 man is to join Zalcanohost cc. There is almost always a team looking for a +1. If not just ask and see if anyone is needing a 4th or you could just start a team wait a few minutes while you advertise it in chat. Usually starting a team is very quick. I can find a team in less than 5 minutes usually these ways.

Fuck no this would make shit so easy. There‚Äôs no reason why you should be allowed to have prayers in one hand and inv in the other. Especially when that‚Äôs no where near the case on desktop. F keys still only give you one at a time. You could sit there and pray switch and eat at the same time.

The CoX being safe situation caused controversy, which is why all future content released since then has been dangerous deaths for HCIM (ToB, Gauntlet, Zalcano, probably the Nightmare boss in Morytania).
---
They couldn't retroactively go back and change CoX since it would be unfair, so they instead just decided to make things dangerous for the most part moving forward.
---
*Generally* it's best to keep your strength \~ 10 levels above your attack, and get 99 atk/str before leveling defense. This is definitely true after 75/75/70 (The minimum stats required to wield/wear all BiS strength gear, such as whip/bludgeon/rapier/scythe, avernic defender, etc.).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for the exact path you should take... I'd level attack to 70 (or 75 if you can afford rapier), then strength to 70/75, then defense to 60 (obsidian armor). From there, it'll depend on your training method and current bank. If you can afford bandos, get 65 defense. If you're training via slayer and want to use guthans, get 70 defense. If you can afford avernic defender, get 70 defense. If you're training via slayer, do dragon tasks, AND can afford a DFS, get 75 defense. If you're training at something where taking damage isn't an issue (NMZ, crabs) then get 80 str --&gt; 71 attack --&gt; 81 str --&gt; 72 atk etc. til 99/99 then train defense.
---
It's also worth noting that leaving your defense at 70-75 isn't a terrible idea. It'll still let you equip all BiS armor, then once your attack/strength are 99/99 you can choose between leveling defense the classic way (with melee) or the quicker more expensive way (barraging / chinning). The former is much cheaper but takes longer. The latter is expensive but much quicker. Your bank situation will probably change on your way to 99 atk + str unless you just AFK crabs the whole time, so yeah.
---
Good ol age of empires
---
You make around 500k/h doing bloods, closer to 600k if diary done

It ain‚Äôt worth it bro just spend that money buying seeds
---
The only reason I wouldn‚Äôt want them is because this will make it hard to revisit warding (if ever), since there will be no content for it.

That‚Äôs pretty much it tho. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they made it into the game through other means.

When i was playing as a kid in actual 07, i spents mills trying to do quest like monkey madness, and none of us stopped playing, yes it, was crushing, but hey we all learned to play smarter, and you people are talking about losing gear as if its your damn cars, its a virtual item, get it, risk it, have fun with it.
---
It doesn‚Äôt actually give it to you, just says you would have been followed, I totally would tho
---
Im gonna coooooom
---
So 65 attack -&gt; 60 defense -&gt; 70 attack -&gt; 70 strength in that order? I know that strength &gt; attack &gt; defense, but gear requirements and the escalation in required exp really complicates things.
---
No no no, don‚Äôt alch the pet friend, that spell is for you
---
Only took me 23.1m to get my RC cat

All bones still drop so a bone crusher is a good item to have in nmz curved bones also have a rare chance to drop. Same as normal mobs that drop big bones have a chance to drop long and curved bones as well.
---
Hmm, that's fair. I'm still debating whether it's worth it. I don't know how many hours it would take me to get from 94-99, but it would be a hell of a lot faster and less painful doing blood runes, but less money. There's also soul runes, but they make even less money. 
---
Personally the reason why I opted for runecrafting was the money aspect. I don't have any other way of making that much as of right now.
---
Maybe I will do bloods some days and natures other days.
---
Anyway, grats again but sorry you didn't get the pet.

Farming works off of an irl timer, and there's only 5-9 patches in-game. If I plant something in a spot, until it dies or I remove it, that spot is taken (no one else can touch your spots and they persist across worlds) so depending on what you plant, effects how many runs you can do. Ranarr grows every 1.3-1.5 hours, so if you're doing 40k wines that's (high-balling it) 60 hours you'll be waiting over 40 different runs. You can only do ranarr for this because it's one of the few plants that you profit from when you plant and harvest it. 
---
60 hours may seem longer, but you'll be doing something else for the majority of that 90 minutes. A farm run takes 15 minutes, max. So that's 10 hours you'll actually be doing farm runs for. It's also more efficient in that you can just get osrs mobile and do farm runs throughout the day and pile up the cash then buy the grapes you need.
---
Also, you should consider doing My Arms Big Adventure, because going from 5 to 6 herb patches is literally 20% faster. If you aren't a player willing to do ridiculous grinding sessions, then this mix of efficiency and afk is probably for you. 
---
All in all:
---
You need 12.5m xp to 99. If you want an afk method that's faster than mine, it needs to get more than 150k xp/hr, that's including the waiting for herbs, which you literally don't have to be online to do. You'd need to be level 82 cooking before you have access to afk training that's faster than that and maybe profitable somewhat. Trust me when I say I did afk and profitable methods to 83 cooking and it's pretty dull, you'll burn out and waste time not doing it because you're literally clicking 4 things for 30-48 hours. If you're doing slayer and farm runs you're getting constant changes of scenery with different things to experience and you'll be able to keep yourself invested way longer.
---
In terms of work, this method is much faster and more diverse and since you asked for afk methods, I assume time is no object for you and you are willing to forgoe xp for greater profits.

Lol this reads like a shitpost, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it actually was. Also isn‚Äôt he British? How could he donate to Bernie lmao

Thanks. Good luck go get those stonks.
---
Originality GWD kill count was balanced around this and you were intended to lose your items if you die.
---
Which is perfectly reasonable imo since this game isn‚Äôt supposed to be Hello Kitty Online tier difficulty.
---
But as OP said in a nicer way, thanks to Jagex pvmers are fucking babies now.

Why not an add-on to the DWH?

Bump it up in stats to a tier 70 or 75.

Yeah they do if there estrogen is low, same for men if low t

You're not everyone. Some people have shittier internet than you.

So how does PJing actually work? I'm considering hunting black chins and I read something about running to the hobgoblins southwest if you get attacked so they'll attack you and you can xlog. Are the hobgoblins *guaranteed* to attack? Is it a sure fire way to escape death if I'm able to make it there?

I'm pretty sure the KC was originally to limit how often people could actually kill the bosses rather than a limit on dying because it's harder to get back to GWD in 2 minutes with an ecu key than people think.

Pot-trick whenever you spec, it will increase your chance of speccing them off pray significantly
---
If your opponent isn't frozen and you're standing with robes on without pray melee on, you WILL die against any decent player.
---
You WILL get shit on in the beginning, but just keep at it and you'll hold your own after a bit of practice.
---
When you start to feel more comfortable learn to time your switches to just before you attack, this way your opponent will have very little/no time to react.
---
Thanks man they‚Äôre my 2 favorite skills too :)
---
when you add in that many extra people, sure you shave off a bit of kill time, but you almost half your profits from drops themselves

At minimum with a dhl I‚Äôd have 90attack, and I‚Äôd recomend 95+ attack. And at least 90def with justicar. Or 95+ def with bandos
---
Otherwise it‚Äôs just not AFk enough and you don‚Äôt get enough kills per/hr.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about your acc‚Äôs range level and combat but I‚Äôd range bbd instead. It‚Äôd be way more AFk but slight losss in gp.

Is rigour that good? Should I save 30m and sell the dfw for it?

But something like warding is a better idea than just losing then on death. Invention isn't perfect but it has removed a lot of items from RS3 and warding would have been similar to that. Consuming items for use in other ways is how item sinks should be.

Fire cape req hehe

Sad on his part.

I agree. Weird how his target auto-switched the tile he was standing on also?

That arma lookin' sick as fuck

Sounds like you must have researched for minutes to figure that out. Damn boy. Anyways if they add an actual way that gets you ahead with straight gp like you are saying that's more of a problem. I mean it just sounds like you don't want to play the game anymore. This would not help the game in anyway lol.
---
Thank game
---
i refuse to believe

The clip is cut you fool of a Took.  Just watch the guy hes fighting, hes 10 tiles away, then hes 3 tiles away in the middle of casting barrage.

Funny I was thinking the opposite. By enabling every plugin you miss so much of the game.
---
Torv using auto item swap but his enemy is using tile swap, allowing him to magically teleport.
---
It depends on how you determine best. Cudgel is pretty comparable to Hasta, but the Hasta has more strength so it is probably better.
---
But as others have pointed out, there really isn't room for something better than Cudgel but tied or worse than Bludgeon. My original draft for a 1H Crush weapon was that it would be slightly worse than Bludgeon with Dragon Defender but better with Avernic; I felt like that was a fair tradeoff since Avernic is worth a fair bit more than the Bludgeon. Here were my design notes:
---
* Flail- 74 Atk and 77 Str [Vs Bludgeon- worse with Dragon Defender, ties with Avernic]; Cudgel is +70
---
* Flail- 79 Crush and 79 Str, degrading [Vs Bludgeon- ties with Dragon Defender, better with Avernic]
---
So based on that, something around +78 Attack and Strength would be your best bet. That puts it +8 over Cudgel, which is a reasonable upgrade while being a bit worse than Bludgeon with Dragon Defender but better with Avernic. The Bludgeon is a hard thing to balance around since it is important to keep it worthwhile so Sire is worth doing, but at the same time, it is only a Level 70 weapon from over 4 years ago so I'd say there is room to introduce something a bit better as long as it is balanced.
---
Wow that sounds insane, I'll check it out~

Lol I‚Äôm at 3500. Grats dude

If you want to keep killing Vorkath, I suggest you swap the Earth and air runes for dust and law. Will save you an invy space

Imagine thinking displaying useful information is something we shouldn't have. In this "3rd party client" world you're still just a denier for your own sake and claim everyone should desire exactly what you want.
---
Don't use fairy ring code tool then. You better just memorise everything! Never look up a guide.. or ask people anything.. how dare they provide you information of use!
---
Pretty much every second or third meme on /r/dndmemes is about Bards seducing dragons.
---
Everything in the warding poll already failed a poll.
---
Oh its in woodcutting btw, and my ign is CSandman!
---
It's unlikely we will see major updates to the main client at all, with such heavy engine focus on mobile and things like clans and group ironman.
---
I know you probably won't, but 3rd party usage risks nothing. Runelite is open source. It's there to see for everyone who uses it. Nothing malicious can enter that without it being spotted by the dedicated people who run, maintain and update it. It saves none of your information it just displays the client same as the official one, with overlays and plugins in a sidebar. There is no risk associated, and even if there was one day, an authenticator will easily stop anything happening. As proven by many people by outright publicising their username and password to log into the game and showing that recovering an account through authenticator and a 2fa email is more or less impossible.
---
So give em a go honestly. You'll find there's plenty more nuisances with the official client you've just been bearing with. And any official client elitists are just that, elitists.
---
Agreed. They were already hard enough. If anything they needed to be locked behind 80 slayer, not buffed. The 1 task I need on release took several hours and multiple trips of super restored and runs potatoes with maxed melee gear.
---
Osrs membership is already overpriced
---
Lost connection mid-fight at Skotizo. RIP a bunch of items I guess. Doesn't have to be servers; your ISP could just drop the ball, power could flicker, etc.

Same reason Obsidian Cape and Fire Cape aren't in Tzhaar... No idea what that reason is though.

Damn, and so it was written. 50/50

If you're not on mobile, use this instead of clicking the subreddit

---
While I get that and understand I guess my general hope is that since the items won‚Äôt appear they‚Äôll simply De spawn people would have less incentive to ddos. Sure they could do it out of spite and what not but eventually something in my opinion needs to change. This games core principle is risk vs reward. And as it stands there‚Äôs really no risk to anything besides the wilderness. PvM is already OP for everything and I can‚Äôt see it getting nerfed since everyone always wants the next thing to be a zulrah or Vork money machine. Idk there‚Äôs no perfect scenario.
---
This is a super hero movie I can get behind.
---
Get 65 attack, go to warrior guild and get your defenders while training defense. After 60 defense shoot for 70 attack, then power out strength to the high 70s or 80, and then attack, repeat that style until 99 STR, 90 attack, 75 defence. Then do attack.
---
Defense you can gain reliably through bursting slayer tasks. Which is actually faster than training it.
---
And if you're not 1500 total, 422! Because it's four twenty, too.
---
Im not at all an expert on lore but wasnt morytania a completely different place circa second age? Like its all swampy and full of evil creatures because of the magic and battles that occured during the god wars?
---
Die
---
Not to vital seeing as barrows gloves are good for all styles, and in slayer you mainly use silver bracelets (and unless you wanna hyper focus and swap each kill you just leave em on)
---
Why would anyone take offence for that sultry compliment
---
"Actually fucking knowing stuff is part of the game" 
---
You can't be on both sides of the fence my friend. Either you believe outside assistance through the wiki and by extension third party clients (that pull information directly from the wiki) is ok, or you don't...
---
I don't like 3rd party clients personally, but i have to use them because the original client is so poorly optimized. That's the basis for my question.

All in rng i guess lol

i can hack this thing, but i'm gonna need you to click a link for me that you really won't like. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTW4sIL9Dpw) it is if you're willing to test me.
---
Nah he‚Äôs got a blowpipe in his inventory and doesn‚Äôt have on in his collection log. Looks like he‚Äôs a main
---
Fucking lol
---
This is a game dude. I pay for it. I‚Äôm entitled to not feel ridiculously frustrated after a single mistake because I just lost hours of progress.
---
1/128 isn't your average, it's the universal average, meaning if you collect all the KC of everyone in-game and then that specific drop, on average it would come out to 1/128.  This is why some go multiples X over the drop rate and others get it in the kill.
---
More kills doesn't give you a better chance; this is known as the Gambler's Fallacy.  As per wikipedia, The Gambler's Fallacy *is the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future.* (and vice versa)
---
BUT, what if you‚Äôre a girl on Twitter with 5000 followers?
---
Put the games room next to ge and let us gamble in those games. At least it will take some skill.
---
I'd assume the main reason is it's easier to find 3 other people to do something with than 7.
---
Didn‚Äôt Woox do the inferno without healing or something like that?
---
Hyahyahyahya hahahaw0w

Yeah it only looks so huge cuz each line is 500gp
---
What is the best Zulrah guide? I just want my 1 alc for the diary.  Currently 80s in all combat stats and could spend say 20-30m on gear. I have just never done zulrah so I don‚Äôt know anything about it.
---
Yes that's just the title set for now, that's our clan.
---
Nah, if I ever get them, cool; I'm going for max but I'll never pet hunt. I got Vorki at 350-ish kc but I never take him out.
---
I think they're a good thing, though. They keep otherwise bored people in the game chasing the dragon.
---
/u/uselessnobody
---
Glad to hear it
---
Yeah that's what I did when I went f2p last, get all your gear now and as long as you have a place holder you will be fine
---
There was a post mentioning that but maybe it was wrong. But still, with almost bis gear minus rigour, I get around 20 kills per hour which seems underwhelming.
---
Sweeet. Thanks!!
---
You can tel who are the casuals who barely started playing Lmao. OSRS is so catered to pvmers it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
Ranarrs vs Toadflax??? Who will win in a fight to the death...
---
Can someone make this a complete game? this can be a epic side scroller fan game.
---
no Yew are. Thank you!!
---
&gt;  disconnects are part of the game
---
Yea everyone should have to play in fear of DCing. /s

That's not server lag, that's your own internet.

anytime i step into the wilderness i accept the dangers.
---
that said i vote no on most content because it either seems hamfisted or poorly implemented.
---
there was a time when items just came into the game mostly as rewards for content, and people took those items and built the pvp meta around it, now pvp'ers want content catered directly to their gameplay style and cry like babies when it gets denied even though the majority of the population (i assume) vote for roughly the same reasons i do. poor balance, specific catering and a lack of content for everyone else.
---
imagine "mini-gamers" as a minority, asking for buffs to mini-games that provide specific niche use items (sometimes BIS) for their gameplay that doesn't benefit anyone else besides them.
---
design things for the broad majority, if they happen to benefit or create new metas that aren't unbalanced for niche parts of the community, it's a win.
---
oh and all the shit stirring though fun doesn't help.
---
Jeez man those arma plates, what a steal
---
Asukayens is what I used, but any of them will get you headed in the right direction
---
Or have an Ironman (btw) lose a piece of equipment that could take hundreds of KC to get back due to a DC. 
---
Old death mechanics would be brutal and cause players like me to not want to get into bossing because I don't have very much experience and need practice and could potentially lose equipment I've spent countless hours grinding. I'd be pissed to lose something like the mages book, or to lose a piece from a veracs/guthans/dharoks set, etc. 
---
A gold sink is 100% okay though it still penalizes you for dying but doesn't completely shaft you.
---
I want to go BACK
---
I know, just explaining why they might have heard about 6-7 kill trips. Maybe it's possible with range too, I switched to melee before I got max range gear so I'm not sure.
---
Shame these aren't getting more attention I love the sort of old school comic book vibes

This clip is utter fucking garbage, there's literally no entertainment value unless you saw it live. And self promoting in itself is truly sad, because IF it was a good clip one of his twitch viewers would've surely posted it, like with literally any other streamer out there. Posting it yourself just makes it look like you're desperate. Same goes for sending all your viewer goons to reddit to upvote it.

Idk i looked at the graph again today, they hit 30k sometime in september forget when exactly, back down to 7k at the moment. No regerts on my end for dumping what i had for 30k each, didnt wanna chanse it. At the same time knowing my luck they will certainly hit 100k at their peak before hween.
---
ive died and lost around 500-800k in loot dying to pkers. I set 30 as a slayer task, 16 left and im thinking canceling it

*cries in no ground items on rs3*

Switch prayers for jad attack, click on 1 healer. Switch prayer for jad attack, click on another healer. Do this untill all are aggro on you and then kill jad.

Often enough that I wouldn't risk it personally

I remember in 2017 when blue partyhats got insanely manipulated to like 900k each from 30k so they had to nerf the buy limit from 50 to 5

Someone tweeted @ Mod Ash to nerf the buy limit

lol tart

Stranger is a npc that spawns randomly when you carry a crystal from dt. Its cb 95 and has a dds I think.

No!

He did it with no supplies at all.

server lag is complete trash even on uk worlds. i do some vork every week and i get server lag every other trip

sometimes woox walking just isnt worth doing when the servers are this bad

bring back the old gravestone system honestly

okay thanks

it does 100% in osrs if you die with max everything you keep all untradeables and you have an hour or two to go pick your stuff up with no consequence lol
---
A couple of questions:
---
\- Your grandchildren have only been alive for a small portion of your Runecrafting journey.  How do they feel about your achievement?  Do they appreciate your sacrifice?  
---
\- Regarding your future plans, where do you plan to curl up and die?  At home?  At a TGI Fridays?
---
That's amazing. How do you increase the official GE prices? Don't real transactions have to occur that are higher in price (if so how does that make you money?) or can you just put any buy in offer and it'll increase? (e.g. 1m for bronze dagger on 50 accounts)
---
save the video for me pls and send to jamflex

At the end of the day this is a videogame meant to be played for fun and entertainment. Is it fun and entertaining to lose all your shit because Jagex servers are shitty or some asshat pvp clan is DDOSing everyone? NO. I don't think there's a single MMO in current year that permanently takes all your shit away when you die. Even fucking dark souls lets you get your stuff back if you make it back to where you died. So no, I don't think the death mechanics need to be changed back to the 30 second grave times from 2001 because its an outdated system for an outdated game. People actually give a shit about their stuff now. Plus instanced bosses still exist that don't have a reclaim system and even then you have to PAY MONEY to get your stuff back, so it's not exactly risk free. Not only do you lose the supplies you used, you don't get the loot from the kill and you have to pay 100K to even get your stuff back and not even all instanced bosses have that system.
---
mad

They polled to move him iirc

why cant they run the worlds behind a proxy?

True..

im not talking about pking you dingus

Yes, I am super duper pooper scooper upset that someone as self centered as you is allowed to exist. Your ego is so large it makes you the only asshole visible from space. #mangoes

Or is it mangos? Real question, does the plural of mango use an e or no I need to know.

I feel you man. I'm coming up on 100 raids and i have gotten nothing in my name. An average of 15-20k points per raid, 3-5 mans. 
---
Meanwhile i have an ironman friend with less than 300 kc, he has a tbow, kodai, claws, ancestral top, a dex, arcane, and dhcb....

Same. Im trash at the game. I feel like people dont admit to being bad on this sub enough.

If u pk at Callisto ppl will skull on u daily bro, just get out there more and u too can collect Ur free veracs
---
No one is using AHK , abyss doesn't use ahk there cut clips stop trying to attention lmao
---
Not related to third party clients, but the game itself is from a 2007 backup and thats why the vampire can walk all the way to the patches, it just need to be fixed,
---
Isn‚Äôt Abyss the guy who whined to Weath about an AHK‚Äôer and got called bad?
---
As a shift worker with three kids of under 7 yo i play only, 21.00-23.00 after kids are asleep and if the wife is busy, the commune to work (40mins). I have just managed to get quest cape and most hard diaries in 5 months. You can do it.

You don't need to make up pointwhore excuses in your title.

I went to through the channel to appeal bans.  Not sure if you've done it recently but it then takes you through a series of questions which leads me to a link saying i cannot appeal through social media, emails, etc lol.  but if i spent 50000000 dollars on mtx and then cried about it im sure they wouldn't have a problem posting that
---
Build a f2p pker go like 40 atk 50str 55 range. Easy to make and can just jump each days and do a few fights
---
I legit appealed a ban 5 days ago and got my main back. It‚Äôs not hard. Idk what the Fuck you‚Äôre doing.
---
Yes it is.. I had the same mail.. nothing happened. 
---
I was still very worried though
---
Lets play HCIM just as normal player with items yikes
---
did u do bloods to 99 or only til 90, then souls? Profit vs faster XP which one to take

There can't really be a zalcano world, since it's not like most other minigames where it's the more players the better. Generally you want enough players to kill her in 3 cycles, which means 3 players if you all have very high mining levels, or, more commonly, 4 players. Having more than 4 players decreases the loot everyone gets, while only shortening kill times slightly, and certainly not enough to make up for the decrease in loot.
---
As others said, the easiest way to play is to join cc zalcabohost. Probably 80% of the people doing zalcano at any given time are in this clan, and someone posts a message looking for a 4th player about every 15 seconds.
---
Didn't click the link and I reported/forwarded the mail to: reportphishing@jagex.com
---
I have only played DnD a few times but i couldnt imagine coming up with my own campaign.  I have a weird kind of creativity where I could come up with stuff in my head but implementing it is where id fail.

Phising, real one will start with your username/ingame name

I unlocked boss tasks at 80 combat total and the only ones I remember skipping were Zulrah and Callisto (Callisto because I'd done it before so hit 35 then regretted getting smacked by puree constantly).

Just do it, it's a good way to try new content.

A pmod mute is meant to be used only in few scenarios, serious harashment, breaking rules or spam disrupting other players, in this case it checks out two.

Hey, I'm really sorry you've been having a rough time lately. Just know, (and this is cliche I know) but it will get better. You are wonderful, beautiful, amazing person who is on this planet for a reason. I hope you feel better.

Whats he doing with the glory? Trading?
---
Yeah I had a brain fart when typing that. Realized that afterwards.
---
If you‚Äôre playing on a shitty connection and willingly go PvM you‚Äôre doing so at you‚Äôre own risk. A few people have bad internet shouldn‚Äôt stall the game from feeling actually more like a real MMORPG. 
---
If you‚Äôre pvming during DMM tournament you‚Äôre also taking a well known risk (because people are hitting worlds) and doing that in the first place is silly. It‚Äôs like when a hardcore decides to do Bandos during it and acts surprised when they dc‚Äôd. 
---
Specifically targeted players who get hitoff get hit off because they leaked personal information, or joined a dodgy clans website. Again, players responsibility and shouldn‚Äôt stall potential updates. 
---
This community by and large has lost all accountability and immediately blames Jagex when from the beginning it‚Äôs always been the player‚Äôs responsibility. I‚Äôm not saying mechanics should be reverted to what they were but they really should open discussion to changing something.

I want to try my hand at getting a fire cape, anyone got a good guide they can recommend?
---
Well i dont play that much nowadays
---
Except the recovery system works using past passwords, so...
---
If you're about to tell me you've always used completely unique passwords (i.e., no "system") for every single account you've ever had online, and never re-used any of them, without a use of a password manager since Runescape pre-dates their widespread use, you're full of shit.
---
It‚Äôll come bro I recently just went 183 raids dry for a dhcb w an arcane being my only drop at 50 kc before that
---
Meh, only as to not having them anymore. Like 10k amethyst arrows with ava's assembler basically lasts forever. So it's not a bad thing to lose. Losing the rangers and the teleport scrolls sucks more imo. That's such a boring grind doing 300 med clues for the boots back... Unless you get lucky ofc..
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad it‚Äôs a really hard line to walk and different people react differently to starting money
---
Wtf. Netflix doing a live-action of the Last Airbender is gonna kill it. They already did that with Death Note.
---
Agreed, should probably be based on alch values instead. For most non-consumables, the prices are pretty similar.
---
Just go gain 50 xp lol
---
Dude I know right.... it‚Äôs happened several times now.  Sad!
---
"it's because you didn't understand why it mattered"
---
So you're saying every single online account you've ever owned has had a completely unique password (i.e., no "system"), without the use of a password manager since Runescape pre-dates their widespread use? 
---
If you are, you're full of shit.
---
I was extremely surprised when I came back to the game and saw people complaining about account security on twitter, it took me legit 2 weeks to get my account back from 2011 even though I had all the details (card info, passwords, creation details etc just not the transaction id) 
---
If anything I think Jagex is lacking customer support NOT account security
---
Yeah sounds like you don't need ranged levels, just some more Vorkath kc. At 3k xp per kill you'll get a few levels before you get it down completely anyway.
---
It‚Äôd be cool to see a samurai type spec animation. Something like a 2 handed thrust from the waist or even an overhead arc downwards like the obby maul, representing the Iaid≈ç fighting style.
---
I'd sell the pegs and get blessed boots. Then use the money for other skills.
---
Focus on eating, when I started I didn't know the importance of eating in the 'intermission' stages (poison and spawn) and you'll see your times get better.
---
I've gone 90-96 solely on Vork and it's been great
---
I'd say poor guy but for fucks sake that's just so ridiculous.
---
Imagine being so rich that you just did the opposite of merching and just bought out items and sold them really cheap to crash the market.
---
Somewhere on reddit there‚Äôs an option to add a flair
---
Great, thanks :)
---
I‚Äôve done many post 99 runs sadly
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Wow...this is a pretty great idea... i like how the teleportation would work as some pkers don't have the construction level of 80 to build the obelisk in their gardens... and a staff that could teleport you would be awesome... some account builds would greatly benefit from this.
---
Idk man I‚Äôve been asking him that since the day he put it on. He close to maxing so his thought process is a little broken.

1. What was your first pet (at what kc)?

 4. What pet do you think is the coolest or best?
---
Calisto

 5. Do you hunt for pets? 
---
No
---
Considering he's doing 3-4 man, they're all bound to have roughly 15-20k points each, having 5k points higher doesn't help that much
---
We both took better xp. I mixed in more lava runes from 77-99. Shaved a few days off.
---

---
Pretty sure I can't, but congrats. I can barely get the fire cape done with max stats and some insane OP gear just to get through Jad quick without having to pay attention for too long. Concentration and manual skills were never my strong side.
---
Dude, all 3-4 of them have their own chance of receiving a purple in their name no matter what the difference in points between them is. Tf are you on about?

That is one of the things i did with it

1. Make sure your runelite client was downloaded from runelite.net  
---
If it was from somewhere else, you may have downloaded a version that just takes your login details for hackers.  
---
1.5: Do a scan of your computer with malwarebytes (free) to make sure you don't have anything spicy
---
2. Make a fresh email with a unique password for your new account. 
---
3. Optional: Make another fresh email, with another unique password, and attach your rs account to this new email
---
4. Use another unique password for your rs account
---
5. Add authenticator to your rs account, and a bank pin
---
6. Add authenticator to the recovery email address
---
If you do these things, it is very unlikely that your account will be compromised in future unless you do something foolish yourself.
---
I initially read the title as space guardian so I studied every detail to try and find the space tie-in. 
---
Re-read title. Awesome shit.
---
I have and its marginal on daily but if were playing the long game then ranarrs are better. For me though, I like the xp from snaps and dont care about the extra few hundred k for the massive xp difference. I also have an alt and it makes me just as much(the main has diaries and mory elite so its slightly more daily) as I previously said.
---
#
---
Abyssal bludgeon is only marginally better than Whip and dragon defender, so use those.
---
You'll hear conflicting opinions over guthans and whether off task gargs are worth it.
---
Im usually of the opinion that bringing food is usually better than bringing guthans, because you don't lose DPS from not having your black mask / slayer helmet on.
---
As for off task, that depends on what other money makers you have available and whether you're just using them in your afk time. I'd say that time spent killing them off task is better used actually training slayer which will unlock much better money makers down the line.
---
legit
---
No it's not that easy to hack a runescape account.
---
There are only really 2 options. Either you have managed to get malware at some point, or your email address and password are the exact same as another account you've used in the account which has been compromised.

I just glanced at the image and assumed it was a generic aoe rendering.

If you tried using your brain even just a little bit you could see the clip is clearly edited... but then again that might be a lot to expect from the osrs community on reddit
---
I'd use this at bandos as an alternative to a d hally spec personally. Lots of situations where this would be good.
---
Not sure. Might be YouTube, might be his video editing software.
---
I went dry for the first 170 and basically just gave up. Decided to do two trio raids for fun and managed to get tbow in my name.
---
two options:   
---
give up = never get a drop  
---
keep trying = maybe get a drop

good luck! gz on onyx

That stuff is allowed, they were pretty clear on that. You're talking about plugins, not overlays. They're completely different

In case of africa theyre buying harbors and stripping land clean of resources. Bribing officials and local police to look the other way. They dont really need to flex their political influence in africa cause africa has no politicians lol and its incredibly poor state. They take chump change and let their land be ravaged.
---
I made bank on my first OSRS account when I watched a guy get KO‚Äôd by Dharok and looted all his gear. Then that same trip I got a Guthan‚Äôs spear. I made 13mil that trip. Was so good.
---
Please do, it's so lame.
---
Can‚Äôt blame him. 90% of the time they‚Äôre flying with AP on.
---
Yikes on your follows
---
Let em try. If you use the security features you really have nothing to worry about.
---
This has been the case since the game began. It's still possible to escape.
---
Please man. Dragon darts are a bare minimum requirement. I don‚Äôt know what you are thinking.
---
Great concept. Upvoted. With some reworked details by jagex this could be a nice addition to the game and should be polled.
---
rs3's hcim is sort of like this. Your account is deleted unless you buy the ''revert to iron'' jar at 1000 total for 100k. Sure 1000 total isnt too hard and 100k doesnt take too long to get, but its still a scary first 1000 levels you have to go through. 
---
Would pretty much change the osrs hcim meta because of how many hcims die starting at wt

Those robes are so damn cool. Props to whoever made them

It works but this guy is an ironman and ironmen cant use partner slayer
---
Man I just hit 150 dry myself. Only item is augury so far. I just want rigour. That's it. I'll worry about the other items after rigour.
---
In multi, the majority of fights are decided by which side has more people.  It's not exactly that intelligent to balance for multi when you can just throw more people at one side and overpower by numbers.
---
Duh duh dun dah da da da da da da dunnnnnnn

That method only works with partner slayer which ironmen cant use. Wyvern cleaned finds in the museum for his slay lvls.

First off, we're looking at a binomial distribution rather than a gaussian (bell curve), which means we're looking at a situation where it's either a win or a fail.
---
To use this distribution, you plug in the probability of a win and the number of trials.  The graph then tells you the chance, given that number of trials, that you'll have 0, 1, 2 pets, etc.
---
So for example, if you get 64 KC on Skotizo, there's a 36% chance you won't have pet, and 64% chance you'll have at least one.  At 128 KC, 13% chance no pet, at 192 it's 5%, at 256 it's 2%.
---
So remember, especially for small numbers of kills, you really have to use binomial distribution to calculate the expected outcomes.  Only use Gaussian when you're dealing with huge KC.

But why do we need it? We have bludgeon and cudgel. I don't see why we need one.
---
Not to mention all the people currently risking max gear in PvP where you can actually loot the items if you kill them yet there haven't been complaints about server wide DDoSing since that chap with the saradomin staff got banned around this time 2 years ago.

---
Look again bro that‚Äôs a varrok guard. You already know what this means
---
Nah, one 1/65 kill is 1/65. It is true that like 63% people will get the 1/X drop in X or less kills, but that is a separate thing entirely. You still only get it in 1/X on average.
---
Seems weird? Well, think of it this way. 1/X(in this case, 1/65) IS defined as the average drop rate - you get 1 drop in X kills. However at the same time, the potential for dry streak is not limited. Therefore, if there is a real possibility for, say, 2x drop rate drystreak, 3x, 4x, 10x, etc, drystreaks, which lower the average. Therefore, chances have to be higher in the early end just to balance it out...
---
Spec does nothing if you have auto retaliate on.

Isn‚Äôt this against the rules?

Not that I care, but thought manipulating the market via multiple accounts like this isn‚Äôt allowed.
---
So all we needed was an amulet of m'speak all along?
---
All you need to do is find the correct buy and sell price. But as high as you can and then sell the item as low and find the margin in between.

That is op lmfao wtf

---
I was talking about content that would 99% of the time would kill you if you DC. The 1h timer isn't because of easyscape or getting anywhere, it's about getting back on time if the servers are down or the player DCs. I'd at best support a world wide reclaim system that holds your stuff till the next time you die with a cost. Because the only people who're losing items under a shorter reclaim time are people who suffer DCs by either by shitty Jagex Servers or bad luck from their internet. An item sink shouldn't come from factors they can't control. And DDOSing isn't from people's IPs. Jagex's IPs are also public.
---
1st person VR probably wouldn't happen like that with the general 3rd person way of the game. But using a headset with a phone and some modifications to the way it's viewed has a plausibility of existing if the right person builds it

All I'm saying is you shouldn't be punished for things out of your control. Many people would quit if that happened to them

Hatred for pkers is irrelevant. This kind of clickbaity post has more chance to be the reason why this pvmer vs pker narative exist.

It's just people settling on the laziest argument that makes sense to them.

Remove the teleport and make it 0 pray instead of negative

Ouch. B2b incoming

Nobody is going to risk prison time to rag people for now monetary value. If the items despawn vs appear you‚Äôre naive to think people are going to boot off worlds just for the lols. But I get where you‚Äôre coming from. I just think reclaiming systems in general are silly because that isn‚Äôt really a risk especially when they‚Äôre 100K.

It costs iirc 1m to insure, and then you get your pet back from the same npc for free if you die with it (but will then have to insure it again for another 1m)

You wouldn't lose your void or NMZ imbues unless you chose to sacrifice them for their equivalent GE value in points to pay off the fee. For items such as void they would have to be hard coded since they are not tradeable.
---
Sure. Look at something like Dragon Axes and you'll see the problem is not exclusive to items used in PKing. Despite having an sink in the form of the infernal axe they are coming into the game faster than they are leaving. This increases the supply to the point where it outstrips demand and they crash until they are worthless/hit alchemy price.
---
You may not realise it now but all of the PvM drops are going in that direction. Items such as GWD armour, raids items and zenyte jewellery only command a decent price because there are still people who do not have those items and want them. Then you have items such as barrows gear which, save for a few pieces, have crashed to the point where buying a new barrows piece when it breaks costs the same as repairing it. 
---
Any loss in efficiency due to death costs or using inferior gear would be counteracted by more valuable boss drops due to them leaving the game at a greater rate.
---
No, I don't think any game has this. Rs3 sells you the things through the store. World of Warcraft charges you a fee to overwrite any piece of gear, as long as you ontained it once, black desert online just sells you the fashion gear and it actually helps you level up, other games do the same as black desert online. My idea is just you sacrifice an item for graceful to look different. I don't wanna be in uniform. I want to express myself. Freedom.
---
Yeah, it's currently a little higher than that.
---
I think it would pass. It at least doesn't make killing non-PvPers easier.
---
What's PvPers view on powercreep though? The ceiling that is 99hp might already be a limiting factor, and it's not going to improve by itself

---
Stop talking
---
I don't see how that is leaving out an important detail. We'll likely see a Ruby and Blisterwood upgrade to the flail and it is a fair guess we'll kill a bloodveld given the 50 Slayer req. But beyond the Flail, which is kinda a given for Myreque Quests now, and an Axe, which you could guess from the WC req alone, I am not sure what else we should assume. Since the reward is an upgraded Flail and not a set of Blisterwood weapons, the tree may not play as big of a role as it did in RS3 so it may not have a puzzle attached.
---
Also, the quest does say "you'll come face to face with Lord Lowerniel Drakan himself", which didn't happen until the following quest in RS3. Our Myreque Quests are progressing a bit quicker, with Ranis being killed in Quest 6, A Taste of Hope, instead of Quest 7, Brancher of Darkmeyer/Sins of the Father. So because we already used some elements of Branches in earlier quests, I'd expect Sins will pull some elements from Quest 8, Lord of Vampyruim, too rather than just being a recreation of Branches of Darkmeyer.
---
And based on some comments by Sween of finishing Myreque before moving to the Desert, this could even be the finale; 7 quests with 5 directly Myreque is pretty long for a quest series and not all series will end with a Grandmaster. And while Sins may be lower reqs than Branches, it is still decently high reqs for OSRS Quests. Though he might have meant that Sins is just the next part and they'd want to conclude the series, probably with a Grandmaster or a tougher Master, before going to the Desert.
---
Who's the genius in the picture?

Are you saying the first time you got a fire cape you weren't super excited?
---
If they made it 0 instead of negative they'd need to remove the Abbot Langley master clue step because Ancient staff is currently the only way to get negative prayer.
---
Low levels CANNOT kill them, fuck you talk in bout
---
These things are damn super bosses
---
pvmer hates pker because of a post highlighting that its the only place in rs left with risk..? anyways.. this isnt even about pkers vs pvmer its about losing gp or items. the fact there is no risk in pvm anymore makes it boring and simple. u died? oh well you got 1 hour to go back an grab your stuff with 0 consequence..
---
house tele -&gt; pool -&gt; seers portal is nice too if no cape, it‚Äôs very fast bank with less interfacing than castle wars
---
Yea so when you go dry on something for a long time just think: you're no closer to getting the drop than when you started the grind.

Stop lying, you have 30 merch accounts. "a couple minutes a day"

Obviously no. It's just appearance change. Sacrifice an item for graceful to look different. Do you honestly like that uniform? Would you ever wear it if it didn't have any bonuses? Do you wear skillcapes, treasure trails items, holiday items, and other unique items for the sake of fashion? Well, yes, of course.
---
Farming = grow weed
---
I'd be alright with a t80 weapon after 6 years.
---
Nobody is killing them lmao. Saw two people in the fucking six hours it took to kill my 230. Wasted a lot of money and a lot of time there trying to get the jaw. Immediately relocked them. Fuck that.
---
You see, you're saying something that makes sense in a vacuum.  Multi is not a vacuum environment.  You can literally take significantly more huge barrages if your group has twice as many people.  You can perform significantly worse and still come out on top as long as you have more people.  You can get multiple huge barrages all you want, but that doesn't mean jack shit if 7 more guys rush you and spec you out before you can do anything with your "advantage"
---
You may be able to hit for massive amounts of damage in a single hit overall, but when it's distributed among multiple people it still means nothing compared to the immense burst DPS that having more people gives.  Burst damage gets kills.  Magic doesn't have much for real burst damage.
---
You may see some extremely lucky group barrages here and there, but I can guarantee you that that's an outlier situation and not the norm.  You don't want to balance PvP around multi based on situations created largely from luck.  You don't want to balance PvP around multi in general.  Multi is as unbalanced of an environment as you can possibly have.  That would be like trying to balance weapons in CoD by only looking at 3v6 matches.  That shit makes zero sense.
---
Any advice?
---
Lol right
---
Not when you're pked 10x as often
---
Yea but the jaw might actually keep its value because they made them stronger
---
 When you complete wilderness diaries you get wine of zamorak in noted form from the wilderness. Do you keep this feature when hopping F2P worlds or when membership expires?

---
What does pog mean?
---
It sucks. Luckily even on the 2k worlds the people who pk there are either trash or people who are just learning to pk. 
---
If you bring 2 brews and a dhide switch, you can avoid getting killed like 75% of the time. If you really wanted to you could bring dinhs and bring that chance up even further.
---
Learn some basic flicking skills. Over time you learn when they are gonna put on their AGS or switch to rcb. A lot of the times if you demonstrate that you can predict their switches, theyll just give up. Because they don't really wanna pk. They just want to attack people who don't fight back in the hopes they might have a little bit of loot.
---
And even better is if you bring some basic anti pk gear. You bring a rcb and a spec weapon and the pkers get flustered because they aren't used to actually fighting other players.
---
Once in a while I'll bring an AGS and spec them out on my Ironman.
---
Why not make it a shield? Sword aren't used for defense?
---
Lmao I love how people decided holiday items should still be used to hold wealth, you just need thousands of them now.
---
The plugin consists of the overlays lol
---
I think it is fair to have a cap, but their proposed cap seemed a bit low. Whether we go off alch price or GE price, some items have crazy high values and if you somehow lost them on death you shouldn't have to pay absurd amounts to reclaim. But I'd say if you did lose like 1B in gear somehow, you should at least be hit with a 500K fee or something rather than a 100-200K fee.
---
Whatever the fees are, the goal should be that standard gear isn't that costly; like if you die with a normal Bandos or Arma setup (like 20-50M in grave) I'd say around 150-200K is probably fine. While dying with Barrows and a Whip (under 10M in grave) should probably be 75-100K or such. But if you are in full max tribrid (like 100m+ in grave), it should cost a fair bit. And if you die in full rune (under 100K), the fee should probably be like 10K or less. I'd even say if the fee is less than say 1K (i.e. dying with Bronze) it should be waived unless you use the retrieval NPC, which then should be a reduced amount (e.g. if you die with 1K of stuff, the grave is free but the NPC charges 1K instead of 4x 1K).
---
Also drink 2L+ of water everyday and make sure you are eating enough fruits and vegetables. Maybe even throw in a daily multivitamin. It will honestly change your life.

But he is discussing them before they change

---
osrs taught me english so i guess speaking

This just makes me assume your points are really low. The chance of doing good raids (30k+) and getting only 21 items is absurdly low
---
Make it Hans' head and you'll have my vote

That ironman symbol disappears and reappears randomly wtf

Oh man I'm much more trash. Lv 123 and never even got fighter torso because I fucking hate barb assault

You wouldn't have wanted mine, at your kc all I had besides heads were 3 dragon bone necklaces
---
Imagine not being able to recognize a dogwhistle and stretching it to its limits to make it about Native Americans instead.
---
I‚Äôd vote for it
---
yet another suggestion: make barrows brothers pets for ironmen only so when you crash them they aggro onto you, scream "You dare steal from us?!" and stab you in the ankle for 1 damage
---
Where do these sacrificed items come from? Is there a gravestone I bring all my extra dharok legs to after I die from my bank? Does it come from the items I had on me?
---
Pleanty of people have died at the same time as jad, and guess what, none of them got capes. You have to complete the fight caves without dying and you, in fact, did die in the caves even though you killed jad. You get rewarded at the end of the fight caves not as soon as you kill jad.
---
Yea it ducking sucks. I used to make 240k per day with elite varrock diary daily battlestaves. Yesterday my 120 battlestaves only sold for 960k(120k profit)
---
They done it in rs3 and I believe the reward was using fairy rings without staff, which makes the lumby diary obsolete.
---
So I have no idea what the reward would be?
---
nice. 73 mining rn gonna b fun getting to 99

I played that game for a fair bit and nearly got to ascension one, however it ended up being a bit too hands on for me.

Ok

Doubt it'll happen, there's lots of limitations to get you to just buy mems with money. I haven't played for a while but I was put off coming back because I had enough items to buy like 30 bonds if I wanted, but I couldn't, because they were all in items. Selling but not buying mems items on the ge should've been a thing a long time ago to prevent this, so I doubt they'll do the runepouch thing. 
---
It's a really nice idea though, but it means less money for jagex so won't happen
---
Looking back my childhood might have been a myth. Or i just have the tastes of an old man.

Probably get downvoted to hell but like Jad is **literally** the easiest boss in Runescape, and broadly like gaming as a whole.  Like if you can play Mario 64 coherently you should be able to kill jad.  You select 1 of 2 invincibility buttons (with like a 10 second grace period) and have to attack some healers once.
---
Like jesus how do some people play this game for like days if not weeks of gametime and then find a big red bullsetsponge that you can literally be invincible against too challenging?  
---
Even back when I was a 9 year old I got clapped like literally 1 time because of legitimate lag so the prayers hiccuped, outside of that I just don't see how you could struggle (And that was in an era without like 75% of the OP bullshit we have now like Blowpipe).
---
Like a demonic gorilla requires more effort than Jad.  The new Song of the Elves boss is **way** harder than Jad imo (Not even hard but compared to Jad ya). 
---
Guess I'm sick of seeing circle jerk after circle jerk of "HURRDURR EVERYBODY I KILLED THE EASIEST BOSS IN RUNESCAPE AND I'M 27 YEARS OLD AND PLAYED THIS GAME FOR LIKE 10 YEARS!!11"

By the squares i can tell you are using that guy's guide, check wiki to review your strategy

The most appropriate countermeasures would be 1 min range damage, and 1 min mage damage.

But yes, 10% would be fine.
---
I love this series, tedious! Keep it up man it‚Äôs really enjoyable

Jagex servers are shit, gold sink helps with inflation, and death mechanics could probably use a tax on death. It really isn‚Äôt the minority that the current death mechanics are for. They know the servers suck lol

Karil‚Äôs X Bow also makes easy work of Jad
---
No one cares man, do whatever you like

was this monty python?
---
I mean that's what you are trying to say... that's it's dead content for mid and low levels because your words "no low levels are killing then" when I'm quite literally killing them on a low level alt and so are a huge amount of people.
---
This is the best POH idea I‚Äôve ever seen.

Doesn‚Äôt work, I got kraken pet yesterday. Look at my last post, there is a secret phrase you have to say.
---
I‚Äôm playing a restricted account and I‚Äôm trying to kill an iron dragon for runite limbs without any access to dragon fire protection. What‚Äôs the easiest way to kill them? I don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs slow as long as it‚Äôs doable. I‚Äôve read a few threads suggesting to mage them in melee range and pray melee with a full inventory of food, would this be doable? Thanks.
---
Integrity changes are not polled and they've identified the death mechanics as such in previous statements about them so it's unlikely that any changes would be polled. If they do poll it will be "pick between these options".
---

As I understand it, lore wise that pub wasn't there. Kharyll was an ancient settlement that, if we are using IRL logic, is probabaly buried deep beneath "modern-day" Canifis. We don't see any ruins like with Sennisten, so we have no idea what Kharyll looked like.
---
The ancient teleport is simply taking you to the center of the settlement.

Yes, but it also looks like it is starting to grow back and, assuming he has normal hair growth rate, he might have done it a week for more prior. Looks like the kind of guy that often rocks the shaved head.

Imo your critique is unreasonable

Yeah I tried that way and it ran awfully, but the mobile apk is running like butter
---
Because my opponent who is also a PvPer has lost exactly that much. PvP overall is a negative sum game as a result. No money is made in PvP unlike PvM and Skilliing, it just changes hands.

For PvP to be appealing to those who aren't in the top 50+% of PvP, then it needs to be rewarding outside of this. Especially if you want to encourage PvPers to fight other PvPers and not PvMers/skillers (who ironically are the only way resources enter the ecosystem at the moment, and hence are necessary for PvPers to sustain themselves as a community unless PvPers are going to be forces to spend a significant amount of time moneymaking via. other methods).

If you've ever played sports or clutched out plenty of hard things in other games it should be fine. The fight is honestly extremely easy..I feel like cave dwellers that can't handle pressure situations are the ones that take multiple tries on jad, the same people in battle royale threads that say they get nervous af and shaky at endgame like wat

Everyone claims that anyone can get in by filing a recovery request, you dont need to be an 3lit3 hack3r to dig for a little information and try to use it to for a recovery. Hell someone managed to find my real name, location, and rough age, and were still unable to recover the account.

Damn I think that's a record

I find it hard to believe that runescape hackers are constantly trying to log in with log ins from data breaches, even after confirming they don't work. Like, in your friend's case, he either got really unlucky with timing, or you're saying that after already confirming that the data leak didn't have a runescape account under his email, they tried it again hoping someone made an account on it...  
---
I hate to say, but he likely click something sketchy and didnt admit/doesn't know it was sketchy

I just tried saying that exact phrase and someone logged in to witness it... it was a very awkward moment.

Hunter is good money with birdhouses and chins. Farmings good once you get higher levels for good herb harvests. The best skills for money makers is all melee skills plus slayer. Killing high level monster for rare drops and raiding is the best moneymaker

You could go about it one of two ways. Buy gold ore and smelt it for a loss or smelt steel/mithril for a profit. There are calculators online for skills. Look up a smithing calculator and plug in your current lvl and the lvl you want and it will tell you how much you will need to spend and how much you will profit/lose

I started playing this game within the last year, so I never played with the old mechanics. If the mechanics were reverted to what you describe, I would stop playing. Sounds horribly brutal and unfun.

Yeah, Jagex's security isn't good and they support is shit, so what exactly happened to you? Is your account linked to you Email and have you tired recovering your account?

Blast furnance halfs the amount of coal you need to smelt bars. so instead of 2 coal for a steel bar you need one.
---
thus doing steel bars is good profit in the early levels. if you have a coal bag from MLM its even easier
---
ty everyone

Your statement literally does not support the former lmao. It's also untrue. If the swarm of downvotes haven't suggested it by now, you're really not being smart here. Bye though.

Thats a graveyard dude. Have some respect.
---
Or maybe a buff baby that dances like a man??
---
I'll explain why. The circulating supply is diminishing after the holiday dropping them is over. For example using fictional numbers there can be 100,000 new santa hats created during that holiday period and after the event is removed and the spawn events have stopped that is the cut off point of new supply for an entire year.
---
Then this happens:
---
- Players who did the event or received some of the spawned holiday items have may not be playing anymore or play casually so that supply is just sitting on their accounts in small quantities which does not affect the GE price.
---
- Players invest and sometimes they end up quitting or going on long breaks for whatever reasons. That supply is also out of circulation. Does not impact GE price.
---
- Players who play actively might be accumulating right after the holiday or even during the holiday season at lowball prices and they simply soak up more of the circulating supply at huge discount prices. These players basically got the cream of the crop in terms of return on investment. Much of the supply they own doesn't even have to be sold for them to make a huge return on the initial investment. 
---
- Total supply does not matter because total supply will never be the circulating supply. Circulating supply is usually a small percentage of the total supply. Say there's 1,000,000 of a holiday item in total supply, the circulating supply might be a few percent of that total supply. That small percent is distributed into multiple holders who have their own perception of the value they think it's worth. One person may have 10,000 of that item but they might be selling at a higher price at a slower rate than a person who might have 100 of the item.
---
However you are correct. The amount of supply does increase but the ability to profit does not cease to exist because of the nature of how these items are annually introduced into the game and the huge lapse of supply discontinuation period. Unless there was a consistent drip drip drip of supply on a daily basis we will simply always see this sort of volatility occur.
---
Using an item on another player is better since you won't get stuck on a corner or something
---
I tried recovery my password and they denied it I don't have it moving to my Google I sign in through the account information since the account was only made six months ago

Cool cool I'll look it up thanks!

Yesn't is the best description of their stance.

Right!

So because you're too lazy to do mage training arena, and too cheap to buy one, you want an easier and cheaper alternative?

I dont have a coal bag I just want 70 so I can start doing dragon slayer

I like the idea that players can choose whether to rush for a chance at the rare drop or do it slower and get common drops.

Yeah I helped him recover some of his losses and told him that he would make all of his money back plus some extra since he basically got membership 2 days prior and just started Wintertodt. Although, he did lose a tome he got early on which was pretty rough. It‚Äôs all good though since he‚Äôs a lucky bastard and got another tome a couple days later (when it took me like 1 mil do Post 99 just to get 1 tome). But he‚Äôs super motivated, already has the quest cape and everything now so it‚Äôs cool.
---
Best 99 to get oit of the way. After getting to 80 every skill after that felt super fast

How is this best in slot? It‚Äôs an upgrade like the magic shortbow (i) is an upgrade but it‚Äôs hardly best in slot. It‚Äôs just a slightly better upgrade .... you would get a massive difference if you actually risked bis gear

Drag the placeholder onto the bank tag so it is also tagged. The charged necklace and the placeholder for a partially charged one are different items so you need to tag them separately. It's kind of annoying.

I cba answering the other points bc they were dumb too. I'd like to see a clip of you winning a single lms game.

It wouldn't slow down the pace since you could just switch back to range (offensive) or switch to a diff wep (defensive), or even unequip you mongrel (in the tick after equipping and spec).

Your third argument is dumb too. Though I'm sympathize that your piss jug isn't big enough to satisfy your efficiency. It's already a decent enough one handed slash weapon fuck off with your claim of it being a "troll drop".

It's a safe minigame, yeah. The only thing you lose is supplies, time and your confidence when you miss a prayer and gets 1banged.

It‚Äôs not gonna affect me long cause I wanna use a heavy ballista lol. But it‚Äôs a pointless restriction imo
---
I have a write up about making money to get bonds, I think it might be helpful. Prices might be a bit outdated.
---
------
---
Depends on his preferred methods of making money (bossing, combat, skilling, dailies...). I'll list off a few common ways
---
* Using blast furnace to smelt steel/mith/addy/rune bars. Has a very very low entrance requirement (30 smithing) and can potentially make 400k+ per hour at those levels. Will take a significant chunk of your week play time to make a bond every time, but you'll get some smithing exp and you can get started right away (after knight's sword quest), though getting a coal bag first is recommended
---
* Take the bossing route and rush zulrah/vorkath. Takes one of the longest requirements to get, but potentially gives you 2m+ per hour and is one of the least "boring" methods to grind for gp according to popular opinion. I personally can't stand to do it for long hours.
---
* Take the slayer route and cash in after the mid levels. Gargoyles (200k+, 75 slayer), skeletal wyverns (400k+, 72 slayer), brutal black dragons (800k+, 77 slayer), cerberus (2.5m+, 91 slayer) are all great money makers
---
* Runecraft. This one generally gets a lot of hate for being mindless and boring but I personally love it. It's chill enough to watch a movie on a second screen and you get reasonable exp (for this skill, at least) and GREAT money. Natures (350k+, 44 rc), double cosmics (800k+, 59 rc), double astrals (900k+, 82 rc), double nature (1.2m+, 91 rc), wrath (1.5m+, 95 rc) and double death (1.3m+, 99 rc) are all easy to grind for looong hours if you focus on something else and are among the chillest money making methods imo.
---
* Dailies include mainly rushing varrock elite for a free ~180k per day buying battlestaves. Other tiers also yield the benefit, though less per day. If done everyday it pays for a reasonable chunk of the bond by itself. You can also do herb runs for additional money, among other minor things like buying herb boxes and picking cactus spines
---
* Mining is a notable mention, with ok exp and profit (550k+, 45k+ exp at 61 mining) and scales well until 75 (800k+, ~55k+ exp) doing blast mining.
---
For more obscure methods, check out https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide
---
Just take some methods with grain of salt, as some (like growing saplings) aren't really sustainable in the long run.
---
Literally fighting the urge every day to renew my membership lol. Im trying to spend my free time learning/making music and being discouraged on a bad day is so much worse when I think about the sweet sweet gains I could have been making on my ironman. The game is literally a drug. I know I'll be better for it in the long run though.

&gt; So while it is not the biggest stretch, they are more Forinthry than Zaros.
---
Forinthry was the peak of the Zarosian Empire. It wasn't until Zamorak betrayed and defeated Zaros that it began to fall. It became known as the Wilderness shortly after when Zamorak burned the whole country to ash using the Stone of Jas to defend himself and the Stone against a joint attack by Armadyl and Saradomin. So for almost its entire life cycle, Forinthry IS Zarosian.

If I'm understanding things correctly they said they were only wanting to crack down on things that make the game quicker or easier one example being eliminating 2 mouse clicks to one with menu entry swapping and some other stuff. There's a few yt'ers that have covered it lately too

Im currently at 11kc but i feel like im being extremely slow

I remember as a kid when it came to picking high detail (human) or low detail (skeleton), i thought it meant i could be a skeleton as a player... so i picked low detail. Oh how disappointed i was i couldn't be a skeleton...

The technology of this 13 year old client is far superior to Jagex' current one.

Nah i'll say keep them as is, still super easy and afk. Just takes a bit longer to kill than before, helps the price of the jaw stay higher which is a good thing for med levels who actually kill them instead of crying on reddit.

Hi, my account was falsely banned this April. It was hijacked at the time. I didn't commit the action that led to the ban. The hacker already appealed for the ban so i can't do that anymore. I've tried contacting Jagex via twitter and no luck there. I just wish they could check the login IP's so this issue could be resolved. I've spent over 2500 hours and paid over 200 ‚Ç¨ for memberhsip. Any ideas what i could do?  RSN: Fabiaano

Appreciate the advice! I definitely agree that restricted accounts are al about strategy, however I never ended up killing a single metal dragon on my main as I blocked them instantly so I have no idea what I‚Äôm getting into. I‚Äôm not sure if you can do that strat in the catacombs but I‚Äôll give it a shot. It‚Äôs a Zeah only account, been playing it since February

Those robes look dope. Maybe they could be inferior to Ancestral robes stat-wise, but have a set effect that buffs healing from the Sanguinesti staff and blood spells?

Except if you're doing DT why not use the clan wars teleport?

You do them both at the fire altar so it's the same banking time

Love how you generalize like every single ironman started the second it came out and been playing nonstop since then. I just started my first ever ironman/osrs account 1.5 months ago and having a blast. Sorry the game has gotten stale for you, but its new and exciting for me with so much content to do. Yes I do agree if I play the game nonstop for 5 years I will probably be maxed and max gear, but hey any game gets old after playing it nonstop for 5 years. OSRS also has the disadvantage of not wanting to add much content to ruin the feel, so I suggest you try leagues when it comes out, or a diff ironman mode like UIM
---
Options?

Start this out by saying I had never beaten Jad prior to this year. I was in a high level PVM clan where one of 3 requirements is a fire cape (Barrows Gloves and 100 combat are the others). You can be in the CC without the requirements, however you won‚Äôt gain rank and may not boss or attend events with the clan These guys and girls regularly do ToB, Cox, Corp, you name it and were very good at it, showing their loot on the discord almost hourly. Needless to say Jad is not a challenge to them. It took me 4 try‚Äôs to beat Jad and when I finally defeated him and told the clan, they went ballistic in congratulating me. They were awesome and understood how important it was to me. I think they also remembered how it felt for them.
---
TLDR: got fire cape and everyone was very congratulating and encouraging, despite how easy it is.
---
Oh, had no idea
---
A MANCHILD
---
Honestly if this was to be an upgrade I‚Äôd suggest the buff be +5 for the magical attack bonus only and it would remove the ability to auto cast. This would retain the need for the wand as the best auto casting weapon for people doing pvm and magic training but make the staff the 3rd best for PvP behind SOTD and kodai respectively. 
---
Perhaps it could also become better as a melee weapon with the addition of the crystal, increasing its crush bonus by +10 or 15 and increasing its strength bonus by 2 to 5. This would make it slightly worse than the granite hammer. But the rarity of the ancient crystal coupled with the power of the staff would keep its price pretty high (at least 2 mil) so it couldn‚Äôt replace the granite hammer as a training weapon. It would also have DT As a prerequisite anyway. 
---
Without the melee buff it‚Äôs enough for sure. I wouldn‚Äôt want it to be the price of a good plus one like SOTD; rather i would want it to be a few hundred k. Would be super cool to see a high powered staff that is between the SOTD and the ancient staff that is actually viable for use in the wild. It could be used by medium to high risking PKers (800k-2m+) or be a plus one for pures.

Took me about 3-4 tries. The 4th time was the first time I tried using the f1-f4 keys etc to switch and I beat it in 1 try.
---

---
Lots of great tips! Thank you. I will take a look
---
Mate, that egg into tp got me real good.
---
He gives you line 1k gp for each one as well.
---
incorrect, it would actually pass for that reason. there is a huge community of people who hate pvpers and as such downvote any content they have. so tjhings that help pvmers in the wild are definitely welcomed.
---
The total value for the amount killed hurts my soul
---
IMO all staffs and wands should be autocast, autocast is a dumb way to balance anything.
---
They really don't lol tbers either use water/mud staff so they have entangles too or if they want a better weapon they use a toxic staff/trident, which both give +25 mage attack.
---
The fact that the toxic trident costs roughly the same as a master wand means that master wand has already been power-crept out of relevance except as a component of Kodai.
---
Atm the choice is to use an ancient staff and risk 70k for +15 or use a swamp trident for +25 and risk 5m. Adding an ancient staff upgrade with +21 that costs 250k-1m would not significantly devalue any existing magic weapon.
---
A somewhat similar situation was created recently with the Sarachnis Cudgel; it was added as a slightly worse but more accessible 1h crush weapon compared to the zammy hasta and it hasn't caused meaningful power creep of any sort or caused the hasta's value to drop. Obviously the hasta has uses as a stab weapon and a lance component but that's just another parallel to the master wand since it is a Kodai component.
---
Can't you just display that on the page? Is it a variable number? Currently if I visit the page I have no idea what the "optimal" number is so I'd have to plug in random combos until I found it.

Would've costed you nothing to not post this.

---
This isn't a comparable analogy, as neither are used in PvP. PvP is *built* around risk vs. reward. Again all this does is reduce the risk and raise the chance of the reward.
---
Regardless of how widely used the master wand is, it *can* be used. And if it isn't, it's because it's too expensive. If it was 200k people would use it. So just creating a new 200k item with better stats is just powercreep for no reason.

That's reassuring to hear. Yeah, I guess the dds is an extreme example, since hitting double 48s is 1/2401, if we assume 100% accuracy. If that happens, I suppose - congratulations, you've won the lottery

With clients you can tag items that you use often with tags like that. Then you search for the tag and it comes up w all the items you have tagged with that word. Nice for gear/inv setups for bosses and clue scrolls too

I started using it because the default one was annoying. They had the orange one but it didn't look as good.

Then that is the answer, you don't need more than .6 seconds to fullfil its purpose.

2004/2005, can't remember exactly but there was an advert for it or something in an issue of Toxic, which was some shit magazine for kids in the UK.

Considering how rarely used these items are I don't see any immediate drawbacks of it's properly implemented so that the item that combines them holds value. Might give a good buff to the value of the warrior ring too

If you're smithing addy platebodies at Varrock naked you run out of run after like 25 trips at 75 agility. With graceful you get enough run energy back while smithing that you never run out of run.

Working tech will be the first target of the second faction.

This ring would still be outclassed by the berserker ring. So no it wouldn‚Äôt be broken.

* Combo eating: Eating multiple food/hp restoring items in a single tick. Commonly shark/manta -&gt; Karambwan -&gt; Sara brew -&gt; Guthix rest. Normally you can only eat one food every few ticks but these food can be combo'd together to heal a lot of HP. 
---
* Vengeance(venge): A Lunar spell that rebounds 75% of the next attack you are hit by. Taking off one's armor makes you more likely to be hit by your opponents next attack, which means you can more likely proc vengeance. Comboing this with an AGS hit is very powerful since you can easily rebound 20-50+ damage on a good roll.

So anyways; OP is getting shredded by his opponent and says "fuck it" takes off his armor, venges up, combo eats and goes in for a yolo AGS spec
