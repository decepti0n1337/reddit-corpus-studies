You're just putting the reward on the account that would normally receive it, sorry if I worded it badly. Not really trading it because I assume the prize would be redeemable on the main account only.  The sentiment is the same though

Yea Zalcano is not bad you just have to be careful so that you don't get comboed out if you hit a lag spike while in a bad spot. It's easy to not die but for HCIM who get that far that's a lot of hours to risk so you gotta safe up.

---
Corrupted Gauntlet is actually insane though lol there's a pretty high cumulative chance of death at least once across 100s of attempts even with maxed stats. Wouldn't dare try it on HCIM.

Yh 'cause it initially sounds sarcastic. You might have more success gradually building them up. I like to begin with a "nice one!" or "grats" and then follow up with a question about what their next plans are. "Oh nice, do you mage any monsters/bosses?" ... "Now that you're 99, what's your next goal?"

If OSRS shuts down, it's only a matter of time until near-perfect emulation servers you can self-host show up. There are already some, albeit incomplete ones; if the official servers shut down, there will be a lot more interest in making one as complete and as accurate as possible.

I'm just worried for the people that do end up losing their stuff, however rare the occurance, because it's already extremely difficult to get your acc recovered without being on the front page of Reddit - and it seems like it's going to be even stricter. I am overall pretty happy with the changes.

Look up how to safe spot in the slayer only area. Did many tasks that way. Just gotta re-agro about once a kill.

Its your outfit dude

Fuck you OP I just started laughing in a theater.

Can you, yes. Will it be fun if doing solo, no not really.

Get a team together if your able to and go for it!

Yeah definitely. Probably only 1 kill a trip though

I did 3 with 75 base stats. It wasn't hard but you get hit a lot.

Nice long thread of an assumption.

I voted no to all recolors because i don't like the idea of ornament kits to BIS gear be essentially discontinued items post-league.

But yeah, rage on mate, polls are fine the way they are.
---
EDIT: 1.5B bank, no to limited-time-soon-discontinued ornament kits
---
I think that's part of why you aren't getting higher rates. I am 99 combat. I generally get 70-80k xp with your setup, more depending on how diligent I am. No prayer, super combats, and absorptions. Generally I sip the potion after 8 min. I use Runelite to set reminders. But you're right, you can't stay as long. 3 hrs is about the absolute max for me anyway.

No. I imagine they just added it for f2p.

That's literally the case for my ~2100 total alt, the ~five days before it was banned for macroing major it was logged in for about ten hours or so in those five days and all the time alt was logged in, main was too.

---
I mean if you want a step by step walkthrough, google Oziris' Ironman Guide V3.
---
If you want general goals to work on, then work towards starting regular Kingdom of Miscellenia, Birdhouse runs, and Farming runs, because those are repeatable events that provide valuable resources. 
---
Another goal would be to work towards Recipe for Disaster, to unlock the best gloves and do a lot of important quests along the way.
---
Some common early activities for ironpeople:
---
* Getting 50 Firemaking, then going to Wintertodt till 60 Woodcutting (for WC guild, ~89 FM, and a lot of good early loot).
---
* Unlocking Ardy Cloak 1 for an easy teleport to spirit trees, fairy rings.
---
* Getting 50 agility via quests (to 37) and 74 fishing via barbarian fly fishing (1-23 quests, 23-58 fly fishing, 58- ~74 barb fly fishing).
---
* Getting a lot of GP via blackjacking (cakes/fruit stalls, quests to 45, blackjacking for the rest; **unlock Rogues outfit at 50 agility and 50 thieving before going forward**). You need GP for Kingdom, for buying runes, etc.

The account recovery process for jagex support is quite decent actually at least in my experience. I've always gotten a response within 12-18 hours after submitting an appeal for long lost accounts

This is the best option; this reason you can't take the bedsheet out is it was only designed to be used within port phasmatys, various objects, npcs, etc all have been given exceptions/cases for it. In the main world it would likely cause, at the very least, graphical bugs, as well as because it transforms you into an NPC, hide what you're wearing.
---
Coming back to this now, what are your thoughts on the changes they posted in the blog today? Seems like they're listening to players.
---
I didn't play the beta myself but I'm interested in what you think.
---
Work towards barrows gloves.  At the end of it you'll have a very good account ready for slayer!  Some people do 99 firemaking at wintertodt before gaining hp, but you won't miss much if you decide to do it later really.
---
Also, focus on getting your herblore up with farming consistently.  Use all lamps on herblore is my recommendation
---
what
---
U pretty much want 90+ range before using any ranged combos. With combo and triple eating it just doesn‚Äôt hit enough fast enuf to kill any one decent with 80 range. Gmaul is still king on pures though

Then what's up with forest floors? Enough canopy cover makes them indoors I'd bet
---
Woo wooo wooooo!

Did you play any of the events pre eoc? They were all better than any we've recieved on osrs.
---
If a bitch hits me I'm putting her out cold
---
I think it's still worth selling a decent amount though, at OP's stage in the ironman 10m cash is still worth a lot. Early-midgame iron getting cash can be quite difficult especially if you want to upkeep kingdom and train some buyables. It's only after ~75-80 slayer that cash starts becoming a non-issue.

I've always assumed banknotes aren't just IOUs, but that banks have the equipment or ability to actually store an item in paper. Otherwise being given noted items, or alching noted items, just doesn't make sense. So I guess they can do that to bank things, too.
---
Related note, I remember from 2009-ish there being dialogue in Rimmington mentioning that player-owned houses are actually in a tiny shrunken-down space to make affordable housing. I can't find dialogue on *either* wiki referencing that, however. I don't know if that means I'm misremembering, or it was removed, or it just wasn't properly documented.

Even if your email isnt compromised hackers can still recover accounts just by impersonating you with your information, a delay would prevent this. Or Even having whoever deals with recoveries check if the account is actively used. There's been too many streams where people will literally get hacked while playing on there account. Something should've been implemented a long time ago.
---
Thank you really much :)
---
If I was a jmod, I would call myself Mod Erntimes.
---
Tl;dr: they're less than 500k/hr for a maxed main. 
---
Probs not worth it for you. If you don't bank bones, these are about 3.1k gp per kill, and they have 130 hp. For comparison, gargs are 105 hp and are 4.15k per kill. Ignoring the difference in defences between the monsters (which are negligible if you are 90+ attack), then these two factors alone mean you'd be earning about 60% of what you'd normally get at gargs. Gargs are, what, 1m net profit per hr (not including ppots for piety and super combats which are about 150-200k), so these would be about 600k (and minus 150k-200k for supplies), so 400k-450k per hr.
---
It's hard to say since I sold them on so many occasion. I'd say it was well over 3m-4m scales easily ;)
---
Holy crap that's some crazy RNG, hopefully you'll get it soon my friend I do not wish anyone to reach this amount of kills to get the pet!
---
I see xp rates being similar to dmm, maybe 3 or 4x 
---
Not the hardcore 10x though.
---
Also 250 runs will take like 125 hours for most people due to experience and the average raid being 30 mins, max 40 due to gear restrictions
---
Yeah, misleading title.
---
Thanks man(:
---
I'm sorry if I misled you friend, I hope I didn't ruin your day!
---
&gt; will not debate these types of bans on our forums, social media or any other method of communication.
---
Specifically states it regarding other forms of communication, not the appeal system. And this also gets ignored, as they do frequently engage with pleas on reddit.
---
As someone who has a previous appeal on a permanent ban for account trading, i'm 100% sure my appeal was reviewed because it had very specific JMOD comments that made me sure they actually reviewed the account before the verdict.
---
They can and will review appeals to serious offences, but with FP's it's a difficult problem to solve. On one hand, issuing bans is important as it helps to keep the game clean, and everyone who gets banned would gladly lie and do whatever they can to get their account back. On the other hand, FP'S do happen and innocent players get punished. So when it comes to unbanning FP macroing bans, there's very little that anyone can do, Jagex sees what they see, and when someone asks them to "review" it, there's not much new they can do.
---
Admittedly, yelling on reddit works because it elevates the issue into stratosphere, i think their support is fine, with FP's it's just a very delicate issue that simply doesn't have a perfect solution.
---

---
Yeah I undesrtand how you feel, I almost gave up at 10k but kept on going. When I got it I couldnt believe it lol, took forever honestly.
---
I mean, name me a skill that ISN'T problematic to some degree. Would you prefer people trying to fletch an arrow, sending wood splinters and feathers everywhere, or flipping a goddamn pizza right in front of the bank booth? The only thing that I can think of as moderately acceptable would be enchanting jewellry, but the magic sounds, incantations and the glows must get grating after the 150th.
---
Very misleading I‚Äôd recommend to change the title
---
At least 2 gp
---
The core point was that you're treating a lot of skills as individual when they exist in combination with other things.
---
There aren't 23 skills - maxing hp is free if you're maxing the others.
---
Combat skills will largely be maxed in the process of maxing slayer.
---
Cross training opportunities still exist like high alching while training something else.
---
3t woodcutting at willows will be the real peak woodcutting xp/h at 370k, have to revise it down from to a grueling 35 hour grind, not counting any gains made at wintertodt
---
You've made two horrifically bad assumptions in your assertion that maxing is impossible:
---
1) Average xp rate for skills is 40k official/120k with twisted league boost
---
2) Each skill will be trained individually
---
Your assumptions suck and your conclusion is completely unjustified
---
We can see very clearly when an account is an alt, there's no need to worry if you're not doing anything nefarious

As that website there are many similar and, even though the owners say its fair, there's a huge chance they are lieing, same as the gambling bots you see in runescape.

What I'd advice you to do is to get maxed account and gamble in the sand casino as the odds are closer to 50/50.
---
Ultimately if you think this is an issue that affects you in real life, you should definitely look for help as addictions are dangerous and should be threated as soon as possible as it might hurt you in the long run.

I would've appreciated just getting my accounts back. No need for extra membership or anything.
---
Instead, they sent me this cheering E-mail:
---
"After a comprehensive review of this account, there is no evidence to suggest the yeet was applied in error and so will not be returning this account to play.
---
Our decision is final and any repeated attempts to appeal this yeet will be denied."
---
'Comprehensive review' my ass, you didn't do jack shit. Because if you did, you should've noticed that I did not bot. No other software was used than osrs vanilla client. No other actions than completing Romeo and Juliet, Sheep Shearer and Cook's assistant + trading my main for cash and supplies. (These accounts were supposed to be my merching alts)
---
It makes me even more sad that even now when the topic is hot, I can't expect to get my accounts back, since they won't look into repeated attempts of appeal. 
---
Thanks a shit ton to whoever just decided that I was a bot, without even looking into it.

Does cannon take into account % stat boosts and invisible boosts (slayer helm, salve ammy, void, arclight etc.) when calculating accuracy?
---
For someone flaming others for not doing any research, you havent done a lot of research. Jagex has already confirmed that all drops will enter the game in their processed form (lance and ferocious gloves), all drop rates will be made more common so you can stop crying about lance being unobtainable, the first tier of relics will be *significantly* less powerful than the following tiers. Given that one of these buries bones automatically at 4x xp rate i'd say you can expect some insane boosts from the tier 5s. Finally, they have continually said they want to shake down the meta, what makes you think they wont add additional drops or resources to surprise people? They don't want you to theorycraft 2 months of playtime they want everyone to have a new experience. Stop acting like you know more than the game developers when theyve been intentionally vague on the details of the mode, if they say it's possible to max, someone will max.

Move all portal rooms to the north side of the entrance portal. Most useful directly north, 2nd useful on the NW, 3rd useful on NE.

Quest hall directly on the east side of entrance, rotated in such a way that the glory is mounted on the north side of the west wall.

This makes it a 3x4 house, which i think shares the same load time as a 3x3 house
---
Where is fossil island?
---
Corp i think aswell
---
&gt; if they say it's possible to max, someone will max.
---
Actually they said clearly not all challenges are achievable, and that its impossible to both max skills and grind all raids, meaning its more then likely NOT possible ot max becuase in order to max you need to do combat.
---
Also, its true, i DIDNT know that items dropped in 'processed form', but NEITHER DID ANYONE ELSE WHEN I ASKED EARLIER THIS WEEK IN ANOTHER THREAD: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dkxdk1/twisted_league_questions/

Nice

Void melee helm would help with the bgs spec

13 jugs of wine and grapes... why no 14
---
People who like to do it anyway, of course.

There are a lot more sophisticated skull tricks than that. What if you want to fight back? Are you supposed to right click every time you go in for a spec? That puts you at an extreme disadvantage which isn't fair when you're already at one. I don't have that strong opinions on skull-tricking but your logic isn't sound
---
I mean if hour concern is slayer xp without combat, jad tasks give 25k extra slayer xp at the end so this should give at least that
---
Would like one as well.
---
TL;DR?
---
Sorry let me be more specific,  violence (as retaliation in this specific case within the context of the post we are right now commenting on at this point in time on Reddit r/2007scape about a woman hitting a man) is never the answer.  *Please note statement is not applicable to Nazi invasions
---
&gt; I could just go to a casino and win real money
---
That's not how casinos work
---
3: She just got skull tricked.
---
Tbf I'm sure the clerk is aware of the capabilities of spirit trees
---
Tip: if you let go of your space bar during dialogue you can read what is said!
---
True, maybe my suggested xp is too low, I was trying to be conservative not to disbalance the slayer system. Killing Jad requires already a relatively high combat level, but penance queen can be leeched at lvl3.
---
If I pull that off, will you die?
---
I thought he said he just picked it because it's not too big and not too small and just absurd enough. Do you have a source for that? I read the Wikipedia page on it and can't recall seeing that explanation.
---
A lot more than you‚Äôd think
---
Nice casual racism
---
With how decked-out in BiS gear flag runners are in castle wars, this is absolutely true.
---
You do realize the Auto-retaliate feature exists right? If you don't plan on fighting back, simply leave it off (or just hide player attack options like when you pickpocket ardy knights) and you will never retaliate and skull on someone. If you want someone to initiate the attack first, let them, and you'll automatically retaliate with whatever you have equipped, thus attacking them while not skulling.
---
I live In Texas if you hit me I can shoot you.

Thanks so much for answering!

House tab, tele to house runes and a lyre? Just bring runepouch and move ur house to relleka my friend or put a Lunar isle teleport on ur poh and get kicked out there after banking

is this an ingame feature or do you need an app?
---
King, I appreciate your effort in creating this original content meme. I was very impressed with the humor used and you have put a smile on my face. I encourage you to continue making these posts for others to enjoy. Chief out.
---
why is the woman hitting me?
---
I fucking love this
---
Good job, King. Farming is not a skill I enjoy at all, so I truly respect those who put the time and effort to level it up, let alone max it.
---
I love this
---
yikes
---
There's nothing political about having every relationship in game be straight because that one time you made a rainbow scarf people started holding mock kkk rallies. That's because aknowledging lgbt issues is political, and therefore never aknowledging them must be apolitical. Now excuse me, I need to finish Song of the Elves, where I participate in a civil uprising and re-establish a council, so I can get away from thinking about politics in my video games.

A plugin that paints a symbol on top of his game absolutely won't trigger any detection systems lol
---
It's definitely 1/35
---
part of the issue is that jagex has added a random 5 second delay on responding with highscores API data
---
~1.5 years ago now they forced highscores api to be https only, and at the same time they added a rate limit. so after ~100 requests in 5 minutes rather than getting the highscores data as soon as you ask for it, it goes like this
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
you click update on cml
---
cml asks highscores api for your info
---
jagex gets request for info
---
**artificial 5 second wait**
---
jagex gives cml your data
---
thats the reason for most of the slowness with updating, the reason for other pages being slow is just because the code is old and inefficient and its hosted on a cheap server since its not that profitable
---
Yay 3 herblore!
---
projection, english
---
Or didn't enjoy it.
---
You wont get your stuff back. You should probably change your password, bank pin, set up an authenticator on both your account and email. Also change your email password and any other linked emails.
---
Looks like it was pretty easy for the hacker to get into your bank pin so did you get phised? If a hacker logs into your account and they dont know your bank pin they will have to go through thousands of combos and wait the alloted times to get in. Of course you used something common like a birthday which most people use.
---
Thanks for the heads up, Chief. Although your message was not personally directed to me, you made me find an opportunity to learn and better myself. With kind regards, Champ.

What
---
Amazing best post on this sub by far
---
Also agility
---
Make sense, thanks for reply. Ddnt knew they had API for the highscore always thought the sites scraped the data xd
---
It really is weird how often guys on this website make up these scenarios that won‚Äôt happen to 99% of them just so they can fantasize about hitting somebody significantly weaker than them.
---
skillers would finally have a way to train slayer
---
That's runescape 3. You just assumed the worst lol.

yea now that you meantion it.
---
i got a few problems with this
---
1) membership is already micro-transactions, people use it to acquire GP through bonds
---
2) if it was content that provided an advantage it would be p2w
---
3) if it was content that provided no advantage it would be better put into the game where people pay for membership to get it and it can be given stats
---
Both are.
---
Holy shit man, gz that‚Äôs a grind for sure
---
Ikr! Op is a stinking liar!

Bought a potion at GE price for 9.5k, not sure what his stack was but it showed it was worth a little over 100m. I had always thought that shown price (in trade) is the same that is charged at GE, and that scammers would try to use items that never sell at those prices, had no idea that prices shown in the trade screen can be different than the GE default price
---
oh, I thought you used real money at casinos? They must be different where I live.
---
Actually that was nightmare zone. On release jagex cornered the market on flax and ess with the nightmare zone, then realized how ridiculous that was the spammed them onto every possible drop table.
---
Dark crabs not so much, black chins probably annoyingly often, I tried it 3 times and never got more than 25. I was probably very unlucky and peak times etc, but it shows you won't be left alone there.

---
How much more xp are lavas than zmi? I‚Äôm currently trying to get 77 and this 30k an hour is killing me lol

every skull trick in the book is countered by attack option hidden and auto retaliate off. There's literally no reason to add anything else.
---
Doesnt it only have 5 uses per day?

Nowadays women have every opportunity to do what men do it‚Äôs just our common interests are different. Any woman can work towards being an astronaut, mechanic, builder, electrician. Any ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù job they want. Yet they‚Äôre still oppressed? No women do no want equality, they want superiority.

I see you got steam installed. Say goodbye to your account.

Yea it's on rs3 page but who else would they be talking about when they say membership alone isn't enough to keep the game growing?

the entire base of a gambling addiction is to WIN. you dont get addicted to gambling from thinking youll lose. The OP said, i dont buy gold, that would be stupid because I could just goto a casino and win real money.

But who the hell farms gold on rs3? why would you farm gold on rs3 on an account which is used primarily for osrs? Also farming gold on osrs is far more profitable than rs3. It doesn't make any sense.

The tree just sits in the corner, theres no reason he would walk past it when going to/from/between banks and the GE booth. The only thing I can think to kinda explain it all would be he's a new banker with limited experience and/or he's never worked on the side of the GE that faces the spirit tree.
---

Yeah doesn‚Äôt work on my iphone XS either

Cunt you have asbergers

If you aknowledge that, then you also realize that the whole equality debate is flawed. Women should absolutely have the same rights as men in Justice, law, politics and All that. But because we have different physiques some jobs Are just better suited to men. That doesnt Mean that women shouldnt or cant do the job. But when jobs, political positions and Even leader roles Are given to someone just because its required by law for "equality" rather than being most qualified, thats bullshit.

And that goes both ways

How long did this take you? If I were killing thousands of goblins, I don't think I'd stop to do the clues. Or did you just let your cannon go wild since easy clues are done within 2 minutes?

One of those is missing the picture, the other two are on point, especially the one with the flowers

Bannable, technically in a sense kinda because they ‚Äúwarned‚Äù about it. But is it enforceable, not even close. Jagex has no ability to actively detect menu entry swapper.

Not an Ironman. Finished the quest though. I collected about 400 cowhides to tan and got to level 28 crafting and made the complete ranger f2p armor. Hard leather body and leather stuff
---
I had about 25 health now, so it was easier.
---
I went with ranged armor, a couple of low healing stuff and just ran in and ran out when I'm being attacked.
---
The best solution I found was to just wait behind one of the pillar things and wait for Delrith to go out of the cultists' range. I finished the quest though.
---
You probably won't read this, but I'm a huge moron as well. I only learned after that this wasn't the quest I was after. I thought this was the quest that gives lots of smithing XP. Turns out, I was wrong, I finished both quests the other being (the knight's sword) which was the actual quest I was looking for.
---
I also learned making pies are a gem. Will cook more of it in my next battles.
---
Thanks for the advice though from all you guys! The biggest reason I couldn't finish it was just because I was an idiot. So I'm really glad you all accomodated me. I thought I'd be downvoted to oblivion for not just working my stats to like level 40

I got 3a range top back in 07 on the main game. So cant complain. But thank you :)

I honestly loved the idea of the gauntlet. It takes no supplies to do or even any armor. You walk into it and make everything you need during it. everything about this is profit and its amazing.

I remember traveling to Karamja to talk to Sandy Claws (?) and doing that holiday event  and getting the reindeer emote/hat and being over the moon. The holiday events used to inspire that holiday feeling, tremendously with the Halloween events because it reminds you Christmas is near. 
---
Sorry, had to be nostalgic and reminisce. This holiday event itself wasn't anything amazing, but it got the job done. I think the real great feeling is seeing other users all dressed up.
---
For me personally its the other way around. Whenever i fail to kill someone they start bombarding me with insults and shit like that. And when i do kill them i still get insulted
---
There's even a quest in which an NPC comments on a man going to the toilet and taking forever to return.

at least you're only losing gp instead of real money, but you need help

Save it.

Nani?
---
What are some of your levels? And goals for your account?
---
Hi everyone,
---
Thank you for liking the idea.
---
I add a tl;dr version to the post and I edit (in blue text) part of the suggestion that were problematic or missing. 
---
The point of this idea is to make alternative way to train runecraft and also making it more diverse. This idea came to me when I saw that only cerberus boots (primordial, pegasian and eternal) were the only items who required runecraft to make them. Also, some staves (battle, mystic and god staff (Mage arena) are litterally useless. The god spells, who are supposed to be very powerful, are very underwhelming (even with charge on). So, by imbuing them, the damage cap could hit 40-50 (with all the boost items) to compete with the other spells.
---
For the runecraft training, talisman and altar tablet could help the players. The help won't be huge since it would devalorise the achievement of others. But it could be a nice alternatives instead of the traditional rune making.
---
you would think they would let a human screen the ban(ESPECIALLY on a new system) _before_ you go banning
---
Yup same here.
---
Buy somethin' nice for yourself
---
Maybe stock up on some supplies for leveling and upgrading what gear you can. Buy hella food so you don't have to for a while. Even donating 1m to a noob would make their day too

OSRS started as a server backup of the game from 2007, hence 2007scape. However, it‚Äôs since morphed into its own entity, but it‚Äôs much harder to relocate an entire subreddit than it is to just deal with it.

I think you're kind of missing the point of the meme though

I'm not sure where the misunderstanding comes from, but both characters here are shown as stereotypical extreme opposites. The number of people who act like the bodybuilder is very small, just as the number of people who act like the kid is very small. Part of the joke is how the mature and well-spoken character succumbs to a player who doesn't know what he's doing. This isn't based off a true story, but I guess PvPeRs AlWaYs GeT bUtThUrT fRoM mEmEs.

I see that you have discovered my grammatical faux pas. I apologize if my poor speech has hurt your ability to learn melee, and I will do my best to speak more clearly in the future. I have passed on this feedback via the report a bug system in game on your behalf so that my developers can address the issue. Thank you for bringing the issue to my attention. I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
Technically there are 4, extended antifire, super energy, super restore, or super attack w/ super str w/ super def. Your chances of hitting any potion is 1/4062.5 and the chance of hitting any 3rd age is 1/16,250.

Well, what do you expect Jagex to do? Ban every account that changes its ip address very often?

I did use blood spells (which worked great for fight pits). And tried a bunch of different ratios of brews to food.  It's really, *really* close, but I ran out of supplies to attempt.  After saving up some more runes, potions, etc. I will give it another shot.
---
I'm gonna be totally honest, I've looked back and forth at this post and the karil/arma stats for a few minutes before posting to be sure because I like everything else in the OP. What am I missing here?

Why do I keep seeing people talk about W301? What‚Äôs so special about it?

Bro u got literally no idea what Jagex can or can‚Äôt detect menu entry swapper isn‚Äôt just client sided there‚Äôs a good chance they can see multiple inputs being used with 1 click why just make stuff up
---
I feel like this update was really elegantly done and Mod Flippy deserves a shout out for making it happen. The event was super short and with a guide almost trivial, so those who just wanted the reward and didn't want to participate could spam the space bar and be done in minutes, and to those of us who wanted to really enjoy the event the dialogue the was absolutely gold. The concept was funny and well executed and it was exactly the 10 minute break from barb fishing I wanted last evening. 
---
The cutscene was also hilarious, the outfit fits the event, it was just the right amount of satire, and the additional easter egg to make it 'spookier' is brilliant. 
---
Really really well done Mod Flippy.
---
Get that runecraftin‚Äô up friend

I see it now and totally misread the second portion of this. Makes much more sense those high bonuses were temporary for the (mini)quest
---
I became friends with someone who killed me for my d.claws
---
Yeah that would be great actually. I'll definitely read through them all. 
---
Thank you for the offer! What a kind and devoted gentleman!
---
OP isn't asking a jmod to review it, he's not asking for it to be unbanned. There would be literally no reason for him to make this post outside of sharing something that may hinder the new player experience.

Equip your tin hats fellow scapers. Everything is a lie, trust noone. Let the nihilism envelop you.

wasn't talking about pvp, but about pvm. There are a handful of zerks who do pvm, although not many. 3rd age mage robes had a niche for the zerks, and not it's useless again.

Hmm. Manual ban? What was the reasoning behind it

you can see the cost/profit per xp for all trees here: https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Calculator:Crafting/Jewellery

celastrus is a net loss with selling the bark/staves but similar gp/xp to the palm trees you are already doing.

In RS3 you can make upwards of 100m/h or equivalent of about 13m/h in OSRS if you swap. I dunno how much you can make in osrs but rs3 is farmable aswell

They only hate the ones that chase down people who don't fight back

80? I'm a depressed RuneScape addict who sometimes stays up for 3 days straight playing, and sits around like 18h a day on average.

You're a hell of an optimist, I'm shooting for 35.

I legit jumped a bit thinking about his loot, oh well...
---
Ok I was only asking cause people that want to stay low combat usually pk and was gonna recommend you get 45 prayer because it doesn't increase cmb lvl but unlocks Mystic Might. Also was surprised that all the easy/afkable skills (fletching, cooking, FM, wc, fishing) were low. Your stats are the opposite of what I usually see. Which is not bad, just interesting :)
---
Typo, I meant 1/2.5m. Like what I said before, what everyone is telling you here, and what the wiki says.
---
One of my oldest account, back then i was 15-16 Years old.
---
Yes i did share IRL friend sometimes we played together etc but i never knew Jagex could've ever ban my account for sharing/changing hands. 
---
My brother was in this period very sick not to add a sad story it but he was fighting cancer and i didnt bother a single moment about my account/playing or checking. 
---
My account was being heavily contested by switching hands/recoverd. 
---
I've always asked Jagex how my account was being able to be recovered several times and used/botted/ for gold farmings or w/e and not a single time did you guys lock the account for suspicious activity going on. 
---
Latest Reply in 2016 what i received from Jagex was
---
 'you did not secure or care a lot about your account so there for it will stay banned' 
---
How am i being blamed for something that is done by someone else with prob Diffrent IP'S/diffrent internet provider/Diffrent location of recovering my account? 
---
I dont blame Jagex for letting my account being recovered that easily but, i still follow osrs-reddit, still sometimes check if the ban might be lifted somehow, i still have that 1% hope. 
---
Still hoping for a real Jagex reply or Support how i can be blamed for this ban. 
---
**Rsn: Hoah**
---
It's still a little unclear to me. Which thing in this picture is the pumpkin?
---
80 range i used void, archers ring, blowpipe. This was just my first try on vorkath. Going to get the head
---
Other don't do that, because you can just use rune-lite.
---
It's not for hypocrite, but for people saying "There's bad people on both sides".

It was almost mostly a joke.

With practice you should the 2min mark easy

Small events like this are part of what makes holidays like Christmas and Halloween great even if I can't visit my family for them. :)

This is like something a 14 year old would come up with at 3 am at a slumber party after drinking two whole monsters with his friends all night.

Read my comment in this topic, cant appeal, cant get a reply, cant ask for what went wrong with my account, cant ask anything but just to accept the fact it got hijacked etc and abused till perm-banned/

Its one of if not the most popular series of all time. I'd be surprised more by anyone who didn't get the reference...

and if he goes out and runs a few miles a week he's still healthier than most people on this planet. Funny how someone can work full time in front of a computer and people think nothing of it in terms of health. but 4 hours a day in front of a computer for a different reason? very unhealthy fam. Let's stop pretending to know what is healthy for other people, and judging them based on your opinion of what "healthy" looks like. either compliment the man for the time he's devoted or don't bother with a comment. You're on an old school runescape sub friend, not sure what you were expecting here.

It‚Äôs not *our* meme. It spawned on /g/ months ago and then spread across sites like Facebook and other Reddits way before it showed up here.

But then you hit that jackpot of millions worth of teleport scrolls...

That's a valid option too to increase gp/hr.

Mostly just makes one look like a 'le redditor' who everyone universally hates.

PRO GAMER COMMENT
---
&gt;'you did not secure or care a lot about your account so there for it will stay banned' 
---
You have your answer.
---
&gt;My account was being heavily contested by switching hands/recoverd. 
---
Secure your account and don't share it and it wouldn't happen, you know damn well back in the day account sharing was ending up with actually being banned
---
Look under the truck
---
No, you physically need to be in the area when the drop occurs
---
I‚Äôve had 3-4 jars pre 5kc the collection log didn‚Äôt come out until I was 13k But thanks hopefully getting it soon so I can move on lol. 
---
Also those wondering first mutagen was around 7050 kc and my last mutagen was around 11k.
---
I never even thought about the life of a banker within Runescape. For some reason I was picturing a mischevious older man who had an interest in collecting unusual objects and maintaining them in a bank. It was a very unusual visual until I saw the image at the bottom of the post.
---
Now I feel ridiculous.
---
It's bothering that this isn't an actual clue.
---
A lot of people lose motivation when handed so much more money than their wealth. Id try to spend it quick. Dump it on 70 prayer so you have a goal to work towards, piety. For the rest id spend it on construction so you can have more convenience. This will use up that money fast. You can keep 1-3m for other stuff. Maybe buy a fury or b ring.
---
I have 99 Con and let me tell you, it's a completely different game now. Not to mention if I don't feel like doing anything I can host my POH for some side cash.
---
Indeed. Even though it's not the most efficient way to do it, I did nats all the way from 44 to 99 rc and in 2014 that was about 600M profit. If one finds the process enjoyable and relaxing, as I do, it's literally easy money. That said, good luck on your goal! Untrimmed rc for a non-alt is very nice.
---
Oh yeah. I died when you had to unironically go to the seer to forget about your pet rock
---
Yeah, there's been a few cases of that. That's why I'm not trying too hard to get the rarest untrimmed because it could be lost at any moment.
---
Pm me
---
Meant 1.5k, sorry I posted on mobile.
---
I am at the level to telegrab its just the magic drain is very high
---
yeah i'm basically talking about if somebody does 99 there and has like 3k nuggets. they should probably get a good chance of 1 measly 2.5m onyx from 99.
---
Not the biggest worry with scorpia, people rarely PK up there. If you want to be certain then keep a scout to watch the area outside the resource area, so you can see the web to the Wildy lever and the entrance to scorpias cave. 
---
And if you do your best option is to just book it and hope for the best, if you get the pet then you pick it up, log out, use another account to scout an empty world and then log into that one to leave with the pet.
---
Title misleading, meant 1.5k sorry for typo everyone.
---
Thats the thing, i did not share with 20 people i did not switch hands, i did not have to recover my account. this all happend in a period of time i DID NOT PLAY. all can be proven and checked by Jagex checking IP/recover locations that been placed on the account. Also im pretty sure recovering accounts back then was also much easier than now. 
---
Also thats unfair imagine banning people for something in the past but, 1year later the company decide to make it legal with some new rules lol.. Like i mentioned i didnt share to benifit from it, i shared to pk/communicate etc, Just like known youtubers/framed/torvesta who play on people accounts for content etc..
---
I think it depends from where. Not normal npc's but you do from bosses iirc
---
Need to make an Anti-venom... don‚Äôt have the Herbalife for that yet lol, I might used the rangers money to grind for it though
---
Its not. The entire world pauses for 1-3 seconds. The only thing that doesn't pause is in-flight projectiles. NPCs, actions, and the environment all globally cease action during the pauses.
---
This is the osrs sub, I think you were looking for /r/runescape
---
Tf is with those d chains lol
---
As mentiond in the post this is a runelite issue, consider crying in the discord instead of on reddit.
---
Yep. We can't rename a subreddit, so we'd have to convince every user to subscribe to a new second sub.
---
Need to make an Anti-venom... don‚Äôt have the Herblore level for that yet lol, I might used the rangers money to grind for it though
---
Figured, since i'm 700 dry on them, goodluck on the master and congrats
---
Inferno?  You do realize all this player did was shift right click mark specific tiles right?  There is no inferno helper.  I can tell you do not use runelite.
---
Yeah, this is a runelite issue, not an OSRS issue.
---
Hundreds of kills on vanilla and runelite. Never noticed this.
---
Hat sold for 12.7m - so 23.5M total
---
Do you mean gf as in good fight of gf as in get fucked? Cause I thought it was the former and i could see someone else thinking it meaning the they‚Äôre being told to get fucked as well
---
What's next?  You're going to want the experience tracker and drop tracker banned?  Runelite is free go get it. The majority of players use it.
---
3k nuggets = 75  gem bags
---
75 gem bags ~~ 1/33k chance of getting an onyx per 99
---
only 20k accounts have 99 mining.
---
It means good fight

While you are alching those rune items, feel free to cast a high alch on yourself!
---
With lower volume items buying the margin is really important, because this is the price you are going to work with for that item, if the margin is too low you skip the item and take your loss on buying the margin, out of checking 10 items you find 2 with a good margin, lets say a obsidian cape buys for 561.000 and you sell back for 531.000, you can now buy obby capes at 531.001 
---
And sell them for 560,999 you are now the best buyer and best seller, making 30k each cape.
---
Yes its the undercutting game lol
---
If you wanna flip dragon boots, torag helms, blowpipes, dragon crossbows, you need to check the margin and hope you dont get undercut by others, if suddenly something stops buying or selling cancel the order and margin check again.
---
Low volume items are more profit but take longer to complete 
---
For example 
---
New wildy crabs teleport tab is around 50k
---
I bet theres a 5k margin on them and you can easily make some gp buying a couple at a time.
---
dont get stuck with low volume item flips since its just not worth your cashstack, with money you make money
---

Probably has something to do with it being an item effect and not giving xp.

Especially because I got a 5th peg and still no other crystals since this post  :/
---
Hahahaha the life of a rs banker :'D
---
&gt; If you want someone to initiate the attack first, let them, and you'll automatically retaliate with whatever you have equipped, thus attacking them while not skulling.
---
Unless you're standing in multi and you're holding chinchompas, you might accidently skull on someone else
---
These are just good rules of thumb to follow when considering interaction with people in general
---
Use your costume on the Ectofuntus to make it spookier. I think there‚Äôs a place in lumbridge swamp that has the same effect.

Well you can blame the community on that one. There was most definitely a new skill, people just voted no. Don't blame jagex for that.
---
Did you get any right as you got back? I had 7 in one task, 3 of then came with in 5 kills of being back lmao
---
Ahh i saw some people with that look. Now it makes sense. Thanks! 
---
Was seeing some cats with the screen costume and was wondering if I missed something entirely.
---
You must be the sickness, because I want to get down with you
---
Straight relationships in game are equally as political, but people don't whinge over it because they consider it the norm. Having a event during pride about acceptance is no more virtue signalling than christmas events about gift giving. 
---
Jagex repeatedly works with funding for mental health charities, so the events aren't any more political than the act of paying for a runescape membership, or even playing said game for free.
---
What gets me is that you start disagreeing with slurs, and then end the paragraph with a slur.
---
I have two in ~1000 kc
---
Well so far they're averaging about 1/5 (6/32), got two back-to-back at one point.
---
Awesome, thats good to know. I usually always bank bones, especially doing any dragons. Well ill clarify, if certain bones are over 1k im definitely banking..
---
Was about to ask about that scythe...
---
Yeppers, just made 1k of them.
---
I mean I have but doesn‚Äôt help much when there‚Äôs nothing to improve off of

Good luck on a nice clue reward my friend! :D

Fucking weak. 6/8 is 75%. Live your life at 100%.

That's reassuring. I'll give it a shot next Tuesday after work.  Thanks for the advice.

For the first guy it was getting the two whips in one task, for the second it was that they haven‚Äôt done ds2. Next question, that was easy.

Astute observation, it's almost like that's what makes this post notable or interesting in the first place

He said that he was boosted using TOB to get potions but I believe he did get range pots from the zombies.
---
I feel this better encapsulates this sub though.
---
So awesome
---
How far? Every skill has the same amount of xp to max. 
---
As far as the other questions, it doesn't matter what order you use them in.
---
Someone doesn't know what the crap hes talking about
---
Barrows is super easy on mobile
---
To solve the bot issue, I suggest to put bank deposit box next to the giant essence rock to boost the essence per hour (1 essence mined per second (3000 per hour including the depositing them in the box). But, to use it, the player will need to complete the Ardougne medium diary and has 100 quest points. If the player wishes to use Wizard Distentor to teleport them in the mines, they will need to complete the Ardougne hard diary.
---
For the drop table issue, I suggest to eliminate the pure essence from bosses table and for the others monsters, to limit the pure essence drop at 15-20, in common drop for low-level monsters (50-80) and 100-200 essences in uncommon drop for high-level monsters (100+). Also, reducing the number of monsters that drop the pure essence would greatly help.
---
For me, common drop is between 1/2 and 1/25 and uncommon drop is between 1/26 and 1/99.
---
EDIT : I add what I just wrote in the image.
---
I went to scorpia 2 times once for each wildy diary on my 2 accounts. Both times pkers found me.
---
Lol I literally got 99 untrimmed HP monday, tuesday I get my others 99 and... Was way too high, leveled up at GE, some folks congratulates me so I got distracted, picked up the cape instead of telegrabbing ! Fml haha

Meh, Hellhounds aren't even that bad honestly. You don't make money at all pretty much but it's chill and good XP. There are ones that are both chill, good xp, and good money but I wouldn't say hounds are the worst.
---
To the 1% that bring valuables to wildy, you‚Äôre the reason for your own suffering and every other clue scrollers.
---
People arent making those accounts to box
---
They just drink a bunch of saradomin brews and then box things if they have higher stats

Ranged pure accounts are because they dont want high combat level

---
I just got in trouble at work snorting for 5 minutes. They asked me what was so funny and idk what to tell them.
---
Well yeah.
---
Pretty much. I mean I've never been lucky enough to find the unlucky guy with his cash pile (although I've seen plenty of others get lucky with it), but I have gotten 3 people for their clue scroll book which every time is always like 3m+ (one of them being like 8m in teleports). I can understand it is a pain for clue scrollers, but there is one thing a lot of non-PKers don't realize and that it's PKers play the game too. I've died at Callisto, I've died doing a clue, and I've died at dark crabs. It's just how the wilderness operates, no matter how annoying it can be.
---
It attacks on a certain delay after your xp drop i believe depending on which weapon you used. I know it's that way for the ranger and mager, so I'm guessing it's the same for jad, but I might be wrong.

Sounds baller to me

With that thought process doesn‚Äôt surprise me you think that.
---
Nice and good luck. Make sure to bind an F key to your spellbook tab and use quick prayers to keep prayer up instead of F keys. This is cuz you have to manually cast so tabbing back and forth between inv for brews and spellbook for casts will be helpful.
---
Or grind out a void mace and use that to autocast Claws of Guthix instead. :)
---

---
Oooh nice. Yeah you should be set then. It's very consistent with brews. It's only RNG with blood spells tbh.
---
Why would you be chinning in multicombat wildy? If you know how chinchompas work, why would you use them knowing you could accidentally skull? That‚Äôs not skull tricking, that‚Äôs you being careless.

"Hey guys, how about we make RuneScape more like Minecraft". The sheer absurdity of that idea, along with statements you made throughout the post, show you're either incredibly young, or incredibly simple minded. "It would outspurce the work to the players". Because you think having half a million players, some with ideas just as bad as yours, making quests, NPCs, and architecture, is somehow easy and a good idea? They would have to make an entirely different game. This wouldn't just be "some engine work". Unless you think the developers literally build the buildings within the game world? It shows a very odd yet incredibly incorrect way of looking at game development that shows you have no idea how computers work? Like fundamentally. Another way to summarize what I think of your idea and you is: 
---
It looks like you REALLY enjoy Roblox.
---
Can you do that in the default client? If not it's cheating.

I'm sorry for how laconic my response to this will be, because I'd love to give as much as you just did. Thank you so much for sharing as this filled me with emotion. My future farm runs will be in honor of her.

I got my vork head for assembler on 1kc luckily! But even though the kills are long and I still die sometimes I‚Äôm enjoying learning vork and wanna keep doing it.

I got a curved bone and d shield left half on the same drop. It was unbelievable :/, could have been so many other good drops while bossing

Vorki + blue skin isn't even remotely close to what Rs3 has, and rs3 isn't even close to being the worst offender. I agree that it's a bit bleh, but all in perspective. It could be a million times worse, so all things considered it's pretty aight

Brutal blacks are much more afk than rune dragons, but I think they‚Äôre also like half of the gp. As for how crowded they are, they actually sort of aren‚Äôt crowded enough. Ideally you want a world with 2 other players so that when you finish killing your dragon, the closest dragon to you doesn‚Äôt melee you since it‚Äôs already fighting someone else. With 3 total people there you will occasionally have to wait for a spawn, but not usually and it‚Äôs much more afk than with just 1 or 2 people.

now there's an idea

Simorry bout ur nan but I won‚Äôt lost ehp even for that. Cheers from Iraq

Yeah exactly. I‚Äôm a property manager so dealing with peoples homes and we advise a 5 working day turn around on emails, there‚Äôs often other priorities in businesses

Was this mlm? How long did it take you?

"Remove one of the options PvMers have to avoid me because I can't fuck them hard enough as is when I come out of nowhere with a TB and Entangle."
---
Why don't you just ask Jagex to give Ice Barrage a tb effect while you're at it?

I bank all the spades that i get from those monkeys :3
---
Possible repost? Seen it somewhere at least
---
Count to 4 is definitely my problem.
---
It gets overwhelming sometimes when I need to pot/eat, avoid tornadoes/tiles, and switch weapons and then my prayers every 4 attacks.
---
If you're quitting, why do you give a shit?
---
They aren‚Äôt tailoring to my fucking build dipshit, there‚Äôs more to the game than wearing full bandos and being maxed stats. If someone is playing the game and is progressing through 40 defence and wants bis until they hit 70 defence, then this concerns them.
---
wooo woooo wooooo woooooo *woo woo* **WOOOOOOO**
---
Yeah, those areas exist, so what would be the point of going into the wildy? There already is a clan-wars minigame, so there'd be literally no reason to go except for the few quests that go there. 
---
You just want to completely remove the risk vs reward aspect of it. You are the type of person who would absolutely destroy the game if you had your way.
---
Love this game lol
---
Feel like I've had this same realization and it's kinda made the endgame a bit less enticing for me :/
---
I got all my zenyte jewelry and was like "alright, time to save up for the big stuff" and realized all of it involved like dozens of hours of farming the same boss over and over, repeatedly for each individual item, and said "fuck that"
---
I'm leisurely doing slayer tasks and raids with clanmates, and the money is *very* slowly trickling in from that, but there's no doubt in my mind that I'm gonna have max combat stats before I have full Arma and Ancestral. I will say that if you can learn Chambers of Xeric it makes the process of repeatedly farming something for gp WAY more bearable, because the layout is different every time and you're doing something with other people which keeps it more fun/interesting. I'd rather spend 3 hours doing raids than 30 minutes of Vorkath at this point, even if no CoX uniques drop so it's less gp/hr.
---
&gt;	If you don‚Äôt want to do the content then that‚Äôs your only option

I will train my farming so I can do a farm run, OP.

I've used elder robes and vestment robes on beta worlds. They should be there.

Could have gave the money to your child, silly

Mlm = Motherload mine where you mine pay-dirt...
---
Not bad for a months work
---
wintertodt crates give tons of supplies that will be challenging to obtain elsewhere as an iroman. these will be helpful for training up your other skills. additionally it will be easiest to do this earlier as damage from wintertodt scales based on your hp level. doing it on low hp lets you use cheap foods like wines for maximum effect.
---
I just go with "scamming." In a broad sense, that's still what they're doing.
---
I'll be doing farm runs the entire day in honor of your mother on that day, sorry to hear about her passing away, she sounds like a great mom! Peace
---
The grind to 85 def makes a difference for sure. I could barely tank Bandos/General Gaardor with 80 def but once I hit 85, it was smooth sailing. 
---
Obviously the higher your def, the better. But my bossing has been way better hitting 85 def.
---
I havent played in months and know I have a bunch of patches protected. I'm gonna log in and do them in remembrance of an amazing mothers love.
---
Wish you the best
---
Yeah let's pretend thats how everyone uses the downvote button
---
Beyond true. I was killing chaos fanatic yesterday with whatever gear and decent food and some guy killed me within seconds and goes "gf" like whaaat fight? Lol
---
Good points... I think we should ask the Jagex mods to put out a public statement about that so that people will stop posting this suggestion all the time.
---
Yeah not a fan of the huge purple blob we have now. I agree with making the old tb more visible but a blob is just bad. Id want the old animation or the cage animation. Jut have it tell the pker in the chatbox if it hit like it does when ur tbed urself
---
It's people on the internet, what do you expect?
---
And ruin my gains?  No.  One onion allotment,  the rest snapegrass.
---
First 99s of mining and smiting? What a legend
---
The dedication to be a scumbag with some of these scammers/hackers via social engineering is honestly astounding.

Damn more than 4 complete Ahrims sets. Hope you're maining mage :D

I think you can get the 150m crown recolored to purple. :P

If youre looking for pvp tips do some demonic gorillas and pvp. Practice makes progress. Are BH Betas still open? If so go there and practice a bit

Ardy knight please?
---
Weird account bro but gj I guess
---
she loved all of the herb patches, but specifically trollheim because who doesn't lol, but she also loved the elves (her first combat 99 was ranged because of the crystal bow), so the fruit tree patch in Lletya would also be a good bet
---
I'm thinking of doing another small level grind to get into raids territory. I only have like 54 Herblore and 51 Farming so I really need to push those here soon. Now I'm looking at getting the gp to push for that herblore lvl and I am just not at all excited for it, haha.  
---
  
---
I also have to learn CoX.. lmao
---
Chinning and barraging is meta for defense xp.
---
Hey man you can get dye from the witch in Draynor, you don't need to farm Zulrah for it.
---
She did have a job, she was a lunch lady at the schools we went to. When she first split with my dad, she sat us down and told us "Now, I can go out and get a higher paying job, but I won't be here when you get home. OR, I can get a low paying job, we won't be able to afford a lot, but I WILL be home when you get home from school. What do you guys want?" and it was unanimous that we just wanted to spend more time with her
---
But yeah, your argument was used a lot but none of the kids lost any sleep over having very little money. We were just happy to be with a loving mom
---
Which is better def xp/hr?
---
Gotta download patcher 2.0 for runelite
---
Not really losing xp just spending a lot more time treasure hunting
---
the up/down votes in this thread really show how biased this reddit is towards the pvmer side
---
they genuinely think anyone who pvps in a pvp area is automatically bad and parrot the same anecdotes how someone who killed them once   at some point said mean words to them
---
Can you make me a sandwich?
---
Pfft, my mothers phone used to ring and I'd DC. Load of shit when you think you're a mother fucking G while slaying Hill giants and go into full blown panic mode when you dc during battle.
---
Also didnt help when I was going to school and had to endure a full 8 hours of school before finding out if I lost my mith scimi
---
amen
---
bruh what?
---
Let‚Äôs all partake. Let‚Äôs pick a designated world, Maybe 112, being as it is November 2 (11/2). Who‚Äôs with me?
---
Every point you made was shit.
---
Clues aren't protected on death, they are always lost. You have never done a clue lmao. It is only kept on death with a clue box, which cost 50-100k. You have never done a clue, have you?
---
The dihns is supposed to be bis def because it offers you 0 chance to attack. Duh? You sacrifice that ability to attack for higher defense bonus. Now it doesn't even do that. You have never held one, have you?
---
I don't risk barrows armour. Every time I have died, which is maybe 1/10th of the time I've went to the wildy, I've lost maybe 200-400k max once. Every other time has been a spade and some sharks. I can easily escape pkers. This isn't about me, this is about why the general population won't vote to make it easier for themselves to get pked. And why jagex shouldn't be catering to those who already have it easy as hell.
---
Sounds like you have no clue what's socially acceptable and what isn't
---
Oh sorry. Probably chinning since you usually get more overall xp chinning. Idk which is more expensive for defense xp though.
---
Good idea breaking the rules in the comments and not the title. Smooth criminal, you.
---
lets all meet up at a farming patch OP, my heart is with ya
---
You can start at base 75s but I would suggest base 80s besides defense atleast. If you're off task I used a dps calculator to find that void is the best dps for both melee and ranged. I also found that the fire cape isn't a significant dps increase, and Dragon boots are about even with brimstone for both attack types. So I wear my avas and my Dragon boots the whole time.
---
By doing this I only have to switch the weapon, then the void helm, then the neck slot, then put on the defender if I'm switching to melee. With base 80s I'm getting between 40 to 50 kills per hour depending on how much I am try harding.
---
Edit: Wanted to include that with the expected value of the zenyte you should pull between 2.5 and 3m per hour over an extended period of time.
---
&gt; sadly most were taken down due to copyright
---
Probably due to all the terrible music they used to feature on videos at the time! Lmfao... shedding tears of nostalgia and sadness for your story. Sounds like you at least had a great relationship and something like RuneScape to bond over üôÇ sending love
---
I see, this little tip might help me out. I am currently lvl 53 rc and am just doing some Astrals since they make some bit of money and I have a stamina pool and Lunar portal in my POH. I do not really prioritize XpPH, but if you really suggest me doing Zmi, I would accept it as it is.
---
this is fantastic

When you log in to the website with the authenticator active you get [this screen.](https://i.imgur.com/eXEwXn4.png)

When you click "Lost your Authenticator?" you get [this message.](https://i.imgur.com/J1qwEjv.png)
---
Yup, there's no point in arguing with them either bc you'll just be downvoted to hell even if you're being polite. Reddit circlejerks are fucking weird and this is one of the most annoying ones.
---
My mom lost her battle to cancer 5/31 of this year. Part of whyI'll keep them both in mind on all my farm runs up to and including November 2nd. I'm sorry for your loss, I know how you feel.
---
Thanks, I won't. The only wealth traded between me and them will be either bossing supplies (food, pots, runes, etc.) during trips and then the spit after the run is over.
---
wtf does this have to do with RS? and who makes a post complaining about downvotes, how fucking old are you?
---
if i read that right, you have the 1 button as 1 left click.
---
each time you hold down the 1 button for more than the time it takes to type 1 that counts as another allowed input. so in 111111 time i could be allowed 6 inputs of the same type from that key
---
the only way this would get you banned is if you assign two left clicks to 1 press of 1
---
Yeah, and trying to filter out tennis related posts just gave me some learn what this name means type websites. Doesn't seem to be anything runescape related either. I'm starting to think OP found nothing and sent us on a wild goose chase out of spite.
---
‚úùÔ∏è
---
ever since forever ago I always said that if a pker skulls on someone with a clue and clue scroll  in the wildy they should be able to keep the clue and finish it if they kill the other person. thatd make it so exciting. you'd actually have to gear up and have a homie come with you.
---
Wow, let‚Äôs get that pet in game

Need makeover mage to let my player model match my true self.

&gt; Gay people aren't oppressed in west
---
Yeah it's evident you're not acting in good faith. Healthcare and matters pertaining to legal issues are still woefully behind in most western countries. Took me 4 bloody years to get appropriate photo ID because of inadequate procedures for handling legal documents for those with protected status. Blood donation laws are draconian, and there are plenty of western countries that require trans people to be forcibly sterilised for legal recognition. Eugenicisation of a minority isn't oppression? Really? Even for countries that've changed those laws, the people affected by them are still alive, and it's still squandered their quality of life without recourse or compensation. The consequences still exist.
---
LGBT people make up a significant amount of homeless youth, along with lower average income and employment rates. Given the age of people playing runescape, the people being pandered to is a portion of the playerbase who might appreciate knowing that their money is going to a good cause. Deigning it to not be an issue when it still affects people is a means of enabling homophobia, the same way people say 'racism isn't an issue any more' even though previous pro-segregation officials still hold power. Even if it's 'not as big of an issue', that doesn't mean wildlife conservation and LGBT acceptance can't both be acknowledged. Charity isn't a zero sum game.
---
That you consider people with a mental disability to be equivalent to those who hold intentionally malicious beliefs like racism is abhorrent. You don't fix homophobia by shitting on disabled people. Also, still doesn't change the fact that you denounced the use of slurs before using one yourself, then going to use them even more as some kind of 
---
The event not returning because of backlash from people like you, is the result of them pandering to your virtue signalling. And virtue signalling isn't in and of itself bad, rather the consequences of it being used to cater to people who spout malignant and blatantly untrue propaganda like 'gay people aren't oppressed in west [sic]'.
---
Magnifique.
---
Im sorry, am I suposed to look through your post history to see the context for this? No thanks. You posted 1 picture about a comment and I made my point about what was shown to me, point for which I still stand. Should all the comments about it be downvoted? Maybe, but that was not the point you made on your original post. That comment is still as useless as your post in terms of relevancy to osrs.
---
dead by daylight in a nutshell. just run around in circles lmao
---
I had this issue on Vanilla, and RuneLite fixed it for me.
---
Hellhounds is one of the worse tasks in the game in my opinion, literally doesn‚Äôt drop one thing 99% of the time

I actually don't know to be honest. I did close runelite during the kills, it somehow saved them

Ironmen don't affect the game at all. they cant drop items for other people to pick up. /S
---
You mean 5k
---
!! thank you
---
Hit 80 farming a month or so ago and haven't done a farm run since, I'll make sure to do one Nov 2nd though.
---
I dont even bring a weapon. I literally just kick the wizard to death and pray mage. Still get attacked sometimes, even when they see me kicking him. One time *THE* noobiest shitlord attacked me and I was so mad because if I actually brought a weapon and food I could drop him instantly. Dude didnt even know you could close the gate to the kbd lair. Oh well, still not ever gonna bring anything with me when I do my clues
---
Worth noting though that using an external piece of hardware to autoclick for you can trigger macroing detection.
---
This is the same thing as group Ironman just with a huge group and access to the GE instead of having to trade.

Highly doubt their engine could handle that.

I unironically hate pk-ers

82 would be a good goal for the pool.  It's the most op thing in the game really

Last time i logged in was 70days ago.

I'll do a farm run the 2nd for you, bro.
---
I think scamming is a lower priority than advertising websites from Jagex's point of view, though. 
---
Advertising websites usually means botting sites or gold selling, while scamming could mean someone trading a noob the wrong item and the noob reporting them.

Calm down satan

Don't you think one perma ban is enough?

This is a repost?
---
I dont even bother reporting them anymore my ignore list just fills up because the add to ignore list is always automatically selected. And it just feels like nothings getting done about them at all they're endless.
---
Nah, I always do questing with sound on anyway. It was really just for humor, and low-key flexing that I'm on the official client (which seems to be a rarity judging by the general opinion on this sub).
---
I figured this out by going to store my robes in my POH and noticing the Spookier outfit, first thing I did was come here.

Man I should've stocked up on these would've been such a insane merch.

oh god are you 30m in w/o pet?

Yes.

The marks stack on the same square for ardy course so people just let them stack a bit before spam clicking the pile so they don't have to stop as much

I need ever-Ree1 to follow these *exact* instructions: go to your teenage brother's room and sniff around for a moment - this won't take long.   Now pickup the smelly crusty sock from between his mattresses.    Stick the sock in the milk residing in the fridge.  Let it marinate boys, let the cum sock marinate.
---
Now fish the sock out of the milk and return the jug to the refrigerator. 
---
This is how you complete the "Witch's Potion" quest in Reeeeeel Lyyyyyiiife.
---
Lol congrats! I flippin love the random black bar on the reward screen. Well memed!
---
Gz but i hate u
---
it's an expression buddy, it's not that deep. one of the most respectable things a pvper can say to another player.
---
also, not the pkers fault the player they attack didn't bother to put in any effort to fight back.
---
Ouch :-(
---
Also, why does mvp tend to get lower go value loot?
---
Which would make it all the more shitty after your account that you've spent hundreds if not thousands of hours playing is permanently locked even years after you've recovered from the disaster.
---
I do. And i have no idea how to fix it.
---
Which was the final piece Torag's or guthan's legs?
---
100% actually lowers avg reward value because you start getting bolt racks and other garbage past 86.9%
---
Dude you need to, like, have sex more or something. Why are you getting so heated over this random shit
---
thanks boys
---
I'm not nitpicking your point, but if you think that 50% of the player base that invest a decent amount of time into this will max is the wrong way to look at the challenge. I'd say 1% of the player base that engages with this content, maybe even less, will max on the twisted league system.
---
minus xp lamp already failed poll
---
Do you have a link for that? I've never heard that.
---
Uh. Na. Round two is probably from a good time. A bad time would warrant no repeats. Probably something your rather familiar with.

Nice that you mentioned all stats and times so precisely, thank you for clear answer! Really helps when i'm just starting out (again).

It's on the osrs wiki barrows strategy page under tips and tricks

I begrudgingly did a KQ task after going dry (still am) at hydra for 1500 kills. After 20 I got a head. Two kills later I got a second. So I got the easy elite PLUS my slayer helm recolor. Probably the biggest sigh of relief I‚Äôve had from this damn game in a long time. Only downside is I have no slay pts from all my skips for hydras. Couldn‚Äôt even unlock basilisks when they first came out :(
---
\&gt;He‚Äôs merely telling you how it‚Äôs supposed to be used.

An entirely irrelevant factoid, since the way they're used here is in disagreement, and that is what is concerning.

Youd only need one person to kill someone so you wouldnt need to team. Itd be literally pointless if you couldnt pj. A single person would just kill your clan one by one. 
---
The common sentiment is that theres no reason to fight back as you can win a 1v2-100. If it was strictly 1v1 you could beat people. Also tanking one person is easier than tanking 50 people. Its not a complicated concept. So this benefits everyone. 
---
The occult altar is completely separate from pvp. Dumbest thing ive read all day. People use it to save themselves time walking to the altar. Non pkers dont change spellbooks more than 5x a day. Theres plenty of people with 1-98 mage. And besides that you could literally solve this non issue by making it unlimited changes in wild only where it reverts if u leave wildy.

I feel like EVERY time I‚Äôve attempted him I can only get 2-3 kills MAX. That‚Äôs on task w/ reds + AcB/ Bp. Am I just completely fucking up my positioning or why do I get SLAPPED by these bird brains each time? Max cb stats. No arma armor tho.
---
Literally that entire thread was talking about this topic (ironically making it the "topic at hand"), and only this guy and people who agree with him got downdooted.  So no, it's absolutely a matter of him being disagreed with, not some kind of noble outrage at a tangential discussion.

I know I shouldn't expect rational argument from someone who uses SJW, but this is weak showing even for your ilk omegalul

As someone who also lost his mom to cancer in 2017, reading that sentence made me burst into tears.

I know that feeling so well, finding little bits and pieces that remind you of the little things she used to do and the little spaces you can see where she lived. It's so bittersweet, like seeing a ghost that you can't interact with or tell how much you love one more time.

18.2k for ranarrs is based off of the wiki calculator. Average yield at 85 is 8.8 ranarrs/patch with ultracompost, magic secateurs, and no patch buffs.
---
At max with cape, ultracompost, no patch buffs, and magic secateurs, the average ranarr yield is 9.4/22.5k. 
---
99 farming: 22.5k x 7 = **157.5k average profit** @ 9.4/patch. +8k for all hard diaries.
---
85 farming: 18.2k x 7 = **127.4k average profit** @ 8.8/patch . +5k for all hard diaries.
---
Your margins:
---
250k/7 = 35.7k average profit per patch. (Halfway between 200-300k)
---
You're really lucky to be getting 200-300k over 7 patches, but it's not what everyone can expect to get.
---
Nice! Now do it again.
---
You also can make tiaras without finishing Rune Mysteries.
---
(Can't lamp or bind essence w/o the quest tho)
---
I can agree when it comes to f2p. But I members, there is an area with 8 magic trees and 5 yew trees just a few steps away from the bank. People like to afk there because it's just one click to get to the bank. It's not uncommon to see several players stand idle at magics because of ineffective afk playing. However in the yew spot, I personally think players are more actively playing.

how do acc owners provide info when their acc is 17+ years old? you expect us to remember that sort of info?

How come rune arrows suck so much?
---
With an identical gear setup right now: 
---
52k exp/hr with an MSB(i) with Rune Arrows (rapid)
---
45k exp/hr with Mithril Darts
---
- Mithril darts require level 20 Ranged to wield. To create mithril darts the player must have completed The Tourist Trap quest and have at least level 54 Smithing and level 52 Fletching. GE Cost: 8 GP each
---
- Rune Arrows require level 40 Ranged to wield (with Yew), but MSB is 50 range. To create rune arrows the player must have at least level 90 Smithing and level 75 Fletching. GE Cost: 69 GP each
---
How the fuck am I *only* getting a 15% bump in exp/hour with an MSB(i) and Rune Arrows?? Am I doing something wrong? Even ignoring GE price, which I know is just much lower due to fletching, the stats and requirements alone imply that MSB/Rune should be much stronger than mithril..
---
Is that with every attack or ? Sorry I‚Äôm pretty noob I guess when it comes to this. Or is that just on pull? So it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúset them here and forget‚Äù? It‚Äôs ‚Äúattack ki- then click Kree- then back to ki when it‚Äôs the chin‚Äôs attack tick?

Void is fine if u you land your specs. I just know that I can‚Äôt out DPS him in void if I don‚Äôt land my spec and I‚Äôm 82 range. I can easily kill him every time in full karils though regardless of spec

Dharoks set, dboots, berserker ring, Obby cape and go do NMZ to crank up your strength level to the 90s. Then of course imbue your Berserker ring and slayer helmet. (oh yeah, get the black mask for your slayer helmet if you don't have it already.) 
---
Also, of course whip. Fury if you're feeling like it. I went with d-legs and an obby cape for regular non-degrade melee stuff as well. 
---
Toxic blowpipe is a must-have for certain PvM scenarios, but it has to be a scenario that will help replace the cost of the scales. For the people suggesting Tridents, honestly you're better off with Ibans blast until you make a lot more frequent cash.

No, when someone is spamming something like "Massive giveaway over on NobHeadedTwat's YouTube channel, just search TwatFace to enter!", it's 100% a scam. Even if it's not phishing, it's probably just a publicity stunt for subs/views without any actual winner. Legit youtubers who do giveaways don't advertise it this way. I guess you could say there's a chance they are legit, but I think there has to be an ulterior motive. If they really wanted to just give wealth away, they can just start trading or dropping stuff right away. There is nothing gained from advertising on youtube then doing a give away, unless you're an already established youtuber who wants to give back to their viewers; in which case you wouldn't need to advertise like that in game.

For a bank sale, I guess I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but there's nothing gained from doing that. Either you lose money, the buyer loses money, or you both end up where you would've been if you just used the GE, probably after more hassle than using the GE, due to the buyer telling you which items he wants, how many, and for what price. I'd probably think you were a scammer as well. The GE is right there (presumably, if not it's not hard to get to), why would you choose to spam about a bank sale instead? The only valid case is if you have a big stock of commonly used skilling supplies (w/ low buy limits) like dart tips, battlestaves, alch items, etc.
---
I'm sorry, I went way too deep for this comment. Nothing against you if you weren't scamming, but I guess here's some perspective as to why I would also assume you're scamming.
---
Not as good as the bank teller..
---
No, I'm not asking for the removal of pvp in wildy. It should stay. But add non-pvp alternatives to the wildy skiling or pvming. Do you think we need to put Raids 1 &amp; 2 as well as Inferno into the wilderness to make pvming challenging and risky? None of the wildy bosses are even hard to do because they are balanced by pvp risk, so pvm risk does not exist for these bosses. This is a disgrace for pvming. If they are moved out or duplicated out of wildy, they need to be made much harder and riskier than they are now and add a death reclaim cost that is as expensive as losing your typical pvm gear in wildy pvming. Wildy skilling can be made into another skilling boss where if you die, you lose all the resources you have gained on top of a standard death penalty fine. Why do you think it is impossible to make skilling or pvming risky without pvp?
---
armadyl crossbow is terrible p much everywhere but pvp and inferno btw, you'd be better off spending the money on something else
---
What is the drop rate? Enlight me father

Don‚Äôt worry man if they ban all your alts for sketchy shit it‚Äôs pretty unlikely your main will go too

Do barrows for a while. Then try doing sarachnis before fire cape. Lets you practice switching prayers somewhere a little more forgiving than final wave of the fight cave.
---
Idk, they're over twice as expensive.. 149 GP compared to 69 GP. 
---
Is that double price going to equate to anything better than a 10% increase in exp/hr?
---
That's gay
---
Awesome! and people say barrows isnt worth it!

Will do ‚ù§Ô∏è

Yo man, I'll be planting in her memory for sure. Hope you're doing alright. Big love.
---
Oh shit really. I am for sure getting that then cause like half of my failures are cause I get too relaxed and misclick.
---
Had one task like that once it was amazing
---
Speaking of.. Idk if it's runelite or native to the game, but you can right click on the "public" chat filter, one of the options is "autochat"
---
Why the fuck is that there? Whatever reason it is, it's not worth it...

Can't you just buy it on the Grand Exchange in bulk?

This was heartbreaking and warming ar the same time. Follow through on the charity group harvest, I'm sure your mom would be extremely proud of you

I have 93 range and I‚Äôm still ass at boss mechanics. Jad will be easier but DS2 final 2 sequences have been tough.

I've been lamping farm on my ironman, never once done a farm run in the game. Looks like I'll be figuring it out for Nov 2.
---
Keep in mind your accumulator saves most of it. Spending like 30gp per shot is practically nothing, and in the time saved you can do something fun which will make that money back easily.

levels first.

They should just allow you to buy untrimmed versions of \*your first 99 only\*.  Would be cool for the people with 99rc as their first or whatever.

Not a priority for jagex though.

This is a lie but I appreciate your determination

So you're a pvmer not a pker.

Yeah I was valedictorian. Don't personally attack people. It's rude.

Does the event end on the last day of October or how do these usually work

Someone hire this man

If some1 is bad enough that you can anti-pk them, you can easily run, with way less risk.  There's so many skull tricks and even maybe some bugs that it's best to just bring a bulwark and dhide and tank your way on out.    
---
Now if you want to anti-pk for fun, go for it.
---
Why fletch?
---
Hahaha I was wondering when you‚Äôd see this. Grats!
---
It is not, have you checked a dps calculator? Against an enemy with 10k def lvl and 10k range def:
---
- At 61 range and unpotted, msb and amethyst arrows beat rcb/broads if you aren't literally naked otherwise. 
---
- At 63 range and unpotted, same thing for rune arrows.
---
You don't know what a box trap looks like?

Time of day matters more than world in my limited experience.    
---
That overlap in time when both UK and US east coast are on can make the wildy not worth the time, especially if its peak time AND a peak day (friday / saturday usually).
---
Just got into understanding farming, and I will dedicate that day to do a lot of it!
---
The higher levels/gear you get the more chill its going to be but worth a shot with barrows tabs youre never going to lose your stuff
---
?
---
It works on the mage atk/def roll, which is different to the +X mage atk/def that you see. So yes it will always provide a benefit for you.

Since were talking about moms I didn‚Äôt know how much I loved mine until I moved out for a year. I saw her almost every week but it was a lonely time from when I left to the next time I saw her. Same with the rest of my family but I feel a lot of moms do a lot of work with little recognition for their time. I have so much more respect and my love for my mom now.
