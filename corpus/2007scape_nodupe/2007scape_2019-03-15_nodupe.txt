Not bp slaying when you can't afford it will help. 
---
My ex started to play because she wanted to "help me." The only thing she learned how to do though was cook so she'd just cook things and sell them anytime she was on. She would make enough for a bond then use it on herself and tell me she was gonna use the next one on me, lol.
---
get your range up! safespotting harder stuff will make things much easier for certain quests/slayer. 
---
I think every episode he tries to teach something, and that's what makes any content leave you wanting more.
---
What are you wearing? ;)
---
F
---
Do you know if dropping it and picking up one later on will save progress?
---

---
Just stake ur tbow
---
[removed]
---
And I think it‚Äôs uses in the pure community since the start of the game kind of overrule that consistency? 
---
Or how about you need dslayer for greendhide top but not the chaps so that‚Äôs why you need defense? Or how about why you can wear blue red and black dhide tops without completing dslayer? 
---
You wanna fix inconsistency‚Äôs? Fine. Then fix actual inconsistency‚Äôs in the game and not your own twisted narration of it in order to spite a group of players that told you to park your posterior that one wildy clue step. 
---
Yeah, it has over 2k darts and scales in it currently.
---
You still have to craft it right? Which is somewhere between 89-98 crafting. I mean sure there are people who have a zenyte piece but you still need zenyte jewellry to make use of this "bug".
---
I comment harsh truths that people don't want to accept.
---
Can someone do like eli5 for the force random events? I would love to test it out but I didn't fully understand how it works.
---
Fuck people that play the game the way they enjoy instead of following a meta-sheep guide from the start right
---
Birdhouses 
---
Jokes aside, although they can spawn items in-game, they can't change droprates (individually).
---
Wow, it just keeps going downhill :(
---
I‚Äôve asked before, but most important upgrade (besides occult) for zulrah? i have basic bitch gear otherwise (ahrims, toxic trident, bp, god dhide) 
---
He might be going for the cut dragonstone or the dragon square shield. Both are best in slot.
---
Although he mentioned he would get access to power amulets soon, so I double he's going for a glory. The combat bracelet might be more useful.
---
Ok, then keep 4 doses and 1 doses
---
‚ÄúWhat is a thesaurus for 500 Alex‚Äù

Not a fucking chance mate

I did the diary a couple weeks ago in the same exact scenario! There were 4 (I think a 5th joined really late) of us and we just ran around looking at everything and then would randomly meet up to talk about how none of us knew what we were doing
---
And I was at work with little time left on lunch so I did what I could to help someone but people like you have to be so edgey and btw about shit lmao chill out it's a screenshot oooh scary
---
Back to fishing we go lads!
---
Lol Jagex doesn‚Äôt have customer support. 
---
ü¶Ä CUSTOMER SERVICE..WHERE? ü¶Ä
---
Yes, yes it was. :)
---
You‚Äôre breaking the sub rules so yes you will be silent. 
---
 !remindme 2 days
---
A while ago I asked CoolMatty about an OSRS speedrun making it in. He said it's unlikely because they avoid online games due to reliance on third party services/connections and the fact that other players could potentially do things that are against their rules(e.g. make a swastika out of fires).
---
People pie could just ask nearby players which answers are failing 
---
What a shit post
---
And 3 doses while your actually making the potions. 
---
I'd take a crystal shield/dfs/dragon sq over a book of darkness seeing as the extra attack isn't gonna do much because the brothers already have nearly nonexistent magic defense. 
---
Same for me, I find engaging (even if repetitive) content much more enjoyable. Three-ticking barb was awesome cause I would try to super concentrate and keep the streak going
---
Good to know. I hadn't been doing them on Entrana but since they aren't really armor I wasn't sure if that was the right move. 
---
I haven't trained smithing in forever because blast furnace fucks my hand up
---
Does dropping a collection log and getting a new one later on reset the progress, or will all collection logs keep track of progress starting with the first log you get?
---
Upper management obviously
---
Devalues that guy with 99 def and 10hp
---
i'm sorry but their is literally 0 chance you dont have it by 71 agility unless you are using the wrong courses, nothing to do with luck.
---
&gt; It has always been allowed
---
Well not quite. They almost shut them down last year.
---
FeelsGoodMan Clap
---
That doesnt make any sense. Your premises doesnt support your conclusion because your considering a different context. We're talking about your time specifically. My time is completely irrelevant to the issue at hand.
---
Wondering why he didn't get permed for RWT on that 1,5b transfer..
---
I dont think so.. he probably wants the flail or torag hammers untio he gets a whip. Hold. A rune kite till he gets a whip would waste inventory 
---
I dont disagree. Better to keep it in, just wish it wasn't like that.
---
Molten glass is the best way for ironmen to train crafting. 
---
For regular accounts the best ways are with items that are much harder to get in bulk, like dragonhide and battlestaves+orbs
---
Another disconnect death smh
---
Uhhh he made like 3 or 4. Nice try though kiddo
---
You're too naive bud, you're gonna keep getting hacked. Have fun though. :^)
---
Almost, yeah. They never told players to stop using it
---
Do you mean subjective? In that case yeah I guess
---
Yo that dude in the lower left has fashion scape on point
---
I mean, fashion is subjective. 
---
However you‚Äôre objectively fucking bad at it. 
---
So THAT'S how you use a semicolon
---
Hide poll results on that world.
---
Nice.
---
imagine making a claim and after it being shut down moving the gold post and coming up with it under revival story to prove your point.
---
Uncommon rune arrows drop?
---
Username checks out though
---
You're looking at months before they're back online.
---
Right, but I have never botted, so Idk what my next move is.
---
imagine transferring 1.5b worth of wealth and using garys hood to autoclick LUL
---
Nice account noob, don't mind if I do! 
---
Rage quit? Tf you on about. I'm not even the biggest fan of boaty but even I know that he's gotten two(or three?) HCIM to damn near full completion as far as basics go and only loses interest when the inevitable DC happens.
---
How is it rage quitting to prefer to play HCIM? He's already done regular ironman mode a bunch, on top of the fact he popularized the entire ironman genre and paved the way to the mode becoming official. If you've ever heard of Path of Exile you'd understand what Hardcore gamers agree too. They prefer it. When their character dies, thats it. Its over. Reroll and move on. Now in PoE it's a lot shorter time frame, but the ideology behind it is the exact same. Lose HC, lose interest.
---
And of course the biggest freebie here is that he's a streamer who specializes in HCIM, it stands to reason people bitch in chat and eventually stop watching unless he plays HCIM.
---
The fact I had to type all this out slightly annoys me, but at least now you can't pretend to be ignorant anymore.
---
Lol I'm not a b0aty fanboy by any means and I don't watch any streamer for that matter, but you sound like you're riding Settled's jock a bit to much there pal. First off, Settled is not even close to being the first person with an idea for a "restricted" content "self made" game mode. 
---
&amp;amp;#x200B;
---
Second, you do realize that b0aty pretty much is the reason why Jagex even added ironmen/hardcore/ultimate game modes into the live game? His one man army series came out and was an ironman unofficially, this was before ironman was even a thing..so while I'm sure he may not have been the actual first person to "play runescape properly" i.e; like an ironman, but he definitely was the one who got the idea some traction and is the reason why there is now a game mode you can play such as ironman. 
---
Third, I don't even watch or care about any of the streamers for OSRS but a simple search shows that b0aty's channel is definitely not in decline..so you're either a moron who doesn't know how to do the smallest bit of research before making your claims, or two you're just a moron who is hating on him for no reason. Also lulz @ the settle'd comment as if settled actually started some trend..just shows how much of a fanboy you are. 
---
I keep reading the dumbest comments today I swear.
---
So you want to punish high effort flicking of multiple monsters such as inferno and graardor gwd, for the sake of preventing high effort 1 tick flicking? You want make lazy flicking worthless too?
---
He already died due to a disconnect so he got a plugin to make the hardcore symbol until he died while in control of the account. End of the clip he says "I can finally get rid of this plugin" 
---
Literally no one will say this but ok
---
Too bad you thought you‚Äôd get off easy because it‚Äôs only your first offense. Guilty
---
Yea I openly admit that I hate people who hate a certain group of individuals when they know nothing about em besides they're black/gay/whatever. If I know that you're a bigot, thats enough for me to hate you. How in the hell is "sit down faggot" even an opinion?? lmao
---
The cost is relative to the current methods. Yanille house tele 
---
is ~9gp per bucket based on cost of jewelry, and runes. This method is ~6x more expensive, for a yeild less than 2x increase in output depending on mining levels and far more click intensive.       
---
I was expecting an actual criticism of how the skill is trained and how rewarding it is compared to woodcutting or fishing. Disappointing that your only complaint (diary requirements) isn't even related to agility specifically.
---
üòÇ
---
I saw some video where a guy was using this to make gold but I think he said there was only enough people to play when a streamer was promoting it. It's too bad, looked like fun
---
Oh and just so you know, crashing is non reportable so get over it.
---
Actualy it's jizz but you can pretend if that makes it taste better.
---
3 paragraphs for a copypasta

Setting up solo rex alone is ez, find a empty world and a occupied world. Walk to the rex safestop in the occupied world while theyre doing supreme or prime, x-log and log back into the empty world. U might take like 20 dmg while xlogging but its not that big of a supply hit.
---
Will he ever risk it pking tho?
---
he died earlier because of a dc so he uses a runelite plugin to overlay the hc status
---
I actually enjoy trouble brewing and i actually played (not just bucket water then idle) quite a quite a few games of it farming ‚Äúthe stuff‚Äù. If i was good with timing, i good earn around 5 points completely solo. The reward structure is incredibly stupid, one of the MOST mind-bogglingly retarded things in this game, which is big accomplishment because there are a lot of mind-boggling retarded things in this game.
---
Pouring buckets of water for 5 min, which is as easy as it sounds, gives you the same reward as spending **50** minutes of running around back and forth across opposite ends of the map to collect flowers (and you can only have 5 flowers at most in you inventory) and steam them into  bowls of colored water, chasing down monkeys to dye them with aforementioned bowls, and coaxing those monkeys to climb up trees to give you nuts (an you can only have 2 nuts at most in you inventory), which is all actually more frustrating and annoying than it sounds.
---
You might thing im making that shit up, but I am not. 
---
If they just removed the arbitrary flower and nut limit, it would make the game an order of magnitude less retarded. There is a lot of other annoying things to the game, but Ill just leave it at tha for now.
---
FakeColours‚Ä¢ 44m

Only B0aty could have the arrogance to create an ‚ÄòUnofficial Hardcore‚Äô he‚Äôs so persistent on milking Hardcore content because he knows his channel is on the decline and has been for years, this 2007 mode idea he has is his last desperate attempt to salvage his lost cause of a Twitch channel, creating imaginary game modes after the success of Settled is extremely low and just shows he‚Äôs willing to do anything for one last chance in the limelight.
---
&gt; it should be polled beforehand whether it should be visible or invisible.
---
No, it shouldn't.

doubtful. hes gonna be buying bolt racks soon
---
Bahaha some pathetic duggie lowlife calling me a clown. Just imagine lmao.
---
the new Stormblood 24 mans and Eureka are quite different. There's a 56 person dungeon in the final stage of Eureka, and the final 24 man (orbonne monastery) has quite a few surprises.

Imagine attempting to suck the dick of your magical pixel company that can do no wrong when, in fact, they can do wrong. Its alright, I'll continue to have a successful life without the need to bot in the future, but at least I can own up to the fact that people make mistakes, and that your precious company can't do the same.
---
By that accord, teachers are wasting their time because a single student isnt paying attention. Its literally the same thing. Take any profession. Scientists, doctors, psychologists. Just because you dont see the value in a subject, doesnt mean the person advising you is wasting their time. There could be a variety of reasons why they're doing it. Salary, interpersonal growth, etc. Try to understand that with your pea brain. 
---
Thats why you got a problem with it, you cant do it and therefore want to make others as miserable as you. 
---
Exactly what someone who doesn't want to accept harsh truths would say.
---
Hey sweet you totally
---
Know me personally ! Ha not, however I do see you being a piece of toxic sludge in this community , cheers ‚úåüèª
---
People who align with the opinion that the wilderness should remain in the game more or less as is are correct yes.
---
Only reason any of those mini games are active is because some have really good rewards. LMS doesn‚Äôt fall under that category 
---
lmao plz take it, osrs is destroying my life.
---
If you literally can't read I can't help you. I already conceded the fact that Jagex makes mistakes with botting bans, just very very rarely. Now if you'll fuck off with your illiteracy that'd be great.
---
Do mostly bots use this guy? I needed tomato seeds so I was hanging out with a bunch of people pickpocketing but I didn't think the other people were bots
---
Inferno is the only content that is really "requires" 1-tick ficking. Infinite prayer can still technically be acquired by using an ancient mace or saradomin godsword special attack, but waiting for those specs takes an impractical amount of time.
---
Too bad none of them could actually help you though.
---
Were you playing on mobile?
---
ikr? more tempting for sure
---
Check out the most recent trailer

If you're not cannoning or doing cerb then yeah
---
An app that sifts through reddit posts where there are jmod smack downs new and old that I can go through for entertainment 
---
Bad luck. Now you can't ever fish on the account.
---
This sounds like torture, just buy a pc :0
---
Anyone in here hanging about that is unaware go to your settings panel and the upper row far right tab is a bunch of options. At the bottom is two drop downs, one for npc's. One for players. Set player attack options to hidden. Set auto retaliate off. Auto retaliate is somehow able to skulltrick you somehow or sometimes so it's best to avoid having it on.
---
Once you do these two things you have lessened the chance of being skull tricked by like, 99.9-100%? I wouldn't ever say 100% confidently as this is OSRS and sometimes stupid shit happens, but the most common ones should never get you.
---
If you want to appeal your "unfair ban" and watch a jmod sit you the fuck down on Reddit by all means do it. Your story doesn't prove jack shit until it's verified.
---
So is splashing considered cheating? I‚Äôm completely honest I wasn‚Äôt aware you could get banned for it.

this is the last straw I'm making a runelite plugin that hides all ironmen chat

Not as rattled as you must be to make the same exact post within 10 hours of each other.
---
Didn't settled say he was considering taking sponsorship... was it Jagex?!
---
By trading someone they trust
---
usually with flipping clans or using gold swapping sites. Beware the exchange rate is atrocious.
---
this is too good, "takes 5 - 20 mins depending on the incompetency of your group"
---
Do.. do I get downvotes if I say nice?
---
Fuck it, you have a nice day and don't try to do anything otherwise. You are *obligated* now.
---
Yikes. I'm jealous and I've gotten 2 pets on 2 separate accounts pre level 70. 
---
Wait is he juggling multiple locked UIM's? How is that possible
---
Unlocked Bigger+badder and Slayer helmet, and I have 440 points left.
---
One task blocked, what's the next thing I should go for though? I wanted to save enough for blocking the next 2/3 which I have, but I don't know if I want the Slayer rings (70 crafting) or herb bag, or what else
---
I think he's doing Feral Vampyres for strawberry seeds. With those, he'll be able to start accumulating a stack of noted strawberries through the Tool Leprechaun. This will be his food for ToB.
---
He can buy baskets from Alice's Farming Shop (the woman you go to for Animal Magnetism), and the baskets can hold up to 5 strawberries each. At 99 HP, a strawberry heals for 6 HP, making strawberries the 3rd best health-per-slot item after Purple Sweets and Saradomin Brews. 
---
Sweets are obviously impossible for him to amass, and, in order to use brews--even if he gets 81 Herblore and a stack of noted Toadflax--he would have to gather birds nests between each ToB run, which would take hours. 
---
I checked against the drop tables of some other monsters in Morytania, and the only one that I found which drops Strawberry Seeds is Tortured Souls. Vampyres are a better choice since they have lower HP, are weakened if you have garlic in your inventory when fighting them, and take extra damage from the Ivandis Flail. 
---
I think this theory makes sense given the timing as well, since he could do Medium Clues at any time, and it would be more efficient for him to get higher Melee stats before farming the Vampyres. The strawberries, however, have to be amassed over time so he needs to gather them ASAP.
---
Wrong fire cape m9
---
Man people care that much about the icon next to their name? 
---
Main thing is just how much of a drag agility is at current. You don't even make a useless product like smithing or crafting, it's just xp that you grind for with now ingredients or prep. Or interesting gameplay
---
Thanks dad&lt;3

It wasn't a legit death cuz there was a millisecond of latency and that caused the missed pray switch
---
This little self righteous sweaty nerd right here üòÇ‚ù§. As if I would care about a RS3 account when my OSRS account is better than anything I ever did on RS3. I'm just making the point that jagex is full of fuck ups. Speaking as a systems admin in the real world, that team is full of incompetent fucks, and you're a goddamn retard if you think otherwise. 
---
yes I know, and i explained it. It woukd make more sense if it was; Guthan 4/x%, Guthan 3/x%, etc. but this is the way it is, and it makes sense if you think about it just a little. use your millions of years of evolutionarily acquired intelligence to crack the code!
---
Overloads and kodai potions in CoX boost your magic level much higher than a magic potion or imbued heart can. As a result it was possible to enchant zenyte jewellery with a far lower magic requirement than intended.
---
I'm trying to do the fight caves on my pure (81 range, 52 pray, 72 hp). I can get to Jad with 6 brews / 6 super restores remaining (I use purple sweets). I use a blowpipe.
---
The difficult part is the healers absolutely destroying me once I tag them off. I have a couple of questions:
---
- Should I bring 1-2 combo food to quick heal?
---
- Is it worth putting dragon darts in one inventory slot?
---
- Is the crystal bow's range sufficient to hit healers behind jad on the other side?
---
- Do the healer heal less once they are tagged off jad (i.e. when they are stuck behind him) - in a similar note, how much fewer do they heal it per tile away from jad?
---
- Am I able to get rid of the healers in time before jad is full health again?
---
- When the healers respawn at half health, do all 4 or only the missing respawn?
---
- At some point I think before the Inferno there was a Jad practice instance or so -- is this still accessible?
---
Thanks so much, really enjoying the game!
---
While it may be more expensive, the meta is time saved &gt; money saved. With the amount of time saved you could make a net total profit over time than with the money saved doing slower methods.
---
Arrogant mate got what was coming to him.
---
Honestly though, he really let himself go a little too braindead on a dangerous boss.
---
Reminds me of horrible histories for some reason lol its beautiful :3
---
No varrock armour, banked every 2 hours and took 10 full waterskins per trip. Yes indeed these lower the amount too.
---
And who looks up the hiscores of a speedrunning account? Like it‚Äôs not even an account going for hiscores, it‚Äôs an account going for fastest QPC.

Can we please not post SrGrafo's comics here.

I had to block him I was so tired of seeing it on the front page every single day for weeks.

Pay first and i'll give you gold

Dude this makes me think of The League, that show that got cancelled cuz Kevin ruined it for everyone. Well anyway the episode where he convinces sofia to tie herself up and blindfolds her while rubbing her leg and checking his fantasy league, that's what this makes me think of.
---
I guess I'm just not as hungry for the gains as you are, big boy. 
---
LOL HAPPEND TO MY COUSIN YESTERDAY ALSO HAAHHAHAHA
---
Sure, send me your login info so I can see how much gold you have and how much I‚Äôm gonna buy
---
What'd you have for lunch today bro?
---
I understand completely. Someone I know stole my account when they learned I was not playing at the time, botted and sold the account. Now it's gone forever.
---
But that doesn't have to do with the gender on their youtube account lol. It's not public no point to lie
---
He can do 10 med steps by my count (though one needs a mith plate skirt+maple longbow) out of ~145. I think the drop rates 1/128 by default though? 
---
Plus Settled is able to pump in a lot more playtime than normal people I'd assume.  
---
My favorite was when I was on a 2k total world, dude with 2006 total level starts talking shit on my account and gear. I was about 2190 total and every one of my stats were identical or higher than his. We were both wearing graceful doing agility, except I had Dragonbone necklace and fally shield and other prayer enhancing items and he had an anguish and DFS. 
---
no way he would actually be that careless if he still had hc status
---
Yes I too don't care about proving my fake evidence either. 
---
Make a suggestion to Ash on Twitter, he'll get the ball rolling
---
Does he stream at all?  That might ruin the build-up, but I think he would have a decent follwing and the money can be good. 
---
Also everyone should already be subbed on youtube and have notifs on and comment/like each video to support as much as possible for now.  
---
Trouble brewing is 0 since its only a diary requirement
---
He was playing as unoffical hc so it was mostly for the viewers to know he didn't die to his own mistakes yet. 
---
Yea that Varrock armor proc is rng but op especially when it procs on biggest sandstone.
---
Buy cheese potatoes in warrior guild

Well I would prefer to see the results after voting but if it means hidden poll results im not against just hiding them until the poll is over completely.

First zenny at 378 and I was salty. I‚Äôm sorry man 
---
Etsy.com/shop/osrs3dmodels 
---
Amazing
---
Nah he definitely did more if he got permed and they haven't responded thus far or continued to autoclick after the temp. 
---
Blocked and reported
---
I think what affects the most is not having desert ammy 3 and not having a dpick. I shouldve probably go for the varrock armour before doing this lol
---
Smithing earns you tonnes of cash if you do it at the blast furnace. Doing addy bars is like 700k+ an hour. It's like one of the better money making methods in the game
---
Remindme! 12 hours
---
Dust devils. Jellies
---
Sadly no. Look on Facebook osrs forums 
---
Always the same joke... Hahaha. 
---
please god 
---
Just so you know, he‚Äôs talking about the other function ‚Äòsingle tap mode‚Äô not ‚ÄòTap to drop‚Äô. single tap just makes you right click on everything without holding. I hope you already knew that!
---
100% agree with you. Make agility great ~~again~~ for once!
---
Exactly. Remember to upvote the OP so this gains as much visibility as possible and the smackdown arrives quicker than anticipated. The sad thing is that if this guy really did bot/autoclick/macro, he gives a really bad name to people who are actually banned illegitimately. This is why no one ever believes those people. Just man up, own up to it, and ask for forgiveness. Slimy fuckers.
---
tried to join a team thats known for bsing

All monsters dropped noted items if you rolled on the rare drop table and got silver ore drop
---
To find one guy out killing ankou or some jazz who's likely full up on food and pots? They would do much better to stand in Camelot or varrok and pop people as they tele in. 
---
It's not necessary to play with efficiency. Inferno is the only high level content that the majority of people 1 tick flick in and even then I know plenty of people who have completed it without 1 ticking. Other high level content like cox/tob don't require 1 ticking either. 
---
hey thats my account!!! jk we have the same stats on almost eveyrthing but construction (84) 
---
Very very few people do agility for fun, especially for the amount of time that is required to reach some of the higher levels. To most, agility is a means to reach a goal, and I do agree, the goals are lackluster. Marks of grace at least made the grind more tolerable, but it can still be improved I think.
---
Fucking telstra.... NBN can't come soon enough
---
If you dont whore yourself out on moonguard are you even really playing wow
---
It's faster than 60% because you don't spend any extra time dropping your whole inventory - you drop each fish before catching the next
---
Most observable with Zeah Runecrafting of all places.
---
Same reason that the karamja/shilo village fairy ring has a bunch of bushes inbetween. Right now fairy rings optimally are about as fast as the abyss with the main issue being repairing your bags.(NPC contact can be used ofc) So if you took away those stupid bushes we'd be able to save like 6-9 seconds per nature rune run.
---
Same thing here, that extra 5 seconds to run around is well thought out. Just like all the stupid, stupid stupid walls in the game that make no sense. They are there to make it so that you can't just zip from A to B usually, instead you have to take the route the game devs designed with a few exceptions.(Diary rewards, agility shortcuts, ect.)
---
TIL
---
i‚Äôm hearing from some other people that they‚Äôve never gotten the chat message either, so you‚Äôve probably been getting your runes. weird that mine stopped
---
Wasn't there a post a few hours ago about someone else losing their time pouch?
---
You too. :)
---
Gee thanks for letting this be in the game for months only to remove it now, giving tons of people gear they shouldn't have had. Be quicker next time this is just unfair to the rest of us.

No dude u can be perm'd if your account is new(which op says it is)

mind blown tbh

The levels for some of the shortcuts are WAY too steep, too.

If you're able to get them assigned, extend dust devils. If you don't already have a fire cape you might want to unlock tzhaar to make that goal easier.
---
Herb sack and slayer ring are both good choices as well. Buying the materials for 70 crafting isn't overly expensive and you need it for quests/diaries anyway. Even so, you only really need 66 for slayer rings because you can boost with a mushroom pie
---
Now do it without cheat markers.

r/MonsterHunter, is that you?

---
I'm actually pretty sure there are actually """""""""shortcuts""""""""" that take longer than the intended path. And while the good ones are incredibly nice, they really shouldn't be the only reward for one of the most tedious skills in the entirety of runescape. It doesn't even need to be made faster or easier, just more rewarding.

That's a horrible example and actually works against you.  Teachers dont teach one student in most cases, and in the case they are just teaching one student they are being paid to do so.  People don't do their jobs for free.  If you're teaching someone in private for free and they aren't paying attention, you're wasting your time. So hopefully if you think REALLY hard you can understand that what constitutes a waste of time is very subjective, as highlighted in your own example, and I told you what would be a waste of my time and what isn't a waste of my time.
---
Your example is based on the premise that there could be a variety of reasons why someone could do something worthwhile to them.  I told you reading the entire post would be a waste of my time.  That I would rather just reply without reading it all, and what constitutes a waste of time is very subjective and I'd be willing to wager I'm more qualified to know what I consider a waste of MY time and what isn't. Try to understand that with your pea brain and maybe come up with an actual example that supports your argument instead of an example that works against you.

What do you guys think is the best bank teleports? The crafting cape is the best but what about after that?  My go to is seers

Yes brother, this has been the meta for a decade son.

I think it's a combination of settled being an engaging story crafter, who can make you care about jumping a videogame character across a bridge for 20 hours. And the progression being new to people because of the restrictions. It's exciting when he discovers something new to him too.

It's a form of self expression, which children don't really do as much as adults. Yeah dressing up in dwarven bootyshorts might be a little childish but otherwise it's how people socialize and maybe show their status or achievements.

I'm on the other side of the fence. Agility kept me clicking enough to the point where it was registering in my brain that I was actually playing Runescape.

I'm fucking terrified of the brain dead mindless slog that is the majority of other skills in this game. Woodcutting, Fishing, Crafting, Herblore, Fletching, Firemaking, Smithing, and Thieving are what I'm not looking forward to.

It was known, nobody bothered figuring out exactly how it worked because why would you.

You do gain exp. It can be fun if you have a reason to do more than just fill buckets; the fact you think Castle Wars is boring suggests you just dislike that kind of content. And The Stuff is useful for Brewing and Clue Scrolls certainly have value.

To tell them the situation and perhaps they would convince them to return my items/cash to me. I've seen videos before where they called them out for supposedly BS'ing someone who wasn't one of their spies and they actually returned what was lost, so I assumed they would help me out.

Lol I'm not a b0aty fanboy by any means and I don't watch any streamer for that matter, but you sound like you're riding Settled's jock a bit to much there pal. First off, Settled is not even close to being the first person with an idea for a "restricted" content "self made" game mode.
---
Second, you do realize that b0aty pretty much is the reason why Jagex even added ironmen/hardcore/ultimate game modes into the live game? His one man army series came out and was an ironman unofficially, this was before ironman was even a thing..so while I'm sure he may not have been the actual first person to "play runescape properly" i.e; like an ironman, but he definitely was the one who got the idea some traction and is the reason why there is now a game mode you can play such as ironman.
---
Third, I don't even watch or care about any of the streamers for OSRS but a simple search shows that b0aty's channel is definitely not in decline..so you're either a moron who doesn't know how to do the smallest bit of research before making your claims, or two you're just a moron who is hating on him for no reason. Also lulz @ the settle'd comment as if settled actually started some trend..just shows how much of a fanboy you are.
---
The thing he has that nobody else really does is the way he presents his unconventional ideas and plans in a way that's interesting and new even to veteran players.

I just upgraded from that to dhcb. I know it's 130m but worth for vork when you hit the dollars. I will be buying rigour as my next upgrade.

And it also is required for a diary unlike a lot of other mini games 
---
Since they've changed ice demon to not be shit finally, I'd say so. Scouting will have better results though, but not scouting is perfectly fine now that ice demon isn't 3x as long as the other puzzles and pseudo-required a chest
---
make it runescape + asmr i will watch!
---
Something around 1&gt;5 ish
---
i‚Äôm so upset you‚Äôre fishing and cutting logs in the worst spots lol
---
That is why I usually just make 1 bottle and then for rest of time I go afk at the tree that gives same amount of exp as regular tree but lasts longer whenever i help someone to get the diary. 
---
Blast mining isn‚Äôt slow? What?

That‚Äôs seems overly complicated 
---
Just curious, what made you believe you were only allowed one account?
---
3 accounts damn that autism is strong.
---
&gt;A normal, healthy, sane person wouldn't play runescape. They'd realise that this game is a massive waste of time and on its most fundamental level
---
What makes RS more of a waste of time than something like Fortnite or any other game? As long as someone enjoys something, you can't really call it a waste of time, especially if youre comparing games lol. 
---
At the end of the day, all games are a waste of productivity unless you're the 0.0001% who are content creators making revenue sufficient for living.
---
Much less afk but you can get rannar and snapdragon seeds as well as nature runes so inwould say they are perfectly viable to train on 
---
Nope that's definitely a semicolon above
---
This looks like it was written today to make a post I don‚Äôt remember having an authentication system back then  we had flip phones
---
I missed where you were talking about boss timers and other similar things that make sense to be done on the sever side, but lots of things can be done on the client side since the server already sent the data. Jagex just needs to update their client to support basic features like timers, xp trackers, and an overlay system.
---
I don't see why adding an overlay system to the client would require engine work since most of the overlays would just access and use the data already available to the client (which runelite and every 3rd party client already does). 
---
I can't wait for the next thread of PKers complaining about spitevoters just so I can link them this thread. These people are so cancerous they're destroying their own community then wonder why the wilderness is dead and famous PKers are making ironmen instead.

It has gone down in price over time slightly but stabilized around 1-1.2b depending on current content. The newest content(alchemical hydra) the tbow shreds it, so it‚Äôs on the high end. iirc before the hydra update it was around 1.05-1.1b but it‚Äôs always almost insane for every new boss because of how the bow works. 
---
AGDQ is forever ruined my dude. In the last 4 years or so it has turned into an absolute shit show.
---
He doesn't have access to the dragon sq shield right half, I don't think it's that.

They never planned to let you join, you were being lured. This has been something Frontline has done for years now, I can't believe that you have done any research on them at all without knowing this. Basically, with teams like this your membership depends on one of two factors. Either A) Knowing someone that is already a member that can vouch for you, or B) being really fucking good, and the team deciding that you are worth taking a slight risk on (even then you are going to be watched very closely for months). Randoms that come out of the woodworks asking to join teams like Frontline, Lemon, blah blah yadda yadda are basically asking to be lured unless you meet one of these criteria, and even if you are a really good solo pker, it probably is worth more to be good friends with a member (so they can vouch for you).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
While yes, this is scummy and a shitty thing to do. You fell for something they have been doing to people for years and is no secret. (specially considering the public beef they have with RoT currently) ever single potential member is treated like an obvious spy unless they know someone in the team well, or are well known enough in the singles community to get a chance taken on them. (probably not)
---

Nah the CtC community just got pissed some random dude who engaged zero with the community found out the solution first. They wasted a year and got finessed by some rando lmfao. 
---
[Nope, and why would they want to?](https://osrs.wiki) :)
---
That's not the point OP is making. The point is that in the past the wilderness belonged to only the PKers so it was really easy to introduce a PK update because it only affected the PKers themselves.
---
Nowadays though the wilderness doesn't just belong to PKers anymore, it now also belongs to the PvMers and skillers because they have an actual reason to go into the wilderness. This means that it's not just PKers anymore who are affected by updates for PKers only, but also PvMers and skillers. This, combined with the polling system, as well as PvMers and skillers being a majority, means that it's difficult for PK updates to actually pass through. After all, why would PvMers and skillers vote for an update that negatively affects them?
---
Basically in the current hunter vs prey climate the prey doesn't want the hunter to become even stronger and since the prey outnumber the hunter they can actually do so.

---
Mr bubs?
---
When you've (voluntarily) region-locked your account you really don't have much choice. A lot of these "this area"-only accounts have to do overly complicated things like level up Hunter using only random event XP lamps as seen in today's swampletics video. I couldn't do it, but it's just part of the grind I guess.
---
Is that a reference to something? 
---
Huh, interesting. Thanks.
---
CTC2. Not Easter egg
---
The higher the defense of your target the better non-void becomes. Void is good because of the damage bonus. On 0 or low def monsters damage bonus outweighs accuracy therefore void is better than arms/dhide etc. also with void being a %dmg, the higher your range level the more value you get out of it.

If I can make someone tab three times in a row with four anglers and two brews and vs someone in better gear, then sorry, but I don't see how that's the reality of the matter. The logic that follows this to the conclusion is a bit ridiculous; "he's too bad, he must be a spy," or "he's good, he must be a spy"? Tell me how either of those are the culprit?

You guess? They give ban reasons on their website and have an appeal process.

I played League of Legends for 2 years in one of the most toxic servers of all time, the Philippine LoL server. I have to say that RS has nothing on League. In my experience when I do bad because of a mismatch or that the enemy is too good, I would get trash talked saying my purchased skin is wasted on me. This people would rather discourage you from buying skins to support this Free to Play game when skins really do nothing at all. And your own team mates would be toxic to you just because they don't like you at all even when you're doing good and they're the ones not doing their job. Can't really compare a fast paced 1hr average kill the other team's base to a point and click  game where people afk for hours.
---
Because being the current most well known clan and having won DMM recently, only to come to find out your method of recruiting new PvP'ers, sanctioned by the leader, was actually predicated on nothing more than the desire to scam any would-be newcomer. Yeah, that is definitely *not* going to contribute to the decline in PvP!

The fact he loves the game - actually my favorite thing about the series. The end goal, totally challenging, but the first maybe 30-40 episodes? it's a grind anyone with the same love for the game could do. Is that the compelling thing? a love for the game? seems a bit sad.

LMS is dead because jagex was still trying to figure out what exactly they wanted to be the runescape esport and they eventually decided DMM was the answer, so lms got left behind. you actually need 25 players to play pest control unless you wanna play like 7 games an hour, but it has bis rewards so people play it anyway.

Shift-clicking is best, but at least I find it easiest and fastest to use a pattern that uses as short moves from item to item as possible.

For a long time, I used [a pattern like this](https://i.imgur.com/GVjS1WX.png) to drop fish. The only longer movements in that pattern are the two long right to left ones.
---
Those can be eliminated by using [this pattern](https://i.imgur.com/QYrb8m6.png) instead, which is what I use now, but at least for me it took a bit of practice to do the zig-zag in reverse for the 3rd and 4th rows. After getting used to it, I find it faster and easier than the previous one.

I feel like the majority of people who are laughing at you for paying that money to join a clan have never been in a clan before. The idea to pay a deposit to join a clan is not a crazy idea, but when you consider that this is the osrs community, it does make sense that it's a scam.

Are there any 99s that make you feel like the time was worth it outside of Crafting and Construction? Agility is one of the most tedious skills, it caps out it's usefulness at 89 (don't say run restore because literally everyone uses staminas), and the 99 perk may as well just be fashionscape.
---
The style of pking is literally called 'no honour'. What the fuck did you expect lmao? An honourable clan? You must be a newcomer to this toxic and cancerous community. Best to pk with a small group of friends. Hey I can get you into a small group, we just need a small deposit

100% deserved to be scammed. Guy has nearly maxed cb stats and falling for this?

First of all, he was lucky to go reddit viral. His content is really good and well thought out but you still have to have some luck to go viral.
---
But it‚Äôs very amazing how his account is limited so much but he finds a way to do everything. And then do it better. And then somehow do it even better.

Congrats man! I‚Äôve been playing super casually for a couple months and Barrows is one of my next goals!
---
Bolt racks means less runes.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be honest, some episodes have been entertaining. But I‚Äôm quite bored of this obsession with    random events and hearing a guy nearly climax because he got 6 hunter. Far more entertaining when it was about how ridiculous of a feat it was to achieve something so simple like getting a maple bow...
---
Builder - Hardbeat Market was the shizz.
---
wondering how i can further optimize my barrows runs.  
---
78 att, 86 str, 80 def, 87 hp, 87 range, 78 magic.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
currently using:
---
trident, book of darkness, occult necklace, avas accum, broad bolts, duelling ring, graceful (head,body,legs,shoes) with a RCB switch.  
---
killing (in order):
---
karils w range pray, ahrim w mage pray, dharok w melee pray, verac, torag, guthans with whatever prayer points i have left  
---
i attack all brothers with the trident cast, and only range ahrims. no melee is used. at the end of every run, i restore at clan wars w my ring tele, and barrows tablet back.   
---
i use up to 10 monkfish per run, and at most 1 sip of a ppot per run, depending on whether or not i need to pray against the last brother. also, i usually end with almost full run energy and have run on all the time.  
---
was wondering how I can improve my time and supply (food mainly)  efficiency for my runs. I have Elite void available too.
---
That's literally the point, "chanced" is a term for when you survive but could have died.
---
Lots of fun with 42 defence using void range. Allows for most PVM as well
---
I haven't got 99 farming yet despite playing since release day.

Dude has unhealthy obsession with 'cheating', whatever that means in his mind. His name rang a bell, so I checked his profile, and remembered -- he's that one fool who constantly accuses CS:GO's pros of cheating by posting (most of the time) totally unsuspicious clips. "They're only better than me because they're cheating" in human form
---
I‚Äôd still die lol
---
He looks like a dicebot
---
As a Ducks fan, I wholeheartedly agree.
---
I have not enjoyed most of the fights. Alte Roite is a joke, Catastrophe was ok, Halicarnassus and Exfaust were good. Not a big fan of Neo. Train is a pain, chadarnook is a dummy fight, guardian is... Fine. Some latency issues for some people on virus but I don't mind it too much. Kefka is great. Chaos is great, Midgardsormr is awful, I don't mind 11S but I don't particularly love it either. 12S is great.
---
It's like, okay to good.
---
Specifically with Alphascape one of my biggest issues is how much downtime there is. It's almost like every single fight is taking the primal formula of fight, boss limit break, resume fight after phase transition where you repeat the mechanics but with a slight twist.
---
There was more variation in fight structure in delta and sigma, even if I overall like alpha more.
---
The main reason the OSRS team hasn't implemented the black graceful (disgraceful) set into the game yet is because they wanted to add it in a way that fits into the game and actually makes sense. 
---
This isn't a unique idea. It's just a random guy in the wilderness who will sell you it, no reasoning behind him being there at all... doesn't make any sense.
---
I had suspicions you're delusional from seeing your posts on /r/vacsucks, but this comment right here just slam dunk confirms it
---
I read this wrong. Read it as when I was 5 mining. Pure essence made bank. God I'm Tired.
---
I sold my Santa hat at Fally East bank for 1.1m to buy a cannon and a few k balls. The good old days. 
---
you cant fletch the regular ogre bow, you can only fletch the comp bow
---
You can drop without losing ticks when you 5 tick. It's really easy
---
Ah thanks.
---
people in this game do almost anything with a goal in mind. more exp or more GP (or pets i guess) minigames on osrs will die out if there is nothing "forcing" people to do them for faster exp/gp
---
I wouldn't say it's a banger but it's definitely the most comfy song in the game
---
Hmmmmmm..
---
It's dead because it doesn't give rewards for your time.  It's literally a GP sink.
---
It absolutely makes sense to say. Chancing refers to a time when you opened yourself up to the possibility of dying. If you're at GWD and you miss a prayer flick that causes you to get stacked with the 'chance' for the damage to meet or exceed your health, then you had a chance of dying. It makes sense to use the term when referring to situations where a HC could have died, but didn't. Of course all deaths are chances, they are chances where the rolls succeeded in killing the player. 
---
Also your initial response wasn't even to somebody calling this clip a chance, he was talking about the day where B0aty officially died on his HC. 
---
oh thats nice to know, i can work that out!
---
thanks for the help! :)
---
I suspected as much, but alas, I cannot keep runes as trophies because I spend them all on ancients.  Oh well!
---
from crack the clue easter egg i believe 
---
Is there even any content in elf lands? I need to see this 
---
That‚Äôs awesome dude
---
Did you have 2FA on your email though? That‚Äôs probably how they got in. Set that up first, then change your email password, then continue account recovery. If your email is compromised they will continually get onto your account.
---
u/waterguy12 would like this
---
I just can't wrap my head around how PVMer stepping into the wild can get so salty over dying. Just don't go there. That content out there you're going for, yeah you need to ready to PvP for it
---
If they let people team there might be actual strategy...

    if game.isLaggy() {

        stop.();

He is way ahead. When he released episode 13 he had 15 hunter (check osrs highscores). He just started getting xp there again so what ever grind he did is probably done :)

It‚Äôs super easy to get into man. Don‚Äôt need crazy stats for runs. Good money per hour as progress your account.

Just watch a YouTube video on each of the roles beforehand and do it yourself. Leeching is way too expensive IMO.
---
They cut out the theater of blood part 
---
The cool thing about SC was that the clay tools gave you an alternative to conventional training, but didn't replace it altogether. Instead of woodcutting for 100 hours, you could maybe do 40 hours of SC and 60 of WC. Apart from the hammer, I think the reward is perfect. They should strive for something like SC with every new minigame. It also helped that the minigame itself was insanely fun.

Original Hughes has started his own GSSFS series as a tribute to runeshark. Haven‚Äôt watched much of it but you should give it a shot!

an authenticator literally does nothing if your registered email is the same as the email you log in with and they have access to it. If you dont have an authenticator on your email then there is no point in having one on your rs account.

this is (part of) the reason why everything needing a poll was stupid. game developers know more about game development than players, shockingly enough

pvp is usually done on a 2nd account specifically built for it or as a maxed main. PVP isn‚Äôt hard to get into in this game but it requires prep.

Definitely, I love it, I freaked shit when I got it

Nothing properly fits female models in OSRS for some reason.
---
I made this account around when OSRS server first came out, got a few fishing levels and quit until a few months ago, when I found out about mobile. Never really cared for posting progress but I saw another mobile only post and we have the same construction level so made me laugh, it‚Äôs a pain on mobile. 
---
Damn you got me. The childlike hand writing got me pretty good.
---
Can this be removed

*zoidberg voice*

Poll results have finally been hidden. Hurray!
---
Eureka is the best time to get AFK tasks and skills done in OSRS. The "public dungeon" at the end of Eureka is a simple raid with high stakes and the reward of a massive power boost in Eureka, potential for some valuable drops and an exclusive mount. 
---
Also the new Deep Dungeon cuts out on tons of filler floors (21-100 vs 51-200 in the old one), and there's a minigame job where you collect monster skills now. 
---
What method did you use?
---
I‚Äôm a total noob so I have no idea. My thought was he would be shooting for a dragon stone to make a glory amulet 
---
I wouldn't really call injection via reflection "overlaying" code. It's certainly not quite as performant as if the plugin code was incorporated as part of the client itself as other new features‚Äîlike Ash's world map‚Äîwere, but it does require some knowledge of the game engine that's present on the game client. Remember the fiasco last year about the deobfuscated source code being made available and the concerns that were presented over the implications the availability of this source could have for botting? Adam absolutely has some knowledge of the engine code to have built a plugin system that so easily allows amateur developers to write rich plugins.
---
I swear it‚Äôs just a psychological thing. If Jad was just a normal boss that you could pop into the room and fight, it wouldn‚Äôt be such a big deal. It‚Äôs knowing you have to repeat 60 waves of monsters if you die that charges up the nerves and makes it seem harder than it is.
---
Please stop calling buffs QoL, thank you.
---
He's mostly being sarcastic. You do get con xp from it but it's very very slow compared to actual training methods.
---
Hell, we might as well remove all obstacles and make it so you can run everywhere in a straight line.
---
There was a data leak maybe its still leaking. Im banking everything before i log off nowadays

Were you at chaos druids?
---
Idk man I mean I play osrs almost only to pk, and I still would hook em up halfway or something cuz that's a massive stack. I don't feel shitty about him being an idiot in the wilderness, it's more like that's a lot to lose for a little mistake. It's just a game. I pked it fair and square, here's half back so you can get on your rebuild and enjoy yourself still too. 
---
I guarantee all those bots already have a script that makes them auto run to the G.E anyway. Teleother won't really change how many are there.
---
Omg no more black bars on 2018 iPad Pro finally! Took so long to get it to be full screened.
---
I feel it. It‚Äôs one of those activities where you can get into a ‚Äúgroove‚Äùof perfect clicks and timing that is pretty satisfying. It can get frustrating not being able to stop or look away for the entire game though. 
---
I did diamond bracelets. It's really slow but it breaks even and is very AFK.
---
didnt he already die i dont getit.t.it.t
---
If I have counted right he has got 7 items with one being a dupe. I have had 8 in the exact same amount of chests with one dupe so its not some crazy conspiracy its got crazy good luck. [https://imgur.com/a/vLYVOkp](https://imgur.com/a/vLYVOkp)
---
It's like 9 episodes of him safespotting elves for 50 go a kill so far
---
youre definitely right about that, im 100% sure if i could just go straight to jad id murk him every time, that hour to get to him is just dreadful 
---
Low effort, but high pay out. I like it.
---
Youre very ignorantly clumping the likes of crazy nerds who take the game WAYYYY to seriously in the likes of Frontline and RoT and then equating regular pkers who pk in small teams or solo as the same thing.
---
They are not even remotely the same thing or the same people. PKing clans like this have always been incredibly toxic(and I hate how overused this word is but it applies here) and full of a bunch of nerd raging pussies whose lives are the game. Theyll DDOS you, dox you, threaten you win IRL shit (which is usually like letting "x" employer know about something or ordering pizzas to your house or some other stupid pussy shit like that, not actual threats of physical violence) all from the confines of their sweaty ass chair over A GAME, and most of the time its because theyre on some weird power trip or made because theyre individually shit on the game and got dropped. 
---
Are you seriously trying to insinuate the rest of the PK community are these types of people as well? Because theyre not, not even remotely close. These dudes are a special kind of loser (and many of them are literal losers irl, since theyll BS each other and try to leverage shit like this over each other to "clear" them, it always comes out how "x" or "y" player is a loser irl in one way or another) and pussy irl. Theyre literally only "tough" or worth anything/in any envious position in the game and the game only for the most part and thats why they take the shit wayyyyyy too seriously.
---
This is a minority of people who PK, dont try and push this bullshit narrative as fact. But you are right the wilderness is dead because of clans like them, and that has more to do with Jagex not making the necessary fixes in regular worlds to stop clanning from making it possible to solo pk and get 1v1s or in a small team and risk anything more than mystics. They need to introduce a long PJ timer and some other things so single combat areas arent still essentially mutli and the wilderness will come back again so clans cant just fall in on you and trade specs, pj, etc and you can have legit 1v1's and actually pick up your loot without being falled in on. Whether they make worlds like that or something, it needs to happen for the wilderness to come back because it wont otherwise.
---
Even EVE Online corps don't pull that shit. The good ones, anyway. They all know your group lives or dies based on getting new blood, so why try and scare them away?
---
They just updated it to display the new iPad pros. I no longer get black bars and is now completely full screen.
---
Jagex has nothing to do with this situation lol
---
People have basically min/maxed pvp, there's no real way to compete if you're just playing a regular account.
---
Its seriously annoying, like if you did this type of crying about someone saying something you didnt particularly like or thought was mean or "toxic" in real life no one would take you seriously and youd be told to just get over it as long as it wasnt racial or homophobic. Its like being in elementary school and going to the teacher to point out and tell on the kid who called you a "stupid head". When the hell did adults get like this, and even go so far as have behavior like this SUPPORTED?
---
Like someone said something to you that had a slightly "mean" tone to it? Cool man, get over it, its not a big deal. Instead people, and many of the type of people in this community specifically will just yell "TOXIC ALERT!!" and go on and on about how they were offended by something that probably wasnt very offensive at all and it shouldnt really affect you THAT much that you feel the need to make a post trying to elaborate on it and then shame the person and label them a "toxic asshole". Its fucking ridiculous behavior, and somehow youre an asshole if you tell someone the reality that you REALLLLY need to have thicker skin and realize it means nothing and isnt a big deal and to just brush it off.
---
So yeah..needed to get that out. Ill take my downvotes now from the hypersensitive people who take everything so incredibly personally online.
---
Oh okay. Thanks a lot. :)
---
You‚Äôre more annoying than serene. Shutup already. 
---
Imagine caring about $5k a month. 
---
But for real I‚Äôve heard that people like Boaty get more money per sub because as you get more popular you get a better share. So it might even be closer to like $6000-7000
---
Not at all
---
2 hardcores in a row dying to a dc at bossing lol
---
That's pretty rough, completely within reason 
---
But it‚Äôs was good account whit 80 slayer I wanna get back somehow.
---
ohh i'm sorry, i misunderstood, thanks for clearing it up! You're right! **litterally** unplayable.
---
how many players does OSRS average daily? will the game continue to rise in popularity?
---
Mike cera / Vr leader
---
Blindspott / Jaja leader
---
Chris / Fl leader
---
Dark/brett/zulu rot leaders
---
B0T/ DK/Ibillys.
---
different clans/leaders you are in contact with, so what after you got bsed by a single team you decided to DM every multi clan leader about it? Seems unlikely.
---
I was obtaining ecto tokens on my Iron man when a low level asked me for some food saying he was really low from the swamp. I told him I was an Iron man so i couldn't trade him but i would drop him some salmon on the ground. Apparently when i got to the bank I had run out of food so instead of telling him I was out I told him it was on the ground and just hopped. Don't know if thats a sin, im a dick, or both but my friends were laughing their asses off when I told them.
---
I'm just saying, it's unfair to say playing a limited account back to when the grind was a lot harder is boring compared to what the game is now. He's already done all of the more recent methods in his most recent accounts and it's all the same because muh efficiency if he were to start again.
---
Play how you want, IM has gotten way too easy and that's the reason he's limiting his next account back to prior all of the changes.
---
Dude stop flaying around this "DMM relevancy". Jagex doesn't even pay the winners money in time. They are not affiliated with the winner in any way.
---
what are you talking about? he just uploaded a video 12 hours ago
---
copypasta btw
---
If they wanna pay for pizza to be sent to me go right ahead
---
As someone with no desire or skill to PK, I don't want to feel hunted while trying to get wilderness exclusive items for my account.
---
Honestly, if they made a single world where PvP was disabled in the wilderness, but also all wilderness exclusive loot became an untradable version, I might actually go out and try to get a Dragon Pickaxe, or a wilderness pet.
---
Yeah, sure.  But it takes him insane amounts of time for simple things, he already planned it would take him upwards of like 7 or 8 months for 27 hunter(I think he has figured out this was wrong) and was content with doing it, because 1 he's crazy, 2 he has that kind of time to put into it.  
---
Most people in the world dont have the time to dedicate to this mundane of things like he can because he can essentially treat it as a job.  
---
Yes, on thursday. not Wednesday
---
im doing all three the way i do it is pray mage kill supreme then safe rex and then get prime low then kill supreme then rex and kill prime and so on. the only problem i have is supreme hits on me a good amount and my trips are usual 4 kills so i was thinking to extend maybe a crystal shield would be better to take less damage from cause of range def
---
'Cause you're making the whole situation about you, Carl!
---
Why doesnt jamflex add "rest" like they did pre eoc, that was a good qol update imo 
---
They made a f2p boss and we voted on its drop being p2p.
---
Does anyone have a youtube mirror for us poor fuckers on mobile?
---
I think Jagex once mentioned that boss drop tables are designed with a GP value in mind - that is to say, they aim to have the average kill of the boss be worth a certain amount. I would imagine that the rare drop table factors into this, so while it doesn't feel particularly nice to get things like sapphires or emeralds, if they were to either make these more valuable or instead have them act as a tertiary buff, they'd indirectly be buffing all boss drop tables, which doesn't seem very necessary considering how lucrative some of them already are. 
---
Start off completing all the Free to Play quests. These will give you a nice base for skills. If you aren't satisfied with content in Free to Play, I highly suggest looking into membership. The cost is worth the content unlocked!
---
If you decide membership is worth it, work toward the quests for members. A fantastic aim is to finish "Recipe For Disaster" which offers the Best in Slot gloves (eventually upgradable but not something to worry about for a long time). 
---
Membership will allow you to skill every skill how you please, unlock achievement diary rewards, utilise all the items in the game and explore every piece of content you may find interesting. Ultimately you can play the game however you like but some objectives (the ones i listed) are great for people wanting direction
---
Is someone gonna tell him?
---
Honestly their logic baffles me. They are reeee'ing that the pray mage against normal spellbook snares, etc... still halves their duration. I mean, is it that hard for you to kill a naked? I don't know what they Weill do when an actual pker wants to fight them...
---
Hope these cunts get punished for what they did
---
Frontline doesnt necesarrily need numbers, and they dont want spies in their team
---
QoL, get quest cape or get 82 con.
---
me when i went from 1b to 0m
---
RS is similar to Fallout 3 for me. The most fun is in the first 24 hours of game time. After that it is just grindy BS that you subvert yourself too for reasons you can't explain.
---
Pretty sure it was never directly confirmed, but it's sort of a situation of put 2 and 2 together.
---
If I recall correctly there was an issue of Mod Jed being part of RoT and RoT seemed to just about always have info that others shouldn't have known such as the Al-Kharid palace final zone one DMMT and with that Mod Jed issue there was the part where if I recall correctly specific individuals would happen to have connection issues when they're about to get PKed. Also the issue if I recall correctly where every time DMM or the DMMTs roll around and are at their most popular, all of a sudden a bunch of DCing issues occur.
---
Yeah there isn't anything directly pointing at evidence to say they are ddosing or anything like that, but as far as I know/recall it's quite a few convenient timings in their favor and it's not completely out of the question with all the other issues that they have had some sort of internal assistance.
---
Oh there was also something I seen just the other day on this subreddit pointing out the fact that ever since Mod Jed has left Jagex, RoT hasn't placed even in the top 10 of a DMMT and I believe the excuse they gave was something along the lines of, "We have no interest in it anymore it was just odd timing to make the decision to stop."
---
it's not a big deal though
---
Doesn't change anything, you can just laugh/ ignore them
---
He knows
---
Considering their is like 3 active singles teams that isn‚Äôt saying much lol. Fl has like 5 nhers they aren‚Äôt active as much anymore. Flamingos on the other hand have 50+ bolters from rot ct, and then maybe 2 decent brids from kanini. 
---
Kashia?
---
Now master the real end game
---
Get rekt
---
I was just resetting hop please
---
Not saying it's a good idea but imagine they put the eternal burnt page as a 1/25k and burning a God page is a equal to 1 burnt page. The eternal burnt page is super rare and very expensive to even attempt to try and get. 
---
Now mange the eternal book of fire the page makes untradeable and function similar to the avernic defender in the wild. Dropping 1m on loss and costing slightly more to repair.
---
At that point it's so uncommon and so costly it's not even worth it and just becomes a luxury item for the hyper rich.
---
You mean the clan with members taking unsollicited pics of elderly people and sharing them via snapchat?
---
Have you ever played the game?????? 
---
Yeah the gear is in the game forever
---
id reccomend Duradel than, mainly because of the of the more common ''boss'' task's (like greater demons abby demons and those things) but not really sure if thats the best option its the one i use mainly and im 91 slayer, also BTW
---
Hahahaha hahah 
---
Im nearing the end of ds2 and my plan is to start farming vork.
---
I am currently 88 range, and i read a comment somewhere that elite void is only worthwhile from 96 range onwards and to use d hide till then.
---
Is that true ?
---
I think the skill ceiling could be lowered if _activating a prayer_ instantly drained 1 prayer point.
---
Not my point, people get scammed for tbow splits EVERYDAY LOL. This is one instance where someone tried to pay an entrance fee to join a clan, like what in the fuck?  
---
I mean tons of people back then had a main and then a pure and skiller or something. You just weren't allowed to play them all at once and most people were actual kids using a family computer and didn't have the capabilities to have 2 clients running side by side
---
Thanks a lot! No more questions from me just needed some direction when I started
---
Why does this retarded post exist?
---
I trained 73 agility to get the troll stronghold shortcut. I find out you also need hard diaries done. Look at the diary rewards: ability to change your stony basalt teleport to the Troll Stronghold herb patch.
---
There is literally no reason for that shortcut to exist. The moment you unlock it you can bypass it.
---
I just checked, there‚Äôs 10-11 conpletable Morytania Clue steps, that‚Äôs more than Verf had on Karamja I believe so it‚Äôs certainly possible.
---
Why are your screenshots thumbnails streatched? Which pixel did they rip you off?
---
Imagine payong 350m to join a clan you top tier virgin 
---
Lol u must be new to osrs. Have u heard of stud unit? Again, u guys act like this is an everyday instance when this happens maybe once in a few months. This is comparing apples to oranges in terms of gameplay. Pvmers scam tbows, pvpers bs each other. It‚Äôs just the way it is, there‚Äôs shitty and nice people in all communities. 
---
This is an account created to achieve max cash stack from account creation in as little time as possible.
---
99 fishing and woodcutting, no pet in either. 15m exp in each-ish.
---
:)
---
Feels pretty bad tbh
---
Oh no, is B0aty quitting?
---
Either use oakdice or blow your rs3 bank on bonds for membership if you're not paying money
---
Listen here you little shit. If everyone posted each time there was a new phishing stream, this subreddit would be littered with warnings about not falling for scam links. Everyone that browses this sub already knows these are a scam, and if they don't, your post isn't going to help them. So take this shit somewhere else.
---
Gratz, I can't read the shit I wrote at that age.
---
You can't be serious, I beg you to tell me you weren't.
---
Cute
---
I know that he knows, but not everybody knows that he knows.
---
Lol sit kid, how many spades did you need to get 600m anyways
---
Lol ive done this as well
---
They just feeds back into the existing problem. You're bringing more pvm content into the wild where you have pvmers who don't want to pk.
---
The arguement is that pvmers don't want to pk so they vote no to pvp updates because it's interesting the odds that they will die and lose their items when they didn't want to fight at all.
---
This is the fundamental issue with the wild. It's not just for pking any more. 
---
Lol sounds like a scam from the get go.
---
Scientific proof pkers are brainlets.
---
Does it count as macroing if I use something to hold down a button on my keyboard? I realized I can do that to hold down 1 when making Dungeon Doors and fuck me my hand was unhappy holding the button down manually.
---
Thats true, its kind of, in my mind, a ridiculous system where people can stack multiple KOs worth of damage in just a handful of ticks, a PvM loadout could never pose a risk to a PvP loadout so its one sided, multi being absolutely ridiculous with clanspam, etc.
---
Unfortunately there really is nothing that interests me enough to put up with the wilderness
---
Can't I get a fuckin smoke, mother fucker
---
I personally haven't had a use for the rings. I'd encourage you to get the Rune Pouch (1250 points IIRC). You either need to get 24 emblems from wilderness slayer tasks, buy the emblems for IIRC 4 million, or do bounty hunter PK'ing/pay a clan.

can anyone explain the hype around this youtuber? bc i think his content is bad

I did it in elite void

Engine work. Sorry. ;p

Look Morty ive found a XP lamp.

Lol dude complaining that dropping items is harder and more challenging and you havent even done the inferno yourself. Its an instance idiot.

Use sticky keys, it's a feature native to windows that's allowed.

I've got a love-hate relationship for meme-marketing. On one hand it can be fun, on the other hand you're advertising for them for free.
---
report them to the mods also before you block them
---
as other people have said, it's always gonna be in the game. kinda like the clue hunter stuff: that came from the first CtC event but it can still be found
---
Funny, all of these are dead except pest control  and barb assault to an extent. 
---
Does he know that we know but we know that not everyone knows that we know that he knows it
---
There's more than just ranger boots on the med clue table
---
Exactly the only thing worth considering is the kbd for the pet and helm recolor and the chaos alter.
---
Kbd you can just suicide a inv and you can get whatever you need risk free and chaos alter is just annoying when you die since anything you lost is just the bones you would have normally spent at gilded

Lmfao RoT "lawyers" working overtime on Reddit every time ddos is even mentioned.
---
Anyone who's not an actual brainlet knows RoT are ddosers and RWTers going back way further than DMM
---
Should've seen it coming! :p
---
No you don't need boss tasks unlocked to be assigned jad. If you get a tzhaar task, the slayer master will ask if you want to kill jad instead. Make sure to spacebar through this dialogue and select the option that says "yes, i want to kill jad" (pretty sure it's the first option). If you accidentally walk away from the slayer master without finishing the dialogue, you will be assigned regular tzhaar.

He's been spamming his shitty vids all day rofl what an idiot to think he'll get people to watch that shit haha

 It's weird last time I checked Flamingos won't fight Frontline without the aid of a dying multi team that provide you 30 more d hiders to support you guys., don't see that as controlling the wilderness as you're not even up on them or any team for that matter. The fact that a single team (Frontline) has impacted the game this much amazes me. Low tier quality members who can't compete and put them in a delusional state of mind by thinking so highly of themselves.  It's just time ticking now till one of you die again for another ancestrial set since that's what you guys are known for, by the amount of Gif's I see every time you run into ANY single team just amazes me how bad you guys really are. 
---
tldr: from an UNBIASED POV Flamingos are a low-quality delusional state of mind team who think they have relevancy in the clan world or against think they can compete with Frontline 1v 1 or any single team for that matter. 
---
Lmao this has to be fake? Deposit to join? You actually following through? Good try but definitely fake. 
---
Don‚Äôt upvote these uncultured swine

All I do on osrs is competitive stuff like pvp and mini games but cba with LMS pray flicking, it‚Äôs just not worth the arthritis

Yeah I figured they would be PK focused.  Are they actual backups/rips of the game from that time?]
---
Funny that Jagex claims to not have made any backups from that time, but randoms are able to create whole servers.
---
I didn't do it
---
Not if you look at the kill count it took.
---
Sleep deprivation can be lethal, be careful.
---
Wtf is this quality, can't see a thing, irrelevant, delete post
---
It doesn't matter. They were going to hold the deposit for days anyway. Also op was a literal nobody which alone is enough to cause suspicion. You don't join a clan like this being a nonamer, unless of course you're a spy.

You know there‚Äôs a whole bunch of pkers that pk I‚Äôm exclusively pvp &amp; bh worlds that don‚Äôt go near the wildly that have been completely ignored since release

Is there any communities for rune crafters? I just got into the game a week or so ago and really like rune crafting so far so was wondering if there was a place to meet others interested in the same
---
Where can I find a clan, or a guild to play with? Im new to this fake but have been playing a bit. But I don't have about direction or what to do next. I find myself busy training stats. I just want people I can play with that are willing to help me through the game. My in-game name is ArborMoon if anybody wants to friend me. (Sorry if this goes against the rules. I am pretty clueless about all this. 
---
Also thank you for introducing me to Swampletics. It is incredible. 
---
It's just a quest point
---
They were taking about making it a parallel drop table like 2 years ago, too soon got actual content update
---
The useful members of reddit already answered my question and told me that he used a RuneLite plugin to make himself HC again, information that was not included in the clip.
---
There literally was no need to be rude.
---
This. He'll probably also juggle medium clues for the lolz but it's too inefficient to be his primary motivation. Baskets of strawberries are going to be huge for him, especially during the whip grind.
---
How old is this wtf u even post it for the bs with the pk client is old news

You know how there's a progress bar on the screen when you're at tutorial island? Most likely means the % of that.

All they really need to do to fix singles is give it the DMM singles mechanics. Otherwise it's really not singles..
---
Suck my balls
---
And I get that but you said you were going to link them to this......which advocates spite voting... so what more is needing to be said about this.
---
Linking this does indeed promote spite voting against the community when it's the minority that is doing this, it would be like if a pve clan scammed someone and (if the tables were flipped in terms of population for each community), and everyone spite voted no for pve. To which some guy is going to link a reddit thread where someone was scammed and persuading people to say no to a poll due to it, am I missing something?
---
isn't it obvious? he's trying to merch cosmic runes stay woke
---
Ever heard of mystic might and uneven prayer lvls not giving extra combats? 
---
Nice man! I had a friend of mine that got the thieving pet on 24 xp a while ago, so sick too see another guy get a pet that early!
---
[Mod Ash's stance](https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/921305002869755904)
---
Taking out tick manipulation at this point, other than being an absolutely massive amount of work, would sort of break the game.
---
People wouldn't be able to tick eat in pvp or pvm, people wouldn't be able to prayer flick, and the time to level half of your skills would increase drastically. People wouldn't be able to do crazy stuff like killing corp with potatoes, or doing a no prayer run of fight caves.
---
Personally I don't see how some of the high level pvm in the game is possible without prayer flicking.
---
So yeah it's pretty deeply ingrained in the game at this point, as well as into peoples' muscle memory. It definitely wasn't intended but jagex have accepted it as clever use of game mechanics which I completely agree with.

Elite void is superior at all levels against Vorkath due to its damage bonus stacking with the Salve Amulet (ei). It's even better DPS on task than a Slayer Helmet

You wanna pile people in singles make your own team man. Grow the community instead of the cancer like FL.

Typical autist
---
I have nearly identical stats, using blowpipe instead of cb and wearing god d'hide. I do the brothers in a loop starting at dharok and ending at ahrim and generally use no supplies other than runes and darts. Occasionally I'll eat a monkfish or two, and ig you could sip a prayer dose if it ends on dharok but I usually just tank it.
---
Thanks man. :) my first sort of long-ish term goal for slayer was def 85. Ive never had 85 slayer before. Since i was a pvp'er back in the day I never trained slayer or other skills really (outside of getting barrows gloves waaay later on). So it feels really good having it now!
---
I like how my stats are looking finally. I do wish my strength was higher. But now that i am 85 slayer I may afk nmz for a while, I would like to get 93-94 str out the way then train my attack a bit. 
---
I believe you deserve everything that happened to you. Not only are you a PKer, i.e. a piece of shit who wants to ruin other people‚Äôs good times, but you also tried to join a bunch of other pieces of shit in one large shit pile... and you complain about the stench?  Seems logical.
---
LMFAO you actually getting downvoted meanwhile what you say is 100% truth
---
A
---
It's not about promoting spitevoting. It's just that every single time PKers don't have an update pass because of whatever reason, they immediately blame "salty pvmers who died in the wildy" when it's really much more than that. Assuming spitevoting is actually affecting the poll, this thread is essentially proof of the toxicity in the PK clan community and why some people might not want to help these people out at the expense of everyone else. 
---
I actively campaigned for the last few PvP updates because I think the wilderness is healthy for the game. It's just unfortunate that clans like FL give the community such a bad rap, but it's well deserved. Like I said for the billionth time, there are toxic shitheads everywhere in OSRS but PKers are consistently the worst.
---
(Oh and don't get me wrong, the OP is a total idiot for getting scammed but it doesn't make what the clan did any less shitty)
---
bro people do this for *days*
---
Wtf does arrogance have to do with it? He didnt die to a game mechanic so he decided to keep playing the account and pretend it was a hcim. He plays the game how he wants to, why is that so bad?
---
When I afked a baby pure there I found it best to just say "Lol good luck I'm not moving" to crashers, sit there and do whatever you're doing on another account or game tab back in to reset and see they've spammed you with insults, laugh and they leave.

Thanks! Should I sell my anguish for a bgs then?

Playback pvm is pretty solid if you're looking to raid n stuff

If they dont want spite voters, you gotta appease new blood. It's the same in politics. Disrespect people showing newfound interest will channel that excitement and curiosity into rage and mania.

You get graceful before 70 though.... that‚Äôs not even halfway there Bub

The panic will happen on your first attempt or two, I was the same way. I think my first attempt I fucked up immediately. Tried the next day and boom. Now I have the bitch unlocked for a slayer task and have killed him 10 times.

The wiki has a gear list under their strat guide. BP with addy darts and some dragon darts for jad

Except you can juggle so you don‚Äôt need to get 3 in a row.

It's not just on mobile, PC aswell.

Fucking lmao at RuneScape espionage 
---
Damn another reply huh? 
---
Even if you spam 100 buckets you need someone else to get other ingredients because you only get points for contribution to completed bottles IIRC. So the scoring is fine, it's the rewards that are useless. 
---
Brewing is kinda dead content because there are better boosting methods for the most skills.
---
Med clues are worth 50k already (since you get them from eclectics), so the only option they would be viable is if you could afford multiple clues for every game played. But then you would also have to teleport back after every clue to get the next one which would include 'rum' price into effective clue scroll price.
---
And the 'rum' is useless unless you have to teleport very frequently because there is minigame teleport that does the samething for free.
---
Lmfao paying a deposit is like falling for the Nigerian prince scam irl, I take it you've never done any research into clans or teams till just now :/ it's awful but your ignorance is your own fault on this one that being said join vanguard or wilderness guardians lmfao
---
Same thing happened to me. I quit right about 2007/2008, tried to log in maybe 2011. Banned, RWT. Oh well. 
---
Cool, gl on pet :)
---
So you always have a raid team.
---
Before raids, not much, just mainly being in a chatroom full of likeminded people with similar goals. And maybe doing the handful of bosses that you can't really solo well
---
Hodor? 
---
Yeah no lmao. This is no different than you falling for a free armour trimming in terms of being an idiot. 
---
&gt; solely because of swampletics
---
why?

Upping the ante for osrs graphics lol

‚ÄúThe paranoia of you kids amazes me‚Äù

The fact you‚Äôre dumb enough to fork over 600m let alone just wanting to get into frontline to ride dick amazes me.
---
Same when I just got the diary. We had 2 full teams but we all met and the middle and just chatted until time was up. One guy was running around frantically asking how to play but stopped and joined us when he realized he didn't need to win. 
---
I mean. Imagine the amount of people you could trigger with that 1STR only. üòè
---
^ This guy knows what he's talking about, I had two maxed guys (including a top 150 ranked im) talking about it yesterday while I just took in the info they were saying. 113k is obviously optimal, with minimal time lost to switching lure spots.

I beat it for the first time yesterday at 105 cb.

I got quest cape before fire cape and this was my 3rd attempt, if you do it on task you get a huge bonus with slayer helm(i). 
---
First 2 attempts i panicked when healers spawned but just remember to do 1 action between prayer switches and you will be fine
---
So you comment twice just to tell me your done arguing with me? 
---
Damn did I murder you that hard? Sorry bro. 
---
The fuck you talking bro?!?!
---
I‚Äôd explain why I disagree.
---
This is a purely cosmetic and optional activity. Nothing changes if you got black graceful or not.
---
You aren‚Äôt ‚Äúforced‚Äù into the wildy. Your account suffers no penalty from not doing this. (Unlike wildy altar where as an ironman you save time and use less bones)
---
Doing agility uses zero invent, so you can fairly fight back with full gear and supplies. 
---
This could be a good option for people that want to pk or learn to anti pk to get a cosmetic reward.
---
Or it could be a good option to show you tanked in the wildy to get it.
---
Also I upvoted your comment
---
Know what allows stuff like this to happen? Fucking idiots like you that help clans do ‚Äústuff like this‚Äù by handing over their bank to feel cool

Yea wintertodt seems pretty fun, I‚Äôll look more into it.

Mispelled hate* there, buddy. No problem, i‚Äôve got your back

Oh wow. Some of us like to run at least 4 windows of osrs at a time. Some of us also play a few games.
---
Yup, nothing out of ordinary. Full of dicks as always.
---
They‚Äôre probably practicing pking in a safe environment. Pretty normal, practice how you play. 
---
Well 40-80m in 2009 is probably like 3m rs3 now which is like 500 osrs gp
---
That‚Äôs what I did with hunter but I did that right off the bat so that kinda put a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe fishing or something relaxing that I never focused?
---
To make cannonballs faster, obviously.
---
Rc is 4 pleb
---
Nooooo
---
So has anyone figured out what he is going to do with em?
---
I mean I'd still think him just having crazy luck is the much more believable thing here. I don't get why people think it's so crazy anyway, barrows pieces aren't that rare, it's not that crazy to get super lucky. Sure it's insane that he got pieces he wants but that's just the way rng works.
---
Woox doing inferno with no food or pots is insane to me
---
You could just make multiple accounts to buy them on. Not too hard to do since the items are f2p.
---
Q
---
Tears of Guthix.
---
Take a break then.  Motivation comes from within. If you ain't feeling the game go get wrecked in fortnite then come back to rs Haha 
---
Faster cannonballs is dumb just afk them like everyone else 
---
Escape while you can live a good life
---
Correction: 70 agility allows the need to ditch the dusty key via blue dragon tunnel

yea either die legit or you get nothing

Don't forget even on the official client you get stuck and float there indefinitely until you move.

I did this for money in 2006. 100 ess for 20k wasn't bad for me and it's how I eventually got my Black(g) set!
---
the funny thing is, the higher your runescape account is, the higher probability your real life isn't that good. (not saying this applies to eveyrone, but to many people with lots of time on RS their life isnt that good hence they play enormous amounts of RS)
---
Some people who don't want to go through the trouble of sourcing the files and painting might. And if you could finish them better by sanding them and airbrushing then I bet people would for sure.
---
Don't listen my dude. Funniest comment in this post that's why everyone is so triggered.
---
&gt; isn't scamming their "own community" It also doesn't ruin PVM because it doesn't require players by your logic?!
---
Well no, because then you go back to PvM by yourself without whatever was scammed off of you. When it comes to PvPing, the problem is you're either with a group or get taken out by a group, and if you get scammed and told to fuck off by the group you're trying to join, you're back at square one of running through the wild with noone at your back at the mercy of the first group you come across.
---
PVM is easier to manipulate and you know what you're in for, you can do solo or group(for raids) and you have options. PvP you're better off at duel arena because all it takes is a half decent group of 2-4 people to sit you down if you wander the wrong way alone.
---
The more people try PvP and get wrecked by groups, the more those people try to join a group on their own. If they can't get in a group, why even PK anymore?
---
upvote it then
---
I mean the only reason I did lumby diary is to use the draynor shortcut to sarim. That is only medium though.

It took you TWELVE YEARS to accomplish barrows my guy...?
---
Its literally so simple and easy that you can do it at like 50 CB, sorry but taking 12 years to do barrows is not an achievement lmao
---
Mobile only as well, any tips on how to do Fight Caves/Jad on mobile? Never done it before even on desktop. 
---
Because 95% of people wont check reddit or similar sites. 
---
The only reason most people see poll results is because its right there on the client
---
What the hell is even the point of checking poll results? Why would you want to just vote with the majority?
---
keep giving us feedback and we'll eventually not poll it
---
I‚Äôm legitimately not worried. The game is too hardcore with regard to grind times and the unforgiving nature of dropping all your items on death. Show me the Instagram normie that will click 2 spots on their screen for 30 hours to max  construction lol let alone agility or rc 
---
You'll be fine with 70-75 ranged, bgs is pretty essential for both vork and galvek. You'll heavily rely on the rng of your Ruby bolts (e) on galvek and possibly vork. 
---
Use a rune/dragon crossbow for galvek with Ruby enchanted bolts and a diamond switch when he gets low health. You can use the same approach for vork too if you don't fancy blowpiping him (I used rune crossbow).
---
You might have some bullshit attempts where you don't deal too much damage, but keep trying and you'll eventually hit him hard, galvek took me about 8 tries.
---
You probably already know but salve amulet (ei) is incredibly good for vork. 
---
When a pvmer sees this what are they gonna do? Vote no to pvp polls. Things like this really hurt the pvp community imo
---
I do quests when I don‚Äôt have the motivation to do any skills. Gets me moving around the world and keeps me intrigued. 
---
If anything this improves my immersion.  I see this kind of crap all the time in real life. lol
---
They use it to feel better about themselves 
---
Get you self a bell
---
He did that? That‚Äôs pretty sick but also woox is legendary so wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all. 
---
I like it sounds fun
---
Makes sense. Ur pking with someone who u just met and could easily bs anyone in ur team for 100-500m. 
---
Tho its frontline
---
So that dude lied to me
---
How dare he
---
You want to make cannonballs even faster and easier? What could go wrong. 
---
Did you ever find out the answer to this? I want to set up cannon near roc crabs whilst killing imps near monastery
---
u can literally copy paste the formatting from an actual rs-mail
---
Fuck it, yeah let's give the serp helm over 50 recolors, hunting them all down would be more interesting than the current content ideas we've been getting lately.
---
&gt;everything easier for no reason
---
Except the reason that you ground out those agility levels. 
---
Yep it caps at 90 tiles.

Isn't that mostly just girls posing with runescape, and hentai?
---
The real way to do it is to skill and chill together. Couplescaping is absolutely the cutest thing I've ever seen.
---
Don't really have a specific defense level, just get something decent, I suppose. A higher level will give you the option to tank certain brothers instead of using prayers, but of course, isn't needed.
---
Because he was given a direct set of instructions by a ranked clan member. I agree OP is a headass but I don‚Äôt blame him for trying to join an established pking clan if he wants to pk.
---
Try your best to go for barrows gloves. I know it‚Äôs what most people say, but I‚Äôve finally bought into the idea of doing it myself. Pick a higher level boss you find intriguing, and build your account toward the ability to kill said boss. See what quests unlock what content, do a couple each night. Add in some slayer, birdhouse and farm runs, and some extra skilling on your favorite gathering skills. You‚Äôll start to see things unlocked and possibly enjoy the sense of account growth

The OSRS black market is definitely real but I don't think that and raids are the only things keeping the game going. The majority of the playerbase are lower or med levels

Well I hate to say this but you don‚Äôt just randomly die when you‚Äôre logged off so you must not have logged out properly.

No there forsure is. Notice how this post has \~50 upvotes and the post from that guy who 3d printed a Jad to sell had like 6k upvotes and people begging for etsy links.

Maybe have a very small chance to obtain a cannon part at certain intervals, requiring some extra bit of effort?

What do you mean by that?

This idea is actually a very creative original idea. I can definitely see this making it to the front page.

And to everyone coming in after this comment: If you intend to do nothing more than leave a trashy cynical comment. Please don't.

If you don't like the idea, give a suggestion for how it can be made better, or get out. Stop punishing people who spent loads of time making Photoshop presentations and go out of their way to provide FREE creative ideas to you as a community, just to shut them down and discourage them from ever coming back again.

This idea has real value even if the end result is not to make cannonballs, but rather to serve some other purpose.

You capitalist pig. You spend 9/10ths of your time running around depleting our world's rivers with your fishing, deforresting Gielinor with your woodcutting, killing innocent creatures in the name of someone called "Nieve". And when you finally decide that you need something from your butler, despite not having paid him since the last time you needed him, you bitch and moan about having to spend an extra 10 seconds finding him because \*gasp\* he doesn't spend 100% of his downtime waiting motionless to serve you.

They don't pay for it lol...

I mean, I'm sure it would still be like 95% male lol, but I for example did not fill in my sex in my google account or many other online places for that matter because it is unnecessary information and to avoid annoyances. I can imagine im not the only woman doing this.

Panic sell cannonballs.

I'm scared to try with 1.3b and 122cb. How the fuck do people do this, or do some people make it out to be harder than it is 
---
&gt; runescape's PVP options are absurdly bad and encourage players to specifically go out of their way to avoid engaging with the content in legitimate ways and instead try to subvert the mechanics to their advantage; this is why you have gankers in singles zones, this is why you have luring, this is why you have skull tricking, this is why nobody risks anything. pushing people who don't want to engage with this broken system at all out towards the wilderness is obviously going to create resentment, and because people are bad at blaming systems for things they instead blame the PKers who take advantage of said system, even though the PKers suffer as well because said system makes PVP far less popular. again it's bad for everyone but sure in this case the hate is misdirected, most PKers are not calling for more updates that specifically push people not interested in PVP into the wildy.
---
Its pretty simple my guy. Its not about "pushing" people to participate in PvP, its about RISK. The only reason why you can have extremely rewarding things like Revs or Venenatis even in the game, is by attaching a heightened level of risking to them. If you put Revs or Ven in a non PvP zone, with the mechanics they have, it would be an absurdly OP encounter because there would be essentially zero risk and itd be incredibly easy to make dumb amounts of money, the only thing youd have to worry about is competition. PKers are literally the reason why these encounters are so profitable and rewarding, without that prohibitive risk they wouldnt be.
---
And the only people who complain for the most part are the people who feel entitled to do these encounters without actually having that risk be there, which is ridiculous. They complain because they refuse to accept the risk and prepare properly. You cant complain if you CHOOSE to not bring tank gear/inventory and know how to tank if you get attacked and would rather just not bring that stuff because you think its unfair to be attacked in the first place and then go flame PKers because of their own lack of preparation and skill at tanking. Its not very hard most times to tank if you have any clue what youre doing and come prepared. Its a CHOICE to automatically make yourself an easy kill.
---
&gt; obviously some people are just assholes, and if your preferred activity in-game is to killing people who can't fight back you're probably more likely to be an asshole.
---
Well aint that some mental gymnastics with a healthy side of bias? First of all, they CAN fight back, its their choice not to be prepared to know how to. Secondly wtf do you mean "killing people who cant fight back"? You do realize most pkers are out there to...fight other pkers right? But you arent going to pass up what could be an easy kill for potentially significant profit if you see it, right? You seriously think labeling someone as an asshole of a person because they choose to do exactly what youre supposed to do in a PvP area and what makes RS unique, is actually a logically valid way to look at things? Its nothing more than a victim mentality. 
---
In a bit of time? Maybe take a look through new in the subreddit, there are no less then 5 of these posts a day. Now some may not know but I don‚Äôt have a fucking clue how they don‚Äôt know, every single one has spelling mistakes and there are often multiple boatys and wooxs quitting at one time. So if you fall for that you were probably gonna get hacked eventually anyway.

If you're being invited to them, odds are they are not prestigious enough. True OP didn't use common sense in this incident. I do understand some of his concerns though, the clan he was attempting to join are famous and when it comes to people or clans in the spotlight, you'd expect them to not do shitty things to maintain their fame. It's almost like a certain level of trust is already there for those people/clans which is a global problem, not just osrs. 
---
This comment right here officer 
---
Just cut them down if they bother you so much lul 
---
I did and they replied saying there are 7 months with 31 days where you will get your 31 days worth. Otherwise you just get the month to date every month which could be 28 days during February. So I have to cancel and re do it every month for my 31 days that I bought. Jagex still owes me  a weeks worth of membership. Thanks u/jagexcustomersupport

Thank you! This was incredibly insightful. I'll be attempting DS2 this weekend then. Much appreciated!

never mind, if you haven't figured it out already i just tested by lowering notification for loot to any loot above 1gp. After doing this i got notifications for sand crab imps whilst at the monastery. Therefore it will tell you if you get a champion scroll so long as you have untradeable notifications on

Yeah, I did it for 24 hours straight though. My wrist hurt a bit by the 15 hour mark and by the end I just wanted it to be over. Got over 2 million fishing xp in one go though, that was nice.

Lol I'm with ya. I haven't played since 2007 and will probably never touch it again but from a QA perspective it's so fascinating to watch a game get reverse engineered. There is a whole series someone has done on reverse engineering Mario 64 to beat the game without using the a button.

They just want cannonballs to be made faster, it‚Äôs literally the only real point in the pros column.

Also, it‚Äôs these individuals own choice to make their shit in photoshop and post it on reddit, if the users don‚Äôt like it they don‚Äôt have to.

Your comment comes across as arrogant and holier than thou. Just because you like the idea doesn‚Äôt make it good, creative, or original.

We all know this isn‚Äôt going to pass a poll and come into the game.

It‚Äôs not easier cause you need to not get hit and it‚Äôs much less afk, so making them faster is fair.

Not having 2fa on your email and it gets leaked

Downloading malicious software

There's plenty of ways to access someone's account, but I'd also bet that a lot of the posts here complaining about getting hacked here are lying about the security steps that they've taken.

Dropping all items on death??? The death mechanics are extremely forgiving. Sure, the first time you die you may panic because you don't understand what happened, but you have more than enough time too google how to get your items back and get virtually anywhere in the game to retrieve them.
---
By the time you reach places that they'll be gone for good, the game either warns you it's an instance or you have to be knowledgeable about the game anyway
---
I did it with 77 range, and melee in the 80's. Robert the Strong wasn't that hard, Galvek was fairly easy with brews and rcb+ruby bolts. Just gotta pray right and dodge his attacks, the ruby bolt procs do most of the work tbh. 
---
Occult is in contrast to most magic gear not an accuracy booster, but a damage booster. Should definetly speed up your kills. Magic level AFAIK doesn't affect the max hit of ibans, so that's not rly a point of improvement for now.
---
Getting morytania hard should probably be your biggest priority right now, that's going to give the largest boost, making barrows profitable without relying on armour pieces.
---
This is usually how it happens for me. I play a lot for a long time and get burnt out. Usually what keeps me going is an achievement diary or quest I‚Äôm trying to do.

Mining amethyst, fishing inferbal eel, cutting yew are somewhat decent momey making with high lvl on afking
---
Sorry, but your imagination of the player moderator team is wrong. They are more community focused and host events instead of just everyday going around and muting bots. 
---
And even if a player mod does go around and mute some of these gambling, ad and phishing bots - how long does it last? I'd wonder if it takes even 5 minutes until replacement bots are back. And the other thing is, a player mod mute lasts 1 hour. So they just wait the time and then continue freely as they did before.  
---
The sad truth is that a lot of these people never actually got hacked. I've met many a person who claims they're account was hacked when really they got banned for one reason or another.

One quick read through the email and you can tell it‚Äôs fake unless you aren‚Äôt proficient at English. Also never go by the sending email address because it‚Äôs incredibly easy to spoof.

No absolutely, not criticising the agility requirements, but rather the fact their tied to diaries. For example the draynor one is in the path of very low levels so would make sense to have no req especially with how little bonus it offers and the troll one bumping down to medium so it can still be used rather than stony for lower end players

I did it in Black D'Hide at 70 range with a Dragon Crossbow. Being honest, the Vorkath kill was harder at that level than Galvek. So I think it really doesn't matter.

its not.

You‚Äôre a little confused there, bud.

I don't deal in high quality, I play a pixel game for fun ffs.

True, but you have to remember that people are playing the game for themselves, not you. So you have to expect a little bit of selfishness somewhere.

As for me, I finish the waves. Chances are, my dumb ass will lose the torso and have to get another anyways.

They‚Äôre (poorly) coding these servers from scratch using models, animations, and sprites stolen from the official client back in 2011. 
---
OR, alternatively, you can answer his question
---
Here it is: 
---
~146 possible medium clue scroll steps
---
11 in Morytania with 2 locked behind emote and unobtainable outfit from the area meaning 9 possible he can do
---
Medium clues take between 3-5 steps so let's say on average 4 steps
---
Therefore the probability of being able to obtain a clue set he can finish is:
---
(9/146) * (9/146) * (9/146) * (9/146) = 0.00002%
---
Unless I'm missing or incorrect on any major assumptions then this would be next to impossible in my opinion
---
Planting in POH requires the sapling and also requires to be watered once with can. Unsure about upgraded w/ fairy ring but I would assume it doesn't require replanting.

What do you mean keeping motivation? It's a video game at the end of the day. Don't play a video game you don't enjoy playing.

I mean you don't have to act like a brainlet about it. He has the money and if he had paid for it he'd never have lost it the first time.

if you're inevitable going to die, doesn't that make every hcim series a failed series?

It was like that way before the first wild rejuv came out. Almost every single pvp update has to be tied to a pvm or skilling update or it wont pass.

Well you only had 140M a few weeks ago so is it really a loss?
---
The roll where you have to drop food and lure is absolutely aids imo. Other than that, barb assult ain't so bad.
---
Same thing happened to me but with cave kraken... never went back in fear of seeing "you have a funny feeling like you would have been followed" currently close to 2k on the main still chugging along 
---
Sounds like a reverse whoosh to me
---
Eh everyone's different. I've got some pretty good rhythm so I don't miss a lot of ever. Having the game sounds turned on really really helps too. I think it's broken me though because I'm counting to 3 everywhere. 
---
You a bit simple bud? About the part we've been arguing about since this conversation began. 
---
i did not. in the testing i did, runelite definitely did not track drops if i was too far away, so the guy saying that works is just wrong. But the champion scroll generates a system message even on default client, and i never got an answer on it. 
---
what i started doing was just doing the roc crab cannon and going to chasm of fire to kill all the imps that spawn there and go back to check the rock crab spot. the chasm of fire spawns are more tightly grouped and id always kill them all before there was any worry of an item disappearng... but the scroll dropped while i was standing afk at my cannon so sadly i never answered my question lol.

Hard to say really, I've been collecting since they came out but I've been training different skills in between tasks for diaries etc.
---
It would help if you got overheard prayers too. Would make pvping a bit easier. The account itself isn‚Äôt sufficient enough to out-dps pures. 
---
So like the slayer helm you want to introduce a sort of smithing helm?
---
Could give a nerf of -10% run energy due to the weight but a 10% bonus in smithing xp due to your wisdom to be safe! 
---
I always saw Zeah as a foundation for new things to go in the future. The Woodcutting Guild is great example; it would be hard to fit that in existing areas on the mainland without greatly changing them. But they made the scale of Zeah, like the literal scale of the building, a bit too big and then left too much of it empty. While they could repurpose some for stuff like Watson, it would have been better to leave more open space like the Hosidius Rework is doing that they could later fill than the massive building of a massive city.
---
Kick sand crabs.
---
Its up to 150. The wiki is often wrong about specific things like that. See: every time swampletics tries to look up a drop from a monster.
---
I never even said anything about the keyboard you Little Rock Crab Crasher
---
Just go and grind 75 range/mage and you'll literally do Barrows twice as fast, I really wouldn't recommend doing barrows sooner
---
Wearing heavy armor would give you a large chance to tank the cannonballs in exchange for using more run energy/using inventory space on stamina potions/slower runs without staminas. More heavy armor = increased odds of shrugging off a cannonball, similar to warm clothing and Wintertodt damage. 
---
Wearing weight reducing gear would be more efficient for run energy/inventory space but would make getting hit by a cannonball a guaranteed restart of the course.
---
You could balance the two by wearing 1 or 2 pieces of heavy armor and weight reduction gear for the other slots, or go all-in on either one. Full Graceful for maximized gp and xp per hour with the risk of getting your hourly rates destroyed by misclicks, or full armor for reduced but guaranteed gp and xp per hour. You could AFK it for bad xp/gp rates, or grind it actively for increased xp/gp rates. 
---
Yeah, that's not what I meant. 
---
Thank you for proving my point.

Just about the right agility level too, as you'll want to be doing 40-&gt;60 at Canfis until you get full Graceful, which would be really useful when doing this minigame.
---
The smithing level should only be the level needed to actually smith cannonballs, though.
---
More content in Keldgarim is really badly needed too.
---
Implings
---
what you're gonna wanna do is just stand in the g-e on a low level alt and beg, just take full advantage of anybodys good nature
---
&gt; In the end, a cheater gets what he deserves and OP won't be the last autoswitcher to get scammed by FL.
---
what makes you so certain he uses an autoswitcher? 
---
Thats fucked. Thats the only phase ive never died on
---
Wendy's would totally do this tho 
---
Barrows would be his best source of chaos runes. They would just be a secondary bonus for grinding feral vamps, but could be a magic level or two depending on how long he stays there.
---
most afk methods are pretty bad because if they weren't everyone would be doing them or they are botted heavily. id go with cannonballs or something its around 250k ph and u get smithing xp
---
I am too
---
Yep servers are down 
---
That's not an osrs meme. It's just pepe/fucking normies 
---
A dwarf dwarf you can smith untradable armor for.  And a smelting pet that's a wheelbarrow full of ores, same behavior as mining pet where you can use an ore on it to color it.
---
did a 57 total kill trip :D

Just grow everything you can, rush to 45 farming for the farming guild and contracts and the herb seeds and others come flying in

Anyone know when it‚Äôs getting fixed?

Knowing the boys luck, he'll get it within the next episode.
---
&gt; Lol why did you feel the need to brag about your cpu and you?
---
He was implying people with RGB all over their case don't know how to build a PC when that isn't true and I also happen to have a good PC with a fuckload of RGB so I can be an example
---
login servers down :/ 
---
Quests early on and then contracts contracts contracts.
---
You can get to like 34 via quests, pick pocket master farmers for seeds.
---
It‚Äôs back up now peeps

this is pure shite lad ngl
---
It was just coincidence. But I feel for the same thing so it's okay. 
---
Is this where the "Jagex powerless against PvP clans" comes from?
---
this is your main now
---
That was already the case prior to the update, it‚Äôs just more obvious now. 
---
Thanks to you I have a good phone I only use for OSRS as well.
---
Ur a lame and ur bitch is fucking your relationship councillor 
---
Agreed with this comment and ur flair
---
Counterpoint:
---
For how much cannons speed up tasks, they should be expensive to use.
---
For how easy cannonballs are to make (in terms of both requirements *and* afk potential) they should be slow and bad xp.
---
Cannonballs have sort of always been the Noob way to make money with almost no effort, and I think that's not a bad thing.
---
That being said, I still like this suggestion if it were properly balanced.
---
Back when OSRS came out and items appeared instantly upon death. I noticed a guy died next to me at fire giants &amp; proceeded to loot all of his shit. Got rune boots, platelegs, glory and some other shit. Once he returned, he begging for his items back so I logged out. Actually ended up using those rune boots till 85 slayer lmao
---
Technically reddit osrs is still using it for osrs/osrs content/memes/ players views/ect. So wether or not this is the same computer or not he still isnt lying.

---
Yeah, I really want a torture amulet but no access to 3d printer. 
---
How long can i afk per trip?
---
I think this is a really great idea! 
---
I also think this could be an awesome way to introduce mithril/addy/rune cannonballs into the game.
---
If Asus aren't sponsoring Settled then there's something wrong here.
---
Verf did clue juggling though, he didn't just happen to get all karamja steps.
---
Chinning is always faster than use crossbows unless you're doing a mass. I mean you could all chin if you wanted as that will speed up kills but one of you would need to keep targeting Kree in-between chin hits. Of course 1 of you could simply use a crossbow and not chin to get around this.
---
In terms of gear, last time I checked void range was decent if you're off task but obviously you sacrifice defensive bonuses and I would only recommend this while chinning.
---
I mean if you're chinning you shouldn't take too much damage per kill so bastion potions make a lot more sense as you won't be brewing down as much. 
---
Live in HK, and that is not rush hour lmao.

Most of the time clans band together to crash other clans pking trips, and frontline is a clan which wants quality pkers over quantity.

The biggest challenge for first time Inferno attempts is searching for all the inferno-related strategies &amp; game knowledge that are relevant to your play style. Next week, I'm working on yt guides that will help people find all that info in one place, hopefully you will find them helpful!

As azurest said, practice helps too

Crab race is cool but where are the text posts :(
---
To be honest, I personally don‚Äôt think that swampletics is super interesting. However, I think what he‚Äôs doing provides more of a challenge and is more unique compared to only harpooning sharks because minnows didn‚Äôt exists or prayer flicking for 5 seconds longer because you‚Äôre using a regular whip compared to a tent whip.

this is not a lure. you knowingly gave another player 350m. I think you might get a lot more than just 10k if you went through the stronghold of security. jesus your a dumbass. Of course a well known pking clan is going to take your money, thats the name of the game brother.

Jagex wont respond because they have smol pp

---
There are very few high quality things on this sub.

Depends on the quality you want to go I guess. You could go really in depth and wet-blend all your colours to get all the shadows you like, or you could block out the simple colours and be done

For Zeah I was referring to the redesign proposed by GentleTractor after Zeah's initial release. The original design of Zeah was... interesting.

PvP in every other MMO that I've played had participation medals. Losing team gets a very reduced reward, winning team gets the full reward. In most other MMOs, you don't lose all your gear, and you don't get set back by a lot due to PvP death. Yeah, the risk of death isn't that valued in such games, but you still get some sort of setback discouraging it (e.g. team lose point or you still waste time getting back to where you died). I think RS is the only game with such drastic death mechanics in terms of what could be lost, which I'm fine with. However, the mechanic also makes PvP much less fun for the loser than other games.

Also if you‚Äôve never noticed their fry containers are designed to look like all 3 sizes get taller but they hold the same amount

Dont worry about him, UIM are autistic as fuck

I would've thought persistance was key here though, I mean how many times is someone gonna trade steel bars to a level 3 bot only to lose them all an hour later? Surely with persistence they'd give up eventually due to their losses?
---
It‚Äôs not about the 100k I would rather lose 1m bank value than let a pker get 100k for killing me at a wild boss. I have a pker with 800bh kills and prob double pvp kills and still feel this way 
---
U get slapped by dudes in verac with ags if u make mistakes lol.
---
First things first set up 2 factor authentication on your email and RS account,  get a bank pin, and remember there will be NO double XP for osrs, don't trade other players if you are in the pvp world's, look up common scams and how to avoid falling for them.
---
Adjust ur spam settings on ur email account. Thats fake

Now replace brainlet with rage and we have you, someone who still actually cares about that situation lol

you literally get 60-62k/hr afking at +85 i don't know what you're doing wrong but who cares you can't expect any more from an osrs redditor

On the topic of Vorkath...are they ever going to fucking fix any of the bugs with the encounter? The pathing is absolute dogshit tier and the bug where if youre ctrl clicking to run and do it by accident during the acid phase where you keep on running even with run off and not holding ctrl anymore is so fucking annoying. Its amazing how they cant even make something simple like the acid phase smooth and bugless nor actually fix these bugs in any timely manner.
---
Gear reqs are only around 30M. 
---
I have never done a farm run on my account because I don't know how. My 64 -- nearly 65 -- Herblore is all from Slayer drops, cleaning primaries and making potions, and lamping hard.
---
Yeah if you don't have DFS I'd go with zammy book, law book, or obby shield.
---
I bought a 1070 ti just so i could flip the switch on Runelite's gpu setting.
---
There are plenty of goals you can work around and it depends on what skills you enjoy the most. The best way for new players to get an understanding of the game is through Quests and the Achievement Diaries, together which will round out your skills and reward you in various ways. The Graceful Outfit is a decent grind and requires some dedication, but by the time you get it you will have a decent Agility level which affects anything that involves travel and running. 
---
My personal tip that I recommend is putting all of your XP lamps and XP rewards in Runecrafting wherever applicable. 
---
This is a good guide to follow if you are looking for some direction, but by no means do you have to follow it as is: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide

Fuck your self idiot

Oh yeah, I was thinking you could kill agrith naar with recoils then realised you'd need to kill him to get recoils in the first place.
---
This is so off the wall haha but could you use an imbued heart? There was/is a method using partner slayer that some guy (Tedious?) managed to get 70 slayer at level 3. If one could get superior monsters and get an imbued heart, would it still be possible?
---
oof. you can even see he is mining rune essence in the picture lol. "stefanscapes", step it up bud.

Just waiting for someone to print a wearable slayer helm and start selling those.

It‚Äôs not hacking if you give them all of the log on information that they need. People need to stop relying on twitch as their info source for osrs...

So true, I believe the Draynor shortcut requires a hard diary to be completed to save like what, 4 seconds of time? #useless
---
We're already seeing some of the problems with it, more casual players who don't care about game integrity and don't understand how the game is balanced asking and voting for content that caters to them and makes the game easier. Additionally, Jagex is making the same mistakes that killed RS3, they're never looking at the quality of the content already in the game, and are more concerned about just pushing new content to attract new players.
---
Yes they have the same tick time as a potion. So you can eat them in combo with other foods. 
---
Well 1.2b tbow leaves nothing for gear, and wgile people do it with acb I can see why youd want to wait until you have closer to 1.5b to leave 300m going to something elsr than a tbow

Swampletics would be absolutely boring as fuck if most youtubers did it. The content is asinine and horrible for the most part. The reason it's so good is because of how Settled directs the videos alongside his story telling narrative and just his genuine enthusiasm for the game.

* Didn't you just log in to mobile for this screenshot/karma?

I'm ignored everytime or given a lame excuse.

I got mad respect for people who get 1500+ total level on mobile only, but it's only been out to the public for 7-8 months. Its been in beta no more then a year and a half. I am personally 1825 total level atm on my main and my average runescape day is 12-16 hours. I Started last July.
---
So in less then a year on mobile only you've gotten within 300 total levels of Runelite efficiency? So you're telling me you play 6+ hours a day exclusively on mobile.
---
Bullshit.

Yes

Downvoting so no one sees this and I can reuse the joke.

That's not at all what I'm saying. I mentioned in my post that playing in moderation is perfectly fine, hell I still login every now and then.

What I'm saying is that there is a large portion of this generation spending an unhealthy amount of time on video games. By prioritising games over your lifestyle, you're putting your future in potential jeopardy.
---
There's only so much I can do from text on reddit, I'm not forcing my opinion down peoples throat, I'm not cutting off peoples internet. Everyone still has access to their "free" time and can spend it how they wish.
---
You can do what makes you happy, but think about it, there are many things that can make you happy, but this concept of moderation is starting to fade away. Humans never evolved to find constant gratification in things. Social media is another example of instant gratification.
---
I guess maybe this subreddit isn't exactly the best place for my post to be appreciated but hopefully it will reach some people.

This is the sad reality of working on literally anything with a consumer base. Not only will you never make everyone happy, but you *will* have very outspoken individuals who have nothing better to do than to shit on your work/progress and tell you they don't like their water wet, fix it.
---
The issue is when people want to be mad, too, and then stuff like that becomes the norm; where everyone is just buttmad over mostly non-issues all the time. Then you get burnt out and tired of all the shit and start spawning t-bows outside the farming guild.

I would definitely say invest into a proper mouse to start and you'll definitely be able to get to Jad. If you don't get it it first try then the nerves will calm down every try. It's not about quick prayer switches at all, just being safe and knowing safe spots.
---
I was wondering what he meant. I usually don‚Äôt watch streamers so I was wondering like if that area was a safe zone for some reason. Didn‚Äôt really make sense since he lost his items. 
---
Generally speaking, XP boosting gear is only really worth the time investment if you plan to go for post-99 experience. Mining is sort of an exception because most players train their mining semi-afk at the MLM instead of powermining, so you're going to get the prospector set eventually anyways, although the same concept applies. The upper level upgrade is the most important thing to buy once you have the required level. The increased bag size really only helps slightly compared to upper level.
---
If I were you, I would collect prospector pieces until 1) you finish the set and use it to complete the falador hard diary so that you can use the shortcut by the bank on the lower level or 2) get the level req for upper level. Once you reach the req, sell off as many prospector pieces as you need to afford it (more valuable ones first as they all give the same %).
---
Tl;dr upper level before anything else

I spent 8 hours getting level 5 in each roll with friends on discord it was actually really fun. Just having voice communication makes it so much better

It takes you less than 10min to finish it up, and for kansarin diary you need lvl 5 all roles. 
---
So while you play for yourself, you can also just try to do to others what you wished they would do to you, and admit thst its a super dick move to bail on the last waves. They joined/le tyou join on the assumption that you are going to wave 10, and if you know or plan to leave before then you are tricking them to carry you.

There really needs to be a separate subreddit for Settled content. I know there‚Äôs a lot of overlap, but so much of this subreddits content is just this one Youtuber now that people like, its getting obnoxious.

Did you speak to DN before trying to acquire the task?

Why would you want someone who can barely PK in your singles clan? The entire point is exclusivity. Dying just once for a big set is enough for a lot of them to kick you out if you're barely trusted, and this dude thinks he can buy his way in?
---
If he knew anything about PKing, let alone singles teams, he wouldn't have fallen for this shit. 
---
There is a very good chance the next episode won't be in 6 days. If you actually played OSRS you'd be okay with this because you understand that as you level up more, grinds take longer. One strength level is a full day of afking now practically for swampletics.

Don't be so entitled for free shit and let the man put content out at his pace so it's good.

Nothing says "the coherent arguments I've provided are going over the head of the person I'm talking to so there's no point in continuing" than ending a discussion.
---
Tell me how you plan to get untrimmed slayer cape. Untrimmed rc cape would be big boy, imagine seeing that shit in the wild.
---
I get where you're coming from but using a suffering means you don't need to pay attention to the chat box for when a recoil breaks and allows you to focus more of the fight itself which is pretty important when you're first learning IMO. 
---
same for first half of a pizza.

Yeah that definitely is an impressively high number to me.

Isn‚Äôt the point of a circle jerk that everyone is jerking off the person next to them?

somebody autoclicking knights for a couple hours or buying an inferno cape to pk with meaning they are somehow untrustworthy and that's some big judgement on their overall character as a person is laughably deluded. as i said, go get some fresh air and a bit of perspective.
---
i play this game legitimately and have a lot of exp. some of the best people i've met on this game and closest friends for well over a decade are people that have consistently botted their stats, bought capes, etc. it's a fucking medieval video game chief, lots of people are playing for the fun of something like pking not to spend excessive amounts of time grinding things they don't care about. it's one thing to think that shouldn't be happening. it's another to actively think that an entirely reasonable action from someone to do some of those things is a massive blight on their character and worth ruining a friendship over. it shows a complete lack of perspective and ability to empathize with other peoples situations. IE you are literally fucking autistic
---
At least its just the mole. I did kreeara or whatever her name is and got 1.3k coins. That's it. 
---
No, the whole point of leveling up/progression is to make things easier on yourself. Once you get teleports, tele items, and mine carts unlocked getting across zeah is very easy.
---
Why would you want to devalue cannonballs... Do we really want more cannon whores in the Slayer spots?
---
Was getting bring on task and got crashed a couple times in 200 kc, maybe 3-4? Which I guess isn't awful but was annoying af.
---
Seems as though you‚Äôre right, took him a while to understand I wasn‚Äôt saying the changes were related but in the bigger picture, they could lead to the downfall of the game v2
---
I would disagree I find him playing the game to be rather interesting just because of the research aspect. Most Youtubers dont put in that kind of research into the game and it's awesome to see someone do it.
---
He did it with cheats so nope.
---
Chop root, fletch (Maybe), throw in brazier, relight and fix brazier when needed 
---
Saved everyone a click from your vid 
---
Naaaa, I want that IRL. Of course it would involve some playing together in-game too! üòÅ
---
&gt;I like doing RC.
---
Shit man, that's all you had to say!
---
Can post anything just replace the dot before com with a space

well there is speed running in this game, but it's very veyr competitive. Speedruns of jad, inferno etc, quests, fastest to max etc.

Everyone is in prif

Hey guys. Been a while since I've been on this subreddit, and even longer since I've played. 
---
Has there been any change in the ban appeal process?
---
How? Because you are too bad to get one? L
---
Agreed - just checking to confirm that the 149/9 in the "without juggling section" is a typo and should read 146/9 like the others?
---
And also, by adding then, isn't it implying then that every clue drop is one that he can do? I think I'm not really getting the concept of juggling here since I've never done it
---
rangers is 1/200 only? thats actually not half bad then (in the grand scheme of things it is a lot of course but I mean, it's nowhere near as bad as let's say a visage, DWH or ely drop
---
He completely missed my points in a different chain as well, lol.
---
I get yah. That's why I said I'm not bitching or anything, just explaining what his point was (or at least what I got from it).
---
Nope. 
---
This is not the thread for questions for the devs. This is just the community answering community questions. 
---
Solo pking is always possible, but the point is that scummy tactics like this make pvpers quit which depletes the community which damages the activity. At least in pvm with a tbow scam you don't lose your bank. And to top it off if you quit anyways it doesn't affect the content whatsoever. 
---
I'm not denoting pvp to wilderness pvp. All forms of pvp require a playerbase. No playerbase, no pvp. So when you start killing your own pvp community the result is killing pvp itself. Like look at rev caves. It's a pvp area that is entirely ruined on many worlds because ROT will result to scummy tactics to stop any competition. When ddosing, scamming, and a ton of other dirty tactics are openly used and not shut down you kill the pvp community and start ruining content like with rev caves. Yes rev caves is multi I know. This doesn't change with single though because I'm not talking solely about "group pking ruins pking". I'm saying dirty moves like this post ruin pking. In this post we see how duel arena was abused, not the wild. In single combat ddos is abused. In multi clans like ROT use all sorts of shit to ruin it. These scummy ass actions ruin pvp by themselves, that's something pvm clans could never do for obvious reasons. It's seriously not a reach. 
---
Another issue is you seem to think this is exclusively frontline which is why you say this doesn't even affect wildy. Any of the big pk clans do toxic shit like this as I already explained. Together they ruin pvp content and that's why even most pvpers hate them. This isn't a pvm take or some shit. Even pkers hate these clans and recognize how much they ruin the fun of pvp.
---
Well sure, but this activity would be less accessible and more focus-intensive. Would also potentially serve to narrow the profit margin on cannonballs, thereby adding incentive to use this activity when you're not in need of something super AFK. Might devalue Edgeville furnace cannonball alts but would not entirely kill the option.

I created an RS3 ironman and ive been having a blast so far.

Mage Training Arena for B2P. I underestimated how annoying it could be.

How do you have any way to verify 10 minutes? Are you supposed to sit and watch a spot for 10 minutes before you start training? If you leave, you leave. Not their fault it was empty when they showed up

I pray for your Ironman bro

Funnily enough this is the perfect example of why 2fa removal delay is an awful idea. If reddit had it's way you wouldn't be able to log in for a week with no work around.

Yeah I gave up answering, lol.

There's a lot of ego bruising that goes on in PvM clans, especially the ones that aim to be elitist. The ego bruising usually leads to the dumb shit you'd only expect from teenage girls. In rare cases it's elevated to ddosing/releasing irl info.

Yeah this is probably where I got the term from. I hate asking for free stuff but can anyone get me a set of armor or some free stuff?

Dont worry if this dosnt reach the frontpage I will post the screenshot

That's not really rwt tho unless he did it for irl money.

i will never ever get sick of these

Waves 1-52 are piss easy. Majority of your damage comes from 53-60. 61 and 62 are pretty much free. Just chill on 62 as long as you need to before fighting Jad

I'm talking about your previous comment which stated it far more like it was the expectation.

Instead of increasing the clickbox, perhaps increasing the click radius?

It has an unofficial buyable method. You can pay runners at zmi, it'll be insanely expensive but it's good xp

I like to set up mini goals for myself on my main. I.e get barrows gloves, or get some levels, or knock out some quests. I also recently made a f2p HCIM, and I‚Äôm really enjoying the extra challenge. Got a black kite shield from an ice giant the other day, it felt great

getting fireballs is great, he takes like a 2 attack pause, you shouldn't lose any dps, so its just a free damage reduction

Mage Arena 2 cape, and do the brothers in a better spatial order (start with  Ahrim &gt; Karil, go in a circle) and also use Melee in the crypts

7, yes, that's how many brain cells you have

Genuinely, I want to hear some suggestions from you! I‚Äôm not active in castle wars so I‚Äôm really not too sure. I know it‚Äôs ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù but what are some of the areas that could see improvement?

They look like little monkeys coming together over a random celebration. Good depiction.
---
Just use herbs you get from Farming and Slayer

No way, I've been signing up to double xp weekends and this had existed this whole time?

If I need around 50m what is a quick way, low/med stats happy to grind .  How much can you make per hour? thank you 
---
But it was named rune essence

Update: did get baited, changed password again. Was my fault. This is like the third time this month it‚Äôs happened after I initially got hacked already. Atleast my 400 lobbies are still safe for now./s
---
Advice here is solid.
---
- Buy prospectors
---
- Complete Falador Hard Diary
---
- Sell off prospectors pieces until you regain 100 nuggets 
---
- Buy upper level 
---
After that, I think there are two decent upgrades, but the order depends on what you want to do:
---
- Coal sack: very useful at blast furnace 
---
- Re-buy prospectors: ideal to get first if you‚Äôre going for 99 mining
---
Attach a note to a pigeon and send it to jagex hq
---
You don't verify, if someone comes to your spot within 10 minutes of you getting there, asking you to hop, then likely you took their spot.  If you already had to reset aggro once (10 minutes) then you say tough luck.  Its unlikely a pretend crasher (though possible) will know you just got to the spot and pretend they were there.  
---
Also I've seen people come take my spot as I'm resetting and tried to use your logic, so there are various opinions about what constitutes "leaving" 
---
Which sucks compared with the possibilities.

Adblock is for annoying ads, that would otherwise interfere with watching what the user is trying to do, say watch a video on YouTube. Advertising if done right, doesn't feel like advertising. That's where the Wendy's Twitter account often succeeds.

Rather than that, can we just have the insta harvest like we get with limpwurt roots? Rather than picking each herb individually

Nah it‚Äôs the twitter team. They‚Äôve done a Q&amp;A before. It‚Äôs grouper of 10ish people, most of them millennials and 2 ex-comedians. They‚Äôve gotten in trouble for some of their tweets before so they had to ramp it back.

Hello all! I just recently started playing/playing again and was wondering if any of you fine people could give me some suggestions. I say playing again because I played OSRS for about half a month about a year ago and I also played back in the RS2 days. I have all the F2P quests done and a few Member quests done and have 11 days left on a membership (thanks twitch prime!) and was wondering what a few different methods would be to fully sustain membership though bonds. So far my skills are:

I've looked at things on a wiki, but there is just too much info to parse through and was hoping since you all are much more knowledgeable that you may be able to help me nail down a few methods tailored to my skill set. 
---
Thanks! 
---
What the heck?
---
He becomes  a lot easier once you get the technique down. I‚Äôve been grinding him nonstop this past week. Some quick tips 
---
1.	If using bp, bgs is highly recommended. Dhcb doesn‚Äôt not need it, especially with rigour.
---
2.	Vorkaths special attack is every 7th attack and alternatates to the opposite one each time, therefore, the first special attack dictates the order of vorkaths remaining special attacks.
---
3.	for the acid special attack, head to the tile where the pillar entrance is (where yo climb over). This area will always be acid free, so you should receive no acid damage as long as your correctly timing his 7th attack. 
---
4.	for the ice spawn special attack, using a slayer staff allows you to auto cast crumble undead. Switching stepsons causes your character to stop all action so you won‚Äôt need to worry about your character refusing to attack the minion even though your clicking on it ( this is because you attacked vorkath again ). In addition, having auto cast also allows you to spam click the small ice spawn, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about mid clicking and panic clicking your mage book again. 
---
"a couple sips an hour" I'm going to assume you've never done blast furnace or don't know what a couple means.
---
Can you reliably get one without being scammed?
---
Wow bro this is so kind. thank u, I am happy you're happy
---
I SLI'd my 1080s just for OSRS
---
Gay retard.

Not even a joke...ouch
---
Go make some. Cash...

What items would he even want from med clues? It‚Äôs not like he needs green dhide or a yew short bow
---
Pm me. What console?
---
Mole says pause
---
When in doubt ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak for the community‚Äù
---
nope
---
I did a lot of blast mine at 75 and only got around 450k/hr making very few mistakes
---
Haha! Not a lot of people realize that's where it's from!
---
Exactly there no supply so prices are high. That's why he wants to sell the nest so when they come back and the price crashes he will have already sold off his nests and can still make a profit. You proved his point.
---
I do! But i dont feel the need to trade tho haha but my favorite games

Weird. Somehow managed to get off to this. Thanks

I've done 5 or so quests and dont know where to continue. Other people suggest iron man but I dont know how to initiate it even after reading walkthroughs. Quests like the Knights Sword are supposed to be beginner but my stats are just too low to survive. Same with Demon Hunter.

An inventory of 25 steel bars would take at least 150 seconds + bank time to convert into cannonballs. Let's say this minigame is at most 50% faster, so that would be around 100 seconds per lap, not including failures/inactivity.   
---
At 300xp per lap, that is \~10k agility xp/hr, which is the equivalent of the level 10 Draynor Village rooftop course.   
---
Normally using a steel bar grants 37.5 xp, but with cannonballs it provides 25.6 xp per bar. I picked the 300xp number because it would convert that "lost" smithing xp into agility xp at the same rate.   
---
For comparison, I believe the agility pyramid is about 25k xp/hr and 200k gp/hr, which would provide both more experience and profit.
---
Finally an update that reflects my endgame goals
---
Because taking damage is very rng based, and if it were the case then training it would be very awkward and impractical 
---
Those numbers are only if you have a coal bag, which is a ~10 hour grind at MLM
---
So the real problem is Runecrafting. /s
---
Nothings gonna change, you no longer find the game fun. Read up on the sunk cost fallacy. Sure, come back for a bit every once in a while but truthfully, there are better things to do.
---
You can do much longer trips with Dragon Hunter Crossbow

I think one of the reasons this sub is great is because the mods don't try to cover up toxicity or push an agenda like other subreddits. If something is legitimately bad people will downvote it appropriately (the way Reddit is supposed to work, wow!). We do a good job of filtering out content on our own. You have to be able to laugh and have that freedom, not live in a confined bubble with fragile people.
---
For comparison, I used to play GW2 and their subreddit has essentially turned into a safespace for furries and delusional fanboys. It's one of those bandwagon communities where you can't say anything bad about the game/players. I love it in Runescape when people go out of their way to insult me and call me names. I think it's hilarious and I wouldn't trade that away for a braindead MMO where everybody is "friends" and has to resort to passive aggressive insults. 
---
Sorry you had to read it bro.

Why don't you shut up you edgey fuckin shock wannabe "too soon?" meme hero butt munch.

Your testicle has cancer.

You shouldn‚Äôt look at financial output as the only, or primary, output of a skill. Especially a combat skill. 
---
That's only like a 0.08% chance of occurring. Is it incredibly unlucky? Yes, but not impossible/improbable.
---
Make sure your friend spoke to Oziach, otherwise just keep killing!
---
Would mining be a good skill to do while afk in order to make money in the future?
---
Other macro efficiencies to consider: 
---
Mining and crafting after 99 RC, Karamja elite diary before 99 slayer, 99 wc before 99 firemaking, 99 farming with just calquat, papaya, and mahogany (the long term plan on that one may have changed in recent updates, not sure).

Stopped doing the quest, took me ages to go from destinations..

It was a scam, he took off with the money

Saving login info on mobile is broken.

I probably wouldn't have gotten my fire cape without RNGesus on my side. I swear that I tanked like, 4 not prayed Jad hits and never ate.
---
big oof :)

I have been wondering as well. Guy hasn't uploaded since. I fee like something fishy went on, and I'd love to hear from someone who knows more.
---
I‚Äôm 94 range and blow piping him, I get 2 kills avg. full void, Slave Ammy imbued, archer ring imbue, dhide boots, addy dart in blowpipe. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the only way to 3+ is 99 range and/or dhcb
---
Dude it‚Äôs worth a shot. You‚Äôre only waiting money on pots so you can try a run and see where it goes, if you think you can then invest in pots and try again. 
---
I‚Äôd look up a good video guide of it, and it‚Äôs honestly not that hard.

Your original account is no longer in OSRS. It has been migrated over to RS3. Old School Runescape (this game) launched in 2013.

Your welcome

What about RuneScapes biggest challenge, the Theatre of Blood? 
---
That's a weird way to put it, but damn it you're not wrong.
---
Well since osrs came out in 2013 your account from 2010 doesnt exist on here anyway do you are really just wasting time trying to recover an osrs account that is lvl 3 on tutorial island that the name has already been cleared off of
---
"105 wind strike casts"
---
they have mule bots
---
I prefer RS3 Ironman, no mtx, no acomplishment devaluation. Better than OSRS in case of gameplay
---
I started barbarian fishing at level 58 to just grind xp to 76. Then I wanted sharks for food. That's just what I wanted, though. And skip banking.
---
Ah, a cultured man.
---
Not really the case for ironmen
---
Lol how is this being upvoted you have clearly zero experience pking in a clan or otherwise
---
Dude if you don't remember any usefull information, what makes you think you would ever get the account back?
---
What do you seem to take damage from most? Not having correct prayers? Not switching armor in time? Not standing on the correct tile? Toxic gas damage? Snakeling damage? Venom damage?
---
Cant remember the doc he was in, can remember that he went to give someone a bj but really csnt remember why or for who lol, can someone please remind me?? 
---
Ah, I got it now
---
Yeah, rn if I actually kill him, I'm out of food. 96 range. 
---
Turns out I'm just garbage at this game and just go rc.
---
Actually fucking dumb lmao
---
Is this confirmed or some tinfoil hat conspiracy theory shit? I'm just curious since there's no way Jed has only played into RoT's bag during his stint at  Jagex.
---
Terrible
---
ZUlrah is hard to learn keep at it
---
Well even if a normal player can't get inferno cape still is quite a few "not normal" players
---
0 time spores via the underwater activity?
---
Where exactly are you taking damage? What gear are you using and what stats do you have? Generally people do Zulrah at 85 Magic/Ranged. The Ring of Suffering is probably the most essential piece of equipment for killing the Snakelings. 
---
Not anymore it isn't.
---
Not anymore since yesterday's update
---
I think the newer herb patches (aside from this one) do have an increased clickbox. Check out the Weiss herb patch, could help you make a future graphic for this.
---
I'd start again, honestly. 
---
lol comparing abilites to controls. nice gymnastics.
---
You say that but I never struggle to run into people. There's fewer noobs around but slayer spots and hunter spots are often so packed that you struggle to find a world, and even doing things like barrows you're rarely alone. There's a lot more instancing and quest locked areas that people hide in but, especially on more populated worlds (of which there's 140, the main reason it feels so dead), you'll virtually never be alone. 
---
If that‚Äôs how you think a normal discussion is supposed to go then I‚Äôm really sorry for everyone who interacts with you.
---
600 out of 200k players ?
---
Don't think its been anywhere near 3 months
---
No, you're just assuming. It's not obvious, not even close. 
---
Ah he must know Candice
---
I think I played osrs for a few hours in 2014/15
---
This update allows people to use noted molten glass to create teleport spheres in Dorgesh Kaan. It was a pain to make a bunch of them at once and by virtue makes that city slightly less dead content to the people who actually want to visit there. 
---
Imagine having to unlock a teleport instead of instant access. 
---
one time a guy brought his main in full ancestral 5lto barrage them off me lol
---
Funny enough when agility was released in RSC, run energy didn't exist.

Yeah guy just dipped with the money haha
---
It's magic.

Swampletics wants to know your location.

I need someone to talk to not an auto form that requires exact spelling and dates

wel its about 4000 dollar, he aint gonna make that much with his youtube :p

Why did you apply to the top pking clan when you have no pking experience?

Actually if you cheat in runescape you're a fucking loser and I don't need you as a friend.

ü¶Äü¶ÄAGAINST PVP CLANü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Just did this thank you,and yeah I keep seeing them pop up on facebook etc.
---
I mean it‚Äôs all subjective but I think he‚Äôs a good content creator who puts ungodly amounts of time into the videos.
---
Many restricted Ironman don‚Äôt become popular because the owner can‚Äôt crank out enough content when it takes hundreds of hours to do anything.
---
Settled is doing insanely impressive amounts of content and releasing it regularly
---
Got it on my fourth try. Just focus on getting to the safespots asap
---
Super extended anti fire, antidote++, range pot, keep walk on. Don‚Äôt try to be fancy and woox walk. Keep it simple until you‚Äôre more comfortable.
---
He has 6 attack phases before he will do acid or do the skeletal scorpion add.
---
If you get the acid as the first special attack then the next is the minion he spawns.  They‚Äôll always alternate. The only one you cannot anticipate is the first special attack.
---
On acid phase it‚Äôs easy to just pick 5-6 tiles without acid and then just keep walking back and forth. Make sure to click to the side you‚Äôre not walking to BEFORE reaching the tile visually, you character doesn‚Äôt update as fast as your actual hit box. 
---
Your kill times will be like 1 minute 45 seconds to 2 mins 30 seconds. It‚Äôs not the best, not the worst, but just take it slow and get s good feel for the rhythm of the fight. 
---
*yoink*
---
They‚Äôre sexier than yours!
---
Fast food companies have started using memes in hopes of getting more followers, seems to be working too.
---
super cool story 
---
Happened both on phone and laptop. Tried to claim twitch prime which was supposedly available for another 4 days
---
I'd be curious what the rarest item actually is now to think of it. I'd imagine the 3rd age tools would be up there. Untrimmed Slayer is probably rare too.

I think some other replies have already touched on this, but you dont need graceful.
---
I pretty much never ran out of run energy even with full tank gear. I personally go with bcp, d legs and d boots and dont need to use food or prayer on most runs. This is with lesser defense than you as well.
---
As for the order of the brothers, I go dharok,ahrim, and karil, praying against all 3. From there, the order doesn't matter to much. I just use up whatever prayer I have left and tank the rest.

Downvoted.
---
Imho, right now the only reward is usefull for pures so a addition to the reward systeem would fit, also for lower lvls its verry hard to influence the game since there can only be one cader there is not much to do, giving the wall catapult a decent User interface or an extra way of doing damage would help alot with game interaction for lower lvls, also right now its common for people to log an alt to "waste" the baricades which usually means a lost game these "sabo" hurts the fun alot. I love CW for nostalgic feels and pvp practise yet it gets harder to enjoy since it feels dated..... well this is my cup of thea on the subject

If someone's ever crashing you just bully them relentlessly about their runecrafting or farming level. Works every time

Hahah makes sense, here‚Äôs the prototype recipe:

1 oz rum (light or dark doesn‚Äôt matter)
---
1 oz banana liqueur 
---
1 oz amaretto 
---
3 oz orange or pineapple juice (not sure what would taste better)
---
Shake and strain into glass
---
Garnish with candied banana and a cherry 
---
In 2016, Chinese live-streaming services have banned people filming themselves eating bananas in a "seductive" fashion.

Eh in all honesty you might as well grab a super att and super str, it's way cheaper than a super combat and it'll dramatically increase your xp rate
---
eewww a fandom link
---
Actually, he isn‚Äôt right. 
---
The rules clearly state using macros is not allowed.
---
If you intentionally break the rules for your own benefit, that is a signal of bad character.
---
It‚Äôs pretty straightforward. 
---
I wonder why I‚Äôd hit mr ‚Äúrule breakers are justified because stats take a long time to do so therefore I am allowed to cheat because i am special and my time is more valuable than anyone else‚Äôs you fucking autistic loser‚Äù with a big yikes my dude
---
Can you stop spamming your reuploaded videos on reddit?
---
Wasn't crack the clue solved years ago?
---
That's actually pretty sensible
---
Check out the [OSRS Wiki Slayer Masters](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slayer_master) page. It's normally recommended to use the highest master you can.
---
Konar is a bit special btw. He'll not only assign you a monster to kill... But also where to kill it. Sometimes these tasks take longer (since you can't always go to the best place), but they're more rewarding. Up to you if you think that's worth it or not.
---
Most slayer tasks average 100 combat and can do 200 kills/hr, so you get about 2 keys/hr
---
Well, any monster with acess to the rare drop table does
---
Are you saying you just don't like how the cape looks, like it looks like a cosmetic shop item? Then sure you're entitled to your opinion.
---
But "all the capes look like RWT" means you're accusing everyone of cheating to get the cape. Then you're getting downvoted by people who did the Inferno legit. 
---
You can never replace my EmilyIsPro nudes üíî
---
Free shit my nebro
---
Yes yes it is
---
Would be cool i think for a limited time event and i was thinking more a drop at the end depending on damage you have inflicted not a drop just as it dies, plus pvmers have it very very easy and if they died then thats on them as its a limited time fun community event and theyre choosing what they bring with them
---
Oh god, it burns!
---
you're not taking peoples spots then. youre getting crashed.
---
It's alright in January 2020 Win7 goes EoS so they'll have to 
---
this feels a bit cringe
---
Guy kept running up to check my cannon, after checking his then walking to the spot below where he would stand, then walk up, consistently every min or so... Hadn't seen such a blatant bot in a while lol.

Or just... y'know... make them outta paper?

You can also right click the spell to tele outside even when your left click is set to inside

If your looking for a raiding partner so am I :)

Oh wow a throwback RS photo where the kid is actually wearing a t shirt 
---
I was under the impressions that osrs made all the spawn rates the same. Off a quick search I couldn't find anything on this.  
---
I just kill all 3 since I can't seem to avoid prime to just do rex+supreme. I would rather just use costly BIS items to kill each before the next spawns.  I can normally finish a whole slayer task of them this way in one inv. 
---
I had one pre eoc with all the other Armour pieces :)
---
Oh my god lmao
---
Again, fuck you and fuck your garbage YouTube channel.
---
Well you already used the customer support and it got denied. So when you take to twitter and tweet at the customer suport should they just ignore you or reiterate what actual customer suport already told you? You are the one that reached out on twitter not them.
---
In general it would be ring of dueling
---
grand exchange (varrock toggled med diary )
---
edgeville (5m)
---
seers village (36 steps ). 
---
faladaor (39 steps)
---
I don‚Äôt think it would *actually* be the best thing to implement, but iirc RS3 has a system in place for boss pets, and in League i believe crits are handled the same way.
---
Runelite, no competition 
---
Pest control actually gives very good rewards that motivates players, LMS was introduced as a "skill-based?\* sand casino, didn't go so well
---
Or perhaps egg whites to make it frothy

Is barbarian the same fishing XP per hour as fly fishing at 58? Or atleast similar?

Oh shit, I actually saw these guys at Redrocks in Colorado before Odesza went on. My brother and I were taking a break of OSRS at the time and they preformed this song and it agave us a good laugh since we hadn't played in a while.
---
iconic
---
Definitely 
---
And Settled has fewer good clue rewards than Verf does, he has range gear thanks to Karil's and has good amulets. His upgrades would basically be adamant pick/hatchet, ranger boots and Power Ammy (and only until he finds a dragonstone). 
---
if you aren't using runelite you aren't really playing the game
---
It's not avoiding prime, it's just praying mage the whole time and tanking supreme. You'd probably make more gp/hr with some adjustments, but if you're happy with your setup, then great. 
---
You've obviously never been to a world 301 drop party
---
Also, usually not trying to use objects on people or other objects
---
There are better and less crowded places to train. If you choose sand crabs, probably the most competitive training spot, then complain about being crashed, I think you deserve it. 
---
Bro, chill with the hard r
---
fair point.
---
Whats with the title, are players not allowed to contact the Jagex Support on Twitter?
---
Also that player clearly already got customer support earlier.
---
Oh Woops typo, thanks for the correction!
---
No it's implying that every 800 kills he should be able to get a step that he can do. There will be clues in between he can't do.
---
Yah comparatively rangers aren't actually too rare. 
---
You just need to lift
---
As far as cerb goes for protection prayers, you do mage range melee when the kill starts. Pray mage throughout until the spirt things come. Pray accordingly to the spirt things if they come out, then back to mage for the rest of the fight.

The skin care effect of shampoo is just as important as the oil cleaning effect. Take care of your skin boys

Jagex does not use Reddit as customer support, the players do. They are the ones requesting support, don't you think?

Ah yes. The off brand Swampletics.

I'll eat it

He's a personality-less Aussie cunt that steals enemy ultimates who has Zoe's passive but in an AOE. Basically an AP bruiser. Can be played pretty much anywhere and despite being super bland as a character has really fun gameplay.

Just so I'm understanding this comment, JMods should browse around for ideas from the community to add and not worry about what they want to work on?
---
Shift left click. Not even worth doing diaries for.
---
Go on the unrestricted worlds as max with arma, throw, SERP helm. In this way you can work primarily on your positioning and remembering which phase is next. You don‚Äôt need to switch gear and only switch from ranged to mage. Mark tiles as well. Zulrah is almost 100% memorization. 
---
Last Dinosaurs are actually a sick band tho
---
Lol my friend just recently did the stupid thing of getting phished for that and lost like 70m. I know its not really much, but when you never learn bossing its a lot to make from slayer only.
---
Could always just turn it into a main like I recently did with my pure, then when you want to play on a pure again just make a new one, as building a baby pure takes like a day.
---
More Jmod smackdowns on reddit right here

I lost so many Guams to this. Jagex plz fix

Mazchinima tends to give slayer tasks in the slayer quite often. Would've easily gotten quite a few thousand slayer xp

Cannon squah in the north or south? 
---
Ah, yes, single player RuneScape, the best way to play.
---
Not even being sarcastic, I do that too. Mostly cuz of the fuckin rng bots at ge

It‚Äôs a great idea, but Jagex doesn‚Äôt know what quality assurance is

Question: Why is my friends list full of names like that? deleted characters?

coal bag and 60 smihting, technically you can do with less smithing it's just a little more annoying. you'll make about 750k/h doing mith bars with current prices, bear in mind that if you get impatient and raise how much you're paying for coal it dents the profit significantly. also, this method is just really subject to coal prices in general. 
---
Give a small chance use the herblore skill to turn it in to penicillin.

I like RS3, lots of new quests and content. Legacy has been a thing and I always use them. Old combat system is superior in many ways.
---
Only thing I still miss is pre-EoC Dungeoneering, when it was more challenging. Nowadays it feels like a complete joke even on Legacy.
---
It does feel as if the gap between OSRS and RS3 is too huge and 2010-2012 would have been perfect.
---
Im 99 range with elite void. Its only possivle to do max 3 kill trips. The ranged attacks hit very often and will eat up your food.

Osrs is the only place I've ever had good luck. (Typing this from my work computer on my last day at this job because I'm getting let go due to corporate restructuring.)

Yup, thats a confirmed woosh

How you gonna decide who‚Äôs a pker or not lol

Lol same here

No but it started working again since this post. Odd

Lol yeah. Fuck if I know. I just heard they'd do it and would like to know if they're going through with it or not.

Thanks! We really enjoy making the cracker sets and party hats. Come in so many awesome colors

I forgot that him doing that was a thing.  i actually remember watching him die during fremmy trials a couple times if im not mistaken. 
---
Can we take a second to appreciate "Tempest"? Straight 90's Final Fantasy/Castlevania boss fight vibes, I love it.
---
I took some guys spot the other day and he came back on his main to 1hp dh the crabs so i couldn't get xp. I left to make a sandwich and came back to him laughing at me for xp waste while i ate my sandwich and watched him kill sand crabs on 2 accounts as i stood afk
---
Learn how to take a screenshot
---
Hahaha nah Im not interested in 99s. I play casually because I actually have things going for me outside of osrs lol
---
No not anymore
---
Would of traded out the snek for a mutagen tbh
---
Doesn‚Äôt look shopped to me I‚Äôm no expert tho 
---
Oh, but it actually is. 
---
Support. RS3 actually has a quest in the dwarf questline that require to dodge and take cover from cannon fire.
---
*cough* bank rework *cough*
---
Every step he gets has to be in morytania because he can't leave.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but this series started in June of 2018, Swampletics started in December of 2018. So how is this a copycat?

The models for the female char and these armours were made YEARS ago with no regard for trying to sexualize the female characters, 
---
I highly doubt Andrew or Ian Gower decided to ‚Äúshow a little skin‚Äù for female chars to ‚Äúturn on‚Äù the pre pubescent kids that played runescape 2 back in 2002.
---
I doubt initial graphic design in 2000 carried any sort of malicious intent to overly sexualise the female character and its respective armour components.
---
What you shouldn‚Äôt do is over react to a couple of pixels that were formed in the basement of the Gower residences which didn‚Äôt plan for future repercussions for showing off a little pixel skin,it was probably just to differentiate the genders and make it appealing for females to have their own char in a game dominated by males.
---
I‚Äôm sorry to hear your Wife is being constantly harassed on RuneScape, it is something that should be stamped out of society by educating young men, but the inevitable will happen, there will be guys who have never talked to women or never comfortable with them either harassing them, calling them names such as sluts etc.
---
I have NEVER looked at the female armours or the female character as something sexual in my entire 15 odd years of playing RuneScape, I doubt many others here have worked up a fetish from slight pixel skin, maybe a horny teenager going through puberty might have ripped one in honour of it but no reasonable adult is going to get off that.
---
Since you are married, you need to understand the demographics of the user base, there are going to be immature, desperate young guys who will jump at the opportunity to constantly talk to a RuneScape Friend especially if it is indeed a female.
---
If in game reports do not suffice, take screenshots of harassment and email them to jagex. Also a very good way to cut out toxic chat is to set your public chats and Friends chat to private so you only chat with people you want to, it‚Äôs not like guys on this game haven‚Äôt been harassed by toxic keyboard warriors, just add them to the ignore list and get on with your life.
---
Maz is horrible at her job. Findings cleaning did not need a buff as it was one of the small boring 'grinds' of the game. I think this game, being a 2007 game in it's core, should have more content like that, unfortunately, they ruined it.
---
Does OSRS also have the same problem as RS3 with protection prayers not reducing damage from attacks after the boss dies?
---
I bet it gets really hot in that sub
---
Should be on the wiki, might have to do a little math
---
No I'm not doing anything for you. I'm just maintaining the moron bit until something to the contrary happens. 
---
I'm baffled that you went out of your way to take the original post completely at face value.  
---
Every idea posted in this subreddit is nothing more than 'pay-dirt' that you have to put through the MLM water-wheel machine that is Reddit, to get the actual ore (so to speak).   
---
Some of it is coal, some of it is runite ore.  
---
   
---
The assumption you just made on my behalf assumes that this idea would be added to the game EXACTLY as it was typed. Which has essentially never happened in the entire history of OSRS. All ideas have been tweaked and modified to some extent. 
---
"Just because you like the idea doesn't make it good, creative, or original."   
---
Again you're putting words in my mouth.  
---
Read my original comment. Not ONCE did I say it was "good". I said it was creative and original. And it is. To argue against that is literally dumb AF. There was no idea, and then *poof* there was a new idea that nobody has ever thought before. That's literally what those words mean.  
---
RAW creative 'pay-dirt' ideas are absolutely what churns this Subreddit. I have not yet seen a single Reddit post that ever got it right on the first try. In fact, majority of the time the real idea is in the comments section. 
---
      
---
And please if you're going to reply, read this before you put more words in my mouth:

max efficiency it's not much more than an hour.
---
The posters above say a clue step from any clue of the same difficulty counts towards the step count, so from my limited understanding you would just need 4 clues with the initial step in mory. 
---
How exactly am I  getting supplied with cannonballs when I play on ironmode only?
---
I edited my post and gave you an example. Are you happy? 
---
Is this real?
---
&gt; Why is it most suggestions come from Jmods tho?
---
It's literally part of their job? If jagex just wanted coding slaves they'd fire literally the entire current dev team. Having devs with ideas/thoughts of their own is a good thing, they may see areas of improvement/good ideas that the community hasn't thought of.
---
One thing RS3 did recently for their Comp Cape poll was split it into two identical polls: one for everyone and one for players who currently owned a Comp Cape. I think something like that may be helpful in OSRS so they can see what the overall community wants and what the subcommunity wants. The issue is how they use that information; for example, if it passed the general poll but failed the subcommunity poll, does it get added and how do they decide? Also, it is not always easy to define subcommunities. Like if you are polling a Hydra change, you could make the subcommunity poll require Hydra KC but if it is something broader like a PvP change, how do you count a PvPer? Especially since some PvP changes aren't just limited to Wilderness, BH, and PvP worlds and they could impact Clan Wars, Castle Wars, and other forms of PvP.

Did he think the twitter support account would give him a different answer? Maybe he needs some help with read comprehension?
---
Apparently, I'm honestly shocked. I had no idea this sub and game were so infested with incel losers. It's honestly really sad.
---
yes thats correct, sorry my wording was bad. He has to get 3-5 complete-able steps, spread out across multiple clues, to have a chance at getting a casket. Doesn't matter if the next step isn't in morytania as long as he has enough to get to that threshold
---
I JUST did the museum cleaning right before they updated it T\_T
---
It was terrible.  I spent hours Picking up rock. cleaning rock, picking up rock, cleaning rock.  It just went on and on and on.
---
On top of that, it rewards no xp, gives you a bunch of pointless junk, and is all RNG so has no sense of progression, even after you do get a worthwhile item.  It's a piece of content that just feels like a bully that spits on you and calls you a little bitch,  but you can't do anything about it.

Although this update fixes none of these problems, at least it takes out the worst part of the task- straight tedium.
