I think he said he lives with his parents. They probably didn't want him streaming. I've also been wondering where he was because he had a really cool idea for an ironman.

Light up a blunt and forget all about it. *It's all gone now*
---
I would love a quest line focusing on the events of the original God Wars.
---

---
RS3 did the whole apocalypse mahjarrat-line and the line where gods literally come back to us. (the latter of which I didn't like because it made the player out to be too much of an omnipotent hero) 
---
OSRS now did a line on the dragonkin (even content without quests has dots relating to them) which I love, we could somehow dig up the original God Wars and find out what happened precisely. With Seren and the elves coming up, we could do the other side with perhaps Zaros and find out what happened during the god wars.
---
Maybe after all there is a reason both Seren and Zaros are so quiet. Something we don't expect at all...

The problem is that you can get your account recovered without them having access to your email. 
---
So while extra security on your email is good to make sure it's not compromised, it doesn't help you at all if they recover your account. 
---
Sell them fpr tokkul and then buy am onyx
---
This post is d√©j√† vu
---
You don't need access to the account email to recover an account. 
---
You can sell them for tokkul to the rune shop in Tz-Harr land. Then buy an onyx woth earned tokkul.

I don't think I can handle this after everything that's happened

Because it's more beneficial to keeping the people that give them money playing the game.

Probably something you‚Äôre doing wrong

Herb runs every 80 minutes for sooo much money
---
I'd say atleast 7.
---
But did they get a spade tho
---
Can he smack my ass with his third leg?
---
Get 72 slayer, safespot skeletal wyverns. It‚Äôs the easiest one for you. Afterwards when u got some money then you can do brutal black dragons at 77 slayer. 
---
This is low intensity stuff. I‚Äôve never done barrows  because as a noob i chose the ‚Äúkilling ents‚Äù and slayer road. 
---
Barrows is luck based and requires a hard diary, while what i did was more consistent. + you can watch tv shows while it.
---
There are obby pures with 5, 10 or 20 attack and plenty of 30 attack f2p pures. I would make them usable on any material from bronze to rune, sure most will be used on rune, but you have the option to use them on a steel scim for your 5 attack pure too.
---
Damn that's crazy, nice one man.
---
Okay some advice then, dont rwt you wont be banned.
---
Not sure what ccnetminder was talking about, but if you have significant coin going in (~300mil) you can buy magic seeds and plant pots to make magic seedlings. Use humidify spell on pots. Wait. Turns over ~4+mil per hour.
---
Strfuck
---
There is! You can secure your account (reset password, check for any malware etc) and then start the grind of making everything back.
---
Make them usable on any weapon of any material up to rune.. So one kit for saradomin, usable on scims, swords, daggers etc
---
Came here from your newer post. I think I like this one more but I seriously love the concept and fun you‚Äôre having with these

I see, does that mean that I can't recover an account after a month without a proper computer, or can I avoid downloading osrs on my clunker?  
---
tl;dr at what point for lower level players (80 att/str/def, 82 mage, 87 range) is it worth doing Vorkath over Zulrah? I can consistently get 2 kills per trip, 15 kills per hour at Zulrah, but since I have low Construction and Agility levels I need to use Zulandra teleports and have slow resupply time, so supply cost included I net 1m gp/hr without uniques at Zulrah (since I haven't gotten anything except a Jar of Swamp...). I have about a 40m bank, and use blessed d'hide, Ahrims, ring of suffering, blowpipe and toxic trident. I think I can't get any faster kill times at this point besides leveling up and upgrading gear.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Would I be able to make as much money at Vorkath with these stats as at Zulrah? I believe the gp/kill is roughly the same at the two, but I assume that Vorkath has much lower supply costs. I think banking time would be roughly equivalent since my PoH sucks. If the kills per hour is roughly the same at the two with my stats, then this is what I think the comparision is:
---
Vorkath Pros:
---
\- Only have to focus on ranged leveling/gear instead of ranged + magic
---
\- Lower consumables cost and thus more gp/hr
---
\- Ava's assembler needs Vorkath's head anyway
---
Vorkath Cons:
---
\- \~40 hours to complete DS2, get void, and learn Vorkath. Could spend this time training range/magic for Zulrah and earning $ from the profit snek
---
\- Boss music doesn't even come close to Zulrah's
---
Sorry for the long post. Any help is appreciated!
---
They could be used to construct a demi-boss in the empty room on the museum with Fossil Island themed drops.
---
I mean you leveled some skills up, is it really that bad?
---
Yep, as of the 07/February/2019 game update (X marks the spot), you no longer lose favor even if you don't lock it in.
---
He said worth doing? I'm sure rs3 probably has more bosses than osrs.
---
F2P won't get this. 
---
I think he's meaning from just one birdhouse 
---
What other guy said except that warding is basically just crafting #2 and isn't a good idea.
---
Liar liar pants on fire &gt;:( there are runs where you even lose money. 
---
The seeds and herbs prices are too close because of the major supply of farm runners. 
---
Also herb runs are tedious without herb sack. 
---
This has been an issue for the last couple decades. It's not going away.
---
Maybe even 8...?

He‚Äôs talking bout herb runs

Ok I should have specified. For F2P weapons, you always discern what the item is based on blade shape and length.

What does the "jagex are powerless against a pop clan" one actually mean? Never really understood that one

his main is 2k+ total lol

Exactly dude people can get a t bow first raid and be rich instantly every one thinks if they're low level they bought gp, people have thought i bought gp in the past being low level and fair wealthy but no if you just grind you'll make millions no matter what the total level
---
I remember zybez radio in swiftkit. They had actual disc jockies. Shout out to Dj Pace for always playing the pokemon theme song anyone ever threw into the request box.

All in line the swift kit client in early 2010s. This magic is indeed possible in rl and can even be expanded in such ways like above!
---
He said 2 months. Clearly he force spawned genie randoms every 5 minutes.
---
A lot of accounts get hacked and used for botting. Look into whether your stats are higher than when you quit.

No worries. It's obvious you have no idea what you're talking about.

Still not worth it when he could be doing other shit

Is it possible to start/finish the Mage Arena miniquest by boosting from 56 to 60 magic with a magic potion?
---
No, when i came back there wasnt much in my bank, only items for quests i already did, i just went back and made the necklace, i need to get the notes again i guess, this is what my quest log says, everything else above this step is completed - [https://i.imgur.com/lpMGKu8.png?1](https://i.imgur.com/lpMGKu8.png?1)

Hey I‚Äôve just started my RC journey. Got back into the game a couple weeks ago and relearned how to play (stopped playing 12 years ago!) and decided I wanted to do 99 RC. That and fishing are just the only ones I can see myself getting to 99 without hating life. I‚Äôm at 60 for both right now but gonna just focus on RC for now. 
---
Hope I get to 99 and that sick pet too, don‚Äôt even have a cat yet. Wish me luck, you‚Äôve just achieved my goal lol
---
Vorkath for the majority and I'll do some farming and pking to break the grind up 
---
I'd appreciate this too.
---
Yea there were alot of weapons of it, loved using the baxe in f2p lol
---
The problem with group is that when your teammates quit they may have items saved in their bank rather than the shared bank so you can lose a lot of items, and another thing to consider is if you should be allowed to remove someone ffrom the group and add new people to the group (again in the case of all your teammates quitting). Lots of details to be ironed out though but I hope they add the game mode
---
havent missed a step, got necklace back and thats in the 2nd cave. only thing im missing is the bone shard/key which is 1st cave
---
Ayyy the HP pavilion, I had one of those.

I‚Äôm mad about it. Congrats man!

I‚Äôd definitely play it.

Haha sea shanty 2 the second sea shanty song in the game old school runescape which you unlock by going to Port Sarim, the port south of falador, west of draynor village, and east of rimmington, you can get there by using the rat pits teleport, teleporting to falador and walking south, or using an amulet of glory to draynor village and walk west. There is a shortcut between draynor village and Port Sarim but you have to have the lumbridge/draynor medium diary complete. Another way is by taking a boat to Port Sarim from various locations throughout the game or even teleporting to your house and walking east of rimmington. This is how you unlock sea shanty 2 the second sea shanty song in old school runescape unlocked in Port Sarim 
---
If you get lucky and Jad spawns on the South(?) side you can get the healers stuck behind him after you aggro. 
---
Where's the humor tag, OP?
---
The quest log for this quest is funky. You just need the Bone Shard for the final boss, and you get that with the corpse. So you have to be searching in the incorrect spot, or already have it in your bank, or there's actually a bug. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/File:Ah_Za_Rhoon_map.png

But its kinda sad that you're saving up for something that will be valuable and in the time of your progress you just lose it all.
---
Agility is my favorite skill, I have it on both accounts.
---
Nice

I believe no because the staffs require 60 magic to wield and you can't boost to equip items.
---
Lol me too thought that would be funmy! Fire cape drop is great first time around.

Guy is wrong. You can get a rare drop as long as you have at least 1 point. 
---
Because you want everyone to feel sorry for you 
---
hot take, calling someone cute for being new to something is patronizing

no thats the correct cave, i got the beads for necklace from the table in the other cave, when i go to the final cave door it just says its a bone lock, not in the bank just double checked

Tbh it isn‚Äôt *as good* as it seems Jagex employees are known to be underpaid and ALOT of the old school devs always leave after a couple months primarily due to that I assume so they probably gave him a promotion to encourage him to stay. He is a good dev though
---
Honestly, this shouldn't even be a question. The fact that Jagex thinks that not being able to play the game for a few days is more of a nuisance than losing thousands of hours of progress is laughable. Jagex's stance on account security is a fucking anymore and it's honestly really sad.

The polling system isn't working when major updates for the game are polled and they doesn't pass on 74.9%. The game is beginning to die because it stays the exact same for too long. Hopefully they add warding as an integrity update to save the community.

Holy shit, corrupt dragon was f2p??

You will have a higher chance of seeing a drop depending on your points compared to others will determine how likely it will be in your name. Its roughly 1/720k points for item with the chance at an item capping at somewhere between 560-580k (dont remember exact numbers but wiki has them) each roll at a unique takes 7-8k points and it rolls all the person with highest points rolls first then down in order to lowest points.
---
Youre like the new serene arent you

Is she leaving? Or whats her position now?

There was an update that remembers attack styles for individual weapons

I guess you don't come around this sub often then

Damn dude... you‚Äôre bound to recover on drop rate sometime soon

Well excluding mage and cannon

I changed the code of the plugin directly to display the mining site icon from the world map. If you want I could upload the jar for you (I dont think there is any reason Im not allowed to upload mine, and it should still update as runelite/scape updates)

Yeah we're going to bang out the early levels together üòÅ

One thing I want to mention: why are so many of the agility shortcuts such low chance? Like I'm 30+ levels over it and I still fail it and take damage 50% of the time. C'mon now.

Google raids drop calculator osrs, ge tracker has one with good UI. Punch in your numbers and it'll tell you chances of drop and in your name

It fits in with all the other skills because it is a mindless grind fest. That's acceptable for the skills that have been here from the start, but for a new skill I would like to see something a little more engaging. I want to see something implemented that is 100% fun :-)

It's possible that it's not reliable and I just have godlike rng luck. But I've been doing it that past few days in draynor and made at least 2m in around 2-3 hours of pickpocketing.

---
Sounds boring. Every team dies out without fresh blood. 
---
I agree
---
Do I wish I would've had to cut less teaks in the first place? i mean, if it was 100k instead of 150k from the beginning, nobody would care because that's how it's always been. If you wanna put in new methods for woodcutting that dont give drops, or any of these perks, sure, but taking the same exact activity and making it much easier/faster is just bad. I go for 99's because there's something significant about it. If you make everything easier repeatedly, the max cape just turns into a glorified cooking cape. Im trying to get 90 rc right now, and im dying, so when I see an rc cape, im like, damn. If they made something where there was really good incentives all of a sudden to do the SAME runecrafting, i'd think the cape is less cool because I know NOW how annoying it is to get.
---
Oh sorry, I didn't really explain it too clearly
---
That was sort of the whole point. In p2p you just use dragon.

You coulda antilured with telegram or an alt and got a free 65.5k

Er, are you teaming with randoms? The 3 PEOPLE I'd be teaming with are IRL friends, 2 of which have played RS with me for like 10 years.

I dont think group ironman concept was really dreamed up for randoms.

Crazy, played 2004-2009ish and never saw it once.
---
There's a guy who sits outside the TD by my house with a sign that basically says they're awful. He's been there every weekend for months now. I've never dealt with them so idk.
---
Yo im doin the grind as well rsn is: A udioslave. Add me and let me know what yours is (private is on friends all the time)
---
I think its more likely something that its part of some future content (like a new quest) and it accidentally got pushed to production early. Can definitely see something like that happened especially after the TBow static spawn.
---
The margins on beads used to actually be great a couple years ago, you could sit on a 30-50% margin and hit trade limits. For a 2-6k item, it was really good. These days there's basically always stock and no margin so this will basically never go through just from experience. 
---
NMZ is good for the game. I only started playing again because I was able to get my melee stats up to 94 while also having a fulltime job and a family to care for. So now I can log on freely and go to Bandos with my friends in my limited free time. It is such a big help for people like me who can't play all day..
---
Will having a higher mage level take less damage from Vorkath‚Äôs mage attack??

Which method is giving you 1,5m/h?
---
Honestly expected this to be another crab meme
---
Try world 365. Some people scale raids too so you could get seconds for potions to help them out while they do raids. I'd be down to bring you along in a scaled raid if you'd do that. No need to do any rooms. Just kill scavengers and collect potion secondaries for us.

You probably went the wrong path , there is always a web you can go through however you cannot go though every web. Each players path is different.

Wouldn't surprise me at all if it turned out he just decided to quit.
---
The one chunk man idea is a cool one, but there were major problems with the rules and the whole thing just couldn't really work. Even within those 2(?) episodes he made, he changed his mind about the rules multiple times, and kept finding new things that required massive alteration of the rules, and going back to redo the previous chunk.
---
People loved the idea, including me, but in the end it just didn't work out.

If you're doing barrows before Trident on an iron, you're doing it wrong IMO
---
If you have 20k points in solo, you have a 2.8% chance of getting a purple, and a 100% chance of it being in your name. If you have 20k points in a 5 man ffa with 100k points, you have a 14(ish)% chance at getting a purple and a 20% chance of it being in your name. Which I think is something like 2.8%.
---
If it‚Äôs still not fixed I can fix it now, when exactly dose it go out ?

Actually if someone would just make a plug-in for RuneScape's own music player, he'd be my fucking hero. I like to play with osrs music on sometimes... However whenever you teleport to another area it resets the position of player scrolling to the top, and there's no search option for the songs.

So I didnt know osrs still counted the days when the original account was created. I literally just checked with Hans and he said 6,227 days. I think we should be friends

Yeah, you can have down to -64 magic attack bonus (-65 is garunteed splashing) and have pretty damn good accuracy against the melee brothers. I think someone did the math and -30 and +30 is like a 5% difference or something like that.

Because the farming guild is overpowered garbage meant to dumb down the skill
---
What was your equipment setup? Obby gear?
---
Correct. 
---
The next best thing is a Rune Square Shield... from Bryophyta. Thankfully, instead of that, you can just get the next best thing to the next best thing (an Adamant Kiteshield)... from Bryophyta. 
---
If you‚Äôre not smithing or bossing, your best shield is a Mithril Kiteshield. 
---
Damn this nigga went and alched his last brain cell.

I don‚Äôt wanna wanna waste time on my current iron if ima haveto grind a whole other one

Your internet connection is faulty.

I feel personally attacked üòÇ
---
I had a Dell Latitude Windows tablet; the stylus in Windows wouldn't work for camera movement (it didn't bind the middle mouse wheel button to any buttons).
---
Under Linux though, I believe the middle button of the stylus worked out-the-box for middle mouse button, and worked fine with OSRS. Testing this would involve booting a Linux LiveUSB, installing Java, getting a jar for whatever OSRS client you want, and running it.
---
Okay, I wasn't sure if warding had already been polled.
---
warding seems like a long term, beneficial and profitable skill. I also think it would add a lot to the Ironman game. What is the dissenting opinion for warding? Is it the same as it was for artisan?
---
Are you really playing Runescape if someone DOESN'T tell you to hang yourself, and then blasts with the n-word pass he's misusing?
---
Quite a few do. For better or for worse.
---
There‚Äôs programming for bots to do zulrah? Wtf
---
I'm not great with AHK but I believe the rules state that 1:1 hotkey moves are ok, anything else is rule breaking
---
Pre 75 I got around 51-52k/hr.  Can‚Äôt remember my rates with giant pouch but I think it was around 64k.
---
Oh you‚Äôre right. I just assume everything is a skull trick if I‚Äôm on a slayer task
---
XP waste otherwise 
---
That‚Äôs why i got myself a quest cape! Same stats and status as one, had it ever since 2008!
---
500 pts boissss
---
Nah man he merched
---
The "xp more valuable than the item being produced" meta that max cape, 99 cape perks and post max xp players produced really fucked skilling. Artisan (based on what others have explained to me what it is as a skill) is just another reason why production skills would continue to go down the drain.
---
Johnny Rebel on repeat
---
This is so cute
---
&gt;I'm about to hit base 75 cb stats so I want to start focusing on strength. I have an abyssal dagger. Is it good for str training or should I sell it and use another weapon?
---
Abyssal Bludgeon if you can afford that, but the dagger is fine. 
---
I laughed way to hard at this. Now all my co workers are staring at me 
---
maybe lay off the acid
---
My man, just the kind of words my mid level account needs to hear
---
Thats why I‚Äôm saying it should be a one time toggle, or else the hacker would just toggle the delay off, resulting in authenticator delay being useless?Also recoveries shouldn‚Äôt turn off authenticator either imo which I believe it does now(not fully sure)
---
Obviously new to wildy. Which is why he got skull tricked.
---
@OP: NEVER fight back when you're doing pvm. You had the right idea to set it to hidden. Also turn auto-retaliate off because you can be skull glitched with it. If you're in PVM gear, you won't be beating someone in PKer gear unless you're 50 levels higher than them.
---
What they did to you is a VERY common method of tricking someone into skulling. Think about it; why would they want you to fight back? They knew you would pose no risk. It's no coincidence that there were two PKers with similar names, they set it up so you'd attack the wrong PKer and lose all your gear.
---
I guess they felt bad about taking your mask afterwards. But don't be fooled, they were NOT doing you a favor by asking you to fight back, and while it's your own fault you got skulled, it's still a scummy thing to do.
---
99 hunt almost 100 no pet. You are blessed couldve won the lottery
---
How many tabs did you do?
---
This is honestly what makes this series so much more interesting than other restricted ironmen, in my opinion. There's something to be said for just barring off content and trying to level regardless, but Settled has included so much research and really has expanded a lot of general game knowledge. It's like watching a RuneScape scientist at work. That's one of the reasons why I think his content is so appealing to a wider audience, he digs deep into the very core of RuneScape. 
---
Saying friendo just makes you sound like a weirdo like Anton bro. Also I caught the smell of condescension a mile away
---
I‚Äôm pretty close (thanks slayermusiq) but in rs3 I was that 120 combat guy with a combat bracelet lol
---
If you have 43 prayer it's a cakewalk. A long one though
---
If it‚Äôs not insta denied that‚Äôs good. The insta Deny usually occurs if you‚Äôre trying to recover an acc that doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
Use the login email and not the username if you weren‚Äôt already 
---
Yeah man, zulrah only has a limited number of rotations so with the know how it's not that complex. Most of the ones I've seen have 1 range so they can skip the blue phase and effectively only take damage from snakelings 
---
The pvm/skilling communities are not without their own issues (crashing, elitism, circle-jerking, etc.) but when people ask "why is the wilderness so empty?", this is why. I go to revs a lot and people call me N*gger, downy, bitch, etc.
---
I think a lot of these people were bullied IRL, either by peers or their parents, so they turn to joining a pvp clan where they can feel like the ones in power. That is why they always feel the need to rub it in when they pk someone for their 10k worth of stuff. It's not about the loot, its about the power, the ego boost.
---
Do you have 43 prayer? If so it's not bad, if you don't have 43 prayer, you can still do it, just use all free inventory spaces for sharks and super energy potions.
---
Use a blowpipe instead of dcb. 
---
Amazing job. So motivating where did you drop?
---
your security is compromised in other aspects. haveibeenpwned.com
---
yeh man taking away from the fun of runecrafting 10 hours straight
---
There was a guy asking about slayer locations on here the other day as a no wiki account
---
Thank god its not just me
---
I skip all trees and fruit trees. I have an oak and curry tree pre planted incase I get them from getting easier contracts though 
---
Pull up in the coup with de bois
---
When your internet switches............... 
---
Combat spells train hitpoints.
---
Yeah, with the hard diary complete you can toggle the Watchtower Teleport spell from the normal spell book to put you directly in the middle of Yanille.
---
Similar to the Varrock Diary letting you change Varrock teleport to GE
---
I recall seeing an account named "numb digger" circa 2005 did they get worse as the game got older?
---
Use only a rune scimitar, dragonhide chaps and body, combat bracelet, amulet of glory
---
If you die you'll only lose what's in your inventory and the dragonhide body and chaps. 
---
i'm not sure what's worse, the fact that this dude decided to report panda or that he actually got muted for it
---
Fisting? Is your partner single?
---
I have 57 farming and 50 hunter (from birdhouse runs) . I also have both of those quests done as well as varrock easy done. I use to do these a lot but now I only play 2 to 3 days a week maybe about 6 hours a week tops
---
Highkey jealous I'm kinda half playing atm due to burnout. Goals left are elite diaries and 99s and most of those seem more annoying than enjoyable to grind out. Good luck
---
That‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
I have literally no reason to lie lmao it's just my experience over the last 3-4 days doing it. Think what you want but I must have some godlike rng in this game.
---
Marry her
---
the account was created on a dummy email that doesn't exist and I forgot to register a real email on it, otherwise it would've been a lot easier to recover right now.
---
This is why i like demonics. U can go 1 task with only 1 zenyte and make double that. 
---
why aren't the results hidden?
---
I thought I was having a rough go. 1600 dry. F

You can at least poison daggers in most cases

So enlightenment is the final realisation you're an extention to nothingness? You dont have to survive, nothing really matters, everything is an illusion.

Oof didn‚Äôt censor your run energy.

I recognized you as soon as I clicked the video haha, well done again. Great videos.
---
why would you do agility in the wilderness lmao
---
They're already coming! This is a reward suggestion as they've been asking for more. :)
---
I started really playing when mobile came out... so far still playing despite a few hiccups. Just have to find the right motivations. Good luck! 
---
Very interesting. I'll have to follow this on my set up. One question though, do you pay to protect the hops?
---
Lynx is a normie but he will forever be the old school goat. 
---
Prefaced with "Opinion" and you still complaining? Get outta here.
---
&gt; you're not giving criticism
---
You mean "you're not giving constructive criticism", and you're right. That's why I said opinion. He can ignore it if he wants, he's a big boy, unlike you.
---
What? Just change it to strength and it will remember your option when you next equip it

It is a realization.  Almost like you are 'remembering' your higher consciousness.  Yes, everything is in a sense an illusion.  I do not know if enlightenment is a means to an end of incarnation or not.  I guess I will find out when I die.  I believe that living a moral, positive, loving life will help the collective consciousness.  That is my mission in life.  To love everyone regardless of how they think of me and what they know.  To observe as if duality isn't a construct, loving others will help you love yourself.
---
It's nutella, I don't think chocolate icing is a popular breakfast condiment.
---
tired of rot bolting my ass when i try and farm 2.2k rev
---
You‚Äôre mad you looked? No one forced you to look buddy spoilers are a given 
---
Enlightenment is an experience that shows you the truth.  It is a limited knowingness in an unlimited loop.
---
The druids in the edgeville dungeon drops lots of herbs. But its in very low level wildy, so always be prepared to tele out/run. Make sure to hide player attack option in settings.
---
people deliberately create like 4-8 low lvl accounts, give them bonds to make members and then put them in bounty hunter worlds east varrock ditch against eachother to fight, thus easily upgrading their emblems to higher tiers and making several mils/hr from later selling the emblems for rune items in the bounty hunter shop. 
---
jmods have been manually banning the accounts but it still keeps happening due to profitability, which is bad for the game if they are botting gold several mils/hr with near no reqs.
---
meh i prefer fangblade
---
30% sounds pretty high tbh
---
Someone give this man the G(old) cuz he missed out on the Karma but deserves the love
---
These don't take long. You can go on your phone for like 5-10 and do them once or twice a day. 
---
whats the goal?
---
My range lvl isn‚Äôt high enough for blowpipe right now. I plan on entering at 70 range. So until I hit 75 range for blowpipe... what bolts should I use? Any specific enchantment that is beneficial?
---
D
---
Good call, I'm not a Nutella man so it never crossed my mind. Just looked like eggs n icing. My first thought, the breakfast of weed blazing champions lol
---
As a main id be down for warding. As someone with over 2200 total, the thought of having a level 1 skill (new skill not just redoing something ive already maxed on a new acc) and having one thing to put all my resources/perks/capabilities towards sounds really fun.
---
Finishing up western hard reqs hopefully. Gonna do my bandos slayer task &amp; hope to get lucky.
---
I always thought the customer service was a meme on this subreddit. I am honestly REALLY upset with Jagex for this one.
---
My younger brother got an email today saying his email preferences were changed, and he had to click a link to confirm it. Well being the naive 11 year old he is, he clicked it.
---
Now mind you, there was no logging in, no entering of password or PIN - none of that - but when he clicked this link, it sent him a confirmation that his new email was xyz@protonmail and all new communications would be sent there.
---
So my mum texts me explaining my brother is crying because his account got stolen, and I think oh yeah of course I can help you, I was there when we registered the account and we can just google "Runescape customer service" and get it resolved.
---
WELL HAVE FUN NAVIGATING THAT. It is now 1:30AM and I have been down every rabbit hole and clicked every link that sends you back to the SAME USELESS PAGE where it asks what you need support with. Type in "my account was hijacked"? Sure, let me give you 12 articles on how to secure your account and how you can't appeal a macro ban. Want to submit a ticket? Sure, we'll reply to your email - the one that is xyz@protonmail.
---
I am honestly flabbergasted and have no idea what to do. Reset the password? Sure! Let's confirm that at xyz@protonmail. We actually have no access to his account anymore, which is honestly tragic since he was genuinely enjoying that game over the past couple years.
---
I really want to add more explicits towards Jagex right now, I'm frustrated beyond help. This game is only as good as the people who can play it, and if you want the newcomers to stay you can't expect the youngest of them to not click so much as a link in their inbox. 
---
Do you have any reason to use a camulet? I‚Äôve legit never used mine since I got it like 2 years ago lol
---
More effort than mindlessly clicking one guy over and over for sure
---
They appear in certain time windows, and they‚Äôre all for different accounts. So yeah 
---
That‚Äôs an interesting response from a RPG player... mostly correct though!
---
 I mean If you‚Äôre somewhat competent fighting back actually does help you escape and only being able to kill someone 50 levels lower in pvm gear lol what.
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
He didnt discover it. Some runescapers speedrunners found it and told him about it so he exploited it.

I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs f2p so that won‚Äôt help much

thanks for the list. will def start doing this after 99 rc tomorrow.

This has been known about for several years.
---
Oh ok
---
Chin hunting is one of the best skilling activities in the game
---
Assuming you're not an iron, just buy Ultracompost.
---
Really? How do you buy the bond then? 
---
What's the name of that game?  /s

Yo I need to leech a raid for diary as well so I‚Äôd take you up on that if you‚Äôre willing lol

That's garbage forever

It's pretty impressive the status he's gained for himself at such a young age.

One thing is certain you just wasted a lot of rng. You should have been at raids or Corp.
---
I think you actually deserved this one lol

They aren't kids.

Sell whip, by proselyte, trident of the seas and if possible occult necklace. Then camp barrows.

You have to empty the box, remove it, then build a new one

Is that why Im starting to get burnt out?

Can someone please explain this staking thing to me? I see alot of talk about it and people gambling their money but sometimes getting rich (like op screenshhot).
---
Ive been doing alot of grinding and quests to unlock access to more things but I've been really curious about a way to risk it for the biscuit and get millions of gp
---
Lol, totally understandable. Try nutella with icecream my dude, you'll never want another topping for icecream in your life I swear.
---
I will tongue punch you in perfect unison to the tune
---
I'm game, challenge accepted lol
---
How dumb do you have to be to get mad about this?
---
Time to bring the darts
---
here i was feeling blessed getting one a task for my first three task. might as well block them cause your whip life is all used up.
---
Can't tell if you're trolling m8
---
Haha lol
---
So funny.....
---
Was just making it clear I play 
---
With people who have a mic
---
String a glory if he gets rare drop table or random event dragonstone.
---
Perhaps you should take an English class, both proven and proved can be used here and both would be correct.
---
It's funny I grinded for it too but then Drakan's medallion also gave unlimited teles almost as close in the neck slot so I mostly use that now since I'd rather keep construction cape on.
---
Crystal armour new BIS tank? Or simply devaluing justicar 
---
Nice desktop background bro
---
This is a mute from 2006 BTW
---

---
I believe I qualify for the Veteran's discount now.
---
A lot of people play this game for fun with friends
---
So uhh.. whats your opinion on fletching? You just cut logs, string bows, or make ammo. Literally the same shit all the way to 99.
---
yes that was a durag run. oh and im not that good i don't plan on getting inferno cape
---
If you can't use a blowpipe, [Diamond Bolts (e)](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Diamond_bolts_(e) are probably your best bet. If you want to fork out a little extra for the Diamond Dragon Bolts (e) you could do that too, but the extra money and/or inventory slot really isn't worth it here.
---
Yup he knew it was coming and is getting his stats up
---
Runescape is almost like a ponzi scheme :O
---
This is more of a joke, I agree that spending hours doing mundane grinding is not worth it, but you literally pay for my membership and I thank you for that. 
---
Since I have already invested a lot of time playing for 5  year and can easily make 3m gp/hr I can buy a bond lasting me 14 days for 1 hour of what I already enjoy doing. While the new players at the bottom of the food chain only making 100k gp/hr pays for my membership.
---
Alch yourself with 10 fires and 2 nats
---
Hasta/Lance has 2 stab options, defence or shared. Im 96 attack, 99 strenght, 95 defence, 99 magic, 99 slayer.
---
Should I use it on defence or shared? 
---
I do a lot of barraging slayer tasks on defensive mode, so I might get 99 defence from just long ranging mage, which is why I feel like it would be better if I got some attack xp, but at the same time I also feel like getting 1/3 of the xp in strength is a bit of a waste.
---
These people man
---
Would date
---
In those 7 hours you could have alched to 60 lol
---
 Could the guy in void be an ultimate? That would be pretty reasonable gear for one, yeah? 
---
Learning how to raid during a raid is going to require a mentor to condense the lesson. If you want a full lesson watch guides on youtube or read the guides provided in the we do raids discord. sorry man
---
Its rare to complete a lap and not get the pet
---
That's why I can't even get into the game!
---
Man every time i look at the construction skill i see a fist coming through the wood.
---
Is this an award? I don't know what that is and everyone is all congratulatory
---
Don't be sorry man, you taught great. I was under prepared and didn't know the mechanics as well as I should have. I'm just happy to have experience and will come in next time with more knowledge of the bosses and Olm phases.
---
Still missing rainbow set

Ya like mobile to WiFi.... Happens a lot

I got 60-67 from 50-99 and several games I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to do the jumps

---
Do zulrah with void bp and trident looks like your best chances unless you can easily kill Vork do him instead and work towards a bis gearing guide for range,melee,mage 
---
How do you have so much bank space
---
This goes against the circle jerks narrative tho
---
why every comment gotta be fuckin weird as hell on this sub 
---
settled keep doin you man keep grindin
---
Why does everyone have their minds already made up about warding when we really know nothing about it?
---
There's *always* some risk when using 3rd party software, although with runelite it is a small one
---
The only thing I can think of for you to further increase security is to contact jagex and make it so your account can't be recovered at all. 
---
I can only imagine the stench
---
Nope, looks fine to me
---
Same, I refuse to play mobile when prompted to type in my info lol
---
True, but as Erik himself said, "commentiquette" would have been right there... ;)
---
Just give me your username and password and I‚Äôll check to make sure your account is safe.
---
Shit
---
Growing up to be a weak individual enthralled by the wasteful, addictive vice of gambling? Pass.

Pro-tip: you always lose.

Jesus christ i was looking into college in 2009...
---
Yes, but you can store elite void in your POH, and it‚Äôs some of the better defensive storable melee gear, isn‚Äôt it? 
---
Pls yes my fashionscape needs this
---
Yet spamming doubling money and scamming people isn't mute able. 
---
Still get decent defence for all styles without set effect, point would still be valid
---
This is so funny and cute. Kinda upset you got muted though

Too much text, didn‚Äôt read but congrats dude

&gt;If you want other farming money tips, I keep palm trees in all tree plots which i can quickly run for free money
---
Can confirm, it's so dumb. 10k for checking a tree every 3 hours. With spirit trees in the Farming Guild and Brimhaven you can check three slots (plus the one in the Gnome Stronghold) in probably one minute.
---
It‚Äôs a frog
---
Op was cheating lol 
---
He actually kinda looks like the pepe he uses as a profile pic.
---
Grind on me
---
I guess I just don't get the problem. You already know that if you don't like it you can stop watching. I assume you subbed, maybe even donated to him, gave a criticism or maybe just couldn't tolerate someone being aggressive and putting on a show, but then you got banned. And now it's THE WORST THING EVER.
---
How do you get the loot and kill tracker? Is it a runelite plugin or something in game that I don‚Äôt know of 
---
wig jagged fox 
---
How do you get those messages back? 
---
Ohhh, didn't know that. I'll still protect the trees tho, magic saplings are too expensive to let it die
---
Log into the websight and go to account then to account status and itll show past mutes and bans
---
Lololol don‚Äôt lie bro 
---
To be fair you're asking a pretty dumb question if you think a computer can't tell the difference between something set of to reoccur  every 1 second versus a guy clicking sporadically with the mouse moving slightly.
---
Gratz dude, what ur in game name? I‚Äôll add ya, recently got my fire cape as well but took me about 7-8 tries
---
Ah, I thought you could see all Ur messages 
---
Why make the game work around a build which u decided to restrict yourself ? If u want a pure have to deal with the pure build of not being able to do everything a main does? Sorry but no support for this 
---
There isn't much about Forinthry itself, only about the battles fought there and Zamorak nuking it with the Stone of Jas. We don't even know what the Zarosian settlements there were like. 
---
Q
---
I got 2 tomes of fire in 14kc on my uim before the collection log was introduced :)
---
That did happen to me a couple months ago, I suggested he take a break from staking after losing a lot and host one of his tribe events. He told me to fuck off an do my own stream then said something along the lines of nobody will watch it or whatever. The problem I'm addressing is that he treats his supporters like garbage on a daily, even hourly basis. People who give him money who he actually displays no respect for. It's not even him putting on a show, it's his actual personality. 
---
Its 50/50, you get it or you dont
---
To everyone who says im cheating, I very well understand the rules, Im not illiterate the rules do not allow for any unfair advantage because thats the point of the game. Its very clearly written that doing anything to try to go around these rules will get you perma banned. My previous account is nearly 7 years old and has never had so much as a mute on it. I have previously used this email for stuff with jagex and ive never had any problems back then. Like ive said, i just wanted to play some OSRS and experience some sweet nostalgia.
---
No the guy I reported was a bit spamming some phishing YouTube channel
---
Nah just abit of your 'offense'
---
I believe :)
---
Thanks!

Chafednips28

I‚Äôm happy to add, I mostly play on mobile and don‚Äôt always see my chats so don‚Äôt be offended if I don‚Äôt respond or go offline after you chat me

Maybe he finds it easier to let go of fustration. Like normal ppl do
---
Yeah but how is that an argument against? It's not like making the reward optional would impact mains in any way, it would just make the pure gameplay more enjoyable. There are many updates which make the ironman gameplay more enjoyable - even though they chose the ironman mode.
---
Someone's been listening a bit too much to Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan it seems
---
I use a laptop with no mouse and use the click option so if I wanted I wouldn't need to move the mouse at all but click? So I can easily remove the 'mouse moving' part of it
---
The Edicts of Guthix weren't an actual barrier just a declaration. If the gods broke it then the Guardians of Guthix would have woken Guthix up. 
---
Zaros is silent because he was heavily injured by Zamorak before the 3rd age God Wars. Seren shattered herself to stay on Gielinor with the Elves whilst still following Guthix's wishes.

Blue shirt boy is bound to do well in the future

&gt;I gave you money, respect me, obey me

He's a professional streamer. I wouldn't want backseat streamer/gamers either. You sound really entitled.
---
not long ago someone came to the GE with the red skull and everyone was freaking out because they had no idea what it was lol
---
Then choose to restrict yourself from this sub aswell. Peace. 
---
did y'all go to the bathroom and show each other your d longs?

I‚Äôve got the password remembered on my phone. All I have to do to sign into my account is scan my thumbprint...

This is the best idea I've ever heard

thanks Bertil

Wooosh
---
now do it on a uim
---
I disagree with the guy above about prayer. If you don't mind tanking you can do a run with half a prayer pot at those levels. I don't prayer for torag, guthan and verac
---
Haha theeeeeeere it is let's go boys
---
I can't believe I was examining your UI looking for something I missed.
---
Then I saw the bird and raised my eyebrows in disappointment of myself.
---
Don't forget fire cape.
---
You are not incorrect.
---
Now my bodypillow can have something on the other side besides his in-game character
---
ge-tracker
---
actually i think they did a while ago, i remember them talking about releasing something like that on vinyl
---
[Help]
---
Going for void might be worth it honestly, I didn't follow updates for the past 1-2 years but I thought it got nerfed no?
---
Saying something factually objective makes me an asshole? Sure.
---
People (especially on reddit) love spouting non-factual nonsense. Comments that are outright wrong should be deleted in favor of correct comment.
---
The person upvoted above me said: "**This predates Swampletics,**"
---
This is 100% wrong.
---
What the actual fuck? lol
---
Lsd apparently
---
Can I add multiple items to the price check
---
They did at Runefest
---
I don't think so.
---
I suppose the argument against is that it could set a precedent, I know you've said that you wouldn't want any changes that affect balancing but you know if they made this change the pressure would be on from others. Skillers would want the priest in peril quest to not give prayer to access morytania etc etc I'm not against it per se but that I would say it was a reasonable counter argument
---
Serene doesnt care about the game. Hes a meta-troller operating cross platform. Im radically different to him and I only talk about the game. Serene loves talking very little about the game. 
---
And then have woox raise it
---
I‚Äôm a pretty low combat level. What would you recommend having before fighting the boss? 
---
It motivated me to do barrow runs and he has worse equipment. 
---
Nice one, I'll make the upgrade 
---
I'll have to set a reminder, never actually done barb assault so this will be a great help :)
---
I mean like a tour. In different cities. The famous concert halls. 
---
I think everyone would have their own bank and you can just trade within your group.
---
Nah he's kind of right. He can act like a cunt as much as he wants and since he rejects criticism, without any kind of backlash he can just keep doing it and thrive repeating his method of entertainment for his viewers 
---
As cool as it is.  Can J get an F in chat for the bank space
---
Not sure about that aswell, didnt follow the updates either :p... but honestly dont go for a 60 def build... if you really want high defence just get a 70 def pure, but i honestly suggest first getting a zerker build and see how you like that before you continue on to higher def... theres no turning back from doing something stupid with your account ;p
---
Anything to let them feel superior i guess
---
Hummmmmmmmmmmmm ü§®
---
based
---
Yes
---
Ok I don't actually play osrs but visit this subreddit a lot - arma set is nearly 100m?!?!
---
Make a strawpoll site poll. I dont use twitter or have a twitter acct so i cant vote on that poll.... twuter is dumb af anyways 
---
Holy smokes, it's huge-ego Tony

Fuck the game dies with us üò¢

Can confirm, am wife
---
Hard -&gt; medium -&gt; easy

yeah I've noticed all the bullshit you've spewn over the last few years

They might as well have runecrafting and agility capes

Sh‚Äôlongs ya mean

The holy trinity and god thing, it was the meme potential lost. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm down my whole bank right now.... ughh why do I do this to my self

Idk how people can support Jagex when they let RWTers like him continue to make money streaming the game in the first place

maybe you should activate windows

Soarc mac has always been the scum of the RS community. Real world trades. Once sold his bank for a mustang then made a video saying he got cleaned.

Chatosrs is the number one runescape cc. Tell them Dro sent you, we‚Äôll take care of you
---
If you level strength using defensive, you'll hit 99hp with 1 strength.
---
If you level strength using controlled, you'll get 99 atk, def, str and hp at the same time.
---
So I think he meant something like "if you never get hp exp from other skills besides pure strength, you'll get X hp".
---
Some actions give decimals in xp (eg 25.5xp) but the xp that you‚Äôre shown is rounded. So sometimes you pass over a decimal break so the tracker shows a bigger jump.
---
You had 0 xp. 25.5xp drop so it shows you 26 (rounded up). Another 25.5xp drop, 25.5+25.5 is 51, you‚Äôre on 26 so it shows you 25. Or something similar like that. Might be the other way round but you get the general idea. 
---
Good idea but I just don't think it's feasible unless rs is your job or you're in like highschool or something 
---
Normal iron is fine as you can hop on an hour a day or so not having to rely on anyone or have anyone rely on you 
---
I don't see it being that popular just because the average age of osrs players is Second year uni/working age 
---
Doing anything other than playing 7 rune dragon alts for monet is a waste REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Keep in it
---
It's just medium clue lol, what u think that every medium clue got millions worth of rewards ? Lmao
---
Ahhh yeah. I only remembered the useful ones lol. There were also the p2p corrupt weapons like vesta and statius, which didn‚Äôt have specs.
---
Those were honestly the most fun pvp times, to me, because pking was sooo profitable.
---
Chaos druids can be killed in Taverly Dungeon. It's outside of the wilderness, really close to Falador (with 10 agi) and you don't need any quest or special items to get to the Chaos Druids.
---
26m isn‚Äôt an insane amount. The guy also has approx. 500 vork kills (10 heads at 1/50 drop rate) with a little over 100k profit/trip. So he‚Äôs probably made 60m off Vork alone. Not counting anything else. So 26m on graceful is probably pretty insubstantial 
---
Only issue with an item to take you out of the old wilderness and send you to the real one is that traversing the wilderness would literally be 0 risk 
---
1,5 hours? Wow dude
---
I always wanted the ability to alch items that were on the ground if you were standing on them, guess this is pretty similar. Whether or not it‚Äôd pass a poll tho
---
damn clue scroll always tryin to progress my account
---
Yeah zeah is a lot of content but I thought it would be the be a great uim series bc of the variety and gear upgrades from the slayer monsters under Kourend and eventually raids1. Idk I‚Äôm enjoying it so far 
---
Yes but if you click the trees long enough then fireworks go off around your character.
---
Burthorpe games room? It is pretty dead at the moment, not going to lie

Doesn't he though? (Not trying to be negative here)
---
what‚Äôs her username? think she scammed me just checking tho
---
26m is nothing bro lmao
---
lmao we (Sovereign) broke the poor guy months ago. He does his mass rev streams ("tribe" - LOL) and we just bang him out on login or bait them in a barrage clump. Made him end his stream many times last year. Very easy.
---
Is it really hard to believe? These things shit a lot dude
---
Thanks for the reply‚Äôs i was just staring at it for ages wondering why it was like that but now I know :) 
---
Dude's always been a spastic.. 
---
Forsure, you‚Äôre probably right about the power trip losers feel via pking. But at the same time, most people are regular human beings that just so happen to enjoy that style of play.
---
You really have to be retarded to color items in your inventory though.
---
Fuck, one Saturday bossing down the drain
---
On mobile, hungover in bed. Yep.
---
Imagine paying money for a client to play a game that you have to pay money to play.
---
That's literally what happened to me. I started played probably two weeks ago. I get off the island, and no less than 3 hours later me and a buddy run into what we could only assume was a multiboxer running around following each other for hours lmao. Didn't surprise me since people in wow do that all the time. 
---
After watching odablock on livestream now for a couple of weeks(I know he‚Äôs been around but I‚Äôve always liked to watch sparc over everywhere) oda is so in tune with his viewers always talks to the chat always reads the chat sparc mac is a legit piece of shit compared to what he used to be.. before he made that video on YouTube when he won his first like 20b he was so different now he‚Äôs just some cocky fuck that does nothing but talk shit to the people who basically bought him that gtr. There‚Äôs gunna be ppl that ride his dick bc they won a fury giveaway or some shitbut bottom line is I will never watch another sparc mac stream in my life that dude has become a grade a scumbag 
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm 100 barrows runs 100% completely dry and haven‚Äôt received one high tier loot ever from any boss. Makes the game feel pointless for those with no luck. Like what do I work for? I get literally nothing from every creature after years of playing. So tbh out of spite alone I‚Äôm gonna throw a downvote at you even though it won‚Äôt matter much seeing how the game loves you
---
This meme is literally as old as the internet how do you not know it
---
When you implement a software update you update the stuff you're specifically working on with the master code in case there were other changes, then put your changes into master. I'm insinuating the update after the birdhouse fix, they didn't do that so pushed their un-fixed birdhouse stuff into master
---
Unaware that avas device doesn't work with platebodies. Also unaware that equipping a defender does nothing for ranged.

You dommed
---
Just never turn your wifi on
---
No I not. 
---
well not just solely on banning people, even though thats one of the reasons. the behavior in general. the way he responds. and yes, these are my reflections and what I think about the situation. I am reviewing that and forming an opinion about it as to why i think is inappropriate, which is in fact, criticism. 
---
During that divine promotion stream a couple (not many) people in chat were saying they voted against divine in the poll. Sparc basically flipped, turned his stream black for like 3 minutes. When it came back, Fortnite was on. He left 100+ people at his corp event without saying 1 word. Hundreds of people were either at the event or watching the stream and he just quit because a couple people didn't vote his way
---
Ardy Knight?
---
A lot of game design comes from players using it in an unintended way. Especially RuneScape, look how people manipulate the tick system for virtually anything yet Jagex has never stated it's bad.
---
Also he's not force spawning them, he's just aware of what it takes and the timer check.
---
I'm surprised he isnt banned for RWT yet
---
I don't think your definition of straight matches mine
---
Yeh, I personally wouldn't want to login with email ever, insecure and annoying
---
I was a 1 defence pure for about 2 years (maxed) then i turned to a zerker for around 4 months and still disliked the limitations in regards to bossing. I am now 87 defence and training through slayer with bossing and I enjoy it so much more. I make alot more money, use less supplies so in my opinion 60/70 defence would be a lot better than a zerker. However levelling in stages so becoming a zerker first could be nice to give an idea of whether you want to continue with 45 defence or increase.

You‚Äôre telling me you wouldn‚Äôt make that trade?

Use items on bankers I think

Nah I don‚Äôt think so, a large portion of raids are conducted through WDR1, especially learner raids, so long as you have atleast one 78 you‚Äôre good.

If you‚Äôre going for hardcore communities? Sure

This changes everything.
---
No, because f2p pking on my 10hp mage pure used to be fun. I had other accounts I used to go team pking with, but don't remember what they were.
---
This is literally a picture and not a live feed. Why are you assuming he's keeping them in his bank outside of this one picture?
---
TLDR: Op is upset he got called out by a streamer who he is subscribed to. OP feels like he has entitlement for giving a guy $5.

He also promoted bitconnect lmao

Ah, I do that indeed :p

Actually looks quite nice
---
Orthodox Christian house?
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve gained by posting this though?
---
The pleasure of speaking my mind, and the 1% chance that his videos will become more watchable.
---
What's killing this game are the farmers. Fred the Farmer is a complete fucking scumbag. His battery farming tactics are disgusting, and to make matters worse, his practices go unnoticed by everybody.
---
Fuck Fred the Farmer.
---
lmfao imagine rambling about fucking Sparc Mac? Who the fuck cares about him? 
---
Its a cult following. The viewers feed off the toxicity. They love the arrogance. As weird as it sounds, the viewers love Sparc the douchier he gets because they are the same way lol. 
---
I loved Sparc back in the day, I‚Äôm just not into the toxicity. 
---
was the prophet they're referring to be a quality person to hang around?
---
i‚Äôve jumped in his stream a bunch of times when i see giveaway in the title, but i never last more than 10 minutes before being like yeah this isn‚Äôt worth it
---
As badly as I wanted to see a scythe drop. That music was unbearable. I stopped watching after about 3 seconds.
---
How‚Äôd it go?
---
"irregardless"

Damn you could turn that rune bar into a rune dagger then use that rune dagger to slaughter thousands of goblins.
---
67 hp 70 prayer nice try
---
I actually really enjoy his videos, very well produced and entertaining, can‚Äôt fucking stand his livestreams though
---
If you actually read the post, it has nothing to do with 'manipulation' or 'abuse'. The title is complete click-bait.
---
1. This is just Sparc Mac either joking around or having an ego. 
---
2. Just seems like Sparc misunderstood the comment.
---
3. All he says is 'sparc does giveaways to get subs'. No fucking shit. But it's even better, Sparc doesn't even do sub giveaways anymore.
---
Absolutely none of which have anything to do with 'manipulation' of 'abuse' of his fans.
---
It's very clear OP is either way too emotionally invested, or is simply trying to damage Sparc Mac's brand for whatever reason. 
---
When I disabled my authenticator on my normie I got a confirmation e-mail. Check the link!
---
Anyone hear of cult mind control. Look up the BITE model. I watched Mac for Abit but he reminded me to much of the leadership in the cult I was raised in.
---
Totally agree, I used to watch all the time while I scape, but the ego thing is definitely not a "jealously based" assumption for anyone to make. 
---
Most of his chat seems like a bunch of boomers/kids with ego problems too honestly lol

Uhh, fighter torso and obby legs are BiS for non-prayer tasks anyway? With the farming guild shitting out prayer pots now too (contracts), overhead praying pretty much every task is actually sustainable and viable.

The only place you actually NEED barrows gear is probably the Kraken boss, which is funnily enough. 87 slayer.

If anything, slaying IN barrows gear makes you look like the champion.

I work in a hotel and when a guest mentioned going to the casino and we were talking about it I mentioned I'd never go in real life because I know I'm irresponsible with gambling because of videogames. We added each other.

They could explain stuff instead of "just engine", but not all people are devs so its just easier to say so.
---
Yo you might feel closer to the universe but i promise the universe doesnt feel closer to you just because you took a drug that lit up all your senses at once lol. Your ideas are way too based in human to reflect any kind of universal truth. Fuck your 'enlightened' elitism, its disgusting. Also heat death will certainly end our universe, its not even a question of classical vs new age physics, we all know that eventually energy will become too spread out to harness no matter how good our tech is. 
---
Just because somebody doesn't get sweaty playing multiple times a week doesn't mean they don't care. What a stupid comment.
---
While your worry for your friend's account is noble, as others said, this would resolve in like a day if he actually submitted a request.
---
Unfortunately, posting on reddit about it is only gonna bring in trolls and quite possibly, get your friends btw account banned for macroing because reddit is not a support site and jam flex will most likely misread this post.
---
Still need boost
---
I‚Äôd recommend at least base 40s in all F2P stats before going P2P.
---
Some quests may be easy but the requirements might set you back from actually starting. 
---
There‚Äôs a guide for efficient questing. I suggest you look that over, get an idea for what‚Äôs ahead. Another major thing is getting a head start on diaries. They reward you with good exp lamps early and unlock money makers that are profitable ‚Äúdailies‚Äù. As a new member they provide great passive cash flow to keep up a bond (if you‚Äôre not dropping cash)
---
Litterally outplayed
---
Thanks I needed to hear that
---
They're never going to lock an account because he has friend says so
---
@SettledRS has said he didn‚Äôt want to do one because he didn‚Äôt know what tiers to do. Imo, a dollar an episode is a good starting point and he can figure out the tiers later...
---
Bruh this account took you a day to make. Not saying it doesn't suck, especially if you used a bond, but just have the account make cannonballs to try and earn it back and in the meantime re-roll. 
---
But seriously 20 hours in OSRS is nothing.

I can't believe she got the name for the tree chopping skill right!

Damn, thanks. I need to catch 1 shark and everytime I boost I dont get lucky lol

If eoc was released as an optional game mode, nobody would be mad about it. This is a silly comment.

Someone should make a RuneLite plugin for this

They're probably just having fun and using equipment that they think looks coolest not the best. The boots match the crossbow and the shield and that's probably what they were going for. Let people play how they like

200m all ironman and im impressed, but yea, 200m in all is  abig feat.

Who upvotes this shit?
---
Don‚Äôt like to admit it, but same..
---
I think it‚Äôs skybox is what you‚Äôre looking for my guy.
---
Not even close though. There's more than enough space for your brain to process it's top to bottom and not left to right.
---
not your loot "BTW"
---
Omg thank you so much!
---
I will be voting no (at least the first time) to group ironman, simply because imo there is a lot of other engine work which should be higher priority than a questionable new game mode. 
---
The fog is whatever colour the skybox is
---
Depends on the state in the US, age of consent in my state is 16 and there are states where you have like 11 year olds marrying 40 year olds
---
To be fair I found the game on miniclip and I have played for 16.5 years lol, only a few months less than this guy. 
---
Yes! I love Maiden. Seen them twice! You‚Äôre my fav mod now.
---
Just curious in what aspect would you abuse this? In pking? I was just thinking of this as a way to avoid HC deaths and losing items in instances as a ring of life doesn't always save you. I mean if you were attacked by another player this wouldn't take affect.
---
TLDR
---
Voting yes the 2nd time would still require as much engine work as it would the first time, and it likely would be the same rewrite required for true clan systems, if that fancies you.
---
He has just under 700. What do you mean? I have just over 600. You get more space by not keeping junk. 
---
From what I know, runners make about 3.5-4m an hour
---
Sorry for not clarifying it properly. Good thing JoranMZ could do it for me instead.
---
&gt; Also recoveries shouldn‚Äôt turn off authenticator either imo which I believe it does now(not fully sure)
---
It does. The point of the authenticator delay is to delay such a removal. It's fair that recoveries will remove the authenticator, but it's unfair that it can remove it instantly since it means you have no way to get your account secured before the hackers gain access.

---
Nah it's not a bad idea, but there's clearly a need to be able to set a "default style" other than attack
---
Don't worry it's nothin personal against you. This is just a very dumb place, really. 
---
Refund the membership and make a new account I guess. It's unlikely you'll get unbanned regardless of if you're actually guilty or not so just cut your losses, it was only a day old account anyway. 
---
Lynx Titan literally got falsely banned for botting, and Jagex confirmed it.
---
The truth of the matter is that no system is perfect and anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something - the illusion of decent customer support, in this case.

I have heard some streamers and youtubers got their xp reverted but then again they are "influencers" so go figure. Would be a bad rep for jagex.
---
Or just wait half an hour lol
---
Yeah, and I spent a few days setting my farm runs up to focus on going after groot at the lowest cost possible. I just haven't been able to find the motivation to actually do the runs. 
---
Pretty sure you just have to use the website
---
Excited to see more progress! Should totally try to get into making videos
---
Stompy feet is ranged, waggly feet is magic
---
Pack it up boys, we've solved the crisis in the Middle East!!!
---
I totally understand. I got it at like 17m xp and almost said F it
---

---
But... They did fix this? Even when they use the rock fall attack several times in a row, as long as you maintain a line of sight with the gorilla, you should stay in combat with them... I've killed like 2.5k gorillas for my 4 zenytes and don't recall being pj'd a single time.  Is this something that happens to you often?  Can you record it?
---
Wrong! I believe that's Janet Jackson
---
U can reach 10b+ by just playing, and thats More than enough
---
Ikr? Takin up bank space lol
---
Platinum tokens is pretty good
---
Okay yeah thats what I was thinking. trying to make a baby pure. Not planning on bringing any high risk for prot item prayer to be needed just wanted to know what was good in terms of strength and attack level and if 1 def pure was worth doing or if I should train defense and what level, and what quests were great for starting out.
---
Not for me sadly. I always read left to right. Just like I always look at runescape skills left to right rather than columns.
---
Wow and i thought settled his challenge was difficult

I literally downvote every post like this I see. Way overdone to the point where they are annoying to see.

Uh not really

Pardon my ignorance but wouldn‚Äôt lending an item like a tbow even to a friend be suspicious to jagex for rwt? I‚Äôve never lent or borrowed anything from anyone that‚Äôs why I ask. 
---
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about Settled. u wouldnt say this shit to him at RuneFest, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol 
---
Probably should hide your username, 
---
I need crystal gloves from a song of elves quest to punch trees faster. 
---
Most of these are decent suggestions. Bronze and iron trimmed armour is already an easy reward though so I think it should just stay that way. Bronze heraldic etc. would be fine

I'm ashamed it took me until prayer

I remember when people got annoyed at people complaining about the membership price. It's been some time since then and it's still pretty lame that I play free games with better customer support. 
---
There have to be (ball park) 100,000 paid accounts monthly. Not saying jagex keeps 100% of that, just a little crazy how they use Twitter instead of their website for customer service...if you can even call it that. 
---
And turn off auto retaliate

Nah there's no who's deserving more it's pure probability you just hit the right number. Thanks for the words
---
I've clocked in about 28 hours over the course of five days. I'm really getting absorbed back into this game.
---
The first two are somewhat accurate not as accurate as all the skills together but still somewhat accurate. 
---
You are unusual 
---
I'm pretty sure the default prayer to start jad with is always ranged.
---
Man old school has some weird skill names 
---
Inb4 op gets hacked 
---
H
---
get a fire cape too :)
---
I started at prayer and it didn't hit me until I got to Construction and realized nobody in their right mind would guess a saw in wood is "is"
---
Without knowing what it is i would have said alchemy or just "cabbage".
---
Very unlikely. Most RWT is traded from a source acc (high lvl usually) to a fresh level 3 due to the frequency at which they're banned. Also they track everything. Its infinitely less suspicious to loan someone who's been on your friends list for presumably a long time than a completely new guy who's level 3. Obviously this isn't exactly how it works, but I'd only be worried about a RWT ban if you're RWTing.
---
It is. Total level 300 has been one of the first goals I've set for myself. Just this morning I also capped off getting 30 Firemaking, 25 Fishing, and 40 Defense.
---
The first time I got in the farming guild, I was in awe with all the stuff in there. Going in the intermediate section, I figured I'd just go inside the cave to see what it was. Then an orange colored item appeared in the ground and it was a bottomless bucket. I never got lucky with anything, been using this beautiful thing everyday.
---
why would she pray ranged? She'd clearly pray melee for your baby dds special
---
You‚Äôre right, but he has demonstrated gross negligence by failing to secure his email and RuneScape account with 2fa. Nobody gets hacked if they practice decent online habits and take 5 minutes to secure their login methods.
---
The sad thing is the community voted against hiding the polls so it‚Äôs really our fault they won‚Äôt hide the polls. Stop your whining and just play the game. 
---
The charter method is the fastest method, I don't know where you're getting your data.

This is all false, all the icons aren't crabs

Are they going to instantly lock it? No. But if a mod saw this and looked into it, they might lock it after seeing the account was suddenly being logged in from china and has been advertising a gold selling site for 48 hours at the GE.

And then u made ur pointüëåüèº

---
Why does he look like exactly like i thought he would look like
---
without prayer flicking you likely wont get 3+ kill trips, if you are able to flick then yes you easily could. otherwise expect 2, MAYBE 3.
---
Grindin' up right now baby
---
ok. my clan told me 96. guess it shall be that!
---
I would switch the book to a rune kiteshield for all the melee brothers. Also you should bring ava's accumulator for killing Ahrims with ranged, and killing things in the final stage. You should also kill the brothers in the following order to save prayer
---
Dharok
---
Ahrim 
---
Karil 
---
Then tank the rest without prayer tbh. You'll see why this saves prayer when you do it. You can learn how to prayer flick you'll save even more pots. Also you can forget about rune platebody/dhide legs and just wear rune platelegs and a d'hide body which you can do everything in, as platebody is terrible for doing magic. 
---
If you have the time to quest, go do Underground pass and get yourself an Iban's staff. This will speed things up too. 
---
O my dayz
---
Interesting. Thanks.
---
/u/JagexAcorn 
---
how do you know he is auto clicking?
---
I'm guessing AutoHotkey is considered minor, a lot of people made complain posts about their 2-week bans cuz game detected them doing multiple actions with 1 keypress. (a lot of big skiller clans like Hexis used to promote AHK and shared scripts, now they are fucked)
---
Most people would just make alts and do all the boring grinds on one account while training the other account for fun. It‚Äôs gonna be a shitty version of regular Ironman mode where you never have to gather resources on your account cuz the alts doing it 
---
Get torso, fire cape and barrows gloves and you are balling
---
Nice stats tho! 
---
Fucking magicka lmao
---
If you really want to solo bandos it would help to use dwh or bgs over sgs i believe. But if your going and want to learn prayer flicking once you get your hands down maybe sgs would be better. 
---
Fuck, I wanted to respond with that
---
My friend won 5b last week got so excited he gave me a free pair a ranger boots(bank went up my like 4 times) just heard from him last night he lost it all xD. I gave him back his boots and now he lost those lmao xD
---
The accounts, I'd imagine, would have a different indicator from other iron men so even if this is the case, it wouldnt impact anything. 
---
"Most" is also quite the exaggeration. 
---
I'm planning on starting Dragon Slayer very soon. I'm Lv.40 in all my melee skills and I have 37 HP. I currently have a rune scimitar and a full set of adamant armor, along with a combat bracelet, a ring of wealth, a Fremmenik (spelling?) purple cloak and an amulet of glory. Beyond lobsters and antifire potions, what should I bring with me (besides items needed to complete the quest?)
---
You should explore Zeah :) Lot of new content there. Get Hosidius favour for the farming and woodcutting guild and Shayzien for a Xeric's talisman so you can get around. 
---
Yes. It's preventable.
---
Most ironmen save their crates and open them later since rewards are rolled upon opening the crate and not receiving it. Odds are he has a lot of crates stacked up for later, but yeah still overall not worth it to be there for 31m exp
---
I had 4 heads when I got the 50 kc head as a fifth :D
---
Your gf is meta
---
Yeah I can prayer flick, problem is, I'm playing at 130-150 ping :s is it doable ?
---
Yeah, I might buy BGS, since I have extra cash :)
---
If you atill doing barrows i suggest you to buy god items like sara platebody because they give 1more pray bonus. If you going to tank them you should wear your runite amour. My order is first dharok karils and ahrims the others dont need really prayer. Also you can force trap them in the underground and hide behind obsjects
---
I don't really intend to get the torso but I'm trying to get the last 2 side quest for RFD to get barrows gloves. I'm not good enough with my prayer swaps for fight cave yet. Thanks!
---
if he is actively clicking then there are better ways to get exp. the only reason to do fruit stalls at that level is because you can auto click and afk. I personally dont care since the xp/hr on any auto clickable task is so low its ahrdly worth it.
---
Thanks for the tip! Gotta lot of combat training to do then
---
Nobody knows. I‚Äôm not against the concept if that part doesn‚Äôt get abused but I‚Äôm sure it will. I know a lot of people who say ‚ÄúIronman sounds fun but the gathering from scratch isn‚Äôt.‚Äù So a lot would, maybe not most. Plus group Ironman is quite contradicting in the name, it should be a different one 
---
This format is getting shart
---
With an admirals pie, you can boost +5, you are not using spicy stews, right? 
---
you dont need prayer for the melee brother (besides dharoks if you want to be safe) if you learn the hit-and-run method, which is very easy by the way. You will only ever use prayer on karil/ahrim or in the tunnel if you get dharok.
---
practice the kiting method and do Dharok(if you still want to pray against him until youre confident you wont get hit) &gt;karil&gt;ahrim&gt;the rest in any order. Unless you get a karil/ahrim/dharok with no safespot tunnel or just have bad hits because of lower stats, you shouldn't use prayer potions at all, and should need hardly any food. (only for mistakes/damage in the tunnels)
---
Ok do them in this order:
---
Dharock, Ahrim, Karil, Guthan, Torag, verac.
---
The first three are the ones you absolutely need to pray against or you‚Äôll generally get shredded, so do those first. Don‚Äôt sip pray pots in between, go as long as your pray lets you. For guthan, pray can be nice so he doesn‚Äôt heal on you but generally you don‚Äôt *need* it. Torag hits like a wet noodle so pray isn‚Äôt needed, and verac hits through prayer 25% of the time anyway so there‚Äôs not much point in wasting a pot on him.
---
Invest in an uncharged trident of the seas. Spend like 200k on runes to charge it, or if you can afford it just buy one fully charged. It has a great attack time, great damage, and the runes you get from barrows are the ones you need to recharge it minus the fire runes. So you can use it pretty much indefinitely.
---
Ranging ahrim is smart, think about maybe bringing a magic short bow and some broad arrows/cheap arrows. It will be faster than the cbow. I also bring a d hide switch (just body and legs) to improve accuracy and speed up kills. 
---
For karil, bring a poisoned dragon dagger and use all 4 specs on him before you finish him off with the Sara sword. It will also improve kill speed and save prayer.
---
Stick to that order and only sip pray pots when you 100% have to and you will barely use any. Just bring cheap food instead (I bring Karambs)
---
Gl on your chests friend!
---
That's the most disturbing thing. How can someone have so much space in the bank if they have both played the game for a long time and are obviously collectors...
---
FYI JAGEX YOU DO A FANTASTIC JOB AND WE LOVE OSRS
---
Kill them in this order. Dharok, Karil, Ahrim, Veracs, then do the other melee brothers in whatever order. 
---
Also mage karil still. You mage all brothers except ahrims. Which you range. 
---
I hadn't seen one in a while, took it upon myself :P
---
At 99 agility you should have 100% permanent run 
---
That‚Äôs really good to hear. Fuck sand casino addicts.
---
Yeah, I dont care what its named, but I actually LOVE the idea of having a micro economy amongst me and my friends. Having to farm materials amongst us.
---
So not gass or venom?
---
yeah I believe it should still be doable with some ping, I'd check out some bandos solo guides. Best of luck!
---
Contest powerless mods, winners against wont never. A read get PvP this! Their clan! 11 prizes! Add fucking Jagex Authenticator Dollars! Is delay!
---
I know about that strength bonus but since I don't like the mini game I decided not to get it. I don't really follow the efficiency scape stuff that much. Plus I'm going for justicar when I can afford it.
---
you can purchase membership again and make sure you use it on the correct account this time.
---
Just being sarcastic lol, nah there's nothing you can do about it though.
---
well considering i streamed me creating the account you can take your shit theory elsewhere
---
Dks are iconic for osrs. If anything it's the other bosses designs that don't really fit the theme of the game
---
Reward: 5 quest points and 10k prayer xp
---
It would be so much easier if they had any customer support. even a ticket system would be better than this.
---
Go to the rev caves in the wild and the chaos altar in the wild(right by the icy area) they are multi and there are so many people there on every world. You will have a lot of fun and hopefully get some good loot.
---
How is this a question? you're basically a max main with those stats
---
It's like a RoL for dcs. It would only work where RoL works. Whereas RoL has a chance to not teleport you based on how hits stack up, this ring would work 100% of the time a connection is lost.

Yea it sucks, but I do believe they have helped others with your same problem but not sure how they did it so hopefully someone sees it and helps you good luck

I agree, it was more to offer some overlap. If (t) went in beginner it would be removed from easy.

Ring of wealth seems pointless, the only coins there are from the chest which get puts directly in your inv, and i don't think the extra rare drop table chance nets you much profit. I would go for ring of dueling so you can heal/restore drained stats at clan wars for cheaper recovery, or lumbridge ring for a little prayer boost/run restore.
---
Before killing the last mager, I would suggest brewing to over full, restoring up to full prayer and re range potting if you have one, just so you have less stuff to worry about mid Jad. 
---
lol go home kid. clearly youre just mad your account isnt worth shit and it wasnt hacked.

Ah of course. That sucks man

26mil is just relative though. Someone with 94 agility and 99 prayer choosing to do this probably has hundreds of mils or a way to make that money easily through other methods.

While I can't speak for the pet item specifically - I've got an unshakable completionist sense, and already have a total of 15 pets to my name on the main + two others on my iron. The huge problem with the farming pet is that it's the *only* pet that's obtained passively. If I ever stop hunting the pet? I'll feel like I'm missing out on those pet chances every single day. 
---
It's less about having the pet as it is to stop *not* having the pet. 
---
Body staff would only be useful if it allowed autocasting of curse, weaken, or confuse, but then it would massively increase normal splashing xp/hr. An offhand that supplied infinite body runes might be a good thing. I doubt many would like it to have mage bonus, but it could have a small one. That might make it the expensive unique for beginner cllues, similar to ranger drops or 3a.

I know they have a features on the website somewhere for this, i have bought membership on the wrong account before and through searching their website i found a way to send a message stating what i did wrong and what account i was meant to use it on and they just tranafered it over since i had used only like an hour of the month they were fine to transfer the time to the account i wanted it on.
---
Honestly blue is where it's at. You'll get white just by playing the game. Only one you might actually have to grind for and not use is Lova but I did blast mine 75-85 so not even that is something I didn't use. Blue is the only one where you have to look at 70k agility xp and take the colored graceful instead.

bolts then went back to 1600ea and superiors back to 12200ea, I merched 1B spreaded between both things. I made a HUGE profit, could have kinda made a lot more if I waited longer, just one month, but I was actually using gp from gear to merch, so I couldn't PvM and prioritized having fun.

I can wait this merch for 3 months and it will be free 150M, which is almos three years of membership with in-game currency. And I guarante you it will return to it's average, it's value is related to alch prices, it's virtually gp, supply won't remain x5 times the usual supply.

Since this month macroing has going out of hand for jagex, due to jmod staff changes and amazon prime promotion, which grants 14 p2p for free so bot-farms are on fire.

Honestly I felt like getting 75 attack ruined my account, ended up getting defense soon after. I‚Äôd stay 60

*holds up spork* xD *nuzzles* lawl
---
Whoa watch the fucking language
---
Thats pretty scary if they really are compiling a list of wealthy accs purely to attempt to recover them. 
---
And targets for lures/scams. You'd be surprised how big the market is for it
---
That isn't going to happen. "Vanilla" as you call it has almost no target audience. When they tried to leave OSRS without updates at launch they barely got 7k players at peak hours after the initial nostalgia blew over. The game damn near died in the crib during that period, and was saved by updates. Its not worth dedicating the resources and manpower to something that has very little demand.

Really? I don‚Äôt see much of any upside to staying 60 tbh other than it being underpowered without the 99str and range, especially since I don‚Äôt really have to money to run d claws deep wildy

I have the same acc as you except 99 range and 92 hp I have also often thought of 75 att. The conclusion I come to everytime is the higher the combat the more proddy and rng based it is. I always decide to stay 60 att because I don‚Äôt like the max pure bracket because it‚Äôs just who can spec first. Honestly if you want an agser your best bet is to make a new baby acc. I‚Äôm only ever going to get 75 att and max my pure out one I can afford tbow and rapier from raids on my main that way I can do raids on my pure till I get pet for that fashionscape

Make sure you talk to Oziach too.

Also been happening to me.

tfw too poor for a bot to say my name

I don't play ironman and I'd never play group ironman either, but I think it's a really cool idea and hope they they add it for the people who would play it. I'd 200% vote yes

Just look at it diagonally. 
---
you arent describing a drop method. there are some actions where clicking a single item will open the first one in your inv for example but it doesnt work like this for dropping.

Lol nah, he was genuinely an asshole that ruined that atmosphere of the sub.

The recovery system for this 20 year old game is fine btw

Why are my posts being instantly removed?

I can't even play my max main anymore due to staking addiction. All I end up doing is grinding pvm until i have 20-50m and repeatedly chucking it until I get cleaned. Even when I had 12b I wasn't content with it and ended up getting cleaned within a week. 
---
shall we tell him?
---
Message a jmod on twitter
---
Interesting. I'll try to replicate it, but like i said it doesnt happen all the time but its happened enough to be something annoying. Out of 380 kills I can probably count on one hand the amount of times, so 5 or less. Maybe I am just to far away from the npc when dodging his rock fall? I'm never not attacking though for more than a second and also always in blowpipe range so not super far. I dont know if that matters or not. It happens more so than not when I'm further away than closer though, and i assume its due to when im close by the others arent as aggressive on me. 
---
A .78125% chance or a 78.125% chance?

No, I'm not doing Woox's method I just run through once, collecting all the books, bank at Seers, tp to house, use my Fairy Ring and then go again. Takes about 4 minutes for one run.

It already exists, it's how the majority of us play the game.

At least I‚Äôm a man of class, i fap to the girls arms.

This actually looks pretty darn good, wish we could get this.

for sure, I mean people who have knowledge on how to prevent it can. I have friends who play RS and aren't very knowledgeable they don't have 15 different emails with throwaway fake names they just casually play.

okay

These get more advanced by the day

I generally don‚Äôt, but I didn‚Äôt do any barrows until about base 80s for combat plus a blowpipe

This is so annoying. When I switch to mobile service or even if my internet goes out for .001 seconds, disconnected instantly. No connection lost waiting to re-establish message, just instant logout and can't get back in until my char x-logs

What is the point of having a 50b if youre not having fun?

Botting series? Like how he bots?

Loot gets rolled when you kill the NPC, it doesnt have a predetermined loot every time it spawns, so for example if someone steals your kill at a boss and gets a rare, that means he rolled a rare, that doesnt mean you should have gotten it if you got the kill instead

Oh then idk I usually see people in ahrims/mystic rather than void mage so maybe try that?

You can always request/suggest a feature on the Github repository.  That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll get added though*

I'd have to do a lot more temple trekking for that

I already called my Dad, Jagex, and he said he's taking care of it as we speak.
---
I‚Äôm so upset for having a different opinion lmao

I have Rocky. Just took pickpocketing the master farmer until level 93. Obviously I didn't do it for the pet though, that financed my PVM main to get slayer high enough to be cost neutral month to month with very little effort

Trimmed armour pieces literally already come from the other tiers of clue scrolls. Have you ever done a clue scroll?

RS setting -&gt; advanced video -&gt; close interface. I think it's called that. It's in the advanced video settings in RS somewhere
---
I watched one of theoatrix's videos and he recommended this one and said this was the only one he knew of that wasnt a virus.  It was web based and didn't require the installation of anything.
---
I was making a joke but I hear it‚Äôs worth it. Last time I did slayer in the wilderness I was pked about every 10 kills of my task. 
---
99.99% sure that's a private server. Though it could be some other game that's just using RS classic screenshots to advertise.
---
Confirmation bias
---
Just get all 99s
---
haha it's this post again!

It‚Äôs obviously from a private server as the spec orb is missing
---
Im definitely willing to boss with you if you can teach me a little bit, I've been getting into bossing recently, I have 200kc on Vorkath rn and I wanna try other bosses now. I'll look up a guide but I need someone to support me 
---
I love how horribly accurate this is
---
So it's kind of tagging it as a meme? Still confused lol
---
Because people like me have the experience with the community. As a matter of fact I can literally confirm that I am 99% right, as myself having lost an item and having to get help from jagex required me to exhaust every resource.
---
In doing so I got to see the scum the lies the manipulation brought out by the community to abuse and torture what little help Jagex has (11 mods ? 100k+ players)? 
---
Please you can shit talk all you want facts are facts if he got hacked hes in the less than 1%
---

and if he didnt hes in the 99% that are full of shit
---
Void is good for learners when you need more brews, but it gets bad when your team size increases because the defense of monsters gets too high. Eventually once you‚Äôre comfortable at CoX you should switch to torso/hide switch.

It was a joke lmao

Im risking a m'glory but with protect item all they get are the pure essence &gt;:D

Yeah that‚Äôs why I figured

Every time one of these posts make it to front page, there's like 10 other "I have a girlfriend too!" posts.

We do know you cannot *wear the capes* without 60 magic. So why would you want to get items you cannot use?
---
Aids and Cocaine addicts
---
Yeah if you've never seen a spoiler used properly before
---
Well I suppose I‚Äôm not to say what they can or can‚Äôt do about it. The clan isn‚Äôt breaking any rules to my knowledge, so I‚Äôm sure that makes it a bit more difficult for Jagex to justify doing anything about it. Also, most resolutions would probably involve drastically changing revs or pvp in the wilderness, which we know are both a big no-no.
---
Yeah and the air altar is near the bridge instead of south of falador, so definitely post-2010
---
lol yeah give your entire account away to one then.
---
Who‚Äôs bottom left?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I normally have all the ingredients because of farm runs anyway, and checking the vats once every day or couple of days isn't actually too much of a hassle. I like to chill and do daily runs of things so I ended up brewing ales!
---
It also takes 4 bites, so if your looking for non-brew max healing per inv space your better off using baskets of strawberries as they are 30hp/inv.
---
Are boss kc‚Äôs bugged? I checked my zulrah kc and it said 1, while I know for sure that I have more than that. I even have pictures of my next few kc‚Äôs.

In NMZ how do you all manage to survive for 6 hours with 20 minute afk? I use obsidian armor, have 80def, and rock cake down to 1 every 10 minutes or so but I can only last like 45 minutes on a gull inventory of absorbs. With attentiveness and overloads I can do more like 3 or so hours in a row but people are always talking about 6 hour sessions with 20min afk times.
---
Chaeldar.
---
Is that Vladimir Putin with the 50m sack? 
---
No you were saying you didn't have enough space and I was giving you an option to increase bank space is all
---
A % of that comes from fraudulent purchases. If all the bots and scammers disappeared they would not make nearly as much money. So by not having a clean support they keep the money coming in. 
---
The cooking guild üòâ I like where this is headed 
---
60 attack piety. But prod it. Don‚Äôt train hp levels and keep the combat below 100. Get creative and do your research. Gonna be a long build.

He wants guaranteed pickpocketing to be lowered on the lower leveled npcs

If OSHD was allowed, Runelite would have made it by now.
---
All that wasted bank space
---
True! But baskets require you to right-click to remove a strawberry and then eat each strawberry individually, therefore actually taking at least two inventory slots and requiring a lot more clicking than a keg of mature moonlight mead (which you can left-click drink from).
---
True...didn‚Äôt realize it was this good tho 
---
this is the most bull shit response
---
this is why ppl dont even bother 
---
Didn't they get rid of Jed so the clan can't really do anything like that going forward?

Lmao these are angry

Literally was going to post this word for word
---
If you die at cerb it's possible to make it back before he resets. If you don't make it back in time you've still got all the food on the floor, so it's easier to stay in same room.
---
It's also possible to get the first hit in on cerb and crash that way.
---
This guy's an asshole tho, a simple " hey I died here could you use another room" would have been enough
---
Noted thanks!

Yeah I bet you‚Äôre having a good time reposting shit that isn‚Äôt even a day old.

Very funny, what scams do people do there though?

I had stopped playing for that reason, now I want to go back to the game and I wanted to see what possibilities I could get it back 
---
Yeah but I'm not trying to do a long prod build that's why I mentioned with maxed stats for the build. Trying to be realistic a bit
---
I dont do much on there. What are u doin?

Don't plan on prodding it, so would you say it ain't worth it if I maxed it?

That‚Äôs fair, but the only place I can think of where this is useful is cerb. You generate invent spaces at the start of the trip pretty quickly by eating shark/manta/restores so the 2 inv spaces to eat isn‚Äôt much of an issue. Generally you will remove and eat 1-2 strawberries between kills while waiting for cerb to spawn so it‚Äôs not really an issue.

No, and I never said he was wrong. Just in general people who have opinions shouldn't present them as facts. It's wrong and incorrect. I get he thinks he's right, but he doesn't actually have any concrete proof about it. He stated literal statistics which have zero backing and cancel out any credibility he thinks he had.

I've been up keeping a spreadsheet since I started doing medium contracts, so far I've done every contract given and it has better me about 57k per contract, the average profit I've seen is about 40k for each seed pack, and minimizing the seed costs by passing yew and maple trees could easily make me more money but I have had a few sitting in my bank from WC and birdhouses so I figured I would do them. I've done 5 yew and 4 maples so far, and lost money on only 4 of the contracts, the only other fairly expensive contract ive found is white lilies, though their seed price is dropping. My data is a fairly small set, but it seems to have played at around 55-60k per seed pack

As a new player in the mainland you need to walk between Falador, Lumbridge, Varrock... The same goes for Zeah, and just as with the mainland, unlockable teleports and transportation methods do exist. 
---
Additionally, Mod West is in the process of making the "hubs" of Zeah more centered, shrinking buildings etc. Though the size of the landmass will stay the same, centralized hubs will aid making existing teleports even more useful.

Obviously im restricting myself on my lvl 3 skiller, but that doesnt mean a boss that lvl 3 skillers can have, f2p get bosses, mains get bosses etc, one lvl 3 skilling boss isnt gonna hurt but that also doesnt mean mains pures or whatever cant fight the boss, its just the boss is able to be killed by lvl 3 skillers, maybe not a need because technically we dont need any content, mini games arent bosses. I understand how the game is meant to be played, but thats how it was made in the beginning now we are 20 years into this game, which that statement doesn't really exist anymore, theres skiller combat pures range tanks whole bunch of different builds, its not all about playing the game how it was made to be played any more, and obviously restricting yourself doesnt make it unfair youre deliberately restricting yourself, but that doesnt mean things cant be made for said accounts. And obviously restrictions shouldn't be lifted, the game is fine and how things are locked for people who put in the work to get then, but I also get your point!

I‚Äôm doing it right now and if my cat doesn‚Äôt get those rats in the next 10 minutes it‚Äôs cruisin for a bruisin

That's why she gave it to him, no other women will want to steal him off her in that. Like when you feed your girlfriend hundreds of cakes to make her fat and unnattractive so she settles down with you.

If Runescape had a good animated series it'd honestly fucking kill it.

You're right, he could be autistic and keeps clicking the fake runescape pages to activate double xp. Deserves it if this is the 2nd time.

People spend thousands of dollars on pixel clothes in games that have nothing to do with gameplay. It's not that mindblowing. 11 dollars isnt that much.

We are truly in the golden era of memes

What...... I have never in my life seen someone use it at ToB. You don't need mage accuracy anywhere. Is there a meta I'm just not aware of?
---
I‚Äôd love to plant these instead of limps but they‚Äôre just so profitable
---
Depends on hit points and defense . I aggro'd the healers and killed them at 79HP and 77 range as they could out heal my DPS. 
---
I used blowpipe with dragon darts for jad. I think if they fully heal jad to full HP when he gets to half hp again they will respawn but not 100% on that 
---
Lol or ya know they got it at as a drop
---
I use the clan wars refresh between runs.
---
I don't typically use all those prayer potions, but if Karil is in the tunnel I do.
---
I guess bind is an idea, just need to bring the runes for it too.
---
I usually go Dharok &gt; Ahrim &gt; Karil &gt; Whatever, but I dont struggle with Ahrim.
---
You cant be like this
---
What a lot of people do is flick the double health regen prayer once every minute. This makes it so youll stay one hp all throughout the overloads. This makes the max 'hit' of the bosses 1. if you only rock cake down every 10 minutes, the mobs will essentially do 2-10 times more dmg to you.
---
Wait this is about to me as I just cracked open my 3rd beer. 
---
Obor the hill giant boss isn't bad. Drops plenty of rune items and a chance of the hill giant club which worth a fair bit ! https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Obor
---
This, holy fck that hosidius rework is beautiful
---
Wait what are they changing about death?
---
Good luck, idk if you'll succeed in purchasing any currently!
---
Range is possible for most bosses now tbh, people use t bow/acb and blowpipe against Bandos etc 
---
Why wouldn't you do it? 
---
Make a new account lol
---
I like this idea, needs reworking but still a cool consept
---
That was not his point.
---
I guess this is the great OSRS hospitality I keep hearing about.  Literally what would that solve other than being where I am with worth stats?
---
Daily reminder RoT use Jeds insider info to hack/recover accounts for thousands of dollars per account. Jagex won't do anything because they can't prove its them :dancingcrab:
---
This is RuneScape, not PetScape
---
lol 10k isnt ruining anyones life. come back to me when you hundreds of thousands in debt bud. and your an extreme case. hopefully you've learned how to control your addiction by now but i would say i would be happy with only losing 10k to straighten out my gambling addiction
---
No you didn't. You've had it for days waiting to post it you fuck. 
---
Some of the rewards are very cool additions, some are a bit too much for me, like the big boot and mole slippers. I proposed the gilded spade myself. I‚Äôm not a fan of stackable clues, bit I like stackable caskets. So my view is about the same as the poll results. :)
---
You can make a pure and not have a crap account. Those stats are doable within 2 days if not less. 
---
Banned already. L8er!
---
Check the boss log through a ring of wealth. That should fix whatever your issue is.
---
Why would I want a pure account for my first and only account so far?
---
no homo but i love you
---
Pleas fix
---
&lt;3
---
If you're using prayer defense bonus doesn't matter
---
Cause you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing or how to make money. So pvp. It‚Äôs the simplest money maker 
---
In my honest opinion, i think you could do that without getting banned, but you really should, it will really degrade your sense of accomplishment in game. 
---
How do u have inventory and armor tab open at the same time?

Don‚Äôt ever post stuff like this. It‚Äôs not funny. And you‚Äôre now funny for ‚Äúfinding it‚Äù.

Fair enough. Wouldn't it be worth using maging gear then so I stop hitting zeros on Karil?

Tbh tho the good people severely outweigh the bad so it's not too big a deal

woox = piccolo confirmed?

You eved said it yourself. If he had just googled the coordinates he would have found the solution. But he didnt. Because he has never done it before because he has only done clues with a cheat client before.

Okay there, mean boi ‡≤§_‡≤§
---
I was borrowing a tbow from a friend and a bot said this in public about my account at the ge, but I didnt see it my friend saw it, which means the bot said it before I was even close enough to see the player's chat
---
How does your chair smell 
---
More like Tzharr-Hurr

Go look at oak dice most recent video

You can trade a twisted bow for nothing in a trade without getting banned for rwt. I‚Äôve lent and had my bow returned multiple times

2fa on email. There's no excuse to getting hacked now a days. Unless you're completely incompetent on how it all works. Which is not the fault of Jagex.

Red cape best cape.

This is fantastic art. Well done! Would love to see more.

Buy bond = rwt thru jagex, convert cash to gold

Ehh prayer pots aren't that big of an unlock. I'm partial to super str, super att, and of course the big one saradomin brew. Prayer pots are done in the first month of UIM unless you play casually. By then you should have 10-12 rannar's collected so really by the time you need prayer pots you have a bunch.
---
If you need any beforehand you can get two super restores from one of the ogre quests.

Man, nothing says skill than being an opportunist looking for soft targets.

How do you try to stay sane? I‚Äôm literally losing it now.

My bad

Yup I have 2FA on my account and email, email only used for osrs, and password generated with a password manager. Also I obviously don‚Äôt click on fishy links. Bank pin as well which was randomized. As I keep growing my bank, I‚Äôm just afraid I‚Äôll become a bigger target. Maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid
---
There was a Minecraft server where you could play Runescape on the f2p world, and it was like the game where you could train attack, mining, woodcutting and etc.
---
I must be too new
---
What about raids 1 and 2, do i need magic and melee switches or just magic switch can do fine?
---
Is that an OSRS Minecraft mod?

I mean people doing wilderness slayer get emblems worth ~150k that are always lost on death so they are definitely worth killing
---
I always thought of them as like killer whales. They have something that resembles eyes, but not eyes that you can see. They use other sensory organs to view their surroundings. 
---
I also always thought dagannoth rex was the only one with an extra chromosome. 
---
Quite easy to get The Stuff. I have over 20 barrels of mature chefs delight thanks to it.
---
You dont get banned
---
The server itself does this on crowded worlds to not strain itself. You can't change it unless you go to a non crowded worlds AFAIK
---
Ahhhhhhh makes sense

Rune? Seriously? Black pickaxes have lower weight and you only need the pick to get through tunnels. Idk why anyone would bring anything besides a black pick.
---
It would be longer than one piece and even slower paced lol
---
I think West has said that rework Shayzien and Lova houses are on the list next. With what he's done with the Hosi rework, I am more than excited
---
Seeing this after WGS is kinda feels ;-;
---
I forgot how chaeldar used to look so different.
---
Very nicely done art! :D
---
on the bright side, your stats are low enough that you can do almost anything and improve your account. I'd say work towards barrows gloves and then firecape. after that, yeah slayer is good and you'll want it eventually, but there's enough goals you should focus on first
---
That happens with ALL players, in ALL worlds? I honestly thought that only occurred on bounty hunter worlds, or if you already had an emblem on you.
---
Holy shit dude, are people allowed to be proud of their achievements?
---
What do you define as crazy amounts?
---
OSRS already isn't oldschool anymore with items that were released post-HD update. 
---
I mean we've got dragon claws, gloves that are better than barrows gloves, shift-click dropping, 3rd party clients with an insane amount of plugins that make the game much easier to play (and also makes the game look like a spreadsheet with item overlays and tile markers).
---
It's funny and you're a crybaby who came back five days later lmao
---
They did get a slight overhaul with the seers ring buff. Not to mention archers ring is worth quite a bit. Ironically, its the ring I never get of the 4. 
---

I do have runelite! I haven‚Äôt really adventured into the plugins, do I have to install it? Or is it a toggle I can enable

Opposite here. RL plugins don't mean much to me compared to the atmosphere OSHD brought with it.

Also lets be real here such a client would without a doubt get plugins that RL and OSB have.

why 2 options though?

whats the difference?

It‚Äôs more afk if you run normal rumble with super combats. You only need to click 24 times for a 6 hour session you‚Äôll get like 80k an hour

lmao responded in 10 seconds were you sitting in front of this comment thread the whole time just to wait for my response?
---
will do, thank you good sir.
---
yea for real. the roads are 5 tiles wide. Nowhere else is it that wide
---
Spec opportunity I suppose? It adds 10 to the max hit potential, making speccing someone when the bolt procs a little easier 
---
To be honest I think I'd prefer an official version of [Gudi's Bronze Man Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFNfa2saOJg) over Iron Man Mode that could capture most of the same concept.
---
I get the idea behind Group Iron Man but Bronze Man Mode could emulate something similar by making it so you can only trade with other Bronze Men if you both had unlocked the items being traded through other means (such as one of your party getting it as a raid drop, thereby allowing you to trade duplicates amongst one another as long as you do instances together consistently). The only other thing they'd have to keep in place is not allowing you to pick up other player's mob drops unless you pked them out of their inventories.
---
Sure you'd still get the benefits of PKing and the GE but those are all opt in and still have to be 'earned' as long as you don't wintrade drops.
---
Using runelite theres an option named inventory viewer I think
---
Yea I kinda expected to get downvoted. People upvote nooby questions in this thread because they think it‚Äôs cute and mine is clearly not nooby lol
---
Thanks for your input. With the mod Jed stuff happening, I‚Äôm a bit paranoid but I guess all I can do is stay on top of my own security and hope (or switch to default client)
---
The lure one? What part does he talk about the level 3 bots? I don't remember that
---
If and when you do come back to the game I‚Äôd recommend setting goals that aren‚Äôt luck based, I take since you‚Äôre doing barrows that means your account isn‚Äôt maxed, Ive recently been working on all hard diaries after finishing my quest cape. They‚Äôre attainable goals that have little to no rng. Also if you have the stats for it try a boss like vorkath or zulrah, you can make a tab in your bank strictly for the loot you get from the boss, and although you might be unlucky with the big drops it‚Äôs equally as satisfying to watch your bank tab accumulate millions of gold worth of loot you can eventually cash in on 
---
Ah ok. Didn't know there was gambling. I'm pretty new tho so haven't got very far away from lumbridge.

I'll have what hes having, DM me OP.
---
I think there‚Äôs a niche of content for everyone to enjoy in the game and mine for sure is clues. I‚Äôm not saying that I could enjoy *just* doing clues, cause that would get preety stale after a while. Switching up content is key to enjoying the game!

Good point

Man, you just can't get enough lol

Would still be nice to have an option to have HD graphics

Dragon hunter lance and all the alts camping rune drags with it play a part too. Not that I‚Äôm complaining it was always bound to happen lol

Of course they are. Are you implying that a cheese cape is an achievement?
