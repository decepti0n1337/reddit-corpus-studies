Most of the "bots" in the wilderness are hand played gold farming accounts, mostly Venezuelan or other South American countries. And prayer is quite fast regardless of any requirements that may be put in. Source: I pk them a lot and they always complain in Spanish.

Stop at base 10, and never touch this acc again.

Jokes aside why did they decide to make Torag an absolute *daddy*

What are you mistaking ardougne with? It has never been f2p

My lord, nearly finished 170 mil.

---
How long did that take and was it all 3t granite? Wew lad
---
Ahh, makes sense,  I’d smith some steel bars in blast furnace if you have coal bag, get that to level 70 it’ll add some funds to get you started and get you one of the reqs for ds2

He looks so fucking sick of our shit lmao poor npc

Thought d2h triggered without needing a target.

I was just doing this math myself after noticing how dirt cheap divine ranging's are. The extra levels needed to craft hurt a bit though.
---
When the game was at its peak:
---
* Botting software was much less advanced
---
* CPUs were much weaker
---
Offensive power has also drastically increased while defensive power hasn't increased as much, which makes spec trading more powerful.

Anyone questioning how he only has 65000 scales? They drop 100+ every time so I’m theory he should have minimum 200,000 scales?

---
Are you religiously doing farm runs and birdhouses? Varrock battlestaves?
---
Exactly.
---
Erm, that’s a Guthan’s torso.
---
I don’t have the ability to reliably do birdhouse and herb runs with school around. I always do battlestaves and I jut got a bond and used it for more members

&gt;Imagine being able to kill ur little mule to gain 1min immunity in the wild.
---
You could have your mule box you to achieve something similar.
---
I just leveled to 70 and it was only like 3 mil after hardly any training before that, mostly from farming and quests. It’s not that bad
---
I've noticed this with alot of monsters, next time you do a slayer task or kill guards you can see that they will start off spawning in their one spot then after they will randomly spawn a tile or 2 away
---
Yes, and after voting in the poll jagex should give me a muta please god why

Woooo wooo wooooooo
---
15 items recieved, drop rate of that table is 1/100
---
you are 50% over the drop rate. that sucks
---
The more you know..
---
It most definitely would not.
---
Let me explain it from a different angle that might be easier to understand. Right now a clan charges 25m (just using a reasonable guess here) to obtain a torso for you. HOWEVER, not only you but also the other 4 clan members have obtained enough points for a torso of their own. Currently, no one ever thinks about those other torsos because they are untradeable but technically you paid 25m to obtain 5 torsos. You just had to pay the clan for their time because they quite frankly don't need that additional torso.
---
If they became tradeable now, torsos would not cost more than 1/5th of how much they cost to obtain now.
---
Yeah home teleport and Ardougne Cloak 1 let me travel around almost anywhere without law runes. Add in spirit trees and the keldagrim cart system, and I almost don't need teleport runes on my ironman.
---
The real meme is PHP
---
How much are the gauntlets? Ps why is it so expensive?
---
So you got 3 farming before you got 2 hunter? 
---
Failed account start again
---
Would make my skilling pet only ironman take about twice a long to complete and I still haven't even gotten a pet with 30m total xp. I would be for this if it wasn't a part of the regular skill such as how wintertodt gives the phoenix but the buyable part of firemaking does not.
---
Herblore already has a pet and its name is Herbi.
---
Construction/crafting already has a pet and it is the clockwork cat (toy cat) requires 42 construction and 85 crafting. Although something like a Termite pet for construction would be cute, he could have dialogue about eating your discarded oak doors and such.
---
Smithing could have a pet from blast furnace and make the pet like a burning ember or coal.
---
And fletching is dumb and nobody should ever train that skill. "Why fletch?"
---
Also even though you failed to mention it - cooking also already has a pet, the pet cat. It eats all of your cooked fish and such and the reward for Gertrude's Cat is cooking xp - there's even a random event about cooking fish with Evil Bob the cat.
---
6 charges if you a wild one
---
well when they first made them tradeable they would probably sell for around 80-100m on the first day. Then after people start farming it, it will drop to \~5-6m to be in line with the other money makers in game.
---
Wat state u licensed? Lmao florida here
---
literally just gambling
---
go to the duel arena w2 (i think? idk) with nothing but a tentacle whip and money, challenge people, die and lose your money, get tilted
---
N0thinglats Day 1 - 375 Building a acc while playing only 10 hours i think a week
---
Honestly barrows is your best option. While you may be a tad dry, it will pay off eventually. I would recommend doing mory hard for more gp/hr without relying on barrows items. A little more prayer will pay off in the long run, once you get to a sip or two per run its more cost efficient (maybe try starting with dharok, karil, ahrim, guthan, torag, verac rotation - i have better stats/gear and run ahrim[to get the switch out of the way], dharok, guthan, karil, torag, verac, for a slightly more efficient run once you get there). 
---
Then wear melee def gear and magic damage items, like occult necklace. Weapon progression goes ibans staff, unupgraded trident, upgraded trident. 
---
Ma2 cape helps too. 
---
Gl mate!
---
ecu keys would probably sell for around 600-800k each
---
Um I don't know how you're playing the game but it didn't affect me at all...didn't waste my time with Knights before and I still don't. Hasn't affected any part of my game. You know why? Because I don't care about others' success in this game
---
If you have full DH, giant mole will be about 450k-600k an hour for you
---
Of course it is, the game has turned into babyman mode.
---
I've done Zalcano, it's great GP on top of a chance to get a BIS item.
---
Go fight Jad.
---
wow im a dip shit, thanks boss
---
Yes let's make the game objectively worse so that we need even more requirements to get our stats back. Brother, you can just die to a pit of fire in your POH and get your stats back (and lose skull).
---
So you are complaining that the Wilderness is dead because you run into clans in multi hotspots? Maybe if you don't want to deal with teams, have you considered trying singles?
---
Doing some quests to get range xp up (dorgeshuun questline and animal magnetism) will be useful to kick start your training
---
Bone crossbow is also a very cheap and decent weapon in the early game, but use a magic shortbow with rune or amethyst arrows once you get 50 range. Also pick up a msb imbue scroll when you do switch.
---
This just made me want to close doors whenever I leave a place in RS now

You can attack back without getting skulled. You only get skull attacking unskulled people as far as I know
---
Upstairs or downstairs on Varrock west bank was always cool
---
mith darts and no bp?
---
The wiki does not have a sample size. The only accurate information on the Enhanced Crystal Chest page is for the Dragonstone armour and Uncut Onyx, because it was released by JMods.
---
i didn't know mandingo played osrs
---
I might actually go back to the horrid boss who refuses to give me an unsired.
---
An arena where you can challenge opponents to a fight with set rules and you can stake GP on the outcome. 
---
In practical gameplay, nobody stakes with armour and different levels and pots and food (you'd just go PKing)... They stake using a universally agreed fighting method which is melee with a whip and nothing else and 99 attack/str/def/hp which gives a near 50-50 chance of winning.
---
Some other niche staking options exist like the same with DDS and specials enabled or mage.
---
If you want to play around I'd recommend trying it out in free to play first.
---
That's the right, right? Or am I wrong?
---
Underrated comment
---
Isn't anti trust when you monopolize an industry and nothing to do with the scam?
---
All three of those would make the boss suck so much less.
---
Wake him up with a stun? No longer need to switch the blowpipe to long range and back to rapid. Being able to refresh the stun instead of waiting an extra 3-5 seconds doing nothing. #4 would be such a big improvement to the boss on its own too.
---
I remember when I thought I’d try rs3 for the first time and logged into my account which was like 80+ all combat stats. I didn’t have that quest completed for whatever reason so I put on my best gear and died to that stupid demon that was like level 60 because I chose the worst gear for it
---
Isnt it only good for sire?
---
i got my dragon defender after like 3 kills then another a few kills later
---
jagex love to poll things that are an easy fix. this guy wants a new graceful colour? poll it, he wants new spellbook icons? poll it.. zzz

Yours looks cool though
---
Wow! Thank you for that math! Crazy to think about more than 2 hours wasted on a blank hit.
---
can we focus on minigame in perticular add soul wars to osrs or something similir as mod ash has pointed out.
---
Why can't Divine Atk + Str + Def potions be combined with Torstol to make Divine Super Combat potions?
---
Current market prices peg this method as 2-3k cheaper than Divine Super Combat potions are currently.
---
Hold up. If you have it in your house does it respawn? I drop tricked a stockpile that I just leave behind

Lol this is the dumbest thing I've ever read. There's no way that banking dark essence, getting stews, and running through the abyss is *less* afk than ZMI. You even mentioned at one point that you were trying to be nearly tick perfect with AHK macros. 
---
At that point just bite the bullet and spend the 9 hours at zmi. 1 hour on each weekday and 2 on each weekend and you're done.
---
Pretty sure you can do zalcano too
---
300 cballs a task isn't unusual. Period
---
Yeah, they'd cost a lot. For the first while.. but after a couple years, the less desirable ones would become pretty cheap. They'd always cost more than jars, as they can be shown off easier, but I could see some eventually cost under a mil. Chaos Elemental Jr. for example.
---
General store. Alching is tooo slow.
---
What a stone-cold thing to say
---
"Nani the fuck"
---
I'm 800 dry for serp hoping this doesn't happen. Definitely tragic for a tanz tho
---
Realistically, if you’re going into the rev caves with gear where 72k is steep to you, you’re wasting your time anyways.
---
Oh, my bad.  Still probably better to not have the reduced range accuracy
---
These "PvPers" aren't even PvPers. Any lurer/skull-tricker is not a true PvPer whatsoever, they're actually terribad players who've learned the basics of PvP purely to perfect their surprise rush to RWT. 
---
If a "PvPer" goes through this much effort to skull-trick, they may as well be treated like bots and receive bans.
---
You just said it yourself.  The Chaos Elemental.  King Black Dragon.  It's always been there.
---
Do the demon butler, construction training and house parties sorta thing
---
I literally had no idea what this is or how it works so I skipped question. Is it a high slayer monster?
---
Damn! That's what I call dedication
---
&gt;There's no way that banking dark essence, getting stews, and running through the abyss is less afk than ZMI.
---
Getting spice for stews is afk. It's roughly 1 minute per 4 spice, which involves clicking on a door, pressing 1 -&gt; spacebar and waiting. 
---
Mining dense essence is afk. Nothing more to say here.
---
ZMI is *semi*-afk. I did it to 74, and chose this method from 74-77 because I found it *more* afk.
---
&gt;You even mentioned at one point that you were trying to be nearly tick perfect with AHK macros.
---
[That was the video I was referencing, not me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7q61XKFUU4&amp;feature=youtu.be) I did not use a macro.
---
on high risk worlds you cant use protect item. thats the reason people dont go there often
---
Is there any way you can fix/improve server lag spikes? Even on the lowest ping worlds, lag spikes are prevalent. These cost a tremendous amount of gp when in an instance, and kill some of the highest level HCIM.
---
Thank you
---
Nice one, that's just about all you need to do! I'd recommend also doing Birdhouses they are a bit of money and pretty nice hunter exp. 
---
Yeah scimmy will be your best go I think.
---
TOP KEK

He said weren’t bro can’t you read

Its really easy to not know if your leader is using one. They could easily be keeping the scout 1-2 worlds ahead so we wouldnt ever run into it
---
How does your chair smell?
---
Best one
---
Mining dense essense is the least AFK part of making bloods. The two most AFK parts are auto-chiseling and the run to the altar and you're not doing either of those lol
---
I always seem to profit 50% of my investment into my kingdom. I show up halfway through the week to chop like 12 maple logs and then again on Monday to collect my loot. I put 1m in the coffer and I get 1.5m in coal and teak logs, a bunch of useless gems and about 5 birds nests. I love it, it makes me laugh, it makes me cry, most importantly &gt;!I shidded and farded and cummed my pants!&lt;
---
Fair enough
---
What kind of Doritos does your room smell like when you take off your shoes? Cool ranch or nacho cheese?
---
No clue about the differences. But anyway to recover my account?
---
I did ZMI from 49-74. How is that barely any? That's at least 25 hours of it, which is more than enough time for me to make up my mind on what activities I prefer over it.
---
Rest of what you said is arguing for the sake of arguing. It's irrelevant which aspect of blood rune crafting is *the most* afk. The comparison is between strictly between ZMI running and dense essence mining, at which point it's a preference. You prefer the 30 seconds of afk running offered by ZMI (followed by 30 seconds of semi-active engagement), and I prefer to click 3-7 times over a 3 minute window to mine essence, followed by 2 minutes of afk running around / banking. Nothing more to discuss.

You must not text people often

---
Probably 4+ years away.  You're about 10% of the way there, especially with doing afk methods
---
I believe when you kill the zombie spawn and unfreeze, you can immediately go back to attacking, but vork will remain invincible for a tick.
---
Someone go make this meme real quick I’ll invest
---
Wow that's mean. What are rags, bolts, and ancestral? Are they cost-to-power efficient gear for pking?
---
They could also try to add a little icon next to the name of the player who attacked you. They do something similar on DMM for skulled players, but those are global things and not per player.
---
The first two points are literally asking the devs to make the game worse.
---
yeah I was leaning on lvling up my str and slay
---
If you'd quit because third party clients were banned, good riddance.
---
This couldn't be made retroactive.
---
No point. Too tedious
---
I NOTICED THAT! 
---
I NEVER hit damage during the time I’m frozen and still attacking and then when I kill the facehugger and go back to attacking it’s always zero
---
I uh.. also learned today that zulrah is immune to the attack style it’s using so you need to bring a mage switch. That made me feel a bit silly
---
UP THE ENTE
---
There are actually 2 wasted hits per kill, so you should double it
---
Yep, and it's not offensive to make that observation. Look at all those downvotes you received though
---
UIM doesn't need to be made easier. Play with the restrictions.
---
Faster attack speed is important at barrows because of overkill, and because it lets you kill before the prayer drain more often
---
Just give it a day or two, you’ll be fine
---
blowpipe for heals and woox walking if you do that
---
If you're able to play for 12 hours a day for the two weeks you pylay for, then sure, it pays off, but most people have jobs and other obligations.
---
He
---
Many of his kills could have been before collection log was released
---
KBD isn't actually in the wilderness, though. You need to run a quick 10 seconds through the wilderness to get to it, but once there, you're completely safe.
---
doesn't go past that on the collection log.
---
You’re not completely wrong, but a full barrows set is only like 22k an hour to use, less with a repair stand and smithing level. It may as well count as non-degradeable.

Sure, it's definitely better to switch. The defense changes with each style but it isn't immune.
---
Is there an option to release them? Either that or drop the cage and go get a new one. Talk to the seer. And then catch them again. Defo a bug it seems.
---
Don’t give them any ideas now
---
I'd like to believe that good rewards like the ancient armors/weapons would even make the proposed BH rework moderatly succesful, but as it currently is with the current rewards I'm fearful/expecting that it will be dead on arrival. I know that PvP on it's own even for the better players is very unrewarding, and that is why I would like there to be a chance to potentially earn a good drop that scales with risk. Say your average pure risks 80k - 100k in gear/supplies, based on that risk their potential reward upon killing their target could range from the 100k-500k statuette range, that way players who might not even achieve a 1.0kda could still potentially break even/profit if they hit the higher end of that drop table and it could provide players with the incentive to continue to learn and go back to BH rather than leave it all together. Now say you have a main build and you risk say 250k-400k, your loot could then scale from say 500k - 2m range and even a chance at the higher value statuettes but only a small chance. Aside from the rewards, I think that allowing players to bring their expensive +1 items to use without fear of losing it ontop of the losses they already face would be a fun concept that could attract players. As it is, multi-pking in BH was non-existant but allowing players squad up with their friends to venture out and Ags/claws/dbow players out in multi without the fear of getting speared/maced/smited by massive clans would be good at bringing some life to the multi scene.
---
ah didn't know that. makes sense now
---
Ok thankyou :)
---
Auto TB in combat and make a really fucking absurd pj timer thats like a minute long.

There's a difference between an unfair fight and exploited game mechanics. If you're in singles, you should be able to expect single combat.
---
You have a lot of raids gear already may as well get those stats up and learn it
---
Thanks for your input, what are the reasons behind those levels?
---
Are you a btw? What antipoison/venom are you using?
---
I wouldn't mind prayer pots crashing in price, there are other pots to bank on.
---
what other stats do i need? and is there any other gear i need?
---
This post just made me realize that all of RS is just a One Small Favour simulator
---
I did it back before ZMI and has to struggle through Nat running, so I'm a sucker for afk. Done 77 on two accounts since then and zmi is so relaxed even on mobile or afk at work. Glad it exists honestly.
---
Need the Drake meme for this
---
The game didn't come out in 2007.  It rolled back in 2007 and became something different entirely.
---
KBD taking 10 seconds to get to is a newer thing. There have always been resources and other things in the wilderness. Mage Arena is another example.
---
Just admit you don't like PVP. Stop acting like jagex ruined the game by not catering to safe PVMing any more than they already have.  Honesty comes off better than your terrible half truths to make your point.

Edited the post. Sorry I never thought To give the reasons. I’m such a bot

all good my man, thank you so much :) ill definitely work on those

I read the title and thought wow that was probably cancer, I'll check it out. What I didn't expect was to learn that there IS A FUCKING TELEPORT TO DORGESH-KAAN. I've been running through the god damn Lumbridge basement for years...
---
From a non-pker perspective, what's holding you back from pvp worlds? I never really got how it was any different other than the builds with untradebles.

No people talking to him about visage drops? Missed oppurtunity.

You sir have changed my life. Accept this poor mans gold.
---
Me when sandwich lady arrives
---
Not when you get tb'ed for what feels like an eternity. When I get away it feels insanely lucky. I dunno if this would be gamebreaking but imo teleblock (bane of my existence as a pvmer/clue hunter) should have some countermeasure. Protect from magic doesn't work (but maybe should). Maybe it should miss sometimes or have a random timer between 20 seconds to 3 minutes. Maybe there should be a counter-spell or potion or shield. 
---
You already can't teleport above 30 wildy regardless. Either let me teleport in the entire wildy or let me have some way of countering a teleblock.
---
If you have trouble leveling your herblore you could’ve done tars like marrentil tar. Super strengths/energies are not bad since you just lose 2-3m doing them.
---
These are all gold so far, been laughing so hard. Please keep it up.
---
Doesn't sound very afk honestly
---

---
This is what scares me. People are completely overlooking the questions and are just assuming EZscape because they’ve never done the boss and don’t realize what these changes would actually do. This whole boss just has so much down time where you’re just waiting for him to complete his animations, making the fight unnecessarily longer. There’s definitely a clear difference between making something easier and making something outright more enjoyable to kill, but if uninformed people just vote no because they don’t know any better it’s super frustrating.

Long schlong tho

Barrows gloves
---
Yeah I get where you're coming from, these protection clans (at least the one I'm  in) are run quite well. You get plenty of kills/hr, but it still comes down to rng. 
---
It's great for boosting banks on ironmen and going for the uniques, but even mains should be able to make the money back playing a few hours a day. 
---
If you paid 50m for a week, that's only 7m per day which is easy doable for a couple hours in the morning and a couple at night.

It’s a cock and balls. A twig and berries. A penis. A dick. A q p w.

Pretty cheap at crafting stores! Just super glue that hoe or something haha

HP is hard to control to an extent. Prayer is the killer. Could always look up a combat level calculator and throw your stats in just to see how much your HP actually affects you.

Whoever wrote that quest had tons of fun and knows his audience 100%

First time I didn't skip most of the dialogue and it was worth every second

okay whos IQ was high enough to figure this one out.
---
You'd definitely still be able to solo bosses. At Sara...
---
Archer's helm, ava's accumulator, glory, black dhide, tbow, amethyst arrows, rune gloves, pegs, suffering. That's using the three protected items while not on task. If on task add a slayer helm as your +1, if off task replace as needed.
---
You wouldn't get the kind of rates you would get with max range, but you'd still do fine. Things like DKs would be very difficult because the kill speeds would drop to the point where the others respawn before you get the kill.
---
I dont see anything.

Well yes in this context but that still doesn't make it ok. If a group of people understandably takes offense to the use of it based on its role in history, why is it hard to people to just not use it? Not caring if its offends people is just as bad as using it to be racist.

Damn. I admire the commitment. And a good write up. Glad I'm past 77

Idk thinking about it Galvek was atleast twice as hard as jad, was just annoying having to get to jad 3 or 4 times

No clue but needed for lumby elite was prob just gonna use it for fairy rings

Pking with whip on pure is insane fun for a couple levels.

If it makes you feel any better you're as close to getting the drop now as you were at 1 kill!

And this is why 420 isn't my home world. Im a stoner don't get me wrong but 420 is just full of cringe at the GE.

Why don’t we flip it. Brilliant!

Why would you have separate PJ timers? Just add in both lol. Give pkers the peace of mind that when they attack a person nobody else can attack them besides that person. I would have a hundred more smited +1s if jimmy’s friend didn’t hit me off him when I had jimmy smited and at 5 hitpoints. I shouldn’t be able to be attacked by anyone else other than my opponent in single-way combat areas. 
---
I’d like to see a PJ timer added that prevents NPCs from hitting you off your opponent as well but let’s not get carried away now.
---
Replying to this so I can go down in history
---
Yes
---
I love these. Think you could do one for Duke Horacio or the Cook?
---
that just doesnt make sense, hardcore or not wouldnt matter, because the people wouldnt get teleported into the boss room, but into the next instance, dont know how to word it better.
---
Get 83 smithing, 1-2 runecraft levels, 1 woodcutting level. Quest cape if you don't have it for some reason (you're 1 lvl from 72 mining for Making Friends, but that's easily boostable) Then do lumbridge elite diary for the block slot and easy fairy rings. 83 smithing is the only req that will cost you any money, about 10m in gold ore from 71, so you can spend the rest on the good suggestions everyone else gave.
---
Blasphemy
---
Far too much power for one person

Oh, you're the guy that did the other one. Thanks, cheers.

Could you make it so that QuickChats used in RS3 show up (as regular text, no icon or anything) in OSRS? At the moment, Quick Chats do not appear whatsoever, the game acts like no message was sent. (this happens in my cc alot)

Just got my first zenny at 282kc! Then a spring at 295 :/

Because if they didnt everyone would be bitching "why was this polled"

Bro you get given one in a quest? You haven't done Another slice of H.A.M?
---
Lmao imagine free speech amiright
---
What was your favorite and your least favorite skill to get to 99? Why?
---
And what is your favorite skillcape emote?
---
Imagine free speech applying to a race that doesn’t have free speech and is seen as “normal to be killed in America”

Pkers are ruining pking. Maybe if they werent so toxic they would have a better community.

got so used to putting it on rc on my main I accidentally put it on my iron rip

Racism is funny “Runescape community 95-99% white”

Start banging out diaries man, go for quest cape. It’s really not as bad as it seems

83 con and max house, or zenytes

So your getting shit for being a pmod?

dont buy bonds first of all

Gz man.
---
OSRS wasn't out when you was 12, you mean rs2
---
If you turn auto retaliate on whoever is hitting you is put on top of the pile
---
That's literally the exact drop rate too, 1/2560
---
You don't really aim for more than 2 kill trips with blowpipe at vork.

Zulrah is probably better if you don't have dhcb

Something akin to poop knife?

O m g what have I been doing all my life

Wily cats are necessary for this since normal cats take forever to kill the behemoth

bc of people that already spent a bunch of time killing Vorkath that don't want it to be even marginally easier for other

Thank you!

If a boss has a waking up animation, just seems off to me that it could be stunned during it so that the stun then comes after the animation.
---
No.

I just vote yes to everything, even if I'm uniformed. I trust Jagex's polls

I agree they need a pj timer, looting timer and if a huge team is on you the person attacking you needs to be on top of the pile so you can actually see who you are fighting.

the difference between your two examples is that the person crashing you would also have to be flaming you as he did it. Yours is more if the person getting pked flamed the pker which is just as common as pkers flaming when they get the kill.And no shit people are mad when you crash them, theres very few places in this game you actually have to crash someone at for any reason other than "im too lazy to hop"

Kinda sounds like you’re the problem.

I love that my banking app is BOFA.

You think I’m reading all of that?

It's so nonsensical. They really aught to start polling monsters with some more information like "basilisk knights would be similar in difficulty to a bronze dragon" so we have a chance to provide feedback before they make it into the game.
---
My friend lent me a T bow recently. Can confirm, I t bow all the way. Range phase gets hit by range often, mage slightly more but the melee phase is hard to hit on.
---
My best kill was 0:55 on task yesterday. I dont know how good thats considered but I felt like a champ.
---
Oh and its also waaay cheaper than trident/BP.
---
You for real bro
---
I also quit in Karamja. Died many times in f2p before I turned members but didn't realise you could pick up your stuff. When I finally got p2p I was so excited to explore, got poisoned by a villager, freaked the eff out, couldn't get into shilo for the bank, just ran around asking for antidotes etc, died wondering around the jungle and gave up.

Goddamn. Goddamn.

I think the concept is good because:
---
* A fossil boss would really fit in the area and would make fossil island complete. 
---
* Your number of fossils limit how much you can fight the boss so it suits for mains and they will never get sick/bored of the boss. 
---
* Gold farmer bots wouldn't be able to camp it 24/7 while zulrah bots for example can camp zulrah limitless until they get banned.
---
Wouldn’t this be able to get things through in game censors? Like typing certain banned phrases/words?
---
Thats why I hate it
---
i really do love how modern runescape things blend so nicely with the game, it feels like all these items have just always been in this medievel fantasy game haha xD
---
Trying so hard to get Zulrah consistently. 
---
Getting clapped every single time and IDK why.

Yeah fishing and wc have fallen too far behind PvM in terms of gp. 
---
For example Minnow fishing is not afk and requires anglers outfit but gives me 300-350 k gp/hr.  
---
At brutal black dragons I make 1500 k / hr. Brutal black dragon alts make 500 k / hr.
---
Woodcutting we are usually talking about profit rates of 50-100 k / hr unless you are chopping ents in wildy or making 200 k / hr in prifddinas by chopping teaks at the sawmill and banking planks.
---
I want crystal axe to chop 2 yew and 2 magic logs at once.
---
longer than my dick that’s for sure
---
That‘s a weird fairy ring
---
Should dungeoneering at some point hypothetically pass the polling system, how difficult is the implementation of it? As contrasted against a similar sized project without reference in the past of Ruenscape.
---
He has the minimum stats for all the quests you need as a main pker. He went with herb and fletch to boost up to 1750 to pk on those worlds or a clan rec. He probally has 25m+ range xp and was likely a med build before going max combat because 77 pray. I dont think he bought the acc let alone many people selling accounts like this.
---
82 or 83 cons would be top priority. Not worth owning vork gear (dfw) without a restore pool.
---
I'd ditch tassy bc it's barely better than v skirt and 30x more expensive. Facegaurd also not super useful imo, bc I rarely melee off-task.
---
You could buy kodai for burst tasks or dwh and 78 herb for cox.
---
Yea fair, what is your favourite part of the game?
---
Thats a fake email. "A.jagex.com"
---
It's not new, and it is not wholy obtained by members only activity..... It's purchasable from npcs.
---
Infernal cape should give increased catching rate of infernal eels.
---
Serp with any mutagen should give increased catching rate of sacred eels.
---
They already changed the science to this. Years of research.
---
Use runelite
---
Equipped Infernal cape should give increased catching rate of infernal eels.
---
Equipped Serp with any mutagen should give increased catching rate of sacred eels.
---
I thought this was Uri for a minute.
---
Suggestion: Do Uri.
---
Why 86 cons? Only need 82 for pool/occult and 83 if you care abt last tier jewelery box
---
These shouldn't even be polled imo lol.
---
He's already 90+ no reason to dump money into those as he is a main and will get those 99s through slayer easily
---
Almost as bad as a botched toe
---
when the acid kicks in during the maze random event
---
Could an equipped Infernal cape give increased catching rate of infernal eels and an equipped serp helm with any mutagen give increased catching rate of sacred eels?
---
Nice what bank is that

&gt;Diversity still makes the concept of fossil island boss good.
---
No...? It's 100% possible to make diverse content that's bad lol And it isn't even that diverse, I just stated two examples that already exist in the game
---
&gt;
---
Yes and slayer already has a lot content and rewards. +1 for fossil island boss.
---
Meh, tried and tested idea for content that has worked well in the past vs. tried before content that turned out poorly received. I know which I'd prefer.
---
Except it requires the bot to have millions of gp in supplies, which will be gone when it's banned so you're more likely to lose money.
---
400m to spend and you have a glory? And mystic? Bruh return the account
---
The supply would be so limited that it actually agrees with what I’m saying.
---
TBh if sire went right from one phase to another without walking and taking it's sweet ass time I think it would be an enjoyable boss, but I'm never going back regardless. 277 kc, 1 unsired, pet...
---
Holy fuck that is disgustingly racist man
---
Generalising all white people to be nerds that play computer games?
---
Denying any person of colour the right to indentify and conform into the runescape family?
---
How is barring everyone but one race (which actually many different DNA histories claim to be) the right to use a word not racist??
---
Why
---
Stop logging into Aussie worlds lol. This is standard conversation (especially for fally).
---
I would really appreciate that! My rsn: Pure Dark
---
I’ve been grinding barrows to keep up with a bond and when I get enough then I grind pest control. I’m going for full void with a trident and blowpipe for barrows! I really enjoy the minigame and have had super good luck so far! Especially only being able to play about an hour a day on mobile for the next couple weeks!
---
US evenings and weekends are the worst I’ve noticed. Never really run into anyone if I go at a random time during the day on like a Thursday tho
---
Do you remember where you were when the world stood still?

I remember.

---
I checked the wiki regarding this, but the wording seemed a bit convoluted. Is it possible to have more than one upgraded Ivan’s staff?
---
Yes.
---
Void would be 10-20m, elite void 25m+ and pets would be well over 100m.
---
Keep doing your birdhouse runs and farming contracts my dude and you’ll get the seed
---
It is actually a really good idea.
---
Did Dag kings as a slayer task.
---
Enjoyed it a lot.
---
Saw if I did fremmy elites I’d get noted bones.
---
Spent days grinding 65-77 RC, as well as the other skills needed.
---
Spent way too long boosting for double astrals.
---
Haven’t had a dag task in almost three weeks from Duradel.
---
Reminds me of winning a game of solitaire
---
Imagine not flexing on people with 2 mutas cuz u can’t spend 4.5m
---
&gt; Can you imagine how much data that would be?
---
Barely any data. Couple bytes (timestamp, player ids) recorded every time 2 people see each other in the wilderness. Keep all the data for 15-30 minutes and purge it afterwards. When someone gets actually pked pull list of characters that saw them in that 15-30 minutes and record that for longer time, maybe couple months.
---
Even in some crazy scenario that everyone in the current world decided to head to the wilderness and watch this guy died the record will be a couple kilobytes per player kill. In reality it will be a tiny fraction of that. You could have millions of player kills recorded and still the amount of data used would be counted in megabytes.
---
BH world doesn't have a long enough timer. People will tb you on an alt, stand under then log in on their main in max gear...all before you can even log out. Not to mention random people teleporting to you and pjing you mid fight? No...nothing like BH worlds LMFAO

Dependant on your laptop you might need to enter the bios during startup. My old HP laptop needed this to change whether I needed to use the FN key to use functions. Try to flip the setting and see what happens.

I didn't even know this as an active RS3 player lol (I guess that shows how dead the wilderness is)
---
The product of an absolute genius
---
I mean I think it’s fair to have some kind of rule: when something comes within 1% of passing it can be re polled, but only once. If it fails again it’s done forever
---
"huge target on your back?"
---
But you want other people to be a target for you?
---
The price difference for Ahrims is due to the big defensive increase over Mystic and extra magical bonuses. So I'd say it's worth the cost to use.
---
Even the extra magic defence bonus from Kharil's could save you. They found reason to nerf the small bonus of the Bulwark.
---
pretty sure you can't get more than one Iban's staff full stop
---
Mobile pet drops are dope
---
That's not too bad yet, you're only over 7 times the drop rate which isn't unheard of. It's a bit of a disservice to complain so soon don't you think, folks have gone a lot dryer. Perhaps over 10x the rate might warrant a bit of pouting and even then it's pushing it. 
---
Remember that no drop is guaranteed and you may NEVER get the drop.
---
Lmao, time and place...
---
Hoping 80-85 slayer will get me there hahah
---
So what do the people (like me, sorry...) do when I already have a tanz and magma helmet fully created? Can we combine the two helmets? Can I take the paint job off and apply it to the combo helm?  I love this idea, cause now I don't need 2 stacks of zul scales too...
---
same
---
Pathetic.
---
MR MOSOL REI GET DOWN
---
Well yeah, he's not a pker. The people crying about scummy clans and asking for 1 minute pj timers aren't interested in actually pking, they just want to be safer in wildy while pvming or skilling.

That's fair, and definitely true. Most of the content that's released nowadays is geared towards end-game. The elite of the community definitely have a bullhorn behind their opinion. Sorry to hear that it's not the same, the community is definitely different.

Thanks for the insight! have a good one man

Yeah, I don't disagree. I was just saying that was why it's so widely 'hated' (I think it's mostly internet meming) because most people's first interaction with it is with aging legacy PHP..
---
Lol I have been the past couple weeks keep forgetting but cba training it
---
Same bosses as normal (vampire Slayer, tree gnome village, depths of despair, mountain daughter, fight arena). 
---
Main difference if going for points is you'll stick to hard rumble. Use super combats over overloads, and just afk for 10mind at a time, repot, rockcake/locator orb, top off absorbs.

Hey guys, I'm trying to afk nightmare zone while I'm in class, but using the mobile app keeps dcing me because I don't have a stable connection on my campus.

I think nostalgia is what keeps a huge chunk of players even playing.

Everyone gets smacked in the beginning, just keep practicing! You got this

Remember Me
---
Because pvp is the only thing other than inferno and solo raid content that requires any amount of skill or practice. Id have to say the only way this gets passed is if it only can be used outside pvp like the spec orb being able to be clicked on.
---
Not sure, but I would think the Wiki would update their info to be accurate, if that were the case...
---
Tech talk: Anything that renders to a buffer is capable of bugging out like this. This is the default behavior of a graphics application, as you have to tell it when you want to clear the buffer. Something is failing to do so (hung up) so it's just adding and adding to the same buffer. You'll often see this in games when you exit the map and float around outside. The "outside" often has no "clear flags" and therefore usually doesn't have its buffer cleared.

Please tell me more about these _comprenehsive innovative ways_

Probably people looking for better pay, there was talk of sub standard pay. Jagex office look really neat tho.

Reminds me of the maze random
---
🤔
---
I’ve been pking at lava maze every day for more than 6 months at this point and all I can say is so what just hop worlds and don’t fight them. It’s the wild,there are no rules, it’s not too much work to move my right hand and click a few more times to avoid such a small annoyance.
---
For your next task design a cunt.
---
It's two rolls per kill. 3811 kills = 7622 rolls on a 1/1024 drop.
---
It's worth it. Useful at a few places.
---
Get 100 combat first so you can use the highest level boat.

Hmmm?

Aren't you worried about technically about revealing account creation date?

u dont need to switch ur bp attack style just fyi. u can cast a low lvl shadow spell on him to wake him up from like a mile away.

I’ll add you as soon as I get chance to hop on again, only just saw your reply
---
I thought i made that mistake too, however you have to open the casket in order to get a mimic casket i believe.
---
it was just a shitty joke man dont worry aobut
---
Other comment is correct, but not what was polled. When Vorkath launches the spawn, it becomes invincible but you continue attacking. The poll was to have it cancel your auto-attack when Vorkath launches the spawn, like how Demonic Gorillas do when they change protection prayers.

Never forgetti

It’s so simple, just reduce the enemy hp to 0 while keeping yours above 1, it’s that easy!
---
I'd think its better than green d'hide, but not significantly better than blue/red I wouldn't think. 
---
Its main use is bossing (both raids, zulrah) where it minimises gear switches between different phases/bosses. It's also a elite diary task to wear a complete void set, if the completionist in you is so inclined.
---
"rag" gear is usually most effective in terms of price, black d'hide being amazing example
---
Do u play 3 hours a week

The issue is that you're throwing away a huge QOL enhancement for everyone (one that they even included by default on mobile) because some PVPers wanted their opponents to misclick sometimes.

I've been playing fishing trawler for well over 10 hours and have pieces (just bad luck i know). I've met active speaking people there and all they do is complain about the minigame. The rewards (fish) are bad, the exp/hr is about 4-5k and the minigame is stale and boring. It doesn't matter if the net is out or not if you just spamclick the fix in the last minute. Would it be possible to change the minigame a bit? Either make it fun or more rewarding. I thought maybe do something with the fish caught and make an efficient team get rewarded more? I suggest maybe give a team with 1500 fish caught 2 rolls on the droptable and make the fishing pieces 1 in 10 instead of 1 in 8. This punishes afk trawler and rewards active trawler teams.
---
People don't train combat in wilderness(outside slayer). All the ideas you said would get abused and there's no way to make cheating impossible.

What did the jaw sell for?

That's because it too is a circle

600k scales btw

I would attack them. If they said HCIM. i would tell them to drop everything if they want to live. but that just me being merciful.

Is there any plan to increase bank space again? It's been almost 5 gears since the last upgrade with more and more items coming into the game.

Wellytosser, wanted wellywanger but no luck sadly!
---
After the buff to them some people just avoid them, keeps the price high.

---
The supply definitely wouldn't be that limited though lol. There are a few thousand accounts with infernals- if they were 20m than literally every single person would just start farming inferno lol. The supply would be way way way way bigger than you're envisioning because, again, you are romanticizing the difficulty of the inferno (for people who have already figured out how to beat it, and there are many of us at this point).
---
?
---
I agree it should be buffed. It was clear it would be dead content immediately when they designed it, I'm not sure why they went through with it.
---
The only thing I'm not really a fan of is your purposed change. I think it will still be dead if it's just a degradable version of an acb with less defense.
---
This is not an unpopular opinion
---
What I’ve noticed, agility skill is similar to the version of agility we have on the PC client. Mostly you click an obstacle and get xp.
---
Ok, still a couple of fun nights out or a good chunk of rent...  I don't RWT so I don't know the current prices, but OP said hes broke irl so that's what I'd do...
---
the game was designed the way it is b/c it was made with the technical limitations prevalent at its time of creation in mind, lol. let's not pretend that the Gowers wouldn't have done things drastically differently if they'd started making rs, say, 10 years later.
---
void range is worth it. it's good at vorkath which i assume you will use in the future
---
Why would he list all the pets he doesn't have when it's much shorter to list the ones he does have
---
xp rates will have gone up drastically by 2 years time at the current rate we've been getting updates so most likely yes
---
650+ vorkath kills and no unique yet. fml.
---
I joined in 2006
---
So what happens is youre hopping worlds looking for someone to fight while in single combat. Either a clan or scouting bot that every clan has sees you and tells the whole team you're there and what you're risking.
---
One person will show up and fight you for a bit until they start getting their ass kicked because they're a singles team pker and cant pk for shit. Then they will bring their team in to take over for them. When the combat timer runs out one of the team members will teleblock, barrage, or spec you. Then they will stop attacking and someone else will spec you then and then they stop and the someone dumps their spec on you again until you're dead or manage to get out of the wilderness.
---
Unless you get a lucky AGS maul combo you pretty much have no chance of killing any of them while you just get specced over and over again.
---
OP calls out people like Abyss because he runs around in max gear in singles but with 20 people following him and the second he drinks his 2nd brew dose he teleports out and let's his team just drop specs on whoever he was fighting.
---
Maybe the clue was in his inventory, thats why he didn't get more.
---
I do! Just on my ironman btw.
---
Congrats bro!
---
no on the membership side
---
Sip some fight milk for a boost.
---
Lol id do the same because its a win-win for both. Hcim still keep 3/4 items. Hcim gets to stay alive but hes also risking his acc based on trust.
---
Well with something like slayer by the time you hit 99 you’ll be well passed 99 str, the poison is only going to slightly lessen xp/h for str but it’ll also slightly increase slayer xp/h and I’d take that trade off any day, I could be wrong though
---
Same reason why level 60 rogues will sit at the graveyard of a level 20 area in wow. Just to grief you.
---
For those curious, this is February 7th, 2002. Weird to think 9/11 just happened a few months prior!
---
Well, for one, RS2 is what OSRS is based off of, so you're already factually wrong.
---
For two, you can have played RS2 when you were 12. I did. It just requires being born a little earlier. Like are you actually retarded or are you just young enough that you couldn't play RS2 at 12? No, even then, you'd still have to be retarded.
---
I've logged out mid cave while on task. Did you only press the log out once and then complete the round then log out again?
---
unpopular opinion: [popular opinion]
---
yup, its really heavy
---
ah shit i've been found out
---
I never cared for that, picking bananas like a true labor worker is the only way. Stimulate his business of banana salesman while making minimum wage. It ain't much but its honest work
---
I was just joking lol, some didn’t realize :(
---
smh, dude doesnt even have combat boots.  downvoted bc noob
---
J1mmy stealing my girl Astrid
---
Lol Vagina Fluffer, age 31
---
You joke but given the information on that screen it can be determined who he is.  
---
  
---
Just some information I gleaned:   
---
Name starts with N.  
---
His HP level, prayer level, defense level, ranged level, and total XP.  
---
His number of elites completed. 
---
Using this it wouldn't be hard to narrow it down to who it is.
---
Ok I added you so hopefully we can cross paths in game!
---
oww like that that, but i more mean most times then ppl understand and give u luck xd.   but good luck on the hunt
---
Just ban all third party clients from use, it’s bad for the game
---
This image has been edited. 
---
It’s supposed to be 90 mage vs 99 mage. 
---
Not sure if it still stands for mystic vs aug, as I can’t run it through a DPS calc at this time. But the above image is true for 90 vs 99 mage and the image was created based on 90 vs 99 mage - not pray vs pray.
---
Maybe that's just the difference between me and PvPers. I just don't see RS as a reactionary, skill-based game, especially since I grew up on RSC. It's probably why I spend my game time leveling skills or questing or whatever. PvP's focus on precision just feels out of place to me (tbh I feel the same about high-level bosses), and while it's easy to avoid and I just don't partake, it just feels so strange to me when Jagex says something like, "Hey, we're thinking about resizing the UI to make spells a little easier to click," and PvPers get upset at that.
---
To me, that feels like such an obvious, innocuous change to make, but I guess I just see this game differently and I can't really understand the opposite perspective.
---
Thanks for the actual discussion, btw. Usually a conversation like this just turns into "LOL SALTY PVM NOOB SIT KID" versus "HURR SALAD ROBES STEALING SPADES" and that just widens the gap.
---
Also assuming the money making method doesn't involve using multiple accounts to change the outcome of a multiplayer minigame.
---
We're a part of history bois
---
Very nice!
---
75% is such a stupid high threshold
---
Let us Prestige!
---
They can't, but they want to scare players away from using them.
---
Good
---
And yet we have people with 200m on all skills
---
Lol you edited this picture. Original pic says 90 magic vs 99 magic. Also misspelled mystic.
---
I mean all it takes is one person to map out tiles so overlays can be done client-side, right?
---
&gt;We want to put you at ease.
---
I'm so "at ease" right clicking every bank since a QoL menu entry swapper was banned.
---
Bloods.
---
monkaS
---
Polls also voted down the entangle change multiple times but Jagex went ahead and did it anyways. Kinda undermines the position that just because something was polled and failed that it shouldn’t be accessible. Once they went against their poll system they can’t justify the poll system as a reason to remove 3PCs without talking out of both sides of their mouth.
---
Yea I wouldn't do that buddy there's typically a reason a plug in gets removed usually for giving a unfair advantage ex: demonic gorilla plug in zulrah/jad helper
---
Seems great to me as I use none of those and would probably consider them unfair. But I am curious, what exactly does this mean?
---
"Removes dead NPC entities or the minimenu options from them"
---
did you speak to oziach?
---
No. Whole system
---
Yes, he is free to be a complete asshole indeed. Everyone is at any time. Yet not a lot of people do it. His sentence was perfectly readable, but he still felt like he needed to make himself feel better than him. He doesnt use punctuation, thats a universal language that he can't even use properly, yet he feels good by belittling people just because their second/third language is not perfect.
---
That was classed as a combat change though
---
Dead game lmfao
---
Is the tile marker change for all tile markers, such as the ones used in the inferno and COX?
---
&gt;as it always has
---
As someone who has played since Classic where BiS gear was just full rune and a mage staff, it definitely did not always have the level of skill and precision modern PvP/PvM seems to require.
---
But if you don't like other games like League or Overwatch, my question would be: What *don't* you like about those other games are openly based on mechanics like click accuracy and quick decision making? From my perspective, the things people claim to want about PvP are things that other games already do 100x better, and it feels so weird to me that they dig in their heels on OSRS as a game that should require these mechanics. I honestly just don't get how Runescape is the game that should be satisfying this need.
---
I don’t really care to have a discussion on which plugins I’m looking to save just curious on if/how to do it.
---
Just came from RS3, you can't one click bankers here??? Sounds super tedious
---
&gt; There are some features that we can't detect right now, but work is underway on improving our detection capabilities. That's why we're telling you as early as possible.
---
Maybe you should consider polling what to work on in regards to enforcement. More people want bots to be handled more swiftly than want someone fighting a boss with a little navigation assistance to be punished.
---
Tile marking is an illegal feature since you can use it to mark where to stand or not stand at bosses lul.
---
I don’t think this puts me at ease, it makes me feel the opposite. I don’t even know what changes I have on runelite that are different to vanilla and I’m not trying to get banned. Some things that are default on runelite that I was surprised to find out isn’t a vanilla feature. Try fixing your own client if you want to put us at ease.
---
And use the default client?
---
Yes it's open source, just download the source code.
---
Just ban 3rd party clients altogether. Much much easier. And necessary.
---
Don't worry guys, They can only detect it if your a streamer. Atleast we have found one negative benefit to being a streamer with your account now!
---
Yeah, personally I don't think the players made the right decision about certain QoL stuff - but everyone needs to respect those results, unless revoked
---
I actually like the idea of prestiging.
---
Toxic trident, ring of suffering for zulrah and other content, tormented bracelet, imbue all the rings you have including the suffering
---
It literally says that's only banned in a pvm scenario.
---
One of my friends is colorblind and it helped him alot. Some of these plugins shouldnt be bannable
---
And then when you get there you realize it's actually not as fun as you thought it would be so you ser an entirely different goal? Yeah.
---
🦀🦀🦀sass🦀🦀🦀
---
Just click the stand and not the person 5head
---
fucking snitch lmfao
---
You can do the pickpocket swap through runescape itself by turning off attack options
---
When they were farmable, that was the trend. 
---
Now it takes so long to kill the basilisks and takes so long to get the drop, that you’re far better off with just about any 500k/hr+ gold making method than you are trying to get lucky at basilisks. 
---
Jagex did this on purpose — more people would cry over the BIS helm being 1-2m than currently, where everyone’s forgotten their outrage over the ridiculous buffs basilisks got... straight up because everyone besides ironmen stopped going to basilisks lol.
---
Overall I'm in favor of this but a few things really concern me:
---
&gt;Informs you where or where not to stand in a boss fight
---
Does this include static tile markers players have to set for themselves? 
---
&gt;Indicates multicombat zone boundaries
---
Really? Really? Really? You better do something in the vanilla client that makes it clearer then.
---
&gt;Reorders or removes player-based options, such as ‘Trade with’
---
Fine, then remove it by default if trade is off.
---
Is that just the code available on github?
---
Nice i got to 86 before moving on to other skills
---
TBH, and I know pkers are gonna hate this (even though I pk) but I've always hated multi-way combat. OSRS doesn't have any support roles that can be played, making mutlicombat literally just a slugfest. With damage output capabilities too, it makes it literally impossible to counter.
---
If I'm reading correctly, having red/blue/green outline around a piece of gear is still allowed, and changing shift-click options on non-equipment is allowed too (like setting it to Guzzle for rock cake), right?
---
Just run into wildy with your whole bank and you'll be feeling wholr again :o)
---
If you start farming that number would go down.
---
Im on about for remote access...
---
Where does menu entity swapper come into play for PvM?
---
thank you!
---
No. I’m lv 28 and no. I don’t think that I’m a noob
---
I'm wondering about this too - also in regards to this rule:
---
&gt; Anything that indicates where to stand, or not to stand.
---
I personally use tile markers for other things than this too, which wouldn't be illegal by any of the mentioned rules, and it would be a shame if that wouldn't be possible either.
---
You say pickpocket and talk to options cannot be changed, Why is this? You can already change attack and pick pocket with the default client, which is essentially the same thing as changing talk to a pickpocket. No one is going to want to pick pocket HAM members for clues now which is just a pointless nerf.
---
Osrs was released in 2013 and every started on a fresh account. If you stopped in 2012 you never played osrs.
---
How do you plan on enforcing these, especially with entire clans using clients/modifications to PvP easier?
---
you can left click booths and chests by default? lol
---
But that's where I'm confused, are any of them really *useful*? I haven't looked up specific stats, buy nobody talks about any of them as BIS for anything, so I'm guessing they're all beaten by something cheaper.
---
If you sincerely think that blackjack menu swapper is okay, then you need to seriously reconsider your position.
---
Google auth is different from Jagex auth. Having email access is not enough to turn it off.
---
Go to the main page to download it and download the source code. may want to look up how to compile it to make your own client and what not, it's not super complex.
---
But really though
---
I'm new to these 3rd party client things. So if this seems stupid or obvious excuse me. But if I have one of these banned things on without knowing will I get banned? Because I don't know what does what and what I should and shouldn't have. What's a good way to know what to do without going through everything and seeing if they're banned?
---
It's an enemy in legend of zelda
---
This post should be pinned. Most important post of 2019

---
Regarding tile markers, is it talking about auto-generated tile markers from the client or player placed tile markers?
---
I know you’re just playing messenger but this one goes out to all the mods. Go fuck yourselves. Menu swapper should already be in the game.
---
I find it so weird how Prayer reordering is banned - it was polled for the vanilla client, Jagex intended to add it, but it failed the poll.
---
Now its not allowed on a 3rd party client?
---
Is it really that hard to right click a banker or leprechaun?
---
'Osrs SoA' friends chat
---
lmaooooo byeee it was nice playing this game all I did was play LMS now that experienced is not going to be fun. Have fun every1 byebye
---
Slowpoke bro.
---
We could, but doesn't seem like we can after this restriction.
---
You can still left click the bank stand, but if you click the banker you "Talk to" which is lame.
---
I hear you, I agree Jagex did the wrong thing catering to a loud minority in that case. 
---
But it's still not a reason for 3PC users to circumvent a poll result for unfair advantages like that
---
So the additional menu options that send a request to the server... this does mean no more examining items to check their GE value, right(super annoying to use the ingame interface which isn't available in combat, interrupts actions, requires it to be in inventory, and will additionally reorganize your inventory)? Also no more "lookup" option on players (not a big deal, but was always interesting)
---
And the automatic tile markers seem to include the tile markers for dropped item the way this is written?
---
Should of just left it alone - while it wasn't a problem. You've managed to  make 3pc's a problem now... Should of fixed Vanilla first.
---
took me 9581 kc gl, but fullscreen bruh cmon
---
It's open source. People will just use a fork that hasn't removed the plugins.
---
How about not having such a huge focus on reporting people for left click banking and having tiles marked? What's wrong with you that you get a big enough rush to cum in your panties whenever you report someone for that?
---
Ughhhhhh.... what?
---
Have you not realized after 6 years that it does not matter what the poll is about.  
---
**\~** 40% votes yes to literally everything. 
---
And also 
---
I guess your right, the amount of noobs playing this game is insane
---
Keep in mind the upgrade costs though. The planks alone were 29m and then upgrades for the boxes/mounted amulets/nexus/pool/occult altar put my total closer to 45m.
---
Source: I blew all my money on this stuff just this past weekend because demonic gorillas were annoying to kill without an ornate pool.
---
Amazing now that everything is built though :)
---
lmfao its a fkin joke
---
How big is the point difference an hour? That time could be used for better things, like Runecrafting.
---
We’ve been over this. Why you feel the need to have the same conversation in two different comments is baffling to me but here we go. Like I said, I guess you need to feel superior to me in a video game? Idk maybe you need that today so here, I am terrible at Pking. Ansolutely horrible. Straight whale. You’d “sit” me all over the wild. I wouldn’t even be able to get a bolt in. 
---
Now that your ego is stroked, I’m not comparing the two things I’m contrasting. Both are plugins. One is a PvM plug-in, the other is a pure plugin. The PvM plugin is allowed to stay. The pure plug in is not. That’s my point. That’s it.
---
Making the game easier usually does pass. Why should the game have ToB plugins. Jagex spent time designing ToB to be challenging. Shouldn't have ToB plugins that remove some layers of difficulty. Want easy? - Kill giant mole.
---
No bueno
---
Lmao congratulations sir, you win runescape
---
Read better
---
I wish Jagex would just buy one of RuneLite or OSbuddy so we could be done with this shit and they could just remove what they don't want.
---
Apparently I've been missing some super easy Barrows plugins cuz the only ones I have are the mound markers and the door puzzle. Both of which aren't even needed after maybe 10 runs since they never change and you can always just look at wiki page......so many things they've listed don't change the game at all for me.
---
Playing RuneScape on my computer without runelite is awful. It's hogs the CPU and none of the resolution scaling options make it useable
---
I've been using vanilla client for the last month after coming back from years of not playing. What's so bad about the vanilla client?
---
That’s a pretty bad google translate job
---
jesus christ jagex needs to nerf this moneymaker. You killed 184 in less than half an hour. We should make them spawn mini-jads as you fight them which also spawn healers and can hit up to 27 with high accuracy using different combat styles!
---
This guy is a sham. If you really need that good stuff I sell kebabs in 420:)
---
The fact that they made it so you can't one click a bank anymore is fucking ridiculous. What advantage does it give to not click twice?
---
Couple IDs? How many people do you think you see logging into the GE for 1 second? 25? That would be 50 entries right there, for one player, on one world, in 1 second. How would you determine "suspicious accounts" if it's determined by the data thats only tracked for "suspicious accounts"
---
That's going to be a fuck off from me dawg.
---
How many times have you been PKed?
---
Yeah I have to imagine since getting mad over a video game is pretty stupid. I guess discussing something makes me “mad”. Juvenile.
---
You must train young one. Usually do 1 every hour or so. Play about 5 hours at a time. I watch tv while I play so that’s what keeps me awake during runecrafting at least. If I’m slaying I’ll turn the tv off and be fine.
---
Indeed, a job well done, king.
---
Removing bots is not a “balancing” change.
---
Amazing news! Thanks for sharing!

---
I mean 75 range is pretty rough, you have literally the minimum to wield blowpipe lol. It's doable if you have bgs but you will probably be like 50/50 on whether or not you can get a kill even with good specs. No bgs, don't bother.
---
I only use official client, and I agree with some of your points, but also think you're taking some of it too far.
---
Yes, having timers on dropped items or knowing when a boss will be spawning next makes sense. There is no use in not adding that say, into the official client. It only helps players and isn't harming what they want players to do. 
---
But allowing things like prayer timers or indicators saying when to pray what, or knowing where imps are in puro puro, etc, go against what they are trying to do. They want players to die if they get prayer switches wrong or because they don't know what to pray. That's what pvm is, learn what to do or don't get the reward.
---
Just because another game allows stuff and this doesn't, doesn't mean it needs to change. Different games are meant to be played differently. If it's an issue for a player, the solution is as simple as playing the better game. Not saying that you shouldn't be allowed to complain, but you should also understand the difference in games and how the developer wants it to be played. 
---
Good example is raids 1. It's pretty obvious that cox wasnt meant to be played with already knowing what rooms will be there and preparing for them before hand. It's easier for players to know, yes, but it's meant to be a randomly generated area. If you want consistency, raids 2 is more what you want and something they already made. 
---
Jagex have stated that they are definitely looking into working to improve the official client, which is amazing.
---
Do some updating to the vanilla client and maybe people won't use 3rd party clients as much
---
Bro you'll get banned for using all those illegal third-party client features, lets hope no pmod will see this post
---
They get more dps cuz their client does inferno for them. So less chance of mvp and they get more dps in wildy so harder for me to win.
---
New Halloween update lookin good
---
Hey, stop making sense, I'm trying to collect downvotes here
---
We can’t .
---
So, do you have an infernal cape?
---
There is nothing default about menu swapping. It’s a fundamental change to how the game is played and how the players interact with the world.
---
fuck this shit, we pay we gay jagex, add my plugins back reee
---
As long as it is not on an entity in a boss area, not on an equipped item, and does not add a new entry that causes an action to be sent to a server, then menu entry swaps are still allowed. So yes all of these things are fine.  
---
&gt; Also is it okay to have a plug in that lets you see where you clicked?  
---
As it does not indicate where or where not to stand, yes it is allowed even in boss areas.
---
So many players have seemingly never played another game in their life, thus they confuse navigating an antiquated and poor UI with actual gameplay
---
Just Rwt bank nice try
---
ugh...and my mimic's just add like 30 fucking blood runes 
---
=( that's hella sweet though man! I know how good it feels to get such a large sum of money at once lol. Just don't go stake, IF you do get rich then you'll have everything you want/need/can get and be bored and end up just staking more. Sadly I did this and lost my 3.5b+ bank and still in "rebuild" mode (210m ish+) which is super rough going to that from max BiS everything lol ==p

Why ban things you cannot possibly detect? A rule that cannot possibly be enforced is a bad rule. It just punishes fair players and rewards cheaters.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Of these new rules, the vast majority of them cannot possibly be detected. Without some sort of screen reading which is not currently part of the applet you have absolutely no possible way to detect any purely visual plugin that does not interact with the game server.

Jagex acting like banning runelite will stop people from using it . I know i sure as hell won't lol.

Don’t follow him because he’s not a serious contender, but as far as I do know, his social policies are way too radical, especially given then rate of immigration. UBI is probably just completely untenable under any circumstance at the present moment, though I do recognize the necessity of something to protect automation from being exploited.
---
It's just annoying
---
Well all I see are downvotes here. You may have included good and reasonable things that have potential for being banned, but things like timers and prayer reorders? How do you even start to ban players for something as simple as that? There is already spell filtering, why would you not allow prayer reordering?  I main a zerker account and reordering the prayers is essential for me to pk with (being used to a certain order) and when you switch to a main the prayers are in vastly different areas. It would be extremely hard to get used to both settings as opposed to keeping it switched to one. 
---
Whether or not I can get banned, you can bet your touché I’ll be using these SIMPLIFIED non-gamebreaking tools.
---
Give it a shot! It’s more about having a good handle of the mechanics of the fight. Ruby bolts specs will be important, too.
---
Runescape is the only game I've ever played that allow third party clients.
---
I find that playing on the vanilla client without a bunch of these QOL features you're disallowing to be more effort than this game is worth.
---
I'll play out the rest of my sub, but after that I'm done unless this situation improves.

---
Thank you. This sounds like a big yikes from flamjex. Though, I have faith in the dev team that they plan to work with the community on a solution.
---
Yeah, as a color blind player I'm never gonna kill Demonic Gorillas again or Cerb
---
Bet this will cause item pieces to increase in price because it won’t be as easy anymore.
---
winter 2017
---
Also if ur afking it and u miss drinking overload you will take dmg and die very quick, with this you get more time to afk
---
Base 90s then max
---
Menu Entity Swapper. It wasn't specifically banned, only a few parts.
---
Is using scouts not allowed?
---
Love it!
---
Just use runelite mate I'm sure all of the banned plugins have been removed so theres no need to worry
---
yep
---
Not that I do what OP is asking to do, but you know Jagex literally can't detect these screen marker plugins right? He's not at risk
---
Yeah fuck handicapped people, they should learn adapt
---
If clicking once every 5minutes to repot is too much, the sure, use supercombats. But there’s literally no reason not to use overloads by comparison.
---
Also, may be off-topic, the you get more xp/hr in hard rumble compared to normal since NPC defense level remains the same, however the gain more gp so less over hitting
---
Zmi is faster and pretty chill. You'll probably be the only person to ever do this.
---
Oda is genuinely a hilarious guy.
---
Bunch of haters in this sub.
---
Hey, just a heads up, this is pretty much how TERA NA Publisher Bluehole Studio absolutely killed it's game.
---
There was a similar 3rd party client for the game for players that was mostly used for lower ping/dps calculators. Bluehole did not like this so they banned the client. A majority of the game outright quit, because the lag in the game is unbearable without the client, and it has been since day one. The game is pretty much on its last legs right now, probably going to shut down soon.
---
I am going to continue using these clients, and if you actually start banning people for this, I guarantee you that a large portion of the community will quit. You simply can't ween off people as a majority of the player base has literally ONLY played the game on 3rd party clients. Telling us to immediately stop using 3rd party clients like this without providing a non-garbage vanilla client is a direct slap to the face, along with your account security and "customer support system". It's ironic there are still mining bots with 100m+ XP unbanned, but you take such a strong stance on some menu-entry swaps and one-click construction. Really?
---
It's a roll based game. You cant just load the dice because you havent gotten lucky at a specific piece of content.
---
But you can see what color they are, which is the entirety of the ghost instead of a tiny difference in character model.
---
Ya I’ll do the same thing hahaha
---
When should I unlock boss tasks? I'm roughly base 80s combat, save for prayer. I'm interested in it, but I'm nervous I'll have to skip a bunch or will just bring down my average xp/gold from doing them slowly.
---
Same. Proof: lowest skills are both lvl 67.
---
So i'm new to playing osrs and everybody i talked to says to use Runelite client. I made a account and started playing a lot over 2-3 days but when i logged in on the 4th day i got a 48 hour ban. It says i was banned for Bot busting moderate, so was it because i was using runelite? The only other thing i could think of is that i use a touchscreen for almost all of my clicks due to me being a C6 quadriplegic with no hand function. If anybody has any ideas i would appreciate it very much.
---
I suggest you use all the security features avalable then you should be relatively safe e.g. put authenticator on your account *and* your email address (changing your email address is probably a good idea too)
---
&gt; Instead, the drop rate of pets should slowly and gradually increase, **starting at or around their drop rate**
---
That's the important bit, and why I support it. You're not making them *too* much easier to get, because the drop rate only gets buffed for the e^-1 (IIRC) portion of people that go dry more than the drop rate.
---
Botched toe!
---
Change your monitor/settings
---
If you’re fast enough you can even 0 tick bank
---
Like if your that influenced by what people have to say online they would have already done it no need to take any action
---
Your skills lmaooo
---
That's racist
---
Wilderness has a wine of zamarok spawn that spawns every 3 seconds. I telegrabbed over 600 on my Ironman to make ranging pots and never saw a single pker
---
Wait you're not Patrouski
---
Stonks
---
Yasss and i remember when first starting and creating my account they had a skeleton (low quality) and an armored human (high quality), and me being a young scrub i thought you could play as a skeleton...so i picked low quality LMAO. How disappointed i was that i wasn't a skeleton..
---
none, the problem few are already gone in todays update
---
You had me with fuck closed doors
---
ALL MES options are explicitly now against the rules. While it may be under a reference towards a boss, I don't think the following statement has any ambiguity.
---
Removal or swapping of menu entries on **any** entity
---
If hundreds of people are confused they didnt read the blog post that explicitly tells the user what plugins will not be allowed
---
Passed the poll several times, kept getting re-polled until it failed and then was dropped the second it failed by 0.3%.  I have no idea who benefits from the icons not getting resized, but this made filtering worthless on desktop
---
I assume you tried turning the in game brightness settings up? Is the rest of your desktop dark or just osrs? What gpu do you have?
---
Clearly the solution is to forbid worship of Bandos
---
Wow man way to bring a hate symbol into osrs just what we need..
---
/s
---
Tanner, or the herb identifier in Nardah. Or simply Hans.
---
Can you ban plugins that enter your bank pin via numberkeys on your keyboard. This one only decreases your account security and makes you more vulnerable to keyloggers.
---
I don't think it's that ambiguous. Basically, you can't menu entry swap combat options to give you an advantage (they listed a lot of stuff, but that's the gist of it) and outside of combat you can't menu entry swap certain listed scenarios, such as pickpocketing/blackjacking or 1 click teleports on worn jewelry anymore, but everything else is fine.
---
Pssssht casual. Do it with an earth battlestaff.
---
&gt; Indicates which player an NPC is focused on
---
This is a default feature in literally every other successful mmo. Not sure why it's a problem here. 
---
&gt; Indicates multicombat zone boundaries. Indicates whom your opponent's opponent is in PVP
---
It's like you're trying to kill off the wilderness without outright doing it. Making it harder and harder for "prey". 
---
&gt; Modifies the menu options on worn/equipped items
---
Curious what is being abused here? Like one click teleport on skillcapes?
---
Outsider? Any skin colour can be an outsider
---
That's not the issue, it's the client itself that just has a darker brightness for some reason xD
---
Me too. 5,891
---
I will be buying from you sometime next year
---
Any features which aid any boss fights by doing any of the following are prohibited (this includes all Raids sub-bosses, Slayer bosses, Demi-bosses, and wave-based minigames, including the Fight Caves and Inferno):
---
Next attack prediction (timing or attack style)
---
Projectile targets, or target locations, as well as impact locations
---
Prayer switching indicators
---
Attack counters
---
Anything that indicates where to stand, or not to stand
---
Removal or swapping of menu entries on any entity
---
What you're referencing is clearly specifically in reference to bosses.
---
Damn zybez
---
Not that surprising given the only reasonable method of training Runecrafting on a UIM is the Arceuus library to 77 and then bloods to 99. Souls give significantly less GP when sold to Ali Morrisane, 200 ea vs 150 ea, and that adds up a ton on the way to 99. I mean seriously, besides the library there's really no viable way to train RC on a UIM unless I'm unaware of something. I guess there's a way to do Lavas or ZMI if you stockpile noted Pessence, but it would be suuuuuuch a pain in the ass to manage unnoting them in an already pain in the ass skill on a pain in the ass dead game mode for masochists.
---
It means friend?
---
wow... hope your luck turns around :D
---
I get what you mean. Very few players are bound to have bad rng. However I don't think the fic should stop their. There should also be a minimum KC to even have a chance of rolling the pet drop. I don't think having 1KC pets is a good thing either.
---
We’re not fear-mongering but we’ll totally ban you for doing these things that we have no way of detecting. That’s sure to impact the whole playerbase, not just the ones that are going to follow the rules
---
step outside your osrs bubble and try to flex your stats
---
Also, they have bots that do raids, farm zulrah, do barrows.
---
If you put a faster GP collection method they will just write a new script.
---
waited 24 hours didnt work , does it reset the timer everytime I try to disable it?  i need to wait 24 hours again without trying to disable it?
---
My acc is 189 days, I got 25 days game time... I'm addicted
---
seriously. i turned off menu entry swapper the day of the first 3PC blog post and i’ve been fine without it.
---
Not surprising. Since most GE bots and house portal bots are UIM.
---
Menu swapping is still like 90% intact. The only things that are banned are swapping entries to give PvP and bossing advantages (e.g. prioritizing only people not in your clan chat, or swapping attack options are certain NPCs, etc.) or menu swapping certain, specific, things like worn items or blackjacking.
---
???
---
I really really hope your joking
---
I believe I agree with you, but I'm still erring on the side of caution until Jagex or a Mod specifically states that certain menu entry swaps are allowed.  Which, I believe we will get some clarity one way or the other given how much of the conversation today has revolved around this topic.
---
*Facepalm* and there it is. Definitely skipped over reading that
---
Cheers
---
Lmaooooo
---
I hope so. It's not like that QoL stuff is creating an unfair advantage.
---
Being color blind doesn't make you unable to tell the difference between a boulder/ and a spell at demonics.

Fight Milk (4)
---
Ah yis, an item I can relate to by nature.
---
Call it Open Sesame and you might be onto something
---
Use it wisely
---
Boulder isn't the issue, they use ranged and magic
---
I don't know if this is the right place to ask but I was wondering if there were any good youtubers/series for new players to OSRS?
---
lmfao
---
Oh damn that sucks
---
https://runelite.net/blog/show/2019-10-30-1.5.37-Release/ 
---
They already removed all features that would cause the client to not be compliant with the new rules
---
Would the drop party plugin in certain clients fall under this? It marks the tiles of where a selected player has walked.
---
The defence reset is in RS3 for a very specific reason - the switch from 138  combat to 200 combat, then back to 138.  
---
It was VERY complex to implement because if all the linked content that needed to be reset or adjusted (quests and so-on).  
---
I doubt they'll do the same for OSRS.
---
Damn.
---
Banned!
---
Your using cheating clients
---
sorry i dont speak english
---
Sink*
---
Vendelo, el dolar esta se va a 100 Pesos!
---
Just don't come crying to reddit when your account gets banned.
---
you're welcome
---
You say that like it's a bad thing
---
Inb4 people saying you bought bonds at the g/e lol
---
Can we poll 74% to be considered passing?
---
The bank chest unnotes things, no need for an actual banker.
---
Prepare to drop a lot of them! 
---
Easiest way is to buy imps from GE and open them en masse.
---
If it's so easy why change it?
---
I just don't think activities that almost "require" world-hopping are good for the game, as for bots, they need to figure out how to ban them. Its not meant to be best in slot, just an alternative way for people to make money/gather wines.
---
&gt; Just because you have bad rng doesnt mean you should get some kind of crutch.
---
...
---
&gt; The whole point and appeal of pets are that they are very rare drops
---
Two statements I completely disagree with. If you're 10k dry on a 1/2k pet, you should absolutely get a better rate. It's frankly ridiculous to claim the opposite if you have just a little bit of empathy.
---
Furthermore, I don't care whether pets are rare or not, nor do most people. People care that they're ***difficult to get***, which is completely different. Chaos Elemental pet is the most common pet, yet people still go for it right?
---
&gt; With your logic, every single very rare drop should become more likely to get when you reach the drop rate. This makes no sense.
---
Why not? Nobody said the drop rate should double, but would it really be so bad if, for example, Dragon warhammers became slightly easier to get after 5k kc?
---
gotta get that dough somehow
---
My issue is how are they gonna enforce it? They're already having trouble with bots when I can see tons of bots well passed level 99 in skills they're botting and bots made to kill specific monsters.
---
Well done fellow pede
---
people trying to kill children on Halloween smh
---
So jealous right now not gonna lie.
---
What u mean resurrected
---
Yeah I've heard that its good, i just never felt like wine grabbing should be a wildy-related activity though.
---
I mean if youre gonna do that just do it like that in the first place and set slayer requirements higher if the goal is to make it expensive
---
Yep, you can only use the provided arrows. 3rd age bow has highest accuracy, and same attack speed as a shortbow. I guess all it's lacking is a spec like the magic shortbow.
---
Haven’t they already said that daeyalt essence won’t replace any of the current best methods?
---
Idk why he edited it, but it used to say ahrims not mystic
---
...Yes? If 100k males are logged onto OSRS at any given time that means 10k players will have this issue. It's a substantial amount of their playerbase, but also for any population in general. 
---
For instance, for side effects in medication to be considered "common" it must fall between **1** and 10%.
---
Voice your concerns to Jagex Moderators on Twitter.
---
Can someone fix this for the "girlfriend" to be an extra fat 40 year old guy?
---
Meanwhile i see zulrah gold farmers/bots with 100m+ range/magic xp everyday in the same world
---
You can unnote stuff on bank chests or bankbooths, that doesn't matter. The issue with Lavas are the necklaces and dueling rings. Those suck to make on UIM and you cant note them for later use.
---
They won't catch anyone, out side of streamers. You're only hindering yourself. But I respect your decision.
---
It's still like, 15 frames per tick I guess. If you're staring blankly at NMZ it doesn't really matter.
---
If someone didnt post a beginner clue every week, I'd definitely forget that the 2 minute 3 step clues dropped useless stuff
---
1. I'm not trying to make you feel bad
---
2. If I (a random redditor on a 2007 point and click game forum) am making you feel bad you got worse problems than not being able to see color properly
---
3. I'm gonna guess this comment isn't serious
---
Gz bro 610m is a nice stack
---
Or just enjoy the game
---
Ah cool thanks all - I didn’t know this!
---
&gt; I'm not sure how long 10k kc would take
---
If you're like most people killing Venenatis, upwards of 500 to 1,000 hours. For most people, that's close to a full year of play or more. Doing nothing but efficiently killing the same boss over and over again.
---
Isn't that how most laws are? Police can't possibly enforce every single speeder, etc. So most will get away with it, some will get caught but that doesn't make it unfair
---
I be doing this when Redwood WC'ing
---
Lower the framerate to like 10FPS or lower if I'm on my laptop. The battery savings are insane.
---
"I just want clarity from Jagex on what plug-ins i could be banned for, i just want TRANSPARENCY"
---
\*Jagex delivers exactly what player base complained for\*
---
"I can't use my OP  plug-ins???? Jagex is wrong and I'm just gonna cheat and use them anyway"
---
Gotta love this player base. It was never about transparency for most. It's about me getting what I want and cheating if I have to, regardless of what Jagex has to say about it.
---
They've already added a couple alternate ways to obtain them.
---
Updated kalphite queen drop table for higher level content.
---
Wilderness spawn for lower level content with the option to increase efficiency by completing a diary. 
---
How many must they add to appease you?
---
It genuinely feels like you want me to feel bad, so yeah sure I'm a depressed colorblind dude whatever. You seriously have no empathy
---
FIGGER IT OUT
---
dab
---
This is stupid. You crack down on QoL features but there are still 100m exp bots fishing and mining 24/7. I am never gonna stop using these QoL features, even if I have to find another client after RL caves like you know they will.
---
Fuck me you are a comedian
---
The entire game isnt community driven
---
If you’ve spent enough time on osrs to have 15m rc exp then without a doubt you are the bitch boy.
---
Why should pet drops be changed because you’ve gone dry? I know you’ve probably been placed in ‘special classes’ throughout your life, but you’re not special. You don’t deserve any preferential treatment.
---
Resurrected for Halloween
---
There are tiles that are the limit of where you can walk if you want to trap something behind a wall, though
---
Again, not as useful, but those tiles are hard to differentiate due to the floor art
---
From " Did you even read the post? They were very explicit " to "I know that that line is a bit confusing" in 1 comment
---
Please go watch puggers videos and tell me again how bot detection is the answer.
---
Why shouldn’t there be bad luck protection? Just imagine you yourself going 15k KC dry on Sire pet. You think that would be fair and ok? Fuck no
---
Yeah was gonna say it reads far to neckbeardy when you introduce women into this meme equation.
---
The statement mentions nothing even remotely related to that. Clue scroll helpers are fine.
---
Spam  clicking bones and one click construction isnt quality of life
---
why did I laugh at this? :(
---
Yeah, will be nice for the max cape grind :)
---
i say 50/50
---
Thank goodness. How about manual tile markers? It specifies that anything which can indicate where to stand or where something might spawn is prohibited, but since manual tile markers require the player to place the indicative tile manually, it might be fine.
---
Perfect explanation. Thank you! So is this what happens when RAM or vRAM (idk which) is being maxxed out for whatever reason?
---
Thank you so much for everything. You made my runescape journey bloody amazing. I'm quitting now, but I wanted express my sincere thanks to you and other contributors for providing an open-source alternative to OSB. I cannot express properly how much I enjoyed using Runelite and how much better it made the game. Cheers mate.
---
FWIW on your last point -- the people who play the game a lot and super efficiently DO use these features as well. They may complain that they think it's bad for the game but they do use them.
---
However it's not just fear mongering. They straight up said in this post that they will ban accounts using these features, so if you don't know for certain what is guaranteed undetectable, you're risking your account by using any banned feature. It's not fearmongering when they actually will ban you.
---
How do I alt + 68 if my keyboard only goes up to the number 9
---
The vast majority of people using third party clients don't have to get scared about anything since their client has already been updated to comply with the rules.

When you make both leather chaps and a leather body to complete the clue only to get leather chaps back lmo

This is a joke

I haven't done a Jad task in a while (I wish Konar assigned them), but can't you just look at how big the monster is and go by that?
---
Please stop committing suicide Jagex.
---
&gt; Police can't possibly enforce every single speeder, etc. So most will get away with it, some will get caught but that doesn't make it unfair
---
I never said you have to catch everyone.  
---
Yes, police cannot possibly catch every single speeder, but it is very much possible for them to see a speeder, and enforce the rule.  
---
In the instance of screen markers, Jagex literally cannot detect it.   
---
It would be like if we had laws against speeding but we didn't have any way of measuring speed.
---
Right. The things that aren't pointless are good password security and authenticator on email and rs account. They are permanent.
---
Nice! I've always wanted to wield black chins to
---
A pen
---
I disagree with the premise that hitting drop rate has "earned" you a certain roll on the table.
---
Luck and rng are intertwined and I like it that way.
---
just give us adequate QoL updates and maybe we won't have to use 3rd party clients damnit Jamflex
---
Mimic?
---
Im sure youre a great person, but wife wouldn't like it if I fucked someone else
---
This isn't a balancing change - this is a "what's worse, every raw material in the game being driven into the ground due to bots having 100 m exp, or a guy left clicking birdhouses?" change.
---
Guys, you can make wines of Zamorak...
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Zamorak%27s_grapes
---
IF anything, the cost of these grapes need to go down from 1/10 to like 1/20, or 1/15.
---
Manually marking tiles is fine, the statement refers to plugins that "**automatically** inform you where or where not to stand in a boss fight". Emphasis mine.
---
LOL not everyone treats the game like their second life bro. If i wanna join a clan im not doing fucking due diligence on its leader lmfao
---
Yeah because you probably expect pets to come at low kc. Guessing you’re not even close to drop rate kc on any boss.
---
Well that makes sense since you’re way below the drop rate on all of them
---
In my opinion the spellbook UI isn't bad at all, especially on ancients which is actually the one meant for casting quickly in pvp. The icons aren't any more difficult to click on than pieces of gear in your inventory, so to me it seems that people just want to make an easy thing even easier when there's no actual utility for it unlike on mobile, where it's essentially required. I hate to use the term "easyscape" because it's obnoxiously overused, but this is just what it is, in my opinion. I agree with you that it's annoying that is was repolled three times though. Clearly I'm in the 1/4 minority so it really should have been added already
---
&gt; If you’ve spent enough time on osrs to have 15m rc exp then without a doubt you are the bitch boy.
---
Look at that sudden reversal! First you call me lazy because you assume I didn't go through the effort required, then you call me a bitch because I did. You're a joke.
---
&gt; Why should pet drops be changed because you’ve gone dry? I know you’ve probably been placed in ‘special classes’ throughout your life, but you’re not special. You don’t deserve any preferential treatment.
---
They shouldn't be changed because I, specifically, have gone dry. They should be changed because hundreds of people have gone dry. The math makes it inevitable, which is exactly what I wrote in my original post. Good job not reading it.
---
That was a fucking rollercoaster
---
Usually, every step of the way is a negliable profit (but profit nontheless). Stringing bows is faster xp/hour but a bit less afk compared to fletching the logs. Don't bother alching them, unless you alch whilst doing agility runs (or something similar)
---
Virtual janitor for free. Imagine being a janitor in real life for free. No one would do that, so why do it on a virtual game?
---
There is less than 600 UIMs with over 70 Herblore.
---
Yes but the person identified it/those as his highest skills, which cannot be seen in the screenshot.
---
If I remember correctly, people who play using bonds for membership dont get a free name change every 30 days. I could be completely wrong since I’ve never done bondscape. That’s why it gave you the option to change early since you don’t have the option to change it for free.
---
Ayy. Farming bro. Farming was my first 99 as well.

Yes, this did happen.

Are you on drugs
---
If it were entirely physical, as his is, I would entirely agree with you. However due to an accident earlier in my life, I have some cognitive issues as well. I'm not saying that they should or shouldn't be banned. I'm just saying that I feel like shit for using something that is basically the same thing as Deadly Boss Mods is for WOW.
---
DBM literally says "countdown done in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Move/use your CD...
---
You can continue to use RuneLite since it's already been updated to comply with the rules.
---
At first I was small angry. Then I remembered I got RotG from vetion on 3 kc. So I'm okay
---
We don't know whether they have the capabilities, but I'm just saying that they don't need extra software to run on our computer to be able to deduce these things.. it is already a known fact that the client sends mouse movements to Jagex' servers.
---
Lets look at a simple example: a plugin that tells where the projectiles from some minigame will land. Lets look at the mouse movements/timings/behavior of players using this plugin vs players not using it. Since they are using the plugin, it must, obviously, give an advantage, and that advantage would be able to show itself through the behavior of the players using it (e.g., the mouse hovering over the next tile, a decreased reaction time etc.). All of these features combined would, possibly, be sufficient to be able to accurately deduce whether a player is using the plugin or not.
---
It is not a straightforward task, and who knows what skills the anticheating department has (Jagex is notoriously secret about the people working there). But I would just like to point out that it is not "totally utterly impossible, and that is a fact" as you are claiming.
---
But it's not just my problems, it's potentially everyone's. If you're ok with a minority of people being *much,* ***much*** drier than anyone else for no reason other than the way rng is currently coded, that's your opinion. Just know that it's sadism, no matter how much toxic interactions on the internet have normalized said sadism.
---
M’ lady....
---
Yeah it takes like five minutes, no requirements except for some free inventory space.
---
Spread the wealth bro
---
Tbh, I got the impression that English wasn't their first language so I toned it down a little bit.
---
Jagex has been fucking up bans recently in response to mobile/phone bots. Best part is there are still bots with over 50m xp unbanned yet tons of innocents are being banned.
---
Anything related to skilling(P2P) that is relatively repetitive is hijacked by bots. Things like Air orbs, tele tab making, wood cutting, mining etc. All of these used to be legitimate money makers. But because of 1000's of bots doing this, the gp/hr is negligible.
---
What hunter method?
---
if you don't do scaled raids that's totally normal. unscaled raids are literally not worth the time.
---
Any client that's not complying with this list can be accurately labeled a cheat client. There will always be dedicated rulebreakers willing to risk it, but most players won't. Maybe the cheaters won't get banned, maybe they will. My point is that declaring they are cheating will absolutely result in less usage. If the plugins are bad for the game, then less usage is still a win.
---
Have you tried praying?
---
u can literally just fucking look at bandos and see him moonwalk at u
---
Yes it already passed several times.
---
Damn I didn’t even know. The extents people go to to make bots is crazy and so dumb.
---
Very glad to finished fight caves a few weeks ago cause its going to be months till a break my muscle memory. Fuck, of all things, this is the most annoying.
---
1543 days old account. 29 day 2 hours 25 minutes game time. 1378 total level. Im pretty casual myself.
---
yes
---
Love it. Absolutely adore you for this.
---
I got it for a hard diary requirement the used it for a jad task as a long range weapon. Other than that it’s pretty useless. Shield is good imo
---
For some reason I thinking me voting yes wouldn't do a thing. It might be the whole not getting asked about it first thing
---
"So anyways, I started splashing"
---
go get 200m, it gets easier for you there
---
otherwise, just stop being so upset over it. They're difficult to obtain on purpose
---
There shouldn't be daily resets imo, one of the major things that made rs3 go stale for me was the building up of a list of super efficient dailies. It made logging in every day feel like a chore that you were punished for not doing. Weekly or monthly is much more chill.
---
Maxed pure 1 def here, used vanilla client all the way and not messed up, laughing at the fact you made this post like someone's attacking you.
---
And a huge player in making the game hit that spot, it's exactly the QOL 3pc give to the game.
---
&gt; With your logic the way the mechanism should work is that you can't get the pet 1-2k kc but it's guranteed at 2k.
---
That's not even close to what I've proposed, why do you assume that?? I actually had in mind that if you hit the drop rate, you get something like a 5 or 10% higher chance to get the pet, not a guaranteed pet! WTF?? Is this why everyone has been so hostile?
---
&gt;	Tile marking is way too OP right?
---
I mean, it’s obviously debatable enough to the  point where Jagex feels it’s better off prohibited than allowed.
---
I can't believe how blind you are
---
Why are you even trying to argue something so trivial anyway?
---
You know there is a way to post this opinion without being an asshole.
---
Jagex isnt after clients. They're after plug ins that I previously stated. They domt care if you mark tiles or know how long it is until your anti poison runs out. They care about people getting 1m pray xp/hr
---
I'm referring to integrity changes. Changes that address imbalances within the game.
---
If left up to the player base the game would be nerfed beyond recognition. Most of the player base is going to vote based on what benefits them, even at the expense of the game's longevity and balance.
---
Also, bonds serve a purpose within the game. You should be happy when people pay for one, it allows you to play the game completely free of irl charge.
---
I never said anything about the integrity of the company in question. But some things have to be left to the devs, because the player base will vote selfishly.
---
Way to do something the absolute vast majority of us dont want
---
Hahahahahah people like you are seriously pathetic man. I always wonder what kind of person has these types of “noble causes” on the internet. Especially a video game from when Britney Spears was making music videos on MTV. The fact that you care this much is just plain sad. Let people play the game the way they want. Who cares if a cheater is at a higher position on the arbitrary leaderboards that have absolutely nothing to do with the game experience. You might wanna take a nice long look at yourself in the mirror and re-evaluate your priorities in life. You seem to care a lot about how other people see you. Try enjoying RuneScape, and life for that matter, for the experience. 
---
Gl man. I’ll be waiting for your ree post when you finally release your self worth isn’t tied to how other people view your accomplishments and how you chose to go about obtaining them.
---
73% ACCURATE
---
you mean resurrected!
---
Ur ugly
---
Perfectly put.
---
Now give us the lewd version
---
I misread and thought you said abortion potions.
---
&gt; it is already a known fact that the client sends mouse movements to Jagex' servers.
---
And it does this by tracking your mouse's interaction with the game. That's irrelevant, it cannot see something drawn over the top of the client that does not interact with the game or client in any way whatsoever.   
---
&gt;Lets look at a simple example: a plugin that tells where the projectiles from some minigame will land. Lets look at the mouse movements/timings/behavior of players using this plugin vs players not using it. Since they are using the plugin, it must, obviously, give an advantage, and that advantage would be able to show itself through the behavior of the players using it (e.g., the mouse hovering over the next tile, a decreased reaction time etc.). All of these features combined would, possibly, be sufficient to be able to accurately deduce whether a player is using the plugin or not.
---
This would look no different than a player who is simply good/experienced at the activity.
---
I don't know, I just found it funny that something I thought was somewhat rare was considered common and people REALLY took an issue with it.
---
On the plus side I learned some stuff about colour blindness so it wasn't a complete waste.
---
big YIKES, most of this is just ridiculous...  basically just QoL stuff you don't want us to have cool.  most of this stuff doesn't make the game easy it makes it bearable
---
*knowingly breaking established rules at company-hosted event, but whatever. People see what they want.  Blitzchung expected it and did it anyways. He chose his platform and got punished for it, albeit a bit harshly. Then some of it was taken back.  But no one wants to consider that, and trying to bring an actual discussion to that topic results in people yelling at me that I support China and yada yada. I know what I believe, so you can think what you want and halt productive open-minded conversation.
---
You stated no cons but it does devalue the current price of wine of zammies if they become more accessible / easier to obtain
---
&gt; They're difficult to obtain on purpose
---
That's the problem, they aren't for the majority of people. One of the property of a geometric distribution is that most people will get a pet under the drop rate. That's just how the math works. So all the precious 'pets are supposed to be rare!!1!' arguments by Bob who got a 34 kc mole pet are frankly moot. All this does is prevent extreme bad luck.
---
I’m afraid that’ll be left for the imagination
---
I genuinely don't feel like you had any intention other than to be vitriolic to me. It really hurts man
---
The only feature that's been removed from the menu entry swapper is the pickpocket/talk-to swap.
---
How did you do this?
---
I've finished sire so will be voting no to all
---
I get this honestly, and for example the bird house menu swapper compared to comething like a cerberus helper? Come on jagex, swapping around a menu really isn't going to ruin the game. Making bosses lose their thoughness or need to actually learn anything is what really dumps the game in my opinion.
---
I'm confused why this matters. Didn't Jagex update it so that the game remembers your attack style on weapons so you would never have any issues anyways or am I understanding this wrong?
---
no
---
Neither better customer support nor updating the client are options. Bunk poll.
---
the hit point bubble makes him look like hes crying. poor pepe
---
What am I to do... I can login with my main, but cannot with an F2P alt. Because I cannot switch world, and the default world the program offers me is P2P. LoL :)))
---
Jagex is the most fucking tone deaf company in existence. They just keep fucking up, lmao
---
Hiding attack styles is still fine, the statement mentions "**un**hiding of interface components" which is the opposite of that.
---
I feel like people would be better off learning the content by doing it over and over again, rather than learn it once and then not evolve as a player.
---
I think that the last 5 or so waves for a Fire Cape is a great learning tool for people somewhat new to PVM, it teaches you the importance of prayer, position, who to target first and not to panic too much.  
---
Someone just learning how to safespot without really remembering where or how it worked might miss out on that.
---
Damn, you must have like a 50k bank if you think someone would RWT an abyssal whip. 😂
---
Just turn off most things on Runelite or simply play until they fix it
---
Yeah, even 10% of that would completely change the game for me at this point
---
Could have the dailies be fairly shitty, as in WoW, to diminish the relevance of this advancing sense of duty over play.
---
A.) The creators of the script would just write a solution within the first hour, if that long. 
---
B.) This is what actually killed the game the first time.
---
and then jigglyflex doesn't allow multi line indicator they can literally suck my toes man 汉字ex is so fucking dumb
---
god i can't wait to get banned for afking too hard on mobile, and i really cant wait for free trade to be removed(it went super well last time) brilliant ideas op, move over mod ash there's a new best boy in town
---
Only takes 1 misclick. Left click the defensive style while autocasting barrage, or hit it when flicking through prayers when bridding/bossing.
---
I've been trying to have actual discussions with people, but very few arguments are put forward. The discourse can be summarized by:
---
1. Pets should be rare (fails to acknowledge this would barely affect the rate at which pets enter the game);
---
2. The game shouldn't be changed just because you don't like it (thanks for dismissing my experience);
---
Thanks? Both those arguments fail to address WHY I brought this up in the first place: extreme bad luck sucks! Why wouldn't we prevent it??
---
All garble to trivialize what you're doing. I never said I personally care about ranks, I'm informing you that some people do, and that your choice affects those people.
---
Again, think whatever you have to, downplay it however much you have to. Wrong is wrong is wrong, regardless of whether it's a computer game or not. 
---
Speaking of notions of nobility, you sit in your chair criticizing me for the game I play and how I view it, yet you play the same game I do? You're even willing to go to the lengths of searching out ways of manipulating and bypassing the game's parameters and yet you tell me I need to reassess MY priorities? 
---
The hypocrisy is real.
---
This post is just fear mongering, Jagex can't detect the godwords!
---
I never claimed it was easy? I said that skilled players can click it anyways, so it doesn't negatively affect them. It only positively affects newer players
---
I’m not iron, my bank can’t really afford a blowpipe yet! Especially not the upkeep of scales. I’ve only ever managed to kill Zulrah once, I figure once I can kill them consistently enough, I’ll make enough money that I can buy one, and it’ll just be a QoL upgrade
---
cooking gauntlets i had to wear them ),:
---
Ya I just don't have that much time to play
---
&gt;They are very much detectable. 
---
&gt;Whether Jagex is capable of doing so is then a whole other question.
---
Jagex isn't, so they aren't detectable. You fucking pedants are unbearable, Jesus Christ.
---
Killer Queen has already touched that tile.
---
Reminds me of when Windows XP used to freeze and you could drag around programs so you got this effect. How easily i was entertained back in the days.
---
Switch back to vanilla client for a week, there’s really not many differences in terms of QOL. 
---
Apart from clue helped, left click banker, there’s not really much else that changes it.
---
Would you call trapping a 180 behind a 90 safespotting as well? That's effectively what is done, just reliably, by using Italy rock. It would up the difficulty, sure. I don't see how the marked tile is much different than just strictly staying adjacent to the wall you have the thing trapped behind.
---
Ook ook
---
Wtf is this post?
---
Considering he maxed melees and found his way staking enough to make 500m (definitely need starting capital), he probably bought bonds or gold
---
hey man im not a genius but it specifically says automatically, if youre placing down markers yourself then they dont care. but idk, thats just from me reading
---
also runelite is compliant now so if you can still stand using it and it doesnt make you want to quit the game then maybe you should stop bitching but idk thats just me man whatever
---
oh and btw plenty of people do get unbanned (ive been unbanned twice, they just do it in batches rather than individually)
---
but yeah dude jamflex bad right on brother

RACIST REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Can I have your luck?

Last time I went into wildy for a clue, I got insta d claw specced the moment I levered in.

I think the dude was spam clicking the lever spot below him. Cuz I was hovering over logout, didn’t even have time to react.

I'm a 900 total UIM, level 4 runecrafting. Did like 3 runs after finishing rune mysteries cause I happened to have a pickaxe on me, and I figured it would make lamping a little more valuable (even though I'm lamping herb). Also stuck at Wintertodt and have absolutely no plans to runecraft again soon
---
I have no gripe with people getting early pets.
---
I do have one with people who got extremely lucky and therefore assume anyone complaining is in the wrong.
---
What I propose would only affect people who are extremely dry, allowing them to (statistically) get what they're looking for a few kills earlier. I honestly do not see a single downside other than if you have sadistic tendencies. Seriously, all it does is slightly affect extreme bad luck to make it less prevalent, without affecting other people's rates.
---
So the cool thing about zulrah is you can upkeep and have left overs using trident blowpipe and visage. So if you want kills you could do void mage and sell ahrims for a bp. Or even just downgrade to mystics for the bp. If you actually want to learn and grind zulrah, a bp and a guide are essential

theyve also literally made changes to the client to make it easier for colour blind players. i think they just didnt think of it dude, seems more like a fuck up than a fuck you
---
no i dont think you should be able to do that unless everyone can
---
good bait
---
I didn't say it was, my point is that GPU rendering should be in the official client but it isn't because Jagex handed over that responsibility to 3rd party clients, which is the reason for this mess.
---
I also didn't say 3rd party clients shouldn't be limited, I'm saying it's Jagex's fault that they're out of hand because their client has been neglected. Hence the title - 
---
&gt;People use the unofficial client because **the official client has been neglected by Jagex for too long.**
---
What exactly has confused you?
---
That wasn't a brag, that was context, but by all means belittle me. It's socially acceptable on the internet, and not at all detrimental to our perception of normal human interactions over time.

Sorry to hear you got lured. I am not sure what could have been done in this situation though. You got lured because you trusted someone. Those kind of lures will happen basically no matter what you put in place. However, do you think there was something that could have stopped it? For example I got lured/scammed and there was something that could have been done:
---
I got lured/scammed way back (like in 2006-7) when poison karambwans were known as poorly cooked and I befriended some rando in their PoH. They got me down to like 2 hp in the fighting ring, then kicked and gave me those and was like "lets go do something else". I ate them and died. Thankfully they did patch both the PoH health mechanics and changed the name of the karambwans. [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poison\_karambwan](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Poison_karambwan)
---
I really hope you guys find a way to integrate the better features of Runelite into the main client.  This may come off as an overreaction but I'm probably going to quit and cancel my membership if I can no longer re-order my Prayers.  The only things I do now are PK or play LMS every now and then and I can't be bothered to reconfigure my brain to play on the regular prayer ordering, since I'll have to learn a new inventory set up as well.
---
“A tile is a useless item that can be found in certain places of the wilderness”

I especially have a problem with "Indicates where projectiles will land". You mean to tell me drawing telegraph zones on the ground, a feature that is present in vanilla in every MMO I've played except this one, is against the rules?
---
As I suspected, OP’s objective for making this art of a resurrected Nieve, in order to get neck beards erected, worked as expected.

Real question is why are you doing normal rumbles? 31k points a hour?   
---
bruh need another 3 in front of that.
---
The flip side of the coin is when you see choobs wearing good mage accuracy bonus against a monster with a mage lvl of 1
---
I'm actually pretty aware since I had one myself that I turned into a rune drag alt. Nah, BBD's were super chill and I could easily do vork and zulrah while doing those. You just have notifications set and retaliate on and attack set to right click. I would definitely just rather not played the alt if I was going to do something than click for 200k an hour.
---
 Like I said, most are actually just gold farmers because getting banned with a DHCB would be pretty ...uh bad.. to their actual health.  Slayer isn't really a skill that's commonly botted either since 77 slayer is a fair amount of time, since we're talking opportunity cost here.
---
just hunting the pet, running back to the safespot and hopping is quicker than staying inside the room
---
Some menu items need to be reworked on the original client as well. While the "talk-to" option on master farmers is a great option, majority of the people interact with these NPCs using the "pickpocket" option and that is pretty obvious.
---
I would even go as far as to say that black-jacking and pickpocketing should become the default options on the menaphite thugs as long as you wear the rogue outfit. Thematically it would make perfect sense. Just like monsters used to and still do default to "Attack" option as soon as the player's combat level exceeds the monster's combat level, wearing a rogue outfit should cause the thieving options to become the default left-click. You're clearly geared out to steal things.
---
Can do the same thing for construction as long as the player is wearing construction or lumberjack outfit. "Remove" option can remain as right-click but if you are in building mode, your intent is not to "examine" things.

It's one of the easiest skills to 99 for a casual - so I'll just assume he's a casual =p. Hell, I play about 6-8 hours a day, but all except for 2 of those hours are me afk fishing anglers at work, which are slow xp, but I do tree &amp; herb runs every day. I'll probably end up like this guy =p
---
hey man runelite already made their client complient so i think that most people will actually stop using them actually
---
oh and uh im no expert but anyone with a modicum of understanding of general business or jagex specifically knows the people detecting cheating and developing the client arent the same people but sure whatever you do you man
---
anyway yeah fuck yeah jamflex dumb
---
youre a casual
---
I’ve been using one of the websites that kind sidles up alongside my client. If I sell my Ahrims for a BP, swap to void mage (makes swapping for range even easier) should I drop bank for a visage too? And I’m assuming you mean serpent visage or the helm for venom immunity and poison?
---
The fuck is this blow pipe for then huh? Yeah thought so.

---
There should be a mechanic where if you die to a falling rock at MLM you wake up on tutorial island with all lvl 1 stats.
---
Runelite had already updated itself to fit jagex's reqs, if the feature is available on base runelite then it's allowed
---
Considering the majority of the people commenting in the new Jagex blog post about 3rd party clients appear to have not read the actual blog post itself, I wanted to make more people aware of a comment made by the lead RL dev himself (Adam).
---
For anybody that actually read the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dp87cj/another_message_about_unofficial_clients/), it's very clear that the MES changes they are referencing will not impact the majority of the MES functions available in runelite. So any outrage that is surfacing due to MES changes (as seen throughout the majority of that thread) is completely unwarranted, and honestly makes us all look like a bunch of children.
---
You’re statistically not anymore unlucky than anyone. You took statistics so you should know that when you combine the aggregate total of odds for the entire player base, the average odds are the same. You are unlucky for a thing but you are not unlucky for every single thing. That’s ridiculous.
---
Did you read the post? None of those menu entry swap features that you listed were said to be bannable in the post. Those are all still fair game.
---
I'd don't think they'd ever be able to detect at least half of the features they're 'prohibiting'. The only thing they can do is scare people, and/or get RuneLite to remove them out of fear
---
His fm, smithing, and cooking alone is enough to pay for that gear.
---
If you read the comments and look at the vote ratios, most of the community seems to hate this. 
---
Put aside for a second the point which has already been made many times, that most of these features are undetectable and therefore banning them simply rewards players who continue to use illicit clients.
---
Why don't you just do a fucking poll, feature by feature? OSRS claims to value player-driven development, but it seems abundantly clear that neither of these statements were well-received by the community.
---
&gt;  I don’t have any pets yet and am probably just under drop rate, but if I went 2x the drop rate the pet would just be that much more satisfying to me personally.
---
This is the part I see all the time. Yes, when you're just under or around the DR, the excitement just mounts. However, and you can absolutely bookmark this comment if you want, this feeling does not remain long. It turns into quiet disappointment first, then anger, then rage, then sadness, then just emptiness. I'm guessing Kacy has been on that last stage for quite some time now.
---
Don't forget Jagex banned a bunch of people falsely and then ONLY undid it after one was a famous streamer 🦀
---
Thanks! I'll keep this in mind, I'm currently 35 in both att and str, so I still got a lil bit to go. I knew I'd need to eat more but I didn't know it was this much, because I heard that with a pure generally you'd be able to kill things faster than they'd be able to hit you. I shoulda researched more tbh lol
---
It’s hardly neglect. It’s just pure stupidity. Jagex is known for making massive mistakes and having to backtrack. The only reason OSRS is even in existence is because of Jagex’s stupidity. I have so little faith in this company now that I’m older &amp; realize how braindead of a company they are. If I didn’t enjoy the game so much I wouldn’t put up with them. Good game. Shit company. Get good Jagex.

I hope that prayer swapping is allowed again in the future. As a pker with both a main and zerk build, it is difficult to have muscle memory for both rigour/augury vs eagle eye/mystic might.
---
OSB had to go crazy with their features and start fucking it up for everybody because 98% of people ditched their client
---
Jesus Christ, poor dude with 24,000 zulrah kills lmao.
---
Stretched mode just resizes everything. They're referring to resizing and ordering to similar effects as the spellbook filters in the original client.
---
My pure is lv3 still cuz I'm to lazy to level on cows again
---
It just forces Runelite to remove the plugins from the majority of the playerbase. The only people who will have access are the people who will write the plugins themselves. They really don’t need to invest in detection, although in the post they said they would be working and investing to be able to detect those features, because Runelite will have to comply or their client will become bannable overall. 
---
Their strategy is pretty obvious. They want you to be able to use most features, and by making large statements like “MES being bannable” they will endure facing this backlash about QoL with bankers and leprechauns in order to make sure game integrity is secure and leave less ambiguity with plugins that can compromise the legitimacy of the game.
---
There is no blanket ban on menu entry swapping. The only feature that was removed from the menu entry swapper plugin is the pickpocket/talk-to swap. All the other ones are fine and are still in the client.
---
Stop trolling people are really worried.

I'd assume so, if they had a back and forth I'm sure anything of question would of been sorted out. I'd still stay away from the OSBuddy shit though. Unless they patch it out.
---
Imagine mythic raiding in WoW with a default UI and forced to use their chat (which was always shit) or type. You're at a disadvantage if you don't use Weak Aura's (DBM and BigWigs too fall under here).  and discord. More information available to players instantly and making choices off of it was always a core part of it. A player is targeted with something on prog? Easy, share a weak aura that highlights the range it spreads and have it spam if you're targeted. This kind of shit was a regular thing. 
---
This is actually one of the worst points I've ever read for this. You've just convinced yourself that suffering for no solid reason is something that is a core part of the game.
---
I kind of like that dragon claws are effective at every point in the kill while bgs feels less good when you have to wait  for 50% spec when vork is already 75% hp.
---
Still so hard to say...
---
Eh idk man sounds like you were betting and your script messed up
---
&gt; You’re statistically not anymore unlucky than anyone.
---
My ~200M exp (all doing only the best/close to the best skilling methods to optimize pet chance) in petable skills would like a word with you. That's over ~7x the drop rate. I know people with worse luck than me. If you understand statistics, then you know that a small percentage of the population will be very unlucky in **every** grind.

All sarcasm aside I agree with the majority. It’s should be extremely rare. It SHOULD take 3x the drop rate sometimes. That’s just my opinion. I understand where you are coming from for your argument and though maybe the system you suggested would have been fine on release. I don’t agree with ever changing as it has been how it is for too long. The people who have put in the time to grind out the 3x+ dry streaks don’t deserve to be devalued because person B. Doesn’t wanna do it.

You say they’re a sense of achievement like 99s are. I disagree completely. I don’t find a 3kc impressive whatsoever. I find 3k kc with no pet far more impressive and prestigious.

I've said this a lot before and I'll say it again. Updating the official client to add features from 3pc is a bad idea. It leads to the problem RS3 has of feature creep, where the UI has become unintuitive to the point most new players don't want to touch it.
---
Jagex has not outright banned 3pc because they add QoL to a veteran player's experience. They have not added any features to the official client because most options are not friendly to all players.
---
A new player won't know what to do with tile markers or menu entry swappers and the more small things are added, the more confusing the UI becomes.
---
Despite what everyone who uses 3pc thinks, the official client is actually considered one of the best user interfaces in MMORPGs. Its strengths come from the fact that it is simple and intuitive. At no point in the game's history has anyone ever felt that they had to fight the UI to play the game. This is good game design.
---
f
---
They're not going to be banned because they can't detect it. If it was really a botting issue they would of been banned when they used it.
---
This is exactly what happened to auto hot key many years ago. It was a tool that the majority of the player base used with common decency. It was mainly just to buy, or sell items or use it to quick drop a inv.
---
Then people on Reddit started posting at mod Ash and the others on Twitter showing them their bot set ups they made with ahk and mouse keys and said "can I bot like this?". And they did it constantly just like the redditors did with third party clients. They essentially forced jagex to step in and say "no retards you can't bot, and you know what now that we are here you also can't do x, y, and z too. Now fuck off"
---
And that's exactly what happened to third party clients. I have been saying this for fucking a year now and I get downvoted. And was I wrong? No.
---
Yea man !
---
Imagine deciding to rush an objective and opening the door in advance.
---
Similar to door breaching.
---
Where did it say tile markers are banned did I miss something?
---
Its playable only in the sense that you can boot it up and log in. How many people do you think would go back to using it if it was the only option? Because I can almost promise you that they would lose half their playerbase if not more.
---
"Removal or swapping of menu entries on any entity" this is bullshit this should actually just be a part of the game for players to order the menu in any way they want. it's what the community wants. it's QOL so you should accept that. I honestly believe you should look at WoW and treat plugin like WoW treats addons.
---
Being able to reorder the prayer allows for players to easily select the prayer they desire. I would love it on mobile If I could do that. Cause choosing like eagle eye and tough skin isn't entirely a difficult task. But sure makes it easier if I could place it into a set location. Yes pvp would be the primary place of an advantage. As I don't pvp im not worried about it. But its just jagex making sure no one has any advantages over anyone else. No matter how small.
---
Jeeeeeesus man. Congratz! That's super awesome!
---
Maybe I'm too jaded, but I feel like they would have done that a long time ago if they were going to do it at all.
---
good point I missed that
---
The problem with scouting bots is that they require very little interaction with the client itself, they won't be picked up on by any of the automated systems because all they do is walk around and hop worlds, they're also infinitely renewable considering there is no requirements at all.
---
Even if they did somehow figure out a way to stop/hinder scouting bots they can always be implemented into the already running rev bots or other already running wilderness bots (Not really sure what gets botted in the wildy other than Revs, Agility, and maybe dark crabs).
---
Fucking Puro Puro. Spent ages grinding out hunter only to get assfucked by the venezuelans.
---
Back in my day you could make good money picking flax, they've took over seers farmland!
---
It's dealing a certain amount of damage to it within 2 Olm actions (8 ticks). The amount of damage you have to do depends on how many people are in the raid.
---
Those were already removed by Runelite's own discretion, so you're talking about something that doesn't even exist.
---
Also, enjoy your 20FPS, game window the size of a Pokemon card, and constant crashes.
---
The guy is fucking drip ignore him.  I 100% agree on scaleable rng for all untradeables having gone 10k+ dry on mutagen.  I feel like I missed out on so much potential training and raids with friends for no reason at all.  I also still don't have it so I literally gained nothing from it.  All nonscaleable rng does is force people to grind more bringing in more GP and resources into the game for no reason except a cosmetic pet/item.
---
I'm confused what even happened... Looked like he was killed by prime? So he accidentally lured prime onto him?
---
I did.
---
I got a beginner clue scroll, with the reward of:  One steel battleaxe, and a leather body.
---
Can someone make a list of the safe plugins please?
---
&gt;The following interface changes are prohibited:
---
&gt;Any movement or resizing of click zones for any interface or component under combat options, inventory, worn equipment, prayers or spell book
---
It seems like yet another gray area. Clearly a combat option is being affected, but it does sound like it means, "Don't move the special attack bar". Ultimately only Jagex can say if removing it entirely counts as moving/resizing.
---
It's literally more profitable to sell the seeds.
---
You're right I am SO much worse than you at right clicking something and moving my mouse all the way down to the bottom of the list for the thing that I wanted first.
---
I know theres clans you can pay but they are expensive
---
The descriptions of banned features are aimed more at the client developers so they know what they can or can't have in their clients. All the features covered by the statement have been removed from runelite as of the latest update
---
I seen that but figured it was the free one you can get....
---
I’m going to try to avoid those as much as possible. Thanks for the reply though!
---
You *could* try zulrah but you wouldnt succeed. Try some chaos druids or if you want you could get your potential up for barrows for more rune and bolt drops.
---
this is what happens when I turn on open GL and anti aliasing
---
Most of the value is from bones though and banking all of those bones would cut into your rates significantly
---
Evolution of Cock

omfg if that was 13 I don't think the alchables would be the focus of this post.  I totally see the 13, but it's just (8.
---
I’ve never seen someone get so butthurt because no one liked their idea.

---
Everybody have weaknesses. If almost every single individual should be able to complete all in game content then the hardest thing to do in game would be to kill a fire giant or run a lap of an agility course.
---
It's a game. Challenges are challenges and every different individual doesn't have to be able to beat all of them by ease.
---
There's a scroll for moon clan from treasure trails
---
Oh, I didn't know you got a free one.
---
But no, was from the goblin(s).  They seem to drop them relatively regularly.
---
Done a couple from Goblins, and having been sent to Charlie the Tramp, has pushed me to gain some more level, for his task(s).
---
That's fair, I overexaggerrated. The progressively more strict restrictions on QoL features that have some abuse cases still significantly impacts the playability of the game for many people. It's not a massive "all plugins are banned!" kind of move but bit by bit the game's QoL is being hurt to protect it's integrity.
---
A much better solution, of course, would be Jagex having a client that has QoL but not abuse cases, and *then* banning 3rd party clients.
---
I deiron it and it was fun to rebuild rather keep playing than keep trash my account.
---
yes, and he wants to avoid it
---
Instead of banning convenience features that improve the game, why not work with the developers of these clients and actually improve the game so these clients aren't needed? Unbelievable.
---
RuneLite/OSB and some of these QoL changes have seriously improved my OSRS experience and honestly I'd have quit without them some time ago.
---
Imagine taking a stance that your community is against in a game that is supposed to be completely community driven. Wild.
---
On that note, what about the hundreds or possibly thousands of people who have already extensively used things like 1 click blackjacking and other "overpowered" plugins for significant benefit? Doesn't seem fair that I don't have the opportunity to do this myself when others have seemingly done it for months without any stance or punishment.
---
How do I report all the streamers and YouTubers I see breaking these rules?
---
Thanks!
---
Serious but not serious.
---
Runelite has been known to comply with feature removal requests from Jagex in the past.
---
Ro0bo is that you lol
---
This, I used to run like 20 bots back in 2006 doing ess and you’d make so much gp, doesn’t matter if they get banned you can make another 20.  It was bad
---
so is MES for fishing bannable? I play on a shitty laptop and right clicking is painful on there
---
Obviously one less thing for btw to complain about is a con
---
It will still show you the health bar of your opponent, but not who your opponent is targeting.
---
I mean its kinda free you get one from x marks the spot but you gotta do the quest soo. Hopefully the chickens drop clue scrolls as well :)
---
Watching plebs get nuked because they can't right click
---
I didn't know how much I wanted this
---
No I am, just pointing that out as it doesnt open up a new option or anything either.
---
And cut into shareholder profit? Hahaha!
---
Oh fantastic, I didn't know that.
---
I can confirm that thus far, they haven't dropped one.
---
I'd say 4.5, but ping is pretty volatile most of the time so I end up eating a couple scorpions or a mortar or two during woox walking every 2 or 3 trips making my kill count for that trip as low as 2, only counting trips I don't die on.  I'd be pretty confident that 5 would be avg if my ping was stable.
---
Not really a game you play at work but Brawl Stars is really good
---
The dream
---
oh it really is only 8. really looked like 13 on my mobile
---
Are they seriously getting rid of boss timers?...
---
So we all have to go back to using a stopwatch app on our phones now? The way normal game devs look at mods is that if it is something you can do with your phone or a pen/paper, then it is okay and not game-breaking.
---
Damn you sure made her look hot
---
Literally. I only started playing again less than two weeks ago, used RuneLite on recommendation from a friend, and this is the first I’m hearing if it being potentially bannable.
---
Def could have been worse, it’s just different now. Don’t have much time to get it to click in my brain like how I had my prayers before. Played how I did for quite some time. I’d really like to know more about the intention behind this update in hopes to have PvP unaffected or even updated to undo this. If not then I guess I will have to get to workkk
---
"Detached" refers to camera modes that don't revolve around your character, like the [oculus orb](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Oculus_orb) offers.
---
Hey so was mine, and it literally got banned for hacking. Welcome to the shitshow.
---
Jagex are so far out of touch with the community it sickens me.
---
I'm rarely active either. All I know is that it's a special clue scroll boss you can access for rare loot with higher tier clues.
---
Welcome to jagex where we ban people who want to open a bank but let bots get 200m mining with no ban brought to you by bass ackwards logic

Yup youre right. The osbuddy issue really forced them to stop ignoring the issue for sure. even RL has questionable plugins.
---
ironmans
---
I'm strongly opposed to that mainly because I want freedom in what I choose to do, I want the freedom to go grind a boss for 3000 kills in a row if I choose to. Farming pvm is a major part of this game and part of why people enjoy it so I imagine most people would be opposed to changes like this also it would hinder ironmen for no benefit at all
---
OSBuddy made it a problem. We were all getting by just fine in a slightly uneasy state of equilibrium until they dropped that pack of insanely OP features.
---
Actually playing on the accounts instead of letting them sit. 99s are a whole different story because most UIM's will never get any
---
All lvl 1, stats got transferred to rs3. Kinda sad, but nothing to do about it. stats were nothing too special.
---
Alright then I’m gonna vote no on all the shit I don’t use that should be allowed.
---
So what?
---
There's no cosmic reason why pets should be treated differently, and honestly they shouldn't. Maybe it'd be a good idea to apply this measure to other drops, who knows? All I know is that it's an enormous, depressing grind that sucks the fun out of the game. So there's your reason why. To *slightly* soften an enormous, depressing grind for those who are willing to do whatever it takes for a pet.
---
No problem mate, I redirected the downvote to this comment.  No need to worry about him getting downvoted.
---
I addressed it at the end of the video and pinned a comment dawg. But on top of what I already explained, I'm a full time University student with a part-time job on top, so making a song for EVERY episode is extremely difficult. Also, these were two quests I really didn't know what to make a song about as I was already stressing to finish this episode in the first place. Songs will come, but they're for fun.
---
If it fails the first poll it shouldn't be in the game, ask a question enough times and people will say yes.
---
i use it for clues.
---
say sike right now
---
Mobile Wintertodt isn't that bad
---
Was that with the group btw update?
---
I haven’t tried it yet, but I played 85% mobile (since I just don’t have time to use the desktop). Would love to give it a shot
---
I wholeheartedly believe it as do many others. My Stance is this. I AM going to continue using what makes the game enjoyable to ME because that's the point. If that gets me banned then all they will have accomplished is losing themselves 12 bucks a month. They make the game for us and should implement what we want not what they think is right. World of Warcraft deals with plugins/addons the best way imo Jagex should follow suit
---
Idk if I'd call that active then, but I'm a nolifer, what's considered active like a few hours a week? 90 cooking is rank 244, 94 pray is rank 58, 86 rc is rank 193. Seems to me like there's maybe 500-1000, if that.
---
Thanks! More private server features it seems. Looks like sabbatical will continue.
---
Your lack of ability to do something in the game should come from lack of practice and/or skill, not from a physical disability preventing you from having a fair shot at it.
---
stay salty my friend :) Then people other than pvpers can complain about the voting system haha. I only started OSRS 2 months ago, tried RL for 1 week, then switched back to vanilla after the initial announcement oh plugins being ban worthy now, so wont affect me.
---
Lol please don’t tell me you think a BMW is flex worthy. Edit this post to say Mercedes or Tesla pls
---
The OSB devs knew they could still operate while doing all of the dirty plug-ins. They have worked for and with jagex before. Multiple of the companies higher ups are actual ex-Jmods. 
---
If jagex uses a 3rd party client dev, they'll end up going with OSB only.
---
Also if you have 3 bruma torches and roll another one you get a torstol seed instead and if you have 3 warm gloves and roll another of those, you get a magic seed instead.
---
Combat in Runescape is harder than WoW in my opinion. The pathing system is non-intuitive, there is significant delay on every action due to low tickrate &amp; high latency, and the visual cues are harder to read. Prayer flicking tick perfect, tick eating, woox walking are all mechanics that are much harder than any WoW raid mechanic, if you ask me.
---
Not to mention, in WoW there are plugins that almost play the game for you and are completely legal, as well.
---
how are you confused theres a clip with commentary lol
---
Because this isn't fucking WOW now, is it?
---
Fucking gratz my mans, super dope
---
Forgot to mention this is my fourth pet!
---
They are so good man lol
---
They already said, those are Venezuelan Gold Farmer's not bots, and they can't ban them until they've actually sold the gold. Looking like a Gold Farmer or only liking 1 thing in the game isn't something they want to start banning people for.
---
the people that think they're going too far just suck at the game, or are really lazy and refuse to admit it to themselves.  They'll be OK
---
So for now compile an earlier release of RL I downloaded because I knew this was going to happen, until you supposedly can detect everything, okay got it. The message this sends is OSB is totally fine to make OP plugins with the literal intention of fucking up both clients. Should've just sent them a C&amp;D at this point.
---
Resizable icons passed 2 polls, and only failed the 3rd unannounced poll by 0.3% with 13k less votes over a holiday weekend. So it should be in the game.
---
There's no way to say this without sounding like a massive dick, but you obviously can't expect them to develop this game, with hundreds of thousands of active players, around a handful who have a mental disability.  Any accommodation of those players (such as reducing the difficulty of the hardest content in some way or another) is just going to be abused and farmed by the other few hundred thousand people who don't have that problem.
---
I know you already feel bad about it, I'm not trying to kick a man while he's down.  But that's just no way to build a game.
---
&gt;resizes everything
---
If we approach it like this: This rule exists to prevent the unfair advantage of having easier to click buttons giving those players an advantage, than does stretched fixed mode not do exactly this? It technically scales prayers and spells. The wording is against this sort of feature. The fact that scaled UI's haven't been implemented in the vanilla client only support this. Who knows if they would even pass a poll.
---
And I say again, I don't necesarily believe that they'll come after resizeable fixed mode, but the wording for rulesets like these shouldn't have such large grey areas.
---
gear is important and defence actually matters against rune drags since they hit like a truck. justiciar is dope for them. inventory is basically right thoguh yeah, personally i prefer alchs to veng in the pouch but you do you
---
In top dps gear and supply cost, you have to factor that in, not to mention people aren’t getting them every 10 hours. Basilisks are beasts that take longer to kill than that.
---
dude you sound like a total boomer lol you state your opinion so confidently as if it's a fact and then act like some martyr for what's right lmao. "Almost nothing added by RuneLite, OSBuddy or whatever other third party client qualifies as quality of life." Opinion not fact.
---
Qol mandatory update plz.

My icon is still from winter 2017. Mine still has a santa hat on ever since I installed in during beta.

Just why? Why can't jagex see that runelite makes the game way more playable and enjoyable... removing stuff is just gonna kill the game...

lmfaaaaao 1 jaw every 10 hours 🤣🤣 bro you're in for a bad time

the serial abuser with a t slur in her new bio? 🤔🤔🤔

CasualBA or casual ba or something like that.

Holy shit! Nice!
---
PVP’ers are uncompromising with us, so we’re uncompromising with them. It’s a bitter Cold War where eye for an eye continues to increase in proportions.
---
How in the hell did you find that post hostile or aggressive? It was a lot more reasonable than your own post. You just started acting really defensive for no reason.
---
Don't be so insecure. I don't think it was a personal attack.
---
I agree, but these sweaty nerds keep raging
---
I’ll check it out! Thank you!
---
This is what they meant when they said 3rd party clients give unfair advantage
---
What a nightmare
---
&gt; For that reason I believe that if you cannot possibly enforce a rule, it just shouldn't be a rule.
---
While I get the logic, I can't agree with that. That is saying if there ever is a bot they can't detect, then that bot should be legal. Cheaters will cheat regardless but that doesn't mean cheating should be made the norm.
---
Please don't tell me you think a Tesla is flex worthy
---
She cute tho
---
It's a great boss for early ironmen - super easy to kill, and shits out tons of Crystal keys (dragonstones are pretty scarce on low level btws)
---
no, these are bots. they hop the instant you say "Bot?" even mid run.
---
MTX nice pvp bad
---
WELL it sold for 700 mill. I literally have no idea what to do. I have not decided if i want to buy every buyable 99, and then see what bis items i can buy with what its left. Or if I should prioritize buying bis items, and focus on slayer with really good items. And then just train buyable skills when needed. Lol im kinda overwhelmed. Also i dont really play thaaat much. I usually play like 2-3 weeks, then take a 3 month break. Lol so, idk what to do rn.
---
A good majority of them, menu entry swapper alone is bannable.
---
I just checked, apparently five times but they were all several years ago. My passwords have been changed several times over since then and I honestly don't even remember my passwords at the time.
---
Vote no to PvP polls boys
---
I've gotten this drop and this made me laugh so fucking hard, i feel this meme.
---
I mean how bad is your computer? It’s a game from the early 2000’s it runs awesome on any piece of shit machine I boot it up on. I’ve been playing for years with the official client, do raids, got fire cape, high lvls, and I’ve never had an issue. Anyone who needs runelite is handicapping themselves
---
I understand that this isn't just you, but this is an incredibly disappointing announcement. 
---
While I appreciate providing further information, I find the content of the newspost to be a bit confusing and ambiguous. 
---
So many people are tied into and used to using clients like base RuneLite, which has in the past co-operated with you and removed overpowered features. 
---
The main client is lacking a lot of quality of life, and I agree with the sentiment that it's absurd to start threatening bans without any reasonable, official replacement in place. 
---
As others have said, I personally don't care to play the game with the official client in its current state. 
---
If I'm banned for using things like the menu entry swapper and tile markers on runelite, then I'm out of this game and my money is gone. 
---
Do we really want to make this the hill that OSRS dies on?
---
I didn’t take his comment as aggressive at all?
---
Honestly I think its better to have quality songs where they fit/not feel required to have one every episode. Keeps them a little more special and makes the videos more varied. Loving the series.
---
I see why a lot of people don’t look forward to it vs normal iron men or mains. But me and my bro in law are pumped for it.
---
Use OSbuddy or Runelite at you're own risk. Unfortunately I've only used the original client so can't help. However Runelite has cut the features from it's client that aren't allowed, but I don't believe OSbuddy has.
---
Tbh this is a great suggestion. I'll ask him tonight but I really think you might be on to something. Thank you very much for the help.
---
Atleast it was the ugly one of the two
---
They did poll it again after that and it failed again. I wouldn't be opposed to seeing it repolled in the future, like in the upcoming QoL month or such. Though they would likely avoid repolling it too often, especially given its history with polls.
---
Is switching bankers bank option or bones to use similar to thieving and talk to?
---
Runelite doesn't make money. It's osbuddy you're thinking of.
---
Picture of totally average elite clue.
---
Great content dude.
---
Thanks for doing this. As a mobile only player, I had no idea PC players 3rd party clients had the capabilities to put me at so huge a disadvantage.
---
I’m not trying to pick fights with anyone or anything, I just see content releases or statements from Jagex being heavily criticized. You go on twitch for the Q&amp;A streams and basically every time one of the mods opens their mouth there’s nothing but criticism. I’m not saying Jagex is free from criticism or attempting to white knight- there are definitely things I disagree with. I just feel like at this point people are being critical for the lulz
---
Asking third party clients to remove certain features. Without having an alternative solution on the Official Client. Doesn't really fix the problem.
---
Wtf? Who cares how someone sees an item. If a main enjoys it for the money so what? Voluntary iron men acting like pretentious pricks because they voluntarily chose to be an iron man is laugh out loud funny
---
Hit the nail on the head Flemts. Jagex should have addressed this years ago, but instead they let 3pcs become an integral part of the game.
---
I see it as the final drop for most bosses, as far as I'm concerned if I have pet in most situations I won't return, sadly only that's been sire, as my pet rates suuuck
