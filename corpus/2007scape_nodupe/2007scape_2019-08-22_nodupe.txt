Problem with the Q&amp;A it's the same questions over and over again or stupid ass suggestions. Idm them doing those, I would prefer first 30 just straight Q&amp;A, and the next thirty is announcements, fan art, quiz etc.

Sometimes people run into the wild with all their teles or all their gp. You never know what someone else has in their inventory. I don‚Äôt PK but if you‚Äôre going into the wildy and get killed by someone, it‚Äôs fair game.

until they get a scythe, in which case rapier/tent is never used again?

Did your time really get devalued if you had fun? This is a game after all.

He's wrong anyway, no one cares at all about that. It's for what Chris and Raven said, feels good rolling for big hits on helpless noobs and you never know what shit people are risking. Numerous posts on this sub and youtube clips of accidental cash stacks, accidental skulling and too many teleports, runes, scrolls, gp. Only take a minute when i'm out pking and may not have seen anyone for 15mins!

Slayer at high levels can easily sustain kingdom and much more. The average greater nech task of 200+ earns me 800k-1m+.

---
For a low level like yourself I would honestly blackjack. I've heard it's ezmode to blackjack with leftclick using op clients so you may want to look into that if you decide to blackjack.
---
Any recommendations for guidance. Or is it the same as last time do all the free play and then pay to play
---
Yeah, they're pretty sweet, and that profit isn't factoring in the later income from skotizo that you'll get due to all the totem pieces and shards.  The wiki lists brutal blacks as ~770k/hr with 40 kills/hr, but says that max efficiency is 70-75 kills/hr so my income makes sense. 
---
 I usually get around 60.   
---
I also use less supplies than what the wiki cites.  I use 2 prayer pots per run (sometimes less), instead of 2.5.  I use only 1 dose of divine ranging pots per run, not 3.  Using assembler and having 99 ranging means I use fewer dragon bolts (e) than what they are citing.  And I bank using the farming cape tele to go to farming guild and then replenish stats with pool in house from the spirit tree, so that saves time banking and takes away the house telly costs.  It's all small stuff here and there, but it adds up.
---
where does it say that pkers should get resources from pker.  its called player killing, you shouldnt be expected to train an account to 2277 from player killing.  If they want to make money they pvm, if they want to train their skills they do it like skillers.  Why do pkers have this mindset that the game should be handled to them on a silver platter with limited risk/work involved?  why should they be able to move past the grind/time that everyone else has to wade through?
---
So your personal oppinion is irrelevant then. Fan boi.
---
oof
---
The general rule of thumb is the action always needs to be 1:1. If you're doing anything that generates 2+ actions with only 1 click, probably not safe.

mute is piss fast if you have freezes, i would recommend one of you have dwarhammer and the other bgs if you are going to do tek.  they both should only add about 1-2 minutes max on your raid time.

‚ÄúSorry guys we just looked at the code and it seems we‚Äôve accidentally removed it about a year ago‚Äù dwh 50m=&gt; 2147m

For this theory to be true it‚Äôs reasonable to expect to see a similar item from CoX to be decreasing in price because the rise in people doing CoX would lead to a rise in the supply of that item in the GE. A Dextrous prayer scroll is a near perfect comparison because both are very commonly dropped as uniques, are roughly the same price and are one time BIS consumables so they can‚Äôt be being dumped for a new META for new content or the like, they are literally permanent to the account. And you do see exactly that happening, the Dex has been dropping in price steadily over the past week or so. But I think it might be more complicated than simply that because I would expect to see a larger drop than a mil or so in the Dex for the spike seen with the hilts. I think it being mid-late August and the fact that college/high school aged kids are beginning classes again is decreasing the amount of raids being completed and causing a drop in supply. Just my 200 cents
---
ok then thanks for letting me know
---
yet non skullers cant fight back because a vast majority of teams/clans use alts with same names making it impossible to know who you are retaliating on.  Even more so if they catch a freeze and stand on you while logging onto another account.  Then the pvmer is skulled and risking 10x what the pker/clan/team is risking.  In no situation is it worth it to fight back in the wild.  that is the largest disadvantage and you can not counter argue to that.

I don‚Äôt want to be that guy but could these 99 parties be planned a day in advance and post the date? I legit want to go visit these guys and celebrate and I‚Äôm always 16 hours late.

Nah, just don't want people to take it the wrong way. Don't know Torvesta personally, it's just something about the way he talks that bugs me.

Nothing wrong with that but only if you're using dhcb/ward cause there's no way I'd want to do multi kill trips with a BP/bgs unless you get lucky and only use 1 or 2 food in the first kill.

"due me" and "due to me" are both acceptable in this case. if you're talking about the grammar

Idk why you'd do konar at high level when you're not doing hydra task. If you wanted fast exp you shouldn't have used konar. 
---
With 1000 hydra kills,assuming you received  the claw you would have made 152m from the drops.
---
More than 3x the total loot from all other task  from 96-99.

Much better then the ads that tried to copy the exact same format for mobile game ads.
---
I fully respect a pker who kills me, no hard feelings at all. I probably don't even remember your name the second I turn up in Edgevile.
---
It's just a chore having to move to the arena every 5-6 runs due to a pkers killing me (as they always do, I cannot, nor do I want to defend myself. I find fighting really barbaric and wish to shoo away from it as much as possible). If a pker wishes to do so it's their good right.
---
But isn't this part of "senseless violence" - there's a big campaign in the Netherlands against this. Violence which serves no purpose at all, if I really wish to spite the pker I'd just drop the bones. 
---
Again I respect them, but do we have to make it so that one person's fun destroy another's? Can't we create a community where we combined say "no" against violence?

People can do more damage to you without your email. Everytime I swipe my debit card I put myself at risk. Every time I walk in public I put myself at risk. Everytime I enter my name, phone number,address, email online I put myself at risk. Doesnt mean I'm gonna live like a hermit in a cave living on rats and rain water. 
---
Talking on reddit I put myself at risk. Someone could do more damage faster by tracking my phone or email from reddit,facebook and hacking into it then my email. Literally everything you do puts you at risk for something. Wouldnt mind if someone decided to try and fuck up my bank and credit. Its happened before from a purchase at a steakhouse lmao. And guess what I had all the money reversed and fixed within a day. Yayyyyy. Fuck making everything 2fa. I would hate to enter a pin at a atm to go to my phone to enter a pin on a 2fa software to allow money. Same for my emails, and everything else.

---
The Scythe is currently only BIS for TOB. It‚Äôs cost to use, its multi-hit effect only active on multi-tile npcs, and the fact that it‚Äôs a 2H weapon make it unusable everywhere else.
---
Replacing the Crush attack option with a Stab attack option along with a decent Stab bonus will greatly open up its effective use. This will allow players to use the Scythe at Vasa, Vorkath, Giant Mole, KBD, and Rune dragons (although at great cost).
---
Most importantly, giving the Scythe a viable stab option will objectively make it BIS for COX over the DHL (as it should be).
---
That‚Äôs why high end players don‚Äôt use Konar. With duradell, a lot of the tasks can be done as boss tasks instead.

Depends what their range or melee combat levels are and if they have money for max melee, if they match I'd say melee but at 91atk/94str/96 with no avernic and a couple other BiS str equipment bits missing the DPS was far far better and cheaper over all with the crossbow

Almost teled from this kill out of frustration. Was distracted irl and missed phase changes but I fixed the mess and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt tele.
---
Live in Bexley on the East, work as downtown as humanly possible.
---
Don't think that would be an issue
---
Yeah but Mage and range have a big pro that their combat level stays extremely low despite having very high stats in said skills. They can stay in pure territory cab levels while having 99 ranged or 99 magic, whereas mellee only players cannot do that because they have to train 3 skills.
---
Yeah. Is it because of my one fishing?

The market system is horrible compared to wows. Auction fees are taken from the item sale not when you post them. That means there's no consequence to lowering your price over and over and leads to people heavily undercutting constantly for no good reason.

Exactly. It's like if you bought a house for 500k and lived in it for a year and then the government gave everyone else a house for free. That doesn't devalue the fun you had for the year before that. It doesn't devalue the fun you can have now. It just makes it easier for everyone to have a house (or for RS, do endgame content).

I barely ever see any hate toward RS3, and that's surprising considering that a lot of people on the sub had their progress devalued through Jagex selling XP for IRL cash through SoF/TH etc. People play OSRS because they enjoy the game. 
---
If you want to see hate toward another game, go look at the RS3 sub lmao. Browse through their top of all time (and compare it to OSRS top of all time) and you'll notice that RS3 is obsessed with us. Their sub is filled with hatred toward OSRS because it's doing better than RS3. And this is coming from someone that plays both btw.

Clearly from my response, I agree with your sentiment haha. Anyone who thinks it didn't devalue anything is just objectively wrong
---
Show proof, i think you just realized no one was believing your bullshit and decided to pretend everything was resolved because you figured there was a 0% chance of your account being restored
---
i would also have to know the points. If you join the oblivion discord there is a bot channel where you can type ".gp raids x y z"

where x  = time in minutes to complete raid (17)
---
y = points per raid
---
z = people that are splitting (4)
---
Have you ever used the Scythes crush option?? It‚Äôs not a Crush alternative it has a +30 Crush bonus. Even on monsters weakest to crush you still use the slash option.
---
Why in the hell would you use a Scythe for any solo PVM content as it stands now anyways? The Scythe is best used in FFA raids to secure the drop.
---
Changing the Scythes secondary attack option from Crush to Stab does not break the game guys! None of these tangential comments have anything to do with this discussion.
---
Change nothing and watch the Scythe continue to free fall. Then when the Scythe is worth less than an Ely players maybe will start to understand.

Is there a cheaper way to train magic?  I've been training magic alongside slayer but runes are getting damn expensive. It takes on average 10-13 casts of fire bolt to kill a target and chaos runes are roughly 80-90g a pop. I'm spending almost 1k g to kill a target and getting little to no return on my investment.  Is there something I'm missing? Level 49 magic if that helps.

Alright buddy I‚Äôll keep this short and sweet. Go run a DPS check and come back. Because you‚Äôre so fucking wrong it‚Äôs not even worth further discussion. You‚Äôre using anecdotal evidence, and you‚Äôd use a BiS weapon for solo content if you‚Äôre pet hunting because GP is zero time at that point. (Pet hunters make a large portion of end game pvmers in case your uninformed there as well) Also using a scythe in FFA‚Äôs to secure drops is a mute point because why the fuck wouldn‚Äôt you use a BiS item if you can afford it?
---

Before level 70, it's better to train magic out of combat with something like alching while training agility. After 70, Ice Bursting certain Slayer tasks becomes really good.

Dude, you're missing the point.

No one needs a person to pop into every thread and remind everyone 'so-and-so is **allowed to do whatever they want**!'.
---
Of course they are. That's literally the nature of existing - you have the ability to do things.
---
No one is out here saying the douche in the OP is """not able to""" send rude comments - we all are; it's within the realm of possibility for anyone.
---
You aren't smart for pointing out other people can give you a hard time - that point doesn't actually mean anything. 
---
But by the exact same token, if anyone is able to 'shut [OP] down' (read: be a dick), then I am able to react to it and make fun of the person for being a piece of shit. 
---
What people like you don't get is - *yeah* - it's fully within your rights to piss someone off online, but just the same it's fully within their rights to be pissed and to ostracize you for it.
---
You have the right to make choices, not the right to avoid the consequences of those choices.
---
To take it a step into politics (where I honestly shouldn't), it's the same thing with super edgy teenagers using the N-word. Of course you're able to do it, but what you aren't able to do is stop other (non-braindead) members of the population for thinking you're a shitty person for it.

you can pay 130-140m for 2 weeks of protection at revs on 2k world, you will not die in that 2 weeks basically.  so you pay 130/140m and you can make anywhere from 300m-500m depending on how long you can play.

rapier is a solid 10-15% dps increase over lance on vasa crystals if i remember correctly, definitely worth bringing for cm even if u have a lance, and for team cox u don't even bring a lance if you're using max gear bc scythe is better on melee hand, so ofc u bring the rapier.

I kind of agree. I did 99 str in there in a week while on work or doing some other stuff. Its so afk that there should be less xp. Its insane that its very afk and still like best melee xp you can get.
---
I‚Äôm not high enough to appreciate this post

crush option on scythe is best for cerb

Wahaha if you think scythe isnt bis at tek vangs, you also say rapier isnt worth at vasa if u have lance, you clearly have like 50 kc and do sub40s smh

Ah ok I see what you mean now. I was familiar with the concept of  zero time skills (magic as well right?). But the way you phrased it, saying they start with 99 confused me.
---
So basically what you mean is if you may, you can have 99 fletching as well without extra time. Cool 
---
You still have to do the clicks tho so you still worked for it. Wouldn't say it's fair to say you start with it.
---
Because idiots try it every single time. They forget they don‚Äôt just ban for no reason.
---
It might give you more kills per trip but dhcb and lance are the same gp/hr but lance is less kills/hr, same gp/hr but less kills cause you dont have to factor in the bolts

After Warding failed, they did mention about focusing on existing projects and then later doing some surveys. LMS was the only project they mentioned at the time, but they have since put out blogs on the BH Rework and now Exiles. Both the BH Rework and Exiles were announced at past RuneFests, so they're likely using the opening the schedules to clear out some of those lingering updates they've been talking about. That said, we may have got Exiles with or without Warding since they did say Warding likely wouldn't have been released until 2020 and Exiles was originally mentioned to come between Kebos and SotE.

So you can easily contact customer support if needed?
---
It's the tone of your statement, 
---
&gt; I hope for the day people can support and promote each other‚Äôs creativity and goals. 
---
It's just...vacuous.  Communities of good people whipping themselves with faux-shame for being evil because we rooted out one bad apple.  You see in the Smash community all the time.  Out of millions of players, when someone is discovered doing something wrong, the community bans them, as they should.  But then people in the community love to come out and shame everyone and say, "We need to be better, we're the worst, I long for the day that the community can be good to people" etc. etc.
---
My point is that this is already that day.  The kind of vague moralizing that your statement was doesn't do anything but advance a narrative of "everything is fucked and evil" just because we're willing to call out and put the bad folks on the spot.  It's not a good thing, to dwell on or promote a mindset like that.

How dare you

Gl getting infernal on your gba

61 range for rune cbow, and 43 prayer for all protection prayers are very helpful, along with decent defence. A higher defence, ranged, or prayer level will help, especially prayer. There are a lot of methods, but generally it involves either using a cbow or blowpipe (75 range) as your weapon, and then cbow with diamond bolts e for jad. The other two major points I can think of it to utilize Italy rock as a safe spot, and to have at least decent gear, corresponding to your bank and levels.
---
youre wrong, sorry. and I will keep trying to prove my innocence despite having to hear what people like you have to say.
---
on video editors its called "motion tracking", basically you create a 'skeleton' out of 'sticks' and move where the image is frame by frame.
---
Tfw they say they dont get a shit.
---
It just sounds like a pretty basic JRPG at that point, with less enjoyable combat than most.
---
Where‚Äôs the random level 80 dude that just happens to log on right on top of the imp and steal it after your 2nd failed attempt?
---
Am I the only one that spent a literally minute looking for the third face in the picture?
---
Sadly I do not own either of those. I do however have a blowpipe. I‚Äôm not an Ironman so should I wait till I can afford a bgs?
---
Your innocence. Ahahahahahahahahaha.
---
I'm already half way done lol. And if if I'm going to get a membership, if I do, it'll most likely be when I can afford a bond

Congrats on the three dragonstone amulets!

Hah! Gottem!

I can't wait to go see Yoloswaggay420x69x in game
---
It's in the game settings, not runelite.
---
Go to advanced settings and toggle "side panels"
---
$11 says you get there and the lumbridge fishing tutor is Chris Hansen.
---
Def not a jrpg. Just a regar rpg. But yes with worse combat, yet a super expansive world with tons of quests and skulls. Tons of people already play it as if it's a single player game. So making it into one on purpose by increasing exp and drop rates could be a ton of fun for a lot of people.
---
70+ range for black dhide and rcb, optionally but recommended 75 range for toxic blowpipe. 40+ prayer, recommended 44 or as high as you can get. 
---
Best method: kill the things without being killed yourself. There are hundreds of guides on youtube about levels/inventory/praying/anything you could ever want or need, check those out.
---
Nice idea but wrong place to have the content. 
---
Plus these would have a massive impact to the current slayer meta, these would be such a must have for basically every task.

Shots fired

If you want to farm vorkath, bgs would probably be a good idea yea
---
You look like you used a discount coupon for the makeover mage 'operation'
---
I'm going to be honest with you. A bond is really hard to aquire on a f2p account. I suggest you get a membership for $11 for a month. If you look up a guide on how to make money on a p2p account, you might be able to sustain an account with bonds then

that would crash the value of DWH if shamans dropped them lets be real

I'm not headset on a membership tho. I'm saying like if I start making enough money f2p to buy s bond then I'll go p2p but if not then I'll stay f2p. I've got a large steam library that I haven't played half of lmao. I'm in no rush for more game content
---
This actually fits the original gower brothers design theory. One of their very first posts after rs2 released spoke about people who only wanted to be 'pure rangers' or 'pure magers' being able to play the game fairly so they adjusted the combat formula to the way it is now (which blows my mind that they were conscious of pures existing all the way in runescape classic). Even though pures may be considered a niche playstyle to some, they actually aren't and have always been in mind in development of the original game and basic content like a skill should be fully accessible to them.
---
Yes.

I murder men and women in cold blood for the clue scroll drop.

I‚Äôll buy them off you if you give me then as well as 10m

---
Guys what's Obama's last name?????
---
unfortunately you are dreaming, friend
---
Way less dps is a huge overstatement. At most monsters with respectable defense, MSBi is within a 2-5% difference. Usually the shield slot more than makes up for that, notably at Zulrah and Gorillas where you can get in an extra trip with the crystal shield defense bonus to block some range hits.  (you should use BoL but equip the Crystal Shield when their predictable 50/50 mage/range attack is known to be)
---
Look up Oziris guide, it‚Äôs a good starter point for irons. Follow it for a bit then do what you want as you figure it out.

The wiki is going to be your greatest resource, keep it open while you play. If you look up a specific item you want it will tell you where its sold and what monsters drop it. I'm a 1200 total hc so I've recently done the beginning of an iron. 
---
Most early armors/weapons can be bought from shops. There's platelegs and plateskirts in al kharid, platebodies in varrock etc... Most of them stock up to mithril or adamant. Rune armor is sold in the champion's guild. As you're ftp thats as far as you can go. The next step after rune would be untradeables like the fighter torso, d def, nezzy helm, barrows gloves etc... Id definitely recommend members if you can afford it.
---
Took me a few seconds to get. Funny af
---
Lvl?
---
Yes you can, but it calculates the attack off of your current magic level so you will hit less until you restore.
---
Oh ok. Good to know thank you

So nice of vorkath to turn it off for you.

That's like saying if you want to do Raids *efficiently* you need an Avernic. For a lot of them you can get by just fine with BGS or hell even just DDS.  AFAIK some of them actually prefer a DDS outright.

170-200 kills/hr if you're praying range and using a BP with mithril darts.  Take out about 30% kills if you use RCB or MSBi

If you're looking for a cheap laptop that isn't shit and has a warranty then search for laptops that are refurbished or overstock, certain manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, Acer etc. all have their own clearance sections for refurbished or discounted computers on their online stores.

Barrows is kinda shit xp since I do it with Trident, I've never actually made teletabs, but yeah like you said slow.

I can kill Zulrah with just 75 range 80 mage? Never tried it before. My gear is pretty bad tho. I guess I could get void but rn my best gear is blessed dhide for range and mystic+occult+seers helm+ma2 cape for mage. I have trident and blowpipe, 45 def 52 pray.

Sometime during the 2000's I went without internet for a long time and this is exactly what I did. I got a couple p servers dloaded and played that shit singleplayer, even Fucked around editing random stuff to my liking. It is fun for a while but imo it gets old quickly being the only player and your accomplishments don't feel as good either.
---
Well, I can't complain. I am playing Slayerscape. I'm only 10 levels from 2 of the tasks anyway, so maybe ill just train slayer up more. 
---
But yeah, ill figure it out, might just do the more cliky methods or just alch  lol. Enchanting jewlry isnt too bad cost wise ive seen but its a bit clicky as well.

Big oof

The d spear was my urban legend when I was super young. Was told fire elements dropped them so I just camped then and never got it. I could of killed almost anything and had access to it on rdt.
---
&gt; Why do a lot of guides for late-game content recommend base 85 or base 90 melees
---
They probably don't feel like doing calcs tbh so they come up with an arbitrary level range that sounds about right.
---
&gt;but then advice for melee skilling is usually to get Atk/Def to around 75/80 and then train strength to 99?
---
They're also wrong. In terms of levels, the average DPS increase per level is always favoring Strength regardless of levels (at least after level 70, pre-70 it's kind of weird bc of how much Strength bonus you get from new weapons so training Attack to be higher might be better at times, IDK the exact numbers). Ideally you'd keep your Strength like 7-13 levels higher than Attack, with the gap getting smaller as your levels get higher because you need more and more XP for Strength levels which slows down the rate your XP/hr increases. I just tell people to keep their STR 10 lvls higher than ATK because it's simpler to remember.
---
I don't pay $11 to be treated like this
---
Would only matter on the acid phase though. Damage negated on ice phase once the 6th basic lands.

But yeah, I too try to squeeze in one more attack on the acid phase.

There's DEFINITELY not 0 progit. RC is the most profitable skill to 99 (via normal methods) by a mile. Double nats to 99 will net 200+M easily
---
It really hits the spot am I right
---
Newbsrus, might be a bit too high idk what you consider mid tier.
---
You are an amazing person. Thank you so much :')
---
Some notes that may help some people:
---
   -If RuneLite is downloaded in a drive other than your C drive, you will have to include a '/d' after 'cd' in the first line of the bat file. For example, "cd /d A:\Games\RuneLite" (I am a Windows user, I don't know if this works on other operating systems)
---
   -I had to turn off Anti-Aliasing under my GPU settings in RuneLite, otherwise I had really bad graphics issues. But they completely disappeared once I turned the setting off.
---
Other than that, it's working great! Thank you again, kind sir!
---
Still less profitable then just killing monsters that drop natures.
---
I don‚Äôt mind what the chances are

Someone accused someone else in my CC of RWT a few days ago, solely because they had 400M but didn't know how to flip yet. So hey, it's not just you?
---
If only jumping to conclusions gave agility xp.
---
A fair opinion but mine is slightly different.
---
As a newer player with lower stats I made decent gp training rc (relatively speaking).
---
I remember rcing single nats, then double cosmics, single deaths and then double astrals before eventually switching over to Zeah methods.
---
At the time of my account, making 500K - 1M gp/hour was really nice and helped progress my account.
---
I guess my point is: if you leave training rc until you are a higher level with access to better moneymakers then it must feel like an awful skill. If you bite the bullet and train it as a lower levelled player, it isn‚Äôt so bad.
---
Explain why not?  It actually requires multiple skills to
---
Be done, and requires skill to complete to gain max exp/hr. I‚Äôm sorry you couldn‚Äôt find friends to help you. Or that you were required to actually pay attention to the game and not afk.
---
Lol theres nothing much i cant do but laugh it off, stoop to their level? me? never ;) and thank you &lt;3
---
I am starting to learn barrows and I am killing all 6 brothers every run, I wanted to know, what is the best combination of monsters to kill in the tunnels? I have tried 3 skeletons but this gets me above 88% and I have the chance of getting bolt racks, so I am unsure of what to kill. Please help!
---
If you don't wish to pay much for a buyable skill then choose a cheaper method? It's like complaining that mahogany furniture is too expensive to make. Do something that you can afford? If you can't afford runners then do lavas. If you can't afford to do lavas then maybe do ZMI?
---
If you do pre scouted solos and average like 70K-80K points per hour personally I‚Äôd stick to those. Mainly because you always get the drop and can‚Äôt get sniped. The way I do it is just scouting on two accounts and finding a raid, holding it then doing it and scouting on the 2nd account if the raid I‚Äôm in has Ice/Thief and try to have another ready when I finish. 
---
That being said. IIRC the most efficient are 2+2‚Äôs, 3+2 or 5+2 with other people scouting during the raids to have another one immediately after. 
---
Personally if you can sustain 70-80K/hr and efficiently no prep/never die I‚Äôd just solo.
---
Not a fan of slayer
---
Don‚Äôt even waste your time with these assholes. Nothing will please them. Just miserable ass guys that take pride in ruining other people‚Äôs fun.
---
Any reason you‚Äôre trying to get 200m xp in the two most cancerous skills in the game?
---
Huh I get 2.5-3m a hr at rune dragons.
---
My only worry is players constantly being given access to harder hitting weapons but not access to higher healing food and 99hp now feels too small in comparison with harder hitting weapons.
---
Im not suggesting increasing hp cap btw.
---
I understand the ‚Äúgame needs updates to survive‚Äù argument but my personal view is that I would be happy for 0 new updates for 2 years+
---
Ok then don‚Äôt try to minimize the low xp rates by saying that you can hire runners? Acknowledge that hiring runners isn‚Äôt a viable training method for 90% of the player base? A method of training that isn‚Äôt accessible to 90% of a player base can‚Äôt be used as a bandaid solution to slow xp?

Get 60 attack to be able to use the dscim then go for 70 strength, yeah. After that you probably want to get 60 defence to be able to equip the dragon defender and then work on whatever you want. Optionally get torso at some point during this since you're able to equip it

you can as long as you don't unequip it, but then again why would you? so just grind that 75 and then GL with Sereen :)
---
‚ÄòYou‚Äôre just an elitist prick ‚Äòi‚Äôm not flaming‚Äô
---
Poll system means majority rules. If the things you enjoy on the game don't fall in line with the majority you're more or less wasting your time playing because those things will never get the updates you want.
---
it's not a bad game by any means.  
---
at least ironman mode where there is minimal mtx.
---
How many elite clues did you get?
---
Name checks out.
---
I mean if he lost his virginity that means he was never involuntarily celebate in the first place since it proves he can get laid
---
I actually don't use that plug-in. I use the clue scroll plug-in for cryptic clues.
---
&gt; Prissy Scilla has stopped wandering off and will now stay closer to home.
---
Most impactful update in years
---
I know how to solve puzzle boxes, but I‚Äôd rather do it in 5 seconds then 2 minutes.
---
~~&gt;Lmfao never heard this one. Is there a pic for it?~~
---
Never mind, found it.
---
Yum
---
To be fair I think the suggestions were kind of mediocre to begin with. Does suck a little more didn't pass though we needed more to make this worthwhile. Hopefully Jagex comes up with some new interesting ideas for it. 
---
Surprised you expected the rune b shield to pass though that was the one I was almost positive wasn't going to pass lol. You have to remember that's not nostalgia for a good percentage of player a lot of people didn't play in the area that was out.
---
The spec rate, yes.
---
Happy cake day.
---
The difference is one is convenient for him personally and one isn't. So one is ObViouSly cheating.
---
Congrats!
---
Yes and no, I only do Vork with dhcb, but I also slay in a fighter torso and obby legs. I do slayer without owning a rapier, just seems like Hassle if you wait for best of everything. Started raiding at 80 cmbs btw.
---
Rigour will be more worthwhile if you do things other than vorkath, if you‚Äôre only killing vorkath go for dhcb, just know once you get it you won‚Äôt be able to kill him with a blowpipe again
---
Yeah it emails to you're registered email. With a Button &amp; a link you can copy to youre browser if it doesnt work. Everytime i do either of those it tells me the link is expired.
---
right now
---
Big buff to Blade Of Saeldor, Nice.
---
hol up
---
Depending on your username, maybe he just remembers his account name wrong?
---
Except LMS is exactly that, an actual PKer vs PKer minigame, and the community voted against any worthwhile reward thus ensuring this minigame is dead on arrival. You've all guaranteed that normal PKing, and killing PVMers, is more profitable than this minigame. 
---
So in the end, that entire narrative is just bullshit virtue signaling and doesn't actually mean anything.
---
Girls are known to go after shit you are emotionally attached to just to hurt you.
---
Yeah, man.   I just finished monkey madness yesterday because I couldn't be bothered with it Haha.   Finally got my d scimmy though, so it was worth it.
---
Add the stale baguette to that list as well. Should be in the fancy dress box with the other random event items!
---
What are the fixes for BH worlds? I have dabbled a little with pking in f2p and with a few different brackets in p2p bh and the end result was always the same. I'd end up losing a shit ton of money on average because I just wasnt good enough compared to all of the other pkers that have only been pking for the last few years, this ended up in me pretty quickly stopping even trying to contend. I think the barrier to entry is what is causing the decline - new people starting to try to pk are going to have a torrid time getting continually stacked out and just wont enjoy it.
---
Yes, the blade is viable now. The armor is more expensive to run.
---
Wait, pink? Am I colour-blind? Isn't it purple?
---
found the pvp loserboi, you probably want curses too
---
Entitlement and people thinking they can just strong arm whatever they want into and out of the game is what bought out the worst people in the community.
---
Looks like a Tool album cover.
---
There was just a system update.. lol
---
Which is fucking silly they need to buff the amour charges. Rn it‚Äôs like re-obtaining void every week
---
Completely safe death PvM does this as well. So is that also cheating and against game integrity?
---
Came here to say this, underrated update. I don't remember the names of most of the farmers but I sure as hell know hers.
---
Lootboxes were a lazy idea.
---
So was giving a PvM item attachment (guthix staff) to a PvM weapon (sotd) from a fucking PvP source.
---
They were terrible ideas, that's why they failed.
---
I wrote proc but didn't see the autocorrect.
---
Ty lol
---
Some private servers have had group ironman for a long time now lmao.
---
That's literally just the culinaromancer fights
---
Well it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm looking for so it‚Äôs not for me
---
That's completely different...?
---
just cast bind, snare or entangle so it doesn't move
---
Yes its at an all time high for bots and gold farmers is losing all the players it bought in from mobile release slowly because player retention sucks.
---
Pretty far off tbh, I need 70 Defence and Prayer (68&amp;65), i need to kill a Mithril Dragon and i only got 76 range, i need to do B A to get the granite body and the biggest obstacle is that i need 75 smith and i only got 60. So i won't be completing the diary any time soon.
---
pvmers dont like pkers killing them in wild then votes no for rewards for an update that would probably take some of them out and into a pvp minigame instead.
---
Pure brainlet logic unfortunatly.
---
4-6 is optimal team size, although most worlds will strictly enforce 4 only and become really toxic if you dont hop. They will all leave whilst flaming you in most cases
---
I got one of those emails, I'm currently not playing so I changed my password, checked I still had auth and out everything in my bank. Fingers crossed I don't get hacked lol
---
or, just cute kittens...
---
Woox would do it blindfolded while playing something else after 3 days
---
My friend using prayer potions in nmz
---
what do you mean, like everything passed except that lousy rune shield from rs3
---
I'd love to, of course with credits to the creator
---
If the darts are useless they‚Äôd likely be dogshit gp/xp. Amethyst will hold its value with bolt tips are arrows but the darts will be dirt cheap. Even if the xp was good it would be too expensive to be realistic
---
You! Take my arrow pointing up!
---
This looks incredible
---
No, it was woox's video. The guy pretty much schooled the dev's on all the issues the LOS changes would have on the rest of the game. Devs took the lazy way and just applied the changes to PvP instead
---
When I was a kid I called it karamanja
---
I don‚Äôt even know where the n came from
---
The polling system is the best mechanic osrs has. It would be vastly different without it
---
It's not under settings. There's a tab on the right, just click through and you'll find it.
---
Castle wars is pretty busy whenever I go by, those are cosmetics only
---
Dammit, u got me. Take my upvote
---
This took me too long to get...
---
And new skills? Same argument can be made for skills: any skilling update is so hollowed out since people can't agree on what is "new and fun", there's always a minority which dislikes detail A of a change and thus votes no.
---
The requirements for a BH bot were absurdly low compared to say something like a wyvern/kurask/Zulrah bot. So yes BH bot farms brought 10 times more in than your average bot (obviously if you add all sorts of PvM bot togethers, they bring in more than BH bots).
---
But I agree that PvPers shouldn't be punished for a fuck-up Jagex made, so I'll retract that statement.
---
From loot update:
---
&gt;Players who contribute a fair amount now receive a drop on Zalcano's better loot table. The quantities of items received scale based how much they have contributed. Everybody above a certain threshold of contributing will also have a chance of receiving any of the unique drops, including the pet. This chance scales based on much a player has contributed. The MVP still receives Zalcano's additional drop, but from the "lesser" drop table - closing the previously wide gap between the highest contributor and everybody else. This design is aimed to maintain the incentive to be the highest contributor but improve the fairness of the system.
---
Yes, smaller groups with slightly slower kills are better.  This is because the quantities of loot scale based on "contribution," i.e damage.  More people in the room means everyone does relatively less damage.  
---
The group should be large enough to be able to down Zalcano the first time the blue circles come up after everyone has made it to the imbue altar (so usually the second total time the circles appear), provided that the group is also large enough to kill Zalcano in 3 stages.  
---
This can be easily accomplished with just 4 people, sometimes even 3 with high levels and luck.  Adding more people than that not only significantly diminishes the loot each individual player will receive, it doesn't even speed up kills all that much, because you usually have to wait for the blue circles anyway, and more people during the mining phase only saves a few seconds.  Only a mob can down zalcano immediately on imbue, but at that point each person is barely doing any damage and so the individual loot will be mostly garbage.

I got one around the same kc this morning, didn‚Äôt realise it was 10m until 20 minutes ago lol
---
I got a shield left half while bursting them the other day. I dont think it's as rare as the d chain but I still cried
---
Honestly they should get rid of this guy... Or all non-unique costume random events really. But he in particular makes no sense. "Oh hey I'm here to ask you kindly if you'd like to go to jail!" Like no obviously I'm not going to do that
---
I know, thinking they‚Äôre so macho, they just follow the mainstream...sheep I tell ya
---
right on! Saved, thanks!

Yeah, such a pain all around.

Team Rargh btw

I‚Äôm only on 35 kc and I‚Äôm getting antsy to see a drop

I've just finished my last task of the elite western diary and the 1000 Chompy kills made me want to kill myself.
---
All I see is a chalice.
---
What did he say, before he deleted his comment?
---
Or have a possibility of triple jad pets from inferno.
---
Some of those aren't minor changes.
---
A new skill is very controversial to bring into the game.
---
Majority of players don't find skills like fletching,crafting etc fun. This is a big reason it failed.
---
So If a new skill comes into the game, it either has to be fun (which, tbh is very hard to do in Osrs), or the rewards for it need to add something fun to the game - again very hard to do.
---
We've seen 3 skills come and fail. It's good to figure out what the reason is
---
I knew it was super rare, I just was too lazy to do the calculations, thanks for letting me know! These items are going in my ‚Äúrare/expensive tab‚Äù, that 3rd age bed is never leaving my bank lol
---
&gt;I use Runelite with most features turned off
---
Then just use the vanilla client if you're so against third-party clients. 
---
And if you're so for "integrity" then you'd learn the cryptic clues and figure it out yourself.
---
Went from level 1 construction to about 30 during my grind from 50-85fm. Definitely a nice boost
---
If you just want it for a diary, find a video about a Zulrah helper website. You put in the first one or two forms and it will tell you the rest of the fight. I think LinksOcarina had a vid on it.
---
To be honest, you can take 25% of OSRS population out, considering it's bots. With jmods confirming they banned 50k bots in 1 day, it's shocking how many there are, but I imagine the dips in population is a result of bots no longer functions due to;  
---
1) Excessive banning  
---
2) Change in content (i.e. pvp emblem farming)
---
I'm not doing it as a spoiled child: I honestly feel that the game would be better if pvp just gets removed. I feel that that would improve the overall community feeling. What is a community that tries to kill each other? That's not a community I wish to be part of.
---
So each new update to pvp is most certainly bringing more people to do actually go kill others: I do not want that, I want them gone.
---
On top of that I feel there is already too much focus on gaining items from combat, and any update will most certainly bring more items.
---
For gods sake man get yourself a rune pouch
---
Fair enough, the paragraph after the list explains how it may appear legit and that's what I meant.
---
It went from 5m to 30m and now 10m rofl
---
Why even live?
---
You must be the only skiller in the game who wants better xp rates,  the negativity in clans like Olympus (ironmeme asshats that just sit and circle-jerk each others hate towards an extra 2xp/hour meta change) when better rates are even vaguely mentioned is absurd.  
---
I'm sure pvp and pvm'ers are the ones who do vote for better xp rates as that means they have to spend less time doing shitty slow skills, its skillers that want their "accomplishments" to remain the same.
---
I think this whole discussion got out of hand. There is nothing wrong with QOL runelite features. I was discussing about being a MASSIVE help while completing TOB. That's an integrity issue.
---
why does she live with her parents? this isnt a child's game

I mean you don't really need rng when you're doing the method by castle wars where you just constantly place toads on the ground.  Please tell me you didn't do it another way.

You could argue that but it would be pointless ranting. Your side immediately shows as someone that‚Äôs irked by losing their items in the only zone in the game where you‚Äôre made abundantly aware that you can be attacked by players and you‚Äôll lose your items to another player if you‚Äôre attacked there.
---
Fucking got me, lmao.
---
Hey if you get it to a good spot will you share a how-to here with some tips?
---
Laughed at trip jads pet
---
I appreciate my jad pet go get the zuk pet of you dont like him

Definitely includes shield damage, yoinking MVP from people who afk til circles is like taking candy from a baby
---
I can see where you're coming from. 
---
But aren't raids STILL end-game content? There's so much more than what the plug-ins show? You still need to know when/how to efficiently gear switch, how many pots to bring in, what mechanics each boss has (including P3 Verzik). 
---
I feel like before you can really get the most out of these plug-ins you'd still need to be competent enough to complete it without them. Seeing streamers use it, it looks like it just makes the rooms smoother. I wouldn't say it's "broken" because someone fresh to this kind of content can't just run in and do it.
---
the plugin is called "Time Tracking" make sure you have that enabled, and you'll [see this icon](https://i.imgur.com/ZeVZiTT.png) on the sidebar
---
Isn‚Äôt clear if that means they‚Äôre starting value will be that or if they just raised the ammonia you could charge to.
---
Let's hope so. 
---
I play the game to pk, the proposed change is a good one. I just wish the attachment to make it better would cost a bit more. 
---
Still won't change much on the low level end. 
---
G maulers probably will just move towards 31 prayer and will risk even less.

Yes the blade is comparable to scythe nearly everywhere apart from tob. Scythe costs like 1k a swing, the blade costs around 40gp

My highest is like 23 or something ludicrous like that.

Level up a bit more and you should learn the move Entangle.

Fishing, woodcutting, cannonball smithing, and motherload mine are my favorite afk activities. Fishing karambwans sounds like exactly what you are asking for because the spot doesn‚Äôt move so you just fish for a couple minutes until your invent is full.

Outside of ToB the Rapier is supreme. The blade is only useful inside of ToB given that the rapier costs 0 gp per swing.
---
Eh, it's pretty quick now that the world hop limit was removed. I usually buy 150 at a time because I'm cheap, and it doesn't take long to pick up a few thousand. I also use them for demonic gorillas and Ahrim.
---
Yeah, so much more refreshing than that other shit. A lot of these gaming Youtubers like to insult the intelligence of their audience. I remember this one fellar used the word conative, then there was a short interlude with the definition of the word on the screen. I asked him why he used the word if he didn‚Äôt think his audience would understand what it means, he responded by saying ‚Äúlol thanks for the free view‚Äù.

Idk man I‚Äôm just sayin take a deep breath and smile. No need to let yourself get worked up! S‚Äôall good!

I would agree with you if anything else was going down. Rapier went up 10mil this week and arma is back to its 41mil/36mil nearly all-time high.

---
Hm. That‚Äôs weird. Idk why rapier went up or Arma. Because Arma in the first place has always been grotesquely over priced and Rapier; that‚Äôs just odd. Idk I‚Äôd still watch it and I‚Äôd say scythe will stable or just find its equilibrium. It‚Äôs still obnoxiously OP in basically every room, and ToB is still 5M+/hr.

The speed that you can kill them.  The mage bonus from the book helps a bunch.  It‚Äôs not a profitable task at all so no need to try and make money on it.  Eat the couple prayer pot cost and move onto the next task and hope it‚Äôs a good one.

How hard is the SotE boss for max combat with most BiS gear? I do a ton of Slayer etc but I don't actually do much bossing so I'm not super familiar with boss difficulty.

Ahh to be honest mate I personally use very little supplies. Like 1 in 5 kills I might need to take a sip of p pot but that's about it. The food is just there in case of an emergency. But yeah, I agree it's basically dead content for a main. Much rather just do Vorkath, even without a dhcb it's still better than this shite.

It take a long time to train but while you train it your leveling your combat at the same time. High level slayer 85+ will make you a lot of money. But thing to do is train slayer and complete quests

SO ZAMORAK - AND THAT'S THE BLOODY THING ABOUT HIM - HE REPRESENTS CHAOS, IN FACT, HE'S AN AGENT OF CHAOS, AND IN CONTRAST, WE HAVE SARADOMIN, WHO REPRESENTS ORDER, ROUGHLY SPEAKING. BUT SARADOMIN, IN HIS BITTER RESENTMENT, IN HIS-HIS POSTMODERN CULTURAL MARXIST IDEOLOGY, HE TRIES TO TAME THE CHAOS - AND THAT'S A BAD IDEA MAN, IT'S LIKE-IT'S LIKE IF YOU TRIED TAMING WINTERTODT, IT'S JUST GOING TO LEAVE YOU BURNT. BUT SARADOMIN, HE TRIES ANYWAY, MOTIVATED BY A LUST FOR POWER AND GP - AND IT'S LIKE - GOD ITS SO SAD - ITS LIKE YOU'RE NOT A GOOD GUY! YOU'RE NOT A GOOD GUY, AND NO POSTMODERN RATIONALIZATION WILL CHANGE THAT. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR. THE LITERATURE IS EXPLICIT ON THIS MATTER. AND SPEAKING OF TAMING WT - WHAT HAPPENS BY THE END OF A ROUND? THE FIRE IS NOT TAMED, QUITE THE OPPOSITE, IT'S ACTUALLY RISING. AND THIS DEMONSTRATES EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 3RD AGE. AND IT'S LIKE SOLZHENITSYN WRITES IN THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO - THE BLOODY MARXIST SARADOMINISTS ATTEMPTED TO QUELL FIRE, BUT IN DOING SO THEY MERELY FUELED IT. AND WELL ACTUALLY, THEY DID QUITE A BIT MORE. YOU CAN'T PRETEND TO BE A GOOD GUY IF YOU'RE NOT. WE TRIED THAT EXPERIMENT IN THE 20TH CENTURY, AND IT WAS A BAD IDEA MAN! AND IT. IS. NOT. A. ROUTE. YOU. WANT. TO. GO. DOWN.
---
Do essential quests. You find them on the osrs wiki trough "optimal Quest Guide". After that you are free to do whatever you want. Train combat and later do Slayer, do runecrafting, quest more(is a good Option because it gives you Goals for skills you need to train next).  But be warned slayer is the slowest skill to train. But high slayer is essential for good money. Same goes for RC.
---
I mean, a gf only costs 50k
---
I asked this question and people said they wanted better drops and better xp rates. I get what they're saying I guess, but it's not going to change anything for me as I only went there for Kurasks before and this doesn't make the other monsters any more alluring.
---
Which do people prefer, "dead" content like castle wars and clan wars, or alive content like ba, pc, and fishing trawler?
---
Making a mini game "worth" doing is dumb because it's basically the same as forcing people to do it. 
---
Also you're acting like there's no rewards for Lms when there actually are, play competitive and actually risk something if you want reward from PvP.
---
Pretty much no skills have variation.
---
Slayer is as close to variation as it gets and it's still just "go kill this monster, cool now kill this one" for hundreds of hours.
---
Not hard, just gimmicky. Eat to full health whenever she does her wind up attack. Trident and mage gear, blowpipe to kill crystals that heal her. Inventory is brews and restores, easy 2 minute fight probably.
---
I just get triggered when I get killed by someone who‚Äôs obviously a new pker. Idk why
---
she's pretty easy, she only has 1 dangerous attack, which deals 98 damage so watch a guide so you know when that attack is coming  and can eat before and after. If you take 20 brews 7 restores you will have more than enough food.
---
RNG means 
---
random number generator
---
RANDOM
---
The drop rate doesn‚Äôt remember how many you have killed and doesn‚Äôt care what the average rate is.

A player needs 2 sceptres: one to make an Occult altar, another one for teleports. And if using this stash, then one needs even 3 of them! Or keeping 3 bank spaces for menaphite's.
---
I am not an ironman, but I was very lucky to get 2 sceptres in PP (both in one day which is a myracle). But when I got this clue I was kinda mad. Why, oh why do I need the third of these rare and precious things?!
---
I don't think there could be an argument. There are lots of sets and individual items which could be stored both in PoH and shashes. A head bandana, Pete's shirts, etc etc. Elite and Master emote clues often use clue rewards, and any of them can be stored in 2 places at once (in 2 copies). What of that, why it is any bad? :) And the menaphite is a nice cosmetic outfitm pretty much for costume room. Since it can be used as desert clothing, this would allow clean the bank of any desert items save boots.

Honestly if your primary concern is GP/hr and you got consistent teams/runs you‚Äôd be crazy to not buy a Scythe now (or maybe wait a few more days if you‚Äôre greedy about it dropping more) especially if rapier stays back at like 150-160M. Because as long as that‚Äôs happening ToB will still be master race for profit. And I personally think Scythe is well worth it‚Äôs cost.

Theres a google doc somewhere out there. I'll edit if I can find it.

its 1/1001 though

Wintertodt doesnt provide the bext wc xp/h. Tho i still concur.

worst feeling when you see your hp take the hit for the bolts to activate then he negates the damage :(

Can you put this one up, please?
---
[Where?](https://imgur.com/gallery/XjZYh2W)
---
Well most of the differences are because pkers REE so hard at anything that could possibly make pking slightly easier. Where this time it's because it totally messed up the balance of a lot of pvm activities (e.g. barrows being easily safespottable)
---
You can tell the fella who bumped his head was trying his hardest not to burst out laughing lol

Which one was your least favorite to get to 80? Currently doing the same thing and I'm dreading Thieving more than anything...
---
If you have a slash weapon equipped you don‚Äôt even need a knife.
---
Not time, but money. Money is time. They're pretty expensive and don't get recycled.  I'd have to go through some math but I doubt the dps increase is worth the cost difference between Broad Bolts (basically free and 72%-80% conserved) versus Bolt Racks (expensive and 0% conserved which means more time doing pretty low GP/hr options).
---
Just did, kid

No problem man!

Remember that time you went on reddit just to make fun of how someone else plays a video game in a less-efficient way than you? 
---
I'm surprised you didn't go all the way and tell him that any fun he might be having doing raids is invalid because they're not fast enough.
---
u/virtoso
---
Thieving isnt that bad its just click intensive, the exp rates are pretty high compared to other skills. If you know how to blackjack properly
---
Probably thieve or construction as most of them was done afk whilst at work
---
I don't always feel like a complete loser who only ever achieved anything in a video game called osrs but when I do I make sure to take out my lack of getting laid on fellow 'scapers :)
---
It's used in the Family Crest quest, and honestly there are so many locations that are only used for a single quest, that's an entire discussion in and of itself.
---
Welcome man. Looking forward to the gains!
---
Quite. You can test yourself
---
If we had the thing from rs3 where you get a free loot re roll every 3 clues and you can stack up to 3 re rolls i would start doing clues again. I would even farm them.
---
Would always say Traverly instead of Taverly as a kid, and Burthorpe as Burthope. Ardougne was Adragoon.
---
Not how it works not sure what to tell you
---
You can attempt Zulrah. You can do giant mole but don't really recommend. Barrows of course. Those are just 3 off the top of my head.
---
Close enough
---
Fishing bots lower the price of some lobsters, and tanning bots make some money on margins.  The real problem comes from zulrah bots, revenant bots, and what used to be emblem bots
---
Just a brainlet
---
It's only on the first phase that you should be attacking on the same tick. I usually switch to diamond (e) for the hit lined up with his special to avoid the situation.

If it's fun the official world will have players like castle wars. If not it will fail as it should if it's not enjoyable.

Should he do the tbow new game plus now or later considering his stats and pvm exp and bank size?

Nah you can still get the pet
---
Mid level goals, you pretty much have everything already, in my opinion. Make sure you have the run energy pool.
---
High level goals:
---
- Superior Garden: 90 for the best pool, 85 for fairy ring
---
- Achievement Gallery: 90 for mage altar, 91 for jewelry
---
- Portal Nexus: 92 for all teleports. Only as a space save though since you already can have teleports from 50
---
- Costume room: A whole bunch of stuff, for example 82 for the mahogany armour case

Oh ok nice

The rewards are rolled when you open the box, not when you earn it.

I‚Äôve done a lot of zulrah revs Sara a little bit of cerb and loads of dks

You can get one kill easily by flinching the whole fight. Just use a good crush weapon on both phases. Walk under boss, attack, then walk right back under. There will be video guides on how to flinch KQ

Beacon Ring from What Lies Below is +2/+1, which is pretty much the exact same thing as Lunar Ring.

Just try it, you will see hordes of chompies spawn at the same time, it's amazing. It's not exactly 1:1, sometimes a toad just fails, but there's no limit to how many chompies can spawn given enough toads.

Is casual racism in the comments usually a thing in this sub?

If you post an item to sell and someone already has a higher price in, it goes to the highest bidder instantly for whatever price they offered
---
If you post an item to sell and there are no higher offers currently, it'll sell for whatever price you listed it at when someone posts a buy order at that price or higher and there are no cheaper ones on the market
---
Thank you, friend

I have a main but is it easy on a pure? I've done cox and zulrah on my pure
---
Fairytale and Penguin.
---
Yeah! My dad and I have been doing them forever. 
---
Through my experience, the more honest you are, the more they will pump them out to you. I get 1 every other day for the most part ranging from 10 cents up to $2!
---
Where Slayer wins out though is that you have to gear differently and interact with the enemies differently.
---
Fighting Metal Dragons is different from fighting Kurasks.  Running Nature runes is the same input as running almost any other rune.  Slow EXP also means you spend more time in the boring muck of early levels before it does get different.
---
RC just needs different ways to train at early levels.  High level RC is profitable enough to be its own justification, but getting there is boring.
---
What are those side tabs you have?
---
I thought it was a spade simulator
---
Close to 1M coin, around level 60 farming loot, a bunch of cooking xp. Still *very* good.
---
Once every day or so. Right now I have $22.50 in my account. I hardly ever buy anything off the playstore, but I just bought a bond and a flight simulator game!
---
Just wait for that feeling when there's no more summer breaks ever again.
---
Just for my image of incel. So they kinda hate woman and find it weird they do not get laid?
---
Mine are the opposite. Ive had 97 slayer for a year on the main.

After you mate üòÇ

Thats a runelite plugin mate.

This exact idea has already been proposed. Seems like you just changed the picture and called it your own

you need a better job...

LMS has big potential to pull new PVPers in, myself included, decent rewards would certainly be a nice incentive.
---
I'll start. I just hit 60 agility yesterday. While training at the Canifis agility course, I would take breaks between laps to buy out the raw meat and sharks at the food store nearby the start point. I saw it as a way of using my run energy and getting cheap meat for pizzas.
---
I had it down to a science. Hop worlds, finish lap, buy 26 meat. 3 more laps and the store is restocked. Buy it, hop worlds, do a lap, and so on. I ended up turning some of it into cheap curry, some into cheap meat pizzas, and some of it is waiting for my next cooking session. 
---
Unfortunately, it cut into my agility exp. I think I capped out at 8900 agility exp/hour. I'm now set on food though! Here's the final result: https://i.imgur.com/Wwi4oFS.jpg

Wait a minute.

???
---
The people that made the game left a long time ago.
---
Good luck! No lie 93-99 took me ~6 months playing 2-5hrs a day.. but you‚Äôll make bank and it is an extremely satisfying 99 to hit and a dank cape to flex.
---
I never unlocked boss tasks.. would often do boss versions of monsters tho (blues = vork, hellhounds = cerb, dags = dks, kalaphite = KQ, etc)
---
I play a hcim account.
---
what about thighs?
---
no reason to fix it if your cart's not full
---
what gets me, though, is the people who will stand there for over a minute waiting for someone else to fix it. such a waste
---
Make sure you are very clear it is an either xx cmb /or xx slayer requirement.  I'm seeing a lot of people in comments here who seem to have confused it for "change the requirement to slayer level only"
---
Lol this is the same community that rioted over a rainbow scarf. I'm not even surprised anymore.

Posting on this post

Morning in which timezone?

---
Sounds like it was hacked and sold. You could try contacting in a jmod but even in the unlikely event of an unban, it's quite likely it would be hacked again.
---
Sorry :(
---
Part of it could also be that since most people will have higher str than att or def, saying base 90 sort of implies 90 att and def, but something closer to 99 str. It's also just easier to say one number than 3. 
---
You can definitely start doing some high level pvm at your level, but keep in mind that levels are much more important than gear, generally. For example, at base 85 stats, a maxed gear account (minus scythe) does less dps to graardor than a base 99 account with rags (normal whip, neitz, fury, torso, obby legs, fire cape, dragon def, barrows gloves, dragon boots, zerk ring (i)). If you find yourself struggling to do damage, level your stats instead of grinding money for gear. I wouldn't train def with melee unless you are 99 att and def, since you can get it much faster chinning or barraging. Barraging for slayer will get you a ton of defense exp.
---
Nice try Mr. Spadehunter
---
Teams aren't crazy bad. 
---
When they do hit it's almost always too early and you're near full supplies. 
---
Then you just run south prioritizing protection from melee as long as the guy on you has specs left.
---
Well, not trying to rub it in because I'm already getting down voted, but I'm on course to make 100K for this year and play mobile the entire 12 hours I'm at work.  Just sayin you've got options my friend
---
I'm loving these responses
---
I wish gathering supplies wasn't almost guaranteed to be the least efficient method.  Any supplies I have come from grinding EXP on a gathering skill, and oftentimes the efficient EXP method doesn't produce the good materials (like Woodcutting Maples past 75 or whatever).
---
I think people do cannonball alts cause those are really afk
---
Yes in osrs. He did it like 6 months ago
---
I've tried a ton for hybrid practicing. Their combat system always feels off.
---
He does have 99
---
Thanks, sis!
---
Maybe he hangs out in the sewer because the skeletons that were down there were once is Slayer companions who have died on task so he mourns their death all day everyday
---
how high are you combat stats?
---
Originally when you created a character you had a choice for class: fighter, ranger, or wizard.  It only affected starting levels and equipment - but the point is you're right, they always intended for, and knew pures would be a thing.
---
Personally I play as a skiller because it's more aesthetically/thematically pleasing to me. It feels so weird having an account that's good at everything. It only feels more natural and "realistic" if my account was good at some things and bad at others.
---
Stealing Creation and Shooting Stars were so fun, would be a nice lil update if they were put in!
---
Thank you so much! Well I don‚Äôt have alot spirit seeds in my bank so not worth to include them :D
---
*I* care.
---
If I'm playing, I'm probably high tbh.  It's just a really relaxing way to zone out after work and make some progress along the way in skills I normally couldn't be bothered to train.
---
Also gratz!
---
Awesome! Go dip it in the lava lake in the wilderness! The one with the bridge going across the center of it. You‚Äôll have a chance to get an eternal glory
---
If it makes you feel any better i didnt get ejected at all.
---
I always prefer to try to gather everything I need to do something I want to do. Like, oh, I'm a make some potions with all these herbs I've acquired... Better make some vials. I think it just adds to the fun.
---
Bust out varrock medium and enjoy your varrock teles directly to the GE. It‚Äôs amazing
---
you can do it a lot faster if you slay efficiently though, 90-99 took me 8 days of semi nolifing. The non efficient route is probably more fun though.
---
10 rune drag alts
---
they purely do it because it‚Äôs asked for and generates revenue simple as that and most likely will never change.
---
We're getting excited about people being excited. I think these posts are annoying, but it's more fun to see noob achievements than pet drops or 99s, imo.
---
1 / 256 seems more old school
---
We are out during the weekday too :)
---
[I do that but the ROI is kinda shitty, like 95k an hour so I wouldn't recommend it](https://i.imgur.com/LHp1Mgq.png)
---
Yea this is pretty well known. 1am -5am EST primarily 3-4am
---
But still too many pkers for my taste
---
Well, not trying to rub it in because I'm already getting enlightened, but I'm on course to make 500k for this year and play mobile the entire 27 hours I'm at work.  Just sayin you got pasta my friend.
---
Gnomecopters were terrible. Stronghold of player safety makes rune scim too easy on irons, esp in f2p. 
---
They'd rather take the devtime for recreating stealing creation and put it elsewhere. Same for fist of guthix and soul wars.
---
I‚Äôm aware and I agree thinking they‚Äôd never remove it ... but doesn‚Äôt change that it‚Äôs a bad thing imo
---
for sure, it takes 2mins45 to process all bars into cballs.  So in that sense it's good but it's not great cash.  That doesn't matter though since you can click pretty much once every 3 mins.  Great if you're at work or something
---
Buying current designs helps me produce new ones faster :)
---
In this case, it's not just [item], but pretty much all items... iron ore, logs, feathers, etc, etc. having 10x+ less volume. Also, bots would affect supply more than demand, but in this case it looks like demand is the problem.
---
That's pretty much a perfect description of the stereotypical incel, yes.
---
Wyvern
---
Haven't played in ages and went on a nostalgia trip. I'll be here with my rune pickaxe, lighten up guys.
---
Great! :)
---
28 minutes average is a bit more than just good, that's nearly absolute max efficiency.
---
They should not or changes how skulls work imo
---
Oh, OK. I guess I just read into some subtext that wasn't there. It sounded like you were implying that it was a bad thing, or that they annoyed you, or that the way they enjoy the game is somehow invalid. I would have responded to that with some argument about everyone playing their own way, live and let live, etc.
---
But since you were just stating that there are people like that out there -- said without malice or judgement -- I suppose that I don't need to type any of that out. Have a nice day!

At 95 combat, you'd have a tough time at most bosses. If you unlock it, I'd make sure you have enough points to skip boss tasks that might be too difficult or too risky (Wilderness multicombat bosses, GWD). For most other bosses you can choose to kill only 3, which should be doable at your stats and nets a nice 5k Slayer xp
---
The 5 damage is there because otherwise people could just go in and out and dodge the mechanics.
---
Can someone explain to me what ‚Äúline of sight changes‚Äù are? Thanks in advance!
---
Wonder if a weekly accomplishment thread would be worth having here.  That way these events could be scheduled in advance and we could reduce some clutter all at once.
---
I mean, you're just assuming they do it to show off? Haven't you ever done something on your acct just cause it's cool?

For example I have had pet 1kc. I haven't done had again just to keep that 1kc pet. I don't show it off to anyone. I just know it's there

True question, how'd you get 69 Slayer? Just through quests? I have a decent lvl 100 account, train Slayer often, and even have 200+ qp. So I'm confused.

I started doing solo raids and while the beginning was rough it‚Äôs been becoming more fun and doable! Go get it

it has its bad moments but i find it perfectly playable, it can kinda chug out low framerate for a bit if theres too much open in ChromeOS while playing on linux, but as i spent the first two months or so on mobile when i got back into osrs i find it a massive improvement.

Probably, in my experience with dealing with RS3 players, the vast majority of the ones left that I run into, are the ones that really **REALLY** like RS3. Versus in OSRS there's people that really like it, and there's a lot of people that enjoy it casually.
---
So yeah, makes sense that of the remaining RS3 fanbase which is already reasonably dedicated to begin with, the ones that go even further in their dedication to make it out to runefest would also be the types that would like it enough to dress up for it.
---
Sweet, gracias
---
This is why I've started to switch over to playing my ironman account more than my main, at least within the last few days. Skilling feels pointless when I have the GE. Why should I train Hunter when I could do wyverns for an hour and use the money to buy 12 hours of chins? At least with iron man I feel like skilling is worth something.
---
(Not trying to be an ironman-btw; I have like 40 total level lol, it's not impressive.)
---
Ward is not necessary, it's just +10 ranged defense and +15 ranged accuracy which is nice but should be the last upgrade.
---
If you are camping vorkath anyways it's probably worth to liquidate and get dhcb.
---
The minions switch aggro around the room, so probably not

Really tho what job earn 100k which you can be on your phone 12 hours?

Idk shooting thoughts.
---
So, i little help for a noob here (i played rune since like 2012, but i understand much more of RS3 then OSRS), i love hunting and im grinding, but also looking for farming while doing so. I'm very low lvl (skill total above 600), and hunt is almost 68, looking for the 73 to the black chins, so, if i get into and world with skill lvl total 750, for exemple, i would be easier to not be killed by pkers?

Your opinion sucks

How much bank have you made so far?

Oh .... thanks
---
Yeah my philosophy with expense gear is that as long as you‚Äôre actively using it you‚Äôre not losing money. I look at a scythe and bow as just being locked to your account once you get them.

Btw

Uhuh, the other improvement is flicking the MRM's at the start and throughout the kill.

You did the right thing. Unfortunately you won‚Äôt be able to change the login email.

As long as your new email is safe and you don‚Äôt click on any phishing links, then you‚Äôre going to be fine.

Best thing you get from it early is gp. It's a pretty effortless way to get 100k and some easy wc levels
---
Yeah you obviously still have to do the clicks. Over the course of maxing, time becomes the biggest factor to consider by far. Effort pretty much doesnt matter which is why fletching gets shit on sometimes. 
---
Magic is another example yeah. A lot of skills have some amount of xp which can be trained zero-time.
---
You only "start off" with a skill at 99 if you'll be maxing. I'd generally consider all players to be maxing, some just doing a bad job by "not caring and having fun"
---
Thing is, outside of pking and some bosses, nothing in this game is "hard". It's just time consuming.
---
I guess that comes down to what you want to achieve and what you consider to be fun. On a 2k plus account it‚Äôs all pretty much a long grind to max your stats where with your iron man you have lots to still achieve
---
Not through any effort of his own. He had to actually get weight loss surgery to force the pounds off of him, in which he went from massively morbidly obese at 580 pounds to just morbidly obese at 350 pounds. Also, he claims himself to be a "weight loss inspiration," yet he hasn't lost any notable weight in over a year now, and continues to stuff his face with as much and any food he can possibly find.

Ah dang, any good minigames at this level? I know Barb assault will be hard, but my goal is torso/fc. Thanks again!

Obsidian. Dragon would be only for that weird spot between 60 and 70 def where you can't use barrows and you need to prioritize tanking instead of damage.

Yeah, just turn entity hider on. If you ever die, just claim it's a really weird bug that just kills your character and deletes the loot

2. Like others said, crops do not die after fully growing. They go through growth in stages. If you were to inspect a growing plant they recently updated it where it will tell you what stage it's on. 
---
When your plant goes from one phase to the next, there is a chance it becomes diseased. If your plant is diseased and moves to the next stage it will die. By treating your plant with plant cure it will cure disease. You can also use compost, supercompost, or ultra compost. Think of those as adding extra lives to your plant. The better the compost the more lives, the lesser the risk of it dying before fully growing. 
---
Hope that helps. Happy farming :)

It's worth being too early vs making herb tar. :(

I don't even think it's about scamming, it just removes all sense of identity. It's not like real life where you have a personality and physical appearance which are clearly identifiable. In game, your name is largely who you are. I've always hated name changes for that reason.

I completed Family Crest today... I started it a week ago and I didn‚Äôt bother to look up quest requirements online. I needed to level up each of the 4 skills needed to compete the quest... I‚Äôm stubborn so I didn‚Äôt want to start another. It took me a full week (in between IRL responsibilities) to get everything leveled up...

Now that I‚Äôve completed it and Family Pest.... I don‚Äôt know why I wanted these gauntlets in the first place..

Any alt less than gargoyles at max melee is a meme and you shouldn't bother. Cball alts take over 40 hours per 2 weeks to break even.

Hunter, although botted, is still decent gp/h. Otherwise you‚Äôre pretty much right though. Unfortunate really.
---
I really hope you gain the recognition you deserve, been watching your mobile only for ages
---
&gt; 22m per 1m from what my clan chat says (correct me if i'm wrong)
---
Never listen to your cc again
---
I had to turn it all off at like 93 firemaking. Being able to focus just on my character and not have a billion people everywhere made it easier and chat got annoying after a while. 
---
&gt;	aside from that you should be more open minded to other player it can be fun :)
---
I mean, my original comment was more of taking the piss than being serious. I get why people keep thier chat on while skilling, but to me it just feels like complete torture. I don‚Äôt really like talking to complete strangers, so I‚Äôll usually just stick to discord and talk to friends.
---
I can't wc for shit on PC. Mobile though? millions of exp over the course of a week or two, i don't know what it is haha.

Mage is craaaazy at low levels
---
Low level mage pking is really fun actually. I remember back in the day I made a low level mage with 20 atk and 40 str for the mith 2h.
---
Fire blast to 2h would combo 20+ at like level 35
---
Bro you got redwoods tho. Easily the most afk thing in the whole game. Just watch TV or something.
---
Can't tell if you're a braincel or just incompetent at reading. You used to be able to use imp boxes while you were being attacked to bank your chins. Then they changed it. You cant even equip the box jackass, no shit it's useless to fight people with.
---
Well one of the most important aspect of tick Hunter is 1 tick trap resetting during a 3 tick cycle you start on the first trap you pick up, which you're not even attempting, so this method is significantly worse. And if you're losing a tick or two moving to the trap then starting the cycle, it's worse than just normal 3t trap resetting
---
i got a single pair of chaps 2 nights ago... I feel for ya
---
its a lvl 3 skiller. u can kill him with 2 fire strikes.
---
so what is the exchange?
---
Honestly dude for every 100 people swapping gold about 2 of them are real, if you decide to do it then do small chunks of your gp at a time.
---
Guarenteed a big chunk of players have never seen the roof :)
---
no
---
I by no means know what the going rate is but id say its 4:1
---
To get Slayer xp you have to land a "hit" on it, and the recoil counts as an item/not you
---
That's why low level completions that use ring of recoil still need to get a poison hit or something or the kill won't count as theirs.
---
Rendi's videos explain these mechanics pretty well, but I understand if his video style isn't for you
---
A hard mode to the most difficult content in game? I'd sign up to see that get done
---
Having experienced this development mentality over multiple games: Fucking no. This does not make your game actually last longer, it just makes it so you have a rotating casual playerbase for the same amount of time. Devaluing of player achievement is memed a lot on this sub but its a very real reason that games like EVE and BDO are still chugging along despite otherwise being terrible games: they do not constantly push new updates that make everything youve done before entirely worthless. This is a manor aspect of qny game where major achievements take time, and Oldschool Runescape is one of those games. Eventually you hit the wall, and either you push through it, find another path to another wall, or quit, and that is entirely fine in a game where each wall takes hundreds of hours to reach.
---
What reason? I thought it was a great story that related to what the person I replied to said.
---
Chinning would be easier if you know how to do it. But for only 3 kills you should be able to do it with a crossbow using diamond bolts quite easily.
---
With a task specifically for kree'arra you don't get the slayer helm damage bonus while chinning but it's still a bit better than using a crossbow.

It is very good dose and will make tasks shorter giving you better XP/hr. It's up to you if it's worth it or not. Typically it's not too high of a cost if you are using Mith/ Addy darts.
---
Then give me an example of socialism where it works and where you think it is not a dictator?
---
Best cash is the minimum amount of people so you can do a zalcano in 3 "bits" - that's either 3 people (who are all 95+ mining), or 4 (otherwise). A "fun" alternative is going with 2 99 mining + crystal pickaxe, which allows you to do zalcano in 4, yet gives nearly double the loot of a team of 4.
---
Probably find one in a dumpster outside a tamale factory

congratulations! how awesome does that cape feel!?!?!

Thought it was a flame comment.
---
This is bad advice - don't take jad slow - change your prayers immediately when he attacks to protect against the current attack style. This will ensure you do not die. Also attack him during this process so he dies. By killing jad while remaining alive, you will progress to the next wave. I hope I helped.

It costs a lot in time and supplies to practice and get good at the Inferno, to the point that a player can actually beat it once for the first time.
---
Some players see this as a gold/supply sink, and others also as way to unencourage players to do/practice the Inferno, thus keeping Infernal capes in the game much rarer and more unique, which leads to that feeling of 'pride and accomplishment' if you have one.
---
If you could practice the Inferno on beta worlds suddenly there's no cost in it, more people will be able to attempt it and get a cape without wasting so many supplies.

Knights are afk if setup properly, as for con the only afkish thing I can think of is flat packing.

What do you mean? Magic isn't a requirement for the quest. If you're referring to the boss, I used a swamp staff and ahrims gear

Slow not with prayer flicking, slow with not double potting and moving before ensuring jads next attack, slow i meant always do one thing only then check jads prayer

You'll get there dude. Every one of those deaths you incur is a "how could i have been more aware" or a "what could i have done better" opportunity for introspective.

Drawing the line at outfits would make sense; even if that may mean tiny powercreep on the max hood depending on implementation (e.g. do stats and weight reduction apply or just set bonuses?). But I am pretty sure merging Slayer Helm and Slayer Hood has came up, and been shot down, before. If we did allow for other hood effects, I am sure it would come back.

You wanna get 88% or below btw. Besides the brothers, I think for me to get 86-88% is to kill one skeleton, 1 worm, and 2 or 3 rats. It's the best odds for an item.

PSA: Don‚Äôt listen to u/Killz4Rune
---
Don‚Äôt get fooled by this post people. He‚Äôs straight up lying to your faces. He tries to act as if hes a peace loving osrs player, but he recently called me a f**got after I confronted him about his bullshit about how torso was ‚Äúpleb Armour‚Äù. He loves to put smiley faces on all of his comments to look nice and shit, but if you dive deeper into his comment history, you can see that he loves to call people ‚Äúdumbfucks‚Äù and loves to use other vulgar language out of the blue.
---
He has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about. He acts as if he knows all about OSRS but the guy is a total fraud. He called fighter torso ‚Äúpleb Armour‚Äù and then when I pointed out to him that fighter torso actually has +4 str bonus, the SAME str bonus as BCP, and that many maxed mains still use torso for things such as PVP, he freaked out and started raging and claimed I was lying. He then claimed that ‚Äúonly plebs use torso‚Äù and when I showed him how basically every pvper on osrs used torso, including rich you tubers such as Torvesta, he freaked out and started calling me a f**got.
---
The guy has major issues, and loves to use homophobic slurs when someone calls him out on something. Don‚Äôt believe what he‚Äôs saying. He puts all these smiley faces and hearts but then turns around and calls everyone who calls him out a dumbfuck
---

---
Wait until the 126 dragon plate chestybro logs in.
---
Surprise you win
---
That's not extra because of opportunity cost. Had he simply kept mining and let someone else fix it, he'd have made more money via mining. It's not extra money, it's substituted money, and a lower amount.
---
If you say so, so far youve done nothing to disprove what ive said.
---
Why?
---
This is how I trained it. On this same spot every time. The same 5 tiles. I did black Sally‚Äôs until 80 and then used a 3 tick box trap method until 99

Yes, ofc I use piety. How many accounts are you using? On one single account, rune dragons maxes out about 2.2m/hr, but more realistically most people won't get above about 1.8m/hr profit.

Jagex wasn‚Äôt even smart enough to limit the 7 day free trial to once per rs account. All you need is another google account. They don‚Äôt even have to suicide. While many are caught during the first 7 days they can (and sometimes do) use free membership for months.

It's not like anyone used to bank chins while trying to escape pkers. It doesnt work when teleblocked and the first thing you're going to do is teleport not send your chins to the bank. The only use it did have in pvp was scamming in risk fights to send your gear away. I'm happy they didn't perm disable them in the wild or they would have no use at all.
---
&gt;Don't have in game friends  
---
telling reddit is similar to typing in public chat, or in a random clan chat, so you should try that as well, you will be connecting with more people (live, like a tv show, but you are one of the characters)  
---
congratz
---
Down voted to oblivion for having an unpopular but reasonable opinion. This community is so incredibly toxic.
---
&gt;With a small group only being allowed to vote on certain things will only make that happen more
---
EXPERT pvpers voting on pvp updates, what's wrong with that?
---
also, what is that "selfish mindset" you're talking about here. you're worried that if you let a group of experienced pvpers decide what updates should pass, they'd vote in only things that directly benefit them instead of the whole community? that's quite literally the least of concerns, when we currently have polls for every jimmy and bobby who never even stepped in wilderness yet - but their votes count on whether pvp updates pass or not. 
---
also, why do you think a pvp council would make decisions that are inherently bad for the game, when vast majority of the game doesn't even pvp currently. they couldn't even fucking tell whether the changes are good or bad because they're so out of touch - which would be the problem a council of experts solves. 
---
alternatively, we could have a pvp kills requirement on pvp polls
---
Works phonetically though, the 'PH' sound is the same as 'F'.
---
Read it, it's a great story
---
Dude we have very comparable stats and I came back like a month ago too, nice!
---
Mad man.
---
Real achievement brother
---
I average like 25-30k xp/hr when going for exp (as opposed to saving points and only skipping straight cancer as opposed to mildly annoying), and I'm iron (can't cannon). From 93-99 that'd be what, 200 hours at those exp rates? And that's assuming I don't find a way to get it higher, ie unlocking smoke devils, skipping more aggressively?
---
I'm not saying it's right to compare to the record, just that 6 months isn't... inefficient, that's like straight up avoiding efficiency.
---
Which is fine if he enjoys it!
---
Honestly, I got a bit of a kick out of it. Especially when My next comment in the chain is at like +80.
---
No bro for real my comment wasnt clear enough!

Metal dragons are actually a great point task when you hit 100 combat.

You can have access to iban's blast with as low as 28cb. Can be also coupled with 50 range

True what the gentleman said.. always do ONE thing only between jad‚Äôs attacks

So if that isnt social anxiety, what is? Who gives a fuck whether I actually go to a doctor to get it confirmed? Lmfaooo that retard will also say Stacy with 100k+ instagram followers posting pictures of herself with her 5000 friends has social anxiety if she goes to him, legit fucking meaningless.

Who's cooking his dinners so he can get 3 HCIM to 2K total in 12 months.
---
I mean depending on what u want I might be able to hook you up, let me know
---
I think the time saved is running from the hopper to the sack rather than from the sack to the bank
---
Arrg is a quest monster that must be defeated during Troll Romance.
---
Days since arrival would still go up though
---
That‚Äôs just rng though
---
Yea it takes longer with more rooms/stuff

The¬†Ice Troll King¬†is the¬†bossmonster for¬†The Fremennik Islesquest

i‚Äôm really unsure how you‚Äôre missing the point so badly and how you don‚Äôt see the irony in trying to discredit people for ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù they have a&amp;d when you‚Äôre doing the exact same thing yourself
---
Thanks for the vid j1mmy! Always makes my day better. Favorite runescape creator
---
Hasn‚Äôt even got a glory .. no wonder he lost her
---
I found an easy way to suicide. Just use a locator orb and a divine potion right after in the same tick at 11-20 hp.
---
Time to alch myself
---
I actually had it though. I had zero friends ( still do ), I was a total fucking loser who couldn't even leave the house. All of these fucks claim to have it yet have friends, have social media active, you get my point. You have to be living under a rock to not see this trend atm. It's literally a meme to have depression/anxiety/ocd/adhd/ whatever
---
Shut down the servers for a week. Would love to see the state of this sub on day 3. For science, of course.
---
Tbh I don't think PvM line of sight is a problem. It's been a long established thing on how safespotting works. And all this did was make existing safespots for certain mobs not work, while creating several more safespots..
---
Looks like your memberships didnt run out
---
Probably possible trio/dolo
---
So why don't you understand why pvmers complain about getting pked? You yourself admit that getting harassed in the wilderness is annoying.
---
the footprints are suppose to be blood btw.
---
That was my first thought too.
---
No. He should be banned.
---
gz see u in lumby noob
---
You only start in lumbridge if you were not in a free area and your membership runs out, if you have mems, you have to move to a free area first
---
as long as it‚Äôs step it‚Äôs fine :)
---
I see you Nixue. Better take this pic down now
---
I‚Äôd say you were on a new acc and then switched to this one, causing RL to think you gained all that xp since the last time you logged in
---
Because Ironman gameplay is vastly different than normal gameplay and everyone has a unique way of doing it, a lot of Ironmen think it‚Äôs funny how much of a pain in the ass it is to do some things and maybe they just want to share it with someone else because they think you might think it‚Äôs funny as well, instead you come and complain about them on reddit.
---
How in the actual fuck does one kill 89 Zammy boss in a trip???
---
Maxed skillers who notice a lot of competition probably. Not big effort to go from level 3 maxed skiller to level 30 maxed skiller for pking.
---
Just take the time to go through all the available settings one by one. I'm sure you'll find lots of nice things
---
Ur comment is confusing. 
---
Before they didnt work when tbed. Then they didnt work in wildy. Now they dont work in combat. So functionally the same thing as pre nerf when at black chins
---
Yes but a twisted bow will cut your fight cave run by like 15 minutes.  It's absolutely worth getting first.
---
Thought I was lucky 360kc with prims pegs pet and jar
---
I wonder if that's roughly accurate across all levels though, or if it's like just 99 or something
---
I don‚Äôt think a maxed skiller is going to want to change their account build to a level 30 mage though, it‚Äôs like getting defence levels on your pure
---
I was actually thinking about think when I was at Wintertodt getting 99 Fm on my new Iron the other day but then I got lost in thought and decided I‚Äôll probably do some agility pyramid for some starter cash and agility lvls before I hit the questing grind and maybe Thieving for some extra gp because I‚Äôll need it for Construction especially if I‚Äôm going to cut and make my own planks
---
I think it's roughly accurate throughout all levels. The formula was the same mostly for black chins but I don't remember what the number was. Maybe 325? But I can't say for sure about black chins.
---
BiS for many bosses and DPS, rare to get too.
---
Out of all 3 SotE was the most annoying for me, I died a few times and running back and forth around Lletya and navigating the UP was annoying af
---
Yesterday I got 2 pairs of climbing boots (g) and 1 wizard boots. In one day... still dry on rangers but 3 boots in under 100 kc.
---
Well I'm only 80 atm and unfortunately a decent amount away from mm2 or I would definitely test it out
---
Rookies, I hop worlds hoping my first hop has a fixed wheel
---
Goddamn that made me have a giggle
---
Yeah it‚Äôs good but I usually just throw some rune thrownaxes and hit em all
