I like this idea way too much. 10/10 would play
---
You should look up the b0aty zilyana method
---
This is great.
---
Pk'ing was fun when I geared up years ago and faced off against people my age, who had hodge-podge weird setups like mine. 
---

---
Now? All the fun has been sucked out of it. You either follow the established meta builds/account builds or you aren't going to PvP. You either have the money or you don't. You either spastically obsess over gear switches etc. beyond special attacks or you don't do it at all.
---
No fun at all. It's like Sand Casino.
---
I kinda like wing cosmetics in most games. Wow has a cool set of priest hear with wings and a good iirc that looks really dope.
---
However, I hear that rs3  has wings and they aren't that great. Is that why you do not want them in old school?
---
Or do you think wings just don't fit the style of OSRS? I can kinda understand that, I'm not sure how they would design them to look good.
---
If by close you mean not close then sure.
---
This should be written just like that at the top of his wiki page
---
Borderless water and overlapping buildings... nice! OP definitely knows their way around the AoE2 map editor
---
What have you been smoking?
---
Are bank sales filter by this?
---
Mod Ash did respond on twitter last night, said their are a few other acc's with similar issues. Should have a mod and their team work on rectifying it when they're available

are you that cunt that stole the 50 dollars mum gave me for the town show when i was 12?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i was going to buy gravitron rides and a shirt with that you absolute FUCK (pretty sure it was you brother you know who you are fucking comment on me when ive got 2 dollars becuase of your mother and you dont want to share a tin of fucking tuna ull get urs)
---
I don't know the exact most optimal, but I like to keep my attack/strength around same level. If you just go straight for attack you'll be missing a lot of strength levels that make leveling faster. 40 defense is fine for a good while. Level that up last
---
Wut? I'm sorry I don't get the reference
---
I mean this isn't a problem nor an abuse of any 3rd party client plugins. It can easily be done with a bit of practice just like people did for tile-specific movement in the old days. This is just some really big brain controlling of movement.
---
Why are you wearing boots of stone and not d boots?
---
I mean sure it might, but at the same time, is it as easy as right clicking the world map button and clicking one of the options?
---
Also, you can edit skyboxes and such, so you can actually set it to noon/dusk/night/dawn or other things.
---
Read: "You're not leaving me enough loot."
---
Post ge history
---
Damn im moist
---
Not real I had one in for 100k for months now and it would’ve bought before 119 gp
---
if you're doing things properly it doesn't really have a good use apart from milking the inferno. Dks, inferno learning, and solo tob are the only places where there's a decent argument for using it. Everywhere else you should just be taking claws/dds. If Prims give you a max hit then it's a no brainer, sell the SGS.
---
*me turning SkyBox on and off*
---
This is an awesome drawing
---
No. Really, no. In any kind of dungeon the skybox defaults to 'so fucking dark you can't see shit'.
---
9/10 people play with the skybox set to 'daytime' so they can actually see the floor.
---
Honestly it's more believable like this than with a (possibly edited) screenshot. Grats.
---
I just need the average viewer count to be able to submit my request :)
---
The pvm side is toxic too so calm down bro, i got my fair share of toxic pvmers that were mad at me because I conplained about something. And it's the wilderness, if you don't want to get tea bagged then don't go there. And this isn't just about making money, it's about the thrill of clapping some idiot that was doing a task.
---
right-click attack options would make it pretty similar
---
They did that in rs3, look where it is now.
---
Brings me back to a kid when I used the d long because I was to scared to do mm
---
Duel arena is by far the best gold sink in game... would be terrible for economy. I myself only visit the duel arena once in a blue moon, usually with friends for a good time and not risking more than I’m willing to lose.. moderation is key.
---
Sounds shitty*
---
It's called the wilderness xD
---
Imagine being so sad you get killed in a intended place for players to kill other players oh boy.
---
That's not being toxic lol that's using content for its intended purpose and having a group cry because they don't like the intended purpose
---
ohhhh, of course
---
because it feels completely out of place at level 60 slayer for how difficult they buffed them to be. either make them balanced for level 60 slayer, or increase the slayer requirement to \~80s or so? idk, i'm trying to have a productive discussion but people seem to just want to flame. before runefest everyone was up in arms about the change, now everyone's happy with it? what happened?
---
You can get the pet from just killing him, 1 in 200 chance.
---
rs3 wings are completely static, also there's a lot of fairy wings, which people use with bandos gear and it's so goddamn ugly
---
Damn dude you into some ...interesting stuff.
---
Heads up! Some people who do PvP are toxic!
---
Osrs community as a whole is toxic you just don’t like pvp because you might lose 10 k to a pker who told you to sit
---
lmfao screamo learn to genre u pleb
---
The hop limit is gone, by the way.
---
Fair enough i stopped pking for a year or so here too but with the release of lms ive been honing my skills and its got me back into it!
---
Why would I be mad when I'm not the one getting abused every time I set foot in the wilderness?
---
Shows how long it's been since I've had an issue
---
Looks like Blighttown.
---
I believe mod Phantom said the right thing. Instead of them walking to Falador and paying 1000 coins, if they're still on tutorial island/lumbridge they might as well make a new character, hes not saying it's impossible to change appearance.
---
Really excellent tips, thank you for all the effort you put into your reply :)
---
Somehow, holding a lyre in one hand while fighting with the other feels extremely odd to me.
---
I feel an orb would fit better.
---
that would possibly be pretty dope honestly, and i know other people have posted similar suggestions. it just feels really out of place at level 60 slayer for how strong the Knights are, especially given the pre/post change disparity.
---
What setup are you using? We may be able to help optimise your setup?
---
THE WONDER THE WONDER TH... NOOOOOOO
---
What an absurd statement, whoa. Make an Ironman if you wanna flex drops? You’re completely ignoring the fact that 1) they were initially meant to be untradable, but were put into the game (admittedly) incorrectly by a developer, 2) the fact that jars are actually a giant slap in the face because a 1/1k unique that costs 6k to buy on the grand exchange shouldn’t even exist, and 3) if you get the jar on 1kc, people would know you didn’t just go get one kill so you could display the jar, which makes it far more authentic. 
---
No one cares about looking at your collection log in your house unless you’re actually friends with the person. The vast majority of players don’t give a flying fuck what you do in-game. I don’t even really ever have guests in my poh, so it’s less of a “flex to look cool to others” thing and more of a personal gratification thing. But it’s cute that your brain automatically went there.
---
Edit: added one more reason why your statement is fucking retarded that I somehow overlooked before.
---
i was called by God chief
---
Oh! Didn't actually know that, thanks!
---
PSA: none are your worlds at all.
---
&gt; hop between worlds at such an interval that the bot doesn't get logged out,
---
You wont get locked out from hopping too much now. They removed it. The process of hopping is slightly slower than it used to be but it's unlimited now.
---
I have told countless people this, yet a lot refuse to believe me. People have cheat clients that allow them to track certain players, regardless of if they have private’s on or off. It’s so broken and makes rev poking nearly impossible, due to the sole amount of players using this client.
---
If your on a jad task, it drops to 1 in 100 chance as well.
---
I’m somewhat of a noob what is the point of champion scrolls?
---
Fair point
---
Thematically I went with a lyre because of the depictions of siren's playing the harp/lyre and singing to lure men in to the ocean.
---
Perhaps it could include a detached or ghostly hand on it, to indicate the user isn't actually using it in combat, but an otherworldly force is playing instead?
---
Jagex should sponsor this ad. This is lit.
---
The good old days in which people would use black (g) or addy (g) over rune, just because of the looks.
---
WHAT A LEGEND!
---
Jagex, give this man a Golden Gnome!
---
gee, they should patch this botting stuff
---
[deleted]
---
Well I’m pretty poor, I’m doing trident, dark robe set, then black dhide,rune crossbow,broad bolts ,dragon defender, Ava’s, 3 prayer pots and shark. Basically it’s the prayer pots I just spend like 30k per trip. It adds up.
---
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
---
Also the pvm community has toxicity as well lol..
---
I'v lost count of how many times iv been crashed or groups iv joined who haven't shared loot haha.. 
---
It's just people in general haha.
---
Please please please I want this so bad
---
Yup, understandable.
---
Honestly, felt odd just because a lyre is typically played with two hands so holding it in one would be weird.
---
Anyone else been getting the OSRS ad talking about cutting yew trees for hundreds of hours to make money? Think it was a gold selling ad
---
I saw the ad too!
---
Fine example of Poe's law right here.
---
Damn I use adblock.
---
get a new task then shitcunt
---
120m split. This was after most of the clan left so only a few of us were left.
---
I'd never really recommend barrows as a moneymaking method tbh. If you find it fun or just wanna try your luck then yeah go ahead and do it obviously, but otherwise it's not that great.
---
Herb and birdhouse runs will be more than enough to tide you through the early/mid game, and are much easier. Do these a couple times a day and you'll have more than enough for whatever you want (basic gear upgrades like whip, blowpipe, the occasional buyable skill, etc) and they work great with other early/mid game activities (Pretty easy to do a run between quests / slayer tasks). If you do herb &amp; birdhouse runs, camping a moneymaker like Barrows in the early/mid game is kinda pointless (again, unless you have fun doing it ofc). There's **nothing** you can buy that'll save you more time than it took to make the gold for (Talking about things like full bandos, prims, torture, anguish, armadyl, etc. since herb/birdhouse runs should net you enough to cover the basics).
---
If you just need like 1-2M **right now**, swing over to the [Money Making Guide (wiki)](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide). There are plenty of options that either match barrows' GP/H while gaining better XP, or make more GP/H than barrows, or even both (Keep in mind that the barrows profit listed on the wiki is assuming good stats + diary). The main 2 that come to mind are mort myre fungi (Very low requirements, 700k+/h gp) or  abyss RC (44++ RC, 500k-1m+ gp/h while getting some fabled RC XP). Obviously there are better options depending on your other non-combat stats (blast furnace, hunting chinchompas, etc.) so just pick what works best for you :)
---
Aye this weekend was really bad for Scout bots
---
Much worse than usual
---
I liked 99.998% the anime character at the the end ruined the vibe.

I’m pointing out blue specifically as all the other colors are relatively similar, also why I said raw in the title :P

E N G I N E  W O R K
---
Helm effect sounds very OP, I could see it being balanced (somewhat) if it required a full set of armor instead of just the helm.
---
Not too keen on the mace either, we don't really need a better melee training method IMO. It would be cool for the mace to instead have synergy with the armor set, being a slow hitting weapon with high damage potential only if wearing the set, due to faster hits
---
Staff sounds cool
---
Still barely playable though... lol
---
If OP has win10, it is built in. Otherwise I would use f.lux
---
Solid haul. Just wait until you go 90+ chests dry on an item, then you’ll reconsider how much you like barrows ;)
---
that sentence scans fine without any punctuation. it’s just a bunch of long verb and noun phrases.
---
Screamo isn't a genre. It's a word used to describe a collaboration of genres that they're unfamiliar with. Most commonly, when people say Screamo they mean Hardcore/Post HC
---
$11 well spent I guess
---
Pedantic
---
I see you're an oldschool sort of screamo man
---
I figured that much
---
Get into raids, make friends that u run with regularly.
---
Kill a pvmer you usually get cursed or racist comments so explain?
---
Yeah this must be hitting everyone fairly recently cause this is like the 6th post ive seen on this.
---
Yeah it goes
---
1) osrs pvpers
---
2) war Lord's
---
3) human traffickers
---
It took me 666 kills to get dragon defender, don't get dissuaded, it's pretty good combat training and there is almost free food and pots upstairs!
---
- neitiznot instead of archer's helm if you have it
---
- bring a vestment cape to switch maybe
---
- proselyte top/legs, or rune if you decide to tank. More risky but lower supply cost
---
- rune/dragon boots instead of mystic
---
- Rune kite instead of broodoo shield if you decide to tank.
---
If you can't spare like 4 slots for switches, definitely quest &amp; train your stats up before you go back.
---
He has tile markers and tile indicator on.
---
Tile markers highlights pre-chosen tiles and tile indicator highlights the tile that you click on until your character stands on it.
---
The twist:
---
Jagex owns the gold selling sites.
---
Can we have a softer soft core mode?
---
And here I am, not knowing what ahk means just trying to do my clue scroll!
---
U dont see those posts that are constantly posted where people are crashing each other and raging in pvm?
---
Jed owns them all and rot
---
Weird way to spell brainlet
---
Dunno about him but i legit cant get enough of pking ever since i started the game last year with the goal of profiting in pvp, finally got 99 range last week and im always as excited to pk in general (especially risk fighting).
---
I would gladly see jagex be a bit more stringent on 3pc's and such (wouldn't want them completely banned unless jagex managed to update their own client). And a pj timer would be nice if implemented correctly. The only thing idk how they could accurately solve is scouting beyond what they've already done in bot prevention.
---
And I wasn't intending to belittle pvp content but again I don't believe it's as dramatic and gamebreaking as you initially led on.
---
&gt; mort myre fungi (Very low requirements
---
OP almost definitely doesn't have poh fairy ring and mory hard diaries, and without those the gp/hr is way lower
---
Yeah of course it's Demonicronic lmao. I'm in a few deathcore and metalcore groups on facebook and this guy advertises himself a lot.
---
Zamorak room at FWD bothers me enough already. I need the same consistency for the duration of my Rune experience.
---
Yeah you’re so right I’m going to take up my dream job of being a scarecrow
---
Thanks! That's really simple and smart. I think I'll start off by doing exactly that
---
People arent typically using smoke spells in pvm/pvp tho either. Tome of fire for best normal magic spell, this would be for best ancient magic spell. Not that it really needs it.
---
Hello Satan spawn.
---
Blowpipe is just f\*\*\*ing ridiculous.
---
No idea actually. Other players cannot enter ironmen's POHes so the only person who could add to the tip jar would be the creator themselves. =P
---
I guess it could be useful for UIMs to store their GP there (as a diversification between LMS and NMZ) but I doubt that you can add to your own tip jar. Please feel free to correct me if you know otherwise.
---
You still bring void for range and mage though.
---
Just a meme my dude
---
Right
---
&gt;Kill a pvmer
---
You answered your own question.
---
I strongly disagree, LoL can be a contender but even then they rarely **get angry when they win** like RS PKers very often do. You're almost guaranteed to encounter toxicity if you go deep wildy, none of the games you listed have nearly that high of a toxicity rate (besides GW2 just because I never played it).
---
...
---
You can do more than that if you have website access
---
I'm not going to pick a side here, but just because you can doesn't mean it makes sense. 
---
That's the big flaw I keep seeing: most clue hunters and people who perceive themselves as not being worthwhile to hunt hate the argument that makes sense; anyone could potentially have anything in the wilderness and unless you kill them you'll never know. 
---
The easiest fix, that I know would never pass a poll, would be to give people the value skull of old wilderness. It wouldn't prevent you from attacking but it might stem the hatred that people feel for pkers in the wilderness.
---
They don't, but they also don't consume charges from the Book.
---
That crossed my mind as to whether or not people would be concerned/interested in an item that could give an offhand water rune source to Ice spells
---
The mega-clans are monopolizing the wilderness because they are the most invested and last to quit, and almost everyone else has finally quit after multiple years. When you are in a clan, you aren't as likely to quit because you don't want to leave your friends, because the clan has required trips, and because of other shit like that. All the noobier players lower on the foodchain have quit, because the bottom of the foodchain (profitable content that surpasses the profit of safe content) is dead. The clans are all that's left, the last to quit.
---
   
---
People didn't always fall in on and dscim spec a zerker wearing salad robes for 200k loot, that's a new thing. It didn't use to happen. But that's all they have left, there isn't anyone else to fight.
---
Cries in C Engineer
---
Say whatever you want, it does decrease my enjoyment of watching PVP polls get deflected.
---
Unplayable, completely unrealistic.
---
Jungly 2
---
That Kyle life
---
I don’t PVP because:
---
1. My internet isn’t good enough
---
2. I’m trash lol
---
Its not even close, pipe dps is much higher. 
---
Bitterkoekje dps if you wanna compare.
---
Also you definitely dont want to use void. Void break even is like 99 range rigour (slightly beats dhides)
---
2 rune scims
---
you can use a cooked meat on a fire / range and it becomes burnt btw LUL
---
So if you're buying out the cheesey potatoes in the warriors guild you can hit every world.
---
"I knew that" or something like that
---
Noob friendly doesn't mean they are willing to carry people through in random barrows gear with no switches and a dragon scimitar.
---
Smell the chair.
---
Best Runescape content I have seen in SO many years.
---
So you admit that no one would ever go into the wilderness at all if jagex didnt cater to pkers and literally bride players into the wilderness?
---
Good to know that you are at least self aware in a small way, in that you know you only pk to ruin the game for people.
---
Where ma country gon’.
---
I get YouTube ads for osrs CONSTANTLY. That and viome lol.
---
Just drink less energy drinks and drink more water instead.
---
I already made the commment about how ay least you know you are only ruining the game for people by pking them.  But it bears repeating.
---
Entitlement and a feeling of superiority. I've been flamed more by ironmen in the wildy than any PKer, because HOW DARE you attack them in the wilderness.
---
It would be funny if they're moved to a fake shadow ban world, but they'd find out once they try to do their RWT. But they could create a simple script to test (try trading with a new unbanned f2p account) for this so it wouldn't do much either
---
this makes me miss the halloween event(s) in 2010,2011 where you went around the draynor area trick or treating, with all the decorations and nighttime
---
god damn

I'm glad to see Envy mentioned, I love them so much
---
Suffering and do ds2 for assembler if you can
---
I'm so fucked up with wanting to relax some and needing to catch up on sleep Thursday-saturday night after staying up late sunday to finish school, having class monday night, staying up late tuesday to make sure I'm prepped for lab Wednesday, staying up late for Wednesday lab followed by another class's due date...
---
Like if everything could just fuck off for a week and then I bothered to catch up... maybe I should just take some leave, that or leave my family :p
---
Anyway, thanks for the meme brother. Always need something to use in the group chats. Sorry I unloaded on ya. Super stoked about Monday's holiday.
---
I mean you can't just say that all orthostatic hypotension is caused by energy drinks. I can't stand drinking them and I get it bad
---
How often do people actually use Stam pots? I find they're very niche because I don't run out of run energy at 70 agil w/ graceful. I only need them on clues and zalcano really.
---
This might have been an cool story if you told it to your clan members one day when the topic came up, but the fact that you immediately hopped on reddit and felt the need to post about it is pretty pathetic.
---
I'm an iron so I cant ok, never been good at it unless you consider 2005-2006 ftp pking. What you're talking about also kills content like rev caves. I know the risks and want to go anyway to try and get some rev kills but it always seems no matter what world or what time I go I always get killed. I've noticed the same scout bots on a regular. 
---
It's like any game, why get good at COD when you get an aim bot 🤷‍♂️
---
Deathcore
---
Whenever I poop, I've been logging onto osrs on mobile to do a gauntlet run every time I poop.
---
I downloaded mobile solely to do the gauntlet while pooping at work cause I really want that pet. I have a problem.
---
bruh...
---
lol
---
No garg is expensive because its insanley rare, alomst double the rate of even the pet
---
&gt;Jagex needs to stop putting enticing content in the wilderness. For me, it has nothing to do with dying or not. It's more the matter of time wasted
---
You're neglecting the fact that the "enticing" content is *designed* with the risk(of losing GP or time) in mind. Higher risk means higher reward. For whatever reason, people seem to think that they should be able to access the greater rewards without accepting the higher risk.
---
&gt;Add Chins and Wildy bosses to that list and yeah, you right. 
---
Not really. Wilderness bosses absolutely aren't a hot spot for PKing. The only places I get attacked with any regularity are Callisto and Chaos Fanatic - and even then, the frequency of attacks is low(like 2-3 an hour). Chins are a bit busier, but still nowhere near as busy as Altar/Lava Maze/Revs. 
---
&gt;Except that now covers almost everything there is to do in the wild
---
There is far more in the wilderness than you seem to think there is. Rogue's Castle, Fountain of Rune, Rune rocks, Lava Dragons, Elder Chaos Druids, charging orbs, Resource Arena, Agility course, Black Salamanders, Wilderness Slayer(+Chests), Green Dragons, Clue Scrolls, Ents, and Wilderness God Wars Dungeon, to name a few.
---
&gt;If the wildy is the only place to get a specific drop, people are obviously going to go there. 
---
People are free to decide whether or not the added risk that comes with Wilderness content is worth the reward. Nobody is forcing you to do the content. Virtually all of the items that come from the wilderness are not necessary to effectively play the game. 
---
&gt;The forced nerfs/"integrity" updates just because Pkers whined enough. 
---
I don't think it's really fair to attribute these changes to "whining". These updates addressed real issues with content being used in PvP.
---
Bind/Snare/Entangle were buffed by removing the duration limiting effect of protect from magic. This brought the spells in line with other freezing effects such as ice spells and the Zamorak Godsword special attack which did not have their duration impacted by prayer.
---
The Granite Maul was had its special attack altered due to how powerful it was relative to the cost(risk) of the item. Players could retain the full KO power of the weapon by buying an attachment(and thus risking more).
---
The Bulwark had its magic defensive bonus reduced to 0(from 18) because of how overpowered it was when combined with black dragonhide. It also didn't make much sense within the game's lore that a giant metal shield had magic defenses to begin with.
---
&gt;The possibility of giving Pkers an exclusive club for proposals. The possibility of changing polls to benefit Pkers. None of those are healthy ideas for the game as long as the communities have content that 'requires' intermingling
---
Realistically speaking, the only thing that you've mentioned which is problematic is the changing to the polling system. How significant of an impact that would have, though, is dependent on how such changes were implemented.
---
Bring back the original rcing guild with great orb project from 2008
---
Uhh what?
---
Speak for yourself. I'm a pvmer who literally has never tried pking. I only use wildy for 3 things: Prayer, Clues and Hunter. And i'm always prepped with a plan to get the fuck out asap when a pker comes. 
---
Game is getting ruined for you because you want everything to be easy
---
I got invited to my clan after saying "well played" to a PKer who nabbed me while I was doing wild slayer, and finished me off as I tried to run to safety.
---
probably better than the ads jagex makes
---
Obviously nobody is going to take a risk without a reward what are you even talking about.
---
Its cause you spelled polls pools
---
Shiiiiiiit.....time for more Pest Control then......
---
right?
---
You don't NEED to do *anything* in the game. By locking absolutely anything besides PvP-related items behind PvP content, you're creating a system where people who hate PvP need to consider whether or not it's worth it to enter a PvP environment. I'm not complaining about things "not going my way in the wilderness", I'm complaining about the fact that the game dangled a really compelling reason for me to go there in the first place. PKers have it stuck in their head that PvMers somehow don't understand that they can be attacked in the Wilderness, and I've never understood it. 
---
Furthermore, if you ever want to do any raids or end game PvM, you DO need to enter the wilderness for the imbued god capes.
---
Definitely agree and I like the idea for the armour buff too
---
Ahh to be young
---
You got a batarang?
---
weirdo shit man
---
this is amazing
---
Wtf he made the song and sang it himself? 💀
---
Rip
---
&gt;comparing getting pked to cancer
---
Gf
---
This is fucking amazing
---
Suffering and anguish.
---
I'll be honest....it maybe dumb but if he was singing that the right way it's impressive. Force the vocal chords like cookie monster voice and that'll fry youe voice. But if he is doing it right and just adding distortion then he has some kill and just needs to work on it a bit
---
yea on paper maybe but there is really only one spot that is that undesirable and considering you still have to go to it inject it kinda makes it less useful if it was made into a dart we could throw at spawns from a bit of distance and kill it would make it much more useful and it even says its aerodynamic in the examine so would be neat.
---
I think the more impressive thing is that it’s a 7 item chest, I believe it’s the max amount of items you can get
---
Basically he said that this isn’t very surprising because if you move in a spiral (on these specific tiles) the mole will follow you and get hit by multiple cannon shots because it’s a large monster....  
---
  
---
I have no clue why he felt the need to make it so long though
---
off-task is just punishing yourself.
---
While I agree on the sentiment that the rich should give to the poor, unfortunately in this game you use your invested money to make more money. It’s a never ending cycle, so people do not tend to give.
---
Although that being said, they do give to the void that is the sand casino though...
---
This is like 2 cockroaches playing dominoes inside of some guy\`s dead brain.

Hey man, first of all, sorry you're having a bad day. Hope tomorrow is a better one.
---
Second though, I get you think that dedication in a video game is "cool" but it really isn't, and if you honestly feel that way I think it's a priority issue for you. I understand you want an additional "Flex" but the developers aren't going to suddenly lock jars, which have been in the game over 5 years and have tens of thousands in circulation, because you want to show off more.

Oh, the tired “he disagrees so he must be having a bad day” argument, nice one. 
---
I see you take issue with me casually using the word “cool” and I’m confused as to why. It’s honestly less about the flex and more about rare uniques being worthless because of it. But you know exactly what I meant anyway. I understand that Jagex fucked up beyond the point of no return, so it’s a moot point. Regardless, it was an admitted mistake on their end. I’m not entirely sure what you’re arguing here.

This made my year.

Also should specify that your phone needs to be rooted for Vanced to support google login services. Easy to do, not something a lot of people are willing to do.

Can I get this with the Benny Hill theme?

I mean tbh swampletics is pretty amazing and I love watching the series, but it really isn't anything other than just extremely time consuming. It's like having an account where you only train crafting by making coifs. Its a true feat of patience, but like... There's better ways to train crafting

Yea I 100% agree, I used to do wildy slayer when getting 2 emblems in 1 task would be 10x the gp I would make from a cheldar task. But now I can afk at Kraken not having to look at minimap constantly and potentially loose a whole invent of loot. The wildy bosses are also so scuffed, once youve got them safe spotted its boring cos you still have to stare at the screen incase of pker but theres nothing to do boss mechanic wise. Also Ive tried pking bots at west dragons in total welfare gear and if a legit pker shows up I tele out or box a dragon because I stand no chance against someone with a total maxxed out mid level pk acc (around 107 cmb and im 104). They have better gear, better stats and rigour and a PK build and im just fucked xd
---
wtf so sick lmao
---
Not enough karambwans

But lots of people at that level skip tasks that aren’t profitable and wyrms aren’t really a hot money maker. I haven’t ever seen a tbow at wryms personally.

Lol welllllll im irresponsible with my points so dont judge me!!!!!

Well, to be fair, so are the ones in WoW I mentioned.
---
I forgot how much I loved Tiers 4 5 and 6 in WoW. Damn...Nostalgiagasm. I wish classic was burning Crusade instead. 
---
Man, Burning Crusade-Mists of Pandaland were some of the best years of my life, along with 05-07 Runescape. Maybe I can get my account back somehow, or maybe I should try classic.

Never played RuneScape before, but I'm interested in the game. I have a few questions:
---
* Should I use the RuneLite client? This has been recommended on the few YouTube videos I've seen.
---
* The YouTube videos I've watched have focused primarily on swords/bows as your combat weapon/skill. But I love using magic in games, so is it possible to use magic/staves as your primary combat skill? I'd want to be like a wizardy/magey type of character.
---
* I also like playing summoner classes a lot, so is there the option to have pets/summons in OSRS?
---
Thanks so much if anyone can help me out! :)
---
You have a tbow on your hardcore... but can’t kill vorkath?
---
Do you play UIM? That mode is very unpopular as it is and dying frequently is a large part of the meta.

Updated the OP now that I've finished the deed. 
---
Thanks for the input
---
It does not - you can download non-root versions of Vanced straight from their website. It specifically has a non-root section.
---
I think avantoe tar would be great. Its already a pretty cheap herb and it will raise the cost of avantoe and hopefully slightly lower the cost of ranarr's as they will be both competing on the market albeit for different reasons. Harralander only costs a bit for iron men as its not as easy to get as marrentill or tarromin. And the weapon of black sals is cheap and only good in one boss case. We don't need to make a new op weapon here just something slightly better than black sals. Think Rune defender---&gt; dragon defender. Or dragon gloves---&gt; barrows gloves.
---
Have you been to the channel? It has nothing related to OSRS. It's just music videos
---
&gt;It can easily be done with a bit of practice
---
This shouldn't be a metric for if something is OP or not lol. Pretty much everything in this game can be done easily with a little bit of practice. By that metric the Gorilla/hydra plugin is totally fine because anyone can swap gear/prayer and count to 3.
---
Do not lump grindcore in with whatever that is

Right but you cant use microg to log into your google account without rooting.

Add wings to BCP.

Everything should have wings. Massive ones. Especially BIS strength. BIS strength should be known as the "wings" set.

Prims? 10 foot wings.
---
Neit? 10 foot wings.
---
Tasset? 11 foot wings.

Something about the fortnite universe literally get sucked up into a blackhole. No one can play it right now because it's stuck in a molecular singularity.

Ogresses in corair cove is good also

Because ironmen should be able to do it, rs3 does this with group bosses for irons

For some reason most subs look at ad block as some warrior of Justice sent to deliver us from evil corporations.
---
In reality, it's just stealing.

Whether you fear the ads could be hijacked by some malicious third party, if it disproportionately favors one group or another, or if you just hate ads, the reality is we agree to the terms and conditions, and putting up with the ads is part of the deal.

Konar was their first try at doing a purpose behind a Slayer master
---
Her thing is that youre helping balance life as the death side. Shes told there's too many of x and tells slayer masters to take care of it. There's actually some cool lore if u talk to the blue tzharrs and blue demon dudes around there.
---
The other ones are just to say you killed badass stuff. Like "I'm a dragon slayer"
---
But can't iron men already kill bosses in a group?
---
Ew plz no

Dailies and Weekies are bad enough, not a monthly please

What's it called on the playstore? Can't seem to find YouTube vanced

Just checked the App Store. Didn’t see either. Does it require jailbreak?

Welcome to RuneScape pal.

If so, then just farm something for a few minutes and get your dscim urself. Begging is forbidden in this subreddit and neither should u ingame.

No, for Corp you have to solo. Luckily there’s a way to solo Corp thanks to a few items

How did you get trimmed stuff back in the day?
---
This isn’t that relevant to kq though since you kind of need to use the poh method to kill it without taking forever each kill
---
But if you do the poh method correctly then there’s only 5 seconds of it being alive before you reach the boss to kill it

Seems fine to me.+1 damape per 3 hit is +0,33dps, would be desirable mode swap could have an use in pvp to tb/stun accuracy as long as it addsrisk..

Not bad!

I'll always keep "carbidetools" on my friends list. He was my first real friend on RS and he helped me out a lot. If I remember correctly he was an older gentleman so I always worry if theres a reason my good friend stopped logging on..

This is pretty cool

Constantly adding pvm content to the wilderness and not even acknowledging the fact that mass clans are quite literally ruling the wilderness is a big part of the issue. When you keep forcing more pvmers inton the wilderness and not give the pkers any reason to even fight each other it's no wonder the wilderness has turned into a shit hole. On a side not does anyone else feel like the fact that wilderness bosses can really only be killed effectively by using safe spots and manipulating mechanics to be super fucking annoying
---
You also got ballista parts which I believe are rarer than zenyte as well. I got two on two tasks so I ain't even mad. They're good money regardless.

At first I thought "wtf is wrong with his eyes"

Then I realized. Sick specs.
---
Nice.

fuck off with your gaymanmode bs
---
Well since iron man accounts can share items, if you were to form a group then youd have access to items that you hadnt obtained thus defeating the object of iron man mode... surely if you have an iron man already then you would know the answer to this question.
---
not my proudest days

Small correction, no one owns any world, its just the worse someones gear or when theyre iron, the freeer the world becomes

I would make an exception to someone who died at dks with a fresh inventory of supplies, and then returns with more supplies.

I wouldn’t say banking at crabs means you lose the spot since it takes 15 seconds only. IMO.

Settle down there Mr. Keyboard warrior.

Best spot to train as a 50 attack pure, 73k xp/hr w/ BiS compared to ~45-50k in nmz due to the low attack. It's also way more afk compared to NMZ w/ 1 defence.
---
noice
---
I did over 1.5k off task (pre and post buff) and 300ish in task. Got 3 jaws in those 300 kills.
---
So then you should be able to pick up the ashes and hammer from the water surface too? Literally unplayable
---
Seems pretty meaningless. When people die on HCIM they usually see the account as dead, which is obviously much more punishing than just losing your inventory
---
That doesn’t net you 150k on hides though, which is an average vorkath kill. Picking up hides is not recommended.
---
How much money should I expect to spend for 125000 nightmare zone points? Is there a cheaper (but slower) way of earning enough points?

Allow us to enter Port Phasmatys without ghostspeak amulet without having to talk to the NPC (just like quick-pass currently works) after the completion of the Ghosts Ahoy Quest.
---
Eh, I see it as this mod recognizing this player does not understand how complex OSRS is, and wont want to play. Think about it, this personal literally is on theor second log in to the account, and being so willing to just ditch the account and start over just because of how their character looks means they do not understand OSRS. If customer support told them to go to the hairdresses in Falador, it would just piss them off most likely because they have no idea what Falador is, how to find the hairdresser, and even they have to make extra GP to even afford the haircut. Learning this game is tons of work, and doing all that so early on can be off putting for a new player who probably didn't even finish exploring Lumbridge. Creating a new account means they can focus on killing goblins and exploring a little farther for now while they learn.
---
gonna post again as I didn't find a suitable answer last thread. Is Void even worth it now for regular use other than Vorkath?

what's with all the mole pet posts recently?

And I love voting NO! ;)
---
you lash out at people over the internet because you’re upset that you never had a real family
---
As much as I like the idea those bots could really grief hard overstocking all the shops in the game making it so no ironmen could buy any shop items. They could also grief bosses or mobs let alone constantly bombing people in the wilderness.

I know it’s a joke though so +1 to OP.

But if pkers leave the wildy the economy crashes, red chins become worthless, the whole gilded altar community gets wiped out cuz everyone uses the wildy altar, bones crash to like 200 gp, ags becomes 2m, every drop from the wildy becomes worthless

&gt; Jars from bosses **should be untradeable**
---
The post is literally saying they should be. I'm not talking about why they ended up not being. I talked about why i don't care much for jars in general, and that making them untradeable going forward would be a weird decision with no real benefit, as pets already serve the purpose he wants jars to serve, in a cooler way.
---
Mutagens are cooler than jars.. and you wear Serp at a lot of places. You don't wear your house boss display anywhere. People able to see it can check your collection log, see your pets etc. Thats your showboat material, not a static display.
---
You're welcome to disagree, but to ask for my response and then say i shouldn't have that reasoning because "they never were meant to be tradeable" feels odd.
---
but then you got peta on your ass about harming animals. it's better to just use ancient magic
---
Tell that to clans at rev caves.
---
I mean, I'm preeety sure my mum gave birth to me, next Relevant question please.

I for one praise Satan as our new lord and saviour
---
basically the state of the left in 2019 lol
---
&gt; otherwise you wouldn't have any reason to go into the wilderness in the first place. 
---
Unique vs greater. The Wilderness is the **only** place to obtain certain items. Sure, none (save the d pick) are technically necessary for gameplay, but if you want those items for any reason - collection log or ironman, you need to go in the Wilderness. That doesn't mean those items are "greater", though.
---
&gt;A black chinchompa hunter would need to spend an average of 15 minutes out of every hour distracted by PKers before the experience rates would line up.
---
Yep. Twoish minutes per pker, ~6 times an hour. It's extraordinarily close. This is definitely combat bracket dependent though. 
---
&gt;You need to compare these bosses to their peers(low or no requirement bosses)
---
At face value, assuming completely uninterrupted play for hours on end - sure, they surpass their 'peers'. But you have to consider "dealing with pkers" to be a requirement - whether it's fighting back through anti-pking or escaping, and to me that brings them up a bracket. Your opinion may vary, of course.
---
&gt;Revenants offer by far the best GP/hr for their requirements in the game.
---
Assuming you go entirely uninterrupted and never die, which is never going to be the case considering the traffic. 
---
&gt;Dark Crabs offer the highest GP/hr possible with the fishing skill.
---
Tied or within 25k gp/h of sacred eels, IIRC. They might always be above, but it really is not by much, and if you get interrupted by a pker even once that difference is made up entirely.
---
&gt;Chaos Altar requires you to risk your bones. The risk/reward scales depending on the xp/hr you desire. Maximum experience rates at the chaos altar require you to risk noted bones.
---
Right, but you don't need to risk anything to gain a massive benefit from it. Even if you suicide every single inventory it's still the most efficient (if not boring) prayer method in the game because of how fast it is to return. 
---
&gt;Nobody is claiming it is.
---
Tons of people are. People are defending it, saying it's necessary for game health and that it's how the game has always been designed and should keep being designed, things like that. 
---
&gt;The lack of an effective snare spell made the spellbook borderline unusable in PvP. 
---
So? It's the free-to-unlock spellbook that also contains Teleblock. Why is it necessary for it to be more than that? 
---
&gt;The protections on the door were against cold not against magic.
---
Hum. I don't see it specifying cold or magic, but I *do* see that Dinh himself wasn't the one to place them like I remembered, so this one is yours regardless.
---
&gt;Until these suggestions end up on a poll, there's not much sense in discussing how they impact the game.
---
You make it sound like they're guaranteed to hit a poll, when that's no longer the case. Things are being pushed through as "integrity" all the time now, whether or not they're necessary changes - and it's particularly relevant for PvP. Hell, they started that magic defense change beta without polling if it should be changed in the first place - not a lot of dev time, since it functions like DMM in that regard, but that makes it seem like they're planning on making the change with no poll.
---
&gt; So long as the changes being implemented/proposed only impact the PvP community
---
Anything that goes in to the Wilderness impacts all areas of the game. Whether it's item or stat balance, new bosses, new skilling spots, etc, every area is influenced in some way. If a non-PKer can do it, they deserve a voice in its inclusion or change, even if they don't plan on participating in proper PvP. 
---
Unless you're suggesting that it doesn't matter since they're not PKers, in which case I would argue that PKers shouldn't get votes or voices when it comes to skilling or PvM content, or that a skilling/PvM council should also exist that can push things through since they "only impact their area of the game".
---
Congrats man! Now you can finally play the game
---
Currently if you die below 20 wilderness with an item that has been imbued with a trouver parchment. The imbued item loses its imbue, can this be changed so that these items would only lose their imbue if u die above 20 wild. I enjoy pking in both deep wild and edge/pvp worlds, but dont want to end up risking an extra 6 to 7m in parchments just because i switched locations. Also, Can the buy limit in the g.e on lms items be reduced? Since lms isnt as active as it was at first and not many items coming to the game. people have bought out parchments/crab teleports and have made prices skyrocket. Manipulating the market.
---
according to your comment history, you were in foster care. you were either lying about being a foster child, or you’re taking out your anger on other people over the internet. pathetic either way.
---
It's part of the experience. It's like going to Vegas for a vacation and not checking out a casino.
---
There had to be a data breach or something because my old ironman logged in and was in castle wars. No idea how they would get my email or my password for the account.

Queer

Life Is A Fight is one of the best bands ever.. also I Have Dreams and Jeromes Dream.. I actually had JeromesDream as nick on RS3.

 You want some of the best xp rates? Face higher risk. 
---
I agree with this 
---
what I don't agree with, is what exactly your  "higher risk" entails. PVP for me is really badly designed.
---
Please share and upvote this post for awareness. We all need to have more of this kind of content in our lives.

Awww cute, Thanks for looking me up, it means a lot!!

Thankfully your opinion doesn't.

I may have been in foster care, Surely you aren't that naive to think that a foster family can't be a loving one? Fuck me.

Congrats on the baby shark pet!

never said they didn’t love you, it just aint the real deal ;)

Shoutout to brokencyde
---
It's not just follow people at zmi. Plus we are getting a new mine with 50% more rc xp per ess that's untradeable because for whatever reason osrs rc ezscape has to be afk mining instead of unique rc content.
---
The way I see it is osrs pvp is like mario kart while other games are more like simulation racing. While there is a ton of luck involved, there is also a ton of skill and the better players do tend to win more. It's great fun if you're just messing around but if you take it too seriously you're going to have a bad time.
---
If they want to fix scout bots/revive wildy, here's what:
---
1. To fix scouting bots, the only reason they're there is because theres 120 or so worlds people hop to to find a fight. Making only around 50-60 worlds have access to the wilderness would solve this.
---
2. PJ timer to prevent teams from falling in on one person, plus to prevent ragging off as you go for a kill. 
---
3. Readjust magic accuracy, the Gower bros never imagined two people with 99 mage would be fighting each other with ice barrage and tribridding and shit. 
---
4. Fix skulltricking to allow a left click option. Or shit, runelite should let you mark players so people can't use IIIIIlIII names to do it. Still very easy to skull trick with this addition (Skulltricked 20m in 2 days just doing the login after dying to someone on a bait) 
---
I have a lot of hours logged on both pvp and pvm (99 slayer), but PVP has been the reason why I still play this game. I'm actually taking a hiatus until they actually fix pvp just because I can't take getting pj'd, splashing 5x in a row off pray, and too many worlds. The reason why most people use teams (or atleast my clan does) is because it's so hard to find a fight because you're hopping so many worlds that when you do find a fight they're usually in the same boat. The other reason people team in singles is to guarantee a kill on someone with risk and to pj off monsters.
---
But please Jagex i fucking love this game, 0 pvp updates at runefest means nothing will change.
---
Snowball can meet my Granite Maul.
---
That sounds awesome until you realise there's only like 2 bathrooms on the entire planet.
---
Nah, ya lost the spot.  It’s a magical property that banks in runescape have.   They make you lose any spot you may have previously had, pretty amazing really.
---
Mehhh I've met a few really toxic pvmers when I was going for 99 slayer. People that would crash my Kraken world in full max mage and tell me to kill myself. Or people that would crash and do the same in full max. I've only met one genuinely toxic pker that I could tell he lives vicariously through the game. For the most part, I'm usually really nice to people and that in turn leads people to be nice as well, even if they were toxic in the past.
---
Whats the item right of your spade?
---
So if I log in a level 3 with no bot on, scout worlds to the same effect it's fine?
---
You obviously got beat yesterday :)
---
I assume, seeing as he posted here, that this subreddit got him into the game. Especially with the huge push for Runelite we have here.
---
What’s the best place for moss giants? I got 10 obor kills last night and that bastard didn’t drop anything good
---
I was at the store today and seriously considered dropping nearly 1.8k today on a high end PC they had, of which 1/3 if that cost was just the graphics card.
---
Then I remembered all I ever do on my PC is play osrs and browse reddit. Currently I use is a laptop I paid $449 for over 5 years ago. if I still had my PC from literally 2005 running Windows XP and had that shitty rubber ball mouse, I could still play osrs and watch youtube. Although, maybe not at the same time.

If you’re using a iPhone you can use iOSemus and download it that way, it uses emulators. Have to download online tho

In a twist of irony to that item description, it becomes worth less when cut.

We don't know for sure

Perhaps a maxed player gets a different one ;) good luck finding a maxed player without the quest done, though :p
---
you probably got phished at some point, either when you used public wifi or when you clicked some outside links about double xp or something
---
Well I was not expecting this tip, but it is more then welcome!
---
Thank you :)
---
How many worlds exactly? The timer wasn't removed just made much higher... but if you're hopping worlds to buy out every vial pack or something you'll still probably hit it.
---
Makes sense. Big sites are more profitable hacking targets than random shit sites.

What minigames do you find fun? It’s hard for Jagex to take your feedback when they don’t know what you consider FUN.

Tbh I posted this as a joke to mock all the firecapes I’m actually pretty experienced in pvm. but yeah this was a 3 hour attempt and looking back on it the gear is pretty funny lol never expected to get this far on an iron that’s for sure.

dont you need to leave for a bit to reset agro?
---
most reasonable comment in this thread and you get downvoted. this subreddit is fucking insane!
---
That's something I don't quite get. For instance Jagex claims adding ground item text is engine work, yet literally every 3rd party clients have done this long ago. Are Jagex unable/unwilling to update the client-side features like this, or are 3rd party clients implementing their code in a "hacky" way which wouldn't have met the security and quality standards of Jagex?
---
I'm genuinely curious about this.
---
This is pretty easy to solve, Put back in bounty hunter crater. BH teams will start and fight for dominance over Timezone and control at the time, ROT isn't capable of contesting as they are all Multi peasant that brick themselves when actually come face-face with a proper singles team..
---
Do you watch any osrs youtubers or streamers? Usually theyll have a pretty chilled out CC
---
For me it's the fact some monsters have like a 7/128 chance of landing on the RDT, but the implied odds means the calculation is that times the odds of each item to even the most common drop on the rdt comes out to like 1/400. Not a real comparison to a straight 1/300 drop like a zenyte at all. 
---
Basically, stop saying how unlucky you are to hit the RDT, you're not.
---
Yeah, I play that a fair bit. It's had some issues with connectivity and the like but it's still great. The new civilisations are dope as well.

I meant the definitive edition is coming out in about a month. Its a version which offers even better graphics than the HD version and the destruction is improved. The HD edition now appears as Age of Empires II (2013).

---
who cares
---
A nuanced combat system doesn't necessarily have to be fair or totally dependent on skill. Though your experience does lend credence to my point that there are other games out there that are more enjoyable for those seeking a pvp experience. One of the reasons I think shooters, mobas, smash, and most fighting games have a better environment for competition is because they are more dependent on skill than luck.
---
Luck doesn't necessarily make a game less nuanced though. Poker has a lot of nuance to it despite being almost entirely on chance. This is because acknowledging odds, and your opponent's actions based on them takes a lot of skill and experience.
---
One could argue that the luck in runescape is egregious and detracts from the experience, but I feel like many of the people who engage in runescape's pvp do it partly because of how RNG can allow a less skilled player to win, and that isn't always bad. A player winning despite playing relatively poorly might be the difference between them sticking with the game or leaving. From Jagex's perspective, that kind of experience might be worth cultivating, though one could also argue that every time a low-skilled player wins and becomes more invested in the game as a result, the player they defeated gets annoyed and loses interest.

Ive seen some plugins like reordering prayers.. can they see that i am clicking on another spot then I should click, or do they just get the info that I clicked on that prayer?
---
Those little fuckers are delicious
---
Yes they are! Why can't we report people for crashing.
---
Second option, Jagex claim that they wouldn't want things to be done in a hacky way.
---
Seems pretty bullshit to me as I've never had any kind of issue with ground markers in Runelite or OSB so I don't understand what Jagex could do better.
---
because that website is bad

Pkers are people who attack anybody in the wilderness. Who cares if some pkers are bad? There are bad pvmers too.
---
There are no rules to the wilderness (that's the point) so your arbitrary metric as to what makes somebody a "proper pker" is completely meaningless.
---
Don't really think this will happen. If they add better xp/hr methods for Runecrafting there will people complaining about a different skill having bad xp rates. Then that skill will get buffed and if that goes on every skill will have insane rates in a while
---
Two different kinds of people right here
---
Oh oh oh was this with runelite?  i love it!
---
it didn't go anywhere dude
---
and in fact if you go back and listen to it, you'll find you probably don't like it as much any more. i used to listen to a ton of j-rock and i still do, because i love it, but recently i decided to go back and listen to other stuff i used to really like. skillet, dead by april, breaking benjamin, three days grace etc... absolutely none of it stuck. it was just like irritating background noise

&gt;I don't understand what problem people have with being attacked in the wilderness.
---
Read the picture again. Read the title again.
---
OP isn't whining about being killed in the one place where players can kill players. OP complains about "toxicity" from PK'ers, while said PK'ers then go to complain why no one will vote yes to content that helps PK'ers.
---
This is basic stuff. How were you not able to read and interpret what is literally and plainly stated in the title?
---
My man go play the lottery.
---
you get more kills an hour and at minimum the 100 scale drop from Zulrah pays for the teleport and that's not including any other drops or the fact that you can get more than 100 scales

"Did you post on Reddit yet?"
---
Yes.

Farming pet is way over 13m xp for average drop rate I believe.

Guess what, not a single PKer wants to train their skills or quest just so they can PK properly. We'll take all the "necessary" stuff from the wilderness as soon as we get purchasable corrupt untradeables for the wilderness.

Except that's a terrible idea and not at all what RuneScape is about.

This is actually such a good idea lmao.

That congo dandy in the blue is a prick. I saw him kick a dog :(

I restarted last weekend (old char in rs3) and a dude bought my iron set for 500k. Thanks! I don't know what to do with that yet but I am now 40/40/40 rune guy ready to farm the f2p content

Judging by OP's screenshot he's definitely F2P, but that's good knowledge to have for when he (potentially) becomes a member!
---
I wish they'd make elites slightly better. I've done 200 on my Ironman and like 75% of them are worse than hard clues. All  they need to do is make magic seeds drop in pairs or increase rune bar drops to 10-15. That would make them better without being OP.
---
This is how I always know most of the osrs community is brain damaged, nothing is your world, your monster, your resource, ect. It's a mmorpg if someone wants to crash you that's okay it creates competition if you dont like it hop outlast the crasher or go do something else. It's not like changing worlds is some hugely involved process that takes time.
---
the timer is now 60 minutes, which means that this was obviously addressed at some point and therefore your post is irrelevant.
---
Cool vid man, I liked commentary a lot!
---
How come gnome children are attackable while no other humanoid children are? Does Jagex somehow consider gnomes as less important?
---
You're completely correct, unfortunately it doesn't seem like the jmod design philosophy to encourage non-tradables.  
---
Realistically, they prefer the "work hard/get lucky, get item, sell item for massive money, buy things you want" mentality.  They should be encouraging players to experience the new content by adding untradables.  "Forcing" players to do pest control, BA, and RFD are three of the most OSRS pieces of content to exist.
---
If everything is buyable, then why bother doing anything other than raids/vork, then just buying everything from new content.  Would anyone actually do BA if torso and diaries didn't need it?  Reddit laughs at credit card warriors, but then keeps on supporting items and content for them.

Yea, I realize who he is. But why does him being a PvPer devalue his opinion? 
---
He brings up a valid point. PvM is way too safe and currently has no repercussions for death. At the minimum, gravestones should be introduced like pre-eoc and if you don’t get back, gf your items. 
---
At least it would make some PvM content enjoyable again, instead of semi-afking and not caring if you die since you can run back 20 mins later and get your shit. 
---
Just because you don’t like PvP, doesn’t mean a real issue within the PvM community is invalid because a PvPer is the one addressing it.

 In regards to the Twisted League; I understand any pets we get in this league we can transfer to the next league, but have you thought about an option to transfer them to the main game or is this something you don't want to do? Pets are a big time investment and for a lot of people that's time that they could have otherwise spent trying to get one in the main game. I imagine a scenario where someone that has been trying to get one in the main game for a long time plays this league and they get a pet they have been endlessly hunting in the main game. Curious what your thoughts are on this.
---
Can we maybe have the option to purchase a respective pet with reward points in the main game if it has been unlocked in the league? I can see people spending their hard earned rewards points on something like that, and that in turn would increase the value of reward points while giving additional incentive to hunt for a pet in the league.

He only acts like this in response to someone either trash talking him or ragging him.

I’m not a pker, but I like wildy content a lot. I do wildy slayer and bosses often and I always carry anti-pk supplies when I’m out there. I’m not going to sacrifice much dps, so I take pretty decent gear when I go. If I’m risking more, bet your ass I’m defending it if someone decides to try to take it from me. 
---
Evading pkers is pretty easy assuming you’re only caught by one. Just fight back, throw a couple dds (suuuuper cheap, like zero risk) specs at them and get them to eat, then book it while they’re distracted for a second. People don’t really have to risk an ags if they’re not comfortable with it or whatever. I don’t use dds and run personally, I just kill them. Chally specs followed by a swift bop to the head with an elder maul has been pretty goddamn reliable for me so I’ll stick with that since pretty much all the wildy bosses are weak to crush anyway. The only one that isn’t weak to crush is killed with ice barrage, which good to have out there too, so it all works out. But if you just wanna run, dds is right behind d claws regarding damage outputting specs and it’s only like 12k or something lol (and if you do slayer you probably have a shitload from wyrms anyway). 
---
Carry some brews, restores, antifire (dfire bolts are crazy cheap and pretty op so they’re used a lot), antidote ++, couple tick eats, a tele out from 30, and like two stams. Rcb with dfire, diamond e, even ruby e if you want, in case you get barraged and they’re out of melee range. Throw in a super combat in on top of that and you’re geared to boss, slay, and anti pk if someone decides you look like a snacc. 
---
A lot of the time you can kinda tell by their gear what kind of build they have, so you’ll know whether to just kill them or gtfo of there. Not always the case, but usually the case lol. If you’re not down to either a) compromise dps and just take 3 pieces of good gear, or b) learn how to fight back, then you shouldn’t do wildy content imo. It pisses me off when people complain that they got pked doing ma2 or whatever. Either don’t risk anything other than runes (in the case of ma2) or just fight back, it really is simple as fuck.
---
Bro ur fixing to get ur party bombed by the IRA
---
and then people like you get called “snob” because you know what you’re talking about and they don’t like it because they think it all “sounds the same”. I’m very aware people don’t know the difference in metal genres, or care about it, but people who then proceed to say you’re a snob or “get over it” are pretty obnoxious. I don’t call all electronic music “EDM” because it’s not, is it? Listen to Aphex Twin and then Skirllex, it’s like fucking comparing Metallica to Gorguts (all gd music btw)
---
Who cares if elemental runes are cheap, they are a utility and there’s fuckloads of them. 5gp or 1gp doesn’t matter much.
---
50rc in f2p is steep for a bot but also, who the fuck cares if there are going to be bots? I am so god damn tired of seeing this argument to kill off new content from either jagex or other users “bots will ruin it”. So? Making fire runes alone is botted, making body runes is botted, there are bots that make 20k/hr mining tin ore. It doesn’t matter what you add, there will be bots.
---
My idea for an elemental altar that makes all the runes is that it will be a quick way to amass elemental runes, it would be economical for ironmen after 50rc to just afk some elemental runes as they need them, it would be useful for mages in F2p to be slightly cheaper.
---
That would be me
---
180+ chests and 4 items, I'm starting to dislike Barrows. The runes hardly matter to me anyway because BTW.

"ironmen are just walking collection logs"
---
....i have no idea how i missed that.
---
Idc they are undetectable
---
Keep acting dumb you know damn well the meme isn't the problem here.
---
I'm saying that this has a relationship to pvp since the motivation behind "revert death mechanics" is often "people don't go into the wilderness anymore". 
---
Reverting death mechanics would kill uim and therefore make me stop playing. 
---
Sure, it would make gwd risky again, but if you want a challenge, there is inferno and tob. Gwd isn't going to be challenging on a main unless you rush it with early stats/items.
---
This whole line of though basically boils down to "people don't like pvp, so let's make pvm less fun to make pvp look better in comparison." And that's just terrible logic.
---
Haha my wife left me for another man lol

Twisted League reward suggestion:
---
Untradeable League Cape. Similar to theatre of blood or cox capes this cape would be upgradeable. The more tasks you complete the better/more detail cape looks(e.g. 10 tasks, 20 tasks, 50 tasks, 100 tasks and so on). This would reward players for actually playing the game mode and trying to complete as many tasks as possible. And different from trophy, you would be able to actually use it somewhere because its in cape slot and not hand slot.
---
Nope o.o. I've never seen that before
---
Seems that's how young women are these days, they always have a "backup plan". I've certainly experienced no different.

That's right. Trident is the culmination of the magic skill as a whole. There's nothing wrong with the best way to use a style being as such, it's a high level, well deserved unlock. Do you think it would be better to have trident be useless and fire surge be better? Like? 
---
What do you want instead?
---
It's not a fine analogy, because you're complaining about a specific drop, not just any wrong card. If you were equally annoying about getting anything that wasn't a zenyte then that would actually make sense, but getting annoyed about certain non-zenyte drops is just retarded.
---
Yeah it looks crooked
---
Thanks Mod\_Phantom, Very Cool!

They already had a devblog about that in the past, but then nothing happened.
---
Is solo raids more profitable or teams raids?
---
That's what trees are for lol
---
Typical human psychology. They take on a hard-mode version of the game and use that to look down on the rest of the player-base (which is ridiculous because there will always  be someone who does it better). It's no different than infernal cape owners and their toxic behavior towards fire capers. "I have irl self-esteem issues, so I'm going to use this virtual reality and the anonymity that comes with it to shit on strangers". These people need to humble themselves and realize there will always be someone better out there. Woox could tower over every other pvmer in the game and be a toxic shat but he doesn't.

A “small game feature” would be the ability to use a charged glory to increase your chance of getting gems. That’s something a lot of people don’t know.

You are the one that doesn't understand language.  When people say "nobody owns worlds" they mean "there is no situation where someone is 'in the wrong' for crashing".  You may disagree with that, but at least understand it first.

Flipping is a never a consistent income so one day you might make 2 mil and the next maybe 10 mil and then 3 days later you lose 500k. The market has its fluctuations.

Training levels is never any fun when you only have small chunks of time to play, so maybe get more into questing, mini games, stuff that doesn’t feel like such a long stretch.

I can't find it atm, but this reminds me of a video I saw in rs3 of some guy declaring, "I am the world guardian!" and then some other guy popping up saying, "no, I'm the world guardian!" and then a dozen or more people all declaring the same thing, all fighting to be the "main character". I wouldn't be surprised if a similar thing happened if we all wound up in Geilinor like in SAO

---
Ehh depends if they're trying to escape. I say GF if I'm killed while pvming or clue hunting in the wildy. Its not that difficult to escape from a single player.
---
Highly doubt it with all the other pvp content in the game. Yeah pking at wildy bosses is boring to people who frequent revs, but there’s more than revs and deep wildy pking available to the pvp community. And people still do deep wildy, there’s a reason why everything skill/pvm-wise out there is op as fuck. That’s not gonna change, probably ever

It’s just resizable mode, it’s not a runelite setting, it’s in the base game

Frem Exiles was apparently a TAPP (personal project) From Mod Wolf.
---
I don't mean to be rude with this, but could future quests not come from personal projects? The theme was fine but it was very clear the quest was not given the same amount of dedication and work typical of quests, especially master quests. It was a fetch quest featuring one new area and a new best in slot armour piece from a slayer mob. I think we all know this content would have been better suited for a boss, but it seems there wasn't the available resources to dedicate to implementing this content in that way, and it also seems you were rushing to get it out before Wolf left. All I'm saying is it shows, and the result was something atypical from the current polish of OSRS quests.

Honestly I’m more concerned for the other ones because I rarely ever visit the GE, but I added those because why not? I still think it wouldn’t hurt to have them too.
---
You're saying it right now. You're telling me to deal with it rather than saying that they should check their behavior.
---
There's a button called "Report abuse".
---
It means they're an Iron Man, "Fe Man"
---
I would like to see ur calculations on that, seems a bit high tbh.
---
id love to pvp in this game but your choices to learn are either make a new account and level it a certain way then fund it until you understand what you are doing. OR go in to LMS and learn to be a sweaty as fuck brid and click 100 things in 5 seconds. theres no middle ground
---
Also with the setting: **Highlight Clicks** enabled.
---
Whenever they click a huge circle pulsated around their mouse, absolutely ruining the already piss poor bitrate.
---
I tend to think so too. What will likely happen is I will just try it and see how badly I get rekt, reassess from there.
---
Reported
---
It's definitely possible
---
I don’t really get what’s so special here.
---
The ahrims top is a bit strange but if he had torags legs or something on it would just be a normal barrows hybrid setup.
---
Literally no content in the wildy is worth doing on main accounts wym OP
---
Don't voting an opinion. That's hot. Jokes aside downvote if you have reason or facts to why the above is just wrong..
---
Go take a nap mate you're grumpy
---
Dragon heels btw
---
Quests aren't really my thing. But I've done a few.
---
Are you a member or not? If not, go to barbarian village and kill them as they have decent HP for F2P. That’s what I did to base 40 stats as F2P. Read the wiki while you train, it’s sometimes easier and better than always asking for help here or from other people. 
---
Set a goal to get certain items (barrows gloves, money for whip or various other items, Etc.). 
---
When I started playing again I just kept reading the wiki to figure out the best efficiency for training and then eventually set goals for myself.
---
Yes I remember. I hope they have something in mind.
---
Go do quests. This is a nice way to level your skills and when you have finished all f2p quests you will have been introduced to all skills and then its just skilling left. Or become a member
---
He’s easy to do but his keys don’t drop often and his drops are trash usually
---
Well depends on how long i want to do something. I can do vorkath all day and make a few mil but i cant do something for that long constantly without getting bored. So i would swap to some more AFK slayer tasks. But if i grind i can make a few mil a day with supplied cost taken out.
---
So once the link cable is out, the Quest will be able to function much like the Rift but with slight hardware differences? I'm sold. 
---
How hard is sideloading Android apps?
---
Small correction nothing is ever your world. While crashing is frowned upon it's not against the game rules.
---
Yeah it seems to be working quite well
---
Looooool bruh I got this as an ad yesterday and had to post the video in discord. Funny you posted this almost the same day
---
Yeah looking forward to it :)
---
Right? Noob was offensive language back then
---
Of course they'll be dead easy to kill. They aren't geared for a fight, have limited supplies and no way to fight back. Not hard to shoot a fish in a barrel.
---
What are your stats? You probably shouldn’t still be killing cows
---
When is the killer costume going to be a player items we can wear. I want to flex on kids in the wild.
---
A) joke 
---
B) tasks (if extended) are like 250 each, so actually consistently getting 1/800 requires a lot of points (I’ve rolled 62 times at this point, never got a task).
---
C) Bis items drop with lower rates off bosses with less hp than basilisk knights-3.5k dry (while a joke) is more or less unheard of for almost any other bis item, with a few exceptions
---
You got it man! Essentially it will become a rift s with just the additional need to purchase their link cable. I've heard it is going to be $80 usd so for me that is so worth it! 
---
Sideloading is extremely easy when you set it up. Pretty much just like an android store on your pc. If you end up getting one feel free to pm me and i can help you through it all
---
Having to reset at an altar would definitely be a pain, maybe can only reset out of combat?
---
lol the rs3 argument never holds up and the only people being banned should be the people that constantly bring it up. If you seriously think the only difference between osrs and rs3 is the graphics then you're delusional. Not to mention the graphics asked for in this post are completely different than rs3 as well.
---
I guess I'll try the wiki, thanks for the tip. Didn't cross my mind.
---
Didnt even blur out direction the sun is shining. Gf account
---
Huh, I had always thought they were expensive items - now I see they’re pretty cheap!
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
You made my day😂
---
Hello! You did me a great service by splashing for me from like 50-85 thieving. Thanks fam!
---
Nah, the only reason I do Kraken anymore is if I want an extremely AFK task. Kraken can rarely combo you out and I have hundreds of millions in gear that I would lose on death there. 
---
You shouldn't need food anyway with Sang staff but the risk of losing those items is the big no from me.
---
Fine I'll do the quests D;
---
Sounds kinda cool but it would have to be rare enough that it wouldn't over saturate the market and crash prices
---
Improved graphics will always be a big selling point. Unlike the high level content updates (not bashing), this one can actually attract some new players.
---
My man did the most nerdiest anti-nerd response. Its ok bro we nerds.
---
That's pretty much the point of the game lol.
---
Nice! I have Ironman con cape
---
This is actually absurd.  You're doing the classic 'if one kid in the classroom speaks, everyone is penalized.  Suck it up.' punishment system from elementary school.  All it serves to accomplish is harbor resentment in all of the innocent parties that are punished for a minority of wrongdoer's actions.
---
Also, you then empower anyone to have everyone associated with them banned by choosing to cheat in some obvious, visible way.  So everyone is each other's hostage.
---
I'd actually be shocked your comment is being upvoted, except that I think it's being upvoted strictly on the basis of mass hatred of anyone associated with these groups.  So of course any suggestion that involves hurting all of them (even those who are innocent) will be upvoted.
---
“Screamo music” lol. It’s not even remotely screamo. It’s more like shitty deathcore. People try to act like you’re being a snob for making distinctions, but if you can’t remember the main 3 sub genres (metalcore, deathcore, and death metal) then just call it metal. Screamo is a completely different thing that is not even a sub genre of metal, it’s more like a sub genre of alt rock or something.
---
I know, it's not a 34% chance that I would have the pet. The maths is more akin to 34% of the droprate towards the pet, normalising the droprates.
---
you right :(
---
max bad rc bad 
---
slayer good nmz good sword hit monster good
---
R/cutenoobs has that message about how “non BIS does not mean cutenoob”. That’s what’s going on here. This guy is just an average nub, he has no idea what the meta is, and probably doesn’t care. He’s killing the bloodvelds all the same.
---
That’s like 99% of osrs players, the bar is that most of them don’t leave F2p, when they do you end up with people like him who are oblivious to the entire concept of a black mask, slayer helm, salve ammy or whatever. Chances are he never did dragon slayer because quest puzzles are boring and he doesn’t even know what RFD is, let alone that the gloves are more than fashionscape.
---
When I see these posts I just see sweaty nerds jerking off over how good their EHP is.
---
I just started a f2p uim and it's pretty fun, would recommend. Just don't do suicide stuff
---
Given how they handled the elf reworks (didn't poll it, didn't give options to put it back all the way, etc)... I don't trust Jagex to do both an SD and an HD version without eventually throwing the SD version under the bus.
---
Cant relate. But that's only because I cant even get a fire cape
---
What does he throw at the end if the video?
---
i think it's just thematic
---
Gz
---
Fucking deathcore lmao
---
They should keep updating it and then release a version from 2007 in a few years
---
For example, just google “osrs melee training”. Find free to play, or paid if your members, and it’ll literally tell you what enemies to fight at certain levels. I just stayed at barbarian village for the ease of it. Then once I got members I moved to rock crabs. 
---
But the wiki is definitely your best friend when it comes to efficiency. Staying efficient will definitely keep you interested as you’ll be leveling up as fast as you can.
---
I wish they made it so you can weild spades and if you have no weapons just a spade in your inventory it would show on the map so clue scroll people can go group scroll hunting and spade bash pkers with no skull penalty.
---
Although it would break the game I still would love that for its moments
---
Instant hopping is important for the healthy PvP scene, though.  Where they scour the wildy and hop regularly to find where people are 1v1'ing each other, to find where the fights are.
---
That's my point. I don't know what to do and when. Even I feel like I shouldn't be killing cows but I don't know much about the osrs world lol. Another user suggested the wiki which I will try. Also I don't know my stats :/ but I can usually kill a cow in max 2 hits.
---
just skip them man, i removed the unlock after trying to kill 2 of them after the buff, totally not worth it for imho an insignificant upgrade when i use slayer helm almost everywhere and elite void everywhere else..
---
You might check out Torvestas Dream Pker.
---
Things are heating up!
---
Lovely work.
---
Obviously it's possible, but the opportunity cost is massive. Jagex isn't gonna invest a year of development for something only a slim minority of players would utilize.
---
God damn, I'm amazed how you retards *need* the /s
---
you dont want to use a Dfs to maximize profit and kill/hr if you're near max stats. You want the best offensive bonuses you can get. Avernic or d defender, lance, max str. gear, and serp
---
I thought it was the grind but lol okay. Thanks for helping.
---
Yeah, they spawn in the same order. Look up sulliuscep on the osrs wiki and there is a map that shows the order. Hope that helps.
---
Best way is either do quests or look up a guide on YouTube on ways to level up specific skills. Slayer is nice for combat if you’re a member.
---
I feel like you don't have a pure if you think you can full afk NMZ with 1 defence. Crabs have a 10 minute timer, whereas NMZ absorb potions drain wayyy quicker if you don't tap rapid heal. Plus, the xp/hr is way worse since quest bosses have higher defence than crabs.
---
The guy has like 20m in gear here. This isn't some guy who's just oblivious. He atleast was able to buy the acc/gold if nothing else. I never understand comments like yours assuming most people don't look up anything about a game and anyone who does is a "sweaty need". You're just a fucking loser.
---
yea its an old game, but I don't see any posts begging to bring back the OG demons because they look like absolute shit. hd was also released in 2008, not even a year after this games backup, and 4 years before rs3.
---
You're right, improved graphics are a big selling point for games. However, RuneScape has always had problems attracting new players, and dev time has been better spent catering to existing players. That's not to say that they should ignore new players, but if a player is only going to be turned on because of graphics, they're probably not interested in the mechanics of RS anyway.
---
The point of the game is whatever you want it to be
---
I hit fine on my 60 attack and 75 attack pure
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Well as a maxed 13 def pure myself let me give you some advice. At maxed 13 def you can get 59 prayer. You should always cap out your combat level with prayer, but 13 defence is a special case. In this case you should stay 55 prayer and cap out your combat level by completing the quest "a souls bane" this will give you 500 defence xp putting you at 15 def. This will give you access to varrock hard diary which unlocks varrock armor 3 which will provide you with some Skilling benefits, ge tele, 60 battlestaffs a day and more importantly it gives the same stats as mithril plate when worn. 15 defence will never effect your combat level as long as you stay 55 prayer.
---
Comments are correct about hp being changed around ~2010, but this guide is definitely from pre-2007
---
I saw the ad on a longbeachgriffy video too LOL
---
Why are you in the wild if you don't want to get PKed?
---
Always the darn couches
---
Yes if you do it by hand. Who would disagree with that?
---
There is so much wrong with this smh
---
It’s spelled “literally”. If your reading comprehension was better, we could have avoided this whole post.
---
What's your in game username? I'll take you on a tour.
---
Awesome, zalcanohost was getting kinda toxic.
---
This isn’t real btw, that’s 100% a jacket potato photoshopped onto a skeleton
---
Yes
---
Depends on what you want out of the game. The member quests, minigames, skills, etc are dope.
---
🤝
---
CTtS is fantastic! *As the Roots Undo*’s call-and- response style was my jaaaam back in school. 
---
The Blood Brothers were my favorite, but they were more post-hardcore than screamo, even though they’re the screamiest I’ve ever heard!
---
Staking - the guide:
---
1) Lose money in stake.
---
2) Buy bonds for GP (I know some RWT)
---
3) Jagex Profits
---
4) Lose money in stake.
---
5) and so on..
---
Now if you take a careful look at 3), you will understand as to why the duel arena will remain forever
---
Right?! I'm amazed people actually listen and enjoy this music. To each is own but damn, that just sounds like headache 'music'
---
cant forget the dragon scimitar as a mouse pointer.
---
i thought they just served belgian beer there
---
Or even make a second account with the intention of being a member so that if you do change your mind you can always go back to ur f2p acc
---
bloods
---
lmfao so that 5 year achievement is nothing to really brag about then if you get 2 extra deaths
---
I always thought it was OH-zee-ak.
---
I dont get it, who's Steve
---
Take my upvote
---
I've done around 900 kills with melee and 90 with DHCB. I MUCH prefer melee, seems way more chill and woox walking is easy.
---
Literally dead content on release..?
---
You don't need to log into the account the request a password reset though, that would defeat the point of having an "I forgot my password" button. It's always going to fall back to keeping your email secure.

69 her

Funny you mention this.

[Here's my take on it from last year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/98fr0i/when_people_demand_modern_rs_graphics_in_oldschool/)
---
I was able to take advantage of the mobile 1 week free membership thing. So transferred a cannon and some gear from my main. Took me 2 days. I did waterfall quest first, then AFK'd at sandcrabs. Then did biohazard and plague city to cannon range at the ogre cages north of ardy
---
Actually it’s the Grand Exchange, god.
---
Was he wearing max str I need details hope he had that imbued b ring on
---
I see this guy ALL the time world 302 at g.e I respect his grind every day he's doing some sort of skilling for hours
---
Damn I seem to be the only one that couldn't listen past 10 seconds, congrats on the achievements I guess but that 'music' is horrid
---
With the new iOS 13 update, mouse functionality has come to iPhones and iPads. I would like to know if this will be allowed on the mobile client side and if it will be marked as “macroing” or not.
---
I hope you made the crackling spec sound effects with your mouth as you did it... cant spec without the sound effects fam.
---
What happens with all the p2p items when you return to f2p on the same account?
---
yeah no, now i just think the rewards are dumb as opposed to dumb and broken
---
New quest?
---
My votes for a Ballad of Fire &amp; Ice.
---
I'm assuming it's a bought account. Nobody wears that kind of gear and also has 70+ mining and agility.
---
I'm mostly interested in leveling up skills faster.
---
Berserk is biggest upgrade, if not doing slayer.
---
Hey congratulations on achieving 99 farming! That’s an awesome accomplishment. Hope you have a great 99 party!
---
They just keep coming and coming...
---
I don't think 500k runes will make them dip anyway.
---
What monster are you killing in the game?
---
Slayer helm 1st, berserker ring 2nd
---
Why do you have a ring of the gods? I would sell that and upgrade other gear
---
I would do it in the opposite way. Starting with the slayer helm followed by the salve amulet etc.
---
Yup, cannon placed in corp room = room taken. It's easy enough to find an empty world it's a dick move to crash.
---
They stay in your bank but f2p has less bank space than p2p so you might have to drop stuff to store in your bank again (unless they changed this and I dont know)
---
Slayer helm, berserker ring, archer ring, salve it in this order
---
Man steven is the best, Copying random stuff people are saying lol
---
Zerk ring -&gt; slay helm -&gt; archers -&gt; ring of gods
---
Unless u plan on using range mostly on tasks then archer first instead of zerk ring
---
Rdt could be 1/1 billion and it still doesn't make you unlucky for hitting it.
---
Nice, piece of shit, but you’re not wrong
---
How many people lost in limbo when your connection is interrupted?
---
Your skills (especially combat skills) will level wayyyy faster
---
Congrats man! You'll go dry and you'll have good streaks.  It'll all even itself out though! I've gone 100+ dry and gotten 7 items in 15 chests.
---
What a unique and innovative suggestion, no one has thought of this before.
---
Still makes the noise...
---
2k total should be a requirement to vote
---
All the wiki says is to talk to the chief again if you lose it. Are you sure it won't let you?
---
They should never add ARMOURS as cosmetics rewards ever imo.
---
Dragon dagger special special
---
Cumb always has the coolest interviews for the darker sides of runescape
---
Will there ever be a change to smithing so that 99 smithing doesn't make mid level gear? Just seems off
---
Ask Nicolas Cage over there for a signature
---
It won't happen because for some reason this community is anti update. They somehow connect everything to rs3 ezscape for no reason.
---
This username is making me go "really really wish I didn't run out of green last night"
---
Just commit to dropping all your items or chucking them in your bank's incinerator if you die... Do you really need a gamemode to replace shift-left click?
---
I usually stand at the GE and spew verbal nonsense such as “trying to lvl up my ass eating skill, any tips?” Until I meet someone who is as much of a meme as I am.
---
Major pvm content
---
Yeah this post belongs in the fucking trash
---
Thanks!
---
Aha! The deaf!!
---
You're chaotic, i liked that.
---
Ah yes the infamous elixir spirit shield sigil drop
---
I bursted nechs to 99 mage. I would say I broke even or barely lost money. Wouldn't say I made any noticable profit.
---
I really like the idea of an alternative RC training method. However, this might be too much and too complicated. It’s only worth it if you complete an entire cycle, and that takes too much time. What happens if you DC?
---
Express men
---
you really think theyd spread resources so thin? there's no way they'd double their development load like that. it's absolutely be one or the other
---
how do i subscribe to someone on reddit
---
they usually do it a week or so prior
---
Shouldve naruto ran at her and did AGS spec

Lmaooo

I don't play RuneScape I just come here for the memes. Enjoy your tinnitus and awful taste
---
8.5 hours a day for a year. 
---
i have no idea if i should be impressed or disgusted
---
How many people do corp before dks and cerb lmao? The only place where spectral could potentially be useful outside pet hunting is zammy gwd and most people don't even bother with it there lol. Arcane is very useful for solo raids but I wouldn't expect you to know that lmao
---
Dragon dagger super special*
---
Exactly man people need to learn not to take 4 fucking 50m items and complain they cant anti pk because they’ll get skulled tricked. Even skilled with Veracs and ballista your risk is like 3m.
---
yes sir
---
Fingernail length (thumb) in mm?

I repeat:

I meant wear as a cosmetic. Like how players wear bandos while they fish.

"Why is there a skull above your head?"

I salute you

Ely is a minor upgrade at inferno, good at arma and that's about it. You can shield flick in a bunch of places but almost no one does that lol, ely is niche as fuck
---
bank sale
---
i understand the arguments for both
---
Arcane is very useful for tob and solo cox lol
---
Or does The Great Olm look like the tree???
---
Oh-zee-ark
---
Those invent tags lmfao
---
Jmods have already said this will never happen.
---
Why am I at a party playing runescape?
---
Why am I at a party in the first place?
---
What are you talking about. The rs2 faces were neat. The current ones in Rs3 suck ass tho.
---
you could explain that behind the reasoning of "it takes time to assimilate half of an entire city back into the other half".
---
Ganbate dude Holy shit that is a dreadful looking experience
---
Can I offer you a nice He in these troubling times?
---
Omg just pked dart bowl (dark bow)

Then they hire another artist to disturbute the workload of making textures.
---
Brother the comment I'm replying to is about his stats

Take a cut sapphire, gold bar, and [amulet/ring/necklace/bracelet] mold at a furnace, and you can make sapphire jewellery.
---
What's your zuk kc?
---
&gt;smoke devils, kraken
---
lmfao. 75 IQ plays right there
---
Thats a big yikes
---
I like to imagine that’s just a regular melee weapon and dum-dum gobbo just sits there manually casting with a negative magic attack bonus.
---
When does one pop?
---
Sweet
---
But...in lore it's literally recolored Justiciar armor. It would be really, really weird if it didn't look similar.
---
I completed an arcane shield (sigil, elixer, and shield) in 19 kc but I have been a apart of hundreds of corp kills.
---
Isn't that how Sophanem works though? And to a lesser extent Prifddinas?
---
whats your kraken kc rofl
---
isn't Reldo the guy from making history?
---
They usually (not always) don't have many friends who can/want to help anticrash, they're almost always in pretty bad gear and, most importantly, they can't get drops if you hit their monster. They're also always solo at gwd (duh). Not really advocating for crashing ironmen but if you're at bandos on a saturday it's basically a free world.
---
You cannot do that in vanilla
---
r/ihavesex
---
Hmm? Farming is my main source of profit.
---
Herbs, seaweed, papaya trees, and a celastrus every day and I'd normally profit about 300k per run.
---
What? If they have the assets for RS2 they could just give us that? I am assuming RS2 is from 2008-2012. They would not even need to bring in any new updates, since RS2 had content for years... Nex, Dung, all mini games, comp ETC. I would not mind starting fresh on that tbh
---
If you have legit 0 GP and nothing in bank you can try doing the gauntlet to rebuild some GP to buy some items. Gauntlet only require song of the elves. You build all your gear and food in their. Their is also a chance to get the blade of sealdor to sell for like 90m. one you build up the bank you can try doing zulrah or vaorkath in weak gear to build up again to buy things. Then once your banks gets up time to raid.
---
Yeah on a serious note IUM is actually just aids and uses a lot of abusing weird shit. 
---
Hidey holes as an update really made UIM too. 
---
It’s due to the complex nature of rs that makes it hard to keep it “self contained”
---
I have said forever changing death mechanics so deads are actually meaningful would be good for the game but fuck me 😭
---
Ice barrage
---
If cost is an issue - why not an official Jagex kickstarter? Have the part of the community wanting RSHD fund it.
---
$11
---
They just need to eat the damn cost already and rebuild the OSRS engine with additional developers and continue normal content development.
---
OSHD, GPU rendering needs to be a priority.  OSHD does not have to implemented fully, but it needs to be readily developed for should it be decided an upgrade to the graphics is needed.
---
I know there is a significant portion of the community who would love OSHD but we need a proper client build to support it which would also significantly be benefited with GPU rendering.  We also need multicore processing.  We can keep 50fps but fuck, it needs to be stable in every area of the game...
---
Ely/spectral are both completely useless at kraken cause Sang heals you more than kraken hits you for so the minor dps increase is better than defence. Literally the official gear setups discord with 26k members ran by oblivion members has arcane in their setup. You're so clueless it's sad.
---
Not as thicc as a bloodveld
---
\&gt;They get shredded by any one with a real build  
---
Wot....  
---
You realise its a CLAN build for a reason right? Just like these people with "Real builds" suck at clanning...
---
Devalues my infertile ironman
---
hes dressed like a noob. his glory enhances this. 10/10
---
They literally can't, I don't know what's going on in terms of the technical stuff, but they've repeatedly emphasized that engine differences between RS2 and OSRS makes it impossible to import any content, even visual updates, from even the same year of 2007.
---
What's wrong with a cosmetic and an upgrade as a unique?
---
What exactly about his stats screams “efficient” to you?
---
is this a jojo reference xdddd
---
It's bis at both buddy
---
Ask who's got the cocaine to celebrate such feats
---
How about providing the correct information then? 
---
It would provide purpose for your comment.
---
Training melees before slayer
---
Droprate is 50/50, lol you just bad.
---
She’s just a looter
---
Bahaha were talking about irons you fucking moron. For 99% of irons and majority of players still doing Kraken they dont have a sang and Mages Book is BIS. Hard to read with all that sweat in your eyes?
---
Chef hat :)
---
and you think people care about the bullshit you spew? lmao
---
Fk that. Typing this as I am half asleep at work right now.
---
I actually support this; i'm sick of seeing end game content designs/power creep, this fills a gap in f2p that should be filled.
---
I am surprised no one, or OSBuddy have done this yet. I would gladly pay extra 10$ monthly to any client with the old HD features, and I am sure a lot of us would. Let's not forget that OSHD had 10k+ registered users in less than 1 hour after it was released. I am beyond sad that they had to shut down.
---
First off it’s not a phone game just because you can play it on your phone
---
This is wrong in so many ways....
---
Clanning is still just as organized as ever. 
---
It's not all about "who can pull more numbers" except for basic wildy trips. But thats not even just clanning. If you're solo you're going to do worse than if you're with 3 of your buddies on a small man. It's always about numbers. Clan wars, pkri (wildy wars) and such are always matched ops or a agreed upon offset for teams with a disadvantage. for instance mains vs zerks, the zerk/tank clan will get more numbers to offset the fact they are versing mains.
---
this is not at all why pure clans accept 30 def. Established pure clans have accepted 30 def for a LOOOOOONNNGGG time. I personally don't agree with it but I'm also not a fan of pure clanning personally. But to act like it's not their roots is asinine.
---
Because its already been said by others.
---
as the prophecy foretold.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Can we get a vibrate when idle function for mobile?!
---
I think we all remember being exceptionally good boys for the first week or so after our parents subbed us for the first time.
---
the same logic could be used to an item that you just called broken beyond belief, and an absolute monster of an item

Blowpipe is the culmination of the ranged skill as a whole. There's nothing wrong with the best way to use a style being as such, it's a high level, well deserved unlock. Do you think it would be better to have blowpipe be useless and arma crossbow be better? Like?
---
Nah, they’re just an asshole.

I hope you went to runelite.net and not . Com

That shit wqs soo funny i thought it was a weird Osrs ad for thw longest time
---
Yeah good point. I was talking more about the gameplay itself. The fact that you can't just jump in anymore is probably a bigger reason why theres no new pkers than osrs pvp just being a shitshow.

About 403 billion GP if you only get twisted bows and raid 24/7.
---
It would have to be killed by 6 million different people
---
Do macs not have the ability for screen shots?
---
Not how drop rates work. But I agree
---
Could probably do zulrah pretty decently. Can definitely do barrows.
---
ya i’m just lazy
---
I'm pretty sure the whole logging in and out thing was an annoyance for people who didnt have huge bot farms of scouts at their disposal and I don't think anyone is really advocating for the hop limit to come back.
---
Your suggestion (while i didnt read all of it) seems to have some holes "unable to engage or be engaged in any pvp" is easily abusable.
---
Also you would kill the wilderness further for PvMers if they have to stay in the area. This change would make escape far more difficult.
---
Pfffffttt this guy you can't fool me. 
---
Salve ei only works on demons.
---
Everyone who does their farm runs:

*internal screaming*
---
You can set things to highlight a certain colour to help make switching easier - all range gear in red outline, mage in blue etc. Makes it easier to notice if you missed one or misclicked.
---
Midsommar wants to know your location.
---
Barrows 
---
Blast Furnace
---
Get the stat requirements and quest requirements to do Dream Mentor. Then humidity.
---
You haven't changed the scenario.  You've just said that anyone who is in a clan is guilty by association.  This is incorrect and, as with the previous comment, is only riding off of the general hatred this subreddit has for PvPers.  It's entirely possible some people are in clans without knowing of the bad deeds of a few.  
---
Critically, even if they all do know *now,* your suggestion makes it possible, hereforward, for clans of innocent people to suddenly be mass-banned at the whim of one person who wants to spite everyone as a prank by loading up a bot or something similar.  Essentially, you make joining any clan a contract where you sign away your innocence and take on collective guilt for any wrongdoing anyone in the clan might commit.
---
lol my pure has UIM in the name to bait people into teleing to me in BH
---
This would be a sick tat
---
Congrats! And nice rolls my guy. If only we all had chests like you
---
I don't see why you couldn't. Just update the models and textures for players who've completed the quests. Everyone else sees the run down city.
---
Sire drops are actually really annoying. You have a 1/100 chance, then a 1/2 chance to get an item, that you have to do THREE times before you can cash out. Once you get one bludgeon piece it feels like your obligated to complete it which could take upwards of 600 kc.
---
All the decent methods are botted and therefore not decent anymore. The best you can do is get good at flipping on the GE. Partyhats are pretty stable and maybe something like lobsters, but like other people have said buying your first month if probably the way to go.
---
What's up with so many players getting on reddit to pointlessly complain?
---
And dont tell me they dont lmao.
---
I've seen them complain about misspellings, simply to complain. I've seen them complain about 3pc, simply to complain. And I've seen them LITERALLY complain about how streamers are treated in-game. I'm sick of all this whiny garbage cluttering this sub. Jesus H Christ now I've seen it all.
---
Get a grip, get a job, and get a girlfriend.
---
Do keep in mind that lore driven players are still a huge minority most people that pvm don't care about it's lore and just about the boss and its mechanics and drops. Having drops that are just a recolored version of what you can get in ToB = poor design.
---
I also think that for an area such as slepe there's barely any lore so certain parts it's easily to re-write the lore about the armours so you dont end up with a poor design for the people that don't care about lore.
---
They can barely make it once lol.
---
In f2p we're talking dozens of grinding hours before you can afford a bond. I suggest you rather buy the 1st month with irl money and sustain it with bonds thereafter, as members have access to vastly better money-making methods.
---
I just got a hard clue scroll drop. Do I have to complete it before another hard scroll drops or is it still possible to get another one?
---
Just DoorDash for 2 hours, EZ Membership
---
I haven't seen this format in ages
---
would it devalue it really if given a lower chance of drop and it wouldn't be an efficient way of obtaining these items just an alternative and with the risk associated with it?
---
They're really not to be honest. No one just melee/mage forms nowadays anyway, especially since there's no turmoil for overhead. 
---
If you were to teach someone how to hybrid, then only for them to ask if you could also teach them how to nh, you'd tell them to include a ranged switch, and protect prayer from incoming attack from opposing player. They already have the basics down. 
---
They're not different honestly, just one is more 'advanced' per se. But you're right i forgot to include nh includes ranged whereas basic hybriding does not.
---
If you wanna teach someone how to brid, just go right into nh if they're interested in that style of pking.
---
- Hybrid -&gt; Mage/Melee, generally no protection overheads. Uncommon, rarely anyone fights like this.
---
- Tribrid -&gt; Mage/Melee/Ranged, sometimes protection overheads. I'd assume this is fairly common.
---
- NH -&gt; Mage/Melee/Ranged + always protection overheads. Most common form nowadays.
---
Use dharoks and rock cake
---
i dont pk but u didnt die so i guess thats good rite
---
nothing special about ur comment why even share it here
---
nothing special about this comment, why even say it here
---
You probably used a fairy ring. There's a chance npc's will follow you through and walk off screen.
---
if your parents pay for anything gaming related at 24, Y-I-K-E-S.
---
I doubt you really want to 2 hours outside West Bank spamming Merchant one liners to sell your armor trimming services
---
Also crushing the gen accidentally sucks
---
I have Solo in front of my name and I've never been crashed before when bossing. I have around 700 GWD kc combined and 300 DKs kc. I suspect if I did KBD without an instance I would be crashed, but most of the time people would rather find an open world than crash you. People do crash at nechs tho.
---
A toggle is very different from a straight upgrade. Back then you could only toggle for a short time, and the engine upgrade was mandatory. Maintaining both graphical versions would be a huge pain for every single update from now onwards.
---
An updrage nowadays would be possible if we deprecated the old graphics. I don't think the community would be very happy with that, though.
---
What do you mean changed layout? It doesn't have to be crazy, just give the npc's new clothes or something and make the buildings not have boarded up holes or giant X's on the doors.
---
Is there an in-game explanations for the mourners being there? I haven't done the quest
---
Ash said they're going to do it, it's just a matter of when. https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1097649050697064448?s=20
---
I was led to believe dhaoks is only better over obsidian at 92+str and att for the accuracy and damage boost, and until then, I shouldn't use it
---
Can we get drop rates on the gauntlet yet?
---
Listen, I don't care how much it costs or how insignificant, I will buy literally anything that helps me splash less on maiden crabs...
---
God Ash strikes again!
---
Maiden crabs would like a word...
---
I say use dharoks. With overloads you should be able to get at least 95-100k xp per hour at your lvl
---
Do you have the warning enabled when alching untradables?  It's off by default if I remember correctly
---
In osrs, you don't have to choose one combat style. You can train them how you want. So most people train a little bit of everything.
---
If you want to use magic, try training it to level 13 using lower level spells and then use fire strike from then on. It's quite cheap and effective. But I would try a little bit of all types of combat, especially meelee
---
Can confirm.
---
Yeah but goblin mail is too small.
---
Yes id much rather see bad memes and people requesting fanart of pixels noodlebrain

“When I was a freshman I got bullied so now I bully the freshman” 
---
Don’t be a dick m8.
---
No one has to hop, but if you're getting crashed there is no point to fight against it you are wasting your time.  My point still stands nothing is your resource, your area, your monster, your boss, ect.  This is an mmorpg there is going to be competition and you are braindead to fight with someone who is being obtrusive that doesn't care about losing efficiency or xp/drops.  Changing worlds literally takes seconds and if you can't compete (aka max combats) it's the most simple thing to do.
---
Cooked about 170 swordfish this morning, decided to run some errands and take a nap. Woke up to a ban 8 hours later. How the hell am i able to prove anything if I can't even appeal? Seriously, 8 hours since i went on. Does Jagex consider XP a third party client? 
---
I was nervous about even started to play again because of people randomly getting banned, never thought it would happen to me.
---
the explanation is that they are some elves from house ioerwerth that are both keeping the airs of there being a plague, and keeping an eye on the city of east ardy. As far as i remember.
---
Also, i suppose a simple revamp for post-quest would be pretty nice and doable.
---
His first time lol
---
Turned it on a while ago and yeah did have it on when I checked.

That better be a combat bracelet

Cuz it's British

Would you consider buffing the Karamja medium diary to make the 30gp boat rides between karamja/port sarim and brimhaven/rimmington/ardougne free at all times? Currently, only the former is affected by the easy diary, and requires wearing the diary gloves for a 15gp discount.
---
This would be useful for fruit tree and calquat runs, when using the ardy teleport -&gt; boat route.
---
I got banned from that sub for the comment I made here
---
For certain bosses like bandos/K’ril, I can literally only solo it on worlds under 600people and my ping before it starts lagging (I flick the minions during the kill, so after getting used to a rhythm, changing worlds completely offsets it). Instanced bosses when :(? My kills/trip go down from 10-15 to around 3-5 when I’m in a laggy world.
---
You can mine gems.
---
Edit : This sounds like a no shit sherlock, but there are gem rocks on karamja that always mine gems.
---
Yeah, so they can easily find a new world.
---
To figure this out you use the form 1-(1-x)^y where x is the chance of drop (1/3000 in this case)and y is the number of ‘rolls’ (15 in this case). So 1-(1-(1/3000))^15 is about 0.5%
---
I have no attitude towards others, I just don't want to waste my own time trying to find a world.
---
Whenever I see posts like these I like making bets on whether or not this is bait for wildly boss killers to bring more free loot for clans
---
I was going to attend this, but my account got banned for some reason.

Contrary to what everyone else here is saying, it won't be 'easy'. It's definitely doable, but if you don't have any Jad experience, it will be a challenge. One worth overcoming. Good luck! As others have said here, blowpipe-Addy until Jad then dragon darts on Jad.
---
...yes?
---
I laughed so hard seeing this screenshot in the middle of all the other video game screens in the customer images section on amazon.
---
the client was banned because they directly stole assets from jagex, then when asked to help jagex make the code work the code was unusable because it was more spaghetti than osrs spaghetti
---
Do you have trust issues or something?
---
I started with iron in my name, after I grew to a level where I was doing dks and wildy bosses I took it out, it's like my friend with hcim in her name who died doing mage arena like if ur gonna go out there change ur name
---
I got 2 on my first 150 as well! But I got one more from the next task, it can happen!
---
I would love a day/night update. It’ll give lanterns and light items much more use
---
Yes,sir. I do :(
---
You're making way more money tho
---
Although I am not a painter, I think that the subaqueous qualities of the Egyptian motifs visually and conceptually activates the essentially transitional quality.
---
Use g maul with surge you dont needs the ornate handle really. Obsidian is best until you hit 93 hp or something.
---
I hope people realise why your comment is hilarious
---
Should have ice barraged her and hop worlds under her.
---
I've probably only done this 10-15 times from 80 to 99 but dammnit if I wasn't sore about it for minutes afterward each time.
---
Thanks for the reality check! What other gear should I have? Right now I got barrows gloves, nezzy, zammy top/ chaps/ boots, glory
---
No
---
Theres one thing you cant do though. You cant take money with you when you die but the satisfaction of knowing you enjoyed your job all your life, that's priceless

Was the knife pointed down like the dragon dagger or pointed up like all Bronze-Rune daggers?

I'm at 313 chests and 7 items lul
---
Damn, if only theyd add that

thats decent stats - and yes you can solo but i don't know at what level. as for gear im using elite void, zammy spear, crystal halberd, bandos godsword, amulet of torture, beserker ring imbued, primordial boots, and a blessing

That’s pretty much exactly what I’m saying though. I don’t think I’ve ever once made a post about revamping (to harder/less forgiving) the death mechanic without being downvoted to absolute shit, often with little to no actual response. It makes it abundantly clear how people feel about the idea, but offers very little clarity about why. 
---
My first thought is that people just want the game to be easy, but that really doesn’t hold any water when you put it next to all the other shit this community believes and the constant pushback against “ezscape” changes (often pertaining to things that are WAY more minor than literally never losing anything when you die) and things like clients making stuff faster/easier. It’s truly confusing to me.

ok that's what I've heard. thanks! 
---
what sort of training method is best for defense and attack at my level? and will dharoks be the best at 90ish like it would be for str?
---
That would be an amazing addition to the game.
---
Sounds like a new pker trying to get some practice.

No lol.. you sound just like everyone else.

they're tagged because i was using them when learning tob and didnt want to focus on switches but just the raid mechanics. just havent turned them off since i never felt the need to
---
Does jagex expect people to be looking up what is and is not bannable? Their stance on 3rd party clients is the same, either they outright ban them or endorse 1 specific client but picking and choosing can end in mass bans on innocent people.
---
They really ruined the economy by making PvM be completely risk-free but still be so insanely profitable. If you’re at much of a risk of losing your hard earned armor and weapons doing slayer or bossing as you are mining, fishing or woodcutting, why does it quadruple potential profits at the same skill requirement? If Gargoyles are 75 slayer and magic logs are 75 woodcutting, both with zero risk attached.. why is one 700k+/hr and the other is... less than 100k/hr?
---
I mean besides the obvious slayer circlejerking why is this not something people are mad about?
---
We accepted PvM as profitable in RS2 because it was risky and you had the cost of supplies. People with the best armor, weapons and consumables who risked their banks to kill KBD, Corp, KQ and GWD bosses were legends and deserved that profit for taking that risk. When the death mechanics changed, PvM profits should have been slashed in half, no question.

I have a smoldering stone drop with a 0 KC Cerberus and 85 Slayer.

Go to castle wars and start discussing the complex nature of fashionscape with the others there :P

exact drop rate is unknown, offtask its 5 times rarer
---
Hey, I mean, the election doesn't matter if you don't vote.
---
It's okay, he already has the P hat so it's post robbery WoM
---
I'm well aware, but remember how long it has been since the code was first written.
---
Over 1/3 of the time
---
Probably goes without saying, but it's because it's substantially easier to restock on a normal account than it is on an ironmeme. A lot more work goes into the supplies when you have to do them all yourself.
---
Looks like a brutal black drag alt.
---
The best of the bunch
---
Don’t really have the money to shell out on chinning as much as I’d like to.

mind your business maybe.
---
I'm not even the person that helped you out. 
---
Go google your simple question if you don't want someone to answer with more than a no or yes. If you were seeking blunt answers and being grumpy when a person is personable you shouldn't exactly come to a discussion board.
---
Go be an asshole somewhere else.
---
Keep trying! It depends on the "support" team
---
As more and more people continue to complain that the wilderness bosses force you into the wilderness to get the D Pick and leave you defenseless, why don't we change it? I mean, why can't the wilderness bosses use a tribrid style like Demonic Gorillas and take place in single combat? I think this would fix what everyone complains about, how multiple people stack one person for a kill. In addition to this, having them in tribrid style would allow you to actually fight back if you were attacked by a pker.
---
I'm just gonna spitball here. Maybe, he ranges a lot?
---
But if the change is SD and HD surely it plays the same so what would be the big deal if they added it?
---
I'm just questioning the helm
---
Yeah, they're basically free worlds. If you deal even a single point of damage on an NPC, they don't get the drop. It's also not worth fighting a crasher since you'll just be wasting supplies that you have to get back all by yourself, because you're iron. Not like you can just re-up at the GE.
---
That's how it is most of the time anyway. The maxed sweatys NMZ themselves up a maxed combat normal account alt for anti-crashing.
---
Who the fuck are you
---
Nobody helped me out, the only direct answer I got was technically wrong
---
This would be a very refreshing update to the game.
---
0 doubt. Just might take a few trays to learn the fight caves and jad
---
In 2008 they had a larger team than we have now and it still required outside artists to be temporarily contracted to work on it. And it was still buggy. Helmets would change/remove your hair for example. 
---
What op is suggesting is a toggle that will never be offered. Making a hd toggle requires making double the assets with every update. I could see potentially polling an entire overhaul but i dont see that happening because of purists
---
If you meant the double rdt rolls, hydra always drops two rolls of the rdt when it lands on it.
---
He has 4 99’s and you say all his other stats are low?
---
Not a question,

May the people answering the question look at the cameras. I know that either Mod Gambit or Mod Sween is asking the questions, they are the messenger. I know it could be hard and difficult to do, but we are the audience that the answers is geared for.

 As someone who is watching, I like to see your guys gorgeous faces.
---
If you wanna try the game you honestly gotta just buy membership. After a solid year youll be established enough to buy membership with in game currency.
---
&gt;Just trying to play the game like everybody else...
---
That's not true, you're not playing the game anything like the rest of us. When you get crashed you can't fight it because you'll just be wasting supplies that you have to get back yourself. We can just restock at the GE in a matter of minutes. 
---
It's just part of the Ironman gamemode. If a normal account wants the world, they get it.
---
simpler times

That fact is not very fun

Yeh orb dodging on guardians atleast acts as a "hey don't look at your alt account" moment of the fight but the vents for sire are one of the things that feels super weird for a repeatable boss. It feels like a mechanic of a raid boss or quest boss, and seems to have been designed to have been cool on release, with people figuring out the shadow spell stuff etc. But now that it's known it's just an artificial time addition to the kill with no risk or difficulty.
---
Wait, are you saying that me always doing combat in mostly BIS gear contributes to people not crashing me? Huh, I never even considered that. That explains why the guy who showed up when I was doing some Mole kills hopped instantly maybe. Looked like he wanted to stick around.
---
yo i'm still out here championing for a vanilla server, it ain't nostalgia either just prefer it

They can change the inventory icon without remodelling, they did that for the justiciar legs (getting rid of the skirt was a separate thing)

There was a gif a while back where they showed the tool, moving the 3d model around and how that changed the inventory sprite without any additional work.
---
The toxic blowpipe is only worth 74k more than the 20k scales it can be turned into. Whenever the price dips a bit people probably destroy them for a profit.
---
The GE buy limit for scales is only 30k every 4 hours. Maybe people are buying tridents and destroying them to quickly buy tons of scales.
---
I only crash at bosses, no chance some ironman with a hasta and mith darts is gonna outdps me at kq. Crashing at nechs/dust devils is kinda pointless cause it's so easy to anticrash

Yep!  Also applicable in streamer's chat.  "Hey @Streamer, I just smoked a massive bowl.  Notice me pls."

Id pay not to have hd graphics. Like if everything goes smoothly, then the best case scenario is half my content creators have this ugly ass skin. 
---
If everything doesnt go smoothly, we waste hundreds of work hours.  the engine is a laggy piece of shit like it was/still is on the main game. Loading line rushing is a thing because of the engine update that happened in 2008. Loading screens take no time right now but in 2008-2019 on the main game they take seconds. Game was really unresponsive too at first and id hate to go through that again. Then ofc every update from then all will require double the artist work. Oh and half the content creators use an ugly ass skin.

I’d say work on goals such as quest cape, or diary’s, these helped me level certain stats and quickly gain experience.
---
Then it just depends what you like doing. Don’t go for “MAX” 
---
Go for base 70s or quest cape then work up, I’m currently finishing base 80s while also heading for 94 slayer. It’s stops the burn out as I’ve felt the same multiple times on long “99” grinds. Usually only 200-300k exp into the grind.

I tend to run a level then switch to stop getting bored.

Hope this help.

People said this in 2013 and osrs still grew. Mobile inflated the numbers. The decline is rather small when adjusted. It could be better but a slight dip is nothing to worry over. One big update away from sailing back up.

Just like Eve, just the neckbeards are goatees.

That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever read.

I was afraid of that. The almighty money at it again.

You just know that the engine allows only discrete increments for icon scaling.

Can we make clue scroll bottles take priority over other items on the ground?
---
&gt; gap in employment

I fucking hate that that's a thing. I can save up enough money from independent income (renting) to take like 5 years off every couple of years or so, but then I just think how the fuck will I find a job after... So instead I blow my cash like crazy and only take vacations on my vacation days.

1. If 400k is a big loss for you, consider training with a cheaper but slower method
---
2. Fire talismans have a use and aren't dropped in large enough quantities to warrant picking up. Some demand and very little supply -&gt; high price
---
Nice try, bonds were announced 10 months after EOC.
---
Thanks for the tag! (:

Just in time for spook month

the united states celebrating two of their genocide holidays is essentially just an annual 99 slayer party

i thought that was the joke

Simple. If you're at buy limit or splitting with a team, just run south to the gates of the Grand Exchange and do it all there. If the money or items are important enough to you, you'll probably offer enough to make it worth someone's while to run south 20 spaces and run back. Likewise, if you want your splits, you'll all probably go down those 20 spaces as a group to split loot.

Damn that sucks. I doubt she quit because of that tho
---
Why do you think that is?
---
A lvl 36 I’ve seen personally had beaten it, so with those stats you’ll be able to brotha!
