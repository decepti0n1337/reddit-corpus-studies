Is there a bug involving the viggoras mace losing charges outside of the wild? I was on a troll task in koureand and my mace had 90 charges on it, part way through the task it ran out of charges.
---
---
---
Yeah maybe that's pretty steep for wha th I need it for, but i am certain i want a nice desktop PC
---
Definitely post 99 ranks. For example, if I share an account with people from all different time zones and the account was logged in nearly 24/7, we‚Äôd be able to reach 200m all in a short amount of time. This wouldn‚Äôt be fair because nerds like Lynx and Jase played only by themselves to achieve this (Jase not yet but in like a month or two)
---
Wait FM xp is only gained from wt? Strange for some reason I thought you could burn logs to get FM xp I will have to test this once I get home. Thanks for letting me know wt is the only thing that gives FM xp
---
As deep as this is going, it just feels like the issue with capitalism. Seems like this kind of system wasn't designed with our future in mind, companies trying to grow infinitely doesn't make any sense. Disney, Amazon, Walmart, and even in the video game industry everyone's trying to pull more and more profit without a goal in mind besides let's keep growing. In the end making more profit can only translate into fucking the consumer and companies that make games we love will soon outgrow their humble beginnings into becoming corporate power houses trying to suck us dry.
---
???
---
Haha lol omg good discernment. There‚Äôs a difference between a few minutes and 20 minutes.
---
Barbarian assault is the best. I‚Äôve done hundreds of high gambles. It doesn‚Äôt need xp bonuses
---
My mind inserted the word "leaves" into that title and I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
---
If I see you post this again, I'm going to send you so much furry porn that you will literally go out and buy a Bad Dragon toy same day.
---
This was the best thing ever when I was early game UIMing
---
I've been testing some of these bosses and it seems that the warlord is more trouble than he's worth. He's really the only one that damages me, why is he included?
---
If you die not in pvp your loot will never show for another person
---
&gt; maybe jagex will have customer service in the future
---

---
What do you mean? This is the customer service department!
---
Or what about the desert gods? That would be dope.
---
Nice
---
Now let's consider the alternative: not attacking the clue scroller and making 0 gp/hr
---
got a problem with someone engaging in content as designed? cry on reddit more lmfao
---
You should get your sister to play RS also. Couples who game together , stay together.
---
Oh wow didn't know that was a thing. Thanks
---
Clash royale is on the dashboard but OSRS isn‚Äôt?! üòµ
---
Engine work, they‚Äôre working on it though I believe. At least, it‚Äôs on their list of things to work on
---
F, you got me
---
Brother you are a nannerpuss but check my page cause I‚Äôll post KC there. Cba is to post in comment due to link requirement. I‚Äôve forgotten my imgur account.
---
Nowadays I just bring scroll, spade, wildy sword and royal seed pot so I keep everything. They won‚Äôt even get my spade.
---
What?
---
You're something quite unique, arent you?
---
Cause osrs is open I think, not sure why but the dashboard changes every time lol
---
It's fine. He's got two working hands.
---
C
---
SwampIetics btw
---
Basically did the same thing üòÇ
---
Well you said 22m FM xp shows his wt kc so that must meant wt is the only way to get FM xp right? Otherwise FM xp does not equal at kc
---
Lol wut, how? Anything you can take a screenshot of you can also a picture of.
---
wtf when I splashed at ardy, no one offered me any bonds :/
---
Man haha u got rekt with the downvotes. Thought it was pretty funny
---
[removed]
---
I hope you find it :(
---
That pet gives me night mares.
---
Probably should have done that in the original post since the original post currently just says I killed wt once and deserve a pet jamflex plz give it
---
&gt; This guy is an ape.
---
Gotta love the "this guy is soooo stupid lmao" from people who can't read
---
Yes, it doesn‚Äôt affect the amount of people coming in or out of the wilderness. Bots move to a new location and people slaying, well there were already people slaying to begin with. The numbers will rise more in the first few days then stabilize out to what it previously was. 
---
Yes, the first few days made more people move into the  wilderness, however it soon became dead after a few days. 
---
So in no way did this content reflect any variation of PvP additions. It just gave wilderness slayers their emblems back (emblems dropped over 100k, larrans key averages about 150k) and bots a chance to telegrab more wines, even when the new location is leagues further from a bank.
---
ESKEETIT  üòÇ üëå
---
This seems about right for him
---
Rock whatever colour you want. I choose green because I pretty much only use graceful with farming cape.
---
Lot of people on this dudes side but I'm waiting for the smackdown
---
Nah not upset just pointing it he has been proven guilty so the previous reply is complete shit idgaf if op is banned or not just pointing out his post provides 0 proof that he wasn't botting and jagex has proof he was botting so I chose to believe them over a random redit post.
---
Is setting it up like that not botting though? Surely something in the ToS talks about that kind of stuff, that may be why he is banned. Could just be that it defeats the purpose of the game, 'in Jamflex's eyes'
---
On to what now?
---
I can almost guarantee you won‚Äôt be able to solo him with those stats. You MIGHT be able to get 1 kill. But that‚Äôs a very heavy might lol
---
He‚Äôs just chillin in the distance with some popcorn, laughing his butt off
---
He did a couple times.
---
Wtf is with your luck
---
Lmfao that art contest is in the pocket bro
---
When you think one of the best PVP games is only fun for grinding PVM and skilling
---
July 25th. No major updates are happening between now and then according to the dev blog
---
Yeah and now they are ripping on content creators for telling them they are wrong. Its pathetic
---
LOL bruh I just made this same meme and was scrolling to see if somebody beat me to it.
---
I am honored man! Thanks for thinking I‚Äôm the best new artist!
---
I assume it's a two way partnership, for example "activate a bond now to get 50% off a large dominos pizza" or whatever.
---
Sounds like someone hasn't heard that easyscape is already here, or are you just in denial? You can't tell me that this is 2007scape.
---
nah
---
Should have said, ‚Äúwhy? Something wrong with being gay? We accept all cunts in Australia!‚Äù
---
Well because Im the one who spent the hours getting the mining gloves I figured it would instance to me and not the person who hasn't spent the time getting them cause Im the one who spent the time getting the minerals to earn the extra ore and not the person who didn't even get lucky enough to mine the first ore llet alone the subsequent ores that are only available because j spent hours in the members mining guild for the gloves. 
---
ALSO b) cause during the 3+ mill mining xp I've gotten before now I've witnessed the ore deplete but watch another person continue to mine it, and vice versa I've gotten a second ore while.competeing and watched someone fuck off to another rock.
---
Do you know where I could find groups is there like a clan ?
---
No, skull tricking is a part of the game.  People need to deal with that and not be stupid
---
Not a bad idea but paying for skulls won't fly in the pk community
---
1. Create fake screenshot
---
2. Then take picture of your screen with fake screenshot on it
---
I agree not everything needs a boss, but at 90 slayer I think they're worthy of a boss version.
---
Cause this is the only reason the crafting cape exists for normal accounts
---
The funniest part of it all is they‚Äôre SERIOUSLY acting like the bulwark had its stats cut in half and Will be useless. 
---
They like to call PKers brainlets yet are severely overreacting about something that‚Äôs BARELY even a nerf. Guarantee they won‚Äôt even notice a difference, it‚Äôs literally like 2% loss in damage mitigation aka meaningless and will still be OP in singles.
---
Solid 15 seconds per trip adds up over thousands of kills.
---
Ping another server such as google constantly, and if it times out at the same time as OSRS then it's nothing to do with OSRS.  It's your internet overall.
---
They said the 12th few days ago
---
üôÑ
---
Lol yeah let me scale you. This comment is why pvp is basically dead content. I lost brain cells from reading it other be warned
---
Tanking is part of the game.  People need to deal with that and not be stupid.
---
Basically think of ironman mode only you can trade and interact with a handful of others in your group.
---
A hard clue requiring a rune heraldic shield that can only be obtained from a hard clue casket. I suppose you could drop trick but that seems to be against the intention of the clue system.
---
Never mind read it wrong
---
Gimme gimme chicken tendies,
---
Be they crispy or from Wendys.
---
Spend my hard-earned good-boy points,
---
on Kid's Meal ball pit burger joints.
---
Mummy lifts me to the car,
---
To find me tendies near and far.
---
Enjoy my tasty tendie treats,
---
in comfy big boy booster seats.
---
McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's,
---
But of my tendies none remains.
---
She tries to make me take a nappy,
---
But sleeping doesn't make me happy.
---
Tendies are the only food,
---
That puts me in the napping mood.
---
I'll scream and shout and make a fuss,
---
I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss!
---
Tendies are my heart's desire,
---
Fueled by raging, hungry fire.
---
Mummy sobs and wails and cries,
---
But tears aren't tendies, nugs or fries.
---
My good-boy points were fairly earned,
---
To buy the tendies that I've yearned.
---
But there's no tendies on my plate!
---
Did mummy think that I'd just ate?
---
**"TENDIES TENDIES GET THEM NOW,**
---
**YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW!"**
---
I screech while hurling into her eyes,
---
My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise.
---
For she who is un-pooped on is she who remembers:
---
Never forget my chicken tendies.
---
Tanking was a thing long before the bulwark, you act as if it's needed.  It's not at all and your point doesn't even make sense
---
Make sure you get a good chair as well so you wont ruin your back playing runescape all day
---
It's just way too smooth lmao. I didn't see any missclicks it's just hard for me to fathom. I use an iPhone se with big hands haha.
---
Why not tell to seers village bank?
---
Can you ban xgrace for spamming his twitch stream outside of 330 for the past 2 days?
---
The game was built on having risk, new players want everything to be 200% safe with Jagex holding their hand all the way and if something happens to them, it's never their fault
---
Don‚Äôt have diary done :(
---
RIP to that one guy that lost HC status in LMS do to a bug.
---
Basically think load times. normally a zulrah trip requires 2 teleports into your house thats normally another 3-4 seconds each way. Running over to the edge bank assuming you have a fairy ring in ur house and no crafting cape. with an average zulrah kill being 1:30-1:45. You're adding an extra 1-2 kills/hour by removing the house load times easy. And thats just assuming for the average player
---
1. Interest... fuck no we've been trying to stop inflation not increase inflation
---
2. this is a stupid idea. as things like revs, dark crabs, black chins, ents will become crowded af and revs will need SERIOUS rebalancing. It also effectively will kill the actual wilderness. Im sorry you like many other PvMers myself included are spoiled by the current death mechanics, which should have been reverted years ago to something else that still punishes the player for dying
---
Hey man, thanks for openly admitting to being a total scumbag
---
You probably have a email login, not username.
---
15 years and I bet this poor guy is still making $55k a year
---
Stop pushing your pro-sunlight agenda, bigot.
---
&gt; You can get a firecape at combat level 18.
---
No he can‚Äôt
---
What you mean suiciding with rune pouch and ardy tele runes to avoid eating? Please explain this
---
Paging r/tendies
---
Which prayer do you use for carpet bombs?
---
You would rather put your dick in a prayer potion because you‚Äôre 26?
---
On a non-sarcastic note I think you meant ‚Äúformer‚Äù in this case.
---
Are you stupid, dumb or just illiterate?
---
They are using the void gloves too though.
---
I have a rune pouch with law and water runes so when I die I spawn with them. Tele to ardougne. Pick up whatever I dropped, usually just coinstack, then keep theiving.
---
perm banning them.
---
It's easier than you'll think, especially with Lunar spells, teleports and max agility.
---
I can't grow fast enough I'm sitting on 15.
---
Because the premise of pvp is to dominate another player, and the majority of pvpers like to attack players that don‚Äôt want to engage them, therefore it‚Äôs easy to make a generalisation about the personalities of pvpers: they‚Äôre bullies, cowards, sadists and highly insecure.
---
Akthanakos final boss please
---
Caught that kickflip so well! Lookin like Shane O'Neil over here
---
That‚Äôs not very subtle
---
I donated yesterday.
---
Obviously that‚Äôs the way all the pros do it
---
I don't think that's what they mean. "Can we make **Torag Hammers** new special effect..." 
---
This implies it's not the set effect. Just something for the hammers.
---
And death runes are just slightly slower than that... Running the Abyss was fun for me.
---
I literally read this in my head with the emperor palpatine voice in my head
---
Gives 120k xp in lamps I believe once you finish all the displays
---
I remember those days. No resizeable mode either. I liked not having a GE but idk how i survived playing before resize lol
---
Lol thanks for helping me push back on the great Captain Assumo. Unfortunately we were not victorious, as his powers of pessimistic assumption have caused us all to bang our heads against the wall in disdain, but next time we will provide an empirical piece of peer reviewed evidence, with three sources listed and Keanu Reeve‚Äôs own signature, and then we will only fall slightly short of the great Captain Assumo‚Äôs awe-inspiring standards!
---
Uh where were you last week?
---
Ok I was wondering because the wiki says you only need 55, but 78 herblore
---
Of course, otherwise you couldn't recover your own account if a hacker changed its password. Jagex always tries to return accounts to the creator so older passwords are more important when recovering an account.
---
Don‚Äôt do it, earn your account
---
Whatcha merching over there üëÄ
---
Ya, you run around and see clue hunters and decide to kill them for a gp loss overall as we talked about earlier, congratulations. Again at least when I walk by KBD lake I don‚Äôt go ‚ÄúOH well this wasn‚Äôt what I came for but it I don‚Äôt kill him I‚Äôm losing Gp!‚Äù Fuck off lmao, there is nothing profitable in killing clue scrollers you literally lose gold as detailed before. People do it for fun and don‚Äôt wanna admit it to themselves because normal people don‚Äôt enjoy hitting a target that does nothing.
---
And there it is ‚Äúthey are playing the game for fun‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre missing brain cells but I haven‚Äôt ignored this point. I‚Äôve said several times that‚Äôs the real reason they must do it. But I really can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs fun about it. Even a pvmer wouldn‚Äôt enjoy hitting a boss that just stood there doing nothing if it‚Äôs drop table was also shit.
---
You‚Äôre right about the bolts, sorry I did forget to include the Ava‚Äôs. But congratulations, your still wasting time doing something that makes you basically no gold whatsoever. It‚Äôs again the equivalent of me running past KBD layer and going ‚Äúo BoY, bEttEr kiLl kBD sinCe itS frEE gP juSt siTTinG thEre‚Äù. If you‚Äôre doing anything as low profit as 300k gp/hr for the sake of profit you must be new to the game. Which is why they don‚Äôt do it for profit. It‚Äôs for fun. Which again is also incomprehensible. 
---
KBD anecdote does work. I run thru the wild to get to lava dragons to farm gold, pass KBDs layer. By your logic I should definitely go kill him because my opportunity cost is 0 gp/hr. Give me a break. Do you spin flax too when you pass by it on your way to do something else? Wouldn‚Äôt wanna lose that gp/hr.
---
Your logic of killing them because you lose the chance at his ‚Äúbig looty‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make sense either because the same is true of KBD. What if he drops a vissy!!!! Oh boy!!!! Might as well kill him since he‚Äôs on the way. And what does not having a good chance to find someone else if you let them go have to do with anything. I don‚Äôt pass by kbd without killing him because I have a good chance to find him again later. I just don‚Äôt kill him at all. In general. Because he‚Äôs not fun and his loot is shit after getting the pet.
---
no hate or anything but why would you want to buy a completely maxed account, i get you had one in the past that got hacked but what would you do? just raids and vork?
---
No resizable was honestly terrible on a 1440p screen.
---
A few more (or even one more) character would be cool.
---
I've always wanted to try Ironman out, but don't want to *that* bad to pay another $11.
---
All trees would collapse after 1 or 2 logs obtained.

Ironman trying to raise construction? Not on my watch.

Want to AFK redwoods and watch TV? Too bad.
---
Trying to tick manipulate for ranks/pets? Try again, buddy.

This meme has been posted many times

whats this fuckin dudes name again? he is absolutely hilarious, unicorns for everyone!

Where are the brainlets?
---
C H E S T B R A H
---
Sorry i didn't know and just made it. Apologies
---
A maxed account 100% will be recovered eventually unless you know the seller irl.
---
You‚Äôre correct on my incorrect grammar. However that does nothing to sway my opinion one way or another on the topic at hand.
---
I hope one day you can come back and debate me with actual facts about the updates at hand. Only then can we get past the prayer pot pissing contest this conversation has digressed into.
---
It literally was nerfed before release lol, the damage reduction effect was disabled in pvp because people could run from chins to the ditch and back over and over on the same invent.
---
  
---
Reddit threw a fit about that as well, but they didn't rage as bad or for as long as they are with this dinhs nerf, probably because they didn't realize in time that it could make the wildy safe like the rest of the game.
---
Very true
---

Didn't a mining company buy Runescape a couple of years ago? It could be that the term "gold" was used for different purposes.

Reminds me of my lily kitty. I think he was captured in a neighbor's animal trap, but he wouldn't own up to catching and killing the poor thing.

Does any other barrows weapon have a special effect without the whole set equipped? Please calm down.
---
lmao
---
nope, it's still the old item
---
hp is pretty common tbh, the rarest ones are probably construction and slayer (con because noone goes for it, slayer because it's hard)
---
All the time lol. So much inaccurate nonsense you know they just thought of it on the spot. Need to make memes with the drawings like this one, but instead pkers drooling over spades its bank standers drooling over upvotes

it's not

That still blows my fucking mind

55 is a good med-low goal youll have a altar (prayer) and a mounted glory for some usefull teles.

Shut the fuck up

I don‚Äôt want the subreddit to be deleted, I just didn‚Äôt like the reasoning behind the suggestion since the wilderness is one of the few if not only places where risk actually matters. It just feels like this subreddit just wants everything to be made easier and safer and that‚Äôs the problem I have with it. 
---
Probably shouldn‚Äôt voice my opinions that much since I generally tend to be passionate about this stuff and it can blind me at times to the broader issue. Doesn‚Äôt mean I want this subreddit gone at all
---
wow i fucking hate tithe farm rn, that would be so easy
---
And then what about corner trapping npcs? Or slayer assigning gross abyssal creatures of the depths, and then the next thing "Dwarves"- many of which you did quests for- they have a fucking city even. The fact that you can carry nigh infinite cannonballs but 28 lockpicks is all you can fit. The fact that we chomp on entire sharks to heal. We regain our trust in our gods by drinking prayer potions, and are totally immune to damage by praying the right things.
---
I read this as [NUT MASTER] Zezima.
---
I mean they're like 80k an hour or so. It's not bad if you're intent on just upping your farming level
---
Can relate
---
The issue with all this is that you'll just end up with bots farming the stuff. Emblem farms are still a huge thing and BH has been around for some time.
---
Hit em with da oof bit em wid da oof
---
I think you can get 76k at 75 (or whatever giant pouch is) if you're tick perfect, but your point still stands that theres no way you can get over 100k by yourself
---
Which ones higher?
---
Well how about this: Pets are naturally untradable so no real issue there, remove the BH aspect of the special assignment, make the potions untradable, and make it so you only earn a bone in 1/10 players or something while also keeping it untradable
---
Good news, 77-89 is like 50m worth of bloods with kebos elite, so you made more than double what you thought you made
---
Can you eli5? I know he just always breaks out in the video for CHESTBRAH. But is RuneScape CHESTBRAH the brother of this zyzz dude? And why is CHESTBRAH a zyzz meme as well?

lol

If the gaming industry could stop being disney villians for one god damn week it‚Äôd be nice

Those aren‚Äôt combat skills but yah they are rare
---
Regardless of controversy it's the easiest, no nonsense solution to the problem that actually involved people in PvP. I've yet to see another solution that isn't a stupid workaround for exactly what I'm suggesting.
---
Jad phase is simple, first few times just focus the prayers and dont worry about attacking. Heres how the prayer works: switch prayer every time he bobs his head to attack, including the first bob as soon as he spawns. So example assuming its a range first jad phase: have pray range on prior to him spawning, as soon as he spawns and bobs switch mage, then continue to switch every time he bobs, once you have the switch down and want to damage him during this phase, dont attack him untill AFTER the first switch, if you try to click when he spawns youll miss the first switch since its almost instant. After the first switch click him and continue to switch like normal.
---
Some Facebook weaboos plan to liberate the aliens, meme just began and its already been beat into the ground.
---
There was OSHD, which Jagex killed.  
---
Jagex is too caught in the business culture to realize what will make this game go MASSIVE is letting projects like that flourish.
---
I‚Äôm p2p
---
Holy hell dude, why is your screen shot so tiny.
---
tell him to log in and trade back?
---
We can sink so much gold if we all storm the gates.
---
Lmao this logic. We're all slowly dying, so I guess I should just lay down in a bed for the rest of my life awaiting it.
---
80k / hr is actually pretty bad for farming, considering a daily tree run takes way less than an hour and gives more xp.
---
I hit 99 doing only papayas and calquats and I'd be earning 200k + xp/hr.
---
It's the easiest set to get, but hardly worth it unless you are doing post 99 wc
---
Giving a dude bobs and vagene: 3000 gp
---
Well it got me from 1kc to 800kc.
---
Dude this got an audible LOL outta me.
---
First meme to do that in a while.
---
Bravo!
---
I've played runescape enough to know that no matter how rich you feel, there is always someone out there that will make you feel poor
---
Jagex has fucked up in the past, but that doesn't make them an evil corporation. They have to make money, but the playerbase is so obviously against MTX I'm sure they know doing so would be suicide. They polled partnerships, the playerbase said no, and they backed off. We should give them credit for that.
---
What I find insanely coincidental, we have the exact same keyboard and the exact missing key, mine broke
---
And he paid a player

normal ones

Not bad, I be shaking my leg like hell so this would actually be useful.

Idk I'm gonna remove and repost tmrw. cba.

Before reading the title, I thought the sand was some floor texture that hadn‚Äôt finished loading.
---
Bro, why cant I, a mid level PKer kill this person who has 99 def and 99 mage and is using a 6 mil gp endgame item? I mean, sure I'm wearing like 200k worth of gear and I'm not risking anything by attacking him, but still. Also nerf gmaul because I hate when other people try to PK me. That means I have to fight someone who will actually fight back, that's no fun because I'm bad at the game and always die.
---
Can someone explain this reference to me?
---
I'd do plague city next so you can get to ardougne. It may also be worth it to focus a bit more on the quests in the "Recommended Quests" section. These give some unlocks like fairy rings &amp; spirit trees plus equipment that will make the game easier. And don't forget to do diaries! Varrock and Ardy diaries are very nice for teleport straight to the GE and unlimited teleports close to an altar &amp; fairy ring.
---
Grats
---
You didn't reply to him, and this is a place for players to ask other players questions. If you want to appeal a ban, appeal it from your message board on the RuneScape website.
---
Me too haha
---
Got our first drop in 300 kc with my trio last night, and you best believe it was the fucking boots. We of course gave them straight to our tank.
---
Looks like half of Smosh from back in the day
---
Looks like you've seen a lot of the NMZ
---
love how it ends with him just dropping the rune xbow
---
Guy is dry on white bead, should help him out.
---
I do not mind, if 99 construction saves a bit of time it is most probably the most expensive time save in RS in unless you use your house for a dozen years. Which sounds fair enough to me.
---
Imagine thinking tithe is ez scape when it's less than 10% of farming EHP. Farming ehp is 1.9m, dumbass. If anything, regular farming is ez scape, not tithe. Get a brain.
---
I got back to backs at wyrms last week. I got the harpoon and then throwing knives the next kill. So rare
---
It's been this way for 15+ years and it the only people who might actually want to smith their own pickaxes are snowflake ironmen. I really don't see any need for this to be changed, especially if it's going to be locked behind a quest.
---
I don't have trouble with jad phase but for some reason the first hit of jad phase always hits me, even if i'm praying the right prayer. is this normal?

You‚Äôd love it.

No rules in the wilderness, so there should be no problem when people wear full tank setup to the point you cant kill them? Or are you telling me they HAVE to fight you because its wildy? In which case, theres one rule.
---
Just pay like 2k noob
---
Yeah the minigame isn‚Äôt that bad even with clicking your watering cans. I‚Äôd prefer if they‚Äôd make a ‚Äúwater‚Äù option for all allotment and flower patches in the game just for consistency when this poll inevitably passes.
---
Is it looked down upon to max an account this way? I‚Äôve been getting my 99s in a similar fashion, but someone called me out for it being super inefficient
---
Oh, definitely! Won‚Äôt argue that the wilderness, as a whole, is far more dead than in past times. But I usually see a couple pkers every few trips in to the wilderness. Maybe *I* am the lucky one, because they‚Äôve never bothered attacking me
---
those silly goblin boys thought they were smart but got slapped with the quickness to scumbridge hahahahahahahahaha oh wow
---
Youd be surprised how many people cant kill zulrah or vorkath hell they struggle on jad and takes them 10 attempts lol
---
Fair enough!
---
You‚Äôre either late, praying the wrong prayer, or a snakeling is hitting you
---
oh my god
---
You could be on to something about the meme thing. But, I do tend to see a few pkers every few trips in to the wilderness. The whole ctrl &gt; shift &gt; arrow key has made it so easy for me to never get attacked though
---
Considering rot hasnt misses a day since their release in 2017, ima go witn no, but who knows.
---
You‚Äôre below the drop rate for every rare drop, including the necklace lmao
---
That‚Äôs fair 100% agree with that, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd struggle with the video as such more the trying to bring in a viewership to enjoy my content, there‚Äôs plenty of ideas I have just the time and effort I need to put into these. They could turn out awesome though

---
What about xp from splashing in legitimate magic combat? This could make mage training a lot slower and more expensive, with f2p suffering the most. 
---
Perhaps xp should be given for up to 10 consecutive splashes, and then zero.

It affects PvPers because they dont get to munch PvMers with rag

Agreed the level cap should be higher, but under 99 as stated above for obvious reasons.

The closest thing I know of is Minecraft, where I just dig  mineshafts and gather diamonds and ores or build simple megastructures. But that lacks the crafting and skilldepth of runescape . Maybe there are some mods to fix it but I haven't looked into it.
---
maybe the wrong authenticator code? i had the same problem yesterday
---
It honestly wouldn‚Äôt change much apart from not being able to use pots for slayer/cb training and manually collecting many supplies.

It was meant as more of a dig than anything else.

Slayer is worse than rc.  Fight me.

Fuck off with your ezscape this is what makes ironman fun.

If price increases, people who buy bonds will decrease, leading to increase for gold price in bonds.

I literally risk more trying to get a lucky drop at rev caves than I get for anti-pking one of you guys.

Buddy I‚Äôm not reading that trash pker novel. You complain about gear being to strong. Tier 75 shield  vs tier 20 and 40 gear. Really bro? GTFO of here with that trash all pkers want is to wear wealth fare and get paid like your Framed or Torvesta. As a pker if you want to get more consistent hits rather than splashing I‚Äôd wear better gear or just you know stop complain that my salad robes and water staff didn‚Äôt catch every freeze.
---
Im gonna lowkey vote no for this

Whoa, those RSHD textures. Missed them.

He clearly had the advantage both on gear and RNG, I splashed quite a few times on very crucial moments in the fight. He also kept DD'ing, which is something I usually don't do. Outsmarted him though.
---
D claw nerf wouls qq all the TOBers. Claws is bis for tob.
---
all this is a evil circle jerk, when i see non pkers get mad in on reddit because of pkers i want to go and kill them more for the extreme reactions. Then after all this they post more shit on here and i get even more motivation to do more and so on.
---
There are game sounds that play when you're frozen and attacking.
---
***R u n e l i t e***

hope they nerf it
---
Good tip I try to teach people I introduce to nhing- focus on prayers before anything. This is more important for pure nhing but it's a good first step and habit to get into.
---
You should swap prot prayers before you do anything else when you are on the defensive (like you most likely will be.) Proper prayer switches will keep the opponent from getting good momentum if you can continue laying down any damage. It is the equivalent of having your hands up in boxing. It's the first thing you should always do in a fight, keep your defenses up and ready to switch. See if you can predict what they are going to do next like a game of poker. Sometimes theyll fakie, or even double, triple fake. This separates good from bad brids. You'll be able to feel what attack style will likely come next when you get good. just play defensively. If you're gonna get your asswhooped, try to at least last long than the time before. Start watching their prayers and bolt ragging will give you most dps if you dont know how to mage properly, but freezes control fights. That's next lesson, like it was said, focus on one mechanic at a time. Getting in the habit of doing pray swaps first will really help you in the long term. 
---
After that start really paying attention to tick manipulation. This is probably the most important part of bridding and one of the hardest lessons. There is so much to say about proper tick mechanics but start simple with prayers and practice switches to get the fundamentals. Another big tip for those who suck at mage swaps- set screen markers on barrage so you know where to look befor you f key to mage tab. You can do the same thing to prays or weps if you're having trouble remembering where things are, but it will come with lots of practice.
---
And I don‚Äôt have to pk you brainlet! That‚Äôs my whole Fing point! I don‚Äôt have to go to the wild and there should be no updates to force anyone out there with content. The wilds content is player killing and since most of the games players would rather not player kill. Why waste so much time and effort into such a small group. Your getting to be really annoying with how your all about this specific situation of SINGLES? If he ranked your brainlet self in singles you don‚Äôt deserve the kill.

What Settled did is not even close in comparison
---
Lynx is more tedious I think.
---
Settled has more of an enjoyable goal, which is to complete the TOB and then he will likely stop.
---
Lynx however had to grind 200m in skills like RC/mining/agility etc etc..
---
Not taking anything away from Settled, but if I had to pick between the two then I‚Äôd be a swamp man.
---
200m easily.  Settled has crazy dedication, but 200m all tops just about everything.

I think I might be underestimating 200m in all skills. It's just that one run of temple trekking makes me gag already.

Maybe just let them throw away their runes and waste time? It's their fault for not reading the news that are obvious when you log in.
---
&gt;As a solo pker, even in max gear and at fully boosted offensive stats with rigour and augury and hitting a player with a bulwark off prayer; it is unreliable to kill someone using very cheap gear like black d'hide, some tank legs and the Dinh's Bulwark. So much so, that it's a common theme now to have a pker just off someone using a bulwark at chins or in other places where there are "safe zones" (hobgoblins) or near level 30 wilderness. That or the pker will try 1 stack with a barrage ags maul and promptly leave when it fails.
---
Yeah...this is the single most critical thing that apparently not a single PvMer on this sub seems to understand, or just willfully ignores it in favor of the favorite meme of the month. You know if its a meme on here about PvP, then its only very mildly based in reality or completely untrue...actually a pretty good compass of being able to tell if something about pvp is true or not. Is it a meme on OSRS sub? Probably only a small part of it is true then.
---
Ive tried to explain this to so many people, genuinely dont understand how people dont realize this. I dont know any singles pkers who even consistently PK in salad robes or a water stick let alone complaining about not hitting on a dinhs. The only thing I know my friends and virtually the entire singles community complain about how much gear and how much effort it takes to kill people who know what theyre doing in a dinhs. So basically the complete opposite of the meme, yet were constantly told that were wrong and that the people who spend the absolute least time pking, and in the wilderness actually are right. Its legit mind blowing how people think thats logical and true. I mean literally all you have to do is go to singles spots like 44s/chins etc. and see what PKers are risking and wearing...youll rarely see people in salad robes and half the time you see someone in them its probably because theyre coming up/down to Revs.
---
Then again, a vast majority of time this subs reaction and logic to anything PvP is completely illogical.
---
tried and its a waste of opportunity cost
---
Great thought put into this post but you really should keep this to yourself. Massive profit potential on some of this. It's a shame there's no way to short the GE for things like the mohogany.

You can.

I can't imagine 200m takes 7k games, didn't you do solos? Would definitely have gotten you 99 construction.

I recently made a new account and couldn't log in with the email address I'd made for it. So I try a recovery request and Jagex sends me an email, but it's for an account that is not my brand new, unplayed account but for someone's 10hp ironman with about ~600hrs. Ended up having to change the email asaociated with my account but it's pretty weird/stupid that I could've stolen that other guy's account if I had a mind to.

Haha, just editted it! You think so? You have to constantly pay attention, since you get hit every few ticks. When you solo you only get hit once per hour when it's set up!

I just try it on my pc and found out you don't need to press shift for print screen

For years I've been doing it with the shift button

WTF IS THIS

And person in combat with you should always appear ontop of the stack. One of the things about 10 people with the same name is you cant hit the person on you back without auto retaliating

This weird elitist attitude is so dumb. Slayer isn't the only way to train combat stats. Some people don't feel the need or have the time to do thousands of tasks to get combat up when they can just afk it and not have to worry about clicking every second. Don't really understand the issue.

So many people think that splashing freezes has to do with Dinhs and saying pkers should bring ahrims to catch freezes on a bulwarker when it only gives +15 mage def. But nerfing dhides? I think that's something that neither pvmers nor pkers would want.

Depends what you want to do. The meta for f2p pking is your standard ranged based 1 defense pure. Basically you'll get stats somewhere around 1 Def, 40 Attack (for rune 2h), 40+ Strength, at least 40 Ranged but you can go as high as you wish. Magic doesn't matter all that much, but probably get 25 for Varrock teleport.  
---
Then you basically just use a maple shortbow, adamant arrows, and bring a rune 2h. Then just range them down to somewhere around 1/3 HP, and quickly switch to your 2h and smack them for the KO. Look up on Youtube "F2P range 2h pure" or something - it's a tried-and-true F2P pure build and easy to make.
---
Thank you!

Thank you! :)

Will do absolutely!

afking in a cave makes me better than afking in a dream
---
You said it yourself. It has to be inconsistent to kill a player in bulwark + tank legs + suffering + serp + dhide body as a solo pker BECAUSE max teams exist. If you could kill these people solo more often than not, teams would kill them 100% of the time. Fix teams in singles and I'll fully agree to bulwark nerfs, but not until then.
---
thx man, ill check it out.

Why the hell did they do this?

It doesnt compare to what Lynx Titan did, thats for sure. But lets just make this stupid comparison.
---
Settled playing 10 hours a day for a shorter period of time vs Lynx playing 16-18 hours a day for a long period of time. And every hour increases exponentially in difficulty, like 14 hours is much more difficult than 12 hours a day, and this just adds up when you look at it over multiple years. On top of this Lynx Titan did much more difficult methods. Compare clicking a bridge and simply walking very non-intensive methods to some high intense methods as granite. Further on top of this Lynx played multiple accs at once compared to just playing a singular account.
---
Please dont make this stupid comparison again.

If you don‚Äôt want to die, stay out of the wilderness. If I see a naked person running in the windy, probably doing a clue...I‚Äôm going to kill them, because:

1. It‚Äôll take 2 seconds

2. They MIGHT be risking something valuable
---
Looks like zac from league with an orange chroma lol

Right, like people actually don‚Äôt want the wild to be a pvp zone I don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôm gonna start petitioning for them to remove quests and requirements for all gear, so I‚Äôm not forced to pvm or quest

You can't tick eat in PvP

im ok with it. place all essential items on the wilderness so you can pk yourself to death and shut the fuck up.

Ahhh, I remember this now. For some crazy reason, that second shortcut was added to the Game Bar, which is often disabled on corporate / business / school networks. The first one is useful, although having to crop later on is kind of annoying.
---
really? i'll try and find a clip or something about it because that's super interesting if true. they don't die straight away when on fire in OSRS which means that would have been patched in later between 2007 and june 2010 which is weird

I'm an electrician rs player as well! Always hoped to meet one in the wild lmao

I would definitely love a Corgi. And Corgis are distinctly British. Perhaps a quest with one of the Kings/Queens of Runescape?

I agree it does, especially once you in the top 5-10
---
This and either ban ahkers or 3rd party clients.
---
Don‚Äôt understand the post, why can‚Äôt you just buy the splitbark? This looks like an ingame store so Ironmen could use this.
---
Ah yes you‚Äôre right.  End result is the same though.  Unstable servers due to attacking or just lacking the quality.  We still have the death mechanic that we have now.  So this idea doesn‚Äôt really work.

Look up chymistry‚Äôs gearing guide for raids 1 it‚Äôs pretty good.

Raids 2 is a different story, depending on your team and your KC you can bring more or less switches.
---
What I think is necessary
---
All 3 voids
---
Dwh or BGS
---
Torture/anguish
---
Bp/trident(or sang)
---
Occult(optional while learning)
---
Avas MA2 cape and fire cape (or inferno)
---
Prims
---
Defender (best you have) 
---
Whip or Scythe
---
Chally and a lot of Salve (e)
---
Berserker(I)
---
Dragon claws
---
Now once you get a little better, you can bring max melee switch
---
BCP tassy ferocious and Serp
---
Once you get really good you can bring ancestral as your mage switch then max range as well, but once you get that good you will know what to bring.
---
I think I included everything, idk though.
---
That... doesn't even make sense.... Dogs are a part of OSRS currently just not to this extent.

Boooooooo

hmmmm " All alight mummies become "Mummy ashes" when defeated". i'll go kill one and report back

‚ÄúThe high quality reflections‚Äù make it not feel very OSRS. The design itself is great, OP is extremely talented. He also asked for feedback: the high quality reflection in this art aren‚Äôt something I have found in OSRS anywhere and contradict the shitty OSRS graphics

I don‚Äôt believe it is. Pretty sure it can trigger their bot detection and if they decide to ban, then gg.

But not like they can ban specific clients on sight of login. If they could, we wouldn‚Äôt have a bot problem.

As good of a minigame as CW is, its clear that jagex no longer supports it. For years people have suggested offering incentives for not AFKing and they haven't changed a damn thing.

Anybody who is upset at AFKers should be more upset at Jagex for making the minigame so difficult to grind out rewards, insanely long wait times, and for not creating incentives for active play.

cool now what?

Look up the reqs for recipe for disaster and dragon slayer two. By the time you're done them you'll be able to boss a bit.

---
Lol no
---
To answer some of your questions. There are indeed chill solo bosses that are easy to kick back, watch a stream or whatever and make some decent money. There are also more intensive bosses which will net more profit. There are 2 full raids which is group content. One of the raids is soloable but it‚Äôs pretty difficult to learn solo. Duo raids 1 (cox) is pretty viable tho.  There aren‚Äôt a whole lot of efficient duoing bosses aside from raids but that doesn‚Äôt make it not viable just because it‚Äôs not exactly efficient. 
---
There aren‚Äôt really any specific big skills that are just blatantly recommended, it more or less depends on what you plan to do, but 77 prayer unlocks all of your prayers which is pretty crucial and 83 construction for all the qol your poh can bring is recommended. You can easily afk your account to max combat in the nightmare zone mini game. But you‚Äôll need to do a few quests first and I‚Äôd recommend at least 60 all melee stats and defense for obsidian armor and weapons. 
---
Questing to complete recipe for disaster is a strong recommend as the barrows gloves are very good and near bis for everything. (Melee and mage have a stronger glove slot but aren‚Äôt always worth using)
---
A lot of endgame pvm in osrs utilizes all 3 combat styles. There is a decent amount of content that will require range and mage. Or mage melee and range, etc. however range is the strongest in osrs by quite a bit and most of the solo bosses are heavily dominated by range. The toxic blowpipe (cheap and requires 75 range) shits on melee pretty much anywhere where the monster has pretty low defense. And the twisted bow shits on any boss that has a high magic level(does damage based on opponents magic level) 
---
 
---
In osrs mage is the least viable combat method, but it still is required for a lot of content.
---
Seen you at cwars, gz nerd

You need to play a minimum of 15 minutes of each game to earn tickets.

This is a very thoughtful comment.  Any particular articles you'd recommend regarding "surprise mechanics?"

I just wish the wild was busier. But I agree, no one is forcing you to do anything, you can make an account and sit in ge for 100 hours for all I care, I just don‚Äôt get how certain people get hate for playing the game they want to whether it‚Äôs pvm or pvp

---
How arrogant and self-absorbed do you need to be to make a 16 minute video for ad revenue when you could literally make the same point and be less obnoxious with a single screenshot?
---
Looks like you fell for the circle jerk. The issue was never about "salad robes splashing." The issue is that the bulwark gives 150 range and melee defense, and combined with black d'hide legs and body it makes you nearly invincible to the full combat triangle for 0 risk.
---
Nerfing Bulwark was the best solution to that, because it is useless outside of this 1 niche use. Clueless people who didn't do any critical thinking reacted with "if it's useless why make it more useless." But, this is actually an upside because it means they are addressing the problem they want to address directly without affecting anything else.
---
Lastly, the nerf itself is very small and all it does is raise the percentage of the time someone using it dies by a small amount so that they can't just count on always being safe with it. Overall it is a very slight and elegant nerf that clueless people chose to whine and circlejerk about for no real reason.

lollol

Wow this is a throwback. I used to train on these when HCIM first came out on rs3. They used to be afk and drop alchables . [https://i.imgur.com/FaSJu9b.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FaSJu9b.jpg) (In the chat you can see that I lost a hcim life from not paying attention here.)
---
There‚Äôs probably nothing there anyway it‚Äôs too well known. Plus, how would anyone get in if they got passed any guards lol. I would assume they have some type of scanner for the probably few foot thick steel door.
---
Ye let's also nerf the weapon that has a higher Max hit and twice as many specs as the AGS, the dragon dagger. It's time.
---
Idk 16,000 laps around morytania doing the temple trek sounds like a nightmare  agility course with the added twist of thrusting a giant dragon dildo up your ass for 200 hours

there is nmz, blowpipe, better bones, mm2 cave etc... I would say it is easier, not if you compare it to 2013 osrs, but 2019 osrs is easyscape definitely
---
Since yesterday, the demonic gorilla slayer spot started extremely lagging. I'm using RL and my PC is really strong. Can I do anything against this? The FPS-drops are spiky. So constant 50FPS and a drop to what feels like 0 (but actually is 30fps).
---
you could potentially get a really low level firecape by rushing range/prayer and then using the exp lamps to revert 43 prayer back to 1. Having lvl 1 prayer with accumulator/ancient magic etc is also a possibility.
---
Yeah, at this point I've been pretty humbled. I was going to delete my post, but I feel like that would be escaping the shame I've incurred on myself.

Was really hoping the whole thing was gonna be an intense farm run and nothing else
---
The complaint isn‚Äôt necessarily splashing on a bulwark. It‚Äôs that you can camp a bulwark and black d‚Äôhide and camp range pray and be nearly invulnerable to all forms of combat. People generally only pk with mage/ranged and a melee spec weapon. So when it comes to a bulwark, you can either keep bolting or spam barrage. Barrage will splash a lot not just because of a bulwark‚Äôs +18, but the massive defense of the black dhide and accessory gear they have as well. Bolts will practically never hit and do very little damage, and nobody will waste specs because it‚Äôs extremely likely to hit 0. It is a 0 risk, extremely cheap setup, and requires no skill or understanding of anything to pull off. That‚Äôs the problem.

You are very irrationally afraid of being hacked, it's very cute. You have 4 skills blocked with the WC xp window, and then try but fail to blur out two more I love it.

Sounds like a BS to me, Slayer is a fairly slow skill and can unlock some good money makers, do slayer get combat stat and slayer xp.
---
Noob here: why make it so you can't splash in a certain area? Cant players go to other locations to splash?

Yes I read the article but it just left so many in answered questions

Yes one purely defensive item should be extremely good at defense. It takes two hands it's not like they're killing you back and being invulnerable. If someone spends 6m to pvm in peice I think that's perfectly reasonable.
---
Wait this is really clever
---
i couldnt even imagine how unproductive id be if i worked from home, i know damn well id be afking all day long

yeah, that's if i could find a job. it's been about a year now of being unemployment.

Efficient elitist players are gonna get a stroke when they see this

Bring more than salad robes if you wanna pk someone with raids 1 gear. If 10 of you can't take down 1 person, you all should risk more. You aren't entitled to free kills just because you're team pking.

I‚Äôd rather play to max than max to play
---
Hey, big brained pker, these three items cost this much because they are all useful in pvming, with the Tbow and Scythe being only useful in pvming. The Bulwark cost this little because it is a defensive gear that has no use in pvming because of how unimportant the tanking role is in pvming over just dealing max dps, and the fact that it is a pvp useful item provided from a pvming source. Since there are far more pvmers than there are pkers, that means supply of the Bulwark is greater than the demand for it.
---
Nerfing it will only cause the price to decrease faster. A better solution to increase its price would be to either lower the drop rate of it in Raids, or move it over as a reward from BH or LMS.

All these special rules for PvP zones are soooooo fucking scuffed. 
---
At this point they should just isolate PvP to mini games. Wildy is iconic, but has aged horribly, evidenced by the fact that even PKers can‚Äôt take it how it is.
---
Meant for pvm but exclusively used for pvp.
---
maybe if you did some farming you would get them
---
Again, I see no depth. If you actually show something with depth like letting the shirt hang from your hand or whatever way you want, then I'll believe you.
---
If im spending 6+ mil to go do wild trainging on a PURELY DEFENSIVE RAID ITEM I would hope youd be almost invincible. It's a 2 handed shield, if someone is running that set up, just dont fight them. Its like me being level 50 and mad that i cant do bandos for the items but others can.
---
Nah
---
Half the people who post on this sub need to take notes
---
No way, I thought my 83 farming was from doing runecrafting.
---
holy shit dude, i got burnt out after 300 wt kills, then i just burnt logs the rest of the way to 99, i cant even imagine 1k games let alone 7k, you have some insane dedication.
---
Welcome to the internet

you definitely didn't farm for 3 months if you're only level 83.
---
yeah the sweater is great but those tattoos look clean as heck love it
---
The bot kingpins got him.

But its not though. Both serve different uses. The whip is an all rounded weapon. The tentacle dissolves after 10k hits so its uses vary
---
I just did my 3rd raids kc last night and didn‚Äôt die for the first time as well and got 8.8k points. You don‚Äôt get many points when you‚Äôre spamming brews most of the raid and your team has Tbows and really knows what their doing and you don‚Äôt have the herblore to prep anything. You‚Äôre really just along for the ride
---
lol he tried
---
To be fair you play osrs which is the biggest time sink
---
Yes. Depending on how efficient you are, you can get like 2-4 per hour, and you need about 15 for a full set of splitbark, so it takes quite a while.
---
It's worth. Nothing that a monsters magic defense is only 25% of their defensive roll, and their magic level is 75%.
---
I don‚Äôt know of much but I hardly ever see corrupted armour around and some unique G.E items came up but couldn‚Äôt buy if I remember.
---
You‚Äôre right, ranarr/snapdragon definitely would‚Äôve gotten me to 99 by then.
---
Calquat and papaya are very cheap gp/xp
---
What
---
I always wondered what max players do with their time...
---
Except that it is.
---
Tentacle whip is a direct upgrade from the whip. 
---
The only difference is the tentacle whip has an upkeep cost so you just use it in places that actually make you more money than the upkeep cost amounts to.
---
The point is that you're barely farming if you havent gotten one in 3 months, which makes it not a big deal that you haven't gotten them. When i was doing regular farming on my ironman i got hespori seeds on a daily basis.
---
How many people on this sub are whining because they were half a brew short of *tanking a full tb*?? Lmao these nerds are dying running south from the chaos altar, not tanking fulls at mage bank homie
---
Bold of you to assume I have real money
---
I‚Äôm going to clear pvmers in rev caves because thats free money, and I‚Äôm going to fight all pvp competition there as well. Guess what dude, pvmers far out umbers pkers even in the wild. We aren‚Äôt just going to leave you be and wait around dipshit.

Clans spear one guy while the others unload ancient mace specs - guy being attacked can‚Äôt pray pot or heal so they get a guaranteed smite.
---
LMS is a great addition. I agree that PvP fights should be skill-based and have somewhat equitable risk and reward available for both sides. 
---
I don‚Äôt, however, agree with taking away the modicum of defensive capability that a PvMer/skiller in the wilderness has. Those fights have always been in the favor of the PKer, and they don‚Äôt need to be even more so.

Thanks for being a good sport about.
---
It used to be 18k pre eoc and was more powerful and no one bitched
---
White apron, and a chef's hat.
---
cannon goblins, takes like 1-2h
---
One more question what type of staff should I use ?
---
Nice.
---
Haha no thats me :)
---
It‚Äôs just not a very good name.
---
R/rimjobsteve
---
So why are you attacking them then
---
You act like you didn‚Äôt have to load the polypore staff. Blowpipe and polypore are roughly the same.
---
Ornate armor
---
At first I thought the sweater was fucked up, but then tits.
---
They make for a rather funny angle all things given.
---
Seriously, what could he possibly be talking about? I can download a model dump of every single item in the game right now, and have been able to do so since even pre HD-RS, there is a huge difference between niche and unknown, if it was truly unknown he could likely make an extremely popular video on such, if it's just niche because people don't use it, it's not even nearly as big of a deal
---
The fastest xp in any skill shouldn't offer high profits, the same goes for slayer. There should always be a balanced between xp rates, profit and AFK.
---
You didnt get him, you just sound like a spastic.
---
Was corrupted dragon armour/weapons a rs3 thing tho that allowed f2p to use it but also degrade?
---
-77 downvotes in hour. Y‚Äôall like runecrafting now? üòÇ

Do you like black cock or white meat?

Bruh have you never heard of agility courses?
---
Bike rider btw
---
Yeah... to be fair a JMOD did say he offered him some solutions in private chats so I have no idea what they could have been.  But he also said Zezima rejected those solutions. So Zezima is being our white knight and will hopefully aid in a push for a real solution instead of a bandaid.
---
Ah thanks, it's been a hot minute since I've seen that
---
It‚Äôs expertise and manhours that makes the difference. Ferry‚Äôs are automated system whereas barbers are putting in handcraft and time. Makes sense.
---
how does one do this?
---
Dragon claws, dragon cross bow, all of godwars items, staff of light/dead. tent whip, rapier maul, all lv 75 boots are copies.  I think rs3 items are 90% of osrs items now?? what u talking about?
---
Sick as always
---
The difference in those is that void was legit broken.
---
Huh
---
No worries man. There are worse things you can say drunk, ha.
---
Why do you support the Dhin nerf, but don‚Äôt support the Gmaul nerfs?
---
Wait yeah even a chance to double hit i feel would make the set as a whole work or even be used a little more

Nice knowing you.

Kinda sad that you have to explain this. It'll probably fall on deaf ears tho

If you're doing Vorkath exclusively, DHCB all day every day, it makes such a massive difference.

I don't know if that's a fair trade haha took me a while to get it filled when I was a kid

It's spec is used for pvm scenarios...
---
Damn man. You'll get it bro.
---

LMAO integrity and character
---
its a fucking java game from 2004 dude get your shit together
---
There are less than 700k electricians in the US out of 327m people. That's less 0.2%. Also, people very rarely talk about their occupations in the subreddit, they talk about runescape. So, yes, it is weird. I'm yet to meet a single person in game or on reddit in my field.
---
Winslow is trimming armor isnt he?
---
Uh
---
I hope that jagex is considering being more harsher on autoswitchers
---
This is the content I expect from this sub
---
Alright, thanks.

I give rune scim for gf
---
Isn't that the point of that lesser? So mages can train at the wizard tower?

There's no rule that says rigging mingames isn't allowed

I‚Äôm on the master clue step where I have to emote on the Drakan castle wall. I started darkness of hallowvale but I haven‚Äôt done anything besides take the boat to meiyerditch.

Do I need to do more of the quest to get to this spot? If not how do I get to this spot?
---
omg, i don't blame you for feeling bad, damn.

You jenuinely left plenty of info to easily find out who the user is.
---
Yeah

It‚Äôs way faster than splashing so idk why people don‚Äôt use it more often

he is my fiance but he calls me his gf and vise versa. but why does it matter what i call him and why did you dig through my profile to find unneccessary information? 
---
lol okay, heard
---
Dude you just said you want to play with kids. Wtf man.
---
you are missing the point of bulwark entirely, you take it to get all around defence, to melee/range/magic, not just magic
---
Probably.. Hopefully.. They should poll it though.
---
cum
---
More than likely.
---
How can they buy at 3/mil and then only sell at .80/mil?  That doesn‚Äôt make sense, they‚Äôd be permanently losing money that way
---
Yes, you won't get banned if you use it for something like alching. Ignore the retards who say otherwise, they have probably never used one.
---
[Here you go](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Glowing_dagger).

T0y

It was sarcasm..
---
There are starving pkers that could eat the fed Venezuelans
---
I have a couple thousand kills in the wilderness, and the only Bulwark users I've ever killed are the ones who actually don't understand how to keep HP above 70 and use prayers.  Bulwark creates a failsafe low risk criteria in singles.  That's an issue.  It's not mental gymnastics.  It's thousands of hours spend in the wilderness doing PvM and PvP that shown me that Bulwark is too strong.
---
Yea with 5 herb runs, I get 25k-30k from a total of 12 patches per run
---
Whoa maybe he got botted
---
So the issue isn't that it's overpowered, the issue is that it's easier to use? Because that's a big difference. You can easily bring cheap item switches that do the same thing.
---
What's are the defenses for other attack styles?
---
&gt; borderline invincible
---
Lmao. Buy an AGS; it's way stronger than the bullwark. It can be your +1.
---
Yeah I agree. Its a ridiculous requirement. You basically need a quest cape in order to get it to. And now you need to get crazy lucky (twice). Because the first mimic you get, you only unlock future mimics and cant even fight it. 
---
Absolutely poor game design.
---
Wow a blast from the past effigy scape was fun
---
Ah yes. the only part we will remember from SotE. The light beam puzzle
---
yes, we know poindexter.
---
i mean, it's irrelevant to this post so, yeah, i'm unsure of why they questioned it and brought it up
---
Gratz! Did they get anything?
---
Is that a poison hitsplat?
---
And 50 feels like half way but we all know its 92
---
They get a lot of shit for the shit the high ups pull :(
---
I found Blast mining to be quite nice. Good balance between making money and decent exp/h
---
You're unironically right though, it's the only one that helps you get to DKS.

Holy fuck this is a disgusting droprate

Aww cute. Enjoy the cakes
---
Now can I get a pic of that sleeve?
---
Blow glass to uncharged orbs is very cheap.
---
&gt;never know what people are risking. The vast majority of the time it isn't nothing
---
&gt;I can bring arma and a suffering with a bulwark and be virtually invincible to all 3 combat styles while risking nothing
---
Your argument seems to be contradicting itself. Is it op because they don't risk anything or are you attacking them because they might be risking something? You can't have it both ways.
---
It was the skillcape update that brought about this change in our culture.
---
This endless quest for 99s and 200Ms didn't exist back when I started playing in 2003. It was the realm of maniacs, the stuff of legends. Andrew Gower didn't design a game where it was meant to be feasible to get a 99, he just set the limit impossibly high because he needed some kind of limit. Ultimately, Andrew Gower designed a point and click adventure game.
---
Everything changed in 2006 when skillcapes were released. Seemingly overnight, your average joe was obsessed with 99s and efficiency, and the joy and wonder of exploring a truly wide open world was gone.
---
Skillcapes changed RuneScape and its culture for worse.
---
What does splashing have to do with pvp encounters?
---
Like you're just shoehorning Ina completely unrelated topic after stalking the guys profile and coming up with nothing.
---
Stfu
---
What's funny is I only see people saying pkers are co.pmaining, but no actual complaining pkers.
---
The problem with black dragonhide stuff is that it is T70 armor with only a T30 cost, due to it's massive availability. The next step up from black dragonhide is Karil's, with a 2mil price jump and a steep risk if you die with it on. Black d'hide is not overpowered stat-wise, but it is over-powered for it's cost effectiveness. You risk absolutely nothing for stellar defenses. You may notice a common theme in both the PvP and PvM community agreeing that certain items are *too strong* for their *low cost*.
---
That's also why people are complaining about the Dihn nerf. It's *strong* but has a **high** cost. It *should* be good for what it does. It *costs* a lot to get one.
---
Black d'hide should *not* be strong for what it costs, because any peasant can afford it straight off tutorial island.
---
what about adding skill that allow players to craft magic armour?
---
Fuck integrity that's $2.9k.
---
Yep he's full of shit, watch it be fucking pirate gear
---
Toxic trident is really fast, but that‚Äôs a pretty large money investment
---
lol just read the post. Not even polling it. Might as well remove the item from the game.
---
Youre so wrong it hurts, technicality means botbing, its PvP my guy lol.

His quips seem to be related to the ore used to color him. Since this color way comes from the Daeyalt ore found within the Meiyerditch mine, I‚Äôd assume that‚Äôs where his knowledge of the myreque lore stems from
---
I think it was literally a bug and he just didn't want to show it on camera
---
Nice, I see your bots in Beta mode
---
Same for me. Happening for about 2-3 weeks now. Also noticed it's happening to some streamers I watch but they don't seem to  notice it.
---
no, but i'm willing to make an exception for you(;
---
I think the surprise is just because it was a huge copypasta for a long time all over the internet. Not too long ago either.

When the drops were rewarding, everyone on Reddit complained and it got nerfed :(

Fuck that's a confusing sentence

There's something fascinating about people who will start shit talking after any attempt to help them. In league I'll lex a player that there is a better rune and to try it out next game, and I'll be told to kms and to take my whole family with me.

Setup either, do I bring prayer pots and food.. please help me hahahaha

Song of the elves
---
I wouldnt really consider myself an EHPer by any means, but it fun having some sort of competitiveness among my friends and I. Me and my friend go back and fourth trying to beat each other's daily xp records and whatnot and it kind of spices up the boring monotonous training with friendly competition.
---
The ones in the tomb were killed because they were like lvl138 but spawned with like 10hp and since combat level decided drop rates of effigies these were the fastest in game by far before they were nerfed
---
AFK? Doesn‚Äôt it involve running back and forth? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs AFK
---
Like I said I fucked up. Chill out bruv
---
open invite!!
---
Generally people just use dragon bolts because even though some people antifire most don't and the ko potential is huge, there's really not much reason to use diamond in pvp anymore since the price is so low. 
---
Saying use full veracs is dumb as fuck though and shows you lack the understanding of what actually works in the wilderness.
---
Oh damn, I thought it was just my connection or something... I've this happening a couple times per hour. They're always long messages too...
---
Some of his videos surrounding botting must have taken an awful lot of information and research, so its at least a little understanding.
---
Also, tinfoil hat firmly on, didn‚Äôt some botters threaten to find him?
---
Yea I find it weird there is nothing about it anywhere so I made this post and maybe someone has solution to it or jagex sees it and can fix it.
---
I can already picture it in my mind.
---
So you‚Äôre actually 0-16..?
---
Today I hit 6k BH kills which has been a goal of mine for awhile, but I've been pretty unmotivated to PK. The gmaul nerf that's coming got me motivated to hop on and PK a bit. I'm rank 50 BH and generally risk \~500-800k a death. I do not unskull pk, spec tab, or rag (idk why but these were asked the last time I posted a pking accomplishment so I thought I'd answer them ahead of time)
---
I had a mini heart attack for a second because I also hit 99 range today LOL.

It was a bug with how teleport portals in POH worked.  Jagex has since fixed the bug.

And your barrows chests. I had a chest worth 3.4k yesterday. I‚Äôll have a tbow in no time.

That is decently late game RC training, but that is a fair point.
---
Yikes bro you have to be that one guy
---
It‚Äôs not being polled. It‚Äôs under the integrity section of updates, which are simply being added
---
No problem my dude.  Just respond to this on Reddit so I don't have to stay active on RS haha.  Cheers.
---
pretty shit for 110 days smithing gets u 500m
---
Your stats are better than mine were when i got my first. I used ~7 brews 1 range pot and the rest restores with a blowpipe, fury and blessed dhide and a blessing. Honestly though this isnt exactly the best setup but it worked for me so it should be fine for you.
---
Ingame yes, but not outside your app
---
Thanks!
---
Welcome to reddit and karma
---
The bow is worth $750...
---
Wouldnt suck if completionist cape comes out, resets your game number so you have to do 5000 games again
---
Just got a shoulder parrot worth 250k+ on 14th beginner
---
Thanks Obor.
---
I don't know if it really is. Pretty sure the lore is roughly same up until a certain point such as MM2, DS2, the Zeah quests.
---
This is 100% correct. It's the hard truth reddit will never accept. The wilderness has always been an ecosystem like you said, that's why the "pkers should only fight pkers" narrative will never work out in a classic wildy. We need the shrimp to attract the fishes and the fishes to attract the sharks. It's how every pvp spot works.
---
Unless a complete  overhaul is done (that even if done successfully might drastically change the game) that's how its gonna be.
---
Unlock it as a slayer task and use a imbued slayer helm.
---
Blessed d hide body, chaps, and boots, fury, barrows gloves, accumulator, blowpipe with addy darts, archer ring imbued or Lumby diary ring.
---
Take 2 ranging potions, 10 brews, 14 super restores, Torag legs and karil‚Äôs top switch for Jad wave.
---
You could also swap a brew and restore for 2 Anglers for emergency eating.

Maybe you haven't spent too much time on Reddit but you can find a post almost every day saying something along the lines of runecrafting being bad and making you want to die.
---
This positiveness to it is rare.

They're being used for other purposes, like LMS beta.

Dont forget the hcim legs/boots
---
explosives are a hell of a tool
---
i am doing barrows now, here's hoping
---
im hoping my luck is good enough to get some barrows gear
---
Agreed but I think they got the costs wrong... With current T10 prices it‚Äôs ~4.5m and you get 1m from killing someone (regardless if it‚Äôs a plus 1 item). Not many people are going to risk 4.5m, ever, in the wilderness. So now the people who were unkillable without the gmaul are just unkillable period.
---
It would have made more sense to make it a reasonably priced item (~500k) in my opinion. Then people would actually bother risking it and bring more loot to the wild.
---
Literally no one is going to PK with an upgraded gmaul if it is always lost on death other than tryhard youtubers in the first week of the nerf
---
Yeah, same way.
---
This is me.
---
&gt;~impressive~
---
Nice***
---
isn‚Äôt he supposedly like a piece of shit and exploited his brothers death for money and fame? i cant judge because i don‚Äôt know enough but all ive ever seen for him outside of the osrs community is hate.
---
You can also spam barrages and it works fairly well... Just means having no defenses while you pray for the barrage to land.
---
heres how it will go:
---
maybe a couple thousand (being generous here) people will show up
---
most of the people who show up will be hobbyists with cameras
---
they will be told to disperse
---
the few who don't fuck off will be allowed to loiter for a few hours before they get bored and go home
---
its literally a meme, have you ever browsed this subreddit for more than 1 second? literally almost every post of someones profile is like this.
---
Ironmen have way better ways to farm essence like Gargoyles, Zulruh albeit RC isnt the first thing they train
---
If you mean temple trekking then he can just drop slayer tomes
---
Boo
---
You‚Äôd make your best cash doing rune bars at blast furnace. 
---
But I agree with the vorkath comment lol
---
I mean he attacks with both... and you pray Mage so call it what you want
---
Highly unlikely unless he's black. In America, it's a crime to walk while black.
---
Are you planning to continue with Song of The Elves with that unit account?
---
No
---
Ok so nobody at all uses them. Even more reason to update them then. :D
---
Ah yes the good ol' 40 40s
---
He's been botting
---
Different mindsets I think. I prefer the aforementioned equip setup with augury and protect range. This maxes splash chance against mage and minimizes bolt damage from range. Then, depending on the flow of the fight, I'll either focus more on weapon swapping or protect swapping.
---
Prayers and armor swaps are only for accuracy/def boost while weapon swapping is to Max your damage output by countering protection prayers.
---
Bc of this, I priorize the weapon swap first and worry about prayers if I have the time.
---
I'm also playing on mobile 99% of the time, so working in more swaps is a lot harder with my retarded ass monkey thumbs.
---
Are you telling me people are going to have to actually use something other than a gmaul as a spec wep unless they are willing take actual  risk into wildernesses . What a tragedy.
---
im just trying to be supportive of your goals
---
Half price cut, good to see the ring still works.

---
I think it would slightly be game breaking because bandos items would come into the game so much faster

There is also nothing wrong with items only being good for PvP. Look at claws, ballista, ags etc.

It just needs to be balanced

---
Oh, hey.  Look at what you added to the thread.
---
You cant play rs in the browser anymore. Try downloading runelite instead of the main client. Half the community uses it instead of the default its safe
---
The items have the icon of Big Bones, but are labelled as Member's Object.
---
Right.
---
The problem is 3 people chaining specs/tb/freezes on 1 guy is a *way* bigger issue than Dinhs. Nerf the 6mil raid item, not the black dhide, makes no sense.
---
But some other redditor takes that comment doesnt metion that it has no source and it snowballs. Rumors start like that dude.
---
So Ive read, sadly, getting my hopes up. damn internet.
---
Yes theyre still dragon bones, if you are f2p you cant use members objects
---
Per Fox News from yesterday it‚Äôs like 400k now lol
---
Could anyone help me with a duel arena clue step?
---
Right, but the majority of players are content with the official client - the one Jagex allows.
---
Like I said, should there be no more centralization, it opens up a huge can of worms for them.
---
Wrong information from the wrong wiki, go figure
---
Young me from the mid-2000's is really impressed
---
LMFAO why are you so offended
---
Press space, not the button
---
Not offended at all. Just find it funny that you‚Äôre so insecure you find it weird that someone took 2 seconds to look at your profile
---
I mean, if you dont like people adding nothing to the thread, why are you adding this to the thread? Like yeah I could just up vote and move on, you could just down vote and move on. All in all who cares either way?
---
assuming you're getting hit often enough that blowpipe specs aren't more than enough to heal you, then yeah sure.
---
Deal with it

If you find a better picture of a group of JMods lmk.

I'm all for 3rd party clients, but RL+ is going to get them banned..
---
theres always gonna be a lot to take in if ur coming back after a long break, ive been there. a lot of things I think could have been done without tbh. but some things aren't so bad and were needed for the game to grow and people not to get bored. just wiki stuff you don't know and read up on the updates when you're doing smething afk . or ask friends in game what something is if you aren't sure.

On top of the mentioned, aim for the BIS mage cape, the imbued god cape. This can be gotten from Mage Arena 2. I myself am working on this, and have only gotten the unimbued version (mage arena 1). Please note it is a wilderness task, so research it and don‚Äôt take anything you aren‚Äôt prepared to lose.
---
this text only comes up, if you 
---
A. Talk to your mining pet 
---
B. have already set your mining pet to be colored based on Daeyalt, which is useless other than getting out of the mine in meiyerditch 
---
its not something that most people will ever come across or notice. and the dialog actually fits with the lore. Efaritay actually has a tale in RS lore, and it being something the myreque wouldnt tell you actually makes sense aswell.
---
the only thing they did was put the dialog into the format of the meme
---
something like Hatius Cosaintus is an example of hamfisted stuff, or the captian khaled npc in zeah
---
Howd u make the money for bandos at cmb 87
---
There's also a thanos meme in that Zeah volcano.
---
Ah yes, nonchalant zoophilia. The classic trope
---
The whole point of OSRS was that it was not going to stay the same. Jagex asked players if they wanted new stuff added into the game, players said yes. Some of the stuff has been great imo. We've gotten sequels to classic quests such as Monkey Madness and Dragon Slayer.
---
So yes it is OSRS as it is based on the backup of Runescape from 2007. Also the best part is you literally don't even have to touch any of the new content.

My ‚ÄúYou did me a favor and hired me as a young developer, so I took full advantage  of you as a company and don‚Äôt feel bad about it one bit‚Äù look.

They‚Äôre gonna pay ROT to hold down the area.

This is the worst video I‚Äôve ever seen

It's a shame olm gets so boring once you're in max. Suppose there's CM for that though
---
So zeah rc for elemental runes?
---
Very original! Been loving all your stuff man

It's true that OSRS isn't the game you left, but RS wasn't static when you played it either. In 2005-2006 they introduced 4 new skills (slayer, farming, construction, hunting). Compared to that, the OSRS team has been conservative in what they implement &amp; stuck to the design philosophy that RS3 had forsaken.

There's tons of guides online (youtube is saturated with em) to bring you up to speed, but give it a chance. Come for the nostalgia, stay because OSRS is actually pretty darn good
---
Yeah fire zombies. That sounds about right.

Again, it affects more than just pvp. It completely devalues my account

\#2 would be infuriating to get

I told some dude in a CoX to dwh guardians instead of d pick speccing and he spent the rest of the raid shit talking me. Really don't get people in this game lol

Meanwhile whoever I've spoken to that has used a Bulwark at the chaos altar tells me, "I literally can walk out when people try to kill me with a water staff and xeracian robes but once people start bringing actual magic gear more towards end game they catch almost every freeze and I have borderline 0 chance of escaping."

If people are trying to kill you when you're wearing black d'hide and a bulwark while doing prayer training, but they "risk" 10k in gear, they have absolutely no right to be complaining, especially if you consider that a lot of people don't bring black d'hide but rather something like Justiciar body, because your not fighting back.
---
Seriously if you want to kill people praying at the altar THAT badly and feel like their dinhs is a problem, maybe consider that they're not planning to fight back and consider wearing more then LITERALLY beginner content gear trying to kill someone wearing late/end game gear.

Repping Wisconsin!
