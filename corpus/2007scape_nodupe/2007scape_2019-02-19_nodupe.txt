You'd expect the rewards for the elite diaries to be a bit better and stuff like this to be part of the easy/medium diaries.

If summoning was released today, people would have pack yaks in the first 2 weeks

oh my dear these gems and ores look so satisfying!

This is actually the reason I made an ironman. I always would resort to buying gold. Now I can finally be self sufficient. Game is so much more interesting now as an itonman
---
/h
---
I transfered quite a big amount from RS3 myself, but I spent the money on skills and a bunch of not so expensive gear. So I'm not rocking bandos gear, but I've had a blowpipe and a trident in the bank since I was combat 50.

I made the client fullscreen and zoomed in all the way for the screenshot. when the image is scaled down, it looks smoother

You already can but it requires 99 sailing
---
Doorways like that need to have been a thing. I also think the idea of limestone walls being added. 
---
[removed]
---
Because there’s so many teleports to literally everywhere.  I would much rather have useful shortcuts or a cool boat because even though they’re functionally the same, it makes the game more interesting.
---
Already have the other ones I don’t see a reason to not add it back in.

Yes, I missed one the other day.

In the account information panel it should have those numbers and a /total for quests and achievement tasks. Like x/142 quests.

Something to farm for gold, it will still fetch a high value. Cool looking shield, same reason youd want any cosmetic. Question should be if it changes nothing why wouldn't you want it?

Not sure why I always think the "base" is also split into two
---
what abaut pvp how can you realisticly kill someone whit 30% damage reduction in singles?
---
stam pots at BF currently dont 100% self sustain though, you have to re stam with \~20-30 seconds left on the boost or you will eventually deplete your energy (doing gold bars with faster banking)
---
You're right its minimal but it would make a noticeable difference even if it allowed for enough regen to at least fully sustain the stam pot regen buff for the full duration.
---
Happy Birthday and good luck!!!
---
Who cares...
---
have you tried getting the robin instead?
---
Eventually though this will be the death of osrs. The time will come when 4k monitors are the standard and even larger monitors are more accessible. And the game looks and plays like utter trash on anything over 1080. People are voting not to future proof their game over the single 'mobile wont influence' line. I don't think they get the difference between designing for mobile and pc. So if a feature simply makes it to mobile first even if they developed it for pc 'fuck it its out of the hat cant do that now'? What the devs meant when they said that is that they will not introduce the dumbed down, autoplay aspects of mobile gaming into osrs.
---
Bloat if your entire team planked
---
Thx for the very informative answer!
---
First of all I see all your points of buying a better computer, but tbh I am just a regular father of two kids who plays a little bit whenever I have time. And when I get the time its usually just a couple of hours of OSRS or couple of games with LoL. So Im not the typical gamer who might have use for an i7 or a dedicated graphics card, or am I wrong here?
---
And when looking at the prices for an i5 with the Intel® HD Graphics 620 compared to an i7 with a for example Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 (2 GB GDDR5) it will be almost double the price.
---
So for my needs dont you think the cheaper one will be better for me, or am I just talking above my head here?
---
Armadyl has more HP and requires specific combat style. Bandos has also a little more HP haha? Maybe if they can hit through prayer then they would need more food than Sara wizzy

You’re also playing Ironman, which makes matter even less.

Konduit and RuneLite. IMO RuneLite is the best; if you choose to download it, only download it off of [RuneLite.net](https://RuneLite.net). There are a bunch of fake RuneLite clones that are actually malicious sites that will steal your account.

Sadly, if just using the running orb was a good enough answer, than i could even just go the old school way of using the run energy toggle in settings screen. in earlygame/ironman barrows runs, the inferno, and raids, its very useful to have the 1tick run toggle. Will just have to settle with slightly annoying my discord group then.
---
I'm not sure if I missed posting this to a more appropriate post, as this is kind of related to skilling but not really. Would it be possible to make it so you could mix spices of the same kind together like it is with potions? as in use orange spice(1) -&gt; orange spice(3) and it becomes orange spice (4)

Thank for for the detailed response!  I have been doing guthans method to heal.  Think it is a waste of 4 spots?  Maybe i can sell it and just bring 4 more sara pots.  I will try the arnour you r

Perfect timing. I got 5 in a row today! Cadantine, 2 x watermelon, 1 x papaya and 1 x magic tree. My next task was snape grass which doesn't take long to grow. Sigh, I love farming. 
---
I agree. 
---
Thanks, I mean. Yea, Why play it if youre gonna skip it. And yes, there are better ways to spend 400$.. And Yes the recovery email thing aswell..
---
I went into some digging myself about it. And noticed that some sellers have some decent about of reviews.. So what are they selling accounts that much to that much people? Where are they getting those accounts anyway? Botting?

The only time another spot outside of Revs is active is when some YouTuber makes a vid about pking at xyz spot. 
---
I used to pk on the slayer side of Revs on a nightly basis and it would be very rare to run into another pker. Then when Framed/Torvesta came out with the “pking at wildy slayer spots for Hydra release” vid pkers showed up for a week because they saw the vid and then it went back to being void of pkers. 
---
I miss the days of walking through deep wildy and knowing you could get hit by a pker at any moment and getting the pk jitters the moment you walked into the wild. Now you’re nearly guaranteed to never run into a pker at GDZ unless you run into the rare clan war.

this blow walls in my mind lol 
---
Okay cool! I'll try it - I've heard it mentioned on here a few times but i dont actually know what it is haha I'll look into it, thanks (:
---
No it's not. A toggle would enable spell-book filtering with the option to keep the spells the same size.
---
Sometimes I wonder why scamming and phishing is so common in this game, surely everyone is aware of it by now right? Then you get posts like this and it so makes sense.
---
F
---
Nice. Happy cake day!
---
Yeah i was doing the basic herb+tree runs but now ive decided to just plant snape grass for xp and hunt the pet through seaweed and everything
---
Currently on the grind to unlock humidify so i can throw a game or two of tithe farm inbetween runs
---
Only trees ive ever bought were willows, ive only planted expensive stuff that i gained on contracts
---
Already at 84 cant wait for hard contracts and more patches
---
If you can, work towards fairytale part one and the stats to start part two to unlock fairy rings. A lot of dungeons/monsters can easily be accessed that way!
---
Giving level 50 pures access to barrows glove seems legit. Its not like they aren’t op for their combat level anyway
---
Nobody tell him anything X 0 is always 0
---
It would be cool if it took your dot off the mini map
---
It really is. You can keep them the same size by not filtering your spellbook. Known the the 1st world as a toggle.
---
\#1 SUCKS LMAO...
---
Or maybe we don’t give a fuck about a 30 second clip when this post clearly breaks the subreddit rules?
---
Oh god yes. Just bring brews Man! 3 range pots, ONLY ADDY DARTS, dont bother with a switch to dragon and take an extra potion! The amount of brews/restores is up to you - depending how much you use. 
---
At 60 defense and 65 hp i still found i used more pray vs hp. I ended up bringing like 9 brews rest super restore? I did have purp sweets though. 
---
To be safe, just bring 3 range pot - 11/12 brew and then rest restores. And melt away! 
---
Lol you got me :) yes you should both be banned correct
---
Confused by the logic of hoarding the boxes before having the full set. Not judging, just confused.
---
Sounds like a great time, hope to see you guys there
---
i'd switch the Pegasus boots for the boots of brimstone since it has both range and magic bonuses.
---
The JUDGES are HORRIBLE!
---
Im just messin around dude, god bless! And have A great day
---
Lmfao imagine having an UIM that’s allowed to leave Morytania.
---
nah it's not that great, the spec is 65%, both melee weapons use 50%. 
---
Just start with basic allotments. Once you unlock herbs, do those. If you’re interested in making money, only do fruit trees and ranarrs or snapdragons (varies on which is more profitable), with allotments being optimal until snape grass. Snape grass is great xp with cheap seeds. Make sure to do hardwood trees on fossil island as well, because they are decent xp and cheap. Trees are the best way to 99 really quickly, but will drain your bank fast. 
---
the thing is if this guy had the game knowledge for flipping he would probably realize how poor his purchase choices are. Mans out here spending 99% of his bank on +1 strength and some def bonus while looking like a venezeulen for the rest of his gear.
---
Depends on how it's implemented. There are other factors involved.
---
Getting phished is not the only way to get hacked. But you are right it shouldn't be an achievement diary. It should be part of account making/tutorial. But hey you can keep saying it's too hard and never get the diary done
---
olm.
---
Abyssal Whips from demons show up under Sire, too. 
---
This doesn’t look good for me.

Looks good

True. At 110 you could easily be bossing. I do barrows every once in a while for decent cash and im only cb lvl 90
---
I wish Facebook would get sued for letting these blatant ads slip through while still making revenue for themselves.
---
That's what I'm thinking man 
---
1-2 weeks from release is 3-4 weeks, not two lol
---
No, you're just being stupid on purpose now. The toggle that would be necessary for me to vote for it would be toggling between spell icons that stay the same size when filtered and spell icons that change size when filtered.
---
can we get some of the minigame QoL that have been suggested in past Q&amp;A's
---
1. improving fishing trawler by shortening it.
---
2. mage training area improve the the telekinetic room so that every 5/10/25/50 completions in a row gives bonus points
---
3. void elite gloves???
---
4. BA could use some QoL but its to big of a job for this poll.
---
What the fuck
---
You must care a bit if you could care less then. Hell if you could care less you could care a lot.

I'd suggest the WeDoRaids discord if you don't feel like waiting for your friends to catch up

All we did was ask him to hop, he doesn't say anything and just does broken boy actions for 10 minutes

Kinda out of the loop. Did boaty die or something?
---
You know you can probably find a private server that allows you to get anything you want free so you don't have to complain about actually playing the game 
---
yep, and the reason you cant open them in combat is to stop glitches. There were a number of very serious glitches with using interfaces during combat.
---
Granted all of these bugs are now fixed for the most part, but I can understand if they dont want to touch anything there.
---
Tbh rwt and cash shops do make a lot of people less motivated or excited to play at all. Osrs is better than a lot of games because buying bonds for wealth is not cost effective at all, but if you check out Asian mmos like blade&amp;soul they've driven most of their players away by offering what is akin to max gear in the cash shop. The mentality is basically why bother grinding for gear if others can just buy it, which drives many to quit as they lose value in any accomplishments that they make.
---
Not that i was to promote anti scamming, buts thats not true. Scammers will give you 3-10m in hopes of getting 300m+. The popular one is you teaming up with a local good sumaritan and you help him antiscam a zgs while ur friend is risking the stank loot in the bank on a pvp world (no risk to u). He then asks you to split. Then they’ll chat with ya casually over 1-2 weeks then magically someone will try the scam on you and ur friend is conveniently online. Then instead of him scamming the zgs, they trick you into leaving the bank while ur in stank loot with whatever animation stall is popping at the time (think veng).  
---
What gave away my sense of authority over him at that point?

damn, your dog evolved

if u can do it irl (people have done it in a rowboat.. look it up) then u can do it here. saradomin will guide us! 
---
I understand your point that a delay would be a bandaid and not a perfect solution.. what I was saying is that it is a layer of security... when it comes to security each layer saves more and more people. Implementing the delay would have saved me every single time. I think Jagex is or should also work on details needed and criteria required for a recovery to happen, but a delay is something that can be implemented right away and start protecting a lot of people.
---
Any time any one sells an account the original owner can ALWAYS. Recover it. Be smart and don’t waste $400 on something like this.

Ok but why would he not have a fighter torso and bandos tassets.

I haven't met any low levels who earn bank who cant handle 2 hours that it takes to learn and win Barbarian Assault 
---
Arma is the more egregious one since Rigour and zenyte jewellery are far more important than arma
---
Minus xp lamps
---
The bandos, d full, or bulwark didn't?
---
Also with those stats he could get lucky a ton or do a ton of barrows ez money, rex and got lucky m.  So many options he could have done that don’t require a ton but with rng can get good money
---
I'd love to know how people have bank  tabs on the left side aswell as the top. Was looking earlier but couldn't find anything 
---
Lol is this true or a joke. To lazy to do my own research 
---
It's like 35k exp or so depending on lvl
---
Oh my god BoS irc chat. This took me back I miss koree and all them. Those clan CW events in w42 were so fun
---
How does exp between levels scale? Like does it increase by a pre determined amount or is there an algorithm for each level? 
---
Feeding off that question, how does that work for the theoretical levels beyond 99. I don’t know if it’s just a runelite thing (I understand 99 is the cap in the original client), but if you lookup a player and for example it says 102. Are these levels determined using the same algorithm or is the exp between say 98-99 and 99-100 the same and, has Jagex confirmed that the levels are actually indicative/accurate if there was say a level 100?
---
It's you who makes no sense, read the context of what you replied on. 
---
Have you heard about the mining and smithing rework?
---
its Trident of the seas (e)
---
&gt; Right but its impossible to play 24 hours a day without botting
---
lmao casual
---
Oh right on thanks!
---
Depends how you define expensive. Summer pies are not exactly the most expensive thing ever. And of course it depends at what level you plan to start boosting. If you want to do it 5 levels below the req, then yeah it will cost more than if you do it 2 levels below.
---
People would still bot even without rwt people are just lazy
---
Thanks be to Guthix. Amen.
---
The thing is though, by that scientific test (although this is not a scientific test but a discussion about the meaning of a pay2win game) osrs is also pay2win... bonds give an unfair advantage in the same way, if you look at it in an unnuanced way.
---
why did zammy hasta rocket in price?
---
No
---
You can redirect to Rim and Tav. If you want an unlimited version, Construction Cape. Mort'ton has Teleport Scrolls... Minigame Teleport... Burgh and Barrows also pretty close.

The complaint is that mobile leads to ezscape I'm pretty sure, an absteact term with varying use
---
I'm pretty sure that's the Funding-the-game-we-are-all-playing weapon. t-1 equip, so its pretty useful, and I think it has functionality similar to the teleother spells. Maybe you just don't realize that you have Accept Aid on.
---
K
---
Yes. Also necklace of bounty can reduce seed use and cost. 
---
what is this charity scammer accusation? can someone fill me in on this drama
---
huh. yeah it does make sense. it gives it a real sense of weight and makes things much more dangerous. I play a lot of nuzlockes in pkemon, so i understand a little about the thrill that comes from making actions have more weight and consequences to them.
---
what started this?
---
Idk why you got downvoted for the truth
---
I'm guessing you're an iron? Farming them while doing other things would probably be ideal. If you really just want them right now, probably go for hill giants, yeah.
---
I've been thinking this too! It's up at 911 right now. I have no idea what the Kevbo/Kebab/Zeah or whatever is. I just want my 99 mining. I've been at it for 5 months on and off, currently at 95. Then I wanted to blast-mine again, and realized the ridiculous price.   
---
Anyone predict when it will lower in price again?
---
Oh my god this guy clicked sharks instead of bloodvelds! What a loser 
---
Are we the same person?
---
ive never played a ton of pvp besides a small bit of castle wars. I guess i dont have much aptitude for it. Also i tend to get salty if i die. But i know pvp probably gives a big rush when you outmaneuver an opponent
---
Get your ass in their boy! It sucks but I did it recently and lvl 5 roles in all BA. definitely worth for the cape, and if you can’t get yourself to do it just pay a cc for the torso it’s a lot though I think around 20m
---
Thinking you can anti scam is the scam 
---
All that information for you to say authenticator delay wouldn't help. That's just a blatant lie. While it may not solve all your issues it protects you in the moment from losing anything not protected by pin. It takes little to no Dev effort to make authenticator delay. It's just another step of security, and when you look at it like that there's no reasonable argument against it. 
---

It really is that easy, 90% of the playerbase seems to be too afraid to put gp in the grand exchange for anything other than shit that goes on their equip screen though.

Way to go!!!
---
somebody was baiting in Zulu's chat and he chose to make personal attacks against Doge a streamer like him should know better
---
Same here man. Only ever planted high level seeds from shit I got from contracts. 
---
Great post and something ive been thinking about a lot.
---
My account was hacked in like 04 or 05 after one of the major fan sites got compromised. I know my old old info is still out there as ive seen the leaked database.
---
When i signed up for osrs I stupidly used the same email not really thinking I'd play very much. Now I've got 2 factor on everything and done all the extra steps (unique passwords, bank pin etc) but still worry that they could use that slither of info from all that time ago to recover the account. Has anyone ever got Jagex to change the email the account was registered with? 
---
I only worry as the account recovery does seem to be the weakest link in the equation.
---
I think we're in the same boat lol lets be friends
---
Sounds like you've begun to learn how flawed democracy is.
---
Yep low HP ironman, was going to grind enough before going to f2p cos I would need to grind with cannon (for no HP exp)
---
I could see after 400 contracts it would get pretty old. 
---
Ya, so this meme is about Settled, arguably the most popular Runescape Youtuber at the moment. He plays a very restrictive game mode called Ultimate Ironman. These accounts are very restricted because they can’t store items in a bank or get items/gp (trade) with other players. 
---
Settled’s account is even more restricted because he has limited himself to only playing within one very technical region in the game (morytania). He is limited to some training methods that are extremely slow. I.e. takes him 30 hours to get 10 levels, when any regular account could get those same levels in 15 minutes. 
---
The first time I played castle wars I thought the whole stopping in ice thing was just a part of the minigame, cause it happened so consistently and I couldn't see who was attacking me. I recall thinking that they should update that part.

I don't think its worth it for stuff where banking is convenient because of the insanely high cast cost. It's really good for raids and DKs and I guess Kraken for this reason. Banking for zulrah and all that is quick anyway
---
I farmed medium clues for most of my gear. 4 ranger boots within 150 clues bought me almost all bis melee gear and i'm currently 1100 total. One look at me and you definitely think credit card but not the case.
---
1250 is when players begin to really start playing osrs. 1250 is also generous to players who are pures or are account specific.

Would we be able to prevent the farmers near hops patches to not wander away as far?
---
wait i just canceled but if i resub i’ll be charged again and i don’t want another charge yet....lol oh well. 
---
Oooh, if you're trying to stay low HP, cannon them or just farm them. Farming them isn't bad if you do a bunch of patches at once every time.
---
I saw the facebook ad for this, and couldn't even fucking report it because facebook is absolute trash.

If there was a dupe, I assure you, every single person would know within an hour, no matter how many posts they take down, they don’t have control over discord’s, other forums, word of mouth etc so everyone would be rushing to do it with their gold only to realize that they’ll be banned for quadrupling their banks and by the next day it’ll most likely be hot fixed.

so do i but its out of choice, i personally think OP's graphics look stupid and not at all like runescape should

Have u tried the single rock locations? I know they aren't as good on paper but in practice I find them to be much better gp/hr. There's one next to dark beasts and there's one near some trolls on one of the fremenik isle(sorry I forget the name)

If I want to afk ammonite crabs for some mobile friendly XP, at 52 range, what would be my best set up?
---
Mith darts? Or MSB (imbued?) I'm not sure, I've seen different recommendations around here 
---
The obby legs do not always affect it. Totally depends on your setup. 
---
When doing slayer with my current setup and super str pots, my max hit is 39, and obby legs do not raise it to 40.
---
Naa because I understand this is a game, I still do my one when I get up, one before and after work, and one late night one. 
---
'It's failed 3 times' - may as well bring it in. What is wrong with you?
---
I don't really understand the hype around 'got the drop on the first kc'... one in every 250 people will get it on their first med clue which isn't *that* rare, right?
---
Congrats though :)
---
why are you posting about it on reddit if you already submitted a bug report

Wow, do you know if those people got a perm ban or just like a couple weeks?

Nice!

Along with budget or wellfare gear...  Like hide shields, broodoo shields, ibans staff, to name a few things...

yeah buy heart. otherwise magic levels is your next best investment

gz on not understanding statistics
---
did you have to make a new account? It literally is telling me 
---
"Sorry, you didn't manage to claim this loot during the promotion. More great offers will be available soon." 
---
this is so annoying. also charged me for the month instead of free month 
---
Trees are the most efficient way to train the skill. In the time you save by doing trees instead of doing fruit trees for a few extra months, you could go to a dedicated gp/hr method and make back the gp you spent. 
---
H
---
People who have been around with high levels can often say things that are true but unpopular since they’re in the minority.. unfortunately my guy didn’t even make a point. Herb runs are definitely a waste of time if you care about effiency shit so are you complaining more patches were added for people to make $$? Pretty high level myself, only thing busted about farming now imo is that redwoods mahogany and calquat seeds cost way to little for how much easy xp they give. Shit I’d do mahoganies if each sapling was 100k
---
your str level is still going to decay from str pots, obby legs afaik always will even if they don't give a max hit at max str boost extend the duration you keep a max hit.
---
looks like you've been skipping leg day.
---
could do some slayer to train your stats for raids, which would help fund skilling
---
Haha its okay i wasnt completely broke, exaggerated a bit. Still had a bit of cash. :) Also had plenty of items that get basically no usage i could of sold if needed. 
---
Ah yes i actually have been meaning to do some DKs. However I've not done them before - I know they aren't that hard, but I think is it still most efficient to kill all of them? Or just do rex or whatever it is? Ive heard some people only kill one - i think its rex. But i need to do a diary again there to be efficient right?
---
See thats the annoying thing for me, id love to get some barrows trips in but without the hard diaries its apparently not really worth it. But to do the hard diaries i need some stats (I think just agility? Im only 55) oh shit i just thought..you can boost stats for diaries right?? 
---
I do need to start doing all the easy and medium diaries at least since i can complete basically all of those everywhere lol. Diaries are new to me, but i probably should start knocking them out. Most are pretty easy. Some hard Diaries i do need some skills/quests for though! I still need to figure out how to train farming..for the life of me i cant find a guide that explains to me EXACTLY what items i need to bring, where to go, what to click on and who to talk to etc. They always just say like "plant this and use super compost, pay X npc etc" and it confuses me. Im only 37 farm :( really want 46 so i can do fairytale 2 so i can do that queen clue step. 
---
I think I'll do mm2 tomorrow tbh. And maybe find out how to train farming if i can. Id love to start bursting and get my mage up. 
---
YES! Fuck those people are annoying. So many of them are bots too!
---
Tbow is well outside my reach, they are 1b right? my total bank is only 100m.
---
I don't know what a sanguinesti is but i'll look it up.. I am currently doing 2 kills per trip so is scroll still better gp/hr than fairy ring at PoH?? 
---
I feel like 20k per scroll adds up quickly to save an additional 20-30 seconds of using House tele, fairy ring and running to the dock.. Is scroll use proven to be better? 
---
Nice.
---
Slightly unrelated: I wish players and NPCs would disappear into the fog instead of vanishing just as they hit it
---
Alch yourself
---
What stats are recommended for raids?
---
PM me about the dupe please, I promise not to ruin the Venezuelan economy any further. 
---
It's an item from clue scrolls called Ale of The Gods. When you equip it your character appears drunk. 
---
I think it’s the one where you drop stuff on the bridge but can’t get it back
---
Flexing that you can spend hundreds of mills into a cosmetic item while you autocast burst spells on noobs in castle wars of course
---
I think mith darts are better unless you're using rune arrows in an MSB(i).
---
Mileage may vary, but you can test it yourself with the [DPS calculator.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit?usp=sharing)

Pink party hat was the now purple party hat in rsc.
---
Yeah he’s literally on 24/7 and no life’s it lol it’s really bland at this pint 
---
It depends on your kill times. If you average kill is say 2:30, and a scroll saves you 30 seconds, then every 5 scroll you "buy" another Zulrah kill. Since 5 scrolls are 100k and a kill is about 140k on average (according to wiki), then it's worth it. Best way to find out is to test for your self. Do and hour with scroll and an hour without, see how many kills you get each and how many scrolls you use.
---
Eh-lie-jin

This is something I learned early on is pvm is strictly for morning stuff when im wide awake. I fall asleep at skilling too often.

Can a crossbow string be added to the thievable items from the crossbow stall so you can steal everything required to make your own crossbow?

Absolutely loved FoG
---
While I'm not arguing that he didnt earn it I'm curious what the likely hood of it is if he went for max profit while training all his skills. 
---
“This this most people don’t want is comparable to a bosses drop table balancing issue”
---
Quantities of items dropped by monsters have never been up to the players. “Should we increase the drop chance of a dragon war hammer to 1/512 instead of being 1/5k?” Half the players are so moronic they’d vote yess to that.

I worked a handful of corporate white collar job for many years now (I'm 27) and have completely lost my mind. Currently in the process to switching to a blue collar job (firefighting; a passion of mine), hoping it'll lift my spirits. Either way, you will always find me on RS at night. &lt;3

 I never understood for example the purpose of having hundreds of searchable boxes, drawers, chests, wardrobes that give nothing. I once found that you can get a needle from haysack but thats it. It would be nice, if they added some random junk chance in those things.

Can we add/remove runes to the rune pouch while having the bank open? Currently, we’re able to empty the rune pouch but cannot add runes to it without closing out of the bank.

TBH the I let thing that consumes my time are herb runs, I do 3 a day on 8 patches, but I've been doing that for so long I take 2-3 min per run now.

My fastest was 1:57 with no special gear at all.

No arma, no bandos.

I had a ranges &amp; melee setup: ranged was

Slay helm ( duh ), fury, blessing, blowpipe, god hide &amp; boots, barrows gloves &amp; archers (I)

Melee was DDS, whip, fury, barrows gloves, torso, torags legs, D def, guardian boots &amp; berserkers ring (i)

I have Rigour and in the third phase I stand behind the flying bitch &amp; just whack her without picking up the 3 spheres.

Hilarious that your solution to not getting recovered is so extreme. OSRS is the only site/service/game that I've ever come across that requires you to go to such great lengths to stay secure. Every other site has competent security.
---
The solution to not getting recovered is for Jagex to fix their system. I shouldn't have to go to greater lengths to protect my RuneScape account than I do for my bank account
---
Poll the Ancient Mace removal in PVP or revert the BGS method.  It's unfair being able to be smited by 30 people when my group of 7 people can't do the same back.  Basically group of friends vs clans.. it's a hard life

When done properly, he is the most profitable and also the fastest exp master :) The difference isn't huge tbh if you aren't going for max efficiency, so if you don't have access to the tele or NPC contact, don't worry about it

Thanks homie.

Sorry for the shit pic quality btw.
---
Smh... ez scape
---
I still don't understand the purpose of these particular auto typing bots. They just repeat whatever you or someone else says near them. I assume their original intend purpose is to repeat a scam advert that one bot is saying.
---
There is no official way to.  The only possible ways to go to a clan chat, I'm not sure which ones are legit, you'll have to do some searching around for that.
---
If it were possible the economy would be ruined.
---
No, you cant
---
I would just do Dihns Bulwark and some dhide. 100 noted bones(calculate the exact amount so your last unnote fills your inventory up) Mage arena 2 locator orb to die faster, then drink wine for final hit.
---
Or you can do:
---
Serp helm, Dihns bulwark, frem diary boots, mage cape, black dhide, suffering, a few brews, burning amulet and glory. However now you can no longer suicide so banking takes longer
---
Yeah I’m gonna need you to make that into a RL plug-in please.
---
Amazon has some pretty cool hoodies.
---
I've done 1000+ hard or higher clues and have only died twice. Some wild steps deserve a little simple caution like not tellying into high traffic areas.
---
There are also many people who are wearing nothing who have risk on them like glories, bones, a bracelet, and occasionally even more. Spades keep it interesting too because you never know until you kill them.

It is very good at Scorpia... the issue is that it risks a disproportionate amount versus the Craws and Viggoras and so feels unfair to use.

Also basically mandates standard spellbook, which means no Ice Barrage without a friend or alt.

My personal best is 1:52 with a regular melee set up and blowpipe. 
---
Literally all best in slot gear except like jewelery has been on a steady increasefor a very long time. It's not just bandos.
---
Has anybody ever seen themselves on the friends list of a posted picture ? 
---

---
Nope, you should try the official runescape forums.
---
IMO just go with a dorgeshuun crossbow and bone bolts. Unless you have the money to spare on mith darts I don't think the xp is drastically different.
---
This missed skilling week and isn't something to be polled tbh but Idk where else to try to ask a jmod about it (don't use twitter). 
---
Within the last few months something changed the way you open bird nests. You used to be able to just like spam click the last one in your inventory and it'd open them from start to finish. Some update recently changed it to where you have to click them individually to open. So spam clicking the last one in your inventory just only opens the last one.
---
Can this be reverted back?
---
IDK u suck at that game 
---
You're legit retarded if you think it's just as easier or easier to make the first 15m of 45m rather than the next 30m.
---
Money makes money, the more you have, the easier it is to make. Use you fucking brain.
---
Very niche. Unlike the others, fury has defensive + prayer bonus. That being said... In the current meta, you'll almost always pick one of the other three over fury.

That all looks pretty slick, I'm surprised there's nothing like it for Old School. I've been looking for a project to start up, I might try my hand at making something like it. Could even use the GE API to calculate risk. I don't think OSRS has an API for item info though unfortunately, so that'd have to be manually compiled and maintained.

What's the best way to grind out Herblore without sinking way too much money into it? Is passively doing herb runs + NMZ + Kingdom my best bet? I'm not interested in a macroefficient "blow your cash stack on it now and grind Vorkath to make the cash back and save time" approach, but I'd like to know if there are any other things I can do to gather herbs that aren't as time-locked as those three.

the first step is to get rid of that scim. you have 70 attack, you should be using a dragon scimitar, or at least a  d long. Monkey madness should be extremely easy at your level and will give you a ton of combat experience. Other quests to work towards

I've actually added every OSRS JMod on Reddit as a friend. This makes it so that their posts and comments show up in /r/friends, no matter where they post.

Witch's Potion predates the introduction of Ironman Mode by 13 years, and as far as I know you've been able to cook meat again to burn it since Runescape's release in 2001.
---
Also, Imps can drop burnt meat.
---
However you want to fill your time is fine. It's when you start using it as an excuse not to do the shit you really need to... that's where it becomes a problem.

Konar? Lol sadly she is dead content unless ur maxed and wanna do Hydra.

I'm guessing Runelite GPU mode

All i want to know is how much and why were you zooming in on him to notice the earrings
---
Rc next then 
---
If the dropped those they would lose about 1/4 of their profit...?
---
BO4 MP is great, but ZM (my mainstay in CoD) is severely lacking this year. New perk system is garbage.
---
Im currently making a custom map for BO3 ZM on PC, will likely include some Runescape references in it, maybe some PaP gun names or something, or a Dragon dagger for a knife upgrade
---
Watch out for your future hemorrhoids
---
You're right, if you're American and W330 isn't laggy as shit then yeah you could save yourself 50M.
---
However, not everyone has good ping to W330, hence someone has been hosting on W520 after 4PM GMT for the last few months. 
---
Magicstonecreate unenjyoable
---
because 99.9% of tasks in this game are repetitive and not challenging, so why would you want to focus on that? 
---
 
---
Eh, I've tried it many times and can never seem to make anything, shit just does not buy or sell for me 
---
Fuck no.
---
Stay on lunars use House Tele tabs
---
zanik doesn't deserve this
---
Rekt.
---
2fa on your email yes, 2fa on runescape is next to worthless. Way too easy to remove it
---
400 DK KC with 5 warrior rings and 2 rings of life. Not even an axe, ffs.
---
haha dam I just moved from Christchurch hopefully they have this at vic uni in welly
---
isn't this more popular than it is now? what's the player base like now?
---
yep
---
I got 42 seconds, seen screens of 41 but it hasnt been confirmed ingame
---
Because some of those afk skills are needee for something else you want to do later, like a quest. or slayer. or pvm

btw

I don't go to uni but if I did I'd be all about it. Up the 03

hey man its TheOnyxKing I saw you during slayer
---
if youre actually curious, i didnt really zoom in.
---
playing 10 years ago doesnt mean you been playing for 10 years
---
The top one is an airpod right? /s
---
RSUCC
---
you know theres a free mems trial thats comes with logging in on mobile right?
---
Or make begging a muteable/bannable offense.
---
yeee do it it's fire
---
going dry can cause fissures, stay safe comrade
---
Yes, this will make my 9 step 75k clue feel much better.
---
frickin got me
---
I still don’t get what any of you think authentication delay will really do 
---
And defence level. 
---
blowpipe is almost always better dps then melee. The difference between your melee stats and ranged isnt that high, so i would go with ranged. If you dont want to spend as much on scales you can just use melee. I have done the calcs and blowpipe should be better dps with your stats. i picked affordable gear with mithril darts.
---
We get it
---
But that ring would require a house tab. Well im a noob, so I can only get max 2 kills, and that shark really really helps. I dont have construction anyway. Speaking of construction, it devalued desert elite anyway. 
---
I fully understand what you're getting at pal but it's such a minor thing, it's just a drop which can be sold/alched just like rune items etc imo. If you start doing this why wouldn't you do it to every other alchable which holds its price? The slayer use etc. is not viable, even if they halved in price nobody would use them.
---
See the bright side, its like cash being dropped to the floor for you. 
---
why would you try to scam anyone even another scammer... op ur greed was taken advantage of
---
He was dry though, on B ring. He's btw so every other drop is just another placeholder. 
---
I got permed on battlescape for rwt way back when I was younger, didn’t realise they were still going 
---
Apparently this is some reverse psychology shit, "If I help this guy that doesn't need it, he will return the favour and help me"
---
It's an asinine line of thinking, but coincidentally that's what you need to be to give to beggars.
---
yeh
---
Give it time. 
---
I'm saying I didn't get the dialogue for easy and medium tier rewards, didn't get easy and medium lamps, didn't get easy and medium blessings. It just went straight to hard. My inventory wasn't full, it didn't drop on the ground, I just wasn't given easy and medium lamps, only hard.
---
My inventory was almost empty, but I still checked the floor, I also tried re-logging and speaking to Elise multiple times to no avail. I'm a veteran runescape player, I know how diary rewards are supposed to work and this isn't it.
---
Well it's no surprise he died then
---
Id say calling some rando autistic IS a harmless comment on a reddit thread
---
Then again, reddit comments in general are just harmless, except if you dox someone and post their info I suppose
---
Ngl i busted hundreds of nuts to some of those hd models when they first came out
---
Sounds like it's unintended in meantime though I would advise cutting Dramen branches since will cost u nothing for an inventory of staffs
---
sucks man, just hit my 670th and still none either.
---
Give you time to stop the take over. What's the problem with it? 
---
This game has a built in auto spammer... All you need is some handy 3rd party client that will notify you when you get a trade offer and you can do whatever else you want.
---
Fool

r/theydidntdothemath
---
I was far from eficient so it took me longer than the average person. Around 400 hours for mining (30k/hr at mlm) and 300 hours for agility. 
---
Obviously
---
B-b-b tw 0w0
---
It's not easy scape, it's not being so shit at making a guide that you constantly forget an item and don't bother to edit the footage.
---
That would make anything in this game afk because anything can be botted lol 
---
the website requests a screenshot of your run energy.
---
oh cool, want ot tell me to earn gold my doing slayer too?  or train woodcutting with an axe?
---
"surprise you got scammed" is still a surprise.
---
r/Beatlejuicing
---
It took me a good 20 kills to finally get it, one thing that finally made it click was listening to the sound, every time Vork makes the spitting acid sound you click afterwards, so you’re clicking between spits. When I was learning I was clicking way too fast.
---
Now 1 tick clicking has been engrained into my head I don’t need sound anymore, but it really helped at the start.
---
No, people safespotted in 2005. The pathing of the monsters was even worse back then because they couldn't walk diagonally. This made it much easier to safespot because more monsters would get stuck behind the italy rock.
---
I have them on my block list. 
---
Literally get 99 thieving then do master farmers
---
What gear did you use? 
---
Show. Me. The. Proof. That. Is. The. Case.
---
Be seeing you!
---
I dont know if your being serious or not...
---
Yes
---
Shorten the dialogue with the Farming Guild's Guildmaster when turning in/obtaining contracts.
---
have a good one everyone
---
just solo it?
---
Just so you're aware, that was never made clear in any of your posts until now, so spare me the attitude.
---
Gratz dude! Yet to get mine but soon probably
---
This post has some really weird energy
---
Might be interested as well
---
Cant tell if this is sarcasm or not...
---
A lot of them are word of mouth and some are reddit. Look at /r/divine_valor if you want another option
---
99 prayer... nice
---
good
---
My gear was as follows:
---
Neitz helm (Verac’s would be an upgrade over it), god d’hide, Verac’s skirt, snakeskin boots, Ava’s device, fury, blowpipe, god vambraces and lumby diary ring (for prayer bonus)!
---
Btw you can run away, re-log and the guardian will be different if you ever get flappy bid there you can just hop. 
---
Wtf
---
Hes mining tin obviously
---
/r/woooosh
---
Now THIS is the art we want in the game /u/Mod_West! Please make everything like this, thanks. :)
---
Seriously though, this seems like a beautiful rendering issue from a 3rd party client. 
---
Well you'll be dead, so you won't be the one explaining it.
---
I’m not accusing you of lying, but it’s possible to clear kills that you’ve received on runelite. This could very well be 300 kills, but you could delete the data from a ton of them, right?
---
I think about it a lot even today
---
Oh boy, i could rock again my Boxxy inspired look in runescape. I still have this haircut with facemask on runescape3. best outfit with agile top and bottom. NOSTALGIA JuST HIT ME AAAAAAAA
---
Covefe
---
Exactly what I was thinking lmao the old my friend wants it 
---
My guild? What guild? 
---
Increase which numbers?
---
I'm confused. 
---
1400 total in a week? Someone must be botting nearly 24/7 or dropping dough training lol. 
---
Do you often buy/sell accounts and are you going off of prices that way?
---
You used the meme wrong, the 2nd panel is supposed to have pictures of things that are actually better.
---
Nice. I got my first 1m last night from making unfinished potions.
---
ewww third party client user
---
Not sure what you mean. I'm relatively new to the game. 
---
Do you think if you keep posting this someone might see it?
---
Hi it sounds like your guild could use some more epic players to increase those numbers. I'm willing to join and already smashed the skulls of many slayer tasks with my Torag's Hammers.
---
You can find me meditating on top of White Wolf Mountain on world 358 if you wish to talk.
---
Nice 
---
It's not and not sure why you would ask that. 
---
Why does it look like it was Kieren who got to meet you?
---
Such a jolly fellow.
---
I died to that one once after having that clue step in my bank for months and having grinded multiple days for items for one of the previous emote steps. Felt really bad :(
---
Oh aha fair, well techinally, level 92 is halfway to 99 due to the amount of xp needed, so in reality , not even close to 99 
---
Nice, I have similar combat stats so made me more confident in giving it a go now. Just curious, how comes you hid your agility n runecrafting?
---
I'd do it just to get them to shut up
---
At least honor the meme with that high alch
---
Awesome, welcome to the millionaire club. 
---
54 is a little bit more than 1% to 99
---
1 nature rune, 5 lava* runes, because I'm a cheapskate ;)
---
Dont think i dont spot that 👌 fucker
---
bank sorting, allow us to put an item in between 2 items instead of the long tedious way of shifting one at time when you get something new
---
 The only time these threads are relevant is if the guy has like 1b+ in gear on him and a -1000 total. 
---
This just looks like a regular player 
---
you do know that at least 80% of content on OSRS is from RS3 right?
---
Its glue-bicep
---
Tournament worlds.
---
You really are a brainlet aren’t you, what you are talking about is flinching like at guardians in raids 
---
Nobody calls it the guardian walk because they are different. The wood walk is used for moving every single tick, if you barrage somebody with only a melee wep on you don’t have to woox walk to hit without being hit, you only have to flinch them. Go back to pking people for spades
---
Well I leveled up from 10 to 54 pretty quickly so I just assumed it will be smooth sailing from there. 
---
Id get ancest over bandos, and justic helm over veracs
---
Also
---
*Anguish and occult switch*
---
You don't wanna do the inferno with scrub tacts if you dont have tbow and bis. Youre better off learning how to flick over relying on range def
---
Thanks guys, it sounds like it's not worth while to use my super combat pots on these tasks so I'll just stick to super str and att pots. 
---
Tanning dragonhide, particularly with the tan hide spell of the lunar spell book. Requires hard frem diary. Doing it the old fashioned way still profits more than cooking sharks though.
---
This is only one thing too off the top of my head. Tons of stuff are omega afk and make more than cooking sharks. Like wtf I think fishing sharks is MORE afk possibly than cooking them and makes more. 
---
Because it’s Reddit...
---
Is that with Ruby bolts then switching to diamond late in the kill?
---
I've only got blowpipe and no rigous so anything sub 2 min is amazing to me lmao
---
Its been that way since BO2, for a good 7 years now lmao
---
Shut up Hermoine.
---
I just think that 2fac should be the no 1 priority for any player who doesn't want to lose their shit.
---
Would Zulrah be doable with Ibans Blast (only 64 mage) and blowpipe (75 range) or not worth the time/effort
---
Easy scape (btw he does edit it)
---
yes
---
Thanks man! Just take a look at a few guides and you should be able to do it no problem!
---
Disable Protect Item for Ultimate Ironman accounts like it is on High Risk worlds since it has no effort for them.

Correct. You switch at about 1/3 health. The Ruby proc hits 100 when Vorkath is at high health. I used dhcb with rigour for a while before selling dhcb and now i cant bring myself to go back with blowpipe

---
Dude Your not strengthing Your point with those examples. Tanning hides is not afk at all because you have to constantly click and fishing sharks is litteraly the Biggest waste of time ever. You could have used fishing karambwan as a better example of fishing something usefull
---
I’m aware! Just lazy :))

Why not just start at 20 and let it go up to 80! Make people regret not taking that antipoison!

Well the I'm gonna have to disagree with yourv suggestion
---
So when people say 'the untradables' they refer to really good items which have to be earned by the player, you can't buy them with gp. 
---
All of what I listed you can look up on the wiki but i'll give you a quick run down on the main ones.
---
Fighter torso: Highest strength bonus top in game, this means you can hit higher wearing this item than any other chest. It has the same offensive bonuses as a bandos chestplate which is around 22m, just less defence. It is earned through the barbarian assault minigame. 
---
Dragon defender: Best in slot offensive offhand weapon until the very late game. It's a little dagger you wear instead of a shield and has exceptional offensive bonuses. Earn it by killing cyclops in the warriors guild 
---
Elite void knights armour is the upgraded version of void knight armour. It is a great budget hybrid set that can be used until you have enough for 100m+ gear set ups. It's earned through the pest control minigame which you can get to through the minigame teleports. 
---
Ring imbues are the upgrades for the fremmenik rings, you imbue them with nightmare zone points and it doubles their stats, and makes them untradeable. 
---
Fire cape is the best offensive and defensive melee cape most players are likely to ever attain. You get it by beating the tzhaar fightcaves which is very doable with a bit of practise and 75 ranged.
---
Another thing thats really important is to imbue your black mask, or slayer helm ASAP. This will allow you to train slayer effectively with all 3 combat styles.
---
A great place for research and read about the game is the wiki, it is actively edited and has pretty much everything you need to know. Ensure that you don't end up on the fandom wikia as it's no longer moderated and is a complete mess. The correct site can be found at os.rs.wiki or just google whatever you want to know and then add -wikia
---
I'm happy to answer any questions but if it's something specific (like what is pest control) you'd be better off just looking on the wiki, you'll get a faster and better answer there anyway.
---
Good luck :)
---
I hate when that happens
---
Buy he never said that. He said he likes farming.
---
Good one tbh but to be fair I know my mains info lol
---
Ahajdjrjfkvldjen indeed
---
But at least he only uses one attack style
---
Both. We do not discriminate. there's also a discord server
---
PLEASE.. jmods.. PLEASE have a look at this.
---
how many points do you get every 10th task
---
Lolololl
---
The rich gets richer
---
3 cosmics per orb, so 33k cosmics. Assuming you get bstaves and attach em you'll get 137,5 crafting xp per staff then you can highalch em all for 9,3k a pop while doing agility/questing or whatever task (between hits while doing safe slayer) - itll boost your crafting and magic and if you RC yourself then you'll get some good RC lvls. 
---
This is assuming you want to take the longer route for it and that you arw interested in leveling multiple skills whitout being the most efficient. Tbh I tend to do 1-2k orbs every now n then to have for my daily battlestaves to then alch when I do something else. Its relaxing for me and a decent chunk of change. I couldve definitely made more doing bosses if I had better gear but this gives me the fund to reach the next step for my character. Done this while doing quests and its funded my 83 con while getting questcape.
---
My gf literally does the exact same thing all the time - sharks are croissants.
---
Don't wear void. Wear high defense armor. Magic bonus does not matter as the brothers have no magic defense. 
---
Lol, that Slayer thong
---
Shame I didn’t join last year. Pretty sure they got Rodd Carr or someone to do one of the meetings last year hahaha 
---
c ya in 1 hour
---
had the same issue trying to get the game for my nephew on mac 
---
Doable, as in get a kill, sure. So if you want it for the diary and for some reason don't want to get your mage up, go for it. It is however gonna be far from efficient, and if you make any money at all, it will be less than what you get from other bosses, such as barrows.
---
ol good F2P 
---
Wouldn't really boost your PVM skills because in no instance will you ever get a challenge in OSRS that's *that* difficult, unless the JMods are mean. Each jad attacks on a tick and there's a 1 tick respite before resuming.

Lunar staves are claimable from Perdu dude, but you can only have 1 at a time and it costs 60k

DPS &gt; Defense in almost every scenario

If it doesn't give you a max hit then it's not good for you.
---
No one asked, espacially not your braindead ass. 
---
Is that actually a thing? Lol..
---
Hahah madlad
---
Its inevitable. We can only go so far with game mechanics when it comes to gear powercreep. Honestly how much more powerful can you get than the tbow, scythe and blowpipe? 6 years in and we're kinda already reaching a really high ceiling with our weapon powercreep.
---
So we have few choices in order to keep coming out with new end game pvm. Keep releasing even more and more broken items, or release things like curses and summoning.  
---
There are not QoL these are ninjas

I've seen the marble gargoyle KO a few people, surely that's up there lol

You kill it before you get the freeze. So you need posion pools first.

There’s no point having 2fa on just your email lol if the hacker has your password then he’s straight into your account. He’d have to have access to your email to remove it which is why they work together.

Every single one has a place on a poll. It’s nice to see posts like these. 
---
Could have made it 25 and added hide poll results! 
---
Most of them are, yeah. But that's what QOL is supposed to be. Not "hey lets poll the divine spirit shield" or "increase spell icon sizes" etc.
---
Oh I see what you’re saying. So for normal kills you can’t prevent being frozen right? It’s just for speed kills you want to kill it before it happens. 
---
“espacially” you call someone braindead and you type that? Not sure if you are trolling or what
---
Duradad all the way

Can bird house traps left click be 'empty'? Would be easier for mobile and many people do this on their phones per hour

I don't know, sorry. That said, I would have thought that locking just locks it in so you can craft other runes. You could then unlock it when you want to change it. If you find out, you could edit the wiki.

YOU ARE definitely the result of a failing education system.

Brainlet meme, upvote.

I wouldn't anticipate many of these being controversial or impactful enough to even warrant a poll! I highlighted 5 that I think would need 75% approval but otherwise these are all sneaky little tweaks that I envision going into the "In other news..." sections of the weekly update newsposts. Thanks for the positive feedback!

I’ve had them in my bank for a looooong time, back when I was real poor and had 65 fishing so used them to boost for fishing guild.

It doesn't give me a max hit because my strength bonus is 109, making it 113 at the cost of 25% of my defense is fucking stupid

Lots more feedback to come :) gl

---
Ah I see. Unfortunately I can’t offer any sound advice on that set up. I ran with Ancestral and Armadyl. 
---
It's the only decent one. They haven't added any new hairstyle for years maybe its because they wanted to update the hideous character model that they say is underway but its been years. New NPCS look better than your own character model now. 
---
Reeeepost
---
Mod Ash talked about adding an NPC to quick travel off the island after completing the Elite diary. Nothing ever came of it, but they seemed for the idea. Makes no sense to get punished for completing the hardest part of the diary. 
---
Keep talking about it and it might be brought up again.
---
Did 85 prayer on iron recently and  didn't want to waste any bones
---
I brought anti fire shield and rock cake. I put myself on arceuus spellbook to teleport to the place just south of the altar (safer than coming from the north). I brought 5-10 good bones (vork/daggonoth/hydra) and the rest normal bones (dragon/wyvern).
---
 I used up the inventory and rock caked down to 1 hp, then stole the wine in the same building to kill me.
---
I also had edgeville respawn so I could quickly bank and get back out there 
---
Competitive skills in f2p like mining shouldn't be attempted until after you reach at least 500 total level. That get's you in a world without bots.
---
What episode of Swampletics is this?
---

If it helps, picturing Robin Williams might help.

Sound advice, thanks
---
We play runescape, none of us have the potential to do anything "useful" with our lives
---
I first saw a whip back in 2005 on a F2P world. It was a few months after Slayer was released so no knew what that it was, let alone F2P plebs like us. When asked about it, the guy said it was a "Sausage Rope" and it was dropped from some kind of new event. Literally everyone was wearing the Rubber Chicken from the Easter event so there was no reason to doubt the guy I mean, given the context it was a consistent story at least. 
---
So for the longest time, me and my friends would follow and make fun of people for wielding whips (or sausage ropes). That lasted for months until one of us became a member and saw a bunch of people with it. 
---
So, congrats for your sausage rope!
---
We are already at a ridiculous level of power. While I don't really want to see any more power creep in pvm, there is still room for better gear. They can just make harder content. The tradeoff, of course, is that every bit of power creep makes older content easier and easier. That said, they can also make harder content and not add universally better gear; niche items just for raids 3 or whatever would be an idea. For example, add a set of armor that has the same stats as current bis gear, but has a special effect within the new area. Gives people new items they can use while avoiding power creep. 
---
On the other hand, they have to be very careful with power creep in pvp, especially for melee (at higher combat) and ranged (at lower combat). Consider every update carefully and separately for pvp. People won't really quit over hitting too high in pvm, but they will for pvp, like many did pre-eoc.
---
I'd suggest gaining slayer levels and doing gargoyles maybe? 
---
Depends on how lucky you get with tasks. Slayer isn't ever 'Xgp per hour'
---
It’s more so task dependent than level!

Also start the Fighter Torso grind! It really helps if you need to save some money to level something else. 
---
(My suggestion is leveling Construction when you're able to, having most teleports available from a single Home Teleport Tab helps a LOT on questing).
---
But you don’t necessarily need to be on a task to kill a certain monster do you? Just the slayer level to actually be able to kill it isn’t it?

Settled on YouTube recently maxed him UIM. He decided to up the ante and have a morytania locked UIM. That is a lot of hype for the series at the moment.

Honestly any country thinking they're prepared against the current state of the US military is a pretty big joke.

People keep repolling stuff like Protect from magic not affecting Bind spells, F2P teleblock, they recently polled giving blessed d hide to Pures.

Basically they want it to be easier to kill people, PvPers want it, PvMers obviously dont, and PvMers outnumber PvPers at the polls

I'm not really sure what you could be doing besides just not attacking as often as you can? When are you switching off from ruby dragon bolts to diamond dragon? I have 95 range but no ward, otherwise I'm in the exact same gear as you and I probably average closer to 2 minutes. I usually get 5-6 kills off of 2 doses of extended super antifire. which lasts 12 minutes. I don't woox walk the poison phase, I just dodge fireballs. Are you getting 6 attacks in per rotation?
---
QoL has been presented as "Doing all the stuff we don't have time to do during the rest of the year, when we're making new content"

I'm so very down. One of our old members is a streamer now and I still talk to a chunk of guys. That would be a blast.

I dont think anybody is saying Will Smith is garbage, but this was originally a Robin Williams role and Will Smith really can't match that energy and for a lot of people out there, he may not do it justice.
---
Not even that he has be like Rob since this is a reboot but they could have made a better choice. A lot of people say Terry Crews, not sure why but I could definitely see him doing great at that role. But god.... The effects they used for genie are complete ass. Should have just given him a genie outfit and made a CGI smokey tail for legs

Adding to this the fact it's easier to get master clues than elites...
---
&gt; I have tried multiple times to recover it with Runescape's useless recover system, but I don't have enough information I guess
---
Well, which one is it?
---
If you do not provide Jagex with enough correct information, then their recovery system does its job, right? It would be useless if Jagex gave your account to basically anyone. Which kinda happens sometimes to people whose details are compromised. 
---
&gt; The first password(s) on this account.
---
This should get you past their automatic check. If you do not get an instant reply back, then you're pretty close. 
---
&gt; I'm the owner of the email the account is created on and I can access it.
---
Access to a previous registered email is unfortunately not all that relevant. You should definitely mention the email address in the extra information section, if you didn't already mention it as your payment email. 
---
&gt; I got Facebook messages from the guy who scammed me for my account. In the messages he wrote the email which the account is on now.
---
Ehhm, what? This confuses me. Are you saying that you've shared or sold the account?
---
Jagex can and will not take any external sources as evidence. After all, they can not validate any of it.
---
&gt; I always bought members with bonds, so I don't have any membership details.
---
You should be able to remember the subscription date. There should also be the payment method. The only thing you don't have is the transaction id.
---
&gt; I can't exactly remember what day I created it, but I can be close.
---
The exact day doesn't matter, as long as the year and month is correct.
---
&gt;  They could ask the guy using my account any of these things and he wouldn't be able to answer them, but their recover system is so useless.
---
At best they'll lock the account, after which he'll just unlock it by email or probably manage to recover it through the recovery form. 
---
I've also seen comments where they suggest you to contact Jagex on Twitter. This isn't all that helpful. All they're able to do there is redirect you to their [support page](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb). They're unable to verify your identity as the account owner on Twitter and other social media platforms.
---
I'm sure it's possible with less and some good rng, but I'd say 80 range at least for dragon slayer 2, with good gear. The final boss has a lot of mechanics you can avoid, but ultimately you're still going to take damage and you'll run out of food if you don't kill him quickly enough. 
---
All the others are cake in comparison. Monkey madness 2 the final boss can be safespotted for first 2 phases and the demonic gorillas can be safespotted as well and an npc will mostly kill them. Monkey madness 1 boss can be safespotted in a similar fashion and the gnomes will kill him and you just have to last hit. 
---
Desert treasure is pretty easy with protect prayers as well. I'd say dragon slayer 2 is your only real roadblock.

If only necroing old threads would make retards like you woke when u type something that ironic

---
Depending on your range level, but at 95 range with elite void, dragon hunter crossbow, salve (ei), I can hit like an 80 with diamond bolt e spec. I usually switch off at about 50% hp because ruby max hit starts to be lower. 
---
Lmao. 
---
I hate quests like that. Like Frem trials etc 
---
No problem my man, I found it just easier to do all brews as well lol 
---
I totally agree with you, but the comment didn't sound too sarcastic to me lol
---
I mean protect from magic shouldn't affect snare and I played f2p before. They really need the at the least man.. pvpers want PvP to be possible. The wild high rsk pvm if u aren't read for a fight why go? I've been to the wild a few times. Green dragons were how I paid my members for a spell. The wild ditch change seems shitty but the other stuff doesn't sound so bad. Idk about blessed s hide for pures though. We need something for low/med level accounts(pvm) to be able to.defend against pures i think. Maybe we should add/rework an armour set to deal with range pures and a separate for mage pure for Combat Level 60-70ish.. but idk.what could be done with hitting power creep like all hell :/ 
---
Too used to easyscape clients that the vanilla experience is too hard, huh?

just make a plug in that marks all tiles xd

Very cool!

Get 75 for blowpipe. Everything up to Jad is a joke, though if you have low defence and get a bad spawn on wave 60 you might have a little trouble (having to run through the 180’s to get to the 90’s).

---
Is it not a bird bath? It's in the garden
---
everytime I watch this scene I see the bullets bounce off of Jack's hand and its ruins it. smh.
---
Don't think dynamic examine text for the rune pouch is possible. They've said time and again that having multiple examines for the same item isn't possible with the current engine.
---
Also, they have mention that changing the dots to commas everywhere in the code would take a few hours for very very little benefit.
---
Thought it was very obvious that it would be a requirement but maybe it wasnt made clear so yeah.
---
Sorry.
---
Yeah jagex sorry my cat walked on my keyboard and typed out some inappropriate comments. Please unmute me thnx

Yeah just Photoshop man, simple filter &amp; some colour/level changes, nothing special

But why

That’s not even close to turning the game into rs4. Considering the amount of players rs3 has compared to us, that sheer amount of numbers against eoc.. why am I even replying to your ignorant ass.
---
Yes, that's the whole joke of the character. 
---
That's when constantly paying attention and changing mining spots even if you mine the vein in 3 ticks. At that point Volcanic Mine is way more afk with better rates

Can you mark tiles on runelite if so how

The fact that they are in the wildy is what makes them challenging and interesting. High risk, high reward.

I've yet to come across someone talking smack about fire capes without having one though hahaha

He didn't say or imply that

More money and points per task but less money and points per hour so this is kinda irrelevant

If anything needs to be redone it's the rare drop table being a bad thing to roll. It should have some decent items on it, rather than the current trash it does.

For the wizard all u need to do is pray mage, use a range weapon and walk far enough so that he can't melee u (he has a pretty short wonder range)
---
Do you have Oracle Java? That looks like the icon for Open Java which may be part of the issue.  I believe runelite has jre packaged into it which explains why it's working fine.
---
? I've done 120 elites now and barely made any money of it.

Oh this is even worse than forgetting to put enough scales in your BP if you’re a noob like me and need that OP range weapon

It's inconsistent how they have a specific unlock to block them, rather than what exists for other creatures which have unlocks to unlock them.

Yea way more relaxed

Here's a quick guide. 
---
1) afk to Max combat in nmz while u sex ur wife
---
2) buy 200m osrs gp you earned in 2 days
---
3) buy Max gear -tbow (optional, you earn it in a week or 2)
---
4) stand in the middle of the cave with blowpipe on
---
5) sex ur wife untill u are at wave 60 (rly afk with maxcombat and gear, maybe u can lick pussy with phone between her legs or something, I'm sure u can figure something out)
---
6) when u get to wave 60, stop sexing ur wife for 30 minutes and get cape 
---
7) send me footage of the whole setup including ur wife to prove I'm a genius even tho I already know I am 
---
The best top I have that helped me was very simple. Just stay calm! It may take a few tries, just remember it’s not a big deal it’s not difficult just focus on only important details. Just stay calm, focus on prayer, let auto retaliate do the rest.

Seeing as runescape used to be more survival than the shitty teleport/loot simulator its become, it made sense at first

Thank god you covered up your run energy, I've got no idea who you are now.
---
You harassing me doesn't remove the issue. On the other hand this is the kind of toxicity that the current way wilderness clues encourage.
---
they don't really drop anything and they just kinda suck for the time investment, when I have a DHCB or DHL I do them but if I haven't got I skip.
---
If normal skeletal wyverns didnt have such op tasks people would complain about them to.

part of the problem is if you never unlock fossil island you dont have to pay any points to block the task.

And they have runecrafting

Castle Wars is a red vs blue game of capture the flag. It is both f2p and p2p in ORSR.

Soul Wars I think is also red vs blue, and you defeat an enemy boss or pvp in the middle of the map. That is not in OSRS.

It’s mostly the competitive side. It’s cool to fight in game AI and all, but there’s something really satisfying about knowing you just beat another player - especially if they’re good. 
---
As far as toxicity goes, this subreddit does not cater to PKers that much. There are a lot more people into PvM on this thread than PvP. Just look at how many “omg I got loot in early KC on this boss” posts there are. Reddit and it’s abundant opinions highlights a pretty hard rift between PvM only and PvP only players. 
---
Most dudes I’ve Pk’d with aren’t that bad. If you get killed, they’ll talk shit to you even if you’re in no gear doing a clue, but it’s just banter. Too many people take getting killed personally around here I think. 
---
Why even have them in the wilderness??
---
How greedy are you?
---
A week ago on here there was a guy who put a big thread up about how killing clue hunters brings in a minimum of like 70k or more.

Expert mining gloves are the main driver of this decrease in price. Power mining Iron ore is the best way to get minerals and there is a 3 spot iron ore spot right next to a deposite box in the mining guild. Check it out and you'll see what I mean. A geater supply of Iron ore will cause the decrease in price.

The other one, Hot Stuff. When you get assigned it you're given the option to do Jad or just X amount of tzhaars.
---
Just FYI, if you get the task and don't feel like doing either, take the Jad task and enter the cave and leave straight away. It'll count as failing the task and can get a new one, but doesn't ruin your streak so is essentially a free skip.

Do you use a 3rd party client? Sounds like something in your settings should be turned off.

Essentially you're asking for the OSRS client to understand that when a second device tries to log into an account, that the OSRS client will prioritize the device logging on. Even if you end up having a 'your devices' like application added into OSRS it seems very minute. I mean I can technically log into my account like you're asking if I remember to check the world I'm in and then just close down the client without logging and loading into the correct world on the mobile client.   
---
Basically what you want already exists.

I find that any high level slayer monster benefits from offensive prayers. If you're killing shamans you can probably afford p pots and at the end of the day the faster kills are worth it.

Check out the Old School clans section of the forums, you can search/browse clans there
---
Slayer is like a bad RPG's *"Go kill X"* string of quests. All the items you get from it exist for the sole purpose of killing monsters even faster.
---
I'd much rather have one long interesting fight than fighting 700 creatures that are already easy to kill.
---
If he is a better pker than they are then he is giving them an advantage (who keeps loot? Is it considered rwt?)
---
This thread is getting to technical, if the thread wasnt even created no one would even know about someone else getting the fire cape on said account. 
---
Only thing jagex could say is location of ip address which by itself really isnt proof at all. 
---
Interesting, thanks for that.
---
Runelite? 
---
Depends on task imo. Are you praying for the task or just tanking hits? For pray tasks I wear prossy (only 42 def) and for tank task I wear rune legs.
---
I had my first after 800
---
lol you'd run out of tiles by 200 total or something
---
How are you going to check if you're done marking all possible tiles?
---
Pic literally shows the hammer tho
---
Y
---
The whole point is that it’s a polished smooth transition. I believe it would be well received 
---
I like the idea but this would lock you out of too much content. You'd never be able to train fishing/mining/etcbor bankstanding skills past a few levels.
---
But maybe only walk on marked tiles and only allow x number of new tiles to be marked every hour/day/total level?
---
I don't know if I could get behind a sink. Maybe a shower though
---
No skull?
---
Spiky ponytail too
---
Cool, and you'll get called it for lying in your title
---
55 prayer and piety :thinking:
---
lol at the people ITT that don't understand the Swampletics hype because they haven't seen the series yet.
---
Definitely not just a windows feature as I use it on my Mac all the time. 
---
Players did PvM back then; there was just less of it to do since only a couple bosses. It was mostly training on Giants, which Slayer sought to change. But I do agree original Slayer was good and while it had room to be polished, I kinda prefer it to current Slayer.
---
The "didn't need to exist" was more meant as "it didn't need to be a skill" in the same way a lot of new skill ideas are met with "put it in existing skills" or "make it a minigame/non-skill system". Slayer was literally a skill to do what players already did so it was very redundant, but it grew into one of the most popular skills and it would be hard to imagine all of its current content in anything but a skill.
---
You have to play regularly to keep up with bonds at a low level. If you want to take a break at all your fucked and have to play f2p with a full bank.
---
Not everyone has 10 hours a day to play, so f2p has plenty of content for them
---
Bonds might be easy if you already have an established account, but for new accounts it's usually alllll their money. Which leads to burnout and no enjoyment, because they have to worry about bonds.
---
I've recently for 2 irl friends to start playing, and that first bond grind on f2p is haaarsh. Then when they finally got into members I had to help them out because they had literally no bank left.
---
This then stunts their account growth. the money going into bonds could be used to further their account faster.
---
Yes but the part that every level needs more and more experience. Dumbass
---
How tho? Mine a rock for however long then can't touch it again?
---
That is the thing since they are consumables the cannon ball price remains pretty solid
---
Slippers lol
---
Support
---
wOll smOth
---
Jeeeze i feel like burtals should be behind the 'disregard my combat level' option
---
Flip. I've been playing around 2 months maybe 20 minutes a day, around 200 total level and I've build up around 97mill so far flipping. It's the only real way to make money as its exponential, everything else is linear. 
---
there is no alternate playstyle, there is just no content
---
People don't say sim push. They say scim push.

I dont get it
---
As someone who does both, you're completely correct on the whole  although there is exceptions, some real try hards in the pk community and some pvmers who just do what's most fun regardless of gp/xp per hour. I hope you prepared your cheeks though because you basically just strolled in to the third reich and proclaimed Jews to be the real master race.

Zalcano, which will be included in Song of the Elves. It needs to be polled, but I find it highly unlikely to not pass. Most current details here: https://services.runescape.com/m=news/song-of-the-elves-poll-blog-i?oldschool=1

Later virgins 
---
:D
---
I’m not I’m just getting annoyed with seeing recycled content lol it’s like r/memes is leaking
---
Solid advice if anyone has an account they were on the fence about do it NOW!
---
My apologies for coming off as snappy.
---
I did check my bank for placeholders and found none. I'm certain I haven't claimed rewards earlier.
---
Can just power mine iron to 99 standing in one spot
---
Could we get a "restart" option when entering our bank pin? Currently if you make a mistake you have to close and reopen the interface.
---
I honestly see nothing I would want, but am pretty sure I am mistaking there.. will it be more profitable? I am tired of the same pyrefiend/ice warrior tasks i am getting now anyway lol
---
Use tournament worlds to practice. 
---
50 bots can make cannonballs faster than 50 players can shoot them up though. 
---
I'm not exactly complaining because I spent about 3 hours wrecking some Dags last night myself, but still. 
---
You'd just never leave the tile between rocks 
---
Is it a bad thing though?
---
Legit question, I'm not to familiar with RS3, but I know invention was introduce in hope to fix the economy and created a item/gold sink. OSRS might not need it as much since we don't have MTX pumping colossal amount of resources in the game, but they are still starting to pill up from bossing and slayer. 
---
Mate there's an UIM who restricts his play area to Morytania exclusively. If that can be an alternate playstyle so can F2P lol
---
There are plenty of spots in between 3 rocks of iron ore which you just mine and drop continously. Really good xp. 
---
Find an iron rock spot that has 3 and stand in the middle. Ardy and the mining guild come to mind 
---
Hunting is just land Fishing
---
Rune kite?! 
---
Scamming shouldn’t be against the rules. 
---
Are you going to let them suck you so they let you carry on or are you going to work in the mine?
---
Some kind of shuffle option on the in-game music player would be really cool
---
I did the easy and medium varrock diaries, to make a free 25/50k a day respectively. After completing easy, you can buy 15 staves for 7k each and sell for ~8.2k. Once you do medium, you can buy 30. I also just got my farming up to 32 and started farming ranarr herbs. I buy 4 ranarr seeds for ~120k, and sell the herbs for 220-250k, depending on my luck with how many I harvest. It takes 90 minutes of growing time, but only ~10 minutes of active time to hit the four patches I use.
---
However, you might need to do a few quests first - specifically Fairy Tale, to get access to the rings.
---
What level are your skills, and what major quests have you done?
---
Looking fly af &gt; stats &amp; efficiency
---
I'd swap to Konar at 75cmb since she gives the most points (other than Wildy Slayer), and you can get Brimstone Keys for extra lootz.
---
At 85cmb you could use Nieve if you want, which is personally who I used until 100cmb. Nieve's tasks will be better xp/hr on average than Konar's tasks. 
---
But if you're poor and building up a cash stack Konar is a really good option for a while. Duradel is definitely the best Slayer master overall though.
---
that might even be more impressive at 80 fm lol
---
Just stop
---
At the very least of you not ready to do NMZ sand crabs are way better and give at least 9-10min afk and you can get 90k/hr easy. 
---
Oh for sure, I’m not saying that pking is not profitable. I just wanted to emphasize that even when it seems like the pker is getting nothing out of killing a player (no loot), they can still be having fun
---
Red Bubble will have what youre looking for. 
---
I got a nice grey slim fit tee from there, with a little jmod crown on the left breast. Pretty gppd quality and it arrived fast!
---
when was it ever about survival. Even when I played back in like 2005 it was just a teleporting/loot simulator.

I mean... People do this without making youtube videos.
---
sure he's making money, but i'm pretty sure he'd do it if he made $0. 
---
It's about the challenge, he has to be creative and test his game knowledge. That's the thing with rs. If you're constantly challenging yourself, soon the game stops being challenging(everything in this game is easy with practice).
---
 He just wants a challenge, don't see what's so weird about that... The level of challenge he's at is kinda ridiculous tho lol
---
You can squeeze my rat any day.

This thread started out with 100% upvoted at like 10 points. As soon as pvmers get a whiff they come in to downvote brigade.

What's the best way to alch while doing Agility rooftops? Can items be noted? Which is best to buy in bulk? 
---
Sure my man, I remember using that comeback when I was in primary school. Good job

Maybe risk fighters but not normal wildy pkers. Normal people just don't risk enough for this to be the case.

Ever mass alched? You are a very focused player, my friend. Props to you.

Agreed. Too much boring down time in Cox for me, it would've been much better with supply chests and a point system like ToB.

I have max and champion's cape, and have met several other maxed champions too.

make fire, cook food, kill more cows.

Barrows gloves and konar slayer will get you going in the right direction.

One of my friends got to 700+ kc without his ring only killing Rex. Think he got quite a few Magic lvls out of that one :p

Whats wrong with sushi?

Think it's like the fourth or fifth time I've seen it.

ONLY 145 more to go.

It's because you dont have game sounds disabled that's why I mean who has them enabled anyway

Feels bad man, when I posted this it only got 1.5k upvotes :/

Really you think so? I feel like people dont see the tbow as balanced , and I'm sure through the entire history of runescape most people have found content they like more.

If you have the wrong prayer, you dead.

Im sickend yet curious.

Give the increased time and difficulty they're not worth doing though. Elites are trash.

Agreed, I’m not saying all pkers aren’t efficient and all pvmers are because that’s a gross overstatement. However, I find it ironic that a lot of the people who complain about the game feeling like it’s efficiencyscape are also the ones who complain about being pked by people who are playing to have fun 
---
With 3 C's my guy
---
Trueeeee

Makes sense, thank you.
---
i don't remember that place looking so good
---
True, but it's used in less places and is weaker overall.
---
What she gonna do? Throw a bomb at them?
---
Firemaking just needs more content so that logs are just a training method but not the core content. I've had a few thoughts:
---
  
---
Wieldable torches for skilling benefits or maybe the odd combat passive effect. As well as light source.
---
Burning down crops for fertilization.
---
Loading ranges with different logs for decreased chance of burning.
---
Tie in with construction for different incense effects and maybe starting your own furnace or different ranges in your home.
---
Yeah I put them in a note and at the bottom of my inventory 
---
I love the line straight down the middle of your hp
---
Stupid games win stupid prizes, as they say

I feel stupid, I did just get 99 Strength that's what did it.

Sometimes I wonder if the "I got hacked" posts are even real or just scams... I've seen really nice ppl on here help ppl get their 100m+ banks back. Curious if some of the recent hacked posts are trying to get some of that action.... Hopefully not!

Hopefully your technical issues get sorted out brother!

Excellent post, take my upvote and my prayer that the mods see this

Why the fuck are you alching digsite pendants en masse anyway

Never. It's never going to stop.

It's obviously a beanie
---
Calm down, Hitler
---
The vanilla client, osbuddy, and RuneLite are all equally good clients.
---
I really enjoy defender a lot. It's very satisfying to get those multi kills and lure the healers correctly. You just need the healer to call quickly for you. 
---
I can understand what you mean about collector on a slow team. But if you play on a team that finishes 1-10 in less than 14 minutes, collector is just as busy as the other roles. You need to collect fast and convert reds to help the healer ASAP. I think it's very enjoyable. 
---
I've been playing BA since 2007, but I'm far from mastering the game. I just got to keep practicing. 
---
Will it be effective to goblins in lumbridge though ? Having difficult time killing them.
---
It sounds like you're not having fun with the game and you're assuming everyone else feels the same way. People are efficient nowadays because they're not retarded kids exploring the game for the first time. Efficiency is fun for a lot of people because it is cool to see how much progress you can squeeze into your limited time playing the game. 
---
You think if you walked up to your kid self and taught that dumbass how to make millions of gold or how to get a 99 easily he wouldn't have done the same you're doing now? I spent months mining iron ore in the dwarven mine just to be able to afford my rune armor back in 2004, I bought all kinds of guides on eBay and even the scholastic published runescape guide just to find a way to progress faster. The difference between you as a kid and you now is that you now understand every single facet of the game now. So no, you're not going to kill that highwayman anymore because you know his entire drop table is a waste of time, and you're never going to get that back.
---
The same thing goes for PKers too. You don't need to tell us you're not a pker for it to be completely apparent. PKing has changed completely since the old days. You think 1-ticking a granite maul+AGS spec was something you saw back then? People don't even eat food in the same way they used to. Back in the day you'd dump four DDS specs into some poor shmuck back to back and hope his sharks didn't outheal your damage. Now PKing is all about efficiency as well in its own way, just because you're ignorant of that fact doesn't make it untrue.
---
Well, it depends on the risk.
---
“Supperior”
---
Tbh I thought the image was going to be Swampletics. 
---
Prefer before
---
What's that? I can't hear you over the sound of the runecraft/agility/crafting/smithing/stupidfuckingminigame you're not grinding to complete these. 
---
Yeah people keep saying that but i'm not sure how that translates to "every single change ever needs to be polled".
---
Polling whether or not they should change the guide icons is ridiculous, anyone voting no is just a spiteful asshole. Same with spellbook icon sizes, the female helmet change, and basically every change being polled this week. The only two changes this week that should have been polled are the shield and wilderness ditch changes, because those are game changing and worthy of player input. Everything else Jagex should just do and if people are upset about it tough fucking luck, it's good for the game so you'll just have to deal with it.
---
Best part of pking is the grief you know you caused upon people, as you mentioned sometimes you PK bank, but killing people, especially Venezuelans, is extremely relaxing 
---
Prepared to what? Lose? 
---
Old School RuneScape is long dead we have RuneScape 2.9 at the moment.
---
Yeah I did that and it shows it in the right orientation even when I attach it to my post. It wanted to be portrait after I posted it. 
---
Cant change anyones orientation I guess
---
What’s your slayer level? Money starts coming in at higher levels.
---
Wrong, The c in Scazmatar is not silent.
---
Firemaking is a joke, should have been part of Woodcutting since the birth of RS.
---
Will Smith is disliked by Hollywood and that's why he is on YouTube and doing desperate shit like this. 
---
*laughs in israeli* 
---
Harambes for profit tho
---
Nieve is better XP than duradel as far as I know. Duradel is meant mostly for bossing. If you notice most of his highly weighted tasks have boss variants that can be killed. This means more money but less slayer XP per hour. 
---
Right now I use nieve for the first 9 tasks and Duradel for the 10th. I have black demons, elves, and blue dragons blocked. For your level you won't be making a lot of money yet. Abberant spectres and Cave Horrors are alright but not that much money compared to Kurasks at 70, Wyverns at 72, Gargs and 75, and Brutal Blacks at 77. The highest xp/hour tasks are trolls and suqahs as far as I know, but only if you have the money to cannon them. 
---
Is it possible for Jagex to make a runelite type of client for runescape that then become the standard client where they can add all these things?
---
It was on a menu lol
---
I'd like to hear your opinion on why it's a stupid idea. Is it unfathomable to accidentally alch something important?
---
I'd like to think of you as someone with a hint of maturity and sense, but it's not really happening at the moment. 
---
He's just telling him why he'll never amount to anything and why he's so much better, then he'll grab his dick then offer him a hand shake. 
---
It's simple. They'd play due to being addicted to it (which is extremely common for this game).
---
Also, this is a random thought/opinion he is not trying to pass it off as fact..
---
Yes! currently there are 44 possible seeds from master farmers, inventories fill up so fast!
---
but you used it just now so I guess you are 10
---
Absolutely, This is a great way to make enough cash to get through the toll
---
Ctrl+prntmenu
---
I agree with most of these. Nice little updates that are actually QoL and generally improve the game without harming anyone in the process. Good post!
---
Now go and get it **TWICE** ;)
---
i don't believe all of them are, just the decorative armour, hoods cloaks and flags.
---
why don't you just log into a f2p world and see lol
---
Just wear black d'hide and pray melee. ez pz.
---
Plz get a big group there. I’d love to see the reaction when he checks his bot
---
and you dont even get penalized for dying unlike in rs3 where your account gets locked
---
A 3rd party client should not be required in order to pickpocket an NPC effectively.
---
It wouldnt remove money from the economy, it would just prevent people from introducing more by alching. To remove money it would have to involve direct GP loss such as with constructions processing of logs to planks.
---
Go away troll, you're part of the disease. 
---
Call a doctor, your penis looks really weird.
---
I don't get why people associate lack of efficiency with enjoyment. When I was 10, I had the most fun exploring, so I did that. Now, I have the most fun getting levels, so I do that. I don't think there's a right or wrong way to play.
---
You’re arguing semantics. We have the largest navy, the largest air force, and more occupied land than the top ten other countries combined. I don’t care if the Chinese fuck like rabbits, we are the biggest, baddest, and best-est. And with a username like that I hope you’re in the navy or air force with the other socially retarded pussies. 
---
we can also make it medium morytania diary reward for ectophial (E) that always stay full. 
---
Not true.
---
Bonds are only 3m, you can get that in a WEEK with farm runs and other AFK/passive money making method. 
---
You do not have to be rich or have max gear, OP please do not listen to him.
---
Cutest bank I’ve ever seen
---
lel agi, rc, mine were my first 3 99s
---
You’ll be 10% of the way to 99 at level 75.
---
I guess my problem with defender probably comes down to the no clear feel of how far you can really lure. I mean it says how far but does it include diagonals as 1 or 2 tiles, does it work around the corners of the platforms, etc. I generally enjoy healer or attacker the most except for when you get those random groups with the level 40 with like 30hp because they quested their melee stats up bitching that they are dying but refuse to be anything but attacker
---
There is plenty of hate towards PVPers in the comments on here anytime there are polls running.
---
Yea we need a ton more gold sinks in the game imo, just add a tiny fee to all the little stuff in the game like decanting potions etc.
---
Yeah well. It’s kind of grandfathered in at this point...
---
14k scales in 66 kills...? Are you sure that loot is from 66 kills? 🤷‍♂️
---
Ah, okay. My mistake. Thanks for the correction!
---
It just takes time and practise like anything else, I've had bad flips too and they were all very useful learning experiences as what not to do in future. I have some basic rules I follow such as not putting all my eggs into one basket, not to flip something that is crashing in price, to look for safe flips especially things that have worked for me in past over looking for big greedy flips in (although I will try to capitalise on such opportunities if it arises and if I lose well at least I will learn something). Flipping has never been easier with sites like G.E tracker. I've only been playing runescape for 2 months so I'm not some amazing merchanter, it really is easy.
---
i had no idea you were being serious lol. it's cool, if there was any widespread doubt it could easily be proven wrong by simply adding me in-game anyway
---
It’s a plug-in for runelite
---
Ornate pool and unlimited teles anywhere and jewelry box/fairy ring are invaluable.
---
I just want an exciting skill. Warding is nothing new. Which is the point of it I know but I really wonder if Sailing would pass if it were sold today. 
---
Also a complete rework of firemaking would be great imo. 
---
I think it's largest by numbers of tanks, aircraft, war ships and the like. Not people.
---
agreed but since they will most likely not be making this change, you should know that the option does exist.
---
Lmao I'll remember for next time thanks
---
JUST STOP POLLING. Developers should make the decisions not moron players.
---
Don’t worry your mom and her hairy, shit-stained asshole will be there waiting for you. 
---
I can’t think of anything else people really killed besides fire and hill giants back then haha. Maybe experiments if you were a pure after that quest was out. At this point slayer is more used as a means of preventing farming of bosses for gold and such since mostly legit players can really only kill hydra for example. 
---
You thought being a virgin was bad, now get ready for IRONVIRGIN
---
Garb is my new favorite player.
---
The only things that aren't to be polled are bug fixes and game integrity changes. This was specified in the creation poll.
---
It's a very tough situation as the whole thing with osrs is that it supposed to be "community driven". It a game by the community for the community.
---
However, at what point do we step back and say the community doesn't have it's own best interest at heart? Once you stop polling certain things and start making exceptions it becomes a slippery slope.
---
Nope. 3t4g is far better than powermining iron. 
---
lol i bet you have a big penis

His goal is to eventually do ToB, that’ll make for interesting and challenging content
---
I want to firebend. 
---
I kill vorkath too but you dont see me shutting all over other people's parades. Some people dont like bossing
---
People with 100m mining do granite (or volcanic mine) and a few MLMers. None of that is static. 
---
I totally get that, but it's just a matter of where we were vs where we are. Now FM is conceptually a joke and us supported only by WT, which is actually kind of a sad minigame since it was once too valuable and still is incredibly valuable to do. Essentially osrs bonfires 
---
Relax dude, pipe down a bit!! I dont wanna do multiple hours grinding skills to just have something locked behind it! Like getting 70 agility for a shortcut and then forced to do hard diaries to unlock the shortcut! Im fine with pushing for elite diaries in the wildy to get noted d bones, thats fine! But other things should not be locked behind diaries! Its stupid! 
---
Yeah, when I first came back I swapped everything from RS3. Had a red h'ween from back in the day.
---
I had a fair amount of cash even though I was less than 1k total.
---
So from what I’ve seen these keys are 100k average. Eh. Fine for a 75cb slayer master i suppose.
---
I was memeing my man
---
The only consistent way of training crafting somewhat efficiently for btws is collecting sand and making glass. Except to get sand you either world hop and buy from the shop, or collect manually at an abysmally slow rate in yanille, netting you ~10k crafting xp/hr

Could you imagine if that was true? My God. What RC level did you end up with?
---
It is a common thing people do. It helps later in the game when doing slayer tasks that fill up your inventory but still want to get drops. People call them "runners" who run supplies to others during slayer tasks if more potions are needed.
---
Haha I wasn’t in the air force or navy that’s for damn sure!
---
Sameeee! Me and my friends thought that's what Hero meant on the guide.
---
We even had stuff that that we assumed had to have been stolen by other players because we couldn't find it.
---
Gratz:)
---
In a more serious note, 1m gp will get you from 1 to 38 with potted plants on a helm man, so 12m would get you to 63 off potted plants and also get you to 63 farming :)
---
It would be 12,000 plants and would likely take you like 15 hours to plant, but yeah.
---
I hate the argument "Dont do X, you're better off farming zulrah/vorkath". If you have that mindset you're better off working a job.
---
Huh, so thats how it never runs out. Birds keep pooping in it

I like rs3 it increases health for a little while

I'll add you for sure! This is so random how this all got posted haha
---
Sounds alot like The Arc and Ports in RS3.
---
mein Gott 
---
Yeah, thats the point im making! Locking shortcuts behind diaries are stupid! Because usually requires high agility and usually other skills such as mining or smithing to high levels to also complete the diaries to unlock the shortcut, sometimes fighting bosses for many times on end to get a drop!
---
I think since FM has the highest xp/hr at the lowest gp/hr conversion and is the most shallow skill in the game that is reasonable to argue that it shouldnt, even if it makes you cry big time.
---
Kill it

ill have to do quests eventually. but i certainly dont plan on training on this account more than necessary

You've clearly made up your mind. People in here have quoted the rules to you, they've further quoted specific mod threads and statements. They've done all they can and its up to you to decide from now how you want to play it chap, you know the rules.
---
You literally crowd sourced an issue you could have solved via google, and then when people help you out you aren't happy with their response? Why don't you try tweeting a Jmod and see if they are as helpful.
---
You lazy schmuck.
---
Yea they definitely did not think that one through when they made it
---
Obsidian sword as long as you have Berserker Necklace too
---
That actually sounds like a lot of fun
---
Land on an island and have nothing with you except a shipwreck. Gather supplies using all of your skills and then you can rebuild the ship and sail to another island.
---
Maybe it could include construction as well to build up the islands and have a couple that act as hubs. It sounds like the islands thing in rs3 but maybe not with some of the grinds and general uselessness. 
---
Usually when someone says they are dry without specifying kc, it means that they have exceeded the droprate, but I have never seen the droprate subtracted from the kc when someone says they are X dry.
---
Don’t act like you’ve never done it before. 
---
Haha cheers man
---
In 2007 KQ &amp; Barrows were superior bosses, slayer had superior money per hour with people printing gp from abyssal demons.
---
I feel like these guy would have gotten banned by now if they were bots. They have been posted numerous times and the axe would've dropped on them by now. 
---
Maybe someone just actually runs that many alts...
---
Cooking takes 1 day... literally 1 day of playing and is much better then fletching or FM. And fletching can be done in 1 evening no problem
---
Just newer players who don't know/care about optimal setups.
---
Infernal axe isn't tradeable either
---
yeah i could tell your ASVAB wasnt high enough sorry 
---
His latest one I think 
---
I have not seen any issues with this before. What I would recommend would be to find the install path for the client you are using and clear the cache. It could be an issue with previous updates or something got corrupted in your files. 
---
OP’s silence is deafening... RIP account
---
Its because on the Q&amp;As, they talk about nerfing NMZ pretty frequently
---
tilemanmode
---
With all of dicerz ideas I’m not surprised 
---
When we repolling hiding poll results?
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
will slings be added to osrs?
---
can we rebalance maces, shortswords, battleaxes, warhammers to be more viable?
---
will fletching be f2p?
---
The stone is, which makes the axe. 1.6m every 5k logs burned. Adds up especially when only getting half xp.
---
You must have been in a school zone or something. I grew up in a relatively small town where the cops would let kids get away with DUI's and speeding tickets all the time to not mess with their career.  
---
Now i live in a Big City and i go 15 over and don't ever get pulled over. 
---
3 MPH also isn't 1 MPH. Its actually 300% increase over the amount i said 
---
When can we see the authenticator getting a delay on being removed?
---
bronze-rune weaponry is pretty irrelevant. I guess it wouldn't hurt but there's not much to be gained either.
---
They don't really tell us buffs/nerfs are happening, beyond some vague discussion on qa's with no real timeframe or direction. If it's gonna get buffed it'll just happen one Thursday with no warning in all likelihood. 
---
Your mom makes a mean cake.
---
When is the dev blog for the bounty hunter rework coming out?
---
An update that was promised for last December should take priority over updates that were meant for later this year.
---
This question prompted me to do a lot of research and I believe you’re correct. Remove the “almost” which is simply a modifier of the severity of the tense and the sentence would correctly be “It has run out” not “It has ran out”. Therefore, it should indeed be run not ran. 
---
You have 1 + LVL % chance of getting into the inner ring, so at level 1 for the respective skill its a 2% chance to get in and 100% at level 99
---
cool another pointless war that no one wants.
---
Can we have a universal drop table for every npc only containing a drop of 1m coins with a 1/1,000,000 drop rate because why not
---
None of those stat changes will make these items viable over a scimitar for training.
---
Probably execution errors honestly. Just keep practicing and you'll pick up the nuance. 
---
not too late to delete this and repost the link to the rotated picture with that caption.
---
Is there actually talks of a new skill? I've heard of warding/sailing but I didn't think those would ever see the light of day
---
You’ll want to get that up to 65+. You’re already making a bit off money off of it, but it’s not very much hour wise.  
---
Konar might be your best bet now if making money is the goal. On task with her there’s a chance monsters drop brimstone keys which can be used on a chest behind Konar. These will give you some items, random, but they’re more than not worth more than 50k. It’s an added bonus.
---
Idk why they didn’t make the stack look like a key ring instead of a pile of brimstone shit
---
Yes but the DFS is bigger than the regular shield, wouldn't make much sense for the one in the middle be smaller and a different shape
---
&gt; I can barely kill 3 per run 
---
...why? Just mage or range them with an anti-dragon shield and antifire potion. You don't need food or prayer and the kills are quick enough.
---
I remember watching my character like a hawk at those spiders in the stronghold, salmon as food and I’d last hours, but just incase, never risked it
---
During the Q&amp;A from 07/Nov/18, there was discussion about adding a new lecturn to our POH that would be able to make all tablets. Unfortunately, you said it was on backlog because a new UI had to be created. Is there any update to this?
---
Me and my buddy have ran into this quite a few times too, really pisses me off lmao
---
This would be neat if it wasn’t a private server world
---
Regarding the ring of forging being made f2p, what's the reason for Murky Matt enchanting ruby rings when level 3 enchantment is already a f2p spell?
---
it hurts, but sometimes you just gotta let it go when someone tries to argue without having any proof :D. How can you even call it "evidence" lmao?
---
Never
---
I agree but its way too late in the game to change it.
---
Engine work
---
You can use an axe to recharge as well..
---
This is a prime qol month suggestion. It's easy to implement and a no-brainer
---
121 GT score and 119 dlab but ok 👌 
---
So how do you do this anyway? Thinking of training magic next.
---
I probably could, but I'm just gonna leave it. People are having a field day telling me how to rotate pictures lmao
---
Corsair Cove was introduced in December 2017 so “forever” is certainly a stretch here. However, they moved it to make room for Veos to return to Port Sarim in a more prominent location. They justified moving the corsairs out of sarim from a lore stand point because a bunch of criminals wouldn’t want to be posted up in a prominent business port where they can easily be found. 
---
Right now most people just kill things like imps/goblins in GWD to get the 40 KC necessary, there's very little challenge and lots of world hopping to it.
---
What do you think of the idea that gaining access to the boss shouldn't be based on a certain number of kills, but a certain number of damage done to the god's minions?
---
I know it's a very iconic mechanic of the area, but it would greatly increase the variety of the things you can be attacking there if you want to do some bossing, and would also remove a lot of the repetitiveness/world hopping.
---
Does it tell you your account age every time you fire it?
---
Yeah pking on rs3 is realy fun :D
---
Use Ruby bolt(e). You'll kill them pretty fast
---
&gt;Anglo Saxon style
---
That's ***the*** [Sutton Hoo helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Hoo_helmet), owned by [King raedwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A6dwald_of_East_Anglia), who lived from 599 AD to 624 AD.
---
There's only one of them.
---
They confirmed its getting nerfed? 
---
What I like to do when alching is putting in an offer a little lower than normal for some items like bows and such. They don't buy right away but if you have cash to let set in the GE its a good way to break even/make profit. Otherwise if you want to buy them all right away i would recommend buying 1 of items and just comparing the alch price and the price of the runes to make the price null.
---
People would still flick then
---
im here to pee pee
---
I know. I’ve been there. I’m just saying it’s Anglo Saxon not Viking. 
---
Kandarin easy diaries for the win. 
---
&gt; basically no downsides
---
Except you would see all GWD items crash.
---
honestly id kill for a 2011scape to come out so that all the nuscapers would leave 2007scape and we could poll g.e removal =)
---
!&lt;pog&gt;!
---
Cool
---
Yeah they mentioned in a Q&amp;A a while back that they were going to nerf the XP but they were going to have a poll on how big the nerf will be.
---
Is there any hope for damage at Wintertodt being re-scaled away from punishing higher level accounts?
---
Looking back I wish some quests were in the game, but the piece I miss the most is Living Rock Caverns. 
---
Watching lvl 3 bots get smoked by the boss critters roaming around was the best. 
---
Some people literally play RuneScape as a social simulator with minigames 
---
Oh i was under the impression the stone disappeared after it was used up. My bad
---
Suggestion: Slayer only fight cave that uses the inferno's layout and gives more slayer xp.
---
Holy shit it's been a week already...
---
Ya I'm just teasing. I did konar for a while but I'm finally transcending into a proper main, and the task restrictions are no longer fun or novel. 
---
True.
---
Truly enjoying the game is 100% subjective
---
Good thing you got it finished anyway... that quest has always been a major hassle

I would do diaries but med diaries have a much higher skill req, needing me to train. And most easy diaries have a certain task that is out of my ability 
---
(Family crest for fally diary requires 16 CON. And I still need to get 50 kudos but I think I have enough with quests I completed.)
---
The problem is effort, or lack there of. The fact that most people do rooftop course and occasionally something other than MLM shows you that they are pretty OP.
---
The scale isn't always brilliant as you say, but I actually really like the style of the mountains especially 
---
Scammers these days have like 2000 iq, they have like people pretending to talk about bxp, and arouse interest. 
---
They don't wanna talk to you directly, that's too obvious. But if they just type out like this, people may just search it up.
---
Most people don't seem to get this. Its like deep wilderness pkers should just ignore every pvmer for 30 mins and then go die to a clan. 
---
I would like to see you be sufficient at ToB and the Inferno after watching just a guide.
---
When's groot getting his recolors?
---
Beautiful.
---
&gt; Jagex gating important content behind it and being killed without wanting to be there.
---
The D pick is about the only item that fits this bill.  The MAI and MAII are associated around wildy lore and pvp spells.  The other rings no one ever bitches about and other loot from revs, lavas, etc. is just extra content for both groups. 
---
[I’m a Divination Memory Head](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ciyt5sK) sorry for the rs3 reference...
---
The shit graphics are great for nostalgia and all, but it would be nice to have a sliding scale in the options to make things more aesthetic.  
---
Not to the extent of RS3, just a light duty makeover if that makes sense. 
---
Currently there are 44 seeds possible from pickpocketing master farmers. This make inventories fill up very fast and with the addition of new seeds from the kenos update, this has only gotten worse. Could we have dupe seeds go directly into the tithe farm seed box? this would effectively give 32 slots while pickpocketing. A pretty large improvement.
---
Can we look at grotesque gargoyle boss as it currently is one of least popular Slayer bosses to kill. Even though you've lowered it's hit points and added an upgrade to have them count as 2 kills, it doesn't do this so called "mid-tier" boss justice. I suggest increasing the granite dust drop (have it drop in amounts like zulrah scales 100+ each kill) as well as looking at it's drop table.
---
Currently, due to the amount of hit points and attack power of the boss I can barely average 5-6 kills a trip with maxed stats and near maxed gear. Again this is a level 75 Slayer boss..meant for "mid-levels" but I can barely see someone level 80-100 being able kill this boss in a decent manner. It's almost better to just kill the normal ones as it's more ask and provides almost the same profit per hour.
---
Anyone here ever play puzzle pirates? That was a fun game.
---
Hunter and thieving (pre-herbiboar and pyramid plunder) are the worst skills in game, not agility and rc.
---
Could you change it so incase someone leaves a game at barbarian assualt, that we can start the game with just 4 players as opposed to restarting the whole thing. 
---
Are you illiterate lol, your first comment is just bitching about me being maxed and you're getting mad that I called you a retard?
---
Where your rings at
---
I think this perfectly sums it up.  Safe deaths in all of pvm kind of got rid of that thrill of high level pvm.  The wildy doesn't have that safe death and is part of the reason I keep coming back to this game. 
---
Tell the waiter it tastes like something died in your mouth
---
Runescape is locked at 50 FPS max. 
---
The mountains and the River Lum look really cool. Good work
---
I kinda agree with you, but I think results should be hidden until you vote. After you vote in the poll, results should be visible and you should be able to change your vote if you want.
---
Can someone explain why my parents tell me they love me, yet they haven't called me in three weeks?
---
Why would you use earth altar? Fire altar is faster using rings of dueling.
---
Lol I have none. Cant really spare 15m on rings rn 
---
Pretty sure it says in the chat when you lose it.
---
When summoning was around dfs summoning tanks were so much fun to pk on.  Miss those days. 
---
Unlock Ammonite crabs!
---
then its better than whip+d defender+fury?
---
&gt; your right
---
But what about his left?
---
I've never understood the hate I love RC natures and stuff
---
So it sounds like a good skill that would help the economy? Nice!
---
Or were you hoping for the crowd that Reeees at anything related to RS3 despite its quality?
---
You're one dead
---
Sack of meat.
---
my man! love the effort
---
I posted above to keep it out of pvp. But imagine instead of poison or venom having fire damage. 
---
Well it would really depend on how much the price on uniques would jump, I can't really predict it. I just want the uniques + bones and such to be the only things that monsters drop, universally.
---
Because I was already making fire runes (still am) so I don’t need to buy a whole another batch of runes
---
PVM is repetitive and gets boring, as a play style, very quickly. 
---
PKing is the meaning of the game.
---
You also get cooked when hit by a fire spell so you have two things to eat, salmon and yourself
---
To be honest I only see Q&amp;A on the main page nothing alse. 
---
Rhomboids
---
The comments in this thread make me nervous that warding won't pass. I'm excited for a new skill whatever it may be. Sailing sounded fun, especially GentleTractor's version. Warding sounds logical. I've never really heard an argument against it other than "dead content" or "useless skill." Neither of which I consider arguments.
---
OSRS should really be called RS3, since it's just a resurrected version of the original Runescape. And what is now RS3 should just be called Runescape.  Fight me. 
---
yeah I have a tendency to do that as well. on my last couple runs I started saying his attacks out loud before I made a switch to stop this.
---
I have quest cape lol, crabs are max 10 min afk before you have to reset aggro plus they're highly contested and if you afk log someone is gonna take your spot. NMZ is the only place I can afk melees and only click once every 20 min.
---
Only if it also let's us use each color headband as a different special attack to increase the value of my rangers grind
---
the minigame is still relevant for making sacred oil for cremating remains.
---
What's more impressive? You can't just say something is better just because it's more rare than something else or takes more work to get over something else. I could also argue that the normal account is smarter because he wasted less amount of time on a virtual game. The full-fledged accounts didn't waste hours of time doing unfun content just because they had to grind out 75 crafting. Tell me that buying buckets of sand and seaweed is so much fun over and over again!
---
Yeah weird, someone call a reddit scientist
---
For varrock easy or medium diary, can we enter the edge dungeon without having a brass key? 
---
Imagine complaining about having 250m in drops and not even being halfway for pet drop rate. =/
---
i know exactly how it works as an item sink and why it's needed. all i'm saying is that you're incorrect when you claim that warding wouldnt remove money from the economy. warding removes items, and items/gp are exactly the same thing for the reason you stated.
---
Can the spam messages in the chat box when fighting the Alchemical Hydra be toggled off?
---
Particularly the ones from the flame phase. 
---
Been a long time since I played. What's warding again? 
---
Honestly that was a really fun and unique weapon.
---
1. No harm in having it.
---
2. Takes time to travel between the two places. And it's not a official mort'ton teleport item.
---
I’m so pore pls bond me
---
Just realized your name, fucking love it. 
---
Came here to say this
---
Could just make a plugin for it and be done in 3 minutes. There probably already is one in the dev tools to be honest with you 
---
It's an open community, ofc there will be toxic players, and no shit raiding with friends is better, that should not be a surprise.
---
WDR is for primarily for people either learning how to raid, or people who dont have enough high level/interested friends. And the more invested community is actually really nice.
---
I have them unlocked, crabs are max 10 min afk before you have to reset aggro plus they're highly contested and if you afk log someone is gonna take your spot. NMZ is the only place I can afk only click once every 20 min.
---
This hits home except step dad
---
NH mead ftw!
---
Can we take a look at helping Grotesque Guardians out? Possibly making granite dust tradeable or shortening the phase transitions significantly. Its a great boss with a great aesthetic but those little hinderances make it a pain to/not worth doing.
---
I‘s love it, more than 07 even, but yeah it‘s never happening :(
---
NSFW version when?
---
Another swampletics wannabe. It's just boring 
---
You don't even have to wear dhide. I just use melee DPS gear and pray mage and ornate pool after each step. 
---
Yes. Sadly jagex doesn’t care much for pvp and is slowly letting it evaporate. Devs much rather focus on making tbow bp slayer bosses.
---
Combine firemaking and woodcutting, add warding, then skill level tiles don’t have to change 
---
If it fails it fails, live with it
---
what is the total GE value of your PK equipment? ;)

Pencil drawing. It's in a sketchbook so I can't really scan it properly with the materials at hand :P

Art doesn’t always have to have direct meaning. It can sometimes be what you make it, and that’s why art is such a beautiful medium. Take for instance my view on it down below. A lot of brainlets here are having trouble using there noggin to find a meaning, but with my 224 IQ (I’m in Mensa btw btw btw) I can clearly see the true, beautiful meaning behind this amazing work of art. 
---
To op, if you see this I would love to buy a print if this is your work. Pm me and we can work out some details, but I’m looking at paying 4 figures. 5 if you can somehow incorporate some eroticism and Nieve’s [corpse] in it.

Yeah i like my sleepy, striped snake all coiled up like that. Not the ugly abomination to the right.

---
When will Wintertodt  be looked at? 
---
As it stands Wintertodt punishes high leveled accounts while rewarding low level accounts which makes no sense in a survival mini game .
---
For new players: Wintertodt does damage in percentages. This means that someone with 10 hp will get with 1 and 2s while someone higher level will be hit more damage. This means that one cake for a low level account can potentially last 1-2 rounds of Wintertodt saving on inventory making the mini game more afk, cheaper and efficient at lower levels. On the other hand a high level account will take massive damage while playing the mini-game this means we use more inventory space for food because we get hit more  damage and our food is way more expensive resulting in more food used per game/round, less inventory space, and in my opinion making the mini-game super inefficient at high levels.

Any thoughts on bringing Soul Wars to OSRS ?
---
Do people in this subreddit that steal pics ever think “hmm maybe this was posted already”
---
Hasn’t been polled yet
---
(Re-upload, corrected grammar mistakes)
---
With the addition of Ghorrock, Carrallangar and Catherby teleports in our POH, could we ever possibly see some Arceuus teleports make it to our POH?
---
In particular, I was thinking Draynor Manor (Belladonna patch, Ava), West Ardougne (clue hunting) and Harmony Island (Elite Morytana herb patch).
---
If you fear adding it, perhaps add an extra element to be able to put it in our POH? Maybe dark essence blocks, like when you're making the Arceuus teleport tablets?
---
I do understand potential fears of this leading to eventually adding Barrows tele to POH, but I think we could just avoid adding Barrows altogether, while still allowing some of the other useful teleports.
---

Might be one of the best pictures ive seen in a long time. 2005 interface and 1000 plugins covering 90% of the game screen telling you how to play :D

Ive checked every time i died, he doesnt have them, and 60K is twice as expensive as buying them from the actual NPC who sells them.
---
Just so yoy know, that’s a common strategy to boost comments on your posts. 
---
He did that completely intentionally. Notice he made the same mistake in his title and on the IMGUR post? That wasn’t a typo. That was completely intentiona because it gets people to click on the post and comment. 
---
Automation ruining another quality job for the most vulnerable in runescape society. How will our frands in south america make a living now?!!?
---
Repost squad at it again, no one fucking post this in the next 5 mins its my turn.
---
That's who I meant. My mistake. Thanks!
---
You also gotta think that pvper has just grinded that account out to get it to where it can pk. They're done skillin, questin, and pvming on that account possibly.  A lot of pkers no life grind to get the account to where they are want and are kinda bored/burnt out and just want to pk at that point.
---
 I used to use them to cannon dags when I had low defense. 
---
Other than that, they're cheap and people might think they are better since they are tier 70.

---
The community *as a whole* rarely knows what's good for the game in the long run and have significantly hurt or even killed certain aspects of the game thanks to bandwagon-voting against or for content.
---
Don't get me wrong, I quite enjoy the polls and the fact that major changes are decided by the community - but with the poll results not being hidden and people just talking after each other / popular Youtubers I really don't think that the polls as they are should stay. 
---
I feel like this is where we need to see some sort of change in the polling system. Completion of certain quests/content to vote on certain questions. (People with 0kc raids voting on COX changes).
---
Why should players who havn‘t completed DS2 vote in this? I understand that they will eventually reach this content but as of now this is more beneficial and aimed at the players who have killed vorkath/completed DS2.

IMO risk fighting is when both risking more than you normally would (200m+)
---
Don't count on it, the way this game is designed is just asking for bots to exist.
---
Rs3 has less bots because less players are there in general. 
---
&gt; I don't know, maybe bots are a good thing because they do lower resource prices and making skilling cheaper?
---
Bots are not in the game because resources are pricey, they are there because players are just smart enough to relegate certain tasks so they can focus their time on more fun things.

10/10 quality meme
---
I don't see the point in it teleporting you one tile away from the ectofunctus and then pathing you back to the thing so you can refill. I just figured if it dropped us adjacent to it every time then there would be no need for the ectophial to ever empty itself. Would save all of a second. Can see how that might be controversial though.
---
While tribridding is difficult there are other ways to pk.  Tribrids normally pk in specific areas or hunt the entire wild whereas level 1 edge is mostly going to be range to ko melee spec.

you understand.

Get your farming and magic up and go do ranarrs. You'll want 51 (I think) Magic for the Ardougne teleport, and 32 farming for the herbs.

Don't cry faqqot. Your not quite a special snowflake as you think you are.

Not sure if its worth it but check and see if youd profit high alching them after making them, good magix xp and turn a profit.

I think warding has potential. That super long infographic that got posted a few days ago really sold me on it.

I don't even know what that means, but my pb was pretty close to a record and took hella good RNG, so I'm pretty happy about that :)

It's almost like this is a game and not real life and almost all of it is fabricated nonsense :v

Oh shit I just realized this dude is fully maxed. Makes sense. Great time to fuck everybody else over because hey, I can't level up anymore.

your best bet is to go to sharkbrew and join the w308 or sharkbrew discord and find a clan or other people to pk with. 
---
Agree with all of these except for the following:
---
8. Fremmenik boots. As far as I am aware there is no other item that requires you to do an emote before teleporting. If you add this then you would need to add clap before using karamja gloves etc so this doesn't seem feasible.
---
14. House building mode teleport. The spell already has two options and adding a third would make it look cluttered. Also not a fan of misclicking when trying to tele to outside and ending up in the house on building mode.
---
22. Ectophial. The liquid should go somewhere and Jagex already made it so that players can have multiple ectophials which I think solves the issue. Maybe having your character automatically fill it up when you arrive would be better but even then, not sure this is really necessary.
---
Otherwise - fantastic post with lots of great suggestions and I hope to see some in game soon.

You don’t understand that the majority of the player base doesn’t know what’s best for the game. All you have to do is pay 3m to vote, so only having a majority vote would ruin the integrity game. Almost every vote would pass. Why am I even replying to your ignorant ass.
---
Yep. I agree entirely. Just throwing it out to say its not *entirely* obsolete just like 99%.
---
I skip the wyrm tasks
---
Worth it. Got mine on my second clue of the day today, after a 3+ week break because I'd smashed 200 meds in around 2 weeks and hated the game. Good times.
---
I always drop to the bottom of these threads
---
Is this the comment I reply get autism? Someone told me spam city is handing it out.
---
Oof, that's certainly an unpopular opinion
---
Yeah it would make it about a second longer. I don't think it's a big deal (and I use my Frem Boots 4 to farm Vorkath) but I can see how some players would. It was just a thought because the Karamja Gloves make you clap so just thought the boots could perform stomp just for consistency/humour's sake. Not a biggie, more of a personal preference inclusion if anything! 
---
Can we remove the clap animation from the karamja gloves teleports?
---
It wouldn't be op. Would get smited quicker than you can call me a normie.

I did around 200 Zulrah kills this past weekend and died like 10 times in total because of this... not specifically hitting a 41, but being 37 hp etc. 3 of those deaths were at the same exact time I killed Zulrah... I really should just eat

That would probably have been a good idea.

Grow a pair.
---
Lol, you haven't gave an actual reason though. You've said people use them for maxing and getting 200m, and that they are afkable. That's not exactly enough reasoning to warrant a nerf.
---
Ah, the classic Runespan reference. No, that is not my logic, but that is definitely a solid use of a trigger word
---
This plus the time it takes to get 94 mage and high strength.
---
Have they ever had something fail and implement it anyways? 
---
If you're at the level of doing clues where you get Sara wizards attacking you, they should not be a problems lol. Sure they hit like a truck, but slam on piety with a dragon scim and an inventory of food and it's no issue at all.

I'm sure several people have made the plugin for themselves, I thought about doing it since the code is already there from gorillas.

I'm having a hard time understanding how Skeleton Wyverns bots don't get banned. They all have the same armour , same minimal stats needed, all lvl 72 Slayer. It's super fucking obvious they are bots. Ban these fucks during a 30 min lunch break. 
---
I love this
---
I don’t think you’re understanding the issue. The problem isn’t what other people are doing when they play the game. I like to do things not super super efficient, which is fine. You like to do things super efficient; which is also fine. But what isn’t fine is people (generally the super efficient players, it seems) shit talking or making fun of people that don’t play how they want to. 
---
So to answer your question of who is imposing the mindset of being efficient, it’s assholes online that act like it’s the only way to play. And you might say it had no affect on you, but being constantly told you’re playing the game wrong does get tiring, if nothing else. 
---
The game seems dead when you don't go to the grand exchange because no one uses other banks.
---
Me too, I did one task when kebos was released and it was horrible
---
When I first started I didn't understand the weight/run system, so I'd walk around with full armor on. I noticed my friend could run much further than me. He told me it was because he only ate healthy food like cabbages.
---
Don't think so. But i could be wrong.
---
I don't know, literally anything they come up with could work as long as it doesn't conflict with anything. You can't be close minded when adding new things to a game, but people have zero trust in the devs for this game.
---
The problem I have with a new skill is the 100+ hours of brain dead, pointless clicking you’re gonna have to do. It just feels annoying to me. Whatever it is, the game is fine now, it feels like every week is a new update bringing items and land to the game. Don’t get me wrong I love the game but why do we need a new, seemingly meaningless skill. I waste enough time as is.

Tbh my new favorite series is KempQ playing RuneScape properly. I’ve seen so many ironman progress videos it’s nice to see a normal account progress through the game. Seeing how he made money early on by selling random items in the GE while questing was super interesting to me!
---
If a tweak improves gameplay clarity, thematic fit, consistency OR makes something more user-friendly then any of these are considered quality of life. I want to say that 95% of my list are grounded in improving consistency with other items (ie. elite clues behaving like other tiers, teleport text colour), thematic fit (ie. moving Abigalia to the Gypsy tent) or making things more user-friendly (world hopper on minigame tab, backspace-all etc). 
---
85 agility? Thanks for your account bud.
---
Yeah this is why my first suggestion to him was to make a pure. His current account isn't far off from being a 75 atk piety pure if it is quested. He just has to majorly train up range, magic, and prayer. 
---
Yeah that was my issue before I got the hang of it. I watched the legs like a hawk with my finger over the mouse for the other prayer, and flinched and clicked. But realize you have more time than you think. You don't need to swap to range the nanosecond his feet hit the ground. Even if you misclick, you have a tick or two to switch back. 
---
Ok, then make an exception for scam-like begging.
---
Someone asking "Can anyone give me 10k" should absolutely not be banned, muted, or anything like that.

Thanks, I thought that might be the case!

I'm in that boat with you, not a dad but life hitting me real quick where nmz are the only gains I can get rn. I get why they're doing it though, its basically a "get me to end game" button you can press if you have time to run rs while doing other things

I dont see the logic in that. Would make sense if the game stayed static. But it doesn't. New content gets added, opinions change.

Actually really appreciate this post, been afkin NMZ a lot lately to hit 99 for raids, and can't tune in to streams due to work. I'll be getting in as much afk as I can before this nerf goes live.
---
If that's the case (I haven't been around since the first poll) then to go off my original point, they won't put anything in if the community truly doesn't want it, but at the same time, they won't put something in just because the community wants it.
---
Yeah makes sense. I did it once for the diary and cba to go learn it now haha

Using ensouled heads when hydra bones are still 4.6k ea?

The alternative method to making wines is cooking sharks which is profitable so I'm not sure this is a great argument.

It was mentioned on one of the Q&amp;As or a design stream a bit ago, but only in passing.

There's plenty or crossbow options. Nobody uses bows anymore, outside of low level training, PVP, and sometimes skulled revenants. If you don't want to use a blowpipe, you can have an acb, diamond dragon bolts, and twisted buckler. End up with much much higher accuracy.

World hopping is not a valid game mechanic.

---
Depending on scale prices, Zulrah can be substantially more gp per hour. Especially if you run a max efficiency setup, you can consistently do 8-kill average trips and get over 4m/hr when scale prices are &lt;225gp. 
---
As to why do Zulrah over Vork, I'll share my personal opinion:
---
I did a lot of zulrah, then sold my gear and camped Vorkath with dhcb and ward for ~1k kills. Vorkath is mind-numbingly boring. There's almost no variation - just 6 attacks poison, 6 attacks freeze, repeat until dead. For some this is ideal, but I personally hated it. Zulrah you have to pay attention, adapt to specific situations, do 9-way gear switches (if max efficiency), dark-bow spec switch on the last hit of mage phases, speed run kills in order to get 2 kills per antivenom dose, etc. 
---
Some people hate that but it actually makes me feel like I'm playing an exciting game instead of Vorkath's waiting simulator. 
---
What's a hyperbole?
---
None of that means anything if your email is insecure, we don't need more steps, we just need people to use their brain.  No matter how many pointless steps you add, it will never be retard proof.
---
May I ask why would you skip, arent the rewards good?
---
IMO it shouldn't even need a diary. I think this could be acceptable as an upgrade from the square just by having a smithing level of 50 and completion of Dragon Slayer 1. If it were f2p, that would be it. If it were p2p, it'd be a good idea to require a dragon head, dragon bones, and a anti drag potion.
---
i don't actually play rs anymore but i still like to watch torvesta's pvp videos and i noticed that there's generally 2 types of ko in his videos. either lots of little attacks to stack up for high damage, or 1 stronger attack that he would bank on working out. after quite a lot of watching i realized that these 2 styles of ko are not the same in reliability to each other.
---
i figure most pvpers of osrs figure this out by themselves without wondering about it. i did wonder about it though so i whipped up this random data in excel to prove that a greater number of attacks will result in a more reliable combo, but with a lower likelihood of a really huge hit.

did you have a bank pin?

Why do these arguments never include quests?
---
pretty sure thats a friend playing on 6-8 accounts at once still 2 this day

I'm not efficient at all, took me 13 years to get a 99 originally and I started day 1 of osrs and my highest skill is 95 fletching.

I understand what you're going through. This is what Jagex argues.
---
When you have your authenticator on your RS account, each time you log in to a new computer/location, you will be required to enter your code. In this case, if it's a public computer, do NOT check the "remember this device" box.
---
So the only time you will get a notification in your email is if the hacker tries to disable your authenticator. Unless he has access to your email, he won't be able to get in.
---
If you don't have a phone, there are some desktop authenticators out there but I'm not too familiar with them.
---
Holy shit I had the Millennium Falcon one

Except if the loot isn't stackable or sharable
---
Can we address the **Ring of Suffering toggle**. 
---
When toggling other rings like the ROW, it will ask if you want to disable or enable to coin collection (depending on witch setting it is currently on) However the Ring of suffering just says "**Toggle recoil effect**" with no indication. You can only check by using the "Check" option on the ring and reading past the charges left or turning it on/off to see what it was last set as. It would be a nice QOL change to have it instead say "**Toggle recoil effect on / off**" like other ring effects.
---
I love that Godsword blades and repairing dragon armour/barrows armour predate creation of the succulent rune armour on the skill tree
---
How are you supposed to handle the dilemma when a poll about adding a feature to the official client fails, but it's already a part of most 3rd party clients? Prayer rearranging failed for instance, but 3rd party clients have this whether you're in the wildy or not. 
---
Doesn't this undermine the polling system? If it shows that there isn't enough support for this feature, why should it then continue to exist in 3rd party clients in the first place? But in that case, there isn't much to gain for players either if there is a possibility a feature they've used for ages will be removed from them.
---
My best friend is elementary school was a member while I played free to play. He talked about how he had a book that could teleport him anywhere he wanted even above the game. I was so excited for this and when I did get members a few months later, I found out he was so full of bs along with tons of other stuff. Him and I stopped being friends.
---
Yes, but still got through to my bank.
---
Purely out of curiosity, how does the Dense Runestone respawn work? Sometimes it’ll deplete and respawn before I even notice it depleted, other times it’ll deplete and I’ll leave for days and come back and it’ll still be depleted.

Wow. That’s some terrible luck.

75 for blowpipe. Will make it much easier. You can always sell the blowpipe after as well.

Bro why are you so mad? Everything we were talking about is just suggestions, you act like it’s already in the game or in the creator and gonna put it in. Chill out toughest guy on the internet, I get your points but why not try to make bows worth a shit again? Fire could do that. Or as another user suggested flaming swords for melee would be awesome. Why just come in here shooting everything down like some miserable neckbeard who burnt his tongue on a corn dog 
---
MINING BAD

Lol!! 169 whole pounds. Rich kid 
---
OMG if u do that you could use the layout to make an mmorpg, maybe u could call it "runescape"
---
Most bridders use spirit shield so it wouldn’t have any impact on dps whatsoever. I agree with you with it being a risk vs reward thing but most people don’t pk for money they pk for fun and that’s why I even risk when I do it. Something that gives that much reduction is just not good for this game inside pvp IMO. I’m for it in pvm situations just not as an added drop from Corp. maybe something added to the game later that gets attached to ely to create it.
---
I also want to see the extended portion of slayer tasks become optional. 
---
As permanent unlocks, extended tasks shouldn't punish people who feel they have made a mistake in unlocking the extension (eg, dark beasts), or who don't want to stick around for the extra kills. 
---
I propose that there be a message in the chat box saying something like, *"Congratulations, you have completed the minimum number of required kills for this assignment and have received X slayer points. You may continue killing (creature) on task for Y more kills. Slayer point total: Z"* 
---
there was a post stating you could get the Halloween scythe by casting entangle on logs on the ground in a building by the chaos alter in varrock, I leveled up my mage and was left disappointed.
---
The fact that you think account security is fine absolutely baffles me. Clearly you are not playing the same game. Ppl can get around your 2 step Authenticator, that’s not fine.
---
Yeah I'm always running out of those
---
Fire arrows could stack with poison but only start at 2 and then decrease from there, torches could start at 6 but are melee only (off hand)

You're a fucking retard because you're not even arguing against the suggestion. You're only arguing against the suggestion for f2p that, according to you, is so minuscule and irrelevant for f2p players that it shouldn't be implemented. Great argument.
---
And then you demand people to provide you with reasons for it when you're not even offering valid opposition? Hence the "because why the fuck not?"
---
get real bud
---
stay mad lol
---
yeah well i guess my sense of risk is something else then.
---
I assume there are people who misclick. I can see them adding a toggle though the doomsayer though.

No they can't, because I actually have a brain and can use it how it's intended.

After all the hype i decided to watch him, and god damn i get it now.

Okay then if you put it that way, how come the PvP Armors were made but didn’t pass the polls and still were tested in tournament world. If they can do it for them, they can do it for the divine. Remember the Divine is one item, it shouldn’t take long creating. How is it unfair when it will solve the issue if it’s OP or not, to me that seems like the most legitimate and fairest way it can be. It makes no sense for it to be unfair.

Is it possible to take a look at removing the ability to click on other players' box traps or other hunter traps like snares?

It serves no purpose since you can't interact with them anyways but the option still appears as a left click, which covers up other options on or around the tile. This is being used by players to grief hundreds of players in the zmi world to make it hard to click the ladder. It's become a big problem with the same person staying there for days.

nigga you can crop screenshots

Damn you, learn to properly read what they're polling

You're actually delusional. A level 36 hobgoblin will not fuck up a level 126 in max tank gear. 
---
THIS IS NOT A NERF TO THE WILDERNESS. Its not nerfing the drop table, its not nerfing anything. 
---
In fact, its making the wilderness more dangerous by allowing PKers to kill people more easily, the amulet allows for them to not get hit off by monsters. I'm guessing you dont deep wilderness pk. 
---
This is in no way a nerf. Even if it was (which it is not), what are they nerfing? People eating 1 shark? Cmon bro, be realistic. This is intended for people to escape clans, and for clans to kill people easier. 
---
I had the same problem, I had to reduce my resolution from 4k to 1080p and that fixed it.

374 kc with

tail, head, claw, and full ring
---
Maxed stats and max gear with sgs, you should be getting 10+ kills a trip. If you're lucky with food drops you can easily get close to 20 kills. You're not doing it efficiently, by the sounds of it. But it is definitely by all means not a mid tier boss. You need good gear to do it efficiently.
---
god no
---
signal: noise ratio in oshd/rs3 is so fucking awful, major reason why I stopped playing even. just trash to look at
---
Sorry not trying to be aggressive, I've just seen so many "hacked plz halp" that had no wealth worth being targeted over, but denying they could of gotten phised. Maybe I'm just too jaded now

Or one that doesn't want to risk it in the Wild
---
Please tell me how you'd want a new skill to be added, then. Would you expect a multitude of quests to be added at the same time? Multiple activities and mini games being added as well? Those are all outside the immediate domain of a new skill release.
---
/u/redditscientist
---
two upvotes and ill share the shitty montage i made
---
Wow.
---
I think the loss of Ayiza didn’t help
---
Honestly what’s the meta these days on GCJ?
---
Couldn’t agree more. Zulrah is actually fun. 
---
Dude..
---
I've had plenty of chats while skilling, seems like the things you value have just changed
---
Went on their sub reddit earlier, dunno why.
---
Came across a post literally saying "The wildy is dead because it's still a PvP area, you could fit so much content in it if PvP was removed"
---
Obviously it's a different game and that may be the case but.. god damn it's sad.
---
this is good
---
If you get 88% I believe you get max runes, and no boltracks.
---
If you get 100% you can get boltracks as a reward which are generally less valuable than getting max runes.
---
I could be mistaken but I’m fairly certain that’s why it shows 88% as green
---
&gt;If that’s how u wanna play go for it
---
Doing slayer while studying is so much more annoying than doing nmz. That's the only reason I camp it 
---
Upgrade the random event shooter shoulder cannon thing to shoot these. 15 rounds/second seems reasonable 
---
Ideally you want to get around 81%, so kill all brothers, two skeles, and a blood worm IIRC. OS.rs.wiki has a section on the barrows page about optimal percentages and what combo of crypt trash to kill. 
---
Logically the character would arc towards the sky in the middle of the jump, not get closer to the ground.. just something that really bothered me spending a couple of hours here
---
Damn this is a dumb thing to comment 
---
Repost
---
I never understood why firemaking made it into a skill, what's the point of it, why is it worth my time besides some mandatory requirements for quests/diaries?
---
keep stuffing your face, youre almost there
---
Chand cannon*
---
and I’m not hating on that! My end goals in RS involve slayer so I’d prefer to do slayer.  Also out of school so most of my afk just involves Netflix 
---
Brush same :(
---
Alright I laughed so hard I just didn't expect it. 
---
I feel like firemaking would actually fit more as a sub-skill of woodcutting as someone mentioned. Unless there was a way to increase your firemaking to where you burn food as seldomly as using a range or stove. As a matter of fact that would be awesome 
---
They probably keep track of it for the opposite reasons. I would love to know which tiles are absolutely the most popular; however, any system you have for counting tile uses would also reveal which tiles are never used. 
---
Not for settled though. 
---
Yeh are u braindead? If something takes 1600 hours and you do it 8 hours per day it’ll take you 200 days to get it not 1000+ lmao
---
Good luck man I hope to do the same soon! 
---
Could someone explain what this "marking" thing is? Is this a new feature or 3rd party client update?
---
You guys are getting as much as you get in Runecrafting. Get mems.
---
&gt;IMO it shouldn't even need a diary. I think this could be acceptable as an upgrade from the square just by having a smithing level of 50 and completion of Dragon Slayer 1. If it were f2p, that would be it. If it were p2p, it'd be a good idea to require a dragon head, dragon bones, and a anti drag potion.
---
For F2p that seems alright, but for p2p the dragon head/bones (not so much the potion, that looks alright) kinda seem like a less fitting requirement. I would be personally like to see it at medium diary threshold though; lower it a bit, but still make it a grind to get and be readily available.
---
&gt;In terms of bonuses, it would be nice to see the offensives be neutral and the defensives to be much much higher.
---
Yeah, I think the neutral attack bonuses would be really good; should be a very flexible sheild. Though with higher defense stats may be a bit much. Might be worth keeping it in its niche instead of making it a well rounded sheild outside of dragons. The neutral offensive stats combined with high defense stats would make it pretty strong for its targeted combat range
---
If only there was a saw aswell
---
The wilderness is supposed to be dangerous whether there is PKers or not. I've done high level PK and PvM both. 
---
There's some nasty stuff up there without your pure range 1 def zerk obby maul clan being there. 
---
Take those away and you are making the wilderness less dangerous which WILL have repercussions on the economy of supply, since more people will be able to gather wilderness supplies and do wilderness slayer with greater relative ease. 
---
&gt;we seem to get no updates...
---
Technically arent most/all updates also PK updates? 
---
They never really made much PK specific content in the last 18 years, have they? Because PKing is just taking your regular runescape account and fighting other runescape accounts. The more "content" they add the further it strays from what it's supposed to be. 
---
Next time just crop it all out except text. And maybe a small blur of the offender in question
---
They just chilling or what? I tried to ask wtf they were doing but the one dude only responded @silence” 😂 
---
:c
---
In razer synapse you should be able to bind those keys to keyboard function, then select the Fkey they are bound to in RuneScape 
---
I do them even though I'm almost max combat. They're just so easy and the profit you get isn't bad for what you do I just click once and let autoretaliate do the rest
---
Don’t bring items you’re not prepared to lose to the wilderness. 
---
They're mechanics that are considered when creating new content, and reward high effort fairly well. Obviously it trivializes old content, but Ai see it as a high effort - high reward scenario 
---
Im fine with the saradomin wizard hitting much harder. He jusy shouldn't be as beefy. Especially wearing only robes.
---
He'll probably have changed capes at least 3 times by then
---
S K I P . If you're efficiently slaying you should be skipping about 1/4-1/3 of your tasks (just enough tp keep your points up). You probably shouldn't use konar except every 10th task for points.
---
Do wildy slayer if you're low on points 
---
Lmfao his totla xp is 132m lvl 118 mage range would exceed that. It’s overloaded retard.
---
Swapping back and forth between questin for rfd (currently at 150 qp) and getting various skill req for diaries. Can't wait to finish up rfd so I can start workin on ds2.
---
This is top quality 
---
Yeah but I'm drunk
---
It doesn’t really change the meta at all, anywhere you were gonna use a ranged cape for def u would still use a ranged cape, and vice versus.  It just matches the pickup rate which is a nice buff for consistency 
---
Then whose fault is that! Not the person who killed you 
---
Getting offended at insults like 'autistic' or 'weeb loser' online, especially on this subreddit, is silly.
---
so no new skill
---
But you made a girl sad :c

Me too man. Varrock east bank. I’ll never forget it

---
Haha you sound like my ex
---
He obv dc and after so long the game logs you out if you don’t input. You were just wasting your time splashing instead of killing him gj
---
Yeah, fuck the mage training arena. The thought of getting another account bones to peaches has me shook. 
---
Engine work a.k.a client coding, stuff that happens every day among amateurs over Rune-Server and other rsps communites. Even RuneLite with no paid team could manage to get us some good QoL.
---
Can you imagine Swampletics picking you up in his massive, ripped arms and carrying you through the perils of Morytania to his newly built shack then him throwing you onto his floor and ravaging you. At first you're reluctant but then you notice his 2 hunter level and you accept his sizable content explosion all up in your guts? 
---
get urs checked out that looks normal
---
I have to agree. I find it dull for the same reason that all combat training is dull. It's the same thing over and over. Especially since efficient slayer is *quite literally* the least varied version of combat, and sadly it's the only way to train the skill if i don't want to spend 3 years getting 99.
---
For what it's worth, my favorite skill is probably Magic. When compared to other combat skills, it's not just click and wait to kill a monster. It *can* be if you want it to, but it's easily one of the best support skills in the game. You can use it to cook, craft, turn things into coins, AoE Freeze enemies, heal, poison, cure poison, heal other players, the list goes on. It's easily one of the most expansive skills to date with a huge amount of content, yet it's overlooked because instead of looking at what content it actually provides, people just look at it from a training perspective of "just alch or burst to 99" without actually seeing what the skill truly has to offer.
---
In my opinion, magic is a skill done *right*. 
---
Sure, new content introduces new items, but the vast majority of new items are not worth using in pvp.
---
Yeah took me like 6 hours to finally get diary kill a week ago, haven't tried since then and I'm kind of afraid to go back, it was such an ordeal.
---
Garbage in terms of what? In terms of completing the inferno, I’d argue its more successful than the normal arma + anc setup for noobies
---
I mean they figured you’d be able to continue training in areas with stuff that dropped food I assume and you cook it. I think a revamp with someone along those lines and buffs if a fire is made in an area would be cool
---
Yeah I think it took me two today and about 30 attempts or so haha maybe a little less
---
oh shit
---
Please stop making everything require these fucking diaries, the game shouldn't be locked behind me runecrafting for longer than the human life expectancy.
---
Make quests, minigames, slayer tasks as the way to get these kinds of things, so I feel like I'm doing something other than clicking a stone altar to make tree stones.
---
Would it be possible to have a hotkey to toggle run on and off?
---
A dedicated "run" hotkey would be usefull because CTRL + click doesn't behave like the "run orb". You can't stop running by simply clicking somewhere else, you have to click very close to where your character is, wait for your character to get there and only then can you click to walk to a distant location.
---
i hope he dies at barrows

multi-combat? sure. join a cc at revs

Blindfold bandos is viable? Lol?  It's a silly thing to do for entertainment.  Is that bad?

Because it's a game and games should be fun.

Will you remove combat penalty at raids?
---
the only reason i can think is they dont want people taking 9 alts into solos and having massively scaled point raids at ease. as it stand ud have to have 9 115+ alts to do that vs just making 10 level 15 accounts to scale ur solos for massive points and items

Graceful clothing should never have been added to the game. 
---
Back in the day, people put more effort into creating a unique appearance for your character with expensive armour, treasure trail rewards, or other misc items. Now, everyone runs around in the same miserable abomination of clothing simply because it's too annoying not to wear it.

I'm not going to let you skip over this. Where is your evidence that the millions of refugees are the "majority wealthy class".

Aggie in Draynor who makes coloured dyes requires way too much dialogue to get dyes made. I think it would be better if we could get a trade button where we can buy multiple dyes at a time would be really nice.

That's interesting because what used to happen and what is supposed to happen when you dc is you stay there during combat until you die then it logs you out.

"plaguing" 
---
Gmaulers are pretty much the last active cb bracket in bh because everything else is boring as shit. I dont even know why costs or powerspikes are relevant when it comes to the gmaul this isnt some moba, its runescape and pvp without gmaul is practically dead because noone every dies unless you go for the 1 in 350 chance.
---
All these suggestions are just begging for more gp/h on slaytasks. Just add some alchables if you need another high profit slayertask that badly. If people actually cared about an cheap/easy to get item being op there would be riots about the slayerhelm but I cant remember seeing a single person complaining about that in the years im playing osrs.
---
It's on the high scores bud
---
Up to you tbh, the most efficient route is still to start by mid-high 80s combat, then do Turael boosting for points, switching over to Nieve when you get unlocks. That way you'll be able to do all the tasks in the game fairly quickly.
---
85 still if you want to get into Slayer early but 75 is also an option for Konar, although it's very likely that you'll struggle with some tasks and it's definitely not efficient to do.

&gt; Mage accuracy does not matter when fighting a npc with 0 mage defense. You dont even need to have positive though id keep it at least at +1.

it does matter. just not a lot. prosy vs vestiments is a  tiny bit of accuracy vs a tiny bit of prayer.
---
also, its not magic defense that matters, its magic level. magic level is npcs magic defense.

Not the person youre asking but account creation time can be used as a recovery option. While gentletractor has it set as "click to view" someone could accidentally flash it on stream and get their account scooped.

You can tell which of the four rotations you're in by what positions the boss goes to in the first few parts of the fight.

---
- Green mid, green east
---
- Green mid, blue east

Remember that most of the guide images show south as up, since that makes it easier to see the whole arena and all of the different spawn locations

Msb (i) with rune arrows is pretty good exp even at 90+ range...idk what you're talking about
---
My eyes hurt
---
You have 1.14% of the exp to level 99.
---
Doing that whole thing again (10-54) will get you level 63.
---
Doing both grinds again (10-63) will get you to level 70.
---
Doing the 4 grinds again (10-70) will get you 77,
---
Doing the 8 grinds again (10-77) will get you 84,
---
Do it again for level 93
---
Again (less a little) for 99
---
On the bright side, getting 68 and doing DT will allow you to use your money to burst the magic exp and finish 99 in a little under 50 hours (but will cost \~ 60m)
---
Usually around 2PM CST
---
Just because you have the means doesn't mean you should. Dfs is pretty low priority as far as gear upgrades go, especially since you're better off using super anti and a dragon defender in a lot of scenarios where you might use dfs.

and they say rs3 is ezscape 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
no it's not, at 1710 ttl Jagflex downloads 150mil directly into your bank. 
---
Theres another form of suicide that was mostly taught to women to avoid being captured and raped. It involves cutting an arterie under your armpit and bleeding out but seppuku is literally cutting your intestines out to restore honor to your teacher or family
---
I like this a lot. Makes it actually valuable besides fashionscape.
---
I had hella good RNG tho, took an hour for bronze to rune then took another hour for the d def 
---
Make it a future quest reward instead of a existing diary reward
---
GRRR ME NEED REWARD FOR PLAYING GAME OR ME BORED 
---
LOL :P 1st*
---
Holy rng Batman 
---
Nice dude. I’m 1730 ttl and my bank is like 30mil. But good anecdote!
---
Also, like myself, some people are absolute trash and spend half of their RS time thinking "What do I do now..." Like you said, not everyone is going for maximum productivity. I try to find a balance of fun and effectiveness, but my hatred of quests leads me to neither.
---
The amount that have come over here because of MTX is awful.  So many people here started playing because RS turned to shit way before MTX.  I hate how many players just want this game to go back down the same awful path
---
It doesnt matter though. You can look up for the more detailed response, but having higher accuracy vs a npc with 0 mage defense (I.e; dust devil) will NOT give you more accurate hits vs having only +1 accuracy. Accuracy from gear is there to determine your chance of hitting. And vs 0 def npcs you only need +1 accuracy to have the "most" accurate hit possible. Again, having +150 will not and can not make you any more accurate than having only +1 when against a 0 mage defense npc.

Wow look at mr money bags over here everyone he's too good for stews

&gt; 8-kill average trips
---
and here's me doing 1 kill per trip lol
---
how can anyone say no to this 
---
Idk I kinda like it how it is
---
Looks like a chubby bobblehead sitting down
---
&gt; Whole world. There's a bunch of teleports to get around. 
---
is there a teleport to raids 2 in tournament worlds?
---
Not a single dragon buttplug :/
---
I liked the hand cannon!
---
This one lying shitbag claimed that he had a maxed account and his character would ride on a motorcycle and he was invisible.
---
I definitely found it suspicious at least.
---
how do you get to TOB in this worlds? no drakan's medallion
---
Repost af
---
You dont have to straight out say something for it to have that meaning. This justifies the fact that warding offers no content by saying we have other skills that are just as shit.  It's not a delusion lol. 
---
Tier 90+ gear, summoning familiars, overloads+OP other potions in flasks.
---
It wouldn’t even be fun to watch.
---
Don't worry mate thousands of players still dont understand 
---
Maybe you should spend more time thinking lol 
---
you chose to limit yourself
---
I feel like I've seen you around, I hate the crashers man. I feel ya
---
You get the stone back and use another axe on it.
---
Literally my first thought upon seeing this was a flashback to my breaking this in the first five minutes of having it
---
I was half joking but if they did this I'd love it to look like my late rat Amy. She was a good rat
---
Was definitely the longest but was pretty chilled actually! Zeah and ZMI are pretty good. Same with mining in terms of it being slow but doesn’t require much attention. I probably hated hunter or herblore the most though, so much clicking.
---
Using dreambot and writing a script you could get this done in a couple hours given u have the skills to go everywhere
---
He's a snow corn.
---
Snow corn :)
---
Do you assume each hit probability is the same?
---
You still get defence xp but it’s not as much 
---
Yo Ali's gonna be pissed I forgot my moss. 
---
*Excuse me* but seppuku is committed using a *tanto* or other dagger-sized weapon. A katana is far too long to be effective for this ceremony. The katana is not meant to stab through your back like this picture shows - instead it is meant to disembowel, ideally severing the descending aorta. 
---
You suggesting this has therefore brought dishonor to you and your family, and you must now commit seppuku (using an appropriately sized weapon, thank you).
---
Fuck off dude
---
the point of no return was zulrah gear and venom
---
what'll be the 3.0 update, curses?
---
Mid 80s combat stats
---
you got it
---
3rd party
---
What? Who says they joined a terror group? Maybe her husband is Syrian-born and they went there before the fighting started?
---
its not like theyre gonna remove xp from nmz, it makes no sense why little to no cost very afk training would be the best way to train combat stats. if anything they might nerf it to 80% or something along those lines
---
too wong fu.
---
Imagine getting this upset at a joke 
---
Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it :)
---
The names were certainly fun to make
---
#1 if "click precision" is your idea of "skill ceiling", you need to go play other games. The "skill" difference between clicking a small icon vs a slightly larger icon is nothing.
---
#2 i agree with but it got voted down with PvP included so i'll take what i can get. Having it nowhere is worse game design than having it everywhere but PvP.
---
That's exclusively if you're maxing your absorption usage. You could drink 1000 points of absorb, rock cake down to 1, afk 2.5m and you'll be at 3 health. Rock
---
Cake back down to 1, repeat. Sure you aren't maximizing you absorption efficiency, but it'll still last you long enough to refund the point cost of the absorptions at the least which means you can do it forever. TBH a lot of the time I afk for 5m with absorbs for my overload to wear off and then I rock cake and drink my next overload dose.

OSRS Community: We want a skill that has as much content as Crafting/Smithing/Fletching combined, the fun of Slayer, the AFK training options of WC, tick manipulation, and has to introduce new/fulfilling content that fits in with the lore.
---
Oh, and it can't devalue any of my current skills/accomplishments, or affect the price of any item in the game, can't introduce powercreep, can't remove/rework any current content in the game, and nothing in the skill whatsoever can be dead content. It also has to be both BIS and not introduce powercreep. 
---
Looks beautiful. Lumby med instead though.
---
how about fish sack max cape
---
You are not correct here. a basic vestiment, ancient staff, prayer setup is 4.407  (x9) vs a prosy max prayer setup is 4.3273 (x9) dps. Vestiments is 2% more accurate.

Fuck no

Not really upset just amazed.
---
Lmaooooooooooooo bro that is the weed number!!!!!
---
This needs to happen!
---
Can the farming skill cape teleport us to the redwood section of the guild near the bank booth?
---
There's a few abilities on rs3 that prevents cc. 
---
i just past 30,000 kc, started in the old safespot in the swamp and it's been 2 years. 14 curved bones, 0 dwh.
---
literally need some blessing thanks much appreciated i've become a shell of my former self, i used to be happy.
---
No one has ever said that it's hard. It's just absolutely terrible content that has negative enjoyment for 10 hours.
---
Man I ask a question and get hate geez this subreddit.
---
Now now we can't stereotype - I'm sure Ak-Haranu would gladly kill you himself.
---
320 kc, one leather, one piece away from 1st ring and one pet. 
---
I mean they do like hundreds of damage per hit so we would be fucked. We couldn't even scratch them
---
I'd watch the hell out of a video with this concept. 
---
Yeah like we're all gonna come running back to rs3 as soon as they fix that damn wildy
---
i could also train skills with a bot, but i choose not to.
---
&gt;hard lumby diary for a mediocre shield
---
Why does every fucking suggestion on this sub need to add a diary requirement for low-medium content?
---
I can't see it at all
---
Oh no wonder, drives me nuts because there’s no damn O in definitely.
---
im level 1 construction
---
No, its sudoku
---
Is there an ETA of when this nerf will arrive?
---
Now we have two holidays a week. I am ok with this 
---
I was gonna say its $11 USD but then I saw you mentioned buying via a VPN looping through Mexico. How does this work? Asking for a friend
---
That is what he does
---
Fuck Donald trump and his dumb ass supporters. &amp; don’t come at me with the “tOlERaNT lEfT”inbreded head ass
---
Can dark totem pieces continue to be received if we already have 3 in the bank? Preventing additional totem piece drops makes no sense as you can already stack full totems.
---
Do you use runelite or OSbuddy 
---
Really sad this scam has now spread to reddit
---

Me too! 5 years ago XD
---
Was thinking the exact same thing 
---
huh?
---
seems pretty shitty tbh I have more thrownaxes in like 240 kills br
---
#DOGWHISTLING
---
Thats because youre negative in the second? The difference between +1 positive mage accuracy bonus vs +150 does not matter against a 0 defense enemy. You can still be positive with wearing proselyte top/bottom. 
---
Again there is a detailed explanation about how accuracy works vs 0 mage def pvm npcs on the wiki and videos about it that explain it better than i am. 
---
Are you sure they aren't just alts?
---
Wyvern alts were super popular for awhile
---
Lumbridge hard diary for a less than addy kite? No thank you. 
---
So with that being said, how strongly do you feel about having to have this as a skill? If it were instead labeled as a new activity, either widespread or centralized to a certain area, would this demerit the idea in anyway? 
---
In fact, wouldn't it make more sense, keeping in mind the simplicity of existing skills? If this combines the use of multiple skills as described, then it wouldn't need to be it's own skill, rather a diverse activity that gives more uses to bland skills such as FM, ect.
---
Construction could be a key component as well for building ships
---
I  saved up for a ring on wealth to help my drop rates here.
---
Cause 90 smithing fucking sucks btw
---
Gz alch yourself :) 
---
Make it the attempting to reconnect bar and I’ll support this 
---
Nex or curses would do it. We've already past the point of no return.
---
Polls are actually detrimental to the game how they're currently handled as they give the players, majority of which have no knowledge of game design, too much power and I can only imagine how limiting it is as a developer. 
---
Jesus fucking christ will you all stop with your devalued ironmen?!?! You are all devaluating my devalue ironman and it's been really rough lately
---
wow you caught me on 
---
a big OOPSIE haha Xd but not as big of an oop
---
sie as the guy who got a dog mixed up with a rat
---
SKEEETIITTT
---
Would buff my bronze-rune dagger collection 
---
You don't need 90 smithing to use a dfs....
---
Huh interesting, might have to try it out. I've got some spare imp boxes from zeah library in the bank.
---
Are you really going through with this...
---
I’ve seen Jagex being spelt some weird ways over the years, but haggled made me laugh uncontrollably.
---
Also you bought your money, be it 1b or 10m on you unless you have 95+ slayer
---
There was no botting involved with what I’m saying. It’s literally marking tiles, not playing the game for you.  You can do the same thing in runelite
---
thatsmyfetish.gif
---
They'll have to poll it, program it and then release it, I'd say maybe 2-3 weeks?
---
That one dude makes up like 75% of the words in that thread lol. He's insufferable but unfortunately right.
---
It’s not a bug it’s a feature 
---
Maybe less skewed, but yes.
---
I mean it's not a scam. I'm just now sure how else too liquidate these items. 
---
the second setup has positive magic accuracy.
---
weird
---
Looked at your account and no way I am going to,argue with a weed smoking leafs fan that collects jersies, Lol it is like arguing with myself
---
I’m just sick of how much people are bitching lately
---
Uh... Wintertodt
---
If you have the Lumbridge hard done, I'm assuming 8m is not an impossibly large sum of money for you to acquire. I never said you should always buy a DFS.
---
You’ve commented on the wrong post that’s why people are downvoting
---
Should the goal be to buy dhcb and rigour?
---
Think you’re investing in stats / to investing in gear ratio might be a bit off at that point then. Great that you want those levels but that’s on you for not having 8m to spend on gear imo
---
Mohammed avdol
---
Just grind for a bond rather than trying to scam one on reddit?
---
Hmm, seems like a great plan
---
\&gt;be OP
---
\&gt;get RL developer mode
---
\&gt;turn on all dev tools
---
\&gt;highlight everything
---
\&gt;game over
---
Well then time to rise and grind!
---
as the holder of over 15,000,000 slayer experience i can confirm that this is true 
---
I think they could release Nex if they offered alternative rewards than T80s and bonus HP gear, but I don't know what would be appropriate. I'd rather we got a new boss anyway.
---
Curses would be a hard red line, for certain.
---
Legit a full arm set and a pet in 10kc -_-
---
So a question that provoked a discussion on a Q and A post is the wrong question? 
---
Could be. It would have to be a bare min alt. That would make sense though 
---
Usable only by HCIM
---
Why does it matter how easy it is to acquire 8m if you shouldn't use that 8m to buy the shield anyways? 
---
That is not most of the rs3 playerbase. That was just one random person kinda like how this sub gets random stupid posts
---
If you are looking for specific pieces send me a pm
---
Ouu. Very nice. How long does he/she measure?
---
I have 30m wc XP no beaver pet soooo
---
I'm not scamming. My bank is completely filled so I can't even bank anymore items otherwise I would.
---
99 fishing off shrimps
---
Accuracy is a skill but
---
And what would happen to the BGS?

Imagine replying the same type of passive-aggressive 2007scape insult at people who respond. "Wow youre really upset." "Dang imagine crying this hard at a post." "You shouldnt get this upset." "You're too involved and dedicated to other people." "You sound like the upset one mate, quit crying about it." 
---
You are far enough on the spectrum to get my upvotes.
---
I've honestly given up trying to measure but I'd guess around 4/5 feet, I'm not good at guessing either XD
