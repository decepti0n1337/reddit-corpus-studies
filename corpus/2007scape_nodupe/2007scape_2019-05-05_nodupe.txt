Why even have a mask on your agility suit that ups your run regen? It seem to me like negatively impacting your ease of breathing would impair stamina regeneration.

What would be a decent farming level to stop at for someone who hates the skill?

I still have another 5 or so slayer levels left before 95 so I'll get my combat up before raids anyhow. I might stop at 93 slayer. Not sure yet.

I just don‚Äôt understand why though, like, there isn‚Äôt any reason to remove any of this stuff, especially considering some of it‚Äôs still in use, it‚Äôd be like removing all pickaxes except bronze rune and infernal, just because some don‚Äôt get quite as much use doesn‚Äôt mean you should just get rid of them.

Slayer task isn't even always viable as you could have substituted other kills in that timeframe, e.g. every time I get a black demon task I use it to dump any dark totems.

I've filtered bones/ashes from my drops but it's pretty reasonable to keep those in to track exact kc, although it's only really notable if you're killing things in multi that will die simultaneously

First make a baby pure cmb 60/70-ish.
---
Learn how to pk on that, kill green dragon bots, other pures and pvmers. Once you got a bit better, get your pure to late 70s cmb or early 80s and once you get bored make it a zerker and max it.
---
Being a pure is really fun and cheap way to pk, I‚Äôd recommend tribridding. Edge pking is boring imo and too many prods, 99 strenght, 99 range at cmb 58 for example..
---
While as a baby pure tribrid, you can have lots of fun and you‚Äôll fight different kind of people too.

After seeing how much of an ass you're being to people telling you how to better secure your account(s), theres really no longer any remorse for your situation. You fucked up your security somewhere.

~~Dungeoneering~~ Slayer should've been a minigame.

And unlocks some sweet end game bosses
---
Imo, graceful should be the standard adventurer uniform... i wouldn't mind in the future if it got things like defence bonus (on par with mithril or addy). Also useful things like ice gloves, some slayer items, among others could be integrated into it to make it better. My point being is that i think it should be an all arounder gear for any activity which improve as you progress through the game.... that be said... This game is toxic as fuck, need that surgical mask to keep to fumes out.
---
Too much effort to click a single tile in the middle of all that shit. It should autopath you

Woox walking is specifically talking about the tactic on vork's acid phase. Obviously everyone knows you can walk and attack at the same time.

---
i mean old school has been out since 2013. assuming you started around launch, 2500 hours to max you would only have to play 8 hours a week to be maxed by march of this year. 2500 is probably a bit steep too, but im assuming someone playing casually is probably also not doing the most efficient things all the time when they're playing.
---
Cause of the several thousand of hours it takes to max, maybe 90% of them is non-combat related?
---
Yeah bummer, I'm not sure how I managed to mess that up from the rl client
---
The cap is 99 visible level, but the woodcutting guild's bonus is invisible so it continues to matter even at 93+ WC.

Well 1 nest is worth less than the thing, but then again the nests contain seeds which may be worth a lot right? I was curious if there's some analysis on it.
---
Yup. Someone was on your account. I'm guessing you have a bank pin or just have nothing of value in your bank? Either way, change password for rs, gmail, and set up 2fa on both. And if you don't have a bank pin, set that too.
---
Yea i cant imagine it be that hard for a code to remember first 99 and make it optional. Oh well :(
---
mfw people complain about good drops cus its not the specific good drop they wanted.

Stay at 78 attack and strength stop at 77 prayer you‚Äôll pretty much be a med level it‚Äôs better Han going maxed .

I pretty much only play on mobile so I don‚Äôt really have a choice lol
---
Some players use a bow to kill chins which run too far from the traps so they spawn closer, so technically its a thing
---
You were given 50 links. Claiming one upset you because it was buzzfeed does not invalidate the sources.
---
I need a source of prayer regardless, and stackable food (brews) make for longer trips.
---
Worlds start at 301 so in the URL 301 is listed as 1 then 302 is 2. So your 238 is actually world 538.
---
Even though I use none of the non-BIS versions, I still think it's stupid to remove any of them. People either use them for fashionscape or because they're bad and can't do the Inferno. 
---
You might have a case for the regular mage arena 1 max capes since they're very similar but then again, no one even uses those anymore so removing those would also be pointless. 
---
I had a feeling this was a post about wanting to screw over fire max cape plebs so I checked your profile. I find it beyond hilarious that just 2 days after you get your Infernal cape that allegedly took you 256 attempts and 24 Zuk fights, you want them to remove the fire max cape. I could bet anything you'd be against this if you failed to get infernal cape lmao.

---
Look what they did to my boy...
---
Maces actually give prayer bonus. Figured this out recently. Still no one uses them
---
Have you ever been in a storm, Benjo?
---
You only give a fuck because you got Inferno cape yesterday and what to flex, no one honestly gives a shit and there is 0% chance they are going to waste their time removing items people have spent upwards of 15m on, also you aren't even max so why do you care about it?
---
Agreed, but I also think that the average age of the player base was starting to increase with the rise of the mainstream appeal of the internet (not to mention the growing science and information we had on the game), so that lead to more of a logic driven min-maxing meta that the game had never seen before.
---
I have PTSD from this. I'm not maxed, but I've been doing inferno attempts for a while and as soon as I got to jad, one attack in, my wifi adapter shut off and I died
---
It‚Äôs a 50/50 chance
---
Wow ranger vambs!
---
Try to fixate on the individual borders of each tile. Without banding the tile borders are a lot more defined and blocky.
---
Short answer: subtract 300 from the number shown in the world list, e.g. world 345 -&gt; oldschool45.runescape.com
---
Longer answer: for technical reasons (aka. engine work) OSRS can only have numbers in world names. In RS3 the names are shown correctly, so if you're on OSRS world 301, an RS3 player would see you on world "Old School 1". That's also why RS3 lobbies (and in the past RS Classic worlds and FunOrb servers) show up as large numbers if a player on your friends list or clan chat is in one of them.
---
Tired of looking at the cheese capes
---
lmao nice cape
---
Yeah lets add a light to the game boy adavanced and mark the price up 150 bucks.

Not even trolling rn, that light is worth every penny.
---
Fire max cape is an abomination.
---
With Slayer Helm the issue is the number of variants. There is both imbued and normal for all of them and if they did change how the slayer helm worked, say adding the Eternal Slayer Ring to it, they would need to do that for all the versions (currently 14 different items), which creates a lot of clutter and can make it easier for one to behave differently.
---
With the Max Cape, the same issue doesn't apply; at least no in the same way. While item clutter is still an issue, only the "Max Cape" has the cape perks since the others lose it in favor of stats. So functionally the Fire Max Cape is a trimmed Fire Cape rather than a trimmed Max Cape, which does make it easier to offer variants.
---
what's the emote at 0:17?

Youre crying on reddit about how hard the gargoyle boss is, then calling people idiots for not knowing the most efficient way to kill vorkath? Very ironic, especially because i wasnt talking to you.

Lmao really going to reduce economic destabilization to "clicky clicky" argument? Everything in this game is "clicking your computer every couple of minutes."
---
Can you slow it down please?
---
A good start to your shield slot is book of darkness, and you should go get the god capes from mage arena and imbue it.
---
greater demon tasks are pretty bad, but if you want to mage them use occult necklace, chaos gauntlets if you use chaos runes, and tome of fire for the 50% damage boost. 
---
I would recommend using arclight/whip and proselyte gear and just praying tho.

PS: Trying to add a flair to the post but it says no flairs available. So yeah. I'll check in a bit to try and add again

---
I want to be nice and help but then I lose exp.
---
Before you post things like this you should think to yourself "what does this bring to the game?" you want to remove things from the game because "it feels weird" why does the Cape have to be bis? The devs have spent time making these capes and you want them removed for no reason. Out of all the things I've seen on this sub this has got to be the most single minded redundant thing ever. Its Cape and having them in or not changes nothing to the game.
---
Since they added the portal nexus, you need 84 to be able to boost for absolutely everything that's useful to have, but the max nexus isn't completely necessary so I'd say you're still fine just going for 83.
---
what a fuckin waste.
---
i have every intent of getting 99 agility on those little monkeys
---
Would be worse than a Thanos snap to the player count.
---
It's obviously possible without prayer flicking, just takes an extremely long time to do because you have to wait for SGS specs or Falador Elite charges.
---

Even on a pvp world he would keep his graceful.

Warding is at least an actual skill. Slayer is just a minigame that they slapped an XP grind onto for no reason. Imagine if "treasure hunting" was its own skill.

---
Aw whats wrong snowflake you get offended? Did I go to far :,(??
---
It's popular because they gated profits that easily could've been done without it just so they could push the skill on players.

I.e. Slayer tasks, the bonuses associated like Slayer dungeons, black mask, and so forth make the late game gp/hr more than without the bonuses... And all of it could've existed without Slayer but whatever.

Group ironmen. Youre all ironmen from scratch and can only trade with eachother. Youre not receiving maxed gear from people in your group unless youve already earned it on that fresh IRONMAN. You get it?
---
You callin me a safer?!
---
You definitely dont have to do that. If you wanna hard camp rigour for triples and zuk you need like 4 for bow 5-6 for acb and 3-5 brews depending on how hard you facetank healers and rangers on the zuk wave. Which gives you a good number of supplies to use on the waves.
---
Generally by the time you can get to zuk youll be able to get to the hard waves (mage and range) using like 3-4 doses of restore or a fally shield charges... and generally no brews (bar bad spawns or unlucky hits). Which assumes you sgs spec when you have it but not camping for hits.

Old style plane with new bigger engine means they sit higher in the wings. To compensate there was a program that automatically nosed down the plane to keep it from aiming to high upward and stalling. Unfortunately the training for most pilots didn't emphasize the change enough if at all for the autopilot and it lead to some horrible accidents. 
---
Pilots are being trained to know how to easily disable the system, as well as the automatic system itself being nerfed to not nose down as voilently.

The 737 max added a new typ of engine that was too big for the plane. Instead of making an entirely new model of plane for it and forcing pilots to be re-trained for flying it, they strapped the engine to the 737 and added some software to automatically tilt the plane down if it started pointing  up, because the heavy new engines were making it tilt.
---
Of course, their marketing was claiming it was exactly the same to fly as any other 737, so they chose not to tell the pilot about the system. There have now been 2 crashes where the software glitched and drove the plane straight into the ground, with the pilot unaware that the faulty system was even a thing that existed, let alone how to disable it. All 737max planes are now grounded as a result.

It would have potential, but I think just making runes would feel a bit too simple these days. And if Runes were only from Shops and drops, adding a skill to obtain them would be a massive shift and crash prices for some, which would be seen as a negative.

I get what you mean--if such few people have an achievement, then those few will very much display such an achievement. However, this one just seems *too* rare. If they did this, they should also add a pet for people that have obtained all pets.
---
in following the joke it would be "because you struct con"
---
Con as it was in 2006 probably would pass. The original stuff, maybe excluding the altar, was pretty balanced. Also, the ezscape stuff in the skill is stuff we voted in so... I think the bigger issue is that it does overlap with other skills. Like I could see there being demand to just add houses and let us build them with existing skills (e.g. Crafting, Fletching, Smithing, etc).

Because range and melee are set xp per hit. It's not like magic where each spell gives different xp or prayer where each bone and head gives different xp. Every 1 melee damage is 4xp with few exceptions so there's no need for a calc.

There have been some ideas, mainly for Maces. But there isn't a big demand to update these weapons since they are largely irrelevant compared to higher tier weapons and they don't want to replace Scimitars as the best weapon. But hopefully some like Maces will see polls to tweak someday.

i mean,  maybe there should be a bestiary built in so monsters hp is accessible without pulling up the wiki or actually going to kill it first. hell a normal calculator built into the calculators section would be okay too i guess

Thats awesome dude. Hope I can pull that off haha
---
My friend told me about this game 16 years ago. here I am lmao
---
congrats, how long did it take you?
---
Not at all what I was saying. Imp prices are high and there are more total rolls to get boots from so the drop is lower by a bit. Not worth my time anymore
---
What's Trouble Brewing?
---
Yeah the hope would be theyd either vote or hit the no opinion
---
Too high quality! Nice work, on everything

No problem =]

The point is that they are hypocrites.

---
How did you get lvl 99 dank memes in osrs cant find the quest that unlocks this skill?
---
Yeah alching would be easy but the range lvl would take more time and money.  I've never seen an account build like this done
---
Even more impressive when you remember that the quest has been in the game since classic. There were some real gems written back then
---
It's just a comment chain on a main thread post, so it'll just remain here forever and ever
---
Fucking legend of a youtuber right here.
---
Why the 23 prayer surely dropping the range by a level or 2 to get to 27 prayer would be optimal. In a hypothetical sense, that is.
---
I‚Äôm just gonna say congrats. Btw
---
So why did you waste time automating a spell that nobody used because it was stupid slow already, then make it 2 ticks SLOWER?
---
Currently 130 dry at barrows might wanna switch places ü§î

Yeah no problem, having a bank pin will stop a lot of hacks and 2fa makes it even harder. Gl scaping, rc bad

Would it be possible to include a few more columns in the index for low/med/high/end level players? So you could sort by those according to your own ability
---
iirc the engine location along the fuselage is the same. The new engines were too big to put them where the old plane had them because they would be too low and potentially scrape the ground, so instead of redesigning the plane, they moved them up (towards the top of the plane). This either caused the flow around the engine to act differently or it added a thrust component, which added a pitching up moment. The software was designed to counter act this increased pitching up moment

Can get 52 for smite yes, just preference. 77str is the highest you can go while being 85 range and still be range/mage based

nope it wouldn't wreck at all, you'll get one hitted all the time by obby maulers and low lvl gmaulers. Low hp builds are a waste of time, especially since the anglerfish nerf.

enjoy wasting your time on a low hp build. Lvl 58 max obby maulers can smack 49s, good luck surviving that. Also, you'll get anti-rushed every single time lmao.

This is a stupid ass take, he‚Äôs said he has a problem, and thats why he needs the ability to ban himself. Then you came back and said ‚Äúpeople only ban themselves from casinos IRL because they have a problem‚Äù its the same issue, gambling is gambling. Who cares if there is a method for people to ban themselves from casino???? It literally wouldn‚Äôt effect anyone else in any way.

You can only get white lily seeds as a drop from the Hespori boss, so the amount on the market is not as high as with most other seeds, causing a price increase.

Enable 2fa on both your email and your osrs account immediately. Stop clicking on any links posted anywhere, whether it's from YouTube or twitch that associates with osrs because 99.9% of the time you're being led to a phishing site

You have a chance of receiving one when completing a clue scroll of a lower tier with elite giving the best chance at 1/5 chance of a master clue scroll. Masters are fun but the grinds are crazy.
---
My first master had a step that required 81 theiving and the one I am working on now just required completion of RFD. So much fun haha.
---
Okay, let me try and make this post less brain damaging:  
---
Eating food is just too fucking easy. You see noobs making food and eating it all the time. Like, what the fuck, why should noobs be allowed to just eat mindlessly and get HP back? They should fucking work for it.  
---
So here's my idea:  
---
First of all, what kind of savages are we? Eating the whole fucking shark in one bite, you didn't even cut off it's head, just wtf?  
---
We need cooking to be harder, first of all, get a fucking plate, you caveman, I don't know, craft that shit, after that, chop up your shark, properly. You also probably should craft a fork and a knife. In general, F2P are retards and don't deserve food, I got an idea how to fix this...  
---
In runescape, it's now officially impossible to eat without a table, chair and food properly prepared in a plate, also bring your forks and knives, fuckers. Eating should take 30 ticks, and if you get interrupted, you lose the food and don't get healed.  
---
To make this portable and not use much inventory, people with level 85 crafting can craft food packages that include the whole table, chair and your fucking meal. Drop it on the ground and eat the dinner properly, Timmy.  
---
  
---
This will make food mechanic way more skillful and noobs will stop abusing food to get out from shitty situations when they should die. Also, what's up with food healing to begin with? Food should be a hunger mechanic, not health mechanic, if you wanna heal up back to 99, you should go to hospital and rest for 14 days of ingame time in it before you're in shape, and only then you can play the game again. Don't like this? Then don't get hurt, moron.  
---
This game as it is is just too fucking easy.  
---
inb4 next update makes this real.
---
One would be going for 2k total, at 1995 right now! I have it banked if I decide I wanna do prayer.
---
Also going for raids, wanna start soloing them. 78 raids dry. Not a single item for me ever. (and only ever seen 1 arcane, mostly trios).
---
This makes me smile and want to re-watch the office for the billionth time
---
do you get magic to 25 for varrock tele?
---
‚ÄúThis is where I‚Äôd put my black mask if I had one‚Äù but it‚Äôs a slayer helm. They‚Äôre two different items. Like saying the zammy spear same as dh lance
---
It‚Äôs kinda sad. Some dev probably put a ton of work into that mini game lol. I wish they‚Äôd revamp the shitty mini games and give players more incentive to do them. Fishing trawler has to be the most awful one imo. Click your bucket-wait-click your bucket-wait... over and over for 11 painful minutes.

2% chance of going this dry. Congrats on your RNG

Most people don‚Äôt care because of how the community is. A lot of us joke about a lot of stuff so when people talk about serious stuff such as suicide or depression we take it as a joke.

Sorry to hear about this, best wishes, hope it all goes well! &lt;3
---
I stopped league for a bit and got into rs again, I like how there is no losing in this game so I can do whatever I want
---
Don't actually need those stats for Trials by the way. Those stats are used to make the lyre manually, but you could just kill an NPC in the city for a 1 in 17 drop rate of that same lyre.
---
Stop playing because whenever you get a decent amount of money you'll probably go back.
---
The  shards aren't that useful and the base is only used if you plan to kill that boss. That's all the benefits from killing them in the catacombs, right?
---
The melee experience and money gained from abby demons is pretty valuable, which is why I plan on meleeing them
---
So then you have the right image, but the wrong text. Should say ‚Äúthis is where I would put my slayer helm, if I had one‚Äù
---
So tru
---
Would actually embarrass the maxed people without infernal. Go for it.
---
Its more than possible with ur stats, but if ur gonna grind it for a long time it just makes more sense to do it at a higher level when you can do it more efficiently. But if ur just looking for some quick temporary cash then go ahead, ur stats are fine
---
100% üòÇüòÇüòÇüòéüòéüëåüëå
---
Ehhh fukkit dood
---
You think they have the time to update every chat head in the game ? Cos I dont
---
Yup me too, also same new email sh... 44
---
I feel your pain, it took me 2.1k for my first black mask. Now I'm at 2.3k with 3 though, so things can get better.
---
It's basically if you choose to not do the barrage method of killing them, then you should go to the Slayer Tower.  It's more or less by meleeing them, it's not really "efficient" in the first place because the fastest way to kill them for the sake of Slayer xph is in the Catacombs still by Blood Barraging while dealing with the teleporting.
---
Totally agree. I like when games have elements that are relaxing and competitive. League is only competitive I've found.
---
Support for this. I just started playing osrs after playing rs3 for a long time and I can't understand why osrs doesn't have this protection. Ofc I have an authenticator, but we all know what has happened before.
---
you can burst them in catacombs which is annoying but faster xp
---
Hey I recognise your name :P We used to talk sometimes around the beginning of osrs, maybe pre-eoc too? Idk
---
Also congrats! You can finally enjoy the game now.
---
how do you get the red text in chat saying you're 99 and maxed?
---
Gratz btw ! loved the video, quality edit
---
you are not smart
---
It sounds like you're a newer player. i suggest doing a few quests, mainly "recipe for disaster" before you hop into slayer. then get base 70 at least in your combat stats at least. remember to get the item "black mask". it increases your damage against monsters for slayer
---
no its there to make attack potions
---
If your an iron my suggestion is don't, make house tabs and stay on Arceuus spellbook

stopped for like a month or two but recently kinda started league again, I've tried playing some ranked but honestly I've peaked
---
I know I can make it higher and back to my goal but I'm just tired of the grind, not too fun for me. I still do enjoy playing normals with my friends though, Its more of a social thing for me now. I'd love of some of my friends would join me on runescape but rs is really kind if a niche game so the ones that are open to trying it have trouble getting into it
---
Googling shit is destroying the community vibe that MMO games are meant to have, I always ask people advice over googling unless it‚Äôs things like drop tables or what tasks specific slayer masters give. New players don‚Äôt want to feel isolated and rejected in a game blooming with players if a new guy asks me advice or a question id never dream of saying ‚Äúgoogle it‚Äù lmao.
---
Catacombs are multi so you can find an empty world, attack 5+ mobs and afk with auto retaliate, that's the main reason I slay there instead of slayer tower.
---
I'm gay
---
Oh really? I just checked your profile btw...making jokes about genocide? Real mature buddy. I don't want to make any assumptions but I can tell you're not the brightest of individuals.
---
Absolutely. I haven't played the game since I was a kind and I started 6 months ago in the mobile beta and only used my phone to play and I got fire cape &amp; quest cape last month.
---
There is no support network
---
That makes 0 fucking sense. A Max cape is just a big time investment to obtain while getting Fire/Inferno Cape, Avas Assembler, Mage Arena 2 takes a huge amount of skill to do. If they want to show of they're pretigous stuff, just wear the original version. A Max cape combined with an infernal doesn't make it any more prestigious than a normal infernal cape.
---
They are desperately trying to get vote % up. It‚Äôs below 10%.

My mother passed away from complications from colon cancer along with her having a stroke in 2017 after she made the decision to stop her medicine.  She fought the cancer for 10 long years and I was with her every step of the way from her cancer diagnosis to her stroke to her last few weeks of life not even being able to speak or move her legs or eat or drink or sleep or breathe.  It was the most painful experience I have ever been through, speaking as someone who has also suffered from depression, anxiety, and other diagnosed mental illness for a lifetime.   Not a single day goes by where I don't think about her in one way or another.  She was the absolute greatest.  She gave everything so that I could have a nice life when I couldn't find the strength to even take care of myself.  
---
Runescape was important to me growing up.  It gave me something to look forward to when I got home from school and a place that I could feel like I was moving forward and progressing even when I was unable to move forward in real life.  She never played video games herself but the first thing I did when I got my max cape was to have her pick my cape colors.  If you didn't know, you got access to a color wheel on RS3 to color your max cape as you desired.  I had been playing for 9 years on and off at that point and finally maxed after so many thousands of hours spent, playing with my real life friends and girlfriend at the time.
---
I don't think she really understood why I enjoyed the game so much but I loved that just that small part of her was always on my back when I played.  I stopped playing RS3 before EoC was released so my max cape unequipped itself shortly after when divination was released.  I haven't played RS3 since and never plan to max on it again, but I'd be lying if I didn't think about that cape only because it reminds me of her.  
---
I just want to say to you that the pain will dull a bit at times as you move on.  It will take shape in different forms and reminders, like the chair they used to always sit in or their empty place at the dinner table.  Even now, almost two full years later, it still comes back to me from time to time like now as I sit here and cry while I type this message.  Life is a series of struggles for all of us but in time of grief we can always remember the memories that we created and remind ourselves that life is short. Your time here should be spent doing the things that bring you joy and fulfillment, at least in my opinion.  
---
I sincerely hope you find peace and joy in life and even though I have never met you, I wish you the absolute best.  
---
Take care.
---
My personal experience? It's not the same. I'm a pretty casual player and I play for fun and adventure and not maximising xp rates and tick manipulation and what not. Yet it's still slower and clunkier to operate on mobile. Plus anything that uses the keyboard is just clunky. It's playable, but I use mobile for when I'm grinding out a skill, not running around doing quests etc.
---
I'll **~~bite~~** buy
---
Yes. I play 95% of the time on mobile switched from PC.
---
Some high level end game context is a little more difficult but still achievable, for the most part you‚Äôll be fine.
---
It's not so much about that. I mean, 99% of people with a rapier/tbow/scythe have 90+ combat stats. Only some blowpipe users would be affected meaningfully. 
---
It's more about defining the power levels of weapons at each tier. T75 is so clustered that its unclear as to how powerful a T75 weapon is supposed to be. For example, the Abyssal Tentacle is T75, but so is the Scythe and the Rapier. The latter weapons are notably more powerful than the tentacle.

**Cock and ball torture** (**CBT**), **penis torture** or **dick torture** is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the penisor testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.
---
Any other suggestions of how it could be enforced?
---
F, I'm so sorry for your loss OP. Nothing anyone can say will make it better or make you feel better, but I promise it will get better my friend. The wound will never heal, but it will get easier over time.

Reminisce about all the good memories you had with her and know that she'll always be looking over you.

Honestly after the third name forced name change, they should have just banned you.

Clearly not getting the message.
---
To your surprise, not everyone is a pvmscaper. I'm nearly maxed and don't have a firecape. So get off your high horse and stop caring about how other people play the game.
---
The people with max capes don't want this. Let's make that very clear. The high level community overwhelmingly doesn't want BiS max cape variants.

They didn't, it's a spoofed email.

Yeah the cost is only really worth on places you'll make more than 1m/hr extra due to the scythe such as theatre of blood. It might be worth it at places like bandos as well but that's about all I can think of in terms of profiting from it.

Shards are useful for demonic gorillas, which is significantly more money than Abby demons. If you plan to max combat then barraging is the way to go, which I learnt the hard way with my max melees and 96 mage.

Thought of selling it and rebuying while price is still at a good spot. Solely based of its price trend which shows it dropping gradually, but then i end up keeping it, the bucket is so usefull and makes herb runs less stressful by a huge margin and i would highly reccomend keeping it over selling.
---
Regardless of price drops or rises, the bucket is. IMHO. Priceless and ESSENTIAL for anyone who does regular herb runs.

The difference i suppose is that, there is a need for it in real life; because gambling can destroy lives, no one is denying that. They are just saying they don't care if it destroys your osrs account.

Furthermore this unhealthy gambling habit translates itself from the game in too real life, then it's like you say

Woodcutting requires next to zero thought to do successfully. You just need to listen for the sound effect of the tree falling or a bird nest spawning and otherwise you can do it with runescape minimized in the background while doing something else. 
---
Runecrafting and a few other skills are just as repetitive and thoughtless as Woodcutting, but require so much more input so people find them more boring than woodcutting despite technically having more for you to do. On top of this, the reward for tolerating the tedium of Runecrafting is just a more profitable version of the same boring activity. If training it unlocked something fun and obviously useful like Wintertodt, the Graceful set, or agility shortcuts people would complain less about it because they'd feel more rewarded for all the work they put in.

He used gear in Inferno?

All I want is to make it let you finish at least one action. I hate seeing my character continuing the fletching animation for no reason without getting shit.
---
New?
---
Your are\*
---
Whenever I was doing Vorkath. I was just turning off run everytime. It makes everything easier. Just need to pay attention to fireball and make sure you click away before it hits.
---
Support.
---
Easy fix, make the cold of Wintertodt hit everyone all around the world
---
Mining
---
That would be kinda cool, would give more incentive to not use it
---
New in the sense that they're different to the normal ones, they have chat bots and aren't using the names of popular streamers. They're getting way more clicks than those ones recently
---
happiness does not equal not being mentally ill, just saying. Even if its genuine happiness. I'm sure there's some very mentally ill people who genuinely are very happy skinning people alive, but that doesn't make them not mentally ill.
---
(just playing devil's advocate here)
---
NMZ can be done for 6 hours straight easily before getting auto logged. Slayer requires you to get new tasks constantly, and not all tasks are optimal melee xp so even though I‚Äôm not going to look at the numbers or do any math I‚Äôm sure NMZ is faster over the long term.
---
this doesn't really help
---
I was on Atleast a year your twat

You're inefficient if you haven't blocked them

256 attempts in justiciar is practically bruteforcing rng lmao some monkey typewriter shit. I'd love to see a full vid of the kill
---
Appreciate your help Nieve.... lol
---
Am I getting wooshed rn or
---
Yeah I got one yesterday too! I've done 13 beginner trails on my Ironman since it released and got a Monk Bottom (t) and this. Think I used my RNG up because it took full king forever to get a Rune Med from greaters and some zammy robes. Shutup guys I'm f2p.
---
Dont fuk wit ma blowpipe
---
‚ÄúWhat do you mean? We can finally play the game now‚Äù
---
I don't have much motivation to push for infernal cape... once cape is done pvm is over besides 200m slayer.  
---
My PB is wave 56 ~10 attempts with acb and kodai. Tbh Inferno is kind of fun. Learning to deal with blob mechanics and properly deal with waves is interesting... although I don't think it is necessarily "hard". It's just a grind, and idc for pvm grinds myself.  
---
There isn't really much rush to get cape, if anything I'd rather keep putting it off but runs can be amysing when you're in the mood and got some time to throw at it.
---
How do you look like a comment?
---
Questing and training for Ranged and Magic levels.
---
Right cause in the chat box it says ‚Äúparrot is alive‚Äù or ‚Äúparrot is a prop.‚Äù Plus it was a joke sour puss. Wake up on the wrong side of the bed this morning?
---
Congrats. Now play a real game like rs3.
---
Haha at least you looked good getting them
---
Its not worth that much..... keep it
---
Haha at least you looked good getting them!
---
73.6% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
---
there is no Super version for range. Its just a ranging potion which does 4 + floor(10% of range level), so starting from lvl 1 you get +4, then at every 10th level(lvl 10, lvl 20...) you get another boost. So at 90-99 you get +4 + (10% of 99 rounded down) = +13. 
---
The 1 minute timer is also just always running, it doesn't start when you drink a sip, so if you are unlucky you can drink a sip and then the second later you it already ticks down by 1.
---
I‚Äôm on 308 medium clues and still no ranger boots. But congrats! üò≠üòÖ

If you cut out out your ingame name it mightt be smart to makensure your reddit name doenst match the one in the chat.

My f2p iron fashionscape game strong
---
What kind of psycopath takes the first route lol...
---
Truly
---
I've been discussing it with a few of the boys and I'm still hesitant. Honestly the best of both worlds is just to make a fully maxed main now. I already have the maxed pure, once I max the med I may as well make a maxed main so I can use the tent whip as well. I just can't bring myself to get the attack on this account, it feels Iike I've wasted so much time when I could have just AFKed NMZ with Dharoks from the beginning. It really is a sunken cost fallacy, but of the worst kind.
---
They should add a new skill
---
Remember the degradable armor from RS2? üòÇ
---
People use it at Grotesque guardians and for Dagannoths, but not sure if they lose money doing it and only do it for pet, or if its actually better even when considering the cost.
---
cannon, slayer helm, bis gear for all 3 styles, slaughter/expeditious bracelets probably.
---
They don‚Äôt center development around supporting Linux, but the thing is Java is cross platform anyways so for the most part there shouldn‚Äôt be issues.
---
Dude you can‚Äôt hack someone off their username...
---
was just gonna say someone should crosspost this lmao
---
That would take forever Haha. Better ways to make gp. I'll buy members eventually. Funny comment tho :)
---
The theoretical "max" would involve every single demonic gorilla dropping a zenyte shard and you hitting your max hit every time without missing for every single kill all hour long, which is so far outside of normal that the number it gave wouldn't be very useful
---
I think estimating an average is a better way to go
---
Ibans if you have the reqs for it.
---
You‚Äôre just mad cause some slayer master gave you a dogs task lmao
---
ü§î
---
On average if he‚Äôs been playing since releases he‚Äôs played 7 hours a day, since he said it took him 6500 hours and you said it‚Äôs been out for 5 years
---
Can't get a Jad task until you have already defeated Jad
---
what? str and attack is 160k an hour and defence is 300k an hour, no where during slayer you get thos xp rates.
---
I've never paid a cent to play this game. Made enough money for a bond in RS3 years ago and played that for a while. Now I just flip RS3 items from my phone using the Runescape Companion App and just buy a bond whenever I need it. I don't play RS3 anymore but it's funds my OSRS easily which is nice.
---
I think max cape variants should represent the top of its respective content. If there'd be a new upgraded ava device I'd want them to change the cape too.
---
More dps = less damage taken 
---
It will help a ton but its doable without. Got to wave 69 woth acb myself. Practise is key.
---
Dragon Warhammer also has much higher stats than the other dragon weapons, but stuffed into t60 because ‚Äúdragon‚Äù
---
Should be fine to start, and it'll only get better as you keep slaying and acquiring ranged and melee levels. Just make sure you have arclight and blowpipe.
---
I'd love that
---
that still happens

I have almost completed my recipe for disaster goal for barrow gloves and I am now looking for a next goal which can also earn me some gp to build my bank up.

My combat stats are 71,81,71,85,75.

Damn nice!, im slowly getting there almost 90 farming, im really hoping to get the pet before i reach 99 cause i really dont want to do runs post 99 üòÇ maybe just herbs but not trees
---
Get 83 con
---
ROFL he screams no and the song says ya
---
I disagree
---
I also went very dry, 1850 dry. I didn't mind it that much because those fucks drop an absolute shitton of good herb seeds, so it's really not the worst to go dry on.
---
What do you mean by prayer flicking in this question?
---
Fuck I'm high and watching this and laughed harder than I should .

Wooooow.
---
I am 14,000,000xp still no pet.... Love my exact xp so don't really want to continue hunting Groot.   I will inevitably continue but for now, no more farming.
---
Oh I just assumed by the btw part, haha
---
It's less dps, use a [damage calculator](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/64wtan/dps_calculator_by_bitterkoekje) to see how much less vs. zuk and magers. The hardest part is the 2h spent actually getting to zuk, so learn that first.
---
Stars aligned for his Justiciar cape and he wants a hard mode now too smh. He claims he‚Äôll be pet hunting for the Nibbler as well üòÇ

It's an hour quest. You're playing runescape, one hour is not time consuming.

NMZ has super ranging pots.

There is indeed a super ranging potion. It's only in NMZ though

That is hard to hear dude, hopefully your luck with groot eventually turns in your favour wheb you decide to hunt for him again

I got 2 at 299 and 1300... i hated that turd just gimme the other 2(which i have higher kc cuz i often have an iron/nub solo rex on task

Tbow is stupidly rare. To rhe point i wish tbow was just an unlocked untradeable afte 30m points instead of this rng clusterfuck. Ive gotten zik, no scythe/tbow/olmlet

Hey mate id be down to join, you can keep 100% of the loot

Shit you are right. I even go to that spot for my abby demon tasks. It feels like there are more

Barrows for initial GP, and if you grind some Mage lvls and get *most* of the gear you could start Zulrah.
---
I‚Äôm at 350 something. Still haven‚Äôt completed pyromancer. No tome of fire, dragon axe, or Phoenix pet either
---
I just checked, lol why is there a green pixel there?
---
I really like this question.  Given the very small amount of people that can complete it, I'd say a Cape would cost way more than any currently traded item.  It would probably cost around the best item in game, Elysian spirit shield, if not more.  Personally I'd pay 400m easy for one
---
You did this to yourself, dense cunt.

---
Has anyone ever sent you weed?
---
&gt; gone rhymes with scone
---
lol pick literally any other word than scone, can be pronounced 2 ways
---
maybe its about the xp we gained along the way
---
The rapier is not "notably more powerful" than the tent. It's got 94 Stab vs 90 Slash of the wiki and 89 vs 86 Strength. It also doesn't degrade. Also pretty sure more monsters are weak to slash rather than Stab, besides obvious exceptions like dragons. Could be wrong, haven't looked into it in awhile.
---
I agree with blow pipe, tbow and scythe as they're busted. Hell, I'd make blow pipe 80 tbh. But Rapier might as well be a cosmetic upgrade compared to those 3 if we're being honest lol.
---
Sounds like the word you were looking for was ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù and not ‚Äúnew‚Äù
---
Not when google advertises the phishing page higher than the real one.
---
Every single iron I've encountered while playing on my iron has been a giant asshole for no reason
---
You'll get ripped up for the posts but its not that bad, Reddit is Reddit

Eh I don't mind it. Keeps them from being farmed and keeps the items a little rare at least
---
If anyone told me I can‚Äôt play until I vote I‚Äôd quit. I do what I want
---
Are you going to do the Song of the Elves quest as a group when it comes out? I might like to join!
---
You don‚Äôt need the diary legs in your inv to get the bonus runes

15 to 20 minutes before being autologged lol.
---
What a fucking arsehole. And shit at the game too taking 256 fucking attempts...
---
there isnt much skill in this game anyway, its rng rng and more rng.
---
Ar-de-gyou... going 15 years strong for how I've pronounced it.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Arr-doog-knee xD

Dammit this man is a genius! /u/Rhan_ for president!

No it's not it's the flair comment being hidden.  Automods don't comment the flair message, the PM it to inbox
---
We have an AppImage Linux download now too which runs out of the box.
---
It's salsa
---
I‚Äôm not sayin there‚Äôs no RNG in this game... but using justiciar and hoping you can tank a few hits is completely different than flicking and clicking at the right times...
---
Think the game is trying to tell you to blow yourself
---
Don‚Äôt make me cry, man!
---
Good sources of runes for low level irons?
---
yeah understandable
---
Like your genes
---
Yeah eventually all the level 75 weapon slots are going to fill up THEN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO???
---
Maybe a bit more like Ard-jew-gone (still rhymes with scone)
---
Ard-ou-gne
---
I carry the d sound in the ou sound, and broke gne into the gone (scone) sounding part. 
---
Can't stop me.
---
I have no idea what the person did but how about you just shut the fuck up? Your post was ten times less necessary than his, he is at least defending himself from something he considers justified.
---
Vowl-'gne'  
---
It's not a terrible comparison, it's actually the best I've seen.
---
Arr douze is how I pronounced it as a kid and never bothered saying it a different lol.
---
32... 29 *panic clicks*
---
Yeah I get what you‚Äôre saying, but just changing the levels doesn‚Äôt change the underlying problem of the items boxing out new content. 
---
If we make tbow a ‚Äút80‚Äù weapon (which it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs a t98 weapon), wtf would a t85 range weapon look like? 1 hitting jad? 
---
The tbow can be worked around by making boss magic levels lower; however, the blow pipe is a massive problem given it‚Äôs hit speed. New ‚ÄúBIS‚Äù range weapons would have to be disgustingly overpowered to match its power. Not to mention every new piece of BIS range gear just snowballs the problem. 
---
Tl;DR: changing the level req doesn‚Äôt fix the problem or make it slightly better.

&gt;Can you receive boss tasks that you don‚Äôt have the quest requirements for if you unlock boss tasks? - Dragon Slayer for KBD - Death Plateau for GWD - Etc

No. You can't receive a slayer task if you don't have all requirements to kill the monster.
---
&gt;Can you ‚Äútoggle‚Äù Lizardman tasks by dropping below 5% favor once you unlock them?

No, because you can't lose favor anymore.

Real noobs are hard to find. Enjoy the gp and dive into questing! Getting all the free quests done and then quest cape is a great first goal that will help you build up a solid main with rounded stats.
---
I think it's a good idea but don't want to make it something worth farming tho than you would get people making accounts just to vote.

In all fairness, psvr is like the worst vr gaming system.

I can try turning animation smoothing off if you think that will make for a better video.

next video i plan on having more clips, and speeding every clip up to about 2-3 seconds before the kill and making it 10 minutes hopefully with more edits and comentary. thanks for the input
---
I've been playing this account for around 6500 hours since 2013 when OSRS was released, obviously not every hour is efficient.

Not sure what your problem with NMZ is, but it‚Äôs the perfect way to get your stats to 80/99/80 so you can then start doing slayer.

If ur doing ancient d hide, try to get ahrims. Start out with a 3/4 way switch (ahrim top, ahrim skirt, trident, ancient book), u can camp ur boots and helmet. U can use a neitz or a d hide coif or a serp helm whatever u prefer/afford. Camp infinity boots if u have em and b gloves. If u wanna add another switch u can get an occult/fury or anguish depending on what u afford for range

Strong argument could be made in the case of rapier though. Like it's just blatantly an upgrade over whip in the same tier. There's nothing fundamentally different about them, it's essentially rune plate vs. addy plate on a smaller scale.

Showing him posting he finished inferno and him trying to get fire max cape removed right after

When I was a kiddo, I pronounced it "Arg-doon" because apparently I didn't bother to read the letters at all. Remember actually looking at it when I was like 13 and realizing that I'd apparently just stopped trying after literally the second letter.

No shit that‚Äôs why he commented that

I give you credit for being consistent.  And your proposal isn‚Äôt exactly ridiculous.
---
I'd have to disagree on that. Having a plus one right next to the bigger +s is a lot more convenient, location wise.
---
Yeah stop trying to mess up the game and fuck off asswipe.
---
I mean those two feelings and opinions are not mutually exclusive. Grats to him getting cape, but  you don't need that many attempts to get the cape. Even EVScape with no rigour and is otherwise shit at PVM got his in under 100 attempts.
---
Just finished mm2 for my black demon task, and got my first zenyte shard.  My bank is now at 15 mil and I've only really had 2 or 3 mil at a time before.  My question is, what should I upgrade? Closing in on 80 melee stats, 80 range, 75 combat.
---
Currently my melee setup is b gloves, dragon boots, nezzy/Slayer helm, b ring imbued, fury, fire cape, obby legs and chest, whip, d def, and Sara sword for str training.  I have god d hide chest and legs and a blowpipe.  But that's about it for ranged.  No real magic set up.  
---
I also have 50ish con but my bank won't quite get me to 83.  Just looking at what to invest in next.
---
But it's actually the same guy tho..!
---
Do you need it right now? I can do both.
---
I'd be interested in a few stats from Inferno that I'm not sure if they track - deaths to each mob or wave, percentage of shitters that used Justiciar and don't deserve their cape, number of capes gambled, overall Zuk KC

If it's something that will take a long time to do you will get another master by the time you get that level so it's usually best to just drop it. My first ever easy gave me a clue that needed a glory (on Ironman) so I dropped that one and finished several other masters by the time I got the level to make a glory.

Using the free version is one thing but still paying a subscription for that bullshit smh. Idiot pricing model.

Yeah, quest cape is nice and helps with NMZ if you decide to do that for training. Dragon Slayer 2 as your last quest makes it super rewarding too
---
That's the joke, or at least I hope it is. This sub is full of idiots though so it's hard to be sure.
---
Yeah seems like it is referring to the content/amount of bug reports you sent. What that is saying is you wouldn't be banned for simply sending in a bug report.

I think it'd be better if it was 65% instead of 75%. Since people just seem to try and poll what's in their best interest and there are so many different ways to play 75% seems way too high for a lot of game play related things.

I‚Äôm post 99 and bloodvelds with a cannon+BP in the stronghold cave is insanely good exp. I don‚Äôt know how to explain but locate your cannon in the middle room close to the eastern wall, there‚Äôs a double hit spot, then go south and you can safe spot. Your cannon is double hitting 3 bloodvelds at the same time while you‚Äôre shredding them with a BP. Usually all 3 die around the same time or if there‚Äôs just one left, quickly refill your cannon so you‚Äôre not losing dps having 2 of them not being attacked. I can go through a task of 200 bloodvelds in 30 minutes or less, it‚Äôs extremely good exp. I never did bloodvelds till I discovered my spot, I‚Äôve never seen anyone use the spot either. Given this method is expensive so if you can‚Äôt afford them, just skip them.

I think it's valuable to keep a word that means some sort of absolute (e.g. "literally") as such. If "literally" can be used to mean "figuratively" then what word exists that *just* means "literally"? Functionally, it's better to try and not have people use "literally" to mean "figuratively."

Since I've gotten a couple of comments about this being a new reddit account I just wanted to clear a couple of things up.
---
I have a fairly unique career path, and while I'm not saying it would be easy to figure out who I am on one or two things alone, I do feel that on my normal reddit account I go into details that if someone knew me they could potentially figure out who I am. Add to that some RS screenshots with parts of my IRL name in my RS usernames and it would certainly confirm my RL identity.
---
I am 100% open to confirming who I am and verifying my other reddit account and my RS username(s) with a subreddit mod/jmod, it's just not something I want to put out to the masses.
---
Your skepticism is totally fair, as I've been in the same position you're in now and I was also skeptical and dismissive. I'm not looking for anyone to believe me, I just don't have other channels to raise this up to Jagex to get something actionable. If there was an official way that I could actually speak to someone at Jagex directly without reddit/twitter then this would have never been posted.

Thank you to anyone who has been supportive AND skeptical. Either way any additional visibility is helpful.

They're obvioulsy way past making every new item a straight upgrade, which would be the only backing argument for making their level requirements scale. It's literally irrelevant what the lvl requirements of high level pvm weapons are.
---
Obviously they are aiming to make new weapons that fill smaller but useful niches, such as scythe for 3x3 and bigger monsters, and tbow for high mage lvl monsters. Believe it or not, these items are not universally best in slot even if they are very useful
---
If you don't know the difference between the real site and the fake one, chances are you don't know how to look through the code to find malicious code.

But what you are doing with this post is clearly baiting. The pro-lifers may have some skewed priorities, but they are very firm in their beliefs. I don't like to mock them.

Stare at jad the whole fight while hovering the prayer that you are not currently praying. As soon as he does an attack make sure you are praying appropriately and then immediately click the healer then rehover the prayer. Repeat for all 3 healers then attack jad again. As long as you keep yourself to one action per jad attack then it is extremely generous on time.

You're just listing more reasons rapier is clearly a higher tier weapon. They function in fundamentally the same way. There's no special passive making rapier a niche weapon and no operating cost for using it, so you can't justify its tier the way you could something like tbow, dragonhunter, or anything charged with zulrah's scales. It's just a stronger, non-degradable weapon in the same tier as a degradable weapon.
---
The fact that it's a raid drop really only makes it **more** out of place that it has the same level requirement as a slayer drop.

When the person/monster begins its animation and your pray is up at that time, that's how you know if your prayer was on time or not. If the animation already started and your pray comes up after, then it's wrong.

About a week ago, I noticed that when I logged in something on my account was different. I was wearing some gear from my bank I never actually put on and I was in a clan chat named "osrs soa" or "osrs ft" that I have never joined nor heard about before.

It's more about bashing his character. To say "guys I know I'm a bit behind the curve but I was dedicated and i finally beat the inferno!" Is one thing. Most held their tongue, because yeah it took him a bit longer but he did it and it's not like he's ragging on anyone. But now he's asking to punish players for really no reason at all but that he personally won't be affected. Now he invited the criticism. At least how I see it
---
Are you new to this sub?
---
I didn't say anything about his attempts UNTIL he made the thread asking for something that many people like be removed because he got a cape after an embarrassing amount of attempts. So yeah, fuck 'em, got what he deserved.
---
Quess ill give it a shot next time, so far for 900 or so kills ive been doing 2 ppl with whip + bgs and tank with dwh lol

---
Come on now, it's obvious that a lot of people care.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
He waited on loads of sgs specs so it indeed was well over 100 hours.
---
The difference between lvl75 and 80 is so negligible, it literally doesnt make a a difference at all
---
But whatever, Im sure your proud if your little graphic - so we'll agree to disagree
---
This is what peek parformence looks like
---
He's making it sound like he has to start the fight all over again but that's not true. The only part of jad that can be considered somewhat hard is tagging the healers. After that you just blowpipe him down.
---
Rigour will probably be better but you can't sell it once you're done with the kills. I would recommend using a DPS calc to test your two setups before making a decision though

When I was a kid I used to pronounce it Arr-doonj. Idk why.

Thats the joke.
---
Oh, right.   Yeah, truthfully all he has to do in keep an eye on the switch and then tag the healers.  He can ran back and forth to get them to line up so only one heals and attacks him.  Can be a little difficult though for more inexperienced players.
---
Can I join your Turtle club if i do?

only obvious ones i can think of is ornate pool, zenyte jewelry, 95 slay for hydra, elite void for more efficient raids.

The quest that are generally considered hard or annoying are not much harder on iron. Something that's more annoying is getting random items for fetch quests, or random ingredients for pots etc, and not having staminas till later in the game.
---
The only quest I would say is significantly harder is DS2, because you just have shit gear to do Galvek at that point. Even ME2 was not bad at all on iron in my opinion, let alone a quest like ratcatchers that is basically the same as on a normal account.
---
That said, quest rewards are usually much more impactful on an iron than it normally is, making questing much more rewarding.
---
Huh that's weird, literally just saw this episode. First one they filmed in HD. This damn sub is the whole reason I started watching TPB.
---
I have no idea, however giving the helmet, which already is BIS for almost all slayer correlated tasks, a teleport to most slayer areas, is just a bit too much. 16.67% extra damage and accuracy is quite much.
---
Whats a Christ?  Do you mean Saradomin?

48 Prayer, ~75ish HP, 6m total xp.

You made this too easy for me.

Imo the best strat is to trap them behind Jad. New players always find it scary to do but if you just pray melee on your way out he doesn't hit you at all.
---
Yes but when you 1 abuse the report system with stuff that you know isnt a bug and 2 harass and say inappropriate stuff in your fake report that is totally a different situation.

Your main post mentioned an RDT Roll as a possible incentive. You bring that up again in reply to saying Cosmetics wouldn't be an effective incentive when the argument is any incentives, especially worthwhile, are bad. So maybe try to word your point more clearly.
---
Yeah looks decent for what you need.
---
I‚Äôm not super familiar with rendimento as I believe that‚Äôs who this is, I assume he tick ate jad while flinching it to poison it?
---
ar-doyn if it's name is inspired by ardoyne in northern ireland
---
With the full context it is very right.
---
She has 99 photogenicity though wew lad

Aka your mate carried you

The full inventory of supplies says it all
---
I don't understand this sub's obsession with this lol, who cares if he just got the cape? He makes a valid point still, Jagex has rejected multiple max cape variants due to them not being BiS, why keep nom-BiS variants? We have Assembler and Accumulator max cape, where's the Ava's attractor variant? Keeping max cape variants at BiS makes sense.
---
F.
---
I‚Äôve also heard that strat but I was too much of a coward to try it for my first jad kill lol.  So when he does his attack, run through?  And then flick to melee when you‚Äôre on your way out?
---
You sound like you value karma highly and are projecting extremely hard. Tons of people use this site for entertainment, to get feed back or to create discussion... Not everyone cares about karma
---
Hey that works too. Just might take 20 mins per kill lol
---
Dammit, this means I have to keep Redberry Pies in my inventory at all times if I want to train my runecrafting.
---
If she cheated in RuneScape she will cheat on you. Be warned.
---
Lmao you‚Äôre probably not a rev pk‚Äôer becuaxe they attack literally everyone who‚Äôs killing shit. The only reason I might not attack him is because his gear is bad enough that he might not have any loot.
---
not really he was just lucky to get most kills were both 99 ranged
---
I'm blinded by the sheen of your virtue on this semi-anonymous internet forum.
---
Free RDT roll, free xp lamp, free clue scroll skip.
---
You can‚Äôt have everything beneficial on a drop table, thus cosmetics are there. Some people will want them but they have no effect. A little bit of free money or free xp once a week for voting = incentive since most people bank stand for at least 5 minutes a week anyways
---
Blowpipe is so incredibly overpowered and way above and beyond any dps weapon the game has ever seen
---
Tbow is also bad, because it is far too strong against the strongest monsters in the game, and price does not justify unrealistic and unfair power
---
"I Body Altar"
---
Yep! You stand 2 squares away from Jad and as soon as he attacks you you pray against the attack and run through Jad. His mage/range will hit you while your under Jad so as soon as you see the hitsplat you switch to pray melee. He'll either melee you on your way out or he'll mage/range and you'll have to pray against it.
---
It sounds complicated but it's only 2 clicks in total :)

TURANTS

2018, my brother said he downloaded runescape 3 but it turns out that it wouldn't run on my dad's imac from 2008 so I tried oldschool instead
---
Growing up I always said arduhnooj. No idea why
---
Everyone talking shit about him for his legit 255+ attempts when probably the majority of capes are bought with teamviewer and barely anyone even has one in the first place lmao.
---
Its a dude.
---
Not bad for your lv and hp
---
Nearing 6k I'm gonna guess his was around 2-2:10. Only going off the pic tho
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure if it‚Äôs ‚Äòjust tick eating‚Äô he could do it almost flawlessly without any failed runs. But I‚Äôm sure you would know better right, you‚Äôre the best PvMer in the game.
---

What did you change?

In all reality, I find it strange they decided to hide the poll results and then announce warding to come up for voting the week after.
---
&gt; for no real reason 
---
Upkeeping the intended 'max' nature of the BiS variants sure seems like a reasonable reason.
---
Jagex should hire them and make them work together in a group
---
Hour or two? You could get 40 fletching within like 10-20 minutes.
---
That statement gives me solid proof you are speaking out of your ass and don‚Äôt read anything.
---
What part of ‚Äú15-30 seconds per question minimum to get the incentive. You can still spam through questions if you want but no reward‚Äù do you not understand?
---
For group ironman: this could easily be done between friends by just boycotting the G.E. Seems fun
---
This but unironically. Give me back my bank sales
---
And the dark green one
---
It‚Äôs probably faster to do raids and ffa a dex than get a claw tbh.
---
Everyone knows it's pronounced Arlington Narudapesh.

All üëèüèº capes üëèüèº with üëèüèº guilds üëèüèº should üëèüèº teleport üëèüèº to üëèüèº that üëèüèº guild.
---
Except it doesn't and the majority of the community and more importantly Jagex thinks the same. Which is why they haven't been removed in 2 years and won't ever be. How will you sleep at night knowing this?
---
Congratzzz
---
Even attractive men don't do that well on Tinder, let's be real. You have to be a Henry Cavill-tier to even get like 20+ legit matches and in a really big city you're fucked regardless. Women can accumulate 500-600 matches within a couple of hours and be as picky as they want.
---
Oh yeah? Then cite *your* sources. I think it's "Ardougne". Intact I know it is, smh.
---
Would the aoe of chins be different to the aoe of barrage here?
---
And anyway, hitting someone who's hit you with aoe like that doesn't skull you, even if you weren't their actual target.

Nah that guy's being a douche, you're just not the first person to run into this car and take a pic of it haha
---
Seems reasonable, didn't know the set effects weren't allowed.
---
People getting triggered over me calling someone out who couldn't figure out what "sus" meant with context clues.

Imagine a subreddit that had people as dumb as that.. oh wait!

Ardoo√±e
---
the tasks that you burst/barrage and next to 0 magic defense, so more mage accuracy doesnt really do anything at all.
---
He might be considering switching gloves can be annoying.
---
Yes.
---
okay but when is the fletching cape's perk being made non-useless
---
My condolences man, RS helped me get through my brothers death too, if you need a friendly ear DM me.
---
Missing ardy 4, assembler, and inferno... oof.

Same

As long as you're in the basement you're not doing anything wrong. Just the nature of RNG sadly

someone make a joke about deleting all 18 cb + fire capes

Killing goblins isn't the best xp/hr for hp tbh
