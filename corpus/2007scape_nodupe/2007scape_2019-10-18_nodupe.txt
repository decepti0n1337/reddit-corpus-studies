Cant you kill bosses in bh worlds?

Definitely meet more people that smoke weed on here than cigs

As long as you‚Äôre not trying to cater to what you expect people want to see too much you shouldn‚Äôt have too many issues. I feel those who make content entirely for a viewerbase and not because they are passionate about it often feel disingenuous. 
---

---
I look forward to seeing what you have in store.
---
Why would peter pan be in osrs srsly r u dumb
---
I'm a casual pvper, maybe do it when I'm bored. The rewards offered wouldn't make me even consider going to BH. Scrap this now before anymore dev time is wasted.
---
I'm 96 hunter. I like it. It was more of a play on the fact that nobody cares about pvp
---
I‚Äôm 6 foot 1 and around 190 I‚Äôm pretty large but I only wear an L, how big are ya?
---
I'm trying to catch monkfish while I play on my console but I need my laptop to make a noise to notify me before it logs out  otherwise I forget. I have idle notifications turned on in runelite but it;s not doing anything..  I have the volume turned up.   this is a screenshot of my idle notifier settings[https://i.imgur.com/LHyDrFZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/LHyDrFZ.png)

Same here, but I feel old :(

Got my first patch of grey hairs at 24

Swampletics is only good because we get to watch a young man waste his life in greater orders of magnitude than the average filthy casual. Just saying.

I think he chooses which chunks he wants to unlocks on beforehand, no? Personally I love the concept of unlocking a random adjacent chunk, because you never know which direction the account will progress into.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Nice
---
I would love to see the random tbow spawn tile that happened with people piled up to try and take it on some wood.
---
That's actually the only reason I did it tbh, besides that for spider tasks for venenatis
---
I don't think it's necessarily bad that different areas of the game intersect
---
‚ÄúIs this WoW 2?‚Äù
---
Thanks for the input I will keep that in mind!
---
You make too much sense dude
---
get a task from nieve, and the amt of monsters you need to kill is how many dollars the art is worth
---
And meanwhile here I am remembering how someone said they can upgrade my adamant scimmy into a rune scimmy, sure enough they put a noted rune scimmy in the trade but somehow I ended up getting a noted iron scimmy instead! 
---
And then I quit. For two days maybe.
---
say that 10 times fast
---
You do realize that this means medium and small male sizes were out of stock, right?
---
This is another one of those "making fun of an exaggerated stereotype to distance yourself from it" posts.
---
Yeah I don't have enough time to put videos together that's why I would stream
---
My neighbour was legit a 7xl. If he was to bend over to pick something up his belly would touch the floor when he was a 90 degree angle.
---
so an upgrade is only what, if it makes an item suddenly become BIS? no. an upgrade is an upgrade. be it 2 max hit, 2 accuracy, or 1 accuracy, its an upgrade.
---
Sorry your new comment with your map won‚Äôt load for me but I was able to bring it up from your posted comments. 
---
That‚Äôs a really old map, I didn‚Äôt realise you were still able to play that version of osrs. I don‚Äôt think the cove quest existed with rs looked like that. 
---
What do you use to play rs?
---
Did you screenshot this on an oven
---
It's a wooden Fred

Share the luck!

At 585 kc with 3 onyxs :(

wtf is this inventory even trying to do
---
Do I need to?
---
Had no idea these had these drops, and probably didn't need to know since it's one of the rarest things period
---
reminds me of that one guy who said he used to kill zul'rah all the time in 2007, or whenever that was
---
no
---
No, we shouldn't
---
Bro your BMI is roughly 25 at that weight. You‚Äôre hardly overweight.

Nice.

Just don‚Äôt go to the houses with spam bots. Fight the power üí™

one is for when your really really really fat, the other is for when your really really really really fat

I think you will do better my friend
---
Or Romeo and Juliet
---
Are you an Ironman in real life?
---
Slayer points? =D
---
Not really an option for elite/master clues most of the time. 
---
I guess you could just bring bp
---
Lmao they would NOT think this was ‚Äúnice‚Äù
---
&gt;What? If I work for x amount of time and make $100, then buy an item for $60, that item does not effectively cost $100, it costs $60 and I have $40 to use on whatever else I want.
---
That's not a good analogy.
---
Let's say that you work for X amount of time and get $100 and a purple hat.
---
Then it changes to you working X amount of time and getting $100, but now you have to spend all $100 if you want to buy the hat.
---
In the "new option" that it changed to, you'd have to spend more time to get the same end result.
---
You can't get the bloodhound from an imp
---
Regarding lucky imps in general, I've been playing for like 2 years and think I've seen 2 lucky imps in total haha, super rare (and generally just pretty bad)
---
Yes i did, cause d chain dropped from 30-20m in that time
---
Only do it if you have a great conversational personality. No one just wants to watch you do slayer tasks as you get ready for some bossing unless you are fun to talk with
---
You‚Äôre prob right.. hopefully as a community, we exercise that which the world needs to do. Focus our collective power, and get what we all want.
---
Hazarding a guess id say it‚Äôs not worth risking the bot deaths and downtime when you can simply use the bots to farm gold another way, there‚Äôs no shortage of non wildly botting spots.
---
With ge you also won't have those sweet memories of having to spam for hours "Selling Z item"/"buying √ñ item"
---
No it wouldn't
---
Me: still salty that any ironman modes made it into a "massive multiplayer online" game.
---
go to the runelite tab of RL settings, there are options to change notification type. You want the tray notifications or sound notifications.
---
explorer's ring is fine
---
&gt;doesn‚Äôt have barrows gloves on. Tourney world confirmed
---
those floors give me a headache. They need a redesign that doesn't look blurry. It was fine in rshd
---
Out of the loop.  What is RSPS?
---
Trading before the GE was introduced was horrible. You spent more time spamming buy/sell messages than playing the fucking game.
---
Yo I only just saw this lmao. I‚Äôll still add you if you‚Äôre down
---
Come one come all!
---
His spine could be moving 10 degrees while the fat makes up the other 80, don't feel bad.
---
I told you, the simulation is on track.
---
2k planks probably won't get you to the super important levels. Assuming normal account, 70 will be good for some decent levels of restoration pool, jewellery box and i think also boosting for a spellbook swap altar.
---
Where do you get shirts that are longer based on size? Everywhere I look the sizing chart shows the width increasing but the length of an S and an XXXL is the same. I hate clothes.
---
I liked them for an hour, but then it became tedious looking at dull brown rooftops.
---
&gt;  zulrah 
---
not vork
---
I'd max my regular Ironman just for the fashion.
---
Anywhere in the US for my 27 years.
---
Pelipper is great!
---
Choosing what chunk to do next opens up an entire new game of theorycrafting and strategy.
---
I think making ironmen/regular accounts go out into the wild for good rewards is good for the game. So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to remove a viable reason for ironmen to venture into the wild.
---
No. He made a distinction between PvP and Pking. Where Pking is killing people who are not in the wilderness for the purpose of PvP. And where PvP is an engagement between 2 players who intended to fight other players. Read the whole paragraph. like he said, that distinction is really just semantics.
---
That is true! that was before the cutoff. That would definitely be bis too cause the dragon defender didn't come out till like 2015 or something
---
Lol nice reading comprehension.
---
Once again. I want to touch it
---
Support.  Why are people so enraged against them adding a world which they would never have to enter if they didn't want?
---
I will say, however, my theory is that this could never be possible.  To list a few things that Jagex would do to ruin even vanilla servers: void range nerf, g maul nerf, getting rid of aggressive randoms, ZMI alter nerf, etc.  These are things they changed about pre-07 mechanics because they thought they were outdated.  They would change them in a vanilla server too, I think.
---
He really is the kind of guy to brag about his "sports car" and it's actually a Honda Odyssey.
---
If I ever get around to doing ME2 or DS2 lol
---
Are you suro bout that
---
Why
---
Graceful reduces weight, so it does actually affect run depletion.
---
That boi better be dank and not dark.
---
I agree with most of this and I honestly had similar thoughts on the PvP weapons and armor, restricting them to PvP situations only (not PKing) would make a lot more sense than just giving an OP armor set and weapon only to people who participate in BH to just wreck shop with on everyone else.
---
Don't feel bad he was champion ballroom dancer before he put all his weight on. He was 32 stone at his biggest but could still do the splits.
---
I'm pretty sure it's only reliant on your mining level, so you could use a bronze pick if you wanted. You could try searching deeper on wiki
---
I'm 300 pounds and XXL shirts fit me just fine, occasionally they run small and I need a 3XL. I truly cannot comprehend the blanket that shirt size must be
---
What i've been doing is sit in the "Waiting for mentor" channel in we do raids until the guys in there start getting a raid going. I'm kc 2 right now and feel comfortable enough already, just give it a shot. RSN void-e-d
---
I guess woox is left out then
---
Don't worry. You only have to double your exp to get to blood rc. You should grind 71, so you can get the elite varrock diary for an additional slayer block, and no more dramen/lunar staves
---
I think it has to be an instance.
---
pickaxe tier has no impact, only mining level, so dragon pick (for the spec) is only a tiny bit better than any others. and crystal just wastes charges
---
Did they say that was a bug? Because it'd be nice to just use the crystal pick there because it looks nice and i don't have to drop an extra 6m on a d pick, but not worth it if it consumes chargews
---
If you goal is max and u have a surplus of 110m it is worth it to do mahogany tables.  There are some RNG factors in how much gp surplus you'll have maxing without alts so the best method is variable.  Time saved is time saved.
---
That logic is not incorrect if you are planning on maxing efficiently, you don't need to hoard wealth.
---
wear blessed d'hide boots noob
---
better range bonus + f a s h i o n s c a p e
---
Ash had mentioned that it wasn't a bug.
---
https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1163363279822966784?s=20
---
We really dont. I dont know a single rs3 player who actively dislikes osrs or its players. Its frustrating that they act like we choose mtx and some of them have never even logged in to rs3 and just hate it because other people say it. But yeah theres no hate
---
Skinny girls wearing really big shirts that look like a dress, good stuff
---
Don‚Äôt spend your marks on the graceful cape and/or boots yet. Get the other pieces first and buy those two pieces last. You can substitute those with boots of lightness (which you can get from temple of ikov) and spotted/spottier cape (which do have a hunter requirement, but that‚Äôs easy to achieve). 
---
Have fun on your OSRS journey :)
---
Whats his bank look like
---
so why wont they be participating? if they want points just pk
---
Roasted
---
Didnt censor your target specific stats though, good luck :)
---
LMFAO.
---
Here's one nature and three fire runes.
---
Yeah buy a pc
---
Of course you can. You can achieve 99 mining with a bronze pickaxe, but nobody does it for obvious reasons.
---
If there's a better option, people want to use it. Making those items only obtainable if you deal with a toxic game mechanic doesn't make people want to achieve the goal in an alternative way, it makes them want to quit the game.
---
It comes down to the individual
---
How is this nice?? It only has two uses left üòû
---
That isn't Bob Ross though. It's Rob Boss.
---
oh ok. I misread the parent comment. It's saying that points themselves are useless with tureal skipping.
---
Have you spoken to Oziach to enable purple chests?
---
Pretty shit tbh.
---
It's 'High Detail menu' in the Interface Styles tab.
---
The taxed GP from the duel arena is sent to have a and they sell it making them quite the fortune. Get woke
---
Might be picking up steel platebodies in the wildy?
---
If you have fairly high levels they're certainly not necessary anymore. I bring like 5 p pots and some karambwans on my ironman because it's not worth wasting brews/restores, but on a main it doesn't really matter
---
But can we dragon boots? That, is the question.
---
With what gear? With whatever the Ironman has found himself versus another account who can buy anything off the grand exchange again when he dies? A dead ironman is a fucked ironman.
---
D pick is the only one I think is an issue because of Zalcano. As for the rings/cape, people did fine without them before they were released. If you genuinely feel like quitting because the game is too hard without that extra ring you probably shouldn‚Äôt be playing in the first place. Better solution would be pvp/pve worlds. Pvp worlds stay the same. Pve has drop rate multipliers. Account locked to one or the other. No switching between pvp or pve. Go and grind venanatis on pve world with lowered drop rates for being a pussy and see how long before you think damn maybe risking 50k for this ring wasn‚Äôt so bad after all.
---
Didnt censor your saradomin brews, GG account is lost.
---
Also you have a max cape, which means your prayer is 99, see you soon :)
---
Idk if you've played rs3 recently, but Dungeoneering isn't exactly exciting.
---
The game does not have enough free space on the map to contain the amount of houses that are currently built.
---
Yea I mean its cash to me which is sweet, but its progression on an iron man
---
Absolutely correct, I stuck by wildy slayer after the tier tens, but now I‚Äôm just going to have to open all my keys hope to get a drop and never do it again.
---
So i dont normally spam when killing a single person with the clan but if it really upsets people like it does to you i think ill start lol. I thought it was a waste of time but if it really does bring the salt guess i gotta work on my pvmer trash talking. 
---
Pvmers are 100% more toxic, they have been pandered to for like 7 years mak8ng them entitled as fuck, i dont blame them its a product of the games development, pkers are toxic by default but the majority of pvmers now days are wayyyyy more toxic
---
If anything says‚Äùslim‚Äù it‚Äôs long but smaller everywhere else.
---
Y‚Äôall lying ass bitches. My posts are cleaner than most of y‚Äôalls asses
---
As well as bird houses
---
Time for a repost
---
Bit of a misunderstanding here. With the XXXXL you get sent a XXXX Gold and a L size. Sorry for the confusion.
---
off topic but my bank is a mess, I should really get tabs. This looks so organized, compared to mine, mine is terrible.
---
But a lot of them aren't rational. That's why Jagex decided to just punish the entire group.
---
Teleport out when you reach phase 2 and you can come back and it will still be in phase 2 with a refreshed inventory
---
lmfao I would never use a 3rd party client
---
For the first few days I played I called it this, my older cousin corrected me every time lol
---
Tax the GE
---
Ok now downvote me even though you know I'm right
---
He‚Äôll never grow up either! He‚Äôs a static npc
---
My parents called it that just to piss me off
---
do you use F1234 keys and press "SHIFT" to drop?
---
If you dont want to devote focus cannonballs usually make decent money, it's what I did when I first started as a member.
---
L000000l you trolling right. You dont have to do big chin if you dont want to, just train 5x slower, you dont have to do it though lol. Same for every other dnd that came out.
---
Your logic is fucking stupid. When every dnd training method is 5x better than normal training you feel fucking shit bot doing them. Shooting stars are what started a cascading affect in rs3 of dailyscape and even the devs spent the last few years trying to make rs3 less daily like.
---
No one wants to log in and do 3 hours of dailys before they can play how they actually want to.
---
Depends why??
---
‚úã | Runelite

Chillout below average wiener boi
---
No :/
---
yea you're just looking for things to whine about lol. typical/good troll
---
Well congrats on the cape and the pet! Aaaand Happy Cake Day as well!!!
---
I‚Äôm wanting the obsidian cape, but with combat stats of mid 60‚Äôs, what‚Äôs the best way to get Tokkul?
---
damn stevens.
---
I thought wildy slayer was meta for points? That has not changed at all.
---
Had no idea that non-irons did wildy slayer for the emblems, lmao. If anything, there's still a little bit of profit to be made from larran keys, even if they're knockoff konar keys.
---
Well when Jagex were getting roasted by the UK Parliament a little while ago, they very heavily leaned on the 6-hour log as a way to prove they care about the mental health of all us RS addicts. They even misled parliament a bit by inferring both games have a 6hr log, when RS3 actually has a 23hr log.
---
Ultimately, it's pointless, I've only been 6-hr logged once and I immediately logged back in. Anyone dedicated enough to hit that 6-hr limit is not going to take a break when they get logged.
---
Is it my 1 year?!  Message me and I‚Äôll add you on osrs for a gift
---
I'm almost 2k total and still not base 70s lol
---
You either do or you don't. If you do use the F1234 wouldn't it make more "logical" approach to use "QWER"  and then use "a key of your choosing such as "T" or "S" perhaps to drop items instead of the Shift key thats no where near your F-hotkeys. Also Spacebar to toggle your run on/off since your thumb rests on the spacebar?
---
Ooooh you‚Äôre the man!!!
---

---
Sorry, I guess hate is the wrong word. Loves talking about OSRS is more accurate. The majority of the top 10 posts on RS3 of all time are about osrs or comparing the games. The top 10 of all time for osrs are about the game the subreddit is about (osrs) lol. And RS3 players think osrs care about RS3, in reality, it's the other way around. RS3 is pretty obsessed with osrs for some reason.
---
It‚Äôs at least 4 hours even with the best methods and all the op plugins in Runelite for b2p alone
---
Gz
---
What's a tuna potion?
---
Lmao pures
---
Was it intentional to include yourself in this obvious  computer screenshot?
---
So you're supporting my point that RS3 players have this belief that OSRS players hate RS3 lol. We don't care, but based on the top 10 of all time of the RS3 subreddit being mainly about OSRS or comparing the game and attacking OSRS, we can see it's the opposite. Osrs players care about osrs lol, not RS3.
---
I feel that at that point, gravity is doing all the work. Whether you want it to or not.
---
Would you have an example of a streamer that caters to an audience?
---
That's the easiest room...
---
Herbi from 80-99 then?
---
Really?
---
Its ok man haters gonna hate. Dont let it bother you. PvP content is for badasses anyways.
---
Did that once. I still think about my poor lost Mark of Grace.
---
Gloves of stealth seem weird considered the theiving set.
---
Dunno what 4xl is in other parts of the world but I‚Äôm a 4-6 depending on the shirt and it‚Äôs mainly due to limitations for arms and shoulders, would fit into an xl or 2xl everywhere else. I‚Äôm around 280 pounds and 6‚Äô7.
---
Bwaawawawaawawaaaawawa
---
yet you spend your life grinding everything else in rs lmfao you people need to just admit your slight homosexuality. its fine dude 2019
---
Lmao you play on pc
---
for me hunter is one of those great on paper things. pretty good money, xp is quick but not too quick, lots of variance in ways to train but not so much that it's difficult to understand, etc
---
in practice though its just *so* fucking tedious to do. i genuinely prefer runecrafting and thieving over hunter because hunter is just constant clicking and watching, all the time, barely moving from one spot. chins especially are just absolute aids. at least with rc and thieving you don't have to watch the screen like a hawk without any breaks and you can kinda just zone out and relax and get into a rhythm.
---
i think hunter is a massively underrated skill for early/mid game money making but a complete rework of how each method of hunting actually plays would make me so happy. as it is at the moment, it's just the complete opposite of fun in any way, shape, or form at every stage of the skill.
---
Dude it‚Äôs rough I knew it was hard but getting smacked for 82 really puts you on edge.
---
pretty sure the best f2p moneymaker is telegrabbing zammy wines in the wilderness. best to just work your way to a bond and then do members stuff. but if u do go out in the wilderness to telegrab wines u can always kill other people doing it to make more money lol
---
And a small amount of cooking exp if you cut the fish instead of dropping them.
---
I really like that blood money idea, this is like an improved version of the rs3 mechanics.
---
Runes cape
---
I'm not iron so any of the drops are practically the same to be, besides the mutagen anyways. 
---
I've actually been enjoying zulrah, but I imagine it's a completely different experience as an ironman
---
1k may be a little overboard for just the con levels. Prolly like 250-300 would be enough. But let‚Äôs be real you‚Äôre gonna have to go back there every now and then so yeah I‚Äôd get used to it
---
That's what they already believe lol.
---
To you yes but shooting stars is liked as well and as said in game these are not required things you have to do and that‚Äôs farming and bird houses not Mining shoot stars which is with more people involved and you can still farm and do bird houses if you actually do those as well
---
personal opinion: don't use obby cape. Use vestment cloak/ardy cloak till u get fire cape, the pray bonus will be more useful than marginal defensive stats
---
Oof. But the 8 users do love to push the belief that OSRS players care about their game.
---
How worth it is the blowpipe when compared to a magic shortbow (i) or a dragon crossbow?
---
Mexico?
---
Wow nice art, very well done
---
That's rough. Luckily his regular drops are decent. 
---
I had a 5 steak of only getting two drops, like some scales, 3k coins, and an empty roll on the rare table
---
Yeah I'm down to 112, slowly making progress. I give it a year and I'll get to a healthier 80/90. Worth noting that even though 127 was fat as hell, was a furniture mover at the time and a good portion of it was muscle.
---
May be late, or already said. 
---
This was addressed at the MTX thing with the court. Asking how long people typically play for, if there a limit on how long you can play, etc. They mentioned the 6 hour log and it was not received well. It's likely just a precautionary measure.(I watched the whole hour long video so that you don't have to, it was boring.)
---
What will happen to points in the old shop when it closes? Will they be adjusted and transferred to the new shop or simply lost?
---
Hahaha me too.
---
If hackers know your run energy they can fill in an account recovery request and say, "I moved countries since I made the account and forgot everything including the login email address but I know it had 87% run energy on Oct 16 2019" and they'll get the account.  You can't take risks these days. 
---
(/s if you didn't get it. Reddit is idiotic and is so scared of account theft that everyone has been blocking every single detail from every screenshot.  It's a long-running paranoia/meme at this point. The guy who wrote this thread fake-blocked details just as a joke in spite of these idiots.)
---
Not today Satan
---
That isn't what he said
---
The gambling and IRL harassment alone make the fighting game, OSRS, and CS communities more toxic
---
time to chop off your leg, just in case you wanna leave
---
Why?
---
Rs3 players care a great deal about their game. Nobody is saying either community doesn't care about their game, so I don't know why you're bringing that up.
---
To get a top post on rs3 sub all you have to do is say mtx bad lol.
---
But my point still stands. People in game right now on osrs, will shit talk rs3. The same will not happen the other way around. I've proven that to you. I'll log on to both games and world hop a bit if you like and gather more screenshots if you like.
---
It doesn't matter why they dislike the game. They chose to come back to a game where they had to restart their progress. If they're upset about it, go play something else. You think osrs should have launched with cross platform profiles so your skills carry over no matter what game you're playing? You think osrs should have launched with thousands of people already maxed before they even logged into it? Of course you don't, and nobody else does either. They're different games. And by the fact that you're so insistant on how toxic rs3 player are, you're just proving my point with each comment you make.
---
Im not replying to your other comment as one wall of text is enough. Post it all in one comment and I shall reply to it all as one comment. Not having 2 conversations the same but separate with the same guy.
---
Shoulda voted yes to have multiple and stocked up on em
---
No. Just no
---
git gud
---
Side hustle
---
Yeah that‚Äôs gonna annoying for a while. But at least you‚Äôre gonna get closer to completion if that‚Äôs your goal.
---
Larrans keys are pretty much the buff dude.
---
Every new player I‚Äôve met is either on mobile or official client, I agree with the clue puzzle box solutions being removed but in reality how many casual new players go from mobile straight to runelite.
---
Once again rc with that last place finish. Me too friend
---
There‚Äôs a big difference between something that you can google and get first try without any effort and something like tick manipulation plugins or bossing plugins that, without the plugin, require quite a bit of effort to get down properly.
---
Give me one reason why we shouldn't.
---
If they go,newbies will just go to the wiki.
---
If you don‚Äôt like them you don‚Äôt need to use them. It doesn‚Äôt make it easier for anyone in any case, all that information can be open on another screen or tab anyway.
---
Seems like you havent done any raids then buddy.
---
I got stumped on the option between game and private. Was fixing to snag that tbow :(
---
Probably more than you think. If they are on social media they and go to any RS related posts they will learn about runelite.
---
I recommend that you make the challenges give points based on their difficulty/risk. Example: Killing a target without using protect item should be worth more points than not using a special attack or kill with range/magic/melee otherwise I'm sure there will be some people will skip and never do. With each being weighted in difficulty, they still may skip the challenge often, but I'm sure would be willing to try to do the challenge more than if they were all weighted the same.
---
It's a reference to boomers drinking Monster Zero,  and the fact he's looking in a mirror
---
My wife still calls it that..
---
That's interesting. I think we don't tend to remember the skinnier/normal gamers but we do remember the fatter ones so it creates a misleading impression when in fact the rates should be consistent across the population.
---
Pvp as a whole is still good. Bh is the 1 that is dead. The new bh is actually good, but guess what??? The rewards are shit. So if the rewards shit, then bh will be dead. Good rewards, then bh will be active. We need a lot alot of cosmetic costumes, emotes, rare drop items, profitable items in the reward. We literally need all of those stuff. Like I said, shit rewards = inactive bh. Good rewards = active bh. We need shit that can be unlocked in bh only. Just like how lms has these nice capes that r only available in lms. Oh yea, btw, fk the ep system .
---
In game wife?
---
idk, ask the guys over at /r/cutenoobs
---
Imbued guthix cape when?
---
Its the xp nerd
---
i would like to hope if they were to add items to the MTA they would at least give it a overhaul  of some sort.
---
Lol.. Good one.. But no.. The nagging bitch I have 3 kids with actually.. Lol.. Love her 2 death tho
---
It takes away from the integrity of the game. Find info from a 3rd party such as a Youtuber is much different then seeing the solution to every cluestep right next to the clue.
---
There‚Äôs a dad joke to be made about the title. I‚Äôm just too tired to make one...
---
There is also The Knight of Varlamore on top of Kourend castle who is Knight Solaire from Dark Souls.
---
\*Angry ironman noises\*
---
Do we tell him that agility doesn't make your run energy deplete any slower?
---
it's been a joke ever since it progressed from blocking anything other than the ign
---
Brutal black dragons. 
---
I had to look it up though.
---
Because it turned into a bunch of people just begging for shit they want or throwing a fit. It's seriously so fucking obnoxious "can we get this" is every other post
---
Source: had to stop browsing it like 3 years ago cuz of it and nothing's changed
---
That MSB is set to accurate.
---
i dont actually think its that overpowered i mostly used that phrasing to match with his comment, but it is incredibly good 
---
a few hours of wildy slayer for points, or just passively (but slower) from normal slayer, to unlock it isn't a lot to ask for how good it is. its definitely not overpriced
---
Not about hoarding. If I want 99 Con with Mahogany Tables I need 180M cash. I might be able to make 8m/hr with ToB in the future but that doesn't mean anything now if I don't have the 180M to spend. In reality it's better to invest in actual gear upgrades so I can do ToB and then do enough ToB to where cash isn't an issue and then do Mahogany Tables. But I've already done ToB at that point and made the money, I can't spend future profits on the GE based on money makers I don't have access to.
---
What you're trying to say is maxing efficiently involves unlocking the best moneymakers first which I agree with, but you can't spend as though you make 8M an hour until you actually do make 8M an hour.
---
They invented runescape
---
üò≠ please lord give this guy the pet
---
Ptsd intensifies
---
Hah. Zlabe it bruh
---
whip recolor somewhere too please.
---
Or by just getting 24 emblems from sla...oh wait.
---
Why do we even need another source? We can already get it from slayer points. Another source isn't really needed.
---
You‚Äôre as close to get the pet as you were on 1kc. Good luck pal :)
---
And their pans
---
Do I even need to explain, everyone else seemed to agree...
---
I mean they can already do that with blessed dhide boots, 32m vs 800k, pegs are still bis and the crystal is dirt cheap, there‚Äôs almost no way it tanks rangers.
---
Glum_Reaper is right. Every time a gorilla goes from melee to not melee, you have a 50/50 of having to tank a ranged hit. The extra range def of verac's skirt is very useful.
---
You think Hong Kong people claims to be distinct from Chinese isn't an ethnic issue? You think them screaming at Chinese to tell them to go back to China isn't an ethnic issue?
---
Yeah I just spent 6 hours getting boners to peaches and I already don‚Äôt wanna go back for master wand and boots
---
You bought RS3 bonds LOL
---
Early thirties.
---
please read the beginning of your previous and this comment and stop bsing lmao
---
Get out.
---
Omfg... Eye opener.. 
---
Lol. I feel bad rn.
---
should just make the Orb obtainable from an NPC through dialogue, npc tells could tell you the item has bugs/issues.
---
I agree man, but it seems the only thing fucboi normie accounts respond with is, ‚ÄúyOu ChOsE tO LiMiT yOuSeLf‚Äù
---
Wildy slayer is the fastest way to accumulate points.  What do you mean buff it?
---
Shakespeare is so overrated, imagine ripping something off of runescape and taking credit for it smh my head
---
You probably shouldn't mention the rules immediately lol
---
Nah dont use void a zulrah, normal gear is better. And in the current meta i would get void untill you have the reqs for elite void then do it in one go.
---
I saw it.
---
Did u try sharex?
---
I thought ME2 was actually going to be a real bitch but it was way better than people make it out to be. As long as you aren't an ironman, it only really takes about a half hour.
---
Ikr been apart of osrs as long as people have been pking yet people still shit on them.
---
Until jagex has an official stance against rev protection (more importantly, how ironmen abuse it) idc. YouTubers have advertised these services before, for example BAS, and it hasn't bothered most people.
---
This meme sucks.
---
Rs3 bad haha!
---
I'm making an alt for my sister to play on occasionally and I was gonna splash up to 55 but realized I can't get -65 mage with a staff in f2p?
---
need 55 magic for family crest and i wanted to do it in f2p to save bond time
---
I already did the f2p quests i need to do, this is the last req so I guess I could bond it up but I rather save the day or two itll take
---
Always banking my stuff once I log off for the day
---
With the instance, it's harder to abuse poh because one person has to stay in at all times or the instance is reset and all specs are lost.
---
Crashing is part of the game. It sucks, but you can't avoid it. You have to level up and get better gear. That's the solution.
---
I remember one of my alts back in the day I started as female specifically to save a trip to the makeover mage. I was playing efficiencyscape before it was a thing.
---
Is that Ult pure?
---
The only thing after that I want is Spirit Tree and Fairy ring combined.
---
Well I was 6 when I was 13 so...
---
hey i made that shield
---
&gt; They'd tank the prices of all current robes.
---
Good. They need to be tanked. They are *way* too expensive when compared to the price of similarly statted melee and ranged armor. It's a serious issue.
---
&gt; OSRS should not have a new skill.
---
Why? What possible reason could you have for this logic? It doesn't make sense. OSRS is **based** on the build from 2007, and it is meant to **evolve** from that point, not stay rooted there forever. If that were the case, we wouldn't have Kourend, Fossil Island or God Wars.
---
&gt; I'll always vote no.
---
And people like you are the reason that we're going to keep having these issues. Jagex could come up with an amazing skill that benefited several other skills, be fun to train, not be really expensive to train, have fun minigames and I bet you would still vote no because of some arbitrary purist mindset that does nothing but hold the game back from being better.
---
This has to be a joke
---
Did they put up an image of it? I'm not blind, I don't want a description. They're a company with overhead at this point im sure. They can make a mock up. Unless my sight is limited to this post, which at the time of this comment it is.
---
Now let's add the "I'm upset people don't vote yes to new content for me" diapers.
---
Starts out bronze - dragon but if you get rng you might get the rarer version, the one where you post stupid shit like this on reddit.
---
I pk sometimes at the rune ore.  Which can be a rush.  My only problem with pking is the gear is too expensive.  I  probably risk only 200k at most when I do slayer.  I do kill bosses sometimes and expect to get attacked since it's the wild.  But I don't fight back because I don't have the greatest gear.  If it was cheaper I would.  Maybe expand the wilderness with more areas.   Make it bigger.  Much bigger.  Add new bosses in the area.
---
Man 77 rc pretty much instantly got me 86 runecrafting, which is enough for all diaries.
---
Yeah man that sucks and getting all of those wands is shitty.
---
Don't compare that absolute internet legend to some dead meme like pewdiepie
---
Osrs hates him! Click here now to learn the tricks!
---
This concept would not be new player friendly without an easy target. If you want people to get into pking its best to have an easy target which can kill while still making you some money. Making new player jump in with the best players will most likely get them demotivated as they'll only be losing money.
---
Yes
---
But that‚Äôs just your opinion lmao. Some people genuinely enjoy it. In fact, I‚Äôd wager lots more people would admit to enjoying it without the MTX shoved in your face all the time. Why can‚Äôt everyone just play what they enjoy, accept that profits from each game helps the other, and move on with their lives lol
---
Hate to see it
---
A new ancient magic spell unlock (similar to rigour, hilt) drop would be good to keep the gp/hr on par with other raids.
---
That‚Äôs a huge waste of time lol
---
That must be snug. I'm 5'11 210lbs and 2XL is loose but looks normal on me
---
The game really slows down so much
---
man u had the best dad a runescaper could ask for
---
Good luck man that's a really nice accomplishment besides the lack of pet
---
&gt; I can't get -65 mage with a staff in f2p?
---
yeah you did say that
---
You don't know about jim jam?
---
Totally agree
---
no?
---
I didnt really check recent updates, but I saw a screenshot where you can buy emblems for 75k ea. Are these different ones?
---
They‚Äôre no longer sold on GE and both bounty worlds are now beta.
---
Jagex please significantly increase the drop rate of larrans keys, wildy slayer is dead even with the additional emblem drops
---
Plus we had the trading post that was pretty good but felt way more oldschool
---
wtf what country? I'm 5'11 200 and Large is snug on me, I can't raise my arms or bend over without my skin showing which feels uncomfortable af
---
Lmao looks like a dick n balls.  Next to your bed too? I dont wanna know what skill you're training in there lmao

Gaming in general is toxic.

Any moment now someone is gonna lose all their karma

A lot of people took it apparently
---
contact mail is bot necessary login mail btw
---
Yes, the old emblems have been converted into a different item, and you can still use them for the old shop.
---
I agree, not wholeheartedly but still. Not much community on this sub or in the game itself. Id like to have somone with a good attitude and a respect for other players to talk to and or do slayer/bossing with.
---
I have to ask, does it even still take an effort to do the Inferno or do you do it on auto-pilot?
---
Different and only on the bh beta worlds currently

Any of you guys know that quote that goes something like "if you're out on the street and someone acts like an asshole, then you met an asshole, but if you're out in the street and *everyone* is acting like an asshole, then you're actually the asshole"?
---
I don't have much else to add besides that. I've met like one person in over a year who I would say was toxic towards me for no reason. OP, if you're running into so many people that are toxic towards you, then you should consider the possibility that perhaps you're part of the problem. And if you come to this subreddit to make hysterical posts like this, I'm willing to wager that possibility is pretty likely.
---
Skeletal wyvern is one of my favourite task cause u dont need any resourxe and they have a really nice drop table! Those 3 ranarr seed is bomb (sad u didnt get one)
---
Being I wear  4xl it just looks like a scaled up shirt. On a friend of mine whose 5'4 or so the shirt goes to their knees or so.
---
I mean it does work the same way for staking. Lose 3 in a row and you're more likely to win the 4th. Basic statistics.
---
T O X I C
---
When thinking about it, getting any rdt is only just as rare as rolling rdt at all. Since it is only that first roll, landing on rdt that could give you another drop. Then its a new roll within the rdt to give you a good drop, so really it is not rare and at least not a sapphire!
---
Probs had shit points
---
Does anyone actually actively do shooting stars tho? I always just run into them by chance and its a nice surprise.
---
It's not about weight. I'm 6'6 and 4xl fits me like a normal shirt. My weight is only 270 pounds.
---
oh damn, that sucks in this case
---
Gargs have a pray req?
---
No dragon fruit? :(

lol i hope you consider some night school grammar classes :)
---
How do you know it's wave 62, its blacked out?
---
Jagex has always been fine with clue solvers, Swiftkit, Alt1, tons of other programs that simply overlay your client gave existed for 10+ years with built-in clue solvers. There are/were even sites where you could upload screenshots of the puzzles and it'll give you the fastest way to solve it. All the client does is make these resources in 1 spot, whilst keeping the player immersed in the game. If anything

this is what im enjoyan

&gt; Try to fucking read before telling people their saying "factually incorrect" stuff

they're*
---
How do you just casually do it? I've lost count of my attempts, easily over 50+ good ones. I burn through too many supplies pre-60 because I'm not fast enough at safespotting and good enough at flicking but I'm not getting better. How long did it take you to learn your first time?
---
Nice man! I got mine this week on 20 KC. Didn‚Äôt know where to share it until now since I‚Äôm a loser with no CC to call home.
---
Didn't see that part. was looking at the "lol!!!!!! :)"
---
I'm ready
---
I remember the reaction of b0aty's tob party when they were the first to kill p2 verzik and realized there's another phase, hilarious.
---
I would recommend killing Kurasks. 70 Slayer unlocks them, and they‚Äôre about 600k gp/hr, mostly noted drops, pretty afk-able, and good combat XP. Only downsides are that they‚Äôre annoying to get to and they‚Äôre might be some competition in the off task spot
---
Why don't you have a main and a pure?

Thats so goood

now can you fuck off?

&gt;actually i didnt say that

What about all the plus size ladies come on jigglechief wtf

Better yet, 29/34 for me lmao

Oh duh priest in peril. Isn‚Äôt there a bug that allows entry without finishing it?
---
Haha true and tbh i honestly thought you were the other guy, so im not downvoting you i'm downvoting him oops. Ignore my useless comment :)
---
Thats because of a meme war between this reddit and theirs. Most of the extra upvotes probably coming from r/2007scape users.
---
Be Gone Bthot
---
I already have the rune pouch, this post was made after seeing discussions from other ironmen with my thoughts on it. 
---
Although I agree that they are not useless, it was never their intent to get 22 emblems for rune arrows.
---
Nice karma farm with 2 accounts, come back with a more popular item
---
Only thing I liked about the fally rooftop is you can find random party hats throughout the course, thought it was a nice little Easter egg
---
Other than that it made me want to set my pc on fire

Youre just projecting your own thoughts onto others.

Like i dpnt know how old you are, im 24 and ever since i turnt 20 my entire social network are all up to date with current world affairs and relations, and all my mates are tradies/labourers, were not uni students/graduates just regular adults.
---
this was during a "meme war" period where both subs intermingled with eachother and upvoted funny memes on both subs. They're only top 10 on /r/runescape because it had added vote volume from the far more popular /r/2007scape. The daily top posts on /r/runescape are almost never about OSRS.j
---
You probably already knew this though, which begs the question; why are you being so disingenuous? Why are you lying and trying to spread lies? I don't get it.
---
I mean, you come to this thread to ask questions, in hopes of an answer from people who know something you don't. Now you're complaining that you got an answer from someone who knows something you don't. 
---
I think I'll stop responding here though, this was a waste of both of our time.
---
They told me I wad crazy for doing it, but I said, "Fuck you! I'll do it if it kills me!"
---
So far I'm not dead yet.
---
LUL
---
Kid thinks hes a pker because he kills bots at revs, and now he wants to kill skillers for 0 loot. Really getting sick of the clowns on this game.
---
Is this UK sizing or American sizing? There is a difference.
---
Have you tried just getting a better drop?
---
I'm sitting at 3 light frames, 1 ballista spring, 2 elite clues, 3 hard clues, and one zenny in 600 kills. Could be worse i guess
---
sounds silly sorry
---
At least 6 people I‚Äôd guess.

Congrats dude!

That's a reasonable point of view. I would be fine just introducing all the new materials and then weave the crafting methods into Runecrafting, Magic and Crafting. I would mainly just like to see a much better magic armor progression. The non-armor parts of warding are mostly neat improvements that I don't personally think are super important, but still believe they'd serve a nice niche or QoL change.
---
there‚Äôs clearly a language barrier here

Does Dorgesh-Kaan bring anything to the table after completing the quests there?

i think i just like the goblins as story characters but the city is very underdeveloped

Do people legitimately not understand how drop rates work and what they mean, or is this an attempt at humor.
---
Nice flex
---
Thank you!!
---
Not even your mvp man smh my head
---
It was me :)
---
afk rune dragons on the side. In good gear its about 1.5m/h and quite afk.
---
Excuse me, he goes by Robert now
---
Finally someone who understands statistics and probability
---
Gotten! Up top bro! üëåüòÇüëç
---
Nice I can get pepperoni AND sausage on my next pizza if I grind wildy slayer hard enough
---
I think it means you wasted all that time bc the old emblems won't work at the new store and there's no way to obtain more emblems to buy the pouch from the old store.
---
His first kill can't have been on slayer, as Zuk isn't available on slayer until 1kc
---
If you have these stats you can make 3-4m/hr. vorkath and zulrah for a couple hours and you have 2 bonds. This has been stated many many times.
---
I literally do vork on my main for 1 day to make 3 bonds for 3 of my accounts before the memeber ship runs out. 
---
Afking rune drags are you next best bet. 1.3-.15m/hr depending on how much you pay attention.
---
I need to buckle down, and go for mine now, Ahah.
---
Lmao good bait kid. Try a bit harder next time.
---
You're barely dry dude chill the fuck out
---
I mean this is all missing the bigger picture that less time spent getting RSI doing construction is worth
---
Its just clicking thing yknow
---
Aha, we'll see. I gotta get some quest done, and get my stats up,
---
50/50
---
Is there not talks of changing the death mechanics? Could have sworn I saw a fairly big thread about it.
---
Im a manly man and use ‚Äúlol!!!!!!! :)‚Äù all the time
---
You're just burnt lol calm down
---
Pvp bad go do clan wars or castle wars or LMS or bounty hunter 
---
Stop trying to bait helpless ppl in just because you can‚Äôt actually kill anyone who fights back
---
So they should add some sort of a "Ranked" mode to the Duel Arena with value brackets so that players can decide how much they want to be risking when they fight. Start the ranking based on the player's K/D ratio (if 0, place them in the middle and I guess they'll just have to lose a few games). No stress about losing items (aside from maybe some pots or bolts), plus they'll go against people of their own skill level. And it would be great for people like Framed and Torvesta because they could show their viewers just how good they are compared to other people through their ranks.
---
Thank you for the opinion
---
This is why the threshold mechanic should be a thing
---
Rewards people who dedicate a lot of time to a boss
---
Yeah minigames really need an exp buff. They don't even have to be on par with equivalent levels, just good enough. I remember playing so much stealing creation and GOP just because it was fun and novel
---
what lv hunter did u get or have from it now?
---
What is an Uyghur and why do you wish to free him/her/it?
---
thanks
---
Depends on the gear. Using neit + bandos doesn't hit -64 but adding a serp or justiciar legs does.
---
I dunno, but I can't tell if you're for or against it. The wording at the end of your comment was confusing to me, that's why I put a question mark there. Wasn't really sure what you were trying to say
---
Because why not? Only 1 role actually requires bonuses with decent def lvl and a non brain dead team
---
It was my first comment that I mistyped. By what I've said I haven't changed my stance, and neither have you.
---
The evidence was the general rs3 community agreeing that both games shit on eachother and are huge autists. Nothing could prove that more true than our comment chain.
---
Jebem ti mater
---
Gz fam. Sick grind to have completed.
---
already had 99 farming at this time and i was working on woodcutting here
---
Name checks out!
---
Ok this one legit made me laugh.
---
The gravestone discussed for osrs (early 2018) would not have a realtime timer, but a timer that only counts down if you were logged in.  Even cross-world looting of the grave was mentioned. 
---
This means you would be safe from ddos and could even take breaks after deaths. The timer would start/pause as you logged in/out. 
---
With that in mind and how many teleports are in the game I think 5min is totally fair.
---
The 5 minute timer is based off of a "starter" gravestone. You get higher timers with better gravestones theoretically speaking.
---
I completely agree with server issues and items not being given back due to a bug or server issue. But there has been cases semi recently of people getting stuff back on certain issues / events. Definitely seems to be a vase by case thing. Needs to be more consistent.
---
I'm unfamiliar with RS3s death mechanics, I'm only familiar with the gravestones as that's when I played up until. What is RS3s death mechanics? 
---
I still believe if you bring all that wealth with you you're under the understanding that there's always a chance you'll die and potentially lose it. That's why you don't always go and grab BIS unless you're certain you won't die (outside of server issues etc.) The game needs more ways of removing items from the game to sort the economy out. 
---
I also agree certain items shouldn't be always auto lost on death like your example. Whip mix or tent whips should be lost accordingly and not because something got attached to it. There's a lot of fundamentals to work on before death mechanics can even be looked at as a whole.. makes me think it won't ever get sorted.
---
I actually feel bad for you and I don‚Äôt have many emotions
---
I have 99 in both, no need to fight:) I however enjoy pvm more than skilling so I think endgame slayer is more enjoyable
---
So 2/3 of the points he made.
---
Oh Id be in favor of either buffing loot or making angler less RNG (wouldnt be against a Pest control point system) but I dont think its as bad as many seem to imply either.
---
It "only" took me 10 hours so it wasnt as bad as yours but I really felt like it wasnt too bad at all, a 10 hour, fairly afk, grind is pretty mild for osrs standards if you ask me. I mean if I werent doing trawler for 10 hours Id just be grinding something else for those 10 hours anyway
---
atleast he didn't use Justiciar
---
Can you teach us on how to do the inferno pls?
---
you could make alot of fkin money selling capes on VPN
---
Then you would have a shit show, the game isn't ready to counter ddos attacks, it used to be that some dudes abused their known hows to ddos the servers and make pvm'ers die to pick up their loot.
---
I agree death must have a penalty, but this thread is unrelated to that.
---
Shit you're right, it's only 50/50
---
How? Dead game = dead subreddkt
---
You'd be surprised. If that ladder is in tension and rooted to the ground it adds a lot to the structure. Only under significant  compression forces might it buckle, hard to tell from this angle. Of course it couldn't take the majority of the load üòÇ
---
There are apparently effective methods to get your bank pin and even your 2fa. I think crumb did a video on it. If you get hacked your pin isn't doing shit.
---
Either you get it or you don't
---
Helo it is me A Frand
---
Some players want to have fun playing this game.
---
I'm a big guy but I def wouldn't wanna mess with you lol.
---
It feels insane when it's done though! Worth the journey!
---
Why does every PvM content have to make you break even or profit? Why can‚Äôt some content be the best for X (like wildy for slayer points) and leave it at that and move on.
---
No one is being forced to do wildy slayer over Nieve/Duradel etc.
---
It feels insane though when you've done it pal. So worth it!
---
Tournament world.
---
I think gudi quit playing bronzeman mode, look up the account on the hiscores :(
---
*fedora tipping intensifies*
---
its time
---
Hahaha tyty
---
About fucking time, kinda glad it was applied to the rest of the wild. It not being announced has me concerned though.
---
F
---
Well... he is almost halfway there. Bound to happen sometime right?
---
200m xp is far less arbitrary than a random amount of kills, also skilling is usually pretty pointless post 200m since no one skills for money
---
and there is still no incentive to do firemaking
---
Thats genuinely a pretty solid idea, I like that
---
My clothes were bought in various locations around europe. It does show some skin when I raise my arms but I prefer that over baggy clothes.
---
No, but the point if 'if I skill past this threshold I will be more likely to get the pet' is still true. 
---
The fact you can be just as likely to get a pet a 1 kill and at 10k kills is silly
---
What darts are you using pal? I made sure that when i was getting to 60+ consistently I switched from rune darts to dragon and they ripped through healers in 2 rotations of the shield easy
---
TL;DR: People who don't like what I like are babies :(
---
Keep going though, you are so close
---
Shirt (t) you mean?
---
It really doesn‚Äôt honestly. Landing on the rare drop table isn‚Äôt super uncommon. Getting a specific drop from it is, but you would say the same thing if you got any roll on it
---
Take screenshots you monkey. Especially if you‚Äôre going to accuse someone of RWT. I can‚Äôt tell a god damn thing from those messages tbh. Maybe my comprehension isn‚Äôt great but idk.

Reddit is not customer support.

Neither is the customer support though

you obviously dont understand what "upgrade" means

youre already statistically going to get it, eventually

I guess this is just a difference of opinion, i respect your views, i just disagree

It looks nasty

Must be Americans with that many XL sizes available lmao

"This is killing rs"
---
Is there any reason/advantage to move your house to a different location other than remmington?
---
If you really want an item sink it has to be delt with the same way rs3 handled it... by skills or activities like invention where thousands of useless items are given a new purpose by being turned into something else.
---
I'm happy you finished but I'm going to miss you getting hilts in rice ups vids. Shit was funny
---
Fair, if you don‚Äôt have 99 slayer and use the cape I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd really get it. Once you get b2b smoke devils or spend all day trying to get a hydra task to get a b2b hydra task you‚Äôll understand. 
---
There‚Äôs only 1 other cape in the game that increases the xp/hr of the skill which is smithing ( I believe that‚Äôs the only one )
---
It‚Äôs pretty objectively good.
---
It's not stolen from you. Tou simply decided not to play.
---
MMOs are the type of game that constantly evolves and it's up to the player to adapt to the change. It's true for OSRS as well.
---
EoC was a big change done at once and not all of it was well thought out (and Jagex ended up backing out of many things, but it was too late as the people had already left).
---
How? Lol, form a queue to fight a boss since instances won't be a thing?
---
Yessir!
---
You lose nothing upon dismantling crystal tools besides any charges they held at the time of dismantling.
---
rip in piece
---
It's better than getting jumped at the burning amulet tele
---
Wait, which ones?
---
Gzzzz well deserved
---
That's how boss pets work in RS3.
---
Disappointed at no staff of balance
---
Can I ask when you started playing?  Just curious, I started in April and my stats are similar.
---
Either way, congrats!  Those are some very respectable stats.
---
smh my head. 10k skele wyvs 0 vissy

lmao my ass off bro

You're right, take away the rights of the pkers. It's time.

Perfect I put in my watch later for after work also will binge your series :) thanks
---
So when a girl plays OSRS, you should 3.14159265359 her? 
---
I still don't get it.
---
Don't try to trick me.  You're just a Monsanto shill trying to build a realistic reddit account by killing Zuk 150 times.
---
If I remember from when I played RS2, the Draconic Visage is/was such a rare drop that people who were trying to get it as a drop would go massively dry and post about it. Some trolls came up with the idea that you need to talk to the Dragon Slayer NPC Oziach about the visage before you could get it as a drop to annoy the person going dry. Since then it's just become a meme to talk to Oziach for anything else that is rare like pets/dragon warhammer/third age/etc.
---
Ayyyy
---
Everything is on separate pictures, meaning they can be unrelated.
---
None of them show the username.
---
None of them show an accepted trade.
---
All of these pictures together looks bad. But they are still individual pictures with nothing tying them together aside from you posting them as a group.
---
That being said, Jagex doesn't really care much about gold buyers, it's the gold sellers that they go after.
---
That also being said, jagex only cares about rwt when they don't get their cut. That's why they added bonds.
---
you used supplies so no gz
---
Nice Chin Pet
---
Wiki says 230k xp/hr maximum without banking.
---
People say as many bosses as possible but I found that a bunch can really slow you down. I would do a round and then delete the bosses that took longer than usual to kill
---
well you cantry the NPC in lumbi near the gate. other option would be the 1250 slay points
---
Or you could get teleported once every ten minutes and get 1.2m/hr
---
Thanks for posting the 7 most commonly parroted fallacious responses.
---
magic is generally not considered a noncombat skill, even lunar spells
---
Everything about this screenshot hurts me
---
You can still trade in capes
---
Damn that's an old picture.
---
Why would people choose platebodies? If it's determined by GE value, and you have to buy the items from the GE, then any item is equally valid.
---
Tourney worlds
---
I don‚Äôt really give a shit, as long as there is a Wildy I will expand my collection of spades and 1 charge glories.
---
So now I need to grind another 1250 points?
---
Nobody is forcing you to do anything.
---
You go from pvm deaths to devalued dragon axe, these arent related issues in the slightest
---
Then dont go into multi areas on your own.
---
No furries allowed.

---
&gt;the odds of not getting a dice roll after a set number of attempts decreases as you continue to roll the dice
---
This is paradoxical. Your odds of not getting a success after 10 tries, will decrease if you try more than 10 times? If you try more than 10 times you're not doing the same thing anymore.
---
Reward points don't exactly correlate with the percentages. 880 points equals 87.0% and no bolt racks. 881 points is 87.1% with bolt racks, so I guess the percentages shown (by either runelite or vanilla client idk) are round up.
---
Sadly yes. Better bank all you stuff next time you enter the wildy just in case. never risk more than a spade....
---
Cool.
---
2 days is rookie numbers my friend
---
Nice, how long did that take to bot?
---
Kinda lame because it has rs3 in the label or kinda lame because you simply don't like having a fair chance at a drop after a significant amount of time is invested?
---
Possible, but a lot of content that's been out for a while doesn't really get done too much by HCIM. I've just never seen any other HCIM with the item.
---
That's... kind of disingenuous. You want the best money in OSRS? Do revs. You wanna fight the actually quite fun bosses in the Wildy? Tough crap. You wanna do the best slayer points per hour?
---
True, we're not 'forced', but to PvMers, just feels like fun is locked behind assholes.
---
I believe that is how it was intended to work since release, but a glitch caused normal PVM death mechanics to override them. There might've been a ninja update recently to fix the glitch since I tested them about a month ago and wildy pvm deaths were the same as non-wildy.
---
Read: just have 83 con nubs
---
I have yet to get hacked since the start of osrs... what people do even do to get their accounts hacked?
---
I like the idea of different methods having different pet rates. It seems very boring having a flat time rate across every skill. 2007 is cool specifically because people can either 1)train the skill efficiently or 2) get pet as fast as possible
---
Just my opinion

It took me 407 kc to do. I didn't gain any combat xp doing this. My friend's Sam Irl and Anyssa helped me with every single kill
---
420 for the survey and 69 for the follow up in depth screening duh
---
Burning redwoods is over 500k exp/hr, but I think todt is best until level 90
---
at 90+ it's ~520k/hr burning redwood logs
---
Max cape is for stained chairs. Keep those clean my mate! ;)
---
And still, ‚Äúthe game was ruined‚Äù is just your opinion. Here, you probably have quite a few people who would agree with you, but there are still thousands who disagree. What does majority matter in a place like this? Just shut the fuck up, play the game you like, and move on. The whole rs3 bad or osrs bad schtick is growing so tiresome. Who honestly fucking cares to this extent. Hate a game? Lucky for you that no one forces you to play it!
---
If you don't enjoy the game don't play it??? Why should the game be catered to what you enjoy when you don't even engage with the content lmfao
---
Use a cemetery tab
---
Lol, even if it was subpar construction xp, I would still do it.
---
Probably because it is a cosmetic - if an ironman is going to zalcano it will likely be for the crystal pickaxe
---
Damn i was joking sensitive ass people lol
---
Tears of joy!!
---
Didn‚Äôt he talk to Oziach?
---
Yes!
---
really they removed the emblem? does this mean you have to grind for the emblem and can't just buy it off ge for bounty points?
---
:)
---
Exactly! I don't need the new meta, it doesn't need to match oak larders.
---
You could make separate gardens tho right?
---
Bone crossbow is very good for low-level ranged training on the cheap. And the ancient mace is useful in certain pking situations and can be good for slayer.
---
It took me 407 kc to do, so I went a little dry. No combat experience was gained, obviously. Sam Irl and Anyssa/Lalo (The most respected UIM) helped me with every kill
---
Only true for the inferno.
---
RrrrRRRuFLLLed'f
---
how else was I supposed to yeet it across the room into my laundry basket? Cmon bro that was half the fun.
---
I agree, but I think the last Q&amp;A mentioned looking into adding msb (i) and row (i) somewhere to make it accessible for ironmen. Correct me if I'm wrong on that please.
---
For sure dude, I just haven't seen anyone with either so I figured I'd ask on reddit, where the achievements were most likely to have been posted, though a lot of people seem to be downvoting it for some reason when I am simply asking a question lol.

It's impossible to get EHP at todt actually

I see at least one "RS3 bad" post a week on here so yeah I'm with you. Unless /r/runescape just posts the opposite when I'm not checking the sub they really dont give a shit about OSRS compared to this subs weird validation obsession
---
Then you missclick and half the time by the time you reclick, spider is on you. Did you not see the screenshot I posted of how small clients are on my monitor? Very easy to missclick when the spider is 4 pixels wide lol. Same with mobile.
---
It's a good point about PvPers having to quest to get pures and stuff, but ya haven't really answered the OPs point about how PKing is just hitting a punching bag.
---
Does anyone really benefit from PKing? I've been Pk'd about 100 times in my RS career, and I assure you the PKer made probably &gt;20k in food and random cheap weapons. So I feel irritated cause I have to walk back to the place where I was, and the Pker, what? Feels some gloating satisfaction that they put someone ten minutes out of their way? Just seems like bad game design imo.
---
this is a joke.. jagex really doesn't give a fuck about pvp and its sad
---
Combat is not Skilling. The whole "gathering" thing isn't pertinent
---
Honestly, people like you are the problem with PvP. Tasks are something extra, to give you a little bit extra loot/profit and so are bounty hunter points and the store. When I started PKing we did it because it's a lot more fun than grinding boring skills and repetitive stuff 24/7, what you pked and if you profited or not depended on what you/your opponents risked. Now people are expecting PKing to be easy kills, easy money and comparable to bossing gp/h wise, like come on lmao. 
---
If you think these tasks are "tedious" or difficult I have two words for you - git gud. Personally I can't wait till it's live to try it out.
---
Thankfully they have added the archaic emblems into the loot table now, it probably will be removed after the beta finishes.
---
Yes it does, smithing unlocks happen at way too high levels. Rs3s mining and smithing rework solved this, however this wouldn't fit into osrs at all.
---
A child makes your pp hard?
---
1250 slayer points is 4 hours of wildy slayer, people really exaggerate how much it is. They'll spend 1k points on a cosmetic override but not 1250 on one of the strongest items in the game?
---
Except it would. Low to mid level magic far out-dpses melee and ranged. You get a much higher max hit much earlier, which also means it levels much faster as well. You could cement that early to mid-level dominance even further by offering niche/alternative gear at low to mid levels.
---
The issue is at the endgame. Which is, apparently, an issue in RS3 as well. But at least in RS3, you have healing and strong utility spells that create interesting strategies and you can abuse weapon swapping for higher damage output. It still doesn't hold up to melee and ranged, but the gap isn't as big and you get things in combat that melee and ranged cannot.
---
I think because PvP polls failed so often, that they decided to take matters into their own hands.
---
raids has been a piece of content ive wanted to do for a while so ill probably hit them up after getting void of which ive begun doing
---
Should be prayer protect from mage cause that boii be casting spells on my heart
---
Well that's how the odds for this drop works. Chance and statistics aren't the same for every situation, like for example if you were to pick a ball out of a bag of 150 and there was one blue. Eventually, you'd grab the blue one.
---
I just stand on the pile till all the mobs move and then loot by clicking
---
Rc guild is naturally the place to get 99 also gz!
---
Ah yes because everyone enjoys pest control so much
---
It's not gonna pass a poll to become tradeable because people won't want to lose it on death.
---
Well, after re-reading his comment he was responding to jagex saying dagon'hai and msb + row scrolls will be Slayer rewards.  They are right. Jagex is taking a massive dump on wildy Slayer, which in turn dumps on wildy PVP
---
Pet is 1/65 with any item. Kodai is around 2% drop rarity, same as Tbow and Elder Maul
---
?? Void range is bis, should that be tradable? Should the infernal cape be tradable? Maybe the assembler and ma2 capes too?
---
if it got denied so quickly i can only imagine it was because your recovery answers didn't match.
---
The likelihood that he would have gotten one increases, but the likelihood that he will get one on his next attempt is still the drop rate.
---
If your weight is less than 0 it's still just 0.
---
So basically dont do what Pvmer's are doing.
---
22k
---
Jagex put them back on the drop table until the bh beta ends
---
Disagree, Wildy Slayer is the only PVM which is risky - thus the rewards should reflect that. Everything else in the Wildy isn‚Äôt with doing off task.
---
Do your diaries, and choose what quests to do based on the diary requirement yout working on. Great way to diversify the game!
---
Just go for Quest Cape at this point.
---
A good mother will never ask these questions
---
It‚Äôs all risk versus reward, so why do wildy slayer now with now less reward when I can get less points but more of everything else doing duradel and also not worrying about being pk‚Äôd

The only requirements are the Bone Boyage quest and level 5 hunter. You can get from 1-9 hunter in 5 minutes by doing the museum history quiz in the varrock museum. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Natural_history_quiz
---
No
---
Applies to p2p only but use w330 for teleports and duelling rings for clan wars. Also don't neglect quests and diaries.
---
Kalephite Shades. 
---
They can only be hurt by a hybrid weapon of the Gadderhammer and the Keris, thus requiring Contact! and In Aid of the Merque to be killed. 
---
They'd have extremely high hitpoints (like 1000+) but the Gadderdagger (patent pending) would have a 10-20% chance of deal 5x damage and would be pretty crazy. 
---
Before you get the final hit, they split into two smaller monsters that have to be chased and killed, else they'll reform with full hitpoints. They'd also venom and have a prayer point draining attack.
---
Their only drop is a guaranteed 'Shaded Carapace'. You take it to the desert to burn in the sunlight, after which you get your drops, + Firemaking/Prayer XP. Rare drop includes a 'Blessed Beetlehide plate' best in slot chest piece for prayer bonus, boasting a +10, but negative ranged defense bonus and only slight melee and magic bonus.
---
When i click the check option on the slay helm, it says: ''You're assingned to kill TzTok-Jad; only 1 more to go.''
---
And when getting this task I got a text promt from the slay master to choose from other tztok thingies (just the basic ones) or Jad
---
Fuck ironmen
---
You need to turn on desert treasure bosses for the extra points from Dream Mentor bosses 
---
Understand that it is significantly less AFK but I usually get 800-900k points per hour
---
Fuck.. me... I started spending points on fucking tabs. Because Jagex can‚Äôt release an update properly.
---
Most deserved scythe I‚Äôve ever seen lol. What‚Äôs your next goal?
---
I mean yes, it still is risk vs reward. Turael boosting takes 50% longer to get a rune pouch than wildy slayer and you make less money in the process
---
The good part of the equation is that you can also get the pet your next kill or even first kill.
---
Fuck you kid
---
Since the blowpipe is a short range weapon you may want to briefly put it on the longrange attack style once healers spawn so you don‚Äôt accidently get dragged into jad‚Äôs melle range (and get 1 hit)
---
having tap 2 drop on allowes you to tap ess pouch to empty
---
I read all of this post just so I could respond, like you said.
---
REGRET.
---
Please, if you're going to post something in seriousness, maintain emotional control and use proper grammar. The structure of the post progressively breaks down until it's just one fuming run-on sentence that is nearly illegible.
---
If there's a point to be made other than that you're spiteful against pvmers, it was totally missed. Lots of rambling and emotionally charged complaints. I don't see much of anything else.
---
Turn on desert treasure bosses to get points. Inadequacy gives like 70k points for killing it ONLY IF Desert treasure bosses are on
---
Well then do agility, or other things, between games until 90 firemaking lol
---
Operation rake in the lake is a go

Thank you

---
Na
---
Noted. :p
---
Contextually, saying "I had fun" is pretty meaningless, so I assume you are meaning it in a way that is an impactful argument, which is also how you wrote it. It's irrelevant though.
---
You say "I had fun".
---
I say "The vast majority if people did not have fun".
---
Which holds more weight?
---
Definitely.
---
Kings ransom unlocks Piety, roving elves for western province hard diary, haunted mines just easy quest for a Salve amulet
---
3t chins and trap resetting is actually one of the more interactive skilling methods in the game.
---
Now, there's really no need for that kind of language. I never PK myself, but in the hundreds of videos I've watched, I don't think I've seen anyone use the rune pouch in a PK scenario outside of meme risk fights. Iirc it costs more then half a million GP and is always lost on death in the wilderness.
---
And if there was a good place to put the herb sack as a reward from herblore, then yes. I think that would make more sense.
---
Corp alt specing isn‚Äôt fixed. And ignoring problems isn‚Äôt good, stop talking you evidently don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.

Kind of a matter of perspective. Its around a 60 hr grind of very little interest or attention. If anything it feels like im just waiting for it to be over. Hit 82 last night.

That‚Äôs fair, and respectable. I wish that a lot of it was fixed for what it‚Äôs worth. But sadly I can‚Äôt see it happening.
---
I mean your title says you wanna do quests and I see quests available to you so... go do them?

Or they would be playing on a tournament world.

You‚Äôve got to understand a lot of pkers are really bad. Numbers outweigh skill.
---
Gallows right after 99 RC? This is top efficiency, so 200M when?
---
Thats my point tho.
---
They have dozens of people to instantly freeze and spec. 
---
I'm saying numbers will fuck you.
---
Yes youtube ‚Äúitaly rock‚Äù and that will solve all your problems.
---
Watch a guide, you dont need guthans, where are your range pots?
---
Depending on your range lvl you can use dragon darts in the blowpipe for the jad fight to out DPS the healers (80 and up).
---
Use chins to aggro healers (keep attacking jad with chins, the AOE damage will hit the healers) if you dont have the range lvl to out DPS the healers.
---
JAD spawns where the orange mage spawns, so make sure to be beside him when he dies to insure having the correct prayer right off the bat.
---
Make sure to have full prayer and HP when killing orange mage to not have to boost stats during jad fight. 
---
Use blessed dhide instead of karils for the prayer bonus (veracs skirt is good too)
---
Get rid of d boots and use blessed boots, 
---
Archer ring imbued is also good.
---
Get barrows gloves.
---
OP's post is a perfect example of nearly unintelligible ranting that serves no purpose other than to further widen the divide between the pvm and pvp community.
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
I can't get myself to complete a cox run and you have 3k tob runs...
---
I'm the highest with 81 and plan is to get 99
---
Explain why it says challenge while I‚Äôm still in the duel then
---
RS3 came out before OSRS, it got the label RS3 after OSRS was released to distinguish the two
---
No I disconnected going into the stake and still had the option to challenge him in the stake.
---
Oh shit the man himself, that's impressive as fuck dude.
---
Haunted mine, mate!
---
Not sure how I'm 'wrong' since I'm not talking about that and it's not pertinent to my scenario.
---
Can you temple trek for slayer xp like the swamp man?
---
that is runescape 3 not old school
---
Exactly! Definitely the reason I use them.
---
Yep exactly, a few things I do bank like scroll book, achievement diary cape, but for the majority its all just throwaways (ring of dueling, games neck, burning ammy etc) that saves myself some time regearing whenever I get wildy steps.
---
I‚Äôm just giving my critique of this new system, not at all advocating that pvp should be more profitable/farmable. But if challenges for extra points are to become a legit part of the BH gameplay cycle, then they should at least be fun and fairly achievable. It‚Äôs a game after all. Getting a kill with no prayer or stat boosting potions is the definition of a tedious pk task, it‚Äôs no different from normal pking but your hits are trash. With the current metas in pvp, most of the tasks will be quite hard to complete in a ‚Äúworth it‚Äù amount of time for a good pker, never mind a noob. Tasks should ideally add some fun spice (risk, variety, etc) but not just be pointlessly difficult. Their stated limitation that they can‚Äôt make gear related tasks sucks because that would be the best avenue for variety. One other option for a good task would be to get a kill on a particular spellbook and maybe offer to automatically switch the spellbook for you
---
Ah this explains why I don‚Äôt know. For I don‚Äôt really like to PK.
---
Once again, Id be in favor of buffing it
---
I just think its not *that* bad as it is.
---
Wow Gratz bro finallyyyyy!!!! Saw the video with juanmanraid when he got it on such low ice with you in the team that was so painful to watch for all parties involved! RNG is such a bitch!
---
That is a terrible rebuttal to loot keys. I can think of a million other updates which accommodate other aspects of the game in this fashion.
---
I love the game, but I don't love runecrafting
---
You really like to ignore the main concept of my comments and draw unrelated conclusions.
---
Yeah! It's definitely a challenge and takes a fair amount of time (I started with suboptimal stats). I like the risk of the Wildy to a certain extent, although it does suck when a maxed main decides to unload on you lol. I've escaped most pkers by logging out quickly, I've x-logged a couple of times and sometimes you can just get away pretty easily by running. 
---
I do pray flick most tasks, that's something I don't really want to do for the regular slayer grind, but I have found it to be worthwhile if you are going to melee in the Wildy.
---
For example at 99 farming seaweed is 1/5000 for tangle compared to 1/7500. I don't find that minimal myself.
---
I‚Äôll never understand them..
---
16,766.
---
Make a new account that will get slaughtered.
---
Check out mintmadcows streams and CC, they generally follow the ‚Äúif you can fight, you can kill‚Äù mentality of just a bunch of random nubs slapping peoples shit up in the Wildy.
---
Lmao
---
I don‚Äôt agree with you; however, thank you for your opinion.
---
Compound probability is just how you calculate the chance of multiple independent events succeeding/failing. In this case an example would be "I'm gonna do the boss 150 times. What are my chances of getting the drop". If you decide before your first attempt to kill it 151 times instead your chances that you will get the drop after those attempts is higher, sure. For someone who already tried 150 times and failed, that doesn't matter.
---
Also probability certainly matters to the individual, that's how you can know playing the lottery is a bad idea.
---
no time when u going for max
---
They have done this already and they failed. You don‚Äôt need to poll items separately because items have a niche. You won‚Äôt use highly degradable items in PvM or bossing, nor would you use niche weapons catered to PvP. It‚Äôs the polls they need to fix.
---
All boosts are on the same global timer, that includes stews, potions, etc. Every 60 seconds every boosted stat will drop down by one level. If you have preserve active they'll drop every 90 seconds instead.
---
The trick is you don't know exactly when that 60 seconds is up. If you drink at the wrong time you could get a +5 boost and then drop to +4 one second later. The most reliable way to figure it out is boost another stat (like drinking a super defence pot), then as soon as that ticks down you know you've got 60 seconds.
---
the good old days
---
&gt;It‚Äôs the only Skill which focuses primarily in a dangerous area of the game.
---
This isn't true. Slayer isn't primarily in a dangerous part of the game. One method (higher gp/hour lower xp/hour) is in the wildy but that's not the primary focus of the skill. Other skills have wildy options as well. Dark crabs, runite ore, wildy agility and a few bosses are options for money making/training skills in the wildy
---
I've revealed how much of a casual I am
---
am actually sandpaper
---
Dont trust anyone trading you shit or asking you to do stuff, scamming and luring are still a thing and people can be sneaky af making you think youre anti-anti-scamming someone then boom somehow your banks gone. 
---
Set up google auth and a bank pin. 
---
Dont ever gamble, winning makes everything in the game boring and loseing make you miserable.
---
Use the forums or discord to find a noob/returning player friendly clan, you then will always have a place to ask questions as they come up and see other people asking questions you might not know to ask.
---
Enjoy the game as much as you can, always set short term and long term goals to tick off. This will get you that constant feed of dopamine. Its also a good way to stay motivated and avoid burnt out. 
---
Vote yes to pvp updates.
---
Each minute all your stats will regenerate with exactly one level. This 1min (of 90sec if using preserve) cycle loops continually, even when you don't have a boost. 
---
To make sure you get the longest boost, try to drink a cheap potion (attack for example) and watch (in RuneLite for example) how long this boost lasts for. Since each boost uses the same timer, this timer will tell you how long you have untill the +5 goes to a +4. If you feel like this timer is too short, wait for the next cycle. If you feel like this would suffice, try to get the +5 boost now. 
---
You used to be able to log out whilst having a +5 boost and log back in without actually 'changing' this timer for 12 seconds I think. So if you were quick, you could use this boost as long as you want. I think this is fixed now, but I'm not 100% sure if this is still correct.

Wow how did you do this!

what are you on about?

Impressive! Nice account you have. Congrats!

Unless he gained access before they updated that
---
If there's money to be made, botters would bot it. Also, if its a rare or slim chance of getting to the extent its not worth botting, then it's not a big enough update to fix pvp. A slim chance of getting 100k-300k wouldn't fix a dying pvp.
---
start an ironman
---
Do you even own bro? Wtf
---
Rip in pieces
---
Ya,  maybe. Tarnished metal and wet wood look similar in a grainy photo. In all likelihood the ladder does nothing here and it's just a couple strong legs doing the work.
---
If you give the guy a high leveled herb you can get a potion of that herb from him. Used by a lot of iron men
---
I appreciate them being hotfixed back into the slayer table, but why remove the ability to trade these items? Its not something that ANYONE knew would happen. Seems quite unfair to people who invested in them or had stacks of them
---
Know how to spell too.
---
Yeah, I overlooked those by mistake. A better way of saying it would have been; only skilling which largely exists in the Wilderness.
---
It is gonna be a great journey
---
Neat idea!
---
Drunken Dwarf: Ugthanki Kebab instead of regular
---
Sandwich Lady: Offers Gourmet versions of the existing selection that heal higher
---
Hyde: Strength potion become Super Strength potion (becomes Super Combat potion??)
---
Maze, Genie and Dunce: Remains as is
---
All others: Coins and items scale up to a cap of 50,000
---
Try setting a goal for yourself. I told myself I‚Äôd go for inferno and everything I would need for that just started to become what I worked towards. You‚Äôll wanna play if you feel like you‚Äôre building towards something specific.
---
King rippers
---
Sounds perfect! Thanks :)
---
On the Dr Jekyll one, he gives out potions based on what herb he asks for, if you don‚Äôt give him anything you get a strength pot anyway.
---
Say he asks for a cadantine, you get a 4 dose super restore.
---
Hybrid non-BiS armor is a great idea for a raids reward.
---
Will they be completely removed or will they become discontinued items?
---
Thanks chief.
---
Bruh what you meant ain‚Äôt what you said.  10hp irons are a different thing
---
They are also largely useless so its a terrible comparison no one really cares about them.
---
I'm pretty sure sit comes from your toon hitting the floor when dying.
---
HCIM btw.
---
Items like rubber chicken that gives negative attack bonuses is my guess.
---
IDK I just walk into the pker and let it happen it's just a slight annoyance.
---
Wildy pk just seems terrible with all the bots around
---
Hards are not great from my experience üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt appreciate this post
---
They should be marked in the skill guide though
---
It's so refreshing to see actual achievements like this instead of the same old "no friends to share my failure fire cape with gimme attention plz". Fucking gz my dude. You're an actual legend. :)
---
thats the good stuff

Thank you for being such a savage in the OSRS streets man.

Clever
---
To add on to what the below comment said, you can actually melee Glough pretty easily with a whip, ddef and bgloves, he does less melee damage in his final form than anything else.
---
But yeah, it‚Äôs easy with a dbow.
---
Hard mechanics lol. The only thing hard about this game is becoming a good brid.
---
imagine being fat unironically in 2019
---
Isn‚Äôt drop rate 1/3k?
---
You can try it on mine 2!! Double the luck
---
it just depends on the situation, im lazy and cheap and ill sacrifice dps for afk. like for suqah, you never need to use pray pots which i find nice.  definitely not the most efficient tho
---
Yeah there‚Äôs not much, but what there is, is ruined by 3rd party clients, AHK etc.
---
Good thing you hid your RSN man really don‚Äôt want people to get a hold of that LMAO. Like why do people do this, anyone can see your name IN GAME.
---
Yeah, easily. You can find plenty of examples on Reddit or elsewhere. Pet rates are usually 20-70m xp, so it's not that surprising.
---
peoples ash obsession is going into a weird place now.
---
thos
---
I'm new to OSRS too, but my guess is it's not that good because 1) DPS is better, 2) there's no Soul Split for endless life on Slayer mobs, 3) a lot of people prayer flick anyway, and 4) kills are slow almost everywhere, so the prayer regen is much smaller.
---
You can drag them using the "Alt" button I believe.
---
However they will wrap and look weird, you can adjust the size of the boxes and how many per column/row, and whether you want them vertically under the "RuneLite" settings at the very bottom
---
If you were to not getting any XP gathering it, and lowered to maybe 2/3k / hour, sure. (Not sure how many /hr you get actually mining essence) 
---
At 10k / hour it‚Äôll take only a couple hours to gather enough essence for 77 runecrafting which is way too quick.
---
&gt;a non brain dead team
---
On w306? Does not compute
---
What a chad
---
agreed
---
Tan leather is like 1m+ an hour and 130k mage xp. I bet it's used more often than any diary locked shortcut in the game.
---
Exactly how I feel. I was on my way out of playing this game already, not logging in except maybe once a week. Poor updates like this makes it pretty easy to just forget about this game, especially when the wild is already dead and this will probably do more to kill it than revive it on the BH world.
---
Like my biggest thing is the new emblem system is garbage. It‚Äôs a zero-sum game and your opponent HAS to be risking the same emblem. What‚Äôs the point? The whole point of the previous system was that PvP actually generates wealth in the game which was an incentive to do it. Since this is a zero-sum game now, no wealth is actually generated. Now the wealth generation is in the point system. Okay, so 5 points will be equal to 100k. I really doubt I‚Äôll ever make more than 200k per hour then, at best. That‚Äôs garbage. Bots and farmers will continue to make the money on BH. Then there‚Äôs the rune pouch and looting bag. The current price puts the looting bag at 1.5m so not only is BH going to be garbage, but actual PKing requires risking 3x as much just to save two inventory slots (essential in deep wild).
---
Damn, what kind?
---
You can't split a pet drop
---
That‚Äôs the entire point of Ironman. You chose to limit yourself. Don‚Äôt like participating in the content? Don‚Äôt do it.
---
Fun weapons? Just speculating.
---
That sounds right. Thanks!
---
true, shilo shortcut in comparison is extremely useful, i hadn't gotten around to using it once but i can already imagine the possibilities..

I just posted this and got down voted. How did ANY one read all that in 20 seconds?
---
Dude I've been following this community since osrs released and at this point, I find it laughable that people even make posts like this anymore. It's clear that jagex doesn't give a fuck. I stopped giving money to jagex a long time ago because I'm sick of fueling their business model.
---
Face the facts: you invest your free time and money into a shitty game made by a ragtag team which is owned by a scumbag company. Nothing will change in your favor and you'll prove it to yourself by continuing to to play despite the fact that you're unhappy with the business. Because at the end of the day, they know YOU'RE addicted and will keep paying them because you don't put your desire for a better jagex before your addiction to the game.
---
Fascinating.
---
Apparently you also liked meth a little too much
---
My f2p skiller was hacked and I still don't know why. But they changed the email somehow and added an authenticator so I can't get it back.
---
Okay fair, but it‚Äôs also trivial to randomize the click interval after every click. I‚Äôm not saying I do this, just that I‚Äôm curious how they prevent this.
---
Haha, yes it is.
---
What I meant by the post is that, the Jars of Decay are also 1/3000... but I got three of those instead.   
---
I've also gotten a uncut ruby drop.. which is like 1/3072.
---
I'm lucky with rare drops, unlucky they aren't the pet.
---
naw
---
yeah I am, client is allowed since jagex hasn't stated anything about pvp but I thought it was a cool hit to get 98 str on
---
I would say just bring a PvP counsel and get them to vote, same with PvM. Streamer/you tubers for example, I trust those to make the right choices as they‚Äôre not brain dead and actually know what they‚Äôre doing when it comes to the game
---
It‚Äôs not bad if you get in with the ‚Äúcool‚Äù kids that sit in the nw corner
---
Im callin the FBI on this one, leave our poor gnome child alone.
---
Try 500 lol
---
I'm pretty sure every fun weapon always hit 0, following splashing negative bonus where ur magic needs to be -65 to always splash, fun weapons give you -100 slash/stab and -50 crush also -10 strength
---
maybe base it off mining level like volcanic ash mining. yeah 10k does seem like too much. Maybe max it out at 5k with 90+ mining
---
That's what I'm doing right now. Palm trees, hespori, and some farming contracts. I'm surprised trees like mahogany aren't more popular. Long grow time, but great exp and you grow 3 right next to each other!
---
What is EHP?
---
yeah I won 30m
---
Truth hurts, but because it‚Äôs true doesn‚Äôt mean you should give up, but soon many others like yourself will, and then the toxic community will realise. But one upvote could make a world of difference to be heard. It‚Äôs worth a try before it‚Äôs over forever.
---
Yeah that‚Äôd work. Add diaries to it or such, higher tier diary, more essence /hour. I like it
---
Can you imagine if the SoTE library was procedurally generated for every player?
---
Please don‚Äôt add this update into the game... Go back to the drawing board. I don‚Äôt know why you guys even pushed ahead with coding these updates when there wasn‚Äôt positive feedback on the blog post. 
---
Keep some things like the 20 second immunity timer though.
---
One that‚Äôs connected to all herb patches in game
---
98 str on a k0
---
Dang. On both of my accounts, I got my woodcutting pet from 13-17m exp. Didn't realize the drop rate was that bad for most pets.
---
1/9.2 for the team, assuming he has no mvp points and no deaths he gets 18/86 in a 4man which is around 21% after the initial 1/9.2 for a total of ~2.3%.
---
Scythe is 1/19 after a purple(2.3%) so 0.12% for a scuyhe or about a 1/833 for a scythe
---
Going almost 3 tines that is unlucky but not crazy
---
still would dismiss, the random events are just disguiser bot finders, they shouldnt be used for anything else, as for food, i just use bones to peaches
---
revs are only "the best moneymaker" because of the inherent risk associated with being in the wildy.......

runecraft bad, heart disease good

My mom woulda beat my ass if I did that.

Congrats on maxing!

Imagine thinking your unhealthy addiction to one kind of pixels is better than someone else‚Äôs addiction to a different kind of pixels.
---
I agree but it'd have to be more of a change than that or it'd literally be pointless. Going from 1/2500 to 1/2250 is so minute you'd barely tell the difference, especially since people rarely go that dry in general.
---
Unless it was a typo and you meant, 1/1250,aka half, in which case I agree.
---
Okay, I get it. It's not that cool. Just thought it was fun to see.
---
Ash is the secret life rune?
---
Gotcha. Well now you can finally play the game.
---
Nah, jagex has said you can remap keys as long as its 1-1 inputs.
---
Once you remap so clicking one key does more than one thing they say that'll get you banned.
---
Thank you alot!
---
The Old Wise Mans knowledge is supreme and he's spells are the most powerful in whole Gielinor, sounds alot like a godlike figure to me. And yes the vision demanded me to include him in this artwork :)
---
Mostly cuz I'm dumb and forgetful. I did a decent amount of black chins when I got 99 hunter and Sri forget about them haha
---
same i enjoyed anti pking and made lots of money doing it looks like another part or the game being ruined...
---
I mean, sort of. They do try to fight you off.
---
I mean, the guards fight back.. they just suck at their job
---
That is true. 
---
I use house for teleport to lunar isles/ relleka and clan wars doesn't restore spec. I want good specs because I don't want to use unnecessary rune darts. They are hella expensive
---
The 20% break chance isnt really enough for me to care about if im using crossbow. The 2.5 kills between each average break will pay for it. I just figure that if something is easy with practice then just practice it thats just my opinion man. Idc if you use the staff Im just saying why i think its pointless and not necessary
---
Oh cool had no idea. Where's a place to look?
---
I don't want to be forced to see that creepy alien fuck everyday.
---
I‚Äôd argue Wildy Slayer is a splinter to Skayer. It serves another purpose, where risk/reward are a factor. It‚Äôs the meta for alts to train from 1-70 because it has the best xp rates at those levels and gives you a stock of points to jump into Nieve/Steve and Duradel.
---
I'm 5' 9" and lemme tell you it feels really good man
---
seriously what's the reason for the combination runes for pvp only to fail? That qol for amyome pking with a tsotd and a tome of fire
---
I dont pvp and I voted no. Pvp community is too small to actually manage changing the vote like that on their own.
---
 Hi 5', I'm Dad!
---
a mix between zmi, astrals, nats and diary lamps

yes
---
Will you ever make your method public? I'm never going to use it but damn this is a sick achievement
---
this guy fucks
---
you adding new bis items through ovm or quests is determintal for my pvp account goals having to skill and boss again to remain competitive
---
The Leagues are being added, there's no voting. Now you're just being a whiny spite voter.
---
ArE tHeY sHiTtY cUz DeY kIlLeD yOu?? Nah bruh, the meme is funny and relevant. Get off your high horse.

Ok so I went to try to kill Ankous and apparently I can kill like 4-5 before I run out of food so this is doable at least.
---
Over time it's easy to deduce that someones is clicking every so many milliseconds + or - so many milliseconds. They use a lot of pattern recognition for detection.
---
Because that‚Äôs boring and efficient slayer nowadays leaves you with a surplus of points so boosting is not really a thing anymore, unless you want to camp a specific slayer boss.
---
Then calculate it yourself, how about that answer? I have the numbers in mind, but I‚Äôll hang onto them now. 
---
Plus, in the time it took you to write that response, you could‚Äôve already done the math.
---
Based
---
Just use addy. Rune aren‚Äôt really worth it. If your kills are taking a really long time maybe focus on your stats a little bit first. There are better money makers than 1 kill vork trips.
---
if they want to
---
MTA is one of the worst pieces of content in the game. Do not add the rune pouch to it.
---
Trivial to make it non uniform too
---
Fair enough, though the two examples you just gave have also seen very little drop in value since the change was made. Dharocks has been roughly 3.5m for a very long time and sgs has been 30-35m for quite a while. regardless, we seem to agree on the main point. this is the best idea I have seen so far as to how to tweak the death mechanics and bring back some adrenaline and risk to high level pvm. support.
---
Okay, so it‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt care about the lower level death mechanics. What about what I said about bis risk? Do you think that the small fixed amount is enough risk? I personally think you need to risk items (which is what would happen at lower levels)
---
You're literally describing Wilderness Warbands from RS3.
---
My 1900 total level with 1b cash and 1 scroll away from champions cape got perm banned for using auto clicker. I did it on the monkey bars to earth warriors on edge dung. First time ever using an auto clicker, was banned that night. All for about 50k agility Experience over the course of 5 hrs. Trust me it‚Äôs not worth it. Prob quitting till group iron man now
---
I'm pretty stingy with my cash, I usually justify it by telling myself that I can usually make that money back in a short time.
---
Or I can always sell that item back.
---
Yeah but your point is also a "duh" lol. Obviously the coin/dice/whatever doesn't have any memory of previous attempts.
---
Show clue value or fake

Exactly! I agree with everything you said.

It's turning on and off tap to drop that gets me, I always miss the tiny icon.

OP is an iron man

I was wondering what his dialogue meant? Its not about you right?
---
Yet 6 years later and the customer support is still little more than a FAQ page and part part-time social media scanning? Yeah osrs has a community and a team of mods that care about it, but with time, the corporate bs will fizzle that community out. You can already see it happening with old mods slipping out the doors.. As soon as the majority of the OG community is gone, you can bet your ass osrs is going to see mtx trickle in as well.
---
Will there be any kind of price balancing?? 75 points for a rune pouch 600 points for a gmaul handle is absolutely insane I cannot even afford to pk pretty soon with all these updates I am risking almost 3m on death in a mystic set and now without a rune pouch I will be more likely to die to teams I currently cannot pk with a rune pouch due to the update so I‚Äôve been waiting for something to happen
---
Don‚Äôt go into the wilderness then and you won‚Äôt have a problem. Don‚Äôt do clues. You are so fragile that you can‚Äôt mentally handle being attacked in the wild so naturally your option is simply avoid the wild and all content attached to it. Then hopefully you‚Äôll be done whining about it
---
You're technologically inept
---
About 88k
---
So what is exactly is the point of removing them? Why don't they just keep them on their permanently?
---
Dude it's because cost/xp changes ask the time depending on your task. Just calculate the blowpipes base cost and go from there. You're asking questions you can answer yourself with simple logic
---
What happens if they stop adding leagues? Then the items would be discontinued?
---
The best investment you can make is BiS gear for farming Vorkath. The archers ring imbued will speed up your kills and in return replenish your cash stack quicker than it would without. I‚Äôm also cheap but it‚Äôs a necessity. Heck, if it doesn‚Äôt work out you can sell the ring back. At the end of the day it‚Äôs just pixels.
---
I always find myself always going back to rust and osrs lol.
---
No offense but 95% of the game is brainlessly easy. I get it's disappointing for new content to be AFK-able. But it's not like it's unique in it's difficulty.
---
Pretty sure its not never ending.... Correct me if im wrong.
---
 Hi wrong., I'm Dad!
---
No there isn't.
---
Wow show off!!!
---
Yeah I think this one was a far reach buddy, better luck next time.
---
Ikr lmao
---
Out of all the runes to include you didn‚Äôt use body or earth runes?
---
Theres a way to use venom or something and ring of recoils? I forget but theres a method where its not risky. But yeah its partner slayer or something. I forget.
---
It is new content. It may be new content that you aren't a fan of, but that doesn't make it not new content. On top of that we just got a new quest that unlocks a new area with new monsters that drop a new item. And not long before that we got song of the elves which had way too much new content to even begin naming. So you're kinda making a moot point anyway.
---
I dont think its that difficult.
---
I think its been memed to Dark Souls levels, majority of players wont have the money,skill level and courage to do it.
---
But i think if everyone had tbows and justiciar/kodai thered be a lot more infernals.
---
If you're in otherwise BIS dps gear, you can use it to maintain prayers while afking NMZ to actually achieve a better dps than using zenyte jewlery.  You need to choose the 5 bosses which maximise prayer/hp.  
---
I actually discovered this myself, but barely used it since it's only a 5 minute afk (overloads)
---
damn dude nice
---
So that‚Äôs what the blood alter looks like

You have 150 capes. Most of us have 0. You are the 1%

In a more recent news post didn't they say that the 1-1 input thing was incorrect? They should mention it in the 3rd party client post
---
They said that they don‚Äôt have a plan for if they die but they want to have a solution so they still aren‚Äôt discontinued.
---
Oh my god 15 nature runes holy shit that's a lot
---
The trick is xp stalling with poison but damn that would take a long time
---
I think your best bet would be attempting to kill [K'ril](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/K%27ril_Tsutsaroth). Since your melee stats are on the lower end, I'd highly recommend getting a greater demon task (K'ril and one of his minions count as one), and an arclight. Together those combat boosts should shred K'ril, but don't expect long trips.
---
bones to peaches is convenient but it doesn't really get used in a lot of places.
---
Idk why everyone is so against this. I personally loved these and that evil tree thing that would pop up.
---
This is like the 8th post i've seen since runefest asking for exactly what was announced at runefest. They announced that this year would be less centered around new content and focused more on improving things already in-game. they also announced in the q+a that they would be more transparent in addressing 3pc issues and looking into buffing their own client. 
---
Please do the minimal amount of research into the current announcements before muddying the sub with posts about things that have clearly already been addressed.

?????? He didn't say he had the highest bank value, just asked what it was.
---
Clan wars portal also exists btw.
---
Its literally nothing more than changing the number of points you get. A change in the mechanics of the shitty reward store with ZERO pvp exclusive items. How the fuck is this a rework or a rejuvenation of anything?
---
Icthlarin used his forces, mercenaries and the mahjarrat to push Zaros back to Al Kharid. Zaros never got any further south than that Pyramid, Menaphos has always been ruled the the gods of the Menaphite Pantheon. 
---
He can‚Äôt be buried there is he‚Äôs never been there. Would be better to flesh out the lore of the Menaphite gods than add to Zaros and his already extensive lore.
---
konar is a noob trap. the gp and xp are both abysmal. do literally anything else for gold.
---
Possibly the worst excuse for an update to pvp I‚Äôve ever seen. You all literally spoke about a bounty hunter rework for years and we got a UI update. Are you freaking kidding me Jagex? That‚Äôs it?
---
Exactly
---
Isn't that, quite literally, what you've done?  
---
no, I commented to say how there is a faucet where his 'chance' is increasing....with the overall point of suggesting that people confuse your statistical chance increasing with your actual chance of getting the drop increasing...which isn't even close to how it works.   
---
A handful of nerds (raise your hand if I mention you) misunderstood and proceeded to badly explain stats to me....including you, who apparently has a stats degree......
---
but I got tank path during quest
---
To be fair, the bones to peaches grind it legitimately awful. Still, lumby hards is free, lol. Even elite is really easy
---
Find it.  Link it.
---
What did you get?
---
As sad as it is, I think PvP in RS will never be as exciting as it was back in 2006-2007. I am of the opinion that the designers of the game should NOT be designing content to "encourage" people to go participate in PvP only for the rewards. Matter of fact is that BH is not that interesting for most of the players and adding rewards into BH will do absolutely nothing in making it more interesting.
---
On the other hand, if Jagex implemented a ROTA system where certain weapons and gear are not allowed in BH, that might make the PvP scene more interesting. Heck, even level restrictions could be fun to implement to make BH fun. Do a week of lvl 76+ defense cannot participate in BH and then do a week of any defense &lt;50 cannot participate. This way you get an active band of similar levels on at the same time and having fun.
---
literally just explained how they apply to you in another comment. stop having two conversations with me and focus on one.
---
Wow gold? Thank you so much! I can't believe it! My cat will be so proud!
---
I have 200m thieving xp (rs name on hi scores is same as here) and I still train it sometimes. I just like Pyramid Plunder.
---
The answer for pures in f2p is always flesh crawlers.
---
Yeah if you're a basic bitch who programs your "random" interval as 2000ms +/- 150ms or whatever...
---
There are many ways to randomize the interval in a way that's indistinguishable from human randomness, at least to Jagex.
---
Did you delay releasing the method until after he got his pet?

You may have gotten a tome at 85 KC but my ironmeme got full pyro by 85 KC and I finished Todt with a tome and 2 full sets (I still have about 200 crates to open but saving them for 60+).
---
This is an incredibly ignorant post my dude. I don't even know where to start but I'll try.
---
First off, this is exactly how runescape 3 is run and it's a dumpster fire right now, the playerbase plummeting. You REALLY want the company that has destroyed rs3 with it's horrendous decision making to call the shots here too?
---
Secondly, you say there a lots of "good" updates that have been shot down in the polls because "people are inherently stupid". Whether an update is "good" or not is purely subjective. Just because YOU liked the idea doesn't mean everyone else should. Calling people stupid because they disagree with you is immature, ignorant and, as you said, "inherently stupid".
---
Thirdly, that is the stupidest business model I have ever heard in my life. "We'll just do whatever we want and if people don't like it, they can leave". I hope for your sake you never decide to start a business, you will certainly go bankrupt in quick fashion. By the time you're able to "measure whether it was a good decision or not", it's too late, you've already lost the paying customers who think it was a bad update.

A democratic system is the best system humanity has come up with, and it is no different on a game than in real life. Please, stop complaining when the polls don't go your way and accept that your opinion simply isn't popular enough to be implemented into the game.
---
This only works at low levels.  At max you can do 40-50 attack without a combat
---
i wasn't aware there was a minigame shop and that it had passed a poll (have taken many breaks).
---
good thing they haven't added it yet because that sounds like awful ezscape and painful to balance. most players will just choose to play the quickest minigame for points because we're runescape players.

imagine getting torso at the burthrope games room. that's some private server shit right there.

What a shit comparison tbh. Pvmers hate agility too. Agility isn't really a pvm skill either. And if you remove pvm from the wild there's 0 reason to have the Rev cave shortcut, or the Rev cave to begin with.
---
biggest troll :)
---
Cannon with 1 cannonball in it

You choose between tank and agility during the quest. It doesn‚Äôt randomly give you one.
---
Add it to rune crafting with a level 80 requirement to craft and can be sold. Make it require fabric from some new boss. New market, bam fam.
---
The problem is that ok'ish ideas are immediately thrown away instead of being tweeked and repolled.  Take warding for example, biggest potential update for a while got immediately abandoned after a 66% poll.  Probably would have gotten voted in if they fixed problems people had

Nmz is better xp, easier to afk, and gives rewards so it‚Äôs ideal if you have some quests done

That being said, get 50 attack and use the granite hammer cuz it doesn‚Äôt change your combat at max level

There‚Äôs the no-combat-xp way to tag monsters that he is doing some form of most likely. One is with a cannon to hit a mob on the same tick it spawns for no xp, the other is hitting the mob the same tick it dies to another account for shared slayer xp. The latter is used by def tank accounts since they can get -65 attack and gaurantee 0 dmg, and 99 slayer has already been achieved this way. With minimul accuracy for a level 3 doing this, iirc the calculations were you‚Äôd get somewhere in the lvl 90s before gettin a level 2 stat unless something has changed/been discovered since.
---
Why he do that get 102 runecrafting
---
Lol wat?
---
High end pvmers use sweets all the time. Rendi is far from the only one buying them..

Wonder what he thinks when he sees shit like this üòÇ

The 'problem' is that your argument generally gets the goalpost moved from "this skill could fit into other skills" to "this skill could fit into other places in the game". It becomes "pick one" between:
---
1) This skill has overlap with other skills  
---
2) This skill could be implemented as a mini-game
---
Those two arguments cover 100% of content. Dungeoneering and sailing are more "mini-game-esque". 
---
It seems that most people picking that argument just don't want to see new skills enter the game, and are just choosing arbitrary barriers that apply to 100% of content that already exists.
---
We really do need more gold/item sinks so even "slightly" nerfing a goldsink already hurts enough.
---
It usually happens to infinite loops like splashing. 6 hour log was originally added because of splashing.
---
I thought there was one with 99 already, or was that just a 10 hp account?
---
If you do MM2 and get a black demons task, work a bit of luck you can make a lot of money from zenytes while working on your pvm skills (but you could also get unlucky, so it isn't too reliable)
---
Fully agree with you, but it's not the first time. Thinking about superior slayer monsters, higher levels on the same mobs in the wildy, superior dragons.. etc
---
I got it around 80 KC on my original ironman, so for sure I'll go this dry too on the hardcore.
---
Who died?
---
Why take the spiteful route of luring people? Jagex just needs to grow a pair of balls and stop stacking drop tables to be 2m/hr so that people naturally gravitate towards PvP again.  A lot of people just PvM because it is far and away the most profitable thing in the game.  They've grown used to tables being filled with endless alchables to meet a gp/hr.  Jagex needs to go through tables and remove them
---
They should all be under T smfh

LOL

I've gotten 2 kill trips on tasks with these stats, definitely doable

holy shoelaces, it was actually an arm, thank you for correction
---
&gt;negative upvotes
---
Ironic
---
&gt; The issue is agilities only reward basically is the shortcuts unlike those skills.
---
A lot of older skills are basically dead content. Firemaking has no obvious uses for any player. Agility is probably the single most widely 'useful' skill in the game just for the run energy benefits.

Nah they‚Äôre Shitty because they‚Äôre bad at rust so they have to play rust in osrs in order to get a single kill

One thing to understand in some of these cases is that macroing is seen as a much different thing in Runescape compared to many other games, MMOs especially.

I used slayer points to get my rune pouch because I didnt know it could be bought. Just grind way them points.

That's just, like, your opinion, man. How tf are quests messed up? lol And even if they made a new version of the game minigames would still be dead.

Moss giants my man.  Or hill giants.  Don't do ogress unless you're an ironman because the xp/hour sucks and you can make money other ways.  If you really don't give a damn about drops do flesh crawlers honestly.

So they are worth construction XP. You surely mean that they aren't easily liquifiable
---
Kind of funny that you got downvoted because the population of reddit thinks that afking Gargoyles for 500k/hr is "good money"
---
Yes, he did
---
I also just realized an issue with the bond rewards where if a player received 5 ‚Äúleague bonds‚Äù but had bonds on their account already and redeemed/traded them, the bond NPC with the locked price would subtract the number of bonds they could buy from the player., this results in lost value as the league bonds may have been higher in value than the GE price. To avoid this, the ‚Äúleague bonds‚Äù would have to be their own item to the player, but when traded away or sold on the GE, they would revert to normal bonds. A player might have to right-click the league bond to ‚Äúrevert‚Äù it, which brings a warning, to make it tradeable. THEN the number of bonds able to be sold to the NPC with the locked price would decrease.
---
Yes I have done tons of Master Clues. My main thing I highlighted in the post about Master clues is they rarely ever ask for you to go in the wilderness... I never complained about the Mages on Masters during this post so Idk why you are mentioning it. The thing you should be responding to is the amount of Wildy steps on Hard compared to Master since I mentioned that.
---
Again, fully agree with you. But I gave up these hopes long ago. The devs seem to cather to an audience that i'm not one of so I quit osrs about a year ago. The memes on this reddit are still dank though. It's sad they rather cather to iron memers who think it's an amazing achievement that you can soon play the game together ( group iron man) than people who prefer to play casually with friends having a blast bossing or whatever. I doubt there's an ear for your complaints bro, it seems they've made their choice in which direction they want to go and it isn't ours unfortunately.
---
I‚Äôm out of the loop, what‚Äôs happening with rune pouch?
---
pickup the leather gloves before they despawn!
---
Why would you macro splashing? Just click every 20 minutes and you're good.
---
try one kc on my account with no sacrificing and you'll surely get it
---
I have a write up about making money to get bonds, I think it might be helpful. Prices might be a bit outdated.
---
- - - - - 
---
Depends on his preferred methods of making money (bossing, combat, skilling, dailies...). I'll list off a few common ways
---
* Using blast furnace to smelt steel/mith/addy/rune bars. Has a very very low entrance requirement (30 smithing) and can potentially make 400k+ per hour at those levels. Will take a significant chunk of your week play time to make a bond every time, but you'll get some smithing exp and you can get started right away (after knight's sword quest), though getting a coal bag first is recommended
---
* Take the bossing route and rush zulrah/vorkath. Takes one of the longest requirements to get, but potentially gives you 2m+ per hour and is one of the least "boring" methods to grind for gp according to popular opinion. I personally can't stand to do it for long hours.
---
* Take the slayer route and cash in after the mid levels. Gargoyles (200k+, 75 slayer), skeletal wyverns (400k+, 72 slayer), brutal black dragons (800k+, 77 slayer), cerberus (2.5m+, 91 slayer) are all great money makers
---
* Runecraft. This one generally gets a lot of hate for being mindless and boring but I personally love it. It's chill enough to watch a movie on a second screen and you get reasonable exp (for this skill, at least) and GREAT money. Natures (350k+, 44 rc), double cosmics (800k+, 59 rc), double astrals (900k+, 82 rc), double nature (1.2m+, 91 rc), wrath (1.5m+, 95 rc) and double death (1.3m+, 99 rc) are all easy to grind for looong hours if you focus on something else and are among the chillest money making methods imo.
---
* Dailies include mainly rushing varrock elite for a free ~180k per day buying battlestaves. Other tiers also yield the benefit, though less per day. If done everyday it pays for a reasonable chunk of the bond by itself. You can also do herb runs for additional money, among other minor things like buying herb boxes and picking cactus spines. Farming herbs and doing birdhouses a few times a day can also be reasonably profitable.
---
* Mining is a notable mention, with ok exp and profit (550k+, 45k+ exp at 61 mining) and scales well until 75 (800k+, ~55k+ exp) doing blast mining.
---
For more obscure methods, check out https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide
---
Just take some methods with grain of salt, as some (like growing saplings) aren't really sustainable in the long run.
---
Sounds good and will do. Thanks!
---
&gt; is there any reward/incentive you could be given on your main to justify using it to participate in the leagues?
---
I‚Äôm going to strongly consider pursuing the Twisted slayer helm, if it passes the poll.
---
Sometimes the grind of an achievement is worth less-than-stellar experience rates.
---
Anguish alone probably gives more dps than arma top and bottom, upgraded from D hide. Zenytes are usually the first thing people get. 
---
Ive had my anguish for almost 2 years now, and I dont even have a single bandos or arma piece. My dps is still really good
---
How‚Äôd you like it? A month or so back I figured I‚Äôd check it out and am now extra excited for the new quest because the area was so eerie and mysterious
---
Fr. You got an rdt drop? Its a fucking rdt drop. Whats the chance, 1/16 to roll it, and all drops suck? Sounds like u got a shit 1/16 drop keep ur whiny math out my chatbox
---
Will Jagex consider giving Larran‚Äôs key the same drop rate as mysterious emblems had? 
---
There‚Äôs a bit of a fallout when you consider the removal of emblems from wildy slayer and how rare Larran‚Äôs keys actually are.
---
There are a ton of wildy steps on masters. There are 6 coordinates that are mostly on hotspots (air obelisk, wildy agility course, resource area, wilderness volcano, deep wild chaos temple, and Rogues' Castle in a multi-combat area RIGHT by the Wilderness Obelisk which IMO is terrifying), tons of clue piece steps (once had 3 for one step once in 3 different wildy locations!), hot &amp; cold steps (these are by far the WORST clue steps in the whole game), a wildy emote clue in 55 wilderness, and an anagram clue.
---
I get where you're coming from with elites -- if you're a mid level player that has kept up on quests and skilling they will be trivial compared to hard clues -- but masters are so far and above more dangerous than hard clues and pull you into the wild at least once or twice per clue unless you get fairly lucky
---
Just recovered my hacked/botted account so slowly trying to get some gold back.
---
Konar gives a lot of slayer points so you should use her for every 10th task. On the other 9 tasks it's optional for you which one you want to use.
---
The supply of gold bars is so so much higher than than the consumption of gold leaves that I don‚Äôt think this would even have a significant effect on their value
---
They just need to reorganize most of the list in general. It's hard to find some quests.
---
Suggestion: jagex makes everyone fill out tax forms with annual gains/losses.
---
Angry
---
It used to be player run by a clan chat, and it was a disaster
---
the words should be swapped because the flying dude is not running and escaping
---
Where did they say they‚Äôre going to remove rune pouch....? Plot twist, no where.
---
E-peen
---
Again, you can easily die during a Master Clue but rarely ever in the wilderness in comparison to hard so you will get your stuff back to try again in most cases.
---
Also again I cant stress this enough, Hard and Master both have double agents during Emote clues while Elite doesnt. Saradomin Wizard has Poison and swaps combat stypes while the Elite guards can have 100% of its damage negated by protection prayers.
---
To be fair I prefer catering to ironman than catering to pay2win. Regular mode feels so drab and depressing, since all metas boil down to "camp best money maker, buy xp" or simply buy bonds/ rwt.
---
With the various ironman modes you're at least forced to learn content, and I didn't actually have much fun with OSRS till I made my UIM.
---
What makes you think the price of gold bars will rise? I think the price of gold leafs will plummet instead.
---
I would agree as thats the essence of tournament rewards, yet there are still some who don‚Äôt find the rewards justifiable for using their main. I wonder where we can find common ground between rewards and opportunity cost.
---
You now what else prevents you from getting burned by a keylogger? Not visiting sketchy sites and downloading anything.
---
I'm saying the opposite of that. I'm saying that the wilderness is not JUST a pvp zone. It has a ton of pvm content. So why would it be fair not to give a voice to the portion of the community that goes there for pvm purposes? A new op weapon that gives an advantage to pkers should not be put in a poll that excludes pvmers. They use the wildy to pvm, therefore that update would impact them. Does that make sense?
---
Why is it a requirement to have ornament kits for the zenyte jewelry? If its just cosmetic, why make it a barrier for entry? Youre going to steer away a lot of people
---
Thanks for telling me exactly what I wanted to hear.
---
They're not removing the rune pouch, though.
---
Is there really nowhere better than MTA to stick the rune pouch? It's got a few decent rewards already which people hate grinding for. Maybe add some new way to get it from the Arceuus house or something.
---
That's the same clue step that finally made me go get mine.
---
Pidoras
---
Never done this hunter method. Is it fun?
---
it appears alot of people must be new this was way before rs3 maybe if they spawn randomly in the wild pvpers will like it

I criticised the fact that he achieved it through bug abuse. Hope that‚Äôs cleared things up for you.

u/Spktwin seems to CARE.

Such as?
---

---
I always like to bitch about the reddit community for osrs but twitter is WAY worse lmao
---
Remove all PvM drops like D pick/rings etc from the wilderness and make 1 new boss drop it all somewhere else so we don‚Äôt have to listen to ironmemes cry over their spades. Then replace all the loot tables of wildy bosses with pvp armours/chaotics for wilderness use only and give us weekly challengers or something. 2birds1stone. More pkers come in for the pvp gear, and the cluehunters/pvmers can go back to afking slayer watching anime. Nice 1 lads.
---
They've said in the future they will all be removed, yes. Possibly automatically converted into points.
---
look at his twitter he answered a tweet about it
---
Do you not know what the saying means???
---
&gt;How do these people get banned for this shit?
---
He didn't even know it was considered botting/macroing, he most likely always saw people splashing in Lumbridge and thought every1 used an autoclicker. He proceeds to use an autoclicker himself, thinking he's not breaking any rule =&gt; ?? =&gt; banned.
---
I tried to get 99 ranged off an Imp in the ge, but couldnt find one. So then I just went to a chicken
---
I think he might be acting sarcastic
---
"Getting 99 herblore at Galvek" would be kinda a cool video lmao
---
Moo
---
don't die
---
256? Is there a ceiling for that drop?
---
I did:(
---
Hahaha you just don't want to admit it. Come on do it. Say it with me RS3 is the ruined version of Runescape. Don't take it from me, take it from the numbers. More people play OSRS than RS3. Simple as that.
---
Sure RS3 had a time of stability when OSRS came out but it wasn't because RS3 wasn't shitty, it was because old players weren't around to know that the REAL Runescape had came back.
---
Just admit it please.
---
Glad I'm not the only one.
---
I honestly still don't understand why you're phasing out Mysterious Emblems, and did it abruptly. I had about 10 mysterious emblems on my pure including 2 tier 9s that I was about to turn into tier 10s and now what? They're worthless? And you're removing the old BH shop making those points worthless? I bought 10m worth of points on my main so I could buy more rune pouches, but it sounds like I'm either going to have to 1. grind slayer (already 99), or 2. participate in BH where the meta is solely DHing when I'm a better tribridder since the new emblems are untradeable. 
---
Not to mention that wildy slayer is now just solely about points and the potential of larrans keys which completely ruins it. With wildy slayer (1-79 on my pure), I would get an emblem, be like "Oh shit nice! Let's go pk" and attempt to pk a few more emblems without feeling like I lost a lot.
---
If you guys REALLY wanted to revive BH and entice more people to try it, you would allow people to change their defense to anything below their current defense while keeping all their original stats on BH worlds awarding 0 xp.  They'd still risk the gear and supplies, but people could try pking without putting in a months worth of time to make a decent pking account. 
---
Or fuck me Jagex why not just actually throw a 3 time limited use xp remover lamp integrity change into the BH shop? There's literally no rewards besides "wOW AgS reColor" and as a maxed pure NHer non of the rewards besides the rune pouch actually entice me to try bh more.
---
This is runescape not readscape. He needed to flex on someone regardless of what they said.
---
I feel that brother.
---
I know, i got them for the athemyst, that's why im not wearing them atm. And what do you mean, I thought it was just funny, why do people on the internet allways have to missunderstand humor.....

---
any flagship phone from the last 5 years is like 400 dollars on the high end. You can still find a lot of them new.
---
There is no reason to buy new phones anymore. The flag ships from 5 years ago have around 8 gigs of ram and snapdragon 835+ which will run literally anything on the app store on the highest settings. I'm almost 100% certian you cant even use all 8 gigs of ram unless you really tried to download every live wallpaper, and floating app, widget you can and run them all at once. It's just plain overkill, and there's no good apps that even make use of the hardware appropriately.
---
The only REAL feature you are missing out on from a 855 is the ability to play like 20 ps2 games more then the older versions of the snapdragon. And even then like 70% of the ps2 games just wont work on our current emulators.
---
The rest of that money is going to paying for the RnD and gimicky features like wide shot lenses, and in screen finger print scanners.
---
I haven't played osrs for 6 months and guess what, I don't need one either ;)
---
I‚Äôve done around the same number and had a very different experience. I guess we know which of us RNG favors! :(
---
The rewards are completely lacking, to me this seems like LMS all over again, but on a much larger scale. The cosmetics passed and the magic armor everyone on Reddit wanted for years passed but nothing else passed, reminiscent to the rewards that passed in LMS. LMS died down shortly after release. 
---
Ancient Warriors equipment has been polled and several times for at least a year or two and has failed pretty much every time and it‚Äôs time that it is re polled for the final time and not re polled again. perhaps it can be rebalanced in some way and re polled, but I doubt this. 
---
With the new bounty hunter rework and the task sets there should come great rewards. Niche armor, such as magic robes in between mystic and xerician, new spec weapons, a wider range of cosmetics such as ways to recolour your god capes to match ancestral; zaros themed ancient items and weapons (such as an ancient staff upgrade kit); and perhaps for those who really farm BH, there will be a chance at opening a crate to receive a rare and powerful weapon, such as (just an overpowered suggestion, not real) a staff that can auto cast ancients that gives a chance to tb your opponent. Or that korasi sword upgrade for the Sara sword (lol)
---
**TLDR : Please re poll a set of BH rewards and require those who vote in the poll to have a set amount of kills/KD ratio in either the wilderness, pvp worlds and/or bounty hunter worlds.**
---
but it's in the game
---
Lol it's just lazy people being lazy people. They think any 99 cannot be achieved through fair play, because they play 30 minutes a day, of which 20 minutes are spent bankstanding, and a year later they find themselves with 50k rc xp and wonder how the fuck they could even achieve 13m rc xp in *this* lifetime.
---
Lazy people's reaction to 99 buyables: "Look at him, he bought $2k worth of bonds with mum's bankcard loool"
---
Lazy people's reaction to unbuyable 99: "Look at him, he botted his 99 loool"
---
By the way, there's nothing wrong with being a lazy scaper. Everyone is free to choose how much of their time they're willing to piss away in this game. Just don't be *that* guy who has to poop on the parade of those who spend hours upon hours a day in the game.
---
Thank you Johnny

Honestly? They should rework non-combat magic exp. An auto clickable method shouldn‚Äôt be the most efficient method.

If you're capping out at 550k stop doing mahogany and start doing oak doors, you can get over 500k/h there and its significantly cheaper

ur not done till ur done though. im now at 1250 no boots, and technically its 2 boots for completion  o.O
---
Jagex needs to bite the bullet on this update and scrap it. Don‚Äôt try to act like it‚Äôs ready and push it anyways. This entire system needs to be thought out again because the work you‚Äôve done here will ruin BH even more than it already is. The update provided versus the update promised to us have been far too different.

That's assuming less than 1k gold bars are created per 1 gold leaf used. I'm working so I can't do the maths rn, but I'm going to make a big bold statement that a player getting 88 (lumby elite diary req, something most high level players want to have) smithing creates more than 1k the amount of gold leaves a max efficient house + every master stash unit uses.

If this is annoying to you, please click [this link](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&amp;subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot) to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.

So according to you‚Äôre terribly fucking thought out solution, I should get an item in order to get around a game code issue? Yikes
---
Runelite Issue
---
Ah, I see. Luckily both will still fit between the gap in your front teeth.

It 100% is it is by far the most toxic sub, I've never met anyone who's played league that hasn't been touched by toxic players, language, ect. Any game that puts in auto time outs and bans to stop toxic players realize the problem, Google is league the most toxic game and not a single person will disagree. Literally every game I play has been at a high level and I've never seen a game more toxic. Sports/fighting games are a majority non toxics, most shooters have rare occasions of it, card games have basically zero, alt games like rocket league indie games have nearly none. You are just trying to paint with a broad brush, most games for the majority aren't toxic. League on the other hand is a every few games problem.

How is this community so incredible and talented yet so awful at the same time? I love it.
---
whoever downvoted im gonna find u!11!
---
nice
---
Gotta do rotations then, yo! We can plan it! I really wanna hear ideas how to make it work
---
No ill will, but what encouraged you to start in '19? Seems like most are there for the nostalgia, myself included, so genuinely curious. PM me to be friends, again, no ill will. Just wondering the interest in 2007 scape
---
Yeah but jagex doesn't even bother 
---
Source: used uniform randomizer for 99 thieving
---
What's the point of beatboxing with both hands like that? I've watched a lot of professional beat boxers on youtube and they all go one-handed? Is this because females have a naturally higher pitch voice so they have to augment their sound with two hands to create more depth?
---
Also what does this have to do with a in-game clan?
---
Sit
---
Troll? Is that what you call trolling?
---
I remember when some news outlet ran pictures of some conflict, turns out they were pictures of ARMA II
---
was hoping for a real response as to why i'm wrong. disappoint.
---
I mean, there was a big poll with a bunch of potential rewards. Some good, some bad rewards, but it's not like you didn't see this coming.
---
Information on when it will be?
---
How do you explain the looting bag and rune pouch QoL poll that would be less of an inconvenience for everybody not passing? Or the Ags spec recolor being the only BH reward passing? Or the crab teleport being the only LMS reward passing in the second rewards poll? All these Pvp related questions failing polls in a row is too much of a coincidence. Yet these recent unnecessary quests pass with flying colors.
---
Sure, I haven't achieved anything :D It isn't hard work killing Zuk with a Twisted Bow.
---
Like the tears from pures since theyre gonna rebalance the magic defense formula?
---
Integrity updates go both ways.  The only way they dont go is new content.
---
You stole my rng!
---
Yeah on my UIM it's honestly the scariest shit risking all my herb exp.
---
Yeah I don't buy this. I used an ahk script to bot 99 agility that uses robotic mousemovements (the only randomness is the click area and the time between clicks) and didn't get banned.
---
What were you killing?
---
If pking was fun youd be doing it and not getting mad at a spadepost on leddit
---
I led around eight of them to the dark wizards with the boys.
---
One nature 5 üî• rune yourself
---
Egads, my reddit reputation.
---
Dont do this
---
I was also wondering what the pic had to do with a clan :D
---
Increase the droprate of keys, but only while on slayer tasks.
---
Give this man gold
---
Yo I‚Äôm MomsLasagna from that raid last night. If you want to start raidingI can teach you cox anytime.
---
You can only get them from a wildy slayer task...
---
Picture is for attention :D
---
Oh. Strange that they‚Äôre so shit then. I‚Äôve only done about 10 wildy tasks but I‚Äôve never seen one.
