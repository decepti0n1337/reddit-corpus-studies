I'm not complaining about downvotes
---

---
 I'm pointing out your inbox downvote which is always a direct result of being upset. The fact is your first response to anyone replying to you is to spam downvotes. Why are you here? It's not for disscussion
---
Btw doing that cancles them out, So only 1 of my comments will get your downvote.
---
It's just really funny watching you get mad becuz someone dares reply to you on a social media thread! Like you even made a comment asking why people were replying to you. It's because you made a comment on an internet fourm made for disscussion. People are here to reply to each other.
---
I'm gunna block you now cuz you arnt actually disscussing you're just being mad
---
I definitely found it tougher personally, but the fact I was on the stairstepper while doing it was the icing on the cake for me
---
You sure got him
---
Hey look ran I'm mowing the air bud
---
Woosh
---
I've never seen it so I consider it OC. You go OP!
---
The purpose of the shield is to defend yourself. If you have it then you're not going to be attacking. If you want to fight against someone that has it then you should also have end game gear, which is hardly ever used. It's the same thing with someone trying to use crap mage attack gear and kill someone with black d'hide armor.
---
The shield isn't the issue. Yeah it's a lot cheaper than a lot of other end game gear, but its purpose is completely different as it's only a defensive shield.
---
I suck at pking but from what I've observed is that most pkers bring trash gear and expect to kill with that.

Jagex don't need to stop the requests. They just need to let the actual player log-in, which they can do by verifying their credentials. And actually jagex implemented ddos mitigation quite some time ago, or did everyone stop noticing the constant downtimes?

Not sure, get it to about 30% and and can't seem to finish it

Mod Ash must have 99 Slayer, his comments leave no survivors.

This is most definitely one of my favourite comments on Reddit

Get Corey and Trevor to do it
---
You probably shouldnt train the skill again. Even if youre not tryna flex the fact that you got it at such a low level, its just a shitty skill with not too much use aside from the pet. a lot of high level players still have level 1 so i cant imagine youll have a reason to train it for a while so you might as well flex your pet while at the level
---
That was hilarious, not a troll either, just incredibly dense
---
Just pull a Jagex and pass it as an integrity change then.
---
You don't use graceful set effect at blast furnace and boots of lightness and spottier cape are better than their graceful counterparts

It comes down to bots and alts. Take a look at edgeville bank and see how many low level accounts have absurdly high runecrafting levels.

---
Seemed like you were complaining about downvotes.  Also, downvoting from the inbox doesn't work.
---
&gt;The fact is you spamming downvotes cancles them out, So only 1 of my comments will get your downvote.
---
Spamming downvotes doesn't cancel them out.  I simply didn't downvote you anymore because I got the reaction I wanted from you with the first one.  You barely understand how reddit works, lol.

Nicely done! Cool cape, that‚Äôs for sure!
---
Is there a link to a site for these?
---
What will happen to items such as the clue box and ring of wealth upgrade scroll?
---
These items are clearly not meant for Pkers but for their unfortunate ‚Äúprey‚Äù locking these items in a store you need PvP kills for will give these items even less of a use...
---
And why not make the Omni tunes available to use outside of the Wildy too? This might provide some great profit for pkers that is not generated directly by alchemy in the store. The runes itself would save just a up to 1 invent space in PvM as combination runes and rune pouches already provide great benefit in PvM.
---
What's the point in the polling system is you're constantly ignoring it?
---
F2P Teleblock? Binding spell timers?
---
Even the way the Elf graphics were reworked was a load of bollocks. You changed the graphics of an entire race without poll, then told us we had to vote on a new one via a poll (bearing in mind "reverting to original" wasn't even an option on some of the votes).
---
Might as well just call the polling system Advisory at this point.

Woah this is actually the first smart take on ‚Äústop giving me the *option* to have better xp / drops by going in the wilderness reeeee‚Äù that I‚Äôve ever seen.

I have one of those ergonomic chairs that's like a mesh, so it doesn't smell that bad. Rips cape was done in early 2018, fsr's in late 2018, and o ly finished Sr today.

Thank you very much!

DnD, clerics have a specialization in maces that lets them get a bonus on their attack rolls
---
Yikes that SD and HD option is nothing to do with what we are talking about. That's essentially equivalent to RuneLites Low Detail mode. All it changed was how much ground texture there was etc.
---
The HD rework came out in July 2008. That offered actual texture changes and a new graphics engine that utilised the GPU in your PC. They hired 30 new artists to do this change and it took 18 months.
---
Hardly a small thing. And I'm not saying I wouldn't want it if it was. The more options the better. The fact you're sitting here saying how YOU want the game to be is the right way and how I want it to stay is the wrong way is hilariously hypocritical. 
---
It's got nothing to do with wanting the option or not. Deciding to have it doubles the work for all future content, on top of requiring massive investment from the engine team and a whole group of artists to do it. We wouldn't see major content in that time. Id rather see new content to bring new players and keep existing, than a HD update that I don't think is as desired as you claim, nor as simple.
---
OP is a dick. Yeah you misclicked every single one of those nechs and ran away. Fuck off with your "it's just a prank bro" shit.
---
You just explain that scamming can happen. I would never recommend scamming a new player to teach him that scamming is possible. That‚Äôs not the fresh start someone needs to want to stay playing the game.
---
how much is that btw
---
I'm pretty well.

I find it enjoyable in moderation. Most people have super short attention spans though so they find it hard to enjoy anything. One of the reasons why some people say every skill is shit except slayer.
---
Yes sir.
---
Calling someone a nugget eh? Great way to demonstrate you have a good point and it‚Äôs not just stupidity behind your post.
---
You clearly know nothing about this scenario. What you‚Äôre proposing would allow people to bruteforce runescape passwords, making it an unfathomably stupid thing to suggest when they can just have people use emails for logging in.

There is nothing to unlock for players not liking PvP...

Hmm I get two t2 pieces and leave one at t1 but maybe that extra one would help, if I have time
---
Demon butler can be upto i think twice as fast. When i did the calculations i think philias only saved like 400k or something for every additional hour you spend, so philias isnt worth your time as long as you have money makers above 400k/hr which isnt hard and you probably have if youre spending money on construction
---
Has to be the full set for the bonus
---
Good to hear, what was the longest dry streak?
---
Ik osrs has some official ones
---
Except several of these updates make it even easier for a PKer to kill a clue hunter. I‚Äôm not voting for things that make PKing people who are not trying to PK easier, that would be a bad idea.

The funny thing is those pkers are usually people that are new to pking. Reddit is always complaining about how steep the PvP curve is, yet these guys are virtually all new to PvP and are practicing or getting used to fighting someone. They are then memed to oblivion here on reddit.

Probably a question that gets asked all the time, but I've played off and on since 2007 and never been a member. I've been getting back into the game and my main account is an ironman at total level 650ish right now. I am thinking about going mem, but if I have never been a member before should I just train up a non-ironman account to do that with? I just don't want to feel like I'm missing out on the full experience of memebership because I chose to be an ironman. I mostly am ironman because it makes F2P more interesting. I don't think member has as much of that issue though.

No Jedi has.

I will be voting no to everything. Will be voting yes on the gmaul nerf because i know pkers lose using a gmaul.
---
According to some people in this community, accidentally misclicking is deserving of punishment, but typing racial slurs at people is just normal and good.

Pet only drops if you kill it without fally shield.
---
This is definitely an emo album cover
---
Blows my mind how people can react to situations so fast with such aggression and hatred.
---
The taking steps after dying and hitting 0 happens at vorkath too with his spawn. Sometimes it'll crash into me after I kill it but it'll hit 0.  It's also not too uncommon for a player to take an extra step after dying and before calling over. Idk I always chocked it up to server lag. But maybe it's something else
---
...it has 140+ defence for all styles, and then 18 for magic. They made that 0 magic now. It's hardly a nerf.
---
"Fatality" clan chat
---
So much this. 
---
The boss is dead content apart from pet, which is not even worth the long grind at the moment.
---
Add gmaul upgrade to it's table, make Granite dust tradeable and rework the god-awful lightning phases. Atleast make us able to attack the boss during that so you can skip phases.

None of these recolors should happen. I'm excited for pvp changes, but this should not happen.
---
Were you on desktop? Something might have been wrong with your setup.
---
So a tank shield was useful for tanking?
---
If you can't kill someone that's running through 30+ wilderness levels  and not even fighting back then there's probably another issue. It's not *that* overbearingly tanky. Are you failing to teleblock them? Are they hiding amongst monsters?
---
IMO there's no real reason to nerf the shield. Especially not it's magic defence, when so few people use good magic equipment in the wilderness to begin with. Who knows, maybe that's a symptom of good magic equipment simply being too expensive?
---
Armadyl
---
The combat triangle is as follows:
---
Melee &gt; range &gt; magic &gt; melee
---
Melee armor has low magic defense and therefore can get smacked by magic attacks. Ranged armor is weak to melee and magic armor is weak to ranged
---
For raids is it better to wear a brimstone ring or bring multiple fremmy rings i?
---
right now it's impossible to brute force a runescape password
---
if you removed the delay on guesses it would still be a lifetime long depending on your password 
---
the only reason it's not longer is because we can't use symbols or caps
---
The barrows brothers have no magic defense so even when wearing tank armor you are still likely to hit on barrows brothers. People generally wear tank armor for running around the crypts so the mobs don‚Äôt get much damage on you as you run through.
---
Make it so you get the damage reduction when flicking it. High effort, high reward. Might also want to change the damage reduction to flat -1 or just reduce the damage reduction.
---
Ive got a jar of dirt!!!
---
1) allow the player to attack with it even when in block mode (20%) damage reduction.
---
Or 
---
2) while in block mode have the special attack grant all players in its radius a 15% damage reduction for 1 minute.
---
Ah. mourning ends part 2. Fun quest to complete.
---
Then they shouldn't force me to go there to play the rest of the game.
---
AutoMod makes a new thread at 12am every day and stickies it automatically which removes one of the other stickied posts.
---
For real what is the deal with the spec? Swear to God it hits 0s and single digit a majority of the time dispute having a higher max hit and (supposably) the same accuracy. I'm sure there's some bias because I notice it missing more than hitting, but it really does feel lopsided

It's a common trope for holy men to use a mace as a weapon.
---
Well for starters they can stop crying for nerfs to one of the only ways people who don't want to PK have to defend themselves.
---
Why does the new cudgel weapon not have a special attack ?
---
You're not getting it... It's 10days \* 90minutes
---
I think decent mage gear being too much is the root of the problem. Look at the jump in cost from salad to mystic to ahrims then compare that to snakeskin to black dhide to kharils. It's not even close. Black dhide is insanely powerful for the price where the comparable gear for mages is more than 10x as much risk. You can't really nerf the cost of dhide so why not make mystics much easier to acquire so there's incentive to bring something better than salad out in the wild?
---
lol im actually planning to go from 71 to 75 mage and get trident and swap to zulrah.
---
Dwarves can replace that with their trusty warhammers too if you want even more style points.
---
I agree.

thats what i did lol its not bad but you will hit mental walls lol.

Hardest part is finding a friend to do it with you.

Damn, how is everyone so sensitive now. It's a fuckin game where people kill each other, there's going to be trash talk. If some stranger on the internet chirping you in a video game ruins your fun then holy shit man, life's gunna be hard.
---
If these recolors pass, then you'll have to learn how to pvp and grind for them like everyone else
---
Got lvl 80-33m hunt xp and didnt die to any solo pker. Didnt die at all to teams either but thats dor other reasons mainly npc agression. Shield is busted af. Put it in a dps calc since its clear u cant do the math yourself. Max gear cant do 15 brews of damage in a full tb bs welfare and a dinhs with no overhead prayer switches. And u have to hit a d scim spec and a tb to boot.
---
Thanks for letting me know I can change what items are highlighted

Every pvp game has toxic people just dont let it trigger you or turn ur public off if u cant handle it

It was deliberately done to remove whips from the game.

Weird bait but ok.

Just got rank 690 overall banned yesterday, he was at ardy knights with 123m theiving xp, 140m in gp pumped into the game. Got about 9 people to report him and broke his script by luring a hero over, the guys name was LA Cocain
---
I can almost hear Sick Nerd crying with his 10 Justiciar chestguards....
---
Honestly mystics isn't quite strong enough, as it's only level 40 magic equipment. Maybe you could have mystics improve slightly like the dragonhides. Blue mystic -&gt; Light Mystic -&gt; Dark Mystic -&gt; Dusk mystic. Equivalent to Green D'hide -&gt; Blue D'hide -&gt; Red D'hide -&gt; Black D'hide.
---
But yeah I also think D'hide needs a melee defence nerf, if only slight. Its magic defence is absolutely fine, it just needs a tradeoff.
---
&gt;Modern OSRS philosophy is that they put in content for non-PKers, then let the PKers kill the skillers/PvMers/clue hunters and the PKers get killed by better PKers and clans. 
---
I agree with this aspect of their approach. Put high reward things into high risk environments. It also adds some variety to what is otherwise just another skilling resource or boss. 
---
&gt;they've even said they like lures and skulltricking because it adds to the risk of the wilderness.
---
This is strongly disagree with for the reasons you outline. That shit needs to go.
---
Nice
---
Congrats I guess
---
pls no I love wearing dhide for that melee defence at kq
---
Ok then don‚Äôt rainbow color your graceful or other items lol
---
What rule does posting this here break? Curious because I almost made a post yesterday about another guy botting at Ardy knights. I'll look for a rule section though for sure for 2007scape

Tbh I wish less pvm content was in the wildy... I don't wanna go in the wildy, and feels like I am being forced...
---
swampletics is the cure
---
lmao then stop going into the fucking wilderness
---
**Nobody** is forcing you to go there. Nobody. Not a single person. You can play the game until you max without ever having set foot in the wilderness.
---
PvMers aren't "helpless". Yeah, you're not going to get max efficiency (lmao) if you're geared to defend yourself from pkers. So what? That's **your choice**: defend yourself or maximize efficiency. Stop fucking crying, you lose like 300k max each time you die and it's **your fault for dying** in the first place. Pay attention, don't go into the wilderness, bring tank gear, don't use up all your food before you leave...you can do a lot to save your precious pixels.
---
Don't be a bitch. Nobody is forcing you to go into the wilderness, period.

I mean, do you blame them?

The only thing that spite voting is going to cause, is jagex taking the power out of the players hands on these particular instances. if they can't get PVP polls to pass and they want to retain the remaining PVPers, they will start forcing updates as QOL.
---
I used to PK a lot, hardly ever do anymore but I still see how people find it fun. It's also worth mentioning that PVP is one of OSRS's biggest draws (dmm/pk streams are highly watched) I think it's much more reasonable to vote honestly based off of content that effects you/changes that could be seen as positive for the overall game, mainly because eventually Jagex is going to take the decision making power out of the communities hand if the community can't be trusted to give genuine/constructive feedback.
---
How do I start getting into farming better monsters and bosses? I‚Äôm nearly 70 combat so I can use Chaeldar and get my slayer up. 
---
Have about 2mil gp

He still does but rarely

I was in a similar situation as you and started a new members account a few months ago. For a casual player the amount of content and goals is never ending. If you can afford it, it‚Äôs well worth it in my mind

I doubt this imp was in morytania.. lol

Its not really complaining, I do like slayer overall, but some tasks are just objectively worse cash/xp than others, or are simply more annoying and tedious to do. I only care about slayer because its combat and unlocks bosses.
---
i see youve met ironmen
---
If you're not efficient you get gulag
---
Same, voting no on it
---
Agreed
---
My idea: toss a circle around edge, you can only upgrade tiers there. 
---
Make your target the ONLY person you can fight to avoid rushers/raggers
---
Set a 1 minute timer once a fight is initiated before you can teleport out to avoid spec tabbers
---
Boy that's a whole lot of hyperbole, maybe you should take steps to educate yourself and avoid these overblown problems. Or move to Nigeria, I bet life is better there.
---
How do you know this is botting? Looks like the clicks of someone who's playing all alt or watching something at the same time
---
More like 5 uses but ok

ahrims, no hood tho
---
Recolorscape is a gateway to MTX (purchasable cosmetics).
---
*Change my mind.*
---
&gt; No one is going to risk anything when they're almost definitely going to die at some point. There's no fair fights. 
---
That's the point. Dying to pkers is something you have to accept will happen if you choose to use the Wilderness. You can't just bring max gear like everywhere else, you have to decide exactly what you are willing to risk. If you stop being a salty loser over dying in a video game you will see that it doesn't matter if you die. 
---
You say everyone should be a willing participant in PVP, but that is exactly why they put a huge message on your screen warning you not to enter if you don't want to take part in PVP. It actually blows my mind the state of whiners on this sub.
---
I think it's awesome. I am a girl if that matters. Plus if you play enough osrs to be rack 1 in something, may as well get that out there. That's a lot of time. Girls might not be into that but may as well find out early. Maybe you'll meet someone into it too. My boyfriend introduced me to osrs (and I think my account is better hee hee). It'll be a conversation starter too. Good luck dating! Hope you find someone.
---
disgusting, have an upvote
---
You're not even getting any shit of real value from killing me.  I don't care if it's the wilderness or not.  No PVP scenario should exist where someone killing a boss with less food than the person attacking gets killed for a meager 100k.  That's poor design.  The game itself is not a PVP game.  If it was Deadman mode you'd have a point but it's not.  It's people with no interest in PVP going into a PVP area to get something that shouldn't be in that area to begin with.
---
Meh he didn't say that at all. You did.
---
The osrs community has every right to be afraid of big updates such as these. Perhaps instead, they should give us beta versions to try
---
Truly a threat
---
D
---
CAn you teach me?
---
I firmly believe RS would have been a better game if either the PvP was world based (like WoW's servers) or there was a way to completely be unattackable, because I'm sick of toxic PKers ragging me anytime I'm forced into the Wilderness.
---
I think that you've missed the entire point of the wilderness. It's supposed to be dangerous and you're supposed to be cautious of just wandering in. That was the way it was designed, it is functioning as intended. If you don't like that aspect of the game, that's fine.. but the suggestion your making would be abused (being unattackable) It's  not something that's going to come with an easy fix, but something that should be compromised and made to be a little more agreeable a bit at a time.
---
Absolutely incredible.
---
It was more or less ‚Äúhere you go thanks for you help.‚Äù  We never discussed it as a payment. It was Literally a gift, i didnt think it would have been considered rwt because im not about getting banned for that shitüòÇü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è oh well question still applies .  Just an rs noob looking for guidance is allüòÇüòÇ
---
My biggest issue with teaching some of my friends is that I helped too much. All of my irl friends quit, and felt guilty doing so because they could tell that I wanted them to like the game. They probably didn't enjoy it because stuff was handed to them if they needed it and I was there to make sure they didnt fail at something. 
---
In reality, it is hard to "suck" at RuneScape compared to a FPS or RTS. Instead, someone just hasn't done enough grinding to make content manageable. 
---
Ask them what they want to do. "I want to make some steel armor to run around in" chill with them and mine some ore, maybe do knights sword to show them how questing can obtain early levels quickly.  "I want what that guy is wearing" show them how to work towards those items. "I want to have a farm and brew my own beer." Show them how to do it. 
---
Really the early game of RS is just catching the dopamine bug. Completing goals and discovering new things is the fun of it. If a player doesn't catch it or doesn't enjoy the grind, they most likely won't enjoy the game. 
---
In all, just let them ask all the questions. Tell them if they have any questions to ask, and if they need help to just say. Hang out with them so the game doesn't feel so lonely.
---
Should any of us 20-somethings really be spending our free time on Runescape?
---
They literally spelled out exactly what would happen in 41 page blog. People just chose not to read
---
this has always been the case. I'm unsure if most of the (loud) osrs players just didn't actually play rs2 or if they've just forgotten or fuck maybe they're just playing an online persona BUT for most of rs2 the wilderness was the best money maker in the game. be it pking, or bosses in the wild but it was the best place to make money that wasn't mindlessly reptitive.

the REAL problem with the wilderness is that back then everyone sucked at this game, so fights were usually fair. Now, pking requires massive knowledge of the game that isn't \*really\* official knowledge of the game. tick eating, LOS, switches, fake switches, stacking, freeze timers, etc &amp; there's nothing that teaches you these things. the LMS rework is a good START but I really hope they take the same approach to rework other aspects of the game as well that could be used to bridge this gap...like maybe castle wars for example, and hell even the duel arena (though I know stakers would shit a fucking brick if they couldn't get their fix)
---
They don‚Äôt
---
Regarding venanitis and Callisto, they‚Äôre retarded Bc they‚Äôre in essence only killed when dragged to a stupid safe spot right?
---
Like there‚Äôs no reason they should be stuck but they for some reason are and then you kill them slowly

The melee defense bonuses is basically irrelevant with level 1 defense.

I picked up learning to solve these tile puzzles just to do that damn part... Discovered for myself a technique to do them thanks to the quest

I feel like it would be super easy to catch. But I‚Äôve yet to get caught, so idk.

That's not what I mean.  You accept that you're probably going to get attacked going in there, but that doesn't mean you actually have any interest or desire to PVP.  You're there for the pet.  Don't pretend you don't know what I meant.  Just because you accept it doesn't mean it's good design.  If you want those particular pets your only choice is to deal with it.  I'm "salty" because it's a waste of my time getting killed/running away.  The majority of players seem to agree.  They all pay for the game and they have right to not want to deal with a minority of players who feel entitled to bother them.
---
They don‚Äôt target buyers for the most part. They‚Äôre more interested in removing sellers from the game than buyers.

How does Jagex prod you into the wilderness? I don't really see much essential content there, surely you could avoid it if you hate getting pk'd this much. Also how is there no way to defend yourself? Black dhide and dinhs is really strong defensive gear, and you could always bring some gear and fight back. I'm not trying to be a dick, I just genuinely have a hard time seeing what you mean
---
Where did you get this idea that I'm some entitled whiner?  I bought the pouch on my main and did wildy slayer on my IM for it already, I'm set.  I was talking about what other players may experience.  
---
Also there's a huge difference between HCs demanding access to content specifically designed to be high risk and wanting a more reasonable amount of time to earn an item that used to be buyable off the GE.  You're using a massive straw man here with arguments I've literally never seen have a positive score on this subreddit.
---
Time for some Cerb
---
This is what i dont get though. This mindset is why a new skill will never pass, etc etc. I get wanting to keep the foundation of the game the same. However updating and expanding the game should be something sought after by most gamers? The majority of people who DONT want any change dont even actively play the game..they just do AFKable activities (this makes no sense already to me, you arent even actually "playing" so why bother lol). 
---
But not wanting them to be polishing the game though to fix the coding is ridiculous
---
5 and counting
---
Could you fuck off with the item recolors? Thanks.
---
Progress will drive you, set goals. Some things to do if not already done:
---
-hard diaries
---
-quest point cape
---
-base ‚ÄúX‚Äù stats
---
-clue scroll collection log/pets
---
-try bosses/monsters you haven‚Äôt done before. Did twisted banshees early on my iron cause they were chill
---
-try to get minigame items (skill outfits, barb assault rewards, castle wars rewards, etc)
---
Or maybe make a new account. 1 def iron man? Void uim only? F2p account?
---
Cause it looks like you love questing so much based on your gear.
---
And to whoever is sending these messages, you are a textbook pussy. I don't know what messaging someone then blocking them proves exactly.

---
I don‚Äôt mind the nerf at all and I don‚Äôt pk ever but the biggest thing I got from this was that there is just a massive price point gap in tank gear vs damage gear of the same tier level. 
---
Tier 70 ranged gear which is effective for tanking magic is what like 35k for a full set including bam races while tier 70 magic gear is over 2mill. The most obvious solution would be to introduce weaker magic armour at a lower price point which ironically warding seemed to want to do lol

It's the best item to use for literally any situation where you arent fighting back. This also includes Sulliuscep mushroom wc

What do you mean by dropping runes? So with the two biggest pouches, I'll be dropping all but 4 stacks of runes every time? When do I drop them? Or is there a video?
---
I found the neckbeards ^^
---
All the ideas sound pretty good and I suck ass at pking. Just because it‚Äôs not your preference to the game doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be voted down. Lets all take a second and actually read the blog. Wildy is dead content and this could be great step in the right direction.

New accounts, specially ones with low karma, often get flagged by the automod as spam posts. What problem are you having?

The protection prayers.... How do they work? Decrease damage? Or increase misses?
---
I just leveled up my prayer enough to have protect from melee. Did a slayer task and the fire giants that had been kicking my ass hit me like 0 times as I fought three of them.
---
I'm wishing my inventory was full of prayer pots rather than food.

Hard to remember not everyone has the same level of experience. You have a point. It would difficult to make it back if you didn't know how to boss.
---

---
in most cases it just straight up negates all damage. there are exceptions, though.
---
So you're the type of person that submit those, huh?
---
The special attack is very good in barb assault.
---
That kink should honestly be trashed like the people that enjoy it
---
Why do you feel entitled to an uninterrupted pet grind in the only pvp area in the game? There is a good reason that they should be a pain in the ass and it's because they're in a pvp area, and people who like to pvp will kill you. Honestly dude it's pretty ridiculous that you feel entitled to a relaxing pvm experience  in the wilderness.
---
What a true Chad.
---
Depends how costly the weapons are, really. Will using a crazy expensive weapon that degrades in 30 mins (not 30 mins combat mind you) for like 60k loot won't become the new meta.

On the flip side, you now can‚Äôt skip a target that‚Äôs in deep wild, or other reasons, your being forced to attack your target, you can‚Äôt skip a looter, can‚Äôt Tele out to not die (as is usually the case) it seems like it‚Äôs just trying to force a death match or lose your emblem.

LOVE this. Rational thinking!
---
Really hate the other side here, I'd be more inclined to vote yes for pvp/wilderness content if I didn't get ragged for my 10 wines by some retard telling me to sit after the kill every single time I step foot in the wildy naked. 
---
So I don't vote because I'm not that petty but fuck you
---
Goblin boi
---
At this point it‚Äôs just a part of the game
---
Also don't forget this, the more we spitefully vote no to content that if not for spite voting would likely pass the more "integrity" updates we will get relating to PVP. So please, let's all be less self interested and do what is good for the game.

Im not from america so all this shit flies over my head lmao
---
It is a strawman because he had to introduce a hypothetical shield that has 90% damage reduction instead of talk about the shield at hand. He did not say that a 90% damage reduction shield should be in the game, and the severity of which was never mentioned - a specific shield with specific stats that was designed for tanking was nerfed and he didn't think it should have been.
---
It was most definitely a strawman, at the very least a poor analogy which is not an argument.
---
Well that‚Äôs just being pedantic. Rephrase the comment to be ‚Äúcan you afford spending your free time on runescape.‚Äù And not just afford financially.

At least Ilfeen got a small improvement, changing from the very informative "a female elf" to "a wandering elf". But Eluned's examine, while a tad unexpected without context, didn't need to be changed. And I feel like Ilfeen's could still be a bit better than its current too.

It is called Runecrafting; it just may have been too long of a name at the time the skill was released. But in the skill guide for Combination Runes, which were made by the skill's creator, it calls it Runecrafting.

Something like https://runescape.wiki/images/c/ca/Red_lunar_equipped.png?8aa22 looks pretty terrible, though.

There are few items among that which they listed that I believe have the potential to look good, unfortunately.

Graceful isn't that big of an issue. Condensing the full set to the ammo slot would just needlessly powercreep it. Also, what is the point of giving -20 to combat stats but then offering a quiver for ranging? Either way, this would just be a buff in some places where graceful is useful without changing anything for the majority of the game.
---
There are two reasons Graceful are prevalent. The first is that players don't realize how it works and wear it when they don't need to. But if they don't know how Graceful works and when they should and shouldn't use it, they probably also wouldn't know you could convert it into a Blessing. And the other reason is that players like how graceful look and even if it had no effect you'd still see players wearing it because of that.

---
More like Mossad. The guy's purpose was to build blackmail on white politicians who wanted access to power and wealth.
---
I think more customization for the graceful, possibly creating blessings through some new agility grind to apply moderate negative weight bonuses on an item that expires on death.
---
more color, looks, and ability to *not* wear a graceful piece but also have the tradeoff of having less negative weight bonus, but if all your pieces are either graceful or graceful blessed then you get the set bonus?

No, you didn‚Äôt but keep backpedaling

---
This just shows how biased the community is to Pkers who attack PVMers. If you want to survive and that's all by using defensive gear why should that be a problem. It's not like it's used to give an advantage when people actually want to engage. I really don't see a problem in evening the playing field against clans if someone is willing to bring the proper tank gear if all someone wants to do is get out of the widly alive.
---
The problem is with the design of the wilderness content. They make all the content designed to lure people who don't want to fight into the wilderness they don't ever design shit that makes pkers want to fight in fights that people have on even playing field with them. If they want to put PVM content out there fine but that's all they ever do as wilderness revival. They don't give players new and interesting ways to actually engage in Player vs Player content. It's just Player vs someone who doesn't even want to be out there in the first place.
---
Oh do note that it doesnt apply to untradables by default (hiding)
---
No point discussing with you anymore, Ive been pretty clear that I‚Äôm not crying about it not being pvmers faults for dying but the design philosophy being boring yet you cant grasp that. Typical spade hunter:\^) pk and pvm are both pvm in a way.
---
Let's make a reddit post of every game tick in-game!

Seriously. My god I can only imagine how annoying this kid is just from reading his comments

thats what im saying it was better when everyone was on equal ground but now theres so many budget op items that most actual good pkers use and pvmers it makes wildy shit
---
I've definitely hit 40 specs before right when I needed them. Feels good
---
Wintertodt do that till 99 takes about a week
---
It's great when questing, since reading dialogue counts as standing still for the regen buff.
---
reality is kinda like that
---
But that‚Äôs exactly the thing, when you actually need graceful you wear it. This would be matches with like combat gear and be completely useless.
---
Just a small note: you aren't adding a 'Tense' to a root verb, the (-ing) is there because they are gerund nouns.
---
Well if you use your max cape when you range now you wont see any ammo on the ground. The v head don't have alot of uses anyway and it's pretty easy to get a new one.

1. Approximately how many runes will I need for Mage Training Arena? I am trying to budget. I've looked at the Wiki and will take some strategies for that. I'm also only 65 Magic. Should I use a pot to enchant dragonstone while I am in there?
---
2. What's the best way to train Runecrafting (other than Tears of Guthix). I'm up to 45 from Tears and Quests but need to get to around 59 for the diary. I know lava runes are quick, but I don't have the magic level for the Lunar spell to make it efficient. Is there a better way? I was considering Astral runes.

Is having a pvp system that completely revolves around rooting really good for the game though? It drastically devalues the melee combat style, making it useful as a finisher only and is used mostly to kill people that haven't set up their gear to play around it. You can walk into the wildy without a range/magic switch and die without even being able to hit your attacker because you are frozen the whole time. If you do pvp with only ranged gear, that can work just fine, if you only have magic gear, its not ideal but you can fight back. In melee though? You will just die while rooted almost every single time.
---
So does all my max capes have that feature from now on?
---
I just used darts and safespoted KBD with an antifire pot TBH.
---
Wasn't the most efficient kill, but definitely the easiest way to camp it.

Chaos Ele was always flinching AFAIK, or you'd have noobs who'd eat stews/pies and actually try to fight it properly.

Any new areas worth mentioning for obtaining the scrolls or are the old guides fairly up to date? Currently 4 scrolls deep myself
---
&gt; If you want those particular pets you are forced to will with PVP. 
---
The fact that wildy pets are more desired than the actual loot from killing these bosses is the real problem. You wouldn't be complaining about getting pked if the loot from wildy bosses was better than vorkath/zulrah. Jagex keeps making new best money makers in safe/instance areas. Why aren't wildy bosses the best money makers? You might complain that teams might camp these bosses but look at the rev caves. Excellent money maker that funnels in pkers to keep everything stable. This is how the rest of the wildy should be. I can see why you would be frustrated about dying constantly when going for a pet but the loot from these bosses need major buffs. Tell me this would you still complain about dying if you had a chance of making 2m+ while going for the pet? It's 2019 and all people care about is efficiency and gp. Increase the gp from wildy activities and we'll have increased participation from pvmers and pkers.
---
It's definitely worth getting into. OSRS offers a lot of things at all sorts of skill levels and you always have something to work towards. Most things aren't just handed to you, you have to work for it. So you have the satisfaction of that as well and the endgame content is quite enjoyable and there's so much more to come. e.g. Desert Expansion, Upgraded clan system, new skill?? and more than likely more end game raids and obviously so so so much more!

The fun part of the wilderness is everything you're just describing. You know why wow vanilla was so popular? Largely because of the pvp aspect of it.
---
What made pvp different in vanilla you may ask? Because world pvp was a thing, it didn't have flying mounts so you could actually kill people randomly in the world without them flying away.
---
Pvpers would camp outside of instances where the bosses would be and kill raids for their raid buffs and stop them from entering. It was stacked against the pvmers, but the fear of suddenly being ambushed by 40 people was a part of the experience.
---
I think it‚Äôs more of an initial ‚Äúloading in‚Äù area, and over time they just left it in even though it likely isn‚Äôt needed anymore.

Sometimes you just wanna chill and make easy money, I've seen countless YouTube videos of people killing people with no gear for bank
---
‚ÄúGot any tips?‚Äù
---
Why cancel task and ruin streak-?
---
I love rendi
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna be hitting Nmz as soon as I‚Äôm 70+ atk and strength when I need to afk train
---
Aren‚Äôt nieve and duradel 100+? I know they‚Äôre better once I unlock but until I get them? Obviously I need my slayer higher but I‚Äôm not sure who to spam tasks with
---
Honestly it would be very minor powercreep. The set effect isn't that strong. But we're people playing RPGs, of course we're going to try to min-max everything.
---
I miss seeing fashionscape everywhere.
---
The app's &lt; 100mb, and uses much less per month. if ur on 1GB/month its worth it
---
Balance =/= whole new skill mate.
---
You added in a new type of boss hp bar with SOTE. Would it be an option to add these to existing bosses like raids or zulrah?
---
Never do ,,this'' again, use "instead".
---
I like the original text.  Its cute, especially considering the implications made in the new quest
---
Imagine the entire pking meta was free items you can claim from quest NPCs
---
Also, girls do play osrs... it's not 100% male playerbase. It may also be a talking point for some people, "Oh shit you play osrs? Me too", This kids smart cause when the ladies see all the guys buzzing over the nostalgia feelings he's taking to college with his backpack, there panties will drop like an anvil from a sky scraper! gl bud!
---
Why should he spend time/effort reviving some dead mushrooms just because some rando runs up and asks him to?
---
Shout out to dgfd5g, C6tgvdc, 34j78I0, dfetg45, and gfg545 for the most creative names i've seen yet.

Honorable Mentions include: Rank 217 Magic!
---
Day 2. World list: 525-513. This is an extremely small sample size given that it takes around 2-3 minutes per world. In which i'm sure I missed a lot since there are 1140 minutes in a day.
---
The red squares show accounts that have achieved over 99 magic.
---
Nah, you still won‚Äôt get laid wearing this in college
---
True.... Stay happy pvming because one day when wild or pvp is dead no ones gonna buy your pvm supply drops. I already stopped playing the game but damn this players still dont realize how pkers balance the economy.
---
Why ditch the recolours though? I don‚Äôt use a ton of those items so I‚Äôm not super fussed, but I‚Äôve seen a couple of people say this, how come?
---
D I F F E R E N T        REIGIONS
---
Yesssssss !!!!  
---
Thank you.....  
---
Has Jagex started banning them yet?
---
Smolbrain
---
The difference is that in most mmo games, there are ladders where you're pitted against players of similar skill level, whereas here, noobs like me often fight veterans in the wildy. Getting destroyed isn't fun and since my problem with PvP is panicking and having attached to the items, I have trouble learning how to efficiently PK.
---
I understand that that's my personal issue but that's the sole reason why I hate PvP.
---
&gt;As if a backpack with nerdy shit on it can prevent you from getting laid
---
LOl you‚Äôre joking right?
---
Cough it up dude
---
It wouldn‚Äôt have been a money making skill. Go read the blogs you look stupid.
---
Level 99 jigsaw piece, idiot
---
60 atk, 94 mage .. bosh
---
Yeah, but most people can't farm Vork either. For a lot of accounts with middling stats a lot of the wilderness content can be relatively mid to high reward. Even if it's not great, it can be a fun way to mix stuff up. 
---
Like I said, I don't want all content to be like that, but for some of it to have a degree of added risk and randomness isn't bad. It brings some variety and uniqueness to the game.
---
Seems like less of problem with the game and more of a personal one. I'd be curious to see what addition will replace buying rs gold.
---
Why‚Äôd you blur out the agility npc?
---
I'm sick of seeing everyone wear bandos. Let's give all the set bonuses as a blessing instead. I'm sick of seeing everyone use whip. Let's make whip equip in the ammo slot. Im sick of everyone wearing slayer helm to do slayer. Let's make the slayer helm effect permanent for everyone who has 55 slayer
---
/s
---
Run out of points/trying to get a specific task without wasting points etc its not hard to boost back a streak anyway.
---
34 here lol
---
BH skins are the most disgusting piece of content aside from NMZ
---
Obviously, you don't know how getting laid works. You don't wear anything while getting laid.
---
A lot of neat sounding shit that the community will just vote down in the polls.
---
Some people in the wildy take their skills for granite.
---
Because either you would just unequip it when you wanted to hit things, which takes up a single inventory slot and would be OP, or you have a cool down on when you stats reset, which would make it unused.
---
Sure it would have a tiny niche of something like agility training or Zeah RCIng where you don't need to go into combat after running, but that seems silly to me. Why would the set specifically made for running places not be used?
---
Imagine not just condoning but openly and actively encouraging zoophilia 
---
YOU‚ÄôRE the ones that are fucked in the head. NOT us.
---
Thank god we know that reddit isn't the player base. im going to trust /vg/ over you guys
---
1440* but good observations.
---
Recess? How old are you?
---
the -18 magic nerf is much more impactful than the -10 all, which doesn't really do much
---
Lol i hope you're joking.
---
Brb making granite warlock for bh2
---
Imagine skilling tho, would be pretty fuckin aids
---
Yeah the suggested content is a good rework to BH, but people complaining about low risk pkers just need to realise that this will always exist.
---
Idk, but what‚Äôs your method? I really need to work on con cheaply.
---
Yikes! I didn‚Äôt even think about that. Wowsa I better go through the stronghold of security again and freshen up my safety knowledge!
---
Thank you for doing this
---
Surely it wouldn‚Äôt be more than what mobile brought in  (even though only 10k have stuck around since mobile release)
---
You also need the magic level, significant for times like zalcano and the like
---
Well done, nobody cares
---
voting no purely because of those private server re colors
---
As a maxed combat main, I really hope this passes. It will motivate more people to fight each other rather than hunt PvMers, and hopefully it gets some new people into PKing so I can start to learn too.
---
The reason I haven‚Äôt tried pking yet is because the current PVP is next to impossible to get into, as the only option for me is to do Dharok pking, or hop right into tribriding with no prior experience.
---
It would be incredible if we could get some kind of system that would match me with someone if equal (terrible at pking) skill level and I would not need to worry about going against someone who has been pking for years, and tribriding would seem more approachable. 
---
There would be prestige much greater than there is now, where I know a few names in pking like Torvesta and B0aty, but something more to work towards.
---
Thanks for always improving the game we love.
---
I feel like we all gave him a best effort here to avoid the emotional trauma that is going to be his life for awhile.
---
At least you finished nice and early.
---
Yeah agreed until come gobshite comes flying at you like a kamikaze bomber lashing out 60s left right and centre but you're main handing an ags with a legend's cape and this cats in elite void.
---
Like if there was one thing I could look at as my runescape character dies itd probably be one of the very last.
---
It needs negative magic bonus tbh
---
I think the fundamental problems with the wilderness these days are more about the fact that PvMers have no chance against someone or a team geared for PvP. They have hardly updated actual deep wilderness PvP since moving from classic to RS2, and I'd argue it's probably only gotten less and less popular since then since the mechanics are really not done well. The only PvP that's really popular is the 1v1 battles everyone knows and loves. 
---
Actually putting rewarding content there would be fine if they went about it in the right way. By this I also mean their development team should be big enough that their PvM content creators shouldn't stop developing the content everyone enjoys to add stuff to the wilderness, they should have a separate team for that.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd advise against wearing that in public
---
Untradables convert to cash but you have to buy them back with a higher price.
---
I don't really get what your comment is saying. I get the disparity in price between magic gear and ranged, but I don't see what that has to do with damage vs tanking. Dps is almost always prioritized in this game over defence. Almost no content has tank gear as bis.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Because it is already such a good weapon with a really good do‚Äôs, it would be too OP if the spec was good. That‚Äôs why the whip has a shit spec too but the granite maul has an amazing spec
---
Have you forgotten what happened to this game when Jagex removed the wilderness? I'm gonna go head and guess you haven't been playing that long.
---
&gt; Might as well just be moved out of the wilderness at this point.
---
I agree.  I dont really think it is in anyway similar to actual wildy bosses.  I'm not sure their thought process of putting something in the Wildy just to put a tele into a safespot, but its pretty bad logic.  I think its also bad logic to lock a BiS half a bil item behind any Wildy boss which is the only reason I think it is at all ok for the tele to be into a safezone.  
---
But totally agree, its not a wildy boss and should be removed from the wildy imo.
---
Thats a shit argument and you know it, str and atk are both offensive.
---
Gz! Huge milestone
---
My pking days are long gone. The days of 3 hitting people at the castle north of edgeville in rsc was my prime. I remember how much fun it was. I'll always vote yes for pking content even tho now whenever I'm in the wild I get smacked so fast.
---
Uh oh, you didnt block out stamina kid, say goodbye to that gp stack.
---
Switch has a touchscreen so I reckon the experience will be at least, if not better, than mobile considering that it also have physical buttons.
---
LOL @ map
---
He‚Äôs gonna at the very least make friends. Even the cool kids plaid runescape lets be real here. Women won‚Äôt care that much it isn‚Äôt high school.
---
Why is the dinh user just able to be exempt from all wilderness risk though
---
Even incredibly high tier magic gear can hardly put a dent on it
---
You don't need to make an analogy after all of the explanation of: Choosing a dmace, when you have the option of a AGS, is foolish. 
---
Choosing a dmace, when you have the option of a DDS, is foolish
---
Choosing a dmace, when you are a USDA certified "Fuckin' virgin", is a surefire way to get paid and get laid.
---
Love me some quad tips.

Sir I feel this could use wholesome. Thinking of the other spectrum despite not liking dealing with them
---
For NPCs that have a 'Talk' and Pickpocket' right click option, can you please rearrange the order these appear so pickpocket is left click? 
---
Players will thieve from these NPCs thousands of times, but talk to them once, if at all.  The talk option is almost redundant.
---
The touchscreen is really bad tho. It‚Äôs there but rarely used
---
PLAID
---
Reddit community has pack mentality and agrees with whatever the "cool" opinion is.
---
I just do oak larders, then use whatever teak/mahogany planks I happen to have banked.
---
how do you get exp for the vorki heads?
---
wtf the anti-cheating team even do during the day lol. prob drink coffee and watch premier league. 
---
their system must suck if someone could hit 67m magic xp without a ban
---
This is sick
---
lol
---
More unpolled changes. Is anyone surprised at this point?
---
There's nature runes there too, it means 'alch yourself.'
---
this why are we pandering to pkers its such a cancerous community theyre never going to be happy or content and they'll always moan and whine
---
The mechanics of pvp are dreadful in this game. There is a reason it is dying.
---
Yikes
---
The most memeable animal
---
and 2 draconic...
---
You are going to be relentlessly bullied, good luck my friend.
---
Yeah but don't you value the 20+ hours of your own time you'd have to grind to literally just pay for the bond, then you have zero cash to enjoy yourself without worrying about grinding again for the bond. 1 hour of my time in my irl job is easy so I can enjoy a whole month of rs.
---
1 in nearly 1k. Alch urself sir
---
it's not a small gold sink, it's literally a 33% gold sink on top of already losing a lot on supplies.
---
Imagine if you did a 100m stake, won &amp; got 150m back, that's basically what you're suggesting when you take supplies into account
---
use them on the dark altar thingy in zeah. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dark_Altar
---
Damn son, he has a family
---
Meanwhile I'm getting 1 shard in 1300 kills
---
Thanks for the advice, much appreciated!
---
the mechanics are the only reason pvp exists in this game lmfao
---
Is knightenator famous?
---
Then make it smaller. Like is said, nothing is written in stone. It's a suggestion
---
oh... gross. id rather just get a bunch of devices and use the bones you get on altars
---
One
---
 *Did you see that ludicrous display last night?*
---
Good thing I phrased it as my opinion
---
they make the game look even more of a private server/rs3
---
Never claimed that they are worthless, just said they happened to be banked(there werent many of them, a couple hundred from clues) so I only used 2,5m cash. 
---
Oak larders still don't cost much at all, especially if you make the planks yourself.
---
Because people just default to graceful for the stamina regen (which isn't as useful as many believe)
---
I use grace top/bottom to keep weight at/below 0 for most activities, but the rest of the slots are fashion items.
---
i imagine they wait for your posts, do a 2 minute check on the accounts, ban them and call it a day
---
:I   &gt;:(
---
Get your salty toxic ass out of here. Your comments in this thread are a fucking eye sore.
---
Mosr highschoolers dont even know what runescape is
---
Really? I didn‚Äôt think they were that bad to be honest. Oh well, doesn‚Äôt affect me much.
---
gmaul, amazing spec? is that why i always hit 0 0? hmmmmmmmm
---
Looks like they‚Äôve been running some of those bots for a very long time, kinda negates the entire opportunity cost issue if they never get banned
---
if you hover your mouse over your food and press mouse 1 the hotkey works buddy
---
Judging by the *teleport times* it‚Äôs around 2-3 minutes, that‚Äôs why I wait around in each world (incase some are banking/in the instance already).
---
It's time Zulrah is locked behind another quest, such as SOE. The amount of wealth coming into this game as a result of Zulrah bots cannot be put into words. It is literally destroying certain parts of the economy.
---
Which ones do you have left?
---
Champion's Challenge, which involves killing 10 specific monster types for 1/5000 drops then doing a mini boss battle and getting slayer xp
---
100%ing the minigame gives you this cape
---
I believe Mod Lottie had some statistics on her twitter a while back, i‚Äôll try find the link and edit this comment
---
Am i wrong in thinking the ags and other pvp weapons are able to do similar damage in a similar timescale causing people to also safe? Watching pking, seeing someone do a perfectly timed gmaul KO is so exciting compared to the majority of other weapons for me. 
---
The whole game is based on rng; if you don‚Äôt like that i would suggest playing a more skill based game.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why things that have always been as they are suddenly need changing. These items were as they are now back when the wildy was busy pre eoc, does that not prove these items are not part of the issues with the wildy and pking?  
---
The suggestion that black dhide should be changed worries me greatly. Even more so than the changed mentioned in the blog. The bulwark is relatively new and so i maybe understand some of the discussion here.
---
If you cant hit on someone, bring better gear with better accuracy. Don‚Äôt complain that items that have been in the game for years suddenly need changing.
---
Jusg the achievement of getting all 10 1/5k scrolls. Cape has no stats or anything.
---
I've been doing some high level gambles too, with a good team BA is so fun
---
I loved Roys reaction to that whole scenario. Just throws his arms up like what the hell
---
This is a question that will never be answered
---
How long is forever? o.o nice! :D me1 was easy and part 2 took a while but was easy too! I‚Äôll be trying one Friday when I‚Äôm off of work.. don‚Äôt know which to do first.. getting anxious about having to do the final bosses
---
Thanks for the account
---
Yes, cause 5m is not much and anyone can purchase one. Divine would be very seldom seen since its so expensive.
---
Im like 99% sure u cant have 13 prayer and accumulator you can have 13 prayer and ancients but not accumulator. And for the ancients yeah you just dont finish the quest
---
Evemtually yeah
---
Same, I ended up asking my mom. Saved me 200k, which was like my whole cash stack lol
---
You only need ecto tokens not the actual quest completed
---
Fk it ill try and ill see if i can then
---
well technically you got crashed by a cannon
---
Just wait 5 min.
---
Worst title on the planet
---
Bruh, when you have a hcim that is so advanced they can do ToB, you probably got there by not taking major risks, and will continue not doing so
---
## bruh üôåüòÇüôåü§°ü§°
---
I'll always be voting no to PvP updates...95% of the PvP community is scum and there's enough people playing the game for it to survive without them
---
if you think it's just the pvp community who are toxic, you are mistaken.
---
this is online gaming in a nutshell, if you can't handle it, you know where the log out button is! I know it shouldn't be like that, but it is.
---
Source on this statistic?
---
Actualy forgot about that item. So u just get the tokens with ur ghost speak qmulet and u can keep that sweet 13 pray?
---
Cool.
---
Two of those are quest items.  
---
And I don't think they've been in the game since the start,
---
Or when he‚Äôs crying in the car with no lights saying it

---
To be fair, throwing dead babies over the top in front of the authorities is a bad idea
---
I feel bad for all you guys :(
---
Own who you are and have some damn self confidence!
---
What gear are you using? I was at 60 def and tanked them easily with black dhide
---
Fair
---
Agree
---
I feel like we may be the same person
---
Already have that listed with herbivore and zeah rc
---
But if you get it like 2nd go you wasted 26 fight cave runs that's so many hours
---
I guess i need to pray more for the rng god
---
Senventior disthine molenko!
---
Try to get zulrah on a slayer task, that slayer helm helps a bunch.
---
Sup gay cunt
---
Yes
---
You can just reclaim it if you ever want it again.
---
I don‚Äôt want to tell other people to think this way, but getting into programming has made me feel much different about runescape and video games in general.
---
When I think about what is really happening behind the scenes, everything is an instance of some blueprint that is being instantiated in the game. Your interaction with those instances is a function with some inputs related to how much time you‚Äôve clicked to level up, and your outcome is determined by RNG. Sure, you can make your RNG more favorable, but the work required to do that has seemed less attractive to me.
---
I think I need to challenge myself in the game to make it feel like I have skills that are unique to me. Tough bosses or even PKing might bring me back again. I think I got so burnt out with skilling that I forgot there are parts to the game that require more than just XP and your time.
---
This. And i hope they would do this stuff more often.
---
Yeah which is pointless, look at your screenshots the detection system hasn't caught players in 99+ xp, these bots have probably been going since 85 magic
---
Lol funny word play
---
He's making silly jokes must be a kid right, 11 btw
---
A lot of the proposed updates (recolours aside) will be game changing for PVP, in a good way. The BH updates, adding new PVP and corrupted weapons, and the general restructuring of BH will all be amazing updates, and help make steps in the right direction for brining new players in to PvP, and retaining the veterans. Updates like the Gmaul changes will shake things up, making PvP in general less stale too. It‚Äôs all going to add variety to PKing again, and all of this alongside LMS too. Actually excited for once about PvP updates, and glad to see non-pkers supporting!
---
Delet zulrah poll
---
What is the intent of the Ancient Warrior Equipment? Will it's stats be nerfed or will we get them as they are in DMM? Will they degrade like their original incarnations?
---
In addition, instead of them being restricted to the Wilderness how about the stats are nerfed but while in the wilderness they have a X% Accuracy/Damage Buff against everything that would bring them up to the intended stats as well as not degrading while outside of the Wilderness?
---
I and pretty much everyone in my clan (Currently about 50 people) currently feel we do not need a progression of gear when it comes to PVP and would prefer if their stats were nerfed down to Tier 75. The reasoning for this is that the special attacks are fine, however the stats aren't as an example you can look at Vesta's Longsword and the Godswords side to side and see the Vesta's Longsword is nearly a faster Godsword with a different special and with how hard a Godsword can slap this makes it a fairly overpowered weapon. We don't think that you are aware of how these weapons would affect PVP as it won't be like in DMM where it's varied, people WONT vary their gear and will ONLY use Ancient Warrior Weapons (excluding the Crossbow as Blowpipe out tiers it) just like when Rev Caves were introduced in the Main Game it will become the weapons people use until new power creep dethrones them so I feel that we should continue to have sidegrades; If anything I'd be fine with it staying the current level requirements while downgrading it's stats to Tier 75 as the Specials are powerful in their own respect.
---
mage cape?
---
Nice build but what does this have to do with Nostalgiascape?
---
That cc is cancer
---
I got my first at ~325 and second at 386
---
There are bots that make bots for f2p. They do ban many of them in waves for a few reasons. P2p does not have this problem because the investment cost. But honestly i feel like no matter where you are in this game now people will talk to you if they arnt afk. It feels more social now than ever before. 
---
Maybe buy your first membership and spends a few hours every 2 weeks making money to buy another bind
---
I use suffering for the prayer bonus but if you don‚Äôt have one the explorers ring also gives a small pray bonus and a few alchs.
---
It doesn't matter how many reqs Zulrah gets locked behind because once they do the quest on the account they farm forever and never get banned. 
---
Jagex needs to seriously improve their bot detection methods but it doesn't seem like they want to do anything. I'd bet a decent chunk of the game's membership revenue comes from botted accounts.
---
Haven't unlocked superior slayer monsters (dont know what hat they are). I have the imbued slayer helm and imbued berserker ring. Don't think i have the slayer ring. Should i get it? Ive only been using duradel. Honestly, i really don't get slayer, it completely baffles me. Im mainly getting 130 greater demons/fire giants. And no ive been given 180 black demons. Im just lost tbh
---
No you just like to argue about opinionated stuff. I looked through your comments and it‚Äôs you just picking political fights lmao
---
&gt; But you definitely won't be training 90-99 bossing, since they don't have great xp p/h 
---
Not entirely true. Granted, this is with max gear (Scythe etc), but ToB can hit 60k+ xp/h. On my alt I've trained from 90-99 atk, 90-99 str, 90-96 def, 90-98 range, and 94-96 mage mostly via ToB. My main also has 45m ranged XP and 22m magic XP, most post 99 from CoX/ToB (On top of 20m atk, 35m str).
---
What if the UI was added to the quest tab or the Bh minigame teleport menu
---
It's really easy to join, all ya gotta do is just eat a magic eel...
---
If you‚Äôre playing for the nostalgia then the bots should be apart of it. Yew botters have been around since I was a child.
---
O shit waddup
---
You got lucky, wilderness isn't dead
---
Vorkath is comparable money wise and requires 200 quest points so definitely needs higher requirements
---
Appended your link to my old WR video.
---
Grats again :p
---
It‚Äôs not even remotely the same, actually. One is pinnacle PvM content and the other is just wanting to do a clue scroll without being harassed. Besides, you‚Äôre kinda proving my point about PKers being toxic as fuck. 
---
&gt;	You don‚Äôt have a choice 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs **kind of my entire point, actually**.
---
Can confirm first hand. You need to kill things more. Ty.
---
Wtf
---
Muahahha bow down to your skilling overlords
---
So many CC members here, neat
---
Bot until you're permanently banned. /thread
---
Vork is a ton easier and better money.
---
1 is not necessarily true, especially because of 6. I‚Äôm personally likely to vote yes to most of these but not because of unfounded assumptions like that.
---
More people in the wildy means more risk being there. Even if as you claim, these people are ultimately there to PK for money, they have to get to the PK spots somehow, and that means running right past spots like black salamanders or other skilling/ clue hunting locations. We have absolutely no reason to believe they won‚Äôt continue to the attack people they see there, and thus no reason to believe that non pkers will be any safer.
---
Racism
---
Yeah, but that‚Äôs not what this is. This is me telling you that by definition your actions toward some people is sociopathic. Not attacking you here bud, just trying to help.
---
It cannot be contained.
---

Cutting sulliusceps at fossil island took me from 78-82 quite quickly, also banking all the small, med and large fossils that you receive - can turn into Varrock museum for Xp lamps to use in another skill (I chose RC ofc)
---
I hope you stay away if it was a problem for you. Best wishes!
---
Fuck, I would've had your account if you hadn't blurred your prayer points! I'll have you next time!
---
I wonder if damaging him after he's fully healed but before killing the last healer works
---
The problem with that thought comes when 30 thousand of said item are dumped in the ge every single day by crafters.
---
Just to make it more accessible. Despite being really cheap it still has a high upkeep cost (upwards of 2m/h)
---
Idk if you're dumb or some shit but that pmod could have muted him.
---
Except the pkers don't lower the amount of loot gotten from rev caves that much, they just redistribute where the loot it going. Sure some loot is left on the ground but that's a mostly trivial amount.
---
Lol nice way to find a decent little moneymaker.
---
You dont need that many scales for that lmao

I wasn't aware of the existence of the cabbage gang before we did this, but this was actually an unrelated event done by my clan. We actually did 301, 302, 330, 377, and 302 Duel Arena all-in-all.
---
Cough *clanwars* cough
---
never heard of supply and demand?
---
&gt;point number 1
---
If you think this will make revs less populated by pkers you're dead wrong
---
I wish they would do this but I can see Jagex unable to justify it since you can't play it outside wifi and "You have a PC."
---
Well too bad then. When you finally leave your moms basement and get a job, you‚Äôre going to be told what to do on a regular basis!
---
Nailing it like your mom
---
Yeah it needs a new requirement but SotE seems a bit steep. Maybe MEP2?
---
Imagine wondering why people kill you on sight when you sperg out like this on reddit
---
People from Venezuela can play. It only becomes gold farming when they give gold to a known gold selling account.
---
I want a pink torso
---
Fake. Doesn't have all the runelite overlays
---
Your opinion can be whatever you want it to be, it doesn't change the fact that it's an extremely poor opinion.  Abusing game mechanics to the detriment of other players in PvP is always poor game design.
---
Ok, let‚Äôs ignore all the important points that actually give really good reasons to vote yes, and vote no instead because I don‚Äôt like people even SUGGESTING that I should do anything! Get your head out of your ass.
---
Where‚Äôs the link?
---
This happens to me on my farm runs
---
Ngl I‚Äôm not a pker and have only recently got enough cash to be comfortable losing things in the wildy, so I‚Äôve started doing more wildy slayer.  It‚Äôs scary, but like good scary, I feel an edge playing the game in that way that other stuff doesn‚Äôt have.  Like watching the minimap like a hawk, being ready to tele or log or something else ASAP that sort of thing.  I get how it wouldn‚Äôt be for everyone but it‚Äôs exciting now that losing a 12k set of black d‚Äôhide isn‚Äôt bankrupting me
---
Do block lists carry between slayer masters? Currently using Konar but can't decide whether to use her or Nieve now I'm 88cb and don't wanna spend points on blocking Konars tasks for nothing. Thanks!
---
Lol no.
---
The touchscreen on the switch is way better than on most phones if you compare mobile games that are on both. 
---
Is it as responsive as a new $1200 smartphone or $1500 tablet? No. But it costs a fraction of that and it‚Äôs bigger than the phone so it‚Äôs easier to tap correctly.
---
The clans are using the shield too, making it impossible to kill each other, that's why this is getting so much attention. 
---
" If you want to survive and that's all by using defensive gear why should that be a problem"  
---
Because the wilderness isn't supposed to be safe. Why shouldn't a setting be added to disable pvp in the wilderness for players who want to safely farm content? Why shouldn't they be able to safely farm content that was designed for a dangerous wilderness and, without that danger, is OP? Why should it be possible to attack pvmers at revs if they just want to get 2m an hour from npcs that literally do zero damage to them? Just add a setting to disable pvp right?
---
Because that is almost the same thing as this shield, the shield is that strong. Luckily, in multi you can still die with it so we are not there yet, although if reddit had their way (they don't, Jagex knows there is an issue) they would probably buff the shield lmao. I can hear it right now. ThE shIeLd iS suPpOsEd To TaNk, wHy iS a 30 mAn TeAm aBle To KilL mEE 50% oF thE TiMe??
---
When‚Äôs a good lvl to get membership, I‚Äôm on the fence about getting right away as I‚Äôm approaching 45 on str, att, and def. but I mainly just afk train on mobile for now until I buy a laptop.
---
The fact the devs of osrs are suggesting shite like this just gives me no hope in them, i'd be interested to know who it is so they can never suggest an update again. However i think all the devs pitch in with update ideas, some of which clearly dont play the game as we've seen with this absolutely terrible idea.
---
I hit bp spec on ahrim every time but nothing else
---
Wh-where is the monster energy drink?
---
That's not true, Zulrah bots are banned frequently.  There is no such thing as a 'safe' Zulrah bot.  This is also why many players have spoken to increase the requirements for farming zulrah, since many of the bots are so freshly created.
---
Okay so essentially if you try to kill a lvl 2 man, your actions are displayed as text? And you control is by typing the text? Similar to those Twitch plays games streams where you type a command and it does it?
---
That looks really nice, which website did you use?
---
If that argument was valid you wouldn‚Äôt be able to play it on phones and tablets.
---
kinda cute the new generation of gamers lol
---
Everything but the 2-3 boss fights is stupid easy. Now those boss fights is when the difficulty starts
---
Prayer. Religious reasons.

Hold up is this actually fucking true that, that works? Or am I a sperg for falling for this

Just make sure you're using the upgraded staff, it's way to costly without it
---
Like, mobile-only? Or, play on mobile at all? I play mobile all the time. On the shitter? Hop on for a few mins just for some gains. Work going slow? You know I'm getting gains then.
---
Oock?

Thanks for your well thought out comment. Very creative!
---
Thanks! had the same problem

He's not cancelling if he's doing what I think he's doing he is point boosting by completing tasks 1-9 at turael for 0 points and then doing the 10th task at konar for a big point drop.
---
Less Slayer xp but it's necessary if you're focusing on Hydra like myself and need to be on task to kill the boss.
---
Rev's will always be a place to be pked at since the drops are so good there
---
Well yeah but now you're Reddit famous so jagex probably looks at your reports. It's like sir pugger, jagex cares a lot more when they have Reddit checking if they ban bots.
---
I totally understand your position. I'm married with my second kid on the way so my play time is pretty limited but I make the most of my free time if I have nothing to do I'll manage to do farm runs, Slayer tasks, etc. Just do whatever you enjoy and the small window of play time you have will feel worth it if you actually enjoy the game as a whole.
---
And what conclusion did they come to?
---
Side Note - What happened to Sir Pugger lol
---
That feeling when bots can do zulrah and you can't as a legit human being ; ;
---
100% agree
---
The PvPers fought back and voted no to Warding. The endless cycle we live in
---
I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs a btw btw
---
In addition to that you can right click quests and diaries to go to their page
---
bruh.exe
---
You can further mitigate the issue by providing additional requirements. Locking the boss behind a quest that requires some degree of effort would be considered sensible. Obviously it is not going to stop the issue entirely but it will help. 
---
Just so you're aware, a member of this forum openly admitted to running over 52 bots concurrently for Zulrah some weeks ago. I cannot even contemplate the amount of gold he would have introduced to the game from that.
---
My God you have such an innocent mind. Pking will be dead shortly after the content update because of clans.
---
I thought it gave you extra hp when you used your humanity on a bonfire?
---

---
You do realize Bounty Hunter is solo content? like 1v1? Braindead comment of the day. NEXT!!

Nah, no thanks. If we don't vote in new PK content it will keep dying out and I might finally be able to pet hunt in peace.
---

warding lul
---
I vote for pvp updates because just like pve and skilling, the wilderness deserves content too. It keeps people playing the game.
---
Ah shit. Here we go again.
---
Other way around, the BCP is for noobs who need defence. Torso is for Chad's who just want to pummel their opponents back to lumby.
---
Thats awesome! I had someone donate damn near full Dragon Armour to me, and another kind soul gave me about 10m. I have tried to pay that back by giving randoms couple hundred k :)
---
Switches don't have data tho
---
Bout a year late there
---
Niaseeeeeeeeeee
---
Beastly pet, parade him around town :)
---
Hey, I appreciate you exposing these bots and I hope it‚Äôs working (as in jagex finally actually banning them even though they HAD to know these guys were botting forever now).
---
Can you expose or look into the constant stream of obvious rc bots Edgeville?
---
I mean, I get it, I really do.
---
 I personally have no say in this but if the community declined warding because of "change will ruin the game" then this seems logical to me. No change for everyone then. In theory, everyone should be happy. In reality tho, everyone's mad lol!
---
 south park done it but they only killed level 1 boars and that's impossible to max that way. So this guy found different levels of boars and figured out how to progressively do it legit. So it's not really a lazy video.
---
So, where is that blowpipe accuracy nerf?
---
Jagex: Maybe you plebs didn‚Äôt understand us when you were asked for your ‚Äúopinion‚Äù.
---
This is The BiS gear you buy if you have 0 skill and don‚Äôt know any better
---
If the crux of the problem is the ability to get ‚Äútricked‚Äù out of months worth of progress (in lost items) then nothing will likely placate you. The reason these mechanics in other games are as ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù as in RuneScape is because 99% of other games don‚Äôt have a situation in which you can lose months of progress. MMOs as a genre are unique in that regard. If you get skull tricked into losing 50k you‚Äôre not going to bat an eye. Just like if I get killed in one round of CSGO because of latency I‚Äôm not going to lose my mind because it‚Äôs a drop in the bucket (and on that note Valve could up their official MM servers to 64-tick instead of 32-tick, that would help ease some perceived jankiness and lagginess. Every other 3rd party uses 64-tick).
---
This is just a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù with MMOs in general. There isn‚Äôt a single other genre of game (looter shooters maybe?) where a death sets your account back months. That‚Äôs why skull tricking seems unfair and garbage game design, because of what you‚Äôre poised to lose, not because it‚Äôs actually that much of a cancer. If it was impossible to lose more than 100k in the wildy no one would give a fuck about dying or skull trickers.
---
Send.
---
no u
---
Yea that did the trick, it seems to be linked to the ip address of certain companies maybe. I even changed my ip to make it static with my router and no luck but as soon as I changed to my mobile network I could log in.
---
No you both
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/Ju8h3gs.jpg) you go.

The bots found him.. we have to protect op while he does God's work
---
I was with ya' for the 1st half but you lost me here
---
Lmao. Sorry, your Highness. I am sure your lovely in-game attitude is helping the slaying community grow and flourish!
---
yes they do because once they kill zulrah they will have more scales than they can blow
---
Okayden
---
I‚Äôm mean...you‚Äôre not wrong.
---
Just compliment the art or don‚Äôt comment at all. This is just sad
---
Maybe, just maybe, they're better at programming bots than you
---
Prifddinas is RS3?
---
Snowflake ironmen existed before swampletics
---
thx for everyone who not helped me and got a younger old mom xD
---
The comments were pretty toxic but IDK whats worse online hate or IRL hate
---
sadly cosmetics don't hold any value on OSRS since the graphics are so bad. Just look at the cosmetics items from clue scrolls, most of them are worthless unless they are really rare. Back in 08 when we had HD cosmetics had value because they were appealing.
---
It's more of just building my account up, wasn't sure, which way was better to do in the long run!
---
11 inches deep in your ma
---
I'm not too sure about the rcing bots, considering it's hard to judge which account is botting or just an alt imo. 
---
Do you know any things that make these bots 'obvious' or stand out that they are actually a bot, rather than an alt or another player?
---
Or American. I'm not even Jewish.
---
Me too please!
---
Just building my account really!
---
Botting 99 magic with autoclick is literally the lowest and most ‚Äúwho gives a shit‚Äù level of botting. I‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôd put it in the same realm as a sophisticated zulrah bot. A bot can do pvm that a bunch of humans can‚Äôt even do.
---
Couldn't the Deadman Armour have the stats of iron armour? IMO, armour cosmetics should have stats for thematic reasons.
---
lmao this isn't gunna lessen the membership purchasing by much if any, people are still gunna find other things to bot and buy bonds for those bots as well.
---
The axe and pet wow
---
Where are the negative xp lamps?
---
make smart choices and avoid the deadlier things in life, such as public school shootings, public shootings in other areas, sickness, or being a minority
---
The card game was amazing! I actually miss ff9 and 10 so much. Ff10 had the best, most emotional storyline ever!
---
perfection
---
The issue with dark souls opt in pvp is first, wilderness is essentially opt in. Second, the opt in for dark souls doesnt give you the ability to get better gear. Its sole purpose is to fight other players or specifically come into their game while you're online to mess their shit up to give it more artificial risk to keep people playing past the first run through. 
---
Osrs hiding gear and content behind an *actual* opt in barrier like making only people who elect to pvp be able to be attacked in the wilderness is 100% the wrong thing to do and just creates another zulrah level fuck up to the economy, because now every op xp rate or boss is now incredibly easy. Chaos alter? Both other alters are now useless. Bosses? People now use bis gear and camp it. Extremely easy. Black Chins. Botted easily.
---
But also, making the wilderness devoid of literally any content because you dont want to pvp to get to it but jagex doesnt want to change the mechanics of the wilderness is ***also*** the wrong thing to do. You don't need to have a wilderness to do that. A clan was portal can do that, but having "best in game" xp rates like the chaos alter need to have inherent risk factors or they're completely unbalanced, so deleting the wilderness pvp element throws everything off.
---
It's either you keep the basic mechanics and set up how it is now and make tiny tweaks, or you get rid of the pvp element ***and*** all content in the wilderness from the game too, vice reinventing literally everything they've already put into the game in the wild already, which we all know wont happen
---
OCKo?
---
/r/rs3ironmen is an amazing resource too, a very helpful community
---
You can ignore online hate irl hate not so much
---
If you have the elite Lumbridge diary complete, you can bring the Explorers Ring 4 to high alch up to 30 items for free
---
Even with the predictable phase cycles, Zulrah is one of the harder bosses in game. Not the hardest, but certainly not easy.
---
link?
---
Sad that people are toxic and childish
---
real ironmen get their axe from lava drags
---
Probably is a bias. Like most things, people notice losses way more than wins. Every time you hit a spec, you don‚Äôt really consciously remember it. But when you miss, you remember as the impact of not hitting is larger.
---
When you die in a pvp zone and get mad that there‚Äôs pvpers in it
---
Really? That‚Äôs a bop

It's rs3 art.. it's good, but why is it here?

Lmao.

JustBootLickerThings

You have some serious talent...my gawd that is awesome!
---
Yep, theyre tradeable, just getting the newspost updated now :)
---
I mean if you play 2 hrs day maybe three. Times a week that is ~24hrs a month of entertainment for 11 bucks. Thats a pretty good return on your money
---
Posting nine links to heraldic armors does not mean you have nine separate points.
---
It's pretty sad because pk is kinda dying, so all there's left is multi clans &amp; some noobs bullying pvm'ers &amp; skillers
---
Please poll minus XP lamps!
---
Yeah, but that‚Äôs a choice. You don‚Äôt HAVE to go for all pets
---
Seriously though if this game was only half as grindy as it is we could all spend more time on drawing porn for it
---
You can play the game without it if you‚Äôre afraid of being hardcore on your hardcore
---
‚ÄòRs3 reeee, but pls giv us rs3 qol changes‚Äô
---
Yes there is
---
Not according to the last sentence in the overview.
---
Just wondering what recent recolors have they put in game? I really can't think of any within the last year.
---
More crossover, though. People who own switches are *already* gamers, it's just a matter of genre-jumping.
---
&gt;Pures are a big part of PKing
---
They‚Äôre a novelty account type that the game shouldn‚Äôt cater to. Like, I understand they exist, but if you‚Äôre stupid enough to ‚Äúruin‚Äù your own novelty account then that‚Äôs your fault, Jagex shouldn‚Äôt be concerned about them unless it‚Äôs actually their fault (like the combat style bug a few months back).
---
I like killstreaks
---
Player bounties are okay
---
New bh shop: crates/pouch seem ok since it's just bonus loot from kills. Plz no more cosmetics I hate them.
---
Crate bonus rewards: pvp weps are too strong (see Mika), others are fine.
---
Why do emblems need to be removed from wildy slayer?
---
Other emblem changes are fine.
---
Not responding on alts is really normal IMO, I usually run 2-3 accounts, 2 is whatever but whenever I run 3 I really don't respond to a single thing on the afkable ones, even if I do see someone talking to me.
---
As for there being more on the weekends I would think that's more likely behavior of real players? at least if I was botting things like that on accounts with nothing but that on them I would just do it all week, why limit it to 2 days if you can just as easily do 7? 
---
Unless bots in this game are high maintenance, never tried botting in this game but my experience from other games botting is really low effort, that's kind of the point as far as I understand it lmao.
---
As for 50M fishing xp, with a game out this long that seems fairly reeasonable for an alt of someone that plays a lot.
---
Assuming the other guy was correct that 100M fishing xp = roughly 4000 hours, 2000 really isn't all that long over 3-6 years of afking.
---
Keep in mind that afk fishing on alts was a thing before zulrah, People have been afking sharks since release pretty much.
---
Yes it‚Äôs a seed now or whatever
---
cosmetics are great if they are attached to some sort of achievement though. third-age armour is essentially cosmetic but it shows some sort of achievement, be it extreme luck or extreme wealth.
---
many have the gear they have because they think it looks good not because they're using it efficiently.
---
Haha ik ook^^^^^c
---
2 PvP design blogs 2 days in a row, must be an unbeatable record.
---
* I get your reasonings behind boosting for points by leaving the arena immediately, but on the other hand the higher the points for participating are, the more noob-friendly it is. Do you think it will stay popular among the more casual playerbase after the initial launch hype? Because I imagine many players will try this, get rekt, see they get almost no points and deem this as a waste of time.
---
* Will the 3-tick weapon be tradeable? If not, what would you get if you kill someone risking it?
---
* While the XP rewards wouldn't be better than PC, they could still offer some new methods for super niche accounts, for instance defence training sub-40 cb level. That could be a good thing though.
---
* As others have pointed out, the loot from exchanging points should not be available to ironmen, as you can enter this minigame as a fresh lvl 3.
---
* Negative XP lamps :(  Probably would have failed anyway but oh well.
---
Nerd
---
Engineer btw
---
He's gotta set a new bot farm after all his bh bots got banned from his last few videos. Hell be back soon.
---
Very pleasant.
---
They got turned to seeds. You can revert them for free.
---
PvP updates lul
---
the economy must be so fucked from all these bots, probably causing the rise in ironmen. 
---
As if after 5 years they still haven't addressed this, Players still doing a better job at catching these.
---
Not really spamming. If you click too fast it doesn't go back to magic menu.
---
Mega TL;DR version: expensive gear isn't worth it enough, pking (not necessarily pvping, but killing pvmers) is so rng-based and reliant on specs that all that matters is getting lucky on an ags spec and 20m risk only gives you a marginally better chance of that happening than 50k risk. so you have people going out in 50k risk complaining that they can't consistently hit on a bis defensive item. the people using dinh's are doing so because pvp in this game is such that there's no point fighting back as a pvmer, so all you do is wear the best 3 items you can to decrease your chance of being hit an 80 by an ags

Useful for 1 attack pures, both for training and for dps in fights. Making it 1 handed would allow use of god books for normal pures or obby shield for obby pures I guess. I don't think they use the rpg though so not sure on that.
---

---
No to negative XP lamps. I would vote Yes to a "XP lock" option that locks all XP gain (not stat specific) except for HP.
---
Everyone uses bp
---
If you enjoy it sure. These type of questions really annoy me. I know you're asking which one is more efficient and it's an innocent enough question, but it really bothers me how everything in gaming now a days is cut and dry what's BEST. I only wanna do the BEST. Personal preference and enjoyability are pushed to the wayside and everyone is basically playing the exact same game now because they're only interested in the most efficient way to finish the game. 
---
Sorry for the mini rant. To answer your question duradel is more efficient in terms of xp and supply gathering.
---
So many pures, pkers, and skillers have waited Over a year for the chance to vote on Minus XP lamps. Why not just poll it and let the community decide once and for all?
---
This could lead to pvpers targeting people that have their friend chat on. "oh I see 
---
'sharl00titbed' is in revs/lava dragons. Let's rag"
---
game integrity, probably. runescapes always been about gaining exp and adding a reward to remove it kinda changes what rs has always been about.
---
Legends cape is best fashionscape in the game. Prove me wrong
---
Just get gud lul
---
Can I participate in the minigame as a 3cb fresh account? Will I be able to hoard items on a 3cb ironman similar to how wintertodt is meta for newly created accounts?
---
Hey, good for them, man! They're out there creating content and having fun. These guys are gonna be getting a golden gnome in five or so years.
---
This was happening to me and I fixed it by unchecking the remember username and rechecking it before I logged in
---
For some reason I think sometimes when a box is auto checked it‚Äôs not registered as checked. This happens sometimes when I have to do authenticator
---
Trying, and failing, to demean my point doesn't mean you have a point to begin with, buckeroo
---
I've shown hundreds into thousands of people who advocate for recolored armor sets, and 4 separate, vast instances of recolored items in the game, with most preceding OSRS. Meanwhile, you have shown "Akchually, your point is meaningless because I said so"
---
ESH
---
I just responded to the other guy down below, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find an official source other than the wiki stating that higher Mining, Smithing and Runecrafting deciding what drops the players get. I suppose it could just be a rumor, but it seems like that‚Äôs been the general consensus from most players but again could definitely be wrong. So I guess for now you can take it with a grain of salt, but at the very least you‚Äôre probably correct that a higher mining is better because it nets you more tephra overall.

---
Ok... Aside from the fact that's a poor argument, it's irrelevant because the BH rework will remove emblems from wildy Slayer.  You're clearly just upset that there are exclusive rewards to this minigame.  
---
But, back to your fuss...
---
-Duel arena you don't get anything if you stake and lose.
---
-Tzaar fight pit only the winner gets rewards.
---
-Original LMS only 1 and 2 get rewards.
---
Then you got the other minigames...
---
Pest control you need to win and get nothing if you lose.
---
Barb assault you can't get anything if you lose...
---
What minigame are you even referencing that you still get a participation trophy?  Castle wars?  The minigame everyone hates because it's just afking?  
---
Stop being upset for the sake of being upset and use your critical thinking for a change.
---
Me too I‚Äôd like to know
---
rip
---
What are people bringing with them to wildy that makes them lose the spade? I just 4 item so I keep my spades, I refuse to give the pkers anything. I also make sure to turn on smite and attack them to spite them just a teeny bit more
---
RAT
---
Ftw
---
can't we start one?
---
It's very profitable for them to get the extra bond revenue. They could nuke out all the bots, and for what benefit? They'd lose a ton of money. They keep bots at a balance, not too much, not too few. It's a neccesary evil, and they're using it.

These rewards are EXTREMELY underwhelming. Lms was supposed to be an incentive to have players participate in PvP, yet there is not one PvP item that is rewarded. The three things that were tuned specifically for PvP have been botched and replaced with terrible substitutes. 
---
Please stop polling Only cosmetics from PvP, there needs to be rewards that cater to PvP as such, or else no one has any incentive at all to try the mini game. I really was looking forward to lms, but after the loot blog, I will not be participating if these rewards pass.
---
I‚Äôm down to

Farming runs, Clues, Questing, Birdhouse runs, Running bones.

There are PLENTY of places where it's useful. Just because people don't think it's "effecient", doesn't mean it isn't useful.
---
He's not saying he wants it for free, he's saying he wants a sense of progression even when he's starting out and losing most of the time. Ya know, like how video games work?
---
I think both sides have fair points here, but I think you're not giving him any credit. Part of what they're trying to do with LMS is make it appeal to both hardcore and casual PvP folks. So everyone should be able to get SOME rewards. Obviously the better you are, the quicker you should get the rewards, but a sense of progression is important to keeping people engaged.

Movement is technically never 1:1 if done via a key because if it were it‚Äôd be 1 pixel per click/push. That said, wmk is allowed and if your script mimicks wmk it *should* be fine but not a risk I‚Äôd take
---
oof :(
---
Apparently, it's the second rarest, behind the Phoenix. 
---
If you just do tree runs to 99, around 15%.
---
If you diversify your farming; herbs, trees, seaweed, etc, around 20%. The percentage goes up the more non-tree XP you farm. 
---
If you solely do herbs, around 33%.
---
Maybe it'll just be one or two worlds where competitive/high stakes exists? This is a good point though.
---
It has no stats though? So is it basically just faster punching?

congrats on another baby! My son is 5 months so he loves to look at my phone (when i am looking at it) but i am trying to reduce his screen time right now. I know over his life he will get lots of time with screens. Currently ranging kurasks as it is super afk
---
Do you have a license for that reasonable comment?
---
Someone posted a pic of a backpack with RuneScape inspired pins and such. Silly stuff, like 5 Fires and a Nat next to the word 'yourself' (Alch yourself), among other things I don't remember. Didn't read the comments tho, but I assume the keyboard warriors got their Salad Robes and Ancient Staves and took his Spade
---
Yep. You‚Äôre right.
---
Can we please get different versions of LMS that you can play? 1 defence, 45, and 70. Very similar to the tournament world's with the auto setup for each bracket. It would make LMS extremely popular as you can queue up for how you enjoy to PK.
---
already ran a program to see if anything was out of the ordinary but nothing was found..
---
The majority.  I despise questing with a passion. Over 2000 total on my main and no bgloves
---
Raids 1 can be soloed. It doesn't say you have to complete it within a certain time or no deaths, just that you have to complete it.
---
You can probably find someone somewhere where you can leech. You could also look for a streamer doing a raid mass and join that. Or you could learn it, its not too too bad to learn just for 1 kc :)
---
Definitely just rng lol
---
? I didn't claim they did and the point if they did spite vote they were doing everyone a favour anyway, hence fighting on our side
---
My worry is that everyone will use their points to buy either the parchment or the crates, whichever is more profitable. I suggest adding some kind of more expensive crate that has better loot that people can save their points up to buy. Something like you could buy 100 normal crates or for the same price 1 "mega" crate. The loot could be interesting, could make it have a chance at getting something really good like mils worth
---
Nice! I‚Äôd vouch for it!
---
Out of curiosity, how do you make these kinds of maps? Is it just very carefully use of paint?

Your butchering of that quote has left my disappointment immeasurable and my week ruined.

Literally came here to say this.

Best way to get the XP but also sets you up for down the road if you wanna upgrade your account.

So you're just gonna tell me I'm wrong with no evidence nicceee.  
---
Mazchna assigns weak ass bs tasks anyone with base 50 stats could stomp, Tureal barely gives points per task and is way out of the way, Mazchnas tasks largely being localized to the swamp.  
---
If you're at the point of boosting for points I'd assume your combat stats are at least base 70 and at that point you shouldn't have issues
---
It‚Äôs not it‚Äôs same gp/cp than oaks and more click intensive. It‚Äôs been a while since the price difference was huge.
---
The torso literally looks like shit. It looks like you have tumors on your stomach because they couldn't afford putting more than 2 polygons on the piece.
---
Sounds like a decent set of rewards. Though, I am disappointed the new Guthix Staff doesn't require the Void Knight Mace; that whole items' purpose is to autocast Claws, but adding a stronger item with the same effect will make it worthless.
---
Yeah, why not. 
---
Also buff the fishing spots in there so that they're equal or better than the fishing guild ones

That's what he said?
---
as a LMS or BH reward, add a consumable potion or food that when eaten removes a teleblock and would further protect the player from another cast for 10 more seconds.
---
They won‚Äôt even get into the game, pvp content doesn‚Äôt pass polls.
---
having literal gods block damage is lit. What you talking about?
---
Suggestion: Additional crate of rewards that can be bought for 100x the points of a normal crate that has super epic loot
---
They‚Äôve even resorted to special attack recolours.
---
herb runs work good to because they only take like 6 to 8 minutes
---
Tureal just assigns really really weak tasks for practically 0 points. Mazchna also gives very weak tasks if you're already at the point to use Konar, while still giving some decent points.  
---
Base 70s on Mazchna can wreck any: bats, bears, ghouls, crawling hand, etc tasks, all below level 50 combat monsters in easy to access areas
---
Thank you!

Flashbacks to RS3's world 84 CA. It would transform from an overwhelming mix of reddit and 4chan into a barely-speaking christian discord channel whenever a white crown showed up because they'd mute anyone they disagreed with if it was a nice one, or flat out anyone who would swear/make a slightly darker joke. Not when an actual jmod showed up though, those would often join in on the banter. Shows that something is wrong there.

After having a conversation with another person about your first point, I don't think it'll be an issue.  Being in the bottom few people seem like it's not likely if you put some effort in.  If everyone starts a fight, you just need to not be one of the first to die.  If you actually do happen to die that quick, then you just booted out quicker and can start a new match.  Seems like a solid solution to combat people trying to just die ASAP, get a point, repeat several times.
---
Negative Xp Lamps should be polled :(
---
I do that too when I only have my kids during the day. I run a small daycare and watch 2 extra kids on top of my 2 lol. Birdhouses give me 50 mins between each run.
---
True
---
Nice art but thats not from runescape.
---
Explorer's ring is good at nechs.
---
Ring of the gods too for the prayer bonus if you have it.
---
Ring of wealth, if you don't have neither of the above.
---
Suffering also gives some prayer bonus but the exp. Ring gives more utility and +1 prayer
---
Ouch. Hope you get it soon
---
Yes that‚Äôs the fellar. I didn‚Äôt watch him much myself, but I do remember a rant video complaining about people making fun of his hat.

True, but after making it onto phones it's probably not too much work porting to tablets. Certainly nothing like porting to switch.

Literally his most recent video is titled: "This is why I shouldn't PK on my Ironman"

Regardless if you care about clickbait or it bothers you, that's a clickbaiting title 100%

I‚Äôm ok with that
---
You know, turning the Rune Pouch into a PvP Untradeable would probably work pretty well and fix the issue with it being too costly to use in PvP.
---
Staminas only cost 45k/hour to use 100% of the time. They are borderline free lol. In virtually every money making method where they can be applied, they will be worthwhile.
---
I doubt I would use this, only because I personally don't like playing on anything other than desktop version anyway. I also don't have an android device, and I doubt this would be doable on iOS.
---
No idea if its allowed, but I don't know much about apps interacting with RSmobile, and how Jamflex feels about it.
---
Interesting to have independent control of your interactions with the environment and your inventory. How would you rotate the camera? Also maybe quick buttons to reset the position to under your character for the environment control, and maybe top left item for inventory one?
---
For duos mainly
---
Honestly imo since the whole point of lms is a training grounds and not a money maker have the crates drop an untradeable pking pot starter set. Most new players that are scared to get into pking usually A. Are worried about the learning curve (lms helps this) B. Dont want to lose alot of money on gear and supplies (crate set will help offset this cost)
---
Dont leave us hanging now
---
Saved you a nice trip to the arrow shop in varrock.
---
You mutilate that fuck boy Farmer Gricoller for his legs and torso as your reward for dealing with his shitty crops then steal his clothes for your own.
---
&gt; I still feel traumatized from the cosmetic overhaul of rs3 
---
do you think ur gonna be okay
---
I don't think barbarian assault is proper to compare though, since the attacker role's effectiveness is based on combat (and everyone has the potential to die, so 10hp/no armor can get punished by the queen).
---
New LMS would only need a dueling ring, and some LMS skill for a fresh account to farm it, so it's closer to wintertodt than BA
---
Definitely harder to get all the way to the ditch. I think its a decent change
---
New content and non balance changes still have to be polled.
---
The day the spell icon resizing failed is the day the pvpers made a no voter for life out of me.

So it's impossible if you try and do it in the forest like they did in South park. But using different types of board and boar boss mobs it can be done. I'd recommend watching the video he goes into more detail. :)
---
The incoming BH rework looks interesting and pvp looks interesting to get in to. But I'm not gonna worry about 2 memberships and I'll probably never make a sole pking account. So anyone who does pvp, what are some options for me?
---
Idk if you are familiar with jamflex as a company but their timelines are basically month:year ratio. Ex) this task should take 2 months. Reality: takes 2 years.
---
That's the best one
---
Oh, I thought I included enough of the docks, my bad!
---
Do NOT and I repeat DO NOT USE A JOYSTICK FOR A MOUSE. Most joy2key programs let you move the cursor with joysticks, which makes the cursor move at a constant rate at perfect directional angles. This instantly gets flagged by not detection, and you WILL get falsely banned for botting.
---
I‚Äôm hoping dis is the day.
---
I hope so
---

---
Nah man, you need some more arrows on that
---
Does that give better mage accuracy?
---
What bonus?
---
Sigh. As a mid level player hoping to get to endgame content and bosses soon, I hope the profitability of these rares don‚Äôt keep creasing like Onyx and most Zulrah loot.
---
Also can anyone tell me why Jagex can‚Äôt just ban these accounts to start with based off their very uneven stats and then do a case by case review for people who appeal (very few bad bans will be made given how regular Zulrah players are unlikely to have these stats)
---
I actually agree, I think people with specific builds as well have the right to have themselves considered in updates. I always hated it when people ask about being able to go back to MM to burst at 1 def and getting shouted at "YOU CHOSE TO BE A PURE".
---
Yeah absolutely that's true, but would it really be a problem? I don't pk much any more but I absolutely want PvP updates to allow that community to enjoy the game better. You'll get no spite voting out of me, I vote on things because I believe they help the game improve and have an enjoyable experience. If it doesn't impact me but other people enjoy the content? Have a Yes.
---
Yes, because most of us care so much about karma that we love wasting entire years hunting for a single pet. I'm personally at over 1K EHP (that's well over 3,000 real hours of gameplay) across all nine skills that give pets (over 99 in all of them) and don't have a single pet. People will say "that's just how statistics work!" and they'd be correct! But statistically, with our amount of active players, someone is bound to grind well over 2,000 EHP for a single pet at some point. For the vast majority of regular players, that's more than they'll reach in ***their entire lifetime***. 
---
So, if you want to gatekeep just because 'pets should be rare!' despite seeing a post on here almost every single day about someone getting a 1 KC/level 30ish pet, go ahead. But I can almost guarantee that you've never reached 3-4x+ the drop rate on an item that already normally takes hundreds of hours, because people who do that never have.
---
Set some goals! Like getting certain stats to 70 (super easy to get to 70) and getting some quest or diaries done! Feels super nice
---
Bookshelves can hold it or if you have the cons level (83 i think) you can get an adventure log which has it included.

You‚Äôre honestly fine to start pvp where you‚Äôre at now. 
---
You‚Äôll find people at your combat level but the next step would be to max your melee stats.
---
Sum of all bonuses really proves nothing. It's like saying ancestral is bad bc how little bonuses it gives
---
do you not understand the concept of risk v reward? or has safescape pvm numbed your brain that much that you've lost the ability to think?
---
Why are people so obsessed with Jagex not ‚Äúcatering‚Äù to pure accounts?
---
Jagex should definitely cater to all Types of accounts and add diversity. To think adding one update (negative  xp lamps) is catering the entire game to pures is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Jagex shouldn‚Äôt be shamed for trying to help out the PvP community a little bit. There are also plenty of players who have multiple accounts for PvMing and PvPing. Quit assuming Jagex is focused on one side of the community.
---
You and me both lol
---
If your not motivated to play now just wait til its like 1m+ xp between levels lol. But seriously the only way to keep going is to find things you enjoy doing and do that. Account progress will happen.
---
I thought mr Weath said that the Zulrah 'bots' were actually mostly gold farmers (not bots).
---
How much did that account cost you?
---
Yea I contradicted myself. I am just going to delete it. But explain to me how this says everything about me? I just said that due to a pelvic tilt, it pushes your glutes out, so this doesn't scream photoshopped... I just worded it poorly.
---
Nah I'm just being sarcastic, I have never tried pvp so yea
---
Hop to a pvp world and attack a player there
---
But what about Pieve?
---
It really wouldn't break any balance. It would create balance. I'm talking about deep wild nh bridding or multi pking. When you're nh bridding deep wild, most people don't even bother to pray mage - they just throw dhides on and camp pray range. And try maging when you're fighting another team deep wild (I'm not talking about the unorganized rev cave pkers). You get insta piled as soon as you pull out mage robes when you're in a multi fight with another team that knows what they're doing at annakarl/gdz.
---
This is how I used to draw my RuneScape character, a stick figure with rune armor colored over it lmao
---
I believe the new king of ardougne helps you
---
Or be a rank 10 Ironman and get banned for botting
---
So we‚Äôre now polling to revert unpolled changes?
---
Sounds like a lot of unnecessary work for such a small dev team.
---
Closer bank for anglers means support for me
---
Honestly, probably not. In my experience subpar gear doesn‚Äôt perform that much worse than bis. You could check the DPS calculator for the differences. Also at 60 you can use the obby shield and at 75 the DFS, both pretty good substitutes. 
---
Also take in consideration whether you‚Äôre going for combat 99s or not, as then the effort of getting the defender is relatively smaller. Also I guess you‚Äôre afking NMZ, I don‚Äôt really care whether I get 75k xp/h or 76k xp/h when AFK.
---
Will the xp rewards from LMS be available too f2p players aswell?
---
I quested so hard once I finished recipe for disaster and hit like 185 qp I was like I can‚Äôt quest anymore ü§£ but yeah I just find myself investing into super afk skills which makes me lose interest
---
822 marks of grace? Thx for the account, nerd!
---
I feel like it would make more sense to have the rune pouch come from a tribriding minigame, where players are actually using a rune pouch, as opposed to bh. 
---
Does the team have any data comparing the number of pkers actually using rune pouches in bh versus using them in standard worlds?
---
Gilded ancient staff when
---
Took me 3200. Best of luck!
---
probably max out range and melee stats (definitely strength), don't get any more prayer
---
Never said it was impressive. Most videos aren't but I don't think we should take credit away from him because it's not hard. :)
---
No, the Youtube suggestions were creepy, just like your obsession with how others view your sexual preferences is. Just let it go, man. It's absolutely not weird to think she's attractive, but making a big deal out of this and calling people weirdos is.
---
It really depends on the style of catering. 
---
With very limited builds, part of the challenge and part of the fun is not screwing them up. This applies for 1 defs, 10hps, skillers, and more. You make a choice to cut yourself off from content. Nothing changed that stops you from still accessing what you could access. Catering to these accounts by giving them minus xp lamps is bad for the game, since it undermines part of the accomplishment of getting the achievements that they did. It would also allow for things like quests to be completed and then the xp to be reverted, and any threshold is going to be arbitrary, leaving some just barely stranded on the other side.
---
Similarly, catering to ironman by dropping tons of supplies is bad design. All it does is make the game mode easier and easier.
---
However, there are plenty of ways to cater to account types without being problematic. For example, the gauntlet was a new piece of content with an inventory system specifically designed to help UIM. They weren't added in retroactively, nobody else was hurt, it just became feasible for them to participate. Similarly, the ironman corp cave split reduced the problems on that front. 
---
Some catering is good, while other forms are not.
---
I'm voting no to you!
---
And here I was all excited to see how my tired feet feel in these custom made climbing boots
---
Think you replied to the wrong comment bud
---
You should, with hostility, question your friends sexuality. That'll show them.
---
This pretty much shows why bolt rag wins in bridding unless ur in maxed mage. Magic armor should definitely be less defensive but youve got black d hide having defense bonus, attack bonus, and on top of that magic defense bonus which is even higher than magic gears offensive and defensive magic bonus.
---
Yeah trust me 99 cooking was the bane of my existence hahaha but for sure man. I just need to start grinding out money and get my high level gear like god tier armor and stuff. I‚Äôd like to boss with my friends but they‚Äôre all 110+ and I got catching up to do in comparison lol
---
Dude I was the same exact way lmao did a few quests here and there for some things I needed/ wanted.. and eventually I wanted to do them all! 3 left.. ds2, mm2 and sote.. but do slayer maybe? I find slayer to not be afk (I need to see the drops/ I don‚Äôt use pray pots)
---
Do you really think that after a few months break, the very first thing I wanted to do was ruin some random iron's day? Who even has that kind of time? Whatever I did that got this guy so pissed off, it wasn't intentional. However, I am definitely not apologizing to a psycho who blows up this quickly over an issue so minor.

---
It really isnt hard to do edge/bh/pvp world/honor pking. 
---
And you dont neccisarily need a perfect account. Though it helps.
---
There are only 3 things you need to know how to do.  
---
First and formost, combo eating. Which is literally as simple as eating a shark, potion, then karambwan.  Or just shark then Krambwan.
---
2nd when to tele.  Which is also super simple. If your getting out dps‚Äôd or your health drops too low while your opponent still has a spec to use, and you combo eating wouldnt bring you to acceptable hp. Tele.  If you have 99 hp, that barrier would be about 20hp. 
---
Finally understand stacking or ‚Äò1-tics‚Äô  which is simply using a fast range or mage attack, at distance, so that when your next attack(which will be at the attack speed of the weapon you were just using) hits, by switching to something that can do more damage like a rune 2h or godsword, the delay from the range hit ‚Äòstacks‚Äô or appears at the same time as the melee hit. This is potentially the hardest to learn, but still isnt tough because its simply clicking twice.  Adding a spec is as simple as using fkeys which a majority of the player base already uses.
---
The divide doesnt come from the fact you hemmorage money in pvp while learning. The divide comes from the fact weve had temporary death mechanics for pvm for 5 years now and its caused players to only feel that death should be a minor inconvenience.  You used to lose money in pvm or pvp when dying, remove it from pvm and its easy to see why players think there is a huge barrier of entry. In reality, thats what the entire game was meant to have, and you needed to balance the confidence you have in your own skills with the ammount of risk you were willing to incur.
---
?

Not necessarily, more so the players with 30m strength XP and 1100 total level.

You don't have to do everything maximum efficiency, take the game at your own pace :)

This seems like a very odd request? The details you are being asked for on their own may not necessarily lead to anything but be wary of sharing here... 
---
Why would jagex need this information? Is the person who stole your account paying for membership on it or something? 
---
If so the names and addresses attached to the bank information on it's own (that they can see) should be sufficient enough to show a suspicious change in 'ownership'
---
Yeah the pun was unintentional lol

---
Thats not even close to true
---
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Are you calling black dhide tank armor compared to armadyl? Because armadyl has higher defensive stats. Karils also has higher defensive stats than black dhide.
---
I get that black dhide is considered op, and that mage doesn't really have gear that fits the same role, but I really don't get what you're saying.
---
*spoiler alert*

---
If you zoom in you can tell. Totally fake
---
Right, but there is also the significant difference between a team game versus a solo one, and at the end of the day you're still being carried as the level 3 since you can't be an effective attacker
---
You specifically said she was 'hot'. Which is different than being pretty.

I legitimately don't find her to be hot. That's not to say that she's ugly, but she's just not hot IMO.

---
some of the skillers i talked to simply didnt want to grind an extra skill and alot of pvmers felt it was catering towards pvp with the gear and combo rune pouches. Atleast from the ones i talked to it was majority non pvp against warding. As pvpers were actually really on board because they saw how greatly the gear would benefit them.
---
It's not about how it looks but how much better it is when you take a pounding.
---
Im with Ash in creating a decent unique for it as i hate adding skilling resources to everything to make it better.
---
Doubtful. Making a bot farm for green dragons is easy. Much lower requirements, no questing, and simple script. For a decent zulrah script, which they're obviously using if they're not catching bans, is expensive.

I dont understand how 490k is possible

I have quite the opposite to your opinion, the only real content there is Crystal Tree's, Zalcano, Gauntlet and maybe the Agility course. Besides those the area feels kind of devoid of meaning, the untradables are cool but the area feels like it's crammed with useless filler.

Why would you be afraid of a pmod? They're unpaid losers

Speak for yourself.
---
People stay because they set themselves a goal, be it all quests done, all diaries done, all 99's, a couple of them, whatever you want; that's why people play this game, a "sense of accomplishment". You will never "finish" this game as you'll always have something to do, even if you're maxed out.
---
I can see that you haven‚Äôt player the game for awhile maybe you should take some time and catch up?

You can do holy grail, and do between a rock up to the point of the boss fight and not claim the reward to get the diaries done. Great job flexing on someone who has a 2k total zerk, by saying you have a high level zerk... I did holy grail, have 269 qp, and have done the diaries....

Classic pker doublethink

I agree. I just got back into the game like everyone else and one of the main things I wanted to do that I didn't do when I played back in the day was do a bit if pking in addition to completing all the quests I didnt before...

Seriously, I stopped here after the quest to check it out, a bank is the least it could use, beautiful area

You think someone is standing outside of a boss room, and changing the difficulty? How do you propose they are doing this?
---
I mean which boss can you only get 1 kill on? Zammy maybe? You can get 10 kills of every other gwd boss pretty easily solo from what I've seen with fairly basic gear and with top end gear I've seen KC of over 100 solo at stuff like zammy with a Tbow.
---
Mobile uses GPU rendering and is more efficient because of that. OSRS desktop uses CPU rendering and only a single core of the CPU so it has trash performance in comparison. GPU plugin on Runelite helps a bit but not as much as an official solution would.

why do you suck at your only job, jagex?

Actually I didn‚Äôt answer my own question because this was my question

&gt; Why are so many RuneScapers edgelords who think they need to prove that they‚Äôre not afraid

I didn‚Äôt agree with you that there‚Äôs no reason to be afraid, I disputed that there‚Äôs anyone you should be afraid of.

Yea the people who commented here dude are bots. They delete their accounts and downplay you because they think they can. Terrible trashy community man don‚Äôt give in to their bullshit. They‚Äôre selfish people living in a selfish world. It bothers me that these guys even commented cause they do it to strive people away from the truth. I‚Äôve made accounts on here and this community alone logged 25-30 people to make my like go into the negatives.
---
Oh right that was a thing
---
I don't know about a podcast but a video series would be really cool.
---
Yes I purchased my account with inetions of finishing it off to max. Literally every skill is more than halfway so the account is basically almost done.
---
It's the opposite. Tons of people spreading misinformation about it being bannable or sketchy with 0 background of proof of their claim other than they want to scare people away. Being cautious is one thing, but lots are blatantly lieing about this and that's why the people using it just fine are getting upset

There‚Äôs a difference between telling somebody that their setup can be improved and immediately jumping to insult somebody. Guess which of the two happens much more often.
---
Honestly most pures I know hate the idea of negative xp lamps. Part of the appeal of the accounts is the difficulty of maintaining that 1 def or whatever it is. Same with ironmen, most of my ironmen friends absolutely hated the farming contracts when they first came out even though it mainly benefited them because they thought they were too powerful and didn't like how it made farming easy for ironmen.

Ah yes because software is perfect and unhackable, specially on Android (since you only get 3 years of security updates if you're lucky)

Everytime reddit goes out of its way to try and influence the polls, it literally ends up doing the opposite.

I don't mind PvPers, but PKers are obnoxious.  I haven't had a chance to look at the blog, but if it encourages more symmetrical PvP as opposed to jumping people who are in Wildy for other reasons(PKing), I'll probably vote in favor of it.

What are some profitable skill training to do in f2p? So far I've mined like 70k of iron ore, and then when I reached lvl 35 cooking, been making pizzas and then anchovy pizzas. Been doing batches of 140 pizzas then 280 pizzas then 560 pizzas and then 560 anchovy pizzas and kept doubling and now I've been making 2240 anchovy pizzas for the past 5 days, now I almost have 2 million GE value in the bank and lvl 75 cooking, and I've cooked around 6000 pizzas overall. Getting tired of cooking pizzas and making anchovy pizzas. Looking to do something else, any suggestions is appreciated? So far  based on looking at the wiki, crafting gold jewelry and then selling seems some what profitable? I'm also been thinking of leveling my lvl 1 magic to 55 for high alch and then hunt stuff to high alch? I'm not sure if that's a good idea, not familiar with loot drops and areas I can go to, any tips and link to resources to help me figure it out is appreciated.
---
jagex is such a disgrace, you are literally putting them to shame
---
they literally have no control over botting or gold farmers, what a joke
---
OK this made me laugh
---

---
Jagex is offering minus xplamps because they dont want to probidea service to reset them themselves. There is no challenge in avoiding glitches. Also more people quitting is less money for jagex and less friends for us.
---
Thanks a bunch, I tried figuring it out through the wiki but couldnt find a clear explanation for some reason &lt;3

But this is the osrs sub...

He also believed she could be helped and returned to the light. If you want something bad enough you will always find a rational path to make it righteous.  He just wanted seren back :(

I'll take things that were staged for 500$, Alex.
---
I like the idea of both
---
Thanks! Next step is to buy a bond and check the game out further with plans to move to P2P.
---
Oh, yea, that makes sense. I was kinda basing it off levels, not really PVM.
---
I don't have an issue with negative xp lamps, but I am of the opinion that if you support those you must also be against reverting death mechanics (which will probably never happen anyway), and for the same reason. Decreases the impact of making a mistake.
---
I forget what happened but when they came out they settled to a price of around that 700k, but then like a year later they suddenly were worth like 10M.
---
Vote no on pvp because warding didnt pass! 4Head

Hahaha I thought the same exact thing

Remove it, or have it where you have to complete all other reqs in diary to unlock the zulrah boss. Keeps elite void behind zulrah, but keeps zulrah behind the rest of the diary

Deep wildy targets have always just been trying to lure their targets into multi or hope that they arent prepared to fight in deep wild.

---
Tbh purple sweets are less than half the challenge I'd say, at best a quarter or a 3rd of the challenge.
---
Maiden's not a big deal, getting skilled enough to solo it isn't too hard, but it's mostly RNG, being more skilled just means you can beat Maiden even with worse RNG.
---
Bloat is even easier than team bloat since no one team mates to worry about and you can manipulate it into walking below 40%, it's just longer so more chances to mess up.
---
Nylo is the first real challenge, you need to memorize every aggressive spawn, as well as some strategies you employ at certain waves that make a big difference, in particular when all the big aggressive ones spawn at once that strategy people use there to deal with them makes a huge difference. You're basically expecting to lose between 2-3 pillars, if you only lose 2 then you did amazing, but during the pillars falling you have to blood barrage heal while running around hoping not to get combo'd out by pillar stun damage / exploding crabs / 10-20 crabs chasing you around room. Then for the boss it's a matter of not using up a ton of supplies, xzact has a method where you can be self-sustaining that requires being tick-perfect with timing your hits and walk unders so you hit them on the very last tick before they change colour.
---
Sotetseg is easy, personally I beat him first try, anyone who's really good at ToB I wouldn't be surprised if they said they first tried Sotetseg. So his tick eating segment isn't even a challenging part of it.
---
Xarpus is the 2nd hardest boss, and has no tick eating, and is the real barrier to entry. Anyone who did solo ToB before the Xarpus change has a huge advantage, because back then Xarpus was practically a free boss compared to how it is now, so getting to Verzik to practice Verzik is very hard now. His acid and walk under damage does like 50% or something like that more than it used to, and he has more hp after the exhumed phase, so you take more damage and have to deal more damage during phase 2. AColdOne is a god at doing it and can sometimes do it with so few prayer potions, I did many xarpus attempts and even with like 7 prayer potions and some restores saw myself failing often, only managed to beat it once after like 10 Xarpus attempts before I took a break from soloing to do other stuff. I should mention I was consistently beating Nylo at this point, Xarpus is just that hard, your sense of timing and movement needs to be insanely precise and consistent, every mistake is very costly, and if RNG is bad you can have potentially 0 room for error.
---
Then there's verzik, which is the real tick-eating challenge. But it's not just tick-eating, you have to manage your position because that'll affect how long the ball takes to hit you, and you have to either detonate the crabs or freeze them, freezing has RNG and can miss, detonating them means death if you're even 1 tile or tick off in your movement, and verzik can shoot a lightning ball at you while you're doing all that which you will have to tick eat, so you need to make sure you are in a position where you can tick eat it when it comes while performing all the other actions you're doing. Then there's Verzik P3 which you basically need to perform flawlessly unless you have a real excess of supplies from good xarpus RNG or you bring the locator device thing to tick eat the green bomb verzik does by activating redemption from hurting yourself.

Jeez man, let the guy make a living. No need to dox him on reddit. :/
---
Yes but consider this, making an Ironman pking account is much harder for less reward as you cant get anything on the account from PVP and you have to foot the bill for all of the food and potions you bring since you cant make it back from PVP itself so instead of worrying about XP you are worrying about GP. It's hardly a solution to the problem, Ironman PVP accounts exist because of the current problem and shouldn't really be needed. So yes it would devalue something that shouldn't exist in the first place as they are a result of players trying to make the best out of a bad situation.
---
After you out level enemies enough they stop giving xp.
---
higher stats will get you more damage which gets you more personal points, but won't really matter in team raids. You probably want 78 herblore to help make potions unless ppl you go with are using alts to prep but thats probably not likely

I spent a week reporting every single bot at blast mine on every world, some of them with 100m+ mining exp.
---
A decent number of them are still operating.
---
Blast mine is pretty high intensity compared to other moneymakers someone could be doing on an alt, so anyone doing it on a non-main account is likely botting.
---
Obligated? Since when did this game become a job? I like blast furnace so I do blast furnace, I like slayer so I train slayer, I don‚Äôt like RC but I don‚Äôt complain that the elite diaries are inaccessible to me.

Warding is not just sit at bank. You can run to monoliths to train and magical sleuthing üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è would have been competitive as well.

I'm sure they can, but again asking for it doesn't bother me. I don't have a strong opinion on people being restricted to train at MM1 tunnels just because they're pures, it just seems whenever it used to be suggested people would flame immediately.

If you're under 115 combat you'll get less points in a solo. They are harder than team raids, so prob learn team raids first

You're selfish for ruining the game for your own benefit, get a real job

I'm sorry you're so butthurt that your favorite vidya isnt going to get the update you want. Maybe mommy will make some tendies for you.

This is exactly why I stopped doing Corp as a lower level. Dudes like this would have scouts to see when I was finished speccing and would come in to steal the kill. Apparently there‚Äôs a whole cc dedicated to doing this. Really scummy

Is the exploit different than the joycon hardware exploit?

I've never been disconnected in OSRS, the efficient way to kill has made me far more than 400k or whatever.

Is it active or is it rare for people to actually pay that much?

dawg what kid sees dmm or pking and says "yea I wanna go play that fuck fortnite"

Never trust it. If it's earned by means outside of the game then is against game rules and can get your account banned. Best way to progress is just play the game
---
The sarcasm in the title would be my guess

EVERYONE SAYS THAT NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHY.

I found that doing quests without a guide and trying to solve things myself made them much more enjoyable. When you sit there and follow guides for hours on end it juat starts to feel like a chore.

Dinh's is still a strong as fuck tank shield for raw physical defense; removing its magic def bonus now forces people to choose between physical def or mage def or forces them to bring appropriate switches instead of having one item that does it all.

I would personally love them and I don‚Äôt even have a pure.
---
Yeah dont bother trying to argue on this subreddit that not specifically excluding pures isnt the same as making content easier to cater for them.
---
People just want to restrict content out of spite and actively want to get the devs to lock existing content pures use behind defense reqs.
---
See the NMZ/Imbues discussion where people try to push for it to be moved to lunar island and when others point out that this would restrict pures massively they respond with "hurr durr you restricted yourself".
---
Aaaah i see, that sucks! Making money in game is alot harder than it used to be for me haha

Make sure your gear is sorted out before including all pots and required items. Suffering/serp helm make zulrah easy to learn. Follow rotations:change prayers first. Learn KO potential phases vs. dps phases. Dont eat if u can dps and not low health

You don't get banned, they just force a name change on you. After several times you get a 1 year JaGeX generated name. My friend's had like 5 year long generated names so far on 1 account.

you believe this? Even though everyone knows pking is dying/has been dead? 
---
I don't like reddit cliches but damn your name really does check out
---
I think all it needs is some larger docks reaching out to the sea like a big harbor, even if there‚Äôs no content on them it would be good scenery to have lots of ships out there. Just like the one you already have there but like a few more. I love this btw. Pisc. is the most in need of a revamp in my opinion
---
Any particular reason for 96 attack? I guess im at the point where combat level doesnt matter too much
---
Be a 99 def pure. 1atk, 1 str. 99 Prayer. 99 range. 1 magic.
---
Can you be hacked from opening a trade in game with someone? Mobile or computer version? 
---
Just open the trade then they decline it with nothing been offered,
---
For bones to peaches I would say around 300 laws, 1k nature's, and 200-400 cosmics depending on what level enchant you are using. It's not very expensive at all.
---
Ugh, I'm at 765 and 19/24. Need DH Axe, V Skirt, Torag Helm, Guthan Helm/Skirt. I've went 122 dry previously, currently 48 dry.
---
I have misworded it i think, people are spamming but i assume it links to an outside site?
---
I have one, I use it for my max prayer gear when I want to save on ppots.  Works pretty decent.  Not as fast as a whip so I‚Äôm probably not saving too much on ppots in the long run but eh whatever
---
Best advice for money making is to start farming until you can farm ranarrs. This let's you have some steady cash flow while you can do early account stuff like questing
---
they is your arguments
---
Meanwhile I'm at 2005 kc no pet or claw lol
---
Probably not, u a lil snitch bitch dude
---
Hate to be that guy, but making the new buildings look HD while the rest of RS is still in early RS2 graphics era is just so damn wonky to me.
---
I agree! I will do some edits to this map!
---
The ghost of Swampletics
---
Nice work, the areas especially the left coast look really natural
---
Never done farming i will look into it thanks
---
Yes, this is the solution! Ty man
---
Buy some bonds from the osrs website and sell them in game. They are over 4m each.
---
I worked hard for my torso
---
Are they not all just overlays....?
---
I'd pay 12$ a month for a monthly BTS of what happens behind the updates.
---
Check our /r/mousereview for detailed instructions of what mouse will fit your hand.
---
For sure lol I only started doing quests when I got to the high level ones like recipe for disaster and I think pyramid of whatever haha. But you‚Äôre not wrong
---
Damn, thats a good idea haha
---
Tomorrow open world beta will be released so you can try out zulrah :)
---
Thank you! I was going for that!
---
That's literally what it is, lol. That's not a real creature.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
Looks million times better than full graceful thpugh
---
You‚Äôre the one whining on internet because you get offended over text.
---
Elite Void Range, can be used for any activity that requires range. Not always better than dhide/arma though.
---
Melee,  can be used for any activity that requires melee. Definitely not better than bandos, Varies in some cases with Corp.
---
Mage, Good for high alch. 
---
Yea, it's good for learning zulrah, since you could bring more food, and less switches.
---
only angry people use sarcasm? nobody makes jokes using sarcasm?
---
This is an attempt of humour

Should have used the Gilded spade for it.

What if you play runescape and have crippling depression?
---
ok im guessing you don't know what a trigger is then. i wish laypeople would stop misusing psychiatric terms
---
Yes, I did read your post, and I understand what your saying. And my response is the same. Just keep your filter on...
---
&gt;	because id like to be able to see normal inoffensive swear words without having to see 16 year old whiteboy basement dwellers use the n word
---
I‚Äôm offended by your use of basement dwellers because I take that as a slur. Better blur that out even with profanity filter off.
---
*Yoink* -&gt; *Toss* -&gt; *reeeeeee* -&gt; *Boom*
---
You‚Äôre deep down the self righteous rabbit hole, I‚Äôm out. ‚úåÔ∏è
---
This is the ultimate version of ankle weight training.
---
The wilderness podcast should get Ash on once and see how it goes.
---
id be more than happy to never use the phrase basement dweller again as a trade off to not have to see the n word on this game again =)
---
&gt;it would be dumb for pvpers to vote no
---
&gt;dumb
---
&gt;pvpers
---
Well there's your answer.
---
Dont like what i like so i write a stupid answer
---
nice
---
The gameplay in the background is not from his stream.
---
you would be against a filter option that filters slurs while allowing inoffensive swears?
---
Yea
---
and the owners of the game have given us the right to communicate with others as we see fit.  YOU want it to change, not the creators.  You trying to get things changed is indeed an infringement on my ability to communicate with another person.  If you dont like it go to your safe space and cry about it, preferably in a location that others wont have to hear the sobbing.
---
More like- more xp= more xp
---
They've been polled before
---
The notoriety!
---
we are talking about people to PK for 1000s of spades per day. They arent the smartest brainlets in the class.
---
can we get another one but without the leaves and roots. thanks 
---
sincerely -everyone
---
Downvote this please.
---
Let this guy keep his name , stop fkn snitching.
---
Agreed, did pking back in the 05 days and now I get crushed. I don‚Äôt have the time like I used too to learn the OSRS pk meta so I just run doing wildy slayer/PvM or accept death when faced against a skilled pker. 
---
I will be voting to help the pking community because I remember the fond days of pking north of the Varrock church.
---
I'm too paranoid to use their wifi. Unlimited 4g or bust.
---
the only person who seems to be crying here is you at the thought of not being able to be racist LOL
---
Make this man a Jmod!
---
bye!
---
The infamous t bow rebuild! If I was you id get one for sure. Even when I dont use mine I‚Äôm happy it sitting in the bank; best wep in game
---
This is the best meme I've seen in ages
---
Small dick gang
---
It's sounding like you can't have your cake and eat it, too. End of topic. Time to move along.
---
So I can lock my hp xp &amp; train range to 99? Making the proded accounts easyer &amp; alot cheaper to make. Cannonballs will be devalued.
---
at least you're honest.
---
Zerk
---
I'm guessing it would only give membership to the account linked to the email address on your Google play account. I'd recommend going on their website and going that way as they'd have two separate log ins and not at that point associated with a method
---
Yep! They likely check a bunch of stuff like play patterns/hours, ip and device fingerprints. The exact process they determine someone was highjacked is, understandably, secret, though. Wait a little more and hopefully you'll get a positive result.
---
No problem, good luck!
---
Ok ok I'm sorry. I'm just salty because now that I'm finally getting good at zulrah, the price of her scales have dropped down about 20 gp. It isnt much but I think it adds up over several kills. They'll probably go up soon enough
---
thank you for ending the topic. people have been trying to end topics of anti-racism and anti-homophobia for a while. unsure how that's been working out though!
---
Think what you wanna think, again, people who like pking are not doing it to spite you. All you're doing is marginalizing all pker's as the neckbeard nerd who does it to feel better some how some way, I don't get what runs through your mind. Like I said before when someone enjoys something (you know actually enjoying the game) why bitch at their opinion? cause you can't take a wildy death????
---
No, the toggle would only be for PVP - and it would be for all combat exp.
---
I'm sure plenty of players use alts and do things like this.  I grinded out 99 range on Kurasks on an alt for fun while doing stuff on my main.
---
Lmao what a unit, look at that fire-whip go.
---
hitting 99 xp drops per obstacle
---
Not a very good one.
---
Tbf, Save the World is still a thing. Less of a thing, but still a thing
---
I believe if you examine big bones it says something along the lines of "This could feed a dog for months"
---
I mean you have a berserker helmet and dramen staff. Cant say you don't quest AT ALL
---
No it's not, MMK is a god-tier osu! player. You would know that if you actually paid attention to his streams.
---
imagine how strong he actually is without wearing his weight training outfit
---
I'm aware.
---
I would rather have new gear than make everything a SotD add on. I don't think the spell effects need to change, but other than that I'm behind it.
---
Mom! Bathroom! BATHROOM!!
---
So can't get def xp from players buy still could accidentally hit a skelly? &amp; how about long range can I use it to forecast others without getting the def xp?
---
Damn an old naga molten, I still have mine lol
---
Glad you appreciate it I'm sure it'll get decimated by angsty pkers.
---
The cost is in the scales
---
I like it, but it's hardly a port. Look at a water map of Ft. Lauderdale, you'll see what a port city looks like.
---
Blowpipe doesn't work. Magic shortbow works pretty well
---
Y'all remember when it was 5?
---
Yeah some of the CCs are incredibly wack. I‚Äôd offer to help but I won‚Äôt be on any time soon.
---
Good point but there's no single other 2 handed "defensive" gear though
---
Vorkath was harder than Galvek for me. Watch some guides on YouTube to learn about its mechanics, like how to dodge the attacks and the use of the crumble undead spell. Minimize the damage taken and you should be fine
---
I like how every way leads to the pub. :D

---
Just delete your Facebook. Big xp waste.

This makes me want to see a city like Riften in OSRS. Where the city has completely built up around a river/bay and almost entirely enclosed it.
---
A good friend of mine and I created a YouTube channel displaying CoD4 glitches and continued it for 3 years all the way til MW2. 
---
Unfortunately all of the videos are deleted now I wish I could go back and review them because man the nostalgia I get from those glitches has me smiling ear to ear. 
---
I sometimes load up CoD4 on PC just to glitch in private lobbies. 
---
Him and I were the ones who discovered how to get on top of the MG house and construction building in backlot!
---
Oh ok.  It sounds like I'm midgame then....
---
try making it less obvious next time lmfao
---
No, I wan't death mechanics to make sense if they were to be updated. I don't want to risk thousands of hours of progress, just like a normal account wouldnt wanna risk hundreds of hours of progress. Ironman mode is only relevant because items kept on death is based on player run markets which we don't participate in. Also I'm pretty sure death mechanics isn't "every piece of content".
---
Yeah, it just makes it cooler and it's not gonna bring about any balance changes anyways.
---
It certainly is.
---
Nice.
---
It's the accepted meta because it's cheesy and makes the fight easy
---
How is rune pouch obnoxiously more difficult for Ironman? Mains and ironmen should start with wildly slayer anyways for the points, only difference Is ironmen will use their emblems for pouch and not gold.
---
OP thought he had a Chad.
---
so if for example: i say, and i cant stress this enough that this is not my real life political veiws and this is hypothetical...\*JUST AN EXAMPLE\*
---
\*
---
\*"fuck those dick munching wetbacks, i hope they eat shit and die. all hail supreme over lord Trump"\*  
---
what parts of this phrase would be censored in your mind?
---
should be 30min, like in other instanced areas
---
I would love to be able to gain supplies for pking from training pking in LMS, this makes totally sense. All other items gainable should be related or it's rather bullocks
---
Do you people literally just watch porn while playing? Who does that?
---
Was referring to OP not yourself, but if you honestly think you‚Äôre a member of some sort of ‚Äòskilled elite‚Äô then your life is laughable
---
Another sjw sigh what is this world coming to.
---
Cool
---
Could you define what you mean by slur?
---
Now that's customer service. Please tell me you took a free sandwich.
---
So you mean the best low level money maker, not necessarily the best overall
---
Tbh i think expensive recolors have their place. I just dont like the ones they suggested. Why not robin hood set recolors? Why not black trimmed dragon armor and weapons? Why not more whip and dark bow colors? Why not some redesign upgrades like malediction and odium?
---
They're doing plenty of work, my friend "LGBTQA is Gay" got force-changed lmao
---
yes, pking is pretty much dead but doesn't change the fact that the only reason pking was so popular and bridding being the biggest form of pking is purely because of the mechanics
---
2 tick teams in Priffdinas, that way you earn shards as well
---
Compared to the alternative of having the content fitted into RC/crafting, it's a new skill that serves more to be a level lock rather than focusing on the content itself.
---
What would be more exciting - releasing 6-8 new sets of magic robes and having the community explore their uses and effects, or releasing 6-8 new sets of magic robes, having the community grind for 40+ hours, performing actions that are extremely similar/the same to skills they've already trained before, before they can obtain those robes?
---
In theme, making magic equipment fits into rc/crafting/firemaking/other existing skills. In practice, gating things behind levels without offering something compellingly different to existing skills is a huge excitement killer.
---
And in regards to simple vs complex, warding failed the poll by the greatest margin compared to two more complex skills. In reality, whoever argued xyz missed that the simplicity of warding didn't do anything to help it pass. 
---
And before you try to misinterpret my argument, these arguments only work for warding because it's unnecessary and uninteresting. If the core gameplay of a new skill introduced a new method of training that was engaging and uncomparable to any already existing skill (such as hunter or dungeoneering), then adding leveling can be justified because leveling itself is interesting and different to what's currently in the game.
---
Ok but no one requires you to get that cape. All content in the game, outside of the wild, is completable without it. You are not required to enter the wilderness.
---
Thing is, what do reasonable pkers do to clean up their own community?
---
Plenty of people quit but don‚Äôt unsubscribe
---
That's awesome. COD4/MW2 back in the day was the shit. Peak childhood nostalgia right there.
---
Oh right
---
Unfortunately I didn't. she popped up right as I clicked to go on the obstacle and when I got off she had followed me on there and I couldn't get back to talk to her because she was back on the obstacle.
---
so what the other guy said was untrue? thanks!
---
This is not true. Mod Ash confirmed on twitter, gathering skills boosted over 99 have no effect with the exception of when you have an invisible boost (like in the wc guild)
---
Don't give people advice when you dont know what you're talking about
---
Thank you, good to know.
---
Stonks confirmed
---
Nah Rendi can't afford a lambo
---
nmz: exists
---
literal main accounts still using rock crabs: im gonna pretend i didn‚Äôt see that
---
Might be. Not sure about how many lives.
---
But higher farm lvl gives you a higher chance to not use a life
---
grats dude!
---
Doesn‚Äôt work, but thanks for the idea. I did some digging and found an old post (not sure how to link it) and apparently the symbol goes away when the previous name is taken by another account, so if the previous name is something obscure then the symbol may not go away for a very long time, if ever
---
Constitution.... This isn't rs3. And you have the shopping habits of a rs3 player. What caused you to switch? Not trying to be a dick.
---
wouldn't surprise me if there were a jmod getting kickbacks
---
How is posting this on Reddit snitching? 
---
Is reporting him snitching too?
---
I think you're thinking of strongman, which is also what the reporter was thinking of but instead wrote powerlifting.
---
honestly just make the 10 hours of ash softly breathing vid already that's what everyone wants.
---
Just curious, why not make a main and tackle the collection log if you want to do more than farm gp but don't want to do the "cancer" iron grinds.
---
Same prick did that to me the other night
---
Touchscreen  for now I'm trying to find away to modify it  to use joycons I'll post a video if I do get it working

Just playing mobile

I swear this ass gets bigger everytime.

You‚Äôre selfish if you think you deserve every cosmetic in the game and vote no simply because these cosmetics require you to do something that tons of people enjoy, but you don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre just lazy.
---
Isn't it that in glarials tomb you can't use prayer not that they hit through it ?? Or Am I wrong here?
---
Everyone is allowed to say the n-word. Jagex will mute you for it though without even reading into the context, instead of just filtering the word.
---
I cannot ctrl + z my eyes can I?
---
And using 200 bucks on bonds? Damn, Jagex likes you. Anyway, good luck with obor, you will tear thru him
---
I budget the money I spend but yes I do spend a lot more then most
---
Unless he's consistently hopping to your world and following you around, that's not harassment.
---
Me and my buddy ran into this asshole a few weeks ago, after he stole the kill (he had the advantage starting before us) he traded me the trash drop and apologized... The fucker was not sorry and wouldnt have traded me a good drop.
---
Bruh, your auto is showing
---
Yes but let's wait till my iron pure finishes zulrah so I can have the items to raid
---
I see you've broadened your scope of players. Oahu here as well.
---
people hop checking all worlds with scouts etc
---
collection log is artificial and doesn't equate to account progress in any way.
---
besides, sunk costs.
---
You don‚Äôt need friends to do Barbarian Assault I did mine on two accounts with complete randos
---
Your parents may for memb? Mine stopped when I turned 25
---
I 100% relate. I was a teenager that was super into jailbreaking and modifying stuff too. I used to mess around with older iPhones and PSPs a lot. 
---
I never got 100% away from the techy stuff though, I'm going to school for computer science now, but that's how it all got started.
---
Why are you getting offended by what people say in a medieval clicking simulator?
---
Why no tent whip though? Just looking at your gear, seems like you could afford it
---
Depends on what you want to do. For slayer a torture is best. You can get ferocious gloves as well if you're not using silver bracelets. I would also use Proselyte top and veracs skirt with piety on if you're tanking with food instead of protect from melee depending on the task. Make sure you have a bursting set for dust devils and soon nechs as well (vestment robes, ancient staff, bonecrusher, god book). For ranged Blowpipe, blessed boots, blessed coif, and anguish but you're not using ranged often for slayer if you're focusing on xp.
---
Who cares lmao the player base is basically all 20+
---
&gt;Only shit at work bro ~~scape efficiency~~ you don‚Äôt make enough to justify shitting at home
---
Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime. That‚Äôs why I poop on company time
---
Don't approve of you saying that everyone can say that word.
---
Too be honest it took me 6 months too decide if I wanted too spent the 200 on bonds too get the dragon claws or not.....it nots something I just did on a wim that's for sure....but I definitely like them lol
---
Pmods cant really do anything that's true. Doesnt mean hes not trying to be overly edgy

Tool at 102, shard at around 160 and 340

Its  sorta like a dual boot of the os on the actual  switch hard drive I have the  Nintendo  os in on the sd card I run the android os I dont see a way to brick the actual  console  its self as all the flashing is on the sd card side in loading is done on the sd card side but I also dont know if there a chance to brick I have yet to run into an issue after doing the flash more then 12 times to try in get joy cons to work with osrs
---
They are mostly used for pvp so you can sell them for some gear upgrades later on
---
shut up pussy
---
Tried it last night for the first time. It seems super OP. That thing just shits out loot while requiring very little investment and being very easy to kill.
---
Very smexy.
---
The void mace looks like shit compared to the others, what part of void is guthix anyways?
---
Sounds annoying, can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever come across it myself
---
Its uses that method  to push it into rcm to load a cfw
---
Hell yeah my post üòÇ
---
Pking is dead because of people crying about losing spades on reddit. Mechanically, pking is the most dynamic and intense content in the game if you're fighting someone good. 
---
But people would rather spend their time learning how to pray flick the newest boss, or finding the best cannon spot, and then wonder when they die to the first person that attacks them at black chins.
---
My bad brother all love to you for trying to show it  first
---
wtf! I literally went to go check it out.... You're completely right. I went from worlds 516 to 525 and every world had 2 bots both 99 fish and fm with all over 20m+ exp... and same stats...
---
And the main exceptions are other pkers and bosses
---
You won‚Äôt make money with that attitude. You must spend to gain
---
Wheres the source of the cat
---
Nobody tell him
---
Pkers fighting other pkers would make for better streaming content than pkers hunting for spades.
---
This is adorable
---
Don‚Äôt go there then. The wildy is also pretty much completely dead, seeing another player while doing a clue is rare, let alone a PKer. Your exaggeration is pathetic.
---
I though 25 buttholes was the OG little timmy who due to his goblin boi antics killed himself. The true 25 buttholes descended into his body to proclaim the savage prophecy. And now he is the sole ruler of the wilderness due to his savage methods. Wow

I love Prif, but you only make that much per tree if you have 97 herblore lol... as someone with 70 herblore idk how to effectively convert my shards into cash
---
Hot and spicy meme here, come get it while the dank is fresh.
---
Yep, didn't do anything
---
Too cute
---
Could I ask your method? I tried soloing yesterday for the first time and got like 5 kills. I used the method of clicking meleer and then kree right after to keep melee attack frequency down. I still just feel like I get the shit beat out of me. Is blood barrage worth bringing?
---
I don't get it are those legit RuneScape tubers
---
Hahahahahahhahahahha
---
The three items I am missing are: ranger boots, crier hat, and a white elegant skirt
---
Well it's a suggestion. I know that it would affect very little in the grand scheme of the game, but it might keep the ~pigeons~ looting noobs away from the ge

Had a guy get 99 at Wintertodt earlier, obviously people were doing the whole Gzzz and @@@@@@@, pmod then threatens to mute anyone spamming. :)

Real question or troll can‚Äôt tell?  
---
Escaping pvpers is INSANELY easy in wildy as long as the level difference isn‚Äôt too big.
---
Go into your mobile settings, click on the joy stick and look at your Player Attack Options. Chances are, you have them on hidden.
---
I like Serp and Torags legs. I don‚Äôt skull so I don‚Äôt worry about losing anything. I usually bring a chaps in the invent for switches if I gap them. Always run for the trees.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not alone
---
Pvpers voted yes
---
Google cb Calc and find out yourself
---
What kinda of jobs do you people have where you can play rs all day?
---
Google an OSRS combat level calculator
---
Sounds like you need to change your settings. Open your settings (the wrench) then click on controls (the gamepad). You should see an option to change player attack options. You can change that to 'Left click when available' to be able to attack people.
---
Fair warning, this is dangerous because you can be skulled easily and lose all your stuff. I recommend setting it to 'always right-click' so that you can still attack but you can't accidentally attack someone.
