Do you not have access to a computer? And if not how are you planning to do any of this? I am mainly confused how you can't open your email from a computer
---
[removed]
---
Hmm, still think a quest would be better then having a conversation
---
Imagine making them instead of buying them.
---

---
Imagine being so poor that you'd save a few gp and go through your house instead of just clicking through your inventory.
---
The tbow doesnt even really affect time, bp is way more dps than tbow and tbow is only good for jad and mages and even in my experience ive done better dps with bp on the mages (tbow definitely best for jad though)
---
Second and third tiles in the first column are incorrect
---
Dude dont fuck with me I'm do high for that lol I almost did it until I remembered what it did haha
---
Do you even pk??????
---
They added Skilling catalysts to rs3 and it went over really badly from what Ive heard.
---
Probably wanna look for a jailbreaking subreddit not the osrs sub for this my dude.
---
Shit imma have to re do it all but thanks yo
---
Browny1990 is the real virgin, confirmed.
---
Underground pass along with legends quest cave feel very unchanged and still look very similar to the RSC equivalent area.
---
The max cash on every pvp kill would be absolutely the worst one had it not been rolled back. The economy for the entire game would be 100% fucked for everyone rather than just a few people dieing in Falador on one world.
---
Download runelite

Also got 2 solo olmlets every solo raid drop minus tbow, over 5k zulrah kc

I'm flexing hard

Cant get it to download on linux

since being an ironman was my hobby before I did cosplay he's in favor because at least this one gets me out of the basement

just take full set for switch.

Why are you on Linux? Genuine question

What can I do to Ash with level 99 fapping?
---
It IS impressive
---
You'd actually cause some prices to tank briefly as you dump this haha

Does anyone remember the YouTube video if the falador massacre recreated in Halo 3? It was just a dumb funny video but I've been trying to find it again for years and never have been able to, I assume it's been taken down but even in archives and stuff I can't find it anywhere :(
---
Hence the "if you dont have better gear" part. :)
---
Is a hasta better than a tent whip at bandos? Also when killing zammy, is it better to bgs spec or archlight spec?
---
Not knowing sarcastic response template in 2019 lol
---
I agree with this. Only had 100m when I bought for 70m bank is now over 200m. The gp will come back
---
Cons: Would make group point boosting wildly fast
---
 I met with the president of the Virgin Islands
---
oh true. But torso is free and obby/dragon legs are cheaper than guthans and will do better. my bad though, read your comment too quickly
---
Ur so adorable
---
Is it? I genuinely just gyazo’d this while at the g.e could you please show me the original post?
---
Chefs get money youtubers get peanuts
---
Damn dude change all your info and set up 2fa on email and osrs and start to rebuild. At least you'll get your stats up more. But that sucks
---
No worries man:p.
---
You missed a shot to get Kurt Angle in this post!
---
This is an awful idea. Takes next to no effort to either report/block them or just filter your game chat
---
If he's going in balls deep and putting in as much dps as he can that's even more hardcore than if a 126 were to do the same, although I suppose a lvl 87 account is a lower risk than a 126 account.
---
C
---
Omg I think I met him around those days at PC. Coppied that look for a while!
---
they mentioned this and said they don't like having many eternal stuff
---
Wish I could get access to a TBow :( would love to take a crack at the inferno
---
New cave system. The under-underground pass
---
I dont think they say this to flex, its more of a this took this long to do hence why this content took this long to come out and if this video is inflated with likes it may be worth investing more time into similar content.
---
Ugh there goes the ring of 3rd ages main purpose... (Not the glitch, just being able to hide in PVP like you can do with the Ring of Stone at Rune rocks).
---
The only message in chat is an advertisement for a gold selling site? Lol blatant advertisement on a reddit post.
---
Top tier meme, have my ash vote
---
is it more or less likely to be hacked if you use your username as login? and with a previous name change?
---
Yeah sorry that's what I meant, I was 73 agility at like 81 fishing as well and getting 99 fishing got me 45k from 80 agil
---
but they increased the magic defence stat to compensate.
---
Had it put on a computer just cuz even tho I dont use the computer but now that I'm playing rs again well the computer is there either the linux or my phone
---
He's looking pretty tight to me. Licks lips.
---
99/92
---
&gt;I mean, before runelite I would write down in a notepad file when my farm run would be done.
---
This does not tell you the exact tick it is done, unlike the runelite plugin. This also does not account for if you do your farm run mid farming tick, the runelite client does. 
---
&gt;Timers can be done outside of the client.
---
And will never be 100% accurate, and are a hassle to use
---
right now your stats aren't really high enough for any good methods
---
I'd say don't worry about making money and train your skills instead, particularly farming and slayer
---
once you can grow ranarrs set a goal of unlocking the additional herb patches and do farm runs as much as possible, compared to how long it takes and the requirements needed farming herbs is one of the most effective money makers in the game
---
also I'd set a goal of completing the varrock hard diary so you can collect battlestaves every day, that adds up over time
---
also do the miscellania/etceteria quests
---
Best melee gear is through questing, I use prayer boosting gear 80% of the time with Slayer and it's pretty cheap. 
---
Dragon scimmy / defender 
---
Helm of Nes / Slayer helm
---
Prossy chest/legs or fighter torso/dragon legs
---
Ardy cape until fire cape or obby cape
---
Fury/glory
---
Berserker ring(i)
---
Dragon boots
---
Barrows gloves/rune gloves etc
---
I've made probably 50 accounts on runescape and never knew about this, damn.
---
55 to 70 was about 2m for me. I did earth battlestaves until 63, green d'hide bodies  to 66, and air battlestaves until 70. Did it all today actually and it was was under 4 gp/xp
---
I got mine on 200 kc
---
Can I do Carrick diaries as f2p???
---
i personally think jagex should take more control over whats exceptable on 3rd party clients. mainly on pvp ofcourse imo the ice barrage timer and the whole pvp bot should have been removed instantly. (cant jagex sue 3rd aprty clients at any point if they dont remove a certain piece of content?)
---
In all honesty, Stamina pots make Graceful useless.
---
no
---
typically most cost efficient to use ultracompost &amp; not pay
---
my 6 months of experience copy pasting code on a private server says you're wrong
---
Hey Johno, I ended up using your place for some tele’s earlier, keep it up man you help the community out loads
---
looks like i wont be able 2 use the lvl 20 training methode. unlucky!
---
Do air battlestaffs it cost me about 2 mill but it’s worth it
---

Reminds me of those fishing spots that would appear in stardew valley.

im maxed on stackoverflow

The best of A Friend cc Anyssa the man
---
nah you weren't hacked, your stuff just vaporized 4head
---
People are greedy, that's life. The only thing other hosts can do is drown him out, nothing much else can be done. Sitting there for 12+ hours a day mindlessly lighting burners for a 10m tip jar is pretty pathetic as it is. You could raid with a team for more gp in less time and actually have fun doing it.
---
Level 40 finishing content requiring level 61 combat lul
---
get 43 prayer, do underground pass, and do barrows
---
Holy shit was this copypasta? It’s so good.
---
Okay but yes
---
Yea but could you imagine if one of them died once? the owner would get epically destroyed and lose like 30 lobsters. He's gonna be furious when he checks his bot in 8 hours and sees he has 2770 lobsters instead of 2800.
---
REEEEEEEPOST
---
Underground pass? Ok. I'll look into that thanks man
---
That's fair
---
the maze wasnt that hard at all, just bring staminas
---
You know, I'm not gay, but I would totally eat J1mmy's ass. I just feel like, he deserves it. He puts so much hard work into his content, maybe someone should occasionally take a trip down to his Rimmington Portal, emphasis on the "rim" if you get what I mean, you know, I'm just saying.
---
Again, I don't like dudes, penises are way too masculine for me, but I'm just saying that if I had to do it, I would maybe probably totally do it without hesitation
---
Im just glad they removed that stupid maze by the stairs.
---
It’s the best way for basically anything you use mage, such as barrows, zulrah, raids etc
---
Granite hammer for str training. Gmaul for specs. Everything else is basically the same
---
This is the kind of content we need more of
---
Got rid of RC. I see what you did.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOST
---
Yes. I'm sure they considered that when they put the hp requirement on suffering.
---
Navigating through Meieyerditch with no guide was fun for me, like a parkour puzzle game or something
---
Don’t they just get money funneled to them from their main so they can pk?
---
I always think this sounds like a cool skill until I imagine how it would be implemented.
---
Have y'all ever done any quests with boats in them? The boat part is always the worst part. And I can't imagine them making a skill out of that.
---
Dungeoneering was way before EoC, Divination was after EoC release. Summoning was okay but tedious and made soloing a lot of shit a joke, which currently is already a joke to solo.
---
Everything needs touching up but they wanna poll it in a month, the devs aren't smart they fuck up consistently, fuck content creators a lot of them are just as braindead as most of the community, limited release worlds only work if they do it before they poll it and they take actual feedback from players and act on it.
---
Alrighty anymore misinformation and far reaching arguments?
---
Higher range would be ideal, but 81 is perfectly fine. That said, is consider a bgs essential rather than just ideal, at that level. I've been doing vork at 81 range (hit 82 tonight tho) and it just wouldn't be worth the time without my bgs.
---
what boots does he wear?
---
F lmaoo
---
Leaf bladed sword if you have the slayer level. (55)
---
I mean, you already do have the butler to fetch things from the bank and I think they can unnote stuff too. The issue with building a direct bank is they probably couldn't limit it to owner only and there would be nothing to stop you from putting it say right next to a Gilded Altar... With a high req and high cost, it may not be the most broken thing, but with how much utility POHs already offer and how strong the Con Cape is, I don't think POHs need a bank.
---
that was a few years ago, more recently he's stated that making videos and interacting with the community has helped him to become a bit more able to function normally and he said he hopes to play other game/go to school/whatever and isn't planning to continue with his plan to max his alt
---
More useful than warding tbh
---
thankfully not.
---
not all of them, well i dont have a main
---
The filter is new as of like a week ago.

This is the only thing thats really of interest. There are other rooms upstairs that have statues but nothing as interesting as this.

Its fun to go back and explore around tho

Yoooo this is Shmed! One love brother thanks!
---
I'm sorry that you are this way.
---
no ring not bugged, i got all drops in 160 kc
---
&gt;Clearly, like i've said, you've skipped all the bullet-ed points, which only two specifically mentions Alarms situation. The target time for responses, how to even reach jagex, how to tie tickets together, the lack of response by the in game report system, picture support in a ticket, the toxicty and massive scheme an individual is exploiting, the clan chat security features regarding kicking players, and bank pin issues.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I'm done responding to you and have blocked you, each post clearly shows you've both missed the point, and stopped exactly where I said you did. Everything you've posted has been useless, but thanks for the comment count and your unintended support.
---
Or play the game and stop asking for the game to be made easier? This post is XP waste, you're xp waste, go train Runecrafting.
---
Oddly enough I just saw a PMod standing around the GE just watching a dice bot and he told us that "he can't comment" on why he doesn't just mute them and hop.
---
For pking? Training?
---
Well a lot of people are spamming with 6 alts and the hosting clans want you to be all up there arse and if your not then they just treat you bad, you can private message me in game: Johno R :)
---
already got it tf you talking about, its just hard to believe it took you 50 attempts in a time span  of 1.5 years

In discord once someone posted a screenshot and their chat box showed the path, like c/user/john/folder, typical directory. And I told them "Nice path in the chat box, gg account" and the poor lad deleted the screenshot and got freaked. I felt bad but it was also funny as hell
---
Yeah bro no worries. Do you have discord?
---
These bots are rigged. I have yet to see somebody win
---
Can we please stop with this horrible format?
---
Do wildy slayer. You can start it from level 1 and emblems are decent profit for being low level slayer. Do the Natural History Quiz at the Varrock museum (google it). You’ll get 9 slayer and 9 hunter in 5 minutes. That 9 slayer also lets you bypass having to get a task from Turael and you can start right away with Krystilia, the wildy slayer master located in Edgeville. 
---
If you have 75+ range, blowpipe everything if you can afford to. The emblems will really help to cover blowpipe costs. Otherwise any wildy tasks can be killed via melee/mage/range. Combat style really only matters versus wildy boss tasks. 
---
Non-wildy slayer is profitable around level 70 slayer. Wildy slayer is profitable/break even at level 1 slayer. 
---
PM me your rsn. I’m making a new account right now and planning on going heavy slayer to start.
---
Oh yeah! I know Mike. Good fuckin guy 👌
---
Well I think combat bracelet is better than moth gloves, climbing boots, Fire cape (unless infernal ofcourse) zammy book, tent whip, torture, I guess whatever top you want like iron plate or some shit, then dhide legs are generally the pure setup.
---
I have a 60 attack pure and the gear is mainly the same minus the weapon and depending on your hp lvl the bis stuff is zenny jewelry
---
\#JusticeForJimmy
---
\&gt;Gets hacked due to his own fault and expects anything to be done about it.
---
The fact that I can be in he for an hour and nothing is done feels like even too much. They could literally hire someone for cheap to go through and their sole job is to jump from world to world and give a mute, then check the activity on the account, then decided if a ban is worth issuing or if it’s a new account then perm ban
---
Censoring the feathers means he's botting right?
---
Mate, dont feel like a fool. I was about to fall on that too, that scam is pretty genius actually, they even copied the legit forum page. Sadly you cant get your stuff back but i assume you are new in game dont actually feel sad if you loose 5-10millons, that amount could look like everything for a new player but with experience you can grind in no time, dont loose your enthusiasm you still have your account.
---
I’ll be there
---
I don't click any links or watch any streamers so guess it's the second thing. Also only play on mobile so no computer. Don't share any passwords either so guess I should be fine. Just frustrating
---
&gt;The point isnt about the person who bought the account....I hope you understand
---
You're literally the one who keeps bringing up 2FA in this comments section, implying that you think the system should have prevented your friend from getting his bought account recovered back.
---
Literally just make this the same option as white graceful. 100% in all houses and you get a choice of black or white. Tired of waiting because “it wouldn’t really fit in with lore” if we add it to x place
---
I don't generally support account buyers/sellers but i'll respond to this post. You've provided enough evidence about this individual for recovering Alarms. I think that's clear, but how do you know that the account Alarms was sold in the first place? Where is that evidence? Some people would think that Alarms was hacked by your friend, and then the original owner recovered it. Maybe that was the case?
---
Based on your screenshots you're going up against Spammed and Harenking, these are dangerous people who dox people, rags people etc. They are online harassers and they should be watched by jagex i totally agree. 
---
If your friend "real" Alarms didn't buy the account from a random person then none of this would of happened. I think that clears all of your points. Jagex made it clear that buying or selling accounts is forbidden, because they know stuff like this would happen.
---
don't tell me about it
---
Good call. I will use trident!
---
Could have 9k fire runes, or 9999 fire runes, the world may never know.
---
... wait a second.
---
what if Jagex just entered into the game themselves? So you got gambling bots in the GE where their rates are shady, what if Jagex just made their own 'lottery' NPC? That way you have assurances from Jagex that the rates are what they are and the money just goes away when the player loses vs paying out when the player wins.
---
Basically, Jagex should just offer a better product than the Bots can provide by making a lottery NPC with even odds so that in order for a bot to compete they would have to surrender the "House Edge"
---
I hate these fucking RNG 73728 names in EVERY world spamming
---
You: "Account buying is bad and I'm not supporting it"
---
Also you: "2FA should allow account buyers to keep their bought account"
---
Can't really use a whip as you'll level attack
---
Jagex won't respond
---
&gt;The problem is this troll who has abused the system. He sold an account, will have received money for it and then has deceivingly gone against that sale to steal the account back.
---
Which isn't Jagex's fault in any way.
---
Idk i think it would be kinda cool to see different teams lock down different areas every season
---
Warding bad!
---
Nah cause you can still recover an account without the 2fa if you have the necessary information. All it prevents is someone pretending to be someone else.
---
Not saying they should keep their acc. You can still do recovery.....
---
Oh yeah, you beat me to the punch there.
---
leeching for supplies only need the first two rooms, he wouldn't be looting chests if he was leeching
---
No because with 2fa working properly. You can still recover your account because you have enough information to recover it. The proper 2fa would prevent other people from being scammed by the account seller pretending to be the person you know
---

LOLOL I'm just picturing a guy sitting down at his computer, opening up his bot program, looking in his bank, seeing 2770 lobsters and then screaming at the top of his lungs then smashing his computer. Thanks for that
---
that was me :) had to make the tars
---
He still needs to pay 200k to upgrade the staff tho
---
Seriously, how does he bend his elbows like that?
---
Honestly dude, this doesn't require much critical thinking. If somebody can spend USD to gain levels, it *devalues* the maxed accounts who got it legitimately. I'm not going to explain to you the definition of 'value', you should be able to find out yourself.
---
Take care. :)

Great explanation thank you very much sir

If you're doing teaks then the astrals alone already make it more expensive than the butler method.

350 + 104 + 104 = 558

The nats make the situation even worse. At least you get some magic xp, but it's a pretty expensive way to train.

Welcome to the better game. Go make an Ironman and get barrows gloves, you’ll thank me later.
---
Whether or not people have referred to it as rs3.5 is not what I meant. I meant that EoC is what ruined the game for many people, and when those people talk about rs3 they're usually talking about the eoc system in general. So the change from rs2 with the eoc combat to rs3 itself didn't change the way those people thought about the game. All my opinion of course and the original comment of mine was more of a showerthought than anything else.
---
I’m having trouble getting my fire cape. I can get to Jad and have the pray flicks down and even getting aggro from the healers - but they absolutely wreck me.

Right now I’m using full Void, with 81 range, 77 HP, and 70 def. should I switch to a tablet set up? Will that help me tank the hits from the healers?

I mean this is different from other bots, they are literally just standing there spamming and actually pointing themselves out, they're easily detectable.

I don’t really want to level fletching. It seems kinda pointless. I’ll look into it for sure though.
---
Nice
---
Getting construction up wouldn't be a bad idea. I think you can get to 83, or close to it, with 15m.
---
I wouldn't mind it being a tool-belt, but my original idea did not include it being able to hold tools.
---
Shut up obby Mauler
---
This was a very distasteful joke.
---
It's not just a tank alternative to rigour, its bis tank.  And you use mage pray mostly at zulrah and raids
---
Sara Sword is an amazing weapon.
---
Nah, I have a better idea. Make it maxing and 200M all skills, on top of inferno and complete collection log. An even better idea would be to set real-life goals on top of this. Setting goals in a game is fine, everyone needs a hobby, but if you have the volition to keep yourself from hurting yourself until you reach a certain goal in a video game, then for sure you should be able to do the same towards real-life goals, and by the time you reached those real-life goals, you're even less likely to want to hurt yourself anymore.

value of 3rd age-  54,691,957  
---
value of msb - 829
---
value of rune dagger -4510 
---
 total value - whatever the scroll thing is that i have no idea and - nature runes =  54697296  
---
54706060 - 54697296 = 8764, so there is 8764 gp worth of nats, assuming the scroll is worth 0. 8764 / 224 (value of each nature) = 39.125. there are about 39 nature runes in this reward casket, someone please hack this man already.

can't wait for my boat to either get attacked by a dragon or to have to chart out the fucking sea for 10 minutes.

Also, why do you think you can just remove billions of GP from the game?
---
Ye Void is definitely what's causing those problems for you. Most people find it easier with Blessed Dhide Top + Barrows Gloves + Veracs Helm + Verac's Skirt/Blessed D'hide Legs instead.

I agree that wiki quick guides are faster for mundane/simple quests, but video guides are quicker for the harder quest like mm2 and ds2

At peak efficiency there is no longest run. You have been doing it all wrong. ^(/s)
---
I mean sure but the game has great gold sinks. Whether it needs more currently, I'm not sure.
---
It needs item sinks more than anything though.
---
Unfortunately the members skills are level 1 so that adds to your total. You will gave to get yuur total level about 500 for every member skill. Same thing happened to me.
---
Someone ranked in his cc 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
If you want his bank pin too, checkout his crystal seed charges
---
Thanks
---
Just guaranteed on 50 KC
---
I also have a ton piled up so its not really rare either
---
Its saying you need 500 total in non member skills. You have a total level of 506. Since there is more than 6 member skills. Your total level from your non member skills is below 500
---
I saw a video where all the bots had only the amount of cosmics to do one runs worth but the non bots could be decent loot

That's me lol

Haha I get it, weed
---
Yes those could have possibly done it, or he was dumb enough to use the same account info. 
---
He’d need to uninstall them and use some malware and anti virus programs to make sure there’s no virus or malware.
---
Wasn't aware of that, thanks for the info :]
---

Even after I got 99 agility I still needed like 10 staminas to get through the pass without constantly walking through the traps

If nothing else I'm a master of that dungeon now

What's your ironman's name? Are you hardcore? You seem intent on making it known, so I want to know.
---
Indeed, once you get in a groove it isn't that bad. I ended up doing 3.9 mil mil exp in one day before finishing up the last mil exp to 99 earlier today.
---
Lol not really, I just saw something similar to this on W420 last night
---
wow ur so edgy
---
Well iv never even heard of that lol... I appreciate it!
---
You spent all this time typing out this garbage and for what? Make you feel good about yourself?
---
Imagine still forcibly using this stupid ass imagine format long after it died out. WeirdChamp

Whoa whoa whoa.  African American Graceful, please.
---
Bruh these comments are shit. Buy full rune, glory, brine sabre, and an obby cape to get 60 atk and str at rock crabs. Quest monkey madness and get a d scim. Start training to 60 def or 65/65 atk and str to do warriors guild for a defender. You can start doing slayer and training range thru slayer after this point
---
&gt;how are they quicker
---
Because I can read ahead and skip around a lot easier than in a video

How do you get a blowpipe pet?

I earned my beautiful black and white graceful back when it was first added in with Zeah. I remember being one of the first people to have it and every world people would follow me gawking. Even today there don't seem to be a ton of people with it. I can never leave my Graceful behind. It's my default outfit for everything &lt;3

Did void knight top use to be sleeveless?

Meet Tutorialetics, my Tutorial Island-locked Ultimate Ironman.  After recently maxing out my Ultimate Ironman, I decided to up the ante; to forge my own journey from scratch.  No banking, no trading; only this time, I can't exceed Level 3 in any skill.
---
So gearboxjoe, do you work for Gearbox? Can you give us any juicy Borderlands 3 info?  😎
---
I’d just buy bis gear and wouldn’t spend that on any sort of skill unless you need pray. Use it to lvl up combat and buy pots or food and supplies you’d need along the way.
---
I’d buy a fury, obsidian cape until you can get a Fire cape. Then just bis armor for all 3 combat styles.
---
I’d buy a berserker ring, seers ring, archers ring may be a bit too expensive.
---
Mainly use it to lvl up combats and get gear because the higher lvl you are the easier it becomes to make money. I suggest starting the long slayer grind as it gets real profitable late game and it’s usually easy to afk or do in between other end game content
---
I didn't really expect people to care about his cc name. I just thought it was neat to see the dude actually talking.
---
I think you could catch back up with another double xp weekend

2100 total with quest and diary cape and I had soulless casual sex today. Fight me.

This game is way to slow to play drunk... from a pvm perspective

I would literally train runecrafting to get the black graceful recolour.

I see it is a standing desk, but it's definitely not at a good height for that dude

For your first point is it single or double click?

I actually like the Cape colors, but the icon sucks. You just suggested another mining cape 👀

Guildwars 2 booth at chinajoy.

This is a social experiment. The results may be shocking!

Sold a white one for around 80k just a few days ago. And a blue one yesterday insta sold for 26k

+1
---
Yew is a little slower but like three times the profit
---
Are there other eye wear in the game? Maybe each color could do with one of the others. Just a thought.
---
Wyrm bones on the chaos altar is a cheaper option and not much slower, plus if you do get pked 80% of the time they don't even pick up the bones
---
thanks bud

in the future you can always call out in "ironman cc", they love dem imps

Where did you go Serene

Good advice. I’m very nervous about that quest still
---
Lol where is this from?
---
because you're lying and people like you try this dumb shit literally every day.
---
And rapier, for the 1%
---
Start learning vork mechanics now. The mechanics are easy once you know how to work them, then DPS becomes the issue, which is where I'm stuck at right now

Why have you forsaken us

Respectable sacrifice. The only thing I dont get is theres a 389k cushion between him and rank 1 and a 350k gap between him and rank 3. Hes in no man's land.   If only a poo separated him and rank 1 then I could understand it better.
---
Virtoso: Jagex's watch? More like Tayroc!
---
You're right, I have no idea what my brain did there
---
Parrot that sits on your shoulder I believe
---
It doesn’t. The dps bonus from slayer helm far outweighs prayer bonus of other items though.
---
That is a fair argument. I wouldn't be opposed to the idea to tie bues with both warding and magix. Runecrafting seems a bit weird for imbueing rings. Makes more sense if you have to imbue elemental armour.
---
We are god among men.
---
Allegedly
---
I respect your opinion. But some people might prefer another way other than running runes all the time.
---
That was before I had a slayer helm, so I haven’t had the problem since, but man was it annoying.
---
The best part of the grand exchange is looking at the chat for a split second and seeing some shit like "the only pussy you've ever been in is your mother's"
---
I think currently this problem has a reward problem, adding new rewards even cosmetic can be hard to pass.
---
Most new content can pass but not its reward, so I rather see new content be created for this reward instead of just adding it to existing content.
---
so dont fucking do it? who forces you to?
---
Ireland, circa 1845, colourised
---
Recently finished me2 and mm2 and I can say with confidence that the light puzzle is the biggest pain out of all the quests in the game
---
only advice i can give, assuming you are using the most optimal gear possible you can afford, try not to eat outside of acid walking or when you get frozen you have time to each once, cast crumble undead, and eat again before attacking vork. minimizing downtime attacking is crucial.
---
Really? You pretty much just wait til the monkeys turn around and then run to the next hole in the boxes. There are way harder puzzles in the game. The goutroot puzzle is the most comparable and has way more enemies patrolling the room. Or mournings end 2 puzzle.
---
Fire cape, black mask and d boots, also would use d defender
---
Please stop recolouring the same time over and over again. How many different colours does it have at this point?

I've heard clans mass report people that host, either force name change or mute or ban or some shit.

You just took away all the prayer bonus lol

Good luck! How did it go?

I was about to give you a warning, bit I'd rather wish you luck.
---
Holy shit lmfao I didn't expect to laugh so hard at this one.

I probably just suck but that platform really did ruin me
---
Fire cape has prayer, black mask will give you such a dps boost you will want prayer points, same with defender and d boots.
---

This is gold and the comments

LOL.

&gt;I was on the twitch stream and followed the link for double XP because I am an idiot, didnt look at the URL and how it wasnt actully the website and **entered my bank pin yada yada**,
---
You entered much more than your bank pin, LOL. 
---
&gt;is there a way for jagex to roll back my account? 
---
Yes, there is a way, will they for your specific circumstance? Absolutely not. 
---
Your upset about losing like 25m-35m in gear, people have lost a lot more than you man, lol.
---
Wow! Reading comprehension is sooo difficult, isn't it? I'll try again:
---
I don't need to have a story that will convince fuckwits like you, because the ban will be lifted if Jagex can be fucked investigating the account. 
---
THAT is the purpose of this whole post I made here. To hear from either a Mod, or other players who have had similar experiences and can help. You're focusing overly hard on the drug bit
---
Blow some fucjing unpowered orbs while you're at work on mobile. That's how I got 55-75 crafting
---
Fashionscape is life.
---
what method would that be..?
---
4 ring charges. kiss your account goodbye
---
Jagex already did look into this. The account was returned to the original owner.
---
Does range really need a buff in the current META though?  Like it’s already best DPS basically everywhere and has a very flushed out progression that gives good xp rates.  Mith Knives, MSB, Rune Cbow, Blowpipe, Chins, Rigour, Anguish, Void, Pegs, and tons of other useful weapons in endgame like DHCB and Tbow.  If anything prif should be expanding med to high level melee gaps or the vast black hole that is making mage more relevant in PVM.  IMO Crystal Bow had its uses in the past but this game has grown since then and maybe it’s better to just leave it as it is and focus on having more Crystal Weaponry in general instead of just upgrading a weapon that really doesn’t need it.
---
or a mechanic similar to kalphite king. for example, 1 player must pray the correct thing or it’s a 1 shot.... or must wear x amout of def bonus or it 1 shots the player or a random team mate. make it so you cant tick eat it.

Nobody mentally okay should ever shit themselves for any video game. This is literally just for bragging rights, and there’s absolutely nothing to brag about if you nonchalantly shit your pants to achieve it.

This is a mental disorder.
---
strong agree. its not in the spirit of hcim mode. should not be allowed. look at all the downvotes as if spamming food and brews the entire raid is an achievement.
---
We must defeat the quest with the quickness
---
Because there's a huge influx of new players that can get the requirements to vote very very easily. More and more people that don't know what effect something can have on the game.

hes getting hard carried. it would not be possible with 5 accounts at 85 cb

hes deff getting hard carried

Guild wars  1 best team based PvP to ever exist.... way before it’s time... that 2 on her waist... want to throw up..
---
Why are you putting a question marks as if that's common knowledge.
---
if you think this guys an idiot, you should know that someone tweeted at ash to ban him for this
---
Off the top of my head, it's best in slot at Vorkath and NMZ ranged training. Some people recommend it for learning raids because you have less switches.
---
Cause it looks bad
---
That was me - Hash Juan
---
Ur right

[Amazing if you actually draw this out, just how hard 99 is to get.](https://i.imgur.com/1uKMhvk.png)

You still need one?

I suggested this as an optional rule for my 6v6 pvp minigame idea ;p
---
That’s actually so hype
---
The picture its self is all the flare needed reddit, lol new to the reddit scene
---
Yep.
---
I'd definately get ranged up to atleast 70, but 75 ranged would help a ton cause you would be able to use a blowpipe.
---
As for difficulty it's not too difficult however the jad fight is rather unforgiving and a small slip up could cost you the kill. If you keep your cool it's rather doable though. Most people take like 2-8 attempts for their first cape
---
Set in game goals and reach them at your own pace, also play in moderation even if the game can get super addicting! Have fun!
---
imo you should get 75 for blowpipe
---
IGN: A Ladybug   I’ll be getting the armour now

&gt; ...I realize I was lied to about the OSRS playerbase. I have yet to meet a single player who is 'cancerous'. During the years spent on RS3, however, I can name quite a few situations where I met unpleasant players.
---
I've played both games as of recently and generally feel the opposite. No community is perfect of course, but I actually went to RS3 initially because of OSRS's community... not being something I want to be associated with.
---
But if you're having fun, that's all that matters.
---
If I got 1pray xp for every time this got reposted I'd have 99 pray by now.
---
worth it
---
You should mite the people who did that

if its regarding warding update. its warranted. A big update like this could easily turn osrs into rs3 shitshow.

But our desire for dungeoneering is not satire.
---
Nah, waste of time and gives pmods a worse image then they have. Literally trying to do a nice thing, which people say dicing bots are annoying, and I get basically cornered for by everyone. It doesn't make sense haha.
---
Alarms was never sold it was hacked then recovered. Thank you all for your support but Alarms is back to its owner.
---
Do pmods hit the world hop limit?
---
Bot an account, gain levels, make a reddit post in an attempt to save it when it eventually gets a ban.
---
&gt;If you're not involved with that content, why not just skip? 
---
His entire first post was about exactly this. You clearly just saw a lot of words and noped out of reading it all.
---
This happened once when free trade was removed and the only way to give something from one account to another was to kill them in the bounty hunter crater. Clans were fighting non stop over control of the crater as they would be able to control alot of the trade in the game (the crater was limited to one world).
---
And yet they did the exact same thing to the Khazard general fight in the Grand Tree quest.
---
I mean if that's all you did how did people know you were muting them? It was probably more like bragging (like you're doing with this topic) and being a bitch to everyone who said something to you.
---
I assume to grab a book and have a place to relax and read.
---
I was going to say unlike western gaming expos every Chinajoy booth features scantily clad models wearing ads. But we're guilty of it too, just to a lesser degree.

If you google search chinajoy images you can barely tell it's about gaming

How is it so easy to DDOS? Why doesn't this always happen during pvp if you claim it is easy as that?

So wait, what is the general consensus of this sub? Do we like warding now?

You've either never raided before or never dung'd before.

Some random female Twitch streamer probably, he used to constantly enter and view such streams. Especially Alisha, understandably so.
---
You need 7 quest points or 24 hrs played to sell some stuff like Cowhides. Best way I know to get that is cook's assistant, sheep sheerer, and romeo and juliet. Goblin Diplomacy is quicker than Romeo and Juliet but might be a longer walk and requires more items. Both give 5qp. Not sure how it balances out.
---
When you get some money (Cowhides and stronghold of Security are easy early money) go to Draynor and buy a Chronicle and Teleport Pages from Diango. They'll give you a teleport to the Champions Guild right outside Varrock.
---
Apparently it lasts a lil longer than the timer suggests. So they do have a bit more than 20 seconds.

he’s pking in the screenshot

and also they’re not = pking, some people like to play with 1 def
---
Their small taste of membership is moss and hill giant boss.
---
&gt;not to trade the dicing bots, which is against the rules
---
As far as RS goes, trading was never against the rules you dumbo. And no you pretty much have no say in what people can/can't do unless it's broken rules or something. And even then only thing you can do is whine or mute. Also I'm not sure why they give pmod to lil pps like you are that use that power just to be an abusive cunt.
---
Go ahead and mute the bots idc but there's literally no need to interact with anyone while doing it or to make a reddit topic about it because it just shows that you wanna powertrip and be a dumb bitch about it
---
Also, the total xp could be used to find the username. So there’s another thing ‘leaked’ (it only matters if you post other information about your account but still)
---
You should see a chiropractor. Find one that is into mystical-magical shit and thinks he's a doctor, he will probably be able to fix this
---
A cannon shoots in 8 directions tho...

The best thing about the dragon war hammer is that you could realistically NEVER get it.  1/5000 is rare enough that you could kill 500 a day for the next year and still be dry.  I got mine at 10k and it was the most massive relief I’ve ever had.  Cum sprayed out of my cock with the force of a million suns.  The thrust from my cum sent me flying through the walls of my home and through the atmosphere.  I traveled the galaxy at the speed of light seeing things no man will ever see.  With the new found intelligence and wisdom i decided to go back home and redirected my cum rocket to propel me to the place where it all started.  As I descended back to earth cum showered my family as they awaited my arrival.  Everyone clapped, Obama was there.
---
all i do in this game is pk. id vote yes on a new skill if it was good. warding just isnt it though.
---
yo momma so old, shes the 5th elder god buried under zeah.
---
rc has the lowest xp cap, how is that a waste
---
I wonder how that scam worked? I mean he had to leave his account details on that website right? And that would be beyond stupid
---
They do need to be banned if possible. There are plenty of people who will keep on trading a bot if they figure out it still "works", even though it's muted.
---
Might as well take their scammed gold out of the game while we're at it.
---
I pay $11, let's keep this factually correct.
---
Solid
---
I mean ye, it's about piecing together bits of information from different sources to get control. Could be anything from pictures posted online perhaps you linked to some sort of social media with post history that ties to your IRL, maybe you confided in your cc, perhaps posted personal info on a discord your in? a photo of your work? 
---
All of a sudden you have, acc name, irl name, acc info, creation dates adresses.
---
Its not anri

People on this sub do beginner clue scrolls and act suprised when the loots worth less than 1k gp

Maybe the man’s on that tbow rebuild?

Probably because there is an upvote button, and you parroting a comment in a condescending manner adds nothing to the discussion, and is thus irrelevant.

Definitely a bot owner.

Interestingly he doesn't have perfect rhythm so I think hes not macroing or anything. Not sure though.

Try to read up on the rules before making bold statements.  
---
&gt;You must not advertise, organise, promote, or take part in any unofficial player run games of chance where in-game money or items are staked on the outcome of a random in-game activity. This includes, but is not limited to, all types of chance games where players trade an amount of in game money or items with the expectation that they will receive in game money or items in return based on the outcome of a game of chance or similar activity.
---
It is also against the rules to bet on the outcome of another player's activities within the game, for example: how long it will take to kill a monster, or the outcome of a duel (commonly referred to as "commission staking").
---
As soon as we have the content for it (Hopefully new Morytania content) I'll look at ways in which it can be obtained.   
---
P.S Sorry we teased it so early on without having anywhere to put it.
---
I just want the jmod smackdown
---
aw :')
---
haha?
---
thats the thing, you don't really run essence in Zeah mine. You mine the essence and run to an altar. It's basically RC's version of MLM.
---
Well did 200 kc of ffa tob, got 3 scythes 5b actually so that's 5 answers I guess, started with 300m tho
---
Bro she past away this month...
---
Do ranarrs and make sure you are doing farming contracts. You should also look into birdhouses for some steady income.
---
Tbf you shouldnt cannon tasks if you're struggling with money.
---
And with ranarrs I can make 1m+ a day depending on how many runs I did and the price fluctations. Made 3m once from it in a day. I've never done limpwurts so idk if those really are worth.
---
Other than that I wouldnt starting doing zulrah personally until 80-85 range and magic. Therefore I'd suggest you just continue to build and progress your account. Switch to duradel/nieve whenever you can aswell.
---
I see them all the time when killing corp xD
---
Probably over 80% of top pagers on RS have issues.
---
the real question is why to play albion?
---
Dude if you need to pay for a firecape just stop now. There’s much harder shit in the game than a damn firecape. Plus it’s against the rules.

LMAO BRUH 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Where is this week's vod for the Q&amp;A? Nothing on twitch or YouTube... I need my fix!!!
---
They can force a log
---
So the guy in first peed himself because he did number 1?
---
Respectable. Honestly I quit for 3 months after I failed my fire cape just once. When you sink like 5 hours including prep time just to lose 10% bank value it sucks ass.
---
Goutweed is fucking easy as piss and doesn't force you to retread 20 minutes. It isn't 10+ minutes segments you have to do with zero failures.

100%

Well know we all know what YOU did last summer

Thank you for your service

skillers can't make fun of pkers anymore after this
---
That's. It how it used to work back in 07.
---
Hey. New player to Osrs. I used to play RuneScape classic for years. Now that I'm certain that I will ever see new classic server I thought I would give this game a try. 
---
Should I make a main and a Pker or just stick to one char ?
---
I loved the pvp/Pker aspect of the game due high lose/win stakes.
---
I made new char and I'm at 10 1 30. Do I need magic for pures ? I'm utterly confused. And I know there isn't a quick answer to all this but some sort of advice would be nice. 
---
Thanks in advance.
---
the fire making xp was from my mixtape
---
Haha pls I have a family
---
Also, if you look at the quest log for the mini game you started, you’ll noticed the “lock in hosidius” is scratched out. It has different words but you know what I mean. I just went through this yesterday, so I was asking the same question.

could have had a database leak for your email, id advise putting a 2step auth on the email also just to add some extra security to the account if you get it back.
---
The amount of effort you're going through to justify shitting yourself and wallowing in your own filth for hours is hilarious. Maybe there's a scenario to justify it, but trying to go extra maximum autism on RuneScape isn't it.

If you guys had to jump ship someday, what MMO would you play?

The Brits will pay for this act of homicide
---
To justify? LMFAO. I dont need to justify anything. No amoral act has been committed and im a libertarian. You would have to try harder to justify someone yelling at a football stadium at the expense of everyone else. Good luck.

Festival. Multiple artists over multiple days.

It's good if you want to train strength and can't afford a bludgeon or need a stab weapon and don't want to train attack or defense with a hasta
---
To add to this:
---
There are several good cloud backed authenticators. Authy and LastPass Authenticator are great alternatives that are backed up (encrypted) in the cloud so if you lose or change your phone you can keep all your codes. Use it for you email account as well, not just your RS account. Authenticator doesn’t help if they can disable it from your email.
---
USE A PASSWORD MANAGER! There are free ones, but they are absolutely worth paying for. The biggest vulnerability is using the same password in multiple places and that password being leaked. A password manager allows you to make super secure, random passwords that you never have to remember that are unique for each site. I use LastPass, and it auto fills on mobile for me. There are plenty other good alternatives too.

You illiterate fuckign omnkey

All sports are different. So the sacrifice they undertake is completely different. In soccer you dont need to take a shit or sleep, because it lasts 90 minutes. In other extreme sports or endurance sports you need to sleep. So a sacrifice could take the form of sacrificing some of that sleep to progress further.
---
This, I just recently made a new account and have been using slayermusiq guides with the quick guides up for items needed etc, and there are lots of steps slayermusiq can completely skip. However, for which ones he has done, his new quick guide series is basically the exact same thing as the wiki guides and that’s probably what he’s using to make them, so I really like those
---
Ahahahahahahahahahaha
---
You're beyond dumb

You could have traded it in for about 200 karma it looks like

Tfw all my ranarr/snapdragon runs with 70 farming, green clippies and ultracompost always give me 6 to 8 herbs.

I thought this was gonna be you turning around and showing an irl groot.
---
They're closer to 1.5m now.
---
Nah man it's only like 5 quid
---
Your point got instantly proven wrong and you go with "my point still stands" as defense?
---
Yeah but there’s zero emails at all from Jagex about anything.
---
if your email was compromised you wouldn't see the email as they would have deleted it.
---
What a champ
---
Yes but 500 total takes significantly longer, and most people who get to 500 in f2p are "secured", in the sense that they will probably continue playing in some capacity, but 300 total players maybe not as much. Could maybe change like 1 server in each region from 500 to 300 or something, idk, but i think that new players should be able to escape bots before they get to 500.
---
Either do it passively over time and not have to worry about it ever, or, ignore it and spent a few hours doing something you just cannot be arsed with because you neglected it. If you start em early, you’re never gonna have to actually train hunter after like level 9
---
PSA: easy way to take these off is to pull on the leftover part thats on the inside.
---
Only req is lvl 1 Strength
---
Cawt got scared
---
I’ve not played original Runescape in years and yet I still sometimes search for ‘Rocktail’ in the bank intending to grab an Anglerfish 😅
---
You should really only use blowpipe if you're bossing and cannoning if you can afford it and it's not going to cause you to leak money.
---
To make more money, do farming contracts in the Farming Guild and add birdhouses and Varrock diary Battlestaves  to your runs.
---
Oh you should reread your comment then. You said it wasnt against the rules and that's why he shouldn't interact with people
---
To 1t prayer flick you need to double click once per tick(0.6 seconds) which works out to be 100bpm. So just click at the same time as the music.
---

Thanks for the reply. I see now how dumb I’ve been and I won’t let it happen again!
---
I only bring 3 items for clues in wild. Spade, clue, whip
---
Even if that were to be the case he'd still be trust trading, which counts as a player run game of chance. There's no reason to "test" him before reporting.
---
I want it to be, but atm, it's just a two-handed whip with a better spec
---
yep I agree completely. I'm currently a need and almost maxed, and it's literally destroying me. I can't wait till I'm maxed and have no need to grind fucking mundane skills anymore. I can't imagine doing this to 200ms...
---
the acc is linked to an email i own ive got a gyazo showing the email is a backup to one of my other emails along with another rs email acc that i can remember. By all means they could deny it but I just want to have account security. i also didnt buy the account
---
Thanks for the reply, already changed it!
---
I bet he is betting looking than you.
---
Your mom is so fat it takes 10 Nature runes to alch herself
---
Bpm = beats per minute. If you're tapping your foot along with a song, you're probably tapping along with the beat of the song. 100 bpm means 100 taps per minute, and since there are also 100 game ticks per minute they line up perfectly.
---
you never made the account therefor your not the owner, its like it's not your kid so you aren't the parent, the kidnapped account just got recovered
---
It's no victory and it's 4m which is nothing lets be honest couple lucky hours at barrows
---
You're saying I probably don't know what an api is, insinuating that I'm wrong and that there is one. Show me.
---
My proudest moment was when mrmole replied to a comment I made

That's some fat xp gains

Hey soups guides are only bad when they exist

Got skull tricked at green drags when I started osrs. Saw a pile of dbones on the floor spam clicked to loot em and a guy logged in under me 😂 I got lucky as his tb splashed so I was able to tele.
---
Warding neutral?
---
Honestly get some fucking help lol
---
Or they didn't want the junk items
---
Kthanksbai

But there isn't a distinct rhythm to double click to.

Nice.

I didn't actually know that. Thanks for the info

but will you slow down ?

75 makes it faster, but 70 will do it
---
I'm probably tone deaf, I can't hear the "beat" every 0.6s. In the video the music and his flicking are off-beat too.
---
I just tune them out
---
It also has 100% constant protection it seems like?

For a sturgeon to have caviar like this it needs to be around 20 years old so these guys aren’t something you just kill. Farmed sturgeon even have special guard dogs around them to stop poachers.

You're literally just fueling scammers by giving away your bank to see if they scam you. Them actually making money will just encourage them to keep scamming. You realize you just helped fund the next "drop party" which will scam even more people. Even if the money doubler was "legit" he's most likely just going to scam you after first double to bait you to trade him more. And this is even proven by the fact you continue to trade him after the fact that he already scammed you for 500k. Even if your report helps him get banned you've already given him enough resources to make more accounts and keep scamming.
---
Imo group should be better. This is an MMO not a console single player game. There should be incentives to play in a group in an MMO

By someone else who had the foresight to think about their plan to shit
---
This is 1t prayer flicking.
---
I did? You didn't reply coz no nerd here is man enough to admit when he's wrong?
---
&gt; Also, there's no api. 
---
I can show you couple more ge apis if you want
---
the rewards haven't been announced yet, but with the playtest done soon, hopefully we'll get to know soon
---
could be for pvp
---
m8 if they instantly denied your ticket its due to you not having sufficient evidence proving you are the owner. maybe next time dont buy accounts ?
---
i bought a 1 pray f cape and even kinda regret that
---
I quit before maxing. Wasn't worth it
---
Cool cool cool
---
how long did you wait before posting this
---
2 different people and I do understand that but who scams on a main account with 99s
---
Ouch ow owie
---
I’m assuming they change the password before logging in to give a little pad of time, considering after phishing the owner they have the ip to mask it from anyways
---
His name?
---
when I was younger I once pooped my pants, just a few little pellets, and i let it roll out of my pant leg because I was trying to get a fire cape at the time. Those of you who have never pooped your pants gaming cast the first stone.

Dragon pickaxe and it felt so much faster than with a rune one.

The fish in game are also mating or are getting ready to mate so they're even more grouped, and we're interrupting a lot of fish sex.

I think rs default uses your best axe in inventory and equip slot.

U can wield the gilded with a dragon skilling item in inventory and it’ll be using the dragon but you’ll be holding the swag.

The secret is to go to the comments. Usually there’s one that has upvotes of someone complaining “you didn’t mention to bring this when going here”
---
Try scrolling left in the store interface. I buy bonds on mobile with Google Rewards money and I need to scroll to the left to see all of the bond options.
---
oh shit you're lavine, no wonder i love both users in their respective sites, they're the same person!
---
Whip not expensive though
---
Having your matchmaking method wouldn't really solve this though? Low kc people can already apply to low kc teams. Changing the way teams are formed isnt going to make more low kc players appear. I did my first 5kc completely ffa and it definitely sucked but there's not much that can be done.
---
That's how I see it. A video guide is like having a friend who has a degree in runescape sitting over your shoulder telling you exactly what to do and when.
---
where did you get that number
---
Lol?
---
That was me
---
Having a customer support that isn't almost automated would be a start..right now, it's almost impossible to get anywhere with them to at least look at an issue of this magnitude. It isn't a one account situation and involves the person who bought the account to explain his side of events to someone in the company.
---
Showing billing statement's, the site he bought it from, all the accounts that have now harassed all of the people trying to get this message out, everything, needs a real individual at Jagex. 
---
Overall, investigating and reporting of issues this large can't only be done through a ticket that supports zero pieces of real evidence, and just sounds like a he said/she said situation. Instead, it facilities an individual to exploit the entire system and hurt a lot of individuals who aren't even involved.
---
It took over 7 days to get a response about my disconnection issues and the images I provided were clearly not looked at because of some of the steps they wanted me to take (which were the results of those already).
---
I could go on, but you've lost site. Another individual in the comments clearly gets it and maybe you should check his post out.
---
Competitive skilling is a fucking illness. 
---
You hear about people setting alarms every 20 minutes while they sleep so they can reset at NMZ, or cutting down to 1 calorie-dense meal a day, or skipping class so they can get those hours in. At some point, your rank and your EHP has such a hold on you it's sickening.
---
Thank you, we need more people like you
---
I was talking about level 5 roles (or paying for BA in general) not specifically about tobbers buying torsos because I agree that most already have one
---
The big advantage of BGs over DWh is that even with a avernic offhand, DWH has about 75% the attack as BGS's ridiculous slash bonus. When you are trying to land a first hit, say if you only had 1 spec for a kc, while a DWH may reduce 83 levels off of Graardors level 250 defense, it also is a lot harder to get that payoff. The conept can be pushed further to say hitting any defense reduction is better than none, so against super tanky bosses that you cannot recharge your spec against with a house pool (Corp) BGS specs can be more efficient in a 1:1 comparison. the more DWH specs you have though this become less true, as even one DWH spec is most likely better than 1-2 BGS specs.
---
It's not even possible to protect a rune pouch in any circumstance
---
Lol but where in the game
---
Thanks!
---
This is nice to look at, though.
---
Don't know where else to ask this but where's the latest q&amp;a on twitch? VOD isn't there and it's an extremely valuable one to see considering there's a lot of information about warding.
---
Holy shit why did the raids one get me
---
nope
---
As much as I love OSRS, there was something about logging in for the first time and seeing the game I loved in HD... it was one of the craziest things to me as a kid. I hope one day we can toggle between HD and OSRS but I know that will never happen. Either way, great on these guys and it looks really sick.
---
In the same vein, you can’t really claim that buying a torso (or level 5 roles) is spending 12m per hour because once again, that’s based on times of people who do BA religiously whereas most people have to spend time learning the roles, doing it with worse FFA teams, and likely have teammates leave as well
---
I’m drunk too.
---
Correct, they also do not care about anyone.
---
nice kill time LOOOOOOOOOL
---
Dude you suck at math, how would nine things and ten things make up twenty one things, that makes no sense. This is basic math man. 10th grade stuff. Nine plus ten is eighteen. Man the education system is failing us.

It's like... all the Ironmen are under the same clan and all of them are ruled under one Ironman.

I hear if an ironman kills their best friend, they get some super powered eyes that allow them to see the RNG real time.

Id love to make an ironman/hardcore/ultimate if the endgame was pvp

I mean, it's one banana. How much could it cost,10k?
---
Woops. You’re right. I fixed it now.
---
imagine being an asshole and trying to clear your conscience by posting as the victim, LUL

Will you make another hcim
---
Rune Gloves are pretty good too, and only require partial completion.
---
If you have all the stuff for RFD in your bank already, you can complete it super fast. I did it in like 2 hours on my newest account.
---
If you don't have any of the requirements, just slowly do them over a week. None of the required quests are that bad, except maybe Legends Quest, but you only need partial completion for RFD.
---
Nah gonna keepnplaying this one
---
Do the two quests for maximum kingdom of miscellania profit, try to get Varrock hard done for free money every day. Something fun to do for profit and slayer points is wilderness slayer (I know you said you hate the wilderness, but it's profitable even with a blowpipe and a cannon). I got to 75 magic by alching while watching shows.
---
I am about this
---
you can also swap ur rs3 gp to osrs if you want to
---
I'm a Pmod too, I know how you feel, but after some time you just get used to it, people will always try to flame us just for the hell of it, but whatever, just keep doing what you can do, mute the right people, try to help everyone who needs help, and never ever abuse your power or fall for trolls baits.
---
700M RSGP raised while countless of people are homeless and hungry
---
I was at the GE last night, and there was a pmod there muting the bot. Just at that time, a player was trading the bot to start a gamble. The mod said the player had to stop immediately or he'd mute the player as well. The player obliged and immediately ran off. I asked the pmod if it's against the rules to trade, and he said it is and can get you in trouble. :/
---
I did it once just for fun, so here's hoping I won't be getting banned soon, if that pmod is right.
---
tattered head (256kc) only works for mounting in house. the normal one can be used for 1 of both. it is consumed with that one use. i got my kq head at 198 kc and just knocked out 256 so i got the tattered head for the house and the normal one for helm.
---
Defender role is honestly the most haunting for me to take on. lvl 5 in almost all the other roles if i remember correctly.
---
I'm scared because it feels like I'm playing league when a defender isn't "doing it right" and my team is slowly losing their shit. I sympathies with anyone that has had to deal with the yelling while trying to learn defender.
---
I'll give that a shot, I haven't really touched it as of yet. Would definitely be nice to get some smithing xp too. Thanks!
---
Clearly not you, but not everyone agrees with your opinions or views.  It’s life, deal with it.
---

jagex said they will make ice giant boss any ways, watch the qna's man

Full steel (G) except for helm is recommended. Use ancestral hat instead. Use Staff of earth, earth blast, and wear graceful boots gloves Cape for weight lowering effect.

if you’re doing ToB and paying for torso you need to evaluate your priorities lmak

Nah, it was the bot handlers who are just mad.

You’re the real MVP.

If they don't then that is unfair as fuck

doubt it would be endgame tbh, the only f2p endgame is the smithing skill
---
You have to double click between each tick. A general rule of thumb is to double click when you hear the prayer activate.

Pyramide raids would be awesome.

I just followed your setup and I’m doing 4 min chests(down from 10 mins)

I recently watched a Crumb video about the Venezuelan Gold Farmers. With the company dude interviewed at least, these people made like 4x what doctors over there make. Chu mean barely feed their family? Correct me if im wrong here, but i think the number was 100-150 U.S. dollars. Thats not too shabby eh?
---
This some Five nights at Freddys sht

The gblong bots get banned very fast so one of the alt account is always one of the betters, it generates traffic and gives you an account to off load onto once you get muted.
---
There's a wierd thing with gambling auto bans where your bot gets logged out but then you can log back in and you have about 6 minutes too offload the items before it's gone
---
Dude, you're putting *way* too much thought into this meme. The point of memes is to be quickly recognizable to your target audience, and while I guess granite gloves would technically be more accurate, that's not the point. The point is that the bgloves/cb comparison is made *all the time* in this sub. The comparison itself is a meme, and this post is referencing that meme specifically, not trying to be accurate about what's considered gloves and what's not.
---
I was showing my girlfriend Runescape, "Another good thing about RS is all the interactivity with other people" ... queue me walking into the GE whilst saying this and having 2 people call each other no life fat fucks
---
That sounds way too complicated and time consuming
---
Lol I know. Smithing endgame for everyone almost
---
That gave me chills.
---
It's manually done, yeah. We work our way down slowly starting from the most popular monsters.
---
Train your slayer to do the grotesque guardians. That'll bring your combat stats up too

Yeah this "it's not honest" bullshit is laughable. They're breaking rwt rules. What a stretch to call that dishonest.

I used this: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oxM82YIhNsZSc0yvcPqWtZR0pTQcDorVFcs8-tPTt8A/edit#slide=id.g141eba5f5a_0_126
---
I put it on the left side of the screen, put the zoom on the slides to 100%, and line everything up so that I can see all the information that I need on the slide. There's a slide for each of the four rotations, one is chosen at random when you start the fight.
---
I don't want to overload you with info, but the big dot is zulrah (green = use mage attack and protect from ranged, blue = use ranged attack and protect from mage, red = use mage and either stand in a safe spot to the immediate left/right of a pillar or one square above that or just move before the attack lands), the yellow dot is where you're supposed to stand. Note that there are two dots for where you need to stand for the initial melee phase for the first two rotations, you just need to stand on the one on the right for the first two attacks (the second one always misses when you stand in this spot, I don't know why) and then move to the one to the left before the third attack can hit you.
---
Basically, just get in there and give it a try, and you'll start to figure out which rotation is which. Once you see which it is, click on that slide and you'll have all the information you need.
---
Getting to Zulrah is takes like a minute and a half if you use an ectophial and charter there from Port Phasmatys (3200 gp, 1600 gp if you have done Rum Deal or whatever), so you don't need to use the teleport scrolls or the fairy ring when you're starting out. It's a safe death, so just get back in there and talk to the priestess by the boat and get back out there.
---
Just add great orb project and rcing guild

---
Sell useless acb and pump up your ranged/mage for zulrah, or ranged for vorkath ( also requires big skilling for dragon slayer 2)
---
Harden up about racism? What.
---
Only if you need to recharge it with a (4) prayer potion for each restore

Eh by the time you reasonably should have a whip you should be able to farm barrows.

Farming

Was about to post my rant but then my notepad deleted the whole thing! So Ill breifly summaraize what I intended to say: motherload mining is ugly, REALLY UGLY. You've been spared pleanty of swear words because this injustice of a mess deserves much worse. I mentioned how I am already (99/99) smithing while mining lags at 78. I also brought up the fact that pre 70 Slayer is unprofitable and how I was unhappy to have beat Regicide only to have my dragon halberd deal 0s on Spec. But the nain topic is MLM, I could have gone onto blast mining if it werent for the damage factor in a resorce gathering skill. I am using very pretty words now but should I happen to have another episode over MLM and its garbage visuals, Ill bring it here and it wont be pretty. The players of MLM deserve much better for thier hard work and I imagine with all the widsom in my potato brain that the looks alone on this mini game are robbing us of so much more.

!remindme 2 hours
---
the thing is they prefer to spend 5 hours begging doing nothing than actually grind the money.
---
one time i was trainning some afk skill in ge while a guy was asking for money while not doing nothing and then i went barrows got a piece, came back to sell it on ge and he was still there begging for money.
---
told him to go make his own money and the guy legit said it was easier to ask because he didnt feel like doing it
---
the fault is on the people that give them like +100k so they ~~hop worlds~~ shut up
---
Magic is pretty niche because of its cost and being outshined by melee and ranged. Unless an enemy has low magic defense (Barrows) or is purposefully designed to be fought with mage (Zulrah), there is no point in picking it over Ranged. As for spells, they all have a set max hit that scales with equipment and level, and some like Iban blast or Toxic Trident are inherently convenient or strong, so you don't simply use whatever is the strongest spell in your book.
---
Not anymore
---
Barrows is very doable at low levels. The higher level you are the more money you will make but most of us has had the barrows grind.

Ranarrs is the highlighted one and snaps is the one with the second most profit. I recommend halaldsnakbars spreadsheet for checking stuff like this. It's updated everyday
---
I think futon(?) is the word you're looking for
---
Isnt that part of the challenge though making a pure? 
---
The jagex argument is just bad, it happened once and they fixed the accounts involved
---
Coming from Ohio, don't be overly shocked.  It's just that our crazies usually are too far in the countryside to do much.
---
You cant solo barb assault and chances are none of your high level friends would want to bother doing it.
---
As always, the answer is raids.
---
same would you while not trainning slayer..
---
They had substantial social welfare programs under Chavez which is why he was able to keep his power for so long. And those programs raised the standard of living for huge parts of the population. The programs weren't paid for by taxes so it wasn't exactly redistribution but there was a strong welfare state. But that's not what caused the collapse by any stretch of the imagination
---
Grinding to the best weapons in the game is hard on a low level account? Awww.
---
You failed to get props and acknowledgment in game, so you turned to reddit to fill that void.
---
Why go to Draynor when you can use the deposit box on the docks?
---
I know ppl who do tob and pay like 10 or 15m/h or something like that for zmi runners for insanely fast rc xp since the time save allows them to earn that money back by using that time saved to do more ToB.
---
Also, who tf goes to the toilet on a daily basis?
---
The odds for dice bots are 45% loss, 55% win.
---
Gamble with them long enough and you will lose, not win.
---
I’m sure I’ll pay for this insane rng later on..
---
I wish this happened daily
---
I wish I could up vote this twice. That was a really good come back
---
You can't really use technicality when discussing nebulous concepts like honesty. Everyone knows what gold farmers do - they are out in plain sight killing drags, then they go to websites and sell the gold. There's not really much concealment. You may think that breaking rules is a per se dishonest act, but that's not a universal conception of honesty, so I wouldn't call it technically superior to another view.
---
Unrealistic effort

Usually someone with a super sketchy name pms you asking for account info so they can log on and make the change!

Just kidding please don't tell anyone your account info ever

Nice I'm going to look at this when I get home

Does anybody know what it is actually supposed to be saying? That's pretty cool

Does warding affect f2p?
---
Too good.
---
The fucking egg sack is hanging underneath the crab dude. This is a very old video. I don’t care what your second hand source says it doesn’t mean shit to biology.
---
Same but breaking rules from an mmo from after 2010 is too much
---
What is a dicing bot good sir.
---
This minigame was actually insanely awesome.  One really good player could beat a team of 4 newbies.  I'd love to see this minigame and Fist of Guthix come back
---
It's not effecient. Slayer isn't worth starting until you're at least 60-80+ combat.
---
Breaking the law lmao what
---
my dude you can see it’s eggs hanging off it’s abdomen 😂😂😂
---
Pmod punishments are manually reviewed by Jagex to ensure a Pmod is *not* going power-crazy and muting innocent people. Muting silent bots would bring Jagex's attention to them, resulting in their detection and ban.
---
You haven't really thought this through, have you?
---
That battle was lost when he was bragging to people in a video game about muting other people in a videogame.
---
Dragon is the same speed but has a 1/6 chance to mine a tick faster (so very small speed increase).
---
I didn't say anything about real or fake socialism.
---
The number of downvotes indicates the level of saltiness 😂

---
How does one become a pmod? If there were more pmod's then that would be an easy process to removing these bots.
---
You guys don't realize that he was hacked and this is a way hackers brute force the pin number.
---
How about mining or combat? The ags spec would make me dizzy lol
---
Yea maybe their total bank but if your bank is 170m you're not going to sell everything just to buy the rapier, I still doubt even 1/100 have 170m. You don't realise how many people casually play
---
Anyone that needs to voice how much pussy they get to strangers in a video game definitely just oozes insecurity
---
Can someone ELI5 this to me?
---
Same
---
The unfortunate thing is a new bot probably took over the spot of the muted bot moments after being muted.
---
Unless i've read it wrong it will be part f2p.
---
Someone rushed their opinion
---
You expecting 20mil every clue?😂
---
Me: I dont wanna say it
---
Evil me: say it and bathe in  the downvotes!
---
BRING BACK RUNESPAN!
---
Yeah I might have just missed, it I’m usually sort of afk and zoomed out pretty far. I’m hoping when I do notice it doesn’t ruin it for me too lol
---
For 99? Sure. For 200m? Sure. But records aren't supposed to be easy or low effort
---
For combat enhancing prayers the xp drops you receive  will be blue. For overheads, the prayer symbol will appear over head quickly. If you’re doing the method where you turn them on and off in the same tick the icon will always be over your head.

Ah I see, I don't know about the newer versions I was only around for RSC and RS2.
---
loooooool the questions we all need to be asking
---
When training firemaking goes wrong
---
When a country's economy is based disproportionately on a single commodity (crude oil was ~85% of Venezuelan GDP at peak), it strengths that country's currency so much that it's cheaper to import everything like food and medicine. So much so that domestic suppliers can't compete and go out of business. Which is why there are such extreme shortages now. It was fine before the price of oil crashed because the govt could just import anything it needed. Now that it can't there's no domestic supply either.
---
Oh awesome, sounds like a good investment
---
Got a lot of downvotes on r/worldnews for makinga  joke about it the day it happened.
---
Pure socialism wont work just like pure capitalism won't work. That doesn't mean we can't strive to level the playing field while still allowing for a reasonable incentive to succeed. There's no reason anybody should go without food, clothing, shelter, and education, and there's no reason for any one person to have hundreds of millions, or billions, in assets.

Interesting.. can you explain how?

And world class athletes don't even do it on purpose.

thanks its my first pet :)
---
Are you aware this is marathon running and triathlon and not 3 day runs lol. Most marathons you probably dont even need to take a shit.
---
There is an Indian copy of everyone
---
The economy in Venezuela is shit so they farm gold on Runescape as it pays better than being a doctor over there currently does. Selling gold isn’t very honest work, since it’s illegal in some country’s and against game rules, but they do what they need to for work.
---
In this case it might just be a broken bot since he looks geared up to actually do nmz. But (maybe patched) there was an exploit where activating prayer in a certain delay allowed you to not get marked off for inputting the pin in wrongly. If you see naked accounts flicking prayers there, pour one out for ya boy who got hacked.
---
don't do tree runs, do fruit tree runs

This was me for 2 weeks until yesterday, when my grind finally came to an end.

So many stupid ass people reading 25% of a post and commenting

Snail swaps is what I use

I'd suggest you get P2P, regardless of the state of F2P.
---
I think you can redeem 5 days free membership through OSRS mobile.
---
You can do ranarrs just put them in disease free patches, the 2 troll ones and the Zeah hosidious one
---
I just need to kill a 360 for Karmaja hard diary, what kind of stats do I really need to just get that far? 83 att/str/def/hp but only 38 prayer and 42 range.
---
Is there any way to know to even avoid that without looking at a quest guide? That looked like a one-shot mechanic that you'd have to be well aware of ahead of time.

Lmao @ Ash's response to a reply on that tweet
---
The instance’s what
---
It might be? I honestly haven't quite gotten to that point because I'm a nub. I did do a lot of end raid content in wow though. And I wouldn't say any of those add-ons ever made me feel less accomplishment. But again it's slightly different. In RuneScape, the "hard part" would be figuring out which prayer to flick and when. The client tells you when to do that. In wow the hard part would be actually physically moving to the correct place (which the add-on won't tell you where that is) and basically doing your skills in the right order. I guess a close analogy would be how Deadly Boss Mods gives you a timer for exactly what the boss is going to do and when and what you should do in response. But with so many things on the screen like with wow, the warnings aren't always the easiest thing in the world to notice. You mostly only notice because the default settings of the add-on make a big scary man "RUN AWAY LITTLE GIRL, RUN AWAY!" any time the boss is about to do anything important.
---
&gt; I mean, it's not really socialist anymore, it's just a military dictatorship.
---
Military Dictatorships are the natural endpoint for Socialism. It's an economic system that requires concentrating the wealth and power into a central government, then expecting that government to give up that wealth and power.
---
it's not rs3, it's a mod based on a different game. Actually it's like a WoW style osrs, which sounds kinda awesome for me
---
just play it, its really easy.
---
Tob is more like 13-18m/hr depending on luck. For me personally with my kc and average times I’m around 16m/hr
---
Hahaha it looks better than Rs3 graphics
---
Memories of first 3 days when master rc robes came out. For some reason I was 1v4 (me yellow). I lost first 7 alters cause they defended, then I told them not to defend at nat alter and see what happens. Game turned out 27-25. I was very happy. (Before the mushrooms block the orbs which idk why it just happened)
---
Congratulations! Don't be depressed anymore ;)
---
Im 76.5 but i wont do lavas, maybe ill see you at bloods in a while lol
---
It's pretty similar lookimg to the high damage vork fire which you've already encountered by this point in the quest
---
To be fair you shouldn’t be on a hardcore ‘experimenting’ with the game
---
its not that just black is a popular color for cosmetics in general. I can imagine a lot of people using slayer cape + black graceful for fashionscape.
---
My friends helped me get it free. Be good friend not like op.
---
Yeah, I got a beginner scroll fishing recently
---
Ourania altar, commonly called ZMI. Its located south-west of west ardougne.
---
I think it wants attention
---
Is this like that story where the guy was writing notes to himself but his house was full of carbon monoxide so he had memory loss and thought someone was breaking into his house and leaving notes.
---
It’s literally runescape,
---
Sacred eels
---
Oldschool runescape 2005-2007 4new skills. Oldschool runescape 2013-2019 0new skills, 1 on it's way.. This ia outrageous its unfair!
---
With the Bonecrusher inside the catacombs of Kourend it seems like a decent way to go about things
---
I hereby declare that this shall become the next copypasta
---
I can tell you with utter certainty that being a doctor in Venezuela pays faaaaar more than selling runescape gold
---
Exp waste
---
I’ll take a look at this.
---
Buying karma 500 go ea
---
Thanks I’m going to make this change
---
Why would you go into Galvek without knowing it. Plus that is the easiest of the mechanics to avoid.
---
Tyvm
---
Have a fantastic day
---
Even at just 77 its like 500-600k per hour and its super afk
---
You must be the new one... read his comment again in full
---
Hey, she’s not fat!
---
She’s big-boned.

Haha if ill ever get that skill 99 i sure will
---
True, but getting an idea on why someone doesn't like the skill might help the community suggest better alternatives.
---
Zeg gozer

I’ll be there!
---
Damn hope u get it soon
---
Waarheid
---
yeah but don cheadle was in that movie and frankly he was incredible.
---
I read that and was picturing the plot to the movie memento
---
lmao
---
everyone who has wanted to play vanilla wow has already done it on a private server and newfags like you will quit before getting level 60 and u should realise osrs and wow playerbase is completely different and has always been
---
Im 99 farming i can handle watering some plants
---
Your mama so fat Menaphos disappeared from the map.
---
Checked your HS- Cooking was my first 99 too!
---
Gz
---
Yeah it would. I havent played for quite sometime so I have missed this debate of a new skill but I see the majority is against it and I see no reason why they should not add another skill after all theese years.
---
Not me, for a friend who’s been trying to get a 99 forever. Thanks for coming!
---
Lmao breaking the law.. I bet the average venezuelan gold farmer pays more attention to shit they read than your dumb ass.
---
Beans, carrots and scallions! And some secret stash of personal ranarr
---
They actually get a lot of money, one of my friends used to make like 2-3m an hour average. It is surprising but really cool
---
A few weeks tbh
---
This is the way I've done it too.
---
To add on:
---
When you kill the regular colored mager, go to the yellow mager and do damage on it until it's about 1/4th health.
---
Turn off auto retaliate and step away to stop attacking him.  Pot up to full prayer, health and whatever range boost you are using.  When ready, reenable auto retaliate and kill the yellow mager.  Jad will spawn right where the yellow mager spawned and then the fight begins.
---
Damn you beat the system. I don’t wanna go to jail
---
Lmao shut up
---
it's  simple but I'm so sad that this joke got bodied it gave me a small chuckle
---
Especially hosting on bounty hunter worlds, tons of people tip spare change after a pk
---
i eat don chedle like cheeto
---
I did wait a little tbh but its my acc
---
Only for dust and smoke devils but you should have enough points by then anyway
---
Tried last year didnt past seedling stage. Summers are weird here atm. Too much difference in temperature so trying to figure out right amount of water to give. They taste good so try to farm some! :)
---
Gratzz :)
---
Much less attention and input required, it's not quite AFK but it's much lazier than Vorkath. I'm able to keep a rune dragon alt on pretty much all the time while playing, I'd get tired of Vorkath pretty quick.
---
Afk as fuck. Not nmz levels of afk but like, play another account, study, watch videos levels of afk
---
When asked for further clarification, OP’s Mom added “Quests are for virgins honey”.
---
Nice. You gilded yourself
---
\#justruralchinesethings
---
The only way it makes sense is cost effective. Uses a dfs rather than pots eventually will save enough money for what you spent on Shield
---
&gt;I mean, I'd kill to be making more than the like 600k an hour I can make.
---
Just do barrows then? Almost anyone can do barrows and its around a mil an hour.
---
Imagine going out to eat instead of buying membership to play 6 accounts at once
---
Doesn't Cerberus respawn from the trap door? If you go down there you'll be in a den of Cerberuses.
---
how much you make per hour though?
---
Watch my other video's bro, i do nothing but support the scene, most of the time i am rushing random unskullers
---
Lol or them having an extra rope in the inv instead of an extra food or pot
---
More afk
---
And your experience isn’t the same as others. When I did my torso, it took forever from people dropping out constantly
---
Amazing series man!
---
1 Q P W
---
Yes, but considering you have to ask this, go get your range up to 75 buddy
---
That sounds nice. How much you make per hour?
---
My mate just started and is F2P fishing to a bond
---
Lavas are more enjoyable than ZMI change my mind
---
I think it is fair to say the Gmaul is broken, but in top tier pking you really cannot get a kill without one, so it is needed.
---
I make about 1m but I also have a lance and 90+ combats
---
Last time I checked it was around ~1.2-1.3m/h with supplies deducted
---
I know I need better gear (bolts and god d’hide, prayer gear etc) and I will be buying the best for my level.
---
Around 2mil to spare for fight caves and I’ve been getting too impatient to go for 75 range for the blowpipe and might not have enough to afford it by time I get there
---
Any advice is appreciated! Even if it is get 75 range, I’d rather not waste time if it’s impossible.
---
(I’m also not the best at prayer flicking)
---
I have faith in you porncock
---
than the weapon has nothing to do with it?
---
All items are the same chance, so just add the new ones to the number, it's only slightly rarer
---
Considering buying a cannon and using that to smash the levels it but it’s either wait a fair while levelling or spend a lot of cash using the cannon, getting impatient now haha
---
Oof, look at his eyes the moment Galvek fires the projectile. He looks away for the literal split second that the attack animation happens, then looks back when the projectile is above and off screen.
---
It really is, you should try it sometime
---
That would require a lot of work! 🙃
---
I’m tempted to do a couple of test runs and see, hope you have 99 prayer xox
---
I agree with this statement, 100%
---
When I was doing that quest someone was doing it at the same time and ran out in front of me, he got caught and I ran past to finish the quest
---
What a god
---
https://i.redd.it/04sqdrpnccmz.png
---
 Don't forget to bring 5 stamina potions, np extra 30k per quest like wtf
---
Which is a ludicrous number for an iron man to get for one attempt...
---
Thats my point. 
---
Whats killing PvP is rushers and people camping telespots with TB
---
I’d just use the rs3 gold for bonds and enjoy the grind on osrs
---
This is pretty much what happened on rs3 when i invention came out. A solid 100-200 people racing to secure their overall rank for the next few years.
---
Yep, easiest to carry stews + super restores on person when you're boosting
---
As soon as you see the xp drop for the range hit equip your 2h then click on the player again
---
Press 2 if 2
---
That’s not going to increase the price on anything. People will use methods on items like tube armor and mystic and will always be at alch value
---
Oof
---
Did you add this song in ironically?
---
My opinions arent very welcomed here on reddit. Doesnt matter. I stand by them.   
---
Its good that you seem to be open-minded. Thats always cool.
---
I dont argue that shitting yourself is delicious. And I dont even argue that its healthy to game for extensive hours. But the thing is, this isnt about what is "delicious" or about "whats healthy" people do tons of things they enjoy all the time that arent done out of health concerns, so its so weird when people emphasize this. And I also said I would only shit my self if I was really far into an attempt and it would be the difference maker between #1 and #2. Arent many cases of that. But its all situational. I probably wouldnt do it, but itd be evaluated on a case by case.
---
Also the reason I’m asking is just for second opinions
---
I know with enough determination it’s possible but I’d rather know I stand a good chance
---
Hes so handsome.
---
Do you have perm mute powers or do they only last for a few hours
---
Murder confession...??
---
Definitely not ready for barrows.
---
I didn't keep track but here's beck-of-envelope math. 3,5k each to buy them and and 1000-2500gp loss per jar opened. 1/25 chance to get clue. 
---
On average you'd need 12,5k jars an on guesstimate loss 2000gp per jar you'd be left with 25m cost.
---
Depends on how active u like to be when playing. Lavas are very hands on
---
Was mine... I have right click options and tried to wield it but dropped it by mistake and didn’t realize I wasn’t wearing it till I teled away. Any chance I could get it back? I spent a lot of time making the money for it by killing brutal blacks
---
Fr tho, hands down my favorite osrs thread so far. Something about runescape based yo mamma jokes fucking kill me
---
63 to 75 is pretty fast without a cannon
---
2
---
;)
---
Then I saw the r/2007scape
---
Fuck so not worth huh
---
Any tips on where to train? So far I’ve been doing daganoths (mostly because they’re quiet)
---
3 lefts do actually
---
What is it eating?
---
I totally disagree. I did mine in about 5 hours just standing in wave 1's lobby to get a group. 
---
I may have been lucky, but it's absolutely doable solo.
---
I will purchase this off you for a mere 100k 🦀
---
Also south of falador as well. Every world, 2 or 3 of em.
---
This is why most of the time, but always ehen hitting the he, I just keep public chat off.
---
Click intensive and decent chance of getting pked for 75k more xp/hr no thanks lol. Getting pked or having to leave the altar early would lose you a lot of xp/hr too
---
Dude why don't you just go to empty worlds
---
It's not
---
1,4k points so effectively you tried not to do anything ? Lolwut?
---
What were you doing when you got it, pickpocket men?
---
11m/hour is ~$1.70 USD per hour. In third world countries this could be one of the best job opportunities out there
---
i was in the raid on my main while alching on the ironman, im surpised my main didnt get the drop i had most of the pts
---
Really? You never thought you'd see a reference to a show that birthed a very popular meme? The very same meme that the person you responded to was referring to?
---
The horrible and clunky mechanics are exactly why I love it.
---
Brings me back to the release of osrs
---
Invest in other things that will have greater return for the investment. Options include:
---
1.) higher prayer so that every dose of ppot restores more prayer. 
---
2.) 83 con and a pool/jewelry box/occult altar
---
3.) rigour for bossing
---
4.) just keep your stack of cash a stack of cash. If your assets are liquidated then you can access a greater range of content by buying and reselling key items for any particular activity. If u wanna kill vorkath for a bit, just buy a dhcb and resell it when you’re done. 
---
Imo construction was my greatest investment in terms of quality of life. Getting high prayer early probably saved me a bunch in the long run as well based on the amount of slayer and bossing I’ve done. In the end, do whatever the FUCK u wanna do tho. It’s ur money
---
Ayy, everyone would like some silver on 4/20
---
That's one shitty guide then. Orange mage is where jad spawns and if you see him you'll have time to change pray if needed.
---
You're a God damn hero
---
To be fair if he's trying to max then he's probably not spending loads of time on the game, provided he has been playing for a while. These people that are prepared to shit themselves are usually already maxed and are going for 200ms, so it may not be such a big concern. That being said, playing the game when you aren't enjoying it is so stupid.
---
That’s absolutely disgusting, what the fuck dude. Get help
---
unless u have a moneymaking method to get gold in game 15-30m/hr its literally not worth it tho
---
Mod Ashwin
---
Miss those days
---
What does baying have to do with this?
---
It literally is if you dont enjoy barb assault but do enjoy netflix.
---
Staying alive has 103 bpm, however the ideal bpm for CPR is 100 I believe so you would be suggesting an improvement!
---
Runescape! Saving lives since 2007scape.
---
They can be safe spotted!
---
Wooooo! Love the vids man
---
this method is up to 46k agility and 165k thieving xp per hour. so its comparable to seers rooftop+ a free 166k theving xp/hr on top
---
Avernic is possibly the last thing I would even think about upgrading, especially if you are raiding etc.
---
The guides themselves arent perfect but its nice to listen to her voice
---
It's not because of your dds it's because of your level lul why would a 70cmb pure waste time splashing on a 100+ tanking brews?
---
Just get a irl job and buy bonds = $$$. It's a win win situation both irl and ingame
---
People will tell you that you should train slayer early with combat, but it's not effecient, and most tasks are too hard to do early on for it to be worth it. I recommend not to even really start slayer until like 50-80 combat or so.
---
yes but you should drink more water which makes you piss more often
---
one word, goingcrazy201
---
Idk why they don’t just replicate the one in Tzhaar fight caves.
---
First of all, it’s at minimum 500k xp/hr. At max it’s at 550k xp/hr (compared to 425k xp/hr max for ensouled dragon heads) so you’re looking at 125k xp/hr more while also using a cheaper method.
---
Second of all, as someone who’s done both, I can confidently say that wildy altar is by far the better method. The only time you will get pk’d for your entire inv is if they catch you running to the altar. Most pkers will be inside the altar so that’s unlikely. Also, you ideally take Dinh’s + two tank gear (arma top/bottom or black d’hide or justiciar) and camp augury and protection pray. At high def and magic, you will use up your entire inv before you get pked unless there’s a team. Add in the fact that you do this on a high risk pk world where there are even less pkers (plus a chest right next to your respawn location) and the method is even better.
---
Go for it, man. The grind to 77 isn't that terrible (less than 50 hours at zmi), and then 77-82 is afk as fuck at bloods.
---
Then you can get started on astrals and you're pretty much set. I personally can't stand doing more than a few hours of bossing, but when I went for 99 rc I could just pop up netflix on a second monitor, open a beer and chill all day earning 1m+ per hour. It's pretty sweet.
---
Even doing 77-91 at bloods and 91-99 at astrals (plan was to do nats, but I didn't realize astrals were, at the time, the same money and more exp/h) I made over 300m over some months of casual playing. Definitely worth it if you can get into it, imo.
---
I see one comment that sounds like the one you're referencing, a few are satire, and then all the other comments are "pathetic" "such a loser" "wow shit his pants and didn't even get rank 1, pathetic" "can't even get rank 1 after shitting himself"
---
Ancient Wyvern Shield is the only one that provides immunity to their freeze. But only the Wyverns freeze. Doesnt work for Vorkath.
---
4/20
---
Why not use what works?
---
Where at? I tried going north of Burthrope and couldn’t even make it to where the trolls were without having to tele out
---
At what point would I be considered a non-leecher?
---
Tzhaar isn't an instance so when when game things you've moved invisibly to another location it doesn't close the area where you where.
---
And here I thought having 70 Runecrafting was good enough, that’s depressing
---
It's a 30hr record, he most likely just pooped before. I poop like once a week, for instance.
---
This isn’t Facebook
---
I was pickpicketing men :) thanks for telling me the odds
---
I average right around 1:50-2:00 with a PB of 1:35 using BP, 99 range, and addy darts. Tbow gets you to the 1:30-1:40 range.
---
After toxic trident comes sanguinesti staff, btw.

Well my first task was 42 level 1 monkeys then my next one ended up being the 111 trolls that are way stronger than me. Just seems counterintuitive to give me slayer tasks that I can’t even kill one of the monsters yet, let alone 111. 
---
I played about 14 years ago and I don’t remember it being like this :/
---
Yeah, but dog you wouldn’t believe how much pussy I get irl
---
Well a leecher is someone who boosts. I.e the people who get paid to boost torso, lvl 5s, boots, hats. 
---
A leech is a person who gets boosted.
---
you fool, you fell victim to one of the classic blunders
---
Bonds exist. All that rwt affects is bond price, that's it.
---
\&gt;Not using tbow at skotizo
---
Reddit letttin is down fr right now
---
Well if everything you've said in your post was true then you wouldnt have gotten hacked :)
---
Where are the mushrooms
---
Right cause pkers can see in your inventory and realize this
---
Im look at starting herbi soon. How essential is herb sack?
---
I dont mind grinding slayer for some points to buy it but does it make a huge difference?
---
Thank you for the inspiration!
---
Mod Al Ash.
---
I can maybe go with that possibility, but there's much more valuable things they could have taken from me other than 270m gp on runescape - is there a more compound check i can do for a RAT?
---
Silliucebin mushrooms
---
Farming for herb runs and hunter for bird houses. They grow while not logged on so I usually end my session with a run and then when I log back on I’m already there ready for another one.
---
You should go to barbarian fishing for your next video hahaha.
---
This one is wildly underrated
---
Know its not a big deal but back when I was playing in the library at middle school I used to look at people in dragon gear and wnat it so bad
---
If you can afford to keep tbow, anguish, occult, Kodai then absolutely
---
You can make 1m/hr or around that at a lot of slayer tasks (kurasks/spirituals/krakens/brutal blacks/etc) with cheap gear. Or you could farm vork for few mils an hour with only black dhide and blowpipe.
---
The website and official RuneScape client both had adverts but I don't think that's the case anymore. Not exactly checked recently though.
---
Except Wells Fargo fixed theirs and our system wont ever see an update
---
What exp/h did you have ? I want 77 my self.
---
The NPCs wander around randomly, and can sometimes go under your trap and not trigger it. They "attack" the traps at certain intervals.
---
Also for Salamanders, each Salamander is assigned their own tree branch, only that single Salamander can go into a trap that is set on that tree branch.
---
That's a yikes
---
Uhh
---
Maybe at least give us a timestamp?
---
Revs crashed dragonstones and around the same time ds2 monsters dropped loads of the tips. Also outdated due to dragon metal bolts.
---
Fair enough. I just hope the jad kills don’t go to slow while the Adrenalin is blasting with an acb.
---
I'd love to watch a muting rs video lol
---
its not the corporal beast btw its the corporeal beast
---
sold it for 56m! :)
---
Gratz :) maby i can get some luck to, 675 kc dry for first item on my IM. (Not even an onyx)
---
Except we aren't talking about bots, we are talking about Venezuelan rwt. Rwt =\= botting
---
Whenever an account harshly limits themselves, there can be a sort of frustration with the imposed rules. When it is limited to an area, the borders of the rules are a bit easier to accept than when it is spanning the entire game but ignoring much of the game. I think the concept of a time restricted account is fine and it isn't the first one I've seen; Rargh has a 2005 Ironman, Slayermusiq1 had an account that progressed through game eras, and J1mmy has By Release. That said all but the first do have an element of progression to them rather than being fixed solely to a specific time.
---
Either way, I do think such challenges can make for an interesting series and I'd chalk any of my disinterest in B0aty's Nostalgia Trip series to how he goes about the video rather than the account type. It probably won't come as much of a shock to say this, but B0aty is more of a streamer than a video maker, at least these days. I mean his new series doesn't even try to have a thumbnail... The video can come off as clips recorded while streaming and not clips made for a video. Back in the day, that may not have been a big deal but nowadays there are a lot of high-quality video series so the juxtaposition between the two styles is glaringly obvious.
---
nah sorry dawg I'm honestly playin osrs from my prison cell atm.
---
Are you aware of how it used to be like?
---
I feel like if you can afford a tbow you can save up a few more mil for blessed dhide.
---
Library is more enjoyable than ZMI or lavas change my mind
---
has been like this forever just get the hard diary done
---
Wood ya look at dat
---
When I was a kid I just clicked the orbs without knowing that you had to put them into the alter. So, I sent them the opposite way a lot of the time. Def pissed off a lot of people.
---
Haveibeenpwned
---
You can check email and passwords
---
how will I burn out? Ill max in approx 3 weeks and from that point I can finally enjoy the game again doing whatever the fuck I enjoy.
---
IRONMEN BYOF

\*PMod

Stay calm or die my friend

Same lmao
---
Ur the only true PKer left!
---
ye, now it is just bad, it used to be awful.
---
How would they know if you were blocking ads though?
---
F
---
Theres enough emptes to make an alphabet... this is plausible
---
it clearly doesn't make them happy lol most of the EHP nerds are depressed as fuck.
---
There's nobody pulling the strings? Bots are setting themselves up now? CREATING THEIR OWN SCRIPTS ! Please ..
---
IDK why it does this sometimes. It may be that the comment was edited or such and that messed it up. Or maybe AutoMod was on break?
---
They do though
---
Ouch
---
Sire and hydra both have double RDT, but for sire they're the same while hydra they differ.
---
So the odds of hitting double shield half are the odds of getting a shield left off the RDT, squared.
---
I am fortunate enough to not have to fear sherlock anymore. It's amazing. 
---
Although fixing the lamp in dorgesh-kaan is annoying and the skullball one is too.
---
I think he's talking about me, and ever since I put max goal in November I've been averaging 10h+ a day on runescape. I know it's sad, but I just want to max asap so I can enjoy the game again.
---
The most afk smithing xp in the game? Are you just saying smite the bots? It's the only place people make cannonballs because of how close it is to the bank
---
Don't get too hung up on efficiency-scape. Wander around, do noob things, focus on fun first and let the high-level content go hang. 
---
I try to stay away from a lot of video content/creators on YouTube because many seem aimed at a higher-level, more well-funded audience. Either that or high-efficiency flexing. I swear, the next time I see a tutorial recommend an eight- or nine-digit pricetag loadout I'm going to... just click away from the video again. 
---
If you get membership (P2P) I suggest looking into the Achievement diaries. The various tiers (easy/medium/hard/elite) give very reasonable goals for certain stages of play, loosely corresponding to "30s in stats, 50s in stats, 70s in stats, &gt;90 in stats" for each tier respectively. They've also been educational - they give rewards that sometimes appear strange or worthless at first, but most of them have turned out to be useful as I learn more about the game. 
---
A few quests recommended for membership: 
---
* Lots of people recommend doing Waterfall quest quite early as it's easy to do with very few requirements, but gives substantial combat XP. 
---
* Doing Recruitment Drive in Falador gives enough Agility XP to skip having to go aalllllll the way to the Gnome Stronghold to start. 
---
* Recipe for Disaster is a quest that's easy to start but hard to get full completion; however, even completing a few of the sub-quests gives access to some very handy gear. Specifically, the gloves earned are way better than anything else you can get for those slots; the final upgrade (Barrows Gloves) are basically best in the game. 
---
* Druidic Ritual opens up the Herblore skill and isn't hard to do; it's worth the time early. 
---
* Tears of Guthix requires 42 Quest Points but helps train your weakest skill every week; suggest doing this as soon as possible.
---
Take the defender off my guy
---
Bru i got one too
---
Those who login with a Google account.
---
Fire giants = ez skip, trash task
---
Gears gonna be changed when I try the caves
---
Noob question - what’s the significance of 77 rc?
---
At least we've still got /r/DragonsFuckingCars and /r/CarsFuckingDragons
---
my b it has dropped quite a bit
---
Honestly saying goofy shit to instant tele is pretty fun
---
where's the image for "when you post the mspaint drawings again and get double digit upvotes"
---
Im still quite new to the game aswell, i don’t believe you get a boost i think they meant its faster if you click on each individual bone to the altar rather than the auto method which is slower.
---
Did you enjoy playing Old School RuneScape today though? Don't leave us hanging
---
It does indeed rock prayer bonus nice
---
Which is more time:
---
Farming 24m and then getting carried through the cave
---
Farming 18m and you're done
---
Nevermind then
---
use hammer on the egg
---
u just need to use them faster than it autouses them
---
Geez remember when that thing was 30m all the time
---
Wow that's really spectacular. Nice job man.
---
Ah, I follow now. And 75 RC is for the pouch.
---
Really?
---
Farming 18m and youre done
---
And that dragon...
---
 Vorkath
---
I do a bunch Skilling on my lvl 3 alt. Not that uncommon. But yea. Theres still a lot of bots
---
awping noobs in pvp
---
You should never be ranging with a defender on even when training, it has negative ranged bonus
---
Man I facerolled through ds2 I can’t tell you anything about the lore
---
Ahh damn... was hoping that was not the case... xD
---
Fuck I remember seeing those left on the ground like wtf. Now I don't even bring a avas when I brid
---
fire giant boss like Glod would be kinda cool
---
It is guaranteed to get the tattered one at 256kc, you're actually lucky they updated that or you'd still be there lol
---
Also they could just stop at 96, save 3m exp worth of bones, and still get the same # restore per pot.
---
You,could just de iron tho
---
You’re actually making a loss of around 300 per gold bar smelted.
---
jmod smack down.       /s gl though with the account. Sounds like a fun time.
---
Or guthix blessed dhide with the Robin hood hat and boots. That's some slick fasionscape
---
The *government* wants "fixed exchange rates", nobody on the street gives a damn about the government exchange rate. You are conflating government stance with people on the street. Also, of course they are increasing salary daily, that's how hyperinflation works. If everyone had the same exact wage through it, the buying power remains the same. You can't charge $100 for a gallon of milk if everyone is only receiving $0.25 a day....
---
more aids than getting hundreds of thousands of mining exp
---
Proof hahahahahahaha. Man you guys are so ignorant. All they did was try to shift the subject and avoid the reality of them breaching user information. He admitted knowing that users store usernames and passwords.

I really wanted to do this, but 70 construction and herblore isn't happening for this ironman anytime soon :(

Ok yeah if you aren't memeing then yeah that's fucked lol

Being pedantic doesn't really change my point but sure. Pretty aggressive for no reason old chum :)
---
Meh I enjoy mining, it’s slow af but I’m only 100k exp away now anyway
---
I said this 5 hours earlier on a different post, same format and got 11 downvotes :)
---
Anglers/sharks and saving a few hours of agility and strength training
---
Haha yeah haha you totally haha don't care lol haha so casual
---
Ahahaha, already have a main :) 
---
Thanks for the suggestion though :D
---
would shiting yourself during a 1v1 in dmmt be ok?
---
Wear the body and skirt, obby armour is not great defensively so you will get way less time on your main weapon using it.
---
i don't have twitter
---
But one is almost 1/10 of the price
---
Tattered head is an auto drop after that many kills, actually.
---
printscreen.. use it.
---
I think zulrah started dropping them as well, which dropped them before revs
---
Yup. He could collect and eat if he so wanted, but I really doubt he would stoop THAT low.
---
That's for the rich. I rock ancient chaps and coif, armadyl body, guthix boots and vambs, and blowpipe. Pretty slick
---
Jmod smack down?
---
Misusing a service to store your private data, and then syncing that data with an api is not a breach of privacy. I doubt Runelite configs store any sort of PII or PCI data in the first place, so you're being utterly ridiculous.
---
It kinda is. Some people are playing it in the side to out thunder dragon boards. See Jeff Jones ycs Atlanta list.
---
dont expect that much from an apple user...
---
At 77 you unlock Zeah Runecrafting, which is known for being afk, at least in relation to other methods of training RC.
---
Just save the post
---
first good one of these in a while
---
Its what happens when people make a post saying they were unfairly banned then a jmod give damning evidence that the were banned fairly. They’re quite funny. One happens recently with someone named tracy.
---
Ughh I'm 215 dry of a b ring rn. This hurts to look at
---
For a whole 60 minutes. Great job
---
Got it! I’ll have to look it up. Thanks :)
---
I will definitly be making a video on dragon slayer II in the future!
---
Or just make another shitty “mom can we get some” meme
---
just look up a guide, will take you literally 10 minutes to figure out gear, inventory, and strategy.  60 magic is fine if you have iban’s staff.  Barrows is by far the easiest “boss” to learn and do in the game.
---
Lmao, yes this is exactly me too
---
Yeah the guys just a cunt lmfao no wonder he got banned from RL disc XD
---
id love. LOVE. to see a yes/no % difference based on total lvls.
---
Good that the crystal shield prots over items such as ballista. The shield is very cheap and gives stupid range defense. Ive noticed a lot more people using the shield lately and its annoying hitting constant 0s
---
You don't need prayer pots and you gain more death runes than you can cast with Iban Blast even at 50 magic which is the level req to cast it.
---
The mining xp is permanent though, so you'll never have to stew again.
---
Yeah but think of the 3 pray points you get when you are full. Check mate atheists
---
It's cute that you think there isn't a bit of conditional logic in place to ensure that almost all significant bets conveniently flub.
---
Most overrated skill in rs history
---
So who called you a power tripper, and how were they aware of your presence?
---
Gratz on 99 dude!
---
You don't need to finish MEP2 to kill dark beasts. I haven't done it myself but I remember Woox getting a talisman from dark beasts on his irorman.
---
That old chum got to you didn't it hahah, aww bless you
---
Runescape good
---
You probably don't have to if you go during the breaks or hold it in a bit longer.
---
Mod Ashira.
---
Could've just popped an Imodium as well
---
I remember selling it for 16 mil a year or two into release of the game
---
Step 1: Gilded pickaxe was 550k~
---
Step 2: sell Gilded pickaxe today for 55m~
---
Step 3: enjoy the bonds and extra cash
---
I bought 3 items of this list and hopefully profit more tomorrow!
---
I just don't think my skills are up to it yet. Maybe when I get 60 magic and 60 ranged, maybe.
---
I'd say it's mostly from the constant ranger damage while I'm trying to drag the 180 around so that he doesn't melee me.
---
oh so we're back to the "its just a game". That works everywhere "its just a hobby" "its just a sport" "its just a race". 
---
Just because you see no value in it doesn't mean it has no value to others. In this case it wasnt an entire week or dmmt 1v1s, it was a day record attempt. As someone who has done a 30 hour click intensive record attempt i can tell you its insanely taxing and not something you can just "try again tomorrow". 
---
He was 28 hours in a 30 hour session, maybe his goal wasnt to beat anyone but to do the best he could. You don't know
---
i agree personally
---
Well if you go by the [inventory icons](https://i.imgur.com/GcV35mJ.jpg), the rack is just a carrier for the bolts, so it's still just 1 bolt per shot
---
I think most of the damage came from the rangers over the course of the cave. =/
---
I remember distinctly once getting hit 13-13-13 by the ranges and a 7 from the 45s.
---
Oof I've just checked and I've been pwned
---
Was using addy darts, pretty sure I just am going to go to Dragons as well, I could give a fuck about the money, I don't want to deal with this shit any more.
---
Did it a couple days ago with base 80s in all combat and 70 prayer. It's actually very fun, don't need to be maxed. I used a rune crossbow on Galvek with enchanted bolts, only took two tries. You'll have a good time
---
Whats even left to do after you max?
---
Please please please fix this, Jagex
---
Are the reqs cross linked to other quests once checked off?
---
Herb runs, bird house runs, and start NMZ for herb boxes
---
you'd be surprised, I've died 6 times there in 2 days
---
Can I use summer pie to boost agility for mountain daughter and the depths of despair?
---
Keep grinding mate, you'll get it! At least you have the axes ;)
---
Youre not even really pking if youre pking at 20 cb in f2p. Get 60 cb at least which is like 40 atk 70 str 80 range.
---
I mean yeah, minimum is 0k if you just don’t do anything. I guess I meant it’s 500k+ assuming you are clicking every bone
---
Nah I've been pmod for about 3 years now.
---
I got it and I safespot ankous currently so yeah
---
That tax is crazy
---
[Doesn't look like it](https://imgur.com/581r74a)
---
Its less click intensive.
---
You're literally crying about advertisers when you use macros to advertise on multiple worlds lol
---
Why are you wasting your free time cleaning up the game when you don't get paid for it?
---
IMO Pmods should never feel the responsibility to do anything more than mute rule breakers as they come across them naturally.
---
Anything more than that and you should be getting paid.
---
u wot
---
Probably started checking each bot and noticing him there?
---
If you train to 75 so pest control so you can get full void
---
Nechryaels too.
---
It's the best item for afk training with full obby in normal nmz using the absorption method (assuming you dont have 100m for avernic)
---
Found the guy who didn’t play before OSRS
---
Love me some infinitity stones
---
What's the difference between the premium and regular leeching service?
---
e-mail verification is an easy huge step to make.
---
you took my visafe
---
If you take a look at these items in GE tracker you will see that none of these ever sold for the listed start price. When new tradeable items are added, Jagex has to make a guess as to the item price so they can have an initial GE value. What you're seeing here isn't price rises as such, it's the price adjusting to a more representative value.
---
The scaling on the rewards if very insignificant, someone did a comparison video of having 1 in all the stats, and having 99 in all the stats and it was only like a 10-15% difference
---
Barrage/cannon tasks are 60-120k/hr, total optimal average slayer xp is like 80k. And fast tasks like dragons or zygomites take &lt;5 minutes.
---
or just skip it and never think about it at all 🤷‍♂️
---
if you let it auto pray its a little over 250kxp an hr, thats using 1 bone on the altar and just letting it go
---

I’m in the process of my second master clue too, I’ve grinded to 85 mining and currently grinding 80 crafting to complete it (damn sherlock). I could use some loot like that!
---
I always bring 2 bastions, 8 brews and rest restores. 92 range atm and 89 defence. Done it since a lot lower levels with ease.
---
You should really be getting to jad with atleast 6 brews left in my case. Healers shouldn't hit too much but if they do just drink a brew and keep an eye on jads attacks.
---
What am I looking at? Someone setting a cannon up at a highly contested training area?
---
Are those the swords of revealing light?
---
Uhh was this explained somewhere? I just bought it off of the ge
---
Im pretty sure you do get my point but you just do not want to conceded.
---
There are some things worth shitting yourself for. if you cannot agree to this at all, i'd consider you mentally disabled. 
---
Now the next thing is where is your personal line for what you would shit yourself for. Obviously youd shit yourself for 10 million dollars. 
---
Now if you play runescape consistently and i asked you if youd shit yourself for losing last weeks account progress you'd probably say no.
---
But if i said lose past 6 months account progress or straight up delete your account, you'd probably reconsider.
---
Feels kind of weird to have to spell this out to your like you were a 4 year old.
---
So instead let me ask this to settle this. Would you shit yourself if it ment that jagex would delete your account?
---
When you say you wanna go get stoned but get crushed by a giant boulder.  rip
---
Same logic applies to most posts here. For example the RL loot tracker, you can easily kill 1k monsters then just hide all the decent drops from the tracker and then post a screenshot of it showing how “dry” you are. Yet these posts reach front page daily.
---
Dude set his cannon right next to mine
---
You stupid? You can get third age from that master clue like it couldve been 300k. So yeah, it could've been 500mill
---
Zulrah dropped them massively which was before the time on your graph or ge.
---
I can only manage like 350k with gold ores
---
Why wouldn't that be allowed?
---
so whats the xp doing this, where you afk
---
Dude, i grinded from 69 to 76 herblore. After that from 75 to 80 crafting. All for this master clue.. Just do it, it could be worth it. I proved it 😉
---
Goodluck
---
Leave me alone, I just want to do my slayer task without being personally attacked.
---
Haha she got stoned all right
---
Yeah but who cares
---
God damn Jmods catering to the Youtubers
---
See heaps of pets deep wild when teams fall in on me lmao
---
Been hunting down Grotesque Guardians for my garg tasks. What's the best use of granite cballs? 
---
Lizard shaman tasks?
---
Duuude i know how to make a pipe from the ancient staff broh
---
So he doesn't get hacked bro
---
I looked up your stats, at 500\~ total level it is going to be very hard to afford to pay for bonds early. You're looking at playing for something like 30 hours to pay for a bond, compared to more like 1 hour when you can do later game content. Someone linked the wiki money making guide which is a good resource
---
its tough out there in f2p
---
I wonder how many double xp ads there would be if the client still showed it for f2p 🌚
---
Good suggestion, was noticing earlier how the gloves don’t match.
---
Funny thing is even rs3 has moved towards this. So many 1 shot boss mechanics. I don't get why people would like this and why they think we would
---
If you can't tank a tb from v square to bank you shouldn't be pking that's like 3/4 freezes assuming they do it perfectly and don't splash
---
Some people are generous af too.  I have an account where I can't use GE so I just trade people.  I look nooby and people always just give me the damn items for free.  Rune armor, dragon weapons, etc so far.
---
&gt;Save
---
Thanks! :)
---
You'll get your money back when you sell so nbd.
---
Definitely quest for RFD asap though!
---
100% of people that have brain activity look at the poster of whatever comment they are commenting on. Thanks for confirming you don’t have any.

Q
---
Yeah rip
---
Hey! I paid a hard 150k gp to have the right to!
---
Deep wild they would, mainly the guys risking alot. Only way to kill them is ags or claw gmaul stack. They don't let them selves drop close to 80 hp so it's basically impossible without gmaul to get kills on em.
---
Tht mfer be moving fast as fuck boi
---
Year has only 12 months
---
Definitely nobody has access to my computer, my login/pin is known to a friend of mine due to him playing on an old account of mine, but this is a friend with no motive to do so and claims nothing regarding the hacking - I would assume it's an inside job and that it was my friend but i'd very much like clarification, as he would never have known my password anyway and like I said, has absolutely no motive to do so.
---
I should note my account is also a pure, the hacker didnt level my defence, didnt drop any untradables, didn't sell anything in g.e, just took my stuff and logged coincidentally as I was out for the night (which is hardly the case lol)
---
Fucc unskullers awesome account btw
---
It’s kind of a dick move but we don’t own spots even if we got there first.  You should do biohazard for the other cannon spot it’s usually a bit less competition
---
oh no, "rant rant" A player did exactly what I did but one tile to the west "rant rant" only I'm able to cannon here "rant rant" this player should be banned.
---
I kept on getting stretches of cannon tasks. AFK cannoning for 30 minutes just to get another AFK cannon task wore me thin, so I banned them.
---
Wait, I thought if you dropped any item, somebody can pick it up after a minute? You mean there's special rules just for items that can't be sold?
---
