Fuck that, gaining xp PKing is something you've had to account for since the game came out. All 10hp rushers alone would be awful, let alone all the other douchey builds.

the map in the blog of the dungeon feels so much like older dungeon designs, love it

Sarachnid looks awesome! Sick dungeon too

Slayer and farming contracts should be enough, and honestly watermelons aren't that great anyway.

korasi? nice bait :D

Agreed, just don't be stupid and don't get lured...
---
As someone who only recently played his first wintertodt game, I finally get this meme
---
Kinda awkward that you'd say that when most MMO bosses reside in instanced dungeons or raids but ok.
---
You're telling me people pay 150 dollars to go to a convention for this game?
---

---
And I thought other things were stupid.
---
Pump and dumb baby
---
See the problem is we would definitely lose in a fight.
---
That is 2x exactly lol. The series is convergent. The same way we write e=lim_{n\rightarrow\infry}(1+1/n)^n.
---
I don't know, man. I swing a mean pickaxe.
---
What a toxic mindset.
---
"Anyone against the removal of free trade is an RWT'er"
---
I resent how readily this community throws away minority portions of the playerbase with no care when they think it'll have some other benefit.  Three majority hates pkers, hates pures, hated ironmen until recently, hates people who don't like questing, hates people who only like skilling, etc. etc. etc.
---
They are reworking bounty hunter. I'm assuming they will have some sort of wall to prevent bots from easily participating
---
pretty fuckin terrible. worse than runecrafting.

I wonder if you're more biased because you're bad at PKing or because you're an 83 Combat pure?

Probably both.
---
There is a bukake of dopamine in my brain rn.

I did the exact same with some guy in the stronghold when I got my 99 slayer, he made it really special 💖 even called me Slayer Master Naqvi

Does my WoW membership connect to my hearthstone?
---
Maybe unpopular opinion but the music montage in the middle totally detracted from the video...
---
We watch for the interesting account and commentary, not for your taste in music
---
Social awareness is a skill not built in your bedroom playing RuneScape
---
Yes.  Membership is shared between both games, it's not possible to only have membership on one of the two.
---
Owie
---
thanks
---
such a boring streamer
---
I think they made finding Lord Crwys into a Farming/Woodcutting activity rather than just Woodcutting, and I believe they are making finding Lord Amlodd into some type of Hunter activity instead of Summoning. Probably will just put Lady Meilyr somewhere else besides Daemonheim to skip the Dungeoneering portion.
---
It's not really a replacement for any of those. Tree runs with tree seeds from bird nests and other sources are the best way to get farming xp, slayer usually gets you herb seeds for herblore training, Tithe is cancer incarnate but good extra farming xp if done complementing tree runs (though I don't recommend it for xp's sake)
---
What watermelon seeds are good for is huge amounts of convenient supercompost that you can turn into ultracompost (with some farming gains as a plus). When you are doing tons of herb runs you'll be needing hundreds upon hundreds of ultracompost, having some volcanic ash with you on allotment runs means you can simultaneously make ultracompost in all your bins while harvesting and planting the melons. And Temple treks are a good way to get a ton of melon seeds fast.
---
Probably from zulrah. The drops are shared in the log
---
I love answering questions here so keep em coming
---
Imagine trying to buy an obby cape and getting a noted black cape
---
Yea, was definitely an unnecessary change.
---
Dargon sord
---
I was really disappointed that there's no super expensive fashionscape items.
---
why not just make bounty hunter a 1250 total world kappa
---
Yea I feel like something needs to change soon, I'm just not sure what. 
---
And thanks my first comment was pretty dismissive though lol, but I appreciate you taking it at face value and turning this into a discussion. I really can't argue against a lot of your points because I totally agree with them, it's just as a PKer I just feel that this might be a fun novelty at first, but in the long run it would be detrimental to PVP.
---
Think I'd rather listen to Dubstep and that's saying a lot
---
It took me 3 tries, I died once before Jad, and once during the Jad fight.
---
I definitely think it’s a lot tougher than other bosses because you have to manage the prayers while aggroing the healers but that is the only difficult part to the fight caves in my opinion. 
---
I also want to fight Jad more to practice the PvM but I haven’t gotten it on task yet lol
---
Is it actually like that I’m from Canada no way I’d ever make it to a rune fest
---
they probably just saw that one old Mr Mammal clip with the venge/claw lure in edgeville
---
pay 50-100k to recover lost items in boss death is practical but tasteless if you want to immerse yourself in the game
---
I am currently doing this
---
why is he so happy in this vid? i wanted to see him suffer. probably one of the weaker episodes
---
You make amazing content dude.
---
That's what obsidian does
---
Wtf why did he remove it
---
Okay now he was close. Tried to domesticate you.
---
We tf2 now bois
---
Same. I learn a lot from other's answers and try to give when I can.
---
But you're an animal, maybe it's in your nature?
---
I was pulling ~40-60k per inventory killing blue dragons.
---
It's up
---
Just gone onto white wolf mountain. Looks like its despawned
---
I counted 16 WBU?
---
nah switch pkers and skillers
---
You don't need to use graceful to skill, you can fashionscape it up regardless. Unless you're doing something like blood rcing which takes nearly 100% run energy per inventory.
---
Wow I just noticed lmao
---
I'd do my master clues for this
---
How was that shield with spikes called?
---
Makes more sense to scale off the GE value of items dropped.
---
I can be quite sceptical at times but fell for this trick. Luckily my bank was worth only 5m. I was way inside the bank but my player ran outside as well. Ice barraged, no telly, high risk no protecting whip, gg.
---
Rushed back and those guys (1 lurer and 1 mager) both 90+ were literally going bank by bank doing this.
---
I banked everything on purpose before since it was high risk but I thought I was safe inside a safe zone. Apparently they knew a way around that.
---
Victim blaming doesn't justify it.
---
what do you want me to do?
---
I have never once split any amount of superiors/dag bones/anything like that and I've clanned for years. There could be 20 of you, you're not splitting that. Maybe some group of 3 or 4 friends would, but I'd you get dropped by a few friends in that gear then idk what to say.
---
If you’re trolling: well done. If you’re not, never use either warhammer to kill monsters or train.
---
The people non skulling in edge arent bringing stuff like that they are bringing claws b ring and torture. Also theyve fixed the problem because you can skip them with no penalty and also they cant unskull now. I just rush them then skip them. Its been fair for awhile now
---
Genos, while your feet after you’re done killing monsters

His content is solid, well put together &amp; entertaining imo. It’s overhyping &amp; tryhard memeing that’s overrated.
---
Bahaha
---
Damn, that jiggle.
---
Don't watch the series if you don't enjoy it. It's very simple.
---
This was from 20 days ago, the post was largely ignored but I encourage you to double check my math. 
---
"Just recently watched the video by SirPugger on the emblem farmers, so out of curiosity went over to the exact same spot, and they are shockingly still there. This leads me to believe that perhaps Jagex doesn’t fully understand the scope of this issue, so here is some math.
---
As provided in the image, at exactly 5 minutes in I had picked up 17 varrock tabs (I cleared the ground before timing, and the bots leave the teleports on the ground, therefore 1 tab = 1 death) I then added up all 9 emblem upgrades and divided by 9 in order to get an average, the average was 550k BH points per upgrade. I then took that point average and converted it into coin value by using Mystic hats, or Annakarl teleports, which yield a .25 coin to point ratio. Meaning that each kill is worth 137,500 gp. Alternatively, you can lock it to the alch value of rune legs at a .20 coin to point ratio. Meaning each kill is worth 110,000 gp guaranteed by alch values.
---
Now for the math, 17 kills per 5 minutes means 204 kills per hour. Which results in either 22.44m or 28.05m depending on if you use alchables or ge value items. Now bearing in mind these accounts are running 24/7, that means they are bringing in at a minimum 538.56m PER DAY, that’s over half a bill every day coming into the game, which is guaranteed due to rune leg alch prices. Keep in mind as well that these numbers are only this one bot farm, there are at least 2 others that are running daily, near the monastery and near the bandit camp telly. Jagex, even if the other two farms are only making half of what this one makes, that is 1Bill entering the game daily, locked behind a guaranteed alch value, they literally cant not make 1Bill if they go unbanned. This is a problem that needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed now.
---
For context, that video was published on the 23rd of April, at these rates that single farm has now made 13.464 Billion, at a minimum."
---
Apparently the black mask reqs 20 str 10 Def and 40 Combat to equip TIL.
---
you can boss at ur stats but there is like no point. better to train your account up before you worry about bossing. at your stats i would only really consider doing barrows.
---
Take my yes
---
While you are entitled to your opinion, you only posted this to get a reaction out of people. On top of that you called them "mindless." I don't understand why you feel the need to troll, but maybe learn to find happiness without trying to upset people.
---
Communism is when you don't like orange man
---
Obsidian is relatively up there, though. This, I'd imagine, is very low on the hierarchy. Maybe around 20-30 in level requirements based on the appearance and original NPCs that wear it.
---
I saw this and still enjoyed the episode. I had been looking him up on the highscores
---
This was from 20 days ago, the post was largely ignored but I encourage you to double check my math.
---
F2P would benefit from this, but I am 99% sure they'd never add something like this to F2P.
---
Way too much of an update tailored to ironmen for my liking.
---
U just jelly and salty haha
---
Pretty sure it was because more so of all of the model ids or something being stolen from a private server and their uncooperativeness in regards to sharing files with jagex.
---
Use mage and attack---&gt;run out of aggro range--&gt;attack--&gt;run out of aggro range, rinse and repeat
---
Also you have like an hour to recover your items when you die so no idea how you lost them
---
I got my quest cape last night! I’m a super rookie when it comes to oven so lost about 2.5mill when killing galvek. 
---
But it was worth it!
---
Recommend using dragon crossbow ruby bolts e and then diamond e when on phase four. Once I had this set up it was easy.
---
You get enough pure essence from slayer/bossing for everything you need. Also, most ironmen will get to ~60 runecrafting without touching the skill, just quests/lamps/tears of guthix.
---
Thank you. Wait until I start recreating lumbridge and other areas ;)
---
Oh god. I would have been so mad at myself in the morning haha.
---
I mean play the game your way and I'm glad your back. But do you mind me asking how in the hell mobile is the only thing carrying your account? Literally the only thing I can do on mobile is woodcut the controls are very frustrating and slow to get anything done. Again nothing wrong with it but why do you like playing on mobile?
---
I was a bit bummed but was only like 3m out of my 18m bank. Oh well
---
NMZ is viable as an afk method at any level. Doesn't cost anything past your first run, buying absorbs with the points you get is self sustaining. 
---
If you can get up to 60 def then using full obby + berserker necklace (~6m total) will give you p much the best xp rate till high 90s stats.
---
I try. I sad 😢
---
Wasn't my intention to be rude at all, and I apologize if I came off as such.
---
What I mean is that the lore implications are generally "soft" in that we are told that the weapon is good, but there is no obvious "realistic" reason for it. You have relatively extreme weapons like fencing daggers with extra large guards which make them very good at their niche, but keris is just a middle eastern dagger. There's no reason it can't be good against bugs in general just because it kills kalphites in a specific way.
---
Again, my point was not to be dismissive, but to say that keris is good against kalphites simply because jagex wanted to make a good weapon to fight kalphites with. The flavor text doesnt mean they can't add scorpion venom (evolved to kill small animals and other bugs) or some kind of insecticide pump to make keris better vs bugs in general.
---
The first trip doesn’t count, you have to unlock the route successfully then fly back to it
---
Isn’t the skill labeled as Attack?
---
My only gp regret is 2 years ago thought I was done with osrs so I gave away 10m to f2pers who replied back to me. Starting out again 11 months ago with no gp sucked big time.

---
Melee sums up Attack, Strength and defence combat styles so Melee would work best
---
1. Magic is really strong at low levels and can be used to safespot/cheese a lot of boss fights. Even 13 magic for fire strike will probably be enough, especially if you can get to 37/40/43 prayer for full nullification of damage from certain attack styles. 
---
2. Haven't watched the video, but looting is alright as a money maker I guess. Low entry req money makers include blast furnace (iron bars), herb runs and killing chaos druids.

3. Equipment tab, then second button from the left

I’m roughly the same level as you, my cmb is 87, my skilling ones are a little off from you though

Sometimes I just do ammonite crabs with a bone crossbow if I keep logging out.
---
Make it like level 20, like +1 per helm top gloves and legs, f2p, with it being a 1/5000 drop from barbarians, add in stronger versions of barbians in the barbarian mess hall, like level 110, give them like a 1/1000 or 1/512 drop rate.
---
were likely going to have the quest done on day 1 or 2 so it will probably be within the week or just a few days after it comes out.
---
Gudetama pet
---
don't forget the 9999 magic level is also to deter you from doing something retarded like thinking 99 magic should be useful anywhere outside of veng/trident/pvp. What kind of fucking retard uses magic or melee for pvm am I right?
---
Drop parties happen when drunk
---
What?
---
How is that nitpicking? Those are 2 items you absolutely cannot get anywhere else, they are unique drops.
---
Make the two options to wear it able to be toggled. That was there are turf wars in the rev cave.
---
It ain’t fun I know. Older games like this are really struggling to get a friendly community again
---
Im doing it as first runescape 99 on my ironman right now xD. Two months at least more let's go boys.
---
Now you're thinking like a jmod
---
You're rephrasing what I said.
---
  
---
Players want to afk play this game = remove random events = ezscape &amp; less socializing.
---
Are you actually implying that social status is pointless? Do you ever think of succeeding in life?
---
I'm discovering new things all the time, I did my first clue scroll, I've been having a lot of fun but I just don't understand this community sometimes. Either way, I'm not gonna quit having fun exploring and shit.
---
Ahh it must be airborne, I've got it too!
---
Yum, and if non-ironman afk nmz is a decent way to get 90+ melee stats in a month.
---
ItS hArD tO fInD BoTs
---
Keep on it! It’ll get rough on some parts but if you find friends to play with or get into fun stock workings it can get pretty interesting
---
Literally this! I've seen people like Rigondeaux do it and be like "doesn't it look so good there on the ground" and I'm like.. well... Yeah until it fucking despawns... Pick it up already!!! 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Might as well play cookie clicker if you're into single player &amp; afk'able grindy games. ; )
---
I don't, I vastly prefer playing on PC because kiting enemies and ticking is much easier, but I'm not downloading OSRS on a work computer. I'd probably have -700 total level right now if not for mobile

 Hi, meet Stankletics, my Runefest locked ultimate ironman. After recently returning from various other conventions I decided to up the ante, and forge my own journey from scratch. No deodorant, no bathing, but this time I can't escape the disgusted looks of my fellow ironmen.
---
Runecrafting.
---
Do you play 10 hours a day?
---
I had to turn off the grie because it felt like my inventory was spazzing out every time I clicked something. But without the grid it still feels great.
---
Are u upset buddy
---
It's a ps4 game where you create anything! (almost like a game engine)
---
What about J1mmy?
---
I was agreeing with you and explaining a bit how even if it's someone who exclusively wants to PK and not play the account past that, it's super low effort to still hit 500 total even while restricted.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You're 69 cb on a pure yet 1753 total. You could easily hit the 500 total within a day with a bit of money starting out.
---
Discussion
---
Seriously, this is so annoying to deal with!

But that gives absolutely no indication on there actually total level

"I feel attacked"
---
which one? none of them have ranged nor magic attacks here.
---
Well Marth's neutral B is called shielbreaker and it has the same animation as fsmash and it also does extra shield damage, similar to how the BGS spec works
---
Yeah it was kinda sad. I maxed and just had 2 friends come. Write some janky msgs and just got my stuff lol
---
Most likely another lesser demon that you didn't see. It wasn't invisible.
---
SKILLERS FIGHT ZALCANO
---
Or, upon moving an item, it goes to the closest box you were trying to put it to. But yeah, the snapping-back to it's original place is really annoying.
---
Try Deranged Archaeologist
---
i think Mr Yogurt (yoghurt?) cc does BA with anyone
---
Lmfaoo
---
it was invisible because the hp bar was over by the bones and I was over at the safe spot area.
---
For fastest xp/ hr rates at 85 ranged I think dhide would be best (void at 90+) and then for weapon msb(i)+rune arrows &gt; mithril darts (roughly 5k/ hr xp loss, worst case) &gt; black salamander (roughly 5k/ hr xp loss from darts).
---
In my opinion, the cost savings by using mith darts is worth the slightly lowered rates.
---
Do a normal rumble with the standard easy bosses.
---
but your next clue will be a pure 100k of profit!
---
Its not possible for an npc to simply "be invisible"
---
Steam runes are underrated. Not that much less xp than lavas and pretty profitable.
---
In favor.
---
"used to hate" bro you only have 6 KC. Grats though
---
Chartreuse animals live in the rainforest
---
yeah, i've only ever done it on task, hence the 6kc from picking 3 both times lol
---
Can confirm, smash tourneys are the epitome of neck beards and B.O.

Got a source for that?

DUDE
---
Didn’t look at the sub I was on, expected to see a totally different name. Got caught a little off guard. 😂
---
Generate Tasks video where you see Swampletics in the Morytania Slayer Tower was uploaded 2 weeks ago. Settled released his new Swampletics 11 hours ago. Swampletics had no reason to be in the slayer tower unless he had 85 slayer. So Generate Task basically gave away the progress that was happening on Swampletics account.
---
doubtful since prayer flicking is not an intended mechanic. Itd be like an npc teaching you to tick manipulate, it doesn't really make sense.
---
Not using inventory tags to highlight money seeds smh
---
Alternatively we could ask that attendees, who are mostly grown fucking adults, take a tiny modicum of responsibility and practice basic hygiene themselves. Taking a shower and applying deodorant is not rocket science. 
---
Why should jagex pander to them by giving out free deodorant? Seriously what the fuck am I reading??
---
Yes, it is, but free-to-play is not even 1% of the full game.
---
Keep in mind OSRS is a desktop game that can be played on mobile, not the other way around. There's a lot of things that are significantly harder to do on mobile. There's literally decades of content here, it's not just some throwaway mobile game that you play for a couple weeks and exhaust content on.
---
You probably lagged and there was a graphical glitch. Or you were in a PVP world
---
Jagex ruined it with the highscores.
---
I'm at 86 Runecrafting right now and I swear I'm never touching another level. I dunno how people can make themselves get 99 RC, let alone 200m XP.
---
Very true, and I've been looking to find a sort of rpg game like RS but I still don't know if I shiuld pay, considering how broke I am. Thank you though
---
Does he restrict himself to not leaving the swamp or is his account literally unable to leave?
---
Ewwww rs3 stuff
---
It got copyright striked and removed by a pk clan. DI (damage inc)
---
Guess they didn't like being exposed.
---
You would think that's stupid, but there are actually large teams who would log on just to kill a suiciding boner. I did 2 hours of prayer at the chaos altar and got killed by a massive team four times in those 2 hours.
---
no it just happened again, I think I know what it was. Sometimes when npc's spawn in there are invisible for a few a little bit but their ai is active so when I walked out to get my drops a lesser demon who was still invisible hit and all I saw was his hp bar when I hit it, or atleast I think that's what happened.
---
Cannon.
---
Dont know why you are getting downvoted, I was easily getting 500k with MA2 orb and burning ammy, with this method and obelisk 600k doesnt sound unreasonable
---
The painfully slow time it takes to heal anything meaningful could be better spent banking and getting more food or using pray/pots or even just better armour (or Sara brews/ restores etc).
---
man its just marth, just shine him off corp
---
I thought he only needed to be in there to get money from gargs for Ivandis flail before 85 slayer
---
All good brotha.
---
Can be explained with shark fin soup, turtle soup (I’ve had it taste like chicken), and swordfish uh idk stick the sword part up your butthole

Enjoy!

That’s hot
---
this is meme abuse, I am reporting your post to the karma authorities.
---
Assuming you haven't selected rigour and not being on a slayer task it does seem correct to me
---
82 is for magic imbue, only 71 is required for zmi tele
---
ironmen do temple treks for bow strings and such
---
Nice! What're you training
---
I’m really enjoying this meme!
---
I’m sure I’ll still feel that way this time next week.
---
Do people want dungeoneering in osrs? I guess it wouldn't be as bad as there isn't as much required shit to grind for like in RS3.
---
Vote no to pvm updates
---
Haha idk why but this cracked me up. I know the feeling of wanting only 3 kills, always choose 3 for callisto😂
---
Congratulations my bro, love this pet :)

What’s the best/easiest/cheapest way to get full rune armor on an Ironman account? I was thinking of buying it with BH emblems but is it against the rules to use my main and my iron to farm emblems? If so is it against the rules to do it with a friend? Or could I just get them through wildy slayer? Buying them from stores is a little pricey

All you post is about clay bots. Not even all bots, specifically clay bots. How much you got in your bank
---
Don't kink-shame!
---
Yeah, I'm not going to be on task, might be able to rigour though. I just expected more damage. Appreciate it. Just glad to know i'm using it right.
---
Also happens quite a few times during the haunted mine boss fight but I don’t remember which episode that was
---
Ok. Good to know. Just seems super slow as I'm getting like 27k/h even though it says I should get about 32.

at what mage level is it worth switching from iban to a trident?

Why do players come up with ideas that jagex should've added 3 years ago? The vanilla client has been so bad for so long

Settled literally said that he was going to be getting a whip in the next episode, and at the time of that video he likely didn't even have the slayer level and was just doing a cameo like he did in By Release.

Depends on how you define success.  I define it by being able to do what I want and have tons of free time instead to do things I enjoy of working my ass off to buy expensive things so others can look at them and think highly of me.  Maybe that's just me, I used to think those things mattered until I nearly died a few years back because of a health problem I still deal with, but my perspective on it has changed.
---
I'm not saying social status is pointless.  I'm saying that it shouldn't be your number one priority.  If having fun in your life by doing things you enjoy (responsibly of course) is lower on your priority list than saving money to buy something that just increases your social status (like the many people I've met who get an expensive mortgage, take out loans to buy a more expensive car they can't really afford, etc.), you might want to think twice

Rsmvs would still be around if YouTube wasn't dicks about taking down videos.

IMO no. Dead drops are fine. Not every kill of every thing needs to be profitable outside of uniques

Ohh I remember that, that's clever as fuck. Thanks :)

I love his bot busting videos. god damn.

That's pretty dope, what about your reddit name? How do you remember that?
---
I'm currently trying to work on as many of the early game diaries as I can, and have been looking at the Desert medium tasks. There is one for teleporting to the desert house portal using a redirected teleport tablet.
---
The Wiki says that I need a scroll of redirection, which looks like it's from Nightmare Zone? How difficult is this? I'm currently level 46. I have done enough bosses so far to be able to do it (Tree Spirit, Tanglefoot, Black Demon, Ithoi the Navigator, and Khazard Warlord) but I am confused as to how it all works. It seems to be geared much more towards higher level players. Do I just go and fight them one at a time?
---
Is it better to try and grind stuff out now while I still have fairly easy bosses, or should I wait until I am higher level?
---
Yeah that's expensive

We're talking about grown **adults** here. Chances are they already know what deodorant is and just can't be bothered. Some people are just disgusting mongs who can't be helped, I've lived with several people like this and can tell you that from first hand experience.
---
If I had my way with things like this they would be turned away at the doors, otherwise they'll just go through life with everyone politely enduring them.
---
I had an old account that was also Morse code that meant something, this one thiugh is just random gibberish. I couldn't think of any message to put there. 
---
It's pretty easy to remember actually, it's very rhythmic in its "randomness"
---
It depends on what someone is looking for in a subreddit I suppose.
---
Personally, I visit game subreddits for general discussions about the game, artwork, a few memes, and to engage with others about mechanics I like or don't like. I don't care for toxicity. This subreddit is the furthest thing from that for me, and most things outside of the status quo are met with toxic responses and downvotes. It's disappointing to me. This thread alone is a pretty decent minimal example (thread downvoted to a large ratio, top comment has a response with a toxic response).
---
FFXIV's subreddit is one of the best subreddits for a game I've seen. Memes are (mostly) limited to a megathread, there isn't overall toxicity (I don't see deleted posts so I'm guessing it's just non-existent for the most part), and the rules they have written in the sidebar are enforced, mostly anyway. Basically, there's more game discussion posts overall than shitposts, and disagreements are discussed with some civility. And if I do want to take part in shitposts, the community even has a largely-known subreddit just for that.
---
I rather jagex make the decisions than the shit community that added nmz, all the qol garbage, the GE etc. I really hope jagex gets rid of polling eventually

Man I saw that same guy at the GE showing off what he claimed was “hard work” and it was only loot from 60 vork kills and continued to claim everybody bought their accounts lmao

I'm level 64 RC and getting 35kp/h. Have you got all of your bank fillers on? Also are you using your essence on a player to follow him to the altar?

---
He restricts himself.
---
They keep adding things like this and eventually there will be no fun left. Half the reason PVP is enjoyable is because it can be unpredictable. The mechanics don't have to be lure friendly but the game will be super boring if the only fights you get involve consenting in a safe zone first. This is a sandbox MMO--updates like these constitute nannying in my eyes and that sort of stuff will hurt the game, not help.
---
The fangs in it would be dropped with some small amount of gp I think
---
Arguably, yes. If you're setting records. [Trance_Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEchMYaFWsU) knows all about that.
---
Most damage done sounds like the worst measure for a winner I’ve ever heard. This idea is dog shit.
---
Optimal quest path is fine for progression. Do some slayer and other training on the side. You'll get to the point where you veer off the guide and want to just get your barrows gloves, fire cape, full void etc. Maybe learn barrows to start. 
---
Unlock fairy rings when you can for some useful tele's.

Adults were kids once, being raised by someone else. Not everyone had good parents. If you didn't have parents that taught you to keep yourself clean and forced you to do it day after day if you didn't want to, there's a pretty good chance you won't care about it as an adult. Turning 18 doesn't magically make you know everything you are supposed to do. If their parents didn't teach them, someone else has to.

One dude with bunnyears was willing to teach me and like two other randoms how to get these ears. It took a while to persuade him. But eventually he gave in. He said you had to change your password to "bunnyear746" or something like that. But he gave the password a little differently a few times, so there was a communication error. Anyways, he never logged my acc so he must've been confused over what password to give lol.
---
I also wrote my password on a website. I just had to tick off which dragon items I wanted on my account, type in my acc info and click "HACK!" The guy behind it must've forgotten about his site, as I was never logged.
---
Wow
---
You don't need training wheels to click and drag items properly. Just learn the distance between each inventory spot..muscle memory.
---
Keeps it in tight after multiple uses
---
Indeed, cuz half the sub does apparently relate to this post lmao
---
Hey, if you want we can add each other but never speak to each other again
---
True. And Jagex's stance is to ban them a few days after being detected, by which time they've reached 70+ thieving and made over 5m per account and transferred them over.
---
People say Jagex's bot detection is effective, but it's obviously not if botters are still thinking it's worthwhile doing this - they're still benefiting at the end of the day (despite the bans) which encourages them to continue botting.
---
I mean it's all rng, I agree damage might not be the best factor, but it's just one that you can quantify, and players can effectively make it less likely to take damage based on what they are doing (pray switches, tank armor) 
---
What do you think it should be based on.
---
Ive never had a 99 party and am almost maxed on both games, looking at this makes me a bit sad like I've missed out. I just dont see why anyone would want to come lol
---
I don’t think it should be based on anything. I think this idea would be worse than DMM
---
This bully-sub can relate huh?
---
This comment is for "I don't care about Swampletics" Gang.
---
It will be downvoted into oblivion, but it's here incase you feel like your opinion isn't represented.
---
What made you choose that spot to get the 99?
---
We take turns.
---
Without skilling you can't pvm and pvp
---
Gz bud, just got mine and my first fire cape the other day as well, feels good.
---
This isn't about specifically you. There are other people too :D
---
Cox really took all the good elements of dungeoneering, removed the unnecessary skilling and improved boss complexity. I really dont see feature from dung that is really missing..
---
Appreciate the reply, will give it a try. Thank you
---
Makes sense, will give it a try. Is it the .net site?
---
Where does the link lead to?
---
Lmao I care gg keep it up
---
I am so glad that he is in no rush to get the episode out, you can tell he cares so much about the quality of the video rather than trying to upload every 2-3 weeks. This video was worth the wait. I hope episode 20 will be just as good.
---
Not massively surprised, was bound to happen sooner or later. Why would you have to sign an NDA that only lasts 6 months though?
---
Most Asians don't need deodorant if they bathe regularly. That's why westerners have such a hard time finding deodorant when they travel to Asia. However, everyone will smell like garbage if they stop bathing.
---
I used a bastion potion when I did vork, but a range and sup def pot would be the same just i wanted to have an extra shark :p
---
Also i always anti fired at the lunar isle bank then grabbed another shark then got kicked out straight to relleka. Also used elite void but i don't think that gives extra defence bonuses, it does extra dmg though. Managed 4-7 constant kills/trip, usually tele at 6 though so I have space for the loots :) 
---
Good luck, I'm sure you'll begin to get more and more kills per trip :p
---
Interesting, I can say for sure that I will be gone again the same second as microtransactions are added.
---
Yes I know there are bonds, but this is different. Bonds don't buy you xp directly and everything.
---
I can see this being my new afk place when I want to get some prayer/crafting/gp
---
I will not be clicking to find out
---
Go on, git
---
Appreciate the tip. I have not thought much about that before but I'll keep it in mind and see if improve.
---
Yup that's the one!
---
I want what he's smoking
---
We were asked to fill out some forms and questionnaires before we went in and an NDA was apart of it. We weren't allowed in the workshop if we didn't sign it. As for Jagex's reasoning, idk other than they didnt want people talking about it for a while.
---
Nope. You'll need 94 mage to really PK without being on the disadvantaged side, for the majority of your pvp encounters.
---
There are some seriously big logical errors in his math.
---
It's the same with the emote 'Hypermobile Drinker'. The character just randomly twists his arms and grabs a random drink out of his ass.

no, just no life

No if you never click on the links, treat it as spam

---
Okay, so where's the actual comment? You just said you're speaking on behalf of a group but then never actually said anything.
---
It's not their fault, they spent the whole morning in the motherlode mine on their phones, of course they're going to stink.
---
3 runners + 1 alt
---
Didn't know runefest was a smash event simulation...
---
I think it's a social thing. Like, if your activities are highly antisocial and your primary social interactions take place online, then you don't get the same social peer pressure which demands you to take care of your looks and hygiene. Thus, you have ugly stinky nerds.
---
The best thing that ever happened to my personal hygiene was to start dating someone.
---
Tell that to my Computer Science lectures
---
Gz!
---
Yes. We don't get body odor unless we build up sweat and gunk over hours and hours. Like, I can work up a sweat at the gym or on my bike and I'll be fine, but I should definitely shower after the workout because it'll start to stink over the course of the next few hours.
---
Better advice: Focus on yourself and not on women.
---
Again, a problem with nerds not showering regularly, not the lack of deodorant. And of course, there are exceptions to the rule.
---
But the OSRS mobile app does not natively support mouse and keyboard inputs.
---
We need a bot busting stream from Jagex. The last one was like 3 years ago?

Better to savor the moment tbh. Even if it despawned he could easily get it again, albeit a waste of time.

Go to draynor in world 2 or so

Contact RuneScape customer supporBWAHAHAHAHAAAA😂

I'm well aware

As I think we established earlier, extra 300 total levels isn't 2 hours of skilling.

But seriously best of luck

You don't want to be higher combat with 10 hp if your goal is to hunt black chins. At higher levels people have more gear to one hit you.
---
does that work? i tweeted jagex support, mod ash and weath
---
I would like to see your irl runecrafting gainz next time
---
How the hell? That's awesome but why the hell is the bot coded to type that into the game chat? So weird.
---
Hahaha that's literally the one I use. I've always had a sweat problem so I always used it. Started running and going to the gym a few years back and it helped, but still these clinical deodorants save my ass
---
Magic is abit costly, i would encourage melee.
---
Hard mode = higher hp and defense but much more points.
---
Then you will love Rendi
---
No, it's legitimate and they used to send it to me as well. That's unless your RS username isn't on there, then it could be a fake version.
---
You can also hover your cursor over the Play Runescape button and look bottom left of the Chrome browser to see what link it would load. If it was a phisher then it show a random dodgy site.

I meant a daemonheim themed raid that works like existing OSRS raids.
---
Don't beat me Dad
---
Then i can't say, have a bit higher defensive stats myself, 98 range with addy diamonds and rubys, dhide boots and normal dfs. I average 4-5kc a trip
---
Apparently this is too complicated for you. It’s a raid like the other ones in OSRS except it is daemonheim themed
---
You're contributing nothing relevant to the conversation. If you don't like something down vote or scroll along, no need to voice your opinion.

mojo jojo?
---
:( what is the best way? tweet them? ive never done this before
---
a good portion of our updates came from rs3. Im just suggesting a raid that is themed like a location that i thought was pretty cool, but everyone seems convinced i mean “give Dungeoneering”. It’s embarassing how noone can put that together

sad but true, runescape is a easy escape/coping mechanism for depression/other issues.

1/104k is wrong though.

It's not our fault we suck ;)

Looks like your training agility bro.
---
May I ask what the mage arena 2 locator can be used for when training prayer? I dropped mine after getting the upgraded cape .-.
---
I know korasi was used for anti-rushing back in the day (although pkers these days are better) but as someone who used it a fair bit, what's even strong about it? It's max hit was lackluster and took like 60% spec bar. It was cool, but I'm pretty sure it only worked because it combined with the ring that allowed you to steal special attacks. If I'm wrong, please correct me. I'm well aware that I might be missing some detail here.
---
Just FYI the Ferrari F14-T was as fast as a varrock locked osrs uim mining and smithing pure getting 99 in both skills..

if jagex knew the exact number of bots, then we would not have the problem.

stop falling for PR talk. nobody knows the exact number and you can only change my mind once i see every single bot removed from the game. otherwise i doubt jagex can even identify all different types of bots.

preposterous.

Barrows armor is the best tuned gear for midlevel pvm on this game. It's very well balanced, but, I still want to see a Torag's rework and some fixing done to Karil's.
---
World lag is not dangerous btw

Neither.
---
Throw in potato cactus and fruit trees.
---
This is exactly how I felt! Although my first was 99 cooking. Fast forward a few months and I now have 4 99’s. Keep up the good work bro! Looking forward to seeing your next 99 here shortly; the first one is the hardest (at least in my experience)
---
I never knew this was a thing till I went to Twitchcon 16. I got a little bag when I got my badge and it had little things in it like deodorant sticks. I was confused. But I understood why soon after.

You need 50 mining to get to her lair but she's very easy to safespot, just start casting fire strike and afk until she dies. 43 prayer also makes the fight trivial
---
Big DY. I will forever cherish the moment he answered my question in his Q&amp;A
---
As they're untradeable, you need to be the one to kill the ice Queen. Might be worth getting 43 prayer so you can just run through and take no damage with overheads, or just waiting a bit to up your combat. 
---
What do you need them for at low combat? Questing?
---
It is an intended mechanic now that content is designed around it (inferno). Makes no sense to keep it a secret if they have settled on never removing it and making content that needs it.
---
Damn I thought I had you beat then I checked it out and my best was 208. Very nice.
---
Notice how it shrinks. Gielinor is very technologically advanced.
---
Is the boss poisonous? Deadly Red Spiders are not so the Temple Spiders probably wouldn't be, but a unique based around poison would make sense from a spider boss.
---
For example, perhaps a new dagger that is already poisoned (say level 65-70). Or maybe it could just be a variant of the Dragon Dagger, either cosmetically or slightly better like Rune Scim to Brine Sabre. I'd lean more towards something like a Level 65 Dagger with higher base stats than a DDS and a Special Effect (and/or Attack) based around poisoning. Special Attack could even be something like the Magic Longbow where it never misses but also will always poison target if possible; perhaps the poison could even be a bit stronger than Weapon poison(++) and start with 7 or even 8 but drop off quicker (e.g. instead of 4 hits before reducing damage it could do 1x 8, 1x7, then 2x 6, 4x 5, etc).

Haven't seen endgame, but infinity war was fucking trash so I have no desire to. I most definitely will not pay to see it.

That's what I was thinking. Torag's is pretty lame but I can't think of a single PvP or PvM where Karil's set effect w/out ammy of damned is useful in any way, shape, or form.
---
Interesting video on related subject for those interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Rp-uo6HmI

If you wanna find potions, type "Poti" that should give you your desired results. It's about making the items easier to find, which you actually try to buy.

Want a prayer pot, try prayer.

Want super combat, try combat.
---
Want antifire, try antifire.

Want a pot (that one made of clay), type pot.

And so on... But the last one is not as simple as thought.

When making wines does the success rate change when you would get a level, or only when you stop and let them ferment? e.g. if I'm making wines at level 50, should I intentionally stop sometimes to let the wine ferment so that I level and my success chance goes up, or is it fine to do loads at a time? Sorry, it's hard to explain.

If you're looking for the quickest avenue to be able to do the Ice Queen kill, just get 43 prayer. It's a bit of cash but the leveling is *super* quick if you use Dragon bones in a PoH on w330, like maybe an hour. If your other combat stats are low it'll take you a while but keeping yourself alive is what matters. 
---
I would maybe suggest focusing on upping your combat a little before though, but it's not necessary.
---
I can't see the original post so don't know what you suggested but I think the only way to flush out the bots would be to charge a very small fee (like 1¢ or so) already at new account creation.
---
some lore expansion on the Kinshra would be cool
---
I was also thinking about tit yesterday
---
Probably because you didn't have the capes of the one true God, Bandos.
---
Is this canon?
---
I know there has been discussion about it before, but we could bring back elite black knight armor and give it similar bonuses.
---
Orange starburst are the worst
---
I never went to Runefest and don't intend to go any time soon
---
Is the smell really that bad or are we meming?
---
I'm certain that typing POT makes POT come up my dude.
---
Grown adults who sit there watching numbers go up on a 15 year old game. They not normal.
---
Torag: my defence goes up when my hp drops
---
The best part is that someone had to make this animation. easily could be changed to around your pocket area, but nope picking dingleberries it is.
---
Impressive!
---
Everyone uses restores anyway.
---
I bet you can store a ton of longbows in there.
---
don't worry the original post wasn't worth reading.
---
You can calc wharever you need.
---
4 melee/range exp = 1.33hp exp = 1 slayer exp
---
Cannoning: 2 range exp = 0 hp exp = 1 slayer exp
---
Magic works a little differant, never bothered finding out how it works because i didnt do much magic
---
Avoid barraging nechreals because you get alot of exp from the minions
---
Doing tasks in the slayer tower will grant you bonus slayer exp, 1.25hp exp for every slayer exp with the hard diary
---
Does he help out with Framed and J1mmys stuff too? Because I swear they are done by the same person.
---
I'm not complaining, I love all their stuff, jw.
---
Agreed, that'd be nice, though I imagine we won't see that happening for a good while.
---
They’re all good none are bad wtf
---
Support
---
I mean, considering the amount of time and effort raids take to complete, not to mention its endgame content, getting saltpetre is like a slap in the face 
---
Same goes with cerb droppping 50 noted ashes. A lvl 93 slayer boss drops a 1k drop.
---
What's the best way to teleport to the farming guild if I am an noobish ironman?
---
Thanks. I guess I need to get that hard diary done
---
I waterboarded the chief voting engineer of the farm, starved and savagely beat him for days upon end, then dismembered him with an axe, you won’t believe what I did with the body parts
---
It's almost like people have different opinions about whats fun and not, so weird.
---
It’s better than a bgs because its one handed so you don’t need to juggle food. Getting kc with a tentacle is a waste of gp.
---
Win win scenario
---
You’re doing amazing sweetie
---
Ill be at the 99 party, rocking the same sexy cape, cant wait
---
Suicide to corp
---
At the price eclectics are right now you'll only lose a little bit at worst, and will most likely profit if you can do masters too. And this is assuming you don't even get rangers.
---
If you set a homeworld in runelite you can just use the same world always
---
Get killed by a monster or wait 10/20mins.
---
Lumby caves without a light source is one quick method. Or die to a dragon in POH.
---
This changes everything !
---
If you’re at the point of doing cerb, I wouldn’t classify ash being “really good”. Yiu should be using your tarromins on tar from zulrah anyway.
---
By the time you're in third gear.
---
25 buttholes has a good video where he finds those mass f2p GE mimic bots and finds out they also obey any typed commands in chat.
---
He used commands like "attack guard"  and they'd all do it, and he ended up bringing the. Into the wildy and having them attack players. 
---
Anyway, I'm guessing this is one of those bots, and another player simply typed out the message they're saying, causing them to repeat it.
---
He was talking about having to do islands and not liking them, and they are 100% capped. 
---
And congratulations, after jumping into a conversation guns blazing, you’ve caught up to the actual point being made, which is that grind isn’t hard, which he was trying to insinuate it was. 
---
Proud of you, bud.
---
I just want the armour to be reskinned initiate, honestly. White and gold doesn't match in a lot of gear setups.
---
meme made by torag merchers
---
Swampletics PERFECTLY summed up
---
I want it. I don’t necessarily want chaotically the same as they were or at all. I think they could take a second swing at it knowing how it affected RuneScape the first time around.
---
It'd be interesting to see one-room dungeons with only a dragon added to the POH meta.
---
What's your metric? 1850 total easily means he has access/potential to do any content in the game, meaning he can do whatever he wants and likes to do. If it's competitive ehp then I would agree with you, it's not a good account. But the people I usually see grinding efficiency either stream for a living (i.e. it's their job to play OSRS) or don't do anything else. I read 1850 total as a guy who likes to play OSRS, probably has a job, family, other hobbies, etc. That's the behavior I want to encourage, not the people shitting themselves in the basement to get 2nd place smithing exp in a day.
---
So make them lvl 9001 and only deagro after total lvl is at least 2276 and if wearing questcape
---
Only helps if you died in that world. Which won't be the case if you've hopped at any point during your session.
---
6k per tree per run.
---
Cactus are usually around 9k per plant per run.
---
this same exact thing happened to me at mith dragons this morning. Runelite crashes a LOT for me. Nobody in my CC seems to have this problem. Sounds like its just you and I.
---
tumble tier response
---
I'll talk that way about anyone who disses the best swamp based entertainment since Shrek.
---
I mean, instead of it being Saradomin, its Zamorak. EZ
---
It’s not just the player base, it’s everyone. Depression and anxiety are the trendy new personality quirks and people base their identities around it.
---
Why would you do skilling on a pure? They're just used as pvp alts.
---
neckbeards are the ones who spend 10x the time playing the game doing slow ass methods lmao
---
Lmfao, getting skill levels doesn't effect a PvP account at all. It's not like it's forcing you to train combat skills. Level fishing and cooking for food for pking, maybe her lore for potions. There you go. Takes 1 day to get 500 total level.
---
Gorillas are kind of a boss
---
Idk why you’re downvoted. 
---
While nothing is as good as Ash... 
---
Lynx Titan certainly maxed well before everyone else. 
---
Ok after typing it out it does still suck but be nice to OP.
---
Keep using dhide, you bring both bgloves and torm
---
Osrs wiki is your friend
---
Just take my fuckin upvote and leave dude
---
Fourteen million seven hundred &amp; eighty nine thousand runecrafting experience.
---
Haha the grind barely started! Nice 16 meds for rangers
---
It seems to be someone making bots to advertise how broken botting is to get the community outraged / get jagex to take action. The hero we all need.
---
Medium clues are totally efficient if you are grinding out Ranger Boots. Especially if you get above average RNG and have a good inventory and house set up.
---
Look me up on CrystalMathLabs IGN Based Deng.
---
I can't afford runners (they cost like 1b to get to 99). I'm just unemployed and had nothing else better to do than RC 8 hours a day lol
---
I actually run ess for jase and it's about 50-65 gp per exp with astrals depending on the price. So about 10-12b assuming using an alt. You make a lot back in the runes.
---
That's what he's suggesting though. You can ban a million accounts but they will just make more unless you solve the actual issue.
---
Great job finally some mid level content I’ve been waiting for!
---
they need to remove the wildy asect of it and move everything into a more contorlled environment, like an Arena.
---
It is obvious that people will continue to do stuff like this when the wildy is the only real pvp scene that rewards.
---
Remove bountry hunter, introduce arena style ELO ranking colliseum with random matchmaking based on ranks.
---
Maybe if jamflox wasn't so obsessed with making the wildy the main pvp scene this kind of shit wouldn't be an issue. You would also have more pvmers upvoting pvp shit because the pvp meta won't be to feast on non pvpers anymore.
---
Just make it an ornament kit from clues or something. 
---
White knight questline is both too established and still unfinished to introduce a new series or faction. Plus, we already have to murder 1300 black knights for fally elite, so I don't think it's a great idea for us to suddenly switch sides in the 'canon.'
---
thanks matey
---
This IS NOT the bounty hunter farmer lol. This is just a guy who just generally fucks around with his bots in f2p mass spamming mass emoting and mass making penis's.
---
Wow dude what an original idea i bet no one has thought of this
---
You're missing the point entirely.  It multiplies the time it takes to set up these accounts, especially when you're doing it repeatedly, and it feels pointless.  Like, I have to grind through this gameplay I have zero interest in just so that a bot has to do so mindlessly and easily as well?  If it's a minimal amount of work for a player, then it's even less so for a bot.
---
Do people still play CoH? That game was so fun just cheesing it around with super speed lol
---
Ah yeah, 13m xp in a little bit more than a month. Nice
---
Lmfao leave it to the OSRS community to find a way to bitch about a month of free membership. Jagex can do no good here. They give away free membership, people cry about it because some asshole is taking advantage of something.
---
Tbh the ornate set scratched that itch for me cosmetically. And Veracs scratches the itch stat wise
---
Whenever I do a rogues den run, I usually fail the wall safe and get restarted. However, I see that people can open multiple per run? How???
---
did they say anything about a team minigame like soul wars?
---
Because you haven’t seen it happen to yourself neither have you look deep enough into yourself
---
Mm2 monkeys will be better xp and drop p pots so you don't have to leave. Nechs will be slightly less xp but will also offset the cost a lot in alchables and runes.
---
No, its because you made an idiotic statement
---
&gt;!H!&lt;
---
nej, du hora
---
This is what I mean.  You just resent the implication that anyone might not want to play a bland, homogenous main account like we all did back in the day.  I don't pk, but my only interest in the game now is if I'm making a specialist build.  I have zero interest in questing or skilling outside of one skill I like -- firemaking -- just because getting the cape would be nostalgic from my childhood.
---
When you're being entitled about how other people SHOULD enjoy the game the way you do, then you're acting like 2012 Jagex, a shitty, tyrannical dev that insists on what the players actually want, against their will.  And "anyone who doesn't like it can quit."  
---
One of the greatest markers of a good game is rewarding incredibly diverse playstyles.  That's always been one of Runescape's strengths, with skillers, PvMers, PvPers, Questers, etc.  Stop resenting people for not making their account a completely un-noteworthy, homogenous blob of everything just because you've decided to.
---
You could stream your pc to your phone and a kb/mouse would work. Not the best setup as the screen can be a little small depending on your phone. Just a option
---
The ornate armor from the clue hunt 2 look sort of like black elite armor
---
Do limps (with ultra) and yanillian hops (pay for these - noted tomato baskets).
---
The hops especially are a good bit of extra cash. Like anywhere from 50k-100k net profit per run. Limps are about 30k profit if you get decent yields.
---
Seeds for both are dirt cheap, so if you can spend the extra 5-10 mins to incorporate them into your farm runs its easy money.
---
Make sure you're doing birdhouse runs as well.
---
Yup,  his interaction with alexander the great
---
Put them in Lumbridge courtyard, stop them at the source!

you dont have to make new email addresses, you can just use your name@gmail.com for multiple accounts like so:

-	etc.

It all redirects to the same e-mail but you can register new accounts with it.

Lol. What ppl do for money

Yes.
---
Thanks very much for the reply! I have been trying to do this while at my job where I don't believe I have played from before, so that's the issue with the IP/ISP, if it will help to do it now I can do another form from home? Also   the old email address I believe was an AOL email address that I can no longer access as they deactivated/deleted the account due to inactivity. The email I'm trying to use is the one I've been using for my current billing membership and have been using for quite some time. Once again I appreciate your reply! Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help. 
---
Thanks.
---
How does this animation enter the game
---
I got 40k ess there on my btw so did at least 80 treks
---
So do you only go during non-peak hours or do pkers not really go there anymore
---
OSRS doesn't have any Lore yet.
---
Yeah it's on Jimmy's channel
---
Like this idea. Hope it can gain some traction. Draynor village is crazy right now.
---
This video is massively incorrect. The guy can’t even pronounce guthix correctly for fucks sake

Isn't agility like 200k/h with boots you can buy and charge with some kind of feathers?
---
I mean, if you are going to troll this is probably one of the least harmful places to do it.
---
The longer it takes the harder it is to make it profitable and the more they try to bruteforce it the easier it becomes to recognize the pattern.
---
Yikes.
---
I know the other comment said the opposite but you should absolutely buy a bgs before a bludgeon. From what I know it’s almost not worth blowpiping vork without a bgs
---
Yeah, work towards better bot detection software. The names all follow the same pattern, the bots all follow the same pattern. Or we could just put manpower towards things like warding.
---
It was a bad idea in my opinion.
---
?
---
herbs and birds every hour and a half while I'm at work to add some cash passively, what's wrong with that?
---
I had this problem too when I completed fremmy diary, think you need to go through a specific order in the dialogue.
---
hows your stack looking?
---
"but Bubbie, capt`n said I had to!"
---
Yeah. But since the quests are made how about one where you get to see the black knights viewpoint and how the white knights keep fucking with them, how they are freedom fighters and the white knights are imperialist monarchist pigs representing Britain in the runescape world.
---
Yeah, first time that happened when I ran barrows on mobile, it made me jump a bit. Zoomed all the way in and Guthan decided to spook me.
---
I'd love some armor with negative prayer and positive accuracy or something like that would be another cool thing that wouldn't hurt the game much.
---
I'm gnot a gnelf
---
When I talk to him he says go back to work and then I have options of what or okay
---
Same here, not even max QP :/
---
how'd you get your toaster to record the screen?

Regular people don't use slayer alts though
---

---
Just a meme

This subreddit in a nutshell.

Or just allow rwt and charge a small fee for every new account.

Bots gone, Venezuelans/lazy gold buyers happy.
---
something like that yes definitely
---
I used to get 99s at that exact spot in pre-EOC, this post brings me back fam
---
Doing Venenatis today for the first time. Watched a couple of guides and I'm overall familiar with what I need to do. The struggle I'm having is the first kill, where he is already spawned and roaming around. I can't seem to get the safespot method to work then. After I kill him one time and start fresh from a new spawn, I have no issue.
---
Is there anyway I can get the sfaespot method to work initially or do I just need to brute force it and kill/tank it?
---
Wow you’re an ass
---
Your mother
---
Stake that tbow before you hang yourself noob
---
Clan Chats boi.
---
That's asking too much
---
Ah yea no doubt straight double speccing is nooby. Although I'll admit I double DDS spec on my pure quite often. People have just gotten so much into the habit of praying range after the first spec that stepping back then speccing again hits off pray more than half the time.
---
Nmz reee
---
Honestly people going for 4.6 bill xp are either quite rich in real life and buy bonds  or have alts funding their main with a buttload of money anyways.
---
20bil for 200m rc doesn't sound that expensive when you think about how much time it saves doing it all alone.
---
Doing solo wintertodt on my HCIM got me to 56 construction at only about 85 firemaking. This is from level one. If I we're smarter I would have got some logs and built some chairs but realistically wintertodt is ez construction xp if you're doing solo.
---
makes no sense. initiate is holy armour of saradomin. zamorak is unholy and black knights are unholy because theyre followers. holy armour for unholy knights makes no sense
---
The plan is to do watermelons for ultra compost. I should have mentioned I’m doing this purely for money the xp is not important.
---
So close!
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Incredible!
---
Not necessary to tie it to warding.
---
Thanks, really caught me off guard. Was hunting for pages
---
just beacuse you're a 20 def pure doesnt mean 20 def cosmetics should be added to the game that make no sense lol
---
I know but some clan chats don't care to add others, i tried with a few differnt ones.
---
Awesome! I can be a tank for you... adding you now
---
Probably made bank off his merch as well. Seems to have been very successful.
---
Yeah, blowpipe was out of my price range, but the extra prayer and defense stats from the ancient shield are pretty nice.
---
Woah where did you unnearth this meme?
---
I guess you don’t pk a lot, this would make it harder to kill people at 44s/kbd
---
Wait since when is Karil's set effect no longer that it drains agility
---
Yuou can fuck up your code and cause it to be implemented where it shouldn't have been. 
---
Source: write code
---
I was only joking about filling Hosidius with slayer content, this is gonna be a hard no from me.

He got hacked

Maybe? Ranarrs will go up too, ya'know

Lmfao not my birthday 😂

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dream
---
&gt;Dream stacks additively, rather than multiplicatively, with other regenerative effects such as Rapid Heal and the regen bracelet. For example, a player who casts Dream with Rapid Heal on will regenerate 5 hitpoints per minute (3 hitpoints per minute from Dream plus 2 hitpoints per minute from Rapid Heal).
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hitpoints_cape
---
&gt;This does not stack with the Rapid Heal prayer, but does stack with the Regen bracelet to regenerate 4 hp per minute.
---
Wiki doesn't seem to say if you can stack cape with dream spell or all three together, but I would assume that you can for 4 or 7 hp/minute respectively.
---
Making everything an ornament kit or a treasure trail reward or both isn't good game design or concept or idea in general.
---
I think most Osrs players would have a stroke if they don't mention how much RS3 sucks every hour or so.
---
its not the best content, its content thats easily botted and when an army is at it floods the economy. nerfing this method would just shaft legit players. requiring something before doing the content solves the problem without fucking the loyal players.
---
Ahh, thanks. My RC is a whopping 23 at the moment
---
Nope.
---
Ehh, i feel like this is so cliched and common in every piece of fantasy now that I’d prefer if the black knights were just evil for the hell of it
---
No it's on your end most likely
---
Make sure your using good ping worlds
---
Threatening us with quitting doesn't make your problems more important dude.
---
It’s my camera back so it’s pin from an show I’ve to, the right of it is matching carpets
---
Well this won't be the first time I've lied  on a resume then... thanks anyway, lmao.
---
That’s pretty terrible advice to give for someone that hasn’t hit the mid-game on their acc yet.
---
Only if my character can be polyamorous. Gotta spend all this gp on _something_.
---
Pink is definitely the worst starburst

Looks like a 3D render

Shouldn't Poison spiders be west of the greater demons? Wat
---
People like orange more than lemon? Buncha fukin savages
---
Yeah i was assuming you don't need money but wanted to make sure.
---
i don't suggest doing afk slow methods for buyables. i think you should  probably do agility hunter and mining while alting and get out and hard focus on maxing. i don't suggest wt because its kinda annoying and unpredictable when you need to click, compared to ardy which is the same clicks no matter what.
---
don't do rc last 200k an hour is fast for rc but its slow for a buyable and it'll drag especially since you have to depend on other people to gain xp.
---
Of course it isnt a priority, they know that the rwt market actually helps keep this game afloat. With osrs having a solid market for rsgp, people will continue to play it. If you severely kill that market, osrs would fade out much faster.
---
its your own shiternet, dont blame jagex, you’re the only one having problems.
---
The vocals in that sound are horrific. The band overall is pretty good. What's the name?
---
Wtf is this stupid ass shit? I can't tell if you're being purposely obtuse or if you actually want to spout your nonsense that badly that you're willing to ignore what somebody is saying entirely.
---
He's saying to release a raid with a dungeoneering theme, i.e. aesthetics, monsters, possibly mechanics, etc., not a full port of dungeoneering. I don't think you understand what copy past or theme means??? I can make a subway themed restaurant without setting up a fucking rail system and a passenger train.
---
Fucks sake the 'REE IT EXISTS IN RS3' crowd is really turning the turbo autism this thread
---
DAIRY RINGS
---
Oh fuck this was NOT where I was expecting to be attacked :(
---
Hello Officer, yes this post right here.
---
never put your login credentials anywhere other than the actual log in screen, and of course the official site for rs.
---
I use ultimate strength &amp; reflexes for the first 33% and blowpipe for the mage and don't usually have trouble with resetting. After that I can usually just kill them with piety as normal and tbow if its safe.
---
I have had instances where my first hit doesn't seem to pass the 33% but they still reset. This seems like a bug or Runelite isn't displaying the hp % correctly.
---
Vanguards definitely are the most difficult room for solos, but that being said I wouldn't want to see them be made easier. They've already changed them once before from the 25% thresholds to 33% thresholds. The whole point of the room is to not reset them, that's what makes the room challenging. If they're made easier, then the whole reset mechanic is lost. You would just go in and mindlessly kill them all without having to worry about it. 
---
I do think It would be fine to make them always drop an overload, and It would even make more layouts (shaman, vasa, vanguard or other variations) viable for no prep which would be nice
---
Doesn't really do anything to combat botting though, Jagex have used this method in the past and it's evidently unsuccessful.
---
1) Baba Yaga's store requires multiple quests including Lunar Diplomacy (a more advanced quest than FTP1) - still camped with armies of bots hopping around.
---
2) Magic Guild store requires Hand in the Sand - still armies of bots keeping all stock on lockdown.
---
3) Zaff's Superior Staffs requires What Lies Below - Battlestaves are still eternally empty due to all the bots abusing the store.
---
4) Box traps require partial completion of Eagle's Peak - yet you still need to compete with bots at every single red chinchompa spot outside of the diary cave.
---
Wheres my Maplestory :cc
---
Is there a rule of thumb for when I should protection pray vs tank gear slayer tasks?
---
I used to always protect pray in proselyte but as my stats have gone up this might be different. I cannon + melee most task so I can afk. If I get a bursting task I switch to something else afk till I have more attention.
---
Stats:
---
Attack and Defense: 83
---
Strength: 94
---
Prayer: 70
---
Slayer: 74
---
Also, in general I'm just trying to raise my Slayer level so any tips are appreciated. Is it worth farming slayer points so I can skip more tasks? etc.
---
Engine work
---
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Uhg you're dreadful
---
Not sure when i asked you're dumbass achievements in rs3. 
---
You won't be getting the same content you play in rs3 on osrs. So shut the fuck up 🤪
---
Sounds like a bitch to program for too little gain. Afaik there's nothing in the game that alters an already printed chat box message based on an action you do at an arbitrary point afterwards.
---
Not rude at all, you can learn how to raid only dying a couple of times per raid instead of constantly going in and suicide bombing the team points. You suggesting he scams the people teaching him is rude
---
Very useful cape with 1 att str
---
Probably.. there are tons of people who bot nmz and spend 10-30m nmz points for instant cash outs of resource rewards to pay for 99 prayer or something
---
Yea being told to sit out is a good way to learn how to do something
---
You sound like smart-guy. /s
---
swampletics+bluecapeseason@gmail.com
---
You can do partner slayer the same way a level 3 can without getting combat exp, using a fun weapon, berserk neck and some other negative accuracy items, but you'd have to brew your attack down to 0/1 to do it I think. 
---
Might still be pretty slow though like half the speed of normal slayer probably, better than trek though.
---
lmfao? Why is everyone getting so salted over this fucking comment? 
---
You need to calm yourself.
---
You’ll be back.
---
Could you recommend anything to keep an eye on in the meantime while the appeal is being processed? Such as authenticater, emails, account searches, etc.?
---
There was nothing in the deleted messages or spam that would suggest something was sent, so unless they send the initial email, Jagex could still be processing it. 
---
Thanks for the help on this, its greatly appreciated.
---
no pet =( its a pet hunt.
---
I’m going to cannon and use poison to kill everything I can. Thanks for the idea tho!
---
Idk ask OP not me. This is just one of those bullshit suggestions that Reddit always makes that pretends its for some bullshit thing that doesn't matter at all but it's actual purpose is to make the game way easier/safer.

Precisely this

Done about 400 solos and only fuck with vanguards on rare occasions for all the reasons you've stated, yet can also confirm I've never found them as annoying in solo cms. There's just not enough room for error given their hp in solo regular raids
---
Nice
---
join osrs soa clan
---
It’s just mimic bots
---
For Vorkath, would it be better to save up for dhcb or rigour first? Currently using bp+bgs, void, god boots etc.
---
Slayermusiq played an HCUIM account for a while, idk if he still does.
---
It’s kinda funny.
---
Damn, I usually only hit 185 and that is with the Runelite plugin.
---
Thank you, I'll delete post. I forgot about ingame group chats lol
---
OP has got fairly small feet
---
Lore wise it could be explained similar to the fremnick, the master farmers don't trust you enough to let you close to their pockets. But I do agree it's a bit awkward
---
Black Knights Matter
---
It's because you need to talk to her before you can contact her with that spell
---
What did you expect? that's hell of a loaded statement
---
Lmao. You kids are gonna need a irl plugin to remember to breathe
---
I get what your saying, it seems like other users took it a completely different way. Whenever I want to buy a "pot", I have to try and find it amongst hundreds of irrelevant items, making it tedious to buy one item since you cant refine your search even further. While a "relevancy" option is interesting, theres no way for the program to read your mind in order to make it relevant to you every single time.
---
at this point they have it down to science jagex needs to do something i think they are making money of em or its helping them financially or something
---
Feel free to join ‘Phzyx’. Very friendly and helpful and always bossing. They’re happy to teach CoX and ToB too!
---
This is very good idea! Make it two-way, so it is an option for runite ore mining too. And not only that, it's also an escape path for high leveled players who are into skilling too.
---
Elite Wilderness and 85 Agility requirements would make it reasonable requirements. \^\^
---
There is a new private server called home coming. Highly recommend you check it out if you liked the original CoH
---
Yoink mine now
---
I want to try without it because I feel like when jagex release UIM at first they didnt depend on players using mechanics like that as a make shift bank, so it must be possible to play the game without needing it. I would still use a looting bag but dying at bosses or juggling just doesnt seem very true to the UIM nature
---
Still, very substantive response.
---
*Dairy World?*
---
Fairy World...
---
*Nuoh, darnit...*
---
Yes, never use food for slayer lol. These people are retarded
---
I have sgs/guthans and almost max melee and all it takes is 1 tick to put all my guthan's on, a few seconds to heal back up to full and put my other gear back on. That's literally it. Sgs spec is really risky because sometimes it just hits garbage and then you're out of spec and gg. Guthan's is probably the most valuable armor there is tbh. Can't even say how many times I have used it and it's chump change.
---
Doesn't look like 6 ft in the picture, but probably just due to the angle it's been taken from. The sword looks great, good job =]
---
F
---
Jad can't run as much
---
Do you use runelite with the gpu plugin?
---
Good laugh, shes a keeper
---
Haha its all g we hopped from pkers, logged in and are like wtf where’s Callisto, then I saw the drop in the chat box :p
---
Your streak and points stay the same and you need to get a new slayer task. You can effectively use this as a free skip by entering and leaving the fight caves to get rid of your task and get a new one.
---
9 hp account??
---
Yeah, or people mining the rune rock.
---
LOL BLACK ARMOUR IN A GAME BLACK PEOPLE JOKE
---
i said if they recovered the account. if they had enough info to recover the account (does not require email access) then they can repeatedly recover it whenever they want lol
---
I haven't seen the movie but this looks more like confusion than disapproval to me. And this would definitely confuse most parents, good meme 👍
---
anyone still saying weird flex doesn't have a sense of humour, you're literally a brainless sheep mimicking comments
---
It’s taller than I am!!
---
Maybe we're the real monsters
---
When you add a note to a name on runelite or any other client the note doesn't remain through a name change. It will clear the note
---
2700h is average
---
30m points is 100k eggs which is 9.5m, what are you doing to get 99 prayer with that.
---
Probably had a screenshot somewhere.
---
damn hmu
---
You can be affected by something and still laugh at it, granted you're not out here actively seeking to be butthurt.
---
I wish he could offer this service for every outfit
---
Why do Runefest tickets cost so much? Do they include food and drinks?
---
Exclusively for vorkath? Dhcb. For literally every other facet of the game AND vorkath? Rigour
---
It really depends how developed your account is and how much you know about the game. At earlier levels the best money making available might max out at a 200-300 thousand gp  per hour.
---
For very high level accounts with good gear, getting 3m+ per hour is very doable.
---
I'm not super experienced myself, but I'd recommend working on gaining stats and doing quests before focusing on money. If you get into the game and try to grind out a bond with no stats you're not gonna have a great time. 
---
If you get 5 weeks of free membership from the promotions, I would suggest not worrying about money for a bond until like the last week, should be much easier to make money by that point if you've played a decent bit.
---
That's a little high even for casual gameplay
---
It's a game mechanic introduced to combat bots and autoclickers.  After being logged in for six hours you are automatically logged out (this is referred to as a "six-hour log") and cannot sign in for a few minutes.
---
To avoid this, manually sign out and back in before the six hour mark.  This will reset the timer even if you're only logged out for a couple seconds.
---
Spending approximately 15 seconds googling I found out you are slightly unlucky but not really that dry based on the drop rate
---
Matter
---
:O:
---
I did muesum quest and the got a champion scroll drop as well
---
It's more about combat level than Slayer level since that's what determines your early tasks. 85 Combat is when it gets okay IMO.
---
Mains literally want to suck all the nuance and variety out of this game I swear to god.
---
That’s the average Time to max for players, not saying it’s not a lot but statistically speaking it’s the average time.
---
Maybe it is just because of my fairly atypical upbringing, but I find it so strange that any parent nowadays would be against a YouTue career after you show then how much you make. Like, unless you have super traditional parents, I would think most would be MORE impressed that you build your own career out of being on YT. That takes a certain level of self-startup ability that so many people lack.
---
No its not
---
I think he was referring to why it said his account was disabled (aka showing he was banned), but then was able to log in once he restarted runelite. Even when you get logged out at the 6 hour mark you can log back in without restarting the client, and it also doesn’t say your “acc has been disabled”
---
This is the wholesome shit I come here for. Congrats!
---
The only friend I know of is a youtuber what's the term "friend" mean?
---
yessir, it takes a while to get the rotation down. biggest issue for me has been getting hit by supreme when fighting prime, so ive worked on waiting for prime to walk to a place where i wont get dragged into supreme radius when fighting it, and then killing prime. after that i just use all my dds specs for supreme before rex spawns
---
My comment was meant as a sarcastic way to farm some karma.
---
I am well aware of how it works.
---
Rngesus strikes again

---
Lol given up on the game... Jagex's profits increase every year, they're not doing poorly in any way.
---
That is false in my experience.
---
Gamble it afterwards, that way if you mess up you still have a fire cape. The pet drop on task is 1/100. Trading in is always 1/200 I believe.
---
Thanks, I'm 75/90/75 and do plan on doing more nmz soon. Every time I feel like I've got the hang of things, something else pops up, haha. Loving all this content though
---
[Here, I fixed it](https://i.imgur.com/ylxiWJg.jpg).
---
Or alot of guitar stands. And a Sara sword.
---
It's only like 4k xp slower.
---
It's made at the same altar, but the xp per rune is slightly lower.
---
I've got some potions, a two-handed godblade of Saradomin, some sharks and about ~7000 cannonballs lodged up my sphincter.
---
A few months of flipping just to get 99 prayer? What are you on?
---
Tru
---
if you enjoy it why not
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
This is some wikipedia explanation, nice.
---
If you don't have Rigour I would probably suggest going for it. It's incredibly helpful in every facet of the game.
---
Magic needs something *for the sake of variety*, but I have to disagree with your reasoning. It doesn't need a buff, it needs more options. Also a max hit of 47 on a 20 second freeze is **far** from a "slight and balanced boost". It's a massive boost, one that magic doesn't need.
---
nice, what’re the stats on it
---
Thanks I don't have one yet, but I am considering buying one. I am hearing that it would take two clicks on the touch screen but as long as I can use  a mouse I am happy. I wish I knew if they were working on making a mouse compatible within the app!
---
lightweight smh...
---
I make all own supplies and currently just doing profitable skilling / pvm. Have two other accounts self-sustaining membership at mlm and both have made ~50m so far in ores. Also if you aren't membership get membership, even if you need to pay for bond you can easily make it back with lvl 1 methods in a week (i.e. Mort myre fungus, ~8 hours for a bond). Depends on how much you play as well, I average 2-9 hours a day depending on week/weekend.
---
Perhaps you got 'marked'.
---
Jagex sometimes mark accounts for bans then confirm the ban in waves at a later date, kind of like an invisible infraction against your account.   Perhaps their systems bugged out slightly and disabled you for a few minutes.   Their login system has been iffy for a while.
---
Im always looking for more people to play with ign: MeNoLuk
---
dam i thought this was real even logged in to vote yes kinda bummed its not hope jagex see it
---
You clearly don't know what you're talking about. I'm absolutely positive. I added notes to names to track risk fighters baiting and the notes cleared through double name changes. Every. Single. Time.
---
no worries yo but you got hit by the downvotes hard lol. if you're gunna correct someone, don't insult the person who's wrong, it's not necessary
---
Gz and Goodluck on your grind for tassets

It was edited, not ninja edited.

Tirannwn only is a pretty good one if you're a fan of masochistic, ridiculous grinding. Main goal is getting ready for Song of the Elves.
---
&gt;isn’t really an issue with RuneLite
---
Wait, so did you edit the photo you linked to make the chat green, or does RuneLite have a setting for this/if the item has been picked up?
---
I’ve been gone about a year, came back this past week and still fiddling with the settings/first time using RL.
---
I disagree on full armor, but chain and med it looks bad.
---
Ur doing all right kid but what is good?
---
Gz, now go imbue them!
---
If it was equivalent in str to obby I wouldn't see it being super op, maybe different requirements or a significant negative prayer stat.
---
Exactlyyyyy
---
Adding content isn’t always good. If it’s dead content it might as well not be in the game
---
I think u onto something bro
---
Most of them suck for players, but they all make sense for how they affect players repeatedly doing the minigame.
---
Saradomin godsword—&gt;examine
---
I hate people like you. I hope you have a PhD in national defense foreign policy because if you don't your very ignorant.
---
Maybe +2 str platebody and +1 str in the legs and helmet. It all depends on the quest reqs, whether its a quest reward or a drop from an enemy you can fight after the quest, and what that drop rate would be.
---
Would you give up one of your Runescape friends for 700 euros?
---
Hes botting
---
Omg id love this.
---
Jokes are made out of bad stuff so we don't get depressed all the time because of them. Also stop calling people "shitty" just because they didn't agree with you.
---
Doesn't have the same production value as Settled, but Pookaguy's OneChunkMan is a really good area restricted series. The videos are more like streams at 2 hours a piece with lots of rambling, but the guy is pretty funny and has lots of little gems in his videos if you watch the whole way through, like a full length song midway through an episode
---
There's basically two main ways to approach moneymaking, both revolve around camping content:
---
1) Do Blast Furnace and/or Mort Myre Mushrooms to fund everything and get the requirements for Zulrah -&gt; Kill Zulrah until you feel experienced at the boss and get about 100-200m of gear -&gt; Raid
---
2) Just train Slayer and do the AFK profitable ones like Gargoyles, Brutal Blacks, Kurasks, etc. This one takes a lot less skill and you profit a lot more on the way but takes a lot longer too and most people won't do this for the extreme amount of time it might take get the big ticket items like Elysian, Scythe, Tbow, etc.
---
Barrows gloves, first 99 (probably firemaking), full graceful, a pet
---
Thank you, gl with pet!
---
I called it spawn phase lol
---
That's my point. The lesson from Chernobyl should be that we should be wary of making such mistakes ourselves.
---
Oooooh are you asking for us to rank early slayer on a scale of 1 to 10?
---
&gt;Get good
---
Invest 2+ hours for each failed run and tens of millions of gp in supplies to eventually defeat Zuk after a month-long test of whether or not your anxiety won't get the better of you for once. 
---
Right.
---
Nobody:
---
Me and the boys:
---
200k mage ags, also yes you could double spec with ring of vigour and timing, used to make absolute bank doing that
---
Don’t give up! Fingers crossed 🤞
---
Nice dood
---
He wants the ability to equip items with the bank interface open.
---
So are you suggesting to do agility while tob on alt? How much xp do you expect I could get while doing that? Or what could work for hunting since chins are a bit intense
---
So hook up with her cousin?
---
Yes i need this badly
---
Torag's has the worst set effect **and** the worst amulet effect tho. At least the other sets with shitty set effects (Ahrim/Karil) have strong amulet effects.
---
Granted, Verac's amulet effect does not make the amulet worth using over a torture, but in a vacuum 7 prayer is definitely better than a defense bonus when you're almost dead anyway.
---
&gt;if i dont buy them and you dont buy them whose buying them??
---
Flawless logic man, forgot you two were the only players on this game. Go to any GE and you can see bond warriors from a mile away, not to mention I know several players that would rather work an hour or two of overtime vs farming vorkath for 10 hours.
---
If you sincerely believe the bonds ingame are just generated out of thin air you are absolutely nuts.
---
That would be the opposite of where it belonged
---
Literally makes no sense to lock them behind that quest. All for an idea of combatting bots but we would need to think of something more appropriate.
---
Like where 5 is average or where 7 is average?
---
Jagex is bitch to Fukong Interactive, a Chinese owner company which pushed the RS3 microtransactions to what they are today. OSRS's success and the community's consistant refusal of microtransions seem to be the only "integrety" Jagex can sit on. I used to pay $5 a month until my card expired my second year on OSRS and now from $10 to $11.  Bonds are in OSRS too. Hose mad
---
If that ain't engine work, I don't know what is
---
*false'nt

Iron man btw
---
When boost is half of its full value.
---
🔥🔥
---
Should I feel lucky if I’ve gotten both visages at 300KC
---
I wouldn't blame that to the bots mainly, although their number is increasing. Its mostly players are old and everything is about efficiency and making most gains in the least amount of time possible. What happened to just chatting in Grand Exchange? :(
---
If we're going real deep, does anybody remember Robot Wars Arenas of Destruction?

It depends on the task and how much cash you want to spend for convenience.  You need to pray for Abby specs for example, but you can tank stuff like nechs or Abby demons.  You just might need to restock on food instead of doing the entire task in one trip.  I usually take a few pots and pray piety instead of melee.
---
Also you will usually need to protection prayers in multi.
---
Try it out yourself and see.
---
mind explaining this reference
---
pm me your ign and i’ll give you some free supplies as a reward
---
No, I'm American, I have no use for European currency.

reeeee

Who's the idiot here? Me, or the person who can't even understand when he is talking to two entirely different people?
---
God bless.
---
Ive seen bots talk like that before tbh, maybe they are supposed to say that in a  private clanchat. Coule be a custom script that wasnt tested well or just broke
---
np bro. gl on max.
---
Definitely a dude
---
I'd like an armour set/item with that effect, but I don't think black knight armour is the right match for it; most demons are, like the black knights, also followers of Zamorak.
---
Rent was due
---
I could be wrong, but if you can get them from other tier clues they may not be on the easy log
---
I'm not saying it's not viable, I'm saying that even with Legacy mode, it's still too easy and not fun.
---
There's a chap further up referring to Britain as imperialist monarchist pigs; it's bants.  Don't be so butthurt.

Well you've got 3 choices.
---
1. Niche content that may not be used regularly.
---
2. Power-creep content.
---
3. No content at all.
---
So take your pick. I pick 1.
---
Hence why I said iirc he streams. Also a while back he polled whether or not he should take a sponsor. And it was an overwhelming yes from the community. Not like I know for sure it’s assumption.
---
You’re either a really bad troll or really dumb.
---
Not only that, but the osrs discord bot keeps track as well.
---
All bots were able to spread into a 10x10 square and attack NPC's simultaneously. bots started in lumbridge and walked to varrock and beyond
---
Except they do. See: their entire YouTube channel whenever they pronounce Guthix and even their pronunciation video.
