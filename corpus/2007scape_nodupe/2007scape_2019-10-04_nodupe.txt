The 12k per kill without uniques does not include the b ring my dude. Yes Rex is profitable with uniques. I'm saying if you cannot collect every bone with the elites you may not end up ahead without the b ring drop.
---
Or increasing the requirements to wear bandos?
---
My washing machine also has super load
---
I explained to another person here. Just copy and pasted because it applies the same.
---

---
The issue is the type of grind, and what it's turned every other grind into, because of updates. 
---
I mentioned a few years ago that everyone did zulrah for profit, all day. Those very same people would then train their buyable skills, increasing the cost for alternative players, as it drives up prices. So now people that aren't willing to do the meta pvm method are suffering. Those people doing zulrah then train non-buyables by going for high xp and low gp methods, because they can make up the financial difference through zulrah. 
---
Jagex failed to implement skilling updates that followed the profit margins with newer pvm content. I understand bossing should be considered the meta at all times, but not by the gap it's been made to. 
---
The pvm updates have made skilling almost meaningless, I noticed myself only skilling to heighten the total level and have a base skilling level. Because they're not profitable, not by the same level by any means, most of the time I lost a lot of money, so what do I have to do to rebuild? Post release pvm content, again. Creates a horrible cycle and a single way of playing if you want to enjoy newer content, like I said to the other person, nobody could afford a t-bow by mining or woodcutting, unless they dedicated hours we couldn't comprehend. Only people that get close to that kind of money for newer content are people that just do new pvm content day in and day out.
---
What I'm trying to say, is a whip used to be a BIS weapon. Okay it'll take you longer affording one by cutting this, mining that... But it was still possible to achieve things you wanted by playing the way you wanted. That's not possible anymore, the ways of playing have become limited if you want to enjoy newer content
---
Sure, how he treated Zanik was wrong, but Bob's wife and kids were killed by goblin raiders. It's easy to understand why he lashes out and doesn't trust goblins.

 You can choke till the end of your days on a dick for your d-bag exaggerating personality.

I am enjoying your echo of butt hurt cause your minority of the game needs to be catered too instead of understanding you are not the most important person in the room.
---
Let's look at all the bis helms. Yep all are under 10m. Justicar is 34m and it comes from ToB and is part of a set effect which gives it more value. 
---
Before the update I'd wager 3-5m. Now probably 10-15.
---

yeah guys this is way too easy can we get a buff on these guys? I'm going back to raiding btw cya
---
No idea why that’s happening
---
Great, thanks
---
I’m failing to see what the problem is? The game has always put emphasis on PvM over skilling because the majority of players would rather PvM than skill but that doesn’t mean profitable skilling doesn’t exist. Hunting black chins, Zalcano now, no shit chopping Magic’s and mining coal was always worse it’s a zero effort activity vs PvM that actually has a skill aspect. 
---
I literally don’t even get what you’re trying to argue now. You haven’t played in 6 months, you stay informed via this subreddit (God Bless lol). You’re clearly disconnected from the actual game.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, ill give it a try
---
stop inflating to 20% cause you weren't happy it's actually 12.7* and you know that doesn't fit your narrative.

Pretty sure you just have to re-log and it should be with you
---
Damn that's just bad luck. Just gotta keep an eye on the map and world switcher at all times I guess, not much you can do when you're fighting though
---
Demonics require 69 slayer lol
---
I use redirect tablets but I’m saying slayer ring should somehow have a tele to duradel. Brimhaven dungeons not a bad idea. I know the options I have. This wasn’t a question it was a SUGGESTION.
---
You're getting weirdly passive aggressive over a game mate. It's an opinion, nothing else. 
---
Whip used to be BIS, okay it'll take longer affording one by mining for example, but it was doable. 
---
Newer items means if you want to buy it, you need to play a certain way, otherwise it's not attainable. Nobody is buying a scythe or tbow by mining. 
---
So because jagex have failed to keep skilling up with the rest of pvm updates, they've forced people to play a single way to enjoy newer content, it's really simple.
---
Excellent
---
What happened in april?
---
Do a bigger switch and go to your house after each kill to refill spec. iirc this is more efficient til you get a dhcb
---
Yeah that's why your bring like 10 bolts. Probably won't even pick them up.
---
it worked thanks!
---
I mean it does say that in the blog post.
---
I’ve literally gone completely empty handed and they still kill me lol
---
Thank you!
---
I'm right, you're wrong. That's how simple it is. Sorry that everyone hates you Mr martyr
---
Zerk
---
Crazy how your stupidity demands two separate threads. The dbow is bis for one spec damage, of any weapon in RS. Keep crying that you're wrong though lol
---
The problem with the max cape variants is that they still exist and can be created for not-BIS capes. Additionally, some of them (looking at you, mage arena 1/2 capes) are super hard to distinguish.
---
Yeah, sorry to have a go at you.
---
No problem, Gratz on the pet !
---
So where do they come from if nobody does them?
---
Yeah, it's full of brainlets like you
---
Bots, never said nobody does them. You can just do things that make money 10x faster
---
my primary acc is one and thats actually what i call them too lol; i was just being pedantic as what he was saying was incorrect. the term "pure" used by itself refers to 1 def pures yeah but 2 say that there is only one type of pure is Questionable cus zerkers and 13 def/initiate/def pures ARE types of pure
---
Lmao, why does there have to be an incentive for the pker in every situation? You're  already busting a load over bones on the ground after a kill, why does there need to be more?
---
Wasn't that the style of the original Twisted Bow that players hated? Anyway, while I don't think that looks bad, if the TBow does get an Orn Kit, I'd rather see it do something a bit better than swapping the colors. More of an Obby Maul or Fury Orn than a Dark Bow recolor...
---
This Is why I strictly stick to Skilling for money making. It's too much of a gamble with this stuff. RNG and such.
---
DO YOU NOT HAVE A PHONE?
---
Absolutely.
---
I'm comparing it more to similar upgrades that offer similar stats.
---
Ferocious gloves for example. Require ds2 to have, higher stats, and come from a 95 slayer boss. Yet are ~8m. They're a similar upgrade over b gloves as faceguard is over neitz and serp.
---
That's the reasoning I have on why it will settle to where I think it will.
---
I personally think he should assign a random amount of a random creature, like what will it be today? 1 cow? 150 callisto? 600 rats?
---
I've been using the good ol' "try to click with the mouse fast enough". I killed him once but damn near fucked that up. So imma have to give that a try
---
What was the Jan one? I didn't play then
---
I don't think that's necessarily true. MM2 requires 69 slayer but I don't think the monsters technically have any level requirement.
---
It's still besides the point, though, since the arguments that apply for why knights are op for their slayer level requirement still would apply for gorillas, even with 69 slayer. They're much harder than most slayer mobs that require 70+
---
Would be awesome if you also could only get tickets when wearing a full graceful outfit. Would add some risk to doing wildy agility for the recolor while making black graceful a lot harder to obtain, so it wouldn't just be something everyone has.
---
&gt;But this is less balanced than it was before lmao
---
Making something that has recently been added to the game useless/way too experience usually doesn't have a negative effect on the balance of the game as a whole. There.

"love swampathletics"... makes me think of kermit the frog running canifis course.
---
That's being unluckily lucky
---
Absolute facts.
---
More stats works so far in that you create stronger mobs to kill, but even then the obvious flaw is making older content super easy.
---
Most (perhaps all but I am not sure) of the client side visual effects are untraceable. This includes most(all?) overlays
---
Nah.  Pure is 1 def.  if you’re 13 def you’re some weird slayer alt.  If you’re 42 def you’re a voider, 45 def you’re a zerker, 70 def piety, 75 def med

How often does this work though
---
Nice, get your cape man!  I think its F1 for inventory and F5 for the prayer but I could be wrong. Make sure you dont use auto retaliate for some reason lol.
---
Just wait for them to be selling this on rs3 or trying to push it on us
---
True! That would definitely be something that'd add prestige to it. If not that, maybe it would be cool to implement a system where you get a higher chance of getting tickets when you're skulled, similar to rev caves

Always keep untradables as blocked on the alch options boys.

It really do look like dag rex droppin the fattest boi hand on someone tho

My point is only about the slayer level requirement being arbitrary, that's all.
---
That's usually how to goes...
---
The ol' Konar'd
---
You enjoy just afking monsters for massive drops?  I'd rather go do GWD or DKs as a mid lvl instead of afk money make. Basilisk knights offer nothing more than a BiS drop, how is that "fun"?   At least add an interesting mechanic or make it different than literally a basic slayer moster.

It\`s what Torevesta uses to pk

Oh I know

I’m new but I’m not new to gaming
---
Are you comparing the alchemical hydra with basilisk knights? There’s a pretty big time/effort gap between the two, reqs and difficulty.
---
That's not quite the same. People are voting no to pvp updates because they never pvp and don't want players to annoy them in the wilderness with even more dangerous options. Thats 20% of the playerbase based on the latest poll. 
---
With skills its clear that overwhelmingly the community wants a new skill. They voting no because its not the skill they want. There's no automatic 20% no vote. Its just the a portion of the community legitmately doesn't like the new skill.
---
This is the direction slayer should be going in though. Since Death mechanics mean there is no longer ANY risk to Slayer there’s no justifiable reason so many rare drops need to be slayer exclusives as well as good consistent money per kill. The risk is that you lose money and time going for those items and those items maintain value.
---
The bragging rights item is included; those handheld trophies are not tradeable!
---
Undetermined whether they'll pass the poll, but it'll fill the role if so.
---
Yeah just doing some vorkath between raids.
---
It’s safe to assume rapier is still more than fine. I did a lot of math with the DPS calculator pre-buff, and rapier destroyed the hasta at my levels (low 90s). I haven’t bothered to do the math again with the update, but rapier is never bad.
---
Problems:
---
The number of people that do it is getting smaller
---
Clans of 20 think they are top shit when they take down a solo player doing a clue and usually use abusive wording while killing said person. 
---
There is currently no reward for pvp apart from the other persons gear(which usually isn’t much)
---
To be strong in pvp you must have a specifically built account for it, otherwise you get destroyed. 
---
Some Pvmers in the wild like to think they deserve an immunity from the pvp aspects of the wild.
---
Wow I just got hit with some nostalgia. This was the shit I did and got fun out of when I first started playing
---
My therapist used to play RuneScape
---
Rapier would be better than leaf bladed battle axe but from what i remember they have slightly lower crush defence so a crush weapon on the same level as rapier or just below would be better
---
Rex is limited by its spawn time though. You can't reasonably get more than 33 rex kills per hour. This limits the gp per hour to like 1m. Basilisks you can get like 75 kph. With a 20m price tag, basilisks are about 2m an hr on task for now. I'm not a big fan of them but they are easy and afkable even post update.
---
I enjoy doing them and 450k a hour for airs is not bad
---
There are dumb people who forget to bank valuables or cash stacks, especially while doing clues, and they are probably hoping to get lucky. My scroll book has like 3m worth of tele scrolls in it and I have definitely forgot to bank it before when going out for a clue. If you really want to annoy pkers, turn auto retaliate on and set player attack option to hidden and bring a blowpipe to venom them. Dont ever attack them manually just auto retaliate so you never skull and voila, you have a salty pker.
---
I'm waiting for the follow up post that retcons half the cast into being gay and/or disabled refugees.
---
dont have that problem with the pattern. the only annoying thing i can think of is getting combo'd out by a snakeling during the mage phase. im at like 1500kc and i still dont mind killing him at all
---
Holy shit your dumb.  He and Arislash were both in his stream and talking about how Serp helm should still be BiS for str. 
---
&gt;You equally said they were too easy, the helm had too high of a strength bonus and they're boring.
---
Thats what he's still saying dumbass, so wheres the backpedaling.  I think no established streamer wanted the new BiS to come from an easy as fuck quest and an easy as fuck afk slayer monster.  Which part is he back pedaling on or do you not know how to read?
---
Queen black dragon was actually really fun. If you have a high level account I recommend trying to kill it at least once. Well designed boss
---
gotta raid with ASS
---
No clue why. I used imgur same as always

Yo mama so fat d Hally spec hits 3 times

So how can any of this be fixed by jagex?
---
Oh the fabled dragon pure.  Just because some idiot types it doesn’t make it true.  Pure clans don’t run around with maxed piety accounts and claim they’re piety pures.  Next thing you know there’s a 99 attack strength def combat pure.
---
What slayer level are you? I also used to get excited about wyrms, that is until I started getting skeletal wyverns and brutal black dragons lol
---
OH WAIT NOW I REMEMBER WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS 20%, CUZ IT FUCKING IS YOU RETARD
---
Skip question is 36%. That means 64% answered it. And 12.7% said it was cuz they don't like pvp. SO 20 FUCKING PERCENT OF THE VOTERS IN THIS QUESTION SAID THEY VOTE NO BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE PVP
---
I'm going back to my previous sentiment- eat a dick
---
You said that already.
---
but a one-handed crush weapon like that doesn't exist
---
Rendi. I watched the video you uploaded on YouTube about barrows gloves. It was good
---
And wash your clothes too you filthy nerds, a shower doesn't count if you get out and immediately put back on the same cum stained sweat pants you've been wearing for 8 weeks.
---
Right, but slowing it down is a band-aid not a solution. Whether it's 3 months or 9 months, eventually basilisk knights will be a task most won't do, if that's not already the case after this news.
---
Fucking wolves.
---
Majority can’t to be honest. 
---
The rewards they are trying to help with, but as the recent polls showed, people don’t like it. 
---
I see that some changes will come as “integrity” but in the end, the more the pvp scene dies, the safer a pvmer is so people vote for no just to spite. 
---
However with the recent polls, I don’t think the ancient weapons should have been in the game. 
---
Anyone that voted no to the looting bags and rune pouches though is just voting smitefully imo.
---
Solution: make all players Pmods, dicing bots will never be able to speak.
---
It's hovered around that for over 3 years.
---
Max players would say the opposite
---
Use Runelite it’s way better than the Vanilla, plus it has a GPU plugin. :)
---
Gg
---
Rapier is the best dps here, it's very easy to run this calc and find out only hasta comes anywhere close but still not better.
---
It doesn’t matter if you don’t care, and I don’t think anyone else cares either, I hope you have a good one!
---
Assuming a maxed player can get around 35 KPH, that would only be 1.4m / hr from non-jaw drops. If jaw stays around 20m, this would max at about 2.8m / hr, while Vorkath can get around 3.5m / hr. With this droprate, I'd guess the jaw might drop to about 15m in the next couple of months, and lower later, making max profit per hour around 2.4m.  
---
  
---
I would suggest making the average kill around 60k and the drop rate of jaw to 1/800 off-task or 1/400 on task from this boss. But that's just because I want more players to have access to the faceguard, and for a decently profitable boss for mid levels to exist. I think it's important to have the 60k drop be largely in supplies, with some fixed prices from alchables and high volume items.  
---
The average player pre-zulrah/pre-vorkath would probably get something like 15-20 kph here, making it 1m an hour for them, minus supplies, plus jaws. That sounds reasonable. With 20m jaws, this would be 1.9m an hour, but they would crash before too long. It would be a good idea to make the jaw disassemble for something else, if they want to keep it no lower than say 3m.  
---
Maxed players would be earning 3850k from this boss on task per hour with jaws at 20m. It would probably settle around 5.7m if maxed players cbf with the content once it's lower than 2.6m an hour. Lots of PvM is around 3m an hr when maxed. And off-task, it would be 2975k an hr currently and end up around 2.35m an hour for maxed players. This would offer a melee alternative to Zulrah and be a bit worse profit than Vorkath at least.
---
take an upvote

Aaaaand that’s another no to PvP polls from yours truly

Just join osrs soa

This icon has killed me over 10 times while multi pking. Whoever thought it was a good idea to out it there needs their eyelids removed.
---
Edit: turns out you can turn the orb off. Thabks op, without this thread that thing would still tilt me.
---
I’m also approaching the off task drop rate with 1800 kills being done on task, oh lord am I having a bad time
---
Bondzplz
---
I'm just explaining why they did it, I'm not excusing. I had the same question as OP so I tweeted ash, they said the balancing was important. Idk man.
---
league/dota was based off warcraft 3 big brain
---
Not to mention that you are still subjected to rng to break that deficit.
---
That's not what i said. I've been munching fish, drinking potions and using my barrows armor for many hours. I't would be nice if the overall loot of 400k actually was attainable through fewer drops worth 1-5k each so that you don't have to go banking a ton of unnoted daggers, swords and maces to break even. Because nobody are going to do that for pennies when you have to pay tokens for running around looting and entering and leaving the area
---
Wut

What, you don’t hop all worlds daily with an alt?  Can I borrow your mod account since you’re not using it ?

I think the toggle would be a sufficient place for the button itself to be really.

I just got my barrows gloves tonight after 10 years of playing. Just felt the need to put that out there
---
What the fuck dude. Spoken like an ironman. Pvp has plenty of problems, but what you listed sounds like pvmer circlejerk shit.
---
Been like that before oldschool exsisted. You just need a bigge5 clan to bait those max kiddies into multi and take bills off them.
---
You're not very bright are you?
---
And kraken, Thermy, gg, sire, kq. The list goes on lol
---
I was 90-99-85 when I did zammy. Arclight was my spec weapon. I think out of 25ish trips I did, one of them was one kill only. The rest were a minimum of two, with three not being uncommon. My best was five. That's why I asked if your stats are particularly low.
---
Yo momma so fat she eats the redberry pie in one bite

Those are the problems that I see, what do you see at the problems?

For real though. The superior marble gargoyle has a special attack but you can actually dodge it. This attack is way too fast lol

The amount of limes you’re buying suggests you’re throwing a party or opening a bar that serves tequila.. I expect an invite

Look at WeDoRaids. They put stuff out all the time, teach people how to do CoX and ToB, and do a whole bunch of guides. Alternatively, you could look into joining a clan.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculators#Prayer
---
We Do Raids discord is a good place to start
---
I mentioned trophies that are untradeable (meaning we'd need to do it on our main) and ironmen who need to do it on that account for any rewards at all. Then you said 'use an alt' which implies you did not at all read the post.

Here is a spreadsheet with a lot of skilling methods and their xp and gp per hour. They are also usually close to the max xp possible so if you are more afk the rates will be slightly worse
---
Tbf its better people blow all their fake money rather than real money.
---
The game is like this:
---
A PKer is dropping random valueables outside the bank, they want you to skull so you also risk something or else they wouldnt risk dropping these items. The "scam" is that if you try to telegrab it, it will path you out of the bank. When in reality, this is the scam: 
---
Here comes guy #2, explaining this "scam" to you, saying that you guys can antiscam him. He will be the bait with the high skulled risk, while you instead "anti-scam" the PKer by logging in taking the items he drops(or simply killing him for some item).
---
So far so good, you get the item and its a sucsess. The guy you "anti-scammed" with wants his part of the split. Nothing fishy so far, you could just dip with the whole split. This is only to make you trust them.
---
Then comes the real scam, they want you to be the bait this time, as they would recognize him so he can't do it himself. He pretends he will be the guy to log under the PKer(just a friend/alt of the scammer) and then split with you afterwards, but instead you skull with the risk and with some trickery(like how the high-risk worlds happen, or with having you click a one click teleport, or getting you to run out of the bank by animation-stalling while you trade them) they get you instead for your tbow/whatever you skulled with.
---
This game is full of sweaty nerds, spanish speakers and bots. its over
---
Yeah that's fair enough. I guess at the end of the day it's their game and we have to assume that they're at least smart enough not to get bullied into making a decision based on the ree'ing of a few nerds
---
I think that the problem with pvp is that in the old days pvp was a top tier money maker, now it is vastly outclassed by multiple pvm options and pvmers are afraid to vote yes to something that could make it a viable money maker again
---
sweaty spanish bots
---
&gt; Either mod roq was involved
---
Stop.
---
WeDoRaids is a good alternative, you can always hop into our cc @ "Imperial PvE." A group of ten or so friends at the moment who learned how to raid together and are now pretty proficient with T-Bow splits in WeDoRaids. We'd teach you some time or another if you'd like in an organized Discord.
---
Nice
---
I wish it was that easy but I’ve tried that and it can take forever to actually get the timing right. Some of them can detect if I’m logging in and out like that too and stop talking.
---
Well if they think it's for the integrity of the game of course they aren't going to poll it.
---
Dont mind that guy hes just a stupid troll
---
Looking real stable to me.

60 slayer requirement or not, people were expecting something like Demonics in mechanics, just toned down so everyone could kill them. Just something some sort of mechanic that doesn't make it another "pray mage and afk".

Ahhh now it makes sense why al of reddit is mad about it. Cause its mosty low lvls doing this content lmaoo. And go get that infernal cape man, hardest part is getting through how fuckin boring it gets

Predictions: 
---
* Slayer 2.0 aka Skilling Slayer but it's a minigame or activity ("Go fish 400 sharks in Catherby" etc).
---
* Desert Treasure 2.0 and large expansion to bulk up the area to make way for the next league thing (assuming the proposed current one goes ok?)
---
* Group Ironman
---
Maybe: HCUIM please?
---
EoC and SoF came out in 2012.
---
Understand what?

Would they require a god icon cork when creating the potions?
---
Mean gp/hr isn't the only important summary statistic for loot distribution though. Variance (in this case EXTREMELY high) is what makes these monsters feel really fucking bad to slay.

They could make the jaw drop more frequently. That would drop its price and could be used by jagex to tune the gp/hr of this method.
---
Maybe if you’re 12
---
Pet chance.
---
Some people care for more than just their belly buttons, like for the game's longevity for example
---
Maybe new empty divine vials sold in shops. That can open a door to a small crafting update too if they can be created from scratch.
---
I agree, it looks fine. Even if it continued on its current trend it'll still be a 10 mil item in 2023, which is fine.
---
50 stab 10 crush compared to 30 and 0.
---
So there's 10 extra defensive stats in the mix. Rapier still wins.
---
No, you don't care
---
F's in the chat, please.
---
&gt;They said they dislike the high level nerd,neckbeard,NEET, etc. community and wish that jagex would instead cater to them as they dont play as much and are normal, totally function, cool people with med levels
---
"Such a shame we we can't really know what they mean't by that statement unless we specifically ask them to clarify, there's just no way to tell what they truly think of the people they are calling neckbeard elitists. I've exhausted all my mental brain power and can't come up with which side they're on or what they're arguing for" - Smooth Brain Travis
---
&gt;I'd almost think that from all the "you guys" and the need to call everyone who disagrees with you a moron it could be inferred that you have a victim complex with a side of arrogance. Not everyone's out to get you some people just dont think like you do, and thats okay bud.
---
First thing I genuinely don't think you understand what a victim complex but hey don't let that stop you from using big boy terms. Second you think I called you a moron for no reason? Really couldn't be that you couldn't even make it through a single example, that you begged for, before pretty much telling everyone you have extreme difficulty reading? "Oh yeah dude totally got him that example is sarcasm that means he isn't complaining about the HLC" Sarcasm used to insult the HLC then complain that unless Jagex caters to med levels people will quit the game. Which is literally the thing that you said was "  a big misconception" and "Ur hyperbolizing and twisting words" to prove. You understand what sarcasm is but somehow don't understand the reason for its use at all yet you think its out of place to call you a moron?
---
&gt;The fact that you'll "infer" whatever if it can be even remotely construed that way to fit your views is why this even turned into what it did.
---
It's not even a stretch to read between the lines on these comments but you're just handwaving all the examples because you thought you had a big brain moment thinking that "If I ask him for multiple sources he won't even bother to find them so I can pretend I won" which then kinda fell apart when I gave you 4x the examples you wanted just from this week alone. Then you just double down on the "Well we can't really know how these commentators feel about these people who they are calling greasy, pants shitting neckbeards who jagex should never listen to" as if its a justifiable defense. You didn't expect a response back and hoped you didn't get one because you had no real defense. I absolutely saw this coming which is why i mentioned you would fucking do this whole intentionally obtuse bullshit before you even responded because that is what Redditors always fucking do, OSRS or on frontpage subreddits. The good ole anyone who disagrees with me has to bare the burden of proof and I never have to source anything because I know 95% of the time they won't bother to even respond, and even if they do respond I'm just going to call their source shit and then immediately gloss over the sources I asked them to provide because they prove me wrong and I CANT BE WRONG. Shit is Reddit 101 behavior especially with how political reddit has gotten.
---
&gt;You want so desperately to be right about an OPINION i wonder how you can even communicate with people daily with that need to be right so strong against someone you dont know never mind people that you meet with all the time.
---
You're still here too brainlet.
---
Rendi I love you man BUT ELVARG IS A GIRL
---
You actually don’t want to be above 88% because then you waste a reward space on bolt racks
---
With the vote system? If we just vote no to p2w mtx, then they cant harm the game.
---
Thanks pancayk I refreshed the home page and couldn't find it again.
---
I heard this. Dial up Runescapers where you at
---
So much for "It's price has been fine since release."
---
Looks like a downward trend to me. Would make sense seeing as they have only made it easier to get. It's nearly lost half its value over a year.
---
I feel as though Jagex should start enforcing the "**participating in player-run games of chance**" part of the rule. Start issuing 3 day bans, and eventually a permanent ban if they won't stop. These bots wouldn't exist without a market. 
---
I know that a bunch of people were permabanned for trading dice bots on January 5th (the "purge" mentioned in the video), but only if they just so happened to be using the bots that day. The bots came back the very next day and virtually nobody even realized that any regular players got banned. Plus, even I'm not enough of an asshole to insist that someone with no offenses on their account should be perma'd for trading a bot 100k once, especially given I see people with 2000+ total trading these things for some stupid reason.
---
Stupid ppl thought if we vote yes to cosmetic mtx then the whole game is over
---
That looks awesome!!!! Thank you!!
---
First you say serp will be BIS for str, now you say melee... While faceguard would be BIS for hybrid. Serp wouldn't be all around BIS with the faceguard at +5, you'd have to choose, whereas faceguard at +6 means it's better than serp in *more* places. Pretty sure Adam even mentioned *this* a few times as it's a point i strongly agree with.
---
&gt;And then he never said BUFF
---
This comes down to common-sense, rewatch the release livestream if you must, but common-sense dictates he was basically gagging for a buff, but Adam knows he can't simply say it, so he bitched and moaned and tweeted about it non-stop. If you can't infer he was asking for a buff from his actions you're a moron, the majority of people saw right through it which is why they're annoyed. 
---
His "constructive" criticisms are also heavily biased to someone that gets paid to engage in entertaining content, so as is, they're usually short sighted and misinformed opinions. Again, the majority of the playerbase agree, given the discussions abounding lately. He, as a player - is almost totally inept in seeing the game from any other perspective than one where he has to do something engaging to maintain stream quality for profit.
---
Take a small conversation about PvP he was having for another example:
---
Adam stated something along the lines of "Why do LMS, there's no reason" and literally 5 seconds later said "We have a community that is adverse to fun."
---
So i said, why not just do LMS for fun, he said because there's nothing to gain.
---
This statement in and of itself is extremely hypocritical.
---
First he doesn't recognized is subjective thoughts on what is fun, then blames the community for not sharing *his* view on what is fun. This isn't a problem if Adam was a regular player, but he isn't. He constantly streams to &gt;1.5k players, gets to talk to Jmods in person and his tweets are definitely read 100% of the time by the mods. Having shallow, not-so well thought out "constructive" criticisms like this and sharing it publicly with his levity is genuinely cancerous to productive conversation.
---
Just look at how you've gone about defending him with weak ass and objectively incorrect statements.
---
Dude needs to grow up and see things from the perspective of other people before spewing his collective bitch's and moan's onto the community.
---
omg i almost forgot about that! ty =D
---
That was an amazing quest. Galvek was a bit of a head ache but I got him after some tries on mobile
---
You know jagex doesn’t do everything they can and there reason is they’re underpaid.
---
 It’s obviously an issue when people make thousands monthly irl by botting a game that people pay more then other games for. 
---
I’m not saying there’s a solution but you can’t flame someone getting annoyed by bots when they’re evidently in a lot of places in the game.
---
178 days later-
---
He already said he have other plan after Swampletic. 
---
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised he's playing and recording the next series as he is grinding for Morytania endgame.
---

If you blow a bit of air in the sandwich bag before u close it it prevents the water activating the touch screen.
---
Yeah and only doing 60 basilisks are ~1500k/h from the jaw alone. People are crying for no reason. They should give it Medusa stone effect as a charge up where you have to turn away, instead of the projectile, and revert the stats and hp.
---
Basically, blast furnace lets you smith about,
---
***27 times faster***
---
make crafting them require a chisel and the crystal shards and the process is something like “you shape the shard into the symbol of seren and place it onto the potion”
---
how long does it take to get a full graceful outfit? I'm currently 56 agility, would I be able to get all pieces by 60 agility at Canifis?
---
Legend. Thanks!
---
&gt; It wouldn't be too hard to implement for Jagex... Would it?
---
Don't underestimate the spaghetti of an 18 years old game engine.
---
Jagex know group ironmen is a popular request, and would certainly release it if they could, however it's actually not straight forward to implement. Group ironman requires the game to know your player ID between sessions so it can recognise which player is in which group, and this is engine work, i.e. not something the content devs can do. It's the same reason why slayer partners are so limited, as you'll lose your partner when logging out. 
---
These same changes are also needed for a much better clan system, as now clans in-game is pretty much just a common chat channel.
---
I do whip spade clue and clue box if I need to bring gear for the three musketeers.
---
that song howling was so fire i bought a shirt i was thankfull for finding it
---
This has nothing to do with Basilisks
---
I think the crystalline hunllef is a fantastic high level boss due to the mixture of mechanics it has 
---
It's a shame it's also gated behind fucky moments like the floor tiles that you can easily accidentally path into when you're busy worrying about the beams and his prayer changing and changing your weapon.
---
it says "near max gear" learn to read
---
Uncle Dana!
---
Great series. Love learning more about the game mechanics from you. But no amount of hacking will save you from those wolves..
---
Depends how many marks you have already
---
Usually going from 10 agil doing rooftops you can get graceful before 60, but if you're just starting to collect marks now it might take you till high 60s or even 70.
---
I for one am jealous. Currently sitting at 550+ kc for barrows and I have 9/25 uniques from that boss. :(
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No veracs skirt either ughhhh
---
I still love rs3 in its current state but i will never recommend it to anyone.
---
Edit: i dont see the video
---
30k loss vs losing 100-200k loot.
---
I don't think anybody wanted this change. Knights were pointless even beforehand, waste of points.
---
Why not zhasta? Sure, +5 lower crush accuracy compared to the cudgel but +5 strength over it is probably way better anyhow. Haven't run the numbers but am curious.
---
Forget glory, take seed pod for minimum loss
---
Aww man lol at least I have plenty more levels to maybe make use of that. I’ll keep that in mind
---
I agree bonds are good but the way they were put into the game was despicable. The investors don’t want “to pay to f2p” but “bonds will offset the cost of adding f2p and you will only get f2p with bonds”
---
Truly felt bad for the team as they had no real say in that decision despite the obvious increase in players.
---
He's HC boys even worse!
---
it also needs half the amount of coal, and makes a bunch of money. just make sure you have agility trained to about 24 or so.
---
Yeah just got my first task since the update on my iron with 80 atk 95 str, wasnt paying too much attention watchin vids until I realized ive been fighting the same superior for a whole ass 5+ minutes. Super unnecessary
---
Dropping faster than the player base count actually
---
This is so much engine work. They can't even make npcs run and you expect a faster runspeed.
---
Thank the gods for bessie
---
This looks like a witch's broom.
---
Yeah, there are 2 sizes - only the small ones drop it.
---
They're married.
---
I mean how different can you really make a MOBA from other MOBAS? Dota was made as a mod to WC3 anyway so they're stealing their own idea back? Hearthstone and MTG play completely different from each other. Pretty much the only similarity is that it's a TCG. I didn't play d1 or d2, but how is d3 anything like wow?
---
yeah the tiny ones drop it, no worries we all derp at some point. Hope you kill that dragon soon! good luck
---
The real old school way, or as we like to call it, the shitty way
---
Congrats!
---
I always played F2P and got enjoyment out of it... then realized I could quest my first 2-3 days in OSRS and achieve the same results that took me 3-4 months in F2P.
---
I started a HCIM and I have already out achieved my main who started F2P in about 1/10th the time because of quests and member content/minigames. I'm currently around 1,400 total level.
---
bro i got rangers at around 55 and again at 150.. but u know what i deserved to get that ive been dry literally everywhere else.. it also took me 604 kills to get a zenyte shard.. those are the only drops ive gotten that are worth anything over 1m.. my luck is just so blatantly rigged to be as bad as possible to get me to not play..
---
I don’t think I hit it with my DWH to be honest. I can’t remember though
---
Edit: I honestly just decided to start recording after like 10-20 seconds cause I thought “this is gonna take forever”
---
Bye 👋 See you in a couple of weeks
---
Honestly it's a great idea in theory, but it would never happen. To do so, they'd have to release their server code pretty much. The private server scene would explode.
---
Hmm.. that's pretty weird. Do you switch between desktop and mobile a lot? To be safe, make sure you have 2fa on your account and email + a secure password.
---
Shield of arrav minigame finder has people that do it for free, dont get scammed lol

Cudgel probably beats rapier against the superiors

But for srs, theres no excuse for this, hope everyone with a maxed account gets wiped.
---
You can easily hit demonic gorillas though. Idk what the gp/hr at DG’s are. But at basilisks it’s like 200k gp an hour and 60 kills an hour with max stats and gear

Inb4 he got the pet at 300 kc lol

Safespot in chasm of fire. Easy with rcb

---
People are complaining about the superior giving them 5,500 slayer exp in 2 minutes saying its not enough that is spoiled
---
We will make sure we have enough worlds on stand by to boot up for players in the league :)
---
There were no empty worlds on release day. Now there’s 1 or 2 people killing them per world. 
---
Not very many people are killing them because they’re currently aids. Also, I don’t think there’s a very high demand for the item either :/
---
&gt;ur profits get drained 
---
so good revenue but its not good profit?
---
These basilisks are effectively task only, in that with how rare the jaw is off task its much better to just only do them on task.
---
[139,749 people and counting have 91 slayer as i write this post](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/overall.ws?table=19&amp;page=5230) its not some ultra-high req few people have. Cerb is by far the most efficient gp in the game for a non alt user, in terms of balancing ehp/hr and profit/hr, and yet it remains profitable.
---
EDIT: for reference [only 302,465 people have the 55 rc req for exiles](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/overall.ws?table=21&amp;page=12099) this is only a bit over 2.1x as many as 91 slayer, some of them are undoubtedly missing other quest reqs and unlike hellhounds, basilisk slayer tasks are exclusively opt-in from the higher level masters. so the number of people who can do knights is pretty comparable with cerb.

All that effort for 6k loot lul

ohh, everything has it for dirt.  GE lists it low too.  Know why that happens?

Same chance of getting tangleroot from killing hespori as checking a hardwood tree. But yeah, it’s still a chance lol (1/5,000) iirc
---
I have a lot of memories (and still listen to a lot of the WoW remixes or originals in some cases), but I'm just surprised people are willing to trust Blizzard with their money after the downward spiral. I can't really say since I stopped playing in Cataclysm (had nothing to do with the game - it was all me), but it seemed like the community was in touch with what they wanted from the game; and Blizzard wasn't listening.
---
Yo momma is soooo fat
---
You need 99 agility just to mount her!!!
---
Why make them instantly recognizable in the first place then?
---
I see you want to have more people bring a few mill risk in a blowpipes to the wildy... ;p
---
You guys have a private forum iirc? I'm sure this has been brought up there. Is Jagex at least aware of it?
---
Yes

He said he liked completing beginner clues and he's done 160 of them, it's plausble to say he got 150 from them from hill giants which have a 1/50 drop meaning he killed 7500 of them, translating to 112,500 XP which is enough to bring you to like 51 prayer. I love this dude's dedication!
---
My thoughts exactly. It's why I am not advocating anyone purchase now. The buff is quite a bit much. I honestly think there will be a revert of some kind which will only cause an influx of jaws.
---
It should just log out if it detect one honestly.

**R E N D I P R O O F**

How about making special pmods called Sentinels, so at every world in ge will be one pmod standing , so all bots will not work anymore
---
Alching leads to inflation. But some fixed alch prices for items that will rarely be alched does not add that much gp to the game. The problem is when they balance a drop table around only alchables (eg. Vorkath, Revs) and not supplies. Zulrah on the other hand has driven some supplies to the ground, but hardly contributes to inflation at all. An hour of zulrah at 25 kph gives approx. 195k gp in alchables from d hallies, d meds, addy bars, and bstaves. The rest of the 2.7m per hr or whatever doesn't produce gp at a glance. My suggestion of a 250k alch item with a 1/128 drop rate and say 75 kph would equate to 147k gp an hour being added into the game if players only ever alched the shield. Stuff like vorkath and rune dragons produce waaaay more coins per hour. Those are unhealthy while zulrah and my suggestion are.  
---
Plus you could always have an associated gp sink involved. They could drop a component of the shield, and you pay 600k gp to have it forged by x NPC. For every shield in use, 600k was removed from the game. For every component alched, 250k was brought in.
---
I did SOA and hero's quest using this clan chat a few days ago. There was a guy at Varrock museum with like 200 half certificates helping everyone with SOA and I had a hero's quest partner in like 10min. Definitely the best way to do it.

Even things like gargoyles contribute more to inflation than this would.

&gt;+3
---
I mean it's only +1 above the previous BiS, a serp. (+6 vs +5)Your total str bonus goes from like 153 to 154, and people are *freaking out* lol
---
That first minute is pretty swag, showing lots of neat bugs that I’ve never seen before, and it’s also OC for this video and not something he puts on every video. Also the first 20 seconds of his ad are funny and it’s only another 40 seconds after that, then 37 pure minutes of interesting. Also also plenty of people making videos do the sponsorship stuff at the start. Also also also 
---
&gt;”1:30 before I deemed this video not worth my time”
---
&gt;types up a comment instead, wasting more of his time
---
well that certainly makes tons of sense
---
Anyway rendi’s been around the block long enough, I doubt he needs someone to tell him how long his intro should be or where in the video he should place his ad. The lad does wtf he wants and purposefully eschews tactics to grab viewers with short attention spans and that’s why we like him. Not all content needs to appeal to the internet version of mindlessly surfing through 500 tv channels.

Even if your laptop only has an integrated GPU like is typical with Intel U cpu's, it still makes a huge difference - it turns average 18 fps at the GE to 50 fps on my Dell XPS 13.
---
Real men use ShareX
---
I did that a lot more when my bank total passed 500m.
---
I can kill Vorkath for more xp and 15 times the profit in the same time this monster takes. I wouldn't care about the shitty drop tables if it weren't for that. Why in the hell would anyone do a task that has shitty xp and shitty money? There's zero point.
---
Who would bother being an ironman if you're a pmod lol. They wouldn't be able to show off being a btw which is the main reason for anyone to be a btw. Btw btw.
---
Even black desert online which basically only has trading via their version of the Grand Exchange has gold selling. They butchered their game to shit and still failed at stopping gold sellers.
---
Yes I am accessability wise, OOTL?
---
maybe don't be a fuckin asshat next time
---
Oh, you were botting. 👌🏻
---
I'm actually getting more xp/hr because I often only log in to farm.  100k+ xp in 15 minutes.
---
Ayy, I'm a little surprised motherfuckers.
---
Don't worry people whining over nothing as usual.
---
Turn run off lmao
---
How is it worse dps, when the basilisk has +50 stab defense, and +10 crush? They both have the same attack speed, at 4. 
---
Even for non superiors, it's +30 stab and +0 crush.
---
If I had a bell, I'd be ringing it right now while shouting "Shame, shame, shame!". Please learn to take screenshots - it's 2019. Google "ShareX."
---
Pbr master race

Well he wasn't paraplegic when I put him in there....

---
Don’t listen to them bud, they’re just being fuckin monkeys and using you as a scapegoat when jagex was the one that fumbled the update twice.
---
He did though, at the very start...
---
shopped obviously
---
They are weak to crush to stab fyi.
---
I made some edits as to not mislead people.
---
I totally relate. Right out of the gate it was so rewarding saving up for better pickaxes until I could consistently out-mine what I believed to be bots. 
---
It’s totally about the accomplishment one way or another, grinding or rare drops. Doing the dragon slayer fight coming in with all my own junk was thrilling haha. I’m pretty excited to walk blindly into member’s content pretty soon and do it all over again.
---
Thanks man, back at you
---
Meanwhile my buddy gets two within his first and only 180kc 🤷‍♂️
---
I totally did it too more often when my bank passed 2147m haha 😂
---
Have there been any plans to finish the southern part of the desert?
---
true that this placement is totally unnecessary, but bonds are not bad mtx to be afraid of, because they keep the game alive with a lot more people thanks to a good balance of people who are willing to buy gp in a legit way without risking a ban and players who want to play more and grind bonds, which feeds the paying playerbase.
---
Gearing up in rags/bad gear to fight people. 0 risk for potential reward. People usually dont want to fight raggers.
---
Okay thank you!
---
Thanks!
---
If they weren't optional with an unlock I'd be complaining with everyone else. But since you never have to get them as a task I don't see a problem with them being annoying for 60 slayer.
---
Ah. Dang. Thanks tho.
---
My point is that if a max main isn't making money, then there's no way a lower level is. You've got to be trolling at this point.
---
Jam flex pls fix
---
I'm not saying it should be good profit, especially not anywhere near Zulrah. But it was never good profit, pre or post buff. Their drop table is shite.
---
well glad I made like 60m from basilisk before they got changed
---
pvmer trolling ofc
---
&gt;Yeah you could just buy it, but someone had to get to this point.
---
Wearing the helm requires the quest so even if one buys it they still had to also get to that point.
---
If you have a somewhat decent mouse you can push the scroll wheel Down which equals one click just like the left and right mousebuttons
---
Who gives a shit? Slayer at level 60 isn't about making money.
---
I'm sorry I just wanted the head [https://i.imgur.com/PkyNMbH.png](https://i.imgur.com/PkyNMbH.png)
---
Okay I should of noticed your name. Now it's obvious you're trolling.
---
Dana white what u doing here
---
Any advice?
---
I fucking love Rendi man.
---
Honestly i get just about as hype if not more hype for a new lower the better episode over swampletics.
---
This shit is just so damn entertaining.
---
Can't refute it eh? 
---
Sorry you aren't getting max cash stack every 30 seconds.
---
"Its your stats and gear bro"
---
The bis ranged glove that requires 175 qp and completion of what’s considered to be some of the harder quests in game, and the bis mage necklace that requires 90 something slayer to kill the boss that drops it.
---
Lol cool in-game items like that isn't for peasants like you and I. 
---
Only Streamers and YouTubers get that. 
---
Seriously, they're the only people that have that item. 
---
Jagex said a long time ago they would work on a fix that would let everyone use it, and then never did anything at all about it.
---
I mean there’s a good reason people generally don’t use tentacle, and just upgrade from whip to rapier. Now they do the same with helms.
---
Just a quick Barrows question. I keep seeing everyone say that you want to get 88% reward potential. I've been doing that by doing the usual three skeleton kills.
---
Issue is those three kills put me at 88.7% and add Bolt Racks to the drop table. I can easily do two skeletons and one bloodworm to hit 86.2% instead and remove Bolt Racks. Is the amount of runes you get on 88.7% that much different than 86.2%? If it's not, I don't see the point in adding Bolt Racks to the possible drop table.
---
Don't try too hard
---
86.2 is the sweet spot. 2 skeletons and a bloodworm.
---
funny enough thats exactly why I said "Gold levelling"
---
I noticed BDO heavily restricted player trading, and as a result the RWT sites offered "gold levelling services" instead.
---
You can't win against em unfortunately
---
I can tell the guy raising his hand isn't black, that's a disgusting Mullato cunt. Fucking ugly ass race.
---
Bonds are fine. They don't inject any GP or XP into the game. They're basically people buying memberships for other players in exchange for gold.
---
Isn't Faux a streamer with Pmod?
---
It’s a fantastic feeling that an enamoured head drop at dks is worth more to me than a berserker ring.
---
100% that bitch
---
Regardless of the fact it's a superior, it's still absolutely ridiculous. It seems as though it's like, the only slayer monster that is ACTUALLY difficult to kill that isn't a boss because it's super over stated.
---
Like the reqs to get to and fight them aren't even high, I don't think appropriately leveled players are going to be killing these things even mildly successfully.
---
I can tell the dude with the fro ain't black, that's a disgusting Mullato bitch. Get your nasty race out of here. Fucking scumbags.
---
I can tell that whore isn't white or black, that's a nasty Mullato race bitch. Disgusting.
---
I can tell that guy isn't white, he's a disgusting Mullato. That race is fucking putrid disgusting.
---
Waiting for the new chapter is driving you mad eh?
---
Maybe since its the only p2p skill that affects f2p. (Stamina Regen)
---
??? He said “our last bis” which was SERP. Lol are you mentally okay?
---
I'm in the same boat. I had never played wow before but decided to try it out. Bought a month when it released and I just resubbed while simultaneously cancelling my OSRS membership
---
I can tell that "white" whore isn't actually white, she's a disgusting Mullato bitch. Really putrid and disgusting race.
---
&gt;russian alphabet
---
Nobody is training without a slayer helmet, dharoks or full obsidian either if you have a pink squishy thing between your ears, so what is your point?
---
I can tell Drake isn't black or mexican, he's pure Mullato. Disgusting ass race they are.
---
Well the secret is that you have to perfect the magical arts.  Once you achieve a smidge over 13 million experience in the magic skill you can then use the skill cape of magic. 
---
Which allows you to spellbook swap 5 times a day
---
&gt; Regardless of the fact it's a superior, it's still absolutely ridiculous.
---
Yes, I said that in my comment. 
---
&gt;Like the reqs to get to and fight them aren't even high, I don't think appropriately leveled players are going to be killing these things even mildly successfully.
---
Yeah, it's basically Demonic Gorillas 2.0, but with a less stable loot system.
---
Make it a 1/25000 chance from charging a spade at the fountain of rune
---
well unrelated to shower length but you don't actually get autologged after 5 minutes if you're in combat. its easily possible to afk nmz for 15 minutes at a time.
---
It took me a week and well over 1000kc for a dragon defender. I went from base 60 att/str/def to 70 att/str and 65 def
---
Around 150 kc here and 3 shards all within 20 kills of each other...sorry
---
Whats ur kc?
---
Why does that make a difference tho
---
IN B4 BRONZE LIMBS
---
lol fire max cape
---
I actually had no idea that this was a thing, and coincidentally I’m roughly an hour and a half off from 99 magic right now. Awesome.
---
I finally got mine an hour ago at 120 cb (i suck ik) two bits of advice that helped me most was to switch pray to range whenever he's not doing mage since you have more time to switch to mage pray and to do one thing at a time like wait until he does an attack, switch pray, hit healer, go back to focusing on prayer.
---
The wildy course isn't dead content. It's the fastest agility XP from 47 (if boosting) to 60 agility.
---
Farming was my first 99 lol, and because of farming I can level up herblore and profit. Just less than if I sold the herbs, but its still more efficient than selling herbs buying other herbs. I havent played in months but I miss OSRA everyday, its fun to stay in the loop on all this drama at least =). Cheers, I liked your comments.
---
yes
---
You really don’t know what you’re talking about 😂
---
It's not wrong at all wearing mystics at barrows, it's already great magic bonus.
---
Gz bro! Thats probably my favorite one. Can’t wait til I can give it a go
---
A
---
bro 😎💪
---
I call that mercy
---
&gt; when vorkath and zulrah are faster kills *than a 60 slayer monster*
---
Yeah, I agree that the kill-time is excessive here and needs a nerf. 
---
But FYI, this is not a normal 60 Slayer Basilisk Knight. 
---
This is a Superior Basilisk Sentinel. 
---
I'm not sure why so many people in this thread are commenting like this is the normal Basilisk Knight. It's pretty clearly not one.
---
All memes aside I would 100% support locking it behind diaries to the point where you can only “sacrifice yourself” x amount of times per day scaling on diary completion with elite being infinite, this is a minority opinion I’m sure tho
---
One time i had my cannon but wasnt using it because i was afking a little bit while i was busy and a guy showed up dropped his cannon and demanded i hopped so i just stood near him, dropped my cannon and kept going. He called me a smart ass and when it was clear to him i wasnt going anywhere he hopped and i just went back to what i was originally doing
---
SirPugger just made a video discussing exactly this
---
Notice I said I joined late.  None of you goofballs were posting, so I did
---
And he kept buying prices for the money people donated, so he didnt lose any money from his own pocket. Obvious scam.
---
Post your stats
---
The loot from the kill was only 6k.
---
if this  guy also doesn't give you a bond i'll take one off him
---
How does xp per hour matter when you're post 99?
---
Right if people are dumb enough and greedy enough to fall for this, leave them to it.
---
Making use of bot services a bannable offence with enforcement would probably do a lot to kill the industry
---
The whole point to use a alt is so you can play ur main on the live game at the same time, lose no ehp that way dumbo
---
dude revs are already 7m a hour, how much more gp do you need to get from them?
---
Guess what group Ironman is available. All you have to do is create accounts and play how you want to play.
---
I think he releases one every year now.
---
yes but meme the scammerboy as well, rip max main for $100 worth of gold.
---
I did! I want leagues and will find it fun. Maybe stop thinking everything revolves around you! :)
---
Sign me up
---
Private servers don't have the scale osrs has and can hack together half assed solutions with no risk
---
Most of my superiors have given me shit loot
---
Because you go for 200m? Why does xp/hr ever matter? To do something faster. That's why.
---
Petition to teach basic spelling skills to members of 2007scape
---
What kind of competitions?
---
none of them are dignified enough to shit in a bag. pants only
---
If the posers above can't buy you a bond sheeeeet I gotchu message me
---
What happens to the trident on a pvp death in deep wildy? If I use it for mage arena 1 for example and I get rushed, assuming I don't get skull tricked and its protected on death, does it lose any charges?
---
Oh I would love to see him get banned, but Jagex will just tell you not to hand over gp unless you are receiving the item. Kinda like a trust trade really, Hence why hes been doing this for days.
---
Isnt that the fake rapier lol
---
Well if you want the recolor then I guess you'd just have to suck it up and spend a few hours getting less than max xp.
---
considering its 1/50 it shouldnt take too long with decent gear
---
you need 130 str atk
---
Lmao they made chaos elementals from RuneScape a real thing
---
Yeh I raid with neitz too. But that same logic can apply to serp all raid too, as means shamans you don't need Sanfew, and you deal venom damage which makes rooms like mystics faster.
---
Hmm. Oh, I see what's going on here. I get the vibe that you're one of those "big brain" types that think they can get by without proper education and resent anyone who does. Your "ROFL" is dripping with it, along with extreme salt of course.
---
Anyway, fact is, game design is a science. It's not MY science, it is factually a science. And the fact is, power creep is bad game design. Heck, I knew that before I even started classes and its such a basic concept, it was covered freshman year and was treated as a "duh" subject.
---
Like, its just pure ignorance to swear up and down that its not. It's not an opinion, it has nothing to do with me. Power creep is bad game design, that's a fact.
---
You don't need to be a "god among men" to understand that very simple concept. But thank you for the compliment that you think a person with average intelligence is a god among men according to you.
---
H
---
Or I could "suck it up" and use useful rewards as content to encourage new agility methods instead of a level 50 course and that course alone.
---
Actually have proper bot detection, maybe hire more than just Weath for a multi-million dollar company
---
I know its not an easy task, but we’ve just accepted that its impossible to deal with botters at this point, yes X amount never make it off tutorial island etc, but the reality is AC and botting is an arms race, one we’ve just given up on.
---
You sure you didnt get absurdly drunk?
---
A few hours of playing a game with little attention. Such a no lifer.
---
Indeed it's very hard to dodge even when paying full attention, I find myself walking a tile   
---
after every attack to eventually dodge it when it happens else I fail to dodge like half the times and you can clearly see you've clicked before it reaches you but you just don't move and get hit...
---
True, certainly is a pair of rune limbs. Unsure on context
---
And yet it's the highest difficulty Jagex gives to their quests, making it by Jagex's definitions high-level content.
---
wait TIL so i have been typing my password in its correct form for well over many months
---
a 600 total level ironman is better than your shitty ass main account
---
Tentacle is bis for monsters weak to slash
---
Banning the bots is useless though since they are just throwaway lvl 3s, i hope jagex bans the actual players that are abusing those bots
---
Try and open a support ticket. It's worth a try but this usually does not work as it suppose to.
---
Are you stupid or pretending to be stupid?
---
I'd say Jagex staff would be a good start.
---
any reward that carries over to the live game makes it part of the actual game............
---
And this mentality right here is why PvP polls are going to be implemented as integrity changes sooner rather than later. You're hurting legitimate pkers who don't partake in these things with your mentality.
---
That feel when you have to bring a DWH to a slayer task.
---
buying death runes in F2P shops and selling them to the GE whilst flipping is like 300k an hour.
---
RuneFest is TOMORROW! 
---
What are you hoping we'll announce?
---
Same got maced for zgs 30 seconds after trying entering revs to pk.
---
&gt; despite what people say you couldn't just copy paste and boom it works.
---
If anyone really thinks this, they need to be hit upside the head real hard. Getting that shit working in the first place isn't easy much less restoring to an earlier build especially since they probably don't even have the same people from when that patch was live.
---
Voting no for this reason just hurts the majority who don't do these things. Don't be surprised when they inevitably do something about PvP polling because of people with your mentality.
---
How to open a support ticket? Sorry never done this before :/
---
Security updates
---
DMM was so popular you had people doxing, ddos'ing, feeding kills, muling, etc etc.  So much integrity that anyone who did win just came down to who managed to cheat the most.  The views DMM was pulling isnt even worth mentioning and dont even scratch the surface to games like wow, dota, league, fortnight, etc.
---
My laptop is a 768p screen and i use resize able and my draw distance is about 45-50.
---
Its actually just gonna make them do that even more because there's no other content to do.
---
Grandmaster is the highest difficulty Jagex gives to their quests
---
What? That's like saying all pvmers and skillers are cheat client users with no sense of game integrity wharsoever.
---
Bounty hunter for the 5th year in a row?
---
Account security
---
and they'll be polled! and cosmetic! amazing, right?
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209198029-Contact-Customer-Support
---
It is the same page for OSRS and RS3
---
Well, considering the superior drops the helm at a 1/267 rate and zulrah drops the old BiS helm at a 1-512 rate, i really dont see your point? It is a better helm that takes almost half the time to get
---
you ever planning on doing runefest in a country where a majority of your player base is located or nah?  would be nice to experience it unless you guys enjoy hanging out with the same locals each year.
---
Casual players buy gold cause they dont wanna waste time grinding some boss, so i can imagine it being the same for every other bit of mtx
---
Show off, lasting 30 seconds.
---
raids 3 or range cape bis inferno
---
Your line of logic is like saying no to new pvm updates because gold farmers will be able to make more money.
---
I don’t need a scout not also where did I admit that lmao??? It’s probably lol cards logging into you. As if a pk clan scouts pvmers you moron
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360002267798
---
Lock wildy behind wildy diaries
---
zulrah and demonic gorillas are not mid level content
---
So by your logic you can’t have a base f2p account level above 1 as skills locked behind account limitations stop you levelling member skills? Please stop
---
sorry you lack the basic understand what base means.
---
Remember don't fuck it up. Read slowly and remember first place is the last place you will mention
---
Oh yeah lol forgot about that
---
Som pvp update that will ultimate fail the polls
---
sorry you have double digit IQ
---
I agree with my mum
---
Doesn't have to be a troll post.
---
Reddit brainlets eat this shit up, whatever to fuel the echo chamber hate, so they'll take any retarded and completley false argument.
---
As a member there are many much easier ways to gather pure essence. Of the top of my head you can get some every day after doing a diary and perhaps konar slayer can give you about 5000 in one drop and as you get to later game achievements the chambers of xeric give you a lot (i got about 120k of em just chilling there)
---
detached camera is still there for me
---
Scariest thing I can imagine..
---
i agree that because most people dont use many capital letters in practice that for practical purposes it doesnt help most people. 
---
but its objectively wrong to say it doesnt help at all.
---
the ideal solution would be to allow pasting passwords into the password field, to easily use a password manager
---
And this is WITH the slayer helmet bonus. Even the quest boss fight was faster.
---
to be completely fair, hotel, food, travel costs are a hell of alot cheaper to go to anaheim then it does to go to north east Hampshire
---
&gt;your
---
yeah, thats you :)
---
And how much you lose in runes for a rex kill? Rex has the high kill value, but how many kills of rex can you do? Theres considerable downtime.
---
if you are not a member you cant train the skill, what is stopping you from training above 45 def... nothing.
---
Wanted to show how grounded he is as an individual...
---
FML
---
also it takes like 2 mins max, more like a min if you have good gear
---
free seeds, pet and bucket chance, anima for herb runs
---
The CHAD SQUAD
---
and you apparently have single?  not hard to try and change subjects in an argument and result to belittling.
---
he made it aound like only that superior gave shit loot, forgive me
---
some pmods muted bad mouths, but it wasn't supposed to be used to do that
---
I got the pmod status removed after quitting cuz I lost bank from a clan war lure in rs2, sad no more status signaling
---
**Menaphos**
---
Nah.  The Fake rapier has a different attack animation.
---
Another quest in the sea slug storyline!
---
ROFL ye -5 range accuracy is not gonna make you useless at raids.
---
But as I've said I camp neitz.
---
Just don’t be a low or mid level then? Like if you can get together 5m for obby and 60/60/60 combats you can nmz to 90/90/60 in like a month???
---
I remember being a F2P, a simpler time indeed. Doesn't matter that I was piss poor, but at least things like polls, basilisks and other fancy schmancy stuff didn't bother me.
---
worked in the security field for abit, case sensitivity is such a small jump in security, they might as well just go to increasing character lengths or adding symbols.
---
Had a player who was most likely Venezuelan crash me doing Slayer w a Cannon. I placed my own to see if he would maybe realise what im hinting at, he did eventually but I would've left if not. Don't think it was intentional and I wouldn't give people ammunition by typing aggressively.
---
&gt;  a majority of your player base is located 
---
British game does their con in Britain, who knew? Next at 11, water is wet.
---
You want the rev caves, wily bosses, chaos altar, all to be single combat? Lol
---
All my posts mysteriously disappearing? Lay off whatever your on mate, or get a new pair of glasses. I've not deleted anything idiot.
---
pretty ambiguous sentence. Abyssal demon takes longer to kill than a boss. Hell, a lot of npc's take longer to kill than a boss. 
---
Keep in mind what he's killing in this video is basically a boss with two 20m+ uniques.
---
Simple question, why down vote not answer , lol?
---
they shoud do this on april first
---
That's because you're toxic, nice post history lmao.
---
Report the bots. I reported as many as I could in lms and they disappeared.
---
Menaphos or basilisk nerfs
---
I’d rather then poll artisan again
---
Knew it! GZ
---
When are they announcing the osrs updates at runefest this year?
---
*mandatory joke*  
---
Which quest unlocks racast5 as a NMZ boss?
---
that the next runefest won't be in the middle of nowhere
---
My nan has a pair of bronze limbs in her bedside table
---
Had time to watch some, scroll down read all the comments and the video still hadn't finished.
---
A new official client
---
Is there a specific rotation
---
if not, I might not ever farm them... I cannot react instantly
---
How do you change the GE price text color? The default blue on El is tough to read.
---
No one's going to be playing on the vanilla content, they made a post a couple days ago saying 3p clients are fine, with some extra ambiguous text which, for now, means nothing. Nothing's changed, just the crazy op plugins are removed.
---
All I know is this games is ruined boys, lets make changes for the top 5 players that play on their main and on their alts-alts-alts. Truly garbage, pvp world are still junk, Runescape 3 is basically how many keys your going to buy until your next 99. And to pay 10.99 a month for that. Siiiike Maybe make more positive changes to the game that already exists then holding Runefest and announcing some garbage update nobody wants.
---
My dad coming back.
---
The amount of people who agree with this is scary-- basically the majority of people who enjoy the game are at low/mid level content and probably haven't tried PvP or a boss yet? And those at end game just boss/pk because they don't want to?
---
Fuuuuuuck no hell no wtf??
---
As a 99 woodcutter in RS2 Skilling has always been the short end. Yes prices were higher, but  you also had to save mills for a dragon axe, or one of my first buys back then ( filling my zammy book for around 8m). Hell right now I have 3 f2p accounts with all over a mill from Skilling in a few daya. Dont punish others because you dont play properly.
---
Have you ever done crafting?
---
Probably one of the dumbest fucking things I’ve read in this sub. Bravo.
---
China
---
At that point it's really hard to justify not spending the 11$.
---
Yo mama so fat she has enough chins for 99 range
---
I would like to see you fuckers skill for a piece of GWD gear in actual rs2. Unless you bot or gold farm, that shit took forever. I bet I could do it faster now through Skilling then before.
---
E
---
I'm guessing he booted you off and recovered the account before you tried logging back in.
---
Idk about the guy you responded to but I notice a 1t input delay on mobile. It’s a toss up whether or not I decide to move before the marble ball it shoots hits me, even when I spam click right as it shoots it
---
Only thing that's actually matter.
---
Heraldic dragon helm, dragon spade, mithril 3h, dragon loooooong sword, longer bones, full frog outfit, ring of frog, frog pet
---
That's a weird way to spell dead content
---
Lol, what a DICKBRUH
---
Damn ended his whole career
---
Max strength but with serp, 3 chally specs and bp for flowers. Managed to skip 2nd flower phase entirely with massive last spec.
---
just because rendi took 3 years to do it doesn't mean its a viable option, why even mentino it
---
Why test things when they’ve got 100,000 beta testers already?
---
L0l
---
Thanks
---
Slayer be like that sometimes.
---
I’m all for Jagex making the game a grind and not insanely easy, but this is overkill lol
---
Jiggleflox can shove these up their arse’s after the basilisk update
---
Lol that edit has me dying
---
Cute
---
Alright, ill correct myself
---
Way more casual players buy gold than dedicated players. You happy?
---
Ty for the link OP, my mistake
---
See all this of makes me not even want to do the quest anymore. I grinded the stats for it last week but honestly if this is what it’s like for a level 60 slayer monster then yeah I’m good.
---
Oh fuck run!
---
I know the feeling. I like to just log in and chop wood or raise stats when I'm bored. Maybe once I raise all my F2P stats and get some extra time I'll spring for a membership.
---
Where is the gold sink? Gold changes hands but never leaves the game
---
I couldn't do the new quest boss on mobile. Facing the other way before getting hit when the screen turned red felt impossible. Went on the pc, did it first time without getting hit once.
---
D
---
And to prove your point useless, 62^5 is not significant in comparison to just adding another length of character instead, as 36^6 is an order of magnitude greater than 62^5
---
Them dropping a BiS helmet with their old hp and defense was balanced in my opinion. This is overkill lol. Have you killed them pre-nerf and post-nerf? The difference is absurd
---
I hope, as much as I like the idea of only using things from Zeah I don't think you can access everything without having to make certain changes and additions
---
I get what you're saying, but this is a video game, not real life. A big part of osrs is the grind, making that easier is what brought on rs3 and nobody wants that. I personally don't care if they make minor changes, I just didn't really like your comparisons is all
---
I wanna say that I saw a UIM smithing method that made money buying mith + coal and alching platebodies, but I'm not 100% positive on that. It was awhile ago so I could be remembering it wrong but worth checking out if making gold is too expensive for you.
---
Turmoil?
---
Lock yews behind avas shield quest!!
---
Throw in some consequential decisions too, like they toyed with in Forthos.
---
It randomly pops into my head but nobody I know understands :(
---
Apparently everyone in the comments is saying rapier is still better according to DPS calculators. And I had auto retaliate on if you watch closely lol
---
reminds me of when i took around 5 minutes to kill a repugnant spectre. solid mob design by jagex
---
No problem boblem
---
Group ironman has been released since 2004. Just start new accounts with your boys and only trade amongst yourselves. Voila. No engine work required.
---
Was just a silly comparison. But for real you can still get a torso on a lvl 3 sure you need 40 defence and 25m andit takes an hour to get but still BiS.
---
Get on with it
---
Look at how tedious at youtube did his zeah only ironman. i personally thought that was a lot more fun than having access to a anti-fire shield
---
Yeah wait till 92 and make sure its elite void
---
Thanks smartarse:)
---
But the neckbeards will say it devalues all their hard work.
---
Welcome to RuneScape
---
Time for my obligatory Jad tip, watch his back left foot. If it raises at all, its range. If it doesn't, its mage. Lets you know about a tick earlier and less likely to confuse the brain.
---
Absolutely join WeDoRaids discord. 
---
Power through the initial few raids, since getting all the minimum required gear can be annoying (for example they don't allow void setups from my experience) and waiting for a mentor can take a good hour. 
---
Just started learning last week and already at 25 kc!
---
They would have to change all the PvM content in the wildy, like boss safe spots. As much as I would love this update and always toggle it on while in the wildy, I don't think this  would be good for the game either.
---
n00b
---
Honestly I just did regicide for the first time ever and i boosted 52 agility with summer pies. Underground pass was more annoying than anything else.
---
These 4 come to the club and slap ur gfs ass, what do you do
---
It’s OSRS in a nutshell. If the nutshell has +500 defensive stats
---
Well, you keep everything in the blowpipe in the wild on death so that's not really the matter here...
---
Try it with dcb?
---
How exactly did you know what you voted for when not a single piece of statistic detail/animation was released for the knights?
---
This is what you voted for;
---
&gt;Should completion of The Fremennik Exiles unlock access to the dungeon on the Island of Stone as described in the blog? This dungeon will contain dagannoths, basilisks and basilisk knights.
---
and the blog post mentions this:
---
&gt;The basilisk knights are split across two rooms which are singleway combat with no cannons allowed. The basilisk knights, featured in the quest, can be fought after completion as part of basilisk slayer tasks. **They will have a better drop table including a unique item, the basilisk jaw, that can be used to make a Neitiznot Faceguard.**
---
This is what wolf proposed to you, the issue everyone had was that it dropped a overly BIS item considering they could have been farmed people (the streamers and twitter) babyragers you mention mostly asked to nerf the fucking helm if you're going to make them so afk/farmable.
---
Also good thing the persons judgement you trusted got fired day after release of his quest. Yikes.
---
Thanks. My mom thinks I’m special
---
Started recording 10-20 seconds into the kill btw
---
Fellow P mod here... I have no "job" on runescape.  I am not contracted, hired, compensated, or affiliated with Jagex in any way shape or form.  I have the ability to place a 1 hour mute on anyone I choose, but only choose to mute those who are toxic/flaming others out for no reason.  I can choose to mute a dicing but but I don't HAVE to.  At the end of the day, I was a normal player selected to \*help\* keep the community/game chat clear of unwanted/unnecessary messages.  Again it's not a job, and if I don't mute someone I don't get penalized or reprimanded in any way.  I think people credit player moderators for way more than we actually are able to do.
---
I wont argue xp rate changes. However i feel like there needs to be better way to train skills. Eg construction is make remove make remove 1 item over and over again its dumb. Runecrafting needs an alternative i get wanting a grind but better ( less annoying ways) should 100% come in the game
---
If only lol
---
Literally no cons
---
But God Ash is right there?
---
He was vocal about changes, but he’s not the only one. Can’t solely blame him in my opinion
---
We call that 'base' 50's around these parts
---
20k?! we've been at a steady 60 for 2 years now.
---
got the blessed by the chest one thanks for that song so fucking good
---
Update Java maybe?
---
The higher the level the more miserable it gets.
---
Your a fucking mongo. New as fuck
---
Ohhh I member!
---
ideal your password meets the bare minimum reqs and you just use 2fa on an email
---
How many switches do you usually do in DKs?
---
increasing your character set by 26 will always be better than adding 1 character to your password for reasonable length passwords
---
obviously theres an upper limit to character set increases, especially practically speaking since people arent going to bother with a really obscure password. and the whole point is moot really since no one is bruteforcing rs accounts anyways. but theres no reason for them to not be case sensitive either.

Anything less is a failure IMO
---
It seems to me that Jagex thought it would be funny to make it 50/50 in some low lvl shortcuts, no matter your agility lvl. I'm looking at North Ardy agility shortcut water Log.
---
Oh yeah, definitely! We'd make whatever gear setup you have work for the most part. It'd be no worries.
---
the type of shit this sub doesn't deserve
---
The background work for group ironman is necessary for the clan rework. Content that pretty much half the playerbase or more could benefit from, and also background work that could be used for group content of any sort in the future.
---
Like imagine non janky ways to have raid teams, to "group find" for minigames like BA etc.
---
Also just because you don't see any appeal in group ironman doesn't mean it's not obviously incredibly popular of an idea in the community.
---
Being pedantic and saying "well you stand alone so you can't have help from others!" Is silly when even standard mode does minigames and raids with players.
---
And now they're literally a gp deficit even when you're paying attention. Another batch of mid-level content that was knee-jerk nerfed into being dead content because maxed sweaties and content creators without a clue complained on twitter about it.
---
Are you announcing Jagex' shifting focus into a construction company?
---
RuneFest is themed as fossil island for RS3 this year. Hence the island aesthetic.
---
Welcome to 2019 where almost everyone is depressed and there's no difference between enjoyment and getting some dopamine for once. Actually yeah, mental illness sounds about right.
---
Can agree with the first half of what you’ve said this game is being ruined by people who want to be looked at above everyone else for an achievement in a game.
---
Cool bro have you fucking achievement I give no fucks I just want to play the game grind everything out and enjoy myself and not have someone coming up to me being a fucking douche because they have no life outside of this damn game and they have to revert to being a shit head because they have better gear? Who fucking cares play the game your way and stay in you fucking lane all you guys are like drunks who want to call their ex’s when you know it’s a bad idea but you do it anyway.
---
Don’t give anyone ideas
---
I mean she a dude
---
thinking of it now, group iron man could make for some really cool league ideas
---
Mid levels doing konar who don’t have money to throw away for EHP don’t agree. This game isn’t a safe space for maxed mains getting slayer EHP with cannons tbf.
---
Cool
---
You can have a big group and all trade together so if one of you goes dry, you aren’t screwed. Plus, items are actually worth something to other people in your group versus the 2 gp flax is at rn
---
the power of the knights was not polled u dummy. stop crying.
---
benis :D
---
banning the main clans that use the bots would cure this realllll quick
---
legit, crazy dedication. I also respect you for doing it your own way and not doing the fastest ways.
---
Are yall gunna reveal why so many devs are leaving
---
It isn't the same as no GE at all. It would be a defined group that you start out with. People typically say 2-4 people. I would personally not mind the idea of clan sizes if you wanted. It could make the game feel a lot more tight nit, and could be interesting.
---
Ah, NEET incel exposed.
---
Yay more whining!
---
Did you seriously downvote me and say it's better to have less options and security behind your passwords?
---
God please don't be a system admin or developer.
---
Yes I have a password and auth Dad, now stop getting angry at people for saying "wouldn't it be nice that it offered all of this so everyone was happy..Joe blow wanting hunter222 to be his password can continue to do so, and Anton who wants a 16 character randomised string that he changes every month can also do that."
---
Skilling slayer might be fun but it's not exactly killing anything
---
Here's a brief bit about wave priority - always pray mage last lvl 30, if that's when the mage spawns. Use a dps prayer like eagle eye on the ranger, he should go down fast. You only want to tank the ranger briefly. 
---
Never attack what you are praying against unless you have no other options. If you have a mage a range and a melee, try to dps the range then get the melee to a safespot asap. You can also use the mage as a body block to keep the melee stuck, but be sure to stay out of the mage's melee range, which could be hard on a short range weapon like the twisted blowpipe
---
Lmfao, account banned for baiting too many people in too many subreddits.

That's bad. I think wilderness is one of the most important places to enforce game rules at.

There are wildy scouts as 3rd party plugins too and they display your risked wealth and value of your +1 too.
---

---
low-key I don't upvote or downvote anyone, I'm too lazy. And yeah I just find it pointless to be this paranoid over a RuneScape account
---
Grats and gl on the inferno!!! Did you get that ss and acb that trip? or were you using the acb and using a bp to heal off minions, i can't really tell.
---
As a f2p player, what stats are good enough to go into pvp using range/2h hybrid? Currently at 60 range, 40 att. 35 str is what I'm levelling atm.
---
totally worth
---
FUCKING LEO

A fire max cape loool

You are using rapier with no crush attack, these are weak to crush/range maybe try something else.

Tomorrow. He literally posted the schedule which answers your question.
---

---
For real tho we need a GM quest to tie up all the zarosian/mahjarrat lore.
---
huh? Even at a length of 5, 36^6 has double the permutations of 64^5
---
I think they plan on having a quest for every area, and likely some experienced/master quests to tie them all in to a single story against Xerox/the powers that be on Zeah and a grandmaster to wrap it all up
---
Lul
---
verzik ;p
---
For casual slayer, I'd go with Obsidian legs and a torso, if you're affording Justicar legs then just go with tassets at that point. Otherwise don't mess with Justicar unless you get the full set.

Only people I still know playing classic wow are raiders. Almost everyone and their dog is playing shadowkeep rn. I was having fun afking basilisks while playing destiny but that’s a dead meme now.
---
I also loved and miss dungeoneering, but maybe bring it back as a minigame instead. Avoids people getting up in arms over it being a skill.
---
Add a leveling aspect like in barb assault instead of skill leveling to keep the content gates on the major milestones. Pest control style rewards maybe? New mid-tier set, redeem points for skill experience instead of combat experience?
---
Try uninstalling it in Programs and Features and then instal it again

Isnt Weath the name the whole bot hunting team use so they don’t use their personal jmod names and potentially get irl threats?

No shackles in sight this year. Pleased to say I'll be presenting the GGA for Best New Videomaker, and I'm presenting one of the OSRS reveals too...   
---
EXCITED.
---
My game interests vary, but they include challenging and grindy games. I have a couple friends who’ve played since they were kids and they’ve shown me the game from time to time recently. I’ve been interested for a little while but finally sat down and made an account a few months ago and was surprised how much I liked it.  I think having irl friends to help me not be totally lost helped a lot. Lol they really insisted I didn’t make an Ironman for my first account but I’m glad I did
---
And no offense to to OSRS at all, but I kind of find the not so graphically-appealing style to be kind of charming after actually playing it. Again no offense to anyone out there lol but it kind of reminds me of Minecraft, how everything looks simple by nature of the design but really the world is very detailed and interesting. That’s all to say I like OSRS’ art
---
Nice mate! I could use some of your dedication myself :").
---
that's the fbi
---
Still, you don't know the intricacies of their interest or lack of thereof, so passing judgement is just shitty behavior. You are acting like a devil sitting on his/her shoulder saying the happiness won't last since the friends playing is just temporary. If you know that your friends won't be sticking around, that's fine and it's nice of you to try and stay realistic about it. But projecting that feeling to others isn't. Even if it is realistic.
---
As an OSRS player, you dont have friends. That's an official rule
---
 Normal Ironman = High value account.  Group Ironman = Do it unnoffically because having friends that would actually play with you sucks. I mean what are you basing this on, talking about some high or low values, when all we want is to play with our friends and have it official like normal Ironman. Is it so hard to see that its not that much different.
---

What is the problem with the jaw dropping from a Lv 60 slayer monster? Helmets have historically **always** been the cheapest piece of BiS melee gear bar Capes/Defenders because those do not have a cost associated with them. If Serp wasn't tied to the scale price it would be at alch value (66k) already.
---
The point went over your head, too.

Group Ironman. Even if it's not even close with the engine adjustments, it would be nice to have a more in-depth talk about it.

Okay then make it a 90 Slayer task and everybody can shut up about it. And what "master quest"? 65 crafting? 60 smithing? Oh, boy.

hi, rs3 player here, trash hunter will mostly give u xp lamps and other untradeable garbo, best thing to do with the keys is just spin them random or keep them unspun incase you ever do decide to join rs3, im fairly certain they wont give you any benefit on os :/

---
MM2 is a grandmaster quest with requirements in the 60s so that’s a moot point. 
---
As a matter of fact black demons don’t have a set slayer level yet gorillas can be assigned after the quest with no point requirements or slayer level req other than the 69 slayer from the quest. 
---
Gorillas are harder than basilisk knights yet effectively only require 69 slayer to do.
---
Quick feet, ranged. Loong feet, mage.

i didnt want my first one to be kraken :P nothing wrong with it just everyone in my CC has it so i wanted to be a snowflake :P
---
You telling me 55 RC isn't endgame?
---
Yes and no.
---
Over the long term that's like an extra 4k xp/h (assuming you aren't already maxed combat), which isn't amazing but it's pretty decent.
---
There's also the fact it  has higher attack bonuses, so your DWH specs are slightly more likely to land. Granted, it's only an extra +5 crush bonus, but still.
---
Basically in the term of avernic... If 80m is a significant amount for you, it's not worth it. I'd recommend most other upgrades over avernic first, including things like tbow.
---
Thank you

yes because botting is a problem specific to pvp

Respectfully, I disagree again. Rigour range tanks could and did go against Turm pures (I had a Turm pure) and with a 60 attack 70 def 95 prayer build you wouldn't be fighting Piety pures anyway since you'd be 25 prayer levels ahead.
---
I feel like you're basing this on RS2 not OSRS, sure a maxed 1 def is going to get whacked by a Turm pure but saying it limited people's playing is incorrect. That's like saying "If you're not using Piety now you won't stand a chance" which also isn't true. Sure, people might struggle as a maxed zerker v a Piety med but they can still be 1 ticked with MSB &gt; AGS.
---
Turmoil did give a very powerful attack bonus but at 40 defence you're still not blocking a claws/h.ballista spec with Turmoil.
---
These are my own thoughts and I did have experience with it when it was a thing, you're well in your rights to disagree though I just think if we're more open minded about the availability of different weapons (D.Knives etc.) in different brackets there's a different meta to RS2.
---
It's not punishing PKers for PKing in a PKing area, it's telling Jagex that they need to stop putting non PKing out there.
---
Yeah fucking sick nerd had a fucking fit about this every day on Twitter. All that man wants is harder content to keep people entertained on stream so he can make a living.
---
Construction 2?!?!
---
Jad is honestly pretty basic. 
---
I’m not even good at Jad and I literally just did my second ever kill last night so I probably shouldn’t preach but I will share my experience as I struggled at first. 
---
My first successful kill took about 4 or 5 attempts however I’ve only every died before getting to the last wave once. After my first successful kill I obviously stopped doing fight caves as I had the cape. Now probably 6 month later I wanted another cape to unlock the inferno song for my music cape. Literally in 1 attempt I cleared the caves and snagged my second cape. Jad never hit me once. 
---
The point of the story is that the first kill is really the only challenging kill. Don’t get me wrong, it isn’t easy by any means as you can mess up one prayer flick and get one hit like your story describes. But there really isn’t any reason you should mess up your flicks. His attacks are fairly slow enough to easily maintain your rhythm. 
---
The biggest thing holding you back is YOURSELF not Jad. After spending an hour or so to get to Jad it is very easy for anxiety to run high. Your heart rate increases, your muscles tighten, and your focus shatters. Which makes it very easy to miss click and very hard to be in control of what is happening during the fight. The biggest mechanic to successfully killing Jad is to stay as chill and calm as you can. 
---
Here is what I would suggest to make the kill go as smooth as possible. 
---
-Log out before the double magers
---
-Take 5 min to clam down and de-stress. (Do whatever you need to do, walk around, lay down, stretch, jerk off (im serious), etc. )
---
-log back in and kill the first mager and get second to half hp
---
-Now drink a full brew, sip your restore and range pot, turn on eagle eye, switch to rune cbow and diamond bolts e (if you were using blowpipe) and then kill the last mage. Cbow has better distance and will help get the Jad healers without stepping in melee distance. 
---
-when Jads wave starts immediately pray range. You need to find him quickly and listen for his mage attack (Jad spawns where the orange mager spawned in the previous wave)
---
-dont attck Jad! Focus on your prayer switches. Once you have a comfortable rhythm, attack Jad
---
-keep switching until healers spawn. Attack them all (one at a time) and then kill all of them. (Yes you can out dps them but for a beginner they do too much damage on you and complicates things)
---
-only aggro one healer at a time in between prayer switches. Remember prayer is first priority, everything else is secondary. 
---
-when healers are gone maintain your pray switch rhythm for a bit and then attack Jad when you are ready. 
---
-literally just focus on his attacks and your prayers until he goes down. 
---
-cape achieved
---
Remember when the guy from RS (now osbuddy) became a Jmod? Bots died and stayed dead, yeah there were still a few but less than 5% of what there was before hand. 
---
It's 100% possible, they just need to pay someone what they're worth to do it. Someone who could do it averages \~120k+ a year vs Jmods who get a fraction of that. It's why there are so many botters, they can easily make good money selling GP. I knew a guy who makes a good 30k a year side cash making scripts in his free time. His real job he makes over 100k and has good benefits. He told me that he could make more money making scripts and botting himself if he wanted to but health care isn't free so it's not worth it.
---
Haha I can’t attest to it being afk, yeah it doesn’t take hyper focus but if I’m not paying attention I die
---
But not me, I wear a trilby.
---
I dont know why but I hate this song, the voice cracking and terrible high notes makes my ears bleed
---
It's been stated in q&amp;as. Iirc wolf was discussing the inability to put easter eggs on examine options and ash commented that that was because examines were done clientside.
---
I thought you can examine stuff in the bank?
---
Cats, can troll splashers and exchange for Death runes, so it's actually useful.
---
Yeah which is different how than just trading with your friends? Temptations of using the GE? What happens when 3 out of the 4 people in your group quit? You can't swap out players. 
---
It sounds like another unnecessary game mode.

I totally agree, it's pretty bad and she honestly cant sing

its not false however, because if you keep killing them you will get jaws. Obviously you can get dry but if you do 80000 kills you're expected to get 100 jaws.
---
Hey all. Long time on and off player. Don't even know when I originally started but was between runecrafting and slayer coming out. Loved the game and then quit for a long time after the free trade removal. Heard it was reversed and came back to squeal of fortune which immediately turned me off again. Came back much later when it was turned to treasure hunter, still hated that but tried to get back into the game. Used the free keys and over time just felt like my account was 'ruined'. Eventually rolled an ironman account and I've been enjoying it but, idk. Just feels like RS3 is going down and down with no signs of improvement.  
---
Long story short. Here I am wondering if it's worth taking a dip into old school. I think the real things I will miss are just the quality of life things. The tool belt is great as are lodestones. Is there any large QoL things that made it to OS? I have tried to read up as much as I could but the game is so huge it becomes hard to keep the RS3 and OS information different in my mind.

I definitely need to go try for a fire cape again. Last time I tried, I had just hit 75 range but had no blow pipe. I think I was just using blessed d'hide, rune cbow and a glory/fury. 
---
Now I'm at 94 ranged with blowpipe, arma helm, anguish etc lol. I definitely need to get back in there and take another shot at it
---
It’s so funny how mad you got by being wrong. 
---
Thank you for the laughs my dude
---
I'd say 3-84 low tier, 85-105/110 medium, and 111+ high. 
---
85 to start medium because I think minimum quest cape requirement is a good starting point to be medium tier and anything over 110 or around there for late/end game purposes.
---
Just a personal opinion though
---
Skill aspect...osrs. Even ignoring all the plugins from these 3rd party clients.
---
The bar for talent is low with this one.
---
Hoping the announcement of the area loot bug being fixed.
---
I’d let Enakhra tie me up UwU
---
The task felt like bloodvelds... I sat there watching twitch and occasionally sgs specing, drinking pots and eating occasionally.
---
This post was saying that the kills take to long and their too difficult even for mains and i was arguing that their pretty afk
---
Sometimes people just want to use slayer to train melee, they can't use the cannon for that but doesn't mean they should be crashed
---
20 or 30 FPS is more than enough for most activities. I do Bandos and other GWD on 30, everything else on 20. It runs smooth enough, with not the input lag you would think
---
&gt; If the unique drop is that rare on a drop table with nothing else going for it, it's safe to say you can probably ignore it when calculating hourly gp.
---
How are you enjoying your first couple of months in the game so far?
---
&gt;You factor in uniques on bossing because A) that's usually the only reason why you're grinding the boss
---
Nah dude, if a unique drop is that rare on a drop table with nothing else going for it, it's safe to say you can probably ignore it
---
Just play Moparscape, EZ
---
Hear me out — maybe the problem is how easy they are to kill, not how hard this is to kill.
---
Uh, no, I'm gonna complete this quest pretty soon as a 87.  Just need to train some mining so I can do Lunar Diplomacy so I can train RC.
---
My best gear setup consists of dscim, ddef, neitznot, barrows gloves, and rune armor.  These comments are really discouraging because I don't think I can kill these things without a ton of ppots and I just wanted a helmet upgrade.
---
I agree with that. But this guy is basing his “statistics” all around that drop rate. You can’t get a basilisk slayer task as long as the drop rate is. So therefore you are not guaranteed a jaw and it may take much more time awaiting for a 2nd task if you’re only killing on task. It’s much more than saying “it’s 2m/hr”. I think the basilisks are actually decent money, I’m just saying it’s not 2m/hr and ONLY will be IF you get the jaw.
---
Yeah idk why thats exclusive for her pet. Its giant af

Tips? Ask yourself the following questions:
---
\- What am I doing with my life? 
---
\- Why do I play a game instead of doing something more productive?
---
\- Do I even like the game?
---
\- Why do I have no discipline?
---
\- Am I addicted?
---
\- Am I playing just to pass time?
---
\- Am I even having fun?
---
\- Why am I even playing?
---
If you feel like this game (or any other game) is holding you back from living the way you want to live your life then you got a problem. Games are supposed to be a source of fun to unwind after a hard day. Some people took it further and decided to play games profesionally. Nothing wrong with that. Unless... IT IS INTEREFERING WITH YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE!
---
I personally took a 2 month break and am having a hard time playing it now. To get anywhere in game you need to spend soo much time. I sometimes log in, look at the screen for a few seconds and close runelite.
---
What you need to do is stop feeling attached to the game. Do you maybe feel like you are missing out if you are not playing while your membership is running? In my opinion subscription based games are just as predatory as limited-time microtransactions. Both concepts are based on fear of missing out.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dd7uyd/tips_for_quitting_rs_a_request_to_all/f2emr2p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) comment really hit the nail on the head. Pretty much same thing happened to me. You play and play and then all of a sudden it comes down crashing on you like a wall of bricks. You realize what everything you could spend all this time on and when you look back at how much time you wasted playing few pixels that you even question if you enjoyed the time spend.

In the end nobody gives a shit about your runescape account. Even the runescape community doesn't care. They rather trash talk over you to make themselves feel better. Very few people are genuinely happy for you.

Maybe I'm having a brain fart here, but the way I understand it is the comment above yours is sarcastically telling the commenter he replied to that voting no on the bounty hunter update will just make the hopping problem worse (or maintain the status quo at least). Based on that I thought your comment implied that if there were bounty hunter rewards, the hopping would get worse because otherwise you would simply be agreeing to his implied statement. So you are actually in agreement with the previous comment?

It's a level 95 prayer from the Ancient Curses prayer book (A new one they added back in RS2) it was like a stronger Piety, but there were also other prayers that drained enemy stats, spec bar and most importantly a level 92 version of Smite called Soulsplit (I think) that drained Prayer AND healed you at the same time, it was very very strong.

Well something I've been wanting for a while is a rare item you can find in the last room of pyramid plunder after completing the elite desert diaries which you could add to a pharaoh sceptre to turn it into a sceptre of the gods with unlimited charges, although if a sceptre were to be the best way of getting to the new raid I do think the above would be too high of a requirement for such a useful item
---
&gt; But right now it's around 25m 
---
It's slightly above 20m currently.
---
&gt; Mid level players (75-80 ish combat stats, good but not BIS gear) can easily put out at least 3/4ths the DPS against these guys putting them at 1.4m/hr.
---
No they can't, since they need to food more often. They also need more supplies (pray pot/food) due to the kills taking longer.
---
Damn GG and sire. Some of the worst two in my eyes haha
---
I recommend not doing rc on f2p
---
There are p2p quests which give enough xp to get you off the ground, and then better training methods become unlocked
---
I wouldn't do much more mining on f2p. Everywhere is so botted it's basically a waste of time. Smithing is a good skill to train because other people won't impact your xp rates. Runecrafting is another one I'd like til mems. Just because the training methods are so much more effective, mostly because of pure essence
---
It's an average drop rate. Every mob in the game has a gp/hr based on the average rate of all of its drops.
---
The reqs for that are kicking my ass. Imo thieving is much worse than RC
---
Months of f2p? That's a accomplishment by itself.
---
I've seen toooooo many of these damn bots. Jagex NEEDS to do something about this.
---
That's true. Only higher xp would come from Dark Beast superior, I believe.
---
Gonna go out on a limb here and guess more end-game pvm content locked behind a grandmaster quest? Rewards will include a new blessing that gives +2 prayer and maybe a +2 melee str bonus, a degradable 2h melee weapon that is only useful within the new pvm content itself, some sort of monster body part that can be combined with bandos chest and legs to give each +2 extra prayer and +1 extra melee strength, and of course a new slayer dungeon with a teleport right outside
---
Again, baseless assumptions, random insults, and ignoring the better half of my response whilst cherrypicking things to nitpick.
---
Go be like this somewhere else.
---
Basic order is make 1.1B -&gt; sell for t bow -&gt; but Zenytes/boots/DWH - raid. 
---
Another option is replace t bow with scythe and camp ToB. Avernic is a good upgrade but it’s a last upgrade because buying it sets you back 90M from t bow/Scythe.
---
Really? Because I was browsing Twitter yesterday seeing 'hlc' people saying it was a victory for them. Paraphrasing of course but you get my point.
---
Join "The Nifflers" also reddit user r/lazylnferno for more info
---
obviously the dps change between avernic and dragon def will change depending on what youre fighting, some it will be more some less, but using your numbers.
---
28 seems like a small number but its pretty big, its almost 5%.
---
Imagine you spend 20 hours killing something with the avernic, it would have taken you 21 hours to kill the same number with dragon. Over time that really starts to add up.
---
Its not the first thing you should get, since it cant be resold. you should get bandos/prims etc before avernic, since if you need the cash ever when you arent doing a melee activity, you can resell them. once you have all the other upgrades its definitely worth getting though
---
so this max player thing do
---
You are useless
---
Use a Crush weapon.
---
My problem with them is not that they are bad money, but that they are boring af. I wanted something like demonic gorillas that actually take skill.
---

---
Where I got the numbers from. As for Xp rates for popular methods from left to right is, Cheap trees, Sharks, Wintertodt, Battlestaffs, Redwoods, Magic longbows, Barbarian fishing, Prayer Potions, Dragon bones (afk), Mith/addy dart tips, MLM, Oak doors, Red Chins, Ardy knights, Seer's course, Zeah RC.
---
The Max XP rates are 1-2% below the absolute maximum due to human error, all of these methods are being used even if they aren't really viable for most players like essence runners for RC.
---
Blowpipe is better at bandos anyways, and I'd prefer serp at Cox anyways just so I don't have to pre-pot.
---
and thus making the price of the jaw go up, making it more worthwhile again
---
No, it is perfectly reliable as a mean
---
It just so happens that the standard deviation is really high
---
How do you become ash? First, you have to burn.
---
Nice.
---
Good intro to gear swapping, prayer management etc. The drop tables rely on big ticket items which is always the better drop table in my eyes.
---
Pets are cool, boss displays are cool. List goes on.
---
Wtf Lmao you literally composed that comment 
---
 out of shit you read on this sub, actual brainwashed Reddit sheep 🤦‍♂️
---
Nah, it's from a pk vid on YouTube. Original conversation the guy agrees to be the bf. He gets fucking sacked and then says yes lmfao
---
But nah, the pk is real
---
Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
---
also for the record I don't think the buff to the knights was a good decision by jagex, but I also don't think they should drop the jaw; it should probably drop from a boss or something so it stays in line with how other best-in-slots are obtained
---
That's walking. Not woox walk.
---
If you have 25m and you're worries about the prices of scales, then how'd you get to having BiS anyways?
---
The faceguard is only used by near max players.
---
He gets resurrected as a zombie and must obey every command of his master
---
Lol did they do it the opposite before?
---
Aren't all Mahjarrat Zamorakian? I mean, didn't they start as followers of Zamorak who underwent a ritual to increase their power?
---
Cool artwork, either way!
---
To be clear, it's not really that bothersome to me. I am just taking into account how best in slot items are treated in this game. Things like bandos, armadyl, ancestral, prims/pegs all are ridiculously expensive compared to the next tier below it and the extra bonuses never actually justify the extra cost. It's just the cost of being BIS in a game with very little gear variety. I'm also taking into account how every other best in slot item in the game comes from some form of bossing. Including the ancestral hat, armadyl helmet, and previously the serp helm... why now all of sudden have a best in slot item be dropped from a level 60 slayer (this is a low-mid tier requirement) monster that people kill in mass...
---
I'm a bit worried they'd pull a dragon slayer 2 and just copy rs3s story again and this is about the point the mahjarrats got less interesting
---
Wait whats woox walking then and why would you use it if walking is so easy?
---
Idk why it isnt hated more on here. The skill isnt that rewarding really and it literally takes getting carpal tunnel to do it efficiently
---
A mummy boss would be a bit uninspired IMO, there are so many better possibilities when it comes to Egyptian mythology
---
Personally I think an evil priest/necromancer would be pretty cool
---
&gt;half the time 
---
You can kill zulrah 10,000 times in a row of you want. You can't do the same with superiors.
---
Yes, the superior version.
---
The point of dark crab fishing is to create fights. The skiller is risking noted dark crabs.
---
It didn't really change much, just looked different, but it never sat right with me.
---
Except this is a superior version thats supposed to be hard.
---
Good luck getting 15 kills an hour on superiors then, since you seem to think that's possible
---
So awesome. This is one of my end game goal on my hcim zerker. Grats dude
---
I would kill for this tbh it’s so awesome
---
My favorite is vet'ion but the pkers there make it incredibly frustrating
---
Graph seems confusing. What is the y axis here?
---
Is the dragon crossbow worth it going from the rcb? I definitely don't have enough money for acb or dhcb. I don't plan on doing anything specific, just general range combat. Some slayer, maybe trying vork again, ect.
---
Price hasn't even stabilized yet. It's currently in the state of not worth doing at all.
---
If u calculate that u will get the jaw within 800 kills that assumes that specific person has the perfect luck which is a statistical fallacy
---
Yea i got every drop before any zenyte
---
Are PMOD names ever published? If they catch you, is their username reported? If not, just use an always silent PMOD.
---
Giggidy
---
Nah. Having bulwark or sotd is better there
---
It does help! Thank you!
---
We Are Going To Beat You To Death
---
Clearly fake because you can see natural light.
---
Pro tip: Gamers do not like natural light.
---
They are correct though, cannoning barrows used to be a legitimate strategy. It still works quite well so it is still a legitimate strategy. The only cute noob here is you wearing that mystic robe top.
---
What? Nobody is going to fish dark crabs and hope someone shows up to fight
---
Truer words are rarely spoken my friend.
---
Congrats man. Idk why people gotta be like that with the negativity but you keep doing you brother!
---
Trying to fix it.
---
i came back to downvote you
---
I got graceful at exactly 60, my buddy took until around 65.
---
i wish u were right but ur not, im a legit pker unfortunately and i have an account in basically in every combat bracket. i pk at revs, deep wildy single, edge, pvp ws most of the time
---
Exactly, which would require a bit more math to get an accurate number
---
Otherwise 8th graders would be actuaries
---
About half of the BiS items can be obtained via raw gp unless you're an ironmeme
---
Lmao, does Jagex not do any testing? Or do they just shit things out and hope for the best?
---
Then add Warding in as an integrity change
---
My washer goes small-medium-extra large. Would’ve been perfect for this meme
---
Interesting I didn’t know that. Also, I’ll be wearing this mystic top to theatre of blood one day so it can experience all of runescape.
---
Bow-Swords from the Devious Minds Quest.

What a beaut!

"must be able to count to 3 repeatedly" hardest requirement of the all tbh

Never stop praying mage when he spawns. It'll fuck you up quick.
---
for game integrity! also prifddinas agility is very boring so making this helped get me through :p
---
Antifire shield, pray magic, Ibans blast. Gl
---
you should probably reflect on what brought you to this moment, guys
---
Moves the side bars closer or further from the edge of your screen, since a lot of people complained there was a lot of space between the buttons and the screen
---
*angrily grumbles with 1600 on task dry*
---
Was hoping for armored basilisks riding dagannoths lol
---
Why?
---
Imagine thinking half the drop rate = half the time when you're talking about two completely different spawn rates
---
Are you including the cost to kill these?
---
They fucked up
---
The boys
---
I use a fury if I want to afk a task. It has more prayer bonus. Total stats wise fury Is better but everyone loves their attack stats.
---
That by far is the worst offender! Cause your very lucky if you break even on meds thru implings.
---
40 minutes of cringy chestbrah.
---
Pyramid Plunder, but there is no boss it's just thieving xp with the occasional aggressive mob
---
I just looked at his vid, and he kills the evil creature in Brimstail's house first--I went to kill it last and it disappeared. What do I do from here
---
How long does the dwarf stay there after the chest spawns it?
---
Good bot
---
keep STR lvl higher than ATT lvl, strenght increases max hit, att skill allows u to equip better weapons but doesnt make u significally hit more accurately
---
make money by gathering fuckton of shit and selling that (like killing green dragons for bones/hides and selling at ge) or f2p version would be idk, catching lobsters at Corsair Cove
---
Lol KBD *is* worthless for money though. The only reason people go there is for pet and heads. You'll make far more money at bbd
---
Those pokemon looking health bars. Gross.
---
They switch after 3 0s. If you take damage it won't count.
---
Id love to see more stuff stuff like the tent whip, thinking the gwd armor attachments that dissolve them. Bis that keeps the old bis relevant and also keeps the old content relevant due to the item sink. The ring slot could use new bis as those are the farthest behind the other slots imo. Def dont need more weapons atm, but mage could use a new offhand
---
Have you tried Pyramid Plunder? Less xp than Blackjacking but 100% less suicidal thoughts. I actually enjoy. Plus the chance of pulling Sceptre.
---
He doesn't have any pictures online for that reason, but many jmods pick a jmod name that isn't their IRL name
---
"Safety comes first, and nothings safer than.... SPINS OF SAFETY!"  
---
"That's right, everyday you'll get 2 safety spins than can give you cosmetics and XP reward lamps. If that's not enough you can also exchange a small fee for a few extra spins too!"
---
And it means nothing as to what the gp/hr really is lols
---
There's actually a rare chance to get 3rd age from this chest. My friend got it, and his dad is Jagex so it must be true.
---
Gz. Got mine at 360
---
I stopped playing a couple years ago too and I’ve been waiting for group ironman since, but I recently started playing again and it’s pretty enjoyable. I would love to play group ironman though.
---
Why is every single ironman an absolutely dogshit human being
---
I’m pretty sure this is the actual way to runescape. We’ve all been doing it wrong all along
---
More convenient yes, but I guess I'm shocked people are actually expressing they "Don't know how to do gorillas now". Like hydra, if you can count to 3, you can do gorillas.
---
Where's the animal?
---
Nobody considers visage when looking at Vorkath profit
---
The way Jagex went about the buff was a bad decision as we now have a semi afkable low level slayer monster that has the stats near that of a demi boss, with zero mechanics that is both slow to kill for low levels and boring for high levels that is dropping an item that they shouldn't be. As your image shows it should have been dropped by a new boss or an interesting, higher level demi boss that would have unlocked from completing the quest. Or it should have had lower strength bonus and came as a rare drop from a low profit farmable mob that matches the 60 slayer requirement.
---
Not really. Most don't kill you if you risk less than 100k.if you wear nothing, they don't know what you risk so they kill on sight. But if you are killing someone in the agility yard, I would suggest doing something else.
---
That's that ally oop and 1
---
100% this. There definitely is noticable lag even on max FPS on the lowest ping worlds. You tap and it takes much longer to register than on PC
---
this is a good question, i dont know. 
---
i cant now, but i will test it later though and let you know
---
Cr1tikal needs to step up his Monkey Nuts stack.

Scariest login screen you could make, maybe add MTX and we'd be scared shitless

Me no how do demon gorlas
---
Lmfao. Loses argument because he doesn't know how to make a proper point or how to argue against one. Falls back on "what's your stats br0" and gets absolutely rekt
---
that i’m finally getting unbanned
---
I haven't been playing in a while, but this basilisk change clearly isn't popular. Would making the slayer requirement 83 or something be a good idea? But then people with lower stats wouldn't be happy... but then if the basilisks are left unbuffed, surely a +3 strength upgrade shouldn't come from them.
---
I would hope an ideal group ironman would have some awesome features like a totally shared bank and Poh tbh if they are already going to put a shit load of engine work into it. 
---
Maybe release it alongside a better co-op slayer too.
---
&gt;And btw he literally said it should be harder, not more fun or whatever the fuck he is claiming he said now.
---
We Sephiroth now boys.
---
So they’re dressing up like garbage men? Sounds about right.
---
That was OSBuddy only, and I don't remember what year it was.
---
FYI, basilisk haven't been changed and still are easy.
---
FG should have been the reward from a grandmaster level quest and not locked behind another slayer boss. The original was a cheap quest that wasn’t locked behind an RNG slayer drop.  Locking everything behind slayer is just a waste of time for everyone and nothing more than a ploy of the game developer to get us to waste more time doing brainless repetitive tasks in their game. RS3 has predatory MTX issues but OS is designed to keep us online.
---
Visualize my butt
---
Thieving is hands down the worst skill in the game.

haribos grandad

Hopefully raids 3 or your game is about to become hella stale. Gauntlet was a fail.
---
The people who fight against other pkers in a single world are totally the ones using scout bots to scan multiple worlds 🤔
---
vests= construction skill update! New themes, foliage,
---
Weathy boy is probably just another Jed or Reach. Why would he work for Jagex’s minimum wage when he could skirt them for a six figure salary without even breaking the law.
---
Go to nmz! Grind out those levels. Max combat should be doable within 6 months of 20 min afk. Seriously, if I can work a 40 hour a week job, have a gf, and still play 3 -4 hours a day, you can too. It’s only been a year since I started and I’m already almost maxed total level. Just gotta be efficient.
---
I think you can just leave and try again if you just want a good time.
---
Why don't you slide it and find out?
---
You have to be praying against it. They switch after 3 unsuccessful attacks
---
Bro the first time I did hotkeys was the first time I actually did Jad
---
You will lose shit loads of money until rangers, unless you get really lucky with multiple other boots and pages.
---
Hopefully not group ironman, game already caters to them a lot as is.
---
Au de la tism
---
Lol what??? Every time you kill zulrah you basically get 100k in loot.
---
It's adding a second method to get Lumberjack, like Molch Pearls and Angler.
---
Gets naked
---
Forgets name is BET ****
---
Doesn't matter because mod is on the payroll
---
For number 2, if you go into building mode in your house there’s another option in the house settings pane for “viewer.” This is a really handy tool that allows you view your house top-down and remove or even relocate rooms in your house.
---
I honestly have no idea.
---
The schedule on their Twitch channel says they should have started ten minutes ago, their blog post/article says the same too, but there's nothing on.
---
Early on in my ironman account I did this. I went to alch a green dhide body, accidentally equipped it and alched my graceful top instead.
---
I am now 125 cb, 2088 total. 
---
I do not have full graceful.
---
All overlays are against the rules technically.
---
Thanks for the insight Mod Radingod123
---
this is the best articulation of my thoughts, thanks for this comment
---
\*bows at the feet\*
---
Oooof.  That hurts
---
Where is the chain part? Looks like a normal red shirt to me
---
Yes, and give us Acolyte - rune plate with an even slightly higher prayer bonus than Proselyte - as a reward, but it needs to be a grandmaster quest.
---
Honestly didn't know snakeskin chaps suck that much.
---
If I was wearing void and you killed me in deep wildy I’d ground you too. No one should have to do pest control that much.
---
I'm diggin the downvote, but I'm curious what the logic was, it would just be an optional combat version of the Maze (which, last time I ran it, got me something like 500 steel arrows and 500 death runes).
---
Yellow vest protest?
---
It's technically a minigame
---
Make an MTX announcement
---
“Zulrah can be killed by med mains very easily”
---
LOL what? Put a med level player in front of zulrah for the first time I promise you it won’t be easy, send them on a basilisk task and it will be brain dead simple. 
---
I agree the change was stupid, but a change was needed. A stat buff was not it. They needed to be mechanically harder, not take 2x longer to kill.
---
A little bit yeah, but don't want the super expensive methods.
---
yeah I think there are plenty of better solutions to the issue that jagex could have done, wouldn't surprise me if this update was pushed as a temporary "fix" so they could get on with runefest
---
Think this is dmp gains
---
never tought about it, damn, so thats how u guys train it. Thanks.
---
Thanks mang!
---
I would at least be more ok with it if they buffed the slayer xp rate, as it stands it doesn't matter how much that jaw is worth when it takes me 4 hours to complete a task with stats in the 80's, and getting under 10k slayer xp per hour the whole time while losing money.
---
People like casual pvp, lms is sweaty af.
---
very true lol

No, I wear a tentacle bandana

Awesome ty

If you really do ok enough to have multiple accounts, you know damn well most people arent auto switching lol
---
A bounty system where you get a cut of the banned player's worth would encouraging reporting. And make people more wary of openly participating if they know everyone else is watching. Split between everyone who reported. Cuts are reduced for players with a low ban to report ratio to discourage false reports.
---
Would love a Desert Treasure 2 that unlocks Menaphos and Raids 3 which is Mahjarrat-themed.
---
Thanks for explaining :)
---
Make a bot farm to fight these bots.
---
I don’t see why we should enter new ages, that just causes confusion between previous and new quests.
---
If anything the ultimate goal with quests should be to just fully explore the lore of this age.
---
Fight fire with fire. I like it
---
If you hit a jaw it's likely 1m+ an hour that's better than kurasks, wyverns, gargs, nechs, ect and is on par with kraken. Its level 60 content it shouldn't be good loot other than the jaw and even then the jaw shouldn't come from content this easy
---
In the comments he said the top non-stackable item stack is Flax with 122,298,507.
---
Mother of god...
---
Aye it's the survivor himself! Gl on meeting our God two years in a row
---
&gt; Things like bandos, armadyl, ancestral, prims/pegs all are ridiculously expensive compared to the next tier below it and the extra bonuses never actually justify the extra cost.
---
Whip did come from a slayer monster, Dragon boots came from a slayer monster. Who knows, maybe Jagex is planning to release a boss for the final Grandmaster quest of the storyline that drops an upgrade to the faceguard similar to Crystals from Cerb or the accumulator -&gt; assembler upgrade for Vorkath. I merely see Faceguard as a stepping stone to further BiS helmets (for the later quests of that series), eventhough it is arguably the best one now. And those "middle pieces" usually come from slayer and are usually not too expensive.
---
Ok fair enough. What boots and cape do you use if I may ask? Assuming dboots and firecape, those only give str bonus (well fcape gives +1 att), but it's attack that I need, since those bgs specs keep hitting 0. Also I do ~2 minute kill trips without bgs specs so I personally wouldn't bank if the specs don't hit.
---
Who actually gives a fuck?
---
Strength Train
---
Check the ones in the grand tree.
---
If you kill them and use the stairs right after, it doesn't register as a kill.
---
This is what happens when Jagex gives way too much importance to the opinion of the &lt;2% of the player base who are living in their little maximum efficiency, endgame-content bubble, and who are completely out of touch with the rest of the player base, game, and the way that the other 98% of people actually interact with content.
---
I'm not saying that we shouldn't listen to maxed players or the small community of hyper-efficient endgame-content players, but that needs to balanced against the fact that the majority of the players interact with the game in a vastly different way. They can definitely have some insights, but when we let the loudest and bitchiest parts of that community on Twitter unilaterally dictate content in the game without the need for polls, and independent of everyone else's input, then something is broken.
---
Then get turmoil? It's like complaining that someone with 99 strength hits harder than someone with 70 strength.
---
Ding ding ding, hey someone on reddit actually gets it.
---
Put the slayer helm up there if you want to be fair.
---
The odd part is it seems entirely random, as they don’t want to create a way to “boost” your chances of becoming a mod. Only thing as far as I’m aware is a clean report record which isn’t that difficult (don’t bot and don’t flame people that aren’t your close friends 😂😂)
---
Hmmmmmm "forces unwanted changes into the game". 
---
Wait, what's this I my memory? 
---
Oh it is the mods spending months and many hours on working hard to design a new skill. Taking player feedback to heart and coming up with multiple revisions using that feedback. Then having it get brutally murdered at the polls despite their hard work. 
---
Do you have a new skill in your tab?
---
For the last time the Slayer meta is to get at least 90 stats before you train it. And if you don't balance content around the fastest kill time you don't get any balance at all
---
and dudes on here think the drops cover supply costs lmao
---
Youre still playing minecraft tho apparently.
---
Title would be more fitting like this:
---
When you wanna play OSRS, but minecraft is life.
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/runefest-2019-prepare-your-day?oldschool=1
---
To be fair, neither of us can really know what the actual gp/hour is until Jagex releases the drop rates for the jaw.
---
Either way they’re both over due.
---
I appreciate the advice but I wouldn’t worry about me. PUBG on Xbox was the closest I got to not being able to put a game down but that was way under control lol and I can’t see myself taking it even that far
---
I lost
---
Maybe the helm shouldn't have been bis in the first place
---
Congratz from another zerker, mate! I’ve still got to do “A Taste of Hope” myself, but that’s my last quest to do :P Have fun out there my dude!
---
It was the pressure that would get to me and fuck up a switch.
---
And I feel pro when I afk fish on 2 accounts...
---
Get yourself a bond, if they dont get you one hit me up too LMFAO you monster.
---
Vanescula can suck all the blood she wants from me.
---
sorry you feel that way, all I was trying to do is show that the buff to the knights is a lazy solution to the problem of the helmet being too easy to obtain, I'm not saying that every other example is a perfect level of difficulty for reward it gives
---
Yeah, they should just make the whole game right click only.
---
At least 5k
---
Photoshoppers will say they’re haters
---
They could have broken the bonus into two helm upgrades. 
---
They could make a +4 or +5 basilisk jaw helm and an additional boss add-on to give the final +6 STR bonus.
---
Lookin great guys!    Ohh btw tnx for incorrectly banning my main.  Yay Jagex
---
Is there a specific lists of things they have removed so far?

Its a joke because during the quest you have to wipe your memories of the pet rock since you couldn’t handle dunking your pet rock it a burning geyser
---
Back when I was learning the teles were hella expensive, I was still negative gp after getting an onyx at 11 kc. So no do not use the scrolls lol. You tele there to start and then if you die you use another to get your stuff back and then use a 3rd to get back. Adds up hella

You know clans actually manually scout too. Sure there are bots but a lot manually scout.
---
He's most likely in a leech cc where they do tie games for 2 tickets and someone is scoring, preventing the tie.
---
No just been to 15+ events and realized it's never going to not be terrible. Anyone with half a brain could figure out you put a bunch of people in a room when half of them are covered in 3x the layers because of cosplay and it's going to be terrible by the end of the day.
---
Me mate :)

How'd u get the cape

Awful*

Dang, how much cash did you get for all that?  
---
Kidding... that's a true friend!

This conclusion made me lol
---
Awkward*

Well it’s not entirely a hype term. If the direction they decide to take their new quests into ends up creating serious changed across the world, then a new age will be important to distinguish the time. The end of the second age was characterized by the banishment of Zaros and beginning of the God Wars and the end of the third age was when the edicts of guthix were established and the god wars were ended. Obviously a god war is a huge thing so it gets its own age.
---
Balenciaga my jeans, Margiella my sneaks
---
yeah, i do know that, how is that relevant? this is a post about being against the scouting bots that have been more and more prevalant, not a post against pvp in general. I have no issue with being pked if it’s fair and square, it’s just part of the game.
---
a friend of mine has been scammed by the same guy. we ended up documenting a lot of information on this guy. he has a lot of his info on the internet.
---
God forbid not wanting to get carpel tunnel while playing the game
---
Clearly the solution is to increase all those monster's HP by 300% and add another dodge mechanism to each.
---
Just read what people said to you. The elitism is hilarious
---
Enjoy all of the members content you've unlocked! It really does expand the game by an almost inconceivable amount.
---
Many years ago I ran into someone who grabbed the enemy flag, then hid behind a ton of barricades in the middle of the map. Nobody could kill him so he just sat there doing nothing while the other team already had a point advantage
---
Thanks again!!
---
It is real you fools
---
I need somebody
---
Im a 20 def pure, 99 att, 99 str, 99 range, 99 hp, 99. mage, 55 prayer.  I fold zerkers on the daily
---
A nice reply to the nice reply to a nice in the comments
---
Can confirm, I'm in this guy's clan.
---
A statement on mtx and a plan to fix it.
---
My point is that there will be scouts no matter what. And bots are part of the game too. And I am fairly certain jagex are already aware of them.
---
Misunderstood Trees
---
there are so many different solutions to the issue, it's just a shame that jagex's solution was to fuck over the players that were most likely to bother killing the Knights, another solution they could have done could be to create a thermonuclear smoke devil equivalent to the basilisk that has better odds of dropping the jaw, whilst keeping the normal knights how they were before they were changed
---
If you're only hunting for pet and/or mutagens and couldn't give a rat's ass about profit, the teleports might be worth it.
---
WE WANT EZSCAPE
---
that\`s sick haha i love when things like this happen to me lol
---
Hey I was one of those 44 upvotes a year ago. Glad to hear that didn't ruin your friendship
---
Even items like dragon hunter lance, which has the retarded slayer restrictions on it, have reached saturation. People will not kill monsters without X profit/hr at a certain tier of monster, I guarantee if you removed the idiotic slayer boss task restrictions like konar only and task only, nothing would change. It's mostly noobs who kill non-raids bosses off task, and Hydra is shittier money than Vorkath even with claw drops, and vorkath is far less tedious to kill. 
---
Items stabilize at a price point between what makes them worth obtaining and what people will pay for them. If item floods market people stop killing the monster, item goes up. Buffing the monster or reducing the droprate makes the final price higher because it costs more supplies and time per drop, making it task only just makes it harder to obtain for the first few months until everyone has gotten the task.
---
People keep saying the basilisk jaw needs to be rare, it doesn't. Jagex has admitted already that they already have the grandmaster fremmy quest planned out, which more than likely has a vorkath or zalcano style boss which drops the final fremmy helm. These are a stepping stone like neitznot, the 50k BIS was. I disagree with the buffs because the monsters were already bizarrely difficult for a tier 60 monster if you didn't safespot them.
---
jsut to add it wasn't with a tele it was with a trade scam in a bank where his character appeared to be inside the bank however there is a known glitch where your character is not actually in but outside the bank. when trading said character it drags you outside into pvp zone.
---
Quest line is not finished yet, there is still the possibility of them adding a Vorkath-esque boss after the finale that drops your "final" BiS helmet.
---
To everyone who thinks the safety vests mean something special:
---
You’re all wrong, it’s a J-Mod Strip Show.
---
Can you download Spotify on it ?
---
That's why you use explosive potions.
---
No, the roundshield is a different item entirely.
---
Integrity over profits? Not with capitalism!
---
You used to be able to venom the entire thing with Serp helm. They patched it.
---
Dude that's how you get checked into a psych ward.
---
To be honest fuck it send them to classic wow so they can stop voting for shitty updates.
---
Defended Jad to death
---
Good luck!

I didn't say you couldn't. But raids enables you to just live the gp/h life all the time- all you have to do is raid, and the rest of the problems solve themselves. At first, living the gp/h life sounds bad. But once you can raid, gp/h life is best case scenario.
---
Not sure about actual implementation but it shouldn't be very difficult to whip up.  
---
foreach (player in area) if(pmodList.contains(player.Name)) layLow();
---
356 + 9 = 365
---
365 days = 1 year
---
Setting up a bunch of barricades behind the spawn (where they're useless) and then just idling. Barricades are pretty important and your team can only have a set amount of them out at once.
---
Very fun AND satisfying! Trust me, once you get your first good kill with an ags spec, you'll be hooked. You don't need much skills to kill pvmers and get big loot too!
---
Im a broke bitch lol, in hindsight i shouldnt have, but at the time 100 hours of runescrafting sounded better than 100M for construction. I know mistakes were made.
---
I quit runescape but i still have the intention to pay him back
---
More vampyre quests pls
---
Looks like I’m in for a sweaty weekend
---
If television and movies are so good, why is it more fun to watch them while I play osrs?
---
yea now that I think about it you definitely have a point, I guess I'm kind of biased since the only content I really do anymore(post 99 slayer) are raids and corp which you don't use slayer helms at. I probably should have included void and slayer helm as other examples but I did make this post to try and show that the Basilisk Knight buff jagex implemented doesn't fix the main problem.
---
I didn't have enough gold for a bond. I'm 100% sure of that.
---
Isn't this basically what the cudgel is?
---
How sheeet boys I was joking!!
---
SPOILER REEEEEE
---
Tbh thats what many people on this sub cry about. They increase xp rate on anythng by 10k BUT MUH EASYSCAPE.
---
There's not really any good way to answer this, it's trial an error. Prossy works for about everything but will cost more (ppots v food).
---
It takes like 200k max to get to 50 con. Even less if you ever touch WT.
---
Google "osrs dps calc" for the generalized answer to "what is the best way to kill this thing"
---
Big spreadsheet, punch in the numbers, pick the monster you're fighting, figure out what does most damage. 
---
As for whether or not to pray....basically just whenever you have to bank frequently enough that it is annoying. My short answer would be just to proselyte up every time honestly, prayer pots aren't cheap but the farther you get into the game the less of a problem that will be.
---
Clearly you've never high risk fighted in non plus one worlds
---
I like the idea of this weapon, it fills a certain niche for one handed crush weapons,  but my only issue would be that with a dragon defender this weapon would outclass the abyssal bludgeon by far and make the bludgeon useless. The only way i would see this weapon work would be with a slower attack speed (either 5-6 tick) or by lowering its stats. the issue with lowering the stats is that it becomes a sarachnis cudgel.

Full obby and berserker necklace give set bonuses which stack

Cmon bruh, you know everyone is going to be against this if you use the same name it used to have. Gotta think outside the box like they did with twisted bow instead of calling it hexhunter.
---
Yep, I think you’re probably right
---
Base 50s on f2p ironman is some serious work! Major respect to you.
---
Sorry I had no clue! Good luck on the ironman!(:
---
I was 72 agility and maybe it was just that they accidentally nerfed those quests the week prif came out when i did it, but i barely failed much stuff throughout the quest series. Pretty much no fails in underground pass, a few fails in tirannwn and a few in the library but nothing major
---
Obsidian armour and berserker necklace boost the damage of obsidian weapons, specifically the sword as that has the highest DPS.
---
This is good content.
---
Seems you forgot to mention the master level quest required to kill knights.
---
For melee, just start looking at all the items which give strength bonus and buy the ones that give you the best bang for your buck. Zerker ring (i) gives 8 str bonus, costs like 4m. That's 500k per str bonus which is very cheap, so you want that early. Dragon boots cost like 400k and give 4 str bonus. 100k per str bonus, buy it early. Avernic defender only gives you 2 more str bonus than dragon and costs 80m. 40m per str bonus, buy it late. Repeat for every slot.
---

Are you sure you used compost?

A little bit below average :D

I swear I heard other conventions doing this, maybe I'm wrong but I feel like that's fair. If you can't bathe you shouldn't affect everyone else's experience

The biggest benefit of dragon crossbow from my point of view is that it can use dragon bolts like diamond dragon.

Getting all the way to the well in Underground Pass but you forgot to bring a rope

I actually did some osrs sketches a long time ago and I know just how hard it is to incorporate your own style whilst keeping an obvious visual representation of what osrs looks and feels like, I could never get close to anything half decent. 
---
You're doing an amazing job, hope if you aren't already you're planning to make a career out of your talent!

She claims she has no idea what I was talking about. Oh well.

Gottem'

I love this idea that the people posting memes nonstop for the last week are the ‘silent majority’
---
Yup went and made 25 dramen staffs. Only lost 3 so far.
---
No one likes zulrah? Fine I'll say it! I like zulrah! The 4 patterns help to keep it a bit interesting yet something you can master. I like that no melee is involved and mage is a huge factor instead of range. Plus improving my time from 3 mins to 1:12 over 600kc has made me a better (and richer) player.
---
- he’s almost always cheeky or snarky and for some reason the community has considered this as him caring
---
sounds boring to me ._.
---
Full obby has an invisible 10% boost to accuracy and strength, obby neck adds an extra 20% damage on top of that. Make sure you use the obby sword too.
---
I put off doing ba until like lvl 115. Decided to finally do it for the diary and now it's one of my favorite things to do in rs. Watch a couple guides and you'll be fine. Start with att or coll to get a feel for how the game works
---
Also use range for ba, it's op
---
Ooohhhh, coold good to know!
---
DKs are good for ironmen and pet farmers.
---
Unlimited you can get from genie and varrock museium
---
Idk, the buff may at least help keeping the unique valuable
---
Absolutely 100% sure.
---
this is awesome!
---
to add; clan features in-game. Since GIM uses a lot of the same engine features I think in-game clan features will also be announced.
---
You only need 83 construction for a max house, so its probably less than 30 mil.  Sure the construction cape is nice for the direct teleport, but you can always just ardy cloak/ qpc then fairy ring in and its still pretty good.
---
Usually anywhere from 4-8 hours for BA, depending on your teams and how well you can learn the role.  It's fairly easy to have the wiki on the side and learn the role as you go, nothing can really break your run outside of dying.  Just remember to call the horn whenever a new one appears
---
It's like Tears of Guthix, but without the green tears.
---
If your lowest skill is "hygiene" all the points go there!

Looks slick.

Confirms he's a nerd like the rest of us and not some camera rent boy.

Am I the only one that feels that Jagex is going to collapse soon because of it's appalling upper management? Some of the decisions that are made at the top are just ridiculous, and they don't treat their employees well at all. They don't seem to realize that the developers are the core of this game and with some of the stuff I've read about working there, I don't think any human being is going to stick around for very long. I strongly believe that when Ash finally leaves, OSRS is doomed.
---
They actually got 2 million of us to willingly watch ads for six minutes straight. This is absolutely brilliant marketing.
---
Yeah but if ur rich and dont wanna talk to perdu then fuck it
---
You good?
---
You want my honest opinion? Anything that will make this game give me the nostalgia it used to give me. It just seems like a low detailed RS3 with every "content" update making me want to quit more. Bring us back to the days where the biggest update was adding a new area / npcs for a quest and that was it. There is no life in this game anymore, just a seemingly endless grind.
---
Took me 6 hours to get a torso and I had never done BA before. Watch a YouTube vid before doing a role and just pray for good teammates.
---
Rune defender took roughly 2-3 hours.
---
The times may be off depending on your luck.
---
That's actually surprisingly decent
---
1b cash
---
I mean it's comparable in the sense that you receive a % based increase in damage vs specific monsters.
---
yea it’s super chill and like 150k/h. And u bank the xp to use it all at once
---
But agility is so boring :(
---
You don't need to pay 80 points to unlock them post-quest. Only if you want Nieve/Steve, Konar and Duradel to assign them. Vannaka and Chaeldar assign basilisks normally and all you need is one of those tasks.
---
Already been done for an April fools.
---
I think its in a bad way, yeah.
---
I just quit for the first time since starting playing, because I’m just bored, updates like Priff didn’t really hold my attention, refusal to really address botting crashing Zulrah making the content pretty pointless at worst, or at best feeling robbed by doing it at a lower GP/HR because of bots, and the whole partnership thing just reaffirming that MTX, although not now, is absolutely on the table one day
---
This ones better lol
---
That pmod got slapped harder than Dovydas back in 2018, when he got kicked all the way back to Lithuania
---
It’ll just take an eternity at that stack size.
---
Why haven’t you signed in since 5 days, 13 hours, 10 minutes ago? That’s some *serious* xp waste, bruv
---
What am I missing?  Can’t you guys just toggle superiors off?
---
It seems like everyone against is acting as if this buff is massive when it’s a 1/100 superior that can be toggled off..
---
Do a search on this subreddit and then come back to your post.
---
Took me about 4.5 hours for the torso, hated every second of it, but in hindsight it wasn't exactly hard, just frustrating.
---
Rune defender can vary wildly based on RNG, 1-4 hours is my best estimate
---
Can anyone post a pic? No twitter at work =(
---
They haven’t commented on it 😂
---
True but they could still for sure announce a GIM framework or time-lime because  they're just saying "we'd like to offer XYZ during 2020" at this stage rather than a tangible progress update.
---
Raise your hand if you're surprised.
---
You are currently timed out from Chat.
---
You can chat again in 11 minutes 51 seconds.

My friend and I waited years for it... when it seemed unlikely, we just made accounts and made ourselves unable to trade/use GE or anything like that. Same rules as ironman, but we can trade with each other.  Fun as shit.
---
Are they autodeleting messages that contain "MTX" or "🦀"
---
Not a single good thing came from zulrah
---
It's really not complex in the slightest. These bots are almost certainly written as plugins for clients like runelite, in which case you can get all the players within range with a single function call. The pmod list takes time if it has to be gathered based on in-game chats, but all you need to do is check for the crown and record the name/pid.
---
I got 107 herbs from 9 seeds today, so i dont think its screwy, it is rn based after all. I do want them to make iasor seeds give you  complete disease immunity tho
---
but it NEVER stops at 'cosmetics'
---
fallout 76- they changed from cosmetic only to 'not pay to win' (added armor repairs or something)
---
RS3- i /think/ started with solomen store with only cosmetics, but quickly jumped into auras, exp, items, gp, etc. etc. etc. fuck jagex.
---
i had more examples but i forgot where i was going cuz i'm watching a stream. rip.
---
Luckily he doesn't need any favors
---
Ngl you had me in the first half
---
Got my first at 1709 kc. Keep at it op
---
You have a very valid point.
---
Lmao
---
I need to grind out a coal bag lol.
---
In theory it should not work that way but, if it works it must be due to the higher hits accumulating more dps over the consistent hits of a crush weapon. Beats me tbh :/
---
647k
---
Well you clearly didn't read the blogs or keep updated on warding because not only did it intoduce new armor it also introduced new rings, weapons, dissolving of items etc.
---
Everyone has their opinion and your opinion is "warding is a dumb idea" and your aurgument for that opinion is "only goal is to add a magic armor building mechanic"
---
Not only is your aurgument completely wrong it's also ignorant as fuck.
---
you remind me of /u/PaperPals he voted no for being able to have multiple rune pouches because he wasnt sure if you could just store multiple different runes in different pouches even tho the poll question clearly is "Should players be able to own more than one rune pouch? If this question passes, **each one would link to the same store of runes.**"
---
At this point I should just call you stupid but whatever.
---
hahah yes 7 cabg
---
iirc jagex did buff all of the Basilisk Knights, but the buff along with the stat multiplier applied to the superiors made them significantly more difficult
---
Its actually been confirmed multiple times by jmods and if you have any inferno experience whatsoever you can prove it yourself. Its glaringly obvious in places like Zuk's shield and mm2 platforms. Good try tho
---
Literally shit. Sick nerd a fucking hcim the first to complete TOB and is max what the fuck. I didnt even know he fucking stream. 
---
HE DIDNT EVEN BOTHER TO SHOW UP TO RUNEFEST ....
---
Fire up the calander! 4 days into October, this will be a juicy month
---
Who the fuck cares?
---
I was hopping SickNerd would win :(
---
His viewers are 15yo, and coincidentally so is this sub
---
Looks better than some of recent ones on here.
---
They used to do this at MLG events with Old Spice and I gotta say it was a great move all around
---
Who’s not gunna Rwt with the chance of making 10,000s ?
---
Faux,mammel are way better
---
Everyone in the crowd boo'd as well, what in the world is Jagex thinking lmao
---
Favorite host for the process was "YGO" if anyone was wondering. He was awesome, and he remembered me every time I popped in. Use him when ya can.
---
I was looking forward to The general's speech
---
It wasnt supposed to be temporary. School switched systems after I graduated and closed all accounts from the old system in the process.
---
My man got fucking boo'd
---
Lol. Jealous people downvoting me.
---
Ash seems like a great person to have working in a game company. He's good at what he does and he's passionate about it. One problem I guess I could come up with because of this is maybe a tiny bit too much of a pushover or non-confrontational? Seems like his talents are wasted on a dying Java platform.
---
This makes absolutely 0 sense as Epic have been HEAVILY catering to the silent majority of 10 year olds for over a year now, and all content creators/pros do is complain (rightfully so in many cases) over the state of the game
---
Just saw this on stream! Fucking legend
---
Damn I remember reading in the news that this update was coming... I've been here so long
---
I was so looking forward to the general's speech
---
well deserved
---
Reeeeee
---
I really thought Sick Nerd would win, hes had such a great year. 
---
One of the best HC Ironman accounts and he actually streams risky content.
---
The crowd did not like that
---
Seems all the mtx money rs3 made was spent on hiring her. What the fuck... I rather have someone that the community know doing this shit
---
Straight to Essyllt. Bring mage gear, pray melee whole time until he stuns you then quick switch to range then back to melee. After you beat him it leads you straight to Seren. You can tele out then come back and go straight to Seren
---
Lets see, Faux and Mammal who were also nominated for the same award?
---
KIDDING?? I knew there had to be someone out there with kc less than 100 and all three parts :DD Although I think sire is just fine, but maybe for iron different story!

If you quit RS your only real option is to slip him $600-650.

This is why you don't have one he already took her
---
I've said it once, ill say it again... Sparc Mac got with the mods, told them to implement the duel arena tax, with Sprac Mac getting some of the tax and a invisible stat boost to help him win and the mod (you know which one I am talking about) would sell the rest of the tax to gold sellers for profit. Sparc is in their pocket.
---
Just feels like he's not even part of the community. Never interacts with any other streamers, declines all invites to events, streams duel arena 90% of the time.
---
Crazy that he beat out Sick Nerd, Mr Mammal and Faux.
---
Some host they hired. Idk her name
---
Peak for Sick Nerd. He's the most deserving out of the bunch imo.
---
This is pretty cool. I think that a big part of what annoys people though is that these other mobs all have pretty good, if not great, drop tables outside of their uniques. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the basilisk knight. With their buff should have come a reworked drop table IMO.
---
Finally a good streamer wins an award, people who think that 'Sick Nerd' guy deserved to win anything are out of their mind, the guy barely even streams and when he does its to spurt his left wing agenda and beg for donations after complaining streaming is too straining, gratz Sparcy!
---
I don’t like Sparc Marc, but I hate Sick Nerd as well. They’re both annoying
---

well deserved, all this cum eater white nights need to stop hating....

probably because they disagree...

Because there are loads more popular and relevant streamers then Sparc.

Unless you actively brows twitch or youtube for osrs streamer you're not going to see sparc anywhere.

The onlytimes you'll hear about him on this sub if he is related to some drama.

? Your single farm run is enough to rule out there being a bug? I've stopped planting Attas specifically because of this

who is she?

Seriously though. Sick Nerd has the best HC still alive...finished ToB and GWD. All Sparc Mac does is yell "REEEE" and "who eats ass boys"
---
Tinfoil enhances radio waves... btw

Have all of them won before? If yes, then that could be why. I think they like to award a new streamer each year if possible.

Gambling addiction is a real problem.  All you can do is be aware of it and consciously avoid it.  Gambling is only healthy if you spend what you can afford. If it's affecting your fun of the game, like you want to do stuff but you can't because you gambled your money away, you have a problem.
---
Lol hasn't sparc been bitching on stream about how he's never won while shit talking jagex and lying about not being invited? 
---
At least that's what I've heard from other streamers like sick nerd who don't like him.
---
Fossil island lamps too you get 120k when you complete that

Mark spawns are actually based on a timer, so you can force early graceful by waiting between laps. Most players don't do this though, as you're better off just naturally earning marks while progressing through the skill. High 50s to upwards of the low 70s are when most players get their graceful though. Just depends on how exactly you're running the laps. I wouldn't sweat it either way, Seers is a way better course than Canifis anyways.
---
They should let you fix it with the polishing stone
---
Can you read?
---
Swamp man best!
---
I don’t know where my head is at sometimes......good point
---
What's the deal with bonds costing 5m now, I thought they were 3m before?
---
So they should fucking fix it so we can use it on our Slayer helmets.
---
We all knew it would happen but I’m still really happy for him :)
---
IIRC they really like how OSRS and on a stream actually said that they were really excited for warding. Andrew even said it made sense and that he found it crazy how he never thought about it lol. Wonder what they think about it failing
---
you would do the same
---
Who knows, maybe it was intended sarcasm. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Because memes.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure what I expected him to look like but It wasn't that.
---
On release it was actually challenging without tbow. Personally, I dont know why they changed it.
---
He said almost nothing 😂
---
its easy crafting bloods
---
That's a total of leas than 18m exp. How much exp do you have?
---
The serotonin has arrived
---
said more than the other winners
---
b0aty? he has a maxed rs3 pure (1 def, 60att and all the rest on 200m iirc) and like 5 2000+ total lvl accounts with 2 or something maxed
---
This changes everything
---
A dude shat himself only to go on to lose the record he was vying for
---
Another corrupt pmod exposed who needs their shitty ass crown taken away!
---
I know it's Runescape and I don't disagree with the buff, but not everything has to be a shitty grind boys.
---
I wonder why they just didn't reduces the drop rate or made the basilisk task only. Noone complained when wyverns droped bis melee tank item worth like 15m back in the day and it wasa  72 slayer safespotable and afkable monster.
---
Oh wait that was in 2007 and you cant touch that.
---
Swamp man good, Mootbot bad!
---
??????????????? no random camera rent boy who isn't a "nerd" can do inferno....
---
There's the stuff everyone mentions; he's entertaining, he has good production value, he is an all around good player doing a novel concept, but I personally have one more reason. He is doing a task that is such a needless pain in the ass yet documenting it in a way that is fun and it just makes me empathize with him. I got sad when I saw swampman die, and I felt joy for him when I finally saw him get that fucking rune cbow. He has a way of drawing you in, I guess.
---
3 pets 4 chains is that a joke
---
I get the best video maker but rendi easily should’ve won best video
---
Against anything that isn't a dragon, msb (I) with rune arrows is 3rd bis for ranged dps behind the tbow and the blowpipe. Against dragons, it's 4th bis because dhcb takes the #1 spot.
---
As far as pvm goes, crossbows are only worth using against dragons/wyverns/basilisks (because you need a shield) and some high HP bosses (because you need bolt specs). Dragon cbow is a moderate upgrade for the latter, but I would prioritize other upgrades first.
---
Don’t think he’s ever shown his face so it makes sense.
---
He can afford a watch like that but has 164 starving children. Disgraceful.
---
yeah same, wtf
---
For which video?
---
rendi should of won imo just based on the skill it takes to get that cape at such low cb
---
You can do Sarachnis, which people often forget. Although the minion spawn might rough you up a bit until you can wear barrows armour, meaning 1 or 2 kill trips top. She's a lot of fun to fight though, so worth considering if you aren't just about efficiency.
---

Sparc had like over 30 Billion at one point I think
---
But why.
---
Unreal reply
---
MSB(i) is your only real alternative option, aside from cannon for slayer. Not sure if that's too expensive to use though for you. If it is, you can use it selectively on tasks that will help you break even.

For some reason, this looks like the most north american face ever to me.
---
You're right. It could also have zero people selling their pmod privileges, but by that logic it could also jump to a 100% corruption rate. The most likely conclusion is unless they change the recruitment system, they will get roughly the same amount of pmods abusing their privileges.
---
Another factor I didn't even think about, is now that sirpugger made this video, pmods who didn't think of this will consider doing it.. So the corruption rate will most likely stay the same or rise.
---
That sounds like the best idea ever
---
They don't prevent you, you're right. But it's the same line of argument as "being forced into the wilderness" You aren't actually forced to do anything. But if you want the best exp for your time spent you will log in and do the daily before doing anything else. We have plenty of daily content already through farming imo. And I don't understand your second point, people will log in if they want to log in. I'd rather content be interesting enough to get people to log in rather than through the pressure of "lost exp" for not logging in each day.
---
Wasn't that just YouTube money since he had like a ridiculous amount of views on his vids?
---
Damn dude I’m at 54m exp and no pet. Didn’t think it was possible to hit 200m without. I hope I don’t hit the same boat as you.
---
Only bad part of that tattoo is the forum avatar.. and it’s only bad because of the Jagex art style lmfao
---
How would it decrease diversity? Zerkers are trash in osrs but with turm they'd be a powerhouse again. Mid and piety pures would just get 95 prayer. Obviously any melee build with 70 defense but doesn't have 70 prayer for piety is trash, same would apply once turmoil would be released. The lowest defense you could have with turm was 33, so the lowest cb you could have combined with 95 pray was around 100 cb, so pures would no be fighting anyone with turmoil.

I think these progress videos became popular for the same reasons the Machinimas did back in the day: guys like Settled and J1mmy have imparted a great deal more personality and humor into their progress videos than the boring ones of old.

The real question, did he pay his friend back? Or stake it at Sand Casino?
---
Thanks. Is gem mining worthwhile at 53 mining?
---
South Asian genes look it up.
---
Cool graphic, some objections:
---
a) Many of these creatures have less health than the new knights, as fully fledged \*bosses\*.
---
b) Most of the items in question have a much better drop rate than 1/800 despite similar kill times and being much more relevant upgrades than +6 instead of +5 str.
---
c) Most of these creatures have far superior non-unique loot to basi knights despite similar postbuff supply costs
---
d) In many cases, this isn't the ranged or melee BIS, elite void is.  I understand having elite void there instead would undermine your argument but like... theres a lot more bis than whats shown here.
---
e) even beyond void, there's some degree of cherry picking at play here.  In another comment you mentioned you didn't think slayer helm belongs on this list because its niche.... but the niches where you wear it may straight up outnumber the niches where you don't, especially with task only mobs and bosses.  If an account had a choice between never having a faceguard and never having a black mask/helm, most accounts would sacrifice the faceguard.  That shows that the slayer helm is a relevant part of the bis conversation.  
---
There's plenty of other items that are also bis in a significant fraction of cases that are not pictured here because they go against your point that the bis all comes from ultra lategame shit (arclight is so good for so many things and you can get it from killing hill giants).  I've noticed, for one, that youve left off the special attack slot in this diagram.  I assume that's because the dwh is the best in slot defense reduction weapon and is dropped from a distinctly midgame enemy, contrary to the narrative of this post.
---
f) Ironically, at least a few of these (like safespotting rex) are more accessible midgame content than killing the buffed basis.  
---
g) At the end of the day, the fact is that it doesnt matter where an item comes from, it matters what its rarity and price are.    For example, almost no one complains about the fact that shamans are really easy and drop dwh because the rarity of the item is enough to maintain a reasonable price.  Even before the buff, the 1/800 drop (even thats only on task) would have generated enough rarity to keep the price somewhere between 5 and 10 mil, which is absolutely reasonable for an item thats only +1 str over the previous bis which costs 5.
---
I was excited about a new skill being announced... that ain’t happening.
---
Personally raids 3 and group Ironman is irrelevant to me, so quests, land expansions etc.
---
I’d love to see a new boss fight that doesn’t rely on prayer/prayer has no effect. I want to see how creatives the devs can get with a restriction like that.
---
I don’t think he got that golden gnome in Morytania...

I don't think he's a dick because he isn't. But I can think of like 25+ times when he does\\says something that's *obviously* meant to be cheeky or sass and people hang onto it as if it was said on a QA stream.  
---
One of the most egregious was during the great MTX scare of 2019 when he had a comment about Mat K being the person who was tryna figure out how to introduce MTX into osrs and everyone on reddit was talking about Jmod drama this and that, but the reality was the dude he was responding to just presumed to know how Mat K felt better than someone who had worked with him for 10+ years.  
---
i guess that's what happens when a bunch of nerds who's social skills are pretty consistently on 0 are required to inference, but jesus already.
---
It is much better than i thought it was going to be
---
I don't know why he's on about the amount, those are regulated and it just looks like less because it's in a massive cup. Complain about the price sure. And he's on about no mixer? Why would you get a mixer when you order a Jack Daniels, it's like ordering a glass of water and being mad there's no Kool Aid in it... Order a Jack and coke next time jesus christ. Makes me wonder how often he actually goes out.

Fair enough aye. I just don't get it. To me Swampletics is really, really boring compared to others' series. But i'm glad everyone else likes it :D
---
suck both of my nuts bitch no one asked you
---
If you ask most players, they have an extremely low time preference and they can't appreciate drop tables that rely on uniques (gwd for example), instead they would vote for gargoyles, wyverns, bbd, vorkath, zulrah.... with consistent gp from resources/alchables.
---
You can have steady alchables/resources or a valuable unique, not really both. If the alchables/resources are the main incentive, the unique will be created non stop as supply won't slow down as much as if the whole income depended on the unique, as happens in gwd.
---
They do it here in Portugal in most big events. With the amount of samples I have I could open my own stand..

If they were going to remove 3rd party clients they would have done it during the announcement

 They are now a permanent part of the game, just banning certain aspects is more than enough for them to feel content and in "control".

Isn't it funny? It happens all the time where you only hear someone's voice for ages, you kind of built up a completely random picture in your head of what they look like based on absolutely nothing, and then are always surprised when they don't look like it... Our brains are odd.

Yeah we met doing gorillas. I asked him if bludgeon had been worth the farm. He hit me with that !kc and just about rocked my world haha.

That’s understandable man, and totally fair. Im not saying every level 3 in the wildy is a bot. It’s just within the past few weeks, there’s an exponentially greater amount of these, almost every world at every wilderness hotspot, you’ll see one of these every 10 minutes, and it definitely wasnt always the case. Using a scout is completely fair and smart, but using hundreds at a time that are bots makes it kind of ridiculous. If you watch the yt vid, there are plans you can purchase that let you control and gather information through using 20+ of these at a time.

Mod Archie also used to RWT before being employed, as did Ian Spam who is employed as an Esports caster (Maybe not anymore since DMM is on break) and countless other people who did in the past also. It's quite rare to find people that have played this game for that long who hasn't done something along the lines of RWT/botting
---
I hate that mobs or bosses with BIS uniques GWD have such good drops you barely care about the uniques half the time because an item that should be 60 mil is 3 mil due the standard drops being so good that shit tons of people do nothing but camp them.  Think about how exciting it is to get an ACB, yet on a non BTW when you get a BP which is 89123764 times better your reaction is "oh thats pretty cool". Zulrah is the worst in this aspect. It should have been a loss in profit but when you landed a BP it'd sell for what the best item in the entire game should be worth.

Would be dead content now in days with 30 man clans
---
People are saying he was kicked off the stage, bro walked off on his own accord
---
To you maybe? Str bonus is actually really important when it comes to having max gear. Every max hit counts and therefore every str bonus counts. Just 'cause this +1 str doesn't have *that* much of an impact right now (it still does have an impact on max hits) doesn't mean that it's just a small increase. A new +1 will make the original +1 stronger. It's a compounding effect.
---
Sparc mac never said he hasn't been invited, he openly states on stream often that he gets invited to countless events and turns it down usually giving a reason like he is busy or doesn't want to travel that far, he just keeps to himself and there's nothing wrong with that.
---
Holy fuck. That’s on par for Fat Nick’s stomach tattoos
---
That’s my swamp man
---
Damn, what a bitch. How can you be mad that you lost to the masterpiece that is 'Swampletics Exposed'?
---
It's only profitable now because it's new and BIS, and it isn't even good gp/hr for higher levelled accounts which are the group the buff was supposed to appease.
---
Having the price depend entirely on how willing people are to skip the task is absolutely horrendous game design. As it stands the price will drop rapidly until people decide they'd rather skip and do Vorkath/Zulrah for money, then the price will gradually decline as people accept that it's another 18k XP/hr task that is very likely going to cost them money. For it to not be dead content it needs to at least be afkable, pay for itself in supply cost, or outright be profitable. It'll be none of those things in a few months of people grinding it on task drop rate.
---
That's not the definition of BiS. Ferocious gloves are bis in every situation except few places like dks and cox (where you still bring them). Serp helm has more str and def bonus and is bis for melee situations.
---
In my minds eye I pictured some humanoid (don't know exactly what would make sense, but work with me) riding them and having the new neit Helm + lance + shield
---
It’s not even remotely shocking he lost to content related to swampletics. This community praises swamp man like he’s a god

ye as seeing the video this idea got in wrong hands, i remember we only used to scout for clans we were about to fight/scout their regroup worlds, or if it was about decent money like glory runners, clue scrollers at 50 ports etc. 
---
But using this at locations where ppl only risk 200k and it happens back2back2back2back2back is just annoying af. tbh i would've prob just sold my bank and went to staking if this happend to me lol. wildy already packed af, imagine being scouted first real quick so pker's can prepare to instant tb/freeze... ripppppp

What a damn child, that sub 2 minute video of swampletics exposed was more creative then him flinching and tic eating some god damn fucking monsters.
---
Doesn't change much for doing steel. You still make solid gp/hr and Smith xp. Coal bag just makes it a bit quicker. And makes mith or addy or rune much quicker.
---
He won best video maker or something. Not best individual video. I voted a long time ago so I don’t really remember the nominees or the categories

Wouldn’t expect anything less from a bunch of man child’s at a RuneScape convention, how immature
---
Most people don't really care about today, cuz it's mostly just the competition for content creators. Its not really even a competition, but more like a "hand selected by jagex as the best"
---
Tomorrow is when all the juicy stuff gets revealed like raids 3
---
I mean, ideally I agree with you. I'm just stating a more practical **post-development** chance would be to up their slayer level. A boss would have 1000% been more appropriate but they're not going to add a post-release boss as an afterthought.
---
And those thousands of people would do the exact same thing. Be super excited the first day and hop world's a bunch. Then quickly realise it does nothing, and instead just be helpful on the world's they play on, like all pmods are...
---
You just seem to have a hatred for pmods and think they're all about vanity.

Okay you're fucking blind it seems.

If they add dailies that are good enough exp/hr they would be balanced by only being able to do them 1 or 2 times per day. So that means if you want the best exp for your time spent you will do the daily. You're not forced the same way you're not forced to get a dpick from the wilderness. There's nothing wrong with logging in for a specific purpose, but there's no proof that not having dailies would cause those people not to log in at all. Why balance the content around being limited per day? Why not create content that gets people to log in whenever they want, which could be more or less than once per day?
