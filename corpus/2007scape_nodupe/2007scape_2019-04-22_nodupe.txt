Nice.

Do Slayer otherwise you‚Äôll just be xp wasting later on when you‚Äôre maxed combat but like 89 Slayer. I‚Äôm 93 Slayer and maxed everything but 97 Magic so I am more or less forced to burst/barrage anything I am able to otherwise I‚Äôm afk meleeing and not being as efficient as I could be.
---
Don't you know there are struggling swamp men in morytania who could use that, smh wasteful

Birdhouses are now used for the early hunter levels until chin hunting. You can farm seaweed instead of buying it for crafting, same as snake grass. The farming guild has sped up the acquisition of seeds and herbs for iron men thanks to farming contracts. Wintertodtis profitable firemaking until 99+. Probably a few others I‚Äôm missing

Every single day someone posts on here they lost money from fake streams. And every single day they wonder why they get ridiculed when they post it. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúnew stream‚Äù most link to the same fake site that steals your shit. I just wonder how you could input all your info, then your 2 step, then your bank pin. And wonder half way through... maybe this was a bad idea? Like the website never asks for Authenticator or bank pin like the fake site does. Jesus Christ mods just pin something to the top of this sub about fake streams, if twitch and jagex won‚Äôt do shit you can.

It's one of the quickest way to tell what to pray. You can do it even before the stomp. Aggro a healer wait to switch pray. Rinse and repeat just do something amd be ready to switch pray. Usually you don't have to switch but that's how I've done it and I'm a fucking scrub.
---
Reallly good idea please someone implement this
---
God damn
---
Only if the tokens look exactly like OPs.
---
It's a bitch to get to at low levels, the docks are confusing and there's no way to tell which boat goes to which location, there's no bank and the Slayer cave is probably the worst in the game.
---
No

They're only so disposable because they're lvl 3's, needing to make all their accounts all have a 150 total level will severely slow them down

There's a music video which kind of blew up into a meme called crab rave I think. People then took that and added complaints from the game to the music video, making the long-term complaints we have associated with the crabs.

tl;dr they are a symbol of complaining around here.

I have an older fire, not sure if it's still this way but just be aware you'll need to flash Google play store onto it to get osrs.

He didnt. He just started defensively casting magic so you don't get a lot of post 99 xp.
---
Lmao is this still possible ?

Can someone chime in ?

wow no one care turn off sensor swears noob lol
---
/r/suddenlygay ?
---
Ill tell you one thing. Jagex massively fucked up when they brought the EOC out. They spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours working on it and forced it on us, hence why we now have Oldschool runescape. The way old school works is if it doesn't get 75 percent vote in favour, it isnt getting added. So they can work on it all they want but its us who decides yes or no.
---
Oh, so what if they put Antman on the tip of Deadpool‚Äôs dick and he seduces Thanos?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen that mentioned. Seems pretty straight forward though right? 
---
Thanks for responding. Which version of the fire do you have and does it run OSRS well? How long does the battery last while playing? I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to an older model.
---
But 50/50 is 100%.
---

At what point is it worth it to start leveling Prayer past 43?

I like me a pillar that isn't constantly watching every fkn word he says just because some idiot like you would probably bitch about it. Pmods are players, so let them be players, not some politically correct hall monitors. In my experience people who complain about Pmods using offensive language are just bitter about the fact they never got that crown, and never will get that crown. So they just piss on the Pmods instead.

Q

Go to 70 asap
---
In that case scout with a non mod acc, mute them from afar.
---
You need the right level.

Check the defense requirement of the armor. You can do that by clicking the defense icon in your skills interface. Chances are, your defense level is too low.

Ok

Also from the wiki: " Elite clue scrolls can be between 5-7 (on rare occasions 8) clues long" ([https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Treasure\_Trails/Guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_Trails/Guide))

It's not a mods job (player mod or jmod) to go and monitor the chat. If someone is breaking rules in the chat, chat ranks can handle it. Otherwise, report things that break the rules and add to ignore list

What are some creatures that I can comfortably safespot with a maple short bow.  Trying to up my ranged (I have 54 rn,  aiming for 60ish), and grind some money while I‚Äôm at it.  Ideally I‚Äôm looking for an upgrade to my equipment (mith kiteshield, or addy legs), chaos/death runes, or anything alchable.  I might just do blue dragons because I desperately would like to get from 40 to 44 prayer.
---
Yeah it's not so bad, but those gorillas in the temple that can box you in are super annoying

This has got to me the most incredible RNG I've ever seen on this game

It's worth it! To think "Oh I need food, I better go fish" rather than "I need to do the most efficient method to get the most xp" is incredibly relaxing.

---
I chose not to include the running time to the Demonic Gorillas because it's only about 1 kill/hr worth of time spent and you can stay there an incredibly long trip anyways, not worth including unlike the Zulrah video where you have to bank multiple times/hr.
---
If you're not bad like me, you'll miss far less ticks. I'm confident with a Blowpipe you can do 75+ kills/hr, but you might need Dragon Darts, which would eat into profits a lot. For exact calcs though I'm only using the kills/hr I got in this video. I spent about 400k on supplies and Demonics are about 66-67k/kill so they're 4.6m/hr before supplies, about 4.2m/hr after. I'll round down to account for people without TBow.
---
With these rates, on-task Demonics are a bit below Vorkath and a bit above Zulrah at current prices, but what makes Demonics really good is their incredibly low gear requirement of just Arclight + Blowpipe, so if you can't afford a DHCB/Lance, then Demonics are an amazing moneymaker for you.
---
I did like maybe 4 hours of oak larders today and it really is boring. Should be a new way of training construction because doing the same thing like this all the way to 99 will KILL me

the reward sounds really good but i would make it so that the gloves (if they were ever released) would be at the same stats as black gloves, not mithril, because it would make mith glove grinding on pures pretty irrelevant for p2p if they could just do a boss to get them and not the quest and would also make the pures that have already grinded out mith gloves (yes i know its not much of a grind but its still pretty cancerous for those of us who dont like questing) kind of mad about it. This is all coming from a man who has never pk'ed in his life btw. just looking out for the community and making sure noone spams crabs in reddit for a year over some f2p gloves (again if they are ever released)

ghost mouse is a bot.. what are you talking about? you don't need to know the difference and it's not hard to tell what a bot acts like.

Raids, demonics, pking. Anywhere you need multiple combat styles

I've never done them myself, but I recently saw a thread about them. According to this video, its 74k xp/hr and about 50k gp/hr. So either I was misinformed or this video isn't completely accurate.

Either way, it's probably worth a shot. Definitely would break up the monotony.

I wish there was a version of Runescape where the devs acknowledged Slayer was a popular skill so they made combat better by adding things like action bar abilities, auto aggression pots and pets that pick up your loot for you.

Yeah at the very least will break up the monotony for me haha. Thank you for the advice!

&gt;Means that they are able to make their new content knowing that they will make their money back of people buying it or they will at least make enough to allow subs to cover the rest. The osrs team have to rely entirely on subs
---
99% of new content in the game can only be accessed via subs. If the game got zero new content, then player counts would plummet (we've seen this through the occasional dry spells on both rs3 and osrs). New content, in a way is designed to make people renew their sub so in a way they should make the money back in a similar albeit round about way as the WOW expansion business model you said. Yeah it's not the same but it has a similar effect/intent.

You hate them but merchers are the reason when you go to the GE to sell an item, some of them have more value than they otherwise would.

Don't understand honestly why people hate botters. If you really hate botters that much. Play ironman. And then guess what? They dont affect you at all.
---
They tried this for a long time, it just meant you'd get messages with 1000 symbols trying to spell out the words without actually spelling them out. A lot of (d0t) ¬© 0 nn type posts. Frankly I found those more obnoxious personally.
---
Then you'd get the other side where people who go to the GE and say shit like "First to type "etisgnillesdlog" backwards gets 1m!", and people would go it and get themselves muted because it was one of those flagged words.
---
-----------------------------------
---
Then if you want to go waaaaaaaaay back to the early days of classic, they tried doing a whitelist of words that you could use, and if you said anything that wasn't on that list, the message wouldn't go through. Pretty obvious with hindsight why that didn't work.
---
"Starts stealing my ores" implying they were yours to begin with. Better to just swallow your pride and hop. You'll get more XP that way. If you do get wrongfully banned for being reported multiple times then goodluck appealing. Seems nothing gets done without a front page Reddit post.
---
Firstly welcome to RuneScape! Quests are a great place to start. They help you get acquainted with different skills and help progress your character.

Bro get the fuckin pie your giving me anxiety.

Smells like a big ol lie

Damn nice! Enjoy the fresh lobs! The fishing guild looks quite fancy! Lol

I already hate questing enough now I gotta buy one extra item??? Fuck that I'm walking and wasting more XP. Tbh tho I will get it one day when I finally get tired of walking.
---
ive been thinking bout this for ages
---
I don't tend to SS my items for my own benefit? 
---
I mean
---
Dhcb, dfire Ward, tbow (literally bought it 3 weeks ago, had to sell a ton of stuff)
---
Full Arma, ancestral, bandos, rapier (got it at 300m ouch)
---
Defender, which of course needed to be alched... Pharoahs Sceptre, eternal glory, blowpipe + ddarts.
---
Make friends. Or fuck the torso and grind bandos. I would never give 25m to a bunch of pussies for a torso that will get replaced later.
---
Yeh I saw that afterwards. He should be fine
---
Hosidius is getting a touch up, not all of Zeah and Tithe Farm is getting touched as part of that, but not mechanically. Also, the proposed touch up has some issues as it removes the most optimal path as it only has two columns.
---
Obsidian is best until you have 92 HP, then you can use DH. You'll hit hard with DH now but you'll attack faster with obby generating more xp. Use Runelite and see which one is giving you the better XP per hour to see for yourself. You also won't have to worry about repairs with obby. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I believe DH will be more AFK which sounds like is what you want. It's defence bonus are higher so you'll take less damage. You might lose on the xp/h rate, but you also might do better on your finals with more time studying and less playing OSRS.

What you really need are barrow glvoes. Ain't no one want to see those white ass hands.

Lost most my cash with a poor decision on a flip when I first started flipping. Went to kill some guards to take my mind off the stupid mistake and some random guy comes up to me and just gives me a mil. Never been given cash before but I never needed it more than then. I took him to the blue moon for a beer and thanked him. It's players like this guy that make osrs such a great game.
---
The last time the rapier was 300M was January 12th which is the very latest you could have bought it at that price. So you‚Äôre telling me you started runescape on October 30th, and in a matter of roughly 60 days made the stats plus money to buy rapier?? And you don‚Äôt have all these place holders in your bank to show you had them? (let me guess the hacker removed your place holders or you don‚Äôt use them). 
---
Your whole story is BS stop farming reddit for karma and sob stories.
---
Yeah at 99 range.. there‚Äôs about 13m xp between 1 and 99...

I just started playing again last weekend after stopping RS3 2 or 3 months after EOC. Been really enjoying getting back into the game. So far I've mostly been doing quests and trying to build up my bank a bit. [Here are my current stats.](https://imgur.com/kxNIufy) I'm sitting on 145 QP and I figure I'm about 15 quests off barrows gloves. I have about 10m usable bank atm.
---
I've always found that setting goals and achieving them makes the game the most fun for me. I'm trying to set goals that will get my account ready for later game PvM. So far my goal list is;
---
Short term:
---
* 70+ Melee stats
---
* 75+ Range and Magic
---
* Barrows gloves
---
* Fire Cape
---
* Torso
---
Medium term:
---
* Quest cape
---
* 70 prayer
---
* 83 construction
---
* all medium diaries
---
Long term;
---
* 90+ combat stats
---
* All hard diaries.
---
I think these goals will help set up my account for PvM and the diary goals will help keep my account balanced. I figure by the getting all the hard diaries will essentially give me 70+ base stats. 
---
A few questions I have are;
---
1. 70 prayer and 83 construction are my buyable goals I figure both will cost about 30m in total. How should I priorities these? Is it worth just trying to make the money as fast as possible and get them done or should I build up gear first then do them after? 
---
2.   Should I add void to the short term goals? I can't find a answer on if it worth sinking time into.
---
3. Is there anything else I should add to the list? Most of the goals are going off my knowledge from 6+ years ago and there is a lot of new content that I'm not aware of.
---
Sorry for long post and thanks in advance for any help.
---
Lol I saw this as a comment not that long ago, not a bad idea
---
Yeah I did that, app released on August 6th for Android mobile.  I made purchases for mobile in September, so obviously October 30th does not hold up.
---
I'm in the exact same boat. Was so focused on beefing up my stats that I never stopped to smell flowers. Made a f2p hcim and I haven't played my main with my full attention in a few months. Just enjoying my f2p btw. Want a mage amulet on my main? Buy it and that's it. Want it on my btw? Better get that crafting and magic up. I have never cherished a gold bar like the one from goblin diplomacy. Now that they have added beginner clues to f2p it just adds another level of fun. My user is OSRSplayer43 if you want a f2p btw friend.
---
Letting a ML model automatically ban people without human oversight would cause a shit storm of false bans.
---
And neither does your story of starting in November
---
**Barman:** "Can I get you a Drink, Gentlemen?"  
---
**Animal Abuser:** "I'll have a.. hmm... . ....        ....a Blueberry special please!"  
---
**Barman:** "Certainly! ..but why the long pause?"   
---
**Animal Abuser:** "Oh..., I just got them from my Giant Mole slayer task".  
---
**Pyromaniac:** That shit's lit dawg.  
---
**Psychopath:** Im going for a stroll.
---
I've also got a strictly f2p hcim. What can I say? I like to suffer.
---
I mean legitimately I know jagex won't do shit, I just want to know how this could have happened.  Because --- I mean I honestly don't understand it, I can grind back all the items eventually just - I don't understand how this happened.
---
Rare? No
---
valve unnerf claidmeamh mor pls
---
Except botter time is far cheaper than Jagex time. Essentially free
---
Sorry for not remembering my true start date?
---
I thought I started in November but my Google play account says I made purchases in September.
---
Imagine if you had your accounts items stolen man I just want to get some idea of how this happened.
---
Brb killing myself for you.
---
Takes less time and takes you tiny bit closer to bank. Ofcourse deep wildy works differently
---
1 of 2 ways. Either you clicked a phising link and gave them all your info or got a virus or you use the exact same  login info for other stuff and there was a database leak which is why you use unique info for everything. 100% of all runescape hacks are those 2 things
---
You're too kind.
---
Hardly. Not developers could dedicate all their spare time (if not work it as their job) to doing this, while Jagex can only devote a small amount of time to this.
---
But how do they get past the bank pin and authenticator step?
---
Do some quests. If you are p2p check out the achievement diary requirements and work toward them (they include needing access to places via questing, skilling, and exploring different areas of a specific region). I honestly think they have been an amazing addition to the game and I recommend all new players look into them. They even have their own specific rewards :)
---
&gt; only bot clients screens go red when a random event appears
---
Only people that have used a bot client would know this.
---
Are U botting fam???
---
I mean i just don't think they'll reset me, I just need to figure out how someone cracked my bank pin and auth.
---
id kill to have a penance fighter pet
---
Two thumbs up
---
If it was phising they have all that because you told them. If it was database it is easy to remove authenticator since they can log into all of your accounts.
---
Yea sorry man I'm just trying have some fun with a shitty situation. I genuinely feel bad for what happened considering you seem to have taken the appropriate steps to secure your account. Good luck I hope you find the answers you're looking for.
---
1) With your stats, just let your bank accumulate over time. Herb runs + birdhouse runs are going to be the best way for you to do this. If you've done fossil island, I'd recommend starting birdhouse runs ASAP. It's the best hunter XP for time invested at lower levels, and the birds nests + seeds really add up. Gear isn't a huge deal at that point in the game tbh, as long as you can afford the basics (Whip, glory, blowpipe, runes, food, pots, etc.) you're set.
---
2) Yes, elite void should be on that or the medium term list. Void isn't a take everywhere armor, but for the situations you do use it there's really nothing better. Also, unlocking elite void unlocks crystal halberd, which is also a niche but very useful spec weapon.
---
3) Kandarin, Western Province, and Varrock hard diaries are all very beneficial. If you want to be a 100% efficient player, then I'd recommend doing birdhouse runs to 73+ hunter then doing black chins to 99. Black chins are pretty unique, in that they're the best hunter xp/h in the game AND they're amazing profit. Doing 73-99 at black chins is over 100m profit, which will set yourself up nicely for later in the game. 77 prayer, rigour, and augury deserve a spot in your medium/long term goals as well, rigour is kind of expensive but 100% worth it.

There was a sizable portion of essential oils involved in the making thereof.

Hmm nevermind my auth was disabled not sure how that happened..
---
Bank pin not sure how they cracked that, it was the numbers of the house I lived at when I was a kid.
---
So much effort Judy to have no effect on spamming.
---
Yeah my bad you must be some kind of comedic genius. Your whole life‚Äôs a joke. Did you base your entire argument off one Bo Burnham song or are there some layers I‚Äôm missing?
---
Oh no
---
Left to right:
---
slayer, firemaking untrimmed, runecraft, graceful
---
Security and recovery is by another team, the team has expanded so more content can be created at the same time.
---
I think OP is trying to get something other than Anchovy Pizzas 
---
So when he got them as a drop, he humorously pretended that is what he wanted all along
---
Leave me alone, the wilderness is way too scary for me to get a d pick as a btwman, all them spooky salads out and about
---
I think the majority of everyone
---
Final/ Southern part of Zeah and the rest of the desert finished off. Would be really cool to see OSRS Map finally completed; whatever them areas entail for content.
---
Some more content around Morytania and a more accessible way for ironmen/women to get vials of blood rather than it being locked behind ToB. Iirc, a new grandmaster quest is in development?
---
/notopbutokay
---
Wym? Never did the quest
---
Wait so you just found a bunch of unscratch runescape pre-paid membership cards? :c
---
You mean monopoly money
---
There's a fucking tent in Shayzien with a table the size of Varrock east bank. It's absurd.
---
Friends
---
I get my chaos from barrows with iban staff
---
I've made this exact post b4 basically but the slippery slope fallacy is too mighty.   
---
"give jagex an inch and they'll take a mile."
---
This changes everything.
---
If I have to use an inventory slot on a waterskiing my day is ruined.
---
Jagex /= mods btw. Just saying
---
my issue is that cosmetics in osrs are earned. buyable ones devalue a lot of rewards that come from actual content, clues, minigames, other grinds.
---
&gt;Because I believe they are inevitable. 
---
you act like osrs hasn't had mtx for years now... just because it's via bonds to support main accounts, alt accounts and so on, or fund some dudes bank cuz he can't afford to grind gp cuz he's busy irl doesn't mean they arent mtx.
---
Just ruined some poor cucks lives.
---
Awh fuck it. We're all here anyway.
---
Exactly, it's an RPG. It's meant to be played as each player sees fit. Personally I welcome the new content as another option to choose from in regards to what I want to do when I log in for a game session.
---
The second it leaves your hand it is no longer affected by the armor.
---
Yes! You're right lol, that's what it was.
---
That place is just a giant chunk of dead content and I consistently forget it exists.
---
I think our current level of mtx is enough, not sure why you would volunteer to add more
---
do it
---
99 slayer without desert treasure...
---
It's cooler tho and lvl 50s think I'm a magician when wielding it.
---
No, stop accusing me of sh\*t, it was my skillers account, I got 75 just to hold use an AGS for fun, who the hell would make this sort of account to sell anyway
---
...^^^^warding?
---
mining iron ore for 2+ hours can make even the richest of men feel the way Mod Arlind was feeling
---
shaking my smh my  head
---
meh even if they were the same tier as dragon knives they'd be fine. you'd have the downside of having no spec bar still
---
He flames zanik
---
Not a fan tbh, not really trying to watch RuneScape soccer.
---
I hate the clue scroll steps in there
---
No because the chance for a specific unique stayed the same. Might be wrong tho
---
it makes sense lol. Assume op is referring to upper: then the OP's post makes no sense because it is better to mine the same node anyways. IF he is referring to lower level: then he cant really call anyone a noob because he is using the lower level lmao.
---
jesus, please organise this
---
With due respect if you didn't have a bank pin, that's your own fault and we'll leave that there.
---
If someone gained access to your account, that means they've known your details for a while or recently got hold of that information, probably the latter since most people who hack will take wealth off immediately.
---
Sounds like you were Ratted; normally always undetectable and goes unnoticed. Iirc, the only ways you can get them is by downloading something that looks normal but isn't. Exe.files are a good culprit, though not always.
---
Oh shit lmao
---
If you have the wildy cat or some shit you can farm behemeth( dont know how it‚Äôs spelt) for guaranteed 4 does spices of your choice. There‚Äôs 4 mini bosses, you can also do it with a regular cat.
---
It's lazy game devs using the same assets twice for the sake of being lazy.  Shit needs to stop.
---
How did you have a 2B bank but no bank pin
---
link pls
---
It would be kinda cool if they made harder optional waves for a chance to get the transmog with slightly harder mechanics
---
hard rumble is going to be more xp but less afk. like the other reply said their attack stats get buffed but their defense doesnt so you hit them the same. with normal mode you can do 20 minute afk nmz though  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RF3eN63MgU, you cant do this with hard mode
---
Bullshit, my new iron i made recently is 3k days old.
---
Since getting 91 rcing I use the house fairy ring method for crafting nats. It's better xp for me than the abyss as I'm 70 mining and 75 agility. I think abyss is only faster at like 99 mining and agility because you never fail. I get 26k so p/h with fairy rings and like 22k xp p/h at abyss
---
incorrect, Im merely pointing out that the anti virus program isnt the problem. 
---
But just to appease you during this conversation i even looked inside the System 32 files. Nothing.
---
If it was a keylogger they would much rather have my bank information or even my Black Desert account.
---
Appreciate your constructive criticism tho.
---
Defender is actually the most fun once you get it down
---
Is that really him?
---
It's for the sake of adding something cool to the game.
---
It‚Äôs funny how we‚Äôre so aggressive toward each other in game whereas you‚Äôll never see that shit walking across another person on the street
---
It's fun until you get burned and then it's a chore. Until it's fun again
---
Just fuckin chill out man
---
no, this used to be against the rules years ago, but now its explicitly allowed. you can check for yourself here in the section called "Multiple logging-in" https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules
---
Warding, but simplified a tiny bit and no battle wards is a solid Yes from me
---
Vorkath
---
You don't have to mine the essence, and mobs like gargoyles drop quite a bit.
---
Crafting runes through the abyss is like ~3k/hr which isn't bad at all tbh.
---
Sometimes its easier to do the phone
---
I wish there were weapons that were slow but hit harder that had dps comparable to whip on tasks.
---
I always loved using dragon battleaxe over scimmy back in the day just for those big hits.
---
pure ess you get passively through slayer. Konar's slayer provides the necessary ess to carry you into the mid game, where you start zulrah, after zulrah you begin CoX and then you have quite literally an infinite supply.
---
I had one at 9 steps before, got 212k that's what's up.
---
Not recommended but whatever floats yer boat I guess.
---
That‚Äôs really cool. Do you stay entertained pking on that?
---
Perfevt wife for Sparc Mac
---
Buy bonds
---
You can barrage Abby Demons for 80k+ xp/h, it‚Äôs aids because you get teleported around, but it‚Äôs quick and frees up a block for Wyrms or Drakes.
---
Welp, the content we really deserve
---
Is the reason I bought members (one of the reasons) but they really aren't worth doing
---
Yeha I mean, imagine paying somebody to do all the work so you don't have to!
---
r/woosh
---
That's the issue. Rune requires 40 defense (or attack for the weapons) to use. Bronze and iron require 1, steel is 5, black is 10, mithril is 20, adamant is 30, rune is 40, dragon is 60.
---
 Yeah most of the time once they pray range it‚Äôs over. I just get to prey on low levels and grief people I guess. It‚Äôs a weird niche and was a waste of 150m or so
---
if its still 1/1k rolls then ofc not , ppl who say yes obviously dont have clue in math.
---
what actually changed its the chance to get any kind of boots (decreased btw).
---
My friend and I are on a tutorial island to quest cape run and just did 9 quests yesterday. Not the easy ones either, we‚Äôre already at &gt;150qp. It was brutal
---
They are rather expensive at almost 10k for 100 instead of like what?  250 for 100 mind runes.  They do not do enough damage to be worth it for many things.
---
Lmao, it‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôd believe him
---
I dont remember the exact defence i had, but it was somewhere around 65-70
---
I did a banshee task and it took about 40 minutes and I got 300 essence.  I can mine much faster than that.
---
&gt; OSRS doesn't need a new skill
---
How much higher do you think my range should be in order to finish this thing?
---
Assuming I keep my 1 def.
---
I think it is because of one person being too lazy to get a proper image, all the viewers of the post are wasting their time wondering why the text is there
---
Maybe we should combine all the threads of users getting hacked recently and see if we can figure out a common thread between us all.
---
7 billion lmfao good luck with that
---
You gotta try for that b2b
---
I did it last night for the first time, I‚Äôd put it off a very long time and actually just used Rue Scim till I was high enough for a whip...
---
Won‚Äôt lie took me longer than the guide I used claimed, but I fucked up and took the wrong bones so when I made the GreGree I got an ape one not a kajarman monkey one, get the bones yourself en route as you don‚Äôt know where the monkey bones you buy in the GE came from!
---
It really wasn‚Äôt that bad and the jungle demon was a cake walk.
---
Stan pots and prayer pots and the highest healing food you‚Äôre willing to pay for will all make life easier - also ring of duelling for the duel arena tele is ever so handy for how close to a glider you tele to!
---
It will net you just as much def xp as defensive casting ancients, just at a much slower rate. 50 damage is 50 damage regardless of spell type.
---
Nigga you got the boots under drop rate.  Stop pitying yourself because someone got more.
---
When I want to sell damaged barrows items, instead of repairing them I just drop them so they break and then sell them
---
My Pet'ion and KQ disagree

 Q

In 2005 and onwards for years there was actually a gnome ball league that was run from the runescape official forums, every team had a uniform and all the teams would meet up in gnome stronghold and would use the empty houses as specific team houses. We would meet up every Sunday to do this in game. 
---
Everyone was between the combat levels of like 50-110.
---
Unironically the gnomeball community was the most fun I ever had in runescape.
---
Bis ranged boots definitely
---
You can't punch xXdaddymaster69Xx in the face over an online video game, so it makes sense.
---
Relatable
---
Always go for B2B
---
It's the law
---
With low prayer bonus, 60 prayer, and rune crossbow, and being inexperienced, he'll need a lot of prayer pots.
---
Yes.
---
You're not making any sense.
---
Prices are discovered by a trackrecord of transactions where you can look the recent ones and the whole history of deals. A new item lacks all of that.
---
It can just be a 1 hour mute that doesn‚Äôt get recorded as an offense
---
Prob cause it‚Äôs the best solo money making boss in the game
---

---
Nah. Just significantly nerf drop tables across the board.

Assuming someone has clinical depression because they don't want to work or go to school :')

I mean shit I‚Äôm a noob still on f2p and I have a mule alt, i can imagine people into more high level shit also need to have their alts able to access memebers content and such
---
No way this is real, this needs to be a troll.
---
Good old runescape classic, loved the color of dragon items nack then with the rune armor
---
much needed update
---
Really good suggestion minus the clue drops. Guaranteed hard clue for members seems too good.
---
&gt; in that order of importance
---
Ascending or descending?
---
Yea and its like a 4 square range of attacking an opponent
---
Just pick one or two roles to focus on and simply read their wiki entry, it's really not that hard. Remember what you have to call, and what will get called to you and what your overall job is. 
---
I'd just join the Barbarian Assault world and get into the first room, it's the luck of the draw but I went in there for the diary and downed the queen first try within an hour with the group I had.
---
It helps being positive and open when you have newcomers, telling them that failing is not a problem will reduce the likelihood of someone leaving.
---
Who even logs into reddit on the pc? Neck beard
---
Well, there's one edgy and misunderstood dialogue box during rag n bone man that I don't want to say anything else about.
---
Slayer GOOD
---
Construction is so addicting to level imo when using the fast xp methods. It‚Äôs so dope watching your xp bar keep flying up even in the 90s getting 1mxp/hr lmao
---
Anyways
---
Do you do custom work? I have a few new bosses I‚Äôve come up with and want to pay someone to do a few portraits.
---
Well played sir.
---
If anything this sounds like RuneScape NFL, given the plays, the blocking, and tactic resets each time a goal was scored.
---
Though I do agree - I‚Äôm not here for sports
---
You're 100% correct, no idea why people downvote you lol
---
This isn‚Äôt even dry lol
---
It's the current year honey, b gloves aren't bis for melee/mage for slayer
---
I know, it's more of a personal challenge than anything else
---
I want that hat tbh
---
I use super restores, similar price and give more prayer. 
---
Supplies used to be a deciding factor when pvming for me, but when you can make 4.5m/h at hydra, or 3.5m/h at gorillas, buying supplies doesn‚Äôt require any second thought.
---
? The only single combat task I do is dark beasts. For barrage tasks camping slaughters is better for overal xp/hr and for cannoning I camp expeditious (except at dagganoth). Not everyone plays the game the same way you do lol.
---
sameee 99 agi too
---
Are you a communist?
---
Not all of it.
---
I play with the mentality that if an Ironman can't do what I do, I won't do it. I'll still buy a dwarven stout (m) instead of doing 2 more levels because I have the cooking level to make them.
---
?????? The bracelets are a massive boost in slayer xp/hr long term
---
Never knew you could put an egg in a bowl and I've been playing since 2004.
---
i tried it but have'nt gotten a reply yet...
---
I like it, the rewards might need some work, but big YES to having a boss at the end of Stronghold dungeon!
---
all aboard the train for the burnt players
---
Quest bad. Slayer good.
---
A pioneer of runescape
---
what do you mean by everyone using apple? like having a mac computer? Are they more.vulnerable to hacking?
---
Looking cool Joker!
---
? You can easily get 50k xp/hr long term with no alts with the right block list. Did 87 - 95 slayer like that for hydra.
---
LOL
---
Huh? They can definitely still commit crimes in jail.
---
I also tried that and same thing, told me to fuck off
---
The fucks with all those chromes.
---
Yeah but they're trash slayer xp with the current meta
---
PANIC SELL PRAYER POTS.
---
It might be pink eye
---
lmao wtf
---
Thanks for that!
---
I'm at kc 36, i got torags legs at kc 6
---
compared to scale cost, the ammo cost is insignificant. 
---
also is irrelevant if you train ranged to 99 by chinning first &amp; use range cape from then on
---
\&gt;Nope I don't want to :/  
---
FTFY
---
Why would they be working on warding if it has not passed the poll yet?
---
you didn't miss much, it was a ton of talk about warding and if I could sum it up shortly they basically said to give them feed back and look through the blog, apparently they want to hold a playtest that some people that live in the uk would beable to attend. I don't recall any question that wasn't warding related.
---
He used to be a member though. Probably did the wildy altar.
---
Plus if you‚Äôre doing it in stages you can use chivalry for some time which is still a good bit better
---
Jagex figured out this trick long ago, they just have to switch names of items and the community will eat it up.
---
Want polypore staff guys? community: noooooooo easyscape!
---
want trident guys? community: wow so innovate yes please!
---
If jagex wants summonning, they'd just call it "definitely not summonning" and it'd pass.
---
I feel like dissasocating give me some ur what this guy is smoking
---
Stick to one role until you're done with it then go next. Remember that horn takes priority above all. Bring a tanky setup.
---
Also way less.
---
Been this way since farming was released, how you only just now realized?
---
I guess it's just not that funny lol
---
Your mom did. Oh believe me...she cared.
---
Weast
---

Bro I need whatever shit you been smoking for 420 lol

Yep, just trying to get master clues. Had 1 master and the three boots

Okay thanks guys, im going to chuck it into the GE soon i think. I think its the equivalent of a normal shortbow too.

Merchers just make something available at a (usually) small premium on demand, and will buy things on demand for a discount. It's basically a service, but you can get a better price if you wait.

let me get this straight. You got triggered so hard because youre watching someone play a video game differently than you, you make a reddit post to rage at the developers for making a setting that allows you to customize your zoom? did i miss anything?

Yes timmy the joke is that the concept of riding something and the word impaling can be used together to insinuate a sexual setting

you're getting memed pretty hard right now but i fucking love this. i love you.
---
Bring a lot of prayer pots and protect from melee whilst you‚Äôve got a cannon up and you can get from 70-75 range in a relatively short amount of time. Just costs a little bit but isn‚Äôt too bad. Make sure you bring very high healing food. The rangers at dags shouldn‚Äôt be hitting all too often unless you‚Äôre 1 def I suppose.
---
I'd be disgusted if he got 1st, I'm disgusted and unimpressed since he got 2nd

you're dumb af tho

I'd be ok with this

The title and the math doesn't add up.  
---
\~30 clues, had 20 before the log, has 55 in the log.  
---
20 before the log would make 75 in total.   
---
where the 30 came from, no clue.
---
I have to say, a lot of things are taken from rs3, the achievement diaries and its rewards, the rewards from slayer masters, the ghrazi rapier is kind of the chaotic rapier from dungeoneering, trident - polypore staff, idk, lots of things, but the game has to move forward, ppl want new things to kill, new rewards not the same endgame so theyve been filling holes and releasing tons of niche shit and wont go past lvl 75 just yet but thats just how it is, it simply cant stay as 07scape forever, it can have the same essence but not stay up-updated you know what i mean? Also what kind of updates can they give, obviously it has to be something useful, if they were to release a new type of green shrimp that heals 3hp and cures poison theyd get shit on, its gotta be something that improves the gameplay. Also keep in mind that everything gets polled and showcased before it gets released so at the end of the day its the community thats been building the game to how it is right now
---
B)
---
They have gone up since I posted this. I was using them to pk and now I cant buy for 20% above the marked price. Regret isn't the word cant even pk with them now

Alching costs money, more than the cost in natures so doesn't profit.
---
Bots aren't doing it for easy levels, they do it in masse to sell the gold to other players for cash.

It's slow but since it takes Jagex forever to take action they can send off the millions of GP to a bank mule account and dump the account before it gets banned.

Oh lol, true :D

Good meme

Drops on runes are random, but I feel like at max I've gotten 1300 mind runes, 600-700 chaos runes and nearly 500 death/blood runes. Obviously not all together at once, but that was the most I'd seen of any one rune. Just gotta go into it with enough to get you through ~10-15 runs and you'll come out on top, on average.
---
How long would it take me then?
---
I didn‚Äôt even eat once until the fight was over lol. Look at the inventory. Empty space is from the pre fight anglerfish.

My links are not old reddit, but im using old reddit. U can set it up in the settings

This happens to me and when I notice they are being rude I dont bother to talk to them and they hop! Stop giving negative people your attention!

Very nice now go quest
---
Probably won't like my answer but runecrafting is your best bet. An incentive to level up a tedious skill if anything
---
I like it. The dude's build epitomizes the "play how you want" style of gameplay which everyone on this sub seems to have forgotten about.

You know you can set reddit to always use the old style in your preferences right?

But there's nothing that ties the RSN Dankweed to recovering my account. That is not useful information. It is literally as useful to an account recovery as the amount of prayer points you have left.

That's why it's a meme. The only people who use their RSN to login still are those with a decade+ old account, AND have never changed their username before. That's going to be a slim number of people. But even for those who do, knowing the username of an account you're trying to recover is literally the least important part of an account recovery, because it's **public facing information.** You can recover an account without the name.
---
&gt; For example, ~~if I know your username for Runescape is DankWeed,~~ I can use information that you MAY have posted to help aid me into recovering your account or finding more info about you to find more email addresses linked to you to try and get into other accounts.
---
If you're posting all your recovery answers, or posting the email and password of your account, or giving out your name, phone number, SSN, address and blood type, ya no shit that's going to compromise your account, but that has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not your post your RSN. 
---
Your account is no more, and no less, secure because your name is visible in a screenshot. That has literally nothing to do with your account being insecure because you post a bunch of personal information.

I was at Corp last night and I spec‚Äôd a 50-49. This was in a 4 man and we all had bgs/dwh to lower his def.

Just enough money to buy the skillcape! :D

Happened to me as a kid, my mom canceled my membership and they thought the card was stolen so reimbursed her and added negative membership days to my account. I couldn't even log in to F2P.

 We had to buy the prepaid cards and enter those to get it out of the negative days.

Sounds like you recognize yourself in my comment kid. Its oke man.

Feels great for the 2 levels until you hit 77.  Blood and Souls to 99 :).
---
Thanks!
---
Dude yes I would get so fucking triggered I would leave.
---
Always happy to continue the roast!
---
I like the idea but I think it deviates too much from the main game. It's a fantasy game about slaying monsters and questing, and I feel like some sort of sports minigame is not really what you want to respresent runescape  with in the esports scene.
---
Not hating on the idea, just my thoughts about it.
---
Yeah I went for 98 def. Back in the old days of rs. Just loved not getting hit as much
---
I doubt it tbh, had people telling me if I'm mobile only I had to have started on October 30th though.  (iOS release date)

the 3a bow is super powerful. can you try it on some bosses pl0x? i wanted to know if it holds up well against the Tbow in DPS

well thyere 77 gp ea now, and you shoot 2000 per hour, so thats 154k gp cost per hour. That's quite a lot, MSB(i) with amethyst arrows would be the same dps, at a way lower cost.

Methscape
---
you can also learn to solo raids (CoX) and not risk your items. the only thing you would lose are some basic supplies, like pots and food
---
If you're doing nmz obby is the best until like 93 hp then dharroks. 
---
Max str gear and rapier  barely passes obby if you can have man str... Prims tasssets chest plate or torso torture serp helm etc.

I didn't say he strictly used melee, I simply said using a cannon makes not having Ava's better, since you don't lose nearly as much ammo.
---
Oh boy where do I even begin.
---
The vast vast majority of people do not train slayer efficiently.
---
People train Hunter in all sorts of weird ways, there was some guy in the reddit cc doing falconry to 80 the other day
---
Pretty much all resource gathering skills, people will be running around gathering any resource regardless of efficiency. Like you'll see plenty of non irons mining addy ores for example.
---
Lots of people do Brimhaven agility arena.
---
People farm a fuckton of random shit. Lots of people do allotments well into the 70s and 80s just because they like it.
---
Lots of people train RC by just doing the highest rune they can instead of looking into the more "efficient" methods like lavas, steams, or nats. Even though steams are a sweet spot between xp rates and profitability
---
And there is so, so, so much more.
---
this some gay shit
---
I hear ironmen running around saying they need more herb seeds to do herb runs...I have like 2600 total I still need to farm....
---
That‚Äôs a great edit tho

yes, good to see my former students teach raids to new raiders

I usually got 2 kills per trip, sometimes 3. I used a DHCB with adamant ruby (e) bolts &amp; amethyst broad bolts. I want to say I used roughly 400 of each bolt but honestly wasn't paying too close attention. Weakened Vork with a BGS spec, used desert amulet 4 to restore stats and used 1 sip of Ranging, Anti-Venom &amp; Extended Antifire and 2 sips of Super Restores (out of ppots in my bank or I'd use those) per trip. Used Monkfish and Karambwan but when I ran out of Karambwans on the last 30 kills I just took monks.
---
Recipe for Diaster quest is a great point to aim for.  It gives you one of the best pairs of gloves in the game (Barrows) and lets you experience a lot of the game through questing.  It should also take your levels up to a decent amount.

Since they've been working at filling in the map, I expect in 2020 they'll continue this with the Desert. Perhaps even a throwback to 2005 when they did "Desert Month" by finishing the entirety in multiple large updates. The Southern part of Zeah, Varlamore, is another option, but I feel like they've avoided doing Zeah content year after year so I can see them taking a year off following Kebos and going elsewhere. Aside from that, it is hard to say. The Desert can easily tie into a bunch of other stuff like quests and if it also rules of Varlamore for 2020, that is like half the expected content covered.
---
Going off my 2018 Runefest Bingo, there still that Fremennik Quest we've yet to see; I believe it was planned for 2019 between Kebos and Prif but doesn't seem like it is happening then now. That said, it could still very well happen before RuneFest or in 2019 post-Runefest. Acheron is a pretty out there one but it would likely be tied to future Fremmy quests and I doubt we're far enough along with that. It could be that we get the 2019 Fremmy quest then in 2020 we get the finale quest, but if they are doing Desert I'd expect that to be their big quest of the year.
---
Given their recent reprioritization, I actually think we may get some announcements for big updates to existing content. Stuff like the long-awaited Brewing overhaul, the Fossil Island Boss, Guild Reworks, and such. It is also possible they could continue an old questline that isn't to grandmaster state yet like Vampyres even or more of the Kourend quest line. There is also Yama on Zeah; probably not a headline update unless it is part of a quest though.
---
So if I was to make a final prediction of the reveals, I'd say a big Desert Update (likely with Grandmaster Quest), continuation of a smaller quest series, a big update to some existing content like Guilds or Brewing, and something else to round out the presentation. Aside from what is presented, I'd expect them to cover a lot more of the above and probably focus a fair bit more on existing content over the near year than they have in the past.

It does fit historically as well, Berserkers are more or less equal to vikings and their weapon and armor set consisted of sword, sax (a short sword), axe, spear, bow and arrows, shield, helmet and chainmail. The bladed rings or chakrams are of Indian heritage, and Indians is definitely not something the vikings were unaware of as they went as far as persia wirh Ingvar the far-travelled and a statue of Buddha was found in a small Swedish viking town. There is no proof they had been to India however the evidence shows that it is possible that vikings and thus berserkers were aware of chakrams but I don't think they wnated or even tried to learned to use them.

here's the thing, kid.
---
i've done 6 months of DBT- dialectical behavior therapy. 
---
you know who does DBT? people with PTSD: people who've been raped, who've been IED bombed in the line of combat serving their country, people who've been teleblocked and spellbook swap ice barraged by a pker with dclaws and an AGS in deep wildy while doing their clue scroll, only to find out they're accidentally carrying their 8m cash stack and scroll book with 3m in teleports in it because it's 3 am and they're tired, along with nose sniffly from doing a line of cocaine because they want to be the top cluescroller on crystal math labs 
---
those are the people who do DBT.
---
i've done my therapy- and you know what? i'm in a good place right now.
---
but you? are you in a good place right now? you're a gamer- and you know what video games cause? video games cause mental illness and make you hate minorities. people who hate minorities? they're not right in the head.

That said, a lot of players don't care about making things useful if it isn't relevant to endgame. Like I doubt there is much demand to make Seercull a good level 50 bow, even if it makes sense for the item. And either way, any update to it, BiS or not, would likely give merchants a window to profit. Still, it isn't great to let items like these exist in the current state just because a few players bought a bunch.

Actually range tank is extremely specific. It implies a range based combat level the same way that zerker implies 45 def.

Aside from having my bank accounts attached to my PC and phone, which would be a nice steal for anyone as they have a nice sum of money in them. I also still have access to and have not lost 2 other accounts that each have a chunk of wealth on then aswell as a black desert online account that would easily be worth thousands on the black market.
---
I wont say its 100% not possible but I cant see why a single runescape account, value of like $500 would be targeted over 10s of thousands.
---
That being said it's cool of your friend to have shown you how that works so you can prevent it in the future... there is also a couple of web pages i know of

yes. Spend the money so we don't have to, and the game will be around for a while.

it's not great. youll waste chins due to overkill and such. chinning in the mm2 caves is very inexpensive for the absolutely massive xp/hr you get.

There are 15 spawns in there. Unless he's on your spawns he isn't hurting you. You went out of your way to sabotage him acting like you own the whole area.

can you build oak stuff? move on to oaks. cut at rimmington, enter poh. tell butler to make you planks, leave house, cut logs. repeat.

You‚Äôre right, and I‚Äôm not so much scared of dying as I am concerned by my how frustrating my previous attempts at Vorkath were. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm by any means a noteworthy mechanical player, but I‚Äôm starting to learn some of the ‚Äúmore challenging‚Äù (quotes because I know to some people it‚Äôs basic) mechanics like 1 tick flicking prayer and kiting, and as long as my connection is okay I can manage, but I found it absolutely maddening when a kill would be going great and then suddenly I get 1-2 seconds of my clicks not registering when Vorkath does his aerial one-hit attack and I‚Äôd be down 100k from nothing I did wrong. Eventually when I can afford to upgrade my internet setup I plan to camp Vorkath/Zulrah and take some shots at the other more challenging bosses, but for now I‚Äôm just looking to try my hand at the ones with less punish potential for being late or missing an occasional action
---
Would a 42 attack, strength, defence, mage and 99 range void pure be a good account?
---
Yep right around 70 is when you start making money
---
Mage is almost 100% fucking with someone to make them leave or got crashed by someone so he's trying to fuck up their xp.
---
Been in both situations

Waste of NMZ points, you can teleport to trollheim, drop 2 food, tele to a bank, get 2 more food and tele back to trollheim for the same effect.

so half your shit is missing and somehow you still want someone to confirm what is already confirmed.

Either you got rid of your shit or you got hacked if it wasn't you its someone else you don't need someone to fucking hold your hand to say everyting
---
Of all the communities I've ever been a part of, this community seems to understand the least that other people exist and have different tastes.
---
If you look at the original thread you will see that there isn't much hate towards the guy. Mostly people asking him questions on how he did it and so on. 
---
In the end, most people are just in disbelief that someone would be willing to put himself throught this eventhough he is just playing the game in a way that is enjoyable for him.
---
Thanks

Uhm and?

why a photo. why. we have literally more ways to save a screen shot than there are files to save it as..

I met the dude on the left in a pure clan and gave him my phone number over IRC just over 10 years ago. We'd text, talk on the phone and play games whenever time allowed. I got tired of making "jokes" about meeting up and bought plane tickets to go take a bunch of photos with this guy.

Fully charged scythe costs around 20m. If you wanna toss me 20m every time I feel like uncharging it to test it somewhere just lmk big baller.

Just excited is all, felt like sharing. Isnt that what reddit is for ???

Over the course of my play time, probably more than that tbh, but mahog planks/superior bones etc. got used so 2b was around what was left.

This is still my end game ironman gear.....

No but you still need the B gloves to make the bis melee gear...

Ey. Thanks &lt;3

Not using B gloves and switching to slaughter bracelets for the final hit in 2019 lmfao
---
well, I do not know anything about those gold or silver awards. I was even confused when I received the notification. I guess my clanmember just wanted to do a nice gesture. But in all seriousness, our reddit posts always did well without it, we just are recruiting this time for more European/Aussie players since we lack a lot in those timezones. Thank you for letting me know what they are, now I can sort of see why people are upset but they still should not be trolling or attacking our cc like that.

Because you is a brainlet pker

Shut the fuck up, you‚Äôre a fucking weirdo. Seen you in like 3 threads spouting nonsense.

There‚Äôs two-four  cb lvl 58-59 bots training rune crafting in almost every single world  at edge. Each of them has a runecrafting level in the 70+ range.

That‚Äôs just one spot, what I‚Äôm trying to say is Runecraft Bad.

Ive made a good amount of money from items already starting to change in price due to the blog

Pretty sure lasts as long as you had that name for but I could be wrong. I know a double name change will also make the name available

You are so f****** dense it's honestly impressive do you really think someone posting a crudely made swastika is going 2 in any way normalize the nazis

 if you knew a damn thing about psychology you would understand that this is a simple case of a teen being told not to do Something, which makes them only want to do it more the very simple solution to this is to just stop giving them attention. How you claim to be educated but cant see this blows my mind.
---
Your views are the result of when no one in your group challenges your opinion so when you are challenged, you just say the dumbest, easiest shit to defuse.
---
Good goals to work towards. I suggest you get elite void for raids and vorkath. You are welcome in my cc.
---
lol
---
Although you should have higher stats for gwd check out Noble Bros. We do mass events with our lower levels so you could still come while you train up a few more levels. Our last mass we actually had a super lucky run, two tasset drops and ended up with around a 10m split. Drop by and say Mil sent you! :)
---
&gt;Shut the fuck up, you‚Äôre a fucking weirdo.

I'm 92 combat right now. I have had b gloves since 82 combat. The fire cape is coming very soon as I will be hitting 85 range in the next couple of days. 
---
Once I have my f cape, any chance I could join the CC even though I am under 100cb? Maybe as a provisional member until I hit 100?
---
I am about to bank the bones for 77 pray and the arcane and dex scrolls. I have bursts banked for 75-85 mage, and chins to get to 90ish range. I'm currently grinding Slayer and birdhouses to get my last two skill reqs for mm2.
---
I'm not blaming jagex, I'm suggesting a few fixes to prevent it.  I mean I'm still working out how I got hacked - email wasn't accessed.  Verified that with Google.   Phone is virus free, bank pin wasn't a common number associated with me. 
---
If those two fixed got implemented though I think the amount of people hacked within the last week would have been significantly less.
---
Ah, an aussie. Yes, you are welcome. We also are accepting applications for event team (bronze stars) so the more aussie-catered events, the better. You can try applying for a position.
---
Not to be pedantic, but then the dude's not wrong. If the OP said it, then you didn't assume it
---
^(at least in the normal sense of "it's safe to assume" to mean a priori)
---
Every single one of these comments is why I HATE people who play this game you are all the most elitist fucks
---
The fact that Edd is a man, still messes with my mind to this day always thought he was a girl lol.
---
if you click on the skills it will bring up a list of what you can do at what level. For something like attack or defense, you generally want to use the highest level armor/weapon you can wield. at 20 attack/def you can use/wear mithril items, looks like you already got a scimmy which is good. Just keep using scimitars all the way up to rune (dragon if you go members) then you can start looking at other options. definitely start working on that range and magic level, range is great for safespotting enemies and magic will allow you to teleport around the map. Best advice: set goals for yourself, the first being complete all f2p quests. Use the osrs wiki for any questions you have, it will be much more helpful than the reddit at your level. They also have great quest guides.
---
You‚Äôre pathetic
---
I open doors at the fruit stall...bitch.
---
Yeah I mean I emailed them and they told me email security tips, I'm like... I confirmed with Google my email wasn't logged in from anywhere else/wasn't hacked.
---
I know footballers that piss themselves during games. I suppose most people would say shit it a bit much. Remember that your grandfather will get to a point where he is shitting himself.
---
Everyone has great lines in that one. The pirates, the lunar citizens, even that one pirate who becomes a banker at the end

If warding makes it into the game I hope that Goblins have the first quest used for it.

Hey, 111 cmb, gloves and Cape. I'd love to join! Rsn yeetd

I still can't wrap my head around this. I know OSRS is a game that demands alot of time but this is just insane, at this point it's a mental disorder os something
---
Pretty good. You can definitely join once you obtain your fire cape and your barrows gloves. You can still lurk in my cc for the time being, I only will be conducting gear and activity checks in the coming weeks.
---
haHAA
---
Maybe the bones come from the chicken as well
---
Spending thousands? Id say not, buying a few to get started maybe. Id only do it if you know the value of ingame gold and how difficult it can be to make. It can ruin the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of it if you just buy a whole shit load all at once. Tbh id never say its a good idea to spend thousands of dollars in a game on what is basically micro transactions.
---
I pay for members with actual money. Not a fan of turning the game into a chore to upkeep members with bonds but I can understand why people do
---
Dude this is millions of gp and hundreds of course he could've saved. No Ava's, not even burst spells? Probably never done a quest, so that limits his Slayer monster options a ton too.
---
D
---
Oh he's number 2 alright.
---
Ye for sure, they just see it as "buying" your post to the top, instead of it "earning" it's way due to it's popularity (based on upvotes etc etc)
---
lmao
---
i searched for the sugar cane seeds and cant find anywhere? do they currently exist in game?
---
Yeah a pro player will piss him selves for $400,000+ for that much money I would too lmao.
---
here's the thing
---
it's grammatically correct to say 'you're'- not 'your', 'you're' implies 'you are gay', which is correct, i am gay, while 'your' implies a second person possessive adjective, used to describe something that belongs to you.
---
as a straight person, 'your gay' makes no sense- gay people don't belong to you- gayness doesn't belong to you- you don't 'own' the word gay, etc.
---
furthermore
---
please consider your choice of words in the future and try to be less homophobic and bigoted- every time you use the word 'gay' as a pejorative, many, many of our LGBTQ players feel less welcome and more unsafe within our community and on this subreddit
---
now kiss
---
Welcome, friend. Ask for the discord link in game, a star rank will be happy to provide you the link.

Make sure you‚Äôre using an authenticator and a bank pin. Don‚Äôt drop or trade anything you wouldn‚Äôt want to lose. 
---
Don‚Äôt fall for phishing scams on twitch and the such. 
---
Follow slayer musics efficient quest guide if you need some direction, will set your account up nicely for the long run.
---
Most importantly have fun, don‚Äôt be afraid to take breaks from a grind if you‚Äôre getting annoyed. There‚Äôs so much content in this game and hopefully real life ;) that it‚Äôs easy to walk away and come back another time.

Why is evangelion piano edition on in the background

This is it, you may not like it but this is the peck of human performance.

Or just bring dwh lol.

No, they don't exist. That was the idea of the suggestion to add them to the game, alongside everything else
---
Then how will you get hydra?
---
I'm guessing you already did it, but as someone else pointed out, it's cheaper to go repair it yourself at a POH armor stand. You just have to go to Rimmington on w330, hop in a house with cash in hand, and repair it.

Earlier I asked how to get a D med helm for a master clue, in the end, I decided to drop it and got another master clue scroll from the elite.  Took me 2 prior master clue attempts before I could complete my first one.

1st - Needed Armadyl helm
---
2nd - Needed dragon med helm

Way back in TBC we had a raid leader that had stomach poisoning during progression. He played on a laptop and you could hear him shitting while making calls.

You can go up to clicking once every 15-20 minutes. However a majority of people click every couple minutes to keep their health low and prayer high.

If you do all of them, the cape you get is super rare with only approx. 500 around. Pretty mean street cred

I've done 99% of my Vorkath kills with a Lance/Avernic, it's quite a bit faster on a consistent basis. There's never been a kill I've attempted without bringing a BGS or Warhammer. So, in practice I can't tell you. I can just tell you that factually and statistically it's much much better.
---
Because reddit is shit and will still send you to the new design.
---
they made the shoulder parrot into a real thing
---
he had a twitter post where he screenshotted talking to the age guy and it said 800 something hours so i could believe it
---
I'll agree on no battle wards, I do like it a bit more complex though instead of having the only training option be a bank standing method
---
so really not that big of a deal from my perspective but please correct me if this would be a to big of a change.

Not sure, I don‚Äôt plan on looking into it.

I‚Äôll be joining up for sure. Got everything and well past 100. Working on western providence diary‚Äôs for elite void right now, then I can do some bossing for sure. I can also bring about 3-4 people with me as well.

That‚Äôs different though. You have a medical condition, this dude is just disgusting.

I‚Äôm just not dedicated enough

Yeah well wanted Vorki but got it way too soon.. so don‚Äôt see a point in grinding now.

Feel like grinding of the zulrah pet but I don‚Äôt even like the pet lmao

I was burnt out on tbow grind, being like 200m out. Was barely playing. Decided to finish off 99 slayer, then get quest cape, then do rc for diaries. I feel reinvigorated when it comes to RS now.
---
Big grats though. Very lucky
---
What tasks?
---
Ew is that League of Legends on your desktop? Bruh
---
I didn't claim both lol. You are mixing up the posts of 2 different people. All I said was that people don't only train using the most efficient method.

What's up with the "Being gay is cool in 2019" meme mentality? nothing wrong with gay people but if you're straight, you don't need to expose yourself to gay memes to fit in.

Good raid leaders were another species. I used to lead our guild in Rated Battlegrounds and even trying to order just 10 people was insane, couldn't imagine trying to control a 25 man ICC raid or any of the like.

Reminds me of that guy who spent like 40 days fishing anchovies

Can confirm but the numbers are slightly too low

greater demons specifically. I kill about 60 with 5 prayer pots-3 and melee. Wondering if using trident would be cheaper, 79 mage

Be careful. You'll upset the fat ehp  neckbeards who are going to cry ezscape. Love the idea personally.

Why????
---
What exactly does that mean? Sounds like he used one of those clients that show spots where you can hit an enemy and they cant hit you if theyre frozen.
---
Nah, the only mage you should use for non boss tasks is burst/barrage. It‚Äôs worth just wearing proselyte and praying melee
---
I personally prefer vorkath and do not enjoy killing zulrah, so that‚Äôs my bias.   
---
Without a DHCB, zulrah is better gp/hr, but i didn‚Äôt find vorkath to be *bad* with a blowpipe and BGS. I still killed vorkath that way while I saved up for a DHCB.  
---
So I say do whichever one you enjoy more. The bank will swell either way.

It's like when there's 9 empty urinals, and the guy comes right up to the one next to yours.

Watching someone drink milk is oddly disgusting.
---
The 2.2k total worlds don't see as many pkers as other worlds in my experience. When you're at that total level, PKing is more for fun than for profit, as you probably already have more profitable alternative activities and the players you're trying to kill are tanky as fuck or risking very little.
---
On the 2.2k worlds I'll get rushed at Black Chins maybe once an hour or so. If the PKer doesn't K0 me immediately, they tend to be respectful and leave, no TB or POH &gt; spec recharge &gt; try again or team shenanigans.
---
My main question is what would be the use? Most people train to 50 FM (which is pretty fast in my opinion) and then go wintertodt.
---
I'm not super against this or anything, but it seems like there is already a low effort way of training fire making.
---
Bank

"You have jobs?"

"Yes we do.."

"Quit them."

The worst part is they all usually get numbers at the end of the name

I think this guy got a bit unlucky, I got nearly 13m from 100 keys

That‚Äôs why I do konar every other task.

I always find 10hp pures fascinating.

It‚Äôs like having a level 3 skiller but the combat stats are trained like they‚Äôre skills.

Iron cball has a series on one if I remember correctly.

I find dearlola1 offensive &gt;:(

proselyte's prayer bonus would make it a much better option than dragon? (all  65-69 combat stats)
---
i‚Äôm not straight??
---
Being a runner makes 3.5m/4.5m/hr garunteed based on your rc lvl and experience. If youre new with under 75 rc you still can get paid 2m/hr and it isnt click intensive
---
Boy, another reason polling every single thing is dumb, what a surprise.
---
Rise and rise again until lambs become lions brother! Use gyfcat to shorten your video if you want, and post it to their Twitter.
---
One of my thoughts exactly. With less people actually using logs to train fire-making why not make it easier for the people who don't just want to jump on the Wintertodt bandwagon.

I‚Äôd rather be able to do demonic gorillas for black demons because that‚Äôs way better money than Kurasks or gargs.  Same goes with dragons.

Did he say anywhere that he was not using the safespot?
---
Gz on 99 friendship
---
Yeah fire cape should be easy with these stats and I have pretty efficient gear, just gotta dedicate an hour to doing it. I will maybe try tonight if not busy. My iron is part of an iron only cc and they are very helpful when it comes to all things iron, so I'll stay over there with him for now.
---
I can join the cc tonight after work
---
Lmao, it happens! I know we both came off as aggressive at first, but I'm glad we were able to just have a discussion by this point.
---
I think your point about friends starting out is exactly on the nose of why I feel the way I do, which sits kind of in contrast. I just wouldn't want someone to feel like what they've done up to that point is minor, even if there's just *so fucking more* more to do. But that's the beauty of this game! Honestly, it blows me away how much there is to do, and how many angles you can attack it at; kinda like the post referenced in the OP about 99 slayer.
---
Congrats on the gear, though. I've been juggling between more expensive pieces because I'm trying to hold onto my cash stack to train construction. I have more than enough to do it, but I don't want to come out of it with no money on hand. :( I'm praying for a zenyte drop to fund my first, actual "this is my gear and not gear that I'm gonna buy for this task then sell back on the GE" piece.
---
It's definitely all about perspective, but just let your feelings of "1500 ain't shit" be the driving force to remind you of how far you have actually come in this game. I sound like a damn neckbeard when I say I love this game, but I really do. Even all the flaws and dumb drama, I would have absolutely never been so content on this ride to 1500 total level as I would have playing any other game for the same period of time.

Can u give me some of that reddit luck?

Why didnt you block his name? Failure.
---
Imo: I dont exactly like the idea of Skilling bosses but I understand other people do. I like to train my skills the hard way, grinding but putting in slightly less effort than Guthix intended.
---
ave got nuffin left
---
And you can't do that until you have an account lmao
---
I was just talking about how AFK NMZ can be, most skills you have to click around every 2 minutes, so NMZ is kinda ridiculous.
---
It's one thing to do it in an argument, but the dude did it unprovoked just to try to make someone feel bad.
---
Guy must have a shitty life or hates himself or something to need that little boost of self confidence
---
I heard it‚Äôs terrible because you never hit high so training takes way way longer.
---
The edge in this hurts my soul but another F2P boss in an iconic area could be interesting
---
Time to start bursting Slayer boi
---
What... I thought I was feeling it going 80 dry.. (I'm not a pvmer, 2-3 hours was a grind for me at zulrah lol)
---
Construction OP, the earlier you dump GP into it the better
---
Or you know, someone like this would completely ignore your last statement and continue onwards and make a new account?
---
I don't think someone who sits in their shit for 2 hours and gets criticised for it and sees nothing wrong would come to your conclusion.
---
Man it's been how many decades since merch clans existed and their power is still felt in memes like this.
---
I can't tell if this is a real/wooosh or you're trying to woooosh whoever points it out to you
---
There's no reason that would be against the rules, you're just using a different mouse.  It's still 1 Action = 1 Action.
---
Honestly if you're looking for something to do while you're bored, reading through Mod Ash's twitter responses is honestly better than shit I read on reddit
---
corp feet look like licker feet from resident evil
---
I know, like i said in another comment this is for a youtube series i do so money is scarce atm, but after my current grind it'll be no problem :P
---
Why not? Magic got strong jewelry and plank make, all it's missing now is automated alching. Lol
---
Maybe it's his fetish. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Oh wow. How immature. CP is Corrupted Pures.
---
WITNESS ME!
---
Fuck this guy and his name
---
I did but I wasn't sure. Gotta remember what subreddit we're on
---
AFK is great and all but when I sit down at home to play I do really like to gain  xp from doing more interactive stuff! Will give it a try for sure!
---
Isn't this what someone would say who was guilty too? Lol
---
They're reused, which is better than recycling; they're used as loot in the fishing trawler
---
double deaths
---
I think this would kill the liquidity of the GE though because no one would be incentivized to provide items past their limits because once the tax kicks in the profit is gone/reduced on a lot of items. Which means prices would vary much more widely if more than a few people choose to train say herblore at once and end up killing the sell side of an item.
---
What would make more sense is a maker/taker fee like in real markets in which those who want the convenience of insta buy/sell pay a fee while those who have offers on both sides do not, so that people are still incentivized to have items on offer and make the GE liquid enough to use but also makes it more difficult and expensive to manipulate the price of an item.
---
Wtf, have never seen anyone play that game in aaaages!
---
I think everyone would like the idea of being able to make and purchase cheap purple sweets but it just would crash so many items lol the only stackable food being able to be made by players. It would probably devalue other items such as guthans and sgs because you can carry as many sweets in your inventory as you‚Äôd like to recover your hp. The only way this could possibly be viable is that sweet making was locked behind a quest (with high req) and had really high requirements to create like 85+ farming for the sugar and 99 cooking to create (don‚Äôt see that as to high since this is the only stackable food in game) and not to mention of it wasn‚Äôt behind such high requirements it would be botted into oblivion
---
Holy shit what a waste of ToG.
---
I got 99 atk first in rs2, hated 99 strength "meta", thought it'd be neat to have 99 def with realistically low atk/str.
---
Looking back it was a gigantic waste of time but hey I got to be top 10 defence for quite a while. Sooo many people making pures
---
I'd suggest simply saying "fill" and join whatever team you can get into, I was around 80 cmb and people still took me without an issue.  I personally learned the roles as I played (wiki guide open on the side, figuring out how to maximize points during down times).  
---
As long as you call as soon as the horn-call changes, 95% of people won't care if you don't have experience.  Yeah, people meme that ba sucks, but really it takes less than 2 hours if you're able to do the roles.  I had maybe four deserters on my grind, but it's whatever since you only need one queen kill and get points on the way every wave.
---
welcome friend :)
---
Nice luck on the 1st one

I mean you aren't really a grown man if you haven't shat yourself at least once but obviously not on purpose...

Ye probably but he would just be a massive cunt and no one really likes a cunt.

Well, you know what i mean
---
Damn dude, I feel for you. That‚Äôs why I always bank everything before I log out to be extra safe. Seems like everything is a lose/lose situation with account security these days.

At least we have a border that has kept our entire country from become one big shithole. /s (kinda)

---
It's also been a popular way for people to cash out stolen credit cards since you can sell the GP for bitcoin from gold sites.
---
It was in a bank, some how he also got my pin and empty out my bank. Also strange is I change my password just a few days ago.
---
Clarification\*
---
He camped me several times and world-hopped to interupt my task but everytime i xlogged with farseer/flowers, Why do people want to steal success off others?
---
You can import your local settings after making an account

This is such a cute gif
---
Sorry bro, i may have gone over the EXACT amount of points to imbue my rings.
---
10-15 years maximum. The game is reaching end of life in the next 2-3 years. They can not add much more pvm content without the game collapsing on itself.
---
The 10-15 years figure assumes that Jagex doesn't immediately go under once they reach "EOL" of OSRS and close the servers of all their games. Assuming they can stay floating after this event then it may stay up.
---
Personally I've never had a shit I haven't been able to hold in. Now I've had sharts that have pranked my ass. Has anyone else really never been able to hold in a shit?
---
I like the idea of alloying metals, but I'd argue for a total rework of Smithing to introduce them.  If we were to shunt manufacture of Runite back to, say, 60 Smithing, but still have Runite and Adamantite as the top two ore types, it would serve to stabilize the economical impact on those ores.
---
Check out J1m's by release
---
If your pin didn't do anything you most likely have a RAT on your pc, did you download any shady rs-related files like jad simulator or something like that? Did you happen to change your password because you fell for a twitch phishing stream? I feel for your loss but your account isn't ruined, you can still rebuild.
---
That sounds suspiciously like something a person who shit their pants would say
---
He didn't realize his extended antifire ran out. :(
---
Gl on the task man! I was hoping for pet but I‚Äôll take a smooth 35m drop. It was a lengthy process I slowly did over the span of a couple weeks but was fun to complete!

I got 99 slayer and ranged without ever using a canon. Small challenge, but it made it more fun imo.
---
Why would kids sell their stuff when they have less free time?

If everything were ideal, you could use the web browser to play OSRS. But, using the controller as a mouse would be a mega pain in the ass.

That sounds like something a pants shitter would say

Its unhealthy physically and mentally to go to uni. Liberal environment with liberal teachers it leads to mental illness. Far more than playing a video game like fortnite would lol

/r/gaymers would love this!

The fact that he can afford a dragon full helm and is still doing this. I love it.
---
&gt;mildly chuckle worthy

That's all it takes.  I'm talking about the people who are going to report the name "fartinpussy". As if they're offended by it.

---
Let me get this shit straight.  
---
You want developers to handle every case of suspected macro on a case by case basis for the off chance the player is disabled and is using an accessibility device?
---
Disabled players already have their own gamemode, ultimate iron man.
---
So there‚Äôs actually someone flipping pots/buckets/spades and other easy to find stuff?
---
This is why OSRS mobile exists. To NOT shit your pants.
---
People like you make it way too easy for trolls
---
Im glad i never had that problem
---
It boggles the mind that some people spend 100 nuggets on upper level access without even knowing what it's for or how it works. I can't even imagine being in the brain of someone like that. What are they thinking?
---
Thats the attitude :)
---
Barrows expansion!
---
Also please don't argue politics it's just a joke about being against buffing things we already had to suffer through lol
---
he's literally been talking about it on his twitter all day.   
---
Said something about preferring 16-19 year old girls or similar.
---
He's so deep into rs and the whole eph thingy that he thinks it's cool that he shit himself (and sat in it for 2 hours) just for the sake of some exp.
---
It‚Äôs a mouse designed for quadriplegics, it‚Äôs basically a small headset with a straw-type thing that goes in your mouth, and it operates through air pressure by sending signals when you suck on it or blow into it
---
11.3m in a day? Wew
---
About 30 hours of Vorkath in max gear. With 2m worth of gear I'm not sure you can.
---
Makes sense, I don't think it's mentally healthy to compare video game achievements to real life ones though. Perhaps an exception to this is if someone makes a living off of playing the game, but are still living a fairly healthy lifestyle.
---
im 80 solo raids dry

OBVIOUSLY.  No sympathy.

Tbf it was changed last year or something, so people may just not know, but I've spent far too much energy explaining it to people ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Reporting TOS/rule violations are only for people who are offended, huh. TiL...
---
But I'd imagine items that are BiS like bandos have a "virtually infinite" demand in that every single player wants /needs it so as long as supply is less than total players it'll remain above alch price, I wonder if more legit accounts are created per day or more bcps dropped
---
Someone or some-bot, yeah
---
Doubt it lol
---
Pretty sure the quest tells you this...
---
Probably thinking that it‚Äôs closer to where they have to drop off their ore.
---
imagine shitting yourself for 5 minutes of exp gains
---
That‚Äôs more understandable, but not any better really. A pointless contest isn‚Äôt worth shitting yourself over.

Why else report a name?

It‚Äôs from the Cosmic plane, a realm you access via Fairy Rings

By far my favorite place in RS besides the size

I got the fire cape and inferno equivalents in rs3 and it still took me 3 tries to kill jad in osrs.

Try holding a shit for 24 hours of smithing grinding and see what happens

---
You can act however you want lol. But having a a username like this will make you look like a kid in my eyes
---
I don't think hitting on sexually mature girls is pedo material. Illegal but not pedophilia. Being attracted to prepubescent kids is pedo.
---
So here's the issue with buying bonds, and the fact that you can purchase GP with real life money in general.
---
If someone truly understands the value of money, they understand that time is money. Therefore, their time has value.
---
Let's say you're capable of making 1m/hr in game (which is generous for most accounts). That 1m could be purchased via bonds (or otherwise) for roughly &lt;=$1. This means your time grinding for GP (which may require you to do something you don't necessarily enjoy) is worth $1/hr.
---
Let's say you're capable of making $40/hr in real life (also quite generous, but not unrealistic). That $40 could purchase you &gt;=40m GP for 1 hour of effort.   
---
So, the well-to-do logician would purchase the GP with his $40 and spend the remaining 39 hours doing something enjoyable in the game. 
---
However, Billy appears to be a child, so this financial decision may not have been in his best interest.
---
Oh im thinking maple. My bad. Fair enough. Make it maple then we good.

Presumably he didn't have to shit as soon as he started though.
---
Dude probably got it just for taverly dungeon shortcut lol
---
Are you trying to use your username or your email? And if using email are you using the first ever email you used for the account?
---
You do get very slightly less ores by mining veins other people at mining this is because of someone else depleted the ore then they get the last ore while you just swong at that rock for a few ticks and got nothing. Still slightly more efficient to find your own rocks
---
He also messed up the fight caves a big
---
You say that until you‚Äôre the false positive.
---
Why are you so aggressive? I was just speculating that If more accounts are created then bis drops the prices will be above alch, I stated this was a guess multiple times
---
Never raided before. What does ‚Äúscouted‚Äù mean.
---
Do yall still clan?
---
yea ring of suffering loaded up with some rings of recoils
---
Moving to duracell helped a lot too. I thought konar was good money cause id get a 200k drop from the brinstone chest every once in a while, but thats nothing compared to a kurasks &gt; shamans &gt; dust devils chain
---
That will still effect the price of tradable version. I mean it‚Äôs a slippery slope, this idea isn‚Äôt impossible but making it work without completely devaluing the treasure trails sweets and making the skillable version viable method would be challenging.
---
This is a false dichotomy if I have ever seen one lol.
---
i believe they're just a skip when you're doing efficient slayer.
---
The random letters and numbers is what happens when you have an inappropriate name and it gets flagged
---
Osrs wiki?
---
Only from highlighting them, it won't make them disappear from the ground i.e. you'll still see a dragon longsword on the ground, but it won't be tagged as a dragon longsword
---
That's fine- ultimately just trying to have people but while it's cheap
---
Scouted means that the person already has a raid found that has a decent rotation, so you just have to go to that CC's world that they scouted it in.
---
I don't pick up the unnoted dhides, it's not worth it. Invent is diamoned dragon bolt (e)s, ranging pot, super extended antifire, super antivenom, 3 prayer pots, con cape, rune pouch, and the rest mantas.
---
using alts to abuse buy limits isnt against the rules
---
buy limits are just shit idk why they even keep em around
---
Wow, he wasn't even close.
---
Runecrafting *
---
this is taking the stinky chair to a whole new dimension.
---
someone still gets the last ore and if ur afking u come back and the next vein u were gonna go to is gone. please dont stand on someone if there are a hundred other worlds and so many veins pls
---
The other guy already said to post it here
---
this is the biggest thing for your stats/gear: if your BGS spec hits under 50-60 total for two specs, tele out and try again. If I don't get enough of a spec it takes 4-5 minutes to kill. after hitting a 60, i get 2-3 minute kills easy even with a bp, normal void, and addy darts.
---
I'm sort of worried this might happen to me with my high alch method. 
---
I line up my noted bows to where I can click on them and the alch button without moving my mouse. Then I just pick up my wireless mouse and sit in front of my TV clicking away high alching from a different room. I'm worried the lack of mouse movement will trigger jagex's detection system or something.
---
I have 250k mind runes from barrows.
---
Wraths
---
Holy fucking gild someone shit this comment
---
But only if you know they just started mining that vein. Otherwise you should still pick a fresh one.
---
I don't know about you guys, but I do this mostly afk and don't keep track of which vein has been mined for 1 or 15 seconds. I'm just going to move to a fresh vein to maximize afkness
---
Yes. 
---
I don't have twitter, so I don't know how I would go about messaging him on twitter. :(
---
You original post was about how people with shitty personalities can‚Äôt take a joke so pretend to be offended so they can report names.
---
Even if that‚Äôs not what you said It‚Äôs deleted now, so it‚Äôs not like it was a much better point than that, otherwise you would‚Äôve stuck to it and not nuked it in downvote defeat.
---
You can just stop here if you want. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve impressed nor impressed your view on anyone.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt you say as much /u/wursh_bucket , OP to this thread that decided to delete the post like a little lukewarm Luddite?
---
You're an ironman so they only count for 1/1000th of a point each
---
How is that possible?
---
It's not really a false flag. Any person with a disability can choose to not click 15 times per second, its not like its 15 or none. If you're clearly using tools like this to give yourself an advantage, they are going to ban you, and they've already told people they would, this shouldn't be some kind of big shock.
---
alch pic when?
---
Hi can you sell these as movie posters on etsy, my walls need one thanks
---
It will still make a difference. Every bit of time saved adds up, the only downside being the maintenance cost you have to pay the blast furnace operators and the fee if you are less than 60 smithing. But time is money, time you save training efficiently let's you free up time to do other activities.
---
Bots can never be stopped sadly. If theyre banned quickly botmakers can easily know whats triggering the detection. They have to do slow bans to avoid that. They insta nuked bots in rs3, and now bots in rs3 are superpowerful and undetectable
---
Probably hacked

I‚Äôll be your gf. I‚Äôm not cheap tho. That‚Äôll be TEN THOUSAND gold pieces please!

This reminds me of adventure quest
---
Wait this is true lol
---
Ouch dude... I was at 575 dry and thought my luck was terrible
---
Except for all the times that there are no rocks to mine because people are all on individual rocks
---
Ez for tubby!
---
Another version of this is using a controller. You can even play another game on your PC using controller while having all the buttons bound to left click, spamming in RS. Easy gains
---
Take a look at [our optimal quest guide](https://osrs.wiki/Optimal_quest_guide) and our [Barrows strategy guide](https://osrs.wiki/Barrows/Strategies), and if you have any further questions let me know. :)

Whenever someone says that all publicity is good publicity I think of Chris-chan and Amy's baking company

His account was probably hacked why else would he be in that gear, scumbag.
---
If I have 70 strength and use a potion that brings me to 80 strength for example for that time being is damage and everything else (i.e. increase max hit) EXACTLY the same as if I had 80 strength as a base stat?

If so does it work for other combat skills?

real talk man the spamming on screen and the pacing of this video both make it really hard to watch.

he could have just logged in on his phone in a few seconds with his thumbprint while he dumped ffs ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò©

Couldn‚Äôt find one instance of what you‚Äôre talking about. Refers to himself as ‚ÄúI‚Äù ask most exclusively, uses me and mine sometimes.
---
sorry to hear that, what do you mean by spamming on the screen?
---
It just so happens that often i mine the same ore as other people but because they have mined it before me, i swing my pickaxe at that rock for a few ticks and the mine is depleted already i get nothing. 
---
As much as i want to mine the same ore as everyone else, its just better to mine individual veins, especailly when i dont have a problem finding a world where everyone can just mine their own veins.
---
turtles????
---
I don't think he would, I trade hundreds of mills between my alts daily and never had an issue
---
I called it soccer anyways because he said you score goals, like soccer. Not because it‚Äôs similar to soccer.
---
Hahaha honestly tho, if you were a kid these days I don‚Äôt see how you‚Äôd find fun in RS. They really like that instant gratification for sure. Just the difference in games now is so huge lol
---
never-mind, I misinterpreted your comment. When you said 99 wasn't required, I thought you were implying there's no point in getting 99 after 95...

Words change meanings and gay used to mean many other things before it meant homosexual.
---
Why should the LGBTQ community get to hold language hostage when it's not even being used to talk about homosexuality? It's like if white people suddenly got in a fit about the word cracker and demanded all crackers to now be called dried flour wafers or whatever else.
---
Of course nobody would take that seriously because "white privilege", but when a minority does it it's totally fine and we should be more sympathetic to accidentally hurting their feelings when we're not even talking about them at all.
---
Unpopular opinion I guess.

What's he gonna do? Trade him for them?

Not if the time spent not progging keeps you in a better mental state allowing you to prog farther in your shorter amount of time.

Was actually pretty good. Wonder how other songs would sound.

because skillers are the new brainlets

I still report them on mobile but it does make it more relaxing. I'll take it off if I get pmod so I can actually fight them back. The report system is simply too slow for these suicide bots

Yeah probably lol. I dont really remember this month went by too fast!
---
Assuming you have MouseKeys activated in Windows, simply hitting the 5 Key on the Numpad will register a left click. I would have a cheap USB keyboard leading under my desk. It would be connected to a laptop at my side while I used my computer in front of me. All I did was mash the block that I glued to it using my big toe.
---
You could do it without the block. Block just made it easy so I wasnt blindly searching for the key.
---
So like I said before he‚Äôs including the viewer in the video.

Tree house! Varrock castle! GE!

Could you tell me where you got lost when I said legality doesn‚Äôt define what is right or not? I don‚Äôt need a law to tell me not to fuck 16 year olds, because I‚Äôm not a pedobear. 
---
Also, I have exactly 0 opinions that need to be qualified with ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not a pedophile‚Äô ‚Äî you should get to 0 as well
---
No, this post is stupid. If you jump on another player's vein, you have no clue how long before it depletes. Picking a newly spawned vein will be more afk because you know it hasn't been mined yet.
---
At least use the poop sock
---
Logging out and back in fixed it. Was a bit nervous for a bit there

You can buy 30 a day for no loss in gp. If setting records then buy like 120. Which is 240k xp which would take long.

Treat smithing like farming and 90 to 99 smithing is good profit.

I always wanted another monitor but don't have any space for it. My desk was custom built in like 2005, so the space for the monitor is like 19 inches wide and it's walled in on both sides (with a cabinet taking up the other half of the desk, with the modem/router beneath it). We just haven't bothered replacing the desk I guess, would be a pain to fit a new one in the same spot.

19 inches is 48.26 cm

more larger bosses should have that mechanic. it just makes sense.

With mobile existing I'll never get this attitude. Like I don't get it to begin with but autism is a special kinda thing.

Just pick up a phone, lose 2 seconds to log onto it, continue smithing at EHP rates while pooping, showering, preparing food, heck even up until you pass out from exhaustion and sleep.

Mobile helped these kinda idiots out and here they are sitting at a desk in their own shit smh
