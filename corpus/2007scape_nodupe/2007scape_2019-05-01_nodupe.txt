If reddit can't do it nerf it to the ground, if reddit can do it don't you dare touch it. That's why everyone cheered for the zulrah nerf and everyone raged at the konar drop table nerf.

Go for 500 total and telegrab the wines upstairs.
---
Let me guess, you're one of those "PVP is the most skilled content in the game" kids with one failed attempt at inferno?
---
The players that are opposed to prayer flicking are those that aren't good at it - simple
---
Blow pipe is good. Also craw bow  in the wilderness at chaise druids is like 85k xp per hour
---
That takes 75 range? I'm 70
---
If you wear the red monk robes top and bottom you can telegrab just the upper level wines but you need 500 total.

Binge watch netflix shows, Afk while playing league.
---
Those two mostly do the trick for me.
---
Planted over 1k ranarr seeds never got 18.
---
damn they're down to 6m now... I know when I got mine way back when, it was 18m
---
My bad, you're right.
---
Best if unlimited budget would probably be to chin to 75 for blowpipe then.
---
Makes sense. I'm gonna grind out assembler than go back to gorillas, then.
---
Thanks for the informed response!
---
Do the quest lmao
---
As a beginner I think you should casually watch some twitch streams (beware of phishing streams; ie, don’t enter ur osrs password on anything other the official osrs website). You’ll learn all kinds of different small things from the way they play.
---
The redesign only exists to show you more ads

Did you get it?
---
i mean yeah both questions are dumb tbh, his response just didn't make sense to me at the time, I had also just woken up
---
Fuck I had a good one last week. I saw the white dragonfire, clicked to spellbook, lagged for a split second. I got blown up by an invisible crab just because the hiccup was the exact moment the crab would have spawned.
---
I can get behind this just a place to store things used to get your favor up, it would be good

I’m holding onto my stockpile for the time being.

Oh no my 2 interests have intersected in this post.
---
Wondering if you tried a logout? I just did this quest on Saturday. It was in the crate immediately after climbing down the ladder.
---
imagine being on your death bed that young and thinking about how you spent a not insignificant amount of your life grinding agility
---
you play league and rs at the same time lol
---
It was in varrock too originally.
---
Also, in terms of mechanics and general design of the game (game tick design) I don't think there is really anything they can do to change this. 
---

---
Maybe unless they charge you 1 prayer point to turn a prayer on...
---
Got it
---
Gone
---
I agree with a lot of this. Warding appears to be designed with the right intentions, but is far too ambitious in its scope. 
---
On the terminology of warding, I don't think it's too off base. Although there's no dictionary definition of warding, it's a actually common term in the fantasy genre. In D&amp;D, a ward is a defensive spell that can be used for protection via invisible magic barrier. In the context of armor, I guess it could make sense. Whether or not it fits in the game world of OSRS is another question. However, there's other games that use this term, so I think your critique of it being a bizarre term is a bit misplaced.
---
is that the mighty cow1337killr?

I'm not hating on it. I made a sarcastic observation. Play what you want, who gives a shit?

What about other 19 skills?

There's another level to this. Making your toilet your gaming chair, complete with proper plumming.

honestly, i followed the level progression with what was best tier, buying the next best tier (bronze, iron, black, steel, mithril, adamant, rune and then dragon) and it seems to work out fine for me, and i’m sure many others.

if you’ve got any questions feel free to pm me anytime :)

I see gentle tractor. I realise I have to spend 20 minutes reading their thoughts

I know a dude who lost his hc status to falling at seers agility course, so I think kind of people able to die to random event find another way to die anyway.
---
Anguish first. ACB. Then Boots.
---
The only time I 1tick flick is DKS, and inferno. Other than that I just camp it.
---
did they post anywhere about this? is it already done or is it gonna be in next update.. or what?

is this another one of those 'posted on reddit with a sticky for 24 hours and thats it' ?

Pray flicking is preventing you from getting fire cape?
---
It's easier at low levels because the health you lose is based off your max HP, so you can take more hits with lower health because food always heals the same.
---
With 80 thieving it takes 30 minutes tops, took about 20 minutes for me on my iron.
---
range to 2h
---
lol i get like 8k points a raid at 14kc :p this shit is hard
---
At your level, probably. I would get a black mask ASAP. However, to get the additional +15% bonus to range and mage for your mask/helm, you need to do NMZ and imbue. Getting the 1.25m points in NMZ is obviously a lot faster and more efficient with a high melee level.
---
1k KC 3 Peggs , 2 eternals no pet or prims
---
Agreed, a right click option on every plant would be annoying
---
So glad this grind is over for myself
---
Fight me
---
Yeah because they'd nerf a highly skilled PvM mechanic that the most prestigious cape is locked behind, right? The only people who cry about this are pussies who can't L2flick themselves.
---

Reminds me of that youtuber who died to a gate in DMMT.

guardians surely needs to be made worth doing, but the guardians fight itself is pretty fun to play. Sire on the other hand is annoying as all hell.

No.

I DEMAND IT. JAGEX GET TO WORK.

You did pay for a game that's free, what you're saying is like when a person pays for a Kickstarter and its going to be released as f2p but you still paid and feel like you still can pull the card of "I paid for this, fix it how I want." Don't got a hatred for this sub, just have a hatred for people bashing devs because they don't change everything to your very need and only fix your problems. The bots don't bother me at all. It's basically just another person spamming some useless crap and gulible people giving money to them. Just like I never said that's an excuse, that could just be a reason they are delaying it to find a permanent solution to the problem. They have some much stuff to fix, a few bots that do that is the least of their worries.
---
Just do low combat slayer, I've found it kinda fun at 60s range/mage and 40s melee.
---
Sure it's shit xp, but if it's fun for you then it's ok
---
What is your motivation behind this post? Is this based on a bad PvP experience?
---
Fine. You can black chin in MM2 caves, or you can use a rune cbow+broad bolts. However, black chins will give you far more exp/h, while costing far more currency.
---
Normal hellhounds on the other hand drop hard clues and nothing but hard clues. Kinda weird exception considering cerb has 3 pairs of BIS boot upgrades and other drops as well.
---
how did you do it?
---
its tedious because youre bad at it
---
This suggestion would never happen lol
---
That one is elite level at least, but you also need to kill gargoyles for addy boots for a medium clue.
---
There's also the one that requires dragon boots.
---
Attas doesn't affect herbs I'm pretty sure
---
Farming level affects yield a little, but prices are fluid.
---
Ty. I have 90 mining on my main and no Rock Golem Pet. Why do you hate him?
---
Bw@ner*
---
let's talk about intentions since everyone is talking about how player flicking wasn't intended. OSRS wans't supposed to get updates, the ge shouldnt exist, afking used to be against the rules back in the day yet all these trash players complaining only train mining in mlm, fm in wintertodt, combat at nmz/crabs. It's like people are asking for rs3 ffs, do you guys even enjoy playing the game???
---
[removed]
---
Made around 9m profit, my bank was like 200k cash before I started cooking, I could've made like 12-15m if I did karambwans the whole way though
---
Lol I know I’ll be in nmz forever. I think if you turn on game mode it increases logout timer
---
Pretty sure Remote Desktop is better for nmz because the actual app will log you after 1 min of not being in the app.
---
&gt;Can’t? Or haven’t tried to learn yet? Anyone can do it.
---
Not if you have bad or even just average internet.
---
Tediousness doesn’t indicate difficulty ya spastic
---
Ya you're both right. Weird to someone who doesn't know what the are.
---
Justice.
---
Why? You are rewarded for paying attention and actually putting in some effort by accurately double clicking 100 times every minute. 
---
Why should that person willing to out in the effort not reap the rewards compared to someone who just tags all the bloodvelds and prays melee and walks away from their computer(me)?  
---
You're proposal is to punish putting in effort into pvm at this point
---
*upvotes*
---
put a alter in there or something. But infinite prayer gotta go.
---
Yeah but on mobile I imagine it's harder to find a clear line
---
1750 total level from farming, herblore, construction, thieving, crafting... Those stats help a lot with raids also if you're not a pure get 99 def. :)
---
What I don't understand is why something is bad if it was not intended. Emergent strategies and properties are some of the coolest things in the world. Bank sale worlds for example. Do you think that when RS was made that the intent for trading items was going to be done just like in certain areas by spamming? No way. No one intended for the herbs to be sold just west of the varrock west bank. It just *happened*.
---
No one intended for a player to be able to kill a limitless amount of monsters in one sitting. But it just happened. What you do from this point is important. How do you deal with it. Do you go the route of the recent ZMI runner débâcle and remove the ability? Or do you go the way of the G.E.? Do you remove prayer flicking? Or do you make new content difficult enough that you simply cannot flick perfectly for everything?
---
Unintended things sometimes **make** a game good. Super Smash Brothers Melee is a prime example. Its good at the highest levels because of an unintended method of movement (see wavedashing).
---
And to a lesser extent I think prayer flicking is similar for OSRS. It's a skill anyone can learn and utilize, but nowadays most content factors it in. If you are good or bad at it then you can still do just fine. (Minus things like the inferno...)
---
Meanwhile I seem to get one every 5th clue..
---
My two obsessions in one.
---
Imagine getting the axe instead
---
How many prayer potions do you have in your bank?
---
Get you agility higher so your run regens quicker :)
---
Obviously in paper writing.
---
Ahh. Hopefully its just the few clips ive seen or he was upset or something and isnt always like that. 
---
And for sure - again my apologies for the long ass reply. At first i wasnt going to ask anything and my brain sort of just rambled on and on and then in the midst of writing I thought "oh hey id like to know this" haha so I would definitely make a more formal &amp; formatted post if my questions were of dire need :). Thanks again!
---
How would they benefit, like at all? Obby maul is 4.2 speed, Rune Warhammer is 3.6 speed, yet assuming 1 defence the obby maul's max hit is a 49, and the rune warhammer max is 33 (incl torture ammy), so yes, it will be 100% dead content.
---
&gt;totaly
---
WON'T
---
Oof
---
Would only be used in f2p pvp, where the meta is Range to KO weapon, and 1 attack accounts can barely train any range before becoming range based. So yeah, please think or at least have some knowledge about the mechanics of this game before commenting.
---
Thank you everybody for the tips.  I think I’m going to shoot for getting a scimitar and then going out on my own, without guides for awhile.   Appreciate the help and looking forward to this journey.  I need a good world to get lost in
---
I mean yeah I’m not saying we should add this exact content , but some of it sounds nice. The desert area needs some love anyway.
---
Bro do you mind if I steal this for my epic gaming humor webcomic? I fucking start shitting my pants and can't stop shaking sometimes for hours on end after any incident in which I realize that videogames sometimes operate in an illogical manner compared to real life. I'm not a very good artist, but I keep the comic going as a tribute to my wife's boyfriend, who died in Iraq (not in combat, he killed himself.) I remember every single day after work, I'd come home from work to find him dripping with personal and extraneous fluids from plowing my wife and daughter, and as I poured him a nice cold glass of water, he'd always tell me about how fucking funny it was that Mario eats mushrooms to power up. Like lmfao, he'd be tripping balls. Goddamn, man. Lmfao. Epic. Hell yeah.
---
   rm customer_support.sh
---
People flick between protection prayers and soul split, that has its uses. But yeah, even though we have new prayers with heavy prayer drain it doesn't matter because of prayer renewals, flasks, and most bosses it is better to bank every kill rather than camp at the area. Which I'm fine with, I personally think prayer flicking is a pain in the ass.
---
My favorite part about the suggestion is the distinct lack of quests added. Quest are so boooring give me more bosses and more bosses and more bosses and more bosses and more bosses and more bosses
---
It should have been nerfed ages ago. Near unlimited prayer is not an intended game mechanic
---
You heard him. Bring back mobilising armies.
---
I'm all down for desert content that doesn't completely wipe out all the actual content we have there
---
You should check out the dragon armor skirt set it’s like 30m less then the regular dragon armor set good luck buying a set tho
---
...yes, I play on most weekends...
---
There are a few niche situations where you'll want a crossbow instead of the blowpipe, tho there are better options than the DCB (DHCB / ACB). In terms of being BiS, no the DCB is never that. The main thing you have to consider is if bolt special effects would be highly beneficial or if you really need the extra range.

My dude they used to release skills, updates, changes, a whole list of crazy shit, without even mentioning it or discussing it.
---
They could fix prayer flicking today and the overwhelming majority of players would be none the wiser. It would be all the hardcore people who dedicate an unhealthy amount of time to the game that would throw a screaming fit.
---
The other 99% of the player base would be just fine.
---
It was removed when they released preserve.
---
Prayer flick too hard. Consume pots
---
Hey it's still good though, grats on getting that super rare drop!
---
Let’s not forget we walk into a random smith’s workplace and start using their anvil without permission.
---
As far as I know, that still makes it an RPG
---
And I can appreciate that. In my mind, your Runecraft-Warding pitch makes sense in my mind if we **replace Runes as a cost component for magic armours with Rune/Pure Essence**. 
---
That way, your core decision when training Runecrafting becomes "Do I want to turn this rune essence into Runes which I can use to train Magic with/sell" or "Do I want to sacrifice the Runecrafting xp &amp; runes and instead merge my rune essence into these fabrics to create magic armours which I can then use/sell". 
---
If they offered this in a poll as a Runecraft expansion, I'd vote yes.
---
Need the key for heroes quest can anyone help me?! 
---
IGN: Mahir1
---
Yes i know. I've read this before while I was researching why I had such a low yield. The only thing people are saying is that it's because of the anima plant. I am sure I ultracompost them too.
---
prayer flicking is literally 90% of the gameplay in combat
---
I mean, 3 ticking wasn't intended either and has pretty much the exact same case to be removed
---
Takes like 30 minutes to learn it
---
Exodia.. obliterate!!
---
I see a lot of people saying things like "you can just put these in other skills" but the reason I'd vote yes to warding instead of just putting these things elsewhere is that these skills are bloated as is. Crafting already makes so many things, magic already has so many purposes (combat included), etc. Runecrafting I could see maybe, but that opens up the whole ordeal of if Runecraft gets a buff then people will get pissy about skill integrity. I want warding (combat wards aside) because it keeps other skills from being too much.
---
Wait what.. there's a deposit box on the dock now??
---
But, *mmo*
---
Hell yeah about time for a zaros boss
---
Very nice!
---
One of them is 12 gp/exp.  The other is not.
---
yes, it is an mmo, but it still falls under the category of RPG and my opinion is that it is the best of all of the games that are encompassed by the RPG categories
---
You trust jagex to rebalance a lot of their content and not totally fuck it up? Keep dreaming bud.
---
A reminder that several clans would actively crash worlds and force people to pay for their services, but I guess it's ok because it isn't RoT doing the extortion now is it?
---
Make prayers drain 1 point when first activated. Simple fix.
---
&gt; I just know how to play the game.
---
Then you should be fine with bringing supplies when praying.
---
For a non-ticking example, blast mine v motherlode mine. My point isn't unintended mechanics but the effort vs reward that's inherently part of the game. Being able to tick manipulate is very attention-heavy and requires learning game mechanics. It's not for everyone, but it's a nice alternative to afkscape.
---
um once you know how to do it itis, you dont even have to think about it, it becomes muscle memory.

really, thats interesting.  I mean im not trying to take anything away from his achievement, was more wondering on how he achieved it in general.
---
Grotesque Guardians are currently not worth doing for anyone except ironmen. 
---
The money per hour on this boss is stupidly low and even doing regular Gargoyles makes you more money per hour. It shouldn’t be like that at all. This boss definetly needs some fixing or else I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be dead content real soon.
---
&gt; What is the best way of prioritising money spending?
---
Put your money towards whatever you're doing right now (search up a guide for buy priorities for that specific activity) and focus on just that.
---
Even if the inferno didn't exist, the pray flick trick should still be removed.
---
Finally got fire cape yesterday on my 4th attempt now I bank stand.
---
Yes, but... ***__MMO__***
---
Oh rip :(
---
clicking 12k times per hour = saving you 500k an hour.
---
prayer doesnt make you invincible for pvm, pretty much any non trivial pvm hits thru protection prayers.
---
basically, people are happy enough with tick manipulation existing. 
---
the other issue is that just because 1ticking exists, even if 1ticking was removed you could still "lazy flick" your prayers which effectively do the exact same thing.
---
Where does the bowl come from when making potions?
---
Yeah but it still is hours behind a screen afk or not

Your attempt at trolling is beyond special
---

---
Who are these people?
---
These are the lamest excuses I’ve ever seen lmao.
---
having to 1 tick prayer just to have enough to do infernal... unless you stand there waiting all day for sgs specs.
---
it's just trivial arbitrary nerfing cause they don't like it, prayer flicking has entire bosses and shit made around it now
---
it's always interesting to me when developers kind of embrace an unintended thing kind of like how Halo 3 used to feature maps in the "user created maps" showcase where people would use bugs and glitches to make things float (you couldn't do this with intended mechanics until they added it in Reach) as well as get outside the intended play area etc
---
&gt;Who the fuck shit in your cereal? 
---
Ok lol
---
But his point is you didn't need to add a new skill for slayer. Just add a few slayer masters around the world and they give you points for killing monsters that can be traded in for items/perks. Monsters you can only kill if you have the "x" level (be it attack or whatever) or have done enough tasks for that master.
---
A lot of the main posts points are very opinionated so it's fine to disagree. For example the fact that making magical gear keeps getting put into random skills, while he believes implies that warding doesn't need to exist, I can argue it implies that it DOES need to exist because if there was a centralized skill for it you'd never have salad robes in crafting, boots in runecrafting, wyvern shield with smithing, etc. The only reason those are split so awkwardly is because there is no centralizing skill for magic items.
---
Same deal with complaining about the method of training. Deciding on whether a training method is good or bad is opinionated. I'm fine with wardings method of training so long as the xp rates aren't abysmal and it feels like there is actual xp progression, as my major gripe with skills like rc/agility is that the rates and xp rate progression don't match up with the effort of running them. As well complaining about the name and "identity" of the skill is silly. Got a problem with the name warding? Call the skill imbuing and call it a day. You imbue clothes, you imbue runes, etc. It's silly to say no to a skill over semantics like that, especially when it can be solved in 2 seconds.

Wowee that was fast. Follow up, Is augury worth the price? It's a consumeable so I can never get my money back.
---
How is the elf armor going to change it? Isn't Justicar still better than the new crystal armor?
---
only place i use augury is at cox, and even then its seldom
---
You mean rigour? But I’d honestly say use DHCB to earn the 60m for rigour.
---
Can you meet in game right now?
---
Struggle is real
---
I hope they don't ever remove flicking since it's like 50% of the skill in PvM. Only thing you actually have to flick for is inferno, so if you don't like it, don't do it! I think people are also making the mistake of saying this game is balanced around flicking, when really it's just balanced around the protection prayers as a whole. Flicking helps, but literally only Inferno requires it.
---
I really enjoyed your **Strategic Bolding** and use of **Different Colors**. Very **salient points** there as well. There's nothing about **Warding** that can't be easily put into **Other Skills**.
---
Shocked at such an ignorant comment, but not butthurt. Don't even know op. Why even make a comment like that?
---
Are we just going to ignore the 31 minutes played in 4100 days.... waaaay more impressive than anything Alkan's done
---
Coming back from a break since about the end of last summer, been keeping up with new features a bit but could I get an up to date list of daily/hourly activities? what should I be doing in the farming guild in particular?
---
Make another one of these but with tick manipulation
---
Ah I see. Wealth is relative. Players who can do theatre of blood for instance can easily earn over 2k per game tick. For some people prayer is expensive, so they flick, but I'd say for the majority of the player base the cost of convenience is completely worth it. Its legitimately not worth prayer flicking outside of bosses ever on a mid level main, although I can definitely see your point in regards to irons.
---
I literally did this two days ago. Some of us are still in 06 :(
---
No. I hate the desert. 
---
Just kidding, looks pretty sweet man.
---
Are we just going to ignore the 31 minutes played in 4600 days... waaaay more impressive than anything Alkan's done
---
I wouldn't go that far. Back in the day nobody even knew about flicking yet people still played
---
Can someone give me a detailed analysis of this Tl;dr
---
Nice edit quality work
---
The fourth repost of the same thing.
---
It is worth its price, but rigour is much better to have.
---
If you can do bosses like vork and zul, spending that money isn't too bad since you can make the money back and the prayer slowly pays for itself.
---
Yup.

Thank you I'm a big dumb some times
---
It's up to you. I personally would make sure I have most major gear upgrades in place before getting rigor/augury. If you have the gear, get the prayer. But get the DHCB first
---
Was at half mast before I realised it isn't a real model
---
We're not just talking about you flicking an abyssal demon you slayerscape player, even though you couldn't perfect tick that.
---
1) Runecrafting isn't a gathering skill
---
2) I'm reading your comments and I honestly just get the feeling that you don't like runescape and you just play it because you're addicted. But because you don't like runescape, you don't want to actually interact with the game and for whatever reason, you don't like the fact that other content exists in the game that people actually have to and like to interact with. 
---
I'm not trying to be rude but you really should be looking towards another game if you think fundamental mechanics in how the game was built is bad game design.
---
I think he's talking about nmz where this is a thing you actually want to do
---
lmao piss cheap like that whore ex of my, up top guys!
---
So is warding.
---
Lol I was real confused why you were concerned about a range item and a mage prayer 😂
---
I'll fabricate my foot up ur ass
---
Bro you gotta flatten the metal and make a bunch of tiny chain links, I'm surprised it doesnt take longer.
---
I have a F2P 40 att/def uncapped str pure, would start a 1 att pure if this was added tbh
---
Got both use rigour a lot more, that being said if you raid/vorkath a lot just buy the dhcb the. Save for rigour. Should only take 2ish weeks depending on play time.
---
People were getting fire capes long before prayer flicking was a thing...
---
Best you can afford I'm guessing. Go to the DPS calc, with a little playing you can see what the GP per DPS is
---
They showed their stats on the birthday stream and it said about 25-30 hrs/week was the average. But again, it doesn't matter if it's the majority or minority, the point is: For the subset of players who are dedicated enough to flick for hours on end, the effort they use is always better spent on just playing an alt account instead.
---
Try to make achievements, 70 slayer is one yes, or just change your routine. I’m sure you’ll find something else fun to do. Or just after every slayer task do your clues. Its a nice change of pace:)
---
This one actually makes a lot of sense to nerf though.

the news in venezuela say that they arent in a dictatorship ,well , news never lie.

Just got the morytania legs 3 and decided to try out barrows. I don’t know if it’s my rng but holy hell that was some juicy profit. Almost a mill off seven chest
---
Who tf is asmongold and why do we care
---
Do you enjoy skilling or PvE more?  Skilling has a lot more options in p2p and offers "funner" ways to than F2P imo.  Slayer is always a good place to start because it turns into really good money.  No particular quests I can think of off the top of my head, but there are plenty that are useful if you have a goal in mind.  
---
Some great passive moneymakers are farming and bird house runs while more conventional money makers can be slayer or blast furnace or a bunch of things.
---
5% extra accuracy over eagle eye isn't gonna change much of anything but ok.
---
Did hunter hurt you in the past?
---
Prayer flicking is the only thing keeping me awake while doing slayer. Otherwise its just me watching the monsters HP drop and occasionally eating a shark.
---
Imagine landing near lottery odds and it’s on a 20 year old video game
---
Good
---
Weird method. When I was trying to become a Master White Knight I just killed 1300 black knights. To each his own I guess.
---
I really don’t get the nerf though. Yes, more people are using runners or alts, but for alts, they need to be members first of all, and runners have been around since the og rune grind; especially laws. Why nerf it now?
---
&gt;Or he never learned about others personal space and what is socially acceptable. I don't want a president that is either of those.
---
You literally already have one like that.
---
Now baked are you bro that’s just a camo cap
---
Pray flicking saves 180k *value* of effort.
---
You're essentially "making" 180k per hour by changing your style to constantly focus on it.
---
...
---
Does anyone... **anyone** understand the value behind AFK'ing shit?
---
There's a reason everyone thinks 0 drain prayer flicking is balanced; it's annoying as shit to exert effort to do. That's why people pay to fucking ignore the mechanic for tedious things like slayer.
---
Overpowered would be if there was 0 drain pray with the ability to be afk.
---
EXODIA!   OBLITERATE!
---
Ask his parents for his runescape account
---
I'm the same way. I can't not do something otherwise I really just want to full afk it, so I flick the receiving attack and my attack on most combat/tasks.
---
Other teams how can do tob tried it in his gear and it did not work out
---
What did they do?
---
Damn dude spoiler
---
Yeah, how dare Jagex try to prevent people from getting onto accounts by putting 1 hour locks after suspicious inputs.
---
Step 1: log onto the account, and move away to a place that isn't a pvp safe zone
---
Step 2: log out
---
Step 3: log onto pvp world
---
Step 4: Pk the account so it loses its stuff
---
This would bypass both requiring a bank PIN to hop to a PvP world, because you can't require bank PIN on login without adding a lobby system, and requiring a bank PIN to exit PvP safe zones, because you'd be logging in while already outside of a safe zone.
---
*varrok
---
weird you want to spend more time banking and less time killing bosses
---
Holy fucking shit I want to hug you
---
Get this absolute garbage post out of here
---
They are all very clean. Except for the fire rune
---
Did you keep all the noted fish? It’s a lot of free cooking xp.
---
Thanks for sharing, I've been curious what the original image was
---
Woah.
---
I'd support this for sure, but Jagex just recently said that adding servers is a really big task. They just added a few Oceania servers, so it's not impossible. The issue is more of a corporate thing. If Jagex sees the demand and a reasonable potential for growth in the region, corporate will approve investments in servers for the area. unfortunately I don't think South America is part of the OSRS target audience, so new servers for you seems unlikely.
---
**But apparently, everyone IS sweaty according to you.** Because EVERYONE can be arsed to pray flick 100% of the time.
---
I would argue that "terrible game design" is part of the OSRS charm, and one of the reasons its more popular than almost every modern day MMO.
---
Swampy can’t even catch it yet you dumb shit
---
For real. Runecrafting is terrible even with people currently doing what they do at ZMI.
---
Clickbait
---
Why is there confirmation? Like, are you sure you want your shit recolored to yellow?
---
Which names has he scammed?
---
Just curious honestly.
---
If it took his mind off things and he had fun playing with friends, was it really a waste? Nice spelling BTW
---
Inferno would be almost impossible without prayer flicking
---
Gold pieces
---
Wow had to watch it again. Thanks
---
If you get a 99 and nobody is around to say “Gz.” did you really get it
---
I tried the vanilla client after it didn't work on runelite. It didn't work on the vanilla either
---
thanks I'll try that
---
I prefer the SGS personally.
---
Oh shit thanks
---
A jar of Mayo. Just kidding, a blowpipe. Hey dont get too excited pole smoker, im talking about the weapon, not your favorite past time.
---
That's Jagex's fault for designing content around it when it's a bug/not intended to be that way.
---
/u/GentleTractor you need to stick to making maps. Everything you post on about gameplay wise doesn't seem well thought out. Maps are grade A work though.
---
&gt;Just maxed my rs3 account after a couple years
---
See you on the 1250 total world in 2030.
---
ironmen aren't allowed to prayer flick as they stand alone btw
---
Share your setup bro stop hogging all the xp
---
Would just be rude at this point
---
if ... you what? why ?
---
H
---
Thanks! Dont remember clicking the all option but fixed it now
---
670 kc uim
---
I got daxe
---
*cries*
---
Thanks for the correction
---
Too true
---
Damn that was sad.
---
Got you fam
---
It lets you select 1 tile that nobody can use anymore.
---
Big thanks dude. That fixed it
---
Well boosting is a bit different than buying the same sense as Crafting or Fletching. But yah, I don't see how they could let you buy fabric and Runecraft it into robes without it being too strong or feeling off. Running 5 fabric to an altar to make a robe top for 10 exp would feel weird and out of place. But if you could make at a bank like with Leathers, it would make a buyable and semi-afk RC method even if it still had bad exp.
---
As for the name, Enchanting or Imbuing are similar. I think Glyphing is closer to what it is actually going, but that sounds worse than Warding. But of all the criticisms, the name seems like a big nitpick. It is a skill about drawing magical symbols called Wards; it doesn't matter if it isn't an established thing in OSRS since the point of a new skill is to add new things and mechanics.
---
Proof?
---
The examples in your argument are terrible and they are economically stable because they are both consumables. Seeds get used when they are planted, so outside of people hoarding seeds, they won’t flood the game. Similarly whips are consumed when paired with a tentacle. 
---
The concern of an item sink is for items that never go away unless alched/lost. How do you keep pve armors and weapons from losing all monetary value as they flood the game? People want an item sink to keep permanent, non degrading items from losing excessive value.
---
im proud of u
---
Awesome, glad to hear it :) good luck with your new adventure!
---
I think it depends on what you are trying to do. It can be tough, but there are a ton of good tutorials online and a good community, and its very rewarding. I would highly recommend it!
---
Reported.
---
Also his back left leg won't move at all before the range attack, but it'll move before the magic attack even casts. Gives you an instant indicator which one it is, more reliable than trying to remember the sounds at least
---
Wait, they're nerfing rc runners now? Can someone explain
---
I straight up do not understand how people keep making this comparison. One saves 200k gp an hour. The other gives you 200m in combat stats in a week. One of those things is very obviously more game breaking than the other. 
---
Also, specing 20 accounts doesn’t take skill. Making 20 accounts is annoying and tedious and not against the rules. Specing those 20 accounts is easy and against the rules. How hard is that to understand?
---
That’s why raids are so enjoyable when you have prayer enhances for olm :)
---
OG prayer flicking, should be the only flicking. Not that unlimited prayer bs.
---
Not everyone brings pickaxe
---
It's pretty silly
---
Love my boy spitz #ot
---
Nice Australia only ironman!
---
You must be fun at parties...
---
yes
---
Wait so my Ultra filled bottomless bucket is empty since there's no bottom to hold it?!?
---
Trade one of the other bots and see what happens lol.
---
Is it possible to do Inferno without any prayer flicking, or is Inferno balanced around it?
---
Why would that be a waste of time since he's not a HCIM? I'd argue it's a waste of time for every type of account.
---
Chop chop!
---
Look bro just ignore list then, my ignore list almost entirely spam/scam bots. Only stupid people or new people get scammed. Just be smart and don’t get scammed.
---
The type of person who wants weed to be illegal because they don’t smoke it haha
---
Start Hunter lol
---
They trade back and automatically accept
---
Okay now this is epic.
---
Does he really think WoW is a better game?
---
Savage methods wow
---
Yean honestly if someone wants to waste time making 20 accounts to get 200m combat xp on one who fucking cares that doesn’t affect me at all
---
it was worth watching till the end
---
you using a surface?
---
They do, I got my goblin scroll from the ones across the bridge by the al Kharid gate
---
Goodbye
---
Are OSRS pvmers in favour of or against prayer flicking as a pvm tactic?
---
Well, Ill keep trying. What was you KC before you got it?
---
why do you do clues
---
I botted melee with nmz, I was betting 24/7 for 30 days straight and haven't recieved a ban yet
---
How do you force XP randoms? I am new to osrs and did not know this is a thing?
---
I got it in around 6k kc
---
are you doing air runes in f2p???
---
Not even mad that’s a 4D chess move
---
Question: getting comments saying my slayer is pretty high for my combat, do you guys think i should go for untrimmed slayer cape as my first 99? And would it even be possible at this point without doing split slayer? (I.e; do one damage and have an someone else kill amd get partial exp). I would NOT do the split killing method because of how long that takes lol. 
---
But a trimmed slayer cape would be cool as my first 99. However I think its not possible with my HP being its current level, I think hp might be my first 99. Tbh ive been meaning to do some nmz to get 95-97 str and also because i need to imbue a cpl rings, plus salve ammy.
---
What does rooty tooty point and shooty do?
---
Prayer flicking (lazy) is a core mechanic. One tick flick, I could see some changes in future
---
🦀🦀🦀 1,100$ PEN BTW 🦀🦀🦀
---
What name would you come up with for a skill that craft magical robes?
---
I understand you think of it as a bug and abuse.
---
But others view it as an emergent tech for the game that made it better.
---
You think its bad design, but its an amazing tool that was easily built around and now is beautiful imo.
---
Plenty of others games have similar "bugs" that made the game better. I think this is one of them.
---
Removing prayer flicking would only lower the skill ceiling and reduce player interaction.
---
Flicking is optional outside of one instance though, it's just a trade off between attention and trip length. 
---
I 50/50 between just praying constantly and flicking, adds a decent variety to tasks and level of focus to keep combat from simply being attack, alt tab, repeat and never felt forced to do it but I also don't care for max efficiency so that might be why.
---
Yes sir!
---
It’s not good for cannoning though because they have very little hp. I’ve trolls are pretty good as far as gp goes
---
I want a finale to the sea slug questline in the form of a raid. Go full out H P Lovecraft
---
Something being game breaking and people caring about it are two different things. I couldn’t care less about rankings and highscores like most people presumably don’t. Doesn’t mean it should be allowed.
---
Not everything has to have click intensive method that grants best xp/hr. But if something like that needs to exist it shouldn't be the current prayer flicking. It changes prayer as a skill. Prayer points are mean't to be drained. If the prayer level was the only requirement for using prayers and you could leave them on 24/7 with no cost they would probably be balanced differently.
---
It’s not gatekeeping. Playing on 8+ accounts is ridiculous even if you are “just killing them with the one”
---
Hi there.

Mate if you’ve ever played an alt or two you will know what I mean
---
BTW
---
The reset time is based on when you complete throne of Miscellania quest. I personally check every week when I do a farm run in the morning. I think it’s better profit to put at least 750k for ten days and wait the ten days. Read the wiki: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Throne_of_Miscellania

Forget warding , give me dungeoneering like 2010 scape or just leave it as is
---
hehe wasnt kempQ :)

It was a poor attempt at a coup. Most Venezuelans support Maduro. Citation: the Maduro rallies that bring thousands of people. Meanwhile Guaido could get 25 people to try to attack Maduro before giving up and running to brazil for asylum.

I did bloods all the way to 99, wasn't too bad.

sooooo cuuuute

going to give it a go, never got to experience wow since my parents only would buy potato computers

He said the same thing, when he watched the clip he said the sound came late on the stream

I really hope he takes community call outs on imps.

I can almost hear him now banging on about how he wants to avoid using imps other people have found, the proud fool.

This meme is fucking legendary.

When you call trading someone  your time for money in an mmorpg an unintended mechanic

you had me at bone quarry.
---
Should I use demon butter? And how? He keep interrupting me
---
Just how many anal beads do you have sitting in your bank?
---
I would personally wait until you unlock nieve.  It can't hurt to try low level Slayer but some of the tasks are just obnoxious.  For me it wasn't just the xp rates, it was having no skips and getting a task in the desert or something.
---
  I would not go to konar without 30 points to skip a task, she gives some terrible ones.
---
you heard it here: jamflex is gonna remove prayer flicking EXCEPT in the inferno
---
Anyone willing to teach me how to raid? I'm 115 cb, flat 90 combat stats, 99 range and 90 herblore. I tried soloing but it is damn hard learning to solo first.
---
Panic buy pray pots!
---
Join the we do raids discord
---
I added the rewards for ease of use.
---
Vanilla WoW was actually shit that did not really work. If they came out with a Burning Crusade server, sure.
---
I'm not sure why, but this looks Photoshop'd as fuck to me. Also, 4 consecutive years of growth? Was there that big of a loss previously?
---
Low-key you are
---
Lmfao well the inferno is now impossible.
---
The point is: we need an item sink. Adding these onto existing content doesn’t offer any incentive to use the new item sinking method over the older method. Adding a new skill does do that
---
I would actually start playing again if they nerfed prayer flicking.
---
I absolutely hate the idea of having to click a button constantly while in combat just to keep up with all the try hard trying to save every penny they can. It's pathetic that prayer is used in a way it was never intended to be used.
---
On top of all that prayer potions are still extremely over priced. For no good reason.
---
Ah ok, thanks a lot :)
---
Oh I didn't know this was a thing. I'll try at some point. Thanks!
---
Would you recommend a Barrows tank top instead of a bcp for a learner?
---
22ms according to runelite. Should be low enough I'd imagine.
---
Woooosh
---
Damn TIL!
---
I believe Ash still has a bunch of shares from the early days aswell
---
Spoiler
---
Well, i just think the internal systems aren't set up to deal with the bots quickly enough. Like it probably takes a full time jagex employee 10 minutes to ban 1 bot. They need to funnel it down and get it to like 30-seconds.
---
Dear god. So the most tedious and annoying skill to train is getting shadow nerfed?
---
How are they planning to 'fix' this 'terrible problem'?
---
Appropriate answer
---
Thanks buddy
---
Found the college kid
---
Wtf is that an IP address or something?! Speak American
---
What level do you think I could get by spending 15m?
---
Until a few weeks ago I thought that flicking was just turning the protection prayer on only during the enemy's hit tick.
---
Then I saw Settled doing the real thing.
---
I'm a musician. I have rhythm. But I still. Can't. Fucking. Flick.
---
So we downvoting warding or what boys?
---
People really, really overstate how much depth prayer adds to rs.
---
It adds droplets into a puddle.
---
Ayy y'all know when you type yo password inna chat dat shit get censored?
---
Ya.... mine would just say read today's material and then do the homework.
---
Didn't even know it was tradable. Think I forgot to put the tar in the barrel.
---
I think it takes a second for area sounds to be disabled when you logg in.
---
Tick manipulation is one of the few things left in the game that really requires some sort of skill so I see no problem with it
---
Jokes aside, to anyone skipping straight to the comments, **please** go back and read this post in its entirety if you plan on voting on the Warding poll at all.
---
Like if these nerds want 'deep' mmo content. Try playing old WoW or pre Stormblood FFXIV at a high level.
---
Or playing Blade and Soul PvP.
---
Do you just like being a contrarian, or do you actually think you've learned something challenging and special?
---
They can absolutely remove it without reworking the "whole game engine" and turning the game into RS3. Your entire message, was just you talking out of your ass,
---
0000
---
84 for max portal nexus tho
---
Depends on what goals you have, some things you want really badly and you can stay on all day for, other stuff I can't even stand doing for an hour. Also have to consider that everyone lives different lives, like some people work and have families, while others have all the free time in the world
---
yup right as i fucking get Dharok walking through a door on my ironman
---
SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD
---
Prayer is overpowered as fuck as is lmao, prayer flicking being a thing is ridiculous.  I mean you're basically immune from taking damage AND you get to keep your prayer points? Laughable.
---
Same.  Here we go again. May drama calendar prepare yourself.
---
The core value in osrs for me is the combat, it's why RS3's EoC didn't work for me. Implementing wards and conjuring would fuck with the combat dynamics so much. Jagex, don't touch the combat dynamics in such a radical way. New weapons and specs, alas, but this is too much I think.
---
I just did 50-83 with oak larders, cost just under 20m I think with butler fees and then another 6m roughly to kit my house out with the necessaties.
---
The nerfs to ZMI will mean that the best achievable rc experience rates come from lava running, an activity that has very high requirements to be done efficiently by players, but can be done by a handful of level 3 bots immediately after account creation. Can you explain how you are going to address this and why restricting an established community is a better option? It's always possible to poll trading in ZMI as if it were a new update if it is just a question of respecting what was polled. After all, arbitrary trade restrictions aren't really a good look for managing experience rates.
---
Are birdhouses good for XP or just passive income?
---
I feel like if you were going to do that, Tithe farm would be much better xp and basically the same thing
---
Im not complaining. I happen to have 85 farming 82hunter and 99 magic so feelsgoodman. And hell ive been waiting for something fresh but yes i do hope it ends up to be something somewhat enjoyable and not a garbage skill that has no relevancy. Oh! There better be a sick ass pet too. But hey either way new content should be nice and i somewhat trust jagx for osrs, the cape is cool too.
---
Jesus buddy are you vaccinated or something
---
Thank you for making this very well thought out post. In discussions i've had i've found it hard to thoroughly convey my distaste for the new skill, which was heavily based in the areas of "its a boring concept, that adds nearly nothing new, just moves existing content that 'makes sense to be a skill' and at the same time suggests radical changes to the game and an economy-stabiliser that doesn't feel like it belongs to that skill like it would to an Invention.
---
A part I personally think you missed is discussing the dissolving more, and suggesting it as expansions on existing skills as well, as a way to offer some untradeable benefit to levelling them, as currently these only exist in the sense of quest / diary requirements, and very little benefit to the player. Everyone can just buy the armour smithing makes, for example. But if maybe we wanted to reinforce our armour to have slightly better stats as a degradeable component (just a crap small example off the top of my head) we could use our experience in a skill, and materials gathered from deconstruction, to bolster existing content.
---
That could be attached to pretty much every production skill, as a benefit to their created items, while also seeking to sink items.
---
It is very common for goldselling sites to ask for an ID to safeguard themselves from chagrebacks.  I would not be concerned.
---
That's the only way I can do it, for the life of me I can't time it where the overhead is always active but your points don't drain
---
Thank you so much, I’ll try it tonight when I’m home and update :)
---
&gt; Also, possible to sync up in game kill count and what it says on the slay helm?
---
This isn't a Jagex issue, its a Runelite issue with it not always detecting kills.
---
Why do so many people think there needs to be a new item sink? An item sink reduces the supply of certain things, yes, but it does so at the cost of making other things more common. What do people think could be made more common without causing an upset?
---
Occult altar, ornate pool(s), ornate jewelry box, nexus room also with mounted digsite pendant and xeric talismans
---
Granted it's just about positive but I'd have to learn to do fight caves with melee only as it would be 5.33 XP per hit on range to 1.33 XP per hit, would be much more viable towards untrimmed slayer that way plus the bonus 25k slayer XP for completion would be a bonus rather than covering a deficit.
---
Please fucking try harder next time.
---
There is a lot of mechanics that wasn't meant to be in the game. CoX wasn't meant to be soloable when it came out. Do you think the community would be happy if the changed it to that? It really does not matter what is intended and not, they want to make the best game possible for their community. Preventing people form putting in time and effort to learn the few mechanics that's currently in the game to get an edge would lose them a large chunk of their player base and the game would slowly die off.
---
How's this different than just a larger version of Brimhaven course, apart from the XP not being stored in tickets.
---
I have black family and friends who would disagree. The word stemmed from that of one that was meant to oppress a race.
---
Was it rendi?
---
What is co op slayer??
---
Going to make note that while Warding does fit into some skills, a lot of those skills could fit into each other as well.  It's being branded as making Magic equipment, so IMO it's unfair to say it'd fit into crafting which makes Range equipment unless you can say that Crafting + Smithing are interchangeable as one makes armor and the other hides.
---
Lets be real. One very specific piece of end game content should not justify the continued existence of a core mechanic to combat in the entire game.
---
doesnt bcp have high defence stats anyway?

Warding is just extra pointless "stuff" to get an item sink into the game.

Runecrafting

Also that is the chance of getting it on "xx" kill, not "in xx" kills. He has had 600 attempts at this, reducing the chance further.
---
It does have an end... Just that it was added post 07 so it's in RS3 if you wanna play it lol.
---
You say you can already craft Xerician robes and make Cerb boots with runecrafting, but those were just shoe horned into those skills as there was no place it really fit.
---
Agreed
---
Fk that newscape stuff, it's like training rc through ToG with bad profits
---
Exactly 
---
None would but they would be buying bonds with the profits so jagex still makes something out of it in the end
---
10k slayer xp, so you are getting like... 40k str or attack xp??? That is insanely low.
---

---
Your friend may be a complete fool. Cut ties
---
Was this mentioned recently? Last time I checked, they said that they'll see if it's possible to add an alternative method to get to the fairy ring area that the quest uses.
---
runelite. It's open-source so players can help developing it, has tons of plugins and customization and most importantly completely free. You should check out some guides for it if there are any because there is really a lot of stuff that u can set up to ur liking
---
The other option would be osbuddy which you have to pay for to make it useful really
---
Oh and yeah make sure not to click any weird links for runelite.. there are some phishing ones apparently
---
Adding the content of warding into crafting, runecrafting and magic (without battle wards/conjuring) would greatly rejuvenate relatively dead skills.
---
Runecrafting is slow but fairly useless too. Yes at high levels you can make good money, but it is in no way a top money maker.
---
Crafting is again of limited use beyond making armor you can otherwise buy for little gold.
---
Imagine making situation-specific BIS robes combining runecrafting with magic and/or crafting. That means much more motivation.
---
Want another skill? Find something completely unrelatef to current skills like the original post suggests.
---
the man down under experience
---
Because it isn't in the spirit of the game. It's an exploit
---
Also with the sound its incredibly easy to hear the 'du-dum' of the mage attack. This should be the only thing you need to pay attention to for pray flicks.
---
Skilling won’t ever be profitable
---
Pretty much how I feel about it too.  I think everything Warding brings to the table (battlewards/conjuring aside) fits into OSRS and don't think it'd be wise to bloat the skills it could fit into without Warding.  Locking content behind RC would never pass a poll, and making the items tradeable probably wouldn't either.  People hate RC - because of how boring it is, not because its slow and not afk (take slayer for example).
---
Just stick with zulrah, people with alot lower stays do it and make good money, and considering you average 100k per kill, it's very easy to make money, why do you think it's going to take a long time before you make profit?
---
With my rng of getting 2 pets under 600 I ain't takin no chances
---
That's not possible if you're using ultra compost.
---
&gt; The minimum number of [herbs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Herbs) increases from five to six (when compared to supercompost), and overall the crop yield is around 20% higher on average
---
Minimum should be 6 with ultracompost.
---
Would love a graphical rework of Kraken and the environment tbh. Same goes for all the wilderness bosses.
---
Nightmare zone dharoks autmn elegy style is 125k xp hr for me so yeah
---
Make /u/landonorris a PMod.
---
To be fair I think smithing/crafting could be cool if you could use it to make augments for armor/hides, and the same could be done to warding instead of creating new BIS gear.  (For example, damage boost of 3% against Dagganoths).  Of course this would all be subject to polls/balancing, just a quick thought I had reading your post.
---
Yeah it is. He dropped his 75 hp account for a different build that was viable via poisoning Jad to out dps the healing that the ring couldn't in testing.
---
You’re wrong lol. Op gave him the mil, he didn’t lose it nor was it his to lose anymore. His friend lost the mil
---
Demonic gorillas
---
Boosting from 83 isn't a bad idea. 82 is more annoying but certainly doable. It's an easy step relative to other item steps so I would just hold onto it.
---
I did this until I started farming Torstol, but that's only because I finally outpaced my herblore...
---
Get some chins, aoe all healers
---
E x e !

[[GET BOND]]
---
Rigour is a massive improvement
---
Tried this but 12 hours later it still asks for authenticator on log in
---
Noob it’s not oziach for barrows gloves. You talk to him to be able to unlock wearing anti dragon shield.
---
If this gets added I quit rs that same day. 
---
After staking ofcourse
---
in michigan also. norther part. not a damn thing is loading for runescape related things only. about to try mobile...
---
Okay perfect thanks!
---
Oh, I'm sorry then. My mistake. It's just that I remember the runelite timer resetting whenever I tried to flick that.
---
I would say it’s probably quicker to make a new account.
---
T bow at 75 makes things like 1 prayer fire cape a lot easier. Still requires tons of skill of course but you literally 4 hit jad
---
The last time I made this argument I was down-voted into oblivion. I guess I still need to figure out this subs menstrual cycle.
---
Default. Unless you like easyscape
---
Runelite if you like easyscape. But beware it comes with basically every annoying ass plugin enabled by default
---
You're going far man, this went way over my head.
---
Depends on your luck, but not too bad of a grind. One of the best weapons you can get though.
---
Just takes practice. Try getting a fire cape and I promise by the time you do, you'll have it down. Seriously, just keep doing it till you get it. And you'll be fine
---
&gt; punished?
---
Lmao; people are that used to prayer flicking that it's some sort of death sentence if it's removed; that alone shows how op this shit is.
---
I stopped playing rs3 before this happened. What exactly is the point of an "elite" skill?
---
Yeah fuck pray flicking on task. I'll either camp bandos + piety and protection prayer or I'll just use prossy and afk with prot melee
---
🦀 You’re scraping the bottom of the barrel to fill the drama calendar 🦀
---
🦀 Players won’t respond to this comment 🦀
---
Don't you need to constantly wait for sgs specs or do like 70 minute runs to camp prayer all the way through?
---
birdhouses are good profit.
---
If you cheese a million sgs specs yes
---
Thanks it worked, lost my elder maul and fury due to the DC. FeelsBadMan
---
Body? Looks more like stone to me
---
*huh?*
---
Actually I just rewatched the old 43 prayer vid. His acc name was 'Kemp Vs Jad' not 'Kemp v Jad'. Could still be Kemp but it also be someone else.
---
Damn thats nice! Congrats man
---
They just want to be able to rewrite the skill entirely several times until they can trick us into voting it in.
---
It’s obvious they have no idea what warding is at all. It’s just a scattered amalgamation of several concepts. They even named it warding and made it a “magical / fantasy” skill so they could truly just cram anything they wanted in to get it to pass “because magic”.
---
Just tell it to always add 1 then after it rounds then if they can't make it round up
---
Ye, I thought it was a Dragon Slayer 2 spoiler. I've seen the new GoT but I'd be bummed if I saw this before!
---
This is my relationship with the zgs, black dragon mask, and zammy helm master steps. Those are the only emote items I'm missing to have all requirements for every clue.
---
Jabait them
---
Gratz
---
I got arcane yesterday 4.57m so ur lying
---
Oh damn didn't know those were reqs. That sounds awful
---
I'm 70 hunter and only about 30 minutes was of actual training. Everything else is from birdhouses. Also, I've gotten tons of good seeds from it, so just because they nerfed it doesn't mean it's bad profits
---
good tl;dr
---
time to watch all the hcim die
---
No see, if we start OP at nothing, then he gained 1m, which he gave to his friend. So he didn't lose anything either! It goes (0 + 1 - 1 = 0)  
---
See how arbitrarily stupid that reasoning is?
---
I can't wait for it to get removed sooner then, you lying piece of trash. The fact that Pray flicking is the only thing keeping you playing is atrociously sad, and quite frankly hilarious as hell.
---
Its not gonna pass mate.
---
I don't understand why people have a problem with prayer flicking... SMH.
---
No doubt it takes skill to prayer flick, but designing content around an unintended mechanic to cater to the 10% elitist players doesn't sound like a brilliant ideea to me. No offence to anyone, I couldn't give less of a shit about prayer flicking as I'm not planning to do the inferno anytime soon myself, but it still feels a bit wrong.
---
On the 8? I can do about 4 slayer tasks b2b and multitasking and still have about 40% percent.
---
what, free? dude didn't even lose his own money =/
---
But to answer the question. Yes, of course he thinks WoW is better than osrs.
---
Can also be done with DDS - you can check a whole 4 times that way!
---
A cool boss in a cool environment with a cool pet.
---
Nice chunk of slayer xp/h for a boss monster and a decent drop table.
---
The changes GG's actually need:
---
- Falling rocks on phase 2 sometimes come down in 1 tick and are unavoidable.
---
- The dribble damage you take throughout the fight should be a bit less, you can get hit 7+7 in one tick trough prayer. You should be rewarded for flicking prayers correctly.
---
I always do rooftops (seers) on mobile while netflix, I find it really easy to do and afk enough. If you think agil is less afk than RC, use them on agil, otherwise i would choose the slowest: RC.
---
Lmfao you know, I think the only way to file an official complaint would be to video yourself attempting to cook a wooden bucket of water irl and then if it is possible Jagex will sort it.
---
Either way this is gonna be good.
---
Your math looks good in theory.  But in reality it’s 50/50
---
by afking i mean distracted by something on netflix xd
---
Yeah I learned not to give new buddies money until they get somewhat invested.
---
Fight kiln was a joke and any shitter who had gear completed it by day 3. It was terribly easy (not just the waves, lol trapping Jads and the final boss being an easy 0 mechanic tank test) and nothing from it should ever be implemented into the Inferno.
---
"Just click literally 12,000 times per hour without messing up your rhythm, it's nothing special. If you don't want to get carpal tunnel just use ppots"
---
Unintended mechanics make become some of the best features of games. It's something we don't see anymore and it is sad. Quake and early cods were so good because of the movement bug allowing strafing to accelerate you. There are also many other bugs that were part of these games that added depth and knowledge that are simply incredibly hard to come up with intentionally. So many games these days just feel two dimensional becuase devs and players are for some reason upset when something is unintentionally very good and then remove it. 
---
People always come back with the argument that it's an exploit and should be removed and I want to ask you simply, why? Why is a good accidental feature and issue, why does that really bother you that much. I can't understand it why it actually bothers people simply because it is not intended, judge it on it's merits.
---
And a lot of people do 3 skele's, which gets you to the 88%. I assume the 2 skele &amp; worm is to avoid ANY chance at the racks, but that would equal less runes
---
You dont have to just choose between 0 drain prayer flick and no prayer flick. I think a good middle ground exist between the two where flicking uses *less* prayer points than just leaving them on but still uses points. 
---
My main problem is 0 drain flicking. I get its difficult to do but it just completely negates the need for levels past augury and bringing prayer potions.
---
Oh so that's not 5 minutes then, herbs only would maybe be 5 mins, probably more now with all the spots they've added
---
&gt; I dont really want more niche items 
---
Niche items that assblast ancestral
---
Lets remove something because you think its to hard. Good one
---
3 tick granite and sand stone, or 3 tick iron ore in it he mining guild

You clearly do not understand the difference between possibility and probability...

Is it possible to allow pures to go back to ape atoll without getting the xd from dareo so pures can get addy gloves again like pre eoc
---
Thanks for being reasonable, because there are people that would vote it out even though it's not something that needs to be done in the game.
---
Looks like he has a vargoth meme in the middle of his wheel?
---
ahh okay, my bad.
---
You dumb fucks never heard of boiling water smh
---
Eh I dont own a DHCB, I get 3-4 kills a trip with my blowpipe. I think part of the problem is killing vorkath with a blowpipe is a lot different from killing him with a BP. 
---
For blowpipers that extra inv space can make the difference between an extra kill and having to teleport out at 10% hp.
---
I want farming contracts but for other skills! Like gather 2000 maple logs for a reward. That way a lot of items will disapear from the game. #SkillSlayerScape
---
Lol developing mobile costed them probably not even 1m how dumb u r

Love the people that actually get upset, like really upset when something is not intended and becomes part of a game, regardless of whether it is a good 'feature' or not.
---
If you get tired of those you can do blast mine
---
86% upvotes at time of posting, not everyone is as clueless as cheaters like you are. we are all glad at how much you are in panic mode.
---
You still lost something, you’re just deciding the reference point is before you have the ags. However, if you use the obtainment of the ags as the reference point, you lost an ags, which is how 99.9999% of people would think. You’re not any more right or wrong than anyone else you’ve been arguing with.
---
I screwed up my first jad because I was hovering over mage while he was using a ranged attack. Next attack was ranged, but I clicked to switch to mage for some reason...
---
You should give wraths a go if you’re able to, I’m looking to get 95 to try them out.
---
Get out
---
the only reason it's "inaccessible" is because of the prayer flicking requirement. Everything else about it can be learned after a few tries.
---
Prob got stats resetted recently :^)
---
I haven't played in a while, but now knowing pray flicking is getting nerfed makes me wanna return even less... Cool. This game aint what it use to be and I can now only see it's downfall for people like me. Props for all the people hyped for the new updates. But is it really what you want?
---
Yes.
---
No you are speculating we need a new skill. It is literally stated warding has impact on combat.
---
I think the hydra tail and drake claw should be reversed imo.
---
That way Hydra gives the boots of brimstone and drakes give the bonecrusher necklace. Now hydra is less shitty while drakes are dead content anyway.
---
Most people I see crying about it don't even have 55 magic to alch with. What would you suggest to these people?
---
I still need to beat Vorkath and Galvek... but I’m too distracted with getting 99 rc to focus on beating them right now.
---
zero times?
---
Black demons?
---
Wear veracs helm/skirt through the fight if you have a lower def level. That with the sara brew boost should keep you from taking much damage at 70 base def.
---
Nevermind that, we need to know, does he pay for the premium Mod Ash content?
---
Once he gives his friend the mil, it’s not his anymore.
---
If you gift someone a gift card and they lose it a week later... does that mean you lost it?
---
I don't know how you have completed the inferno and still think 1t flicking is a requirement....
---
im not speculating anything you dumbass, why do you think they are releasing a new skill in the first place?
---
&gt;It is literally stated warding has impact on combat.
---
yes, where did i dispute this? whats wrong with you?
---
Passed* 
---
And I’m not sure that’s something to be proud of.
---
Good point on the salvaging of cheaper items!
---
I feel though it could work out for the higher level items that can't be player-crafted (such as salvaging an armadyl godsword)
---
Is killing known bots (emblem farmers, dragon bots) considered an exploit?
---
Lot
---
I don't use an adblocker cause I feel like if I'm gonna use a site it does not hurt me to see adds on the side
---
Yea I do haha. They're some IRL friends but I'm definitely feeling big fish/small pond in this one. At the very least we've been enjoying ourselves and got a couple splits.
---
Almost 22m slayer xp and was 1 whip every 3 tasks avg until i blocked the shits... guess I found where all the whips were going
---
Sorry i'm not gonna say congratulations with that low detail plugin on.
---
I tried that but couldn't figure out when I was supposed to be clicking. 
---
So as long as I double click before the blue line reaches the right hand side of the orb it should work?
---
Not even inferno, but getting rid of flicking would ruin early questing/slayer on just about every ironman account.
---
Can't wait for them to add stampot bridge, and move the ge to literally everywhere because they pass the voting threshold on reddit.
---
Christ, you can't even tell memes from serious discussion. I'm out.
---
Just use rswiki lol
---
Damn this post belongs on r/iamverysmart.
---
There is nothing scientific about your logic. In fact it is just faulty. As soon as the wealth transfers you know own the object. Yes you did lose something because as soon as it came into your possession you owned it.
---
In fact, what is your definition for “having something”? It seems arbitrary to whatever situation you want it to be. The friend had the gold in his bank and he had it for presumably more than moments after he got it from his friend. When does this become “his” by your logic?  Or how about the third age example? Does the person have to get to a bank first? Sell it? When does it count as losing something? 
---
This pseudo math of +1 and -1 is not valid. You could extend that argument to whatever you want. Well when you are born you have two parents (+2) but then they die (-2). Did you lose virtually anything? No because 2-2=0. But we all know that’s garbage. You lost opportunities that could have happened given that event did not happen.
---
Why attack
---
The obvious answer is splashing. Its afk and only costs about 300k to get to 55 only using fire strike. Alternatively you could imbue your slayer mask and train on safe-spottable tasks for much more exp/hr.  Enchanting Jewelry is very slow but also SUPER afk and profitable. Runescape is grindy thats just how it is.
---
You aren't getting my point. Because it's closed source like almost every other game, you can never truly know if the poll results are rigged or not.

Lmao. That's literally what I stated you clown. Nmz merely changed the way combat is trained, nothing else. Adding warding directly changes how combat works. Is it really that hard to grasp for you?
---
Oh that’s fair then. Just tell them to suck it up and bring their own pick lmao but at least you guys are having fun and got some splits
---
I think I speak for GentleTractor and most free thinking people when I say, you'll be honoring GentleTractor by thinking critically about his propositions, and forming your own well informed decisions.
---
He isn't spending dozens of hours producing stuff like this so that the community will blindly follow his direction.  He wants to start a thoughtful discussion around what's best for the game.
---
Blindly upvoting literally anyone is dumb.  Think for yourself.  That applies to everything in life.
---
Honestly, thought the cape looked the coolest. That and I found sand crabbing really easy to do while I worked on school assignments.
---
Wym 20 minute afk?
---
You gotta at least click rapid heal every &lt;60 seconds and drink an overload every so often.
---
Do you know what game you're playing? This has been a problem since classic lmao. I for one am glad I can get certain things I don't want to farm cheap. You wanna go to green dragons all day, that's fine, just realize you're on the mental level of those Venezuelans you're calling bots.
---
Can you patch prayer flicking already?
---
Yeah a lot of people do that to avoid having to keep using the orb to get it back down again.
---
Really good too since you can only take damage the same as your hp, so absorption potions last a lot longer
---
Music, atmosphere, acting, props, the set were all 10/10.
---
But the writing? yuck.
---
No you want str so you have higher hits overall. Atk does help your accuracy but not so much it would warrant going for before 99 str because you would just be hitting consistent low numbers which you would think could be more dps, but it isn’t.
---
Too big of a buff. Would need nerf immedietly
---
thats pips
---
Please do more artwork, it‘s so easy on the eyes and so wholesome. I really like your style.
---
Its not "eh it could go into crafting" it's "I'm literally crafting this piece that will be imbued with magic power later" it's literally crafting.
---
If you are trying to get con xp at wintertodt at 99 hp than you are in a very different position than I am
---
angry venezuelan???
---
Splashing is garbage youre better off just going to sand crabs geared up youll get like 5x the exp or w\e
---
I'll agree with that.
---
There's no point to argue, you didn't take your meds.

Blowpipe is equally as good as Tbow imo, they just have different roles. In fact even in instances where you’d think tbow is better Blowpipe with dragon darts is usually better but nobody uses those since the price is extortionate.
---
Literally had that clue step yesterday. Luckily I'm not an ironman
---
So many fucking times...
---
**BUT ARE YOU A HARDCORE???** 
---
*Reeeeeeeeeeeee!*
---
Strength first for damage, Attack second for the accuracy.
---
Oops, I honestly didn’t know. I’m in the UK atm on holiday and don’t have much access to wifi. Stumbled upon this and wasn’t aware it was already shared.
---
Not true, PS clients can be infested with many many bad things that have permision to do anything given the player opens the client.  
---
Game needs to instal assets, during that time the client can rip saved chrome and or firefox passwords right from the browser even if it isn't open and just put them into a cosy online folder like dropbox. Thats only the start of what you Ccould do.
---
Calm yourself, lol.

Rabbit legs? Wha
---
By needing to upgrade them, do you mean I have to build the previous ones first? And thanks for the detailed answer.

I assumed it was everyone throwing their diary staves into ge quickly to buy scales and such. This makes more sense

I still cant justify spending that much to unlock a prayer. I guess I'll stick to eagle eye.

Technically, Reddit’s upvotes/downvotes aren’t meant to be used for posts you agree/disagree with. They are meant to upvote things that bring good discussion, and downvote irrelevant/unhelpful things. So from that perspective, if he has a full expectation that Gentle Tractor’s publishes opinion will cause discussion, then a blind upvote might be fitting ;P
---
you should also chop your own yews, pick your own flax, craft your own bowstrings and string your own yew longs to alch, that way 99 magic is completely free
---
RIP HCIM....
---
Ice burst/barrage and during nechs bring blood barrage as well for heals whenever you need it.
---
Thanks!
---
Sadly, this is exactly Bigredjapan's personality.
---
Yeah it was all about k style but k style was so diverse. Or maybe I was just a kid and loved it no matter what.
---
For real that area looks like a lovely place to live.
---
I was just about to say this. Soul Wars was an actually fun minigame that I could just keep playing.
---
Ah, I was wondering who got items I went three times over drop rate for
---
Unless they come up with good rewards
---
I do like a lot of the stuff in the proposed warding skill, but I definitely agree that the battle wards is a bad idea. If they want to add that, why don't they just add it to the magic skill? Maybe in a new warding spellbook or something. I just feel it would shift the meta way too much in pvp and pvm
---
I think it had a slight str bonus?
---
Normal dungeoneering is solo only on ironman, so if you don't like solo dungeoneering it's not great.
---
However, that's ignoring the hilariously broken elite dungeon token farming method where you can just leech it in a trio.
---
Ahh sorry bro
---
[Not the same guy, but I got this a couple weeks ago](https://imgur.com/j9rLgPw)
---
What part of unintended feature do you not understand? Effort vs Reward do not apply to these cases.
---
I bet you feel pretty good about yourself, don't you?
---
that would probably introduce an infinite prayer bug where you never go below 1 prayer point
---
Dust Devils and Nechryaels as they're very easy to burst/barrage. Once you get 93 you can also barrage Smoke Devils for ~75k slayer exp/hr. You should use ice burst or barrage if you have the level as they're the cheapest of the AoE spells while also having the highest dps. 
---
You can expect well over 200k magic exp per hour if you're not using defensive casts, and about 60-80k HP exp per hour. The slayer exp is around 50-70k depending on how sweaty you are.
---
&gt; In these cases if you think someones life is in danger you really should just call the Police, reporting it to the platform is better than doing nothing at all, but will build in an inevitable delay. Any verified Police Officer can contact us from a Police email domain if they need to 24/7, by email at lawcontact@jagex.com and response time is typically within 10 minutes. Will will also provide a 24/7 contact phone number to verified Police officers who contact us by email.

9.3% is still way above the expected rate of ~1/17
---
Imo prayer flicking is just a pain in the ass, so not being able to do it is a good thing.
---
With how much people fucking complain about "easyscape" no one seems to care about being able to be invincible for as long as you can bother to be as long as you have 43 prayer.
---
I am a hardcore ironman btw
---
Ranarr seeds would probably go up in price. Pickpocketing master farmers can get you like 20 of those per hour at 99 thieving so that’s not bad!
---
Easy? Didn’t it take him months?
---
It came out because jamflex *wanted* to do it so bad and they gave us no fucking information whatsoever. They were only hyping it up as a new skill, with no details. Most people thought it would be sailing.
---
If they actually told us details properly (like they're doing with warding), and if polling existed back then, you can bet your ass it never would have seen the light of day. At least personally, I'd have made like 100 accounts just to vote no to that garbage.
---
Grats and nice build!
---
It's not wrong, apparently. There's some messing around I have to do to figure out how my BGS spec affects things when I have void vs when I bring a 5 way melee swap. I have a feeling void's worse until really really high range, I'll check when I get home today
---
I’m at 200 with 6 drops, 7 including bolt racks. May luck be forever in your favor my friend!
---
Spoken like a true noob with welfare gear lmao.
---
Cause it's a boring and shit mechanic
---
The type of person to complain about getting 55 magic is going to much more likely prefer something AFK like splashing to normally killing monsters.
---
You don't need wall of text to know why Warding should fail.
---
Simply put: Add magic armour to the crafting skill.
---
*but crafting is bloated* - shit logic. The magic spellbook is "bloated" yet that never stopped Jagex from adding new spellbooks.
---
Yo man, PM me.  I am 114 combat, base 90s melee, 99 range and 86 mage.  I am still in the learning phase but the few duos I have done, I have learned a fuck ton from.  It is honestly pretty fun.  If you want to struggle but learn together, I am definitely down.
---
i hate training combat if i’m not doing a slayer task
---
You would most likely be better off using a blowpipe or dragon crossbow over the melee option
---
I just started a WC grind and the frequency of beginner clue nests is too goddamn high.  You’re right to say I could just not do them, but it’s kind of ridiculous that the frequency of clues that can drop masters/ have an achievement reward have been so ridiculously diluted
---
I'm suspicious of this being orchestrated to facilitate a sale of the company by whatever chinese company owns them. Hire new impressive talent, flash some cash, boom this company is great and here we go. There's still the managment issue that's been present for years and years, wait till after it's sold to see how things are actually doing.
---
Those points don't contradict themselves; they hit on all the same things in my post. It is a niche shield because it is generally not as good as the Ely, but it would devalue the Ely because it is better in certain scenarios, which also would be powercreep. Going from a 70% chance of 25% reduction to 100% chance of 30% reduction is still powercreep (defencecreep?) even if you won't wear it constantly due to the drain.
---
28 way switches m8, you don’t stand a chance in ur salad robes 🤦‍♂️
---
Maye take all these minigames people supposedly loved and mix them together to dream up a new one?
---
It won't be like it was anyway, might as well try to make something different.
---
I also like the idea of minigames that use a certain part of the map that already exists as opposed to going in an entirely dedicated area.
---
Mmhm, they're making it so you can't trade in in the zmi underground
---
Yeah, it's got the same stat bonuses as bandos chestplate minus the defense bonuses
---
It's free too, just takes a tiny bit of grinding
---
This discord is good once you have a few KC but for the first couple, youll sit in the mentor chat for hours without anyone going and then once you do itll be 10-15 people raids

I could not for the life of me remember why I ever played it. Completely forgot about dragon gauntlets that needed charging. Thanks.
---
I really don't have the bank to justify cannoning every task... but if I don't, slayer is even more miserable, so I do it anyways. 
---
Two more levels to MM2 requirements and sweet, sweet freedom from slayer!
---
4. Do calquats once you hit 70 farming.
---
5. Kill that Hespori lad in the farming guild.
---
Huh TIL.
---
castle wars was dead in rs2 as well. FOG was always booming because of the free magic exp and decent f2p rewards.
---
If u can afford a zammy hasta, use that and pray melee. If not, maging them with an anti-dragon shield and an extended anti-fire let's you take 0 damage.
---
You're right

---
It was great, but I spent all of my time in Clan Wars (I was  f2p at this time) back in those days.
---
I even remember being scared to even become a member because since all I ever wanted to do was Clan Wars and FoG, I knew becoming a member I would get obliterated by the new member power creep and spells I had no knowledge about compared the cheesy f2p mechanics I was already used to.
---
In the future, I would then spend all of my time solely on Soul Wars. Now THAT imo was the best minigame runescape ever had.
---
Same lol, but sometimes I afk NMZ while I do ToB and I get a solid 2 hour in and that’s enough if I do it every few days lol.
---
They want an EZ inferno cape
---
bet your chair smells bad
---
Yea haha I remember nat running worlds- it was $$$
---
I think it was half xp rates
---
And what's your defense for abusing bugs to have infinite prayer points?
---
5 million downloads of mobile and only 100,000 players active most of the time is interesting.
---
100 days of gameplay in 1 year? Jesus I thought I didn't have a life
---
Just got 99 farm last month. I stuck with papaya, calquat, mahogany, hespori. If you have a lot of spirit seeds you can use those too. I grinded tithe farm a decent amount as well. Herb runs daily for money and you can do watermelons too for extra xp.
---
Cannoning isn’t really expensive. If you do it for an entire hour it’s basically like 200k, your prayer pots cost a hell of a lot more than that.
---
Been playing this game for thousands of hours and still never found one myself lol

#GT for JMOD
---
Enough to keep the price of justicar at its current price? Surely not if it becomes irrelevant for inferno.
---
You're probably right, I only mentioned 2007-2012 because I remember those years being really fun in spite of the game's problems. 
---
I don't know much about RS3 after EOC. What else would you like to see brought over to OSRS?
---
I think that the issue was more that people were making new accounts to run runes. These other glitches don’t cause people to make new/ghost accounts so in my opinion they’re safe.
---
I'd say it's a 50/50 chance he understands
---
I think CoX, ToB, Inferno are pretty end game, and they've been the biggest updates since OSRS (that come to mind). Most of the player base is probably mid-level as well, and between slayer bosses and dragon slayer 2 there hasn't been a lot of content to place in that bracket. Look at Sekiro for example, a gem of a game that has been all but shat on by the larger gaming community for being  inaccesible to the casual gamer.
---
you're complaining it's expensive? I enchanted rings until 55 because u make slight profit on it. its click intensive but I am very poor and have a lot of time. After u get high alch there's plenty of items u can buy of the GE that u can alch for higher
---
"disaplined"...ok mom.
---
What helm? I don’t see anything
---
Just because you can’t trade doesn’t mean you can’t participate in a scam, could also have been an rs3 offense as someone pointed out
---
I'm sorry, what?  
---
You understand that people aren't playing OSRS Mobile 24/7 right?
---
My mother in law gave me shit once for “being too old and playing too many games” so I asked her how many shows she has on her DVR... She shut up lol
---
Free to play is fun, but won't hold your interest for that long. Just about everyone here is a member and that gives the game enough depth/content to play for years. If you're just looking to get some little numbers going while watching playoffs then F2P OSRS is fine/fun, but it's not a particularly deep or varied.
---
I watch a ton of hockey and usually have OSRS working on something in the background.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Flipping air runes. This comment made my day
---
hahaha this is exactly my thoughts on FoG. I just remember thinking that I was super smart becuase it gave free runes for magic training but thats it
---
Classic WoW graphics hold up a lot still for today's standards
---
Why do you want an untrimmed cape?
---
High DPI = high precision but the cursor will move slower.  
---
Low DPI = low precision but the cursor will move faster.  
---
Mouse sensitivity can be changed in your operating system's settings.
---
It all comes down to personal preference though. Generally it doesn't make a huge difference for RuneScape, unlike something like a first-person shooter.
---
RIP to our fellow brother ❤️❤️ May he watch over us all eternally

Can we remove saltpetre from the chamber of xeric drops? it the item serves no real purpose in the game that i know of short of gaining favor.
---
Blizzard will call the police if you say you’re going to commit suicide.
---
I remember playing this for hours with my sister in F2P because we couldn't afford P2P. It would be amazing to have it come back and give my sister a good reason to maybe come back for a while and relive those memories again :')
---
Same thing happened to me
---
How is this defence xp? The bug caused players to gain attack xp when switching weapons
---
This and Stealing Creation were my favourite 2 minigames from back in the day. I wish they would bring SC to oldschool.
---
the gloves that make some of ur ess count as 2 was the reward i did it for haha
---
Pleasepleaseplease
---
Not quite sure why so many downvotes I was just stating my findings, I don't expect anyone to believe me or to stop using prayers... I know it doesn't add up but that's just what I've found... The same can be said about blowpipe specs, the maths would suggest it's more accurate but 9/10 it hits a 0, that's the whole point of this thread lol go figure....
---
Anyway I found what works for me and I'll continue to test it, just wanted to know if anyone else experienced anything similar
---
World of 2005craft
---
Brainlet argument. Unless you sell the runes you get at less than average value, it's the same overall cost. Probably better to sell and then buy later as the price of runes tends to  exhibit a constant downward trend.
---
I personally use 7 of the 9 herb patches (dont have harmony or Weiss unlocked yet), both cactus patches, and bird houses to offset the loss on trees.
---
80k x 6 tree patches = 480k
---
38k x 6 fruit tree patches = 228k (though you only have access to 5 until 85 farming so 38k x 5 =190k)
---
So you lose about 670-740k depending on compost and protection of the yew trees with cactus spines.
---
On my herb, cactus, and bird house runs I make on average of about 175k. You can get in 5 runs in the time it takes for your tree to grow. So 175k x 5 = 875k. Even if you only get in 4 runs, you get around 600k.
---
Hopefully this gives you an idea of how to train farming quick with little to no cost.
---
Isn’t this the mini game in which everyone splashed their magic training?
---
I panicked because I took a melee hit while running off the healers lmao
---
Should check out the behind the scenes “the game revealed” might appreciate it a little more. I wish things went differently too but that doesn’t mean what we got was bad imo.
---
It's one of the best options in terms of gp/dps
---
So annoying when people talk about herblore being 'free' if you just bank all the herbs from your herb runs. Without a GE tax you spend the same GP.
---
Whips are 2.6m. Once you get 70 attack you should use a Sara sword to train str, since you can’t with a whip anyways. It’s slightly better than d scim and d def
---
Most of the good content you will likely be interested in requires very high skill levels. This means that for a lot of people, the game doesn't really start until well after the 200 hour mark. Depending on how you go about it, could be 300, 400, maybe 600 hours before you get to start doing a lot of the cool stuff. This game is very, very long.
---
Pogchamp who is this guy

EASYSCAPE REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Chester makes me understand why there are furries.

My mistake, it happened the same day.  Still a different (and much bigger) bug than the attack styles simply being changed.

Gotta be realistic, NMZ isn't ever getting removed (though getting relaunched would be cool), and there's constantly people all over the sub asking for recolours, I just put in the recent/popular ones as examples.

I can only imagine that a majority of the expenses incurred for the startup of Mobile are capital and will be depreciated over several years so I really doubt they took a huge hit in fiscal 2018.

Interesting. If they're actually 100k/hr I can't imagine why people don't do them.

The nostalgia player who wants battle wards LOL. 
---
Tick manipulation and PVP are the only things in this game that actually require skill - or to put it in other words, they are content meant for people with skill or the desire to develop skill in the game, and not you. 
---
You slayerscape folk can click on fire-giants for several hours a day just like you used to back in the day, tick manipulation has nothing to do with you. But stop with your crabs in the bucket mentality of stopping people with actual skill doing interesting things in the game (inferno, TOB soloes etc).
---
Splashing if you want to spend YEARS there. Just tele to camelot it only costs  1 law
---
For ranging, you either want 1 def or 42 def for void. At 40 you’ll be at a huge disadvantage because you’ll have the extra combat levels from def but without the big damage boosts from void. Prayer is up to you, depending on how high combat you want to be. The options are 26, 44, or 52. Typically to optimize for bh/pvp world pking you want as low prayer as possible, but it’s nice to have the chance to smite.
---
So you're currently hunting morytania only lucky implings and settled is just gonna have to compete? I see
---
You've got my wishes :)
---
If a mod stepped in to manually ban you, you were most likely involved in trying to lure players, which is considered scamming, and IS in fact against the rules.
---
You're also providing zero context, and I find it hard to believe that you happen to quit at the exact same moment that you received a ban, and didn't notice until 3 years later. There is clearly more to it, and you're intentionally leaving out information.
---
Grats on recovering your banned account, put it to good use.

I had b2b rune 2h at gargs while afk slaying. Both disappeared as I clicked the first. Disgusted with myself I went and showered for 23 and a half minutes. The thought of losing that alch exp nearly tipped me over the edge. That was 9 weeks ago. I've still not logged back on.
---
Elder maul is too slow, whip will out dps it easily
---
I mean that’s sort of subjective. The kills won’t be as good as possible but if it’s enough to satisfy you then sure go for it
---
Google "osrs dps calculator" and you'll see the bitterkoekje dps calculator spreadsheet in a reddit post. It is overwhelming at first but you basically just enter your gear/stats and select a monster and it will tell you the dps. It also lets you directly compare 2 full setups. It is a good idea to get familiar with this spreadsheet because nobody has the answers for every single combination of stats and gear available to you.
---
Oh god location is key. Jagex really shoved minigames into the middle of nowhere for F2P. I still remember LMS dying because no one knew how to get to it in F2P
---
again, if you look R E A L L Y hard you're gonna see me caring about end game items and content being harder to obtain\do. 
---
you have to look R E A L L Y hard though.
---
Late &gt; never
---
I don't understand your argument. OSRS is just RS2. Same playerbase for the most part as well. What was true back then would most likely be true for OSRS.
---
Pretty sure that’s exactly what I need, I’ll try when I’m home from work. Thanks so much!
---
ah right, I was under the impression that they were rolling back stats for both bugs, even though the attack style being automatically put to the attack option when logging in wasn't really a "bug", but when you're 1 attack 99 strength it's very easy to get a level or 2 quickly without realising unfortunately
---
Kill the ghouls by canifis, my KC was 1200 and I got it.
---
Depends on your ranged level
---
This may just be the coolest thing I've ever seen
---
I wish they would bring back these minigame SEASONALLY that way they wouldnt die so fast. One month FOG next month stealing creation next month bh crater ect ect. That way since its only there for a limited time interest doesnt die off to the point where you cannot play the minigame anymore Example : last man standing. Great minigame in my opionion could use some reward integrations make it seasonal and boom you got a thriving game.
---
ok too bad, I think thats worth it to have NMZ not look like my school project got put into runescape
---
Or we could just not add content to the game that require exploiting game mechanics.
---
AFAIK, the only thing that "requires" flicking atm is inferno. No reason to add more to the list.
---
Colourways on end game gear a possibility?  
---
i.e Ancestral, Justiciar, Armadyl. Obviously it then becomes an untradeable. But it'd be cool to have some sort of requirement to allow transformation. Gives a sense of achievement to stand out from the crowd.
---
Found the person who hasn't been to Castle Wars
---
Maybe get to 83 slayer then boost for whip
---
Im averaging 2:45 a kill with blow pipe or 2 minutes dhcb, though my stats aren't that high
---
Smoke staff, was before zeah lol.
---
I've always liked the idea of a minigame reward shop but I'm afraid I disagree with a lot of your base assumptions.
---
First of all, the NMZ shop makes no sense and should be removed, and most definitely should not be the basis of any new rewards shop.
---
The herb sack fits in here far worse than it fits in the Slayer shop. It is primarily a PvM item.
---
I like the idea of gambles to prevent farming and  rare clue scrolls seem to fit... although Master clues should never be rewarded and Elite clues need to remain difficult to obtain.
---
The cosmetics and skill cape looks pretty good, but I don't think there should be a pet.
---
Err all I used to do on OSRS was play minigames
---
52 imo
---
10/10. Nice work
---
Modern problems require modern solutions which cause modern problems which require modern solutions. Come on Jagex, we need ground items! We need RuneLite mobile! Fuck.
---
U didn't explain what pantheon is
---
I split my time between Soul Wars and Fist of Guthix. I loved both. Membership is too expensive for me to actually have fun anymore. Gotta focus on efficiency to pay for those bonds!
---
I am ranked like 300 or so in fog and have played more of it than virtually everyone on this subreddit, I loved it quite a lot. I can assure you if it comes to osrs I wouldn't play it after the first 3 days. The fundamental minigame problem of "if it doesn't have bis rewards nobody will play it" is still real and until we solve it, no other minigame suggestions make any sense.
---
The LMS changes would be perfect for people learning to actually PK. Granted you'd have to get used to using prayer restore potions in actual pvp/wilderness though. FoG is seen through rose-tinted glasses, honestly. It's a decade old minigame that wasn't about PVP because the idea of the game wasn't to fight back, it was to tank in the center while you spam clicked your bandages.
---
I know this question has probably been asked a lot, but as someone who just started playing OSRS, I really miss the graphics of "Runescape HD" from a decade ago. Is there any way we could get that option back? I know knew models would have to be made, but I would be willing to pay a lot of money.
---
I think you're correct.
---
Lmao everyone guessing what OP did wrong in this thread when he knows exactly what happened. You don't get manually permmed for nothing.
---
If you think this will help you learn pvp you've got some more runescape to play before you can even try learning lol
---
Could def have potential if mixed better.
---

---
&gt;It doesn't need to introduce the new version of void or anything.
---
It literally does though or nobody will play it.
---
I love how it twitches like the game, amazing job
---
1. Not needed but will cut kill time in half
---
2. 1 probably
---
3. Tele to lunar isle and get kicked off
---
Literally switched to private servers for a while, just to play soul wars.
---
They rolled my pure back as well! Congrats dude!

How many posters did you get to write this comment?

It's all clicking bro stop pretending like its skillful bahaha.

Im 1200kc and just now got my first mega rare... kodai

---
Just Curious - What is the rationale for having them have a 25% lifespan on the ground compared to other items?  I have always wondered why they would have done something so obviously frustrating to a skill that is obviously meant to be AFK.
---
They cannot remove it my man, its the game engine
---
It's kind of funny of this has existed for many many years and now suddenly people are making a big deal of it
---
I don't like prayer flicking, but I have no problem with it
---
No reason to not start now
---
He use to say
---
"Winner of the 2013 player design contest" until A bunch of SJW peasants and butthurt brutescapers that hate the fact that he got his context implemented ingame complained about him bragging.
---
you mean playing video games all night long, young man?
---
Depends, if a minigame offers a reward that speeds up a certain skill they don't like, they may prefer to spend 20 hours in the minigame and 20 hours on the skill, instead of 30 hours just on the skill. You lose efficiency and time overall but replace some of time training the skill you may hate with something more fun.
---
Find a niche appeal. Mr no sleep is a charisma bypass but I still watch every video he uploads
---
It will. I solo’d to 99fm at wt. as crazy as that sounds, I net over 33m. Efficiently it should take you 40 minutes to 13k points. No Phoenix pet though.... !Kc wintertodt: 400 something. Rngesus hasn’t been watching over me
---
Turn based RPG's, there's a bunch out there. Most you can play while you scape too.
---
Having a permanent "Burst of Strength" prayer is a larger DPS boost than getting the 2 extra strength bonus from upgrading legs and boots.
---
I was tired when I posted.
---
If they aren’t 2.2k total level then they allowed to talk to me.
---
I will do that. If I decide to go deep wildy pking with friends more I'll got 60. I also know 60(dscim) will make nmz faster but i dont feel its worth that with it being afk and im not in much of a rush to train it up
---
I'm depressed either way so might as well get them gains.
---
Get a trade. Decent mechanics make 30/hr if they work for a decent shop. Any haven't trade (mason, concrete, brick layer) can make 30/hr as well. Electric contractors of different levels can make up 60/hr, and if you are a very good general contractor you can easily ask for 70/hr. Wages are limited by skills, same as in osrs.
---
Yeah my thoughts exactly. Imagine how fulfilled he would feel if he spent that time at the gym or learning an instrument or something. Could be a master pianist by now or a shredded sick cunt. Runescape will always be here. @op don't waste so much of your potential or you'll regret it when you're in your mid 20s and have little to no skills outside of video games
---
&gt;People aren't suggesting solutions they think would work, they're just submitting 3 page long essays about why everything else wont work.
---
Because everyone has their own ideas on what a good design for a skill should be and that fundamentally is why no skill will ever pass a poll without compromises, and nobody wants a skill with compromises. GT clearly believes that a skill should be held up to a higher standard in 2019 than from a 2007 standpoint. I don't neccesarily agree with that, but what isn't debatable to me is to have no new skill than a bad new skill.
---
Just sayin
---
Thanks man! I’ll add all of these things to my word doc of goals to get onto. Currently my next goal is to grind out the remaining quest points I need to finally complete the final segment of RFD. Since finals are coming up soon I should have more free time afterwords, I plan to get back into slayer aswell. I just always found the skill super tedious lol.
---
99% of the time I do solos I can honestly say I’m dry asf
---
If you download it only get it from runelite.net, never get it from a dot Com site.
---
How long do you think?
---
Your next upgrades should probably be zenytes, especially anguish if you are doing lots of vork/zulrah/raids. Biggest dps gains for the price. 
---
Also I'd recommend you start saving for rigour, its expensive but hugely beneficial for all those bosses.
---
Takes like 73 crafting to make blue bodies
---
my notifier is buggy as fuckkkk. Granted I'm playing on 3 accounts at once, so thats probly the problem. It keeps notifying me that 'x-account' is going to be logged out from inactivity, but none of my accounts are inactive. It also tells me a birdnest has spawned like 20 minutes after it has long disappeared
---
I'm impressed with this project, team as the features are well spelt out with detailed documents to back up
---
Right? the whole quest was actually really good.
---
But to tell you the truth, he use to say something at one point, but I guess you could say that The SJW players tried to deplatform him out of jealousy, so jagex took away the text he announced after every lap. Even if this ain't the case, they probably won't add this, because it would gave been exactly the same thing, and annoy the players that were annoyed before by it. Lol
---
+1 wyrm bone looting
---
kbow the smaller mobs, crystal for magers and jad. You have plenty of bank value to kill jad.
---
Just sell all the melee stuff you don't need and buy a blowpipe. Once you've finished cave, just sell the bp and rebuy the melee stuff. Or...just keep it since it's opaf.
---
Stop posting this.
---
How do you know they don't use a heatmap already? And what exactly should they do with it?
---
I'm positive they could do something to prevent it from giving unlimited prayer if they wanted to.  They simply don't want to.  
---
The "skill" it requires really isn't much but is heavily ping dependent.
---
It's a problem not in function or usage but in the content design and existing stuff it invalidates.
---
Why have prayer bonus on gear or any way to restore prayer outside of shrines if we can all just indefinitely flick? Why have a quest where a reward is a wrench that restores prayer that I never run out of because I just flick? 
---
I don't want it removed and I do like seeing woox solo ridiculous stuff and think it's cool that players can achieve stuff like that through the skill of multiflicking. But content shouldn't be designed with it as a necessary mechanic to use to excel at as it was unintended.
---
By looking at the screen lol
---
Support. I remember being lv 80 and got matched with a lv 50. He couldn't hit me at all with his mapleshort bow and iron arrows aganist my full rune. Good times.
---
Wow it’s actually kinda disgusting to see someone waste their life like that
---
You get one prayer point back for each set of normal bones buried in catacombs.
---
I not arguing for it but I am just letting you know that it would very difficult and time consuming to do. Farming was a nightmare for them when they redid the whole tick system. They can’t change the base layer but only add to it so they would probably have to do the same thing with farming.
---
15m will definitely get you past 80 with oak planks
---
Yeah haha I'm not really splashing you're right but it's an attempt haha
---
I’m glad I am able to be a part of such a prestigious group ⚔️
---
I have a master clue sitting in my bank with 7 steps completed, and I need a Zamorak Helm for the last step. I **almost** lost it.
---
#F
---
😤😤 Sir, I think it is preposterous that you suggest I do my own reading 😤😤 I let you peasant underlings do that for me 😤😤
---
Plz, Don’t tell my mom
---
Man all I want is the spicy chicken but I'm at 400kc and only have the torch and top and a decent amount of burnt pages
---
Being mad cus you slave away at a shitjob isnt either
---
Should be removed
---
Well... You could file the edges and use it as a butt plug? Is that kind of practical?
---
If you have a buddy or two who play rs just use the same account for the site on several accounts.
---
damn thats depressing lol, I'm glad I slayed for profit, I really enjoy slayer though hah.
---
I think it's fine to admit you have that preference. But don't create a barrier to entry based on that preference that doesn't apply to the rest of the game and then pretend like it does or ignore all the areas that it falls apart. 
---
You say:
---
&gt;of course there are outliers. Not everything is a nice neat fit
---
And yet you're still applying the standards to a new skill. At that point, you're making up arguments that seem to fit your preference and trying to apply them to the rest of the game. 
---
Your argument that "the rest of the game is like X, so the new skill should be like X" is *fundamentally* flawed and you yourself admit it. 
---
Just come in and say "I would prefer a skill more like X". Don't pretend that the rest of the game fits the stereotype you think it does so you can pretend like warding doesn't fit when it clearly matches other parts of the game. 
---
Your standard of "a new skill should be perfect" will 100% prevent any new skill from entering the game. Runescape is not a perfect game, I hate to break it to you. There are fundamental balance issues. Things get released in unbalanced states. There are bugs. Not everything fits a singular core design concept. Despite all it's flaws, it's still a fun game.
---
I feel like this question gets asked once a week, but there isn't any way for your voice to be heard without posting. Is there any possible way to make mouse support for OSRS mobile? I'm trying to setup my Samsung Dex and play runescape but the clicks don't do anything. Any way to get it to work?
---
I can smell the drystreak that is around the corner
---
So all together are these websites good for making profit or nah
---
So what?
---
If anything I'd argue imbued rings are strong enough to warrant locking it behind a master quest
---
Same idea with nmz training, it's super top tier afk XP, why are there barely any reqs for it?
---
I got my tome on 7kc as well.
---
where do you change the valuable drop threshold?
---
Blursed
---
Just was never a fan I'm sure some people like it 🤷‍♂️
---
hop kid
---
What is happening tomorrow?
---
largelyposterioredladies
---
Just hop bro.
---
It is far more than double, since you get much more xp for hits than splashes and you’ll be hitting a lot
---
GUTHIIIIIIIIIX!!
---
You know what, you are not wrong?
---
That's my whole point tho. I do the same thing - I never pray flick because it's too much attention, but I think that games in general should reward you for paying more attention if you want to.
---
The entire game is built on a tick system. If we remove pray flicking then you should be in favor of removing 3t skilling or anything else that allows you to benefit from understanding and working with the tick system. In which case, you think we should simplify the game. Why? The presence of 3t skilling or pray flicking is not ruining the game in any way - pray pots/super restores remain valuable (if anything the value has been hurt from farming guild not from pray flicking) and lots and lots of people choose to not use tick-methods and are able to play and enjoy the game.
---
I hate you :(
---
imagine not listening to the amazing ingame music
---
he just released a few infographs. He was planning on also releasing a complete list on the day of release, which we have been waiting for for almost 3 weeks now.
---
I would first start by unlocking every fast teleport option in the game and disease free herb patches as well. 
---
Secondly, fruit trees can be done once a day and they slowly add up. I think if you did straight pineapples and calqauts for a year you could get like 14.5 mil or something like that. I wouldn’t go over Papayas on fruit trees because palm’s super expensive. 
---
Also add hardwoods to you runs every couple of days. 
---
They do accepted noted payments.
---
the 3 combats difference makes like no difference at all, and 60 att will give you a lot more variety. It's up to you though, and no at 78 combat there are barely any zerkers. Most zerkers are in the range of 85-99 combat
---
I mean why wouldn't it be? Always been against the rules.
---
"that's how things are" isn't a valid argument for why they should stay
---
Imbued rings were introduced into the game. They weren't from 2006.
---
So it hasn't "always been a thing", its something new for osrs that should have been rebalanced years ago. The fact that it hasn't been touched doesn't mean it shouldn't...
---
You have to have a high level thieving and steal it from the top of lumby castle.
---
Why? The inferno is one of if not the hardest piece of content in the game and flicking pray is a big part of it. It's a test of skill. Why make things easier/simpler?
---
Its incredibly high effort so why shouldn't the people putting in that effort be rewarded? You're probably sitting on 100k prayer pots or something like most people who post to beef or buff something.
---
4-5 hours.  100% worth it, arguably best offensive melle chest in the game after bandos.
---
Yeah the shorter name for them is zerker, they get the name from the berserker helm they wear which has a 45 defence requirement. Also they were solely P2P.
---
Awesome. I'm planning on putting my iron in NMZ while working on my main and that will really help.
---
Definitely don’t merch swordfish on the premise of it going back up after bots are banned. Anchovy pizzas and swordfish are the best f2p foods
---
Jamflex should issue an updated copy of a digital handbook once a month containing everything they have added, and replace the wiki
---
I think we have a new serene 
---
Shut up charlie sheen
---
I agree, good thing i didnt do just one run.
---
Stealing creation was the best mini game IMO mix of skills and lots of team work even if the rewards get nerfed I’d still love to play it
---
I’m down for Soul wars and stealing creation too!
---
Go do your ape shit m8
---
Oh no, what have I done!?
---
haha call the burn centre because /u/DppSky just FUCKED THAT GUY UP woop woop woop woop haha U S A U S A
---
I love this post. Congrats man! You'll love members content if you choose to join the rest of us.
---
It takes two minutes to bank and be exactly where you were for blue dragons, so there is no way you make more only doing bones.
---
The majority on this sub no longer complains about easyscape, they beg for it. People consistently demand nerfs for tick manip skilling and prayer flicking and every single proposed new skilling idea gets an overwhelmingly favorable reception here. I am not sure what changed in the last few years on this sub but people seem to just want to put as little effort as possible into this game.
---
I would agree except for the case of people with sub optimal internet, it becomes exponentially more difficult with more ping
---
😎 Gamers are the most oppressed minority 😎
---
It's one of the more coherent, well thought out arguments against warding. There's nothing foolish about it. It is common to read the more coherent arguments on either side of the issue in real elections.
---
I don't know why I'm arguing about this post with someone who didn't even bother reading the post.
---
Yup. Shit rng?
---
If you *really* want to clean out your bank play as an UIM.
---
Keep doing you bro.  Fuck the haters
---
Unfortunately, when the only metrics you use to compare are xp/hr and gp/hr that's just the way it works. It's content that's not fun or engaging outside of 'character progression', that's the problem.
---
&gt; At the beginning you state you’re going to attempt to be unbiased and present facts, yet you go on for page upon page of ‘why warding shouldn’t exist’
---
&gt; I'm going to stress now, while aiming to be as fair and analytical as possible, much of this will be steeped in opinion &amp; personal bias.  
---
I'll be talking about how I perceive the game &amp; what I think would best serve the game in the long run
---
Fack yeh bro congrats
---
If you can't spend 20 minutes reading a post, how will you spend countless hours getting 99 runecrafting?
---
Better yet “leaves thousands of runes on ground while doing slayer” 
---
“Complains that magic is too expensive to level”
---
I swear I haven’t played in months but I would see this all the time and pick up their runes. 200-500 earth dust fire etc runes and they wouldn’t pick em up. I had 127k fire runes last I checked and i didn’t buy them.
---
By freeing up the number of hours I spend with your mom
---
hey, nothing wrong with being a nerd, people have gone thousands of hours with no pet so getting one feels like quite the achievement.
---
Lava dragons are pked a lot. I would recommend blocking them unless you have both of the wildy agility shortcuts unlocked.
---
Mind sharing your block list? Not getting pked after 100 tasks is amazing.
---
I mean not really, lately they were all abusing the free membership promo
---
this whole season has been a letdown, but yeah this episode was spectacularly bad
---
Blast furnace worlds have the dwarves running the machinery instead of making you do it.
---
Ep 1 was good
---
Ep 2 was phenomenal.. one of the best in the show.
---
j1mmy's podcast was good. They kind of revolved around current RS events though, so listening to them again might not be as awesome. I tweeted at him the other day to see if he was going to continue but he didn't respond. I think he might have ditched it for the By Release series he is doing.
---
There's a difference between "more effort = more reward" and "more effort = infinite reward". Prayer flicking allows you to take no damage and maintain buff prayers indefinitely. 
---
If 3 ticking granite gave 13m xp/h it would be broken, despite needing "more effort". "More rewards" is too vague to determine whether something is broken or not. You have to quantify how much reward you're talking about.
---
70 AGILITY,   bro, 70.......
---
70... i have a 1500 total level, and its at 60, for regicide, and i still used summer pies.
---
remove the fang from the trident, reg trident is good enough for you and sell the fang for bolts/gear with the rcb.
---
blowpipe is easy in the caves, but if you don't know what you're doing in there it can also screw you over (range is very short, might get you into melee range at jad when tagging healers) or pull you away from the safespot when the NPC is out of range, making you take avoidable damage.
---
They’re weak arguments because this is a fantasy video game based in 2007. It’s not ‘Second Life’. Warding goes just as well with the theme of the game as magic, or prayer, or anything.
---
We’re slaying mythical monsters and demons and undead for fucks sake.
---
Saying that warding doesn’t belong and RC does because ‘the celts wrote with them’ makes no sense at all.
---
My issue was him posing the post as a discussion or unbiased and just spent the entire time saying how bad warding is.
---
What’s pathetic is that you responded to his comment and not mine with all of the issues you about my response lmao
---
steel titan spec your opponent while in the center.
---
I understand where you're coming from and I appreciate you taking the time to respond to me. I do disagree with you on a couple points. First though I feel I need to clarify that I'm not pushing for flicking to be removed or even changed tbh. I think it's a great tool for grinding out slayer tasks without taking a hit on your cash stack for ppots and should reward players willing to put the effort into doing it whereas lazier players or people who wanna afk pay the costs of ppots ect. And I do understand and find value in the argument that it does require skill for high end content and pvp.
---
Where I have to disagree however is that it doesnt hurt the nature of the game. Prayer in its development is buffs at the cost of a resource being prayer points. This is the nature of an integral skill in runescape. Prayer flicking is the abuse of an unintended mechanic that if done skillfully removes that cost and yields all the benefits. Additionally gear that provides bonuses to prayer and items that assist in prayer whether it's a SGS, ppot/restore, or holy wrench all harm the nature of their design. And this is my issue.
---
The solution like I said in my post is acknowledging that flicking is like you said part of runescape at this point but to develop content that promotes the benefits of the intended nature of prayer and the content that currently exists to be used for high end content to promote more creative design and gameplay. There's got to be middle ground with good discussion or Jagex could fuck up and ruin it for everyone.
---
But 🅱️UNECRAFT 🅱️AD
---
"96 is the last level" isn't true. It depends on your strength bonus as well.
---
Nothing wrong with the argument at all my issue was with your dumbass statement that ppl had to read this in order to vote
---
slayer good
---
do your best to max your melees, finding a team will be hard enough as is. dhcb is useless. You'll need a spec wep such as crystal halberd or dragon claws. You'll need a defense lowering weapon, bgs or dwarhammer.
---
Jagex is owned by a Chinese company. BTW
---
You carried a stone if you're the target, with bandages and a one time teleport into the center. Four safe houses in the middle that you can enter but took dmg passively. Survive as long as possible. 
---
Hunter just went to go kill the asap.
---
I still remember the tactic of running to the middle to get some points, running to the outer rim when the guy hunting you finds you and then porting to the center again for more gains.
---
If you're only giving one an hour obviously you aren't very talented
---
Bro your best bet is google wedoraids. A big discord group. Highly organised in providing mentors to assist you with first few kcs. After that you can find people on their discord who have similar experience.
---
The fact that it is so organised over on discord makes it much easier to find teams, find answers to questions. 
---
Google -&gt; their website, find the discord link -&gt; join discord and they have a whole automated process to get you started.
---
I tested this a few minutes ago and here are my results
---
* It took about a minute to do the four birdhouses.  I do redwoods, so it's about 4,800 xp/minute
---
* It took approximately five minutes (about 295 seconds) to do all nine herb patches, from which I received 90 herbs (I set my pb for a single patch during this trip -- 22 from Troll Stronghold).  I traveled to the farming patches the fastest way possible and 1.5t harvested each plant, with the exception of the catherby patch (I ran from the camelot teleport).  I was lucky because on average a person can expect to receive around 80 herbs per 9 patch trip with farming cape, elite diaries, ultracompost, and magic secateurs.  Setting the xp gained from planting and harvesting equal (they're roughly equivalent), that yields 89 plant/harvest actions per 5 minutes, or about 17.8 actions per minute.  To get that equal to 4,800 exp, the harvest/plant exp must be around 270, which is 20% more than torstols
---
The most obvious thing that stands out to me is that the majority of farm runs are probably not being done with torstols or dwarf weeds.  In my case, and judging by your flair I'm assuming yours as well, these runs are most frequently done with something like irits, which would make the comparison pretty lopsided in favor of birdhouses, considering the ease at which birdhouse supplies can be obtained
---
and have our trebuchets outside of the walls. and not have burning oil or anything on the walls. and also lets make a flaming trench, but not light it when the hordes run in so we can launch stuff at them and funnel them into choke points, but instead stand in front of it and light it after we all are dead.
---
none of it made sense
---
Wait am I missing something?
---
you say that but when your drystreak is broken by an arcane
---
I have the sudden urge to play cod4..

Jagex already knew runners could be used at lavas. The problem with ZMI is that they polled it at a certain exp rate and using runners circumvents that exp rate.

$20 an hour is $41600 a year. The median household income in the US is like $56000 (now granted many of those households have more than 1 person working). Outside of retail and service industries these wages are pretty common though if you know what to look for.

Dudeee that’s TOTALLY why I played it!!

I love how your flair is UIM and you’re giving tips on banking.

Ohhh yeah that makes a lot of sense. I dunno why I always assumed it meant the berserker shield and not the helm.
---
My guess is that a bunch of people decided to buy the item.
---
Generally try to keep strength 5 or 10 levels above attack and defense. Strength increases your max hit which means more exp.
---
i guess we can agree to disagree
---
I think it works great for certain skills, others such as runecrafting and woodcutting etc. the method for fastest xp doesn't change after a low level. (IE teaks and lava runes). I'm not sure if they intentionally knew that some of the low level unlocks would be the fastest xp.

Dammit I just posted this too lol

it's not like he started playing one year ago from scratch, nobody starting from 0gp will have near enough money to have all that gear. he either has a main or he came from rs3 and swapped a good amount of gp

Prayer flicking, along with other tick manipulation, is a skill. Not just anyone can do it, and even people that have practiced for years mess up every so often. Its an unintended game mechanic that allows for extremely difficult end game content to be created, and still be challenging. Without prayer flicking I would argue the infernos difficulty would be near impossible. No lazy or 1 tick flicking would make the inferno almost unattainable, without the realease of things like prayer enhance potions outside of chambers, which would ruin the game, giving people the effect of prayer flicking without having to do anything. 
---
In my opinion, people that play this game that are against tick manipulation of any type, be it skilling, tick eating, tick walking, full gear switches, or prayer flicking, simply cant do the tick manipulation effectively, and are mad at other players that have put in many more hours than themselves. 
---
Just because you cant tick manipulate doesnt mean nobody should be allowed to.
---
and get banned

I think it was a good example, but may have slightly disproved your point. To jump off of GentleTractor's "skills as professions" point, there really isnt someone whos profession it is to light fires. Although, you could say that a woodsman/lumberjack would be lighting fires on occasion. Its not a skill that takes years of perfecting. Its something that maybe should not have been a skill to begin with.
---
In the case of mining and smithing, you wouldn't expect a blacksmith to also spend his time going out to mine the stuff hes smithing with. They are two professions, usually separate from one another.
---
Now in the realm of fantasy, its not that easy to make distinctions because we don't have any frame of reference on what a Runecrafter's profession would entail. Maybe it would be the case of mining and smithing, where people that make the runes arent necessarily the ones making the armor. It could be a menial job in the world of magic users, or it could be a serious skill that only masters can channel runic essence into items when they get proficient. Thats the wonderful thing about fantasy, we get to decide how fantastical elements interact and operate.
---
Unfortunately this creates a difficult situation for the playerbase to vote on. Because some will see the game as it is and always has been, with resource gathering skills and crafting skills separated. Instead we can look at how the game could be, and not follow in the footsteps of Runescape Devs past, we dont need every skill to have a 1:1 crafting equivalent.
---
Hell, we also have fletching as another supplementary crafting skill. Why doesn't mining have something like that? We can go on and on making comparisons to other parts of the game, but in reality we should just be focusing on making a new skill that we all like playing.
---
thanks
---
You totally did
---
There are better ways to put it though.  More like, 'where do you find time to spend with friends?'  Still to the point, but more approachable.

There's nothing wrong with using inventory slots. It's not even QoL that's a major change.
---
I made teletabs to 85 on my alt
---
Thats the trade off. Its super high effort and click intensive, and takes practice. Just because you cant tick manipulate doesnt mean it should be removed from the game
---
Hmm, okay then, thanks for your input.
---
Was your bank pin off when you logged in, or did you still enter it? When was the last time you logged in and used your pin?

This. Went from like 88-98 magic while doing bursting on optimal tasks from like 87-99 slayer

takes 7 days to remove it, and you must have not noticed it until then. they probably patiently waited and you didnt notice.

Motherlode mine. I never worry about XP rates. Just do some invents and chill
---
It seems like much more of a pain then it actually is. If you do the best trees you can, you will be lvl 70 in a couple of days. Throw some herb runs in as well and lvl 80 can be done in like a week or 2
---
Oh yeah, you will have no problem catching them at the lowest level they require
---
Ironman dung can be a drag but I got it to 88 and it wasn’t the worst thing. Pushing for the tokens was pretty garbage. I never focus on the levels, it’s always about getting a certain item so that’s what makes the grinds suck. I’m not trying to get 88-89, I’m trying to get 3 million exp for another set of chaotic, or etc.
---
For me it was the other way around, pray mage then switch to range if he uses it. Both attacks had goes into the air for a second, with mage he stays up and with range he slams the ground, I kept fucking up cause I would switch to mage when he started the range animation, then he would slam the ground and I panicked, but if I kept pray mage up then switched to pray range if he slammed the ground I beat him the first time I tried this and it was smooth sailing

Playing an instrument is an extremely fun hobby. It's definitely not a career but people are generally very impressed if you're capable of playing an instrument at a high skill level.

Nice info thanks. Do you have a vid of you forming such conga line? I'm on my 1st attempt right now (wave 30) but I'm using the long rock safespot because of the guide I saw. Just chilling a bit waiting for special attack energy
---
I'd argue caution with regards to learning an instrument as part of the school band however.  That seems to be the most cultish group in school I've had the displeasure of interacting with.
---
If you aren't a conformist or athlete, you're not welcome in band.  YMMV.
---
Pink phone case and the jeans?

You mad lad
---
I like that idea, they might have to change around some drops for monsters but talismans are so useless. If we made them components in creating armor, then it would be assumed that this armor would be much harder to spam for xp because of the rarity of talismans.
---
He beat the game. Time for him to move on.

Jesus guys.. he didn’t say it would be easy. In fact I think he’s saying that someone who runecrafts 100k plus nature runes will then give them to all of us so we can go Alch yourself.

Why would you ever kill them if you're farming points lol

no one was aware of tick manipulation in 07.

Like 70 said go loot wyrm bones.  Would probably be the faster way.
---
To answer your question directly go for it man.  Getting 43, or even 50 prayer from your own drops, and picking up others bone drops is totally do-able and worth for those early prayer levels.

Bones 2 peaches will offer you plenty of healing

---
Technically probably not but you have a much wider margin of possibility. With dhcb, a 48 second kill is the last shot before he enters the second special attack. So if he does acid first then that's 3 extra shots of half damage, effectively 1.5 extra shots if you're wooxwalking. So it's 13 full damage shots without wooxwalk, and another 1.5 with wooxwalk. That's a noticeable chunk of the damage potential, lowers your average hit required by a chunk.
---
Just 30-99 smithing on cannonballs then 1-99 Runecrafting on combat runes, then do 1-99 slayer. EZ.
---
Thanks for the red circle, I was struggling to find the joke

Meh tbh, F2P does need updates and Jagex doesn't need to heed the furrow headed noobs who go 'no updates for F2P' they are inbred scum

This is why we have algebra in school, folks.

Yeah just look at a guide on youtube so you've got some idea what's going on, then head on over, find a team asking for a specific role, and let them know you're willing to try it out.
---
I loved this minigame, but it made magic training way too easy. Introduce this minigame but nerf the magic exp maybe?

Can always do superheat and get smithing exp as well

Ok dad

See, it's completely unreasonable to have someone to require max gear (included a twisted bow or something) just to complete a content the PROPER WAY without any illegitimate tactic.

Meanwhile lazy flickers or tick flickers can complete it with 52 prayer and a rune crossbow all because of a unintended mechanism.

If you don't wanna waste hours of your life doing something for no reason reason then that's on you. I like having my time so I like to be at least a little efficient.

This is just, awful. I just see all of the wasted hours of your life for not using any str boosting gear or anything... I value my time in my life, I tend to be o not want to waste it when I can be alot more efficient with very minimal effort on my part.

I never want to kill a rock lobster or waterfiend again :(

I can, but it should be removed.

Actually in this case it would be what it's for. Their comment is only barely related to the conversation at hand. He's butting in during a conversation about art with a QoL suggestion, so they're off topic and not contributing.
---
Unstable connection runs are for nothing though
---
From what I have seen, for whatever reason people get lucky their first 25-50 chests. everyone I know had great luck, about 5-7 peices. then after that it becomes more reasonable. i'm excited to do barrows in my hardcore to see if it plays out.
---
should of paid attention in math class. but they didnt teach us 92 is half of 99
---
&gt; Ummm except this already basically exists?

Lol no it doesn't. If you can eat a shark to heal 20 hp and somehow retrieve the shark it would be a exploit. This is the case with prayer exploit.

Just do slayer without a cannon and the money will add up, also, farming pays for itself. You really don’t need much money at all at your levels

Let's put this to a poll.  Would be a great addition to osrs

How’d u do the 99 alt?
---
bet 50k it will. send me rsn noob
---
I'll give you three fiddy
---
Sending pots and prayers to you and your family
---
ay man, no problem sir, i gotchu! always!
---
Maybe if you stand and facetank zilyana. Should get much more than 3 kills
---
Either 0 or 65+.
---
The results on the website count skips, but that's wrong, and has never been fixed. Check the poll booths in-game for the actual results
---
the rune gauntlet grind was so fun
---
eat them with some fava beans and a nice Chianti f-f-f-f-f-f-f
---
Is 3 mil decent to start farming and slowly getting money to add up? And you're right about the cannons, I think it's time to put that away until I start making some good money.
---
Lamps and bonus xp.
---
Farming Guild bank in the highest tier.
---
Dumb question but how do I view this log? I started last night and would like to see that

Get ur con and herb to 82 asap! Theres no overusage of your prayer when you learn. Try different gear setups what works for you. Learn the rotations.
---
I'm alright thanks, just leave nmz how it is

Since you're 85 rc, put it on agility.

---
You're assuming that people that want a new skill can be swayed, but people that don't will not be swayed. I would bet that some of these never want a new skill people would vote yes if the suggested skill was good enough. All having a poll like that would do is let people point fingers at a statistic when talks about a new skill start up. 
---
Just to throw in my opinion I don't see a problem with you throwing in your ideas, but people do hold you in high regard and I'm willing to bet that you making a post like this about a close update would swing it one way or the other. I'd just be aware of that.
---
Gz
---
If memory serves you can just search a crate or something near the arma area in gwd and get one for free
---
Looks like it’s basically a looting bag for pvp stuff that you can give to friends/alts, but not use yourself.
---
Why herb to 92?
---
Uhhhhhh technically due to the taper of the glass it's actually less than halfway, and therefore this cutenoob isn't even level 92. Pft, pathetic.
---
ahhhh, okay... Thank you! Sorry for being a douche.

No info on  **Pollnivneach**
---
Make a new account. You’ve used up all the rng on this one
---
yeah true that’s a good idea actually
---
Emmm I'm not 100% on this but get yourself a ruby necklace and enchant it. Should turn it into a digsite pendant since you've already gotten one
---
Still really impressive! A lot of people who do it at 85 combat are very close to the same stats as you, so don't act like having it done at 86 isn't impressive. 85 was my goal but got so distracted I ended up not getting it til a couple weeks ago at 96 combat. Either way props to you my dude, keep it going!
---
How? Theres no context at all
---
Oh yeah. I must have skimmed over that.
---
Can't you enchant a Ruby necklace after you get the first one...?
---
You are going to need more then a music doctor for what you are about to experience.
---
You can boost 87 herb to make anti venom. Those used for the best pool in the poh to restore all stats/specbar/health. (Im thinking as an ironman btw)
---
prolly because easter eggs are in abundance right now.
---
Once you get it you should be able to enchant your own no?
---
I think after you get the first one you craft the rest? Could be wrong
---
Damn that hoe.
---
I never talked to the guy about enchanting it though. I will try this, thanks!!!
---
Wow thank you for your reply! Very insightful. Are beginner/medium worth doing or should I stick to hard clue scrolls?
---
normal running has 2+ accounts constantly running inventories of 40+ essence to the person paying the runners. if you kill a player, you see their loot for one minute, then everyone sees their loot for an additional one minute.
---
additionally:
---
* picking up essence of the ground at 1 essence/tick takes far longer than just trading someone for it
---
* if you're killing runners that wastes time too, even if its not much
---
* runners can't use rune pouches if they die, reducing the amount of essence they can bring
---
* it takes 20 runes of any type to use the ZMI bank. runners would need to get runes from the bank and teleport back to ZMI, wasting even more time.
---
* someone can simply come in and grief the runners, ruining the whole thing.
---
in summary, it's just not viable
---
Looks like almost say Agi. Anyone done Ardy on mobile/iPad? Curious how it is.
---
That's a bad idea. Jagex won't go through all the effort to make a proposal and graphics for a new skill if they're internal data indicated that there's no way it would pass. Plus I'm willing to bet theres a significant amount of people that say that they would never want a new skill, but would vote yes to one if it was good enough. All a poll like that would do is let players point fingers at a poll instead of having discussion.
---
Also they completely neglect that you’ll never be fully potted 247 so 96 str quickly becomes not the max hit whereas 99 gives you a bigger buffer
---
So you did p2p from 60-99?
---
Yeah could be good! I need more xp than 13.5m fletching :D
---
Dude, I panicked in Dragon Slayer
---
I bet he vapes too.
---
Go for hard level completion of all diaries, makes a nice goal and has great rewards
---
I’m a meme as well and I did seers to 90.
---
75 smithing is extremely easy if you just do gold ore via blast furnace..
---
Also I never made my laws, just buy them. I usually bought around 2k at a time which was nice to see them dwindle down. Made the goal a lot more chill and relax.
---
Bobby B gave us a false sense of security. Open field didn’t mean shit

No problem. Fingers crossed it works for you!

Its nooby because you wear it and don't know how to take a screenshot.

The osrs team and the website team are separate entities, the website team isn't bound by polls or really even that strictly tied to osrs.

I have started the killing of 1k "Anja" it should take about 4-5 hours killing her that many times as there is only 1 spawn, every 14 seconds.

OMG IT WORKED THANKS!!! i feel dumb but back to ds2!!!!

omg nostalgia

This is way to far fetched for me. The game mode isn't  "Ironmen can't trade or pick up items unless they store it in this special pouch that then allows them to trade the contents to other players but not use it themselves"
---
DIS ITH BULLTHIT!!
---
thats nice, on a personal account i got 3 magma mutys in about 75 kills.
---
Hmm Is the Combat timer 10 seconds? Would save you about 4000 seconds, which is over an hour, but make it way more annoying
---
DM me your username and I'll add you. Can spam me with all your questions in game
---
You can still enjoy summoning on rs3, their is no way it comes back to osrs, personally I'd probably quit if it did. It was a terrible update that reshaped the meta literally everywhere in the game. Ruined the combat level formula. And complety destroyed pking on many different levels
---
Please send me the .stl files!!!!
---
This is how the game is meant to be played. Having fun your own way and goofing around or training afk on the side of another thing to relax. Not being some lonely tick perfect weirdo who roasts people on Reddit for not being 100% efficient.
---
Inb4: “but what if people enjoy playing the game in a super boring and self-destructive way”

get a real hobby and see a therapist you weirdos

Can i get that 4 for $4 pls
---
You stop failing seers at 79 and rellekka at 89 I think, so I'd imagine Pollnivneach is roughly 84-85
---
I’ll play the game regardless of them leaving flicking or removing it (I’d prefer them leave it as is even though I can’t do it properly lol). I honestly can’t imagine them going to 30k each though. Do that many people flick while they pvm? I flick piety here and there but not enough to bring prayer potions lol
---
I saw you training there yesterday! Gratz!
---
Can confirm
---
It's just like throwing out the phrases "unintended mechanic," "exploit," "clever use of game mechanics," or "intended methods" without proper context. Sure, if a line of code leads to something extremely detrimental that crashes the economy or lowers the difficulty of an encounter, then it probably ought to be patched out. But, many games have found quirky mechanics to be interesting and positive to keep in, and even become core parts of the game that increases skill and interest in the game.
---
He's not streaming, I can't tell if you are memeing or not.
---
Bots and jagex should be switched around.
---
This is flat out wrong. Literally they could have manipulated any poll with results shown.
---
Nezy helm, Barrow gloves, medium to hard diary’s, and other “worth while quests”. 
---
You can lookup lists of important quests with tasty rewards. Theoatrix has a YouTube video about good quests to get done ASAP / good reward. 
---
Those should give you plenty to aim for. Will require different skills to be leveled along the way.
---
Yes. After 99 it's free 500k an hour, no bonds needed.

I've got the money that I'm willing to risk what I am willing to risk man. I don't just hand out shit to people I don't know. But I also play with adults who value their friendships over their in game banks. Maybe I'll get burned one day, but the likelyhood of that is pretty small considering I tend to be a decent judge of character.
---
Omg 91 slay w no cannon sir I admire you
---
Big gz! enjoy!
---
I logged in immediately after the update, and had auto retaliate on. My attack style was changed from the update. When I noticed I had already gained levels. In a panic I quickly switched to aggressive and still was gaining attack xp and it went to 5 attack. Then I tabbed out of fossil island. So yeah, it definitely was a bug. If it wasn’t, then why would Jagex deploy a hotfix?
---
Anything below like 92 STR/HP (or 94? depends on bosses etc) you should use the Obby setup.

Did you even read what I said

I went to the official runescape page and checked out my account status and settings and everything looks normal... but why did I get this email.

Im confused, what do you mean "cant attack back"? Is your mouse broken?
---
Oh you mean the fact someone CHOSE to come into a PvP area with nothing at all and completely unprepared and therefore handicapped themselves a massive amount? This victim attitude where youre somehow literally unable to do anything about being attacked through no fault of your own is some of the most insanely pathetic (and wrong) logic I see complained about on here about PvP ALL the time. You have every single chance to be able to fight back if you actually come prepared for a PvP encounter when knowingly entering a PvP area, you cant complain however when you deliberately choose to bring absolutely nothing to defend yourself with.
---
How do i get added by this beast
---
Depends what you want to do. 3D modelling can be pretty damn hard to learn, but just printing 3D objects someone else has already created is easy as pie
---
You don’t see untrimmed Attack capes too often in this game! Gz man 😊
---
dh is only bis for nmz after you have 89 str and 89 hp. Thats when you can take full advantage of the way it works. and then you have to keep your hp at 1 so it isn't afk really at all. Your best bet will still be full obby with sword and b neck

Risking 2b is nowhere near comparable to risking 1000s of hours. And they are also prepared to make that risk. They also have escape plans already known

The % is figurative god bless. Im sure at least one person has purposely risked 1000 hours so i didnt use 1000. No one in frontline has risked 1000 hours when they pk 1v1.

I was.  I just ran out of about 40 maple yews calwuats and orange trees.  I've started bird house runs again.  Right now I was cycling through 80 ranaar 50 snaps and 75 irits.  Plus all the poison ivy bushes and any cactus I had.

Yeah I mentioned melee is completely free under the context that you don't use supplies to enhance your power. Super sets are always worth it in my opinion.

I think it goes back to free torvesta?

Memes aside how the fuck do people stay at revs for longer than 5 minutes?  Me, and a buddy tried for about half an hour.  We'd get maybe 3-5 kills before having to seed pod out because a clan logged in.  We finally decided to never try revs again because it's such a pain in the ass.
---
At 99 attack and strength probably.
---
At 50 attack and strength probably not.
---
Seriously? That makes it seem really quick, thinking on how fast I go through cannonballs.
---
Maybe I’ll give it another go
---
Man I read down this far hoping you would be able to articulate why they are bad examples. I thought it was a nice little aside obviously just showing that it existed.
---
So I guess to come back full circle here. We (you, me, GT, and many others)  agree that the battle wards and summoning are bad.
---
My question is this: Does the current steps for making magical armor make sense given what we already know about equipment?

 I know this is a fantasy game, but seriously think about this. In fantasy it is known that potions are just things mixed together and maybe brewed. It is known that magical items can be either made from magic or imbued with magic. These all make sense are are reflected in RS. Its part of fantasy. Even prayers make sense in a way. Praying to the gods for a blessing and being given the power of gods albeit briefly.
---
Does the current warding steps make sense for making magic gear? Does it make sense? Not just in a game sense, but in a fantasy sense. Is it consistent enough with general fantasy rules that someone can understand the idea of it right away? I do not think so in its current form. Its confusing.
---
I agree with a lot of your points. Warding has too much going on, it's like Crafting v2, with another skill or two on top. Battle wards don't belong. I wouldn't advocate for making Runecrafting as bloated as Crafting, and I'm not sure dissolving is a "mandatory item sink that punished players". I could see runecrafting as the woodcutting skill, where its products get used in both firemaking (magic) and fletching (warding). Or maybe mining, where the products are used in smithing, crafting (gold, silver, gems), and fletching. 
---
Your argument about getting back free bars makes some sense as an ironman or UIM, since now you've got a use for plate, 2h, and bows besides alching, but a mainscape player is going to be buying huge stacks of platebodies from the GE, and probably selling the bars back, or, if vis is tradable, they'll just buy the vis. I'm not saying dissolving as it's currently proposed is perfect, but I'm not sure it'd have as detrimental an effect as what you think. 
---
The idea of adding another set of magical nexii/laylines/altars/obelisks isn't new. Classic had Obelisks for making orbs of fire, then Runecrafting came along and made Rune Alters pop up all over. That said, I don't think we really need another set. Using the runecrafting, the orb-charging, or the mysterious unused ones (north of fally, west of Barb Village) should be fine. 
---
In any case, moving the dissolving/vis generation over to runecrafting is an interesting idea. I could see running inventories full of platebodies to an alter, then converting it into a stack of vis. Fabrics come from farming (maybe with some crafting to weave them), vis comes from smithing etc with runecrafting to prep it. 
---
Personally, I think having a slower non-combat magic skill is a good idea, and overloading runecrafting with making magic armor make sense. I might consider moving alching, enchanting, and transforming to the newMagic skill. (That said, maybe not, because half of Lunar magic is transforming logs into planks or hide into leather etc.) I see herblore as a fantastical skill more than a medieval one, it's not simple medicine if it involves eyes of newt or unicorn horn powder. I think imbuing rings and robes with magical power is different enough from striking with blood, ice, or fire and teleporting that it can be its own skill. 
---
Maybe call it Spellweaving, so it makes more sense as a slower and more permanent magic method. Instead of hurting or moving a person, it's about changing the properties of a material, object, or garment. Every imbue, enchant, or empower from the skill should take several ticks, and maybe a ritual, like how charging orbs takes walking the place of power and each orb take over a second to charge.

There is a big difference between your playstyle and a straight up thinking error. Enjoyment and efficiency usually are completely separate, it's just a lack of gameknowledge and logical thinking.
---
And holy wrench
---
I guess I misunderstood your comments and the driving force behind them. I agree with you on pretty much everything. I just don't like the steps that were proposed and for specific reasons I have listed.
---
&gt; Why does runecrafting need essense or pure essense or dark essense, and talismans, and tiaras, and altars just to make runes?
---
I think looking at other skills is exactly what I do not want to talk about. Runecrafting is using essence and making a runes. At its base form is just essence to an altar and imbue them with that rune. Its simple. The talismans are for access. Everything else was added later when it made sense. I do not think warding as was proposed is simple like that. Its complicated already before we even get to see things added later...
---
But that is all what I do not want to talk about. Looking at other old flawed skills is not what I wanted. I realize we both want the content. I just wanted to know what about the implementation of training the skill made sense to you. How you make sense of it. I still don't get it at all as do many of my friends. We all are hoping it will just make more sense next blogpost. I am asking you, as someone who seems to be defending warding in its current state, minus the combat stuff, can you explain it?
---
Pretty sure you’ve never played an iron, but whenever you try to pick up loot that isn’t yours a message appears in the chat box saying that you cant
---
I did skip quite a few tasks to get more burst/barraging tasks so I could maximize exp.
---
Definitely will, thanks.
---
I dont know how the skilling community would feel but lots of communities have a meta that they dont like changing, on the other hand they might see it as a positive. Of course 10hp players would like that but everyone would create a 10hp rusher if they could pick up drops and were easy to make and could buy claws/ags, it would ruin pking. It wouldnt  be necessary of course but it might show new players how to build pkers

i work anywhere from 40-60 hours a week, thankfully its only 40 minutes a day in travel time.  i can get about 5-6 hours in each day, i also only sleep 5 hours each day.  Granted not everyone is okay with that amount of sleep, do what is healthy and good for yourself, it is just a game.
---
No ads for a first.
---
Yeah I mean its not that hard, you just actually have to pay attention and come prepared and know how to tank/ or anti PK and avoid multi as much as you can. Its sad because most people rather complain about the wilderness and act like they can do nothing, when the reality is they cant do anything about being pked because they have absolutely no clue how to tank or fight back (and you can easily tank a lot of pkers, plenty who arent very good are very easy to tank) and most of all...come completely unprepared. Im not sure how people can complain about getting pked if they go deep wildy to do a task and all they bring is some initiate and a few pray pots and then some food and also have no idea how to pray switch and tank. I usually bring either hides/karils and a Dinhs and sometimes anti gear like MSB+AGS for wildy slayer and then extra brews and shit and its easy as hell to tank or kill some people. Only times ive ever died doing wildy slayer were times when I was anti pking with decent risk and risked some hp and being semi afk. 
---
But hey people rather complain about PvP and just completely avoid it, when all they have to do is spend a short time learning and actually coming prepared and theyd vastly increase their chances of living and learn you dont really need to be scared if you have any clue what youre doing.

I think burning crusade or wrath is where they could run osrs style at where the game was at its peak I believe wrath was player count peak and most people nostalgia to. But I agree. If they went to an older expansion and learned from their mistakes they’d be unstoppable.

Lots of people had the same idea.  Here's one from even earlier.

Which is not a fraction even though we often treat it as one.
---
I remember trying to play on my base 40's f2p account, it did not work at all
---
I understand the comments about me explaining why. That’s why I made the point that some people aren’t that great at articulating what they’re thinking.
---
I just think the skills in their current state do not draw parallels to real life nearly as much as he made it seem. Some of them, sure (fishing, woodcutting). Things like runecrafting, slayer, and magic, have no parallel. Yet they are all (well..) great skills.
---
Personally I do think the idea of a skill that creates magical armor, imbues, and weapons does fill a void. Things like xerician, the RC boots/stones, and NMZ imbues only exist as they are because they had to shove them somewhere.
---
Then I have no idea why ‘items an iron can’t pick up’ confused you.
---
sorry i was seeing someone elses comments defending the same argument and assumed it was you!
---
Yeah no need to get offended, it just sounds low for 5 million downloads on mobile and however many on PC to me. I’m not stating a fact.

Attack was my original first 99. Was great for pking since I had 94 magic. Could hit low but quite often.

You can map some functionality you want to AHK keybinds but it needs to be 1:1 (one key per AHK action). You can also bind the interface tabs to Function keys (F-keys) in the vanilla client. This makes it easy to swap between your prayer book &amp; inventory.
---
&gt; And normally you bring x2 range pots? At what waves do you normally use these at?
---
1-2 Range pots. I would first reserve ~3 doses for the final waves &amp; jad. I would start using range potions once you are dealing with both the ranger &amp; melee minions (wave 22+). When to re-boost range:
---
- You lost minor health and don't need prayer points: Sip a brew dose and then a ranging potion dose.
---
- You lost major health: 3 sips of brew doses -&gt; 1 super restore dose -&gt; 1 ranging potion dose
---
- Your boosted range level is getting low or a dangerous wave is about to spawn (e.g. wave 45).

And definitions aren't universal. A game can still have a small following and be considered dead by most.

They’re super easy to buy under market value because people just dump them from doing vork and not many people buy the unf bolts because they don’t know how good they are. When I did it, ge tracker showed a small loss as well and I still made 10-40gp per bolt.

HAI AND WELCOME TO MY GUIDE!
---
Get adjusted to uncomfortable flicking situations (Melee+Mage/Range+Blob). If you can do that, "shit spawns" wont be much of a problem. Minimize the amount you drink by blood barraging and only sip when you truly need. You dont need to brew to 99, brewing to 60 to survive a potential range hit is just fine.

Stealing creation!!!

Im about 155kc atm. Youve had 3 more purples than me.

I got a tbow split on 148kc, and a elder maul (same table as bow) around 80ish.

So like a Skyrim type inventory?

No its not, tha'st normal spell book entangle spells that get halved with pray mage activated.

---
And if someone is willing to put in more effort and gp, they still shouldn’t be able to get faster afk xp rates. This whole thing is dumb af and didn’t need to be changed at all. You’re paying nearly 12m/hour to achieve 160-180k xp/hr. If you wanna pay 70gp/xp, the increased xp/hr is fully deserved.
---
From the altscape point of views, you’re using 5 accounts (which alone could get 45k xp/hr each) to get 180 on a single account. 5x45=235. You’re actually getting less total xp/hr by consolidating the xp onto one account.

If you have barrage(or entangle) for tunnel in case you get dh is nice

Of course you only use like 1(maybe 2 if u wanna do verac) per run. And trident the rest. The last time I brought this up everyone assumed I meant to only use barrage for your main DPS spell.

This is like those movie drinking games where they are trying to be super clever but realistically you'd be so shit faced that you couldn't play out a full Q&amp;A of the game.

Stealing creation was the best. You can enjoy it for combat or for skilling, or by being a troll and stealing peoples runes while they fight. Good times all around, would love to see these games come back. Sc would need new rewards though, doubt people will be ok with double xp items these days.
---
That’ll be $11

"The process of safespotting is game breaking. The point of having health points is because fighting monsters should have an inherent cost. However, due to safespotting, it's possible to go hours without spending a single health point because there's a small rock you can run around."
---
You say that prayer should have an inherent cost, but why? Shouldn't higher effort methods be rewarded proportionately?

My Only Hot-Take Additions
---
* Create Robes (unf) with crafting...finish Robes with "imbuing" (concept from the post)  \[Concerns: Warding: Robe Creation -&gt; transition crafting/runecrafting\]
---
   * Does this conflict with Xerican? I don't believe so. The Warding focus was on higher level gear (mystics)
---
   * No Magic level involved keeps the crafting non-combat based 
---
   * Maintains crafting role...interlinks core skills, and adds more steps  - these could be negative OR positive 
---
* Re-Examine "Summoning" options as non-combat and as part of an expansion to Arceus Spells \[Concerns Warding: In-Combat Summoning -&gt;  transitionMagic\]
---
   * Not an argument for Summoning or easyScape. But Arceus has the potential to modify the way some skills are trained already (e.g, prayer)...this could provide an opportunity to expand on this in a different way...

I'd argue those unintended mechanics ad more depth to the game
---
I mean look at games like ssbm, half the reason it's still being played today is because of all the unintended mechanics are used to push the game to it's limits.
---
Less depth in this already pretty shallow game(it's a point and click game) is a bad thing imo.
