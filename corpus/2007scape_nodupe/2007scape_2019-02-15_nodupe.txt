I would recommend going to your settings (the wrench) and going to the analog stick and turning off your attack options against players.

This would indefinitely prevent this from happening ever again.

The whole point of clue scrolls that send you into the wilderness is the chance you might be PK‚Äôd. It‚Äôs supposed to be challenging. Stop being retards and wear a bulwark with black d hide and learn to pray against the style they‚Äôre attacking you with, you will get away most of time

Yea i'm using the gloves, the one doll out of all of them brings up the dialogue ' 'kuluf aliu monopiate kuluf ali monopiate' and then closes &amp; tells me that I didn't find anything. The other dollls just say that I found nothing

So up to 20k gp? Nice call.

The agility is worse tbh. I'd rather do rc than agility

Damn. I thought this was elaborate but it could be a lot more common?? Good on you man, for thinking ahead of those bastards. In my case, I was weighing losing an archer ring (i) due to it being my plus 1 if i got smited :/

Still, shouldnt have risked what I wasnt willing to lose.

give it time young anakin and you too can troll through the galaxy. gotta string em along somehow eh?

Many people who don't know how to 4:1 find it extremely difficult.  Assuming that you're "experienced", you would know how to skip cycles I assume, then it wouldn't be hard for you to learn at all.

I was just wondering which method since all he did was afk woodcutting. Jesus, some people have a stick up their ass so far that it comes out their mouth...
---
Gotta love that rush. Just hope people would earn it in a more honorable way? I feel worse about being lied to honestly.
---
Yeah i was an every day smoker for a long time but since i turned probably 21-22 which was 6 years ago I dont do it much anymore. I hate not being able to explain sometimes what just happened in my dreams haha. 
---
This has been an issues for **YEARS** now.  Don't expect Jagex to do anything about these bots to be honest.
---
I mean, I got skull tricked 2 weeks ago but it wasn't a lure like this. Luring is just scummy af.
---
Had a task to kill chaos ele, so I'm out with my archer's ring i, slayer helm i, and a craw's bow.
---
Got pked a few times, nothing new, generic guy in ahrims runs up and starts barraging me after barraging someone who had just hopped to that world. Other guy starts attacking him so I fight back as well, almost kill him a few times, guy kites us into the rogue's castle, another guy same lvl, gear, and I swear identical name traded places with him at the staircase and I didn't notice, it was fucking flawlessly pulled off, immaculate routine, definitely a lot of practice involved. So of course I end up skulling on him, didn't even realize I skulled until 6 more people logged in and piled me. Smited me for about 60m, 2m nmz pts of imbues, and the only part I'm even really upset about is my slayer helm had a kbd head in it. Currently about 50 kills back on the grind for another head to restore things back to normal, made about 40m in the last 2 weeks so it's not a massive setback, just an unfortunate one.
---
Long story short, I feel your pain.
---
just make sure to realize that magic spells give xp when cast against players, even on an ironman.  
---
Did u hear the ge sound when you logged in and jizz cuz u thought it was the ely that bought?
---
I'm asking mostly because this is something I have no clue about but could they conceivably make part of the program NOT open source? Or would the fact that everything else is open source mean they couldn't make a part of it closed off from the rest of the application?

---
He‚Äôs not up and coming he just has a mildly interesting gimmick account once he is done or the gimmick dies so does the bulk of his popularity 
---
RS is a membership based game. If they're not making money from that membership, there's no reason to have you playing the game. 
---
You are saying the soulless in the cages say that to you, right? What does Iban's doll in your inventory say when you search it? (I think that is the option it gives...)
---
You said the next hardest hitting spell is at level 82. I said you're wrong. I literally said "with charge" in the first two words lol. 
---
But they're against normal trading too, so that doesn't count.
---
That‚Äôs just, like, your opinion man.
---
Then what other way do iron men get cballs besides smithing? People saying it‚Äôs a waste of time to smith them, implying there‚Äôs another method to get them. 
---
Legally you can sue for a lot of things, doesn't mean you'd get anywhere with it. Unless he's running some gold trading empire with sufficient proof that it caused evident damage to Jagex as a business, they wouldn't get anywhere with it and wouldn't bother either. 
---
I dont think you had to even log in.
---
Maybe youre thinking of orion client?

They‚Äôre not mediocre but they also don‚Äôt warrant the mindless circle jerk

Hey congrats you're 1/8th of the way done.... with agility :)

I know it's a meme to praise him every chance you get but his level of dedication is pretty legit. He's been doing these '30 hour grinds' literally his whole series and that's why each video is so impressive.

I killed somebody with 100+ of each teleport scroll and 1.5k house tabs once who was naked. As well as a few people at greater demons who had full jewellery. It‚Äôs an easy kill - if you‚Äôre truly risking nothing you have no reason to be out there and you can run back and finish the mundane task you‚Äôre doing
---
Okay I have an idea actually, go talk to Niloof. According to the wiki, if you lose the doll you can talk to him to get another: [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Doll\_of\_iban](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Doll_of_iban)
---
You'd be surprised how hard some companies hit people for breaking the rules of the game.
---
Go take a look at the lawsuit Epic Games dropped on a kid's parents because the kid used hacks online.
---
"he insulted my pet and I don't play that"
---
"oh god. It's a stupid game"
---
Yeah something doesn't add up
---
[removed]
---
When do you think you‚Äôre next one will be so I can remindme bot?
---
Yea its fair that the game wasnt designed with them in mind. But a lot of things were realized to be broken/not fluid once the ironmen meta started to unfold. I mean we can argue is negative or positive but in the end I believe that if you can 'solo' in a mmo. Then it means that its designed properly.
---
Another point is that before ironman were a thing. I dont think we realized how we pretty much lived in a cycle where we needed supplies from bots to play the game. Something that the ironman game mode highlighted. 
---
But I do understand the argument that the game shouldnt be balanced around them. But it shouldnt neglect any type of game style. Via pvm, skilling, ironman, pvp. 
---
I mean it is very simple... Things that pass polls by over 75% should be added because most players think it is a good idea.. It is the one thing that seperate OSRS from not only RS3 but every other game... So if Jagex can just ignore the polls when adding or not adding content then why have them anyway and just play RS3
---
H
---
Because its such a retarded question, i worry about tour day to day living if you cant engage your brain long enough to come up with how he gained gp.
---
Have a bath.
---
I'd say Agility isn't something you do; it is something that happens while you're doing other stuff. If you are focusing on the skill, it is terrible; the same can be said for a lot of skills honestly.
---
But unlike other skills, Agility is extremely casual to do. You're not competing for resources or dealing with NPCs that can move. It is the same simple cycle and it is very easy to stop and pick up midway. So that makes it one of, if not the, best skills to do while you aren't focusing on the game.
---
Thank you for the help! :)
---
And what came off it? Did his parents have to pay Epic? It is a pretty isolated case though and takes place in America (I assume, IDK), in Europe at least this wouldn't fly.

I can't even imagine how long it took to get that armor.

It sound like some paranoid type stuff, but I seldom trust anyone in this game.

I don't expect to be able to stay ahead of learning all the new lures, so I would prefer to just not risk much.

I'm not going to let a sweaty prick ruin a simple game for me.

1 pet of each kind at a time. you will not receive duplicate pets, only a notification/collection log counter that you would have received one. if you lose the one you have that isn't insured, you will have to earn another because it doesn't stockpile a reserve of pets like that. more than you asked but I'm sure someone else was wondering too

Yeah I guess I didn't read far enough to see this guy thinks someone is mad enough to a divine into multi willingly.

I know this is a joke, but I actually stopped playing RS back in the day because my computer couldn't handle it. When the HD overhaul released my computer was so old that the integrated GPUs drivers were incompatible. I just got an unsupported drivers error when I tried to log in. I didn't even know that was possible. That was the day my childhood died. Never forget.

nope. checked an hour later and hes still flicking outside

I think cabin boy Colin is missing, can‚Äôt find him in normal spot in port sarim

No problem friend 
---
I was in the same position, just came back after years of not playing and I'm having a blast. The wiki has an "optimal quest guide" which is nice for starting off. I honestly watched a lot of ironman vids as well which helped me
---
I‚Äôm going to assume you meant that if you can‚Äôt solo it was designed poorly, because that‚Äôs what makes you argument make sense. And if you did, that‚Äôs a horrible argument, it‚Äôs literally a Massively Multiplayer Online game. Balancing content around solo players is dumb when the literal genre of game has multiplayer in it.
---
We don‚Äôt need supplies from bots. We need supplies and people botted it, the content wasn‚Äôt designed for bots to farm it. Just because it‚Äôs boring doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad content, runecrafting makes me want to gouge my eyes out but it is a good skill.
---
I think it should only focus on Ironman to fix game changing bugs or stuff that‚Äôs seriously OP. Like item smuggling and stuff like that. But other than that they should focus on making normal accounts (which is 80% of RS) a better experience.
---
Wow has anything else runescape related ever been on trending? Genuine question
---
If you killed a few goblins and started with 10 gp you‚Äôd have 15m and 5.3k pots by now.
---
Well, after my experience it doesn't sound paranoid at all. You know as we were messaging, I had a funny feeling, like those hairs on the back of my neck starting, but I wrote it off as being paranoid. Looking back, and certainly looking forward I'll be more cautious.

The only thing i use to play is the Jagex launcher I downloaded when is started and i've run scans with two different programs looking for a key logger.

Don't need one except that I have no reason to make multiple accounts. I've used one account since I joined anything Jagex related, I would like to keep it that way ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The character has existed for 14 years. It clearly states it in the meme.
---
They didn‚Äôt have a psychic working at Jagex in 2004 who knew they‚Äôd have a Mod Gee in over a decade lmao 
---
Looks like you‚Äôre correct, my mistake. 
---
I think the GE is a necessary, id like a quasi Ironman mode with a super large community for buying and selling.  So you still have to figure out how to get stupid stuff to do more obscure content but don‚Äôt have to grind 85 slayer to get a whip essentially. 
---
I would prefer the game without the GE. I know that isn‚Äôt popular and OSRS would probably be smaller without it but....
---
Buying / selling / haggling used to be its own part of the game. It fits the medieval RS theme better than a market exchange. It was more fun in my eyes, merchanting was a much more active thing and I enjoyed the player interactions etc. 
---
Some other more direct reasons I would prefer the game to not have the GE:
---
-	Street pricing is a lot more stable than the GE ticker. 
---
-	Bots have way less impact on the value of resources because there isn‚Äôt a direct track supply, the GE reflects the impact of bots very rapidly. 
---
-	The GE removes an entire dynamic of gameplay that has existed since the beginning of RS. 
---
It‚Äôs hard to explain to new players, why it‚Äôs so much better without a GE. I think there‚Äôs a few groups of people that have conflicting views for different reasons. 
---
If you didn‚Äôt play back then before the GE, I understand why you would not believe that the old system could possibly be better for the game. Many people that weren‚Äôt around for it don‚Äôt understand how easy it was to find what you needed. Fally W2 was SUPER organized. It‚Äôs always blown way out of proportion how long it took to get what you need or find what you want. 
---
The only types of items where you would really catch yourself in need of using forums and waiting were either very niche (holiday items) or for things you would need a continuous bulk supply of (70k dragon bones or something).
---
If you did play before the GE, and you were of age, you‚Äôre probably more inclined to feel like the old way was better. 
---
If you played before the GE and you were only like 10 years old, I can see why you would like the GE. 
---
The old ways required a little bit of communication and I could see why the younger crowd would not like that or feel like it was a worse system 
---
I‚Äôm not saying that those groups of people are 100% one way or the other, I‚Äôm just saying I can definitely see how OSRS players today have their views about the GE. It‚Äôs a massive convenience but it comes at a cost of an entire dynamic of gameplay. The people that were too young to experience it that way won‚Äôt see it that way, similarly to people who didn‚Äôt experience it at all. 
---
It‚Äôs a damned if you do damned if you don‚Äôt situation. You can‚Äôt possibly show someone what it was actually like and you can‚Äôt convince the opposition that something that is seemingly inconvenient could add so much value to the game. 
---
Tldr: The player run market was healthier in general for a number of reasons. You can‚Äôt expect to convince the vast majority to give up the convenience of the GE if they don‚Äôt understand what trading was actually like.

---
Cerberus and Corporeal Beast.
---
Yeah, I grinded slayer super hard for Hydra, I believe I got something like 6m experience in roughly a month.  Didn't boss at all along the way (bossing is bad xp).  High slayer is all I have.
---
In game encouraging, I don't believe they encourage the real life versions of any of those.
---
And for the real value of GP it's true it does have an official conversion rate now, however since you cant convert bonds to real world money I personally wouldn't say you lost real money by losing in game currency. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on it though.

If I spent $60 on bonds, which I then sold for GP, which I then gambled away or lost to a scam, would you agree that I have lost $60?

I guess a similar way to think of it goes: You can buy a video game for $60. Just because you can't sell it back for $60, you're still out $60 if you lose it or it's stolen

It‚Äôs more of a joke. I bought my 8086k and 1080ti right before the 9900k came out and I‚Äôm very happy with it. If I‚Äôd bought a 2080ti I wouldn‚Äôt have my HTC Vive Pro until way later (first month rent + utilities + a lot of other stuff hit my newly found income hard) and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be getting as much fun out of the 2080ti as I‚Äôve gotten out of the 1080ti + VR.

I might still get a 2080ti, but at this point I‚Äôll probably just do another build in 2020 when the next flagship NVIDIA line comes out with better RTX cores + support and non-shit DLSS implementations.

Whats your hp?  The light house dagganoths downstairs are best cannon exp ive found IMO but you not sure if its viable with 1 defense as there are ranged and melee mobs attacking you. You can bring noted food and ppots though and sell them upstairs and buy back to unnote, but as 1 def youd prob take to much damage for it to be viable. Unless your hp is high enough. Which prob not since you just started the act. They drop good seeds too and med clues.
---
Prob crabs or caged ogres tho for 1 def. Cant think of any place for a pure that would be better really. Since most places have mixed combat styles attacking you. 
---
It's in part due to their usefulness in training crafting and their high alchemy price of 7k
---
Yeah when i was on DMT once i had an out of body experience that scared me shitless. Felt like i was being plucked out of the universe and put back into my body over and over like i was trying to hold onto my body with my spirit and something kept yanking me away. Definately don't recommend haha.
---
See i agree with you on the "jumbled up mash" subject, but not entirely. Because most dreams are jumbled up mashes aren't they? Unless its just me on a normal night i can have a couple of wild dreams but even if i get up the moment i open my eyes and write in my dream journal, it is still a  mash instead of a (as you describe) linear step by step.
---
So the way i see it, is during the dream it can feel like you go through a life span, and it actually seems like a real life, but when you wake it you can only remember those mashed up bits. But you still have the feeling. You know? Like when i lucid dream i can do what seems like hours of fun in the span of one REM cycle. When I wake up I KNOW that i flew, and that i talked to this person, and that I destroyed new york with my buddy godzilla, etc. But i don't really.... "remember." Like i can't tell you where i went or what i saw or what i did specifically or what i said with too much detail. I just have that feeling of knowing those things.
---
 And if we're being honest, how many of us have woken up from an incredible dream and felt utter disappointment that it was over? That empty feeling like you just lost something great. So my theory when people wake up from those "life dreams" they have that same feeling of knowing. Like they can't really remember, but they know inside, and it leaves you with a really empty, catastrophic, world-falling-apart feeling inside. Much larger and intense than just a regular dream. And i think the mental cases, and the chronic depression stem from that. I certainly would question the purpose of my life, not gonna lie i'd probably feel suicidal after that lol.

Runecrafting is like farming except it takes a week to finish growing
---
Literally the poll? The proposed method would have affected any ironman trying to train crafting, pretty much and that includes low levels. Bunch of people like you who don't want their achievements affected are the only people who didn't want it, which fine, that's fair. I don't agree with it, but that's the point of polling, it's just annoying when it passes and then you get your way anyway. 
---
I got 99fm as my first since I wanted todt resources more than I wanted the cape itself tbh. It's nice that I have it but that's about it.
---
And even despite being my first, it was pretty late in the account. 
---
You can also get 200 m xp in all so you can finally play the game
---
They seem to have actually removed the ability to high alch the heads so they're even worse than before.
---
set goals for yourself. find something you want to be able to do and work towards it. 
---
aim for quest cape. that may seem a bit overwhelming, but questing will really set up your account in a good direction. shoot for quest cape ‚Äî you don‚Äôt necessarily have to do EVERY quest, but quests unlock so much ‚Äî and then medium diaries and you will be on your way to a nice account. 
---
two years ago i set a goal for quest cape and all medium diaries, and now i have quest cape (i did a long time ago) and almost have all elites finished. 
---
I gotta admit, this was the first one I watched and I was completely immersed for the whole 21 minutes, didn't even realise time fly.

Good job /u/SettledRS , you're approaching RS YT legend status if you aren't already there. :)

Turning them into elemental staves is good  crafting training 
---
Just mine the sulphur and drop or bank it. Do that till 75% then do the [mine carts](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lovakengj#Delivering_minecart_control_scrolls). I believe that to be the best way.
---

Honestly, IMO higher education is mostly bullshit. It's glorified high school 2.0 that exists to make qs much money off you as possible because you "need" that piece of paper. I'm not saying I leaned nothing from college, but with the amount of time and money I spent on that piece of paper I could have done much more, but again I wouldn't have that piece of paper. Higher education, especially in the states, is a whole lot of capitalized bullshit. 
---
Problem is that sticking something in the wilderness doesn't make it high risk/reward. 3/4 iteming, 27/56 bone chaos altar, clue boxes all negate the high risk part of the equation. Sure the reward part takes a hit too, but significantly less of one. 
---
No what you are doing is fine I do it too but on the 2nd kill I suppose you should look for a 50~ plus hit.
---
Once you memorize the course it‚Äôs extremely afk and you can just watch movies.

Thank you, this always baffles me when people complain about the SEO of the wiki. Bookmarks were made for things like this, and they have existed for at least the last two decades.
---
I know its /s but they actually nerfed everything to shit. fuck rs3 anyway
---
Something about the way he‚Äôs excited and the crazy things he has to do to improve honestly brings out some deep nostalgia for me from when I was 10 years old. No wiki searches, no efficient zip per hour, just fucking running around trying to make money in the most convoluted ways, creaming myself over a time full helm.

I agree. I am ever chasing the piece of paper. I have 9 years of programming under my belt (java, python, C#) and multiple apps, games, and other projects under my name that function and are good quality and i still can't even get to the interview phase of applying for related jobs. Even after all these years. There is definitely stigma behind the paper. But who knows maybe one day i'll make something that'll actually make me money. All i can do is dream.

How do you get it to show your fps I was curious what my phone and tablet ran.

Your offers go inactive if you haven't logged into RS3 for 1 week. So you'd have to keep re-logging once every 7 days to keep it going.
---
I actually stopped playing soon after the GE came out. It took a lot of fun out of the game for me. I agree with almost all your points.

No. Lot of people do this.

Basically anything that isn't a bug is fair game.

I grew my kitten no problem while training Agility. You can do this with literally any other skill too and in my opinion, saves you a lot of messing around collected spice so you may as well grow it into a cat while training other skills haha. Silly guy.

The wilderness altar actually (almost) halves the cost compared a poh gilded altar because the 50% chance to save a bone also applies to bones that have already been saved. This tends toward a limit of 2x the original input.
---
I say (almost) double because there's always the chance you get pked, and if you want to unnote your bones at the altar then that costs a bit of extra money as well.

They're bots. Ali Morrisane has a discount rune shop thing you can unlock, so I'm guessing that's why they're doing it.

I‚Äôve watched him for years now because of the UIM content but he was never really big. What happened that made him blow up so fast? Lack of big time YouTubers for OSRS currently?

interesting idea how is the implementations gonna be though

First suggestion would be awesome, I completely forgot about the paint for helms and sheilds, they should definitely add some more/bring that back/allow more paintable items!
---
Second suggestion not too bad, feel like it could end up a little weird though depending on how they would implement it, overall I dig it though.

Not a fan, fire cape is tzhaar specific, don't really want taste the volcano players all over the place.

Hey, thanks for the reply! Yes, I've seen these methods and many more online. I can and definitely will also do these things, but I'm looking for something I can level up to to take advantage of the fact that I have a membership. For example, my fishing level is enough for monkfish, but I'm limited because I'm f2p. I'm not against paying for a membership, but I need something to do while I don't have it, that would benefit me when I do.

I've had this happen when cactus spines use to only give 3, but I  ended up with four. I'm guessing it's the same thing, being that the calquats have their own replenish timer and you just happened to pick yours right as the calcquat replenished.

Just do random quests you have the reqs for. Even if they're long once they're finished you never have to do them again and it'll be an accomplishment.
---
Tbh you sound like you're spending more time researching the quests than it would to just bang out a few quests. 
---
Yeah, that's it I think. I don't even know what Verf is going for right now besides clue scrolls, waiting for lamp randoms, and Inferno. Those are going to take forever with little real content in them. He can make some decent videos out of it but it won't be as engaging as Settled doing quests, bosses, and barrows.
---
Settled does have a way of making small goals seem huge. When Verf got 99 woodcutting it was neat, but Settled having 2 Hunter was insane. Verf getting that casket was pretty sweet though.

It's frustrating that someone with level 1 farming and no quests done can obtain this very strong upgrade that required someone to have not only high farming but high enough combat to defeat a decently challenging demi-boss multiple times. I don't even know why it's tradeable in the first place...

I have 99 thieving and would fail without ardy hard diary/thieving cape. It‚Äôs the best source of easy clues so they purposely make it hard to grind.

Zulrah is hilariously slow with 70s in range/mage. Even 80s is pretty slow.

How to you propose that they just add more that links the 2 of them. 
---
Also theyentioned that they probably won't allow recolors for nostalgias sake. 
---
Their reasoning is "we don't like remodelling/recoloring items players already have as it may make many upset after they grow attached to the old style"

Wouldn't actually mind. Looters would have to actually right click and check rather than mindlessly clicking the top and hoping for the best

I know too little of pvp to vote no just because people tell me it will change the way 5% of all the pkers pk. It's not because I give 0 fucks about pvp, I just don't know how it would affect deep wildy pking but it's not enough to make me vote no on the shield. Not because I want pking ruined.
---
I don't think they are, that's just how the Ironman is set up. I believe an Ironman like mode where you can't use the GE but can trade with anyone else who can't use the GE would be fantastic for the game. Like group Ironman but instead of 4 people, it's anyone who signed up.

Nah mate you stupidity is what gets me. And the inability to form a sentence.
---
If you are returning to the game just now, it will be better to make a new account anyway, more secure that way, and you would have to start over regardless with your character, because your old stats are not in OSRS, but RS3. 
---
You can see what they have equipped too..
---
This is a really good idea and seems to be align with what would actually pass. Money sk8nds are good and fun t improves quality for players without seeming too unfair 
---
Don't you need to be assigned a task to get Slayer exp?

I was expecting about 20 people tops but it seems like I was very wrong. Next time the heads up will be much better, I promise.

This joke has been done alreadt
---
I mean you don't have to like it but at least let's not pretend saying you can have one of the most basic items in the game so you can actually train a skill is quite the same as making a massive shift to appeal to Ironman players.

No, inflated. There's more of it now, so it has less value.

Hey guys I had a few questions about nmz imbues;

If imbue a black mask then use it to make a Slayer helm will the helm be imbued?

True but it's a good update on an old format. I'm guessing op didn't make the format update but still 
---
It's good though people falling for this mostly don't leave a follow (they click the secure.runescape.com text of the hyperlink for more context) and they may not even realise they've been whispered, by that time they may already be on the website.
---
Twitch is the only one who can really resolve this. They could essentially use the same metrics as you, except check if they've been hosted anywhere as well, and then automatically shadow delist them from the OSRS category until staff confirms.

If you read the updates you wouldn't ask where veos is

ick, rather buy gold then lol. I just want a crawsbow for revs. 
---
Not necessarily because the pricing is a result of an algorithm and it is published for all to see.
---
or you could just skip the task xd, and anyway you have to train slayer
---
Or ya know, the fact that AGS arent traded at the quantity of fucking air runes? 
---
Obsidian platelegs &gt; Berserker Ring &gt; Torture &gt; Ferocious Gloves &gt; Bludgeon / Dagger &gt; Prims &gt; Tassets &gt; BCP
---
The bludgeon and dagger are for training Strength, assuming you need to train that. Otherwise you can sell them if you are training Attack or Defence.
---
Not so much shrinking as everyone who uses AGS to pk already has one, so the market has a lot of extras.  The only times people buy new ones is if they get smited 
---
I'm like 3 hours late on this one because I was working on the shading but I have finally finished! Here is my Valentine's gift to you all c: Enjoy !

inb4 he becomes a b&amp; and filtered topic for being too spammed on 07scape
---
bad wrap
---
What are you trying to correct ya asshole? Everything he said was true.
---
I still don't understand what you're trying to say. Turn it any way you like, it shows you breaking the game rules. The context has been explained several times. 
---
Yeah I touched on this in a different comment. Varrok in OSRS was not well organized.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm going to try to answer these as best that I can. I fully admit that some of what I‚Äôm going to say will seem very subjective especially for those that don‚Äôt have the old market experience. And I‚Äôm fully aware that ‚Äúbecause it is or was‚Äù is not a good answer but bare with me because regardless, what I‚Äôm saying is true. 
---
1.How are prices more stable with bartering over GE?
---
Street pricing was a more stable pricing system for a few reasons.
---
-	There was no visible algorithm dictating the value of an item based on values it has been traded.
---
-	The marketplace itself served as a barrier to deflation. Players knew the established value of items and to an extent, once an item found its place in the market, its trade value was maintained by players trying to buy and sell on margins. Prices of course did change over time but the plateaus were vastly longer than you could expect by today‚Äôs standards and the deviations were very minimal increments due to the player markets. This is why many nonmeta items would not come ever come close to scraping alch price. They had value as a potential marketable item and their value was upheld for purposes beyond its usefulness. 
---
-	- Take abyssal whips for example, they did start out very expensive 10m+ as not many people could acquire whips. Over time they settled down and plateaued around 5m and within the next year they were solid between 2.4-2.7m. They never got much lower because they were heavily traded. This worked for the merchants and the slayers.
---
-	(This one is going to seem weird but follow me because this was a thing) Discontinued items served as a sort of ‚Äúcheck and balance‚Äù in the RuneScape market. New, reproducible content was never going to contest the value of the rarest discontinued item in the game. Obviously this is a concept that became more relevant in the later markets because discontinued items were not always so valuable but it helped to keep valuation in check for new content as time went on.
---
 2. Can't bots just sell their resources to merchants and thus still lower the prices of botted resources, even though it's more indirect?
---
-	The answer here is, sure, that could happen and it did happen to an extent. There are several reasons it wasn‚Äôt as drastic however, some of which are reflected above. The prices of resource balanced more heavily on gameplay, market value, and alch values. Take yew logs for instance, one of the most heavily botted resources ever at that time in RS, you knew no matter what - that yew log was worth 280-300gp. The reason being, fletching yew longs was one of the most popular fletching methods and alching yew longs was one of the most popular alching methods. The longs could be sold at profit (yew logs 300ea + bowstring 150ea) to (yew longs 550-600ea), or alched (768ea) to either break even, make a few K on the nature price, or alch for a small loss. Between the skilling, the trading, and the alching, there was a mutually beneficial relationship that kept the pricing at a stable point. The woodcutters could profit, the fletchers could profit, the alchers could break even / maintain small losses for alchables. Bots had no say in the relationship of those resources. There wasn‚Äôt a price ticker that would display a deflated value. They were continuously traded the way it made sense in the market. 
---
-	- Quick side note, this didn‚Äôt apply to everything. There were resources that deflated over time, but again - this due to external forces. Changes in the game‚Äôs meta were far more influential than supply. And still even items that were in heavy supply like pure ess, things didn‚Äôt just crash to alch price, they settled on fair terms for the market. 
---
 3. Wouldn't GE merching count as a new dynamic gameplay that got introduced with the GE, thus the GE replacing one dynamic gameplay with another?
---
-	I would completely argue against it being a similar dynamic. I can‚Äôt argue against it being a different gameplay dynamic because it very obviously is. My only comment would be that it isn‚Äôt the same. The way trading was back then was sort of similar to staking. There was a dopamine rush attached to it. It was somewhat a Wild West scenario. There wasn‚Äôt a price checker in the trade window, sometimes you had to discuss offers, and often you could find your own methods to merching which may have changed on a daily basis. You couldn‚Äôt count on buying bulk items and waiting for the GE to work in your favor. The trading was a live experience. If you wanted to merchant you had to work for it, understand your target items / street pricing, and sometimes build relationships in the markets but it was so much more rewarding in that regard. You don‚Äôt see item swapping almost AT ALL in OSRS because that form of trading has no value. It‚Äôs all for GP. Used to be you could end up with a hotter item to help move more gold or something. Just small things like that don‚Äôt exist with the GE. 
---
As far as merching via trade still ‚Äúexisting‚Äù it‚Äôs definitely not the same. 9/10 times if someone is trying to trade you something outside of the GE it‚Äôs some type of scam. The marketplace isn‚Äôt supported and the GE dictates pricing entirely. 
---
&gt;	The biggest advantage the GE has over bartering is that I requires much less time to merch
---
I can‚Äôt argue the convenience. It is vastly more convenient. My whole stance toward the GE is in acceptance of that fact. My experience though is that the GE did more harm than good for the game. Outside of devaluing skilling, my big gripe is that it removed a massive social interactive dynamic from the game.
---
&gt;	A smaller advantage is that you do not need to use an autotyper for GE offers and having to read through a mess of dialog in your screen or text box
---
Autotyping helps but as far as reading through a mess, the trading worlds used to be super organized. The original OSRS market organizatioN was pretty bad, but that is another story. It didn‚Äôt have much time to form and varrok west is pretty suboptimal for space.
---
It's called indirect astroturfing and advertisement campaigns. He get rich by these posts, yet everyone just continues with it
---

It‚Äôs actually a pretty recent account my dude, last 4 months, also have the same price on my btw

Ironman is very good at hilighting problems with the games though, issues which normal players don‚Äôt really encounter because of bots, low level noobs, and to some extent the NMZ shop.

He supply outweighed demand so then unrealistic offers got fulfilled since they were over his 75gp asking price

This is literally the first drawing in the history of humanity to come with patch notes. What a world.

Doesn't seem like it, weaponized autism and obsessions by such people doesn't tend to pass

1/1k chance i believe. You're not doing anything wrong
---
With the recent lack of Nieve art, my right hand has been dedicated to Swampletics. I would like to return my right hand to Nieve again, and you‚Äôve helped in doing so. Thank you.
---
As NewGuy said, you arrive at a tile before it looks like you actually do.
---
The simplest way to solve this is by clicking a long distance away (longest straight line you can find), and make sure you move somewhere else when you are about 2 tiles away from the destination.
---
If you use RuneLite, turn on "Tile Indicators" for movement, and when the highlighted tile becomes un-highlighted, you have arrived.
---
no
---
Don't trick any youngsters with that equation, they'll be confident about the result in school and mislead everyone

He makes the rules. He made a rule to allow the account to leave mory for very specific and numbered reasons. It's his account not yours. You're welcome to do a real mory only account, and if you do I'll be the first to comment your exact comment because you had to go to lumbridge after tutorial island. 
---
I feel you. Not everyone in the community cares about some random guy making ultimate iron vids on YouTube. I personally enjoy settled‚Äôs content but am also getting burnt out on the memes. They‚Äôve been going strong for 3 weeks now
---
I don't have any friends lol so I started raiding solo and taught myself how. At 112 kc now all solos but no other drops... :(
---
MFW I get buttfucked everytime I try to PK at revcaves or pvp worlds, so I camp the annakarl teleport to tell naked people to sit.*

Surely that's what you meant.

I hate Jesus becuase he lied about speaking the truth

How are exp rates for curse-alching and would it be silly to try incorporate a teleport into it?

Wtf is that setup lmao

Probably tried to sell 75 instead of 150 and just did it on the wrong side

Each mouse movement in that video is tied to 1 key press. With ahk you‚Äôre able to move diagonally, something wmk is not able to do, hence me saying if you‚Äôre going to use ahk to move the mouse be sure to only do exactly what wmk is able to do

I doubt that most pkers pk because of some tards response on getting pked but more for fun and stuff...

Talk to the mage tutor in Lumbridge, and talk to the range tutor to auto equip arrows/darts

Haha! I bet you weren't the only one to think that :p

Yes

So every meme that gets posted on this sub?

isn't the whole idea of a SGS that you don't have to bring guthans?

If you fight back against people like him you might have more chance of surviving than running away. Like the guy above mentioned, barraging them and they will be the ones running. Big up if you stay for the fight though
---
It's been a pleasure, Stefan

? You literally only posted this because my comment score was negative. How insecure are you that you have to project on random people on reddit to feel better about yourself? Fucking pathetic. 
---
Rather get combat bracelet than those fuckedbup gloves you have. Dont wanna mention about d def cause everyone here already told that
---
Umm... you do know that when you log out and log back in you're in the same location so logging in a safer place is impossible if you've just logged out to avoid a pker

99 fishing on my iron banked about 20m cooking xp. Not really all that bad

Runeloader was never corrupt, the dude who made it leaked some guys personal details one time because of a silly argument.  Sure it was childish, but there was nothing wrong with the client. But as soon as reddit got word it obviously blew out of proportion that he was stealing passwords or some shit

Pfft yeah. THIRTY times.

You can use a dragon crossbow, its under 10m and can be easily obtainable in a day doing zulrah or vork. If you havent soloed gwd bosses before id advice watching in depth guides. It will take you 50-100 kills to get the hang of it!
---
A long bone

So I just died at the tanking part of mm2. Don‚Äôt really want to spend the money to do that again. Should I just get 70 agility to do the agility path?

Takes 2 seconds to check inv and equip screen

Starting a witchhunt is also fairly childish. Report in game and be done with it.

Sounds like when Joe Rogan and Redban took fleshlight as a sponsor lol

Cheap and fast crafting training 99 crafting is only 47m at the moment, compared to 90-100m back d bodies are.

I don't understand why people would vote for having to watch an advertisment

Just have a solid 12-18 jokes prepared. You have the fanbase already.

Why spoil it?

I made super restores with Amulet of chemistry, really good gp/xp.
---
Defeats the purpose of Konar just like she wont assign tzhaar tasks.

Oh sweet! I actually didnt know about the dragon crossbow! I assumed everyone meant the dragonhunter one which is over 100m. Sweet ill get that first before i go sara then, thanks!

Tbf that piece of paper proves that you can stick to difficult classes for years, as well as get through a general core curriculum. Of course your CS degree possibility, and my Engineering degree would be more highly thought of with the same gpa as a humanities degree. Jobs know what the rigor is.

Just do the other two slayer masters, we dont want them to be dead content.

We all know Konar is meant for Ironmen anyways lol

Sargons a fucking asshole but that doesn't mean he deserved to be booted. I actually.hate sargon and was pissed when joe rogan talked to.him (my fav podcaster)

ahahahah u got hacked retard

The normal drops did too? They just changed it for keys and i got pure ess one Rune platebody and one rune legs

How did they not have a barrage lol

Iron btw xD

Strange, Just yesterday I was able to find the captain on Corsair Ship... Okay.

lmao. You started it. So go cry in your room.

The best thing to do is to take your overgrown cat to the Port Satin Rat Pits, after Ratcatchers, and turn it into a wily cat. With a wily cat you can hunt the hell-rat behemoths (though don't forget to have some raw fish for healing). The hell rat behemoths each guarantee you a 4-dose spice of a specific colour.
---
To be 100% honest with you, I do not care THAT much for a game I play sometimes. I do not think it is wrong to just buy from a gold site. It is just a game. nothing else.
---
Excellent way to look at it
---
Dont forget 99 prayer and herblove
---
He dropped out of uni because he made much more years ago already than he would've made after finishing uni. 
---
Fucking repost
---
NO that is not 1 to 1.  One key press = one movement in a single direction.  Moving the mouse diagonally is two movements along the Y and  axis.  Imagine breaking the movements into their individual components - that is 1 to 1.
---
Imbued heart. Would give me permanent access to magic.

Time to deiron so you can play the game!

I think that there should be a Swampletics subreddit to clear this place of being about nothing but him. I just had to go and block 30 people who made threads about him because I am sick of seeing it. Every single day, Swampletics, Swampletics, Swampletics, Swampletics, Swampletics, like why don‚Äôt you just go comment on his YouTube page about how much you love him. I mean jesus, seriously? We get it he is the most amazing person to ever grace this game in the history of every well known person to ever do so. He‚Äôs better than Zezima and Lynx and everyone else who ever had even a fraction of notoriety in this game. We get it. Stop.
---
Also yes this is another post about Swampletics lmao holy shit I didn‚Äôt even consider that wow good one you are hilarious lmfao

This child isn't interested in having an actual intellectual conversation. He's just sitting in his chair saying pogchamp out loud to himself as he orgasms over his epic troll post
---
uhh no thats like dogshit rng btw.
---
That isn't true at all. The fact that they don't actively police it doesn't mean that they're allowing it.
---
I'm not denying the fact that many people probably want this. Fair enough. But Jagex knows their priorities. They've given players the option to mute people if they are offended. They are made aware of it on Tutorial Island. As far as I'm concerned, that's all they need to do.
---
I guarantee that the majority of the playerbase would prefer it if Jagex spent their time improving the game for everyone instead of protecting the emotions of the occasional snowflake.
---
If you want it so bad, pay someone to make a script to do it automatically. Otherwise, grow up and understand that the world doesn't care if you get offended because someone hurt your precious feelings
---
Do you use osbuddy?

Poor car
---
Damn that's lucky. WHere is the post of that?
---
ironmen get a shit ton from corp but i dont think hes there yet
---
not implementing a way to block it is allowing it.
---
and not wanting to see racial slurs dosent make me a snowflake lol
---
I even mentioned this in the beta testing. 
---
Exactly what I was thinking.
---
did he pay 73 each?
---
They did implement a way to block it. In fact, they implemented two.
---
1: Profanity filter
---
2: Mute them
---
If you buy gold legitimately through bonds, then good for you - you're supporting the game.
---
If you do it illegitimately, you just don't care about the game and we hate you for that. Yes, it's a game, but it's something we invest time and, for most of us, money in. If I came and absolutely trashed your television, you wouldn't be saying "hurr durr well it's just a tv". No, you'd be pissed because you put time/money into it.
---
Real money trading is harmful to the game because it 1) causes bots and 2) causes hackers.
---
Buuuut none of this matters to you anyways because you were that entitled kid in school who sucked at a sport but your mom sucked the coach's dick to get you on the team. Do you care about doing well on the team? No, because you didn't work for it and don't care much for the sport.
---
Cheers, thanks!

I'm not gonna argue about what the GE does to the economy and skilling since I really don't feel educated enough on economics to make conclusive statements, but just so you know, disliking the GE isn't an age thing, I was already a teenager when RS2 first came out, and I really hated the old way of buying and selling. There were just too many instances where I'd simply be unable to do what I wanted to because I couldn't find someone interested in my offers for whatever reason. I'd end up wasting at least half of an evening spamming the same message which I think hardly counts as a "social interactive dynamic". If it does, it's a really shitty version of it, especially considering the amount of bots and scammers and dedicated merchants around, they're not about to have a conversation, and if you did find someone to talk to, it certainly wasn't easy to do at w1 varrock west or w2 falador park, even private messages were easy to miss because of how quickly the chat log would remove them. I'd argue that more conversations happen at the GE than they ever did in the old markets.
---
One good thing about the GE though, was that it brought the biggest spike in active players in OSRS' life up until mobile released, obviously you could argue these were bot accounts but I couldn't find any evidence that this is the case.
---
So what you're saying is if I just out of curiosity posted a buy for an ely at say... 500k and left it there for a year I might get lucky?
---
Motive enough for me 
---
Hnnnng &lt;3
---
Hey dumbass there is a key on your keyboard whose sole purpose is to take a screenshot.
---
so you think racial slurs are the same as regular profanity like fuck piss shit etc?
---
why did i fall for the bait, brainlet smh
---
yikes having "spoiler swampletics hunter" as the first 3 words of your post can easily be guessed to what your post is about. Fuck off man fuck u for spoiling
---
You can either roll the dice on twitter, or roll the dice on reddit and hope your post gets enough traction to get noticed
---
I hunted. I‚Äôd probably suggest crafting though. I think it took around 60 hours for 83 hunter. Then again, I‚Äôll never need to train hunter again
---
You didn't have a bank pin or an authenticator, so you are dumb.
---
With the skills they are doing they are going to have like 5 200ms by the time I get agility lol
---
I didn't say that at all. It doesn't matter if it's the same. The only part that matters is the fact that it gets filtered out
---
I'm more impressed by you using a brine sabre for attack to 60 (I assume), that is savage.
---
RANIS DRAKAN YOU TEAM KILLING FUCKTARD

Just realised I've just been baited. gg

It's a 3rd party OSRS client called OSBuddy. If you do decide to use a 3rd party client, check out RuneLite. Don't use OSBuddy.

Is your wrist ok?
---
DT was fine with overhead prayers and decent magic. Just don‚Äôt sit at low hp

it does matter. no way in the world in a game they can mute players should this hate speech be going on.

this guy is literally laughing cause they dont punish it.

No fuck ads
---
For the zulrah phase where the mage form will spawn at the SOUTH, if i am using blowpipe, is it true that i will need  use longrange in order to stay out of the poison clouds?
---
is there any other phases for blowpipe/trident where i'll need to switch to longrange as well?
---
They sure as shit can't spell epically.
---
so what I draw from this is save your keys till 99 fishing? for the most money
---
In general you want to maximize the time spent doing way faster methods than you can do in f2p. Stuff like fishing is time wasted as early stage you will fly fish(f2p method) . Same goes for early combat training(cows&gt;giants), woodcutting(most trees are f2p, and you need 60attack for a dragon axe) and mining(iron ore).
---
Picking flax is now never worth it, spinning flax however only requires 10 crafting and could be a nice way to get your first gp. Buy the flax at GE and spin inside the lumbridge castle.
---
Questing is a great boost to your account, doing Waterfall quest gets you straight to 30 attack and strength.
---
Same with Knights Sword, almost takes you straight to 30 smithing, and from there you can make steel bars at the blast furnace. 
---
1 iron ore(93) and 1 coal(173gp) makes 1 steel bar(408), which is 142gp difference. You need to get ice gloves from killing the queen under the mountain. High agility would also help, so you use less money on stamina potions. 
---
You can make about 4000 bars per hour, making you 568k gp/hr, however you need to pay 72k gp/hr to use the furnace until you reach 60 smithing, and a few stamina potions as well.
---
If you want to chill instead you can do cannonballs at 35 at a normal furnace, like the one in edgeville.
---
At the end of the day, just do what you enjoy doing. 
---
Literally the dumbest account ever, especially considering you aren't even going to do it properly since you can't train member skills. Sad.

---
Been doing some sire as i'm hunting for the pet, and everything's going pretty smoothly (for once). I'm just having two main problems:
---
* I'm averaging about 12-15 kills/hour. If my DWH specs flub then the entire kill takes like 5 minutes. If even one goes off, then it's smooth as. Is this normal?
---
* Sometimes during the third phase i'll just randomly die from like 60 hp (through range prayer). Not getting hit by the poison splats, it's all mini damage. Again, is this normal? What HP should I start blood barraging at?
---
I'm using the method described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTnEb3n7pFc&amp;t=8m03s) where at the end of each kill, I kill the vents (2 stun) and then teleport out, pool, and run back. Max melee setup.
---
I often feel like sleeping is a waste of time and I'd rather we didn't actually need sleep to survive, but then I realise the dumb system would just make work days like 12 or 16 hours a day to compensate.

ok but how is it unoriginal? :)

Also,i've completed all the f2p quests,in case it matters

I thought AHK was banned except to map keys to other keys. He is clearly using AHK to make his mouse move X pixels up/down, but claiming this is allowed and banning people in the chat who dissent. I don't mind if it's legal I just thought Jagex's most recent word was that it's not legal?
---
Finally finished recipe for disaster! What a slog. What should my next goals be? I'm working to morytania hard diary which means 70 agility and Prayer. But otherwise I'm a bit stuck 
---
aaa I meant unironically :)
---
Here‚Äôs a quest guide.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Corsair_Curse
---
Should have had a blue cape on with tattered clothing like God himself.
---
Are you fucking retarded? Rewatch the very first episode he LITERALLY says that while he has a morytania locked rule, he'd make exceptions if not leaving would lock out too much content. The dude didn't spend more than 5 minutes outside of mory, and it was only to talk to Roald and get a saw.
---
When you don't even know what you're talking about, you shut your fucking retarded mouth, he didn't break any of his rules, being able to leave to not lock out thousands hours of content for a few minutes stroll outside of morytania was literally one of the first thing he said he would do in the first video of the series.
---
tl;dr you're ignorant, retarded, and should use 1 nature and 5 fire runes on yourself.
---
Top quality meme, hats off to you sir
---
this but unironically
---
OP‚Äôs got 99 cooking 
---
No, strength is useless without anything better than iron scimitar, so he should to get attack first, then strength then defence unless he find a way to train defence faster than other two
---
Runelite will automatically track and time everything you plant if you use it.
---
As for levelling an easy way is to just start with trees.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Trees
---
See what trees you have access to and how expensive they are. Purchase a sapling of the trees you want and the visit all the tree patches with your tools and some ultracompost and plant them.
---
ohhh yea i see what toy mean but trust me its 100%  irony XD
---
You're the one who doesn't get it. You're allowed to not like his series, but being such a god damn degenerate that you come on here to cry like a 5 year old kid about how he doesn't follow his own rules, when these exceptions were literally one of the first rules he set on the first video, makes you such a complete fucking moron that even a toddler would be more intelligent than you.
---
You could also argue that spending 30 minutes rearranging your inventory whenever you want to do something different is sad 
---
or alching
---
cant be done this would require engine work, that's not to say it cant be done on something like runelite. however jagex has a automated detection for them. what your asking for would be extremely annoying to see and don't you think that it would be better if they made away with the entire report interface, and instead just had the report option when u right click and from there it sends the report to jagex. let them sort it out. but nonetheless you never addressed one of the real issues is that it is rather hard for some to report people usually because there on the go and fighting something(s) and that usually would close the interface. so it comes down to this is it worth reporting a bot if I suffer a exp loss? and the answer is simple no. perhaps you should just make a post suggesting to remove the interface all together. lots of work u did in this your a champ for that.
---
No, alching is much better
---
SwAmPMaN GoOd

Surely Skill Specs was planning to poison Torvesta?
---
I don't think you have reading comprehension.
---
NIEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Don‚Äôt worry I do too man
---
We got him boys
---
Doubt anyone would freak out tbh
---
Looks SICK AF! Guess it‚Äôll have to be as rare as 3a weapons for general public to want it. 
---
That's good of you. If I teled off mid battle I don't even think my IRL friend would share 
---
Where the fuck does the 75m value even comes from? Dude's just a retard that can't read. The offer is 75 fucking gold pieces, not 75 millions of them. He got 1.5b for them.
---
No like a day I slept fir a bit of it
---
Fuck!
---
End of March 
---
What a shitty black hat hacker, you can loot that back in a few hours at rev caves my man don't get discouraged.
---
Where did my comment go
---
Awe weird ok so it's been a day but I slept too and ate and such
---
This is above average loot, saw a 50key drop earlier and it showed 4.6m loot. U went about 170% above normal price as I think average is 100k per key
---
Some fucker actually called me out for going through his house in relleka the other day. I felt attacked.
---
Wait I‚Äôm 90% sure this guy has been in multiple YT vids before just as a bystander. Good to see my man going up in the world.
---
This is where it came from:

Did you also never see your title anywhere else and think it's anywhere near original?
---
When you can see every link has the exact same ending after the / but you still keep clicking them
---
https://m.imgur.com/Rvb6cJ5.png
---
&gt;Top comment iirc
---
Not in video. In the comments.
---
Do you have a torso and fire cape? I got those like 9 months ago and still use them everyday haha 
---
Do you need the ultracompost? That's one of the things I'm confused about - using ultracompost vs paying farmers vs the benefits of the magic secateurs vs flowers... etc.
---
I went around and planted some oak trees this morning. Will I get the XP when I go back after 3 hours (or whatever it is)? If I wait too long, will I not get any XP?
---
Behemoths are a complete waste of time with a wily. It's much faster to just chase rats. You can kill like 10 rats in the time you fight 1 behemoth, the chances you don't get 4 doses of the spice you want in that is very low.
---
Hahaha so funny and original so happy that people on this subreddit upvote the good stuff ahahahahahahahaha
---
Very well put, put a smile on my face.
---
It also was done like a year ago with the "2 squares northwest of the lumbridge church locked UIM".
---
He had a series of posts which ended when he accidentally clicked out of the square when he attacked something, and thus retired the account.
---
can u npc contact bert for daily sand?
---
I don't know the post but I know that guy tried to sell like 7 elys but because of 2,1b limit other 3 got sold for pennies
---
then it's a couple layers of irony too much for you
---
I played OSRS for the first time in years. Had a quest cape way before they introduced ironman. Decided to try HCIM. Had something like 150 quest points, 1300 total level and a little over 90 combat when I lost my HC status on a slayer task.  
---
Switched from Kalphite Soldiers to Kalphite Workers as I had only 10 Kalphites left on the task and a little over 10 HP with no food. "Okay, these critters don't seem to do much" was my thought-process as there were 2 Kalphites left on the task and 6 HP remaining. I didn't have my hand on the mouse as I was semi-afking and I just had to witness that second to last motherfucker hit me with three two times in a row.  
---
Uninstalled and haven't played since. Maybe I'll start again somewhere in 2025.
---
Dharock hardmode with ovs crush probably, imbue that ring 
---
White lily plants are grown to protect crops, but you CAN technically farm and harvest them. Which gives you a White Lily Flower. It does nothing. Literally no use outside of making supercompost. And because you get 1 flower out of the entire plant, it's not even worth doing that.
---
Dont even joke about that shit. Ita horrible and disgusting. Anyone who even jokes about it should be perma banned, especially anyone with that type of name. Thank u for sharing this op, ill be reporting this piece of garbage when i log in
---
I really like jakeysaurus, FatNooblet and Raikesy

The true snowman and ultimate flex is creating an unofficial UIM in 2019.
---
It wouldn't take any time as they would never include a link to a 3rd party website in game. 
---
Oh god you're giving me PTSD
---
Using same RSN and reddit user implies you could be using that user on different sites as well. He should have never used it as RSN in the first place. I looked up asiankevin1, no leaks, but asiankevin does. His OSBuddy user as well. They can't get his bankpin, he probably had items/gp in inventory. You can look up usernames/emails/passwords/ips, if you have the correct person, only with a username you could find out emails, used passwords and ips in leaked databases.
---
Not the plant that I'm complaining about. I have a few of the flower from having to do farming contracts.

RSN/reddit and OSBuddy users. He didn't have auth so with the right password they could literally just login and clean his inventory.
---
Thank you

Lmao guys it was just a joke playing on the exaggerated numbers "efficiency experts" throw out about skills. This sub sometimes smh 
---
Weird flax machine, but ok.
---
Fair enough, welcome back buddy
---
Well 91.99999 wouldn‚Äôt look as good as 92 because there‚Äôs no decimals in osrs ;)
---
It kinda ruins that when they add it just for him tho lol
---
Fat is gross.

maybe make it buy-able with slay points to unlock that task to be assigned

Thanks man, been following a quest guide for the last 2 days, makes it so much easier getting started again
---
Making fun of someone for "wasting exp" in RS. Wow. Can't go much lower than that.
---
more prolapsey
---
You don't seem to give a shit about this one, and 'lack motivation' so you may as well. The community could do without germs like you who won't accept that they're part of the problem
---
That's pretty much what they are doing. They have been keeping the blog post updated with the current plan and tweaking values.
---
I'm new to osrs. So seriously, is that a thing? 
---
Have another monk nearby complaining and call him Martin Luther.
---
Thank revs and Vorkath for that, really.
---
Hydra bones are way better to use than dragon. They give like 45% more experience and they are barely 2gp/xp more than dragon bones on wilderness altar, as time is money, dragon bones are a complete waste of time.
---
I hate when you trip and fall and your lasagna falls out of your pocket 
---
Skull up
---
This keeps happening to me except no big cash stack. I don't know why. I changed my password several times (pretty secure passes at that), I use mobile verification AND I use a bank PIN, yet every time I take a break longer than 6 months my account is stolen. 
---
Asking someone if their a bot prior to reporting them is not the effective way to make an educated report. You do it through other means with knowledge in botting.
---
Yeah msb i is my go to as well especially for slayer creatures with some defence to them. Blowpipe is awesome but far more expensive to train with.
---
No it's not scamming. It's just morons giving their money to someone for a non specific return
---
You're creepy.
---
They didn‚Äôt add it for him, another morytania Ironman was the one who requested it.

Better stock up on that red spice.

Yeah I thought the same exact thing, props haha
---
Whatever training method works for you is what you go with. Of course there may be better ones in others opinions, but as long as you're enjoying the turn out of xp etc. then it doesn't matter.
---
Aint that the truth. Used to be good but they just dumpstered any form of quality they had and now it's just a sad excuse of a coffee chain. Quite disappointing.
---
Bad for both games economy 
---
Holy shit this is so fucking retarded, the 75m has no relevance no matter what you try to turn the story to. 75m per makes no sense, they aren't even 20m, 75m for the lot doesn't make any sense either, cause that's fucking 500k per sword.
---
The fact is there was no 75m value anywhere in this thread or the other one and you're just so mad at your own mental retardation you can't accept the fact you're trying to argue for something that was never ever in relevance. 1 nature 5 fire runes etc.
---
It doesn't hurt that thanks to ToB, Morytania became a very attractive, place for a region-locked ironman. Probably the best area there is for such an account type, in fact.
---
Because it helps him out
---
ok thanks
---
Kind of a dick move holding onto that many at once and bulk selling anyway, what were you hoping to achieve?
---
Bad. 
---
They take away methods that could've otherwise been used by legit players by reducing the value of items that are being botted due to sheer volume of items they bring into the game.
---
There are frequently posts saying that there aren't that many great low/mid level money makers (although afaik there still actually are, just more obscure) and you could argue that's for a large part because of bots reducing the effectiveness of those methods.
---
they should make it so when you pay for trees to be dug up it takes money from your bank
---
A good tank is hard to find and harder to keep.
---
A video became popular recently showing the msb i as an effective weapon to use for afk ranged training at nmz. It's supply cost is extremly low so I don't see any issue. I'd check your xp tracker on runelite for 20mins for each method and see what you think is best. Everyone else can stick it
---
Nobody says something like this seriously. Move on people.
---
as long as it doesn't die, there is no time limit on checking the health.  I do tree runs like once a week and just check them whenever I feel like.
---
You want to use Ultracompost on things you're growing for money, since it increases yield AND decreases chance of death.
---
If there is no option to pay a farmer but you still want something to live (flowers), just use supercompost.  I don't think ultracompost affects yield for flowers so it's a moot point there.
---
If you're paying a farmer to watch a crop (and you don't care about yield) don't use any compost..  If you do care about yield then always, always use ultracompost.
---
Magic Secateurs just increase yield (on some things) if they're equipped when harvesting.
---
What I do, is herb/flower runs, typically ranarr/limpwurt.  I **DO NOT** do the allotment runs.  It like doubles the length of time a run takes and makes the inventory management a lot more stressful.  
---
Herbs/flowers are good for money.  I also do hops runs for money, though it isn't as good, but it is a quick/convenient run (~5 mins).  
---
Cactus Spines are another good one for money, because you only plant them once then just harvest from them over and over again.
---
Lastly, if you want xp, do the best tree/fruit tree you can (do both).  Even if you only do these runs like once a day, you can get thousands of xp from them.  I do pineapple trees and willow trees, willow trees are 1.5k xp and take about 8 hours, pineapples are 4.5k xp and take about 16 hours (but it only requires like 10 minutes of your attention, which is the secret).

I‚Äôm used to being downvoted. I just say the truth and people don‚Äôt like it. My little brother has mild ASD and this would be candy land for him. I‚Äôve done so much research on the symptom. I‚Äôm not saying autism is a bad thing either, there‚Äôs so many good things that come out of autism. Most are so beyond smarter than other people.
---
Myths guild bank just because it gives me a false sense of achievement. And the architecture and light there is cool.

Well I mean the paint that *i remember* had a white background if you tried to paste a png that would normally have a transparent background. Maybe they added it now so idk I'm still using win7 lol

I think we should have Jagex-provided gambling.  Like sand casino but not for stakers.  Or bet on stakers?
---
Meet Stake... The one and only sponsor strong enough to kill YouTube channels and vampires. While I only needed it for vampire slayer, or so I thought, a hidden mechanic found by EdwardRS shows that stakes are a 25% increase damage against vyrewatches and 100% chance to lose all of your money.

uhmm find out who hacked you and hack them back  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
But livestream says its 1/80
---
Ferocious gloves so I can nice gloves this guy.
---
I never understoof why people wear barrows armor for barrows and then prayer-flick anyway. If you are not taking damage than why do you need tank armor?
---
Lmao if you mean 1m gp in blood tunes and 20m cash this isn‚Äôt even that unreasonable. Pvmers accidentally bring stupid shit into the wild all the time. 
---
I'm surprised the hacker left you a whip 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure one of the mods said he meant to say 1/180. I‚Äôll try to find the comment

Only one I can do is oaks right now

Dyed his hair to much. Natural color is gone now. üòñ

So you can only check the health once the full growing time is up?

He'd be too busy nailing paper to the front of church buildings.

Exactly my point. You said you sold it for 585gp. You got considerably more than that. Sucks you lost so much but don‚Äôt try to make things out as worse than they are
---
Y'all are lame, and have no vision. They wouldn't have to look like that. Mainly just wanted OSRS themed barrows pets. Who wouldn't want a mini dharoks running around behind you.
---
this, this right here guys is the shit i'm here for
---
Thats what happened and what i was calling out. He tried to make it seem as if he only got 585gp
---
Damnnnnn those assholes took your Slayer helm too jeez 
---
I set morytania hard diary as one of my first 'mid/late game' goals and don't regret it one bit. 70 Prayer is an absolute necessity for the higher-end content. The agility thing can be boosted. All of the other requirements were pretty easy and/or fun. The rewards are great. 
---
All-in-all it gave me a lot of fulfillment so I can recommend it highly, even if it will take you a while. My next goal is karamja hard.
---
so its basically the diet coke of amulets?
---
srsly? after a week when new weaps was released, there were more than 5000 in game with less than 2000kc, what are you talking about "under the drop rate" please? please???????????????????????????????????
---
Masses are mostly stupid so they don't matter anyway.
---
Lmao, thanks for the giggle man.
---
Why does your game look different? It looks just like when I quit years ago, I want that back. 
---
What watch is this? I would like to buy one
---
Well, for starters, I wouldn't recommend posting pictures of your bank that include account information that hackers might have used in the first place ü§î

Do you buy the ultracompost? Some one suggested me to farm the watermelons for my own ultracompost, but it just seems like a huge slog.
---
Iron men stand solo
---
Try talking to him, see what he‚Äôs about 
---
It's slow compared to sgs/prayer methods but it's definitely convenient and cheap. 
---
Let's not assume everyone who is buying gold is doing it via rwt. A lot of players buy bonds and sell them.
---
These keys are from slayer, not fishing. Doesnt really matter when you open them, it will give you the same drop table no matter what, but i thought it would be fun to save up 50 at once
---
Don‚Äôt know dude, just saw it while scrolling yesterday. 
---
He reposted himself lol
---
Man I got 5 more quest points to kill the rfd boss and I just cba honestly and I'm level 98 too 
---
Runelite has an option that makes bones' left click option 'use' instead of 'bury'. I always carry only a burning amulet and one inventory of d bones. Go to altar and spamclick everything. It is so fast but you have less chance to spot PKers since you need to click a lot. However because it is so much faster the chance of a PKer showing up is very low.
---
And even if a PKer shows up, I can still continue mass offering bones and end up with at least half an inventory offered. Which was good enough in my book. All in all I usually had 6-7 runs of fully offered inventories for every time I got pk'ed. But I never got pk'd with more than 50% of my inventory still full.
---
guess the "too much login attempts" should also kick in on Bruteforce attacks
---
You can rwt via bonds and not break any rules. Someone has to buy them it might as well be cute noobs. 
---
What else what you use?
---
By your powers combined
---
My buddy has a def pure named dixynormous! Lol
---
Trouble brewing, wha'do'ya know! 
---
So would you consider all tiles are the same across worlds or are all tiles different for each world? If it‚Äôs the latter let‚Äôs hope you don‚Äôt logout.  On second thought what happens to the tile you‚Äôre on when you logout?  Is it the same one that you were on before or is it a completely different tile that load when you log in?
---
You have to be a pure or maxed to do this, right?
---
Possibly not fully sure of the logistics of creating it 
---
not if you're using a password manager
---
So it's doomed to be the ugliest piece of shit in the game?
---
I probably won't be getting it anyway but still sad.
---
I suppose so, but isn't it more usually orangey than yellow?
---
The 11$ meme has tranfered into the Apex legends subreddit. Neat.

It's like 4.5m right now. And just play the game, PvM can easily get you a couple mil an hour. Many skilling things can approach 1m/hr too.

---
I still want to see a karajma only account get an Inferno cape. That sounds like the ultimate hard mode
---
Because putting content into wildy which people will engage with unarmed, without retaliating to PK-ers is the way PK-ing will get fixed.
---
Sure.
---
smelly like envy
---
I never said it was. I said it is not meant to be top tier. There is a huge misconception everything that comes in has to be top tier. Drift net is a very similar concept to Konar but why does no one complain about that? Because no one gives a flying fuck about skilling in this subreddit.
---
What a ride! Sounds like you have quite the journey!
---
How is a 17 man team solo?
---
No. It devalues my "no carpet from Nardah to Sophanem" ironman.
---
Pretty sure that was the tuna that killed me the other day when I was killing chaos druids afk via mobile whilst I was at work.
---
I quite clearly was only wearing a dragon scimmy and this kid  did like 3 mage swaps into range. 
---
i made the switch over about a week and half ago- I've had zero problems with it so far.
---
I did switch to a brand new unique password before i made the change though, just to be safe
---
No body had mentioned having maxed skills, yes if you have certain maxed skills you can earn waayyyy more money for bossing, but the only stats being thrown about is this guys 86 range, what am I gonna tell him to go slayer n kill abysal demons or go farm the most expensive herbs or all the other highest level things you can do that earn the most money when all I know that he has is 86 range. Seems like you just wanted to whip you dick out on us lower levels, chill out mate I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd pk us all but I‚Äôm nowhere near a max skill as I‚Äôm sure most people who have life‚Äôs aren‚Äôt either
---
if you are a main account you can just passively get 99 ranged by using a cannon for slayer tasks. and maybe supplement with some blowpiping on things like demonic gorillas and hydra later game. That worked out for me :)
---
Ffa solo split at least :x

Your mentality of people getting out of the subreddit because of dissenting opinions is the reason why you get circlejerking and echo chambers like this in the first place.

Yes the move GE and dorito shit is bad as well. But they are usually gone within a few days.

He is not this much better. I wouldnt be surprised if he paid to make a few thousand bots just to upvote the memes himself. He is a good contenr creator and has been way before the snowflake UIM. His content is very similar to the others.

---
Did get hacked again?
---
I don‚Äôt believe they can nerf the blowpipe without having a negative impact from the community. 
---
I think *in the future* they‚Äôll just buff mage/melee to be more comparable with range, or create content that favors melee/mage &gt; range.
---
Then why do superiors in catacombs always drop a totem piece, despite being rarer than a Konar key?  This idea isn't bad, especially since Konar isn't worth doing bad tasks right now
---
Thought i was mega lucky at 27. Sick man.
---
Can you get a new task with NPC contact?
---
Trying to be funny but just a dingus I think. Also just get normal void 
---
Look up DPS calcs if you want to know what makes the biggest differences between different setups so you know what to upgrade. 
---
Personally i highly recommend dragon hunter Lance since its BIS for olm hand and a decent stab weapon overall.
---
Consider getting Elite void at some point since its really useful and its free. Its BIS at some rooms in Chambers and other places( Think of Theathre of blood, void setup is BIS without scythe). 
---
You know what gives me more dopamine than Slayer tomes? Audio tomes by audible
---
Not even a little bit, every game that's catered updates to player ideals has gone under. Add that to the fact that the poll system is starting to divide the community in a spiteful way and the polls are just going to cause more issues.
---
Can‚Äôt be getting hacked now can we?
---
Hmm good point, I hadn't considered that possibility, but I assumed OP meant you're being attacked by a single pker or you're in a single combat zone.
---
Anyway, I assume if you're getting PJed by a whole clan that this intimidation technique wouldn't work anyway and it would be better to run away than try to fight back. I don't often PK so I'm also not sure if you actually hit and get skulled if you hit secondary units with the barrage anyway. And I believe you can assume that the secondary target(s) will also have already tried to attack you and skulled themselves, so it's safe to fight back anyways.

Take my upvote

Stop humping the poor dog.
---
The blue cape doesn't pop as much.
---
I'm excited for next season's yellow cape.
---
The pmods are useless anyways because they won't even mute, they're like afraid to make a mistake and lose status or something. If I was a Pmod I would hop world's just to mute every single RNG HOST XX I saw.
---
Would love to check it out next time! 
---
Hey I got hacked for my bank collection too. Don‚Äôt give up
---
It proves you can show up and get your hand held. Especially in a field like comp sci if all you learned is what you're taught in class you're nearly worthless in the field. Something bring tedious and time consuming isn't the same as it being difficult.

&gt;I wish

I wish you could get good at zulrah

Make sure you showed the girl your rune defender before entering the basement

Q
---
Wow. I just started playing again. The Daxe is pennies compared to the Dpick. There wasn't a pick back when I played though. I started an Ironman a couple months ago. Isn't the only way to get the Daxe (short of buying it) to kill bosses? It was in wintertodt crates before but I hear the crates worth nothing now. Is the only way to get them through tough boss monsters? I'm only 64 combat... but the rune axe only going so far
---
100%
---
Yes, but you can‚Äôt cancel it until you go back to them if it‚Äôs a bad task 
---
Gambling laws lul
---
99 farming? Did he get it? 
---
How would it work if they sold for the appropriate price ( eg over max cash)? Split into two coin piles where you normally recieve items?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/nCbR07X](https://imgur.com/a/nCbR07X) 27 kills, got 85 slayer a few days ago =\]
---
Would be funny if its that stake website that a friend got so much hate for
---
even off task?
---
There is a threat showing where they came from. Ash made them spawn for a different Morytania locked Ironman.
---
Now this is the content I come here for 
---
You reposted a meme from 2 months ago about reposting a 2 month old meme, while simultaneously calling somebody out for reposting. I think I‚Äôm having a stroke.
---
Stop dad 
---
You can cancel it at my master though, like using contact to get a duradel task but you can cancel it with nieve
---
There's something very wrong about her foot and ankle. Her calf is massive too. And she has zero arm or shoulder gains despite being a slayer master?

If your goal is to complete the quest, youtube guides or wiki quick guides are great. Some people enjoy the dialogue and lore, so it might be a fun challenge to do it on your own. But will be slower
---
Isn‚Äôt it 1/128 *per kill* and 1/256 *per roll*? I‚Äôm not arguing with your math, just wondering if I‚Äôm misinformed. I have around 2.5k zulrah kc and have thought that the entire time. 
---
By having high skills, training, bossing, staking...just playing the game lol
---
We probably average 60k a raid in our trios 
---
(hit spacebar) /w 311 craws bow
---
works like half the time when somebody at revs is getting every rev to 1/3 then hopping to the next
---
Very nice. See it as motivation to train some FM and getting good ranged gear. 
---
&gt; a friend started buying xp from lvl 1, basically wasting most of the value.
---
He didn't though. He manually leveled to 40-50 in most of the skills for that reason.
---
&gt; Buying xp is way more efficient at high level because of the scaling
---
Efficient how? Probably not in overall time. What he spent $20k on would have taken 6-700 EHP. How long does that take your average RS player to make? 1000 hours? 2000?
---
In effort? Maybe, but you still have to earn all that money, and as I said before, you could just buy a maxed account, even on OSRS for WAY less. Or you could just pay someone to manually level your account. $20k for ~800 hours playing the game I love seems like a damn good deal to me.
---
&gt; spending money is OP and devalues the effort of people actually playing.
---
But how? "Devalues my effort" is a meme, but does it really? Buffing an exp rate makes the time you spent previously seem partially wasted, but adding MTX doesn't have that effect, because I'm not paying all that money, just to skip over the game. And I assume the vast majority of people wouldn't either. We play games to have fun. Why would you pay money to skip over actually playing it?
---
But some people absolutely would pay that money just to have a maxed account. Ignoring all the ways they could *already* do that, how does that really effect any of us? We're not racing to 200m all, and worried about someone else paying their way to a high rank. Does just buying a max cape really effect us in ANY way?
---
There's loads of people with max capes already, it doesn't make them better at the game. They're not going to be any better at PVM or PVP. They didn't "win", making us "lose", there's not a limited supply here. So how does it really effect us if someone else has a nice thing?
---
But back to the main point, if people can already spend that money to get a maxed account, I'd much rather that money goes back into the game.
---
Has to be a problem your end because for me it‚Äôs absolutely fine. Iphone 6S
---
Thanks man! Very much appreciate the support &lt;3
---
Is it just a coincidence that the items which have supposedly been taken from your back add up roughly to a full inventory (judging by the placeholders with a 0 next to them) ? And is it just a coincidence that you've posted about this exact same thing happening to you in the past? 
---
Exactly my point lol
---
I'm sorry being called out for being wrong triggered *you* this hard
---
Get better at securing yourself on the internet.
---
The way questing was intended.
---
Weeeeell I did edit his 2 month old meme about reposting a 2 month old meme, something he didn't personally do (No Konar on the interface)
---
Well you need 2 things.
---
* A fan base that donates to you.
---
* Good rng at the sand casino.
---
Duel arena staking.
---
Just like I post on this question when it‚Äôs asked 5 times a day...
---
Jagex said too few players would benefit from it. It‚Äôs a very niche community and they don‚Äôt want to give dev time to make like 250 people happy lol
---
Cause totem pieces are rarer than Konar and it‚Äôs not an instant roll for free loot where often u make 100-400k. I just don‚Äôt think we need to increase the opportunity for free shit without putting work in for it. I feel like ppl see the late game pvm content and how much money an hour it is and then want close to that for doing simple low level shit. Slayer is good money already so I don‚Äôt think u need to be making anymore money off it.
---
Yeah I need it. Why u mad. Ironman btw
---
Either you are new to the game or you forgot why everyone stopped playing RS3. 
---
woops yeah, sry missread (never done the boss myself) :o   
---
That puts him among the 1/20 most unlucky people..
---
I'm still waiting for the hot take
---
Mine iron in the mining guild. Even if you get two rocks to yourself, you can get 60k xp/hr and bank the iron for decent money 
---
Very deep meme, respect
---
Lmao I came up with this same idea on my drive home last night. Well done
---
Haveibeenpwned only shows emails I think. You have to pay to get access on weleakinfo.com
---
Wow thanks for the tips. I'm currently following an extensive quest guide which is helping a lot.
---
Yes they had you link an email so that you could login to the main site but somehow my email got lost in limbo 
---
Hopefully my ToB teacher is doing learners so I can get one or two in and learn a few aspects a bit better.
---
Should do some slayer on both the main and the pure as well.
---
This is a spam account that has cropped up recently. They post a link to their profile where they have the knock off website posted under the same title. 
---
They are also weird to say the least
---
I see brainlet, I upvote
---
I think it's pretty likely honestly. Content releases have been very focused on filling in black squares/unused areas. The only two remaining after 2019 will be the desert and varlamore afaik. I think its more likely they choose the desert over yet another zeah expansion so soon.
---
Practicing multishines on netplay.
---
What would happen if you DC in the wildy? You just stand there ingame til you die? What about 6 hour log? This doesnt seem like a viable option. Also, deep wildy pking relies on hopping for it toe xist as the wildy is simply too big and there are too many worlds for you to be able to stick to one world and get enough kills. 
---
Lmk if i misunderstood your post, not a pker btw
---
Thanks mom üíù
---
Misleading how?
---
BiG
---
btw
---
Is this your first meme cycle in 2007scape? Damn dude I envy you. If you‚Äôre logic was correct we‚Äôd still be rallying in 366 in desert robes after the pride event. 
---
This circlejerk is literally nothing compared to the shit fiesta that week was... 
---
Just like fax machines, ha.
---
One of my alts is named PumpyDumpler. Didnt even know these guys existed, gonna have to go bro out with them
---
And OP claiming it to be his can of tuna. Smh..
---
smash bros?? only real veterans have rs on disk
---
No it really isn't. With 80 base melees, budget melee gear, you can 3:30-4:00 kill vorkath. News flash thats better profit than 75/75ing zulrah. And you get out of the budget tier within 200 kills so it's not bad advice, its the god tier route out of poverty and into the money making.
---
Did i say it wasn‚Äôt fun to use? No. Did i say i was against it? No. What comment did you read?
---
Misleading in that, just like the previous "record holder", the account was stacked with shit so it was a cookie cutter 99. 
---
I can't get excited about that. 
---
Ah yes I realized like a week ago there's still part of zeah missing. I have had a tiny break for a while, so Im OOTL about this part of zeah you mentioned. What do they have in plans for it, if any? 
---
Don't always do the most efficient activity, do the activity which you find enjoyable
---
Yup, it's a shame but never trust people on the internet. Now I'll trust you with my credit card info:  
---
&gt;!What did I just tell you?!&lt;  
---
&gt;!Jeez!&lt;  &gt;!man!&lt;
---
So just to clarify, you‚Äôre shit talking a guy for a game you don‚Äôt even play anymore? ...cool
---
Well being a new player tends to mean your account is shit too.
---
You should check out my sick obby cape bro
---
Jagex worked incredibly hard over two decades to prove that they are incompetent when it comes to decision making for their games.
---
For starters, they ruined literally runescape's most successful era of all time (2011) by updating it into the ground with EoC and MTX. Looking at their publishing page, the majority of recognizable IP's have had a similar fate, either being updated way to much and alienating the original crowd that made the IP originally have value (Runescape 2, Ace of Spades) or it was a formerly popular thing that they failed to maintained adequately and have since closed (Fun Orb).
---
*Even Jagex knows their reputation*. That's why when OSRS was being announced, Jagex was like "No, you guys don't get it. We're literally not allowing ourselves to make decisions this time" and everyone who quit because of EoC rejoiced.
---
Also, I think it's important to highlight that OSRS wasn't created in a bubble. It was created from RS2's ashes. This game wouldn't be nearly as successful if pre-squeel RS2 was still around.
---
I honestly don't believe that Jagex is competent enough to run this game without community input. I think that it is more likely than not that they will eventually ruin this game with updates if they stop polling. You'd have to have stockholm-syndrome or some shit to expect different given the track record.
---
That's not to say I dislike the actual OSRS devs, just to be clear.
---
3.
---
Im not shit talking I said he was really cool?
---
I‚Äôm 110 combat with two maxed accs we do flawless runs every time idk lol
---
Low quality 
---
That‚Äôs the shit I like
---
fuck off.
---
Stop attacking my thread. 
---
demonic gorillaz have 380 hp but give 408 xp. pretty efficient
---
Ripppp thst makes me feel better hahaha
---
Add kpop profile pictures as well. 
---
Now I don‚Äôt have to bitch as muchüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Stolen thread*
---
Please tell me this was the roleplaying server lol
---
I really think this shouldnt affect us, even though in reality it probably is the reason why we cant get some content ealier. Such as priff or menaphos.. Im going to be so hyped to finally see finished map though
---
No there isn't. His reply is saying that BCP isn't even that much better than torso.
---
For real, people have been screaming "melee best smash" since melee. It's not a new opinion
---
Block iron+steel dragons 100%
---
RS YT content has been so stagnant and boring for YEARS now. Its just so god damn refreshing that somebody's actually pushing the envelope and thinking outside of the box for the first time in literally 5 years.
---
Well you were in the designated PvP area of the game..
---
Hey I'm in the picture
---
new bis pvp armor nice
---
hard to tell from the picture but whoever set them up did so in the shape of a swastika lol
---
"ugly" okay pal
---
Your steps are literally just make money to train range/mage until u can kill Zulrah and Vorkath... then raid. Thanks?
---
So how do you expect them to get base 80s in melee stats if they spend all their time training range to kill brutal blacks?
---
What did you do to make money? Just curious since your stats don't give it away... Mainly pvm or something alike? Anyways good luck at CoX :) 
---
I thought you were the op lol? Calm your tits
---
go to your quest tab and click the purple icon. You should see it there.
---
From my red dead redemption experience snake oil increases dead eye time there it should provide an attack boost. This post is a fraud! 
---
One of my favorite places to train back in the day was chaos elder druids, msb (i) and rune arrows. Its fucking great cuz u don't need food, will always be prayed + potted, and decent loot. 
---
Next time he‚Äôll go out and cut all the logs, fletch the logs, mine and Smith the dart tips, then speed fletch to 99. That‚Äôll be exciting 
---
LOL sure. More copy pasted "epic tr0llz" responses.
---
Maybe get a personality of your own instead of building it based entirely on edgy internet culture
---
Not misleading at all.
---
He got 99 fletching in 3 hours 9 minutes. There is nothing misleading about that at all. It didn‚Äôt mention *how* he got fletching in the title. Your expectations not being satisfied by the post is the fault of your reading comprehension, not an error in the title.
---
I mostly looked stuff up myself and probably did it very unneficiently so you probably wont struggle
---
Assuming you play a decent ammount every day
---
Good luck man
---
Maybe add a delay to logging out and a delay before you are able to attack someone once you log in (unless they attack you of course) even 10-15 sec would allow pkers to hit someone attempting to log and people would at least have a chance to escape clans
---
*it's almost like it's subjective*
---
Wanna feel a little better? The first item was an ancestral hat.. lmao
---
Probably due to people trying to flip food
---
did you expect some ironman account to farm the items and get 99 in 3 hours?
---
Idk maybe some youtuber build a pure or something to kill the Venezuelan bots. Thanks for saying something to aggregate to the post, have a nice day.
---
Should give 1 prayer bonus though.
---
The clue count didn't start over when the collection log was released.  That information was already in the game since highscores even tracks it.
---
Well it‚Äôs tough when they quit before they hit level 3 in all skills.
---
No need to nerf it. It costs a lot to use it should be powerful 
---
Nah
---
&gt; Well it‚Äôs tough when they *die* before they hit level 3 in all skills.
---
FTFY
---
Good consideration! 
---
Ey I saw u at the get yesterday and was confused af lol
---
Oh.. sorry, in that case.
---
I just burst out laughing at my desk
---
Dunno but wouldn't recommend because obor can easily 1 hit you and if you die you lose the cannon
---
I was using adamant arrows on a guard and this guy picked them up when the collected on the ground. Can you help me with that?
---
Blast furnace and herb runs will make you over a mil in an hour so there you go. non-bossing skilling for ez money
---
&gt;who bird dis is
---
I think the high volume buys you lose a little gp per alc, which is I think acceptable compared to alternative afk methods like splashing  
---
really depends on your bank for how much of a gp loss you're willing to take   
---
Or put in a trade at night to see if you can low-ball an item that will let you go even or slightly positive.    
---
My mission for the weekend:

Gotta get em done finally to complete multiple hard diaries. Finally biting the bullet.

It's simple, gnomes are just better mages than humans.

Too soon

It's not even updated to the Krystilia one, either.

What is dead my never die.

Happy cake day, sir

This is how I lost my graceful. I almost lost the will to play after that. Almost

Holy shit I‚Äôve always thought that Karambwan were some kind of urchin
---
Off-brands tend to have very flimsy warranties, not worth the risk imo since you'll still be shoveling out a fair amount of coin.
---
That said, I also have the Secret Labs Titan and it's is literally the most comfortable desk chair I've ever used. I went with them over any other brand because the Titan was made for larger people and I'm 6"2 and weigh 235lbs, I didn't realize it was the first chair I sat in that was meant for my size and hooollly does it make a difference. I fall asleep in it pretty regularly tbh. 12/10 Secret Labs will always have my endorsement.
---
Oh, I thought you had to be on task to use the relleka dungeon.
---
Dude you only paid 23$ for ssbm?!
---
Not everyone trains those skills for those reasons. Some people have fun through achieving their goals and being productive. They're enjoying it. If your outlook on runescape is that it's a time waste instead of enjoying playing a game then you should probably find something more fulfilling to spend your time on.
---
How else is he going to do it within a reasonable time..?
---
WHO BIRD DIS IS
---
lvl 2 magic thanks
---
It doesn't seem like you suck at the game, but suck at basic research... How the fuck so you not even attempt to go online and research this a bit????
---
No slayer helm.
---
See? You cant type without trying to insult me. It‚Äôs not about sensitivity, it‚Äôs about you contradicting yourself.
---
Oh, so the game just didn't count pets and monster drops before release? So the only previously stored info was clues?
---
Thats some real dedication.
---
Yeah well that's definitely possible.  Would you find it ironic that they all have the same (if not very close in stats) and have really weird usernames? 
---
I would lean towards them being bots rather than being actual players.
---
I agree however RWT is not going to be an issue that can be stopped so... they can bot on I guess
---
I have she says i have proven myself already by showing her the defender.. almost on 7 hours now
---
Add staking to the Burthorpe games room.
---
Are you sure you want to sell 3 Tarromin seeds for 1 gp?
---
Are you sure you want to sell 2 Mithril platebodies for 1 gp?
---
Are you sure you want to sell 18 guam leaf for 1 gp?
---
We couldn't just go by percentage, it would have to be percentage + a minimum value of like 1m or something
---
If you‚Äôre truly interested in members I will give you your first bond.
---
Veos is just south of the pub in port sarim. 
---
Am I the only one who finds this to be very sad and pathetic? Probably 
---
Actually pretty reasonable. If someone told me I could get a 99 in 4 hours but it'd cost me 90m I'd be sold. Too bad it's gotta be fletching.
---
ive seen p mods blatantly ignore the bots at g.e, they should lose status imo.
---
Where do you stand during south mage phase? Are you ising a tbow? I stand next to the pillar but have to move 1 tile nort and longrange with bp.
---
LOL 
---
it's a no no if you are a gp buyer like you because you'll end up bankrupt irl lol
---
No, red cape bad. Blue cape good. 
---
Or is it connectivity? Fuck. 
---
ajeh is maxed rank 29 overall with 8 200M skills and he has a kid LOL 
---
Gp/task is irrelevant.
---
Cave Kraken boss is a really high gp/task boss, however it is still considered bad because of bad Xp and gp/hour (makes up for it with afk).
---
The keys are based on total level, and with most task they are rarer than 1/100.
---
So typically, you should be getting 1 or 2 keys per task.
---
Thats 210k per task of a monster that could drop nothing, have low xp AND takes a while to finish, such as jellies in Relekka (which have a high task weight on konar).
---
From another perspective, take nieve. If Nieve assigns a monster, you can choose how to kill it from speed to cash with barrage or a cannon (dependingly on the task) which will greatly boost your xprates and shorten task time.
---
Shortening the task time leads to more xp/hr and more points/hr (because more tasks/hr).
---
As for points, konar is not spectacular points because of long tasks and alot of potential skips. However, you can still use Konar every 10 tasks to get the point boost.
---
Runecraftig next boyo 
---
If you were in mobile you probably dropped it. I dropped my full graceful in mobile because I forgot to turn off the tap to drop lol.
---
You
---
Scary how my brain is filled with RuneScape knowledge that will be of zero help in my adult life. I know more about the game than I know about life rofl
---
In my opinion respectively, it would be stupid to have kurask/cockatrice/basalisk slayer helms or pets as these are relatively "lower level" slayer monsters that are farmed for low-med gp per hour 
---
1/3,000 means it's extremely rare and your RNG is wild that day but justifying slayer helms or pets with the fact that Arceuus spellbook only provides 1k prayer exp per head is kind of absurd imo.
---
I laughed 
---
For real dude (that's if you're not doing 3+1, 4+1, etc)

Yeah it took me like 3 days lol good luck man
---
What other games have polls like osrs? 
---
What about the max Fire cape?
---
Melee slayer with piety is well over 30k/hr, if you're getting 10k then I assume you're like base 60 combat stats, in which case literally afk sand crabs for a couple of days.
---
That's not the point you brainlet lmao. He doesn't care he got killed for 2k. He's saying it's a bit dumb to say gf to someone afk wearing nothing but a scimmy
---
In his defence, locking yourself in a giant swamp can get lonely.
---
not what i wanted to hear lol thank you
---
Actually he's botting
---
If you can afford 99 con you can afford a new vehicle every day to work right
---
When you have done Monkey madness 2 and Nieve is fucking dead
---
He has the ability to portray his personality through music choice, clip selection and special effects. Most YouTubers just talk over progress
---
Move one square to the west and you can use rapid with bp 
---
If it is only utilized by f2p it‚Äôs pretty useless overall. The price of a prayer pot is roughly 10k and it‚Äôll recharge a full prayer stat most likely. Would have to be cheaper. 
---
Stay on the scene *(get on up)*  like a flax machine *(get on up)*
---
Yep, just trying to get these people banned
---
That's kinda different if you ask me, considering it requires you to fkin max out..? You're not gonna see it everywhere and is not just some buyable cosmetic
---
you are clearly the loser here for wnating to be an instagram influencer and buying rsgp and be bored of rs...
---
Check out "Galaxy Clan" cc in-game, they'll direct you to the Discord if you feel like joining. Pretty laid-back clan that's active with different bossing, raids, and even events and bond giveaways.
---
Tell them "Sensual Gaze" sent ya :p
---
130k players btw
---
Ban wobbling
---
I can do it but it requires a level of concentration I'm not up for.
---
I think the recommendations that you have are interesting...
---
&gt; Wearing this to fight Vorkath or Kalphite Queen might increase the chance to get the pet or something. 
---
(IMO) A: This wouldn't really make sense, why would farming a certain monster (with a pet drop rate of 1-3k, 1-4k, 1-5k) be **lowered** by having an outfit that provides a increased chance of receiving the pet drop?  First of all, that would be **a lot** of engine work/devs needed to work on that which Jagex as they have stated many times they can't afford to put something into the game that requires a lot of dev time 
---
&gt; such as the ability to fight Basilisks without the need for a mirror shield, or double the spawn rate of a Greater Abyssal Demon while fighting abby demons. 
---
Mirror shield has been around forever, there's nothing wrong with it and shouldn't have to change this due to Arceuus spellbook lol. // Double spawn rate of Greater Abyssal Demons? That is also just bruh.
---
You rock, thanks!
---
Look at that bowl cut and weak chin. 
---
Same lol. But if you haven't killed Galvek yet, I honestly thought he was easier than Vorkath with no salve.  Even the mith, addy, and rune dragons were harder Imo.  
---
Not usually polls, more of it's things like people bitching on social media and the devs listening, implement the updates people asked for and it breaks the game so they bitch more and break it more.
---
Get outta my swamp.
---
[it is done](https://i.imgur.com/oCwQ9cE.png)

Take a seat, dear.

I followed the same link you did. And then saw that you said repost on the original post instead of the repost
---
/u/Mod_ash has already confirmed that once you use one vorkath head onto a ranging cape, all ranging capes will be affected (whether that be in your inventory or in your bank, doesn't matter)
---
&gt;I average 1m each slayer task
---
Do you skip half your tasks? The only decent money tasks I get are Dust devil, Skeletal/Fossil wyverns, Aberrant spectres and maybe Kurasks. Haven't gotten a Gargoyle task yet.

maxed tutorial island acc probably

This sub is the last place I thought I'd hear that name.
---
Your move, /u/Michael_RS .

good things its not. im very close to maxing and a very minor amount of my wealth is from bossing

Harambe used protect from melee instead of protect from ranged by accident. Must have been a misclick. RIP.

Why?

It counts pets before the collection log release. The only thing it doesn't track is anything tradeable. So when collection log came out, stuff that was already in there are pets, boss heads, boss jars, etc. The KCs for bosses and clues are accurate, but not the drops. So all of these 49 items were obtained after the collection log came out, but the clue count includes the time before the log

TBH this just makes the human wizards look like absolute dipshits. The people at wizard tower look like they know a thing or two about magic, and I always thought they're supposed to be the "old and wise" -type. Even the Dark Wizards wear the same clothing, just in different colour. Yet some gnome living in a tree has a fashion store that sells better magical equipment, that's FIT FOR HUMANS, not even the gnomes themselves. The gnome isn't even a magician, he focuses on FASHION, yet he still manages to surpass the folks at wizard tower and Delrith's circle when it comes to gear.
---
I mean how poor are those human wizards? Absolutely clueless people

Yes. From world 300 onwards are the oldschool worlds. We refer to them by number for short. 
---
Tbh the only reason Konar has a lot of "potential skips" for people is because they're denying the entire point of the slayer master and that was the fact that the tasks are in niche locations in order to revitalize dead-content areas of the game and bring back a sense of life and wonderment to the world.
---
Also like I said other masters can be better xp/gp per hour for some people, I'm just relaying my experience that Konar has been significantly more gp/hr than anyone else.
---
Obviously, gnomes are the superior race 
---
Lots and lots of profit slayer tasks. I also started doing a lot of brutal black dragons when mobile came out.
---
if you've got high combat stats and aren't afraid of PvM, Zulrah shits out money.

If you're not a high level, Barrows is stupid easy and can be done with cheap gear, and you've got a pretty decent chance at some 1mil+ items
---
Pets already have their own tab. It's in the 'other' category. 
---
If you have decided that you don't want to collect pets then why does it matter if they're in the boss logs or not? 
---
It's just a record of drops, there's no prize or reward for completing it. 
---
If you've made a personal choice as to what you want to collect it shouldn't matter if the collection log says something else. 
---
Why the fuck would someone bring tabs into the wildy???? That dude deserved to get those yanked from him. 
---
Yep it‚Äôs how we all learn. Also when you decide you want a rune pouch don‚Äôt buy a ton of tier 1s for the points like I did. There are trustworthy clans that will let you get tier 9s for a much smaller fee and will yield more points. A lot of them will even provide a middle man in case you‚Äôre worried about trust trading.

Holy shit dude I said you were mad in the first comment, thinking you were op and making a post whining about gmaul.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre truly risking nothing you have no reason to be out there‚Äù
---
*what?*
---
You know what, maybe OP finds it fun to do Konar and see what he gets from the chest, and isn't worried about being 100% max efficiency all the time? People forget that Runescape is a game and you're meant to have fun. Some people don't like killing X to make money just because it's efficient. 
---
I could have done Scabrites to train my ranged and get 100k XP/h and close to 1m GP/h but I didn't find that fun in the slightest. Instead I killed Shamans for less than half the XP/h and roughly 200k GP/h on average but the chance of a DWH was exciting so it was a lot more fun. I was rewarded with a DWH after a little over 500 kills.

A keyboard warrior? If you think that‚Äôs being a keyboard warrior then i do not envy you, sir.
---
I mean.... Define "meant to be played". Cause there are quest dialogues where the npc pokes fun at the fact that you have all the shit he was gonna ask for already.
---
That's not how the GE works though. He even stated in the comments that he averaged 9.9M from the 150 sold. Even if you put a sell offer in at 1gp, it will sell for the highest buy offer available that meets your sell price.

How can I request Jagex to create a new item in game? Everytime I post it I get attention. It entails a higher leveled agility gear (top and legs) which would function identically to a full graceful outfit in effect and weight. This would allow for higher level and max level players to wear their max capes and other pieces of armor without losing that full graceful effects because you don't have the gloves or you dont have the hood,etc. Requires 75-80 agility (or whatever is decided).
---
Much better.
---
The only way you will get it is if someone makes a sell offer for 1gp and there is not a single other buy offer active higher than yours and your buy offer is the oldest 1gp buy offer active. Good luck.

I did nearly all of 55 slayer at sulicep mushrooms. You get really fast fossils and then trade them in for xp lamps. Requires 65 wc and fossil island unlocked tho.

Clues being called ‚Äúreward‚Äù is maybe the funniest thing I‚Äôve heard all day. I‚Äôve probably lost more in spades than I‚Äôve gotten in reward from wildy clues.

I‚Äôm not really sure where you‚Äôre going with this. Just because someone isn‚Äôt risking fucking bank in the Wildy doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not gonna be a bit pissed when they die.

"Relax cc" posted on here the other day. It is sounds like what you're looking for.

IDK bro let me just time travel and find out.
---
Anecdotal and unlikely to happen to a large majority of players. This is a potential fix for a large group of players for the cost of a 0.1% situation.
---
Even right now you stand still for 5 minutes until the game logs you out. I'd guess if it was implemented, it would make you path back out of the Widly after a set amount of time. I don't have all the answers. 
---
Swampletics
---
I wouldn't mind a "Boss Pet" category like they did for Skilling Pets, but there is already an All Pets. But I don't think Pets should be excluded from bosses just because they are rare; they are a unique to that boss. Nothing gets checked off or such for completing a category, so if you have all but pet and don't want to go for the pet, it makes little difference.
---
Someone made fun of me for using a rune scimitar instead of a bribe saver. People get invested in strangers‚Äô gear. It‚Äôs honestly hilarious.

5-10 min, 8 patches, torstols = 150-250k for such low effort is why I do herb runs, even at 99 farming. It all adds up :)

In my mind I ask how the hell players risk that much. Did that once myself without thinking. Thankfully I noticed and logged out and went f2p to have less chance? At pkers and banked my gear which counted for 80% of my bank and went back lol

like this isnt clear racism, you brainlet.

---
ok racist piece of shit
---
Path back out? Theres absolutely no way jagex will implement that in the game. You dont have all the answers because there are no answers to these problems. Your proposal rules out deep wildy pking as a viable way to play. The cost to benefit of content like revs factor in being pked by clans and such. If it werent worth it, nobody would do it
---
I was secretly hoping that the dagger was gonna get swiped by the visafe thief when you took the screenshot. :x
---
About 55 attack, 60 strength, 50 def
---
I think that was the whole point, this was all supposed to be ironic.
---
logging in under people at chaos altar is a retarded idea for most pkers because its a hotspot and multizone, they'll die 9/10 times before they can get prot item up if there's people there
---
Definetly invest time on getting the torso.
---
Also dont take book switch for range. Generally nobody has a book switch, and use a defender on any combat style to save an inventory slot. 
---
Then don‚Äôt go there? People post on here all the time about getting hundreds of mills from 3rd age items from clues that most likely took them into the wilderness. That‚Äôs a risk to losing what could potentially be a massive reward. Just because your rng is crap doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else‚Äôs is too. 
---
Fact is, people do risk stuff when they‚Äôre naked in the wildly enough that it‚Äôs worth killing anyone. And if it‚Äôs an easy kill, why not? If you‚Äôre that worried about surviving bring some gear, fight back, and plan a better escape. 
---
I considered this, but then this leaves out PVM balance such as lava drags and bossing which are still left to benefit from dysfunctional combat logging mechanics.
---
Is this the best comeback you got? You let a friend of you stake for you, which either went wrong by getting scammed, or by losing the stake. Hence not having a tent yourself.
---
It's supposed to be ironic I am pretty sure.

I have made one post on the weekly qna suggestion post but that one time I never had any likes or replies back. Every other time I posted about it people liked it and commented on how good an idea it is. I fear my idea will be unheard or swept under the rug and not be implemented on or around the future elven expansion. I feel that future elven expansion would be a perfect time to incorporate superior agility gear given the strong connection of agility/higher agility with the elves.
---
I will keep on trying and post again on the qna if I catch it. Other than that, I have no other sources of social media to contact Jagex. Thanks for hearing me and the suggestions! I will keep trying!

I always bring a bgs and spec the pkers. A group of them called me a pest once even though I never attacked. I just let auto retaliate do the work.

No, if they needed to wait 10-15 seconds to log out they won't have time to log. Even if the clicked log out thr second they saw a white dot, they could be attacked first.

Lol I used to grief in games when I was a kid too
---
I'd personally recommend selling it.
---
It's one of those items that will just continually drop in price over time.  Since it's still relatively new, the price is much higher than it will be down the line.
---
Conversely, the other user has a point.  If you're already doing a lot of farming runs all the time, the bucket will save you a considerable amount of money on compost.  This could outweigh the profit from selling it and buying it back.
---
Personally, I got a bucket at 1 kc and immediately sold it for 3m.  I plan on buying it back if it ever dips below 1m.  
---
I once found a world where there were 5 other people offering bones. Together we had 4 dds, a whip, and an ags

Congratulations

Accurate gives +3 attack/range
---
Aggressive gives +3 strength
---
Defensive gives +3 defence

Rapid makes your attacks one tick faster.

Long range increases attack range by 2 squares and gives defence experience.

After a long break I came back this past weekend and realized the same. The organization and focus on efficiency OSRS brings with it helps me focus and brings new perspective to how easy some real-life things are if I just focus on them.

Theres still Elve quest and the city and Warding. So 2 major updates still on their way. So I guess maybe may for elve city.

It‚Äôs going to keep dropping for a while. Sell it now buy it later. 
---
Dude just stop trying to argue with these simps, they are getting mad over "spoilers" of a fucking ironman series
---
Imagine getting worked up over someone reuploading their own OC
---
Other games are for procrastination and easy dopamine but I genuinely have time for runescape. Discipline.
---
disgusting
---
I agree with the other user, it seems highly unlikely to allow existing ironmen to band together.  
---
Plus, that instantly devalues any prestige that other group ironmen might have since anything they could eventually grind to together would have already been done by people who just decided to team up the day it comes out.
---
Furthermore, I don't want to discourage you, but group ironman is probably not going to happen.  I was very excited about the concept since it removes a fair amount of apprehension from the ironman experience.  Yet, I don't hold out for it, because I understand it is a very serious job that will require a large amount of effort/time and for those reasons I just doubt that it will happen, especially not very soon.
---
Nobody cares, and stop censoring half your screen, shit looks like absolute cancer
---
We clearly have very different friends.
---
Make sense, I do need the money now, seem like this item will keep dropping until everyone have a bucket

I was recently in the same boat. If you are doing Seer's Village it should only take you 2-3 days for Agility. Thieving if you find a nice world with someone splashing the Ardougne Knight you could do it in a day. Also keep in mind boosts for some of those hard diaries.

By the time an account can do wyverns, I don‚Äôt think you can possibly be considered low level. 72 slayer may not seem like much, but that can easily take a very long time. If you want to help low levels, I don‚Äôt think this was the way to do it.

Agility carries over into f2p as more run energy
---
You should‚Äôve just given them your shovel dude that‚Äôs all they were after 
---
Look up a barrows guide. Switching between that and slayer will make you combat exp and more money than youd think over time.
---
I disagree, even with a carpet from Nardah to Menaphos, sceptre will still be much faster, as you can teleport there from anywhere, it wouldn't really de-value the sceptre, and it would make sense to add this carpet ride option.
---
Looks more like a type B
---
All I'm saying is that I've never seen a gnome wearing ancestral. Between Anc and Ahrim's I guess modern wizards are shit but past ones know how to make some mage gear.
---
USE HARD MODE! Their stats (specifically their defence) stay the same except for their hit point which is a little over double, but you get up to 37 times as many points.
---
For example, Count Draynor gives 43 points in Normal mode, but up to 1588 points in Hard mode, so you spent double the time for 37x the points. Definitely worth it.
---
I've AFK'ed nightmare zone about 4-5 hours every other day for the past month, I'm at 10m points after imbuing all my equipment and buying thousands of pots.
---
Your combat level is perfect, I was averaging 100-200k points an hour with under level 70 combat stats. Just make sure you are gaining at least 70k+ exp an hour in the combat skill you are training, if you aren't then you aren't killing the bosses fast enough.
---
Also, this is a direct quote from the wiki:
---
&gt;Point values increase based on the number of bosses included.
---
I have 2 in 6 kc. Rip bucket marchers. 
---
Hard mode will more than double your points. But Id recommend adding in dt and rfd bosses. They‚Äôre not too bad besides an ice gloves and ranged switch and if you get gelatinoth mother you just leave her till ultimate force spawns. Also use absorption‚Äôs instead of prayer if you add them. 
---
&gt;It's fun getting ya'll angry.
---
Note how I said that in reference to your above response. 
---
If you're PKing people to specifically try and get an emotional rise from them rather than for loot, you're griefing.

I used to do the same on minecraft when I was younger then on rust etc

When leveling up melee combat, is it best to keep attack, strength, and defense all the same level (I‚Äôm lvl 57 in all of them)? Or is it better to level up strength a few above them?

"Checking the health" is the action that you do to claim the experience from fully growing it.

God damn im 500kc and still no drops didnt realise i was quite so unlucky
---
The spear is good at corp as the hasta does less damage to corp.  
---
  
---
Even on task void + salv(ei) is better for vorkath. You need to get that ammy enchanted AND imbued. 
---
Hi
---
Any update? 
---
You're playing OSRS
---
I don't know what you expected
---
Never works though, you‚Äôre just filling the sub with crap
---
I mean the whole point of scepter is being able to skip the inconvenient travel alternatives so it would devalue it. I have a scepter just for those two hard clue steps, if there was a free alternative that you click once and afk for a minute then that kinda takes away from the scepter being as useful as it is (though it's already pretty niche).
---
Fastest 99.
---
I've done the math. Mith darts are slightly slower at a significantly lower cost than msb with rune arrows.
---
No reason to take it personal mate

Or negative 1 prayer

The best is clearly Cockatrice... But if you only get one, I'd say KBD or Hydra would look the nicest.

If you bring tank ranged gear and pray mage, you basically don‚Äôt get hit while kiting Sara. I think you‚Äôll find Zammy on par with Bandos

Yeah sorry I meant (ei)

 So what exactly is the use of the Hasta?
---
&gt;I don't care about it, it's part of the game.

There is an item like this in the game already...

It‚Äôs called the infernal cape

Tales of the righteous or something. The one that gives +10% shayzien favour :)
---
Haha What A Funny Meme Karen!!
---
Much Love, John
---
Sent from my iPhone.
---
Tbh, been doing clues like forever and never met pkers at clue spots, If you doing them on over 1k word without clue box, I think its kinda your fault you got pked 
---
It is cheaper than the current membership prices. If you have grandfathered rates, it can cost more; they were pretty upfront about that this year. Also, it likely only has 1 Year option because Premier Club ended in Jan but they kept it going because it was popular.
---
Bandos was ez, I actually just shit on his day.
---
I'd get attack to 60 so you can use dragon weaponry. Then get your str/def up to 60 as well. I'd then get str/att to 70 so you can use a whip, then use whip to get to 70 defence and train controlled from there.  
---
You can do it however you want, that's just my suggestion.
---
The two best games of all time.
---
You are a retard. As stated above and as is true. The ge sells to the oldest bidder and its not always the highest bid. Say you put in a sell offer for 10gp like you said. Say a month ago someone put an offer in for 1000gp, and another person put an offer in for 5000 three days ago. The oldest bid gets the item as they've had the offer in longer. Just because the other pwrsons price is higher doesnt mean it will go to them. 
---
Tales of the righteous I think. Shayzien favour quest :)
---
So this is a f2p only update? Seems wasteful. ‚ÄúFuck f2p‚Äù
---
Wormbrain (the goblin in Port Sarim jail) has Lozar (the female survivor)'s map piece. During the quest the goblins talk about a raiding party, it resulted in her death. 
---
The wiki covers it if you search for Lozar, in case you wanted to read a little more into it. :)
---
Okay, folks, first of all, thanks for all the support!

My next show will be tomorrow, Saturday the 16th, 21.00 GMT in Falador Party Room. The world of choice will be 371. Bring some (in game) ale, wine or anything else that would suit the occasion! Hope to see you there!

What does this sub have against OSBuddy? Kind of new and was wondering which to get

Haha, thanks for the gold, I hope you don't think I have anything against you personally, you make some good memes, I just saw and oppertunity and kinda jumped on it.
---
Hello, is there anybody in there?
---
You can spend gp to get carried thru - otherwise go there and make a team - kick the shitters 
---
Eh, I still disagree, you can make alternative ways of doing things without nerfing the current best way. 
---
If you compare the sceptre to a glory, the destination to edgeville, and the carpet to the tunnel shortcut at the G.E., people that have glories will still use that to teleport directly to Edgeville from anywhere they want in just a click. The alternative is teleporting to varrock/G.E., and running through the tunnel and over. It's cheaper but slower, and that tunnel doesn't de-value a glory. It would be a different story if OP proposed a carpet ride from all banks directly to Menaphos.
---
He's resisting arrest! *bam bam bam*
---
haha I should've asked. Well if you don't intend to go p2p then again do it however you'd like :D . I like to train my CB stats up all together personally.
---
Try to get base 60s and 70s first, as it unlockes better tiers of gear, then keep strength like 8-10 lvls above defense and 5 above attack.
---
My friend turned 1m into 20m in a week flipping.
---
Great for stuff like raids where you also melee and mage
---
And you still haven't had a solid argument
---
If you are very lucky you can get items which are above max rs3 cash, with the highest tier dice. I had no luck on them though ;)
---
Poll it so chickens drop wild boar

Also I'm not sure if this forum is the best for continuosly announcing shows since I don't want people to get annoyed. Feel free to share suggestions of a suiting forum if the shows continue.

Are you asking for bossing content or just regular pvm?

Because people can just easily buy a bulwark, it's not like they're poor or something.

There's a pretty valid reason against that counterargument though

I was shooting the shit with this guy a few weeks ago. He coded the bots himself and has a few different commands he uses. They can all follow him, disperse, etc. The guy has a 40 bot army that follows his every whim.

If they added a dock to construction that would be cool as fuck. Also doesn't compare does it, more hyperbole over a small fishing net.... Reeeeeeee

Runelite has more features, and it‚Äôs completely free (as opposed to OSBuddy which charges money). I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more efficient for your pc and I believe there have been reports of people getting hacked or something? OSBuddy also used to be botting software.

Tell me what part of turning dark essence into runes for 350 hours you consider fun lmao

Runescape‚Äôs most notorious serial killer strikes again. The only thing connecting the victims? Their votes on polls. Will he strike again?
---
These bots are standing there already for literally months. Funny enough Jagex has not doing anything about it.
---
I‚Äôve felt that way a lot. Like seeing people say oh you can make 60m getting 99 fletching..... or I can spend some gp and go boss in all that time saved. Skills are useless really outside of maxing and raids. And it kinda bums me out.

To this day, I still have no fucking idea how to pronounce the name of these monsters.

I have made a follow up post with a new date and time! No worries folks, you will get your show!

Who says we are not all bots programmed to play runescape.
---
The hasta is great for a one handed stab weapon, also pretty decent crush weapon. The fact that it's one handed also means well, shield and or defender so, even more dps than a spear. Also it's used in the creation of the dragon hunter lance.
---
You clearly don't deal with the real world if you think that was a freakout.
---
british game or not.. more americans play it than brits ever did
---
10/10
---
It may that because the items you listed are all anyone really wants.
---
Sadly a lot of high-end items are kinda useless.
---
Obviously mage / range gear is still needed, but people tend to buy max-mele gear before getting ranged and magic sets.
---
Helps to have a decent magic lvl for Zulrah as well, not especially enjoyable with 76 mage ): 
---
Thank you, sir! 
---
He said that he would rape someone in all caps
---
Quests these days don't require you to have random items in away from bank or teleport locations. Even grandmaster quests (like MM2 or DS2) are pretty much straightforward. And I'm not saying it's a bad thing, my point is, you don't need a guide to do them.
---
Yes. If you wear a saradomin piece, a bandos piece, an armadyl piece, and a Zamorak piece you will not draw aggro in the main room of GWD.
---
Should have talked to Oziach
---
Doesn't premier club offer more rs3 points for auras and other shit? Not really worth the extra $/¬£ whatever if you dont play obviously; but pretty sure that was the only reason?
---
Should've used protect from ranged
---
Well for regular PVM and slayer, Blowpipe shreds everything so you can kill practically anything with that.
---
For bossing If you want to get the other requirements for Dragon Slayer 2, then Vorkath is a Range only boss.
---
Otherwise you can range almost any boss as long as you have a friend of two with you to tank. Range is currently the best DPS in the game.
---
Bought one at 3.8m :/
---
good for you boss. I'm just better at reading
---
It could be any number of factors. Merching clans, Drop table updates, amount of active players, a new boss mechanic etc. Hell it could be all of the above. The economy of runescape is one of those most fucky situations I‚Äôve ever came across. Cause and effect is always the answer but the cause is what‚Äôs always unclear.
---
You have a good list, in order of priority I would do
---
1:Easy/med diaries
---
2:Agility/Graceful
---
3:Unlocking fairy rings
---
4:Bgloves/questing
---
5:Slayer training.
---
6:Barrows
---
One thing that I did to help progress my account was going for quest cape, once you finish it, you will have almost all the stats and req's you need for hard diaries and a good med level account. If you need guidance on what quests to do try out the optimal quest guide on the wiki, it gives you the quests in an order that requires the least amount of training to make the most of quest rewards.

Some third age stuff?

Go into twitch and un-link your account (probably still linked from the last free membership giveaway). Then re-link them. Bingo
---
Don't kill shit in the wild that's literally the whole point of the risk. I've never pked a day in my life but I can't stand seeing people cry for getting killed while they were training/clue scrolling in the wild
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of the inferno my friend :) 
---
Lmfao. You‚Äôre hired!
---
Is there any plan to update low level pking? G maul rushing then teleing is at an all-time high and pvp has never been so toxic. Literally 90% of mid level pkers (~level 55-85) have gmaul. You either get 1 ticked before you even see the person, or they spec and then tele as you're potting up. 
---
This the most broken, dumb pvp in a game I've ever witnessed. Even on paper, if you never heard of the game-- Imagine fighting someone 1 on 1 and they use their special attack right off the back that has the ability to instantly kill you. Then they teleport away and recharge their special ability and then come back 10 seconds later to rinse and repeat. You never even have the chance to fight back because your weapon doesn't have the chance to 1-tick KO so you don't bother unless they're at half health which is never the case because they spec then eat to full then tele. Think of any game with PVP and imagine how insanely toxic it would be if people were allowed to use their entire special ability bar and then recharge it to full and be able to use it again 10 seconds later.
---
I‚Äôm rping
---
nah it should give +1 prayer lvl..but invisible
---
Request to make 6 hour log disable your account for 1 hour.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting all of your ranged via slayer. 
---
There‚Äôs a sweet spot where newer O maulers can get away with rune knife into maul whack combos - and now even d knife into maul combos if your strength is really high - this is obviously before ranged takes over your combat level. It‚Äôs a fun combo to play with and your build will only get to do it for a limited time 
---
Cheers. If I build up enough gold I might buy a membership, but for now, just grinding the f2p =)
---
Reminds me of the guy who just felt like crashing me at Nechs in the catacombs. I was bursting for my task and the other room was open, but he decides to chin on the nechs I was trying to burst, even though he could have had his own room.
---
The icing on the cake was him flaming me when I said something, telling me how he‚Äôs ‚Äújust there for the exp bro‚Äù and how I‚Äôm shit at grouping them.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go there‚Äù dude that‚Äôs the thing. Nearly every single clue scroll has a wildy step and there is so much PvM content there you can‚Äôt not go. Not saying you should never be pked while doing that stuff because it is in the Pking area but naked dudes running around and getting killed by spade hunters is the reason why PvMers are so hostile towards pkers and their polls. 
---
Unrelated to the real discussion. ‚ÄúPeople post on here all the time about getting... 3rd age‚Äù - They do post on the Reddit but those items are EXTREMELY rare. And while not very useful compared to other gear there‚Äôs a reason that third age is so expensive - hardly anyone ever gets it. 
---
Tonight at 10 pm central time I‚Äôll finally be getting the five 99‚Äôs I‚Äôve been working on for the last few months: firemaking, fletching, herblore, smithing, and farming. I‚Äôll start in fally square in world 356, get the 99‚Äôs, run and grab the capes (~5 min), followed by a 65.4 mil drop party in the falador party room.

1k dry at Zulrah? That sounds very unlikely considering drops are 1/128
---
Also the guy doing the old record was nowhere close to optimal. He took multiple bathroom breaks.
---
Hey dipshit, maybe I've never played pyramid plunder before and would like a guide. Oh shit man thats actually true never played it. So fuck yourself.
---
I learned about YouTube from the 6/6/6 massacre video. Crazy that was over 12 years ago... 
---
I'm sorry, I was confused. I thought the hasta was the 2-handed weapon and the spear was the 1-handed. So the spear is still the best to use at corp but pretty much nowhere else?
---
The joke lands better like this. "Oh no, some guy on reddits can of tuna is a pker"
---
While that does make sense in theory I think that's ignoring the cost of the scepter vs cost of glory. Glory is a 20k amulet that is useful not only for teleports but for PvM. The next best item is 2.5 mil+. It teleports you to some of the most high traffic areas in the game which include a very close bank teleport. It also works in 30 wildy and is extremely easy to charge and replace. In comparison, the scepter is like 7 mil and only teleports you to 1 location that matters: pyramid plunder. None of the other teleports are relevant and it requires you to play a couple games to recharge it or costs about the cost of a glory to recharge fully. Finally, carpets are available for free after desert hard and it's rare you ever need to teleport to there so the 1 tele a day with hard diary is more than reasonable. 
---
Making this carpet ride makes the scepter lose a lot of its use since it's really either a convenience item for the few-and-far-between clue step or a buy-then-sell after 99 thieving at PP. You could make the argument that there's no reason to make the area so difficult to get to but I feel like that's just an argument for pro-easyscape as convenience of teleports and banking has only gotten easier since "back in the day" and keeping things having an Oldschool feel for as long as they can is important.
---
There are many levels of bossing. You could probably do some of the "beginner" bosses. [Hespori](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hespori), [Bryophyta](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bryophyta), and [Obor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Obor) can be killed by obtaining keys or seeds to get to them and are straight forward fights. [Crazy archaeologist](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crazy_archaeologist) and [Chaos Fanatic](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chaos_Fanatic) are both in the wilderness but are pretty easy bosses with attacks you can dodge to avoid damage.  
---
If you want to mess around with them you can. I'd suggest doing slayer and leveling up to be able to do slayer bosses and "harder" bosses with better stats.
---
The proper 2019 term is essential oils slinger
---
Also the fact that killing elves is a slayer task. Tf is wrong with us?
---
This post is at 666 Karma so you won‚Äôt be getting my upvote, he/she devil.

Depends on how you play. The quality of PVM is at an all-time high. PVP is at an all-time low.

Looks a whole lot like whining to me. I mean, I've never posted on Reddit after getting killed in the wild because I literally don't care, but that's just me.

What's the point to anything in life then? What's the point to learning to dance if you could lose your feet? What's the point to learning piano if you could lose your fingers? What's the point in learning to program if in 10 years, AI will likely be able to program itself?

I am a believer polls should only exist for substantial changes such as new quests, skills, areas, and BIS weapons. A lot of the updates towards old content are pretty minor and harmless, and I think could be done at Jagex‚Äôs digression.

Good stuff.

I get so much joy out of talking shit while pking. I'm trash, so I never pk P2p and even when I pk F2p I die 6 times as much as I get kills. But nothing is more satisfying than killing someone in Runescape, forcing them to be sent back to Lumbridge while you pillage their loot. Calling someone a fag/retard is what makes the kill really worth it tho
---
Bro... you‚Äôve just opened the pathway to so much content. The snaring part was genius. Cheers.
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit about bots, they do not impact me at all 
---
Good post, good goals, and looking for peak efficiency isn't what the game is always about so good on you for doing what you want.
---
Look to expanding your playground and options, and goals, so looking at Regicide, Monkey Madness 2, Dragon Slayer 2, Diary goals, maybe a 99, etc are what you should look to.  Unlocking Zulrah, Demonic Gorillas, Vorkath, and some Diary QoL will be a great way to expand your account's options.  70 Agility will get you access to Zilyana's chambers too if you wish to duo/trio with friends or clan mates, but the other GWD rooms will be available to you without issue.
---
Slowly progress your Slayer too so you can try out those Slayer bosses, and start trying to hack at Raids like the Chambers of Xeric.  Theatre of Blood should come much later.

Michaels 1st is the guys main. Idk which alt account he did the fletching on though lol. He‚Äôs a cool dude

Yeah the comparison was steep, but I think it holds true.
---
Truthfully, anybody who can spend 7m on the convenience of a sceptre for it's teleport isn't going to sell it, and start running to shantay pass, and take 2 carpet rides to get there instead.
---
k?
---
Which one?
---
it probably depends on what youre killing.  low defence, msb probably better.  high defence, rcb probably better. Also depends if youre cannoning or not. Blowpipe probably bettr than both in all scenarios.
---
I blackjacked 66-74 yesterday, I'd recommend it over Ardy Knights. Once you get 65 thieving you can do menaphite thugs, which gets around 180-200k exp/hr. It requires some more focus but is way faster and you can still watch netflix while doing it.

I've heard mercury is good for your health, support!

7000 hours for his maxed uim
---
Glad I‚Äôll actually be able to make this one!
---
Yeah im a bit of clue scroll fan, on my way to finishing medium clues which is nice just need 9 more items that i feel like are never going to come. 
---
That would be an average of 6.92 gp/exp. sounds a bit low if we‚Äôre talking about rune and dragon darts.
---
Really? because i have offers for a bunch of demon hunter crossbows on rs3 for 100gp ea and everytime i log in, which is like once a year, i have at least a few bought. possibly buying after each time i check?
---
You are missing skill.

Hahaha brah #dude #weed #chillzone #runepipe

Get a scythe and go ToB what you doing fool

Me neither man, I just say cat-uh-bul-pon

That bolts are stackable and therefore you have unlimited afk exp. It wouldn't pass a vote

I‚Äôm not sure his numbers are correct.

Ah man. 4am UK time, I‚Äôll be getting up for work an hour after that.

I‚Äôll have to miss it, congrats on the multiple 99s. I‚Äôm still working towards my first
---
Hey,I thought of this independently. I haven‚Äôt seen this meme otherwise I would have just said damn and scrapped the idea. It‚Äôs not impossible or extremely unlikely for 2 people to come up with the same idea independently.
---
Was this recent? Spotted the same guy about a week ago and a bunch of people reported him
---
Good luck, fucking incredibly frustrating grind. Albeit pretty short, but you can get some shitty teammates. 
---
World 306 iirc 
---
So the wind starts blowing right so I steer left. The arrow goes towards the middle for a second then goes hard right. Since I can't steer anymore to the left what am I supposed to do?
---
um if everyone wanted those items, their price would rise I think xD
---
They did that? Isn't it like, most of tumblr?
---
Let's just make every teleport free while we're at it... not saying that it's a big deal that it devalues scepter it's just that there's a reason that there's a free option that takes longer and an expensive option that is instant. Having an option that takes just as much time as the original method is pointless as well, is 1 click extra too much for you? Why even add it then?
---
It gets the toxins out of your account!
---
This is something Andrew gower could have added to the game so why not
---
I‚Äôll be there! But quick question, is doing d‚Äôhide bodies all the way to 99 crafting a good way or do you recommend something else? Asking cuz I‚Äôm going for it as my first 99.
---
wow this is epic
---
Omg I‚Äôm Hitler. Lmao 
---
"AsukayenOSRS" is a good place if you enjoy Slayer/PvM/CoX

Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home?

Just finished Zulrah on my ironman at 233kc. Too bad Zulrah is the best boss to be dry on.
---
Wtf kinda acoustic aids is this.
---
Please use a grownup sentance to describe your feelings and thoughts. 
---
&gt; Truthfully, anybody who can spend 7m on the convenience of a sceptre for it's teleport isn't going to sell it, and start running to shantay pass, and take 2 carpet rides to get there instead.
---
Yes, players with more gp should be able to do things faster than players without. What's the issue here then with the current system? The way it is now makes perfect sense. 
---
Deadass nigga this is the most genius thing i ever heard b. Some einstein level shit my nigga
---
Forgot the words RS3 Bad and swampletics over their heads. 
---
You could also just 3/4 item it.
---
Come on man at least try harder. How much could one 20min video a week get in the way of your responsibilities? 
---
this is why i vote no on pk polls
---
Vorkath isnt range only with dragon hunter lance now.
---
And the crowd goes wild!
---
The same autistic aids ss this communities logic.  I figured I needed to appeal to my general audience

Yeah that will never happen lol

Work on your slayer
---
As warding is the crafting of magic gear I guess the same holds true there

not to mention black chins is 1m+/h or 2m/h at 99 using tick manipulation

you and i both know that red cape swampletics left morytania to have a chat with king roald.

Acoustic AIDS=sentences so shit that they give you AIDS when they vibrate your eardrums
---
Slower youre going the easier it is to change directions IIRC. When I did it i do remember it being a little awkward handling but I still finished it first try. Just make sure youre adjusting speed correctly when trying to turn. I think you can keep it on half speed and it will be a little easier. I dont know if the clicks are just delayed or something but you have to spam click it sometimes to make it turn. 
---
I'm going to bet though that youre probably just going to fast when trying to turn. So try slowing down then correcting your direction. 
---
Also either use the guide on osrs.wiki or look up slayermusiq on YouTube he has pretty good guides. Theres a female youtuber that has guides on osrs idk if she still does them or not but i used hers for older quests like regicide and it was really helpful. She explains everything very well and actually talks about the lore of whats going on too. Can't remember her name though. She was also extremely easy to understand and very well spoken. Slayermusiq is a little hard for me to understand sometimes tbh, its not a knack at him because he is well spoken and English clearly isnt his first language. Personally i just have a harder time depending on the accent, i find that more of my focus is tuned to making sure i follow what theyre saying vs what im actually doing. 
---
awesome, thanks for this. I believe I needed to unlock Fairy Rings for Ardougne cloak, yes very useful!
---
For Slayer training vs Barrows, what's your though on what level to get Slayer up to? I see them both as "money-making" tasks, is there a preference for leveling slayer first? Thx!
---
I seriously hate this community. Bunch of jerk offs that celebrate wasting your time money and potential. Shame on all of you
---
Thanks man! If you‚Äôve got money to blow, d hides is the fastest. Otherwise blowing glass or doing battlestaffs will be a little slower but will save you a good chunk of cash. 
---
No worries man, good luck to you! Lemme know when you do, would love to come celebrate 
---
Low effort trolling
---
When a white person tries fitting in with his good friends 
---
Fuck yes
---
best post on this sub
---
Also 17m rs3 is like 170k in osrs lol maybe less.
---
I transferred 200m and got like 23m lmao
---
you could have gone on the wiki lmfao
---
And yet there‚Äôs still can 100+s out here with combat bracelet 
---
That was pretty wicked. 
---
Sniped AF
---
I got hard diaries done exclusively for that fucking window shortcut. It would be nice to get something more given that 
---
west provinces gave me elite void+ crystal Hally+ red chin spot;
---
 Varrok gave mining boost + battlestaffes;
---
ardy gave me a good cape+ teleport,+ thieving boost+ yanille tp;
---
 lumby gave me run energy back+ teleport+ tears boost;
---
 falador gave me mole locator + prayer back+ crafting bank,;
---
karamja gave me one of the best teles in game + gem mine;
---
Kandarin gave me 10% more bolt procs+ best agility training till high level + herb patch boost;
---
Fremmy gave me 2 new spells, both awesome, + shortcut to herb patch+ noted bars;
---
Mory is arguably the best with awesome money maker in barrows, unlimited teles to burg de rott, bonecrusher and Slayer boost on tower;
---
Wildy have me better key rates, a super important shortcut to do lava dragons and ancient obelisk TPs;
---
What did the desert hard gave me? A fucking window requiring 70 agility that saves about 5 seconds 
---
all capes best i take it back
---
Then killing that one guy that has cash stack on him for some reason. It's not griefing it's part of it.
---
now this is the attitude of a winner
---
There's no way, that is an everest sizes goal.
---
If he gets it I'll alch my full rune.
---
I mean i remember not very long ago when bandos tassets were around 24-25m, BCP was 12m, literally half the price it was now, Armadyl was around 36m for full set. Shits crazy expensive compared to what it was a year ago. I paid 24m for my tassys. 
---
Yeah wouldnt make sense not to have it that way tbh.
---
Jesus fucking Christ I love this subreddit so much
---
In the interim, as I'm hitting these PvE / quest checkpoints. Do you have any advice on skills to play with and make decent gp/h? Or should I just rely on nests/herb runs for now until I need more money later?
---
and potential left click, yes
---
Shit man. I seen your post a few days ago but didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre a level 3 skillet. Sick account! Will definitely be there.
---
I pulled 7 from a garg task! 950k from the task itself and 1.6m from the chests. 
---
Luck. I‚Äôve only gotten 3 total in like 25 tasks lol 
---
Keep doing Farm runs and Birdhouses until you have the cash to start flipping. After that the boys the limit and if you want cash you go to the GE, and all other money makers become obsolete. Plus unless you have 10+ hours a day there is no Max efficency you can actually achieve.
---
The Sceptre is most used for efficient pyramid plunder, not teleporting to Sophanem. The people going there with carpets will still have to ride to Pollnivneach and then to Sophanem. This saves like 3 seconds and is a nice QOL suggestion and you're shooting it down because of "devalues muh sceptre"
---
&gt;Let's just make every teleport free while we're at it
---
That's not what's being suggested here. Stop exaggerating
---
Considering the upcoming warding skill I‚Äôd say ur right 
---
Thanks for the love! Hope you win some good stuff 
---
Which is literally what I always do, unless it's an elite or master clue. Otherwise the only thing that can attack you in wildy on a clue is the zamorak wizard. Just protect magic and kick him and you're good.
---
Fatality
---
there's still no reason to melee it if you're using ruby bolts
---
Hold my beer
---
&gt; they know what's good for it way better than any of us do
---
I really have to disagree, since I've started playing, I've seen tons of really questionable content like Birdhouses, Konar Drops, Revenants, Wildy Bosses, and Vorkath, and these were just the ones that were overwhelmingly negatively received, so not including controversial updates like Zeah RC, Withdraw X, and Spellbook Filters and also not including updates that failed the polls either like Vampyrium Vambraces, Mort Myre Fungi in NMZ, and Wines to Wines of Zamorak Spell.
---
This would have been really funny if the prayer was a gun
---
Fremenik hats are better too
---
Ok just a quick question, I have 84 range and 65 mage. Would you recommend barrows for money over zulrah since I don't have 75+ mage? Also is barrows the best combat activity to make money with my stats? 
---
Naw ive seen people here commenting that their doing fine melee only, im not arguing with you...
---
It looks like a shitty tie
---
I suppose he probably withdrew his whole stack and was tabbing to his house throughout the clue for quick teleports, and simply forgot to bank them once he encountered a wilderness step.  
---
Explorers ring 4.
---
It reminds me of the Avatar intro lol
---
Honestly I think it will just keep going down till it's like 200k. Bad call to make it such a high drop rate. 
---
I'm actually curious as to what is his hidden method. I couldn't think of anything in particular in morytania to get hunter xp.
---
I still ndont understand why ppl vote no on it.. you would still get the warning when youre bout to enter the wilderness. It would also look better not to have some extra crack on the ground near the wildy.
---
Presumably more as he can only get a rune hatchet?
---
support!
---
Roundabouts when will the poll be open? I only have like 3 more hours of membership.
---
/r/how?
---
Looks like lightshot
---
there is no option to run as admin this... all other exe files have it as option.. why or how am I supposed to do that?
---
Basically he just staked like crazy until he made it.
---
Also he‚Äôs a really good dh pker and would quickly rack up 100s of mils in dh sets and other loot to stake again whenever he got cleaned. 
---
Torvestas bangs lol
---
I can never unsee this now
---
We like Swampletics more than we like you, cya. 
---
Great video lol! Most of the pkers at altar are as bad as there. And bulwark is just so damn good. Didn't die once when i did 77-90 prayer.
---
KBD, Mole, GWD, slayer, raids 1 (kind of?), Wilderness Bosses, Skotizo, Corporeal Beast, nothing else is really coming to mind but you'd have a fair amount available to you.
---
Never seen that name on this sub before....... 
---
That's a lie lol. Most of the time it's someone with half an inventory of d bones and no cash. Not sure why anyone would bring cash to begin with.
---
why not at this point
---
Well monkey madness 2 requires you to have 69 slayer, plus that is when the skill really starts making good money. I would only go off to do barrows if you're in need of cash to either train a skill or need some gear to complete harder quests, barrows is decent money but later on you'll unlock better things like demonic gorillas/vorkath/zulrah/raids/GWD. Don't forget to grab a black mask and imbue it for the slayer grind!
---
Need to do the grind myself won't be on till late tonight/the morning UK time
---
E
---
It already cures poison in a similar fashion.
---
Wow dude what a hot take. I've got another hot take for you, osrs is better than rs3. 
---
Did you get the rune arrows?
---
Thanks man! See you there!
---
I tried playing vanilla without the animation smoothing and my eyes almost exploded.
---
I'm hooked on Runelite for sure. The XP trackers make the grind so much more fun being able to see XP rates and stuff.
---
vote yes
---
He‚Äôs this pretty neat osrs tuber you should heck him out brar :)
---
What items? 
---
That's what he gets for listening to such gay music
---
Robots... And a new, clean, fuel source.
---
Oof no
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If youre not poisoned it doesnt do anything. And some people never get poisoned if they wear serp or just drink venom before. For these people that feature is useless. I dont see why it wouldnt work for food.
---
Is this legal ? I mean come on Wrath stone (wrath altar) with Wrath essence (wrath runes ) 
---
Realise that not everyone has max gear or mory hard. If someone is asking how to upkeep a blow pipe they probably aren't in a position to do it efficiently. 
---
Which would explain the enraged fight going on in the clip...
---
Wait..what..you can use your spec now by clicking the orb on minimap? Or rather WILL be able to once they add it. But the fuck?? While I agree it will be handy, does this not just make the game more ez-scape? More so thinking about for prayer switches/bossing and pking. Same with your hp icon idea..idk I don't really understand i guess why such a thing would be added. I feel like it just makes things easier. And I argued before that a lot of what people consider "skill" with clicking smaller icons i consider to be just muscle memory and not actually a tactical skill, i feel this may be going overboard. 
---
Im not really sure though if this actually helps pkers out. Due to switches in your inventory its probably still faster and more viable to just use the actual spec bar/click on food in inventory rather than the icons. For pvm though I could see it being more useful with pray switching and etc.
---
Regardless of that though i see a flaw. What if youre carrying karambwans and manta rays both? Or any 2 diff types of food, or even 3 or more for that matter. Which food would it eat for you? Would it work on brews too? Also what if you misclicked prayer and ended up eating instead. I feel like clicking your hp icon should just activate the rapid heal prayer or something like that. It seems like it would be difficult to code to make it eat food, because of the reasons i just stated. 
---
Also maybe this is just a big whoosh for me lol. I didn't know the spec thing was being added..maybe I missed the poll? Is that a serious thing? If this is just a troll then I sure look dumb. 
---
ThEy VoTe No OuT oF sPiTe To ThE pVp CoMmUnItY
---
It makes no sense to leave it up to the players when half of them are the ones abusing the weapon/poh in the first place
---
I relate heavily with socially anxious Ardougne guard #5
---
You would go out of your way, to ruin someones account, who may be trying to complete a challenge (such as 100% hcim) and has to do wilderness challenges...
---
That's your prerogative, but man, that speaks about your character...
---
People say the regular client is trash but whenever they try to add runelite features to regular client everyone votes no, makes sense.
---
I think when I did hops with ultracompost, I did 4 patches and would get a minimum of 80 hops if none of them died. Sometimes saw over 100 
---
Or how about I can kill whoever I want in a PVP zone of a video game. Idiot.
---
i dont think they have many if any similarities at all so its perfectly legal
---
Holy shit
---
It is funny you soft- skinned piece of pussy shit. 
---
Glad to be here
---
It is the best value...lol. You do understand that Premier Club offers A LOT more stuff than just membership? Why would they give you all that and then make it cheaper? That doesn‚Äôt even make sense. However, I am pretty sure most, if not all the benefits are for RS3 players. If you are strictly an OSRS player it‚Äôs probably not worth it. 
---
This is also a promotion...they aren‚Äôt supposed to last. In previous years, they got rid of all the Premier Club options completely by February. 
---
Did you just gild your own post and comment?
---
A blue cape

You watched video ? Huh I guess I'm reaching then.

Nvm, I'm dumb

Just a reminder that last dp announced here was impossible to get a single item because of the massive amount of people
---
Dude im playing osrs too! We should group it uuup
---
Head=serp helm. Legs=bandos tassets. Chest=bandos chest. Boots=primordial boots. Gloves=ferocious gloves.

This is perfect and gives me a lot to work on, thx for your help :) 
---
Definitely not looking forward to agility, but I sure do need Graceful
---
Get higher melee stats too, your stats look like leeching bandos from 90+ combat stats
---
While I strongly disagree with your stance on this, I understand the point you are trying to make - and I do think it is an interesting topic to break down the reasons why the two scenarios you propose (wildy risk vs money doubling scam risk) are different. 
---
I think a large part of the reasoning comes down to the understanding of risk involved, the overall purpose of each, and actions that can be taken to avoid/reduce risk. 
---
**UNDERSTANDING OF RISK:**
---
Risk isn't inherently bad. Many games would be nothing without some element of risk. It has to do with the risk being understood.
---
* When someone goes to wildy, they are (or should be, the game makes it very clear) aware that they are taking a risk in that they could lose their items. They are making an active decision to enter a territory that was created with the intention of posing a risk for players.
---
* Many (most?) who participate in money doubling scams are being tricked and taken advantage of. The overwhelming majority of the time, those who participate are being lied to by other players in the game (often bots, which is another part of the issue) and are unaware of the the extent of risk involved.
---
* Sure, you can argue that it's "their own fault" for being tricked by a scammer which, to a degree, comes down to a matter of opinion. A lot of my reasoning for why this isn't a reasonable stance is related to other points I'll bring up. 
---
**OVERALL PURPOSE(S):**
---
Let's break down what purpose each example serves. 
---
MONEY DOUBLING (Scammer perspective)
---
* Low/0 effort money making (often botted)
---
* Tricking others (excitement)
---
MONEY DOUBLING (Scammed perspective)
---
* Low/0 effort money making
---
* Feeling lucky or like they will receive a gift (excitement)
---
WILDERNESS
---
* Wilderness exclusive non-PVP content (clue scrolls, green dragons, lava dragons, bossing, quests, wildy slayer, revs, etc.) - many different purposes: money making, skilling, character progression, etc.
---
* PKing - Multiple purposes: the activity itself, money making, character progression (improving with combat mechanics, combat xp)
---
**AVOIDING/REDUCING RISK:** 
---
MONEY DOUBLING
---
* Be 'smart enough' to not fall for scams
---
* Only attempt to double small amounts (Can be successful sometimes because scammer is hoping to get you to keep raising until they scam you for a much higher amount - STILL NOT RECOMMENDED)
---
* Avoid wilderness 
---
* Utilize in game tool to objectively assess your risk value
---
* Only bring items you require and are willing to lose
---
* Be skilled at PKing to avoid death
---
* Bring items to help to avoid death in wildy (teles in some cases, lots of food)
---
* Immediately log out when you see another player in wildy
---
* Protect item (Note: beware smite)
---
I understand the point you are making by trying to conflate the two scenarios, but when it comes down to it they are very different. If you remove one the game is virtually unchanged. If you remove the other, there would me a massive portion of the player base that would be outraged or even quit entirely. Just because both scenarios include elements of risk doesn't mean they are the same. 
---
I agree, this community can be so shitty when it isn't saying what I think.
---
I have urgent need to go watch settled's Morytania only uim... how??
---
Can I safespot Skeletal Wyverns, taking no damage from their Ranged and Magic attacks, while using the Dragon Hunter Crossbow (without using the Longrange attack style)? The wiki seems to suggest that their Magic attack has a distance of 8 squares, their Ranged attack has a distance of 7 squares, and the DHC has a distance of 7 squares - meaning that I would still get attacked by their Ranged attack. However, I swear I've seen players safespot them with the DHC with the Rapid attack style taking no damage.
---
lmao . baited.
---
Yea prolly 5k
---
Could be someone's ahrim idk have you tried turning off and on?
---
I hadn't noticed the first until it was too late since it wasn't highlighted  in RuneLite. After I spotted the second I made sure to highlight it and then a third showed up. :'( Could have been a pet if I wasn't a cannoning kid and actually did skills.

Can someone explain exactly why people are voting no? It even says on the poll that there would be a barrier that would require confirmation to prevent you from walking in regardless?

what's that?

iOS only?

Herb runs are solid income for any account until you hit base 85-90s really.  Even then herb runs through Ranarr/Snapdragons with most of the patches in the game can be great bounce back income or supplementary if you choose to use less in a rotation and be selective (instant teleport patches/patches with better herb yield boosts).
---
The way I would make an account is one that slowly and surely works towards the Quest Point Cape, which is definitely a good achievement and basically opens most of the game to you.  The progress you make doing the Quest Point Cape lends to finishing diaries, while keeping your account relatively flexible and will add to moneymaking in the long run.  The earliest consistent moneymaking options you can do is Barrows or wearing full Range/Mage Void with a Blowpipe and Trident and going straight to Zulrah to learn how to kill her but you must get 75 Range and 75 Mage.  It's definitely possible to do Zulrah with a Rune Crossbow, Dhides, an Iban's Staff and Full Mystics, but you will have a hard time maintaining a good profit.  Safe options in hoping for Barrows gear from the Brothers is a better option though with Morytania Hard Diary (without it, the profit is heavily weighted to the Barrows gear drops).  If you can manage to get to Demonic Gorillas, that is an amazing place that can actually help you get better at bossing in general without the pressure of an annoying and/or costly death like Zulrah/Vorkath.
---
Focus on leveling combat through Slayer with a Black Mask that should be imbued eventually.  Avoid the pitfall of buying a Slayer Helm earlier when you can be skipping/extending/blocking tasks as you near the 70 Slayer range.  Imbuing the Black Mask through Nightmare Zone is a big must and it will help train your stats in the process.
---
Really? Wow... I'm 123 cbt and am just finding this out now!!! I feel stupid now
---
3 bcp you're fucking cheating
---
I love that shit. I was like 5 black chins away from leveling up when a dude came and ice barraged me. I was like "hold up, I'm gonna level up real quick before I let you kill me"
---
I must have struck a sore spot or something, because he got really fucking pissed, going off about how I didn't need to "let" him kill me, because I was a "shitty noob" and he was going to destroy me before I could get my level. 
---
I ate through all of his attacks, leveled up, released all ~300 black chins, took off my armor and turned off my prayer, and then said "Ok, you've got my permission now". I swear to god he stopped attacking so that he could flame me for a solid 30 seconds more before finally killing me
---
I actually just got thru on my 10 try or so the wind direction didn't change at all so I didn't need to do a thing
---
Sick skills bro. Might not be able to make it but congratulations nonetheless!

People read "Remove wilderness ditch" panic, have vietnam flashbacks, vote no.

Meet Swampletics

is that a real snake?

And if you don't have a weapon with a Spec, the Spec Orb won't do anything. Some players never equip a weapon with a Spec either...

So I was under the impression that this kind of mouse key set up was bannable? If they're not, then I could do something very similar to clean an entire inventory of herbs quickly? I would love to show that.

Anyone have info about this?

Well I'm not getting a torso then haha, Torags it is!

I'm an iron that has been doing bandos recently, the only way I have found to not get crashed is to stick to 2k worlds. Most of the people on those worlds are ironmen and then rest are really chill and won't crash.

It gets to me when people post things on Reddit when they have no clue wtf they are talking about

So your answer is pretty different than the other guys. What‚Äôs the consensus here?
---
No..summoning will never come to OSRS unless the community wants it hard..

I use msb i for most my slayer tasks that I cannon, dps is still very high and mith darts have shit accuracy

Not yet. I'll try to do it this weekend.
---
Yeah I was excited because I thought they would be color coded based on their difficulty. Then I had to downgrade to a medium contract because fuck planting magic trees only to find they're all purple.

jamflex bad
---
I tried looking at all various areas in Morytania through the wiki, even looking at the construction skill to see if it awards hunter XP for mounting stuff. I honestly cannot find anything that rewards even 1 hunter xp without the skill needing to be lv30. All I see is the additional hunting spot added near Slepe. So I'm genuinely curious as to what his plan is outside of Genie Lamps and Exam Books. 
---
fox only
---
Just buy it again lol.
---
Ow. My eyes.
---
Yah, I can't defend reordering. I mean there is some balance for how things could overlap making it is easier to combo, but third-party clients already allow and in PvP so that one felt weird. If I had to guess, it is failing partly in a form of protest against clients who already offer it.
---
Swampletics GOOD!
---
No i like this because it reminds me im a hcim btw
---
Bulwark is nothing like Divine and it will never be useful for multi hard bosses, which might come in the future with other powerful items.. 
---
sounds like engine work to me
---
No worries!
---
Agree, it ruins my immersion. Hard to play the game if I keep getting distracted by an aligned ironman helmet.
---
Just need enough lamps!
---
No need to do barrows, unless you want some fun with 400k profit/hr, if you just focus in slayer you do the same with gargs while afking.
---
My using?
---
Why cause it‚Äôs still at 69 percent yes? It was never passing as far as I know. I edited this pic if you couldn‚Äôt figure it out. Clearly the bar representation for yes and no doesn‚Äôt match the 80 percent yes
---
Ehh stop your bitching that's some free construction xp right there. 
---
I can get on in a few hours. We can discuss there
---
Who needs drugs when u can have karambwanji
---
Your first 99 is not trimmed. You need a second 99 to trim it.
---
Yeah if you wanna piss off pkers vote yes to divine shield! 
---
It's a mirror
---
Splitbark is pretty dope.
---
Hey guys it‚Äôs 2019/15/2, let‚Äôs just agree to disagree...

Are you cube Erik, cube rik, or cub Erik?

no we need more hentai on this sub actually

Hello /u/25xx,
---
Mod Bananahead here - I've just reviewed everything for you.
---
Straight up - a mistake was made on our end resulting in the Inferno Cape being removed from your account.
---
I've sorted everything now for you, and your account now has an extra day of membership to help make up for the time you couldn't play.
---
Bananahead
---
Yea my image was edited. This was never passing and never will pass
---
I wish Tumblr didn't have to become prudes...getting really annoying seeing this weeb shit on reddit
---
I will trim it for you for 5M. 
---
Because they have the same stats, for literally everything but Corp, hasta is better.
---
Should have used Retribution
---
Once I get a second 99 will it automatically become trimmed? 
---
It says it turns to dust on the wiki when it degrades. So not repairable 
---
Awesome I‚Äôll look you guys up
---
I love when people post here and try to separate themselves from the autism like they're not actually users here
---
Great thank you!
---
Oh yeah I misread your post there. Yeah not sure about those other ones, but yeah I just noticed d claws down to 66m from 90.
---
The fuck.....
---
Yeah!
---
I was dumb and got slayer helm early, didn't have points for block list and had to spend a lot of points skipping blue dragons lol. 
---
Slayer helm is really only useful at specters, banshees, dust devils, and nechs.
---
It‚Äôs slow progress but he has other things to do..
---
Im aware that youre sarcastic however korasi is not as op as all people make it seem. The problem was of how easy it was to get it.
---
alch
---
You‚Äôre exactly right. That‚Äôs why every poll that makes the game easier (more xp, better drops, etc) always get passed because people vote selfishly and not for the betterment of the game 
---
Ok.
---
Okay cool what‚Äôs your name? I can add you when I‚Äôm home in an hour :)
---
Thanks for confirming you're 14.
---
Isn't this a Minecraft meme? Or did it start before that
---
Make sure you‚Äôre last hitting the cyclops and have finished monkey madness 2
---
I‚Äôd do some wildy slayer for money, using melee on higher level tasks and range on lower level, while working towards doing barrows, but I‚Äôd get a little more prayer first. I‚Äôve been in the ‚Äúmid level‚Äù for a few weeks and i had been hearing about barrows forever as a good mid level moneymaker and no one mentions how oppressive the prayer drain is. I have a lower defense level though so using better armor might negate that. I‚Äôve had some fantastic luck at barrows (and in general with my account). 
---
Too bad Ice Poseidon wasn't there to keep him out of the cage
---
Ring of stone 
---
A bit lame...
---
I suppose it comes down to opinion. I suppose as /u/Reed_pel said the helm is not as useful so long as you have a black mask you'll just be missing out on a few tasks. Prioritize the blocks you "need" such as blue dragons and metalic dragon.
---
Tfw they are the only items i receive from medium clues. 
---
Runescape already gives out chat bans. Jagex is not the government btw.
---
Most people don't enjoy his grade a raking and fruit picking content
---
Bring some alchs peasant. 
---
It‚Äôs a shame. Especially when you look like that
---
Yes, however, many people like to keep like their first untrimmed so I believe if you drop it before getting the second 99 then tele grab it, it will remain untrimmed. I believe you can still buy a trimmed one but I would need someone to confirm that because I am unsure.
---
Livid Farm watering can new meta?
---
looks like I will be staying up all night haha. It's going to be 6 am over here.
---
Correct. Sometimes I'm okay with it. I voted no to withdraw 1/5/10/x/all for banks, but I'm not mad that it passed. It's not needed but all in all it did not make a game breaking difference, however 10 non big things end up becoming big.
---
He can pay you in potatoes. 
---
Maybe divine just makes some part of the game too easy so people don't want it in the game... but nah they would make way too much sense
---
voting yes because i want 2010scape
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But he probably used AHK, which is now banned, and doing that with mousekeys is less plausible.
---
Well I don't know the actual values of such a change or how it would need to be balanced, I was just spitballing some ideas to potentially make the heads do something other than simply giving prayer XP. I can take a few dragon bones to my house and gain just as much XP in a few seconds than I can gain the same XP from using a Vorkath head on the Dark Altar. Anyway, I sort of revised my idea and tried to distill it down into something a bit more cohesive, being an item placed in your inventory rather than gear you wear. It did get some early upvotes but most people still downvoted it. I guess I can't have the winning idea all the time and that's okay. Let me know what you think.

---
Thank you for your response. I am indeed expressing disapproval of this subreddit's status, but I don't really agree with you when you imply that Settled is wasting his time.  
---
I like Settled and I watch Swampletics, and I also like that he is getting recognition (because, hey - if you are having fun while doing something that you and other people enjoy, you are definitely not wasting time).  
---
On the other hand, it does make me dissatisfied when I browse /r/2007scape and all I see is more or less the same thing: "Swampletics", "RC Bad", "PKer 0 IQ".   
---
This post was intended as a wake-up call for all the circlejerking going on in hopes that more diverse good content makes it to the Hot page.

Can we also add a leaderboard option in the chat along the lines of ‚ÄúMy biggest customers are Zezima, GodAsh, and AVA-TAR. They‚Äôve spent 2.5b gp, 2.4bn and 2.2bn on my one-of-a-kind snake oil!‚Äù
---
Bots are good if they do tasks no one wants to do allowing more real people to enjoy the game at lower prices. Such as filling water vials, crafting runes or making unfinished potions.
---
nice arm blade
---
Mostly the first 2, not the third so much I think.

This leads to confusion, when you write the wrong word. It's all good, mate.

MSB I is 100% better than plain mith darts alone lol. Those guys are morons.

It‚Äôs not what the original game had it‚Äôs a pointless barrier

Just get a room already

These guys are in the same formation and doing the same things for over a month.

If you type any emote name they'll do it (or used to).
---
I‚Äôm guessing you do farming contracts with herb runs? If not they are easy passive money.
---
why are you doing the 1:0 elder maul method in the first place? its legit dogshit. like, max gear+ mith scim is comparable.
---
if you really insist? place vials in both safespots, if you pick up the vial you are clicking too late. otherwise, too early.
---
An addiction to dopamine is apparently the only reason anyone does anything. Sad way to look at life.

Well, at the time i was getting 99 fletch, selling yew bows and buying supplies was fast with zybez.

I'll b there or try to be

Practice by just running back and forth inbetween, if you can do that then its just you being late after hitting the hand with the maul.

So do we need to buy 14 herb boxes a day? Or am I just catching up for how long I‚Äôve played the game?

Also add a chiropractor at the duel arena/clan wars that does absolutely nothing
---
Kinda cool to see that specific number as your gained number of scales thus far. Definitely a good sign. üòÉ
---
unless you REALLY want to trim it, do what super\_smurfin said, 99 farming is a pretty rare cape to have untrimmed. untrimmed farming cape is much more impressive than a trimmed one imo
---
Because i stand in the Edgeville bank in PVP. Stand one square east of a player, click trade on them. And my account is fucking launched out into the PvP world i'm instantly snared and tbed then killed.

Why make it easier to scam?

I think it should function as it explained BUT like Kebabs have a super low chance of actually doing something (placebo).
---
How does this work? You type jokes in in-game chat? 
---
haha, really really really confused on this. I really hope it gets looked into asap
---
The hunting spot only has swamp lizzies (and swamp bubbles but I don't think you can interact with them). Maybe its some kind of a mechanic to spawn random events more often?

---
Great question
---
A lot of people don't seem to realize that the issue isn't people PKing in dedicated PVP areas, it's the fact that a lot of them are complete douchebags while doing so.
---
It's just a strange idea that fucks over anyone who PvPs part time. Muscle memory is a powerful thing and having to either constantly re-adapt, or forego a decent advantage that non-pvpers can have, are two bad choices.
---
I'm also just unsure who this clause is for, as I'd imagine there are anti-change purists in each pvx camp. 
---
Scams. I make sure to make it as hard as humanly possible for scammers to function.
---
Even if that requires a ditch.
---
It will be more annoying for rune crafting to have a dialouge every single time. So you will have an option that says "Do not show again"
---
Now that player can be scammed. 
---
Isn't for me.

I learned this last week on my hcim when I was rocking a wizard hat for the Wanted! quest and it gives you random items as a clue of where to search and I got a gnome hat given to me and saw it was better than my wizard hat. I was surprised and told my friends but they didn't care. 
---
I've voted no each time because making spells easier to click lowers the skill ceiling for no reason at all. Get good. 
---
301, they're there a lot
---
That's how I do it!
---
why is reddit so anti PK lol
---
Right on man, have fun! 
---
Wat
---
Already voted yes
---
Some Japanese kid will probably beat me to it.
---
I think the hats from Canifis as well... So basically if you want a starter wizard hat, make sure it's not named "wizard hat".
---
Will do. Magic is a tedious one. 
---
Woosh
---
I've had 7 from 2 tasks, lately getting 1-2. 3 is still good though. Sure the drop rate is 1/60 so not bad at all buddy. Good luck with the chest :) 
---

Lmao no one would pay 10k for that! It‚Äôd be better to pay like 5m and let f2p have teleblock if they unlock it.

I remember they had to change the alch animation because it could cause seizures or something lol

You're good fam, I can't imagine anyone holding legitimate grudges over shitposting on this sub lol, it's all in good fun.
---
That seems like a girly gift but the person receiving it is a girl. Lesbians or fake? Hmmm.
---
Maybe we shouldn't spite vote, especially on a piece of content like this. 
---
Let‚Äôs take it one step further. 
---
Clicking on food is hard too so we should be able to choose a value that the game will automatically eat for u.
---
Also, all slayer monsters should be aggressive and not lose aggression. 
---
Let‚Äôs have it so you enter the dungeon and it walks to the correct slayer monster for you.
---
Let‚Äôs actually make it so all you have to do is be logged in and the account will play itself.
---
In reality, if you think this stuff is so tedious I would say play another game for a while until you are getting dopamine again.  
---
Your math is very off
---
well it's not impossible because the items went to people, they don't just disappear lmao 
---
I love how easily the community comes up with somewhat reasonable explanation for this shit. Good job bois!

I finally died. Got killed by a team of 7.

VOTE NO
---
LMAOOO
---
Actually me 
---
I mean, I'm 95 slayer and have well over 5k points. I could skip my tasks if I wanted to, and I do skip wyrms but even wyrms will net you 500k or more a task. Especially now that konar drop tables are a thing. Let's be real, we are talking about making money, not efficiently. I literally just did a black demon task and picked up only keys, rune items, and rannars and made 700k.
---
That made me laugh ty üëåüòÇ
---
Exactly!
---
How are we supposed to live with ourselves now that we know people lie on the internet

Imo finding things out for urself by playing the game is a lot more fun than just looking it up! And those skills u gained during aren‚Äôt wasted :)

Verf is more about the content than the person itself, he is pretty awkward and his accent doesn‚Äôt  help, making him sound like he isnt having fun, Caveman was pretty awkward too, but in few episodes, he got more confident, unlike verf. Still watching verf karamja tho.
---
Settled is always motivated and happy.

Also a miniquest where you can join as a salesperson in their MLM.

With wiki you have to read, then do, with audio, you listen and do at the same time..

 Just checked the polls, voted yes but there is no way it‚Äôs passing lol
---
Best $/h w/fishing? Sharks or karambwan? Or is it like those weird lava eels from the elite tzhaar area?
---
Yes, I realize fishing isn't the best $/h.
---
show pic of the ban

This is actually a great way to die repeatedly to teams that camp altar. 
---
Check out broad bolts and broad arrows, they‚Äôre cheap and equivalent to adamant, you need 55 slayer tho to use
---
Unfortunately had to leave some loot behind and was at the mercy of 6 hour log. Could of gone for even more if there was time.
---
Ps: Add a deposit box outside plz.

Awesome. Guess I‚Äôll put some dollars away every check and invest in one

Worst feeling is when it‚Äôs all set up and you forgot your tinderbox or it‚Äôs out.

Do you mind me asking, what is an overlay? 
---
he tried, 07 reddit instant deletes the post on images on your accounts bans
---
Posted below in a comment by me
---
Go ahead and attack anybody you see in the wildy, that's why it's there. Just don't be surprised when people start vetoing PKing updates after you camp their corpse so they can't pick their clue scroll back up.
---
So you genuinely have fun and not see RCing fkr 350 hours as a waste of time and you have fun at all time doing it?
---
Lmao the autism is strong with this one 
---
I can't imagine this passing. As soon as most PvMers read 'remove the ditch' they will assume it will make PKing/luring easier and vote no without reading it all.
---
In reality, the people this benefits the most are probably people doing Abyss RCing
---
You're kinda pandering here. Someone being a dick doesn't make them wrong, and an Msb (i) with rune arrows is rarely okay to train with. Naked mith darts have very close dps and cost a fraction, while a Blowpipe costs only a bit more to use while dealing half again the dps. 
---
32 you can do ranarr runs they are fairly profitable if you do it correctly
---
Well I hope you get some good stuff to make it worth it :) seeya there!
---
Few things are legitimate cringe. This is one of them.
---
this is what happens when you have bad staff team xd
---
He's trying to protect himself from a mike tyson punch. Duh.

I don't like it. This sets the stage for all orbs to have multiple uses/functions. Then combat is just clicking your 4 orbs on the minimap. I don't like it.
---

---
&gt;What are you stats?
---
Max combat.
---
&gt;Are you using arclight?
---
Yup
---
&gt;my kills are pretty quick.
---
The kills themselves don't seem to be particularly slow, especially when I smack a few 50+ in a row. But for some reason, i'm 'only' getting 12-15 kills/hour and i've heard of people getting over 30, so i'm not sure if that's normal or some kind of alt method or?
---
&gt;are you running away from Sire after being teleported
---
Yeah
---
&gt;are you just dying from the minions
---
Yeah, pretty much. As I mentioned, this doesn't happen all the time, but i'll just be chilling on 50-60 hp and then just die. No poison hitsplats, protecting range. I'm not sure if that's just being incredibly unlucky or if that's normal once in a while or what.
---
Apart from that, i'm finding it's pretty easy, but i'm just not sure if what i'm experiencing is normal or not.
---
Lmfaoo
---
Apologies if you already know, but you can simply join a Wintertodt world and join the minigame. You don't need to find the team on your own.
---
Alternatively you can solo it on a non Wintertodt world which is better for rewards but worse in terms of xp.

There is nothing special... his hunter level is only 4 right now

What‚Äôs learning without either dying or fleeing

It's decent xp until you get to higher levels than it starts feeling slow. If you throw in a cheap allotment with your ranaar runs, it's really decent xp.  Yeah it's not trees but saying it's pretty much no xp is pretty much not correct

---
I understand that this TL;DR is confusing to the general audience. That is because it is directed to those who already know what they are doing and want to do it more efficiently.  
---
If you want to learn with a video, that's great. It is also extremely positive that you are a person that is open to new information and encourages others to be as well. I am open as well. However, I didn't seem to find new information here.

---
I mean just going off personal experience; there's always a team or two hopping around up there and for me getting piled by 3+ dudes for my 500k loot is just about the least amount of fun I could ever have in the wild. Maybe you've had a different experience tho.
---
Its like that for 75% of it tho.
---
Hahaha
---
Its not officially called spring break, but its the only vacation that's between January-May here, apart from one day vacations during easter etc. so I like to call it spring break. There's going to be snow around till early June anyways so I dont even know when the actual spring starts.
---
There would be toggleable warning for entering the wilderness.. You wouldnt be able to enter if you have the warning on.

Many people vote no because they don't want to have separate interface settings in different parts of the game, kinda making pvp even more detached from the rest of the game. 
---
This has very little to with pvpers voting no out of spite. This mentality is also very childish and just hurts everyone in the long run.
---
Thank you for contacting Jagex support. You will need 300 more upvotes for us to care about your issue.
---
Didn't some dude get 200m agility with tickets in 1 sitting? That's gotta be the record
---
If Jagex wants us to use the vanilla client, they should make it less awful. Seriously, it's just painful to use. Hire the runelite guy and have him work on the vanilla client

Sort of looks like he has his hand on his crotch lol

You got too good, they're worried you're going to do them for other people now so you have a ban on sight warrant /s

Not even talking about Reddit alone, everywhere I go people are talking about this as if Jesus is going to descend from heaven in the next episode and give everyone Twisted Bows. I don't understand.

Yeah if you start doing aranaar run as soon as you get the level, the xp is good

I hate hate hate that I can literally walk up to the edge of the map; Rather it one shot killed me with a "desert heat surge" or something before letting me see the edge of the map like that

Because of so many updates to range and mage in the level range, obby maulers are pretty underpowered. 
---
They‚Äôre also much easier to make now due to fossil training slayer instead of cannoning. 
---
Beyond what‚Äôs already been said, not only are your stats low, but your gear is also a large hindrance here. Your kills/hr must be abysmal in that setup

All you do is smoke weed and play this you prolly work at dollar tree huh, and you a trash pker lol

You guys joke but a poll to remove the green pixel on the construction skill icon failed.

3. You were in the army. Say no more, this explains everything. 
---
What does that have to do with what I just said. You don't even use a blowpipe at barrows except on Ahrim possibly, but you're fine using an RCB on him. 
---
As someone whose done 500 barrows chests and used methods from the bis which you seem to hate so much to slayer darts, I can tell you regardless if you do slayer darts at 70 or so magic you are making more than 600k+ an hour. I specifically said 1.2m/he WITH DIARY, but did you ignore the rest? I literally said 1m/hr without. Yes 1m/hr without a diary would be assuming one of the better methods, at least Ibans. However even if you use fucking slayer darts you're not making 600k and hour. For fucks sake you could use a black salamander and do more dps than slayer dart and the only req is 70 att, ranged, and magic. Is that too elitist for you? Christ man stop making an enemy out of everyone you think is some 1% player. 
---
Lol, I haven't seen a pker while doing clue scrolls in at least a half year

It's not anywhere on this thread that we can see
---
It won‚Äôt let me post the link but I‚Äôll try again
---
Doesn't matter, even with the lowest possible req methods like a black salamdner with all 70 combat you are gonna be making more than 600k/hr. You can't possibly tell me it's too big an assumption that someone is 70 all combat skills when barrows equipment itself literally is T70
---
Good luck hope you get a response!

Why even have different protection prayers just make 1 that blocks 100% of all damage?
---
How is this supposed to account for a single monster using multiple attack types, or pkers switching attacks? If you're geared to defend melee and it switches from protect-mage to protect-melee but not back in time will you get bombed by their magic attack when you already geared up and planned for both? If you're being attacked by two with two different styles what does it do? Spaz out?

Copy or type the text why do you need to post a link. They told you why you were banned and it's a big deal, spend 10 seconds typing the base reason provided if it's this important to you.

Going for max/comp cape in 07 so far like 12 99's down and working on fishing, going to need around 300m for everything. so anything will help :D

It's not earning it in one day. It took months and months and months to get the tickets for 200m agility xp. It took the other guy 24 hours to earn 100m fletching xp

Too much info was in the post, not necessarily the screen shot. I'm sure with a little digging you might be able to get his email/password (i wouldn't know how), and from there it's just a successful recovery attempt away.
---
You seem to be confused.
---
Every player has an inventory that's capable of holding 28 items that cannot be seen by looking at someone's player model. Some people take their gear off after they're done bossing to look like they have 0 risk. Some people bring way more than they should into the wildy.
---
Attacking naked people isn't ragging or anywhere close to it.
---
A ragger is someone who risks next to nothing. They attack people with actual risk in order to interrupt their fights and deplete their supplies. That's literally the opposite of the above situation. 
---
Yeah darts are really nice on mobile/tablet.
---
BioMasterZap has replied with a well written comment that answers these and reflects my opinion.

Then it's your problem if you're not willing to do the methods to make money lol. Vorkath is easier imo once you get past the first 15 kills or so, you just have to pay enough attention to dodge fireballs.
---
Honestly Runecrafting isn‚Äôt bad either. If I got 5 minutes I can do a few lava runs:)
---
Thank you for your comment; it reminded me to show this to OP /u/ice_trollseidon:  
---
[Herb profit calculator](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs)  
---
The way you can make money via Farming is with herb runs, OP. With that tool, you can see which herbs are the most profitable at any given time. If you don't care about EXP, then yes - Ranarr is quite more profitable. Remember that higher Farming levels increase your herb/seed ratio, though.
---
A verrrry simple way to do it would be use the diagonal tiles on the corner of him, hit him on one side then when he faces you run to the other tile and then when he faces you again run back and attack again 
---
yeah he did say he uses them for a small time farming operation lol. nothing compared to the big botter sites
---
F2P is meant to be limited and if you're getting bored and wanting to experience more content that you get rewards out of, that's the entire purpose of membership. You talk about more goals, but completing all of the quests as a new/casual player takes a bit of time, and if someone is still wanting more content to do after that, then membership is there for them.
---
No you're thinking of the essential oils salesman out by Vork
---
This is amazing
---
 Way to completely over exaggerate my point. 
---
Things are becoming too "stronge" and it's putting too much emphasis on one part of the game whilst neglecting the others. 
---
i think it be a good think to add ! the amount of players ive seen (that aint bots) that just don't have a clue how to play the game! i know it would be difficult to add to the but i really think it would help a lot of people to understand game a bit better! Don't think the requirements have to be that hard! smithing something rune is a bit over the top imo! i would prefer a achievement diary then quests! 
---
Why are you bringing more than 4 items????
---
&gt; That doesn't change the fact that some PKers are just shitty people.
---
You can say that about any group of people in the game. Why single out pkers? Honestly, in my experience, pkers have been the least toxic people that I've interacted with in the game. I know that sounds meme-y, but it's totally true. I haven't seen a 'sit kid' in the wildy in years.
---
Nobody has been hacked from osbuddy. It's just that runelite offers the same/more features and is free, while osbuddy costs like $5 a month I think. There are uses for it however, I know myself and several other people (that I can immediately think of) who use it for raids scouting/alting because the information is more readable at a glance.

---
didn't someone post this a long ass time ago but with a different title?
---
i think that's the weirdest thing about it though. The alt gets banned for cape buying even though he's played his main at the same time as it, however they can't think he was selling as if they did the main would have been permed.

I voted yes sir. Doing my part.

Wow! Congratulations on the pet. I'm still over 18M EXP dry of Groot :'(

Good luck for raids - imagine if you'd gotten this lucky with TBow RNG

While this idea is awesome, just imagine how crazy it'd be if they implemented MLM pricing on sale of these potions.
---
You buy it for 25,000.
---
You sell it to another noob for 30,000. Profit: 5k
---
They sell it to another noob for 35,000. They profit 2.5k, and the other 2.5k goes back to you because they're now a member of your downline.
---
That next noob sells it for 40,000. They profit 1k, and you and the previous noob each get 2k of the profits.

You've now made 9.5k profit off your initial sale, all from working from the comfort of your ~~living room~~ mom's basement!

So the rumours do have a basis from what I understand, back when the creator of osbuddy was still making botting scripts/clients he jimmied gp from peoples accounts. However since becoming 'legit' everything has been above the board.

My brother has been hacked twice in a month while using osbuddy though, and hasn't been hacked ever since switching to runelite though.

Ya I mean they have the executive power to just remove polling and add MTX and EOC whenever they want. The idea is it's a sort of agreement. When they made RS3 and it failed while private OSRS servers took off, they got the community to come back to their official OSRS using the condition of polls. If you take the polls away, we repeat the history of RS3 with the community leaving and ending up on private servers again. So no matter what Jagex loses by betraying the players, as evidenced by the past. So while they have the executive power to follow whatever agenda they want whenever they want, the polling system is as you said a security. It's a check on that power that discourages that sort of development. 
---
Temp
---
The majority of players probably just don't understand the controversy he causes. 
---
They don't know why they should like or dislike him. They might not even know what the NPC is. 
---
If players don't understand why people want him removed, they aren't likely to vote for it. 
---
Just look at the skips on the question. There is currently 2-4 times more skips on that question compared to the others on the same poll. 
---
i get that its suppose to be limited! I've still got loads to do on my account im not getting bored! im just thinking of ideas! ive had accounts with memberships in the past but the game has too many updates that i can't keep up! not saying that's bad thing! Thats why i like f2p because its more slow pase!

Literally 99 everything.  You will run into 50 maxed pures and die in seconds to Addy arrows.
---
They have hovered between 14.5-16m for a pretty long time, i don‚Äôt see them going much outside that range. I think you‚Äôre better off holding on to it... if you sell now you take a loss of 200k. If it drops to 15m you‚Äôre looking at a loss of 1m but it‚Äôs a BIS item that you should be holding onto regardless of where the price goes. Personally I don‚Äôt really pay much attention to price fluctuations of my BIS gear that I don‚Äôt plan on selling unless a new item is scheduled to be released that would replace a current item I have.
---
You're crazy if you think the amount of strength it would bring into the game is so much that it doesn't make it worth fighting for the chance to smite.
---
What exactly does this prove?
---
This is why we can't have nice things.

Oh since you do it, everyone does. Gotcha. Lol. It's like probably 80% that dont bring notes bones and 20% do.

I mean i've seen people pk everywhere in deep wildy. I was thinking of doing it at chaos altar

how about this when we get turmoil and summoning ill vote for divine XD.

So because it drains prayer you think this shield is useless... **l o l**
---
500k oh my god its literally nothing
---
are you using it? then don't fucking sell it for CHEAPER than you bought it idiot, selling it at a loss is exactly how you lose your money

its real value is its worth to you and how you use it, if you are not using it then yeah it's a waste

Nobody seriously wants to ban puff, that was just something that was mentioned along side the wobbling-ban discussion. Once the wobbling ban actually started to gain traction, the puff ban was dragged along by reddit and fans who don‚Äôt follow the scene closely. Not one top player I‚Äôve seen has said they want puff banned, most have said banning puff is stupid, actually. Plup is the only one that came remotely close, and his decision was he would take a break from melee because of hbox (and puff, by extension) as he said it was not fun to play against and very stressful. 
---
Hbox is a very good player, his play style however is easier to execute, harder to mess up and boring to watch compared to other top players. That is why melee fans and players dislike hbox. Players also have shared experiences that show hbox isn‚Äôt the same person off camera as he is on camera. Also people ‚Äúonly complain when you start winning‚Äù about everyone. Everyone loved Ken, then when he was clearly #1 people began to cheer against him and wanted him to lose, that eventually lead to him quitting comp melee. It‚Äôs not hbox, that‚Äôs just how the melee scene goes, and most comp scenes tbh. Nobody wants to see the same guy win every tourney, unless that guy is extremely likeable and fun to watch (mang0, armada etc), also melee fans tend to cheer for the underdog and hbox is the exact opposite of an underdog.

There was a statement made by a jmod a year or two ago but I'm on mobile and it's not the best for searching.

When I get home I will continue to search for a more in-depth post on account sharing from a jmod.
---
My opinion may not be the popular one... But not for a long time.  
---
All low-mid level "bossing" (Barrows, mole, wildy bosses, etc.) are mostly a waste of time. The amount per hour you can make (even with maxed stats) is abysmal compared to end-game money making (CoX + ToB), and you really don't need much at all to get through to the end game. Sure, you're not going to be level 80 decked out in BiS... But in the time it would take you to get BiS at that level you could have maxed your combat and got BiS through raids with time to spare.
---
If efficiency is your prime concern... Just make your money via birdhouse/kingdom/herb runs + slayer, they'll give you more than enough to afford all your basics (Fury, whip, guthans, blowpipe, etc.) then worry about making money when you can at the very least do Zulrah and/or Vorkath. Even those I wouldn't recommend grinding for long (Well, maybe Vorkath... With a dhcb you can get 60-90k range xp/h while making a good amount of profit, so there's an argument to be made for camping Vorkath for 99 range), just enough to get yourself a starter set of CoX/ToB gear then learning those. It's not necessarily the most exciting way to do things, but it'll save you a load of time in the long run.

Basically when the resize poll came through for the spellbook the first time last year it failed by a small margin, and everyone blamed the pvpers because of pk streamers that said it would (reduce the skill cap and devalue their talent) and reddit REEEEing followed. Now since then any pvp polls have been getting demolished by the pvm community out of spite, so of course the tables are going to flip on this one. This is why I say it's time for them to remove polls, they've divided the community and not in a productive way.
---
You shouldn't really get smited in singles unless you deserve to lose them.
---
Is alternative medicine illegal?
---
That's the way it's always been though. The counter play is to call your opponent a safer and hope they let their health go low so you'll stop being mean to them.
---
They ban people if u have someone else do inferno for you
---
That's funny i actually started my account as a 1def pure too. If you ever need money barrows is doable with 1def just btw. It trains magic at the same time too. Just some tips from another pure. You might have already known you can do it though. 
---
People sell inferno runs, I would consider that RWT personally, you're selling an achievement/item for real-world currency.
---
Yeah! Duck those people that have Worlds Greatest Dad on em too! There's only one greatest dad and it's not you buckwheat!
---
Ofcourse he'll get help.  He has Reddit backing him.
---
Its a temp ban. No one cares. Play your main and get back on your alt in 2 weeks. 
---
Yes? Bring 2 extra restores into wildy and be a tanking god. Divines were awful pre-eoc. So awful people would feel comfortable with divine - arcane switches.

Yea, I remember that poll. I think that's why they edited this time to only include non-PvP areas. Although it's still failing.

Using runelite's plugin, I just searched bookcases until I found anything. Then, I was able to see the overlay for transportation incantation when I ran around searching for it since they all appeared.

I saw those a couple of weeks ago, except they were in a square. Some dude owned them and said he was at work and unable to debug 'em.
---
Is it updated though is the question.
---
Yeah that's genuinely the path I usually take :) especially since I saved up for it and was my first big BiS upgrade. I'll keep an eye on it and see if it dips every day. Trying to play with it right now I feel like would just burn me in the end probably.

I was looking at the charts too and saw the charts so that's fine with me. I think panic selling usually turns out worse in most cases. I wasn't sure though if they had dropped a hint on stream or something about a nerf, which in that case I probably would end up selling
---
So 45% damage reduction for a 3-4 max hit loss seems acceptable to you?
---
That's just swampy sweat.
---
1/400 From pickpocketing master farmers or a common drop from Ancient Zygomites
---
Can also kill troll, ogres and moss giants as its a uncommon drop
---
I think I found the thread I was mentioning before

---
Haha yeah! Want to make sure everyone gets at least a little something. 
---
**OOF**
---
yes, IIRC he actually posted some update logs
---
&lt;3 to bad I'm only level 3 
---
same thing for pvp content, this is why we can't have nice things.. don't be a hypocrite.
---
I mean that's average chest value excluding special drops. Considering special drops are 1/17 you get one every two hours. Since most of them are worth a couple 100k at least you're missing a big chunk of change there. 
---
This guy did the math on it and provides good info https://youtu.be/F2-OETh2WYI

Sweet thank you!
---
The Eyes of Glouphrie and somewhat MM2. Brimstall even states gnomes could be very powerful if not for their distrust of magic. 
---
&lt;3 I'll take a look!
---
please note that increased ammount of pitchforks and torches may be necessary to awaken the support team from their yearly winter hibernation
---
thank you for your patience
---
14 day ban for selling an account. Seems reasonable to me. Don't buy or sell any more accounts with or without an inferno cape and you won't get banned again. It's not hard to understand. The evidence against you is incontrovertible so you might as well stop trying to lie to this entire community about your innocence.
---
From what I'm seeing, it seems like people are only seeing removing the ditch and are disregarding the fact that the warning will still appear unless toggled off.
---
Hey, farming guy here, i wont ever be able to beat 3hr 9min so might as wel give up
---
Hilarious

I‚Äôve never tried barrows as a 1 def but since you said you‚Äôve done it I might as well try üòè

Looks like you're a winner.
---
Well I'm pretty sure the anti-cheat team deals with RWT too.
---
But regardless, I have friends who have been RWTing since damn near the start of OSRS (stakers) and in easily hundreds of transactions, not a single has ever been banned. So I personally wouldn't describe them as competent.
---
Exactly this. This is literally the only reason it's separate. 
---
And even now, people vote against it.
---
This community sometimes, man. Jagex just can't win.
---
brainlets who think clicking a small icon is skill
---

---
!remindme 10 hours 
---
Small being the keyword, right? Surely it won't be that impactful. 
---
Same name as OP. Clearly is admitting to RWT inferno runs and cape/pet
---
as someone that spite votes pvp content i voted no because having content change between locates is retarded
---
lol, bro. i doubt you made him feel bad at all. he was probably laughing at you
---
Smegma lolololol
---
Thnx Ali-A for letting me steal your intro this time. Don't worry about the free advertisement, but if you wanna, sure, give me your money.
---
Thnx for the support &lt;3 appreciate every feedback aswell!
---
Nice.
---
Sparc Mac does get hate for this. Lots of hate. 
---
It's not as if it's going to be dirt cheap, it makes it far easier to be smited as well.  Seems well worth fighting to me.
---
I mean, its optional for a lot of this stuff. I'm ok with more options. Seems like lots of people just want to bitch because it's not how they play the game.
---
500k drop isnt a big deal matey, you need your zenytes.
---
I'm not being a hypocrite. I skipped most of the PvP polls since I don't PvP at all, so I didn't feel comfortable voting one way or another on them. This whole "PvPers against PvMers" mentality is just insanely counterproductive to the game as a whole.
---
You are autistic
---
Somebody posted a private message of him selling accounts. He clearly deserves the ban lul
---
Kinda makes sense tbh, generic name wouldn‚Äôt make me think it‚Äôs very good. Like if there were some gloves named ‚Äòwarrior gloves‚Äô
---
Very original idea to make the cocktails into a real thing, love the lil' cat
---
Well you are not the one moving its like getting moved without consent (or kinda eith consent ironmen are deviants)
---
Personally I just like the wilderness ditch it's nostalgic and i feel like the change in xp/hr would be miniscule but I understand it could probably be annoying to some 
---
I can see that ur not very bright :(
---
Is it 100% okay to use clients approved by jagex such as Runelite and OSBuddy. 
---
Yep, you got it.
---
Because they are autistic. I said it for them. A comeback can happen if we push 
---
Yes please, would love to do zmi again instead of souls/bloods.
---
There's no reason to vote against one getting content the other doesn't get. They are completely different styles and areas of gameplay. They will always be different.
---
Gratz, bought my first one just 2 Days ago
---
It's not iconic at all. Are you autistic 
---
All they need to do is create an event that is about Swampletics. The event could be: gather a bunch of supplies to build a statue; and then build a statue of Swampletics. It could go into the center of Varrock instead of the fountain. And you can have the option to worship the statue. I think that would be good
---
Should warn you though since you're probably a pure and you've been keeping your prayer low, the only reason 1def doesn't matter is cause you can pray all of them. If you've got low prayer you'll make a bit less cause of prayer pots.
---
You still get to make money while training magic tho so it pays off. Glad I could help üòè
---
Lol shows how much youve been paying attention. 25x is a RWTer, im sorry you cant accept that.
---
Jagex banned me for doing 23 Wintertodt's. 
---
/h
---
This is my favorite post! To the top!
---
Keep it and make more money, torture is best in slot and you'll always need it in the future. Prices fluctuate all the time and you shouldn't worry about it.
---
if there is new content which favors it, then yeah. If there's no reason for the BP to randomly become used more then no.
---
Well aren't you just the cunt-bucket of the day? Calling someone an idiot because I'm asking if there was a REASON for the price drop. I.e; they dropped a message on twitter or stream (that I do not follow closely) about a nerf? Kinda like what I said in the post? 
---
It was a question about why it's dropping in price. I said I didn't know if I should sell or not because I don't know if they mentioned a nerf or what the case was. 
---
So run along to the next thread dickhead and take your elitist bullshit there. You answered nothing here and contributed nothing to the thread so why bother posting? So you can feel good about calling someone an idiot for no reason? 
---
A player who cares about integrity? and on reddit? Rare sight these days. 
---
Probably fake and gay lol
---
jagex should ban OP's main but also ban this guy for snitching
---
is the dagger or the bludgeon better for strength training?
---
And we pay for that gahahahaahaha
---
this doesnt make sense or follow logic
---
It's currently a 32.5% reduction and doesn't seem to be a problem. This opens the door to more of a variaty of content.
---
Sounds like you either don't have the GPU plugin turned on or your integrated GPU is trying to do the work. If you have a dedicated graphics card make sure it is selected to run runelite, not the iGPU.

Here's the original, from 4 years ago.

this is big, love the idea
---
What BIS are you referring to?
---
I mean.. he did do it for other people. Hence the account selling for $750 part.
---
i got a cape on my alt first try and it hasn't been banned
---
you've been a naughty boi

Pickle chin bitch
---
Oh fuck, deserves its own post
---
What's the dfruit pie mean?
---
For that large of an xp jump, raise the mining and RC levels required to 75+.
---
Or just don't sell your accounts. That's the easy way to not get RWT banned.
---
This is amazing lol
---
Stake it or no balls
---
Didn't believe OPs bullshit for a second, not at all surprising to see the proof in the comments just like every other time someone is "unfairly banned" here
---
It would make sense to have this NPC at MLM too.
---
Can I say the B word now?
---
FFS
---
Colossal if true
---
Ah yes didn‚Äôt even think about superiors. I will do that. Thanks for the heads up!
---
!RemindMe 12 hours
---
There always appears from my perspective to push a PVM update almost every quarter which includes bis gear... lets not have a divine update let‚Äôs have something else. 
---
Huh, not trying to start anything but for me it‚Äôs more nostalgic when the Ditch isn‚Äôt there and it‚Äôs just an open field. 
---
Remind!
---
Nice red cape idiot, blue looks better
---
Id vote Yes for this. We already have a bustling player scammer community at every GE. Let's get some npcs to scam as well.
---
"lmao nice max cape, how's mom's basement?"
---
... I save a lot on rent, okay
---
It fucks over non-pvpers in the wild too, since they'll get used to their custom placement and have everything moved around when they need to use protection spells while getting attacked.
---
No it isn't. That's average chest value INCLUDING barrows pieces. 
---
Diary + Items = 97k. 
---
No Diary + items = 80k.

The tops are gnome fashion *styled* human clothes while the hat is just a normal gnome hat. It's the size that makes it magical.

It is.

I got a second slayer helm that I colored red to use with my red godhide range gear. Fast forward two months later and I realize that I forgot to imbue it.....
---
I'm not sure about how effective ultracompost is at protecting trees, but I'm pretty sure trees have a 1/8 death rate if you supercompost them - so I believe the rule of thumb is that if the payment required to protect the tree costs more than 1/8th the cost of the sapling itself, it's not worth it to protect it unless you want to maximize experience gain by guaranteeing that every tree survives.
---
one of my favo quotes of Code Geass :-)

Very easy to fake that kind of pic though.

My pitchforks are ready though!!

Granted I voted yes, but this is pretty fucked. He has the ability to almost corner the market. Guy is loaded. 
---
&gt;low and behold
---
Not really since blowpipe helps so much on it.
---
No. It's stupid easy to fake that kind of picture. Not legitimate proof.
---
It's not the pking, it's the people who pk other who obviously have nothing on them but a spade

Reposting for visibility 
---
That's the beauty of runescape!
---
I played when Runescape was 2d and you had to sleep and stuff. I was like 8 and my brother was really pushing for me to play.
---
Then Rs2 came out and they reset my stats, so I quit, but my brother literally would make me play, he would take away Jak and Daxter, the only gMe I liked. That account got way better then my old account, but someone scammed my dumbass 12 year old self and I lost my account. 
---
So I made a NEW account, and that account got way better than I had ever been and I got really onto questing and got my first 70 stat. But then I got greedy and I bought gold and got banned.
---
So then freshman year of high school I made a new account! And that account was beast, but then EOC happened and the game was *literally unplayable*
---
So here I am in Osrs, with 81 slayer, a firecape and a 99 str cape feeling like an absolute beast.
---
Tl;dr this game gets better every single time 
---
I try to be sympathetic since I was falsely banned once and it was quashed after I whined on reddit, but these guys always let me know.  
---
Also, on discord you can change your name to match anyone.  With a few minutes of work, I could make it seem like Mod Ash was on Discord and was trying to sell me Zezima's account information for a recovery attempt.
---
Exactly. It makes no sense that PvPers vote no to things that make PvP better, then complain that there's no PvP updates.
---
Yup, and I'll make another if they do, and another and another after that. I only say that because believe it or not a lot of people talk to my bot and I read every single thing, most of them are "yup, I know" but some of them are people genuinely grateful that it stopped them having their acc stolen. Some are just hilarious though [https://i.imgur.com/FtgncnE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FtgncnE.jpg)
---
Well it was a repoll poll so that's why the divine was polled, to see if players opinions have changed.
---
I also wonder what you classify as BIS because if the divine was in the game you would not really see it used anywhere besides pking.
---
Are you the guy that went the first in the account to go PK with the low-level Inferno cape? If so I could see how they got pissy about that but they really need to calm down
---
bawww my 500k!!! thats like 2 zulrah kills or vorkath or whatever lol there is no need to panic over that jesus christ
---
If you watch /u/Michael_RS's video on his Youtube channel, he said numerous times that in theory his record could be shattered down to 3 hours.  EVscape was the first to actually seize the invitation.
---
Sure, but there is no tag# in this image.

The boobs look off as well.

Did you use a reference to draw this or did you just wing it?

Oh man, I just shot Marvin in the face.

It's why I don't use the method. I'm terrible at it. I'll take the exp hit. 
---
something to note is, you may want to bring prayer potions at 43 prayer. It drains pretty quickly, an alternative is look up "Prayer flicking" and its a neat little tech that can increase how long you have prayer.

Here's the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ar09dy/alt_account_gone_for_doing_23rd_inferno/
---
I'm really confused why this didn't pass. It seems like a solid QOL update all around.
---
But now he cant sell his alt cause its banned
---
Nice 
---
Yeah the majority find the ditch nostalgic despite the fact it wasn't there. Same thing is happening with Hatius, talked with a guy in game that's voting no to removing that abomination because of nostalgia.
---
You would rather a crappy mini game over a new bis item? Can‚Äôt think of the last time I played a mini game and when I did it was mind numbingly boring for several HOURS to grind for fighter torso and void gear
---
So OP's screenshot also prove nothing. 
---
Only if it counts as role play
---
So hard to fake a picture xd
---
Windows Mousekeys were used here to click (5), move the cursor up (2), and move it down (8).  This is entirely allowed.  EVscape just used AHK to remap the 2, 5, 8 keys to a letter on his keyboard.  Which is perfectly fine.  Jagex has continually said 1:1 keybing remaps are entirely allowed.  What isn't allowed is multiple actions per click, such as the commonly used **right click -&gt; move down [x] pixels -&gt; left click**. 
---
You're right ahrims staff is prob better, couldn't remember how much it costed. It's pretty cheap I assume though?
---
As for the 5m part, earlier you were proposing 6.6 minute chests, not 5m. 9 chests an hour is 6.6 minute chests (well discounting probably 2.25 minutes of your entire hour that is spent running at clan wars assuming 15s per run after each chest). 5m chests is 12 chests an hour which is more reasonable and would be more than 600k/hr
---
Is this r/beetlejuicing material? Can never tell the right way to use that sub. 
---
That's still 4 hours wasted since you should be doing this type of bolt fletching while doing agility or slayer.  The downtime between actions in other skills makes fletching technically a 0-hours-to-max skill.

What phone? I never have an issue using other apps with osrs running in the background unless my battery is below 15% and background data is shut off. 
---
Alright buddy, let's calm down now
---
Sheesh, I'll be glad if I get 1.5m to finish this bond grind! lol
---
People don't seem to mind click intensity, but what really sucks is attention/aim/timing.  People hate 3tick methods not because of the number of clicks per second (which is *way* less than bolt fletching) but because messing it up means failing the method.

I'd wear it on my main when bridding, tanking teams for a full tb is already easy enough with spec mechanics, why make it easier. 
---
Even worth bringing extra restores for, a brew is 64 hitpoints, a super restore is 124 prayer points, or 248 damage soaked. 
---
He didn't ask for you rsn retard. I pmd him and gave him what he asked for. What I enjoy doing in RS and why I want the money. My Reddit username doesn't even match my rsn, it isn't even close. Not to mention my security questions have never been answered anywhere on any of my social media.

Stop going full autism anytime something sounds too good to be true. Maybe the guy is seriously just giving away the gold. Based on the post literally above me he seems to have a lot of gold anyways. He's probably just rich.

You might want to try a different game. One that doesn't literally have the words "Old School" in the title, perhaps?

Yup that is why every game turns to shit usually cater to the plebs that are terrible and can‚Äôt learn how to put in effort to play the game correctly.

Could I add you in game incase I have anymore questions?
---
I'm a level 126 skillet.
---
No one is crying or panicking you bloody moron. The term "panic sell" is just a fucking phrase..
---
My question was whether or not it was crashing due to an imcoming nerf or change. And while 500k may not be a lot it's also 500k in one fucking day..and if it drops 500k a day for a week then 3.5m is still a bit of money to me. Ive only played for a couple months. So please keep sounding more and more like an elitist douchebag. Once again, since you're incapable of reading and you lack any sort of fucking intelligence that even a 3 year old has I'll say it one more time: the worry was not 500k. The worry was if i missed an announcement or post about an upcoming nerf or change meaning its going to drop way more than 500k. You stupid, bread of an IQ fucking twat baby-dick shitface asshole prick cunt. Get that through your head. 
---
Phew. Now that all of that's out the way feel free to carry on your douchery to another post. 
---
You can change it
---
Depends on how streamlined it is. They could bot/afk the account in NMZ, transfer gear over, do the cape, boom a few hours of work for $750.
