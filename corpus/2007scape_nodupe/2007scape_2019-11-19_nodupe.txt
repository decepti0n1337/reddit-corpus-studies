&gt;changed it significantly

&gt;  
---
&gt;I love it

---
Yeah the only other area locked league that makes sense would be mortaniya, no where else has the content to last for 2 months.
---
---
---
Yeah, probably
---
Would be fine if it was useful outside of the teleport, but as is it's kinda useless
---
That was MoparScape's null
---
Well here's why by their own words paraphrased: their goal was to make emblems zero sum. t1 = 75k t2 = 150k. Your opponent has t1 and you have t1, their emblem destroys when you kill them and you get a t2, so no money was created. It does make sense, because they also said their goal was to move the profits from the emblems over to points. But.. then they go full Jagex. They created hotspots and completely threw that design goal out of the window. Which is how we got the boosters creating tons of gp on top of getting tons of points (which create more gp). I honestly felt like the update was going pretty smoothly up until that point. Were lucky you do need to match emblems or else people would be boosting their t4s to t5s by killing their alt with a t1. A generation of 525k raw gp without any hot spots, kill streaks, or points added.
---
Lol this doesn‚Äôt make the game any easier, it‚Äôs merely a Quality of Life suggestion..
---
[I did exactly that](https://i.imgur.com/BTbRs5U.jpg) but for some reason the Varrock diary page doesn't list that as a perk. It's listed on the skill sceptre page, but not on the Varrock elite page.
---
I went 5k dry on kraken, and then got it within another 100kills. Every other pet is under drop rate, along with a 16kc Bloodhound. I feel reallll dirty about it lol
---
i wondered why he was being so nice üò≠
---
And yet I've got lurers on my friends list who are still actively luring people after months.
---
Are you guys ever going to acknowledge the problem with how pets are obtained? Some people will nearly reach Max cape and not ever get a single skilling pet. Meanwhile you've got people running all over the map that have insanely low XP or insane RNG pets. How much work does someone have to put in just to get one pet? It's extremely discouraging sometimes to feel like maybe you just don't deserve to have one.
---
Yes that one!
---
Gekoloniseerd!!
---
One pixel less and that would have been gf account
---
Compete for what? #1? You already can't compete unless you have minimum 12 hours a day to play for the next 2 months. "Compete" to earn the rewards and earn a decent rank (dragon or rune)? You can probably do that without altscaping. You're probably overestimating the amount of people who altscape.
---
I use it on my iron for clue scrolls, but yes I agree that the f2p limit is very restrictive. At the very least you can use single sceptre pieces to recharge it now, which goes a long way towards making it usable. 
---
I camped flesh crawlers in f2p for a few days when I wasn't ready to start playing full time and banked over 100 sceptre pieces, giving me 300+ teleports. Alternatively, camping Minotaurs for beginner clues will also give you near endless teleports.
---
Huh, weird. 
---
You get a pass this time lol
---
It would also be nice to allow the staff to be upgradable to make it a viable magic weapon.
---
Luring should be allowed.
---
Assuming the drop rates are unchanged from the main game, would it be possible to allow players who receive a pet during one of the leagues to claim it on the main game? It could either just appear following the player or in their inventory the next time they log into the main game (uninsured), or be able to be claimed from Probita for a 1M fee as if the player had died with the pet insured (it would be automatically insured in this case).
---
I prefer wiki, most of my friends use slayermusiq1

It's scamming. Scamming is against the game rules.

How does this twitch prime stuff works? Don't you need to pay something (to twitch) to even get the free membership trial? How do they do that for thousands of accounts I don't understand it.

did the same thing with my smoke staff. chin up brother.
---
Based on Xerics amulet and the lizard men teeth, we could do something similar and make mobs in the stronghold drop something that charges it. Guaranteed drop of 3-15, 1 per tele
---
Then Snape Grass needs to have its farming level requirement lowered. It's the highest tier allotment available. Disingenuous to compare it to lawn grass when simple fruits and vegetables with real life equivalents can be used to make supercompost.

I hope something is said honestly

I was wrongly permanently muted before, took it to twitter and it was resolved. If it‚Äôs a genuine case then an appeal works, but they do mess up sometimes.

If you have 69 herb to make them then possibly, but I don't think there's any way to get crushed dragonscales other than off brutal blue dragons themselves.

‚ÄúThe only way me and my friend are getting 99 strength?‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry; what training method is this; it‚Äôs a stupid graphic of a 99 strength in some digital background.

Over a decade before I came to play when mobile was out.

It's simple for new players to search on youtube or google.
---
The amount of peoole that make videos on looting is a great way to show new players how to make money. Most targets for looting vids are new players.
---
Good, that's hilarious and you deserve to be made an example of.
---
It's absurd how few charges it holds and how annoying it is to recharge considering its only serious use is farming clues
---
Holy fk.
---
I‚Äôve logged in a few times in the past few years to see how items from pre EOC have held value, etc. but honestly I think the graphics are just... ugly. It‚Äôs not the game I grew up playing or remember. 
---
Sorry but rs3 just isn‚Äôt for everyone. 
---
I played OSTS for its simplicity, if I wanted something more advanced I would just go back to playing EVE or WoW.

Besides if I enjoyed the old games play style, why wouldn‚Äôt I just play the old game that is readily available? Lol

Was "Elgin muted" taken by your other account?

hope we get ''jmod smackdown'' on how it works
---
The chat is just a counter from runelite
---
Wow, I haven't seen that object since spawning in invalid items in rsps
---
How about because they can train strength with it
---
Deceiving a player into making them lose their gp for you to gain it is a scam. And if you disagree, you're probably a lurer so your opinion doesn't really matter.
---
He wasn't scamming though, he said they would regret it and they would have.
---
There‚Äôs some relatively easy 250 point tasks like stealing a gem from a gem stall, etc. Also noticed that Arceuss Library and Tithe Farm are decent for points as they give you the XP milestone reward points and their own points for the activity milestones.
---
Seems sketchy but an official jmod reply on this kind of stuff would be helpful. Lesson is don't go to sand casino at the end of the day lol
---
id pay to change mine since i basically cucked myself by not choosing endless endurance. playing on an alt atm and not my main lol it sucks. literally impossible to play without that, out of run energy in 3 seconds can't do a fucking thing. can't imagine cox with no staminas either

I wouldn't even want to do 5 hours of OSRS a day. Heck, I can barely manage 5 hours a week. Don't people have jobs these days? Partners? Social lives?

The wiki should be faster if you have a decent knowledge of the game.

I usually follow the quests on the wiki unless it's some puzzle I really cba to do then I follow his videos.

Both are great though, the speed at which SlayerMusic uploads a guide when a new quest come out is very impressive too. Top boy

Get a  full invent, drop one log/fish and then just keep dropping one. It isnt hard

Was he player killing?

You should keep your propaganda to yourself. Police started with violence first, they're the ones who keeps escalating it and they've just warned that they are gonna use live bullets from now on. You're either one uninformed ignorant bitch or you sure love spreading bullshit propaganda.
---
pro tip: give them actual useless items with no use, demand or value.
---
I just used JackTheRipper as an example, there are plenty of other names that are ACTUALLY offensive/inappropriate.Plus it's my choice to have whatever name I so please. And it's the fact that there was nothing offensive about it. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Both are minor upgrades and generally aren't worth it unless you want to use dragon bolts with em.

Yeah, but on zeah rx is more gathering. Either books or gathering dark essence.

I like oda. But im sorry this is sketchy af dude
---
what
---
Words are just something you use to express yourself,it doesnt matter what some dictionary claims a word means if its not/no longer used that way by the people. It was never stated a player had to directly kill you, and if you rely on someone to do/not to do certain things and dir because they let you down they PK‚Äôd you

More than likely he was ddosed, won the stake. Real owner of account logged in and traded cash off before oda could get back on

sick shit bro

Skillers would still be locked to trading within their factions though.

There just needs to be a way to prevent clans from colluding across faction lines. Not sure how WoW deals with it.

Well, 50% should have less than 100 IQ. Would actually be pretty rare for 100% of them to have 100 or more.

So far your not doing much to change my mind lol kind of helping reinforce it

I'll have you know I am the unicorn who hasnt even picked any yet. I wanted to train agility up to determine whether it's worth going for the ammo perk instead. lol

So if you were in the 19th century you'd say the same thing during the civil war to stop slavery? You'd say the same thing about every civil war ever against a dictator? You're so ignorant and uneducated it's quite insane. Go back to school kid, nobody likes a drop out.

You can literally just play his guide in the background and listen to it as you complete the quest. Why would you want to have to keep switching screens and reading what to do next? 
---
Splish splash your opinion is trash.
---
They are, you can click gem knights until you get to low hp or your necklace breaks, while with ardy knights you have to open the pouches. Overall ardy knights require more clicks, and can move from the spot even with a splasher.

100 is literally the average human bro. You must watch odablock lmao.

Oh shit that was you in the red hoodie? I remember that

Didn't censor your Oak planks gg account.

Why fletch 4head

Yeah and construction was released in 2006.

Not really fond of odablock but it doesn't matter at all who's involved. Jagex has to answer for this. Throughly.

that would make carrying around things like a dhl/tbow even more unfair lol

I think it's until the end of the November.

How? There is literally no other information about this account other than the time logged. I doubt it‚Äôs OPs reddit name.

ZMI is nice. Just use your runes on the person in front of you and watch something else.

- i won't be using ardy cape, the assembler ammo effect is too big to pass up. 
---
- Idk about god book or mitre...i will need defense bonus. maybe blessed spirit shield + Helm of Neiznot?
---
- I won't be using ice/blood barrage, just ice burst. the idea is to make it as cheap as possible.
---
We are looking at 5-11 prayer bonus. So this will requite 15 super restores?
---
Is this satire? 
---
100 is the average, which means statistically 50% are above and 50% are below.
---
Bro
---
Lol you actually went and made your own thread about this because of the last one...
---
I'll help you out.
---
Google the word "subjective" and all your worries will be magically wiped away.
---
&gt;i will need defense bonus.
---
you have to understand- you need to be crazy good to where you arent getting hit. if you need defense for the inferno you should not be doing a low gear inferno run.
---
&gt;So this will requite 15 super restores?
---
15 restores was considering a high prayer bonus.
---
When you're 70b in debt 10b isn't too much

10-20 seconds ahead, and 1.5 speed makes it so I waste 0 time during quests.
---
I could accomplish this with wiki guides as well, but it would take more effort.
---
It is offensive to alot of women :)
---
They are completely different so not comparable and neither is better than the other.
---
Is twisted leauge the french version
---
This is more afk and profit than barb fishing because you don't need to drop the fish. You use a hammer on the eels to extract the items automatically.
---
The obvious joke in this makes me kind of nervous as I've said the things screwing around when bored. Only ever at the most random places though. Examples: I've certainly spammed stuff like "doubling money" or "free armor trimming" on fishing trawler for 30 minutes, As well as pest control, tithe farm, and standing beside konar. Most people have a sense of humor, but it's like the detection system doesn't. Perhaps I'll stop.
---
If you type "dd" next to them, they follow you and you can lead them to dark wizards. I do it a lot.

Got muted a 2 day mute a while ago with a threatening email saying if I did it again I would be permed.  Posted on reddit, never got a reply but my mute was reversed that day and the email deleted.  I hope you get the same stroke of luck I did and don‚Äôt let the haters demotivate you.

Sign up for Amazon prime trial, connect prime to twitch, get one week of free membership.

For lms, everyone gets the same stats, regardless of your character's stats. Just play the game and win.
---
Profit.
---
My exact method, except I think I use 1.25 speed.  Keeping him 20 seconds ahead, I always know exactly whats coming up next, which serves the dual purpose of ensuring I waste 0 time standing around waiting for him to move on (since he sometimes skips through dialogue kind of slowly, or stops to say or explain something for longer than it takes to do it), while also letting me know what location is up next so that I can take the fastest path there even if he doesn't, while then skipping the video forward for the difference.  
---
IMO there's no beating that method of easy/fast/braindead questing.

I set up auto typer sometimes to host a fashionscape show and give the winner 1m. No one ever participates and I assume they think I‚Äôm a bot cause of autotyper. I wonder if I‚Äôve been reported lol

I love wiki much more than Slayermusiq1 but that‚Äôs just my opinion. I will admit though sometimes you do need to see it to understand what to do better, wiki didn‚Äôt help me with MM1 but the video he made made it so easy to follow along. 
---
On a side note does anyone remember the channel that also did quest videos, I believe it was a girl with her name having something to do with a cat/kitty

No one cares about your opinion bro ,stop trying to seek attention. Also its "than", ironic.

Anyone know if Vorkath is worth Ironman time ?

I like it there just as a gold sink. Let people be dumb or waste their money. End of the day, millions if not billions of coins are leaving the game daily which is good for the economy.

Jagex won't come near this thread with a million foot pole. If you expected them to, you must be new here.
---
I wonder what percentage of rwt the sand casino is responsible for. Even if people dont buy gp to stake directly again which im sure happens,some people probably buy 20m-30m for their rebuild after getting cleaned. Next thing they know they have bought hundreds of mills over the year.
---
They are not selling anything that is copyrighted. Digital fake currency in the game is not IP and is not copyrighted. If you can link me to what part of the Copyright clause is being violated please do and I will admit you are right and concede to this argument.
---
But the coins aren't leaving the game at all, they are just transfered between players.
---
Nice, thanks for the reply. I keep seeing Youtubers/streamers who are claiming to be #1 or whatever (looking at Bekt‚Äôs day 1 twisted league) and only show total level which really doesn‚Äôt mean much

SO this guy was barbarian fishing in a max cape on a high risk world (As of 5 minutes ago) and I jokingly hit him with blowpipe, he ran to the bank at tree gnome and comes back in max tank gear and warns me lol.. IF anyone wants juicy loot have at him - share screenshots if you get him!
---
There's nothing literally nothing fraudulent about a lure. You're willingly going into a dangerous area with your items. Otherwise using a bait account to attract a pker to run into your clan would also be considered a scam. Or jagex is scamming everybody by having the rev caves in the wilderness! 
---
Again, if you go into the wilderness you are taking that risk yourself. Being promised a good item off of killing somebody is not fraudulent if there's also a team of ancient maces and dspears waiting to log in at the same time
---
It's bc your cursor isn't the trout!
---
Can we re-poll the ability to have multiple clue scrolls? It was recently implemented as a relic in Twisted Leagues and I think it would be a nice QOL addition to the main game.
---
It was DMM but not ridiculously punishing.
---
1b \~\~ 500$USD so yeah, I imagine there various wholesale things that go on like any normal business, but if you sold it 1B at a time atleast, its like 50k$USD.

Mugger and a varrock stray? Only only situation I can think of

There‚Äôs also an altar you can use in the Sarachis tunnel(don‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called)

I just wish I could use my DarkScape cape on OSRS. Such a cool design gone to waste on RS3, a game I will never play.
---
There is a tax on stakes now, so there is definitely gp vanishing from the game
---
Sorry I was just memeing because I've only train rc by ToG so far
---
The Arena takes a % of the stake and acts as a gold sink.
---
just saying oda is the type of streamer to attract trolls who would do this for the laugh/content, much like ice poseidon
---
Yup. That is my issue with it. I've been playing since release and it hasn't done much for me.
---
Not bannable, just dickish.
---
Thats a really beautifully edited picture.
---
every stake is taxed
---
Gotta admit I play pokemon guys

The DC itself was about 1-2 minutes tops being frozen in-game, then he was having trouble logging back in and getting "connection lost" messages on the login page where it shows your membership info.

Ddos is distributed denial of service, these are just Dos since they use a single big booter service to knock a world off temporarily most times but some people have access to bigger nets

the duel arena gets people hooked who otherside would never become rwt customers and would never develop an online gambling problem.  the duel arena is the gateway drug of sorts.

The best combo with your stats is to msb. G maul insta immediately to the obby maul for the ko's. Watch some msb gmaul vids on youtube to learn.

Yeah I play at work while doing other tasks in parallel. It's perfect, and, in my opinion, ideal for maximizing point gain. I really enjoy PVM though, so skipping on Unnatural Selection was tough

Lmao sure thing just let me call up the jagex hotline and check up on that one for ya

Ohh the classic "autoclick 94 mage before do anything in case i get banned" i lost faith to jagex ban system after my 9th 94 mage auto clicked on new pk accounts

I only ever used slayermusiq to watch the galvek and glough fights before I tried them. Apart from that, wiki all the way. A nice ordered list with in depth instructions and options so I can make my own mind up instead of monkey see monkey do.

Slayer task btw
---
Fuck me.

He's a millionaire irl, i highly doubt he cares

From the trouver parchment wikia page:
---
Lastly, players also can remove the lock status on an item by using it on Perdu, in which he will return the Trouver parchment as well as 95% of the locking fee.
---
Not sure if accurate, feel free to test. Seems like a decent solution all things considered..
---
**_no engaging game play_** Have you ever played OSRS? Half the game is afkable on your mobile phone.
---
LOL yeah jagex is legit a bunch of brain dead fat lipped donkeys ngl
---
Cost of full trident?
---
&gt; It's not some Jagex conspiracy to take your friends away lmao.
---
I never said it was...I'm just a bit annoyed that they keep coming up with separate little offshoot game modes, rather than focusing exclusively on expanding the base game. 
---
My rather cynical take on it is that stuff like DMM and Twisted Leagues allow them to re-use resources with tiny little tweaks, package it up in a kinda interesting way, and then release it as something new, and they keep choosing to do that to save money/time rather than actually putting in work to create new things. Why create new maps and monsters and armor when you can just give people extra XP and a few little buffs to use and people will eat it up anyway?
---
Didn't know. To be honest it should just be 100% so it can act as a free toggle depending on what you do.
---
Yep they are definitely gonna read your reddit post at 3 am their time
---
didnt the other guy donate a lot to him
---
Are you talking about slayer tasks? End game tasks? Levelling tasks? Bossing?
---
Think before u type maybe cause only some have cons for example what's the con of picking ur slayer and farm contract, nothing lol. 
---
So saying they're designed to have pros AND cons would be an incorrect statement. 
---
Would like to hear what jagex team member has to say about it which is why I wrote it here, spoken with a lot of the community and as long as it's a on off toggle over seen nobody having an issue with it since it's as If I never picked the relic.
---
These are factual things protestors are concerned with. You should consider the motivations of the western media as much as you consider those of the eastern media. Whether you agree with me or not, upon some introspection surely we will agree the western media is not concerned with freedom and democracy now any more than it was when it manufactured consent for the gulf war part 2.
---
I sure hope he knows lol.

Look, another sub 1200 mobile player who bought into the anti-pvp meme and wants to be a part of the club by regurgitating it!

You can split your screen so browser with the guide is in one half and runescape client is in the other half. This is how I did every quest. For the most part I used wiki guides, though there were some parts having a video helped.

Can you double the drop rate of mossy key when in wilderness? This puts it in line with the Giant Key. This has been mentioned previously 3 times before during Q/A's, responses sounded like it'd be a quick change.

Also, Bryophyta as 1 of the only 2 F2P bosses, it seems strange that it doesn't drop any unique item for F2P. Can this be looked at?
---
You could use a lower tier crossbow, true. It'll be very low dps though.
---
I mean 1) if you want a response you should repost it tomorrow during peak time. and 2) although you may not have intended it as a scam it can easily be considered one. perm mute seems unfair though.
---
? Unnatural Selection and Endless Endurance are different tiers.

Forget the roots. Imagine how many addy scimmys you could pk with those death runes!

It is ok. The XP is good enough, but the fishing is kinda tedious, like medium click-intensive. Remember to buy the merfolk trident, and ofc the diving stuff.
---
Hello, FBI? Btw, I‚Äôm not going to bring a bomb to the airport tomorrow lol.
---
Idk if it‚Äôs worse or not, but currently 30 games dry fishing trawler and it‚Äôs starting to piss me off.
---
Why do you care lol? It‚Äôs fun
---
February 23, 2005   - which was a Wednesday
---
What about the lures that don't involve any pvp areas?
---
... it is no different than it is now lol. I just suggest a more robust way to do it. Less scamming. No black markets. Give people their 50/50 gambling. Since they added buyable bonds i view jagex as 100% supporting the 50/50 reall currency backed gambling. 
---
I hosted dice/flowers/horsey etc. For years. Gambling has no fucking place in runescape. So we either embrace it fully and flesh it out or fuck the whole thing off in every aspect. 
---
If the DA was removed overnight the demand for staling would still be there, most would move offsite but still use rsgp for bets.
---
to late for that one chose another relic -.- what mobs are good for grinding clue scrolls?
---
ahh thanks
---
Mods are allowed to swear, why are you just screen shotting something with no content anyways
---
Agreed, wiki for anything but grandmasters for me.
---
Snitch
---
Why
---
Nice
---
From what I've seen, Hill Giants to start. You can get that tier 4 relic that increases clue drop rate too. I still need 900 points for it. I'm already committed to taking it as that's about the absolute best source of gear, plus the clues stack.
---
I‚Äôm such an air head today, jeez
---
I wonder what its like to have so little going on in your life to have this somehow matter a single fuck. Go outside people already.
---
Hope you‚Äôre out of there and scaping in comfort soon brother! Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre there but hope you‚Äôre well soon!
---
Weird Flex but Ok.
---
had so much fun smacking people on darkscape with obby maul
---
Who's Joel?
---
booooo
---
They won‚Äôt be discontinued though
---
you don't have to deal with his fuckin annoying as all cunt voice if you go the wiki
---
bruh howd he get obsidian in twisted league
---
Sounds like boot lol but good luck with that
---
Well deserved
---
Yes, it's a place to gamble in game gold by setting specific rules for 1v1 duels, where the outcome is based on RNG.
---
Nah don't need feathers was just an example
---
Catch me composting my enemies with a 2 tick ham joint
---
Yes, haha. I remember a guy fletching magic bows. What a pro he was.
---
Jesus fuck who thinks like this? issa joke man
---
With the duriel321 audio playing in the background for the whole hour
---
Ah cheers 7 days is probably what I've been after. Yeah I have been on in ages and it seems the kingdom stops using my money and generating resources when I take time off from the game
---
The long-tap is definitely terrible, I play in single-tap mode if I'm doing anything that requires even a moderate amount of right clicking.
---
There's no way to verify this. But the majority of people i knew that play OSRS on release were in it for the combat system, pvm and to skill. Mind you i started as a 1 def/pray pure.
---
By that logic take away all the American servers cause the Venezuelans are close by. Let all the servers be in Antarctica so we never have to worry about gold farmers?
---
Guys! This is a photoshop! Look around the image, and you'll notice compression etc. artefacts and noise that's not present on the screen, even the solid colors! That means the image on the screen was added afterwards.
---
He he sea shanty no there XD oziach Talk Next? HEhe Ecksdee :)
---
Why on earth would you make a pking account that you can't collect loot on?
---
Forgeability cost sets price more than demand. 6k &gt; 50M if 100 grind at 500k ea easily more
---
Almost 100% sure it doesn't work the same way
---
Otherwise why would the merfolk trident cost like 500k?
---
&gt;You lost 10b to a dc? To bad son. Lost xp and items to a DMM bug? Well kinda fix that.
---
take this post with a grain of salt, its more likely the dc was a guise to hide the fact that he just RWT'd 10b. Also the most recent DMM tournament was done twice because the first time a lot of people got screwed over. It ain't perfect but you act like they don't even try.
---
Pking low lvl bots and never gain xp or combat lvls while pking so I can do it forever. I can always loot on an alt
---
Whats the point of this? The lvl 1 birds are in kebos swamp.
---
$11
---
hop worlds bro
---
There are spots north of the castle, along the sand crab beach, and around the farming guild
---
I have 6 accounts and this is the first thing I have done each time lol, straight to 99 no ban
---
It makes me so jaded and burnt out and angry knowing people have billions of gp from breaking the rules, whereas I'm trying to buy my first item that costs 100mil and it's taking like 2 months of doing stuff I don't enjoy because I can't get myself to farm Vorkath or do CoX for more than an hour at a time, plus I've got to pray for decent RNG that I never get while doing it. 
---
Like what the fuck am I even doing
---
Nudes at least they can fap to. The real weird thing is there's guys out there actually paying for pics of feet. Walking utensils, that you can already see everywhere for free when it's spring or summer. Why????
---
I had a friend go $2,000 in debt because of the sand casino.  Gambling sucks.
---
I thought copperlongtail was the first spot, so I stay there for a good chuck of time failing to capture them. Saw some one who did the same and told him the same. There no message saying you were too low level to capture them. so yea.
---
Does cr1tikal still have like all of them?
---
Except the duel arena purpose isn't to be a gambling hub. Its supposed to be a place where two people can fight on an agreed set of rules while being guaranteed their winnings. The fact people use it to coin flip says more about the player base than the content itself.
---
Congrats mate, don't forget to have fun. Easy to get lost in the grind at higher levels down the road and burn out.
---
Trade Safely
---
Ah I see, surprised jagex hasn't allowed an option for no exp from PvP yet
---
Assuming it‚Äôs 2.5k charged then it‚Äôs 1.37m
---
nope, points can be earned, turn p2p, then spent
---
r u kiddin me u couldnt see that coming
---
Man you have low standards
---
They will come from in game content if it gets discontinued.
---
They used the exact same pictures. Only changed the part that says runescape. Did it about 2 hours after the other was posted too
---
F
---
Could be another theory?
---
Its true. U can confirm this yourself. Stake ur friend 1k each and have him xlog. U wont get 2k, just 1k and he will have no gp.
---
for gp dont just do any600k-1m/h method
---
If they have already entered the economy.
---
They can't refund people their real money because of an exploit.
---
This was an issue with the twisted bow bug.
---
They have said before that they dont expect anyone to complete every task.
---
By not choosing the combat relics, you cant get the raids challenges, but if you picked the clue scroll one you can complete the clue steps that the combat people wouldnt have been able to do and so on and so on
---
According to the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Trident_of_the_seas) they do the same thing
---
Merfolk trident is expensive because no one wants to farm jt
---
"most" wouldnt because everyone knows those sites are scams or eventually become scams.  people already addicted would.
---
Just buy them from ge lmao
---
Honestly, who the fuck even bothers with that shit? take a shower your chair stinks.
---
That's not even really much less effort.
---
Found a walker
---
i don‚Äôt know what any of that means. i literally lost 27m today on accident. i have no idea how to play this game.
---
5 hp / 10 energy drain every 5 minutes is completely off set by natural regeneration so thats neat
---
Not me in the clip lol
---
Wrong sub
---
pisc favor, sand worms, chins
---
ah, not for me.  must have to do with search history.
---
Does anyone know how to delete accounts? Or to detach accounts from emails? Either would work.
---
They refunded those who got hacked by Jed
---
... explain? Or are you just providing a positive point to my suggestion?
---
Pets get blocked by other players/npc sometimes so there is another dude with a zulrah pet.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really seem like a lie to me? Perused through OP‚Äôs post history and nothing about this seems disingenuous?
---
Raids, bird in the swamp from level 1
---
There is not, trust me, he walked around and they both followed him
---
How do you get xp from pisc favour
---
While the drop rates arent technically affected, they actually are...sort of. Most pet drop rates are based on the exp of an action. If something givens 500 farming exp, its more likely to drop a pet than something that gives 5. Its not a perfect 1:1, but thats the jist of it.
---
So by getting 1-99 fishing (for example) on leagues, you have a rate of getting the pet that is comparable to the rate of getting 1-99 on the main game, except you got it in, at bare minimum, 1/5 the time
---
Maybe. I did it incognito.
---
You have to really learn the mechanics, time your eating and whatnot. You shouldn't take literally any damage from poison or minion attacks. I got 3-4 kill trips with dhide and blowpipe, no bgs, fairly high ranged lvl. Learn to woox walk. Use your spec when you want to eat... But keep in mind sometimes you'll have to eat anyways if your spec noodles
---
ironman thinking of trying to do Swan Song soon, I wanted to know what kind of gear I should have before attempting it? Never done the quest before.
---
I've hated video guides all my life. So much wasted time. Did quest cape with almost exclusively quick guides on the wiki. Looked up Galvek and Vorkarth on YouTube, other than that quick guides are accurate and plentiful.
---
All the times I wanted something in a game to be explained in the 3 minutes it should take, but I have to listen to a drooling kid for 40min. Looking at you modded minecraft.
---
I mean, the fact that he wants one of the league rewards and can't obtain it shows that both the rewards are desired and they're difficult to obtain, which tells me that the league is doing exactly what it set out to do. Nice job Jagex :D

If you're going to raid anyway, do them first.

You can get quite a significant amount of planks that way.

Addiction is a consequence. I daredevil wouldn't jump over a shark tank because they want to fall in, but if they do, it's their own fault.
---
Tfw twisted league is what put you in the ICU in the first place. This is what happens when you don‚Äôt go endless endurance.
---
Automated ones do, manual ones don't I think
---
but did you rub oziachs belly?
---
I believe you can do aerial fishing too? Idk if thats fast tho
---
Remove p-mods
---
Jmod smackdown plz
---
use a foot pedal
---
I'm guessing more then that has been said. For awhile now at random I've been logging on and saying some dumb shit along the lines of, "Anyone wanna lend me gear for 10 seconds to flex @ friends on discord" and I've had a lot of upset/angry people giving me shit and after doing it a few times for HOURS at a time nothing has come of it.
---
thanks
---
Its a tricky one, as someone can hack an account and reset it that way.
---
Moss giants won‚Äôt drop clues on twisted league, they only have access to beginner clues which aren‚Äôt obtainable
---
I would still argue that having the first choice you make getting into the mode be one with an objectively correct and incorrect answer that cannot be reversed is not a good idea, its highly punishing to any more casual players especially because as i said in my post it absolutely does not look like endurance is as overloaded as it is.  
---
additionally rerolling is not a good option, firstly because making a new account for it is basically saying "give jagex money for this decision" and secondly because if you are like me and have been playing 6+ hours a day for 2 weeks most people like me have either convinced themselves they didnt make the wrong decision (you can tell these people by the way they react violently to having their choice questioned) or just quitting league.
---
Probably the least of worries in a temp game mode
---
Subjective.
---
yep he is the guy with the microphone gain turned all the way up
---
I welcome it
---
no way jagex lets these become the next party hat
---
Yeah was bugging me too man, 
---
No worries I got you
---
I wonder how many accounts logged into the Deadman worlds when they first started. Could be a neat comparison to see which had more initial interest.
---
Could also use a percentage of daily players to account for a different sized player base.
---
MY FAVORITE BEST!!!!!!

They‚Äôre giving us some stats next Q and A so be sure to catch it!

Imagine having to explain to your grandchildren why you're a fucking nonce.

Anyone know if he carried on staking , I had to go after he paid back the 10b
---
Kempq is a youtuber, probably doesnt make shit lol. 3.5k subs is ez 10k/month, wouldnt risk pilot salary for that
---
I went endurance, 3x harvester, artisan, treasure seeker l, and just unlocked focus.
---
I want to do a decent amount of pvm including raids, and clues are fun.
---
~~&gt;Rinse and repeat~~
---
\&gt; Start ironman
---
I'm pretty sure the expected "solution" is just starting another account for TL if you're that unhappy with your relic choice. You're told super clearly that you don't get to change your relic. They all have their own pros/cons and their own playstyles
---
So... How is the way magic works different to the strength bonus meta for melee?
---
Yeah it's especially annoying due to the low level scrubs flinching them and taking forever.
---
Is 5 the max number of charges? If so, it reserves a slot for the max number. Like if I have a games necklace(8), those will keep a reservation; but a lesser number will fill the same spot.
---
that's okay, we can't all be right i suppose.
---
 The same thing happened to albxo the night before except he literally killed the guy before server dc.

Guy who he was fighting double name changed right after so he's probably one of the DDoSers
---
1t or lazy flick slayer, make restores in raids, prayer useless for clues. Endurance is best for raids by far
---
It would make skilling viable moneymakers. Imagine having woodcutting be profitable.
---
Is the reason you hide your name cus you autoclicked 94 mage? :)
---
Don't even attempt it yet. Every time you die to it you get progressively less loot from the casket.
---
If just stash it in the bank until you have at the very least full black dhide and broad arrows. Ranging pots, brews, super restores would be ideal.
---
That's my thought. It's not like it's a gamble where you don't know what they do. Each relic is clearly stated and tells you exactly what they do. On top of that, if you have other questions there are plenty of posts about them as well.
---
Staking is a necessary evil.
---
Upvoted
---
It could be a reward from elite pvm diarys. But just a few multiple scrolls.

It happens   deal with it and don't be a crying cunt in reddit.

The potion would double the DPS of blowpipe. The potion would also be useful for boss crashers. The potion would be crazy at PoH bosses.

---
Loving twisted league at the moment, personally I would love to see a lot of data (On top of what is already planned for the upcoming stream) at the end of the league, in terms of what data I would like to see, I was thinking of the following.
---
- How many people completed certain tasks (Will we have one madman do 200m Agility?, How many people got 99fm etc.)
---
- The most popular relics of each tier.
---
- As well as the most popular relics, the most popular full relic builds or relics commonly picked after certain relics. For example I would think that most people taking Unnatural selection would also be more likely  to take Konar's blessing with the clear advantage it gives for slayer.
---
- Average skill levels / relic points.
---
- Number of significant drops. (Dragon Warhammers, Pets, CoX uniques, Uniques/Mega rares from clues etc.)
---
As well as this I was wondering if it would be possible to have some form of collection log that only covered certain leagues, this would mean in the future with future leagues you would still be able to look back and see what drops you got in a specific previous league. 
---
And in regards to future league worlds being locked behind previous performance, would this be for the league before it or from any league? (For example if I got A Rune trophy in twisted league, didn't participate in League #2 but wanted to compete in League #3, could I access the worlds with a trophy restriction?)
---
Not at all
---
Leagues are leagues and not the main game.
---
 Less than* guess you watch oda too.

I got muted for a week for saying "halving money. No scam" whenever I went to the GE

This account actually did get hacked when I originally played, I fell for the "Jagex blocks you from saying your password look \*\*\*\*\*\*\*" trick. 10 year old me was so naive.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
750k emblem protected over ags and statius warhammers. Rip 15 yr old me
---
That's great to hear you too got your account back after so long. And yes, this game takes a lot of time, but it's great none the less.
---
And hopefully the smaller osrs content creators like Faux will get to that level of hunkiness one day.
---
Poll another unique item that is used to upgrade guardian boots.
---
Dude whats your name in OSRS? Love me some Dnd and OSRS. PM? :)
---
It's pretty cushy, but I would say in the majority of offices there are ways around the rules if you want there to be.  Like playing on your phone off the wifi.  Or using a remote desktop.  I've found a way to covertly fuck around on the internet in every office job I've ever had.
---
Thanks
---
Why do people feel the need to talk shit and pretend to know things they don‚Äôt on the osrs subreddit?  I see morons like you make baseless accusations daily here.

Holy fuck.

Me big dumb.
---
No, but you don't really need to. The fact that your response to "nobody wants an addiction" is "they did it to themselves" shows your blatant lack of understanding of the topic.
---
Yep. Ive seen people go up to 70b from staking. Many of the people I used to raid with would love flexing how much gp they had when they're up and act like they're top shit. But no matter how much they made it was never enough you bet every single one of them got cleaned. They didn't have that same attitude when they were begging me for 5m.
---
.... mage is op in pvp, where are you getting your info from???
---
Oda&gt;Ice rofl
---
Oh someone will get it.
---
Can you change/add a new option, to buy potions/food with one left click at ToB? 
---
Also add an option to sell back bought potions/food in case someone buys the wrong item. (Only bought items, so ppl dont end up selling their own potions to generate points, altough, personaly i wouldn't mind, since it doensn't change their reward/mvp potential at the end.)
---
you can now, see my above comment
---
aee my above comment
---
Tbf, I think hes #1 in EHP tho
---
Not sure where to check ranks on that but hes at least higher than the #1 on the highscores in that regard
---
Am nub, what is the crab $11 joke?
---
Idc tbh. Why is this still a thing. Jagex should remove this RWT casino.
---
havent played twisted league at all, what is happening in this clip?
---
Essence implings
---
Lmaooo I know you irl
---
Thanks for the info I‚Äôll take it into consideration if I need to post again
---
steal strange fruit from the fruit stalls and train your agility using barb fishing. It's not as good as stamina potions but it really really makes a difference.
---
Lowest NPC is Big Frogs with 18HP. 
---
Only option is Essence Implings unfortunately.
---
Thanks for the info I‚Äôll take it into consideration if I have to post again
---
One of the first few times that my friends and I played DnD, I used dragon slayer as my reference. Probably the second time I DM‚Äôd, first time not using an actual dnd adventure... used the wiki guide to build off of. All was going well, then one of my friends (who still plays osrs) asked if it would be possible to kill the goblin and use tele grab instead of paying for the key. Everyone quickly realized it was dragon slayer shortly after that! Awesome to see what you‚Äôre doing with it!!
---
Yeah I think they want to pretend the duel arena doesn't exist lol, I hope the DA gets deleted from the game tbh
---
I‚Äôve played this game on and off for 15 years now and it‚Äôs just something special. Decided to try out Btw mode with a friend with the recent prime membership. It‚Äôs been a blast to say the least! 5 days of inefficiency left ahead but I feel like btw mode chances the pace of it all to how I like to play. 
---
Aight ima head out, but I‚Äôve got a bonus panel as soon as I can figure out how to load it.
---
With imbued ring of wealth for hard clues
---
And what rewards would be given for completing them? I think a lot of players would worry they may affect metas significantly
---
I meant because you get some free con xp repairing and you get gp from crates to use later on con.
---
No. U should have read what u picked. That's it. Get over it.
---
Problem is, cosmics are a relatively low chance roll for them so I'd like to discover something better, like I mentioned in the body.  But at the end of the day they're better than nothing, thanks.
---
Yeah, it's a bit of a ree that recoils are essentially combat locked.  I may grind out implings out of frustration alone.
---
Does the VOD show last logged in time when he relogs?
---
Unlikely. Seems they rarely catch/punish one off sellers and mainly chase down the big guys. Over the last three years before I quit i probably sold around 5-6 with never an issue, same with everyone else in my group.
---
Streaming content I suppose. If you die, you can always start over and break the monotony for the viewers.
---
If you have a gmail account you can use same email for another account just add a 1 at the end or any other number right before the @.
---
I dont get it?
---
How about the default plugins in runelite?
---
That would defeat the point of playing the league in the first place.
---
That‚Äôs what everyone says until the last time it happens.
---
Mat K: We're not your parents.
---
&gt;start complaining about rng everywhere
---
Yep rank 1 has a lot of easy experience including 200m strength, firemaking, and thieving.
---
If enough people upvote this, jagex can probably find this guy pretty easily since he didn‚Äôt blur any of his levels or total xp. This scumbag doesn‚Äôt deserve a level 2 pet.
---
?
---
Save it until you have done druidic ritual.
---
Better for you to unlock the upper level before getting the outfit. Saves so much time
---
Alpha's only what?
---
Download a bot and pick flax
---
That‚Äôs incredible!
---
This is exactly the reason why I don't both with making a HCIM myself.
---
Oh okay, that's weird
---
Only til 5%. Theres a shop where you can buy compost and then you shovel saltpetre. The NPC takes the fertilizer straight from your bank after you make it and it is an easy way to get the 45% favor needed for the cooking
---
I wanted to get farming started so I spent most of my start there too. started to branch out once i got to medium contracts though.
---
I'd also pick harvester, the faster farming ticks are nuts
---
\#EnduranceGang
---
Just saying but your account creation date is a vital part of your account recovery.
---
Unironically probably the best drop since they‚Äôre so scarce.  Accumulator is coming through for house teleports early on.
---
yeah, you can actually still see your name at the bottom lol
---
If you want to afk at work, get courier. Its that simple - it fits your playstyle, go for it. I regret not taking courier, because I cant afk on twisted league during exams period so im missing out on a ridicolous amount of xp. 
---
Unnatural selection is great, but you can manage without. Although, if you want your main focus to be on pvm, i‚Äôd say its a must.
---
I saw a guy called Dumb Slut yesterday
---
No you brain let, smack down as to where the lost 10b is.
---
3rd age now can fire dragon arrows
---
Yes it did. So wrecked was a pvper, and he's the one who pushed for the petition for old-school.
---
Granted, everyone wanted it, but PvP was the most powerful force, bonesaw included.
---
Looks more like rsgloryandgold
---
Hmm, if you're doing thT get the artisan one instead. 2x xp on firemaking.
---
So... summoning
---
Jared told me you have to pay them 11 dollars to play twisted league
---
Endurance would be just as useful on mainland and would still be the #1 choice.
---
He‚Äôs one of top watched rs streamers and you think he‚Äôs purposely building debt to make a name for himself? Ok then lol
---
Also you call him a staker but he mainly high risk pks, not sure what you‚Äôre on about
---
Wiki is superior yes.
---
The only way to kill a creature without gaining hp xp in kourend is a ring of recoil.  You need cosmics to enchant those - and cosmics are virtually only dropped through combat.
---
Lmao alts. Maybe don't comment on the method if you've clearly never even done it properlt
---
did you see a noticeable increase in nests from yew to magic? I am doing birdhouses purely for profit atm and am wondering if I can expect to see the ~1 extra nest per run needed to make magic more profitable than yew.
---
To be fair, if there's a lot of PvM content to do and you choose warrior, there are tasks (and huge points) for going over lv99 (50-250mil). So, may as well overlevel in atk/def/str/hp passively. Just a brief counterpoint.
---
Nice work, the thumbnail looks like he has a cowboy hat on
---
Ok but if you are standing 3 ticking literally all 3 are a waste so thats a useless point.  All are very strong, but from watching streamers and seeing the reaction on not only this sub but from people I've encountered in TL, endurance is the most optimal choice.  Getting around to things faster is key in this mode with such limited teles. 
---
I dont see where the prayer one comes in handy other than 200mxp.  Once you have 43 prayer its all but irrelevant since you can just pray flick or use potions.   The magic one does seem decent, but realistically what are you going to be casting 1000's of times in this mode anyway?  Almost all the ranged ammo in this mode is easily accessible outside of getting d knives or something rare.  
---
Outside of literally standing still 3 ticking something, endurance benefits the entire game mode, whereas the others do not.
---
True, but who's gonna wait to pick their first relic?  Imagine doing early game grinds with no run energy just to go back and pick endurance later.  Sure, it doesnt force you to pick, but its handicapping yourself to not pick one right away especially if you end up taking endurance.
---
Yes
---
Oh.
---
Fuck.
---
Original goal was to add in uniques to the loot crates and to make the emblems zero sum. BUT, the uniques failed (not shocking). Pkers were still yelling for a profitable experience...so yea...
---
Current system was a bit rushed it feels...
---
If you're fast it's probably really good before everyone can do most tasks while they're busy at wintertodt and Barb fishing
---
The only thing it devalues is not having to stop your slayer task to complete a clue everytime you get it. 
---
Clue rewards are devalued by how useless they are, not how easy they are to get.
---
This is really cool!
---
This is so obviously fake
---
Hangovers are xp waste
---
Trust no one with your items.
---
definitely almost did this; thanks
---
i saw a clip of alfie getting dragon hasta, and thought thats cool that weapons like that, will be bis at certain times

If something looks too good to be true, it probably is, e.g. gold giveaways

Yuge!

Red helmet man bad

i‚Äôve seen bots advertising gold buying websites at the castle courtyard

Reeeee

I hope I don‚Äôt get anything super rare, otherwise I‚Äôm gonna be so sad I can‚Äôt transfer items over lol

Why do people watch this shit? If you wanted to see people with mental deficiencies bet 5k on a coinflip you could go down to the slot machines at your local casino on senior discount night.

Ruh ruhhh ruh ruh ruuuuuuuuuh ruh
---
This photo was on front page 1-2 days ago with the kid on mspaint eriting "this school is shit" or something like that
---
Fun fact, WT doesn't actually take any run energy. I would start and end a game at 100%.
---
And then they‚Äôll explode
---
Ava's is QoL, endurance is game changing (woox's raid solo)
---
Hi new, I'm old...
---
No?
---
Ok
---
Just experience the game and ask for help, I'm sure people would help, if you really need help, youtube is always there.
---
I don't even stake, but I would disable staking instantly on my account. If I ever got hacked somehow they couldn't try to use my account for staking.
---
heyyyyy
---
**gambling* addiction
---
I would go insane not opening those. I can barely do 5 without opening
---
Endurance gives 4x hp regen rate, so at low hp you never use food.
---
Runelite quickchats can be edited to say w/e you want anyway
---
Same bro! Gratz I just got my the other day too for the first time, only took 15 years
---
so many posts with rangers in first 20ish clues, and yet everyone says drops wasn't altered, so many pets too. getting suspicious ^^
---
Lol weed pig
---
yep
---
&gt; I think a lot of people that don't actually watch him get the wrong idea from seeing a few clips.
---
That's because he's annoying as fuck and his chat is cancer lol. He's a good pker but if I'm watching Oda it's because 1) nobody else is streaming and 2) I mute him so i don't have to hear his banshee screams.
---
Medium has a step where you need to kill a barbarian for a key to the chest in the Exam Center
---
44 con from 99 FM, slightly disappointing.
---
The biggest issue is that it reduces the value of all clue rewards as a whole.  It's a significant buff to clue hunting, and I think it being restricted to leagues is a good thing.
---
Oda isn‚Äôt out here abusing viewers lmao.
---
Dcb is made of mythical metal by some dragon-like creatures capable of destroying cities. Msb is a blue stick and some string. Your point is invalid.
---
I haven‚Äôt even started farming guild yet! Just picked up the level yday, on my todo list for this evening after work. Should be able to stack a good amount of seeds flying thru contracts. 
---
I realized that in order to even be able to 1-tick farm I need a shit load of seeds to even keep up haha like way more then I can thieve in 5 mins
---
Perfect, I'll check it out. Thank you
---
How can I be upset when I only had to pay some chick 8k to be my rs gf for the day
---
Sorry but the market cap on BTC is nowhere near the world's total wealth. Think before you type
---
That fact isn't even slightly fun. Misleading.
---
They've made it clear they haven't, and most likely will not adjust drop rates just for the league.  But in future leagues they may choose to balance those things, but as of now it's definitely too early to tell if they need to.
---
Auto correct got me.
---
‚ÄúLegacy PvM‚Äù 110+ bossing/raiding discord clan. Firecape/ barrows gloves/ 30m bank and 70 agility required.

Do the contracts give you any bonus farming xp? I got gift of gatherer too because I dont like farming
---

---
Looney PVM - a very social PVM clan, we have PVM events, do a lot of raids together, GWD, teach TOB to newcomers, you are more than welcome to join! I will pm you a discord link.
---
i think he means pvm, but whatever
---
&gt; That's gonna disappear very quickly
---
Disagree, it's 16,025 cannonballs
---
Or even just use at least a 1080p display have 1 on each side.
---
Can you please add further task extensions to be purchased from Slayer Masters; such as Dagannoth, Smoke Devils, Dust Devils etc.
---
You sure you didn‚Äôt drop them and click yes to dropping them?
---
Nobody would use it.  The people who are "addicted" to staking would never disable it.  These people that cry on reddit about their addiction and how its Jagex's fault don't actually have any interest in changing; they're just salty because they probably recently lost a bunch of money and don't want to take personal responsibility.
---
I've never staked in the true sense.  My friends and I used to put up random junk from our banks in the stakes just for fun, but now they've ruined that.  Honestly, they've regulated the duel arena so much that they might as well just remove staking.  There's no way to have clean fun with it anymore.
---
WT is intro content tho, what about raids? Don't need staminas, therefore extra Inv space.
---
Plenty of pvp, have you even seen the plow fields?
---
I prefer barb fishing over drift net personally but ye drift nets are nice
---
Good, screw oda and his annoying ass voice and streams. Maybe his staking bookie will finally come for his knees
---
Arcane courier should definitely be looked at in the future.  Gathering saltpeter, flax, thieving should all be included, while it's absurd to have ess blocks included.
---
Lol when rs is life
---
So they hacked you, just to bot on the account and not do anything else?
---
Also what does them not having access to your email have to do with changing password?
---
Nice blaming the game instead of checking whether its your mistake, LMAO
---
It‚Äôs hyperbolic but it doesn‚Äôt change the message much. Crypto is a bad fad.
---
I don‚Äôt agree, I have plenty of friends who swear they‚Äôll never go back and always end up back getting cleaned.
---
It‚Äôs the first purple in twisted.
---
So you are saying that osrs rules allow turning virtual currency to real money? That would be big no no in court.
---
Because high risk pvp world pking is the same as staking. One could argue his fanbase is so aware of his competence that they know for a fact he'll pay off whatever debt he is in. The only other debt accrued that high was copped out of by the looming threat of a facial tattoo or a career ending.
---
If they're 100 other failed games is anything to go by....I have some bad news for you.
---
He sounded pretty down about it during the rest of the stream - just a bit beat up he couldn't as he said, "have more fun" on it and he jumped straight back onto his original dead HC. Think it's just his natural reaction to laugh at things like this.
---
In the end I really don't care what relic you chose. Endurance is great but I decided to do something different that matched my gaming style and I have enjoyed twisted league so far.
---
Taxation is theft
---
It wouldn't give a prompt to make bolts, although if you have the setting enabled it would have a prompt for dropping a high value item. It would be difficult to mess that up
---
That's a fair comment, we can only wait and see where it goes.
---
Dying
---
The server acknowledged Oda as the victor on the dueling board. If you are losing a duel for 10b gold and instead don't lose the duel due to a disconnect, you are essentially winning 10b. So completely speculatively, if rebel or a friend of his did in fact DDOS the world, then he profited by NOT losing 10b.
---
Any way to change my selection of not endurance gang? I don‚Äôt wanna walk anymore.
---
Oda pulling more viewers than any other osrs streamer (average) and ppl act like hes some random kid who stakes...
---
What is your point exactly?
---
Other than botting (for dicing bots, zulrah, or otherwise) or scamming, why would someone want to hijack an account?
---
And password changes have to be done through your email; clicking "change password" in account settings sends you an email that you have to go through to change your password.
---
U up?
---
Please respond
---
Good example here how high iq oda haters have
---
Agreed. I argue this same point whenever someone hates on my patrios lolol yeah they cheat, but why wouldn't you cheat to win hella superbowl rings and bonus incentives?
---
People saying he dropped them.. they'd show up on the floor smh
---
Other people have already said, this would just turn into a clan feeding contest. Not to mention every twisted world would start getting spammed with "join the swap cc to get best rates to transfer gold from your main account to your league account," and "go to (insert gold selling website here) for best prices on osrs league gold"
---
Did you perform a chest compression once every tick tho
---
Regardless of whatever a clueless sheep I am, the guy lied about losing his 10b. And typically, in my life, when fishy shit is going on and someone starts lying, they become a suspect.
---
Can you tell me whos your favourite streamer? Also its an opinion, maybe u dont like his humour or u dont like pking...
---
"add option to to turn plat tokens in to usd"
---
You are saying that that wouldn't be different to current system
---
We are the same, my brother.
---
Depends on the tasks you do but probably in the ~50-60k range
---
Just throwing some numbers around. If half your slayer xp comes from the cannon (and the other half from melee etc.), and you have 80% cannon accuracy, each cannonball is worth 12 slayer xp.
---
~700k xp / 12 xp/cannonball = 58k cannonballs
---
I'm sorry you had to go through that. Hope everyone involved is all right.
---
I also find OSRS pretty comforting in times of trouble- that unique blend of nostalgia, progression, and generally low-stress RPG gameplay can be very calming when times get tough.
---
r/cutenoobs
---
Nothing you can do about it when it's jagex's servers fault either so I don't see a difference
---
Here to flex my level 78 hunter Herbi... Gz though, I hope none of your other pet grinds take that long!
---
For what, dragon knives and high alchs?
---
Yeah why not.
---
The purpose is to boost the boots, not to give merchers an opportunity to double their banks like with dragon hunter crossbow boost.
---
Why would being an Ironman stop you from botting stats tho?
---
2^32** for max int
---
Holy, only one pair of pants. Imagine if you didn't get those.
---
The fact that you compare them and want them equalized
---
First Purple in Twisted League
---
If they actually put some time into the system they could add a reset character option as well as a ~3 days grace period to allow you to restore a lost character in case of something like this (blizzard has a similar system for wow). I doubt there would be many people hacking TL profiles to reset people‚Äôs characters anyway though, unless you upset someone and they‚Äôre targeting you individually most hackers will never care about TL profiles and will just go after mains. There is no benefit to resetting someone‚Äôs TL Ironman unless you have personal intentions.
---
I was running elite void, fury, brimstone ring, dragon boots, fire cape.
---
Mage was mage helm, trident, book of darkness.
---
Range was range helm, blowpipe and ava‚Äôs assembler.
---
Melee was melee helm, whip and dragon defender.
---
I have ornate rejuvenation pool.
---
Did you not fletch in solos? Seems like 93 fletching is low
---
more casual friendly give me base essential items ie, knife, chisel,net and those sorry of items it's small but stops a casual having to spend half they days game to obtaining just one of them
---
it SHOULD be much easier to exploit PvM because it only requires one party. Only a system as broken as bhV2 could make it worth two bots' time to cheat in a minigame instead of farm MLM/Blood runes/Zulrah etc.
---
I dont get it
---
Theres always hope bro , 9 jars deep I got my pet at 6881
---
76 combat, 86 range, 76 mage, 70 slayer.... Only done wildy slayer up till now. What's the most profitable avenue in terms of slayer bosses?
---
I was watching some youtuber mention needing to buy a house to get the con xp. I hadn't paid any mind to it until that point. Totally forgot about the construction xp.
---
Path of Exile, it‚Äôs a diablo like hack and slash/dungeon crawler game.
---
Back in 2010ish there was actually a decent practice-bridding community at the duel arena. One of the most enjoyable times I‚Äôve had on RS was practicing switches and freezes there during that time
---
No pet :(
---
Got mine about a year ago for the first time. It feels amazing enjoy the moment
---
All those examples make sense for a home internet disconnect, but this is a server lag, at Jagex‚Äô end
---
3 mutes in 2 years how is that non a basis for a perm.
---
I started fletching at 100M XP :)

Ive done it on mobile with 85 combat, with 76 ranged.

You'll be fine.

---
New gold sink confirmed
---
It would be cool if you could sell your supplies to a big shop only accessible by your faction, so we could retain the Ironman element, and those who wished to not engage in combat could get gold from selling to the shop and the rest could spend gold restocking supplies
---
Ty
---
Could imagine getting healers off of jad could become kinda aids.
---
Then again, ppl have done inferno on mobile so its possible. Its all about practice
---
AYAYA
---
Gotcha, makes sense. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Feel like it's not just Runescape, people in their 20s these days are almost all depressed or something (myself included).
---
TIL
---
Optional "Disable" dueling feature, which can be re-enabled at the cost of a delay to how long before you can duel again and/or amount of duels available to you per day. Eg. Diasable it once, and re-enable, you must wait 1 day before being able to duel. Next time you do this, 3 days, then 1 week, 3 weeks, 2 months etc.
---
It requires one party. But the NPC is predictable and will ALWAYS DO AS TOLD. It won't suddenly stop attacking to let you get free kills or something that a human can/would do.
---
When you have humans on both sides that just take the path of least resistance instead of playing the content how it was intended, thats when you get shit like BH2 and 76king.
---
NPC's always act the same way, humans will try and problem solve to their benefit.

Happy cake day!

Bro that's fucking awesome! I suppose nowadays it's not as exciting as it used to be, but that's still a big achievement to me. Nice work

The problem is that when I did it in RS2, I struggled with it. Keep in mind the meta back then was magic short bow etc...
---
I was wondering at the start about lack of xp drops then realized why people wanted to get house asap
---
Its all that money youre making at zammy huh üòÇ
---
That's a valid idea, however, I'd probably try it on mobile before I try it at the library.
---
This is the guy that was in charge of the workshops if you remember them
---
I didn't need this kind of personal attack today
---
id rather that they put up the little things on the ground during the fight, rather than have it eat 30s of overall fight time to run around and dodge lmao
---
Accumulator gang would have commented, but they ran out of energy before getting here.
---
Ah fuck haha
---
What do you mean they nerfed it?
---
Head of research. So not someone you hear often, unlike the content mods.
---
KempQ has bunch of vids of his 10hp ironman pking with a dragon warhammer, a granite maul, and other goodies.
---
Gotcha lol, I thought you had some personal vendetta against ice burst or something lol
---
Nah he‚Äôs scaled the same as on PC. I use iPhone 7+ (which is practically a relic in 2019), and have never had an issue with the size of NPCs. Maybe on super small screens like old iPhone 4s and 5s but I doubt people are playing OSRS on those anyway.
---
And even if so, you only really need to see Jad (plus the healers though they should be close by) so the size of him shouldn‚Äôt be too much of a hindrance.
---
Links my dudeeee
---
Also faster xp and more chill with more inventory space
---
forgetting about the mith/addy/rune/dragon servers. Those will make wilderness PVM so much easier for those who grind twisted league.
---
Off-topic a bit, but while I *love* the Q&amp;As and the fact that the devs take the time to engage with the community, it's annoying that the meta seems to have become
---
1. Ask Question
---
2. Question answered with a "Yes we can do/poll that, great idea!"
---
3. Topic fades into oblivion forever
---
Seems the backlog is *huge* and I can't tell if the devs are taking notes and actually have a list of suggested updates or if the "backlog" is just a nebulous cloud of whoever happens to remember that one question brought up in last year's Q&amp;A and decide to poll it. 
---
If there was a publicly available backlog or even "considered future polls" it would stop these threads from becoming 50% already answered questions which have never been followed up on.
---
Eh, it's not the best passed a certain point. I think the best thing about it would be the seeds, but now he has so much stuff to store it locks out anything risky. You don't need 99 construction super early, though I would love it. If I think I could handle solos I would of done this too.

When I pulled wildy level for ardy cape diary yesterday I had a full on panic sweat going cuz of this mentality lol
---
Mad bants fam, the love is real g
---
Ahh. So that will definitely be your biggest hurdle. The medium through which you play won‚Äôt really be an issue, but just getting back into the fight caves groove. 
---
I always found rcb was really nice for learning (or relearning in this case) the caves. It will definitely take you longer than blowpipe, but it‚Äôs super chill to learn the safe spots because of the extra range on rapid.
---
"MOM THEY ARE PLAYING THE GAME A DIFFERENT WAY FROM ME AND I DON'T LIKE IT."

---
What you guys thinking for twisted league tier 3? I'm thinking gatherer cause todt already makes firemaking and fetching so quick and easy.

70 defence is cool too. I just tagged the healers and then tanked them for the rest of the Jad fight.
---

Contracts dont give exp in the first place, just the exp you get from harvesting.
---

No lol I'm doing bloods I have 10 times XP drops and hardcore harvester. I'm getting 50k XP drops every 7 mins... Way faster!!
---
How much gold is in that stack, 3m ?
---
I like slayermusiq guides specifically because I don‚Äôt have to stop what I‚Äôm doing to look over and read the next step on the wiki, with slayermusiq, there‚Äôs no downtime cause he‚Äôs usually a few seconds ahead of me and is telling me what the next step is. Unless you‚Äôre really slow and he gets way ahead of you, there‚Äôs no reason to be pausing the video very often, if ever
---
If they got more new players to join the game, they could prevent more inflation than gp removal ever would.
---
It‚Äôs the only way I could find the clip of him actually dcing, I never saw someone clip it cuz the chat went crazy. 
---
In no way am I asking or forcing you to sub. I explained what happens in the clip on the post.
---
Tl:dr 10b stake, both lag and dc, Oda logs in with his original 10B and his opponent logged in with nothing.
---
Omg!!
---
What is that hat?
---
most bots are gold sellers, ironman wont stop players from botting
---
Whoever told you to run through Jad is an asshole and you‚Äôre lucky you either didn‚Äôt follow his advice or get yourself killed lol
---
Thats why you bring ancient mace
---
Depends on the quest. No one will ever be as fast as watching Slayermusiq's guide on MEP2.
---
Different stroke for different folks man! 
---
That's how I feel about The Chariot, the more I listen to them - the less I like them. Nothing wrong with not enjoying a band!
---
Just so everyone knows this is not me in the clip it's LoveLili on twitch. Go give him a follow, he going to be doing a lot more twisted leagues content in the future. He went into this Olm with ZERO food and still beat it without dying, he's a true gamer!

It's good and fun. Konar's blessing is also really good and pairs well with Unnatural Selection. Dinh is solid if you wanna do a month of Wintertodt lol
---
Thats not the case, you just clearly dont understand sarcasm or keep up with this reddit meta.
---
Except there's no rule or law in osrs. The "judge" is other players who are motivated by greed to pk others. I.e. assholes.
---
A more accurate analogy is you go to a party, get drunk, and hey sexually assaulted. Yeah, getting yourself  drunk made you vulnerable to abuse, but that doesn't mean the assaulter isn't a piece of shit, or that it's your fault for being assaulted.
---
If you look at my post history I‚Äôm obviously very pro pvp moron.
---
Pointing out the fact that when idiots say the pking community is toxic, they never take into account the pure stupidity and assholishness of the Ironman community. So pvpers get spite votedfor it but the Ironman community doesn‚Äôt.
---
But seriously please continue to be a fucking idiot.

As somone who worked in a hardware store, *plenty* of people do this.
---
If someone thinks TL is boring I can only imagine what they think of the main game
---
Old exploit that was brought back in the recent game update 1-2 weeks ago allowing both players to get refunded their stake if server got ddosed mid staking.
---
W302 is getting rebooted now. That should fix the exploit allowing the &gt;!mod!&lt; player to make tens of thousands a day abusing this.
---
I‚Äôm top 15% and have most definitely been playing too much. Anyone above me has exceeded that line by now. Obviously a subjective measure (how much is too much) but I‚Äôve played a lot lol
---
If you dont want to get attacked, dont go to the one area where you can be attacked
---
Oh I would have suggested that. Sometimes Mod Ash helps.
---
I got a new one earlier this year in June and ride it + play OSRS are pretty much the two things I do
---
I just got home, logged into 302, and the world has DCED twice in the last 5 minutes, someone is fucking with this world hard.
---
\&gt; $100k
---
I'll try it when I get home from work :) thank you so much!
---
You're right, the Crystal Axe should be 71 too.
---
My hcim is so different from my main I don't know why I wouldn't just give it a whole new name.
---
So is there another reason no one will fight him?
---
And delete RS3 just to be safe
---
Right yea, totally. All these frontpage posts are "man these rewards from playing TL will make it all worth it" rather than "damn TL is actually really fun".
---
How many kills was it?
---
Yeah but who's going to set that above like $200k lol
---
Clues will give you quick access to full rune, black d-hide, and msb.  Getting that super early saves so much time that the Konar relic seems irrelevant.
---
Gzzz mate! I saw you this morning with 500k to go, glad you did it.
---
But what drove you to be zigzagman 9 üòÇ
---
No rules? Reported.
---
An even more accurate analogy for what happened would be going to the wilderness, a place made for people to fight other people. And getting mad because someone fought you and you lost. Or walking into the janitors closet with only 13 bullys and your wearing glasses.
---
[Barrows w/ Ibans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVQz3AT1Snk)
---
I think the relic specifies clues are more common from skilling sources, but doesn't exactly say by how much
---
Stop gatekeeping, hypocrite
---
For me I don‚Äôt think yew to magic was a big jump. I get many times where I come away with 0 to 3 nests, and sometimes I get 12 to 16 nests. I don‚Äôt know what my average is but I assume you get one extra best than yew; however I personally don‚Äôt see much of a difference. 
---
I also do it for experience and passive herblore experience from the nests. 
---
I would really wait till redwoods if experience isn‚Äôt a thing and you want your margins to stay low. Yew logs are like 1/8th the price of Magic‚Äôs so one bird nest per house on average on paper isn‚Äôt enough for me personally to use them.
---
I won my stake and still lost the money since i  froze, and everyone else who won or lost their stakes lost their money ???? wtf
---
Like 1800 with OPs wintertodt kc i think.
---
I chose prayer because I'm going to combine it with the 5k relic of prayer restore, I want to theory craft to see what is going to be possible with that combo, everyone should just choose what they fine the most fun
---
What did he mean by that
---
they probably love it in a braindead way
---
Well if you don‚Äôt use the chat how else are people gonna know since there‚Äôs no icon in the right-click menu
---
Ok but the purpose of the Wildy is to PK others, that‚Äôs the whole point of it. I don‚Äôt think the whole point of a party is for people to be sexually assaulted. You‚Äôre not an asshole if you do something that‚Äôs intended.
---
I think a more accurate analogy is if a better soccer team plays one that‚Äôs worse. The worse team obviously loses and learns from the loss, just like an Ironman learns to be more careful in the wildy :) .
---
If it's an assignment from konar, yes
---
Just hit world 303 :p the backup
---
For sure influenced it lol, if only they didn‚Äôt board the hype train maybe the desert would be getting some much needed love

In what universe do you live in?

To try? U legit just sitting there while I take them off you and I have a runner to supply the the tank. And if running off with tassies is your concern. Your bank is small
---
look at the other axes?
---
...
---
If it's possible this is definitely the best solution. Just make raids the only multi.. it's the only place it makes sense for this league.
---
ive heard they can get about half his hp down in an hr, and its still the best f2p money maker even with splits
---
Who does this guy think he's trying to fool?
---
Maybe like 100-150 because the skill level isn't great and mostly because of the gold.

Lmao try to move the square on the right of your mouse to the left
---
Oh no don't hit me with that.  I've already died multiple times pickpocketing master farmers lol.
---
Move the right hand side down one, bump the middle piece up along the moved section
---
Truth. 100% truth.
---
DMM had literally no incentive to play besides pvp though. League implements a point system that isn't pvp, so you could conceivably play wildy league without actually needing to pvp to win.
---
When you're banned you are sent to plow X% depending on how serious the offense.
---
Kinda off topic here, been on a hiatus from OSRS for a few months. Just saw this new mode, is there any pking/PvP involved in twisted league? Or is it just a PvM race?
---
What number are we at now?
---
What boots/gloves are those?
---
Lool u didn't pick endurance... Shame on you.
---
Servers are separate, but within the same hosting facility.
---
Idk. Is this more or less players then the original deadman mode release?
---
my bad haha a little bit of alcohol
---
My professor into thinking that RuneScapes economy can have direct relations to the real world economy, I‚Äôm citing gold farmers as a primary example of using rsgp as a way of providing real world income in lower income countries but I wanted to include a section that talks about an account itself and the real world value of an account
---
Usually in rs subs, if people go out of the way to hide their name, they dont want it attached to their reddit acc. A question like this would have probably worker better in private.
---
I thought there was a 100 limit
---
Ur right
---
I specifically held out on WT until I got the artisan on to take advantage of the fm xp. Combat is already pretty easy, fun and passive so I would argue against doing the combat one. I think artisan is the best even with 99 fm tbh
---
Well, that's one way to create a gold sink :s
---
&gt; also, dont be that dick who tries to make fun of people for not having endurance
---
Why not? I know for a fact I can outrun you
---
His post is so funny and I'm asking the same question you asked lol
---
You gotta flip the last two in the fourth row and bring the last one in the last row to the left
---
Respect
---
i did that kinda by getting the required item list and then only using questhelp for subtle hints, sucks that they removed questhelp
---
I put details in because I know people who buy and sell accounts are likely to browse the forum here, I‚Äôm not about to drop my account details on a buying and selling website to get phished for an account I‚Äôve put a couple hundred hours into

If this gets popular, I expect them to get slapped with a mandatory name change.
---
Ava‚Äôs Accumulator I‚Äôm guessing
---
From what I've seen, there's basically 2 groups
---
Unnatural Selection + Artisan for a more relaxed playstyle with no downsides, also better for PvM since you can hunt Slayer uniques, and abuse Farming Contracts + Artisan bonus for fast XP in Herblore and other buyables.
---
Hardcore Harvester + Gatherer for a more sweaty, efficient playstyle. Gatherer being better since it saves more time overall and Harvester technically boosts artisan XP/hr too so Gatherer makes sure your gathering skills don't fall behind.
---
My bank is 1b far from. small but u are just another ranger begging to be carried.

What darts you use?

An yeah id be mad about a tassy that's few lvls on a skill.

Both are more points. Fletching while running saves time though.

You can see league point hiscores on the official hiscore page, there's a tab for it. I haven't paid attention to those numbers specifically, but I can say that I'm in the top 1% (as of last night at least) and only have 4 relics, so that one at least checks out.
---
It might! But really extra 3 is for the round number achievement I'll post loot later today
---
w364 too
---
No, the people in their 20s who you hang around with and interact with are all depressed.  Misery loves company, and what you're seeing is just your own confirmation bias.  Plenty of young people are quite happy with life.
---
Ascent of Arceuus, Raids with a Farming room, Aerial fishing
---
Err. Not what I said.
---
It depends on where they pull the info for the hiscores.

Some of their ingame trackers are capped at that number, just like the max cash is max cash

Lizard Squad must need more Mega Upload accounts /s

There was a HCIM that also did that to start the account, think he died like a week after though

You can see how many points people have on the [hiscores](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool_seasonal/overall?category_type=1&amp;table=0#headerHiscores). As of right now the final hiscores page is [2686](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool_seasonal/overall?category_type=1&amp;table=0&amp;page=2686). The top 1% would therefore be around page [26](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool_seasonal/overall?category_type=1&amp;table=0&amp;page=26), and you can see that the people on this page do not have the 5000 points for the 5th relic.

Jagex confirmed Runelite won't get you in trouble with the game rules. No other third-party clients were mentioned

Having a bad day?

They are hardcore players but I wouldn‚Äôt say anyone is ‚Äútoo hardcore‚Äù if they enjoy the game, they are still good friends and helped me out when they could. It just feels nice to be able to help them and other people with advice now.

Hey bro join L0st Dynasty cc I‚Äôm one of the owners! Medium sized clan all high leveled at the moment but we are looking for everyone who wants to just be part of a fun group who wants to make each other better so one day we can have a stronger clan.

I thought that was the point of iron man

Definitely runelite

If you have amazon prime you can use twitch prime to get a free 14 day membership and try out the league, that‚Äôs what I did and I‚Äôm hooked again.

0 for 2 on insults btw.

Why don't they bring those worlds down, there are people staking and bossing right now. And I have never seen the in-game message.

Aerial is too click intensive. Just look at what you need to do. Jagex please fix it.

Is that new or was it always like that? Because my first piece was gloves and then bruma then legs and top and head and boots was last

Hopefully they come out with an updated deadman mode of sorts for the PKers, it‚Äôs not my scene but it was fun to watch content creators go hard at it.
---
because Jagex.
---
is the light puzzle really that complicated? i've never done it without a guide/don't know anything about how it works, just did what slayermusiq told me to

Runelite is the only client that Jagex has endorsed so nothing it offers will get you banned :)

I'm 96 too and have received 3 bruma torches, nothing else. I know your pain bro
---
A lot of people‚Äôs reasoning was that the reason clues are fun, are that they force you to take a break from what you‚Äôre doing to go complete them, so that you have a chance at another before you finish out the task. Letting tons stack up in your bank just turns it from a fun break to another chore
---
rip, he could have used that rng to get dwh
---
Unfortunately we have devs that consider skull tricking to be a legitimate game mechanic.
---
Graceful may be an eyesore, but Jesus christ the people in this thread unironically suggesting you should be able to obtain the full set effect for free or be replaced with a single item is *exactly* why the phrase "Reddit balance" exists. 
---
The most obvious solution is to make items like graceful and skilling outfits (and *only* these items) have a vanity slot associated with them. That way you can wear whatever you like while doing certain skilling activities, but we don't get abominable combinations like people bossing in scuba gear.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm 96 rn
---
Beginners to mediums would see insane increases to clues/hr. For mediums in particular, you'd skip the process of depositing your inventory, opening imp jars, then grabbing ~20 unique items out of your bank to do the clue quickly. You could just get a ton of clues at once and blitz through them with no banking.
---
If I had an ags with 2 specs in it
---
Ayoooo
---
It would be a nice thing for the game if pkers at least recognized that being toxic shitheads was bad for them as well as unfun for the 99% of the playerbase that isn't like them. I'm more than willing to argue with a few shit slinging monkeys if it contributes in even a minute way to onlookers or the people I'm arguing with realizing that jumping through mental hoops to try to justify being dicks to others by pking people who don't want to fight back in the wildy is an overall bad thing. Plus I don't mind typing out an argument over the internet. People calling me lame insults doesn't bother me and no amount of "lol git gud scrub" changes me having a maxed account or bank worth multiple bils, so it's in many ways like scolding a kid.

Preach your mentality brother.
---
I own a clan and it‚Äôs so annoying that some people keep changing names or having alts with zero similarities until a point that these guys have no identity whatsoever for me.
---
It also becomes kinda dangerous
---
Tarn Razorlor, maybe? Doubt she would have made it all the way there though.
---
It‚Äôs also just nice to be regenerating HP faster when you gotta spend a couple minutes AFK.
---
Wildy slayer is the fastest way to get points with the correct setup (even better than turael method)
---
Too bad ge-price and actual traded price aren‚Äôt the same. Welcome to the economy.
---
This ruins the meta for Slayer
---
Farm runs are the worst. Its like I'm farming with a bunch of cloned npcs especially since no1 ever talks anymore.
---
Tis true tis true
---
Maybe it‚Äôd be a bit better if it could be dyed for gp instead of marks of grace.
---
Have you not played the game before? You don't get drops every time you do an activity, lmao. People get skilling pets at level 1 and others go to 200m.
---
Upvote because name's Jared.
---
To me its more of a chore to regear. Leaving my training spot is fine but gearing up and setting up my inventory is annoying.

Bank presets and stackable clue really made me love clues on rs3

yep lol. they made them tradable so that people could use their alts on twisted league whilst still getting xp in main game. Ironmen have to play the league though, they can't use another acc. That was to stop people rwt'ing.
---
Heck I don‚Äôt even think without eoc and the custom interfaces could osrs ever feel like rs3. The games are so distinct in that regard. 
---
I remember one semi-controversial update in rs2 being lodestones. Removal of home teleport cooldown and you could choose any of the lodestones (generally cities) you wanted to go to. This improved travel around runescape a lot, but I know there were some players who didn‚Äôt like it because it made the game ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù. 
---
Osrs has kind of approached that in a healthy way with pohs. Shareable if you want to go to w330, high level content that not everybody has, and still incredibly useful for getting around. Of course, I‚Äôm talking about ornate jewelry boxes and portal nexus :)
---
What did you think when lodestones came out? Good? Bad? What other quality of life stuff would you want to see in osrs regardless of it being in rs3 or not?
---
someone with focus go to wc guild and get the ducks on you. test on the willow trees :P
---
What if the outfits could be reversibly transformed into a single ammo slot item, but it would only provide the effects if the helm, top, bottom, glove, and boot slots didn't have stats? So you could wear clue items or random cosmetics but not actual gear.
---
They could even change things up and introduce a clue reward that permanently removed stats on a piece of equipment so you could wear it for cosmetic appeal
---
thats the opposite of fair
---
It doesn't change your login email, it just changes where Jagex sends their correspondence about your account so you will still need to remember the random emails to be able to login
---

I think zeah is really the only option for TL, it has so much content that you cant get in any other location.
---
Would be cool to see a WoW style pvp league. You align with a specific faction (maybe a zeah "house"?). Your factions area is a safe zone for you, but if a player from another faction enters, you can fight them. Neutral zones would be like catacombs kebos and the main castle. Have certain relics give pvp perks.
---
Would be a cool way to get more players into pvp also
---
It's relatively complicated as you have to understand opposing colors past base colors on a multi floor level scope with a mirror pathing puzzle on top of it. The really annoying part of that quest is if you are trying to figure it out while being continually attacked. It's not so bad with a guide and can be done in about an hour. Imagine going into that puzzle without a guide, not knowing you will be constantly attacked, not knowing how the puzzle even functions in the first place, what order to get all the pieces from the chests, how to know when you have all you need to solve the complete puzzle causing constant backtracking. Combat in DND compared to Runescape is also much different since in runescape you can just keep running where as in DND you roll initiative and you are pretty much stuck in the fight to its completion before you can continue with healing being extremely limited and characters needing to rest/sleep/eat like a normal person.
---
A lot of content would sortof be gated by 99 agil. Not literally gated, but it‚Äôd become wildly inefficient to do most things without it.

Okay so I see a lot of people in this thread saying that running through Jad is bad advice, but it really isn't. Assume you have 70 hp when you try to run through Jad. This means Jad has a 28% chance to kill you in 1 hit if it hits. This is devided by 3 because it had 3 attack types (9%). This is further decreased because he doesn't have 100% accuracy. There's also a chance Jad can never melee you because running is the same as skipping a step, so if you skip the step next to Jad he can't even hit you with melee. 
---
In conclusion, running through Jad instantly solves the problem with healers for like a 1 in 25 chance you get oneshot by his melee attack, and if your hp is highers the chance decreases even further (0% if you have over 97 hp).
---
Who gained points
---
Everyone over uses it

Its really not that amazing most places

People just have it over hyped, I bet most of the people that complain about seeing it everywhere also pull it out when they don't need it and could also be doing some fashion scape.

---
Shuffle that you?
---
CoX has a points system. You get points for performing activities like doing damage, puzzles, etc.
---
At the end of the raid everyones points is pooled together and then for every ~8,000 points there is a 1% chance of rolling on the rare drop table instead of the normal loot table. 
---
The amount of points each player has as a percentage will then be their chance of receiving said rare drop. So if you have a player that absolutely carried with 75% of all points, there's a 75% chance that they will get the drop.

Sorry my comments don't make sense to you. Just trying to have a constructive conversation.

They'll have like addy+ worlds in the next league, based off your standing from twisted leagues.
---
800 hours isn't a lot, and we have no time frame included from what I see. Hard to say they don't have a life when it could have been done over 2 years at less than an hour of playtime a day.
---
Why? I don't get it you have the respectable capes for everything. The reason why people show off max cape is because its way harder to obtain a max cape then a music cape or champions cape.

trident is only like 50k though, just depends on your magic lv, trident at 75 is pretty shit
---
Should have used the twisted league photo to make it seem legit
---
My point is it's never going to be easier to exploit PvM over PvP.
---
NPC's are only capable of one strategy and the developers account for that.
---
Players on the other hand will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves and it will play out in ways that aren't foreseen (even though some of these BH2 issues were obvious as fuck from a mile away).
---
Here is a serious question..
---
Why do you guys only ask for questions on social media platforms and not on your official website forums? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
With the meta of support only being available on 3rd party websites it's disgusting you guys are only asking for players opinions and questions on reddit and twitter.
---
I‚Äôve recently got back into osrs and am really intrigued about this system? Can someone post a link or explain how it is more efficient and how I go about setting it up?
---
You can play twisted league with existing accounts, it's just a different world that has a separate profile. After twisted league ends your twisted league profile will be wiped but your progress on the main game is untouched. The cosmetics you get as rewards are tradeable so you can sell them for gp in the main game.
---
If you really want the cosmetics you can just buy them off other players later so it isn't necessary to participate at all. All twisted league progress is wiped after the 2 months are up so it's a waste of time unless you enjoy it (you could make money from selling the cosmetics but I expect you can make much more money in a comparable amount of time on the main game and gain xp at the same time that won't be erased).
---
Jesus those tomes
---
Nah. I could take all the xp relics, crank out all the feasible 99s, then swap over to the combat relics and do pvm. Let's you do everything instead of having to choose what you want to specialize in.
---
I just tried twice today and still cant get it, my hands nd body start to shake and i cant even focus on trying to hit the healers WHILE trying to prayer switch and healing from tanking the healers
---
People slobbering all over this little jerk is still disgusting, skilled at fire Cape or not. How easily some forget the freakout on twitter he launch at someone else when losing a gilden gnome because in his mind he already won and deserved it. Then spamming a copy pasted 'sorry' on every single person who called him out. He is not someone who can handle the exceptionally tiny amount of fame he has without it going to his head.
---
He‚Äôs 100 in the hole though, I‚Äôm not talking about just this stake. Also AFAIK the majority of his current debt was incurred offstream, making it... I dunno, slightly more fishy. I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that likely, more that I just wouldn‚Äôt be floored if it turned out he was RWTing.
---
I don‚Äôt even play runescape, but you have to understand that the meta has changed from when we were 7 years old. It‚Äôs built around efficient training methods now with a delicate meta. This one thing would have huge effects on the game.
---
It's why I did it for my Ironman, though I did the slightly more meta BTW tag.
---
I say as if I ever actually clan chat/play my non ironman ;_;
---
I'm not an IM. Puzzle boxes are SOOO easy and are fun trying to solve them in seconds.
---
I mean my 6 year old daughter can do the puzzles lol...
---
Yeah that makes me sad. Morytania is one of my least favorite areas in the game. Desert has so much potential.
---
Jeeeez. I only used one password and created the account out of nostalgia last year. I even provided the transaction ID for my recurring monthly payments and nothing...
---
Runescape is (mostly) a game of progression. Before lodestones how quickly you could get around the world was one of the many branches of progression and knowledge. Lodestones gutted that. OSRS is already halfway there with PoH teleports.
---
As someone who picked up dark altar and subsequently stopped playing TL because I realised I fucked up, why dark altar?
---
I do think the league should be open for longer, at least 3 months, but considering the rewards are tradable they should be worth quite a lot at the end of this. It's not like you're doing all this work for nothing if your account gets a prestigious cosmetic/gold payout at the end.
---
Not a bad idea tbh. It's a tradeoff for overloading inv space for longer runs. I dont see anything game breaking since endless endurance is a thing.

Dude seeing this makes me so happy. This is what I talked about pretty early on in a livestream when the concept was in the making. I really hope we can achieve this to some degree in future Leagues as well, because to me it‚Äôs one of the core parts of the design.
---
Happy you fell in love with the game again, see you on Zeah!
---
I don't think 99 agil needs permanent run, sorry if it sounded like I was really into it
---
You max run regen boost at what, like 96 or something or I read somewhere? At most, and I don't think this is needed either, a manual boost adjustment or something at 99 would be reasonable. I retract all of this if I'm wrong about the regen calculation

Never probably lol, I regret taking some relics but it's a super fun mode move on
---
Other than rushing raids, there are almost 0 mobs that are going to present an accuracy issue to msb or rune crossbow by itself. You lose more time gathering food than just praying on catacombs tasks. I have black dhide and haven't used it currently at 77 slayer.  With konars blessing, accuracy is a non issue on nearly every task unless you're grinding drakes or brutal drags.
---
Timmm tim tim tim...
---
More so that there is no point. Even if tradables from the league hit 500m, it won't put food on the table this month.
---
Because they‚Äôre not improvements. They‚Äôre just shitty additions you turbo casuals want that wil destroy the game. And you don‚Äôt care because you‚Äôll just go to the next game and demand it be dumbed down for you too
---
I love you rendi
---
Could be cool if you could talk to an NPC to reset your perks once per league. But I guess that would allow people to min-max too hard.
---
He commented, it is not rendi
---
I‚Äôll bet you anything someone DDosed the world, it‚Äôs been happening so much lately.
---
no. Already polled and failed.
---
Once you get all the teleports and some harralanders you wont need worry about run until raids. And once you slay past 55 you wont need to worry about ammo costs. Itll be ok
---
Jokes on you I already got it!
---
You‚Äôre still jads Father don‚Äôt worry
---
if u can, buy a dhcb, if not, do bgs blowpipe, if u got a good bit of cash, your upgrade order should be dhcb -&gt; rigour -&gt; pegs/df ward (ward first if low  magic/def levels) -&gt; pegs/df ward base on previpus
---
You wrong boi
---
What did you use as food? Cake from the bakery stall?
---
Seems Rendi V Zuk was a bit too "Blessed by the Chest"
---
Not without a game-breaking exploit, no.
---
Nah. Thank you. I can't believe how smooth this release went. Such an incredible game mode that brought me back to the game after a 3 year break.
---
It will be even better when you guys release the surprise "wildcard relic" as the 6th relic this Thursday!
---
I have yet to do it. Congratulations.
---
I absolutely loved twisted leagues.  No one knew the optimal path.  We were a community learning together again.  I want to feel this in places that hold nostalgia for future leagues.  
---
Please do a variant that is P2P as it is now but limited to all F2P areas including the wildy.  End game in wildy bosses as an option and KBD with some iconic quests like DS1.  It will feel so much like 2001 to 2004 runescape where F2P was populated with everyone feeling slightly newbish finding their bearings and no set optimal path to be had.  Experiencing that in lumbridge all over again.  I would sub forever.
---
No I will arrest you
---
I love you more
---
Of two dudes with 1b risk each and no defesive or offensive capabilities, I'd still pown the hcim.

That would be terrible idea for hour limiting. Since jagex is based in UK I would assume you want it there and for the many that are from us or other time zones it would limit us to playing in the middle of the night. Also would mean we couldn't sell anything till then either. And you thought it was a good idea?
---
Its 28, so possible, but Ill probably finish the task at 4 am slowly sooner.
---
In a while crocodile
---
I will have you know I wore a lot of rad shit before (30% stamina regen) was the only sensible option.
---
Yes, I agree. HOWEVER.. Rendi will do it. It may be 1 month, 3 months, even a year from now. But he will do it. Mark my Zuckerberg.
---
I don't understand this turbovirgin perspective that I always see in this sub.  You guys always try to conflate quality of life with difficulty, as if having to walk somewhere makes the game harder or more skill based.  It's literally just wasting your time for no additional complexity or depth.
---
Just started playing again last week, did some bandos for a bit with a buddy. Its gotten progressively worse...finished ds2 last night, killed 30 vorkath...got kandarin hard diary done and a Salve Ammy ei. Im in the damn hole again whether i like to admit it or not.
---
The upgraded version is not a stat increase but if it‚Äôs just for 1 kill it should be fine
---
Yea imo end game content, GWD mainly, is fun to watch HCIM do. But yea if they die it takes a long time to get back to that point. I just wish if they died it was from actual mistakes and not a cheap DC. Idk it kind of ruins it for me even as a viewer
---
Not possible, guy is lying. A long time ago in rs3 a game breaking bug was abused to award a level 3 the fire cape.
---
Currently the lowest in the entire game was 17, now it's 16 from the looks of it. Your coworker is a casual.
---
Later virgins?
---
So, who is this little fucker?
---
&gt; I was incredibly skeptical about Leagues when I first read about them. I did not plan to play. On release day, I jumped on as a whim. I am so glad I did. I haven't played the main game since.
---
100% relateable
---
Inb4 it's Woox
---
Get to leaching mate with them addy darts
---
Woox*
---
Congrats. I remember you saying you‚Äôd gain like 9 mil xp in 2 days and you actually did it. 
---
How do you plan on using all of the supplies you‚Äôve earned?
---
Got nuked with them downvotes to I see guess everyone else felt the same
---
He plays OSRS.
---
Graceful does more than just the negative weight. If you wear the full set, you regen run energy faster.
---
Those weeds will never see you coming
---
Might as well poll double xp then right
---
Kitboga is a famous streamer, and aside from his scambait streams he also streams games like OSRS, Minecraft, and GTA.
---
What am I meant to be interested by, like genuinely I don‚Äôt know.
---
10m seems relatively fair for that. It's not a terrible idea but idk. I think hardcore should equal one life.
---
Although to be honest my main now started as a hcim and when I died (my fault not a DC) I just continued on as Iron. I woulda been pretty sad if my account was just permanently deleted, but I guess that's also what makes it fun. The rush.
---
Get 99 Construction

Doing queen of thieves i take it?

Because you don‚Äôt what qol is. You just ask for the game to made easier and then try it off as qol. You literally don‚Äôt walk anywhere in the main game now unless you‚Äôre straight up retarded. All adding infinite run does is literally make the game easier and dumber. For the sole reason that you‚Äôre too fucking stupid to plan ahead and bring Stan pots
---
Others have said it pretty much, but it is likely that they are not going to do this, unless there is a ridiculous drop in player count or something. Whether the relics in this league are balanced well or not is now only relevant with respect to future leagues, where both the playerbase and Jagex should do their best to suggest a good system of benefits offered by relics. I think that the difficult decisions that come with choosing relics should remain an integral part of Leagues, and that includes not being able to reset when you regret your decision. With that said:
---
1. There have been minor examples of miscommunication/inadequate info (e.g. regarding not being able to choose the same farming contract b2b) which could teach Jagex a lesson about being as clear as possible about everything a relic entails.
---
2. It is clear that some relics *seem to* have more disadvantages than others, e.g. choosing Unnatural Selection only has the "disadvantage" that you don't get any of the other two, whereas Hardcore Harvester has an inherent disadvantage that decreases xp rates (if not tick manipulating). I'm not saying they are unbalanced, just that balancing such different perks is not an easy task. 
---
3. While I don't think there is much of a chance of Jagex allowing a reset this season, this is again a thing that they can think about before the next league, or even poll it. I would not be completely against some kind of reset myself, if it is reasonably restricted.
---
I see where you are coming from, and I'd love to see some great and well-balanced relics in future leagues. One thing for Jagex to consider (if their time and resources permit) is maybe to introduce more relics in the future (either more tiers, or more choices per tier), which could be used to customise your experience to suit your playstyle even better. Also, it occurred to a lot of people that certain relics fit together rather well, so I would like to see Jagex also capitalize on that idea in future leagues (e.g. in this league if you choose 3x resources, you can choose the Gatherer perk afterwards to make up for the worse xp rates; in a future league, especially if it has a larger selection of relics, they could make it that certain facets of the game are "tackled" by different relics from different tiers, e.g.  one tier offering unlimited run energy, while another reducing the rune cost of teleport spells).
---
&gt; NPCs that drop clue scrolls now have a flat 1/10 chance of dropping them.
---
Stone chest is not an NPC. This part doesn't affect them.
---
&gt; Clue geodes, nests and bottles are now found ten times more often from all skilling activities from which they can be found.
---
Stone chest doesn't give clue geodes, nests, or bottles.
---
&gt; All un-started clues are stackable.
---
This works on medium clues from the stone chest.
---
&gt; All clues have the lowest number of steps possible for their tier.
---
This also works on the medium clues from the stone chest.
---
TL;DR Treasure seeker does not affect the rate you get medium clues from stone chests.
---
have to do majority dmg or last hit it to get a slayer kc.
---
What suggestion is that exactly? I've been actively reading and never heard of a falador proom suggestion?
---
can comfirm was in call with him. gz but fuck you
---
Not even close to being similar but ok
---
Hmmmm, consume ketamine I must. Run children over with my 2005 Honda Civic, I shall.
---
Almost like zeah is entirely disconnected from the mainland and due to that has entirely different architecture.
---
How dare they do that, no where else in Runescape is ever like that! (Skims over lunar isle, fremenik areas, penguin iceberg colony and others im probably forgetting)
---
Reach was gone from the team long before zeah existed.
---
red spider eggs are no longer a reward from nmz
---
I noted that graceful set actually affects whenever you are doing activities. Like while you harvest crops or pass obstacles you regenerate energy slightly, but it adds up in the long run.
---
I‚Äôve been doing motherload mine at work on mobile a lot lately and it‚Äôs pretty good, I can get like 100-150k xp throughout the day typically which is really slow xp/hr wise but it definitely adds up.
---
It was polled. It failed. For good reasons.
---
You can't seriously say that any of the absurd relic buffs belongs in the main game. That's the whole point of leagues.
---
it is a good idea
---
What happens to the skills / account once it ends?
---
Maybe at 99 agility would be more appropriate
---
a permanent twisted league world would also be pretty cool honestly
---
A no pillar run also has more uses and makes you better at speed runs which is why Rech and several other WR PvMers went for it. I also watched his no supply run and saw that he used his SGS lol. He dismantled it on wave 63 at the fucking end. The only impressive feats that I couldn't do are no prayer Jads and Zuk. That's fucking wild.
---
&gt; Take *Ashes of Ash*
---
&gt; Agility shortcut? Run regen.
---
classifies as a stall and thus does not regen run energy  
---
there's probably other situations but idk from the top of my head
