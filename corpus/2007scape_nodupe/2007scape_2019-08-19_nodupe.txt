Barrage lol!

You have a funny feeling like you’re being followed.*
---
I dunno if you noticed but prossy is used instead of mage armor at nechs and dust devils
---
Yeah lets not group all plugins together, you need to distinguish between injections into the client and side tab information. 
---

---
&gt; The official client is severely lacking
---
The official client isnt lacking at all. Maybe give it an XP tracker, a notepad and make it so you cant exit it without confirmation upon clicking X. A GE lookup is fine as well.
---

You mean verzik was dead and the crabs killed them after, the deaths dont even count
---
Ahh that's what it is I've never got a pet so I wasn't 100% sure. Thank man
---
lmfao, its a fact that most people like 3rd party clients, and its also a fact that most wow users use add ons, but way to resort to ad hominem attacks
---
No, super common drop
---
No problem. Main points of that video I thought you'd like is how the quest system is set up. Real storylines with major events that make the player feel like they're a part of a story. Go kill 12 board ala WoW is terrible in comparison to "go commit regicide against a mad king, plot twist you've been tricked by an insurgent group into killing an innocent king "
---
Second and overall hands down the most important game design philosophy in osrs  
---
progression = time spent osrs
---
Throughout your entire account history, you will be doing things for progression. You see a goal in front of you but then you realize it's under 20 other things you have to get done. Doing those things one by one may take a week, but st the end when you finally complete what you originally set out to accomplish, well damn if that's not a great feeling. 
---
You can see the progression being a core part of the game in the culture of the game as well. Consistent bullying of people who lack fire capes and barrows gloves is a good example. It shows that there is in part a sub-conscious drive from the player base to improve their character and to continue to compete with each other to be/get to be the "the best"
---
I would put a little more cash than that in at once.  You will lose some efficiency if you don't get your favor up every day to 100%, but there's no downside to leaving the coffee to build up.
---
You don’t think tile id’s are cheating? Wow
---
Sinbad does not approve...
---
Why do you need screen markers just for hp and all????
---
Can you explain further, what does one do to go into a field like this?
---
That's covered in the video and part of the solution they went with.
---
quite the hugbox this is
---
it's odd to leave easy quests for last, as they're usually requirements for diaries/clues, other than a few odd ones like scorpion catcher
---
F in the chat for this man's future account names I guess.
---
&gt; Okay if they don’t include boss timers I’ll just use a stop watch?
---
Sounds like a great idea. Or count in your head. Much more difficult than being spoonfed the information. Im glad we can agree.
---
But you won?
---
My girlfriend translated this for me lol. It’s Portuguese. She said that they said something along the lines of “we are all going to die.”
---
I assumed you were a reddit baby before I saw any of your comments. When I saw your comments you just proved that.
---
Nice bait tho kappa plox xD swag
---
as far as I can tell you can't do that, you have to do it on the site, so unless you're asking for a whole new poll system through the site (which won't happen) I'm not sure what you're talking about
---
I think op edited his comment, initially said goes effected
---
Why would I discard free gp?
---
Ah okay. I figured but I wasnt sure since u responded to me.
---
Literally huh?
---
[removed]
---
Quest cape is a teensy tiny step compared to diary cape. Quest cape is literally worth two elite tasks. But the required skill levels will get you close to completing all hard diaries, which is a nice logical step up from quest cape. That's not even halfway, though. Achievement cape is a long-term goal.
---
You get certifications or a degree in the field
---
My what?
---
Your best options with RuneLite:
---
1. Enable Low Detail plugin. 
---
2. Enable GPU plugin if your MacBook supports it. 
---
3. Set the game to Fixed mode (small window) and then go into your RuneLite plugins, enable "Stretched Mode" and set the settings to 100% and tick all 3 boxes. It should be nearly full screen if you have a 1080p resolution. Combining this with GPU mode fixes the pixelated look. 
---
The other comment about low ping only helps with connection stability. The world switcher plugin can sort worlds by lowest ping. For me the lowest is 17ms. If you're only getting 50, it's because you're wireless and/or your internet sucks where you are.
---
Mate. The official client can't even run on GPU nor can it resize interfaces on large screens. Other stuff like expanded draw distance is really helpful and a esthetically important so most of the screen on resizable mode isn't black. Shit like ToB plug-ins are bs but 3rd party clients are currently necessary for OSRS to survive, unless jagex incorporates them into their own client, which they've currently said is too large of a project for them.
---
Thanks for the advice! :)
---
Or instead of buffs that tie with herblore, the better fire you can light will help burn less food. This could become better than a range and make cooking a bit better at lower levels as well.
---
no obviously I’m talking about the fact that you do not have to move your in-game character anywhere you impossibly oblivious cretin
---
1 no vote = 3 yes votes, I have the power now pkers!
---
Mod Wolf confirmed it in the replies to this tweet!
---
Ah, that makes sense.
---
Nope, otherwise developing plugins at all would be against the rules. How do you think any plugin that marks an object or tile functions?
---
That's why when I'm out and using mobile I typically just do bankstanding skills.
---
I'm viewing some of your previous comments, and man, you really are hostile.
---
&gt;"the game is garbage if im not told exactly where to click, when to click, how to click, I am also a lazy entitled reddit baby"
---
To explain my main point from before: If you really ban every single 3rd party client, then you are going to ban 98% of the player base. Is that worse than the player base dropping in RS3? Yes, it is.
---
How old are you, if I may ask?
---
I laugh as I uninstall OSRS off of my work's computer..
---
god you're so incredibly stupid

---
Thank you for making this video possible!
---
Yes? Again who’s to say the client shouldn’t be updated to include overlays that previously didn’t exist. It’s not like we’re actually still playing OldSchool. The client is archaic and needs a few QoL updates or at least would have to find some middle ground to not be entirely rejected.

Warden was basically spyware. It’s creepy.

My trash email got one for an account I never logged into.

My RS only email hasn't so far.

I reluctantly clicked the link in the email cuz everything looked legit, and cuz I had never logged in the name wasn't available... Lol
---
Quests are literally my favorite part of the game
---
"bossing"
---
My logic is they're potentially at least level 80-100 at that point and probably have some reasonable goals to at least start being self efficient.
---
I would say it's a 50/50 chance you give the bond to the begger that he's a scammer or a bot.
---
That would be nice. Would need a propa 18+ sticker on it though.
---
same thing happened to me, never even got an email about my authenticator removal &amp; jagex never responded to me afterwards. gg.
---
No gay Vikings? Might aswell scrap the whole thing, we pay we say!
---
You can do it when there's someone else there too, just make sure you can survive 60-90 seconds of damage. You can switch on your prayer to make sure, e.g. if prime or supreme is attacking you

I'm very disappointed that the plural s from the previous two quests has been dropped.  It's this sort of inconsistency which is ruining the game.
---
Would it be possible to add a grave or maybe give the exile a doggo so the quest could be called the fremenik exiles?
---
I did it at 75 magic with mystic, trident of the seas, and an ardy cape, inventory full of brews and restores. It can definitely be done. But when I killed her I was on my last dose of brew and wouldn't have been able to survive another one of her massive hits, cut it extremely close. 
---
I found that it was really hard to know when to drink brews and when to do damage to her, and I'd recommend to you that you make sure you're not using dps time to heal up. Only drink brews when you gotta be moving around to damage a crystal or run away after she sucks you in close to her. If you take the time to drink brews until you're completely full after she does her massive hit, then you'll never have any time to damage her. You gotta get comfortable sitting at low hp except for when she's about to use that attack that does 98% of your max hp.

Shut the fuck up.

Hi, it’s me, you.

RuneLite is free software and is distributed under the BSD two-clause license. It's basically public domain short of requiring Adam's original copyright notice be included with copies of it and users of the software can't blame whoever wrote the code if it doesn't work right or fucks something up. 
---
Jagex can literally just fork the RuneLite  project, say their fork is the officially sanctioned client, and forbid anyone from using anything else. Then they can remove features from the modding API that they don't like. The BSD license is very weak, there's nothing stopping them from doing this from a legal/software licensing point of view. 
---
An example of this in the real world is the OS that Sony ships with the PlayStation 4. It's a modified version of FreeBSD which is licensed similarly to RuneLite. It's supposed to be free and open source software, but because the license is so permissive Sony can take it, make changes, and distribute it without sharing the changes. This is in contrast with something like Linux which is licensed under the GNU General Public License. The GPL in most of its iterations forces people who alter and distribute software licensed under it to distribute copies of their source code (e.g. their changes) with it. The merits of these are neither here nor there, but it's an important distinction - for our purposes nothing stops Jagex from just taking RuneLite for themselves.
---
Depends on the booty.
---
This is cursed.
---
That phone is worth what? 20 bucks lmao? Getting a proper one as to not risk a job isnt a hard decision.
---
I feel like runescape is a rare game where this really doesn't apply.
---
Trade in OSRS pre GE was having to use zybez for everything. It was like having the GE but everything took ages. V west had god awful prices because everyone was a wannabe mercher and the tradingpost was ded on arrival.
---
It was awful in hindsight but i kinda miss that self sufficient sorta gameplay that came with not wanting to spend your friday night autotyping.
---
Wow Mr. Hostile. 
---
Wait, explain to me. **HOW exactly did a single thing you just said equal "defense helps."** HOW did any of that actually disprove my point? 
---
So instead, knock out the entire 70 prayer, drop to 75 attack, and now you're talking about a #LEVEL 81 COMBAT ACCOUNT. I only added 70 prayer to bring up the combat level a bit more, but you're right. It's a much better fight to compare a level 81 account that can kill a level 100 account. 
---
Much more balanced? Better? Happier?
---
Yep, that should do what we want
---
Sounds like you have CPU or RAM issues. Watch your temperatures when RuneLite is open. Your RAM might have issues with the load RuneLite constantly uses. 
---
RuneLite is pretty easy to run (easier than official client) so it sounds like your PC is having an issue.

---
I live in Hawaii, they do not make six figures.
---
Why do you assume someone hasn't prepared? People telegrabbing runes, getting a clue step, or running from the boneyard to the chaos altar aren't risking enough to warrant killing in the first place if they're doing it properly. Are you really banking on idiocy as a moneymaker?
---
I've been playing on and off since 2004, and in that entire time I've never felt the PvP in this game was particularly skill intensive unless you are running those hybrid setups. There is still skill involved, but I get more enjoyment out of the game in other areas.
---
To me, The wildy isn't something that benefited the game except back in its hayday when no one had any clue what they were doing, so the wildy was engaging during that era simply because it was a unsanctioned PvP area. Nowadays that illusion is gone for the people who care about it staying around the most, and I don't want it gone, either. I want it to be fair to those it's trying to pull in there.
---
I dislike the idea that just because one in 500 wildy kills are on idiots that run around with their gp stack on their sleeve, or UIMs that have to keep their inventory on hand regardless of what they want to do, that it makes the game better for the other 499 that just want to get their slayer tasks over with or are doing revs on a throwaway account because it's more gp/hour for that account even when they are killed.
---
There are things that would need to be nerfed to compensate, like the Chaos altar, zammy wines, nature rune timers, and again, drop tables on some monsters, but I don't see a problem with doing those things in tandem with altering the wildy. Regular PvP is engaging enough for the right people that the Wildy itself just needs to encourage non-PvPers like me to engage with that aspect more, and for me personally, if I have to deal with a PKer, I want them to be in similar gear, and not be clan mobbed, especially if I manage to kill one of them.
---
Hell, I think Deadman Mode would actually benefit a ton from implementing something like this just to test the waters. A lot of the excitement that initially came from that is also what made the Wildy work back in the day. Clans killed it.
---
Yea forget about it, better to stay away from these

Are you okay

Just started a job doing IT for end-users at Comcast for business. It's actually pretty simple and straightforward, I used to work Geek Squad for a few years before I got recruited but they basically ask if you have certifications (Im only apple certified, its kinda crazy Comcast is paying for my dell/cisco certification exams as well) and what your technical experience is.
---
I must be braindead then. Good thing we have albert einsteins like you.
---
Err. That reinforces that there's *definitely* something wrong with your PC.  With specs like those, you shouldn't be having issues. GPU doesn't matter here, OSRS only utilizes CPU. Check your CPU temperature with HWMonitor and make sure it's not throttling. Also verify your CPU and RAM are performing as they should with a benchmark tool. 
---
Use resource manager and see if your PC is putting all it's resources somewhere. If you have a also hard drive, that's enough to slow everything else down. You can see this in resource manager with disc usage. 
---
My laptop with no GPU and an Intel 7500U (U means undervolt, so it's slower) can run OSRS simultaneously with other games with losing many frames. If my shit laptop can do it, your PC should be fine.

Can we have the option of prioritizing "walk here" or looting items, removing the attack options from players/NPC's, with something similar to the shift button drop? A button that would temporarily remove the attack option, without having to manually change it in the settings.

---
Ah, don't worry, ignorant little one, allow me to explain why your analogy is flawed.
---
The situation you brought up is completely different than what is discussed.
---
First of all, allow me to mention that I don't own anything made in China, at least not that I'm aware of. Second of all, items being produced from China in no way correlates to that product being produced by unethical treatment or lifestyle of workers. It's funny how you mention China, because I'm actually Chinese, so I probably have a better understanding on what goes on over there than some ignorant american/british person (whoever you are) that does nothing but buy into whatever he's heard on television. Because what you outlined as a comparison is nowhere similar to what we supposedly know about Venezuelans gold farmers. Third of all, you're using a logical fallacy: the classic "whataboutism". Attempting to point out flaws of others in order to defend yourself doesn't invalidate the original argument whatsoever. Even if I did buy items from companies that mistreat their employees, that doesn't excuse your disgusting moral viewpoints. Fourth of all, your analogy is not similar whatsoever. Buying an item that a company produces does not in any way shape or form mean you're supporting their treatments of employees. Meanwhile, hoping that Venezuelan families go hungry in order to preserve your pixels on a screen IS in direct endorsement that these people starve for your sake of entertainment.
---
Please educate yourself before writing your next response.
---
I agree and disagree all at once, not sure how to feel
---
On one hand, most content in the game is far far less fleshed out than slayer and PvM as a whole, a trend that, in my opinion, really needs addressing soon, so many skills are loss/near zero GP to 99 and never touch again, and those that are good GP still dont touch PvM.
---
Then theres slayer, a skill in a good spot, yet still pretty lacking when you consider most good tasks are unlocked in the 70’s with only a couple to look forward to from there, in very late RS2 and early RS3 the slayer enemies had you excited from mid all the way to late slayer

Most of the video was me explaining where Portals spawn, and how to guess where they will spawn in the next lap. This knowledge will help people get the peak optimized experience whilst running laps on the course, and helps them to avoid missing Portals.
---
Perhaps the Gold Smithing method could have been done in a separate video but I also wanted to cover multi skilling that could be done on the course because it's guide to optimizing the amount of experience you can get on the course.

I've played all 3 boats enough to have a feel for them and they all fail less than 5% of the time. Just click the boat again and keep playing. Not everything is going to go perfect every time and the games are easily carried even with multiple dead weights.

How do I set up my slayer block list and what to skip so that I only do insane gp/hr tasks and insane xp/hr tasks? Not interested in the mediocre xp and mediocre gp like bloodvelds. I have seen spreadsheets like this: [nieve](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11P646mI5tlUPLLAfiI7A1nbi7RwBt2-56IH0x8uZHyk/edit#gid=0) but these only optimize for xp and I know for a fact that a black demon task at demonics is mad cash
---
Lack of research my man, you’re out of luck. You know how many people have ruined pures? Jamflex ain’t gonna do shit for you
---
If you're just AFKing NMZ or something it's fine, but I wouldn't want to do much else.
---
Neat
---
I did it in mystic,  it ain't such a bad bonus :) she is very vulnerable to magic
---
Majority of people have done that quest. 
---
If you read what he actually says it clearly says that you will gain experience in all four but which set do you want more training in. 
---
If your a “pure” you would have been following a guide or know how to make them. Not completing monkey madness is very well known to that community. 
---
This is your fuck up, not theirs, they don’t have to do shit for you.
---
Fuck that pile of shit

its not a difficult quest bro

oh the special kid

worth a shot tho bro

Don't give up!

Sorry about your account :/

Save to 1k

100 keys will net you around 10m maybe less or a little more

theres not enough clarification tbh.
---
Thanks
---
I’m not going to lie. This is a pretty well known thing that almost everyone is aware of when making a pure. It’s definitely shitty this key piece of information got by you and ruined your pure. But there is about a 0% chance Jagex can help you. My advice at this point would be to turn your account into a zerker, rune pure, or voider.
---
Dayum
---
The mathematics of magic's effectiveness is really odd in osrs. You get a percentage increase to accuracy rather than a flat bonus like robes. This means it's better at a higher magic level, and potentially during certain encounters, etc.

Dude you have posted this on a throw away reddit account knowing full well you fucked up.. learn to read instead of just spamming space and clicking.

---
its happens bro

I don’t think this is true. But bet your ass jagex had inside knowledge of crystal weapon seeds going from 1k each to 100k each in a month. Bet your ass employees took advantage of buying them for 1k each.

So cats have 7 uses cause they have 7 lives right? Might be op, but I'm game

like I said it was more first time, but Im not really into any other account I appreciate the thought tho bro

Nahhh bro this is just qol bro this doesnt change anything bro you could learn the path yourself anyways bro its still old school bro

On a completely unrelated note plz no adventure paths cuz that is ezscape plz revert graphics cuz that isnt old school!

Was difficult to read though right!

Armadyl armour looks like shit regardless.

It is completely fine. You're bringing up an old post the way it should be. I do occasionally enjoy re-seeing forgotten posts, but it's the ones who blatantly steal and claim as their own. You, in no way, claimed it as your own. This was the "retweet" version of a Reddit post.
---
Who?
---
Didnt realise runelite was available on mobile
---
Inb4 u chose to limit yourself
---
But that's way more expensive than splashing.
---
I feel ya. It’s at least worth considering. With the amount of time you’ve put in, trashing the account would really blow and it is still very salvageable as a PKing account.
---
it just didnt clarify enough thats all im saying?
---
the advantage is meaningless, unless you're fighting for a world with someone else. Its just nice to have. Its QoL. 
---
Basicly, people with runelite have a super tiny advantage over someone who doesnt, so you want to remove that advantage so that you can take advantage by a tedious method. 
---
You're fucking over thousands of players QoL to make things equal to those who doesnt know any better. Why?
---
Now someone do the mithril 6H with Hoopa
---
Keep old school old school but dont remove my futuristic qol client with its 10000 plugins and overlays that would obviously be seen as cheating back in 2007 plz

i go to the abyss, enter with the taslisman in my inv and pure essence, and i can't click on the altar at all. I've also wore the death tiara and it doesn't allow me to craft the runes.
---
The problem is not entering, the problem is clicking and actually making the runes, the altar is just bank with an examine.

i'm too lazy to make this link look pretty but a clan member of other scapers recently passed away; this was his tribute.

Well they'd both start at full health but Dwayne would take the early advantage but smacking dharok around and then dharok would have a huge hit when hes about dead, making the sickest comeback victory in a fight ever.

Nah you just have to use the talisman on the altar
---
I had the talisman, couldn't craft, made a tiara, and still can't craft.

Cracker from another acc?
---
The idea of tying combat level to equipment is interesting but I feel like it would be insanely punishing to players using tribrid or even hybrid setups.
---
On top of that, it doesn't carry the old school spirit of the game. Manipulating combat level by carefully leveling up is something that's traditional in spirit whether it's balanced or not (and it is not). Changing something like that would set a precedent for changing other core elements that are part of the heart of the old school experience. 
---
For example, pray flicking. It is clearly not intended to work that way, it shouldn't logically be something that's possible to do and using prayer that way makes it far stronger than the skill was intended to be. But you couldn't change that, it's too intrinsic to the experience now. You can only imagine what a poll about that would look like, though. 
---
A combat level rework would probably meet the same level of refusal as well.
---
Fact is, it works in a dumb way, and it should continue to for the good of nostalgia.

Yeaaah I work full time IT in the government and let's just say I wouldn't have a max cape if I had another job

Didn't they do this in RS3 and people complained that there's no one place people congregate now
---
What a great conflation of two different things. The client and the game content are two entirely different things that unify to make the gameplay experience that is OSRS. 
---
The client being a dated piece of legacy Java is ridiculous at this point. OSRS brings in almost as much, if not an equal amount of money, as RS3. Jagex had a golden opportunity during the initial RuneLite drama to integrate and adapt an amazing open source project into their actual development (as it utilized their IP) and cut off third party clients.
---
RuneLite runs on more systems without needing hacky work arounds. (I am looking at you WINE) Mac, Windows, Linux. Easy as butter. It allows modern hardware to reduce CPU loads enabling better multitasking while playing. It easily adds information directly into the players view. It is modularized allowing easier development in the future.
---
OSRS does not have to have the same things as the OG client did to have the SPIRIT of the game in 2007. Experience tracking, loot being listed on the ground, daily task listings, GPU acceleration, key remapping, UI scaling, and minigame information are all things that are quality of life and do not affect the spirit of the game. They make the game more enjoyable for many, many people and do not give an unfair advantage. 
---
I personally take offense to:
---
&gt;Guess it aint old school if it affects me negatively huh
---
RuneLite in particular allows for accessibility features to be developed for players with special needs. My cerebral palsy makes dropping inventories very difficult, fast gear switching impossible, and tick manipulation impossible as I don't have the fine motor control due to muscle spasticity. The game is so sensitive to moving the mouse while clicking on the inventory (7 pixels) that is a legitimate struggle even after decades of playing due to my hands shaking. With shift anti-drag I can actually do power methods, bossing that requires gear switches, pvp, and three tick methods. I could imagine there are potential applications for colorblind players here as well.
---
I have reservations about a lot of what 3rd party clients have done to the game in terms of OP plugins. (Anything that displays bossing information, attack timings, wave information, where to stand, or what prayer is needed) Menu swapping is also something that needs to be limited to shopping, travel options, and maybe a few other cases. But Jagex literally had a better, customizable client handed to them on a silver platter that they could have overtaken due to it utilizing their intellectual property and they chose not to.
---
Many things do not change the spirit or drastically lower the skill floor of the game. You can have the gameplay experience of OSRS be drastically improved by not having a shit client without taking away the gameplay that makes it special.
---
PS: Where are you getting the stats on people who fight game content changes and how that overlaps with people who want client changes?
---
She for sure is assuming my work is a leagues more complicated than it is. I'm basically a glorified paper stocker for printers around campus and password changer.

Personal preference, I switch my spellbooks often and tele out to GE for example and having ornate box next to occult altar is really nice. I see your point tho

In most countries (and some US states I think), you can vote by mail. Never need to go to a poll booth.

Void mage is better in *most* places until you have Ahrims AND tormented bracelet. If you cannot afford a tormented bracelet, elite void mage is better for most cases and you should not be ashamed of using it
---
If you use a tbow instead, yeah

Otherwise you won't be killing it nearly as fast using other gear.

Why do you compare melee weapon, defender and barrows gloves to vestment robes that have nothing to do with glove slot, shield slot and melee slot? That doesn't make sense. It's like I would say: well Vestment robe top has +6 prayer bonus, same amount of prayer bonus as the whole blessed d'hide set has and it's 1800k cheaper!

I think its mainly because settled dosent really present his snowflake account as a sort of "Wow look how good I am" in the same way AE did, AEs videos were (To most people) pretty dull explanations of the thing he's done for 500 hours in a monotone voice. Where as settled has atleast made decent attempts on keeping it pretty interesting, even when its a very dull activity, either through editing, explaining what he is doing well, humour or just generally sounding enthusiastic.

---
&gt;High level players are the most hated group of players, even more so than pkers, at the same time Settled is possibly the most liked content creator ever and hes totally exempt from any sort of criticism.
---
While i agree Settled is less critized i do feel there is something more going on than just the swampletics hype train that makes it this way.
---
It isn't neccesarily being high leveled that causes hate, rather a sense of elitism. Granted most people only get that way when they're a higher level. I think Settled has proven to be rather unelitist and mostly wholesome. 
---
Back when autumn elegy was still around he played osrs a bit more like a purist. He offered a counter voice to changes he saw as a power creep and this made him seem elitist. Although having that counter voice was some what nice for debate it's ultimately what made the hate come his way. I do miss having him for that even though i didn't always agree. 
---
A noteable point of controversy in his f2p account was the lobby to not have a rune scim on the obor table. Something which can be seen as "f2p'ers can't get their own rscim thanks to one elitist dude not wanting to be devalued". Where as the impling thing is help with a near impossible task in a way any iron can do but at a scope only he can, so a new highly anticipated episode can drop. It's a community event with a huge prise pot.

I just swap between var armour and  graceful top when I'm done mining. It's not like inventory space is an issue for this fight so why not bring the switch

Probably leaked by a third party client. Only people I know who’ve got them all use runelite. I really only play mobile and I know two other people who only play mobile and we haven’t gotten them. Perhaps convenience comes at the price of security.
---
So no head?
---
There are 3 ways a game can be seen as dead;
---
1. The amount of people playing the game is so low that there isn’t a dedicated community for it anymore, this isn’t the case, the players and members of the rs community are really passionate about the title. 
---
2. The money made from the game is less than it takes to support it. This isn’t the case as most of the efforts of the team seem to be based around keeping the MTX as in your face as they can. Some members of the community are addicted to purchasing them.(this is a problem)
---
3. Looking at twitch viewership and using that as the full measurement without doing any research and posting it for pitty karma on Reddit in as many places as possible.  
---
Which one did you do ?
---
Sounds like you need to find another job
---
Really you can move onto cooking sharks at 80 since the burn rate for those is low. Minor losses from burnt fish will be outweighed by the increased xp/hr
---
i think this would be a headache to code considering the cannon's accuracy is based solely on your gear, not the cannonball.
---
This is my favorite scene from the lion the witch and the wardrobe
---
they were garbage tasks lol
---
I really hope they make it lore that all the Fremenniks are bi sexual, and many of them are in same sex relationships, just to really upset the snowflakes like you
---
Yer to be fair did think that you were talking about that. The perk is meh but a lot of them are. When added to the max cape it really dose become quite useful
---
It's lazy because it's not an optimal solution. Using existing code and just apply it from east to west is definitely esier than making new code, no need to ask a dev for that.
---
About the 2nd part: players/npc's don't block line of sight, so your own character wouldn't block line of sight either.
---
I can't seem to find where all those screenshots go :D
---
Well post like this make me happy. Makes me realize my simple life isn’t a waste because other people clearly throw theirs away. 19 hours a day. That’s insane dude and not in an impressive way. I don’t understand people like this. You have the drive to do incredible things with that kind of aptitude but you use it for this? Don’t get me wrong I’m huge gamer time waster my self but this kind of stuff takes so much dedications and focus something that a lot of people don’t have. And all I’m saying is your wasting an incredible talent on crap my dude. Don’t get me wrong I love gaming but really man, imagine if you applied this much effort to other areas of your life, with your level of dedication and focus you could really be something. But hey life is what you make it I guess.
---
So what slayer xp/h is good these days?
---
And yeah I can agree that they were not the best tasks

If you’re talking about Hyphonix it’s because people don’t know he owes billions more than he says because he blocks and bans people who talk about the people he bans trying to get the money they are owed back

Maybe a bit of motivation for you. from \~85-95 slayer my slayer tab was worth a bit over 200m. I sold it off. from 95-99 slayer i saved it all up again and it got to around 350m.
---
early tasks that will net you some gp: gargoyles, kurasks, dust devils, nechs, black dragons (brutal), wyverns. once you get into the higher levels, abby demons, krakens, smoke devils, youll start to open up the option of bosses like cerb, alchemical hydra, dag kings(though you dont need a slayer level for these but you will need high stats pref 90+ and the fremmy elite diary is strongly recommended)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just know some days slayer might be boring, you might get shit tasks etc. some days you might walk out with 50m+ worth of loot from a days worth of slayer. The early levels suck, and people often point newer players to slayer to make money but it really is a long term investment.

While not a qol tip for older players, I recommend new players to quest through most early levels of skills to skip the tedious early grinds (agility, farming, herblore and some others). If anyone is interested I can link the spreadsheet I've used to almost reach master cape in a month.

I logged yesterday after I got a bunch of levels on my skiller and I'm level 3. My scores still popped up?

if you contact them with info from public dbs etc (check haveibeenpwned) they are supposed to remove the info or keep a note for recovery so worth a shot that way
---
It's not faked, though. I bought it from myself. A real picture of GE history proves nothing.
---
Not to denounce this but be careful with what information you have available on your facebook when joining OSRS groups. People have gotten enough information to get recovered from that stuff.
---
The BA one is not quite as straight forward as that if the rest of the team is not that experienced.

Is it allowed to have a 1 mouseclick on a keyboard button? I use this to give my right hand some rest when prayer flicking
---
Discord party feature? Can you elaborate?
---
You're right. Such a reward should require 300qp, elite wildy diary, and the bones of 100 other players.
---
CoD is 18+ tho. Sure 99% of players are 12 to 14 but still

Yes. No movement though, so you can't move the cursor to a specific position by pressing that keyboard button.

They can't change your email to theirs unless they had access to your email too..

that's because they're busy designing new elves...

Duradel is only better because the monsters he assigns aren't area restricted so you can kill boss variants of them. So before you can kill bosses konar is still more profit.

So many negative comments about everything. OP has a great account and should be proud of it.

Congratulations on 99 slayer OP! 🎊🎉

I pretty much had the log completed up until I got theclaw; if you don’t count the stupid cheese dragon ammo drops. I’m just missing knives.

i tried to practice but the little bird keeps draining my prayer and i cant even practice trying to click my prays because i have no prays
---
Oh yeah shit I didnt see the green dots packed in at the top
---
It matters not who threw the first stone, cow.
---
His attitude towards updates like when the volcanic mine was released when he literally tweeted "glad I got 200m mining wheb it was still respectable" , while he used a method significantly faster than volcanic mine is why he was hated. Settled never sayd stupid shiy like that.
---
They do have stupid high kill rates, but I've heard it's mostly because they'll take in an animal regardless of condition. Moreso than other shelters I guess, I'm not sure
---
You should always kill the prayer-drainers first. Have you watched any in-depth guides for the caves? And you shouldn’t have to flick your prayers, you can keep the right protection prayer on whenever it’s needed.
---
Stop if no one fucking cared before I’m going to care for a second and tell you to stop
---
Honestly, I fucking hate quests so that's my excuse for the first one, second, I've never done fight caves, don't trust myself
---
Oh you can bring him back to life but he will never be the same again. Once someone dies once it changes them, they become more rekless and other people don't see any value to their actions.
---
Zulrah and raids with 52 magic is fine?
---
I hope you’re trolling. If not, stop now.
---
Make sure to be using range. Range is the best combat style to use in the fight caves. You can kill the bats before they can hit you. Also look up a guide on YouTube. There are so many good videos about how to do jad now. Goodluck
---

---
It's not a zezima parody but it is a guy screaming at his mum while playing runescape.
---
Just stop lol
---
From what I recall he was pubically against QoL/any increase in xp rates because he had already done the grind and everyone should be forced to do it that way. Not to mention everyone blamed him for Jagex not giving thoae updates.
---
Naw but 80 magic wouldnt be that bad at all. Just smash out ice burst(boost with imbued heart as well if you want) then you can pretty much afk at mm2 tunnels for 200k+ exp an hr. If not then just do vorkath its easier and better money then zulrah anyways
---
Yes, because 99 att str and range when you're not fighting back is totally gonna make you tankier. 
---
Why haven't you deleted your account yet?
---
Since your really low level your risk will be like 5k in f2p. Just go out and have fun. And keep going back after leveling up. 
---
Use a combat level calculator to balance your stats out and watch some videos about different builds and what type of pking they each can and cant do.
---
Feel free to hmu if you have any questions about f2p or p2p pvp.
---
I got emails like a month ago and haven’t received any since.
---
Why didn't she just respawn?
---
Try taking full torag, and dfs, with dds. Its easier to get firecape with tabky gear. You only need to pray mage at jad then ;)
---
Smithing cape acts as goldsmith gauntlets making training post 99 at blast furnace easier
---
So wintertod perk for fm cape isn't something out of ordinary perks.
---
Did he not hit any traffic on the way over?
---
5 min afk with OL, 20 minute AFK with combats.
---
No offense but why make such a post?
---
It'll take a very long time to actually average out to 50% w/l rate
---
i wouldnt have made it to the fight caves if it were not for runelite........ i clicked on a hole in a jungle and thank god i made it because the fire cape looks so cool i need to get it because it is the best cape in the game
---
How is being forced into moneymaking for membership fun? Also, I HAVE to work the 8 hours a day. Im not a fucking neet like you. Logic is hard.
---
Haha. Yeah the last time I played was when I was really young so I’m really revisiting osrs with a 7 year old’s knowledge on the game
---
Did you even read what he said.
---
oh thank you but i dont know where to get those items? i heard torag before i think it is the best armor in the game??
---
I use mantas seeing as zulrah shits em out and karambwans to combo eat.
---
It all depends on what kind of monitoring they have, if it's a personal laptop you should be fine with a vpn.
---
Do you have nothing better to do after selling your account?
---
And then he's trying to use that phone VPN BS excuse too lmao. OP enjoy prison!

TIL all oil paintings are one artstyle because I can tell its an oil painting

I think it's just the one whale tattoo
---
Mm1 is very easily manageable at a lower level as long aw you have protection prayers. I guess technically for the way you’re asking yes lvl 79 isnt bad for doing it, but if you are following any sort of account building guide, you’ll probably have that quest done long before 70
---
This makes me want to make an f2p alt account. I’ve never dived into ults/ironmans/etc. my main takes enough of my energy and time as a dad. But heck, nothing beats starting the game with a fresh account
---
Have you got any more info on this? Videos or article posts or discussions or anything? I'm curious, I haven't heard of that
---
They can't help Zezima, they won't do shit for a random bloke. His best option is to move on and create a new account or risking putting in 1000s of hours only to have it recovered in a year or so from now and wiped.

Wtf kinda game you playing
---
Tick manip adds an enormous amount of depth to an otherwise mechanically simple game. Remove tick manip and this game is insanely stale, the skill cap is already significantly lower than any other game I've played, there are multiple players that have literally mastered the game. 
---
Blows my mind that people think it should be removed.
---
And yet mod ash still gave him the prize money out of his own pocket, hmmm
---
キングトイシ
---
This is a couple weeks after you made a post about how third clients remove the fun out of the game.
---
Almost seems like it gave more intrinsic value to those items or the ability to attain those items. Like scarcity and attainability were factors in trading, and offered more value to players seeking to learn how to get those items the "ironman way"

Nah PvMers will still cry

Basically that's a 75 attack med in the making. Get at least 94 range and magic, ideally 99 both. Then 77 prayer and augury+rigour. It's a sick account tôt PKing deep wild, 109 combat maxed and the AGS will let you compete with maxed mains.

It's always been a slippery slope, it was literally just a matter of time. I mean we had farming plugins that would completely monitor your crops back in 2015 from OSB. Jagex banned it but yeah, no real restrictive framework was ever put in place so it just happened again.
---
It's because of the red clicks when he attempts to pick up the food.
---
I agree, partnering with runelite seems like the only appropriate approach.
---
bro i suggest you level fm, rc and cooking before you hit 99 slayer cos that shit is just embarrassing
---
My boi! This is most excellent

That's what you get for questing.

I mean you can reach level 200 on maplestory in under 30 minutes, but that is with very particular events, from experienced players with help from others, p2w items and lots of pre made gears to speed everything up. Generally a fairly experienced player can still do it in 4 hours or so but the point is that 1-200 is essentially the tutorial now, and post 200 is where the real grind starts. It’s the equivalent of rs3 making 1-99 easy  and having 100-126 take a long ass time. Most players can get 10% exp per level from 240-250, and then maybe 5% exp per level from 250-255, and then 2.5% from 255-265, and for the final 10 levels you’ll earn 1% an hour. They have just shifted the grind and honestly the games difficulty curve is much healthier than it ever has been at this point.
---
Pretty accurate. 
---
Torso = easy mode
---
Ba pet = one of the longest grinds in the game.
---
Hamful
---
Did you talk to Oziach tho?
---
Wtf are these whacky no up-votes??
---
They don’t help as nothing gets depleted
---
I honestly thought of this before, it would definitely earn them more money. However, even for Jagex, I believe that would be way too shady and if anything slipped about it, it would most definitely ruin their reputation as a company. I'm also sure things like that would go against trading standards and/or be somewhat illegal, no?
---
Interesting, and it doesn't always use your slash attack?
---
except you gotta shift drop every time your invo fills sense its barb fishing
---
Okay thanks
---
Hol' the fuck up. Did you just try to xpost this from r/2007scape to r/2007scape ?
---
That's gonna be a downvote from me dawg.
---
Yep! Clicking the item makes you start the walk and red-X action simultaneously. It is chained by the graardor-click red-X.
---
If you go by sound or waiting for a stomp thats why. Just turn sound off and watch the bottoms of his feet right when he lifts up. If they're facing forward pray range. If they're facing the ground pray mage. Theres no need to wait on an extended hover or stomp. If you do it like this you won't panic pray or flick wrong since you can tell what attack he's doing almost immediately. 
---
Good luck finding a youtube video that tells you to do this. There's one but you'd have to dig for it.
---
I've seen some lower but a level 1 Skilling pet is still super unique and cool
---
It's substantially faster to do those on task.
---
I see you have a lot of food; this tells me that you take a lot of damage. That should improve with practice, and bp specs heal you from the unavoidable damage.
---
Congrats!  You should think about doing slayer for your range training imo.  With all that money you can easily splurge a bit and use a cannon for all tasks and get great range xp and good slayer xp at the same time.  Goodluck with the firecape
---
Wtf? Can you take a screenshot or something?
---
No
---
You can’t even tell if it was the next kill.
---
There is more going on than rs3. Wtf am I supposed to look at
---
So do they use there dick to drag them along?
---
ewwwwww
---
&gt;I'm not a fucking neet like you
---
Yes, that is you objectively using the term as an insult. I'm sorry your education failed you on that one.
---
You don't have a clue what you're talking about. The headers are the same, spoofed emails don't have that.
---
Wtf, candy is the shit dude
---
more
---
Except it isnt, they're grabbing information from the player that can see the path and distributing it to those who cant.
---
stuff like this makes me realise I am way too stupid to do bossing in this game
---
Its 100% comparable. Splashing fire wave will get you 50k xp an hour at most and costs over 400k an hour.
---
Zmi runners were like 2m an hour at 160k xp an hour. The price isnt mutch of a difference when calculating price per exp.
---
Fire wave is 8.5gp per exp, a I running was 12.5gp per exp.
---
This might be slightly outdated, before the big nerf to splashing and idk if zmi running was patched I can't remember.
---
I haven’t done the research on it. But that’s a valid viewpoint for sure. I guess if anything got out it would be in shambles PR wise. And if we’re being real most of those sites have customer support so it can’t be jamflex right? 😂

Budget cut makes sense. Easier than ever to bot and sell gold. Pretty sad, Jagex is profitable as fuck already and can't even try to maintain game integrity for their players. Instead they actually reduce it.
---
It's still funny to me regardless of what you think lol.

Omg.lemee guess my favorite color blue is actually wrong too?

How is runecrafting one of your highest skills? 
---
Congrats btw
---
Lol I know what op is asking because I'm the one who corrected him. No I didn't answer the question he meant to ask. Because I'm telling him he asked the wrong question. OSRS is experiencing deflation. OSRS gold is becoming more valuable. Those are facts. Whether it's a problem or not is the question
---
Elite Void, Assembler (which you'll get from killing Vork), imbue the ring.
---
Then grind out money for DHCB and eventually Ward.
---
Because he is one of those "I played the hard way everyone else should have to" elitists that never wants to see QoL improvements made to the game. So it's slightly justified to dislike him for that attitude and the Internet being what it is that slight dislike amplified to full hate.
---
We're not hiring any artists atm, but when we are they're welcome to apply  (:

Oof

Pretty ballsy starting with a hcim after your break, but I guess it’s working out so far :p 
---
Welcome back and congrats!
---
have to use range also protect from range not mage
---
I think you're backwards still. Go check the price tracker for nearly any item in the game. Nearly every item is worth less than it was six months ago. That means gold is worth more than it was six months ago. 
---
If one day, you can buy an apple for a dollar, and the next day you can buy two apples for a dollar, did the dollar become worth more, or worth less?
---
\#nicehashtag
---
how did u get gold
---
Buying bonds isn't an item sink though, it's not even a money sink. The money doesn't leave the game, it just transfers to someone else.
---
Okay boys I'm baffled, where's the 69/420
---
yes but not at low levels, around 70 slayer youll start unlocking profitable monsters
---
metal dragons are shit, skip them
---
You say this, but I haven’t completed mory hard and have made about 8 mil from 50 barrows chests. Definitely still worth doing if you don’t have the time or inclination to grind out mory hard right away. Sometimes it seems like this game is always “achieve this efficient way to do things before you’re allowed to actually play the game.”

Not quite what I said. I was referring to the Fremmy boots being changed unpolled as they are frequently complained about not looking like boots within the inventory and have already gone through a few changes :P
---
As for the pre-exsiting boots (dragon/bandos), it would be safer to poll those and I can imagine it passing based on the responses I got on twitter.
---
but we have already prospector? from mlm?
---
From his rants it didnt feel like that. I feel like thats reddits interpretation. He made good points on what updates werent good, and what ideal skilling updates should look like. Jagex has been shit in the past with updates.
---
What is the red click bug?

Wtf are you even talking about, gold uses be like 1m for 75cent now it is like 1m for 63cent, gold is worth less.

You lack empathy. No one wants to hear your dick holster spit the issues with riding a motorcycle. Attitudes like yours are never welcomed and you know you're just instigating. Pay respects or, say nothing and move on

Soul wars was amazing. Countering barrages, rushing the avatars, and the clan battles. That was my golden age of runescape. It was perfect pvp/pvm mashup. I hope they would bring it back

if no xp boost  then a good reason.
---
Slayer is amazing. If nothing else, it keeps your mind off of the monotony of grinding a single monster or boss for exp/gp forever. The higher your slayer level, the more profit you should expect to make. Things start to get nice at 70+. I personally went from struggling to afford my bond every 2 weeks to being able to afford amazing gear and upgrades. I was able to just casually buy things such as Rigour and 90 herblore with some extra funds from my journey toward 99 Slayer without needing to sacrifice any of my gear. Stop mageing those Iron Dragons and start your Slayer grind! All of your levels will fly by :)
---
...you have to fill out an application for certain discord chats? Who the fuck are these people.
---
I was hoping to get lucky within my first 10 chests.... I didn't so I just continued hoping for something useful for my slayer grind (tank body or legs).
---
Yeap, I did that already. There was a drop in late 2017, then everything has either baselined or started rising. Did this on about 20 different major trade items/armor sets. Then about 20 individual weapons . 
---
If you need me to start an IMGUR account to show you my actual data sets, I can.

I’d stay 1 thieving forever. New account build lol

I get you were going for humor here but it came off as trying waaay to hard for cheap laughs that just werent funny. Would of preferred just an actual video without the dumb extra cuts. Not being a dick or troll here, just really wasnt funny.
---
Wow that one got me bad the other day
---
The G.E. should be a trading floor and you open a contract with a broker (the brokers are standing around the general G.E. area), different brokers have different commission structures (g.e. tax gold sink reeeee) that attract different player types/level brackets to gather round them.
---
I just let him run off
---
What's disrespectful is celebrating someone wasting their free time on Runescape then dying at 25 without ever achieving anything genuinely meaningful but remembering them like they were a fucking war hero.  This motivates me to find more positive ways to spend my time as should you. People living hundreds/thousands of miles away that you have never met in person are not your friends.
---
&gt;I dont doubt people dislike him because he stands in the way of convenience-scape
---
 I'll say again, that doesn't mean anyone who views him to have a bad attitude disagrees with what he says.
---
67 here.. Only good RNG I’ve ever had &amp; it’s absurd RNG lol
---
Is it really "only" 43m right now? The price I remember it being is around 70-80m.
---
This is actually substantially less xp toward a pet since you didn’t fish or mine either, gz wow
---
You realize you can never level up thievery now right? That's way too cool
---
I bought full prospector, completed the falador hard diary with it, then sold it back and bought upper level access. After that I bought the coal bag. You don't really need full prospector considering the XP boost it gives is far outweighed by the amount of time it takes to get. It is needed for master clue steps if that's something you're interested in.
---
Do we add apples or oranges to the school's healthy diet program?
---
You: StRawb3rriEz LOL
---
Are you that dumb? Item sinks refer to gear, you know, the things that come into the game via, for example, bossing... Things such as Bandos, blowpipe, DWH, Scythe, to name a few. Bonds are different because they're MTX. So yes, people using bonds is an item sink, for bonds, a thing that's MTX, but they don't magically sink bandos tassets at the same time, do they?
---
I’m also a big fan of siracha
---
Just did lel
---
Mostly the ahrims and veracs imo
---
I’m not there yet, but maybe one day
---
hooray i got 99 rc, i got my first fire cape in 150 billion years, look i got the pet with 500m xp etc etc
---
Dude no one is actually telling you to literally kill yourself... It's a joke 99% of the time
---
I'm gonna guess that maybe unlocking jad task right now won't be the best bet. At 93 combat on first account there's a good chance OP would struggle with jad right now. Better to save all your points for a slayer helm first and foremost.
---
Not true. That's been a long time rumor to the point it's become a meme basically. Konduit didn't even store info like that
---
Only because of bots farming it make the statistics of the pet drop higher. An actual player grinding it out is a lot more rarer than a “player” having the pet. Drop rate of it is 1/3k so i wouldn’t call this bad boy common by any means. 
---
Sorry for your loss my man. Hopefully you will get more good rng soon
---
Isn't it a pretty niche weapon though?
---
That’s an RS3 thing and it’s not really a ring of life it’s an extra life
---
No kidding. And honestly, why would you choose RS over the prime Halo 3/CoD 4/MW 2 days? There was nothing like hanging out with your bros all day at school, then everyone rushing home and getting on Xbox Live to play in a party chat for a solid 3-4 hours.
---
Getting 10th prestige with the boys--that's a feeling I'll never get back. Better than any 99 I ever got on the 'Scape.
---
can't wait for mat k to try out this method
---
He deleted his post lol
---
You're right, you can. So that's why there are region based teams, and announcers, and alterations to the rules to make things exciting. If there's something people enjoy doing, most likely they will also enjoy watching other excel at the same thing. Basketball has had times in its history where it started to decline a lot in viewership and attendance and things like dunking and 3 point shots were brought around.
---
I just don't really see what point you're trying to make. There has to be a repetitive nature to anything worth getting good at. Otherwise how would you practice it. The guy your replying to is just stating that there are people who are so enthusiastic about any given activity that they are hard not to like, that's why they are successful.
---
dude, u just got scammed for -1m gp, hahah ur a noob
---
having the email and access to that email is the only way. if you dont then just start a new account or something.
---
If you left/quit around the EOC update and never logged into the OSRS servers, they reset everything anyways, so starting a new account wouldn't really be much different. Not sure what else you could do if you have already been denied.
---
I just vote no to literally any change to the game, everyone else can get fucked.

How a skiller is born

What about fishing trawler for a solid 1/5000 chance? Maybe a change of pace is what you need

Because if you want that op feature you have to install runelite which is not officially deemed safe by jagex so people chose the recommended version offered by jagex itself which doesnt have those features.

It is all a facade. When going to the sand casino you will never leave because you want to ride the “wave”.

All I ever hear people say is “this is my win” or “imagine I could make this much” but they never think of the down side of “I could lose this much” or “ I will have to grind X hours to get this money back”

I recommend you just never use a ring a dueling again. Clan I’m an admin for we have a strict rule of not talking about staking in the CC because people do not have self control. As well, 1 good turn out can cause people to believe “if I go, I’ll be just as lucky as my friend who just won”. Which always leads to staking the bank.
---
Okay yeah I am interested in doing master clue in the future. So is coal bag important for anything but MLM upper access?
---
The funniest part of this, for me, was based on the comments in the thread it seemed like he was most bummed about raid item prices...which really kinda sums up pvmers in one shot.

Well only because i forgot an anti, i changed nothing in the inventory or loot bag boys but i cant argue against that haha

You missed the part where he planted ashes and an iron dagger on his corpse.

Consider that those who had to get 99 crafting using just charters probably view those who use the giant seaweed/desert sand grinder cheaters because they can get 99 crafting quicker.  It's a similar thing, I really don't think it matters that much.  Practically, Jagex is doing the right thing.  They're spending their limited resources on releasing cool new content.  I'd rather have the Gauntlet then satisfy a subset of the community that cares about this kind of thing.  I really don't get why it matters that much, because if you're playing the game for enjoyment you wouldn't care.  It's when people make it into a prestige competition that you get into these arguments.
---
Probably from Skåne.
---
Ban all 3rd party clients so that everyone can experience osrs. You are devaluing pre 3rd party client users. But seriously I hope I'm around when they do this. This reddit is going to have so many crabs, it's going to be glorious.
---
Nothing gets past you does it?
---
You also get skulled when using it.
---
I’d vote no to adding more non-PvP content to a PvP area lol.
---
nice kc should have hidden it, say goodbye to the account mate
---
You must have played years ago when killing iron dragons for the d med helm drop was very profitable.  This is no longer the case.  There are many other mobs that are much more profitable.
---
Wow.... got me nervous. I’ve been routing for Sick Nerd to finish the tob.
---
*Cries in 99 thieving no pet*
---
Then you get piled on by a clan, and they each get a 100k split.
---
&gt; then range will probably be better because it gives you more space to move so you miss less attacks. Additionally,

Thanks!

not gonna rebound to 1b
---
it's real worth is 600-700m
---
Fair enough. For what it's worth I did watch it through and enjoyed most of the shit post-type of clips. Actually my favorite types of videos. I'd say solid 7/10
---
How is it becoming more valuable you doofus 
---
It used to get you MORE rs3 gold and more real money 
---
Now it gets you less
---
What are the chances though
---
Thanks :) yeah its very afk and chill to train after 77 even on mobile. Going for 99
---
aye mine was also at 23 mate!
---
Nice one man.  What’s your history with RS?
---
I played back in 06. Player for countless hours but never had a very good account.
---
I’ve been playing OSRS casually myself over the last 3 years and have a total level of around 1350 I think.  I enjoy these little milestones myself.
---
Just got a 120+ Kourend cavern Hellhound task from Konar. I’m 80 combat lvl. I wouldn’t mind grinding some hard clues, but I hear hellhounds tear you a new one and my defense is 60. Should I skip or grind it?
---
Imo, bleached graceful is sexy af.
---
So, you can be lightweight as well as fascist scum!
---
Wow thank you this is a great summary! So it seems to me like the biggest underlying theme here is that there were a myriad of ways to progress your character, and a lot of the love for the game comes from the different ways in which you can do that and what new things you are able to do from unlocking those skills? Obviously that's an oversimplification, but that seems to be the core of it, right?
---
That player graph is super interesting. Out of curioisity, what caused the giant player spike from Apr 2018 - Jan 2019?
---
He meant remove boosting from the game as well.
---
Funny thing is they don't care about people who make accounts to flex either.
---
Hear me out -
---
What if graceful didn’t have recolors as we know it now, but had different styles and colors according to different gangs / sides you pick in quests. E.g: HAM, Black Arm, the elves in SOTE, and so on
---
Protect from Melee nullifies all damage from Hellhounds. Bring some prayer potions and a bonecrusher and you can kill them for ages on a single trip
---
This is so stupid lol if they bought it they’d just shit it down so they could sell more bonds
---
Just equip proselyte and pray melee
---
konar slayer is now one of my favorite ways to play the game. 
---
i never liked slayer. but now, i get to explore areas that i'm never at (who fights hellhounds in taverley dungeon? me now) AND i get a dopamine key every one in a while.
---
i'm still a noob (just got 55 slayer today) but i'll probably do konar for slayer for a while until i want to get a rune pouch... then back to konar.

It’s actually mostly because peta puts down domestic animals that are left in their care. Their reason? Being domesticated by humans is worse than death.
---
I agree with you. 
---
My personal opinion, those types of mechanics are tedious and aren't very fun. 
---
Even having to walk under the boss to avoid a hit, pray flicking and hell counting boss attacks are mechanics I don't find very fun to deal with.
---
This is the right mindset, honestly fuck efficiency, play how you want to play. Whether it be efficient or otherwise.
---
Everyone seem to have forgotten about the database dump from Jed that occured just last year?
---
There's still dds for the ppl that cant get the upgrade
---
I'll have to check this game out again lol, I remember it being basically the knock off of runescape.
---
I did like the art though, and yeah I'm not sure how rare that weapon was but when I completed it so fast it felt so good, thing melted opponents.
---
Are you that unobservant? 
---
Did you vote No to most PvP updates because you are blind?
---
Is this your first pet?
---
How does it make you feel that you went 100+ kills not knowing you got the only drop people want from that boss?
---
Are you going to grind it again?
---
Hello, can we get a PvP world where there is no 15 combat level difference in  fights? maybe only up to 5 combat difference?
---
that's gonna be a big rip from me
---
I’m just a bald white guy that always wears the gnome child hat. I doubt I’ll ever change it

you cant chop the tree next to draynor bank because there is an npc hiding in it. clearly nobody else gets it either lol

You're not the only one.

---
Lately there has been a lot of demand for enabling the poh treasure chest to store individual items. A few weeks back you stated that this change would risk losing stored items. Could you perhaps make a different piece of furniture in that spot that has this feature? This way, players would have to remove their items before upgrading. Perhaps requiring higher construction?
---
Kinda ironic coming from the guy begging for pRNG to be added to the game because he can’t accomplish his own goal

Trust me, you do not need a gaming laptop to play OSRS. Besides if you wanted a gaming laptop do not buy Alienware. They're massively overpriced and are outclassed by cheaper laptops. 
---
Just buy a laptop with an i5 8265U processor &amp; 8gb+ of ram and you'll be fine for OSRS. This a good one and well priced, also 10% off if you're a student:

Some of the guys at r/ironscape would love your RNG

Thanks, /u/SquirtGirl69

you can attempt to chop it and then the npc yells at you. the guy was doing it for over 20 minutes
---
Wait can you elaborate on this? I've paused the wave, killed the last monster and now I'm just standing here letting my health regen. While doing so, I sometimes walk away to do other things. If I don't make it back in time before the log out, will it make me redo the last wave, or will it just act a normal log?
---
Yes, no, yes, very bad, eventually :(.

can it be made possible to swap to earlier tiers of diary gear? my fashionscape demands it!!

Can’t make valid counter argument so they just want to belittle the other person now. Classic Reddit. Sure go ahead and copy pasta. It will be a reminder of the time you couldn’t form a full opinion or comeback.

That's exactly it!

Any tips? Got a waterfiend task and struggling. 76/76/76 with 80 mage. Karils with prims, torture, bez(I), slayer helm, and Sara sword (for crush). Going through 2-3 sharks a kill for some reason

I’ll throw it on over there too, thanks for the suggestions!

still not bad!

add goblin slayer as a slayer master that only gives goblin tasks

This one please!

Would you consider making the Grand Exchange accessible via all banks like previous trading posts? Leave the Grand exchange for those who prefer it, but it’d be nice for players to be able to fill other place’s banks in the world and not centralizing players to one area for only that purpose.
---
Can you address the frame stuttering players get while inside the demonic gorilla cave? This happens regardless of client type and has been in-game for over 3 years now. Jagex, pls fix.
---
Way to distort my suggestions to reduce extremely dry streaks by *extending* pRNG (because we already have pRNG, it just doesn't scale after 99) just so you can insert a quick ad hominem attack. I'm committing to my goal, because I can play this game however the fuck I want. Wanting to add progressive RNG doesn't mean I don't enjoy it, it just means I think it would benefit the game.

According to the wiki, from one pickpocket the odds are roughly 1 in 250k, so to get it before level 2 is like 1 in 25k

In the future when you sign up for websites, you can add a +whatever to your email address. Anything after the plus is basically ignored.

E.g. your.name+runescapesecret@gmail.com

In the case of runescape, this will be your login. Your.name@gmail.com won’t work.

If you do this for all websites, and your data is dumped, they should only have the email for that website.

Could you allow untradeable items to be taken inside the test rooms during the Recruitment Drive quest? The quest requires you to have an empty inventory when going in but UIM are not able to enter as they can't store their untradeables anywhere, even by purposely dying to leave them on the ground, as untradeables are kept on death.

What if he installed a virtual machine (with a separate mac and ip address), and then installed both the client and vpn on said virtual machine? 
---
The installation of the virtualization software could go unnoticed (depending on his job of course) and then he could just install the rest when he is not at work (if we are assuming it's a laptop he can bring home).
---
Do you think that could work?

Post kc so we know how mad we should be.

Ooooh ok got it. Thanks dude

how do you figure?

Convenience doesn't equal good game design. Taking that to the extreme, the suggestion the other day about the bank at nature altar would be a good idea, so convenience is void as a fundamental principle of game design.
---
The issues you mention makes players feel invested in their activity, which is *good* in spite of being frustrating at times as well.
---
There's nothing to counter in that stupid rant. People play this game the way they want to. If you're belittling them because you're unable to understand why they like what they like, you're the one with issues, not them.

Can combat dummies be upgradeable to have max hits vs dragons and wildy monsters, using dragonbane/wildy weapons respectfully? Could be a new higher leveled dummy or just thrown into the current undead one. I'd prefer a new one but throwing into the undead one would probably be easier from your pov.

Yea there were several options to make it more likely that I'd make it to the altar but it was just a bitch in the end. Demolishing tons of spices while hoping to get the boost at the right part in the boost cycle so preserve could keep it long enough through whatever steps you need to take to get to the altar with 91 RC was more annoying than RuneCrafting.
---
But great comment have my upvote sir
---
Gz?
---
its fine to get pked doing slayer in wildy. What isnt fine is having ZERO chance to bank anything you get from revs if you arent with a clan or have 80+defense
---
You can die to an instanced boss with a reclaim mechanic, such as zulrah.
---
Be sure to also change your password on other sites where you use the same password/email combination. The only good thing about this is that the chances of being hacked again are very slim, they knew nothing about your account except what they got from the data breach, it should be fine to keep playing on this account. Be sure to follow the other account security tips i gave and try to use a totally new password now.

I swap to my ranged setup that I use for Ahrim.  It has much higher magic accuracy than using melee armor, and you don't have to bring a tri-armor setup.

There must be a reason to go there. 
---
What if you lose everything in new part of Wilderness. You get Pked you'll drop a key to your bank and depends on how deep in wildy you were you'll lose items (problem: muling; solution: color skull according to bank value).
---
Then dont over think it. If waiting will do something then it will be getting you more stressed for later and more frustrated if you dont get the cape. Just a reminder - 1 inventory slot of brew at maximum effect is 48 minutes of natural regeneration.

Fire surge isnt even expensive. Its less than 700k gp/h. U can make that on a lvl 3 with p2p.

Tho i have no problem with splashing. U can literally do non splashing for more xp in nmz the same way.
---
Yeah efficiency is a good tool to use to guide you/get levels/grind if you want to use it, but it kinda kills the spirit of the game IMO. Let people play their own way and be efficient if they want to and inefficient if they want to.

You should find a happy blend of both. Dont burn yourself out but make goals. Maybe cut 1k yews then do magic logs. Just set better goals and take steps towards them. Can be leaps or baby steps but just picking efficiency over the other or vice versa isnt the best way i found. Those moments of efficiency can save you time that you find helps you elsewhere. Just my opinion

Set up a cannon for extra DPS.

Animation idle notification, xp/h, bank tags, skins, hiding attack styles and friend finder are the main reasons i use a 3rd party client.

Am I missing out on the afk aspect? I found walking to the dark altar, and then to the blood altar quite far from an afk experience.

Might check this one out

Olm, zulrah, and theatre of blood are perfect examples of bosses that are engaging and fun without tedious mechanics

slayer good
---
Is it possible to add purples (Cox and Tob) to broadcast to your CC? 
---
ToB would happen when you open chest, Cox as olm dies. 
---
You can not have more than 1 clue of the same difficulty (but you can have all difficulties at the same time). Also there is no normal slayer monster that drops elite (or master for that matter) clues. Also slayer monsters drop mainly hard clues.
---
are there any methods like this for solo/dolo with bp? 
---
only thing i know of bp is 1 tank, double bp dps offticking each other to force aggro minions the entire kill, forcing the melee to constantly dance between the two so the only thing you're taking dmg from is the mage minion. 
---
There any bp solo/dolo methods thats less clicking than defender/shield swapping and going under graardor?
---
April fools: the chaos elemental (and the pets) get spades in all their tentacles

Void is worse for zulrah. Only good thing about it is the low amount of switches
---
Try doing Motherlode Mine and you'll get plenty of coal while you level.
---
Meanwhile 99 still no raccoon
---
How does that help anybody but solely PKers? 
---
There would need to be a 20M+GP/hour money maker just to make it even halfway worth it, and even then the people who'd go for it would have too much risk in their bank.
---
ur retarded. What people meant by “and jagex bans ahk” is exactly the same point as you just made. Its silly for jagex to ban ahk when the majority of people used it with integrity. The same situation 3rd party clients have been in since 2013.
---
The problem I have with drop trading is that I don't have other P2P accounts, though I guess I could. What I do now is just log in a couple times a day to flip on 2 f2p alts and buy bonds on them.

At some point I may drop a few mill to bond up one of the alts that used to be a main.

Yeah the safest thing to do is to just go to your account manually and see if anything is up.

Youre an asshole.

blowpipes are not too far behind anyway, so could be that

I’ve been trying to farm totems while chinning dust devils but I’ve been dry for a while so I decided to learn Zulrah lol. Skotizo pet looks a lot cooler than the zulrah pet though
---
Yes you just need someone to help you, They just will stand in between u and the 4 bosses. Took my buddy and I 3.5 hrs to complete it for him
---
The thieving pet is possible with 0 xp, and requires only one account.
---
So it didnt net any noticeable criticism. Which I was said.
---
Yes, I do the level one master for 1-9 and 10th tasks typically at Konar.
---
Already have broad bolts and Runepouch from it
---
It’s a meme you dip
---
Meaning there's no fee to reclaim items. If you're buying teleports for 18k ea, that's on you.
---
Yeah I dont disagree
---
Yes. Those are inherently equivalent. Both scenarios is someone crying about not having a pet. The only difference is one is projecting through verbal attacks while the other is being straightforward. 
---
&gt;See, now *that* is what irony is.
---
Literally nothing about that statement is ironic, lol. Probably the biggest fail of a “no u” statement I’ve ever seen. You don’t even know what irony is 😂. I pointed out exactly how you’re completely lacking self-awareness, yet your whole reply is you doubling down. Lmao. Now THAT is irony.
---
Honestly complete all of the f2p quest first then get just about base 60 in all f2p skills except for mining and smithing. Then redeem your bond. That’s what I did and I’m so thankful I waited on getting my skills up so I could do a bunch of quests when I got bored of pking
---
I dont get your first paragraph. yes? you need gold for items? 
---
You undeniable lose money training slayer at more then 40kxp/h. so yes you're right, doing vorkath if you get a blue dragon task is a good idea but that has nothing to do with slayer being profitable since if slayer didn't exist nothing about vorkath would change.
---
when you can do vorkath/zulrah consistency the way you see slayer changes, by then you should be skipping any task that isn't cannon-able or bursty since you could just get you slayer xp quickly then make up the gold lost at wherever but that is irrelevant to OP. Right now op is stuck with Nieve/Konar and will find killing general mobs like gargoyles/aberrant/horrors/wyvern/etc profitable but these are all insta skip when you unlock a solid moneymaker

Agreed. And if it's not accepted, they should fix the bug. [Woox sent in a bug report 5 years ago](https://twitter.com/WooxSolo/status/921044317074067456) and it's still not fixed.

Bro, is this real life? And by real life I obviously mean old school rs

I can't argue with someone that is substituting reality for their own fantasy. I do understand your logic, but these scenarios are like night and day.

Though I would miss the SEVERAL other plugins, these are the big ones. My personal order of importance for the plugins you listed would probably go.

* Ground Items

* Loot Tracker

* Bank Value/Tabs

* XP globes
---
* GPU Rendering
---
* Animation Smoothing
---
* Chat Commands
---
* Stretched Mode
---
* Low Detail Mode

Of course that's just my preference of them. AN honorary mention though that I'd like to place in there is Idle notifications. Love me some beeps!

How
---
They share the same servers, why else could rs3 players have osrs players on friends list and vice versa.
---
You can still get it by just running to where the game used to be started at
---
In the case of someone that is grinding hard for their cash in game, I understand. If I was working with a lower bank, I'd probably do the same. But once you get a higher level, might as well pay with gp. Makes sense though, would be a waste if you're limited to not the best money making methods, and all your money grinded goes to grinding for another 2 weeks. I get it
---
Aww you done did it
---
The friends list is a separate server to osrs and rs3. That's why it can sometimes be down while you are still playing.
---
Hahahahahah

How many kills left on task

Ohhh I gotcha. I may have to start doing this, seems like a great way to stay on top of that stuff.

looks like you already did
---
Same happened to me this week. But I don't even have any untradeables left..only play mobile also :s
---
What if you graduated?
---
Another idea is to add an NPC that can hold all your costume room items. So if you were to remove furniture, instead of taking it all out first you could send it to the NPC. The NPC would give it back for free, but you couldn't give them more items to hold. Then if they were to change the Costume Room to store items differently or more what is stored where (why is Ancestral in the Armor Case and not the Magic Wardrobe...why?), they could send it to that NPC for all players. Probably not that easy of a system to add, but it might be easier with more benefits.
---
I somewhat recently read the whole thing from beginning to end. I found the pirate chapters grating and annoying. Then I checked the release dates for those chapters and wept at the idea of waiting years for that part to end.
---
What how do you have myths cape and no firecape? Vork and Galvek are much harder bosses.
---
I'll give you some tips for Jad. Do one action at a time, after u switch prayer sip ur super restore then switch prayer again.
---
I heard some people using chins when the healers spawn so that you don't need to tag them, you can try that as well
---
Jad spawns where the lighter mage dude is in the previous round so kill him last
---
If your not comfortable listening to sound for his attack look at his front legs, If goes up and down immediately prayer ranged and if he goes up and stays up for a while prayer mage
---
Inspired by another comment on this thread - how about 'wilderness' potions that only give their effects within the wild and must be made with special herbs/secondaries only found in the wild?
---
probably nsfw on the east coast only xD
---
I think I’ve seen a few iron man with 1000 chests and no Karils!
---
He din' du' nuffin'.
---
Not Jagex's fault you don't secure your email.
---
Yup!  Best bet is to freeze them and stand underneath them for 10seconds. Then log out!
---
Not 100% sure, but I had 1hp (dharoking) and my prayer was off. I likely died once the mole respawned.
---
Jad is 1 shot and you have to do 40 min all over again, so imo jad is way harder. Heard all the tips about him but the fact that if i die i just wasted 40 min of time makes it that i feel way too pressured to play.
---
Should have been [phileas](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Phileas_Rimor) and herb. Still love it though.
---
Would you really vote for Jagex when they can't run a single DMM tournament without a major fault?
---
Thank you! First GWD pet, and it’s the best one! (IMO)
---
Rune Dragons is a popular one for multiple accounts, they are super afk if you are in the best gear.
---
That’s what I don’t understand I’m using a completely brand new fresh laptop I bought specifically for RS there shouldn’t be anything compromising. I had an Authenticator, bank pin, 2step verification, there’s no way I should have to make more steps than that to secure my account.
---
Any possibilities of porting osrs mobile to other devices? (Switch in mind)
---
I don’t think you read the comment at all, mate.
---
Not sure. So bad that to get 3 or so kills I burn through a 2-3 ppots and a whole inventory of food.
---
Could another use for the Hydra Tail be added to the game? Currently it's only use is being turned into the bonecrusher necklace, which is a niche item only used for bursting Monkey Madness tunnels.
---
I'd suggest adding the ability to combine it with the Dragon Mace to create a "Hydra's Flail", the Crush equivalent of a Tentacle Whip. 
---
The Flail will also have 10,000 charges, but upon degradation the Tail will be lost instead of the mace.
---
While this would likely boost the tail's value to about 1-2 mil, the tail is currently worth 85k, 1% of the next-most valuable drop on the alchemical hydra's drop table, so I believe that a moderate value boost would be appropriate.
---
Credit to u/PapiDickems for the inspiration on my post last week.
---
Oh fuck. Im ~150 kril no spear. Id lose my shit if i saw this. Im genuinely so sorry mate
---
Thanks man
---
he doesn't, still has hc status at the end in safe place
---
What’s the point of having 3 separate things to secure my account if when one of them fails all of them fail? I did secure my email.
---
Yea deliveritems is an absolutely blessing. Always extremely fast service and if you're camping mobs, you can trade them loot of equal or more trade value.
---
It's completely free, you just cover item costs but if you're known for good donations then you tend to have more volunteers on deliveries ;)
---
What about MEP2?
---
Not OP but i think if you are running with run off and click a new tile you will run there, wanma say I remembee thay from the last QoL thread
---
The wiki is wrong as fuck if it actually says barrows is more gp/hr than zulrah.
---
I watched an interview with the devs or whatever it’s called with them saying they are actually against runelite and don’t appreciate the mechanics it’s offers essentially changing how the game is played. It’s also gives out jagexs codding and it’s own codding is listed which gives any intelligent hacker an easy opening.
---
Motherfuckin relax! At this rate the only gawddamn game u finna be playin is a board game.
---
Yeh it was extremely fast and incredibly dope! I thanked homie and tipped:D. Def will be using alot more often!
---
Really well done! Looks amazing and true to the game :D
---
Orange symbols in Zalcano have a grace period when they first appear so that they don't deal damage, however they still drain energy during this stage, is that intended or something that could possibly be fixed?
---
Nah it's not just high vs. low level Slayer, even low level Slayer with only the basic tasks unlocked is comparable XP/hr on average to 40-min Jad tasks while also giving Melee XP which is more valuable than Ranged XP. I wasn't playing before these updates but I'm guessing that there was a time when Jad tasks were considered good to do, but eventually powercreep with better gear, new areas, more knowledge about efficiency, etc. pushed them out of the meta, but people kept spreading the knowledge that Jad tasks were good despite the fact that they're actually kinda meh, and only a viable option pre-65.
---
The Accuracy is good, but it is still a bit lacking. I think raising the damage from 15% to 20% isn't unreasonable. Even places like Zulrah or Zilyana where it is like a mini-tbow, it is barely better than alternatives while having way more of an upkeep. And while damage isn't the only thing to consider, it generally is more valuable than accuracy and it is kinda bad that a level 70 bow with a set of special degrading armor is worse than a level 50 bow for DPS...
---
It depends on your kills per hr; we assume 20 kills per hour, which is probably quite low for higher level players.
---
That being said, I believe we are working on a way to input kills/hr on our MMGs.
---
Please tell us how the conversation with your boss would go if he saw you looking at this at work.
---
The point I’m trying to make with this post is: why are there all these steps you can make to secure your account, but if one of them fails, they all fail? I get that you see this all the time with this game, but this is not a normal thing in other games.
---
Shit like this only happens to Ironmen. They definitely have higher drop rates for shit
---
On runelite right click the screenshot button and open folder. They should all be there.
---
Idk if you ever pked before, but sometimes people bring dumb things. Just don't go into the wild if you don't wanna be attacked, but that obvious.
---
Working on my quest cape specifically so I can toss all those quest items. Always worried I'll need them for another quest.
---
I'm no mathematician but it looks like you've been hacked there boyo
---
Love the username. Thanks for the account btw.
---
I just started one but I have a main so I'm thinking about just doing a no PVM (bossing) rule since I already have a main. Just focus on grinding everything else out. I almost died to a guard stealing cakes. I dc'ed and was 2 hp when I came back lmao
---
I wear max melee, use my best attack weapon (a whip), DFS and drink an extended antifire and they are easy kills. Super afk as well
---
25mil here. Rip
---
I hope you came to senses and don't play osrs fullscreen anymore
---
Orange spice.
---
Put 3 of em in a stew and drink the spicy stew, praying for a +5 in runecrafting
---
I think locking zulrah behind sote is a bit too drastic but it should definitely be locked behind something.
---
Like other people have said, changing the tier of blowpipe and tbow to say 80 and 90 could be good. I'd suggest lowering the range of the blowpipe to only a couple of squares as well, would make some bosses harder to blowpipe.
---
I have been throwing money at zulrah scales for months, when they're buying for 150 you know something is wrong lol. They can ban the bots any day now :)
---
IIRC, str to 99 first in most cases.
---
Nobody cares about the little tissy you had in game.
---
I’m sorta getting this vibe that you crashed him
---
Eh herb runs aren't that bad. I'm at 6 patches right now and it takes less than 10 minutes because of all the teleports. 
---
But fuck tree runs those things suck
---
Idgaf this ‘Ironman luck’ is real
---
Totally agree locking it behing SOTE and then see what the prices do
---
made the spec 60% cost unless you attach something to it which gives it back its 50%, basically just increasing risk. even with the nerf people will still get dropped with it and come here to make posts whining about pkers

then make it hold more based on diary level:)

In this situatiom youre gonna want to hope you lose. It hoodwinks the karma dieties and they think they're screwing you over by having you win.

---
Why though?
---
Did he try to xlog? I feel like that woulda been his only course of action at that point
---
bruh 200m mining exp........... he chose to torture himself.
---
Support if all skills start at 200m xp
---
The blowpipe was a huge power creep item but with it going unchanged for so long I think the best thing to do at this point is to just let the other combat styles catch up a bit in power creep.
---
As long as the servers don’t turn off then, yes they can die while lagging due to server issues. The game doesn’t just stop. Just imagine the whole thing is being run from a computer somewhere and you’re having connection issues with that computer. To the perspective of the computer there will be no input from you and the game will go on as normal without you, hence you die
---
Now if the servers did go off completely, or there was a problem with whatever is running the game, that could change the situation entirely. If the game stops running then you won’t die but you can’t really tell whether that’s the case or not unless the game has obviously gone down
---
Is it possible to set a hotkey to change it back and forth?
---
Congratulations.
---
There will just be a meta of picking three herbs then running to the bank. Literally no risk when you think about it. People will probably not want to waste that time though and just take like 20-30 ranarrs and get teamed for 200k
---
He was waiting for a sponsor like this before releasing another video,  it's business at the end of the day.

Everyone's saying no, but I actually feel like its not that unreasonable. Volcanic Mine, Tithe Farm, and LMS have all gotten them since OSRS has been out, I don't know why Gauntlet wouldn't.

Whoaaa buddy. Hold our devs to a higher standard? Idk if this'll go over well.
---
I thought you mean RuneScape Classic for a few minutes there lol .
---
I just safespotted blue dragons and brang them to the ectofunctus
---
What's the min gear and stats needed to afk them?
---
Fact is that 20m is easily obtainable in a day and of you have no idea how to make money it can't take longer than a week.. no reason to be that mad. If you were ironman I would understand the anger since items are worth way more than just the GE value.
---
faster, sure. but waste of real money you can use for your future. instead of using the game currency that you already play to pay for it. what about my comment suggested that i said math was hard. i hate people like you who think their way is the best way for anyone and everyone

I support... The blowpipe is practically a end game weapon that can be achieved at a very low level.
---
If not the above, then make the BP 1/10k drop rate :)
---
Spawn at lumby, walk to bank, get house tele, go to water birth, reclaim items where are the other 4
---
Royal seed pod lmaoo
---
You guys have never heard of the gambler’s fallacy. Just because you are “dry” that doesn’t make it more likely that you’ll get a drop. The odds of getting the drop on your next kill never ever ever ever change no matter what your previous luck has been.

Iirc he had like 10 pegs because he was wildly unlucky on prims

My favorite thing Jagex did for pures was the combat calculator rework alongside eoc

One of the best series on YouTube right now along with GridLocked, and OLAAT Musiq is doing something special rn too
---
How bad is inferno if you don’t 1 tick flick? Possible with max gear and fally shield?
---
It's already less fun for real players because it's unbalancing and sinking the economy. Jagex cannot do more about busting bots than they're currently doing, either because they don't have the means or don't care. These suggestions are a step in the right direction.
---
Nice bait

"if you're gonna rock lvl 40 robes you deserve to splash on black dhide"

....mystic top and bottom costs 119k, is not even close to the best magic attack armour. black dhide top and bottom costs 13k and is very close to the best magic def armour. This is a PROBLEM

Sorry but if anyone does fall for these, they deserve it. It’s a life lesson that they can learn from and be a better human being because of it.

Not everyone's emails are as insecure as yours. Some of us didn't get emails til today, and this is the first of its kind for me, saying that my email was changed and not just my password.

Also there is no possible way i can upgrade my gear. My +1 is tent whip, so water staff it is. Not bringing ahrims to multi

I love that you assume I’ve been targeted, unlike you I have not received anything.

You only need to look at reddit to see it constantly being posted..

why is the highest tier defensive item in the game 13k?

why should pkers have to bring mils worth of gear to kill someone wearing 13k dhide?

Lock all content behind bis quests. It’s time.
---
Life lesson was learned I’m killing myself tonight :)
---
yes i can be. It is quite literally the best option for multi, unless I want  to lose an extra 75k every death for ancient staff, just not worth it. My +1 is tent, downgrading it to anything else isnt worth it for the damage i lose. Even if i did, I would have to use a staff of light or dead and hope i dont get ancient maced for it

holy shit i legit boosted for every single rc diary step by bringing 28 ess to the altar eachtime

I didn't know you could just empty the pouches and click on the altar twice

Used to be way more than that closer to release. The price crash of emblems doesn't help the cost, and neither does revs being basically impossible to kill for more than 5 minutes at a time.

Bots did it too, but it's an rng drop after all, so it's not one of the most popular

Venes are tanking a lot of the in-game economy and the actual irl gold value so there are a lot less botters as of late. We're about to reach an all-time low for gold value lol

Here’s one for nearly 4 months ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bjvipr/beware_of_recieving_this_phishing_email/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Personally, I don't mind that it is the best; it is a 2H Shield after all. But it is about how big of a gap there is between it and other options. It is the same level and roughly the same price as a DFS; they should be comparable options but the Bulwark is far better.
---
If the Bulwark didn't exist, I'd likely have used a DFS and Ivandis Flail with the rest of the gear the same, losing around 70 Melee and Ranged Def and increasing my risk by 20K. Or I might use a DFS and SotD, which offers higher Magic defence and a useful spec but still a loss of 70 Melee and Ranged Def and I'd have to downgrade by Fury to a Def (-8 Def) or I'd be risking it.
---
So the part about the Bulwark that is so insane is that it gives +70 Melee and Ranged Def while also being a lower risk. That is a pretty huge stats difference and I can say right now, there were multiple times where I would have died if I were using a DFS instead of a Bulwark. I can't say for sure that the extra 70 Def is what did it, but you know how unlikely it is for a D Claw spec to hit 0 for all 4 hits? Or for a PKer to hit 0 with a Rune Crossbow 5 times in a row... I'm not even 99 Defence.
---
Eat my ass nerd boy

I think the polling system sucks. So many good ideas passed by because it wasn't exactly 75%.

I take 10 tbh. They cost like 100gp each and it removes the chance of ruining a run because you auto-retaliated against a dagg, specced a dagg or the ace chained the supports wrong
---
look into a ryzen 3 chip and maybe an rx570
---
TPC!
---
Whatttt
---
I agree with you that black dhide is the problem. But the problem is cost not balance. Black dhide should absolutely cost more than it does for what it does, but it shouldn't protect from magic any less than it does unless it moves tiers. If you want more magic accuracy you either gotta trade down your +1 or spend more money because in terms of the level difference the dhide is doing its job.
---
With that said I'd love jagex to implement some sort of way that black dhide set becomes 150-200k to at least balance out its utility.
---
