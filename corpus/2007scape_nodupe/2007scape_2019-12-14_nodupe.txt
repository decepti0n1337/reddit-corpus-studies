What if it is?

on the other hand, i've never played civ and know of the glitch because it's commonly memed

Like u/Rattyp00ned said, Runelite(:

When you think she’s trying to give you a tug but  really she’s just trying to log into your account and drop trade your GP you’ve worked your whole existence for:/
---
Can I get a link if this available to the public?
---
It's ok, i bought 8 of them at 115m or so - so profited nicely ;)
---
Bib the rib dib libber sib kib
---
Make sure it was from runelite.net and not .net.jp or whatever, Google ads are often of fake versions at the top
---
How
---
Fucking hell...
---
wheres the link?
---
what application are you going to use this for?
---

---
im assuming it's for like a company
---
You cba until someone ties your record
---
Nice lul
---
Lumbridge isn't far from a bank there's one basically below you
---
I hope this is for something super niche. Otherwise someone’s wasting a lot of money lol
---
You just ignoring the fact that Rendi himself said in his own video that he figured out the glitch and told them...
---
We dont need discord logs to be 'faked' to prove rendi was the badguy lol.
---
it was inside you this whole time champ
---
but it's not stupid a bullshit grind, mining essence doesn't take more than a couple of hours, even piscarilius takes longer. Back when runelite didn't have the library plugin people would just use an excel sheet or even MS paint like I did, it really wasn't THAT bad, books are always in the same places
---
TIL trees have leaves
---
I think what really gets me about this is that this was all technically possible in 2007.  If I am correct nothing this guy uses is based on any changes Jagex has made to the game in OSRS
---
He's probably just abanonded his cart and only made this for the meme
---
I sold my 900$ gaming laptop last month that had a mobile i7 8th gen, 16gb ram, Gtx 1650 mobile and I got 20 fps on fossil island......
---
guess that's why you don't need any other type of bait when fishing for sharks with a harpoon
---
Nice.
---
Agreed
---
Which is factually incorrect. It's okay to be wrong, everyone makes mistakes.
---
&gt;Precisely. Seemingly everyone else has been capable of doing their farming runs without a balloon there for this far since the introduction of the farming guild. 
---
Not sure what you are getting at here? Of course people do farming runs without a balloon there... because there isn't a balloon there...? And if the balloon was added, people would continue to do farm runs. What's your point?
---
&gt;What does this even mean lol
---
Was that not your exact logic? You said that because you can move your house to Taverly to do this, another solution is irrelevant? 
---
&gt;and you are simply asking for ways with lower reqs, fewer clicks, etc. You are literally just asking for the game to be made easier.
---
What? No I'm not? Pretty sure Redwood trees are a higher skill req than moving your house to taverly lol. Also probably more clicks?? 
---
&gt;Theres no issue with suggesting mid level gameplay. There is an issue with suggesting mid level game play that eclipses higher level gameplay.
---
I'd agree, but wait does my suggestion eclipse higher gameplay, or get eclipsed by higher gameplay? You've said both now.
---
&gt;You clearly do. If getting to taverley is such a tedious endeavor for you, then skip that patch instead of asking for the game to be made easier for you. You'll take a decent hit to your xp, but so what? You dont care about efficient play, right?
---
What? If I cared about efficiency I'd just move my house to Taverly. That'd be much faster than taking a balloon, wouldn't it? Like I said, it's not about making anything easier. This suggestion wouldn't increase xp rates by very much at all, and even still it wouldn't be the most efficient method. 
---
And also as I've been mentioning getting to taverly is just a part of it. Teleportation to and from Grand Tree would also be beneficial. It would also help for like mid-run breaks. Forgot seeds or saplings? The balloon would make a great cheap way to pop over to the Farming guild to grab them and get back.
---
He legit said in the video he was gonna do it lol
---
That is a well rounded comment.
---
oof
---
2.5m?!  How did it cost that much?

You can tick eat my attack anytime u want bb
---
I know :(   And axes were called hatchets at one point.
---
Did you just call his comment fat?
---
You can do barrows with these stats
---
I miss those days lol
---
I posted it as a general comment.
---
The answer (if you're too lazy to search for it) is 6.4, so 6.
---
WOOOW bro thank you so much for the tips. I just went for my second kill using all of your advice and i got it in 5:02 it was so much easier clicking the little scorpion with the slayer staff switch. And i took so much less damage with the dragon cbow and antifire. Finished my second kill at 5:02.
---
ardougne
---
A b2b should happen around once in every 120k pets or so. Considering there were only ~25k rockies in the game as of May 2018, still damn impressive
---
This one wasn't exactly b2b, so it might be closer to expected values
---
Best advice
---
well technically isnt it a little more common bc it’s scaled off how much xp you get from an action? It’s probably minuscule but regardless that’s insane luck
---
:(
---
This weapon is about 30% less dps than Twisted Bow on Zulrah mage form, or about 20% less than Blowpipe same enemy. That doesn't really give it a usage for dps as intended. It just raises the max hit of the special attack, useful for last hits of Zulrah and KOing in pvp.  
---
  
---
I propose some sort of alternative. A verac's set effect on a range weapon (ignoring def) could be interesting. Maybe the 2nd arrow is always accurate due to them being volleyed together. The special attack already does this, so it'd fit the weapon.  
---
This would make it about the same dps as BP against Zulrah mage form... Let's now scale this back before it has too many uses... 
---
4.2 seconds on rapid now. 3.6 is too good with this effect.  
---
Well shit now it's still 3x the dps of magic against Zulrah's melee form at low levels. Let's give it doubled accuracy on the 2nd arrow instead of infinite accuracy. 
---
Ok, now it's about 24% worse than magic against that form. That's better.  
---
Basically.. if you have lower than 50% accuracy, this effect gives you 50% extra damage. This makes it 35% better than arma cbow at Zilyana, but 25% worse than twisted bow here.  
---
I believe it would see use for some stuff. But the meta would still be twisted bow or blowpipe in most places. Things you can't spec to lower def, or when your spec fails, might be good uses for this wep.  
---
Another alternative would be: if this first arrow misses, the 2nd arrow has doubled accuracy. Or some variant of this. If the first arrow hits, the second arrow has double accuracy with 50% more damage.. etc.
---
Arab now goblin boy.
---
There isn't a ton of music on zeah. Those would be easy points
---
That's ardy
---
It’s for a company to do animation or video editing really.
---
He said ITS FINE
---
The thing is that you keep calling this a fix, like something is currently broken and it isn't. Training Farming is obviously fine. You keep kind of glazing over the fact that my suggestion is in no way an improvement to most players. You can continue to Tele to your house if that works for you.
---
My suggestion doesn't change the base flow of anything, and that's my point. If anything it's a minor qol improvement. How much resources it takes is irrelevant and Again speculation anyway.
---
Also, can you explain what you mean by spoodfeed the player base? I thought that meant like making things overly easy. Since I've stated multiple times this isn't the case, I assume you used the wrong word?
---
Okay sounds good what about questing? And I bought dragon bones and got protection prayers will I go over 77 from questing
---
Duck yeah!
---
Clean your finger nails dude..
---
Bug hunting is a typically annoying and arduous process, so much so that programmers just give up on the minor ones and call them features. This game is a great example of it with tick manipulation and everything.
---
I think this is actually the pattern for new bis things. Looking at you avernic defender, neitiznot faceguard, primordial boots, etc.
---
You always do questing. Bare minimum you stop at barrows gloves. I'm not sure what diaries you will have access too but I imagine you can get a good amount of then done
---
I always thought it was weird in that troll quest you go through an elaborate ruse to make a fake human for the trolls to eat
---
It’s like, I killed 2 men the second I was in Lumbridge, no one arrested me
---
This one's great. I always feel that exact tinge of remorse whenever I accidentally click that npc.  
---
WHY IS HE JUST STANDING THERE
---
Women are simple, they like shiny and expensive when they're happy. When they're mad they like things you like to break. It's really quite elementary.
---
Unless you're not praying
---
I remember back in I think 07/08 Uaex getting a series of low lvl, think lowest being 40, fire capes. Though insanely good for the era of mechanics/methods/knowledge, just shows how far the knowledge of this game has come.
---
Beautifully done task and video.
---
Still hoping they will add the fuckin ironman logo on names when you right click.
---
Missed it by 2 minutes
---
yeah corp is pretty trash, i dont really think theres too much of an insue in devaluing arcane, spectral/ely are still good. i think that ely should always stay valuable though, ely is what corp is, devaluing arcane would probably make ely rise slightly.
---
wtf are those thighs???
---
k
---
You're* then your*
---
then make it smaller lol it's an example
---
I'd like it
---
wtf are those numbers???
---
I wish jars were cooler man. loool for how rare they are it's so shit. Especially getting dupes of them..ugh. I got like 5 or 6 @ hydra, 3400+ kc and there's just nothin you can do. I at least wish they were untradable so it could at LEAAST be a flex move but bleh ;( 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I feel your pain. also I've no idea the people who do some of these pvm activities on mobile lol. I've never been a phone gamer and I think that might be part of why I CBA to do anything on osrs mobile other than basic skilling shit if I ever do use mobile. Just seem's it would be so frustrating to me not having precise clicks using thumbs. 
---
The fact someone did inferno (I think?) on mobile is fkn insane. Pray flicking on mobile is nuts :O
---
Stop sucking Woox’s cock. Your comment is completely irrelevant to this post.
---
r/runescapegonewild
---
My thoughts exactly, the rewards and lore can be whatever Jagex and the community wants them to be. The mechanics are solid though, and it'd be nice to give mage some limelight.
---
Just what you said sounds perfect and defs buy rigour ASAP. And I would grind out agility before questing.
---
 not just link source, he literally just reposted what someone else posted an hour before him, shame on you
---
You're a good man
---
Right? Over 90 cb level and no fire cape. I choke against Jad every time.
---
How bout the shields actively cost prayer points to use (thinking maybe on par with protect item aka 2 drain, and this can’t be tick manipulated) and reduces pray bonus to 0 but provide added benefits?
---
Makes Ely reduce damage 75% of the time and adds +4 slash, stab, crush, range, mage and +4 melee damage.
---
Adds anti-poison and anti-venom protection to Spectral, prayer drain is reduced to drain 1 (aka in line with rapid restore).
---
 
---
Gives arcane the fucking 4% damage boostboost.
---
&gt;without **any storyline.**
---
&gt;Proceeds to talk about established lore
---
yeahok
---
also i'm interested, where is Nex mentioned in-game in osrs?

because people think that him pointing out the method of server crashing for the dupe caused other people to try crashing the servers, which many people believe caused the lag and mobile connection issues we had the past few weeks.

You could have set your npc attack options to hidden. You could even have set them to right click.

But no. You wanted to maximise your precious “ecks pie” or whatever the kids are calling it these days.

ive had Google pay cancel my sub and refund me 3 times this month. dont know if your issue is related. i ended up just going directly through jagex for my sub.
---
oh i get the meme, i just hate ppl like you steal steal others content without linking it and then having no remorse
---
I need these but in Jojo poses.
---
No the meme is it’s been screenshotted to all hell
---
It wasn’t long ago that we revamped a good 90% of pages to include a lot of information not there, room pages included. The actual built objects also have information on the upgrade materials or full list of required materials to that point. However for your use the room pages work a lot better.
---
Yeah, I know about that and I don't care about it.
---
Literally only asking about poll booths.
---
Just curious, is it worth taking the Multicannon to the Drake slayer task, I am ok with the fact it's only single combat and expense, but does their high defensive stats make this very untenable?
---
Well let me introduce you to heroes' quest.. Where you have to do this again
---
I got 2 of them and I was like wtf is this for? So I dropped them. Sorry pal.
---
All you can do is recover the account. Just need a couple passwords and simple account creation dates and you're sweet
---
Anyone not able to watch it through a minute or two of his context due to the annoying narrator
---
Pretty defensive.. sounds like you botted to make the price go up.. I'm on to you buddy. I'm always watching wazoski.. always watching..
---
Had the same problem, I fixed it by recovering the account to change the email then I was able to disabled the authenticator.
---
Fuck 12
---
Lol id have trolled the shit out of him
---
&gt;That is so odd. I will just go straight through Jagex this time. Thanks for the info!
---
insignificant negative melee, especially on slay task with even a whip but esp with lance. The fact you never get frozen makes up for it on its own. 
---
The def doesn't matter.
---
I don’t know how people find him entertaining. Especially with how he sucks on his mic while talking
---
You say playing RuneScape like it's a bad thing.
---
&gt;  I am wrong.
---
no shit
---
Ouch a walker? Too bad you won’t make it to the anvil until the league is over
---
Aw did I hit a nerve bud? If posting a vid because it's impressive is sucking someone's cock I bet you've swallowed a bunch of them. Go on somewhere neckbeard
---
"we've decided"
---
Wtf are the polls for then?
---
&gt;Workaround for what?? I'm not sure what you think my goal is here? Did you forget about the whole 'I don't care about efficiency' thing? I don't understand how you can go from "You don't care to do things efficiently" to "You are trying to hard to make things over efficient because you are lazy" in one sentence.  It just makes absolutely no sense. 
---
The issue here is you dont want to tele to tav and you expect dev's to bend over backwards to implement a solution catered just for you. 
---
&gt;Yet again I say that even with my idea was implemented, using a cape or moving your house would still be more efficient methods, I'm seriously not trying to change that at all. 
---
It doesn't matter if it's less efficient than teleing to the house portal. It's still a workaround you want implemented specifically cause you dont want to move your house or use redirection tabs. You want an update catered to your specific needs. If you truly dont care about efficiency, you should have no issue with teleing to falador and walking to the patch. 
---
&gt;Just want to add that one more transportation network to the area that I feel is currently lacking in them. It wouldn't make anything easier
---
It makes it easier for players to access the patch while not having to deal with the drawbacks of having a house in taverley. These are choices you're expected to make and consequences you're expected to deal with. 
---
&gt;It wouldn't make anything irrelevant. It would just be an alternative to whatever other method you might use.
---
You want to clutter the game with irrelevant content cause current options dont suit your playstyle. 
---
&gt;No harm. Use it if you want, or not.
---
Use the current options offered to you if you want. Or dont. No harm.
---
FULLLLLLL HOP MEN

Almost a decade at this point.

God?

Im not saying that he does have that info but its possible that he got access to the account via trojan meaning he *could have them

So you've never gotten upset ever? Never said a bad word about anybody that you've regretted?

Don't lie and just admit you rwted all your items and just trying to make it look like you didn't

While it is true that you would cause greater pressure in a small area with the pointed part, that is not what a hammer is intended to be used for. The hammer is intended to crush, not pierce, and it is not balanced for use with the pointy bit. There's a good chance it would graze off instead of actually piercing as all the mass is in the flat part.
---
What would be the incentive for using that spec over the ballista, for instance?
---
O shid what is arcane used for rn
---
🙂
---
Well, he is the king of the king of ass, after all.

Damn bro. 4 extra dollars and I can get 90 days

Only way to answer that is after enough people have tested it to form an opinion. So I say go for it and be one of those people.
---
Christ just imagine a level 9 fcape.

Still ironic to say someone sucks if you couldnt do better. Just because a pro football player is being paid doesnt mean you would do better if you were being paid to do it lmao thats such a bad argument

Amazon employee here. Was that purchased on Amazon? We put those LPN stickers on used items that are sold as new. So basically you are paying full price for an item that was purchased and returned.

I’m kind of jealous. I got 2 bludgeon pieces like 100kc in and have gone dry on every unsired ever since. Like 3x heads and 2 jars. Those pieces are just taunting me in my bank lol
---
Can you explain why you think he's wrong? I remember hearing this exact story from somewhere a few years ago. Gold selling websites would buy stolen card info and buy membership to use for all their bots. They couldn't directly use the stolen card info since it would be easily tracked by the cc companies, so they instead used it for making gp in game and then selling that gp to little kids who stole their parents credit cards. By the time Jagex cancels the membership for the stolen card and banned the account they would have already transferred the gp.

Can't believe some kind soul gave me free tassets! love the community, also ignore me dragon gloves I just got them the other day hahaha

The vengeance thing is true, but like with Storm of Armadyl it was on normal spellbook. This staff would enable people to rag  like Storm of Armadyl. Anyone who finishes a fight gets Tbed, entangled, and the staff DPS is just too much to have a chance to survive.
---
He responded to the level 15 one and basically said he’s very happy it was xzact who broke the record and congratulated him. Wasn’t salty at all

He’s an ex-hc where that didn’t matter, but now it definitely does

lol it only costs a talisman per invo but mud runes would b better than those lavas are best for xp up to 42kish an hr

I dig it.

I can confirm that this is already beaten. Keep your eyes peeled.
---
Only decent early game to get between lumbridge and GE/edgeville. Used to be a decent was to get to champions guild ,but now we have combat bracelet and chronicle. Used to also be good to good deep wild without ancients or lunars without the lever, but the burning amulet and corpoal beast teleport that away so it's really not used.
---
At this rate, you're gonna run out of in game assets to draw. They're too busy counting that $$$$$$.

This is my dad dragging me from the computer when I snuck down to play at 1:30 AM
---
I thought this read every quest in the game and i was gonna be pissed as hell because I’ve been dragging getting my quest cape for a few months now.
---
I think maybe you just can’t read. Holy shit. No where have I ever typed about you being wrong. I’m talking about the commenter of this thread and the guy who replied to him, if you can read you’d see that. 
---
Reading comprehension op
---
Trying to be condescending when you ask a stupid question and get given a rude answer and act like people are calling you wrong! Not everything is about you and the comment chain started talking about homeboy giving you shit
---
Jeez you’re hilarious
---
I wont tell you where I work at. But I'll tell you I work for a certain telecom company. there's plenty of jobs in northern canada that could use some workers in almost every field. Mining, tech, construction, government. The pay is good, but the cost of living gets higher the higher north you go
---
dagon hai for example
---
I did it on a 63 iron account, I believe in you
---
Because he's part of the problem?
---
Jagex should perm any new accounts he tries to make/make content on. But instead they went soft because he's a content creator.
---
Imagine playing by the rules.
---
I did it in 2016. If it was too slow than jagex could have multiplied the favor gain rate by for example 5.
---
It funny
---
Kempq still be figuring out how to get 19 combat firecape
---
They have nerfed that shit into the ground since then.
---
What’s the source in this case?
---
Ok
---
Just finished Western Provinces elite diary today, is there any advantage in going to Steve over Duradel for sayer assignments?
---
I liked the community feel before GE, felt more like a world everyone shared instead of feeling like a singleplayer game now

Jagex doesn't do that to anyone unless you're a hardcore abuser.

Go to oldschool.runescape.com and see if there’s a double xp announcement.

In general you should never trust ads on Facebook/Twitter. Oddly enough, Instagram seems to have the best ads out of any “social media” platform
---
So get a strength cape in a few days, completely for free, and have it tele right in front of a banking booth of the Warrior's Guild?
---
You'd make OSRS even more ezscape than RS3 where at least you need a max cape to tele right in front of a bank booth.
---
Its okay officers, she's 800 years old

GG! Btw or regular?

This pains me as I had similar, but opposite, luck! In my first 150 Rex kills, I got 5 Warriors, 2 platebodies and 1 d axe. Took me ~500 kills to get my Zerker...

Can you get a Pic of their combat level? Found them on hiscores and they have 1 jad kc

Ahaha I have too many vids of my brother that would fit the bill, but he doesn’t want me to put them up...

It was more of a joke that he bought into the double exp weekend. I definitely wasn’t trying to bash his intelligence! Haha

better yet remove like 25% of the worlds. sub 400 population worlds are a waste of time. competition is healthy.

30 minute videos really push the attention span of some people.
---
I love long videos, not just rendi's. But even his go in too long sometimes and i always end up doing something else while the video plays because a lot of it is just filler when they're that long.
---
Rendi could easily get his point across and tell a story in 15-20 minutes but he chooses not to for some reason. Quantity over quality I guess.

Next week: Level 3 with firecape spotted on w330 GE.
---
Not sure what you mean, are you saying people would lure by standing in multi hoping that you melee spec them and teleport from single into multi combat, then get piled? If that's the case maybe it could prevent teleporting if you are in singles and the opponent is in multi.
---
jacked as fuck glutes
---
I think he'd gain a lot more popularity if he made them 12 or so minutes long, that seems to be the sweet spot for rs videos.
---
People see a 30 minute long rs video and pass because that's a long video to commit to.
---
Yes since they are maxed xp, no one can pass them unless a new skill is released. Same with 200m skills once you get max xp in a skill you are locked in that position forever
---
I transcribed it by listening to the actual song in-game (OSRS version).
---
There is no missing semi-quaver on the third bar (I assume you are referring to the third bar, the first bar is not pictured).
---
I suggest listening to it again, the mistake happens during the second half of the third bar at 0:07.
---
Maybe you did haha
---
Tbh my main miney maker rn is hopping worlds to find iron men doing corp and I crash them once they start the fight. I don't have the best gear but anybody doing prep before corp is an obvious iron man which is a free crash, and easy clean up thanks to their prep.
---
Cool story.
---
I can adapt and I am not a jerk to everyone who has reciprocity, how would I know?
---
I have a lot of private runners now who respond super nicely and get a great expected pay worth 9M\h their time. I'm thankful to have them and hope its mutual.
---
The fact is every player that knows about deliveritems cc would expect the cc to solve that need of someone demanding resupplies for real and consistently, but the lack of mutual benefit at all simply doest work, there is no incentive and going to what really happens, things doesn't get done. Everyone knows that.
---
But some are dense..
---
I really just have good luck. Gnome scarf after maybe 25 rounds, mole slippers after 13 beginner clues; I’ll send a little magic your way!
---
You tele to the enemy. Not the other way around.
---
back in the days when things like the word "German" and the phrase "add 1k" (similarity to "a d1k" is the only thing I can think of with that one) would be censored but "buttfucker" got around the filter
---
The trick is to click one tile behind them and then immediately click on sire to attack him. I've done about 1.3k kills on my mobile only btw ironman btwso if you've got any questions feel free to ask :) (also only 1 bludg piece fml)
---
100% this is Kempq. I saw Kempq talking about how he was gonna shock the world with a 9 combat cape on his discord
---
congrats man, how did you like fighting galvek?
---
why do you have 2840 harpoons when you are catching lobsters
---
How about authenticator, cooks assistant and a small total level?
---
rat distracted me got me flustered
---
This happened a few years back as well, resulting in several people getting the cape at 3 combat.
---
1: Sarachnis is weak to crush so best Crush bonus you can afford 
---
2: once you learn to flick properly (won’t take long) you won’t take any damage from sarachnis at all so you just want the best magic defense to minimize food usage from the mage spider that spawns + general defense for the melee spider
---
No he'll still go ahead and buy a blowpipe. He just has to sell his gp for membership first. Two blowpipes get bought, he just has to increase his farming practices.
---
Working hard or hardy working?..

So a goddam rat gets a party hat but not my Callisto cub (who’s been a very good boy this year)

Why are you saying some guy is streaming it like you don't know who he is. You spammed your shit ass Twitch link in every damn Discord and your Discord name is Snapshot.

Nice! What is your range level? Mine is 78

The medium you used is really nice, love the background, doing her eyes like that was a good decision too

But why did you put the skull directly under her when she’s in that position? Looks like she’s shitting out a skull

The runecrafting vs prayer rank is perfect.

I don't think that's available anymore, since a lot of bot users were abusing it for free membership.

Not even level 9 smh

Needs to be fixed brother, needs to be fixed

There’s a REALLY detailed “fastest barrows gloves” guide out there that will get you to the point of basically training NMZ etc

I followed it on an account I built and it made it way better

Whatta god

400 iq predictions in art form, bravo
---
had the same haha, just whistle
---
Oh I got it!
---
There should be fix where you can't be attacked by a different person in single-way combat until you've been out of combat for at least 30 seconds,NPC agro in the wilderness should be turned off, then ban boxing for escapes like they did in DMM. After all that Jagex needs to limit access to the wilderness to 30 worlds. If all these were implemented at the same time the wilderness would be a much more enjoyable to be in.
---
lel beaten in 4 hours. Rendi dont mess around yall know what im saying
---
He sounds like he's reading a script tho. If people do that at least sound natural and not like a 7th grader reading aloud in class
---
Trying to work through what he did. 
---
Looks like Dwarf Cannon based on his 750 crafting XP, then he used the cannon to finish off a monster gaining 16 range xp in the process. 
---
Anyone else have any pieces of the puzzle?
---
Congratulations on submitting! That final leg is a real beast. PhD?
---
It be nice
---
Gratz man, did you learn to run the head? If so from where?
---
Be very cool if all pets could get an animation. As for the rest, no sorry.
---
Isn't tutorial island xp wiped after you leave?
---
Learn how to get the 4:1 set from any part of the attack cycle. If you arent sure how to 4:1 id watch synq solo raids guide, he explains it well.
---
Did you even watch his fucking vid? They didn't want to glitch with him, so he act like he chose to leave lol
---
 ban for what reason?
---
16 range xp from tutorial island probably
---
But I detest Farming, though. How much do I detest Farming? My Farming is 23. My Runecrafting is 68.

Hi it’s me your boss. Meet me in my office first thing tomorrow.

Good for him, hope he's having fun

This is getting ridiculous

Wonder if he's going to do a look video like the usual, or make a concise one like xzact.
---
Comment
---
You realize Rendi was willing to let the RS economy suffer with a dupe bug all for the sake of having a new *Lower the Better* video, yes? People vehemently despise him for a reason.
---
Kemp posted on discord that he was about to show the reddit bitches who constantly mock him. This is definitely him.
---
[See other comment.](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/eafzoj/found_a_level_9_with_firecape_at_w302_ge_called/faru4x4/)

Xzact confirmed it's Rendi
---
Bug abuse.
---
Guilty why? Not like I killed him
---
it's a raccoon. trash panda is such an offensive and misleading term
---
Thanks :)
---
Bounty hunter doesn't have the same mechanics in singles wildy as a normal world.
---
This is deep. It's a 3 layered joke. Firstly it's assuming that periods don't hurt or cause trouble; way least not much. Secondly it's saying that typing the pin is a much greater deal than a period. Thirdly, it's saying that women don't play RuneScape haha
---
Didn't he use it to remove some XP from accounts when doing quests like priest in peril?
---
Seems quite a shortsighted  take. The 10k is opting for quick cash but is it worth tanking your reputation an impacting your future as a content creator for? maybe but it's not as simple as  'just rwt bro 4Head'
---
Blessed by the chest
---
What's the original NBA meme?
---
Jajajajajajaja
---
This post didn’t age well.
---
“Skip Th3 Gym” is in reference to “Skip The Gym” a player who gained notoriety 4-5 years back for losing a bunch of money at the DA. 
---
It would be really really surprising if a Vene knew about that specific player, as their fame only lasted 15 mins and then they never had another post/vid about them after 2015. 
---
On another note, witch hunting goes against sub rules. Which is when you accuse someone of botting/rwting etc with no concrete proof. You’re fine to include RL stat pics, just blur the username.
---
Does that bug require 16 construction? Bc if so I think you've solved it.
---
hiscores dont show low level attacks though, xzacts 14 cb chestbrug also shows no attack lvl on hiscores
---
 Yeh as I mentioned, reported in game and sent in video evidence of me making the bot glitch in game. Still not banned, dudes literally within rank 100 (4-5k kc) at barrows. That's basically 400-500mil barrows loot in runes and items all without getting banned. I love barrows and I'm within the top 100th as well so it's just depressing to see a bot like that running free.
---
is there anywhere I could read more about this bug?
---
you should see what bad dragon makes then
---
Won’t change anything
---
Mfw it takes a higher combat level to beat basilisk knights than Jad.
---
This aged pretty well
---
Well it was meant to be a fusion of dwh/elder/bandos hilt and vissage, so it's meant to crush. This is just a concept of a specific thing, the idea was to make more variants for different weapons so the future of powercreep looks like this instead of new stuff killing old stuff/weird niche restricted things.
---
You either played basically like an ironman, handled the aids that was falador park, or used external sites to find rare items
---
I personally was more of an ironman because wasn't going to deal with other people
---
"2 years"  
---
weakness disgusts me, people who played less than 5 years disgusts me even more
---
You are a sheep

Surely you can trace where the money goes from these accounts though right?

Yeah, I ran some quick scans with Malwarebytes. I had only 1mil, but it was my first 1mil that I got yesterday, so that's a bit sad, but anyway - now I'll know :)

Most likely he was doing it after the lvl 16 went out.
---
Yep. Just got disconnected and can't log back in.

If you're suggesting easy access to ingame money isnt p2w, idk what to tell you.
---
There are multiple skills where all that matters is throwing money at them.
---
as funny as this is, i got a friend to play osrs about a year or so ago, he legit died to that tree.
---
CHESTBRAH
---
I know but his switches are bad L2PK
---
This is all very exciting.
---
Lol maybe it remembered all cell towers in your cities in Norway but in Scotland you had to authenticate since you werent there long
---
It’s Rendi, he posted about this on twitter. Video coming in the upcoming days! (Got the cape on the 13rd of Dec)
---
Not to make you feel bad but I got 3 from my first iron task, that is indeed, insanely unlucky. Soon mate, soon.
---
Same, except I was on the ZMI world. Reassuring to know it isn't just me.
---
Same here, a bunch of the german worlds are at 0 players
---
Gap closing is a utility spec, but for pvp. Having it restore prayer points would devalue SGS, and the new staff coming into the game is going to have an orb that restores prayer as well.
---
 Most new items in the game always follow the same overused concepts: 
---
* items that deal more damage
---
* items that prevent damage from being taken
---
* items that drain or restore stats/prayer
---
What I am suggesting is a utility that helps make the pking meta new and exciting, without the item being overpowered, and using tourney worlds to get feedback on whether or not it's something players would want.
---
Yea, same thing just happened to me.
---
yeah me too, gonna miss those drops :(
---
Yes, servers shit the bed
---
Snap, Disconnected at hydra, now unable to log back in, same message as you, tried different worlds.
---
yep gg
---
i have seen 10+ people come in and get limbs. had one guy let 3 dissapear just to rub it in... its a 1/16 drop, 1/26 from irons...
---
Same problem, on w303 so seems to be across all servers
---
Same. Porbably dead because of this. ffs Jagex. You are a bunch of  incompetent fools
---
I think people still wouldn't use it outside of baiting or for a single youtube video. Dds would still be a better spec weapon, and it's way cheaper. And with dds you can use a decent mainhand like a tent whip. When you mainhand a spec weapon people just safe so it kind of defeats the purpose.
---
My gf has had her work placement in scotland so I've accumulated many months there, definitely re-authenticated the same places multiple times.
---
oh damn rip, i was luckily just afk fishing.
---
Record held for like 20 hours. New record 9 cb lmaoooooooo
---
Hi, 
---
I tried to login on mobile, but it asks for authenticator even though I have it disabled, so I downloaded the authenticator and when I enter the code it says "Invalid credentials, for all accounts created after 24th November blah blah". I tried enabling the authenticator, but same message when I enter the code. I disabled the authenticator again and same message, it still asks me for the code. 
---
Does anyone have any idea how to fix it?
---
Thanks
---
Uppdate, im logged in and standing in fally
---
Do you need to hit a one to poison, since he used neither attack or strength, making him hit more zeros?
---
Same here. It seems like it's only German worlds.
---
Im wondering what's going on.
---
try logging in to rs3 then back to osrs i just got my acc unstuck like this hoewer im not sure if it was that or they just fixed it
---
i tried uk worlds too and that didnt work but im in now again.
---
Yeah, can't log in on EU servers. I was able to log in on a US server though.
---
Yea. Was just able to log in again.
---
No this is real. It’s nuts
---
Also, judging by comments he makes on twitter and his videos, he's a lot more salty about reddit's hatred of him than about Xzact beating his record.
---
Anyways, xzact could still one-up this with 40 prayer.
---
its only 100k death, its all good, im not a hardcore and cause i died there, my stuff is safe
---
Was this why I dc'd during the fight with bitch ass glough?
---
We just don’t use Authenticator
---
But do you need to hit a 1 to apply the poison, since he used defensive style and not attack or strength, meaning more zeros were hit?
---
The flair flew over your head didn't it?
---
Walk the entire time and ctrl click to run to dodge only when he fireballs
---
Have a slayer staff with autocast crumble undead in your inv so you dont have to switch away from your inventory.
---
Add eagle eye (or rigour) to your quick prayers along with protection for 1 click management
---
Click your hp when it turns green to cure venom without looking at your inv
---
To be fair I’ve heard girls call other girls those things as well for some reason...
---
Yea the same is happenning to me. I’m in England for three months now and I too have to reauthenticate in the same areas sometimes. My best guess is that the cell towers don’t have static IP addresses (they change daily or something) and that is why it doesn’t remember. Maybe they are static in Finland and not static in Scotland
---
So true
---
I don’t understand what I just watched lol
---
You replied to yourself lmfao
---
r/woooosh
---
"For now"
---
220vs350k(assuming i remember to pray melee &gt;.&lt;)/hr with max minus inferno cape and with dh having devout boots and ardy cape.  Having only 2/5 of your possible damage rolls resulting in a 1hit with rapier makes it slower than a slightly less accurate weapon that 1hits on like 3.8/5 of your possible damage rolls.  There definitely are kills where both weapons just splash to shit and take over 15 seconds, in which the rapier seemed to suffer less.  Dh regularly 1hits 5+ in a row, rapier was most commonly 2 hitting, with 2-3 in a row 1hits.  The atkspeed is mitigated by being completely irrelevant in any 1hit case, as the windup speed is spent reanimating a new head.
---
I'll admit it was just a troll idea I wanted to try out, so I sympathize with doubt 100%.
---
If he got this without some form of bug abuse I am gonna be mind blown.
---
Just got 98 :) almost there to my first non combat 99, still no pet though :'(
---
Why would he get 5 defence and 43 prayer then?
---
Just to add on to this. Only way it changes is if an account is banned which will remove them from the highscores
---
F
---
This post does not get an exception, i will remain true to my purpose
---
if anyone get's the "already logged try later" bug try opening your cmd (windows users) and write a command "ipconfig /flushdns" it wrked for me
---
Thanks Peter
---
Live in Israel and I only authenticate once a month as well.
---
I meant that if I also went after castle wars helms then we'd have to hunt down EVERY helmet ahaha

Ah yes, my favorite. 48-48 dds specs at the speed of knives. I can see it now, basically 2 dclaws in each hand.

---
Looking at your Reddit name, your the real deal
---
because of how long these things take, that means rendi was in the caves in the middle of getting his cape when xzact got the 14cb cape lol
---
Xzact on suicide watch
---
This has been done before so I doubt Rendi would do it now and make a big scene over it. Also, if he were to do it this way, he'd get it on a level 3 not level 9.
---
was at zalcano and 3 venezualians hopped to our world and crashed us cause their worlds went down
---
You can tell from the bowstrings being available
---
Welcome to the conversation enjoy your stay!
---
amateurs. i cut magic trees on 200 accounts at once
---
Those worlds are just not popular.
---
Been trash the last week. Can’t do ZMI, or any player heavy activity without crashing on mobile
---
Weird flex but nice.
---
You're trying your best to move the goalposts. First of all, your assumption about the purpose of the game and its design is fiction you just pulled out of your ass.
---
Rsc had a duel right click on other players. A PvP function was straight up integrated into the menu system.
---
Mocking the PvP whole staunchly touting the pvm in the game as more engaging is impressively ironic and lacks a fiber of self awareness.
---
I know what a MUD is, and I'm happy for you that you're proud enough of your acronym knowledge that you tried to use it as some indicator of superiority.
---
You don't have to try to rewrite history in order to justify a dislike of PvP. You just don't know enough about what you're talking about to provide any kind of valuable input, and that's super annoying when you present your thoughts with a high level of confidence.
---
No.
---
It was cool to hate on Rendi 2 days ago. Come on man you’re totally behind on your Reddit circlejerks. 
---
For real though this sub can be really shitty to people for no reason so Rendi can say whatever the fuck he wants about us we totally deserve it.
---
Jagex confirmed last week they were under some sort of attack on the servers. Merry shitmas
---
I've seen people say that this was done through a bug abuse? Something about a PAFTA? (not sure if that's the actual acronym) It's forced entry into a instance with some bug in a POH. Is this correct?
---
The game isn't always rendering the visible dancer's partner, so I'm guessing that since technically the dance is just walking in a triangle the game just displays him doing just that.  Once his partner is in render distance, he begins following him, and the partner enters while following, only to transition to walking through the corner of the triangle as his partner leaves render distance.
---
Having only 1 corner in render distance, the game just spawns them, then despawns them as they enter and leave for that 1 tick.  I think their random directions there are just PID variations changing what direction they look at as their follow action is interrupted, like when you use an item on someone or trade with someone when your path is not a straight NS or EW line.
---
Good job! The fleet sequence and Galvek fight are awesome, hope you had fun. Enjoy your new cape!
---
If you read my other comment, you would see that it depends on your mobile provider
---
If they have static IP you are remembered for a month but the cell towers ip could change if it is not static
---
Also if you login in the car or something or in the towb centre you would have to auth since it is not the same tower, you have to authenticate again
---
&gt;Did they say it won't be instanced
---
yes, only a portal for ironmemes and that's it.
---
Socialism has never been introduced en masse, it sees smaller introductions of socialist policies of which some garner their success from capitalism and its associated socioeconomics. After enough socialist policies are introduced the state **could** become dependent on them, that is my main concern.
---
I wouldn't say it's as farfetched as claiming another person is fascist, I agree some elements of socialism are good but fascism is inexcusable. Sort of two ends of the spectrum, but I get your point.
---
Two quick examples, I would consider Richard Barnbrook and Nick Griffin right wing politicians, within the UK.
---
You're going to feel silly for being wrong with that level of confidence.
---
Did you check remember me? Lol
---
Did you try just getting it?
---
I was going for Addy, but then I realized my main game was missing out on xp so I stopped after I hit T4 relic. I think I'm sitting in mithril now

*Mind Blown*

Viva Mexico!

Yes brother.... come on now

---
Very wrong.
---
I'm not 100% certain if I can find it (but I'll try), but it was a guy saying that his account had been hacked for a large amount of wealth and that he needed it locked before the hacker managed to remove his bank pin I believe? One of the responses on the thread (I think to the thread itself, but it might have been someones comment) was "I'm in his clan it's 100% serious"
---
It became a meme on reddit for a while afterwards, and is occasionally still used.
---
20 gp says he did it all using ranged since ranged lvls you up slower than melee
---
Tbow is average at arma, when it hits it can hit big but not very consistent, the trip before this one, rigour with divine range pot i hit five-six zeros in a row, black chins are way more efficient for long trips. I would have been fine if not for this world, and also pretty much 15-30 other worlds crashing. Wrong place wrong time I guess but  wow its just so frustrating after putting in 3 hours of tick manipulation chin hunting to lose all of it because the server go down

shame Jagex didn't ban that 10 hp ironman pk account as well... the hypocrite deserved to have all his accounts banned, if he wasn't a streamer Jagex would have banned them all without batting an eye
---
It's more 1. the sheer number of posts that happen and 2. the fact that they never have any sort of substance and most of them literally just feel like karma whoring. Counter point to the "solutions that Jagex are supposed to come up with": how do we know they *aren't* trying to come up with solutions? Most companies aren't nearly as transparent as Jagex, as unpopular as that statement is. I played League of Legends for 8 years (until I rediscovered osrs, bless), and Riot Games is worth a fuckton more than Jagex. They hardly posted shit about anything, and hearing direct replies from employees on Twitter like Mod Ash for example was unheard of.
---
So yeah; fair enough to say that it's their job to come up with solutions. But we're not in their team meetings.
---
Who the hell are you?
---
Gzz!
---
You still haven't provided proof.
---
And again, how is he to blame for something they were going to do regardless of him making a video on it?
---
It’s pretty good if you have two DPSers with you so they can drop graardor quick then just change to mage.
---
Sorry man, dont anticipate going much further in life than your mother's basement. Your attitude is totally unrealistic, and nobody in the real world would tolerate you.
---
Take care :)

You have no clue what's going on do you?

A week or 2 ago Rendi posted a video about how people found a way to dupe gp. When the servers crash, your char vars are set back back by 15 mins. However other actions like trades are saved as well. So if you trade 1b to someone and in the next 15 minutes the server crashes, you get set back to the point where you still had your bill and the other person as well BUT he would also have the bill since it was registered as well. Effectively doubling the money.
---
Since then, the servers are under constant DDOS attacks from people attempting to get them to crash so they can dupe money.
---
The only thinf jagex needs at this point is decent DDOS protection software. But it seems the corporate overlords simply dont want to drop the money.
---
Not sure, but I think it's better to have a veteran explain the progression. He may not be too involved in OSRS.
---
Not really sure how a scythe or tbow kind of weapon against players makes any sense here. The worst weapon to ever come to the game was the blowpipe. It was the only weapon ever nerfed for only pvp, and stayed the same in pvm. Yes the ballista was nerfed for pvp but the stat changes also took effect outside of the wilderness, and it is a weapon basically only useful in pvp. Both the ballista and the blowpipe are still VERY strong with elite void and rigour in pvp. Scythe is a multi hit weapon for big bosses, and tbow just scales on magic level both are very niche use even in pvm.
---
I think you mean irony. Keep importing third world savages bwana, just stay on your side of the pond
---
That's impressive as hell but this dude really just exploits everything he can in the game kinda ruins it
---
I have no problems with the people who matter. Retail workers who can't even make a burger menu at mcdonals right have no place complaining about people being entitled when they can't even do the simplest jobs correctly.
---
It definitely doesn't sound like you made these terms up on the fly.
---
what rings u got bithc
---
It sounds completely legit to me. That is the kinda thing you have to do to really make the mechanics your bitch.
---
As someone who does, I can’t either. The whole paragraph sounds like memes I text my friends who play this game 😂
---
I thought this was common knowledge lol
---
KempQ didn’t discover that lol. He just made a video about it.
---
Seems no one else agreed.... *Sad noises*

How else do you think he was right there when they were crashing worlds? If he was gonna video it why would they let him see what they were doing and expose them??

I hope jmods don't look at this and go "huh...let's make Jad harder".
---
Hopefully they remember that the Inferno is a thing...
---
Yes hence his 16 construction iirc
---
Im also looking to start raiding cox a bunch as well. Cmb 118 stats are 96/99/85 99 hp/99 range/95 mage. Got elite void and BiS range/melee gear with lance/dwh etc, can buy BiS mage if needed too but id prob start with usinf elite. Ive done Cox before but really would like to do it a lot more. 90 herb as well for overloads. Getting tired of farming hydra (3500+ kc) since my rng is absolute shite :( 
---
Ill hop in the disc when im home ! Look forward to others who enjoy anime too :)
---
OSRS had over 4 days of server issues recently with very little said about why, and no compensation. And judging from posts on this sub as of less than an hour ago, it's happening again.
---
pls do more rs art &lt;3
---
xzact trained attack, which is .33 cb per lvl. while defense is only .25cb per level
---
does *everyone* think it makes sense if it passed the poll? Or just a small selection of opinions you've seen?
---
He literally said in his video that he personally discovered the method and approached bot farmers with it to try to get Bgloves without the Xp Gain.
---
Oh btw. GG
---
The last time I did the fight caves, I ended up using the revive from the karamja elite diary. Which almost didn't help at all, because I didn't know it was a thing so I saw myself get killed and started to lean back since I thought I was done before I realized what had happened. Then I got the pet on that run, because of course it comes on the worst Jad kill possible.
---
If it's a basic necessity why doesn't half the planet have clean drinking water?
---
Yeah.. but you don't matter unless you've experienced it from the bottom up.
---
Would it not be annoying to have a boss that's never worked your position (IN RETAIL ONLY).
---
I'm currently studying computer IT and that absolutely would not happen in that field lol, but retail is completely different. 
---
You're an alpha weeaboo, we get it.
---
he did a bill cosby
---
Unknown url scheme?
---
Tricked ya bitch - the casket is a mimic and we fight till one of us dies xD
---
That thing
---
again, did you put in a combat style underneath 'weapon'?
---
Rendi is such a dick for immediately ruining that other mans career 😂
---
Woah this is great! Thanks :) 
---
Are there no other reasonable options that compete?
---
Your dark soul
---
"Obviously recoils, tic eating etc are into play here but I highly doubt he achieved this by not abusing some kind of bug." Are you sure you aren't accusing him?
---
If your looking for a show similar but not really comedy I’d check out Halt and Catch Fire.
---
I dunno why it doesn’t work my friend but imma do anything to help solve the issue.
---
Yeah, ofcourse this doesn’t take into account how much you enjoy doing each activity.
---
Yes they do, how would you can the account that transfer gold into (for example) to a lvl 3 account and sell it from that acc, if they catch u doing RWT they need to ban all the accounts on you IP, since they can't know which account are you using for it
---
loaep
---
Actually it would, when you go staking you don't just do one stake, you do multiple and if a tax is going to cut into my profits I'll find other means to gamble my GP.  I mean I guess if jagex's goal is to lose customers that isn't a bad idea.  I haven't met a single person that just buys gold to stake, when people refer to RWTers at the duel arena I'm pretty sure they were referring to odds stakers which are pretty much extinct right now as is.  Its crazy how much Reddit seems to know about the duel arena and who is RWTing there and how they're doing it and why they're doing it when they've never once been there themselves and aren't a part of the staking community.
---
im ashamed u even know why would u even read it goes straight on my ignore lis
---
Magic dps has been buffed 25% with a single update. With an item carriable to pvp, able to be the +1, and only requiring 2m risk (occult/tome) to be min-maxed for barely any risk (2m is nothing really).
---
It is incredibly op, if you didnt know. hitting 44s with magic at whip speed is just stupid, at 2m risk!
---
I mean when you can have a stack of 200 clues, getting an item isn't really that hard. You understand your chances are way higher and aren't too torn up about it not being on your mainscape acc
---
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
---
OH WOW
---
ensouleds are still fine thought, way omre stress-less/skill based
---
Had the same issue last night,on mobile tho. Wanted to make a flip and couldn't reconnect after the buy order was complete, and now the item sank xD. What i am trying to say here... Dont flip high volume items on your phone.
---
I was really interested in his 75 hp only for ros fire cape strategy, but he abandoned it for a lower level strategy anyways.
---
It will only ever go down as it's consumed once per player and that's the end of it. Limited demand.
---
With that being said it's the single greatest account upgrade you can buy at any price.
---
does first to get it at lvl 3 wins?
---
I am definitely slowly working my way up to it. Any advice for people who haven't completed it?
---
yeah now that the level 9 combat cape is out I can't ever play this ruined game again
---
Lolol.
---
It's a different pmod.
---
They banned all of a friends accounts. Little different situation, but all of his irons that were banned didn’t accept the RWT’d gold. 
---
I think it’s really a case by case basis.
---
Needed for the paft glitch
---
maybe is also possible with 40 prayer
---
i am 50/50 paft or poison
---
They don't look into it that much of you aren't someone popular. I used to bot and buy a gold on a lvl 3 and trade it to my main, the level 3 would get banned eventually but they never touched the main
---
That's class.
---
50-50:)
---
Not as intense as the American Dad Intro speedruns
---
Both considered heraldic, unless you're doing a clue
---
Legend has it he's still theorising the fabled 19 combat Fire Cape
---
Runescape should make an autograph book you hand over a book page to someone they get to sketch their autograph n u can put t in your book
---
I saw you at ge and I smiled pls compliment me
---
Chad
---
Tbh I'm surprised RS3 doesn't already have this. They seem to have everything cosmetic related.
---
Trimming bandos tassets trade me!
---
kurask isn't a boss and shouldn't be included in a room like that
---
I think someone is just salty that a cb lvl 9 can get a fire cape but he can't get one at 100+ cb tsk tsk
---
shoulda looked up a name swapping guide. RIP 5 bonds
---
Yes but if it's the one I'm thinking of, it involves a cannon hitting on the spawn frame of the enemy.
---
The cannon part might not be necessary, I don't know, but I believe it's something to do with the way it moves that makes it work.
---
Edit: There's one other method I know about that Bea was using to train Slayer that involved letting an Iron Man do all but 1 point of damage and killing with a Ring of Recoil.  Iron gets no credit since another player did damage, so Slayer XP defaults to last hit in that case.
---
Hahahaha
---
Anguish. Suffering is QoL
---
If you use noted Recoils on a Ring of Suffering, it resets the recoil you currently have equipped. Could be another way he did it.
---
If he did either of these methods though, then X still owns the record at 14cmbt.
---
Im ashamed u even know Why would u even read it Goes straight on My ignore list
---
Just wondering, why deposit your equipment when mining if you have endless run gang?
---
It’s your opinion tho.
---
They are controlled by actual people, I’ve talked with someone running the bots before.
---
I mean the guy has shown every other fc attempt thus far. So why would he even show us if he knew he’d get banned?
---
He's still got a Rocky in the next Leagues server
---
Oh yup you got me
---
Yeah and people don't understand DDOS attacks themselves it seems. 1. Even large companies like EA and Riot have sustained DDOS attacks that they can't immediantly fix. Compare the size of Jagex and it's obvious this won't be solved immediately. 2. It's much easier for the attacker than it is for the defender.
---
Not with poison
---
And just a side note, how did exposing that dupe bug help the community in any way? It allowed people to attempt it themselves and crash the servers which you all complained about last week.  It did nothing but harm the community
---
Please stop reposting this
---
You're right, I meant all the mounted heads :P
---
Can’t keep servers running on $11/month
---
Nice for vasa :D
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/sections/202644985-Support-Stats
---
Each 6 day intervals have almost 500k bots banned. Thats an obscene number and clearly they are coming in faster than they can be handled. But an effort is clearly being made, because imagine if 500k *extra* bots where active a week. The game would be unplayable. 
---
The game is only alive right now because they ban so many bots, you just don't realize it, because the game is playable.
---
I love this art style! Do you have more work
---
Great paragraph except you didn't answer the question at all. Because the answer is nothing, that has nothing to do with this.
---
100%, go test it.
---
Give us a full statement when all these neets stop making posts about the crashes
---
I'm not entirely sure how poison comes into play but you can roll a hit and still roll a 0. I assume a hit can poison even if its 0.
---
Sorry I’m out eating breakfast with my wife
---
Yes, I received also like 3 of them past week and I don't even have my accounts anymore.
---
:Y even share this is NGL:
---
“People are better than me so I can’t appreciate their achievements”
---
I didn't really complain about the dead servers last week. It happens in MMOs all the time. The crashes in 2015 were much worse.
---
He shook his head too much now it hurts.
---
People also forget that the man literally has shown dozens of game mechanics that aren’t intended for that use (and jagex has fixed many of the mechanics because he uncovered them), but since there’s a lower cb lvl competition going on everyone just picks and side and accuses the other one of bug abuse.
---
Aged like already aged milk.
---
Where is his post about the 9cb?
---
You just request a permanent change.
---
Same with mlm
---
But what I said showed that he doesn’t have the authenticity that you think he does.  He lied in that video and He’s always been shady so I’m assuming this fire cape was also done with methods not falling under the current rules of the game
---
Tactical nuke
---
Dupe?
---
The account whose sole reason for existence is to rush people.
---
Literally the scummiest thing possible.
---
He's not wrong about it being very different, but I honestly think you could take off with your style.  It's a bold contrast to the 1080+p supercrisp digital art that's usually upvoted here.  This already has like low average upvotes for a good chunk of those so it's definitely not the sub rejecting your style.  Try another popular npc or two and maybe a random location or npc nobody pays attention to, like the bonfire north of the hunter symbol west of mount quidamortem(raids1) or the men wandering the catacombs.  Upvotes aren't everything, either.  They just tell you how good your timing was.
---
"Sealing the record"  
---
This post aged well...1 day later XD
---
I know :(
---
Then again rs3 pohs are pretty outdated and not as useful or visited as osrs. We instead have a more detailed pet interface I guess, with examines. I guess that’s the best way to show off bosses on rs3 🤷‍♀️
---
It was pretty obvious satire lmao
---
350 chins in 3 hours with tick manipulation? Sorry but I'm not buying it.
---
Thanks Grace, very cool!
---
You mistake me. I'm not hating on him at all. I'm laughing that Jagex are definitely waiting for his vid as eagerly as we are to see whether or not they should ban him lol.
---
Context?
---
From a CS perspective, no. Not today.
---
Every time you "use" a random number generator, it "re seeds" itself. Specifically, the marsenne twister algorithm.
---
OSRS is old though, so it might not! It might actually have repeated sequences of numbers that aren't actually random, had you found a way to reach a certain seed that's already been used.
---
Chest bruh
---
So brave!
---
Upvoted for "Spider-Man armor"
---
"the morytania snuggle" just sounds like Settled had a really bad sex tape leaked
---
I would guess he does it after because there's a chance he fails and overlevels the account.
---
It's actually the opposite haha, I don't have much time to play and I play primarily on mobile. If I get a task that doesn't give me decent exp or takes too long for a grind as long as slayer, I'd prefer to get a better task. 
---
It's kind of rude of you to assume this much about me, but no harm done
---
This is indeed both cool and weird at the same time.
---
I died yesterday at corporeal beast due to a random disconnect. Not hcim tho
---
Oh yea. I was lol’ing in that Clue Casket simulator thread yesterday where people were legitimately upset that they were getting 3a items. On some
---
Java code webpage.
---
The community def has its toxic side, after reading your comments in this post you are definitely a member of it, and part of this problem.
---
She looks absolutely useless in battle
---
Still ur a dirty neckbeard with disgusting nails
---
Can confirm. Seeing 999999 posts about it was annoying as hell. Just upvote one or two posts to make a statement. It'll be seen by Jagex and won't annoy the rest of us.
---
I saw you mentioned something like this in another thread. Would you mind providing some proof? It probably won't sway people who are diehard Rendi fans, but i'm at least curious to know what the full story is.
---
It's beautiful. *Wipes tear*
---
I need both and I am a girl.
---
Do activities where you won’t die in the case of a disconnect
---
\+1  for this collection
---
That’s some high iq shit
---
Is it time for the daily Rendi hate thread? I don’t get it, most of the low lvl accomplishments rely on bugs, how is this any different?
---
I watched it and mildly question the legitimacy of it, but it's also very believable. If true, it's fascinating.
---
Blatantly obvious? No.
---
Energy Sword from Halo
---
Lol not complaining about being an iron by any means, i dont mind the hunter grind at all, anyone could be affected by this and lose their chins
---
My question is why you'd go bossing when the servers are being attacked lol
---
but salve&gt; slayer helm
---
To be fair, rendi also has a large ego and comes across like he thinks he's better than everyone else
---
Only one way to find out... promise I won't report you for breaking real world laws /s
---
bruh jamflex dont even hire customer support, of course they will have the worst server hardware......
---
Yea and the bug wasn't known before, so it might interest people on how it works?
---
I'm having fun replying to some comments made yesterday. Fuck the haters hahahaha
---
Obviously. But he doesn’t have 75 magic &gt;.&gt;
---
Slayer assignment: Men.
---
They always been like that..
---
Rendi has a persona. Not an ego.
---
Bring chins to throw at jad to lure healers in a toss or 3.
---
You didn't call Rendi shit per say, but you used this argument
---
*fotball player plays like shit*
---
Me: fuck him he fucking sucks
---
You: oH iWoUld lIKe tO sEe yOu Do iT bEtTeR
---
I just think your point is very shit, did the football player lose? Sure, does he suck? No.  Could you do it better? No.  You're the type of guy to call someone out and say they're bad or put someone down because they can't beat someone else, when you couldn't either or wouldn't even come close lmfao
---
Yes. There is gold and teal trimmed versions of all the basic armours up to rune available as rewards from treasure trails.
---
Lol I didnt know they were being attacked until I got disconnected, i was in the middle of playing when it happened
---
I'd imagine those are mostly the same people
---
Normally it's the blue message that says "step x", however, it's not the case for this unique situation
---
Disappointing. Spotify thinks you're defined only by the music you listen to and not by how many OSRS gfs you have
---
Lol I’m 300 kc no b ring yet
---
In the end, I feel your pain. 
---
Pkers and irons are kinda alike. Pures are told, hey you choose to limit yourself!!! Same thing irons get told haha. It’s IRONic
---
Not to be that guy but shouldn’t the value be more than 5m?
---
its like couple of afk hours to get 75 i dont see the problem.....
---
You're 100% right. Every multi-million dolar company with a popular game has these huge issues with connection because of dd0s that are on the verge of destroying the game. Some examples: Jagex, jemflex , jigglefox. Just a few examples.
---
why would anyone rather watch a few min vid not saying anything important or anything on any methods than watching a longer more informed video?
---
Really? Have you just not tried? I'm sure you would be able to do it with little effort honestly. If you dont know what you're doing look up a guide they help
---
The majority of high level players don't buy bonds. The dupe didn't go for several months. You could buy gp in 2005. Skilling to make money isn't viable.
---
Makes sense, but it was fun, all part of the adventure!
---
Ah skill tracker works for you?
---
The purpose of the buff was to keep the jaw at a high value. Which it currently is at 36m.
---
He lied? You’re full of shit, why because you say so with zero evidence? The burden of proof is on you, but you keep conveniently just talking shit. Where you looking through a peephole in the wall behind him? 
---
You seem awful sure about a lot of stuff that you’re literally making up.
---
Sorry guys it slipped my mind
---
Yea but sweet ass slayer helm tho
---
What is a paft?
---
Its the same roll chance but I wouldnt say its the same chance altogether. Although each individual clue roll is the same, the drop rate on clues themselves is a lot higher.
---
Lol the problem is you were wrong. Enjoy
---
Hope rendi takes a page out of xzacts book and makes his video shorter than 40 minutes
---
Shit time to save myself 200gp per quat
---
News to me
---
Oh lol did not know this
---
Your assumptive logic goes both ways; if rendi was telling the truth in the video, all the asswipes who got banned because of him would of course try to get revenge by claiming he wanted in on it and whatnot. It's rendi's word against people who crashed servers to dupe for rwt purposes.
---
What do you mean? He does stuff like interface stalling constantly. In a recent video, he tried to despawn an NPC. How would that stuff *not* be bug abuse?
---
No
---
Nah, that's what would make it special. Also this could arguably be left in game as a super niche mechanic rather than a bug.
---
My theory is that alkan or whoever recently lost their hc at arma is mad af and just hitting the server to prove a point that the servers are a potato
---
Or he had his account hacked and used for it and still hasn’t been able to change his name.
---
Its called logging out on ape atoll.
---
My character is on ape atoll, in the middle of mm.
---
isn't it a terrible weapon tough?
---
Robin -&gt; 1/325 from a hard clue
---
Ranger boots -&gt; 1/283 from a medium clue
---
D chain -&gt; 1/32k from a dust devil
---
D legs -&gt; 1/512 from a steel or brutal black dragon
---
D chain orn kit -&gt; 1/250 from an elite clue
---
D legs orn kit -&gt; 1/250 from an elite clue
---
3rd age longsword -&gt; 1/98k from an elite clue or 1/52k from a master clue (slightly higher if you include mimic chance)
---
Rocky -&gt; 1/36k from a gem stall
---
Pretty ridiculous considering this game mode has been out a month.
---
Bug abuse, probably something called pafting and related to his house
---
He does put a large amount of effort and he was drunk and did apologize. I forgive him, and so should you.
---
Agreed but also good copypasta
---
I like his content. I missed whatever reason why people seem to hate him beyond not liking his content.
---
I'm so proud :,)
---
He didn't just RWT. He used his platform as a content creator and influencer to take a sponsorship and promote RWT to his hundreds of thousands of viewers. A little different.
---
And before somebody says it.
---
Yes, BiS stuff used to be easier to get.
---
However, in this stage of the game's progression, there is no longer room to add BiS stuff to mid level monsters.
---
The Abyssal Whip being dropped by a camp-able mob would not justify the Ghrazi Rapier being dropped by one.
---
Lmaooooo
---
Ouch
---
Bit different, A Friend advertised a gambling site which thousands of viewers saw. KempQ rwted and didn't tell his viewers about it until after he was banned.
---
Yupp am aware
---
Efficiency nerds hate him 0 quest ironman love him
---
well these guys got fire cape on level 3 account by so called "working smarter"
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWMmQSq1ADA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWMmQSq1ADA)
---
It was essentially bug abuse. He used noted rings of recoil on a ring of suffering in his inventory to reset the recoil charges on the ring he had equipped, thus allowing for infinite recoil charges using only an equipped ring and 2 inventory spots.
---
Nobody said anything about equipping it, thanks for trying
---
1gp isn't 1gp, I'll explain later

Meh idm, trading in runescape is a wonderful thing

Never played league or counter strike or rust?

Crafting level IRL?

---
You could also log into the website and see for yourself :)
---
Loads of BIS uniques? There’s one armor set and one staff. And the armor set is very niche (crush only, crap defense).
---
It's sad that glitcher beats the record of some people who work super hard for their fire capes
---
I mean this is true for lots of content, but they can be used to grief...like specially here to make seeing the core harder.
---
Corp just happened to be high profile for a while with streamers/masses etc...
---
So it was decided to exclude them.
---
do you have the handle for that bot so i can follow it?
---
ring of suffering requires 75 hp. and lol to u thinking hes the first player to think of ring of suffering
---
There’s 7 ogresses in that part of the cave. And one spawns half way through the second one I fight. I figure 5-6 ogresses all for him would’ve been enough.
---
Proof why we can't go back to the shitty old death mechanics. Just because we might go several months without an attack and DDOS deaths doesn't mean it can't never happen, out of the blue, once again.
---
Karamja shipping wants to hire you
---
3 staves, a mace, and an armor set matching bandos in str bonus.
---
Pretty much. Those of us who played runescape when we were kids forget that its still a kids game for the most part that still has a shit load of kids. Of course most of them pretend to be adults but I think that accounts for most of the toxicity
---
This world is so broken. I hate the way drinking is normalised but causes deaths etc etc, not to mention the countless issues that arise when people drink.
---
When was the last time a stoner died cause of smoking or got into a fight with someone who bumped into them at a club
---
You have zero proof.
---
This guys gets it
---
There's supposed to be cons for individual 99 capes? And what cons am I taking away from a cape if it's giving the player the additional option to pinpoint where in the guild they wanna tele into. Would I take away the con of the player not being able to do that?   It's about letting someone going through a options menu to set up a a more specific spot they can tele into at a location they can already tele into to begin with.
---
Odablock
---
What the fuck does that say
---
Bought for 43.8. Appreciate the help bro
---
when you consider that he left the content creator discord, not the bug abuse one, your theory falls apart. there is, without a doubt, more to the story than what's in his video, but this isn't it.
---
Fam.... Why on earth would you be using a d scim instead of a whip to train def? Either way grats that's a cool one to get out of the way first
---
Or, more likely, for Falador Easy Diary
---
Fuck, this is getting good.
---
Rendi: omg I’m the savior of rs people just keep abusing the game for personal gain.
---
Also Rendi: ok so I abused the game for personal gain but my abuses were just smart not bad.
---
After looking up the runes on google again, you're definitely right. Going back down to repaint it right now. Thanks for the heads up!
---
That's not osrs
---
He used a bug that revolves around the ring of recoil.  Something about using noted rings of recoil on a ring of suffering resets the charges on your ring of recoil.
---
Given that allowing noted rings to be added to was literally polled and passed, i doubt it will be removed.
---
Yeah if he was to go stake with a whip that would be his last max hit.... What a dumb comment
---
Oh shit I love summoningsalts videos... yes please do an rs one!!
---
If you only know about the game from watching YouTube videos I could see how you may form this opinion
---
The picture I here makes it look white, in real life it's a nice clear blue. But if it needs to be purple I'll go back down and redo it. Cheers for letting me know!
---
Pets persist?
---
🦀🦀🦀 I went Christmas shopping bc no servers and THEYRE BACK?! 🦀🦀🦀
---
this
---
Np and grats. Now go put it to use and tear shit up.
---
why would he defensively hit jad instead of accurately (+3 attack)?
---
If he managed to delete entities to get the lowest combat fire cape, you think this will have any impact on getting the lowest combat inferno cape?
---
Like deleting either the mage or ranger before Zuk? Might even be useful for people just struggling to get the inferno cape, but I'd doubt Jagex would let that person keep the inferno cape afterwards.
---
He abused a glitch that allows you to use noted rings of recoil to reset the charges on an unnoted one.
---
&gt;I think the issue is they are intended the Nightmare to be this big unknown to make it more of a surprise and to play into its creepy themes. But that kinda backfires when it is your headlining update for the year and the thing you need to sell your game's future on.
---
This exactly. I feel like if it's going to be the big headline update of 2020, it's gotta be fleshed out over multiple dev blogs and implemented with plenty of community discussion/feedback. Unless they have been working on it internally for a while now, it seems a bit rushed and that's the opposite of what I want for the biggest update of the year.
---
The only way to do that is pafting, which you can't do anymore. And if that was the case, why didn't he do it on a level 3?
---
It is *now*. But it entered the game as a bug, was considered a bug, and people who weren't savvy enough to perform it didn't like that it gave people an advantage. But now that it's been in the game as long as it has, Jagex has started balancing challenging content around it.
---
We don't know how Rendi got this cape. It probably involves something that's a bug. Doesn't mean it's a lesser achievement.
---
i dont do quests
---
A key difference between Xzact and Rendi is that Rendi has always been interested in breaking and abusing the game, where Xzact seems to be more about masterful timing and execution of intended tactics.
---
How did you get the screen shot to be that low res?
---
cant wait to dislike that video. hes getting cringier by the day
---
Here is a video [bam ](https://youtu.be/1ykFTGN_FiM)
---
Always makes me happy to see this.
---
Aged like milk lmao
---
the "Blasted ore" item does, but once you deposit the blasted ore into the machine it gets stored in the sack until you withdraw it, at which point you take all the ore in noted form
---
I also believe chaos runes have orange around them not yellow look good though
---
lol why on earth would they do that? there is zero precedent for such a thing and not a single person would reasonably expect that to happen
---
He just trained a bunch of random skills to mess with people
---
Jad has been around so long that if the technique they used was actually a bug it would have been fixed by now. It's not a bug anymore, it's just the meta.
---
Idk what op is on about lol guess he’s just trying to get attention
---
9might literally be the lowest possible combat to complete it at because he literally has less than 500 total combat xp and is like 9.68 combat. You can’t recoil the melee’s because they heal too quickly. Rendi got the xp in defense as to have the lowest effect in combat levels AN xzact is doing this to make accounts for lower inferno runs; which means it’d be counterproductive for him to get the xp in defense

You can get long Arma trips flicking bow|bulwark or freezing Kalissa and then just attacking kree. You can do 20+ boss kill trips using this method even without flicking the minions post-kill

is this what we've come to now? lying on the internet?
---
Yeah I had no idea this was an issue. Only thing I can complain about is occasionally my phone forgets to save my iron man’s login
---
They specifically said they didn't want to do this... Also, why does the Nightmare need the Charm and why do you think it would be an Avernic or a Dex? It would be hard for the Charm to hold value as an Arcane attachment without running into a Pegasian Crystal issue (where the attachment is more common than the item it upgrades). So it would likely need to be one of the rarer rewards to avoid that seeing as the Arcane is pretty darn rare, but if it were that rare it wouldn't be a hilt or scroll equivalent.
---
Also, the Nightmare still has 8 unique drops... I don't see how you can claim it needs a 4% magic damage offhand for long-term profit when its other rewards are a lot stronger. This is like saying ToB needs the Ranged Vambracers for long-term profit and ignoring the Scythe, Rapier, and such...
---
u can buy it tho
---
Dude same!!! This is why defence will be my first combat 99.
---
Nice mining level, I suggest questing as money isn't gonna come easily with ur stats rn
---
They do but it would seem that the person has to wait for that free change hence not wasting a bond
---
Visage: 5m
---
DWH 46M
---
Elder maul: 10M
---
Bandos hilt: 8M
---
Total value: 69M + mixer new item of high value, hard to create.
---
Let's put the new item at least as scarce/desirable as the Basilisk jaw, 30m each.
---
So total &gt;100M for the weapon. The "it better be op because of" is just a great excuse for this never happening in the game. lol
---
It should be balanced and better than the weapons involved at their thing, and that's it. And being better at what they do can only increase their value instead of replacing and destroying them (current trend).
---
I was thinking on these stats:
---
+160 crush (+25 better accuracy) +151 str (+4 strenght extra max hit)
---
It would be worse than a rapier, but better than a whip dps wise. Mainly used as universal spec weapon for debuffs, as it would be a mix of bgs/dwh, -30% debuff with +50% accuracy, aka, a dwh that doesn't splash too much because of the accuracy buff (&gt;250 accuracy vs 120 crush dwh). Without any str buff and damage divided in 50%, 10% x5 every tick after just so it's not really a ko weapon.
---
It could also have tiers on its own, as an elder maul attached thanks to the new item only to a visage (t1), visage and hilt (t2), visage, hilt and dwh (t3). So items could have a progression in their own with an intrinsec incentive to hoard/sink/use/demand older items instead of turning them to alch prices..
---
New updates could build on these upgrade trees instead of powercreep replacing old stuff altogether every time.

Do you understand the oversight that was used here? The game mechanics are working 100% as intended, it’s just an oversight letting players add charges to the suffering outside of a bank, just like letting players open mole packs inside the inferno was

**HE REPLIED LESS THAN 48 HOURS LATER WITH A 9CMB FIRE CAPE.**
---
this is probably the reason we've been having all those server crashes
---
the crashes  now is xact going for 8cb
---
rapier isnt even 200m right now so i dont think it would be higher than that long-term, but i could see the staff being very valuable, especially if it is good on the nightmare itself.
---
i would buy these as a set 100%
---
Which specific mechanic do you think is not working as intended?
---
The current mechanic of adding charges to the suffering is working as intended.
---
Jagex not thinking ahead of how this many benefit players who don’t have 75 hp is an oversight
---
I used to use steel darts. They're super cheap and reasonably fast.
---
You still cant "easily" max even with the absolute most expensive methods. Its still going to take hundreds of hours, no matter how many billions of gp you have. Seeing how you cant just throw money at skills like melee combat, agility, everyone's fav RC, WC, etc. 
---
Osrs is far from p2w dude. Even with the ability to buy bonds, and with unlimited gp you can still only go so fast with whats available. Dudes prob talking about some mobile game like a candy crush type of genre of some shit.
---
The inner emotion displayed by the focus as they anticipate their future attachments is on full display. Beautiful piece as always.
---
Looks amazing, any chance you could do a version with the rune kite?
---
It certainly can be P2W in some areas, but it is not what I'd consider a P2W game. Unless you do some serious rule breaking and buy an account, you still need to grind yourself and all the money in the world won't make those quests or RC levels go much quicker... So even if you are a Level 50 with a T Bow and a Scythe, there is still a lot you can't pay your way past.
---
He didnt print them with those colors, he painted the runes after being 3d printed. He can easily just repaint it.
---
Prayer flicking and tick manipulation are bugs but they remain in game.
---
yeah its probably too personal to share
---
No it's still bug abuse
---
The inferno wasnt suddenly achievable due to the brew trick, that's just pontificating
---
Why ask? You know full well what isn't working as intended.
---
If you use a noted ring of recoil on a suffering, why would an unnoted recoil be reset for any reason? It's obviously a bug.
---
Okay? That’s not relevant to whether or not it is a bug
---
Tools are worth using if you plan to use the methods where the tools excel. If you plan to do volcanic mine for mining, redwoods for woodcutting, or 2t swordfish/tuna for fishing, the crystal tools are worth it. If you have completed your firemaking/cooking goals, the crystal axe and harpoon become even better since you are no longer losing the bonus infernal tool exp.
---
Shards are very easy to get with crystal trees. You can easily do 2 trees a day, so that's 30 shards every day for very little time commitment. You can also get shards efficiently by doing the prif agility course, at 15 shards/hr. If you really need shards ASAP, gauntlet or zalcano are your best bet.
---
In terms of money, also worth it. You can use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NDJrj9Qu21KWC-1UeirA4Kgdnx4g7-KR7Gtphxt8Bpw/edit?usp=sharing) to look at hours saved and shards used for the various methods. A quick calculation at 15000gp/shard shows that volcanic mine costs 637k/hr saved, and redwoods are 980k/hr saved if you need fm exp, and 540k/hr saved if you don't need fm exp. These prices are a little high because I didn't include the time to make the potions. Any of those prices should be worth it considering your account has access to prif.
---
Lmfao
---
Rendi if you’re alive post a selfie with a newspaper showing today’s headline
---
Except I have to put mine in every single time I go to login, not using a VPN, and jagex's solution was to tell me to turn it off and back on, and as soon as I turned it off I got hacked and they took all my ores from my 90 mining, like 30m worth.
---
I shouldn't have to put it in every time, and I wouldn't mind if they actually cared, but they really just don't give a fuck
---
10/10, would impulse buy and regret nothing
---
Without the book, the staff is 11% better dps at 99 than Sang at 120 on Olm’s right claw which is comparable to the difference between rapier and lance on his left claw. 
---
That’s massive. The tome + sang at 120 had the staff at only 4% better dps

This is superb.. Do a dragon or bandos or even justiciar please
---
Your 100% right thats i was like ehh i gues could kinda see where he comes from but its not a full blown p2w its like warframe you can pay for nice stuff but its useless until you put in some elbow grease

**KAKAAAROOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT**

---
&gt;If you use a noted ring of recoil on a suffering, why would an unnoted recoil be reset for any reason?
---
I’m glad you asked!
---
Recoil charges are shared between all rings. There is no metadata on a recoil ring, if one ring has 20 charges then any of your rings do. If you use a ring until it has 20 charges and then drop it, the next ring you buy on the ge will only have 20 charges.
---
So, when implementing the ring of suffering, Jagex had two options:
---
1) If a recoil has 20 charges and is added to the RoS, then they could have consumed a recoil, added 40 charges to the RoS, and the next recoil you use would still have 20 charges. This doesn’t seem consistent because you get 40 charges out of a ring with 20. It would essentially allow you to gain an extra 39 recoil charges per account
---
2) If a recoil has 20 charges, add 20 charges to the RoS, consume the recoil, and then your next recoil will have 40 charges 
---
*They very deliberately chose option 2,* which is the current mechanic and is working 100% as intended
---
It was just an oversight that this would allow lower level players to consume a noted recoil in order to regenerate an unnoted one
---
Your right lol im just saying i can kind of see what he means but its more just ezscape instead p2w when it comes to dumping money

---
Staff is new bis magic pvm and an amazing spec weapon for pvp that allows standard spellbook and tb. As long as it's not ridiculously common it will be valuable. 
---
The mace should hold decent value. Rapier kind of got outclassed everywhere it was useful by dragonbone weapons
---
See you in hot
---
Stand and deliver!
---
Is the account cave-ready yet?
---
That’s what I was thinking as well, though knowing jagex it wouldn’t surprise me if
---
1. They rush to get it out due to hype and demand (less likely)
---
2. It comes out far later than expected to due engine complications (far more likely)
---
I mean bugs and glitches are not only allowed but needed in speed running games right? I don’t know that scene too much but if it’s like that why not with low lvl fire capes
---
The devil is in those details though. Look at the difference in earning efficiency between momma's boy, wearing full justiciar but with obby cape and combat bracelet, and the OG old school main, with his hard fremmy diary herb patches, fossil island birdhouse runs, mastery of vorkath and zulrah, elite void, rune dragons unlocked, badass PoH, etc. Huge difference in gp/hr, and momma's boy gets to skip all the hundreds of hours of prep work to get that gold. Multiply that difference across 100s of 1000s of accounts, and yeah you have real, tangible, bank fucking inflation.

I agree mostly but they wrote amazing machine learning not detection software that could change the game. They need to expedite that
---
He made a video exposing a gp duplication bug that happened a few weeks back, and in the video he basically jerked himself off saying things akin to "if I hadn't reported this to jagex the economy would be ruined". Was a good video, but the way he spoke so highly about himself was off-putting.
---
While I agree with your summary of the community, I think attachscape is horrible. So many items now come as nonsensical upgrades to existing items because people dont want stuff devalued. It's a fair concern, but it massively restricts the kind of gear that can come into the game, and we end up with crazy and horribly nuanced/imbalanced (in less obvious ways) stuff like tbow, scythe, and the new mage staves that are lazily justified by some ""niche"" or by an upkeep cost that no one with 1b gives a fuck about.
---
its actually pretty shit, sorry to bring bad news
---
Awhh such a shame, oh wel. I'm in there till lvl 99 firemaking, and since I fletch a lot I suppose I'm there for the long run anyway. Thanks for giving me a perspective on how to feel :')
---
I like this guy fashionscape
---
&gt;I think that would be more of an insult to low level achievement hunters than anything else.
---
How do you figure? They can't use this item, so it should be irrelevant to them.
---
There isn't much the average person can do aside from voting when the elections roll around. Stressing day to day over political shit isn't accomplishing anything and just makes your own life worse

Anything right of extreme left. ^^^^/s
---
Time and time again new items have entered the game only focusing on a few aspects:
---
* items that deal more damage/accuracy
---
* items that drain or restore stats
---
Players have repeatedly said they want updates to existing dead content over new content being put into the game.
---
I personally believe it would be good to focus more on updating existing special attack items to provide utility, to change the pking meta to make it feel new and exciting.
---
When new game modes come out the major thing i hear people praise is that "its an unsolved meta, that players need to figure out what the meta is". But with things like LMS it's the same pk meta, just a different way of acquiring items.
---
I feel pvp in general is a solved meta but with a few different play styles (NH, DHing, Venge, rushing etc.) which is why some players are bored of it, and opting to only do PvM, where boss mechanics are unique to each raid.
---
You're missing every heraldic helmet

i used to go for 100% until i learned it didnt helpt at all, the only reason i got that many bolt racks

---
what was the time between the 2 posts
---
Yeah but if I use all elite diary lamps I lose 6m in gp from the runes at bloods, but I save 16 hours of runecrafting. And if you can’t make 6m in 16 hours of doing almost anything else then idk what to tell you
---
He used ring of recoil for almost all the damage. This is probably considered bug abuse but you can use noted recoils, so he could have brought in thousands of them

Honestly this is what rune should look like in rs3, it looks more regal and knightly. The new version just doesn't fit runescape.
---
I'd call it more of an oversight than a bug. It definitely was not an intended mechanic from that function, so they will likely do something to block it. Making it so you can only charge suffering at a bank could also work, but seeing as you can't use the ring without 75 HP it does seem a bit pointless to be able to add charges you can't get back below 75 HP.

Twitter replies said his total combat xp totaled to 492, this really isn't far away. 172+172+80 is 424 xp. (edit: 432xp actually, you can fit two extra hits if you go for 1 atk 3 def instead)

All is left is to find a way to use the recoil trick to tick-eat for the entire game. This sounds impossibly complicated though...
