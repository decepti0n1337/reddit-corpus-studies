Still better than that guys 99 fletching cake lmao

Turael boosting with konar using expeditious bracelets is ridiculous.

---
Am I being dumb. Isn’t there a mage hat and ancestral hat missing ?
---
Where exactly did I make this claim?
---
Lol. I can cook but, as evidence shows, I can't bake to save my life.
---
&gt; They said "It's all (i.e all criticism) is unacceptable"
---
No they did not. They said, in direct quotes, 
---
&gt; She has received some really nasty personal backlash which is not acceptable.
---
You literally asked how this was legal. You’re dumb.
---
compare it to wow doing stuff like waterfall quest and witches house as a noob felt a lot more interactive. and the fact that a lot of quests have crucial items/features locked behind them makes it feel like they are worth doing instead of just a flat xp/gp reward or a gear reward that you will throw away in a few levels.
---
Really makes you realize how unfunny/unoriginal most people are.
---
Depends, how long ago was torvestas last wilderness video?
---
I am Hispanic. I speak Spanish. I have noticed that every time I am in Zalcanohost and doing Zalcano I play with Spanish people. I ask them where they’re from, they say Venezuela. Some of them don’t even need to tell me, they have it in their names or speak in a way only Venezuelans do. 
---
I am speaking about Venezuelans. It is undeniable they are a large source of black market gold. It’s not racist. I don’t view them as lower than me. I’ve never said they were.
---
Nothing I’ve said was racist. You’re just assuming I’m some white guy complaining about Spanish people.
---
That picture doesn't have my current collection: https://imgur.com/a/FJYs2sR
---
Ah. My apologies , good luck then.
---
Can somebody help me on the math revolving around the statistics of this occurring, I'm getting around 3.5% given the number of trials but that seems like a very high estimate.
---
Edit: actually seems to be right. To expect the drops you have received  in 436kc with 90% confidence  you would need 27800 kills.
---
I want a quest to adopt the good doggy
---
Anything with baby yoda is gold.
---
It's understandable though. People don't want to have to grind for the White Knight store unlocks.
---
I feel like your rules will make this very hard to have fun with. I get that fun isn’t exactly the point but you need it to be something that you can see through to the end. Anytime you try to do something, you’re ultimately going to end up just trying to make money over anything else which will just slow you down immensely, Imagine doing a quest and having to hop from city to city, it will make the quest take significantly longer. I think you have a good starting point for how you broke up the map, but maybe a different sort of challenge would be better. Maybe something where you have a decent mid-level account and you do everything you can in those areas to make as much money as possible and give yourself a time restriction in each area. You can set specific goals for an area as well. For example, not leaving a certain area until you’ve cleared that areas agility courses. But again, things like that will just take away from a main goal, if that itself is not the goal.
---
Thanks i really hope this goes through if not my family and I will not have a good venezualen Christmas.
---
Yeah, most people just vote yes to more money, more slayer or anything that makes their life easier. The old way death penalty needs to make a return, the game is only hard/fun when playing hcim now
---
Thank you :D
---
Whether it is legal or not has nothing to do with Reddit itself. All I said is that maybe moderators have any control over it. 
---
Besides that, I'm sure that the owner of the gold-selling website is infringing on Jagex' intellectual property _in some way_, making it actually illegal.
---
Welcome to reddit
---
No most efficient fastest points is wildly slayer
---
Like dragon items, bgloves etc etc?
---
Are you just trying to get 1kc  for western hard diary?
---
Good job man! What's next?
---
No you clearly made claims about it’s legality. Trust me I know how to read. Clearly you don’t. And this conversation ends here. FUCK YOU!
---
Yuuuuuup.
---
What in the world is wrong with you?
---
&gt;Good gear isn’t going to make you better at the game.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This game has a lot more focus on the mechanics side of a boss over the gear.
---
lol that was pretty funny
---
I think there should be a new drop that can be exchanged for looting bags to get them easier.
---
Your fucked :)
---
going "full rs3" would be against their own interests as a business. i dont think the poll system is going anywhere soon
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah but you're also probably depressed but refuse to seek help and instead derive shallow pleasure from trying to make other people as miserable as you are.
---
Cant wait until a year after the release when people are crying about how powercreeped the rewards are.
---
all non-combat skills are super boring lol, so are combats tbh if just sitting in nmz, but if they are afk it's at least tolerable which is not really the case with construction.
---
55 rc wtf you insane dude
---
not that many factors tho
---
if profit/H without unique is still good and the income is almost fixed on alchables/resources, then you can expect the unique to reach alch prices, cuz there's no limit to it being overfarmed.. unlike gwd, daganoths kings, corp..
---
Maybe the intentions were good, but it is hypercritical of jagex to add this feature, I myself am not so impressed, it is too cynical.
---
Gee isn’t gonna give you a peepee touch dude. Imagine being this much of a beta orbiter lol.
---
Tele grab wine of zammy, kill ogress at Corsair cave, best two options and both are pretty sucky, also could mine high level ore by that only worth it if your mining LVL is high enough
---
You spawn in Lumbridge as soon as you get off of tutorial island, and no you cannot trim armor. You can buy it from the GE, or complete treasure trails and hope for a trimmed reward.
---
To reach the stone bridge walk straight out of Lumbridge Castle and you'll see it slightly to the north.
---
Projecting much?
---
You’re just policing the use of Venezuelan versus Venezuelan gold farmer. I get the comparison but it’s clear I mean Venezuelan gold farmer. I don’t mean every Venezuelan - given the context of the post it is clear I mean people who are RWTIng gold. But I see where you’re coming from and see how that can be misconstrued as something bad.

You're getting baited pal

Regardless, the question was asked, and answered.
---
biggest bs ive ever heard in my life bro my axe weighs 30 lbs and the tree i chop takes 3 hrs per lvl are u dumb
---
facts isnt crying
---
btw
---
I'll take any recommendations on what would look best :P truly I've just been somewhat throwing them in, some of those white helms are actually rune, I guess we'd go by Roygbiv?
---
bro legit i chopped like 2k logs last year

Gz you an Ironman or no?
---
Sick! Rise up
---
Just got a 5th primordial. c:
---
EDIT: Like an hour ago.
---
The quests in runescape are one of the few things it does extraordinarily well.  If you space bar quests that is just you missing out on story and lore.
---
This is underrated.
---
It's probably gonna be in the new quest. There's a reason I think this and it's a compete hunch based on how an npc in sleepe is wearing one. It's a completely obscure item that they revisited in order to dress a new npc in anticipation of the new quest.
---
Whats a helmq
---
For how long have you played OSRS? 
---
16 years
---
What is the reason you play or played OSRS? 
---
easy, cheap and fun way to waste time
---
On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you enjoy playing OSRS? 
---
on the max grind 1 since i hated it, since i maxed all i do is cox and my fun would be an 8.
---
Do you plan on quitting the game?If answered yes, why? If no, why not? 
---
not atm, might play a bit less
---
How much money have you spent on OSRS? 
---
haven't spend a dime since bonds released, before bonds monthly membership.
---
What do you think personally is the best in games? Playing with friends, competitive mode, socializing with new people etc. (if you can think of another reason, please write it down)
---
teamwork and fun, which cox is for me
---
Had to find out the hard way. Oh well. Rebuild time!
---
Yeah, that's my point. They've both made some pretty ugly and out of place stuff, but there's no reason for personal attacks.
---
The motivations I've mentioned for Ghost are things he's said in the past.
---
do it bitch u wont
---
What gave it away
---
Old old school runescape when?
---
FYI Kourend tele through either Xerixs amulet or normal spellbook require completion of arch alliance which obviously would not be efficient to 6k point rushing.  
---
Definitely agree tithe is mandatory and if you take artisan over way of the warrior 100m firemaking with 75 thieving should get you damn close to 6k as fast as possible.
---
And I thought I had rng when I got 2 claws in 45 kc.
---
Where can I find a list of clans to join
---
Very exciting installment! I was very worried for you when the man noticed you pickpocketing him! Gz on the level bro

All they'll need to do is remove Rune armour and make Dragon free to play.

Rolling in gp tho
---
The fact that you could have gotten a 3rd age at that very moment lmao.
---
On a side note, imagine that an animal like that actually exists. Looks fucking terrifying.
---
how
---
Steam runes are about 10% less exp an hour than lavas but you make like 500k gold an hour.
---
Don't forget the ironman helmets.
---
Crabs are real. They're horrific.

My problem is for more than just the mobile client. My web browsers (firefox and chrome) also can't reach the actual website and haven't been able to for a few days now.
---
reddit
---
Thats trash if it was so known feel like jagex could just get rid of the account. Obviously that doesnt help me but it could help others avoid this situation. If your paying customers stop paying because of a situation. Its the company's  fault that you dont provide something to help the customer.
---
Should've blocked out your run energy boyo. GF acc.

Glgl!

Interesting how you went to the negative side of things. She's the one that also designed konar
---
man you have good fucking taste, love me some reason.
---
Ya man what got me is im standing in the same spot for 5 minutes 1 step from death. I trade him multiple times figuring he would run as i try to trade and pull me in. That didnt happen. Now a 4th person or 5th at this point trades me a war hammer. Now i go to trade and my character moves for some reason get zgs KO'ed. I was zammy brewed down. RIP.
---
Do the dart tip quest and Smith bronze dart tips for about 200k go per hour
---
Remember the dozens of people all running through the moss giants while doing waterfall quest during the first day? The heroes of old, tanking mossies with an inventory of bread while they taxi other players through that dungeon. Good times
---
I wish

The dragon pen is mightier than the dragon sword
---
Practice then, good players won’t want the burden in teaching you.
---
Read some guides and go from there.
---
the fuck did you just call me?
---
Do you even english bro
---
Zoomed, can't unsee..
---
npc contact would make the grind a lot easier but would be something i would have to unlock which is the challenge which i find pretty interesting going forward. 500k worth in bank. it doesnt need to be coin stack. hell at this point im collecting goblin hammers and saving every little bit of junk i can. yes i must grind the resources within the city i am currently residing in. i have a map drawn out on another one of my posts, feel free to review if you are interested. i can travel withing the neutral zones but i cannot access a different city besides the one i am currently located in, it would be better to never go into cities but the challenges locks me in a city at any given point. i am going to be releasing videos sometime soon, hopefully i can explain it/simplify the rules by then. speaking of which there are a lot of rules, this is due to the fact of the vast world and environment runescape offers and am only proceeding based off my knowledge of osrs. thanks for the feedback friend. very much appreciate.
---
7 posts in 2 hours making basically the same joke. Spotify gives you an analysis of what you listened to during the year, I assume these jokesters are all only listening to Sea Shanty and they all wanted to post about it.

Goddamn nice
---
I mean actually the scammers still live on.
---
Like 20% or something, and no one cares that you typed @Jagex.
---
Well one is a large white Lizards...
---
 
---
 That must be woox
---
How do you not get that anti scamming is still scamming? It doesnt matter if you're scamming a bad person you yourself are just as bad for trying to scam
---
You forget that there are literal 10 year olds playing this game.
---
Albino gators?
---
Verac’s helm.
---
I'll have to watch this and see if I can get better at it.
---
My success rate is very low. My first B2B successes didn't come until like the late 20's. I usually seem to have just 1 or 2 notable misplays (off-pray hits, or 40-50 dmg comboes with those tornado things or tiles,) and die with it at 30-120 HP.
---
I haven't practice that much though, and still haven't made a 30th attempt.
---
What, how does your account get locked automatically but mine wakes up in lumbridge, requesting a pin reset not 6 hours after I just logged out from where I live, and it was accessed from mainland China?
---
This was like a month ago. I only play on mobile, and my email was not able to be accessed by them thankfully, although they tried to a LOT. Why is this only supposedly happening to people who actually own their accounts and not those whose accounts were hacked?
---
thanks nick. i appreciate the response. i must agree. hearing it sounds like it would not be a lot of fun, but i have this sort of plan set out on how i want to present this challenge to the audience. i think if the footage i collect can be cut appropriately and presented in a simplified manner (similar to a milestone sort of format) i think i can truly make something out of this, i guess what i am saying is that it would be a lot less fun to do this challenge, but would be a lot more entertaining for a viewer to watch. i am grateful for your feedback. thank you!
---
you blur out their phone # but not insta and website? lmao
---
Happy birthday! Hope you get to see the wife and friends again soon!
---
I just went through the torso grind and I felt the same. You just gotta get in there and go. It's really easy to do collector and attacker, so start there and get good at making your calls quickly. The only trouble I had was my first defender game, I had watched so many guides and had it all mapped out beside me, but when it started I froze and panicked and my group left me and called me a noob lol. Then the second game I had no problems and was usually finished my role very quickly! Just jump in there and start the grind, you got this bro! Remember CHAD lol
---
I installed cable for about a month, and this is the shit that made me quit.
---
My buddy got his license plate to say 99 MAGIC. Doesn’t even play runescape anymore. SMH. What a goblin boy.
---
I was patting doggo on the way past Varrock West Bank and I thought it fkn bit me and hit for 10, was like wtf... turns out.. I forgot I was in a PK world :) :) :) Convinced the dog is in on it $$
---
R2h smithing
---
Neither are memes
---
Yep I’ve been exchanging them for over an hour now I’ve had every shape except the one I need it’s so weird
---
That's a cute Rune pouch.
---
Slayer..
---
Larlor
---
You get your own special ♿ helmet off tutorial island why would you want more.
---
Just be happy it's on the league lol
---
Yeah. I’m just too lazy. I’ve tried it twice and died because I lagged the first time and then the second time my wife asked me a question and I looked away for too long. Both at Jad. 
---
I barely play so I can’t be bothered with it.
---
All you gotta do is complain then you get the drop
---
I got it on my first clue back in 2005. Back then people were dumb and inefficient and rangers went for around 500k.
---
true. I have started doing CMs I like how sweaty they can get
---
\^
---
I’ve never seen jesus come down and slay saradomin followers just sayin
---
ahhh yes, i was 16th to 85 on march 6th, made bank, rocks were free and ores were 15k ea, good times
---
Barrows with Iban's blast probably
---
The xp/hr won't be very good but it'll make you some money. Most training methods that would get you to 85 fairly quickly will lose money, not gain it.
---
I picked 10k flax and spun that back when strings were about 235-250each.
---
I regret nothing
---
Cup? Im an og noob aha
---
Happy birthday, man. I am 27, and I have spent a few birthdays alone, on RuneScape. I just took a shot for you. :)
---
Sell bonds irl and get rich so you don't have to pay taxes
---
Make jesus new slayer master.
---
Hes south of the pub
---
No it’s obviously legal gambling. Anyone with half a brain would know that. It’s just illegal RWTing that occurs around it, and in a lot of times because they want to gamble.
---
well then hill giants is the way to go, but if u even wanna be mems id say buy 1 month and just work from there
---
I forgot to mention I only have magic in my account and no other stats, sorry.
---
Sorry XP that was autocorrect
---
You don’t because we are all 1099’s 😅
---
Was wondering why google had no answers.. Usually they have it all ;P
---
What lvl are you n how long you been playing?
---
alching would go pretty good xp and very afk
---
Ok poor
---
The crab looks delicious. I’d pay $11 for that.
---
Someone caught him
---
Im really strapped for cash for the forseeable future but definitely plan on a 12 month.
---
Just wanna make as much of f2p in the meantime.
---
Been playing rs since 2004 and osrs since day 1 lmfao
---
THBBBBBBBBBBBBTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I guess high alching is a possibility, though its slower than other methods, it's the only method that will make you money
---
Your getting angry at my comment of practice because it sounds like you want someone to hold your hand. 
---
The vast majority aren’t going to do that for you.
---
Shit how do you think those that are good at it learnt? They fucking practiced.
---
I did 34-70 at tithe farm so sure go for it.
---
when doing agility you can click climb ladder rather than climb wall and its hard to notice especially on mobile
---
Im going to sus out the giants now.. Ill lyk know how i go guys/gals 😛
---
Ahhh, so if you misclick you'll sew the yellow x versus with the ladder you still see the red
---
95 range and Mage on my 1 def main
---
The mobile bubble burst. 
---
Otherwise, the game is healthy and following the pre-mobile slow and steady population climb.
---
(They should still delete nmz.)
---
So you were also skulled? 
---
Had something more valuable than your tbow?
---
This isn’t making sense to me...
---
Also this is hilarious to read considering your last post was a PSA about scammers..
---
It’s too easy to acquire for how broken it is. I think the drop rate would need to be increased significantly (somewhere around the frequency of the dusk robe set pieces)
---
And Zulrah and Zalcano, and everything else that drops 90% of their loot as alchables and skilling supplies instead of unique loot being very rare and valuable. And for skilling updates farming guild and wintertodt were incredibly overpowered for loot, but they got nerfed to be somewhat reasonable. Zulrah is still op though.
---
Basically every update where they add an easy drop source for something that was once on very few or no drop tables makes the economy crash for that item. Just look at herbs, secondaries, ores.
---
I would only really recomend Ibans staff at barrows brother if you're a low level account kiting the melee brothers to avoid using prayer pots, just trying to get lucky for some starting cash or for ironmen or something.
---
The thing is you might not see the same dps until your mage level is higher what I learned. I found it underwhelming for bossing when I used it at level 75 right away, and it felt like a big waste of money due to charges, and more from scales if that's applicable to you. I personally prefered salamanders If I have to go down that kind of route at its better dps then Ibans staff, and you can use it on all brothers. The best part is that it costs like 6 gp a cast. Obviously use blowpipe, or melee if you have it, but it's a viable cheap weapon for barrows.
---
I wish they understood sometimes it's deeper then the " appeal " process when 80 percent of band are perm before the Appeal process. This game takes mass amounts of time to progress and they just hit players with " its the end of the road start new" ( I lost a near max on rs3 to " macroing " when I was just one clicking a agility course.
---
Rip. Gl. Maybe you get at 10k on the dot 😅
---
To be fair, I have thousands of hours between two accounts and I’ve never “learned” about partner Slayer. The beauty of the osrs is that you don’t really *have* to learn about things you’re not interested in doing.
---
I got 19kc Kree today though so I’m good for awhile. Still really excited about it
---
...how do you have enough gp for a tbow and still be able to fall for this scam? It's widely known and I feel like an experienced played (one that's played enough to acquire a tbow) would know about it.  
---
Don't trust anyone in game giving you items to try. There's always an ulterior motive
---
Again I think criticising someone's opinion is a valid and important thing for people to do.
---
But you can hate on her opinion (which I do disagree with as well, why come work for an "old-school" game if you want to do current day art.. go work on RS3), and not hate on her.
---
That's the distinction I'm trying to define. An opinion, a piece of work, etc. Is made to be criticised and improved upon. But being like "she said something I don't like so I'm allowed to call her a dickhead" isn't exactly correct.
---
Not cats?
---
To be honest, judging by the amount of time I spend on Reddit and the amount of reposting and meme referencing I see on here, I’m starting to think that this is a real possibility.
---
I could get a degree in memes or something, to bad it wouldn’t get me anywhere...
---
Honestly I hate how everything in osrs needs to be profitable. Go kill the money dragon or something. To me wildy should be about most points/hr. It's slayer with more risk, so you should be rewarded.
---
Calm down
---
People dont get sarcasm these days i guess
---
This is great. I haven’t seen a single person use javelins below adamant in my entire time playing the game; this could also potentially create some interesting new ranged builds for pking pures
---
Atm my goal is 10k, then I’ll take a break from it. I’ll let ya know how did it turn out at around weekend
---
At least you do have a wife and friends. At such a tender age too!
---
I’m 28 and I can’t relate to your post.
---
undertale
---
Get members
---
Well done! Got lucky there.
---
Rsmalls
---
I think by the second time you get scammed you reach the point where you just don't listen to anyone about any kind of offer or physical trade that isn't through the ge.
---
First time it takes you to realize shitty are people and try to scam you.
---
Second time is when you realize scamming isn't always just trimming armor and asking you to say your password backwards or something.
---
because gear progression is needed to keep the game alive and feeling fresh?  i been using arcane now for 5 fucking years, how much longer you want me to use it???
---
Looks like a peepee
---
It is, you're triggered because someone else got more internet points than you for a lesser achievement.
---
shop mainly, other options are Slayer and RCing.
---
(using an iPad) Granted you can’t quickly drop granite between movements, so the exp rates are slower, but imho the benefit of leaving the desk is well worth the loss. 
---
You just have to toggle-drop every few moments.
---
No one uses magic gear for the defense bonuses, if they are it's due to a restricted defense build. But it's been that way for a lot for a long time and it hasn't really been a issue before.
---
They make you wear an amulet of acverice which skulls you, very common scam
---
Not saying you're lying, or that it wasn't false, just saying that wasn't the reason and you're dense as fuck if you think it was
---
I am 99% sure I will not.
---
But I seriously didn't bot. I can't think of what else would be macroing? I don't think I ever even auto clicked so idk it's the closest thing I could think of to what would trigger a macroing flag.
---
I mean full open world Ironman with increased xp rates so it's easier to do everything. Gonna be sad come mid January when everyone progress vanishes. I agree though that future leagues will most likely be awesome and I'm looking forward to those as well.
---
Yeah, as a whole osrs has grown and almost every holiday quarter has seen a brief drop in active players, going back or increasing after the new year.
---
Why would one have to beat the inferno to acquire every head slot item?
---
Piano. I started at age 20 and have done 6 month lessons with two teachers. Realistically I won't be able to sight read fluently for another 8 years which is when people start to become really really good.
---
5m if you put in settled discord
---
Leave it, let agil bots get stuck upstairs
---
If you want to get another bond within 2 weeks, rush smithing and farming and do herb runs and blast furnace.
---
If you want to progress your account and getting membership again won't be an issue, follow the osrs wiki's optimal quest guide for the first few dozen quests. Should take you a few days up to your entire 2 weeks, depending how much/how efficiently you play
---
Wrong and wrong. Reread.
---
ah yeah the classic "just skull and wear your tbow and make sure protect item is off and click this teleport item, oh and make sure you are in a pvp world" scam, gets em every time.
---
My brother tried using a bank organizer script from rsbuddy back in the day.
---
It logged in, opened his bank, collapsed all of the bank tabs he had, and logged out. Funniest thing I’ve ever seen on this game.
---
Psst, I know a secret that can get you a lvl 7 fc
---
5 more until you get to slap some attachement onto it.
---
no it is not, in f2p u have to eat around 30 because if they hit u a 25 with scim its hard to eat up again if they keep comboing you
---
Realistically it sounds feasible to make a script that would sort items into tabs and in specific order. Kinda sounds like a bitch of a script to make and that making it would be pretty convoluted and like a puzzle. But I’m sure someone really knowledgeable in script making could manage to do it. 
---
The script would probably have one main template it follows to organize everything though.
---
Oh just make a new Ironman mode then with a different name. They'd probably be the butt end of a lot of jokes, but I don't mind more game modes. Adds a shit ton of replayability to something that's relatively easy for how all encompassing the mode itself feels sometimes.
---
Infernal max cape hood
---
I wish most gas stations had all you can eat sushi  for reals
---
maxed thieving is probably highest irl gp/hr
---
I really just put that in there as a set stopping point, with any calculation involving probability as you increase your odds the number of trials increases exponentially. Also for this specific calculation I counted all of the Crystal's as primordials so it's actually a little more common if you consider any combination of 6 crystals.
---
That's why I'm trying to find a clan or a community for pking.
---
Join w345 basically no one in that anyways so it’s ironman
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
Yeah but if you get caught you gotta wait forever to go back to the grind.
---
I've considered the blessed swore I wanna way it's around 4% better dps wise than the abby dagger dragon defender combo. Haven't used it yet personally. May give it a whirl. Thanks dude.
---
If you sub through Google play cancel your subscription and set it up again.

Unfortunately that is where you are mistaken. Jagex didn't put those resources to tank the economy so that bots don't profit. They put those resources in to fluff the boss drop tables because somewhere along the lines they forgot how to make challenging bosses drop rare uniques that are 90% of the profit of the boss. Jagex is just shit at balancing. Source: recent polls so unbalanced they nerfed the proposed items during beta and then still didn't release one of them - and probably upon release they will nerf the 4 tick staff as well.
---
Great job! Farming will be my second 99. I love how passive it is.
---
I don't love the "magic scroll = bank notes" aspect. Not that bank notes make sense as monster drops to begin with.
---
Np. Bless
---
(1/(250*250))*100% chance, gj :D
---
Try not using the original client*
---
Yep, this is it. Just yoink whatever you can. Bail when they ask you to withdraw items on a pvp world and it's free money. Stolen 4 ZGS myself.
---
Fair enough. I've never used a blowpipe either (74 range)and didn't realize they needed to be pre-loaded with darts. I just assumed they worked like bows lol.
---
I keep getting “too many log in attempts, try again later” on mobile..
---
Who banks after only 7 kills??
---
Only under one condition: You don't have a life.
---
I’m really scared to play while im going on vacation in spain tomorrow because of this...
---
Tondor
---
Haha all good my dude. I think a fair compromise would be something like “javelin racks” where you take idk (5?) javelins, put em in a rack, then you can equip them in the ammo slot. Would work just like Karils xbow, and then you can simultaneously have both options to use either as 1 click to ammo or 1 click to mainhand
---
It already takes weeks (months) of daily trees, fruit trees, and herbs. Farming contract only would be frustratingly slow
---

---
worth the $11?  i don't get it.
---
How much money do I have to contribute to get a big dick rank so I can kick people I disagree with?
---
Yeah this, start over
---
How many KC does 99 herb take?
---
If the game is easy then you're just playing the easy content. Stop killing bloodvelds and corp.
---
pretty sure if u combined every combined ironmans clue completion, you still wouldnt get every 3rd age or gilded. it would take more than a few thousand, it would take literally hundreds of thousands of hours, if not a million+
---
Ooo
---
One of the niche range updates we need. I'm still waiting for longbow sights... maple longbow sighted was amazing in f2p pking. Bow switch to rune 2h was godly when the bow had near 100% accuracy. And in p2p the spec was a guaranteed k0 on any boss
---
dude I don't understand how you're not getting this. it already HAPPENED they knew it was a mistake and you're just rubbing it in. you saying this shit after it happened is literally useless, they already learned their lesson and if they make a new account or have another kid or whatever they obviously are going to be more careful so it doesn't happen again. I don't understand why I need to explain this to you I feel like I'm talking to a robot
---
People are usually selling bulk items on W2 too.
---
On drop rate 3rd age axe with ironmaning the masters is 58500 hours on its own.

"won't somebody think of the scammers?"
---
You can repost it next week
---
Yes it will
---
It’s similar to what Tedious does with his collection log series and there’s another YouTuber I can’t recall that does a similar thing.
---
What, no trees? Oh my goodness that sounds painfully slow
---
Is point boosting in Bounty Hunter against the rules or just frowned upon? I really wanna get a rune pouch but don't wanna spend too much time boosting points for one in Slayer when I could use those points for something else.
---
The fuck you on about?
---
I see why you're alone, only 84m xp 
---
Just kidding man I hope you have a great time during the holidays! If you want a cc to hang out in, check out Spot Drops
---
Good ways to make F2P money? What stats I should grind for F2P money?
---
A waste of Jagex time IMO. What value does adding this in to the game add? There needs to be a niche that it fits in to for it to be useful.
---
Thank you, SnugglewithStruggle, very cool.
---
Lol you think working full time is having a life
---
Saying that now we pay $11 if they had it/ working on it, it would actually be worth the price increase. It's sarcastic
---
At 21 you'd think it feels sad, but it doesn't.
---
Flair checks out
---
Nice! Booties for the varrock dog :)
---
Tertiary drops each rolled independently. Its 100% possible to get an elite clue, pet, visage, kbd heads, and a brimstone key (assuming on konar task) in the same kill. Its incredibly unlikely but it could happen
---
pretty sure it depends on what you do, especially if you're new to pvm, which op is. if you go in cox with bis gear and no knowledge, you ain't gonna do much
---
2\*50/50 chance

Evil fucking chickens were the strongest creature I encountered in the game for a long ass time.  I remember getting one in f2p by the karamja docks because it traumatized me.  I’m fishin lobbys and fighting lessers how hard can a little chicken be?
---
Lost some rune, lob pot, but most importantly my innocence.  Dying with the old death mechanic made you feel like shit as a little kid.
---
What a useless bot
---
Appeals are mostly done by bots. I always get a yes/no response within a minute...

[No, but this is close enough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-T104y9X8w&amp;t=25s)
---
Mr. smartass, if I said that my situation is far from that reality does it not make sense?
---
darth vader is lukes father
---
they wont risk 7+M on wizzy hats
---
But if you already have all requirements, this is the worst step, because all steps are equally doable all that varies is how long they take.
---
cocoon does one too
---
and maybe have a rare chance of like 1/250 to max your account and give you a tbow, just to keep people interested in the game.
---
This made me exhale air through my nostrils
---
Can’t watch now so maybe you mention in the video,  but what’s the average gp/hr of efficient corrupted gauntlet (including blade)?
---
He's level 6.75...
---
Yeah I figured. Cant quite afford tbow yet but I did recently finally buy dhcb and man is that a game changer for olm
---
First one has you go down that dungeon from Legend's Quest. Second is where you fought Kamil-- this one isn't too bad, but still a decent trek because of the cold. And finally, the third step has you going all the way through the shadow dungeon maze.
---
This is me.. its my account the appealing system is outdated, im giving correct information with dates... the day it got hacked though it got locked so the HACKER appral recovered it before me with information from my email only... I give other information from the account aswell as regular details yet I get denied...
---
They just ruined the game for you 'lol'
---
dont use the same email and password and u should be fine, but u should practice at lms
---
i fail to see where there is a situation where they can just afk resources all day to buy end game gear....
---
***~~yes but what are you on about~~***
---
I’ve never heard of him
---
Equally doable, yes, but not easily doable. OP’s clue requires backtracking to some awful quest locations, but other than having done the quests, that’s about it as far as requirements go.
---
ehp is having the cash to blow, basically with whatever the max method is for training summoning is what you would do.  i dont know if its still collecting blue charms and doing x task with x amount of shards, but ehp doesnt take into account the time to build wealth to do said task.
---
mobile 5 day free p2p infinite reclaim burst
---
twitch burst just increasing bots etc
---
we didnt grow that much
---
Had no idea blowpipes were medieval
---
The worst step is falo asking for a Fighter Torso
---
For those of us that just went straight for BCP its like a 10 hour grind and I aint about that, so that step is a clue killer
---
It got damaged during the shipping tho and you can see this one crack pretty obviously on this picture (look on the hood).
---
Here are close ups of 3 cracks I found + it says on the packaging that they fixed the package  [https://imgur.com/gallery/rrE3wpQ](https://imgur.com/gallery/rrE3wpQ)
---
What should I do? It kinda ruined it for me
---
yea but in all of them all it does is take 1 stamina pot, i would gladly do that 5 times in a row before having to do a damn hot cold step.
---
I would probs abandon an account over that lol
---
Without nmz i wouldnt pay 11+22$ a month because I wluldnt have alts
---
I'll be honest, I haven't seen anyone use javelins of any kind in so long that I thought they were still range weapons instead of an ammo type.
---
Here I am, thinking he would abuse some massive bug.
---
This guy is a fucing genius congrats.
---
Recovery appeals buddy not appeals on banned account haha I get to appeal by pushing on the sentence my account is hijacked..
---
BLESSED BY THE CHEST
---
Jikkit
---
I remember all of the videos of people failing Jad then breaking their monitor by throwing it into the street or smashing it with a hammer. Those times are long gone.
---
Sometimes you can see massive groups of people having some sort of clan wars or so, you can find it on youtube, just search for "Wilderness war F2P" or so... 
---
Actually it seems to be pretty lit.
---
Help them start their first collection of cheap obscure items. Could give them 50k buckets or 50k knifes (like you use for fletching)
---
Realistically, they will be cheap but you might want to start buying them now :)
---
Whatever you rebuild will just go to the arena
---
Imagine trying to steal a content creators thunder.
---
Well the FBI has no authority over the Mona Lisa so that seems reasonable.
---
appealing
---
I'm not new and i actually thought it was genuine and clicked "try ur luck" but nothing happened, it redirects me to osrs event page, I'm not sure how i didn't get hacked. I clicked it multiple times btw i thought it was broken xD
---
conveniencescape
---
Jeez someone with a brain here... No seriously not bad!
---
might as well give me ur gear and start a hc yeah
---
So it's possible to do it even lower combat level..
---
Is Torso worth getting? I'm 97 combat, total bank value is around 40m so BCP isn't really viable. Up to now I've played only on mobile and when I asked before everyone said BA would be horrible on mobile so I gave it a miss. I've now got a laptop I'm using so can try BA much easier.
---
I'm using obsidian chest atm.
---
Shit maybe I should go for it finally
---
Lvl 3 when?
---
Jesus Christ this doesn't fucking stop what the fuck has been happening
---
Because the stockpiles people have from nmz are finally finishing up and less people are bossing atm due to exams/Xmas
---
Or use your fucking eyes on the confirmation screen lmao
---
Oh my god I got that dragons eye clue and forgot about it. Finished legends quest, saw it right after and groaned because I had to go through it all again
---
Because it's not witch hunting and is also posted directly on this subreddit?
---
I can’t tell you how much nostalgia this brought me reading this. I remember being scammed there too and because it was so packed I couldn’t figure out his name once the trade was done because chat was moving so fast
---
Go for the hardcore.
---
What we're saying is you're not the owner, you'd be able to recover it else lol.
---
thanks for keeping the price of purple sweets consistently high by eating all of them, my clue scroll grind is a lot more profitable
---
wouldn't feel oldschool. I scammed obby capes here for days.
---
yes the clan chat system has a 150 total level requirement to stop low level bot accounts from spamming and harassing people
---
what if the fish pray range?
---
FFFFHH
---
Too bad its not skill innit
---
Support if it unlocks at agriculture instead of archery
---
Whatever makes the game easier
---
Yeah, like I'm gonna be upset he says that to me? Just shows what he's afraid of
---
Those rewards are for bh only. They locked wilderness slayer out of it.
---
aren't you that post malone dude that cried about not getting a golden gnome lol
---
people like you are the reason people hate backseat gamers.
---
spreading out the levels to atk and str would increase his combat level.
---
Nice
---
Well played, keep at it Rendi! Hope you'll find a way to get through RFD without all those XP dumps too.
---
King
---
Unfortunately for you, Kob has found a way to do this while staying at 1 prayer. Kob is going to be the first player to achieve the level 4 combat fire cape.
---
&gt;Also because no man of common sense wanted reorders + nobody in the pvp community wanted it, and it could barely get 25% no despite that.
---
a bit contradictory there, aren't we?
---
You mean the rat pits from ratcatchers?
---
I have to admit, I was one of those who thought you bug abused the 9CB Fire Cape. But damn it you’ve silenced us all! Great job and mad respect for you man!
---
It's not just 2 max hits.
---
The trident attacks at 4 ticks, while Iban's has a 5 tick attack.
---
Trident has a charged spell, meaning you can be on the arceuus spellbook to use the barrows teleport spell, saving around 1200 gp on barrows tablets. (if using house teletabs in their place)
---
Trident has a dynamic max hit so using a divine magic pot would further increase your max hit, as does levelling magic.
---
Meanwhile, Iban's staff provides more xp per cast - Spell cast xp (i think it's 30 xp per cast?) plus 2 xp per damage, vs trident's 2 xp per damage 
---
Iban's is cheaper per cast, but you have to recharge it every 2500 casts by going through the UGP.
---
So basically, with Iban's you save a bit of money at the cost of time.
---
ugh was gonna post this haha
---
Oh I said combat level didn't I? I just meant in addition to the way they do it now, they should add another key drop that scales with multi/wildy level, or even if the monster is in a cave eg: revs, fire giants, lava maze demons. I firmly believe that more risk should yield more reward. I like your idea about 30 wildy but it really makes no difference if that area is somewhere like hobgoblins with mobs to tag pkers off you.
---
Buying RS Gold through other ways than bonds is considered illegal; real-world trading.
---
Any Tips for another casual trying to get 99s? Combat in this game slides me and I feel burnt out a lot
---
Happy birthday homie
---
yeah, so dont release the 30 def armour set, i voted no?
---
Next week tune in for: *Fire cape without creating an osrs account*
---
Too bad I didn't say "part of" innit
---
I did that once myself when not of a normal state of mind, honestly took a couple of hours and the next day when I logged in I realized what a pain in the ass it now was lmao.
---
because there hasnt been a 30 def build, vote no next time to 30 def armour set?
---
I’m going for it for the first time in years , I think I’m continuing that tradition
---
I had 40 mining when I was doing WT. Did roughly 80 kc and didn't get any. Feels bad. Went back for 15 more kc at like 60 mining and still nothing. Cant make Portal Focus for Kourend teleport or Restoration Pool. I'll push to 50m Firemaking and If I don't get looks like I'll be grinding Lizardmen Shamans for a bunch of fangs.
---
I think it's asking for deze nuts in your mouthq
---
Black d hide would be best you could check yourself with bitterkoekje’s dps calculator
---
Given the circumstances, that was pretty innocent banter
---
im 99 and close to 99 on my btw myself ;) gz!
---
NEVER DOUBT THE RENDI 👌🏾
---
Your axe is shit and you're shit at chopping wood.
---
plugins must really be over spoiling you people if a couple dig here tasks that take a combined 15 minutes to accomplish is the worst master clue ever.
---
and I told you there is a difference to some random person saying it and someone who has the influence they have making it seem like its okay to do so. I for one own up to shit talking someone if I do so however I am not some social autist who whines because he didn't win an award.
---
On one monitor? Do you just resize each one very small?
---
Fucking A. You got me dude. It sounded like a fully fledged plugin. Or hell jamflexington could even come out with a patch like that. I think we are due for some sort of bank update.
---
If you're going to buy bonds with real life money then you may as well just buy gp from a site because it's way cheaper. Obviously you risk getting banned but just use an alt account to avoid getting banned on your main. I'm not saying that RWT is your best option but if you think I'm going to pay 7$ for a bond worth less than 5m then you're out of your mind. Fuck Jagex.
---
You'll never get punished or sued for that unless you're a gold site lmao
---

Back-mounted Ballista, running around in Blastoise Cosplay with +16 from the boots.
---
You'd be right if it was one person screaming it into the void, but it's not. It's a group of people on reddit egging eachother, and everyone else to act worse and worse, and attacking anyone who defends him, exactly like you just did to me.
---
Don't try to justify your behaviour by saying "WELL IT'S OKAY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL", this isn't an issue of who you are, it's an issue of what you're doing.
---
I play MOBAs and I still struggle with Jad. It's more of a mental challenge than a mechanical challenge
---
Bursting is good. I got 99 mage passively just bursting slay tasks on the way to 99 slayer
---
havent played rs in a while, why emblem drops were removed wtf
---
Holyshit congratulations mate
---
I can only imagine what your chair smelled like during this fire cape
---
i see nothing wrong here.
---
Well that didn't work for me, I ended up getting my credit card out and rip $2k real quick
---
No. It's called theorizing whether it be a basic thought or not. People like you sit back and watch scientist and engineers create great things while others contribute.
---
 Insert (hurdur you didn't contribute)
---
Lol, this has crossed my mind many times.
---
Song @ 6:30?
---
Probably just a couple more hours than it'd take with a fire cape. Maybe less
---
Strength is way more important than attack
---
Make sure your strength level is much higher than your attack (like 1.5x)
---
Kill chickens until you one shot them often
---
Kill cows until you one shot them often
---
Then kill hill giants until you get 99
---
Okay, I just equipped them again, and I see the confusion. I see the skirt you’re talking about, but it’s so small that I always assumed it and the thigh highs were just one and the same as a pair of leggings. I’m specifically looking for an item that more closely resembles the skirt seen in RS3 when you equip the Santa bottoms, although I’m thinking at this point that the RS3 item is all there is.
---
keep accusing people of bug abusing until you get it right?
---
Imagine thinking people telling you you're wrong is "hating"
---
Get over yourself.
---
I just changed my email and the email jagex sends doesnt say "cancel" it says "confirm change".
---
this is not possible any more because i bought out all the law runes from the ge sorry
---
So this is just you trying to get someone to give you a bond
---
from 2006-2013 I put in 3500 hours. Never did any pvp or pvm that was hard. My most stressful fights were quest bosses
---
Yes
---
Those poor place holders for my full Bandos, prims, lance, rapier.... never to be filled again....

Go to intel's website and find the video driver for your chipset, if you tell windows to automatically upgrade through control panel it will not work.

When is ring realistic to grind, combat wise
---
Why do people hate pures? I was born pure, i rolled the 1 on the dice. I cant change who I am.
---
I forgot how it worked and thought he was going to withdraw rings from the RoS
---
This is how bandos should be done...
---
It's actually efficient in a way, since you afked it means you were doing something else meanwhile (even if irl) also it'll be more efficient to do other things later.
---
I do not miss hearing this song in every RuneScape related video
---
He is probably more pissed about becoming a running joke in the community
---
There's been a lot of gold selling advertisements lately on reddit, I've been wondering what's up with that and how it is even allowed to show up here.
---
Good stuff Rendi, and I'm glad to say I can appreciate the tone of this video a lot more than some previous ones; a lot more focus on what you're doing and how you achieved it, with less time spent on the reddit comment bullshit. I hope you stay in that direction.
---
Well done KempQ
---
The guy literally said "people hate people like you" lol. I don't care if a bunch of RuneScape virgins downvote me for giving a suggestion.
---
It took me 10 attempts at 95 combat with full armadyl and a blowpipe, and this madman does it at level 9 with chewy tictacs and some blue rings. The dedication is incredible.
---
Wow another sub 100 clue piece of third age out of TL, hmmmmm
---
I will outchop any woman any day of the week
---
Legally, we're allowed to do this
---
Questing is the best way to go. As you’re doing it, you’re also exploring new areas in member’s world and interacting with new times. My suggestion is to do quests that will unlock new content such as the Herbalife skill.
---
I own a max cape, but no fire cape.
---
Most bosses are fine. If I die at Vorkath I just lose 100k and I'm back in there in a minute or 2 tops. And I can tank some hits if I mess up etc. But at Jad you have to do every move absolutely perfectly or you get 1shot and the past hour you spent going through the caves was a complete waste and you have to do it again

It's amazing how many people don't realize this. Most laws aren't specific for a reason, they can most certainly go after these sites for illegal activities and wouldn't be the first game company to do so.
---
There still is. But chrisarchieprods retired so we don't see them anymore :D
---
Used a piece of paper with a shitty ring drawn on it to beat Jad. Nice.
---
Imagine this from our characters perspective.. Tiny human carrying like 50kg armor on him and then has to drag around a giant bag with pots that he needs to somehow not break while fighting giant monsters that come at him nonstop.
---
And he has to drink and eat so much without even as much as getting a piss break, continue to chug potions and pray like a motherfucker all while dodging attacks and attacking back.
---
And then people like rendi makes him carry 15 truckloads of candy, sounds like a fun life.
---
Correct the bank will send you a new card, 
---
They won’t give you access to someone else’s account or even your own account if you can’t answer the security questions though now will they.
---
Uh yeah it is very true. Go sit at edge f2p for a min then p2p. See the difference in KOs
---
rs3 lvl 3 skiller is possible because of the necklace that deals damage to monsters, and heals you for the same amount every 15 seconds.
---
That was probably me.
---
Tbh I don't get why the current charging system works the way it does. To me it makes way more sense for the suffering to just go:
---
40x(recoil added) instead of
---
40x(recoil added -1) + (current recoil charge)
---
However I wouldn't want to see the system be changed now, specifically because of how it enables low combat fire capes.
---
Efficient team ToB is more Gp/hr than solo cox provided you're on drop rates.
---
Was it not a fake OSRS event page that needs you to “log in” to participate? 
---
That’s usually how it goes, a replica log in page which just sends your details to some basement dweller when you “log in”
---
And Twisted League
---
Lol. Doesn’t have to be anti-mage. It could be anti-range. Wouldn’t that be interesting. Haha

What’s your MOS?!?

How long until the technological boom and we're all running around with AK-47's spraying down sand crabs.

I for one don't want to live in that world, no sir.

E-sports teams actually regularly piss test for amphetamines.

But, ain't no money to be won here, just e-peen. If people wanna do meth, heroin, or just generally throw their lives away while breaking video game records, more power to 'em.

Ads are always getting smarter
---
PAO lol nothing high speed

I mean, yes. It's still going on for another full month.
---
I have gotten to the jad fight at least 20 times but my internet connection is bad enough that I almost always end up getting romped by a lag spike.
---
I have an idea to kill some 180's without poison. It is possible to tick-eat melee attacks using interface stalls. This can be done till the melee is half hp. From that moment onwards, he'll have a cycle of 2 melee hits and then 1 heal. He'll only heal himself if no other damaged NPC's are around him. Thus the strategy would be to interface-tickeat 2 melee hits, tickeat a NPC that's next to the 180, and then stand next to the 180 causing him to heal the other NPC instead. Repeat till he's dead. 
---
If poisoning all 180's but only having 40 prayer, it's still possible to get the cape on lvl 8 combat. You'd have 108 chances of 1/4 to poison with dagger, and 20 chances of 1/8 to poison with ranged, to  keep defence lvl 3 and all other lvls at 1. There are 34 lvl 180 NPC's. Chance to succeed on a perfect attempt is around 19.6%.

i think the fun part is where he calls the community shit, and then asks for help.

**WHICH I WILL NOW EXPLAIN**
---
I feel like one of the best ways to incorporate a Rendi tribute would be to include some dialogue in a new quest.
---
Have it be a continuation of the pirate series, and the player along with some NPCs has hauled up some treasure in a chest.
---
One of the NPCs could exclaim "arr, on this day we be truly blessed by the chest!"
---
Or something like that.
---
Fucking single fucking digit fucking firecapes
---
No they won't, but the guy I originally replied to was insinuating that not getting hacked is your responsibility and jagex don't have to do anything to help you, that is wrong (I didn't realize you weren't the original guy btw).
---
And as I said, it's impossible to know what's going on in this situation, people lie and jagex are known to consistently fuck up, so no point speculating who's right. Im simply pointing out the original guy's mistake.
---
Nope, half health is half health. That's why they have to kite the healers no matter how they do it.
---
Circa 2005 I was walking to Varrock through the south gate and some random traded me right in front of the sword shop. I must've been just under 40 defence at the time so the account was lowish level but the random gave me a full set of guthix armor and teled away.  I went and trained on guards til I could wear it and was happy as a clam. 
---
Then my irl friend told me it was worth 20k and bought it from me.
---
It's even better than the 1st one imo &lt;3 you can buy that one from the settled store :)
---
Everytime i open the game i can't login. I have to open the apps section in my phone and clear the cache to be able to play the game. Then when i log out for being idle to long i can't reconnect the game and have to do the same process again.
---
33.33 repeating of course
---
But it is partly your responsibility even with your example of the bank to look after your card. 
---
The banks don’t HAVE to give the money back to you.
---
Appeals for one account that got denied. Do you think /u/OgKurd has multiple accepted appeals for one account?
---
Best part of this video was the fact that Rendi finally realized he doesn't need to use the  C H E S T B R A H sound effect to make a good video.

Maybe resource icons will be handy and maybe decreasing the amount of rooms but that will be good enough to not need any crystal tele change.

I’m on iPhone so I don’t have that option, I’ve tried “offloading the app” but it keeps data so it’s not a option. I can run pc fine but when I’m afk I try playing at work on mobile as my pc is normally turned off so I can’t Remote Desktop
---
Its fantastic for slayer and mostly everywhere you’d want to melee. I also recommend using it on controlled so you get str xp
---
People walkin around in singles with max gear all the time my man
---
Atlatl and similar devices have been around for longer than bows and arrows. One of the images I used has one made out of modern materials, but the design is truly ancient.
---
*cries in iron*
---
I have such great memories of this one and all the aggresive random events. I remember luring bots on pest control island behind the bank and wait untill a random killed them to loot their stuff. Looked like this in the video: 
---

---
It is somewhat rare, but it shouldn't be tbh. Too many people ignore it even though it's amazing xp for how much time you invest. How does this make someone insane?? 10 minutes a day for this skill. You'll have 99 in a few months of consistently putting in negligible amounts of time and money. You even profit if you hit up some farming contracts &amp; herb runs.
---
multi combat in varrock died when f2p got tb. what the fuck are you talking about?
---
Wouldnt be nostalgic no thanks.
---
Those are two very different points though. It's fine to criticise when criticism is due but lumping all customer support issues together under the "non-existing support" label makes the problem seem bigger than it actually is. 
---
If the information that OP is sending is identical to that given by the hijacker when he initially recovered account , I can quite easily see why they would be hesitant  to flip a coin and choose a person at random. Having a support person that you can talk to wouldn't actually help you keep your account secure without proper security practice on the player's part. 
---
So yes, I do agree that any game of this scale should have a support team but it's also paramount for every player to understand that account security is their own responsibility first and foremost. The support team would merely try to help when all else fails(if it existed). If they are able to that is. If they can't tell who is who, even a fully equipped support team would be helpless.
---
Perhaps it would be easier to just label monsters low, medium, or high risk rather than trying to base on multi or wilderness level. But I do agree that more dangerous tasks could get better key drop rates, but to an extent that tends to be true already.
---
Your very careful to say you own the account, did you create it though?
---
This be me.
---
Maxed combat with no Firecape
---
Heck on RS3 i was nearly maxed all stats no fire cape
---
I chinned. Duo partner acb’d Kree whole kill. The. Heal on last two minions
---
The scariest bit out of all of that to me personally in terms of power creep is the range bonus damage. 
---
Range is already crazy powerful when compared to other styles, it doesn’t need a potential 3% damage buff not including the treat accuracy bonus it would gain from the higher stats.
---
Maxed isn't hard, it's just time consuming.
---
Fire cape is hard, for fairly lame reasons.
---
I never would’ve dreamed of getting this pet lol. Thank you
---
I got my fire cape when they gave out those 1 shot darts a few years ago
---
So how much did you buy the account for?
---
I didn't know lol
---
I’m level 95 with 88 range and 44 pray and I still can’t do it lol
---
I'm pissed that I got back into OSRS just after they removed the ability to indirectly buy the rune pouch by buying emblems via the GE. Now I have to do hours of slaying, or PVP (which I've never done in my life and don't plan to start trying).
---
Emblems need to come back
---
Were you skulled?
---
Ah fair enough, I’ve seen many phishing scams over the years and that’s definitely new one for me
---
I don't think that is the case, as Rendi has always pointed out dealing damage is required for a chance of 1/4 poison roll.
---
It seemed like every task I did ended up with me being rushed by someone with ancients. I dont understand how people were doing wildy tasks without getting attacked at least once a task.
---
Unfortunately, wildy slayer was not for me lol.
---
Yeah, go quest homie, then do some moneymakers with BARROW'S GLOVES.
---
Hmm, alright, you win this round!
---
Didnt they remove emblems to stop emblem farming?
---
Rwt quite possible from what I’m reading
---
True but 75% is a high barrier of entry. If 75% of people agree on something, that’s as close to consensus as you generally get in opinion polling.
---
I agree with the scroll unlock idea
---
What rates do you get having to stop to drop each inventory? You can powermine iron on mobile dropping without losing ticks for 73-80k/hr so it'd have to be more than that to be worth it.
---
Someone get summoning salt to do a video on the lowest combat jad progression lol
---
You are talking about about the same thing with not added information.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0XvTlWP6xw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0XvTlWP6xw)
---
This is for OP.
---
Yep thats right. The only magic trees I ever planted where inside the guild for contracts. Same goes for the other good xp trees. Only for contracts.
---
In 2119 we will definitely analyze the more popular internet memes to see how culture was back then
---
No lol.
---
-1/10 analogy
---
I got my jad pet my first time, all be it a slayer task, but it is possible.
---
Nope. I would have liked the video to be longer (although tbf there does seem to be less to discuss with this method).
---
Just use an autoclicker that clicks every 18-19min
---
To be fair, less profit, less pkers right?
---
Wether an item passes a poll doesn't matter, it's still up for Jagex to decide if they want. The poll is there to gauge what the community thinks and filter out any content that the community doesn't want. 
---
Regardless of what you think, most of the content creators (streamers/youtube) are playing either an Ironman account or have PvP content. Many of the items for the newer content have been balanced specifically for PvP as well and I don't think that's wrong.
---
Man this would depress me to get in TL and not OSRS, screw all that noise.
---
That'd be a no lol
---
KempQ raging irl
---
This is about as scummy as scammers get tbh. What's worse is, he's probably doing this to MULTIPLE people like you at the same time. So even though he only scammed 75m from you, he may be scamming 10 other people for 75m each at the same time.
---
cool, got mine at 63 :)
---
I used to lure noobs to the varrock wizards... Made some serious cash that way back in like 2005.
---
When you buy an account, make sure you have enough to cover bonds, bandos set and, of course, most importantly, that beautiful obsidian cape... Mr. "I wc for money".
---
I think this post shows it’s the exact opposite of running out of ideas.
---
Hey I’ve seen you around a lot haha
---
hmm, I haven't had any issues with it lately.
---
"... Perfected the art of noting bones"
---
Lol
---
I cant be bothered with this bullshit anymore haha
---
Is there an app update for you? I seem to recall one recently since the fix but I could be wrong.
---
Cuz when this was originally posted 2+ years ago mobile wasnt out yet lmfao
---
Didnt know
---
i like pvm like raids but that's pretty much it. id like pvp too if it wasnt the shitshow that it currently is as well.
---
Are you sure Rendi RWT? I thought he just sold infernal capes
---
Just drop the clue my dude
---
but mobile data was lmfao
---
Everyone's skill is different. If you feel like you can solo, then try it. Not like you have much to lose.
---
I gotchu fam, it's /r/BoneAppleTea
---
Would pick tob over cox anytime, more engaging bosses, no scouting and trios are efficient
---
I never said it wasn't a problem? You outright said their art is bad, not problematic.
---
Speak for yourself. Seems most people here have enjoyed the video besides you and a select few.
---
So many things can be considered bugs that so many people do every day. Like pray flicking or corner safespotting (use the mechanic that npc's will walk east-west before walking north-south which gets them stuck)
---
this, make sure to collect or buy all the wealth you can so when it gets recovered the scammer will be happy
---
Thank you for the kind words buddy but it’s my fault. I should’ve known? Idk I just have faith in people and it burned me. 
---
The time spent making that money and subsequently lost is what sucks the most.
---
Lol you’d trust some fuck wit on RuneScape? People are serial killers who act normal all the time and you wouldn’t even know it 
---
Keep to yourself
---
Wouldn't it be third best? Tentacle whip is better, and Rapier is better than Tentacle whip.
---
2-2.5m ph at that time now max is somewhere in the realm on 1.8m
---
New Karamja content? I'm in. I like new quests.
---
Feels bad man. I’m here for you.
---
No no I’d never lol. Funny thought though.
---
pretty sure those don't mean much since they're sold in packs?
---
They could fix it by just adding 40 charges to the RoS for every noted recoil you add to it, while leaving the charge on your unnoted recoil the same. That said though, this is amazing and I hope they leave it alone.
---
Mine's Baltor, which it was on RS3 as well. I assumed since I got the same one both times that it was everyone's.
---
"most cutest"
---
This bothers me.
---
😂😂
---
A master thief isn't going to have a problem hiding their tracks though. We're talking the absolute limits of human ability when it comes to thieving, hence master.
---
Add me though: 
---
Girthy Dad
---
*Decent humans only though*
---
How and when were they changed? I use then regularly and they don't feel any different
---
Thanks for making my day lol
---
ya know, I never thought of using that as proof.   Do you ever look through the pictures for fun lol
---
This is going to be a perpetual issue for all types of low-tiered equipment. 
---
Bronze-Mithril equipment is a short span of levels that you pass through so quickly you can often skip multiple tiers of equipment until you hit level 20-30 and can use mith/addy.
---
Either we all agree that bronze-mithril equipment is basically low-level garbage and we probably don't need to worry about changing it. 
---
OR
---
We decide to make some changes to the way low-level ammo and equipment works. 
---
I prefer the former.
---
Yes it's like two dopamine rushes for the price of 1
---
Not less time, less than a couple hours
---
Got the rangers, got the placeholder.
---
could be wrong but pretty sure it has something to do with engine... and we all know what that means
---
Literally doing this right now. Remote desktop while I head to the hardware store for a better snow shovel.
---
Honestly? It's such a small thing that I sincerely can't think of a situation where the method could be used maliciously
---
What 3rd age is this? Doesn't look familiar :(
---
all they need to do is just make a mage equivalent to bow and scythe and probably some new melee/mage gear that is degradable like you said. ranged doesn't need anything.
---
No he's not and you don't need to be a dick. The guy literally said "obby till 94 hp" Then what? That's what OP is asking about.
---
So - then what he explained, dharok is your next step after obby.
---
Lit
---
Ah I see, yeah I could believe that
---
Had a guy add me at GE when he saw me with tbow, this guy legit tried 2 months long to get me into pvp worlds to "anti lure". Knew what he was up to from the start. That guy also went into talking about all kind of personal stuff an shit.
---
I did that. It takes forever and you still have to take a few hits and deal some damage
---
Mets legend. My girlfriend loves his butt
---
Meanwhile I have never done Monkey Madness in my 14 years of playing
---
Tob is best money in the game
---
100% 
---
Literally unplayable
---
Manners dear boy cost nuttin
---
we thought the onyx was tied to chaos rune prices, in reality the chaos runes are tied to onyx prices : )
---
And your basis for *that* is?
---
White - food
---
Green - 🅱️oison
---
Yellow - hop worlds
---
Rangers are 1 / 1333, not sure where you got the 250 from?
---
That sounds like a great idea to fix the issue
---
lol i actually liked this meme.take my upvote
---
Haha ty. He's got a friend somewhere looking for you I'm sure.
---
damn that scams so old im surprised people even still remember it lol
---
Inb4 mod smack down ;)
---
Lmao, can't believe that happened again. You think they would have learnt their lesson by now ffs.
---
finallysomeonegotthejoke.thankfuck
---
Send me nudes Nd I'll send you bond
---
nice
---
Just wait until eingnod recoil and supplies for it skyrocket because of this
---
No jebaiting horny boys this xmas sir.
---
Jebrim is that you?
---
When you come back I’ll be here bb.
---
I’ll add you after work.
---
What bosses are taking you 10-12 hours to learn for a handful of kills? With 90+ in all combats he should be able to handle 3 kc of any boss in significantly less time than that even if he’s never done them
---
... you are dense aren't you?
---
Polls do matter, they keep the shit out of the game. 
---
Whenever the community votes no, Jagex shouldn't be adding that content to the game. However, if the community votes yes, they're still allowed to tweak it, remove it or keep it for another time.
---
Being rude to anyone that disagrees with you isn't the way to go, trust me.
---
had it in my mouth
---
I have no idea either
---
Yeah seems if it does I can easily unlock it anyways ty
---
That’s perfect so tyvm
---
Press F in the chat. The Christmas spirit got the best of me boys.
---
Yeah that’s my worry but as long as I can unlock it idm tyvm!
---
NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS!
---
His logic isn't recursive.
---
So how do you think this could be fixed? I think they fixed the Zulrah issue by making it so you could convert the uniques to Zulrah scales. Could something like this work for Zalcano o.o?
---
Unfortunately he 100% ghosted me. The timing of it was all the evidence needed.
---
Ten Hail Marys and all is forgiven my child.
---
well you got rid of him for 30 usd
---
Make sure your account is secured properly if you gave him personal info.
---
Only 2 torches? Trash
---
1/1333 per item slot / 5 (ish)
---
Patch it and seal his 9cb cape forever? Not gonna happen lol.
---
I should just join a CC
---
Why the hell would he get banned for this? Obviously it's not an intended mechanic but it's not bug abuse and the only use cases is having more recoil rings which is only useful for low level bossing. Which low level bossing is not practical for any kind of wealth gain so what's the point?
---
Yeh i agree, there is no disagreement here. How is this related to jagex scratching an item  that passed the vote though?
---
Now do it until you get a Jad pet. You won't.
---
Check the official forums, theres a clan section there.
---
What what
---
No it stays at the same prayer level because hes flicking it somehow. Idk why im being downvoted. If someone can explain how hes flicking while tick eating and forcing jads attack with out the curser ever going to quick prayer do enlighten me.
---
Unless he was doing the same thing at the same time with like 100 other people. Mad cash $$$
---
It wasn’t good
---
Untrimmed slayer is harder
---
I think if you up the drop rate to 1/500 or more than it might be a good fit. As of right now that low drop rate is a kind of op.
---
also another tip when harvesting herbs and allotments i’d you click continuously for like 2 seconds it will pick crops 2 per game tick.
---
We went back and forth like that a lot actually.
---
/r/ihavesex
---
Love when you talk to me like that.
---
What does me doing the hard content have to do with anything and why would you think I haven't done it? However, I can tell that you haven't done it since you think said hard content is a big deal.
---
What a world of difference
---
I don't plan on clanning or PK'ing but if I did it would be with big risk as I can afford it. The purpose of the account is to have a more challenging PVM build without total gear restriction.
---
It's being talked about literally non-stop, and it's not botters, it's venezuelans.
---
well damn I thought it was 30, yeah well I'm considering the jump to 30 so long as inquisitor works out being worth it.
---
unfortunately once it's on the internet it remains there so i will continue to laugh at him and his lack of golden gnome
---
ok boomer.
---
RuneLite isn't down, it just has reduced features until the devs update it. It says so right there in the image.
---
Glad u asked I'm in the middle of making a zerk myself
---
Dalton
---
goddamn it.. maybe should stay at 20 over 20 then...
---
Can we get a compilation of all the fire cape posts, videos and G.E. spots. I think it would be a cool historical document.
---
Blood amulet of fury
---
teleports to those slayer masters are already rewards for elite karamja and kebos diaries respectively.
---
That's a good one! Check out this one I made just now: [https://i.imgur.com/0zMGMigl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0zMGMigl.jpg)
---
My buddy got scammed an Ely and a Tbow off a guy he knew on osrs for several years.
---
some people have these things called jobs, where they have to go somewhere and work
---
inb4 someone 1-ups you and does an 8 cb fc
---
That's not a horrible idea honestly. The 10% chance of repeating the previous task isnt bad, but it definitely lacks the reward of mastering a slow skill.
---
Construction for sure. 82. Gives you the best pool. Agility is always nice and cost no money
---
Nice video and congrats! I wanted a Zulrah kill for elite void.  First try i got her down to 5 hp and then hit 0 for like 20 seconds straight until i died. 8 attempts later i got her down. Decided I’ll just do Dragon Slayer 2 and Vorkath for money lol
---
Inspired by [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ebditg/9_combat_fire_cape/fb43wqs/).
---
He WAS a bud was kinda expecting reimbursement later on.
---
How about ability to merge slayer rings with the cape? Get those teles and whatnot.
---
its like you know when low level ironman you need to run everywhere, thats all
---
Haha yeah.  I don’t like making statements like “I’m 100% sure” unless it’s like an actual fact.  This low level firecape business is a work in progress.
---
Your prescripted drugs usually do not cause any inconvenience. However, if it's found out you're taking more than your prescription or taking other drugs that are not prescripted to you, then you can face some problems.
---
I've heard people rebuild from vork. It gets monotonous. I've never heard people say, "I've had so much fun going to Vork for 1k+ KC to rebuild!"
---
Edit: a word
---
sure or 2 bonds, so I can pay with Ingame farmed gp to afford such a change for my account.
---
When you comment some cringy shit without even reading the rest of the comment you replied to.
---
Range attack in launched from NPC, game calculates damage it should do based on your max HP. Player eats and goes over the amount of dmg the attack could possibly do before he ate, so the attack can't actually kill him.
---
This does not work in PVP.
---
My dad left for cigs and never came back.
---
Unless it was contract no. I farmed a few calquats and teaks at mid 90's when I was aiming for my pet. But I got it soon after at lvl 95, so I kinda forgot about em.
---
full support, love the idea, another idea though is to give a really low level one like level 10 and a high level one for say 50 ranged, this would give it more consistent use
---
additionally to give javelins more use, there really should be more monsters that drop them and add a second second that sells javelins up to say mithril somewhere
---
Per inv slot isnt the problem. Its that he wastes ticks that could be used to attack by healing himself instead
---
No, RWT is the trade of non runescape items or services for runescape items or services. Selling account sharing related services for rsgp breaks an entirely different rule.
---
He obviously sells the gold from the capes though.
---
What I do is turn on Increased performance mode and integer scaling, and then set resizable scaling to 100.
---
Except it's "sit" cuz u get rekt
---
Downvoted because this video did not feature a “c h e s t b r a h”
---
Reeepost
---
I couldn't even scam someone I just met a twisted bow
---
That’s wild... yo can I borrow 75m?
---
Lol, he does have a life. These videos make him a lot of money.
---
You have to imagine leveling up the rest of his combat levels will be a whole hell of a lot easier with a Fire cape
---
Man this whole lower combat level fc grind is going to be so sad when it goes. To think this might be the last video we get of this competition between big brain 2000IQ youtubers.
---
Imagine making a meme and then miss-spelling "stealing" big yikes
---
If someone assumes being online friends means lending each other mils I probably wouldn't be their friend. I don't care how poor I am in the game, I personally would never ask for a loan or assistance of that manner. If you get mad at me for not lending any amount of gp, bye bye "online friend". The game is very much playable without pressuring people into helping you...
---
How is salamander better DPS than Iban's? It's an attack speed of 5 with a lower max hit unless you can boost above 100 Magic, at which point you should definitely be using trident anyway. Is there some hidden mechanic I'm missing?
---
I got My OG account unbanned after ~5K days, only to have it hacked within a day and I got turned into a dicing bot... rip My og log in name. I feel like theres Some Old ass database leak out there
---
I like you.
---
Do you have the mental capacity of a brick? You need to do the hard content to know how hard the game is. I have an infernal cape and have had two duo scythe drops, jesse141296 on the high scores. Even still, I know the top level stuff in the game is still too hard for me because I've yet to succeed in it. Pretty clearly I can form the opinion that the game is hard as fuck. You can't kill blood velds and expect the game to be difficult you absolute cinder block.
---
Could it not be made shared, the elite rewards for those diaries are useful outside of the teleport.
---
Punishment
---
Insane
---
Panico paura?
---
Im glad you agree!
---
It's a lesser offense. Lots of people got a slap on the wrist for buying infernals
---
Huh?
---
I was you until I looked up a simple youtube guide. Don't be intimidated, it's actually easy in practice. 
---
As someone else said, do the quests that give you farming XP first. It's a good kickstart to leveling
---
You must be braindead then mate, and a spastic.
---
The steepness of a difficulty curve can be a game problem, or a matchmaking problem. It can then add to the problem of nobody new wanting to get into pvp. He also isn't the only person who's been saying this idea.
---
sure buddy
---
It could be worth doing because DHC is very strong against KBD (500k-1m/hr), Vorkath (1m-3m/hr), Brutal Black Dragons (1m-1.5m/hr), skeletal wyverns (500k-1m/hr) and then obviously regular dragons. The only thing however, is that wherever DHC shines, DHL also shines and in most cases performs better as there's no cost to use it compared to high level bolts with DHC.
---
jw but where did they post that?  it's not on the osrs homepage
---
I completely agree but it wasn’t necessarily a loan. We had been playing and using each others items back and forth for weeks and I had a few things of his I was using and of course after building trust he skated off into the night. He stole my heart.
---
Can confirm, there are lots of Venezuelans at zalcano
---
Honestly, not a bad idea. It would somewhat devalue the eternal gem for those who've already reached 99 potentially?
---
I can't believe the first Mets reference I've ever seen on this sub is about Joe Panik... and his cheeks
---
Absolutely. Add me.
---
Absolutely; and we see the same kind of motivation criticised in TV and film today. When decisions made not to improve the product; but simply to reach a wider audience or a previously untapped market - that's what vexes people.
---
But that might be actually true at least on some level. If I remember right, first npc to run in RS2 was Nomad in Nomads quest in 2010.
---
Just wasn't funny or relevant in any way.
---
Just google 'Appeal a ban osrs' --&gt; Appeal a ban and will take about a week or so for a response. Any accounts that have been banned maybe 3-4+ years have a solid chance to get unbanned.
---
Most of my time would most likely be spent at vork, maybe do some chambers.
---
Im a hard core player but havent been on for two weeks due to essays and finals ... its been rough
---
goodluck, damn that's bad. Only .12% to go that dry, congrats you are almost 1/1000 lol.
---
actually memes are a really interesting study in human communication because encoding the message with a particular image that is mutually known ensures that the mood/tone of the message is successfully communicated.
---
In our day and age where it's harder and harder to decode the tone of a message, a meme makes it INSTANTLY clear how the sender feels about the message.
---
Yes, i miss it in the 2008 days!
---
How do YOU know?
---
"Jagex account support"
---
Yup that theres a fake. Dont click nothing on that email
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one! 
---
Worrying to hear it's been going on for so long with no resolution in sight though 😣
---
Doublecheck that the url is https://runelite.net/
---
I don't know if it's still the case but there used to be an ad on Google for a fake runelite that appeared above the read one.
---
Quest cape no guides. You will learn a fuckload
---
I think people forget that magic is a utility skill whereas ranged is pure damage, magic should never come close to range in dps.
---
Bwanar
---
Btw if u have dhcb, ditch the warhammer. U dont need it.
---
If it’s straight GP then def Wildy is the best for you. I’m working on a herb sack so I want the points but also make some money so Konar is good for me. I also like to relax a little with slayer and wildy you can’t do that depending which task you get.
---
I thought they had it a while back and it was getting lots of people banned for modified clients
---
I let a guy borrow my dwarhammer for a bit and we talked and he was p friendly. Then I told him I was going on vacation and he asked to borrow my tbow while I was gone.
---
I obv said no and then he got super pushy and asked if we're not friends and shit lol. Absurd the lengths people will go to scam, def tryna prey on someone who's socially awkward and might actually give it to them.
---
Youve clearly never trained slayer efficiently lmao
---
Bursting dust devils is good on task or off. You make your rune cost back and its roughly 110k+ xp plus a hour
---
Yeah I mean he scams people, I would assume he isn't taking a stand against rwt.
---
I play rs; I don't trust myself to not get a gambling addiction.
---
Rsgp isnt intellectual property lmfao
---
Dang really? I was hoping you'd said konar I'm not a fan of hanging in the wildly for too long
---
He could buy the gold for that amount. He is doing it for that amount of money.
---
Still doesn't change the fact that rendi is a whiney self righteous bitch
---
No more shops. No more drops. It’s like reverse ironman, you can’t progress WITHOUT other players. I like it.
---
I’m with you on this one chief. They can add HD graphics without changing any core game mechanics. It’s a win/win.
---
The fact you didn't just shrug and admit you made a suggestion without thinking it through tells me you lack emotional security and maturity.  No, just get all defensive about it instead.
---
Thank you alot! I already got a sara sword and some rings and a regen bracelet. Also have a dragon cbow and blowpipe. Thinking of doing a whip and a d defender. 
---
Is training def with range a good option or are there better options besides that and quests?
---
Your comment was even worse, gaylord
---
Giving a shoutout to your biggest competition without making it seem like an e-peen thing, mad props on that.
---
Yes, the client was called "OSHD" and lasted for 1 hour

I'm surprised more people don't realize this

He might have gotten hacked, that thing seems to be happening with some people more than others a lot more now. Just saying, it's a possibility.
---
The friendship was the scam. He said he’d trade me back and he ALWAYS did. So I had no reason not to.
---
70 defense, iban's blast, a barrows piece or two for tanking.

Yeah, i wanted to lvl up a new pure to learn more pking. Was supposed to playing with friends but they dont really play that much so I need more solo content.

Yea there’s always other possibilities.

How much action you get with that name?

the update today was strictly to fix 2 tick skilling method w/ autocast

It would be gorgeous to have. I'm not seeing the issue with ut

Oh okay so you choose to focus on the one sentence in my comment that wasn't 100% correct rather than the 9 other sentences putting you in the dumpster? Yeah, I'm really taking the L over here.

No, two step is working. But if they have access to your email then they can just disable it... You need to set up 2-step on your email as well.

Not with that attitude you aren't, believing in yourself is the first step in your Spitshine_my_nutsack influencer brand.

If you know how to use 2FA effectively you'll never have an issue.  Don't use gold farming sites and you won't have an issue.  Learn how to secure your accounts yourself.  This is 2019, if you don't know how to handle your shit on the internet Jagex will not be able to do anything to help your dumb ass.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 Your boring ass posts make you come off as a whiny insufferable child.  You've got like 5 people who think you're still funny and 200 up-voters who, like you, are apparantly to stupid to research online account security for more that 5 seconds without getting confused and giving up.
---
check out Theoatrix video on youtube, he does a sick job covering barb assault.
---
Exactly. Runelite/OSBuddy can do it without changing the game. I mean we have toggle for everything now, besides HD =(
---
He could do it with 40 prayer as well.  You would need to spread out exp in Range, Attack, Strength, and Defense.  170 exp exp in Attack + 80 exp in Strength + 170 exp in Range + 170 exp in Defense puts you at 2 Attack 1 Strength 2 Range and 2 Defense while also keeping you 8 combat.  It would also put you below the 544 exp needed to kill the 180s but you would need insane RNG to do it.
---
So you're shitposting until "customer service is good", as if that's ever going to happen, or as if you can even objectively say what single update would fix it anyway. So childish and annoying
---
So? Having a large following still makes you human.
---
&gt; this guy legit tried 2 months long to get me into **pvp worlds** to **"anti lure"**.
---
LOL
---
I'd recommend only having your strawberries for going up the waves. Eat when you've got something safespotted so you aren't competing with any DPS.
---
Bring your highest healing item- that'd be sharks, anglerfish, manta rays, or brews for Jad healers. Bring like... 2 or 3. ONLY EAT THEM at Jad. You shouldn't have an emergency you need to quickly heal out of on earlier waves.
---
Also here's a guide on enemy pathing: https://youtu.be/i6TrEcZ8XoI?t=137

I linked the little lifehack I mentioned earlier, but the whole video has tons of information that makes understanding the fight caves a lot easier.

Konar is still really good! Don’t get me wrong but if you want fastest GP it’s going to be wildy...Konar you’ll still make a lot...keep at it
---
Idk... scumbag or not, whether or not he makes you angry, this dude deserves respect. A month dedicated to a scam and it paid off.   
---
Idk what is a more fitting reference here: "Truth is, game was rigged from the start." or "He played us like a damn fiddle"  
---
fr tho, this is why no matter how much you trust someone never let them borrow more than you're okay with losing. sorry you had to learn this way.
---
Okay I'm just gonna stick with konar since its safe thanks for the advice!
---
From what I remember, 4+1 is the best gp/h but that might be outdated information now. Hopefully someone here can correct me
---
Depends on who's doing it, reddit would fucking hate if someone like Sparc Mac did or Odablock used it and would cry bug abuse but because it's Rendi it's all G.

Ahh yes, smelly hobos begging for money have more dignity than people stealing pixels in a medieval cookie clicker game. You sure about that? You REALLY sure about that?

I’ve played this game for god knows how long and I have never received a champion scroll. I is much sadness.
---
Thank you

Maybe you should take rendimentos comments to heart.  I genuinely think he is correct on this incident.
---
How it breaks down: Larran Keys average 108k, Brimstone Keys average 72k. (Making Larran's give 1.5x money) Konar comes with the option of Slayer Superiors for a 1/1k on average Superior dropping an Imbued Heart for 21m; Larran Keys have a 1/256 of being a 3m, 9m or 12m DagonHai piece. 
---
Now, the real value: fewer task options, more Slayer points lets you pick your ideal tasks more often. Almost all Wilderness tasks are cannonable. And Wilderness allows for use of the Wilderness Weapons for A LOT more damage. tl;dr - 1/200,000 creatures chance of 20m, or much faster kills for 150% the money.
---
Holy shit this guy is insane
---
remove pvp worlds and the problem is fixed
---
You're not doing the skill wrong by the sounds of it. Daily fruit trees, calquat, hespori, hardwoods (3.5 days), celastrus are some of the best options, but you have yet to unlock most of these options so keep doing what your doing. The only thing you've done wrong is not train this skill until you needed it. Farming is some of the best EHP in the game at 10 minutes a day. It's fantastic xp, but you need to chip away at it you can't level the skill whenever you want to without Tithe Farm. If you want to break the bank a little, start doing yews at 60 to speed it up. What drives me crazy is seeing all these high level players with noob farm levels because it is such a useful and passively profitable skill with decent xp rates. I've been playing OSRS since September and hitting 89 farming this week with minimal time. I recommend continuing to invest in the skill even after 70. You'll unlock spirit trees and increase profit gained from contracts (when you get to hard ones) and herb runs.

he was sick putting out content and thought his content was better than swampletics especially after self-weighting his content based on him being sick.

Incorrect advice is not a contribution, it's only more white noise to spend time ignoring. Giving shit advice is worse than not trying to "contribute" at all
---
I keep seeing people picking what slayer task they want from Konar in videos, but I have no idea how to do it or if it is a slayer point reward. Getting real sick of Hellhound tasks. How does one unlock that reward?
---
2 Tick manipulation apparently.
---
Honestly the efficiency / sweaty tick manipulators of osrs disgusts me and this is coming someone whos maxed. Like chill the fuck out, it's a game
---
Tbh, hard clues back in the day took me longer to do than master clues now. But since I've never done master clues without runelite, this is by far the worst master clue step there is.

do u remember the guys name? I wonder if its the same guy

Having a large following should mean higher responsibilities as theres potentially people looking up to you. Especially if youre posting from an account that has a large following instead of an alt account.
---
What are you most hoping to get from the chest? Curious what an iron desires the most.
---
Also, can we get rid of THE FUCKING BANKER STANDING BEHIND THE CLOSED BOOTH SO I DON'T RUN OUTSIDE THE BACK EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME AAAAAAAA
---
On f2p I’ll be dead by the time
---
Well, without knowing your skill level or what the content looks like, who knows? Personally, I would welcome it.
---
Because it gives a real world money value to gold that can't be price controlled by jagex? I'm sure there is a more specific thing you are getting at.
---
It's not plugins that are spoiling people, it's the abundance of teleports. It's not like looking up a location on the wiki is so much slower than the runelite clue plugin. It's just that these 3 steps specifically are annoying to get to because it's a longish walk from a teleport. Oh and the items for the legends quest cave one, I always seem to forget one.
---
The lowest before all this hype, was around 36 or 37, which was done as one would normally tackle the fight caves (as you stated).
---
I fail to see how you could interpret this as an attack at their integrity. I'm just simply wondering if this is going to be or was, addressed, especially given they said they would be better at keeping the players in the loop about these things last week. I'm genuinely curious if I just missed a Jmod reply somewhere, or what's up.
---
Sorry if I hurt your feelings.

Hes doing a very hard (used to be the hardest thing in runescape,not really anymore) at an insanely low combat level. Its like the equivalent of a baby completing a couse on Thermodynmaics.

Nah it brings you to 1hp, if you've got 10hp left it will do 9

You know what? You're right. Going to the bank as we speak to mortgage my house to invest it all in my influencer brand.

Hahaha Jesus Christ that is so fucking pathetic

The issue is unfortunately the OSHD plug triggers Jagex’s botting software and you get banned for using it
---
Consider buying mems as opposed to doping

Just wanted to thank you for having a realistic view on the polls and not just jumping on the easiest scapegoat
---
Jesus Christ your post history is pathetic lmao
---
He also had direct involvement *with* the bug as he thought he could use the rollback thingy to his advantage for a "Lower the Better" video. He's *the* reason why there was that big dupe in the first place.

Fuck dude you're not helping me quash my fear of commitment.

Not to be a dick, but you can’t afford to buy a bond/mems for $7-$11 as opposed to asking someone to give you money?

Skilling really needs a "slayer" esque skill which gives good rewards. If not an actual skill at least a mini-game that accomplishes the same thing.

---
1) Jagex will probably add a delay at some point
---
2) Someone has to find your email, match it to your "best" osrs account. Then they have to crack your osrs password (a lengthy process, usually).  Then they have to guess your email account password, assuming that you have more than two brain cells to rub together and you didn't use the same password for both, this takes even more time.  Then they have to log into your email and keep access to it for long enough to get the email to allow them to disable the authenticator, log into the osrs account, steal money/change passwords/whatever their intentions are.  They have to do all of this without you noticing what's going on, and without you seeing a "suspicious login" notification for your email address which has also just been hacked.  Then, after all this, you can still get your account back even if it gets banned.  
---
Yeah, given how unlikely this is to happen, without a person providing their osrs credentials to questionable 3rd party services such as botting clients, gold buying, and ingame services like jad/bossing/etc, yeah, it's not the biggest fucking problem to the game.
---
He RWT a ton of gold as a rising YouTuber. Admitted it as well. After talking up his firecape series so much, memes are the least we can do.
---
kempq has been around long enough to know that when you get busted for rwt you are exiled from the inner community
---
idk about that, the karamja diary has pretty low reqs, 86 runecrafting is rough sure, but its not terrible (assuming a +5 stew boost)
---
Yes it’s very good that he got it out of the way early in his account’s progression

Sorry to hear that man. I often say "people who get scammed deserve it" not because I'm a dick but because of the stupid shit people fall for, and I expected this to not be a difficult scam to avoid at all. Reading what happened though, that's just shit, and I feel bad for you.

with how they rebalanced ice and theiving all the rooms are fine.

the only bad layouts (skip worthy) are 5 combats, 100% of 4cs with a rope, or with a crab room are worth doing if you are not scouting on an alt account.
---
vespula is the fastest room bar really rng tekton. vangs are one of the fastest with top tier gear/drop combat pots to make up for their slower speed with lower tier gear. a big issue with vangs is that people do not know where to stand/do not use the proper weapons - the melee and range vang should be meleed with scythe&gt;rapier&gt;hasta&gt;lance, the mager should be BP'd. you should be able to straight dps down all the vangs in a standard 3/4 man without halting any dps.

Zalcano is what we get when people need Skilling to be as profitable as pvm
---
I think Skilling should be consistent afk money, it doesn't have to be insane / hr becuz the effort is low
---
With DHC and the low respawn rate of KBD, yea 500k-1m/hr is easy if you can get 25+ kills/hr as his average loot is 24k per kill including uniques
---
From what has been said by jagex they dont have those assets anymore as it was outsourced.
---
It was polled once before, with a stack cap of 5 i think, and it failed. The reward caskets being stackable passed though.. so i really dont see stackable clues ever passing.

Eh. Most esports dont lol. Unless u mean the org themselves and even then most dont. Its expensive

200k for 2500 casts is definitely not worth it unless you can make that 200k back in like 5-10 minutes.

I never did the tutorial quest I just skipped. It’s incredibly hard to die to low lvl mobs dude they deal like 1/100th of your hp per hit.

new staff passed. which makes surge+staff+tome bis dps for places where your magic level isnt boosted, or for players who have lower magic levels - ex, can overload/imbued heart for surge but arent 99 magic for trident max hits.
---
pages are relatively rare- like, for example if you were an ironman you'd have to do deep post99 xp to sustain tome for a while for pvm- they were only cheap because relatively few people actually use them- was mostly a low/mid level barrows/kraken thing.
---
Do you not think following so many players enjoying getting involved with TL that this could get a lot more support this time around? Do you
---
happen to know the vote % last vote?
---
Other workarounds they've done from that same Q&amp;A:  
---
* Turning an NPC into a projectile. They use this in My Arm's Big Adventure when My Arm punches people across the screen on Karamja
---
* Teleporting the NPC 2 tiles every tick. The pestilent bloat does this, since he has a fixed path so it's fine to just teleport him and give him some animations to make it look like he's running

if you have kandarin hard done you can stay at seers, however I'd still suggest timing your xp/hr at pollnivneach- depending on how attentive you are it can be better xp/hr.
---
Oh I thought you meant the two were connected. That's weird.
---
*stares in eastern europe*
---
The major difference is that stacking clues devalue clues overall.  TL doesn't matter because it's temporary, and more importantly pure iron Man mode, so it wouldn't affect the economy.  It got shot down in the polls because it would be too good.
---
And I'm someone who loves doing clues and has the clue relic in TL.  Stacking clues do not belong in the main game.
---
Scorpion capture!

Super easy quest and gives 6.6k strength xp. I'm surprised no one else has said this.

---
KempQuien
---
I do agree with you on this. I haven’t played TL personally but I feel with people already dealing with stackable clues in TL, they may be open for it. I do think it should be locked behind requirements like you were saying so you had a reason to grind your stats prior to collecting clues. Interested to see if this goes anywhere though.
---
I just found out if you world hop to a free world you can do well the traveling in the wildy without much risk. You just have to do the actual digging in a mem world. You also avoid the strong monsters and bosses this way!

I think the word I'm looking for is "yikes"

Is it possible he said he’s starting chemo because of the 99 RC grind

Never spit, always swallow man. Come on.

Yeah, I have ADHD too. It also makes you focused and alert, you'd have to show it doesn't give you an unfair advantage, which would be difficult.

---
Well I got it on a lvl 9 with just a bronze dagger p++
---
Its not about affording it, why would i basically pay the price equal to a brand new game every month for a game thats free with ingame gp from daily gameplay. Maybe if your were smarter you would spend your money where it would be more useful, like maybe investing? Dumb ignorant kid.
---
He made one tweet saying that he deserved the win more than that 1min meme vid about swampletics, and he's been apologizing for it ever since lol
---
Oh shoot I totally forgot it required 31 prayer, my bad
---
Its lower GP PH than at least 6/7 PVE methods, 5 of which are incredibly low effort and require very little skill.
---
The boss is fine for NORMAL players. Its a 1.5m ph that is relatively low effort. Most 'normal' players dont do it though because its less enjoyable/less profit than stuff like zulrah etc.
---
The only reason its even noticable is because its camped 24/7 by teams of gold farmers.
---
People need to stop screaming for nerfs of this sorta stuff and start screaming at Jagex to acknowlege and fix the gold farming issue because currently, they dont see it as that big a deal.
---
Ok boomer

so he has those bots i see buyin out baskets in ardy

Wait how did he manage to not get one shot by the mages and rangers? I've been hit like 16 by ranger and like 40 something by mages?

---
It's definitely easier to grasp a mobs max hit in osrs than rs3. If by low level mobs you mean like cows and goblins then sure, but you're not supposed to die to them anyways. But mobs like banshees+ the damage ranges start to increase. Osrs banshees max is 2 with Melee. Rs3 is 108(1.08) but with Melee and a magical ranged attack. The fact mobs can hit fractions of a hit point makes it nearly impossible to determine their max hit on the fly

Did they disable Humidify? I know they changed nest boxes so you can only open them in a bank
---
The average LMS player is usually an above average brid. I would say a better way to learn is to learn to Edge pk first. Then practice bridding on bots, then play LMS. If you don't know the basics of Edge pking and have a foundation, then it's very hard to get better at bridding cuz you have to learn so much.

Telling you my man, things are popping off in this community and we all love your videos!
---
Okay lmao you do you. If doing the content in the most productive way possible is a self restriction and not the end goal of the game then idk what to tell you. I concede, you're right. Clearing cox with two points over a few hours is the same as a sub 20 no death solo. There's no point in trying beyond clearing the content, and clearing it isn't hard, so the game must be easy.

Someone else won and he pretty much said "I worked hard and had 17 illnesses and still worked hard, I deserve this!" When it's a popularity contest + Jmod opinion. Smokey had a cool video, he won. Dude got too drunk and ranted his true feelings on twitter.
---
He has apologised though. But it broke the character image and showed that he isn't really playing any sort of character as Rendi, he's just a bit up himself.
---
Still makes good videos, just has to understand that effort =/= requirement to reward you.

Lolol

No, just like literally any 2FA, it doesn't matter if you lock the front door if the back door is wide open.

Email and phone security should be priority number one for everyone, as every sort of online login runs through either of those for 2FA.
---
Then ideally you have recovery codes as the only method of changing these, with a confirmation on the other device, so even if someone stole your phone or hacked your email, they couldn't outright deny you access without having both or physical access to where you wrote the codes down. (Which by themselves without passwords or 2fa devices are useless, so even if someone stole them you could deactivate them before they were useful).
---
It's not hard to be pretty damn secure from brute force / phishing attacks these days. Hell even being keylogged / RAT'd is less dangerous because of the fact they need to have your SMS message or email to login to something they know your password for, and a password manager could quickly change all the passwords of importance anyway.
---
That's not how it works. They've patched non-glitch things in the past without removing achievements on accounts. Hell there's still some lvl3 accounts with firecape in rs3 even though the method was a glitch method and has been patched.
---
Happy birthday mate
---
itll impact clues because they get a lot easier to do in bulk. right now the most limiting factor for hard+ clues is that theyre kinda a chore to do because you have a mix of wildy and not wildy steps so you degear from current task, then degear for wildy, regear for regular steps, degear for wildy, etc, then go back to your main activity.
---
i dont think overall itll matter all that much, like clues are mostly either alchables or low value cosmetics. a few of the valuable things like god dhide, boots specifically might dip a little but i dont expect much else would change.
---
Adding a delay doesn't matter and really doesn't fix anything.
---
All that means is hacker keeps you out of your email for 7 days to then hack your account.
---
The only time I get turoths are from Konar but when I do I always get a lot of keys so I can’t complain. I hope the RNG keeps blessing you. :)
---
i eat ur cat
---
Not only the rwt, but the consistent simp posting on twitter, being salty about Rendis success and even claims that Rendi "stole" his method(s). LOL imagine being that much of used ass rag come on
---
Evidence checks out, get this man unmuted.
---
If you put as much time into the game as Rendi does into fight caves you'd be maxed on your account with inferno. The guy is a madman and its awesome. Don't be discouraged, but puts in massive amounts of time and work into what he does.
---
 S🅱️inalla
---
Sorry that shithead got you fam. Scammers are everywhere, can’t even trust your bro’s no more. 
---
I browse this sub for memes and lols but i’m thinking of coming back like jordan wit the 45. If I do i’ll send you a friend request you girthy son of a bish.
---
That’s an extra 7 days of you being able to get your account back before they can do what they need to do.
---
"Looks like this dude's never fired an arrow in his life" rofl
---
There are a lot of people on here being haters. I can only assume they have never seen boobs not on a screen before. Heaven forbid someone does something because they personally find it fun and funny.
---
fortey*
---
You could do jad wave on a level 3 for sure
---
I use two SteelSeries Rival 100s.
---
You do not out dps craws consistently with bp
---
Just because something wasn’t explicitly intended doesn’t make it a bug
---
He already broke a chunk off of the fountain of rune and mounted it inside the orb on his staff. He's entirely self sufficient.
---
That shit was tense man
---
I’m with you man. I love OSHD
---
Wow 200 corrupted with 1 blade.. you'd hope so..
---
A lot of items don't necessarily sell at their value.. because they are just a dead market that don't get enough movement to even change the price.    
---
    
---
If anything the demand is only for initial construction levelers, who are willing to pay 700gp per plank because they aren't really going to spend more than 100k before advancing to better things.    
---
You're relying on hundreds of these players existing per 1 person doing this method which just isn't realistic.
---
Rendi real world traded too though?
---
Ironically just started chemo today lol
---
Dad is next.
---
Laughs in 4 claws 800kc
---
i feel for you OP , some people dont have that youtuber/streamer luck
---
Same for the ros recoil mechanic
---
There really is no end game here. He’s just crying out for attention.
---
They had to add feather packs because the botters where the only people who gathered them.
---
 Ironman has made Jagex realise just how shitty some materials are to collect lol, looking at you nail beast nails.....
---
No they didn’t
---
Contracts from gangs on kourend?
---
Exactly, because it creates a financial incentive to farm gold. The time they devote to farming gold for cash devalues the time you and I spend pvming, meaning we have to spend longer to gain the same buying power from our grind. Jagex then sells us, through our membership fees, an inferior product to the alternative, which would be an economy devoid of gold farmers leeching away value.
---
Loneliness 99/99
---
How has no one suggested pyramid plunder yet? 21 thieving  (ideally 31 or 41) then open sarcophaguses.
---
Well they both probably cost the same with the price of purple sweets that shot up into oblivion.
---
As a casual player (I play maybe 6 hours a week), I’m really satisfied with where my account is at. I hope I can eventually do TOB, but I think there’s some steps to go before I can get there. 
---
Rendi is just on another level.
---
....... When you know that you will lost your pet in p2p, what's the reason you try that on F2p. You get warned before entering pvp worlds, dun think that there are any problem.
---
ehh ok?
---
Your reply feels like I'm reading youtube comments.
---
&gt; A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result
---
Except it exactly is that. It's a flaw in the programming of these features that produced an unexpected result of being able to maintain infinite prayer points, avoid death, have 2.1b X 40 usable ring of recoil charges in your invent etc.
---
These were unexpected results of a design flaw. That's a software bug.
---
Thanks man. The wdr discord seems completely dead unless I’m in the wrong channel?
---
Who wouldn’t love his buttocks, they are sublime
---
These jokes just ain't funny anymore
---
It's not just one person it's an advertisement the cc does for it, it's advertised all over their social medias lol. Personally I don't think it's reaching too far to consider that it's possible when it's the clan as a whole advertising the services. I'd rather be safe than sorry
---
A level 7 did it 9 is old news
---
Gz on the irl rebuild, I hope for the best for you! I oddly enough consider myself lucky for having family members that would frequent casinos when I was growing up. I saw firsthand what a soul-sucking money trap it all was. I had family that would literally be at each other’s throats over money that had gone missing. It tears even the closest people apart. And for what? The chance that you might come out on top some of the times? It’s never worth it.
---
You’re on the right path, and you have my support!
---
Right but you don't have access to your email. So what's the delay doing to help that?
---
Rendi is a pussy
---
If that's the full context then wow.  
---
All I really see is Rendi expressing his disappointment (not even really mad, it looks like) then Settled, of all people, being a dick about it.
---
Happy birthday! 🎈🎈
---
weird self advertisement but ok
---
I will be happy if it is true
---
Lmao that's so cooked I like it
---
Not me, I fletched my way to 80 for magic short bow and crafted my way to be able to make a rune c bow with some limbs I found.
---
Damn! It’s acutally unreal that your (and mine) childhood game can give tough irl problem all because of some gambling with in game currency. 
---
When it comes to the game the sand casino hit me hard too, and i wish i never went there. Ofc i won and i lose alot of GP, but the worst part is that it ruins the game. Item drops in game dosent meen anything anymore and the overall game gets boring, because «duel arena makes you so much more gp/h»...
---
So people please never go stake!
---
Dude I really enjoy your video, keep it up
---
Guilty.
---
In the catalog under controversial is another guy who brought up that Zalcano was going to ruin the game economy but he was downvoted and ignored lel
---
I’m downvoting him because he reposted, not because of some shitty joke that I didn’t get
---
I have 14M wine lol, the limit is 6k/4hrs so some of these do take time to accumulate but when it goes up 1gp my stack is worth 14m more per.
---
No, on mobile I would only get put in Aus worlds. Since those outages I'm getting put in random worlds too.
---
Should probably not allow tick eating either /s
---
Also if you zoom in on the rats in lumby and pisc they have tiny red phats.
---
You pick em, plop a few into a PB&amp;J sandwich and blast off
---
flicking was a bug and it's why it was removed from rshd, osrs has just chosen to leave it.
---
No prob. If you're thinking of getting into it don't forget that yield is super important! So I do highly recommend ultra compost. It can also be pretty self-sustaining. Watermelons can be used to create super compost, and just buy (with your herb profit) some volcanic ash to create ultra comp and keep the flower protecting the watermelons so that u don't have to worry about them dying. Before you know it you'll be leveling up like crazy! Happy farming =)
---
nah it's runescape 4
---
Metacritic rated that series 66/100. My god that site is a trainwreck.
---
Imagine actually going to the saw mill.
---
4 runs per minutes.
---
No, RWT makes me sick. His skill level has nothing to do with it
---
&gt;Girthy Dad
---
And at that point I stopped being comfortable reading this post
---
Oooohhh, you’re approaching me!
---
Wym? Dude's got way more levels than he needs. If I were him I'd bring a poison dagger and a few recoils though...
---
\- Yes 
---
\- No 
---
\- No, but set another one up anyway
---
Jeez. Youre a very angry individual and you clearly dont want your mind changed so im not gonna bother trying lol.
---
You believe what you want my dude.
---
Hmm. Idk tbh. Probs just unlucky. Good luck in future though!
---
Average loot 24k - bones and hides that you cant pick up. Youre talking out your arse mate lmao
---
2016 wants its pepe back.
---
#everytime lol
---
“Content” it’s not really content unless it’s satisfying. Endless weeks of grinding isn’t satisfying. Make RuneScape Fun Again.
---
A landfill of trash. Shouldn’t have allowed it to happen but now comes the grind I suppose 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Wasn't it an A4?
---
Not even blue rings.
---
Pieces of paper with a blue ring drawn on it by some overworked banker.
---
Meet me at ardy lever and bring your bank
---
It would just be nice if someone wearing torags and a rune scim actually would benefit from full torags
---
It doesn't have any advantages over dharok's though, so the only thing that causes it to be used is that it has a lower price because it's less useful.
---
Even if the hammers were a decent weapon, I dont think it would make the set op
---
Rude.
---
You accuse me of cherry picking than bring up dark wizards? As if they are an accurate representation of danger vs combat level?
---
&gt;Mobs die too quickly to kill you?
---
?? A mob with 1 hp that can hit 99 is more dangerous then a mob with 99  that can hit 1.  It's RuneScape, rarely is there a situation where you can't just walk away or teleport from any enemy.
---
How to make the game not fun for other people: Tell them their way of having fun is wrong.
---
So wait how is he taking 2-3 dmg from the jad but not dying? Same goes for the lvl 90 ranged monsters
---
I think starting with quest cape is a good idea, after that you should probably focus on training combat up for raids.
---
If you want, go for it. 
---
I've only gotten a single one in all my time playing, and that was the easy one. I doubt I'll ever bother killing enough Earth Warriors or Jogres or Lesser Demons to get the scroll.

bananas look like oranges to me

Still won't get video of the year haha

It's valid, there is a rather close f2p community. Gameplay is very simplistic. 
---
Membership increases the amount of content by like 20x though, it's a good purchase if the game appeals to you.
---
I thoroughly enjoy f2p, don’t expect an engaging story but you still get satisfying gear upgrades and crafting opportunities.
---
I’ve twice now logged out at the Grand Exchange and logged in to a room with three colored portals, west of Yanille. What’s up with that?
---
12 minutes. Lol
---
I aint got much but i will bring what I got
---
The point of the game is that you can choose how to achieve your goals. There's a most efficient route ofc, but no method is wrong.
---
My advice would be, take your time and explore. If you dislike a certain grind then look up guides to make it quicker, but otherwise figure it out yourself.
---
Enough attempts will get it, baskets of straw berries and you will be right 😁
---
Thanks for your feedback I'll start now
---
Aaaaaand it's gone
---
I'm gonna put some hours into it and if I feel like it I'll get membership. Thanks for the feedback mate
---
Well it also got super inflated because of the mvp drop and a crystal pick being the best way to get mvp. But it’s floor is certainly so low because of the points you made
---
All four of the melee sets have a "weak piece" 
---
Guthan legs
---
Verac body
---
Dharok helm
---
Torag weapon
---
Its just how it was designed.
---
Welcome to rs. On bounty patch a guy pretended to be friendly just to skull trick me for ags lol. Most people arent this scummy but is sad that they strill exist here. Rule of thumb make friends with people but never give them any gp. If hes buy limit he can buy ur 75m in stuff, you give nothing, no risk.
---
The result is both correct and expected if you understand the mechanics which were intentionally implemented
---
People would absolutely exploit the shit out of it though, just like bh crates
---
People need to learn that all you need to do is to break the ice to start conversations, of course as an introvert like me that's a difficult challenge.
---
Yeah kinda dumb that their logic is “yeah you should be banned but fuck it” while other people are still permed for doing the same thing
---
Don’t call them out until you play along and get the free whip and maybe arcane
---
I have only just started playing again 2 weeks ago and had this drop in today. 
---
Always be wary, I am no fool when it comes to this kind of thing, but it is very real looking, especially sent from an email like that. I went straight to my account messages to double check...
---
Always use your account Messages to check for these things, never follow the links and enter your account information.
---
Black dude calls you brotha

blowpipe with blessed dragonhide of any type, anguish, barrows, etc etc.
