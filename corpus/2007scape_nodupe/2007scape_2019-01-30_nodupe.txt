Sure, but that's still only one scenario, hence why I said "multiple scenarios". I think you should have many scenarios in which it is bis to justify making a max cape out of it. Not to mention the only reason to farm KQ is for the pet and infernal cape is still better than myth cape. So not only is it a piece of content that barely anyone does, but it still isn't bis. Is the argument that we should have a max cape for all "2nd bis" items then? I'm sorry, but I am just not feeling this one. My mind is unchanged. Mythic max cape still seems pointless.

Unpopular opinion, but Revenants are PvP content. They‚Äôre in the Wilderness. The PKers, while they do have a terrible reputation, have literally *only* this. Like that is *their* content. None of their polls ever pass when it comes to giving them new shit, so I don‚Äôt blame them for running the place and milking it for money as much as possible.

Regarding b2b2b, i remember i watched a vid of torvesta  a while back. He said that in the vid as he was opening barrows chest and it just sounded hilarious! Does anyone know which vid im talking about? :D

The whole point of 'optional' is that it skips from 5a to 6 if it doesn't happen.
---
5a -&gt; 6  
---
*or*  
---
5a -&gt; 5b -&gt; 6
---
It's not that 5b is melee middle, it's that 5b doesn't happen.
---
I know the underwater thieving is ehp post 99 but the xp seemed really bad for me at 80/80. I think the fact that it scales so heavily towards 99 makes it uninviting. I love VM though, not sure why so few people do it.

TL;DR 
---
What is the intended use for the new crystal armor? Will it be good anywhere other than tanking bandos gwd? Can we see a 1-handed crystal mace that may be buffed with a hydra tail and a magic staff which boosts magic accuracy against players. 
---
It looks like the armor just has BIS range defense without a negative magic defense, making it some of the best tank gear for General Graardor, which would make it fairly desirable. 
---
The armor special effect seems like an attempt to make crystal weapons more viable, however the c hally is useless besides the spec, and bringing a 4 way switch in place of dragon claws doesn't sound appealing. I'm doubting this will make the crystal bow stronger than blow pipe, and with the recharges I'm not sure if it will even be a cheaper alternative? Perhaps to make it more appealing add a crystal mace and staff? 
---
Could we see a 1 handed crystal mace with with stat bonuses of 62 crush , 58 str, and 7 prayer, placing it slightly above a dragon mace but below the d-scim. Consider allowing a hydra tail to be wrapped around the mace. The spiky bones of the hydras tail would cause more damage to be done with each hit, however would de-balance the mace making it somewhat less accurate, while enhancing the prayer bonus of the mace (stats subject to balancing). The mace could be created and degrade similar to the suggested crystal armor or the old equipment, however the hydras tail would remain upon degradation and be removable at anytime (and dropped when pk'd).
---
Why are there no magic crystal weapons? There should be a crystal staff which could have +20 magic accuracy and perhaps a 5-10% damage boost making it more useful than plain staffs but less so than higher tiers like SoTD without the armor. However when used with the full crystal armor it could boost spell accuracy significantly such as +50% while reducing damage by ~30-50% so that its useful when freezing opponents, but will not change the barrage/slayer metas. The staff could be obtainable/ degradable similar to the armors suggested or the old crystal equipment. 
---
Can you PLEASE add another use for Kurask/other slayer monster heads? I‚Äôve gotten 4 Kurask heads in 2k KC and it‚Äôs kinda depressing just seeing them sitting in my bank. Even just turning them in for some additional Slayer xp would do.

Can the loot broadcast in the Chambers of Xeric be changed to "A bright purple light shines for \[player\]". Then broadcast the loot once they actually open it? I love the tension and excitement of getting a drop in the Theatre of Blood without knowing what it is.
---
Ooh I‚Äôm down for that, sign me up
---
So you're actually trying to argue that someone who doesn't even try and "cant" put in a few hours here and there should be allowed to progress at the same rate and receive the same rewards as someone who does try and/or can put the time in? And if someone does put in the time, then they aren't living a "normal life"? Fuck off with all of that. Plenty of people put in the time and effort in this game and still maintain fulfilling jobs and have families and all that other shit. In fact, if you can only put in a few hours here and there, that is even MORE incentive to be an efficiency fiend when you do get to play. It really sounds like you fundamentally don't understand the MMO genre or the people who play it, and are trying to make excuses for someone else's laziness
---
No it‚Äôs not, afk is used to mean something that takes minimal clicks or goes by itself.    
---
Woodcutting is AFK because your character woodcuts a full inventory with one click. Agility is not AFK because each individual click = xp gain.

No the mime random is next to the fishing trawler instance and the cosmic plane

How you changed the sabers!?

is there any chance of being able to mount your kharedst memoirs once full in your poh for cost of some amount of charges to allow unlimited teleports similar to the xerics talisman and glory etc
---
If I recall correctly there was a memory leak in the gpu plugin but I doubt it could cause fast spikes.
---
Dps wise its very similar to blowpipe but with crossbow you dont need to bgs spec or pray mage. This way you take a lot less damage and get up to 7 kills per trip and save a lot of time banking. With crossbow you can equip a dragonfire shield, because of this you can pray range as his range attack is more common than the mage attack. 
---
I love it.  I love that time was taken to create this.

Uhhh. No. Lol. Why would people ever grind? The whole point of the game is the grind. 
---
If warding comes into the game, and the breaking things down into core elements could use runes to break down to essences?
---
?? I'm struggling to get any good tree seeds as Ironman, tips?
---
I honestly would return it to Amazon and get a fire 10 instead of an 8. It runs perfect on my 10. 
---
Which is why I don't see them updating RCing significantly any time soon. What changes could they make without upsetting the economy too much?
---
i feel that
---
&gt; Every Update has to be rebalanced next patch
---
That's how most software development works, especially with small teams like the OSRS team. It seems like it's better to rebalance releases based on player feedback rather than leave them broken out of pride
---
&gt; JMods won't respond to this thread
---
You literally just called them out for using Twitter / Reddit as their customer support. Wouldn't them making a PR statement in this thread be hypocritical on their part? Also you're one person making a post on Reddit, you're not entitled to a JMod response.
---
&gt;11 Fucking Dollars a Month
---
Yeah, games with continuous development need to pay their developers, and if people are willing to pay it there's no real reason to drop the price down (When this $11 is already below the industry standard sub-price of $15/mo)

I‚Äôm not sure this game is capitalistic. Players can‚Äôt create businesses and the only passive income source(s) are from flipping/marching and kingdom. It‚Äôs definitely more feudalist if I had to match it with a societal market based system. The players are the serfs in this.

You need 99 rc for a diary? I‚Äôd rather do BA, idk why people don‚Äôt like that game, I love it, just get a good squad

They changed it so that the pet prioritizes over the log, it auto sneaks into your invent \^\_\^
---
Yeah most people are ass in f2p pking. Oh and BTW when do you think is a good idea to go for green dragons. I've got stuff like rune weapons unlocked (I can wield them) and am almost level 50 ranged almost 50 magic as well. I actually got the free trail and mostly did skilling 
---
Wow that game looks really cool. Great chart too.
---
No you don't, I was just saying i would probably rather get 99 rc than have to play BA to level 5 in all roles. 
---
Post this in /r/latestagecapitaism to trigger them
---
Okay so let me get this right. You propose announcements are never made, then some people find out how the content works and instantly stock pile the item. News quickly spreads and everyone begins stock piling the item. Now all you've done is created "insider trading", some people have more knowledge than others and can unfairly merch. The items will still be merched, the difference is some people will have early access to the information on what to merch, how is that any better?
---
False. Pickling requires vinegar by definition. Fermentation does not. 
---
Both are preservation methods. However, without vinegar, they are not ‚Äúpickles‚Äù they are simply fermented cucumber. 
---
Eh I still think Capitalism fits the game the closest, the entire economy is driven by individual enterprise and a total free market, with the only ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù restrictions on trade being ‚Äúnon-tradeable items‚Äù.

hello glorious osrs mods, i was wondering if the regular hydras could be changed to have 3 different ones each dropping 1 piece of the ring, a green range one that uses alchs poison spec, a blue one that uses magic and uses the lightning spec and a red melee one that uses the fire spec, and if u want to complete the ring u either have to kill the boss or kill each dif hydra for their piece of the ring, this would make regular hydras more fun, and less tedious for those who dont have the skill to kill the boss, the color of the hydras will correspond to which combat style they use
---
Right that seems standard for bosses, but what about a third bolt type?

I have 90 range, mage, and def.  Which should I level up first to get more efficiency on Zulrah trips?

Finally forced myself to start grinding RC for the Zeah diary, and I'm seeing these spammed ads of essence runners for FOUR MILLION gp per hour (per runner).  What the hell is up with that?

Well your vote is already biased cause you're voting on what content you think should be in game.

the game revolves around only regenerating 1-3 HP per minute, so no.

I disagree. I Liked first season a lot, second season mostly(it had some weak moments), thought the movie was fairly decent. The new season though I really like, IMO it's better than first season.

I love how people claim wilderness is meant for pvp, but pvpers have no incentive to kill each other because its more profitable to farm revs and deny anyone else all day.

Swimming and werewolf, both major agility updates. Swimming and tzhaar are both big for thieving. Zeah library and zmi are massive for runecraft.

My PC died before some of these updates came out, but apparently there was a generally-liked RC minigame. RC is an inherently boring run to altar, click, run to bank grind, I'd like to see something else. I don't even have a strong preference what it is, just another type of grind.
---
Laziest ever idea is slayer-for-runecrafting: Just go to one of the Essence mine people, get assigned to try creating arbitrary combination runes (not the real ones, just enchant this at altar x, y, z). For science. If the abyss is banned for this, it could encourage travel and be vaguely fun. Maybe it works sometimes, low chance of certain new combo runes (even useless ones).

If you spent 300 hours getting both 99 mining and 99 rc, and someone else spent 300 hours doing the same thing, it doesn't devalue your achievement. It doesn't surprise me that you're scared though, I imagine that idea would be scary to many people with autism.

The point of the diaries is to do all the content 
---
I have a suggestion I think people might like. 
---
It may devalue ecumenical keys a bit - However there could perhaps be a quality of life to assure they don't become entirely useless. (I don't have an idea for that - Though jagex may or other players may if they like the idea)
---
The idea that I suggested and a lot of people actually seemed to of agreed in the clan-chat i idle in was to be able to 'store kill-count' at god wars so you can leave and re-enter to kill the boss without having to get kill count again until the stored kill-count runs out.
---
What I would also support with that change is that you no longer get kills towards the kill-count when you slay the boss and the minions inside of the room. 
---
I don't know if this would be an advantage or not but you would still have to get the kill-count it just goes above 40 or stores x-above 40 and could potentially add a cap to it so it doesn't get ridiculous numbers.
---
There is perhaps a few cons to it that people could take advantage of the multi-way combat to bring their kill-count up a lot quicker. I don't know if there's a way to counteract it without making outside the boss rooms single way combat or something.
---
Only thing I‚Äôve found useful is Jackie the fruit for quick access to the karamja spirit tree patch when doing tree runs.

I mean, both boots are storable in Poh.
---
Don‚Äôt be so generous 
---
All I can hear is the dancing crab song lol
---
I would do slayer to train. NMZ is cancer to me lol
---
I'm the entire reason people buy bonds? Huh.
---
Take it one step at a time. I came back just around 7 months ago and am about 198 quest points, I finished RFD just before the new year. I only did fire cape once I over leveled it, and I literally only did the Fighter Torso because I was keen on getting the obby plate for Kandarin Hards.
---
My point being is that don't get absorbed in the bigger picture, just take it one unlock at a time. You finish MM1 and realize you have Awaugio or w/e is name is done? And your 62 cooking? Well there is your motivation for 70 cooking. You don't even have to quest as soon as you get 70 cooking but knowing you have it done sets you up to one day just sigh and knock it out.
---
I really do feel you on questing kinda messing with the flow of the game, so look for the little things. Every step you take in the game completes something else elsewhere.
---
So? Let potions be pricey. I remember early osrs they cost and arm and a leg and it‚Äôs not like we all hated the game. 
---
You support jagex by increasing demand for the product and creating incentive for other people to buy bonds (increasing the in game price of bonds)
---
Except raids is super end game, this should be mid game or early late game.
---
I really liked the house altar idea... that way your demon butler can run essence for you
---
Cause im retarded and didnt see them 
---
Lol. No. 
---
Seems pretty self explanatory. We have dozens of solo pvm challenges. We have no real mid game multiplayer pvm challenges.
---
I am so stupid. But it forced me to figure out that if you're playing fullscreen on a computer, you can go to -&gt;Display, -&gt;Advanced scaling settings, change it to 150, and then the game becomes so much better. Everything is the appropriate size and the text is much easier to read. You can also assign Escape for logging out/switching worlds. Thanks, man! 
---
Which is really weird since I would think ironmen play specifically for the grind but I guess the craving for free shit conquers all 
---
med kebos diary gives you double drop rate btw (1/250 to 1/125)
---
https://i.imgur.com/RNnCdfS.jpg
---
Lol.
---
im cool with that as long as the xp rates dont fly like construction. I think they could add a passive way to get rc similar to bird houses but less xp. 
---
It‚Äôs a hard grind but isn‚Äôt it good money? It honestly doesn‚Äôt seem any shittier then thieving agility or hunter. 
---
Good you won, now go outside 
---
Robert Baratheon from GoT.  Needs a warhammer though
---
this is the only rs merch idea i‚Äôve seen that id buy tbh 
---
Why aren‚Äôt my exchanges confirming? I bought a steel scimitar and it has just been sitting there unconfirmed. Same with a red cape I bought. 
---
Seeds are 10k each usually. Doing blessings will always get you money.
---
I hope you qccidentally alch your first two tbow drops
---
Well hunter isnt bad because of bird houses. Theiving has extremely fast xp methods and agility blows aswell
---
[Exactly.](https://i.imgur.com/kepBZRZ.gif)
---
So I‚Äôm about a month or two in this game, and I was safespotting some lava dragons trying to make some money. All the sudden a group comes up and kills me. 
---
I respawn and immediately go restock a bit then try to recover whatever they didn‚Äôt take but I forget a antidragon shield and I get one hit by a dragon. So then I feel really stupid and get a antidragon shield and teleport over and the same group kills me. 
---
My question: do you typically go back to recover any leftovers after you die or do you just move on and take the hit?
---
Its just 1/250........ ima cry
---
It won‚Äôt change. If u like it then level it and if not then don‚Äôt 
---
That's my goal, I have personally done like 20k rune essence over 3 months for a bit of cash and exp. So like 44-49 was nature runes. Then I stopped. Then I did 49-51 so I could make laws. Did laws for one level. Stopped again. Did ToG for a level. Did some easy/medium diaries for xp. So right now with probably 12-30 hours of total gameplay I am at 62 and a half RC. 
---
70-77 Is probably going to be a real trial, but it's kind of different to have the worst part of a grind be early on and it's an interesting take on balance.
---
I got tassets on 3kc a few days ago
---
No worries at all, I love feedback an critiques!
---

some may have rwt should we punish groups of people based on what a few individuals do unless you can prove rot is there to rwt only you have no valid point 
---
I mean that's one way to look at it. 90% of the community looks at it as a meme.  it could be a sweet skill. 
---
unpolled changes to an average moneymaker lmao
---
from the Grand Exchange?
---
Not wrong but used his guides 90% of the time and just got QP cape today! So thanks Slayermusiq1, you‚Äôre a fucking legend!!
---
At what point does thieving get good xp? I‚Äôm 40 and I fucking hate it lol. Hunter I‚Äôve just never been able to figure out even after guides. RC does suck tho I‚Äôm lvl 9 and just have no desire to train it. 
---
get this rs3 shit out of here
---
Max points requires you to use as many bosses as possible. It's normally recommended to turn off the really annoying ones like Elvarg though

Why are the 2k+ total worlds not warring? Why do clans not try to occupy level unrestricted worlds?

About the last line, the kenos achievement diary made a small change to Runecrafting with the dense essence blocks x2. And for agility, on the Prifddinas poll blog there is an agility icon on the map so black graceful incoming. üëÄ
---
Use this as a - that‚Äôs not his wife button

I think construction is justified by the cost whereas essence is cheap
---
Have you watched a guide on youtube? Probably your best source of information since it's been sound for so long. 
---

Wait, that was only a month ago? Jesus.
---
Forgot that they still have the fucking rot statue in game literally anyone with a rot tag needs to be banned most toxic group ever and  ruin every competitive event on this game
---
I want one
---
really I love agility on mobile, its easy as pie I think. its my go-to when on mobile. 
---
I have. That‚Äôs the thing. It was a Zerker account I made that got hacked and ruined by some botter. I recovered the account and have changed the password and setup authenticator but still get emails. I have no idea how it got hacked.
---
I don‚Äôt use the account anymore, but the original comment reminded me of it.  
---
Clue milestones, 1750 total, maxed house, Slayer (and bossing/higher level PVM), farm money for max gear 
---
Thought you didn't burn the shrimp anymore?
---
I had simply forgotten about running. Also more people have bossing stats than 75 rc
---
Supply and demand
---
Your defence is low, so it might be worth it to switch out for a rune full helm and kiteshield. Or not, you'll probably be fine either way. 
---
Invy:
---
* 2 ranging/bastion potions
---
* 8/9 Brews
---
* Purple sweets if you want the extra insurance
---
* Fill the rest with super restores
---
I do that even though I know their not real people 
---
What the fuck is with all this awesome fucking OC today? We don't deserve this
---
So does Jagex still get their full $11 from me in the end?
---
I just recently invested some $ into rs to get a dragon crossbow. My slayer still too low (73) to start making easy bank and i figured it was easier to toss $10 at the game since i hadn't invested in it since i started playing 3 months ago. Before osrs i was spending like $20-30 monthly on Pok√©mon Go so i figured it's worthwhile either way.
---
So you didn't want to waste time reading this, but decided to waste time commenting that you weren't going to waste time reading it?
---
**Brilliant. Great contribution.**
---
To those of us with at least a 4th grade reading level:
---
I think it's worth looking into rebalancing certain classes of weapons. An entire combat rework is unnecessary, but it would be nice to get some use out of a lot of "obsolete" weapons.
---
Can we get a better way of obtaining pots of flour? Maybe increase the capacity of mills from 28 to 140 or 280?
---
Will we see rest added to the game? Running out of stamina and waiting to regenerate (unless you want to pay a ton for potions) is rough!
---
76 gets you pretty much anything you need.

Lets stop these posts.

"little do they know..."

Boost or no boost?
---
["Starting from $6.99"](https://www.runescape.com/bonds)
---
Actually they get more, since two bonds equals around 14 dollars.
---
Again, I'm not flaming you for using bonds or anything, I also use them.
---
I liked the design submission
---
Made 23m on these bots then got greedy and lost it and 7m more
---
Those some good legs do
---
Okay, now this was epic.
---
I personally think rc and agility should stay the way they are. Tedious and time consuming but very worth it in the end 
---
Yeah I wondered which route to pursue 20 levels ago.
---
C Engineer is swedish and Slayermusiq1 is belgian iirc 
---
Yes you get marks of grace the fastest there. Once you hit 20 lvls higher than the minimum, 60 for canafis, their drop rate decreases. 
---
Jagex wants to know your location. 
---
I guess I'll be the guy who says i actually do have a problem with rc. My biggest problem has always been the xp rate and the fact it doesn't really scale up with your level. Something I've thought for years is that additional runes should've added an xp value of 0.5x the base.
---
So where 1 air rune is 5xp, 2 is 7.5xp, 3 is 10xp, 4 is 12.5xp, etc.
---
Which seems a bit crazy at first but when you consider the numbers carefully it's not really anything. At 66rc with 7x airs you get 20xp/essence. Deaths at 65 give 10xp per essence. So with airs you get double the xp/hour but 0 profit (which considering it's a profit based skill that's a big deal breaker for some people). This creates options for the playerbase of forsaking gp for xp, and the numbers aren't particularly crazy (lavas already beats that xp rate and is doable at a lower level).
---
Pretty much every skill has varied leveling options for xp/gp and increasing xp rates. Rc however doesn't and it's very archaic, mirroring smithing in that regard (though people ignore smithing due to blast furnace being a soft fix and offering high xp + gp/hour). That's always been my major gripe with the skill, that I can go 30 levels straight without a single notable increase to my xp/hour or gp/hour. Unfortunately any drastic change such as this would cause major conflict of integrity and making the game easier, which is a fair concern.
---
Frankly speaking I can't imagine them doing any major overhaul, but rather slapping in a new low level afk method (like low level bloods) and calling it a day while the other 90% of the skill rots.
---
irl only ironman
---
Nice private server
---
Ur right, holding down rev caves makes them worse than hitler. They arent breaking any rules by doing this but I understand you want the 2200 total worlds so you can afk without effort
---
This is cursed 
---
you dug hella deep into my shit and THAT'S what you came out with? LOL. Surprised it wasn't orange man bad. I'll give you some credit for not being too much of a goof.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
That looks pretty slick. I wonder if there's a good way to incorporate a design on the hood to mimic the different helmets.
---
Go from 40-60 at canafis, you should have full graceful before you need to change courses.
---
The issue is botted emblems.
---
Yep I did mine on mobile, sold my PC a while ago so I only play on mobile. I definitely think making a fight caves guide for mobile would be a great idea! I see lots of people asking if it‚Äôs even possible which goes to show how useful a guide could be. 
---
That‚Äôs impressive for only a months worth! What skill are you hitting 99 in? 
---
Oh, interesting.
---
Munclesonkey is that you?
---
I can't even get a raids completed, I'd rather get 99 rc again
---
Me

My school doesn‚Äôt even have dedicated members to Runescape like that. I‚Äôm probably the only guy in my entire grade who knows about it.
---
Well for one thing you can't begin or end a name with a dash. I'm not positive but I believe you can't pick a name if someone uses it as their login
---
It's mostly fine as it is. I'd like to see more specialty weapons like hasta and bludgeon that are used for specific enemies, but having a dominant weapon type isn't necessarily bad or even unrealistic.
---
What source could you possibly want? There isnt a source. No one complained, no one made a big deal of it, there was no foul play suspected at the time.
---
You wont find a runescape news article saying "Reports suggest ROT won fairly".
---
My 2nd attempt i totally freaked out when the healers came i was able to draw them off but they started smacking me hard and i just couldnt keep up, going cor 75 range now so i can use the bpipe

Seriously need a better customer service system. Badly. Been playing the game 10 years and it still sucks to report a problem and get help.
---
Everyone hates on rc but I think agility is worse. At least you make money rc
---
I wonder if they use graphs on how much items come in and go out. 
---
E.g. 50k gold ore/day (in) - 51k gold bars/day (out)
---
Or if they have a group of items that are lacking in the game, and they just throw them in like a lucky dip.
---
E.g. not much buckets of sand in the game, lets throw them into the next drop table.
---
Yes u idiot
---
Lvl 3 skillers

*Heavy breathing*

This so true. They cry about RC but then dont want to devalue it or make EASYSCAPE.

How big of a deal is the portal nexus? I had max house before it came out, and I built the room (for the mounted digsite and xerics) but haven't actually built the nexus at all because I wasn't really sure how much use there is to it.

Yeah they have, it's called Old School Runescape. Trade with your fucking friends whenever you want.

What do you mean no need? They're perfect for comparing. They are both the epitome of the MMORPG genre and have always been competing.

Log in to your alt if you have one and check it, maybe someone's hacking you. There's an end mobile sessions option in acc, you probably tried it but in case you haven't try and see if it does something. Otherwise you'll have to contact Jagex in some way but their reply times are very bad, especially at these hours.

That'll get you zulrah shortcut unboosted and will get you all diaries but western(chompy pet)/ardy(only needed if you are doing the ardy course anyways so vov)

So this is coming from someone who previously got 99 rc pre runespan, I finished off 99 slowly but ended up with my favorite 99 a month before runespans release, runespan was the last straw for me with rs3 and I never looked back till osrs, now with a second look on it all, please give us another way to get rc up, but don‚Äôt ruin it for the people that grinded one of the more satisfying skill capes. To be completely honest it might be impossible.
---
Omg THIS lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇüëç
---
No Exp waste
---
I have played rs since like 2003 and played osrs since day of release lol, I don't think it's an experience issue....just not seeing it :o
---
If all this stuff really bothers you all so much why not cancel your memberships untill they fix it? "Speak with your wallet" as they say, if a good chunk of the OSRS community suddenly stopped giving them money then they would have no choice to fix all these issues, unless they would rather go bankrupt...
---
Honestly just have fun and enjoy your time even if some people tell you're a noob and playing the game wrong. 
---
I know it sounds cheesy and a little cliche... but It doesnt matter how you play the game as long as you have fun!
---
Considering RS came out when we were younger, this makes sense. Now that OSRS is a thing when we‚Äôre older this also makes sense.

I'm glad rot is this pathetic 
---
This is a god tier callout 
---
I feel like peope who keep saying this shit dont do content like inferno or raids. 
---
Can we get a buff to bryophyta staff with the new hespori hoss
---
Oh, I mean by 5000 drops, they made more money from bones or rune. But not from visages or any other rare drop. (They made some, but not comparably)
---
The fact that I saw Varrock initially, then read the title and could barely see varrock anymore just fucked me up for a good minute or so 
---
Visages, dragon limbs, runite ore, rune pl8 and legs made more than d bonez

---

---

---
Stop defending garbage game design how about that
---
&gt; Which is 100% okay. That really is how leveled content works. Every time. Just because a higher end item has some sort of cost or downside associated with ie, a la Barrows degrading, doesn't mean the previous tier isn't obsolete.
---
It literally does mean the previous tier isn't obsolete, because the whole point of the design of Barrows is that it doesn't replace the previously existing items, it supplements them. The previous tier are still useful and you still use them sometimes, so they're not obsolete.
---
&gt;The same as the above comment. You level and previous resources and methods become obsolete.
---
No, they do not. Oak trees aren't obsolete just because you can cut willows. Willows can't be made into planks. 
---
Or for mining, for example coal, silver and gold aren't ever obsolete. Iron is still useful because powermining it is faster xp than mining the higher level ores which are mainly for making money and items rather than getting quick XP. They all have different purposes.
---
&gt;But it has. The Woodcutting Guild for instance has a Sawmill closer than Varrock's last I checked. Location-specific improvements doesn't injure a community. At all. Location progress has happened in OSRS and will continue to. It happens in RS3 as well and it's done really solid things for that game's progression too.
---
It's normal for guilds to have rewards like that in Runescape, so it doesn't really bother anyone. 
---
The developers have literally said they don't want to create new player hubs to replace existing ones, and that they are concerned they may have inadvertently done so with the Farming Guild. I'm not just making this shit up, it's all from the devs themselves.
---
&gt;It does, it's just less clearly displayed. Dangerous areas with aggressive mobs are the same as level banded zones. GW2 has handled it far better than any other MMO, with level scaling inside zones, but it doesn't mean that every area released has to remain relevant forever. That's how games stagnate and die.
---
No, it isn't even remotely the same thing. In level-banded zones, *everything* is within that level range. That's the point. There's no high level content, there's no low level content, there's no variety. One area is just slapped with a level range and everything in it is designed to be consumed within that level range, then you go on to the next zone. It's a guided tour through a world, not a world that feels authentic.
---
Runescape has groups of high level monsters within otherwise mostly low level areas. A random wolf is still going to be whatever level wolves are, regardless of where it is in the world. It's things like this that totally separate RS from crapware like GW2.
---
Level scaling is *awful*. Level scaling would completely destroy the integrity of Runescape forever.
---
&gt;However, RS3 has created several solid hubs across the board. Varrock is the basic one, that is very accessible and still used. Menaphos is a mid-tier hub with lots of great resources for players at that level. Prifddinas fills the high end niche, with nice skilling options as well. No matter which location you use, you still have to leave that hub to play the vast majority of the game. The same case is here.
---
RS3 is exactly what the devs have said they're trying to avoid. They don't want to create new player hubs. I totally agree with them, and I've already explained why. You just ignore it, and repeat over and over again that RS3 has these hubs. Well guess what, this isn't RS3, and we don't want them for the reasons we have explained.
---
&gt;I outright think that OSRS handles this far worse than RS3. RS3 has leveling options that scale all the way to the top, and usually have multiple options at every stage, with varied intensity and cost. It feels really good when, no matter your level, you've got a choice on how you want to progress and can feel good about it.
---
Again, exactly the opposite of how things work in OSRS, and for good reason. Why even have things like Dragon items, which were released slowly over time from a variety of sources, when people end up rushing past level 60 straight to these new sets of items that you can obtain way more easily than Dragon anyway? 
---
Runescape's strict vertical progression w/ planned obsolescence of the previous tier runs out at 60. After that point, things widen up. That's a good thing! You say you want choices, well you have waaay more choices in OSRS. Instead of picking from 'generic tank armour' vs 'generic DPS armour' every 10 levels, which makes the whole game feel as artificial and gamey as Daemonheim, you choose from *all the content in the entire game over about level 60*.

no we don't
---
That was also me. You‚Äôre welcome.
---
I'm not supposed to give my opinion, but...
---
Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I present exhibit A. (Hint: eqxhibit A is this post).
---
This is beyond science! 
---
Late to the party but thanks for this!
---
Then don't train it. Train one of the other 20+ skills. But at least have some diversity and leave at least 2 skills (agil and rc) tedious to get to max lvl.
---
About 5b i think
---
I once bought an I Pk'd your mom t-shirt. Thankfully I don't think I ever left the house with it on.
---
What's happening here?
---
i suppose it ruins the 45 defense account bit though haha, i get what you mean though.
---
if i was gonna go past 45 i would just go to 70.
---
A t-shirt would be dope since spring is coming up.
---
Can we get this to the top pls?
---
The Thurgo card* and it was because of your username, dont pull the classic "weakling pulling ____ card" when you have nothing better to say yourself 
---
You're incentivizing someone else to buy bonds by contributing to the in-game market for bonds.
---
I think it would look cool if the hoodie strings were the off-white-green color that you see as an accent on void.
---
thats true, none of them are prereqs for barrows gloves or inferno or slayer.
---
wasnt sure if holy grail had more than just the hard clue step going for it for zerker accounts and i should do that instead of getting the extra hundred k a day from varrock diary and souls bane
---
Spam click the obstacles so even if you fail you dont take damage
---
They already polled hidden pool results.
---
yeah but im trying to figure out hhow i would get stacked for 10hp
---
Oof ya at that point you're probably right going with the whip
---
10/10
---
Yeah i screenshot every drop i get.
---
50-82(boost to 90) is about 2.32m xp, at 60xp per oak plank thats over 38k planks, at 420gp each thats 16m worth of oak planks
---
However there is a pool at 70 construction that will restore your run and special attack, if you also have an altar its a nice combo.
---
50-70(no boosts) requires about 11k oak planks, at 420 each thats 4.5m. 
---
I'll be looking forward to your reddit luck drop in 50 kills. 
---
Nice 
---
1750s used to be held pretty tightly by a pure clan for 20m/week, but as of recently you just pay certain pker's their own rate to off you (if pure).
---
2k's is like 40m?/week and difficult to get into, 2.2k is rot only.
---
Only worth paying for protection if you are going to put in serious hours at revs/ if ironman
---
yeah but then you gotta wait for it to finish growing and it throws off your rhythm
---
Nice.
---
Response bias
---
Yeah that's why you bring  along bow to tag healers
---
Nice
---
Am I the only one who likes sweaters with zippers over the no zipper ones
---
I need the green screens of bob doing fortnite dances please
---
Yeah it's as if the only way to tackle a clan is to make/join a clan :thinking:
---
I didn't want to say anything better, I've already told you you're a weak fucktard which is all I wanted/needed to say, the 'weakling' comment is just a bonus so you realise how weak you really are for not being able to say no not even to yourself
---
I get a few more in at hydra. Sorry man. I was using blowy for a while. Does that meet your standards fuckface?
---
Genuinely, about 1/3.6
---
Please make it so you could access your equipment tab while banking. I rember it being a thing in rs2. Right now it's super annoying having to switch gear for clue scrolls of farm runs.
---
Thanks
---
Yup, this. In recent Microsoft standards password have to be a minimum of 15 characters long. However that's the only limitation it can all be in lower case if wanted.
---
Bandos Necklace and Smite Tiara.
---
Any chance I could get a hook up would like a Lil headstart
---
You're a fucking mental retard even suggesting that. 'youre retarded because you don't get more kills at a boss on a game than me'
---
Do you ever think if anyone actually give a flying fuck? 
---
Is your main account ‚ÄòK E R E M‚Äô? Enjoy your ban.
---
Damn, when did we get HD?
---
Reported you, hopefully there's info they can go off of to get you banned.
---
Yeah what lvl is your account
---
If Linux, why not use Kdenlive instead?
---

---
Can there be a world for chamber of xerics free for all?
---
Is this like in iron man 2 when the map of the Stark Expo turns out to be the blueprint for a new element? If we take the entire runescape map and model a circuit board out of it, do we discover the key to quantum computing or something? 
---
Can we be able to trade anima seeds at a 2:1 ratio, with the anima seed type you're trading in not being an option to get back?
---
did you do anything to make it hard to filter them?
---
Okay say you successfully delay the account for getting hijacked what then? 
---
To actually disable to Authenticator they need access to your email account, so they will be able to see all communications between you and Jagex, they‚Äôll know you are recovering your account and will just keep doing it until you LOCK DOWN your email account as the official advise says.
---
If they are recovering your account via the recovery form with all your personal information and are successful then, the person has all your info or you didn‚Äôt actually own the account. 
---
What's the song title?
---
Good for learning but thats about it. 
---
If they made it offhand you couldn't slap people with it so that's gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
yeah big chunk of this community is retarded and hypocritical we already know that
---
The future is now
---
Yea I'm still trying to recover from this.
---
Shut up and take my GP !!
---
I know a few people that get 5/6 kills a trip using the skip but I get 4 in Ancestral with 2 ppots 1 anti ven and a basiton pot and like 10-12 manta rays, I probably average 1:30 a kill, a bad kill is 1:40 and super fast ones are rng, I get 30-32 kills an hour and seems to be better GP
---
let me guess: you from america? 
---
Id do ba level 5 100 times before getting 99 rc, it's really not that bad 
---
It acts as a Graceful cape, but gives +9 to all defensive stats. If it's trimmed it also gives a prayer bonus. The Graceful cape gives none of that.
---
It also gives you a 100% run restore once per day.
---
It's just a better Graceful cape.
---
it‚Äôs either taken or a banned name. just because you haven‚Äôt seen anyone with it or you came up with it, doesn‚Äôt mean someone else hasn‚Äôt come up with the same name or used it
---
ATTACK GOOD!
---
Should've just said "sucks."
---
Not really, will look into it for sure! Any suggestions?
---
At the moment its selecting random usernames with different lengths, same goes for passwords, bank pin numbers and authentication codes. 
---
Maybe I will add random timing between actions and expand the username and password generation.
---
How long does 283 raids take
---
Oh buddy, You think I am stupid enough to put my actual account out there? Haha! You must be autistic. I have over 40 accounts with over 200m on them. Nothing is going to stop me. You made my night with that comment. Haha!
---
you secure the account, that's what. see what's up and change shit around. pretty basic. what reason do you have to be against it? 
---
actually idc what ur reason is lol ur wrong this is a harmless effective security measure and I'm in bed watching Netflix and don't wanna talk to you. no argue I win delay auth removal and hide poll results
---
this guy out here having more fun with this game than i ever will.
---
Give it a Mage helmet-style hood and I will pay what little money I have left
---
Alternatively, Melee helmet-style helmet for motorbikes
---
Yeah u ruined it. Wtg. Lol. Gotta start over again and use your brain next time kiddo
---
A ring of dueling and teleporting to castle wars is just fine, this is more of a Quality of Life improvement and there are other things you can buy for 16m that I believe will have greater use for you, unless you do stuff like Vorkath and God Wars Dungeon
---

---
I usually just run around acting like I have a bunch of expensive shit and that I don‚Äôt want to die. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt! Stop!‚Äù Then after 20 minutes of them chasing me, they get 5 body runes. It‚Äôs only really worth doing when I get caught with a clue, because they get nothing but bones, otherwise. 
---
Killing the wizards south of Falador is already a viable way of obtaining elemental talismans.
---
I thought this was funny.. 
---
Oh man Jad, i remember that as if it was yesterday, took me 7 damn tries, nearly cried when I finally got him. 
---
The number of people doesn't matter since it just comes down to preference, which is obviously weighed towards the pvm-side.
---
All that I was saying is that making an arbitrary exclusion of an activity just because it doesn't count doesn't speak the whole truth. 75 rc definitely can be achieved in the same amount of time than decent stats for doing end-game content. I'm not arguing which one is more fun, I'm just trying to point out a flaw in the logic
---
yeah thats facts. I miss the days where people would run you ess and the only payment was the runes you were crafting lol. Nature/law running was so nice.
---
Too true.. I have this t-shirt from the 2007merch website that I wear outside, everyone think it's just a generic shirt but my friends still know I'm autistic..

11 year old me would have broken both wings off the helm in under an hour.
---
Yeah!
---
&gt;implying that they have an inflated sense of uniqueness
---
Thanks for proving my point dude!
---
They do degrade. 10k resources gathered and then you gotta get new shards.
---
Then you probably got a poor education so you're extra fucked
---
Mask is 17.5% bonus over salve's 15% plus you get the att and str bonuses of a glory.
---
Are you incapable of doing that yourself? There is literally no reason they should spend dev time on implementing this
---
Personally I don't see the point in getting angry at PKers. Just stay silent and vote down their updates to actually hit em where it hurts.
---
Yes you do otherwise they keep spewing shit. I don‚Äôt know about you, but to me shit stinks. 
---
Why wouldn't you go and imbue salve, it takes 20 mins at most, it takes literally 3 mins with a slayer ring
---
Another stolen screenshot?
---
On one hand hilarious, on the other hand depressing that it‚Äôs all 100% true. 
---
Can we have some more temporary skill boosts as the current meta is to get within 5 levels and grind the spices for stew. You could introduce a potion and make a secondary ingredient as a money sink (eg 500k) or even a rare drop, which would stop people using it regularly. There are currently boosts for some non combat skills but not all. With these potions a guaranteed boost of +4 would ensure that whilst it is a significant boost, it wouldn't be the best which would still give an incentive for players to go for spices
---
Just got my first slayer perk (slay helm) and I am using Konar - what should i be spending my points on from here on out? also which of konar's tasks should i block?
---
Ok
---
Is there a quicker way to change to lunar spellbook? I'm currently teleporting to Camelot and running to Relekka. Is it best to get the sea boots? 
---
aww man was waiting for the Milly Rock

Is DHCB + rigour worth buying for vorkath right now? And is elite void worth grinding for?

Anyone born in 2000+ can only be 19 fucking years old at the most of course they are fragile that's young as shit. Better than being a dipshit retard like you at least most of them will grow out of it you are stuck with your dumbass brain. 
---
Can gargoyle's drop granite dust? this could be either in small amounts just like numulite, or a bigger drop, but rarer.
---
How is the mod's vision on super ranging potions being added to the entire game and not just in nmz. this could be implemented trough the new farming guild maybe?
---
Nah, that EHP needs changing, there's [footage of people getting 160k/h](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n4em-2NFdA), I've heard of people over 170. No way you should be getting anywhere near 100-115 if you're using 4 runners. 
---
Most people don't like PKers so why should they vote for updates to make the game better for people they don't like? If PKers want more of their updates to pass, they should try not being assholes to people minding their own business and improving their image a bit.

Loll

bruh how. The ratio 1 egg, 1 cup of flour, and a small splash of oil. then if it's too dry still you wet your hand down a bit and work the dough.

Seers with soary is 55k. Idkcwhere YOU get your rates, vut they're wrong. You cannot reach 57k at seers.
---
My biggest gripe is 1-77 or about that, early game rc is slower than any other skill, even agility
---
My life 
---
Cool idea but I dont know about that way of going about the sink.
---
Maybe just a boss where everything is lost on death no protect item
---
But then you have to balance it so that it can‚Äôt just be welfare geared efficiently
---
&gt; The point is it's an option that has SOME merit to it, and a lot of players use it.
---
Actually read my post, there is no merit to it, people only do it out of nostalgia.
---
&gt;However double chaos and other multiple runes having absolutely 0 reason to do is bad design and what I'm against
---
Again, read my post, its consistent in design to other skills, where lower tier production in the same method gets outclasses.
---
&gt;Anyways I listed the 3 major rc methods, books however are #4 though 
---
Ok at this point I'm entirely convinced you either know nothing about RC, didn't read my posts at all, and/or are too stupid to understand my posts because you don't have the necessary game knowledge so fuck off.
---
Or just change the death mechanics
---
I don‚Äôt get the runecrafting hate honestly, crafting lavas yields similar maybe even higher xp/hr than seers agility course, and the higher level RC content makes a stupid amount of gold.
---
Yikes im combat 89

Practice, practice, crying every night, convincing yourself nobody loves you, and then practice, practice, and practice some more until your parents threaten to kick you out of the house.
---
Can we please get rid of the "Boost" option on the Farming Cape (and maybe other capes of accomplishment, not sure if they have them)? It is completely pointless and doesn't help at all, just always end up misclicking when I want to teleport to the farming guild.  
---
Or at least, can the teleport be the option above the boost?  
---
Obviously, that boost works on some skills, but not farming  
---
Thank you /u/JagexGambit 
---
Turn your run off at the start of the kill. If you need to dodge an orange fireball hold Ctrl and then click 2 squares away. That way you'll run to those squares. 
---
Don't panic, and take your time. 
---
If you die don't forget to reclaim your stuff before going in again. Doing the voidgrind again would suck
---

---
This is really impressive
---
How high are you right now, op?
---
Huh, thought they fixed this when they updated some of the farming code.
---
Sounds like you should let support know that you‚Äôre confused, and that you‚Äôd like a more secure way of processing the request or maybe request for it to be sent to an alternative email? Because I dont believe a Jmod wouldn‚Äôt be able to help you in this situation as they would just refer to support

Can the Zeah achievement diary medium task ‚ÄúTravel to fairy ring South of Mount Karuulm‚Äù be reworked? It is lazy development that a requirement of this type is in 5 other diaries already. There is lots of possible content to put there instead, that fit into Kebos much better and feel more natural.  
---
Also can a minecart be added to Kebos? It only makes sense for a zeah transport system to be apart of that area.
---
I hear the GE has a few laying around
---
Focus on just using all your food in the fight before dying and hitting all your prayer switches. When you consistently can do that without dying right away you can start working on fighting back.
---
I already do all of that, except to practice part. I should make a pure

Happy to help.
---
Pretty sure that is a phishing scam bub. 
---
It's almost like it doesn't matter why some one votes only the fact that they do. There's no one sitting at the poles making sure you have a well thought out opinion on something before you vote for it.
---
This shit happens wherever open votes happen, be it state/federal vote/elections on ballets or in a game like this. He doesn't need to justify what he does.
---
It‚Äôs a challenge in terms of where you are fuckface. Wake up. Your not in the wow forms. Your not in the fortnite forms. Your not in the fucking poe forms. You fucking clicked here yourself you fucking retard. I don‚Äôt give a shit about flexing your epenis about how good you are at point and click shooters that you‚Äôve invested 16hrs a day into you sweaty neet. 
---
That‚Äôs like coming to a forum about lemonade and arguing for 4 days about how it‚Äôs more challenging to mix Gatorade instead. Like what nigga???? Go to your fucking Gatorade form and stay there prick nobody cares. 
---
I love how I‚Äôm the nub when your whining about making sire easier. Gl gettin the pet babe it‚Äôll take you  way longer than me :) 
---
Need more ways to collect Swamp Tar. Difficult to get as Ironman.  
---
Only monsters that drop it have high requirements behind them, e.g. Kraken and Zulrah.  
---
It's mainly used for the ammunition of Salamanders (The price for these are already dirt cheap, bringing in more wouldn't hurt the price).
---
I'd love to use a Salamander as a weapon, but it's locked behind Zulrah. And by doing Zulrah, I'd be interested in getting the blowpipe instead of the Tar/Salamander.
---
I'll make a separate app for it if I have time next week. How much would you pay for it?
---
Mackerel 
---
Scoff at her. Tell her it‚Äôs a mobile game and if she really loved you she‚Äôd know and understand. She wouldn‚Äôt make you choose. Then slap her tiddies a bit and finish that xp run you‚Äôre on. 
---
Thanks man, just waiting on my double xp now
---
When raids 1 was released jagex claimed that it was not possible to solo if I remember correctly. You are correct in that it scales but I think that was just a design for let‚Äôs say 5-20 man difference so as not to force players to get huge teams if they aren‚Äôt capable.
---
runescape 3
---
Why shouldn't it be? Those are very challenging gamemodes, they shouldn't have it as easy as the rest. The reason the gauntlet is challenging is due to how those gamemodes work at a core level - it wasn't made to be deliberately bad for them.
---
im saying equipping it locks you out of equipping other capes while you have items in it, so you cant do stuff like picking up 80% of arrows automatically or use god spells, infernal cape, and it should weigh a lot
---
I got rangers on my 2nd, 86th, and 96th medium scrolls
---
Inferno would definitely need a change too. Its balanced around blowpipe/range
---
Its also worth noting that in p2p there are some off hand items with some offensive stats that help bridge what would be a power gap.
---
fast weapons are preferred for anything you are typically killing a lot of, such as most Slayer monsters, this is partially  because you, on average are "wasting" less average damage.  For example, a monster has 2 hp, and your max hit with a 2h is 10.  Odds are much higher of wasting that high damage roll on a slower hit.
---
That said, its not always so cut and dry, depending on levels, what you're fighting and what weapon options are available to you
---
Slower harder hitting weapons are much more used in PvP for KO potential, though. 
---

Honestly, my plan is to get Rank 5 for every other role, then pay the 20M or whatever it is to have a clan get me Rank 5 Defender.
---
i like it by the herbs ty
---
That's so cleverini! 
---
Any word on Yama in the Chasm of Fire? 
---
Can you swap these for some bank notes then? Ya daft Irish bastard
---
Got mine at 1kc, doesn't seem that rare. Sold way above GE price too.
---
Bro its literally 125k+ on week days.
---
my comment was referring to back in 2014 when everyone thought they would have to ironman to max because the game was so fucking dead before the updates started.
---
You thinking afking crabs now? It shoudlnt be that you must equip it neither you have to equip herb sack lul. Think about mushroom wc for example there you could equip it.
---
IP change every few attempts using a VPN then lmao
---
I hate EOC I was part of the riot, and quit playing all together until osrs was released. What's your problem?
---
haha  nice one :D The sewers are actually occupied by skaven so there is a different questline related to them. Yould you do me a small favour? I left my book of grudges at the blue moon inn. Would you go pick that up for me?
---
And the rest is history :p
---
It got removed in one of the recent updates.
---
Can you add a new "Charm" equipment slot exclusive for items like blessings, or the proposed bonecrusher item: Items that provide a small or niche benefit, similar to a ring.
---
It would open up the use of the ammo slot for what its actually meant for, and give players that need to use ammo for their bow the same benefit as with a blowpipe
---
No mod response yet?

Not worried at all if he has a massive fungus ball on his shaft
---
Thoughts on adding roaming revs to the wilderness?
---
Also what would you think about having mineable essence at runecrafting altars to incentivise mining essence instead of gain essence from pvm, it would still be faster and more efficient to bank and use pouches but gives some love to the lost art of mining essence (below bloods and souls)
---
a checkmark? goodluck defending that shit, nike
---
Oh, I heard about it but didn't even care to watch it. Thanks!
---
It's not really a big deal to have case insensitive passwords. In the order of entropy, having a long password increases the exponent for number of possibilities where the number of valid characters is a smaller increase. 
---
Use a long password and ideally a combination of words (passphrase) or pseudorandom with a password manager will leave you much safer.
---
venezuelans would love this 
---
Yeah which is bait and I get filled and need to call ppl to bolt them off. Literally everyone is bait there or in bh world (which gets boring after a while)
---
Did that make more sense in your head?
---
Thanks!
---
If you are f2p then rune scimitar is the best weapon for damage
---
Can you remove the coin collecting effect from the ring of wealth, and add this somewhere more appropriate, as well as it requiring an unlock of some sorts.
---
For example in RS3 this mechanic is locked behind a dungeoneering reward. This new item could be a reward from the new Gauntlet update, or other content in prifdinas.
---
&gt;im in the wildy because PvP is fun.
---
Attacking some one that will not attack back is no different from safe spotting PvM. Your not versus anyone if there's no fight.
---
The "you never know what they're risking point" is then negated when you say that if you wanted GP you'd go do raids.
---
This whole argument of "if you dont like it dont go in the wildy" is lame and so akin to a straw man argument its frustrating to talk about. Is anything NEEDED to do in the wildy outside of ironman? No. Just like PvP dont NEED to do quests/skill to PvP. Dont want to die while trying to do a clue? drop the clue. Dont want to quest/skill to use a d scimmy? Use something else. 
---
You can see the issue with this for both sides. Content can be avoided but in reality you hurt yourself more avoiding it then just sucking it up and dealing with it for a small amount of time. Imagine if there was a mechanic to fuck with people doing quests to force them to redo the part they were on, even though there's no benefit to doing so for the person doing it. The person forcing people back and wasting time with no benefit to themselves would be seen as an asshole.
---
Didn't want to wait to buy them all. They have limits to how many you can buy at a time.
---
the plugin just showed u exactly what you'd see on ur screen...
---
Alright if I ever get a third I'll msg you
---
Every day we stray further from Saradomins light. 
---
Possibly. I don't know if I will be able to get a third pard that soon. In the meantime, try using wedoraids 
---
Combine with warriors helm and ring using a tentacle, I wonder how powerful it would be at bandos 
---
You mean reddit is not a single hivemind being? Well, waddaya know
---
With prifdinas can you rework the crystal weapons to not have their stats degrade and drastically increase the amount of charges they have, as well as potentially buffing the crystal bow, or make it more useful in someway?
---
In the meantime, try using wedoraids 
---
Underwater thieving in the agility thieving combo, too!
---
Yeah yeah keep telling yourself that &gt;:p just know one of your favorite quests is nearby

It's okay if you don't understand mate go back and talk politics 
---
ignore that dude haha, dont forget most rs players are virgins.
---
It really isn't. With 83 Magic for Magic Imbue and 75 RC for the giant pouch, you're topping out at 65k xp/hour making Lavas. The only other skills that are nearly as slow are Slayer and Agility. 
---
Jesus Christ how did you know

Many thanks for confirming this, i have now sent in a recovery request. i do have access to the original registered email, but do not seem to be getting any legit emails from jagex to this email so i have selected the "i do not have access to this email" option. Possibly the hacked changed my registered email without me noticing. Luckily i did not give them any sensitive information!

Not a single comma was used in that sentence.

Can you add an upgrade to the magic secateurs (crystal secateurs) that will significantly increase the speed of picking herbs?
---
Alternatively can you make farming consistent, and make herbs behave in the same way as limpwurt roots, having them all pick at once instead of 1 by 1. (would also apply to things other than herbs, like fruit trees or berries)
---
Time to alch that bitch
---
people need to realise that content can be made that doesnt cater to the entire playerbase. u dont have to do everything
---
Then maybe half of the risked gear! 
---
It‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs when they kill me and flame me the entire time when I did nothing to provoke them. If the PK‚Äôing community didn‚Äôt flame the shit out of everyone they killed, they might get better results in polls.

id prefer to just let cosmetic things be cosmetic tbh. feels like a waste of content to just randomly stick a perk on something already in the game for no reason
---
Jagex has been aware of this phishing method for years. Why were there no steps taken to stop this method?
---
For example why not [use codes instead of URLs](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ajguye/i_propose_jagex_emails_use_codes_instead_of_urls/)?
---
If you know you‚Äôre playing too much then cut down, if she‚Äôs wanting your attention 100% of the time then exit.
---
feels iike a waste of content to have content literally wasted tho
---
&gt;implying hitler was bad
---
Nice joke kiddo.
---
its not wasted though, the point was to be a cosmetic reward. it was never meant to have a use
---
Imagine being so dumb that you post a comment flaming someone for trying to help other people.
---
It helps that they're located on the back of the sweatshirt. I find big logos are easier to pull off when they're on the back vs on the front. 
---
honestly everything that's cosmetic is kind of wasted. 
---
You are wrong though. You werent even close. Real answer is roughly 3% with binomial probability.
---
Ah yes, I forgot they only released print screen last year.
---
Yeah man. 
---
Imagine caring about the community you exist in.
---
Maybe you'll figure that out in some capacity some day.

Yoo, I know that Trent guy and Vitka. Was that a pure clan ts?

I get that. But it isn't really worth making content like that when the target group for that kind of content is heavily against it.

Yes just yes!

Konar assigns Blue Dragons in the Catacombs, however there are only Brutal Blue Dragons. When she is checking combat level is she checking for normal Blue Dragons or Brutals because I can not kill them at all.

Unhealthy opinion based on jack shit.

Honestly the entire game is nothing more than pixels on a screen that you are wasting your time on.

He doesn't need to justify it, sure. But it's a retarded argument. "I'm going to ruin the gameplay experience for a certain group of people because I dislike them".

I don't think you can rationalise why something is/isn't fun. I'm not specifically going out to hunt innocent clue hunters (lol), but if I see someone who supposedly has nothing, why would I let them pass? Aren't I there to fight? 
---
One of the things I miss the most about Runescape was how you'd head into the Wilderness to complete a task, spend the entire time praying that a Pker doesn't show up, and finally getting out of there in relief that you never ran into anyone. It was a dangerous area that was full of excitement and thrill for both sides - now it's an "asshole" thing to attack non-PvPers. It's a bit of a shame, tbh. 
---
If you really feel like you'd benefit from doing Wilderness content, maybe you should try defending yourself instead of expecting a free pass? 
---
I'm going to.

I don't like that the crystal skilling weps are going to be replacing the usual dragon skilling items. Make them consume the item as well to ensure that only persons wishing to get the best xp rates would be using it.

Why is this stupid? They just enjoy a part of the game that doesn't give exp. Nothing wrong with that
---
I tend to only pull this on fire max capers

nowhere.  if you must buy back your gp with real money, buy bonds and sell them on the GE, but don't give money to the botters and scammers that run the gold buying sites, and at the same time risk yourself getting banned for real world trading....
---
exp waste
---
idk man shitposting suggestions to reddit already got my own pixels into the game so seems like its effective

Seriously hope this blows up, definitely agree this is a major problem in our community and I would love to see something put in place to protect our vulnerable players who lose any sort of enjoyable gaming experience because of this service offered in game.

Was there really negative feedback on a friend? I didnt see any...

---
Could the Boots of Brimstone be given the effect of Insulated boots? 
---
Because they don't give a fuck. non PVP/bounty world, they'll teleblock and snare you, and then keep snaring you just so you waste more time for having the audacity to not have any items because you're on a clue.
---
Or they'll crash the wildy agi course, again, just to be dicks. Nobody has loot, nobody is fighting back, yet god forbid I run back to the agi course with a ddp and inv of food, suddenly someone's hitting them and they're gonna abuse the obstacles to run and log, gotta protect those spades ya know.
---
Or they'll go farm people at green drags, never the high levels with all the good gear, no they might fight back, so instead they'll just use their 3 pures to go after a lvl 80 in whatever expendable gear they're wearing, after all, that lvl 80 working on slayer is totally a fair fight for two lvl 99 rangers and a lvl 99 mage.
---
And then, god forbid you go to the bounty hunter world to actually try and pvp. Fair fight? Fuck that, half the population is a group of 2-5 who simply wont leave multi combat, the actual target doesn't need to fight, that'd put them at risk, just hide behind his mates!
---
pvpers might be fine in theory. But the majority are just going out of their way to act like assholes so they can feel superior. It didn't start like that, but people who are assholes are more noteworthy, so they get heard about more, which means more people are ready to percieve them as assholes then it gets out of hand and now pkers and non pkers for the most part are assholes to eachother because it's the standard.
---
Chymstry does leech raids where you don't have to do anything, look him up on twitch
---
My guy. You need to explain a bit more than "it doesn't work" If you expect any real help. What do you think the issue is?
---
Absolutely. It's just a subject that isn't touched on very often and when it is, it's not given enough exposure for anything to happen. Gambling addiction is definitely a problem and there are plenty of addicts buying gold and staking it daily.
---
Imagine choosing to limit yourself to one life, and then whining that the game isn't easy enough for you to do dangerous activities.
---
Petition to allow us to get waves at the barber
---
Believe it or not this is a massive issue with the game whether people want to believe that or not. People with gambling problems struggle with any sort of self control and this is coming from someone who has experienced this first hand.
---
You‚Äôre prob clicking too much on resend so it keep refreshing the code faster than the email arrives
---
Cheers mate. It really is a big issue. People getting carried away because they have no self control and losing billions. As crazy as this sounds that can easily lead to depression/suicidal tendencies. Especially if they're sinking real life money in to it. 
---
Agility sucks. It's so funny how people talk about this game. It's like, almost everything in the game sucks and is a grind people don't want to do, yet we all play it. I've heard so many people say fuck runecrsfting, fuck agility, fuck mage training arena, fuck pest control, etc... It's like most of the shit we have to do blows and is no fun, and we admit it, but still play.

Why do either when you can get the same results by just thinking about pre runespan runecrafting
---
He only uploads for ad revenue
---
&gt; a gambling system in their game that's extremely problematic for many people.
---
No offence, but if they have a gambling addiction they should seek out professional help. 
---
&gt;  Some sort of block/self restriction should be put in place for people that want to quit.
---
If they're addicted to gambling, they **will** find away around the restrictions. They'll either disable it themselves or never set it up in the first place. If it is permanent, they'll complain at customer support to get it removed or they will find alternatives. Nothing stops them from using other accounts or doing high-risk PvP fights.
---
I'm sure there are plenty of players who don't have a gambling problem that frequent the duel arena. Having a self controlled 'opt out' button is something I don't think would help because people with problems would have to identify themselves as having a problem and if they could do that then they wouldnt need an 'opt out' button because they would quit. The only other option is jagex having an automated 'max daily gambling quantity' that's generic but that ruins it for everyone who has self control or players like myself that only go to the arena to try to win some extra gold for fun
---
He only uploads for ad revenue, pretty sad

Fuck off are you joking? They post memes about us every 3 seconds. Don't be such a snowflake. &amp; Cheers for the downvote.

They are compensating the lack of infernal cape with those huge lances, poor guys

Good plan, at least you'll get 200m follow-each-other as well in the process.

Not as powerful as 2 max hits, and nowhere near as powerful as range.
---
U know this will never be added into the game right?
---
Damn I always confuse the two. Should be pretty obvious though
---
Haha holy shit, *case in point*. Just enjoy your game ye, calm down boy. 
---
... 
---
And play dead content? I don't think so.
---
The problem with buffing skilling is that you're essentially asking "please make it so I have to spent less time playing the game because I don't like doing this even though I chose to do it." There's also the fact that skilling is an inherently simple task and making it like RS3 where you need to have the equivalent to a diary cape and then some to start skilling efficiently kinda defeats the purpose.
---
That's what I was thinking... the only solution is a blanket restriction over the whole game but then that's ruining the experience for everyone else because a few people have a problem and won't get help
---
That'd be hilarious but would make it to where you needed it to unlock the rewards after doing the quest. Not to mention that it may as well be a requirement even if it is for the memes
---
Raids 1 &amp; 2, some quests/zeah expansion. Dragon slayer 2. 
---
Make that 4 long bones and 3 nature talismans
---
There's still this bug where you can't get out of the fire cage in the last phase because the exit is located to the wall. So annoying they haven't fixed this yet.
---
Easy solution. Nothing but ddp's, not even food. Bleed them dry with poison and grabbing whatever loot from the occasional death. Basically just be really shitty right back to them until they decide to not be dicks.
---
Just buy a new one?

---
Yes ur a snowflake
---
But they are the best at being bad. Reddit is jealous.
---
I completely understand your points and somewhat agree. No offence taken. 
---
Not ALL players will find loopholes to continue gambling. Sometimes having that limit there is a reminder they have a problem and it can help to stop them from finding alternatives. 
---
Not all players can PK. Some are extremely lazy and when they realize they've reached their "weekly limit" at the Duel Arena they might turn away and go do something productive instead? Maybe the restriction could be IP based somehow? I don't know much about that, so apologies if it sounds stupid.
---
I think this could definitely help some people.

Surely orange icon not as slow as you purport it to be?
---
I know what semantics is. I am a linguistics major. It's entirely concerned with intended meaning, not how things **could** be perceived if you choose to ignore the intention behind them. Saying "not bad" implies something completely different from "not very good." Semantically, they might as well be opposites.

Regular salve is 15% for melee, salve (e) is 20% for melee, salve (ei) is 20% for melee, range or mage.

---
The state of your fashion sense lmfao
---
To be fair its his job, as it is with other youtubers. Doubt if it had 0 pay that most content creators would stick around, or upload nearly as frequently. And cant blame them. You dont do your job just for fun.
---
Also you can buy bonds and stake the gp, not sure how people can look past this lmao.
---
If you do go through with making this, you should check out Blizzard's Overwatch jacket and use the same materials. Hands down most comfortable thing I own but I haven't played Overwatch in at least 2 years. 
---
Note how it says salve (e) or (ei), however OP is asking about base salve which is only 15% boost before being enchanted after completion of tarns lair.
---
I like both. Soft spot for a friend though, been watching him for like 10 years or some shit.

---
I‚Äôm kinda new, what‚Äôs that rune to the left of the chaos runes?
---
I also returned a week ago - the 3 biggest updates are: dragon slayer 2; new BIS cape slot for ranged (Ava's assembler), the best money making method in the game is locked behind dragon slayer 2 also (vorkath).
---
Secondly, there's the inferno and infernal cape (hardest PvM challenge in the game). Basically a sequel to firecape and jad.
---
Thirdly, Raids 2 (theatre of blood) brought new BIS defensive melee gear, new BIS melee offhand (avernic defender), new BIS melee main hand (rapier) and what is comparable to TBOW for melee (scythe)
---
There's been other changes like fossil island and other quests but tbh quite a lot of it is dead content.
---
My thoughts are: You shouldn‚Äôt title something Stop Crying to get your point across. 
---
Not like I‚Äôd belittle myself by squandering my time with lesser PvM. 
---
You got any ideas to help then?

Dump her, find a new hoe

Honestly you're right, I just didn't want to be rude. 
---
what do people mean by authenticator delay?
---
I mean, any skilling method that breaks 1m gp/h is good in my book. Sure it's not vorkath or zulrah, but, ya know, pvmscape
---
I personally can easily sit down and gladly run double deaths/wrath runes for hours on end while holding a beer and watching twitch. Ask me to camp vork for more than a couple hours, though...
---
Plus, the exp rate of those very profitable methods is not bad at all. Comparable to zeah rc

Mining has way more variety. Motherlode mine, blast mining, volcanic mining , amethyst ores, gem rocks.

The ents and the mushrooms are great content for woodcutting, but the rest is just the same.. cutting trees.

Blowpipes akimbo
---
Well congrats on getting free. Do you actually think a system like this would have helped? Would you have opted in to the restriction or would you have needed it forced on you 
---
&gt;its also the only skill you can't boost as you train
---
What, do you do your slayer tasks with wild pies in your inventory?
---
Going to buy my 120 dungeoneering via mtx today!
---
This game is full with illogical stuff. The item that you're talking about is considered as a cosmetic and it is better to keep it this way.
---
But if they have no self control then what would make them opt in to the restriction?
---
Too bad it's at 5am here
---
Because poll results being shown helps them to pass content they want to work on instead of just what the community wants 
---
Would definitely opt into a restriction just to 100% make sure to progress in the right track :)
---
I would wear the SHIT out of this
---
Did you gold yourself and used alts to comment?
---
Answer: yes
---
I understand that now that you're on a good track. But do you think it would have helped you get out of it?
---
Sure you dont have to buy the xp but with all the constant promotions they run you still gain insane xp.
---
Im 70 farming on RS3 without ever planting a seed, im 75 hunter and ive no idea how to train it besides lamps and divine locations.
---
Ive never bought a single key, you just get that much xp handed to you for free.
---
I quit RS3 since everything is locked behind Priff for me now and am having a much better time on Os
---
i noticed that one too... $11
---
Only takes 50.1% otherwise to pass.
---
Because a lot of people want to help themselves but have no way of doing so... a step in the right direction would be great.
---
Highly recommend barb fishing till 60 or till 60 feels close enough to grind at Canifis personally helps me a lot. Barb fishing gives agility xp and it‚Äôs 1 click afk to 2-3 minute at lower levels 
---
For sure
---
Backrubs+carpal tunnel with one hand, osrs mobile+also carpal tunnel in the other.
---
You can switch to minnows at 82, its not as afk but its really not bad. Less xp/hr but more profit
---
There will still always be a gap on an edge wheree you can stand and not get hit by the fire.
---
Not really a question, more of a statement but something I found interesting. The 5xx worlds are packed with bots at Cave Horrors for some reason. Northern afk spot, all of them with the same set up. Cannon + Guthans. I know Black Masks have risen in price but surely there are better ways to utilize your bot farm?
---
Is that the only use for torag's hammer
---
lmao, honestly looks that way
---
Enjoy them whilst they last, theyre getting changed to keys tomorrow :(
---
doubles your compost actually and holds up to 10k, you put 5k compost and there are 10k uses :)
---
You spelled MAJOR wrong
---
Lol how embarrassing. Your grand opportunity to threaten me and you choose punch in the face. Your name IRL probably Sheldon and your bully let's u pick the flavor of jelly ur gonna eat out his ass. Lmfao neck
---
I agree, a lot of content is locked behind priff, and before you get to that point there is not much to do, besides the things you have in osrs too. But like i said, 70 Farming without planting a seed is not uncommon, but its so far of 99 still. I maxed my rs3 account a while ago and i had to do a lot of farm runs, and hunter to get to 99
---
go back to the_runecraft you dumb idiot
---
That depends on what exactly you're farming. If we go with toadflax, my route gives approximately:
---
9 patches \* 8 herbs (avg) \* 38.5  harvest XP + (9 \* 34 plant XP) + (9 \* 36 compost XP) = 3 402 XP
---
(not counting Falador XP boost and Catherby yield boost. Number of actual herbs gathered varies and influences XP. Obviously)
---
(2 pathces \* 120 plant XP) + (2 patches \* 674 check XP) + (45 havest XP \* X amount, minimum is 4) = 1768 (usually at least 6+ berries so more XP)
---
(6 patches \* 21.5 plant XP ) + (6 \* 26 supercompost XP) + (6 \* 120 harvest XP, this is fixed) = 1005 XP (you do this mainly for money)
---
1 yew tree in Farming guild: 81 plant XP + 36 ultracompost XP + 7069,9 check XP = 7186.9 XP
---
I don't do more trees cuz I think it takey way too much time and I CBA, I don't really care about farming XP, I do it for money and I'll get 99 when I get it.
---
And I do up to  5 runs a day (max out ardy cape 3's 5 teleports to farm), so my daily XP average XP is 13 361.9, so call it 13.5k farming XP a day. And my run averages about 150k after suplies so that's 750k GP a day just from that.
---
And as for fruit trees.... I don't do those anymore (I will probably get back to it tho), but for pineapples:
---
(6 patches \* 57 plant XP ) + ( 6 \* 4605.7 check XP)  + (6 patches \* 6 pineapples \* 21.5) = 28 750.2 XP.
---
Pineapples are protected by watermelons which cost virtually nothing (and I have 4k of those cuz I was doing watermelons for my early lvl allotments, which couldn't die as well due to marigold protecting them, but they take INSANE amount of time to harvest....) so your pineapples never die. Making this easy once a day 30k farming XP drop. They grow for 16 hours so I guess you could tryhard and do 3 runs in 2 days, but fuck that xD
---
Genuinely laughed
---
Go to a professional.

I did that specifically so people could see what he was using, sorry :(

Yes, it is dumb that people fall for this, but keep in mind they're in panic-mode. Their account somehow got locked and might think they've been hacked. Moments after their account got locked they receive an email from 'Jagex' with instructions as to how they can unlock their account. The timing here is crucial and makes it believable, especially when people lowered their guard in panic. Plus a lot of people aren't aware of this or even account recovery in general. 
---
They can fix it. It shouldn't even be that difficult. Here are a few examples:
---
 
---
1. Showing a clear warning message when opening the page.
---
2. Showing a reminder when submitting the ticket. 
---
3. Preventing the ticket from being deleted. 
---
4. Hiding the contents of the ticket, (At least until Jagex sees it.)
---
5. Preventing new accounts from making tickets.
---
I tought it was obvious that he let himself go after he stopped adventuring
---
Nice bro
---
What about leveling to complete clues? Like you can only unlock fairy rings when you get a clue that requires fairy rings. You can't do it unless it's a requirement, not just a shortcut or recommended

It's best xp rates but yeah sure
---
Enjoy your last few days on your account before it's perma banned for RWT! (Seriously. Buy bonds or buy nothing. Do NOT RWT.)
---
Buy bonds. You don't seem like you can handle 3rd party sites without getting scammed/hacked/phished again.
---
Yes. But my advice is to just jump in and see where you end up.
---
I think the most notable difference is that there is a new continent (Zeah), but you can skip most of the content for now and do stuff you are familiar with.
---
You can read up on information on this sub and the osrs wiki while doing some skilling.
---
I‚Äôm not sure honestly, it‚Äôs a really hard problem to even touch. If you do something that restricts the ability for an account to use the dual arena and it can‚Äôt be bypassed they could always have someone else to gamble for them. If they can‚Äôt do that then they might move to dicers anyway.
---
I can‚Äôt see any real solutions sadly.
---
They don't care about understanding, literally all they want to do is post "omg just make ur own clan why are you crying you shit nub", it's embarassing. 
---
I agree with u op. We r just stuck with toxic community hating the 2 same games back n forth just for some dumb rivalry of no reason. Its the same game. Couldn't even have 1 without having the other. I'm a comp caper on rs3 and I play osrs and hope to max it one day, I understand what u mean. None of them are easy scape, they both take hours and slowly years from our lives.
---
I would buy one!
---
Definitely a good first step... but not everyone can afford to take this step or may be to anxious to do so.
---
LOL ECKS DEE IM 12 BTW
---
This made me realize how bad we need du-rags in game 
---
Bahahhahahhahahahahaha I gottem guies look at me guies I gottem bahahahahhahahahahhahahhahahahahahbabahabbshabahahahba

Good one kid. Back to fortnight with you, you got school in the morning 
---
Whilst I dont like the fact that rare clue cosmetics are only ever worth close to alch value, more inventory space would change so much and need so much balancing it simply isnt worth the dev time
---
How much did u pay pink clay?
---
Smh 
---
Wow, Okay
---
Any plans on a second crack the clue?
---
This needs to be made so i can buy one. (All profits go twords helping the void knights update their island)
---
This dude is fucked.
---
I've seen more posts about people complaining about people complaining about Runecrafting than from people complaining about Runecrafting.
---
If the game was truly old school where PVM drops didnt devalue skilling into being nothing more than content gates this would be fine.
---
As it stands now new content should atleast cater to more people by being soloable. If they added a new big item behind content that required a group to complete it wouldnt be very healthy for the game having no real good alternatives to getting the item solo.
---
If the economy was still like it was in 2005 it wouldnt be such a big deal having content that isnt for everyone.
---
I guess I get it to a point... my thoughts tho are for people to get help they have to first identify that they have a problem so the issue I have with this idea is that it doesnt quite capture everyone that may be affected (gamblers that don't admit they have a problem) I could support this opt in idea but jagex would have to make it IP based like what happens to players who get IP banned but that doesnt always help... I guess the concern is there will almost always be a work around and there's also no real way of helping those who dont admit they have a problem yet. The only solution is a blanket restriction (which is, imo, unfair to the rest of the population) or taking away the ability of buying bonds to then sell for gp with real money which (for those who struggle or want a quick few mil) is unfair to the rest of the population. The real issue is 3rd party gp rwt sites. But those are already against the rules so players are breaking rules to then break rules. I guess I just dont understand how these issues can be addressed in a way that doesnt completely take out the duel arena
---
Yep.
---
But it doesn't have 75% in the poll?
---
I would wear one just for the fuck of it but the whole point would be as a joke. I bet anyone that does wear their merch in public would be the same.
---
Does taste even matter if you slam down a shark in .03 seconds?
---
I had to grind around 150 days of playtime (in a span of a year) to get to maxed stats from scratch
---
A monster hitting another player doesnt stop an ironman from getting loot. The other player has to deal damage to the monster.
---
If I didn't work at my school I would wear one there just to say fuck it. But I value the job and don't want to risk it.
---
It‚Äôs only 1m for 3 hours?
---
For something like this, a big list of SOCKS would be better than a VPN.
---
You do realise that historians collectively have never succeeded in finding even a single document, diary, letter or anything that shows Hitler having any connection to the """holocaust""" whatsoever? The closest they can get is orders to kill potential partisans when invading Russia. History isn't the cartoon you've been made out to believe it is.

&gt; It's not tested after i wrote it so it's likely that there are some mistakes as always, but shouldn't be anything too big.
---
Exactly this. The only thing they can do imo is invent a fun way of training runecrafting while being slightly less exp per hour as training it regular. I think the new skilling boss will be a step in the right direction to that. 
---
It‚Äôs all about that efficiency, it‚Äôs an important part of the game. Don‚Äôt let it get to you too much as you‚Äôll see it demotivates(for me at least) when you only want to do things efficiently. Enjoy the game through casual gameplay and when you need to grind for something that you want to do, go the efficient route. 
---
What do you expct from a post even a 5 year old kid would be too mature to make?
---
Of you genuinely enjoy RuneScape that much then she should respect that. You don‚Äôt rank shit in life like that, no one does. If she can‚Äôt handle that you like a game then she can go 3 tick fuck herself
---
Slayer tasks no because you can't get the slayer task without the level, but sometimes it is nice to boost to kill something like an abyssal demon with something besides spicy stews (wild pie) over an extended period of time.  Or to boost fishing/hunter while training them, or mining, woodcutting, etc.
---
Lol u don't have to use strong language...

Bad day?

Umm hello her BitMoji is hot???????
---
You realize a malicious person doesn't need to access your email account to disable auth, right?
---
I mean there is self exclusion, its called quitting, or now you can start an ironman. The problem with this is what if you get hacked, and the hacker is one of those "drop your void and fire cape" type hackers, you can bet he is going to the arena to further fuck your account up. It just wouldn't be fair. This post you wrote was 100% me. So I quit runescape for a year, came back, and now I don't have that issue anymore. 
---
Thank you for the clarification.
---
I'm fine with it having the highest ranged defence for the tier 70 bracket, but not a higher bracket. Seems a little odd to me
---
It works with the morytania patch that is 3-4 tiles away, I actually haven't tried the patch that is further away so I wouldn't be surprised if it did work. (Will check later)
---
And what do these keys do?
---
Or get the XXL and start losing weight like a madman
---
May not be a problem for you but definitely is for other people. Glad to hear you found a solution though.
---
That's how mafia works
---
You know what, you're right.  Torvesta/Framed/Other content creators should be banned for account sharing blatantly on their videos.
---
Jagex clearly explains the rule and under that statement and they explain when account sharing is against the rules.  It isn't just against the rules to account share for some things while it is for others. Its against the rules to account share in two specific circumstances which do not fit into account sharing to pk.
---
You may've watched a tad too much pornographic material

I met one of my good mates back in the day because I recognized his shirt which had an image of a blue partyhat and a caption that read "worth more than your whole bank" under it.

Wait don‚Äôt you guys actually think that?

Make this

Meet me in 362 I'll give you 5 fires 1 nat to alch yourself
---
Experiencing disconnecetion issues is inevitable, even if the servers from Jagex's side is fine. One's modem messing up or the ISP not operating properly is a 24/7 risk, so ever planning on doing pvm or combat activities on a hcim seems irresponsible if they plan on surviving.

Oculus has ASW, lowering the minimum requirements for a GPU. Vive also has shitty controllers and customer service.

Vive is overall better if you're on anything better than a 970 and lucky enough to have your controller trackpad break.

If anything, you're the person that should read better retard. 
---
The same way that I know my bank pin is pending removal. A big window or notification telling me so. Then I go into my email settings, force every other connection from my email, and change password. Verify I don't have a keylogger or something by doing it at another computer. Email resecured. Then go change my jagex passwords. Change my official email, and boom. Resecured.
---
If JaGeX was that smug they'd just put fake numbers on the "live polls" anyway.
---
I hope so too
---
So use your ignore list lmfao, why should you be nice to someone you're killing? I don't get this mentality, its an MMORPG, you aren't supposed to be nice to people you're fighting to the death or killing.
---
Ah, an intellectual I see. 
---
funnily enough I wrote my comment on a smartwatch during a lunchbreak, modern technology sure is amazing
---
Agreed, tbh a lot of the problem with this is that a high cb lvl + end game melee gear is for some reason seen as a player being high level. 
---
Rather than having a high total level.
---
Chaotic good creatures, they're hated but extremely useful in some respect.
---
&gt;You dont do your job just for fun.

Frequently, I do. Thanks.

Did you forget to open a new reddit tab or a movie? It really isn't that bad to afk while being entertained through other ways.

fake
---
They used shared accounts to lock down the rev cav on the 2200 world. But the total level is 1300 so I don't care
---
Currently have an alt 85 base melee working towards 90 that‚Äôs going to be strictly for killing time dragons to fuel my staking addiction lol :)
---
Would it be possible for the collection log to contain date and time and kill count for when an item is first obtained? Is that something that is tracked and could be added? How else am I going to be able to always brag about my low kc pets? Subsequent drops would not need date and time, only the first. 
---
It is once you've gotten used to the course. You barely have to click or pay attention. Bring up background entertainment and you're good to go, it essentially feels like cooking sharks or similar low intense activities.

Oof!

If you have it setup, You need to use an Authenticator on your phone to give you a code to use before you can put your password (if you haven‚Äôt got it set to once every 30 days). The lack of delay means hackers can just remove this feature instantly not giving us a chance to re enable it and change our details.

Kinda looks like Alec Steele‚Äôs logo
---
I'd wear the shi**r**t out of this, though
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt train it then‚Äù is the most ignorant thing I‚Äôve read on this subreddit. 
---
If people hated it and don‚Äôt want to train it, they obviously wouldn‚Äôt, unless they needed to unlock content. 
---
I‚Äôd actually wear this. Much better than the skill ones.
---
Good thing the UK quit the EU.
---
So only things like raids can be done in groups?
---
&gt;so many methods 
---
All of which are cancerous pre-77
---
Yeah those are perks of the diaries, not the diary cape. The cape isn't all that great, obviously diary rewards are.
---
unnecessary
---
i can drop all pics with a drop on ground :) except 1 pegs :) i havent saved those but i have all other drop with pics.
---
Afk/semi-afk meaning "low effort" with minimal intensity is what it means in the general high lvl community at least. I don't see the issue in referring to simple methods that you barely have to pay attention to, as "afk". The term has developed in the past decade+.
---
To be fair I didn't say they where bad, I was pointing out how it doesn't effect me
---
Auto mod says I need a category flair? Anyone know how to do that on mobile?
---
And the name runescape is just some alphabetical characters in a certain order but it still falls under copyright
---
I would be worried if 6 year old knew what porn hub means
---
No it took me about a half a second to scroll down and see how completely over-the-top blowing this out of proportion you are? Fourth grade reading level? yeah dude we‚Äôre all playing RuneScape. I wonder how many fourth-graders are also playing RuneScape with us.
---
I can't use a blowpipe, I'm only 70 Ranged
---
Unpopular opinion, I like BA.
---
For damage per hit, yes. Faster weapons, like Scimitars, are better dps though.
---
orange is the castle for me. and left of it is the bank. you van even see the crossroad south of it.
---
It is a thing. Jagex are working with the creators to get em done. I‚Äôd rather have this though. Only RS players would know and anyone else would just think ‚Äúcool hoodie‚Äù. The skill ones are a bit TOO much for me.

hmm I should check these ü§î
---
the only reason 120 is a reasonable goal in rs3 is because your xp rates are so high. its not the other way round lol
---
Its just jokes fam
---
Hope u get banned my dude
---
runelite has a timer for farming
---
That would be awful..... Remember guys, don't suicide in hell, it is practically heaven in such a comparison.
---
Seeing that the only times people wear skill capes is to fashionscape, can we get the option to combine skill cape with the infernal/fire cape.  This would retain the look of the skill cape except have a fire/infernal trim and would have the stats of the fire cape.  This would allow us to show off our hard work from our skill capes while not losing out on our strength bonus.
---
Reeeeeeeew

You guys just aren‚Äôt booing loud enough

Having to click every 3 seconds is not afk xD

Want
---
Again i have a pure bot account that has every skill over 50 and ALL of it was botted. I can make back my gold in a week of botting but i want it now. Yall think jagex has some godlike anticheat and it doesnt lol
---
Just kill the little ones? I have like 5 amulets and I was only trying to get the favor
---
i dont get ur argument on the game not being healthy if everything cant be solo'd seen as the same could be said for solo bosses not being able to be done in a group. just because u dont like something doesnt mean its not healthy for the game. i also dont understand how you managed to link skilling being devalued to group bosses but ok
---
Lol have a pure bot all skills over 50 pretty sure not getting banned 
---
I would like to understand. Could someone explain to me what‚Äôs going on?
---
14days
---
I personally don't think so, but ill admit ive never compared them so they very well might be.
---
nice repost
---
I'm sitting right around 300k scales right now
---
Yes
---
Its 140-150k/h with your own runners

And then they karma farm this meme
---
Sweet, just joined. I'm "joe hinch" at least for another 4 days lmao
---
Lol. Triggered.
---
NICE
---
I dunno, i find agility very easy to train with the runelite plugin. Its easy to click on the big green boxes and watch tv at the same time. Without that plugin though, cancer for sure
---
&gt;I've been doing a fair bit of deep wild nh bridding in the last 1-2 months, and from my experience, most of people who are there to PvP are completely civil, usually drop a 'gf' afterwards. Sure, there are a few who aren't, but the people running around naked and the PvMers are wayyyy more likely to be seriously toxic if you have the audacity to attack them. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;To be honest, I think that a lot of people just feel entitled to pass untouched if they're not there to PvP, which is pretty stupid imo. 
---
Made a pure last year and in the year or so I've pking on it now, 90% of the abuse I get is from when I attack people doing PvM. You get the odd person / team who will say shit as you die but it's far less common than the stuff PvMers come out with when you attack them.
---
A lot of them start with "Why?"... You're in the wilderness what do you mean why??
---
Is Group Ironman Mode being worked on?
---
Until Jagex goes out of business and no one can see the high scores anymore
---
you accidentally wrote agility instead of runecrafting
---
Any skillcape
---
It's like 9-10 clicks a minute at ardy if you don't imbue or alch, not really intense at all and barely requires attention. Can browse reddit or play browser games at the same time
---
&lt;3
---
Never Eat Shredded Wheat. Runs clockwise. 
---
Big one is just being sucked off by one of those little green aliens from toy story 
---
Got RC pet at lvl 21, never runecrafting again
---
There is literally no reason to make it an unsafe death except to punish those game modes. You're not bringing in any items you could lose, so it's only affecting those game modes. It's inconsistent with how one could expect such a boss to work as well. 
---
Nice try, RoT
---
And costs 14m/h
---
Android Wear? What app do you use for reddit on the watch? 
---
Scroll:g00000000000000000000000000000n
---
So you botted a few thousand xp. Godlike bot efficiency
---
Love messes up the important in-game progress too, for temporary satisfaction like you said. It's obvious what OP should do.
---
Weirdest shit ever but you can legally have a fire cape done if you have ever owned one.
---
Does anyone know where I can find the TOB release streams from people like b0aty, woox, sick nerd etc? I really can't find them
---
Give you loot. I just got 3 Magic seeds as a drop and it was a glorious sight! I get why keys make more sense, but it won't be as exciting.
---
In that case, you can also add prayer and firemaking to the list
---
Which isn‚Äôt a lot of you leave it until one of your last skills to max - which most people do.
---
Currently it's impossible to click on anything in the game world whilst in the deposit box interface, can this be changed?
---
Definitely not a keeper
---
are you fucking mentally retarded or what ? fucking spastic kid
---
Sub 1 year relationship? You're supposed to barely play until you're 3+ years in and well in love, so well in love that she wouldn't leave you because you've been playing your game more and more "lately"
---
Anyway cut your losses and employ an effective strategy with the next one
---
So it becomes slightly less click intensive at 90 agility or w/e it is. Agility is aids.
---
Now you want to blow two pipes?
---
Whore.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs when they kill me and flame me the entire time when I did nothing to provoke them. If the PK‚Äôing community didn‚Äôt flame the shit out of everyone they killed, they might get better results in polls.
---
Pvmers acting like they're any less toxic than pkers will always be funny
---
Oh sorry mum didn't know this was a sensitive platform with little kids getting offended by some 'strong' language please forgive me...
---
Ardy has a 90 Agility requirement...

tell that to the spec of the dragon hasta, where you can see the red outline of the d sword during the same animation and hear the sound of vesta's longsword from DMM.

yikes rot you're desperate

People giving advice yet don't even know the full context or situation. How long have you been together? How much time do you see her vs how much time do you play per week? 
---
Don't just drop it, especially if you enjoy it...

Cut time on the game sure, but there's more we need to know than two messages in a snapchat conversation 
---
None cus im poor
---
Do you lose your items if you die in a crypt ?
---
I love how people seem to think that the Authenticator is fucking bullet proof. It‚Äôs absolutely nothing to anyone who knows what they‚Äôre actually doing.
---
It's true for medium clues Source: Ranger boots are big part of profit
---
It should be left right where it is. These items should never be bis due to their rarity 
---
Literally go to hell
---
What about work or school? Not to mention showering and shitting... Where‚Äôs the time for all those!? 
---
Runecrafting pre 77 is bad jagex 
---
Nope. You can go back and get them even if you die in the crypt
---
Few thousand? Try 27 million lol
---
Yeah I hope you get banned you piece of shit.
---
Play mobile under the table at dinner
---
Yeah I only ever farm when I'm at work on mobile and I'm level 78 farming now just from logging in at break. It's perfect for mobile and even better now there are farming contracts. Absolutely love the skill and I hated it when it came out.
---
No it hasn't... Not yet lol
---
No one, I just enjoy a good challenge.
---
Water storage things
---
Jed is still walking around free so idk what your point is laddus
---
and that shouldnt be the solution to the problem. when you click out of the box (as you normally would if the prison wasnt against a wall) your character wont direct itself to that tile, it will sit on the corner of the prison. this makes dodging damage when this happens much more difficult than ususal. 
---
thats not the way it should be; the prison should not land you up against a wall period. 
---
What you asking us for? We don‚Äôt know how good the dick is.
---
Lol i wont 
---
*i n s e r t*
---
The one at weiss has a tele to literally 3 tiles away...
---
GZ DUDE!!
---
I don't see how that links in to what I said
---
Federal prison ironman btw
---
you technically can get out by standing on the tile where the exit would be (because IIRC you could not escape it in the past) but i 100 percent agree that this is a fucked up mechanic and needs to be changed.
---
For all we know he could play for 3 hours a day and she‚Äôs needy.
---
If you find on this then she‚Äôll own you. Plus there‚Äôs a decent chance it won‚Äôt work out then you‚Äôll fall back on rs and wish you hadn‚Äôt missed out on all the xp while you were gone
---
Repost? My bad first thing that came to mind 
---
Even if you don't want to pay for the scroll you can use the ectophial and walk like 20 steps to the boat.
---
Neat!
---
Nice kd
---
1 hour a day...on runescape?
---
It definitely was released in 2005 to be trioed. Same with GWD, it was for small teams. It's mainly due to power creep and us knowing game mechanics better that you can solo them now.
---
Could the sextant (for clue scroll steps) be integrated into the world map?
---
Of course. It‚Äôs funny to comeback isn‚Äôt it

that's the best saying I've heard in long time.

---
Lol..
---
You'd be surprised, the biomes are quite huge and seamlessly blend in with one another.
---
Thanks 
---
Nay, twas i!
---
In the past they've said they wont do this because it would use too many item id's or something. 
---
Have you ever played a game on mobile? You can simulate 2 joysticks on the screen so your theory is wrong.
---
Western elite
---
Lol not thratening anyone, I would really just love a chance to give you a good clear punch in the face. You're probably too socially awkward to start a phrase without stuttering or even socialize as hole, you can deny it as much as you want but I can feel the rage of you typing this shitty as comments all day so don't even come projecting your own high school experience at me.
---
Problematic gambling in any form is something you should seek professional help with. Its a mental problem and asking a game company to help you stop will likely cause you to lash out in a more damaging to IRL situation.
---
Nay, t'was i!
---
This is statistically pretty much impossible. Good job.

If there was ever a chain of comments to demonstrate how ridiculous RoT apologists are, this is it.

He‚Äôs listening to you before you accept the call btw

Yeah... don't watch it.

Why ask for dual blowpipes when instead you can ask for a Bagpipe made out of blowpipes?
---
why have only two when you can have 3, 4 or even 5?

Think about it... just let that idea sink in.

Oh my fucking you are actually this fucking stupid aren't you?

okay, but the drop rate of uniques are far, far worse than GWD so your point is moot. of course its all maxed players on the pet hunt saying this stuff, but when you look at it objectively this is a LEVEL 75 SLAYER BOSS. for its difficulty, it should be more profitable, or its drops should be less rare and in line with others. i know no other boss that has drop rates of 1/750, 1/1000, 1/500 etc. its usually 1/128, 1/256, 1/512, 1/2000, 1/3000, etc. even god wars follows this criteria, so youre far more likely to get a rare there and IMO GWD is far easier than these bosses. 
---
either you run laps (sara), DWH spec then whip (zammy, bandos), or sit in a corner and throw chins (arma). none of these bosses have several phases. i find that incredibly odd and stupid. 
---
Yeah agree. I mean look at slayer -- quite a lot of people train it inefficiently with likely even worse xp rates than RC's, but at least it's interesting, and few ppl complain in comparison. 
---
It's the journey that matters, broh, not the destination.^^^^^/s

Fr tho, I dont even play this game though, I'm just here for the memes.

I am closing in on 600. Hang in there!! It sucks but it happens.

Whilst what? Tf is dripping?

How did you have so much patience?

Grats!

If you do it right you wont gain any xp thats the point ya dummy

Yeah that would be great

Or

They could just not put a herb patch and instead put something unique like a crystal tree patch or something. I‚Äôd prefer that.
---
I don‚Äôt get the aggression in your post. If he‚Äôs repeatedly ignoring her to play RuneScape, that sounds like an unhealthy relationship. She isn‚Äôt setting an ultimatum, she‚Äôs just voicing what she wants from the relationship. That‚Äôs not a bad thing.
---
No u
---
100% bullshit. As if he can consistently predict the next 4 or 5 contracts and they all happen to use different patches. The amount of times I've had 3 herb contracts in a row... smh.
---
He's investing in his youtube career lmao
---
The only thing I agree with is that I feel like I should be getting more than what I get for $11/month. I was paying $5/mo for basically the same game like a decade ago.
---
Compare $11 to what you would get from game pass for example. I know, apples to oranges, but if a bag of oranges costs as much as one apple....
---
I feel bad for a friend ;-; stop hating and let him be, it's not like you bitching about it will do anything. If you don't like him don't watch him
---
Okie !RemindMe 1 month kdenlive
---
Could a [reset-able] average kill time be added to the boss log?
---
Nah it really depends on the situation. Obviously if you just enjoy the game it's fine and she should accept that. But when it comes to being addicted and cancelling dates because you want to play Runescape for a couple of hours more, it starts being a problem. 
---
But its like I did play the lottery and they won :D
---
Exactly, drop her lame ass
---
Why should it not be how it works?
---
It changes it from being a trivial, click anywhere outside the box, to actually clicking the correct spot.
---
If anything I'd prefer if you actually had to click the correct missing tile even when its in the centre of the room, as it is it's just an absolutely worthless mechanic.
---
If she can‚Äôt love you for who you are then forget her

So less afk at 90 agility lmao
---
Nah its fine i have a bank pin and authenticator now. But thanks for your concern. I think ill just wait a week tho until my bot accounts make me some mils
---
U have been forgiven sir...
---
I'd be fine with that, though not for prayer as that's a combat stat and you can't boost to use a better weapon, so you shouldn't be able to boost for better prayers.  Boosting past your full prayer points is already a thing though.

---
Okah thank you! I only have died in the tunnel rooms
---
No, you tit, they explain the rule right there, it's just clear how they enforce it is under their discretion, so you saying "it's totally not against the rules" as some definitive argument is pointless. 
---
Not to mention the exposure.
---
Yes it was.
---
No that is only for non-bosses, if a boss damages another player then the ironman won't get any loot. 
---
They implemented this so people can't tank bosses like bandos on their mains while racking up kc and gear on their BTW.
---
Maybe the people in charge didn't leave paper trails.  How about reading one of his works, and when he talks about jews he talks about them as if they're dirty rodents or pests.  Do you really think that holocaust survivors were just making shit up?  You're one of those holocaust deniers? He didn't have connections to the holocaust? Lmfao get out of here you joke
---
Depends what you value more, time or money. In my case time is money because I could be doing raids in the the 300 hours saved.
---
That‚Äôs my approach to every skill, I take the most costly/efficient route, and make the money back doing things I enjoy.

Just get to 90 agility lol

Obvious troll is obvious lol
---
Maybe we should have a special pin for when you log into your account?
---
Ye, slayer is the best example that slow exp does not necessarily mean bad. Just make rc more interresting, does't have to be faster (although I'm personally not against making it a bit faster if they feel the need to) 
---
Yea I remember. Try not to focus on how long it‚Äôs taking, I think I did from 44 nats, then double cosmics, then ZMI once I got high 60‚Äôs/70‚Äôs. Can‚Äôt remember that was like almost 2 years ago lol
---
Wow nice! One time I died at Bandos, my team left and I went back to grab my stuff. Some guy was there and got a BCP drop when I went in. I called him lucky and got my stuff. Graardor spawned while I finished grabbing my gear so I helped the guy get another kill. Dude got a tassy drop. Back to back BCP and Tassy. I asked if he'd be nice enough to split and he gave me 100k... I guess it's better than nothing.
---
It's pretty impressive the degree to which you're living entirely in your own fantasy

Nah, Devon, England lol. Rural village but the investment in technology for these parts is shocking. Everywhere else has fibre optic bar us

They do send a mail to you where you have to disable your auth. Or am I missing something?

its a pve game, no doubt. But i was never into pking, so i dont really care about that side of the game tbh

Same. I got charged for 17$ trying to claim it...

be able to slash webs with any sharp object wielded **or in inventory**. Similarly ability to put clue scroll emote items back in stash **while theyre still equiped.** please
---
It's cus the one in Menaphos is just a bank with one GE clerk
---
theres a prompt for 7 days when you set a pin on your account before it goes on, what delay are you talking about? delay for it to be removed? as in a hacker can just log on, disable your authenticator and carry on?
---
if so, they already have access to your authenticator...

I thought it was 1/100. I got two on my first task there.

I don't think they made the decision explicitly for HCIM, it's more than they're choosing not to do what they did for Xeric.

The normal state of any content should be a real death.

Blizzards passwords are case-insensitive too
---
i mean why would a 6 year old ask about some random guys shirt lol
---
Personally, I like it to an extent. There were always cosmetic items in RS, even at the very beginning of RS2. 
---
Items like this are nice, they work as an achievement and a way to customize your character a little bit.
---
I'm pretty open to cosmetics as long as they never introduce the following into OSRS: buyables from a store, transmog, and they keep away from the ridiculous designs used in RS3
---

Write a script the collects usernames from highscore list. It'll be much harder to filter out.

Ah I want graceful for questing and I don‚Äôt want strength xp is the problem, aiming to get the cape with 85cb and I can manage that with ranging all my slayer tasks til 69 slayer. I‚Äôll defo look into it for after I have the cape
---
Nah I don‚Äôt mind it. They are just re-colours which makes it different. Otherwise you‚Äôll be seeing the same gear over and over again. This way you can customize it a bit.
---
Negative impact on the economy
---
Blizzards passwords are not case sensitive either, and it's not that big of a deal. 
---
Hackers won't be bruteforcing your password, usually, anyway.
---
Its a taaaarp
---
You're allowed to use them, and they are safe. I recommend using Runelite. Just make sure to download it from the proper website.
---
I had some better luck hehe.
---
With the clear need for extra bank space, as is evident by the recent polling of the seed vault, can we get a rework of the POH storage chests, so that players can store individual pieces of sets, rather than needing the whole set first, As well as allow them to put in both male and female variants of items.
---
Nah ur fine. Most ppl use it anyways. Even private versions of it are common and seemingly safe as long as u compile it urself
---
Just right click dismiss, they always come back anyway 
---
Ok, ill keep that in mind when i download it. 
---
Just saw 190k/hr at 97 rc with 4 runners.
---
Are they actually planning on adding Prif? Cause it was like every guild in the game in 1 area on Rs3 and I don't want that in osrs.
---
Yeah, fuck those mystic robe reskins, there should only be one!
---
i‚Äôm 99 and even i disagree with that
---
it‚Äôs too fuckin slow. 
---
4 runners also costs around 18m-20m/hr though.
---
Do you actually read what you write before hitting reply? cause its mega cringe and just makes you look like a tool
---
"11 FUCKING DOLLARS
---
A MONTH"
---
I lost my shit
---
Loosen up bro. Dude clearly enjoys the game if he cares about unidentified minerals this is how I talk in game and to my friends in real life too.. cocksucker.
---
pretty cool imo
---
What kind of kill times could I get with 75/75 and mid-level gear? Blowpipe + trident, but none of the Zenyte stuff. 
---
Jagex, you‚Äôve done it again
---
Great case of shoot first ask questions later
---
I hope they dont take 5 years to investiagte this though.
---
I cant make something like that, i was thinking of downloading one
---
and a cactus growing off the balls
---
I did something similar when I needed a Callisto kill for the diary. Some guy helped me lure him and I got a dragon pickaxe. Gave him the pick, no split. :)
---
If you can feel rage then it's you, right dickhead? Your whole reply is just a giant projection LOOOOL. You're that kid who said I don't care that u broke ur elbow incarnate LOOOl. Your bully wants to bust them cheeks today, better go wash up after the eternal runecrafting grind to level 3 am I right LOOOL. Genetic dead end. 
---
It's macroefficient to hire runners if you make over 8m/hr profit consistently.  Raids/flipping can achieve that.
---
Hellllllll no
---
Genuinely curious. I just started osrs a few months ago and botting is way easier
---
Back in *my* day there was no ge. 
---
üòé
---
Rune, iconic appearance
---
Make sure you ONLY download it from runelite.net any other site will get your account stolen.
---
link? or just a joke? im intrigued 
---
the only high rc requirements are for diaries, which provide useful buffs for existing content, but little/no content is actually locked behind them. 
---
i'd even say that for most players the time spent on completing the diary reqs is more valuable than the time saved from the diary rewards, so diaries are more for completionists and people who are aiming for a high total level in the first place, or for people who invest many more hours than the average player, so that they'll gain a greater amount from the rewards than they invested in the reqs. 
---
even if that was a valid argument, that would be more of a problem with the way that rewards unrelated to skilling are locked behind high skill levels, it wouldn't be a valid complaint against rc training.
---
Even funnier when it‚Äôs an ironmemes 
---
Thats bait...
---
why do you even play when a programm plays for you, that makes no sense
---
Wrath
---
No, rigour is on par with piety, look at the numbers. In fact they released a mage and range turmoil equivalent in rs3 because turmoil was so much better.
---
honestly... if you compare how much hates goes from this sub towards the rs3 players is like 10x the amound they rage about us. they have good conversations and talks about QoL and how good our updates are and see osrs as a part from them and to coexist.
---
but all you read on this sub is hate and toxicity trying to proof why osrs is so much better than rs3... if you dont want to get fogged by the way this sub looks at rs3 try and keep open minded about rs3. sure they fcked up some stuff and the game is slowly dying but jagex can learn from the mistakes they did there and dont make history repeat.
---
Go to rogues den, world 2, and look for people just standing, facing the wall and occasionally clicking and going back to facing the wall. Also look for people using the bank chest (instead of Emerald the npc) and then standing on the fire while cooking. Second one isn‚Äôt a guarantee, but if they‚Äôre constantly doing it, I‚Äôm inclined to believe they‚Äôre botting. 
---
Chicken fingers and cha-la-peno chips for best combo food
---
You just dont understand how important the skill is, regardless of how boring it is.  It helps you train Runecrafting more efficiently.
---
He deleted it. What did it say?
---
Yea lol still work
---
Negatively impacts the economy, and also has a knock on effect across the board as measures have to be taken to prevent bots from being able to do certain things easily. So essentially it makes everything more effort to do and less rewarding.
---
It's also generally pretty lame and defeats the point of vaeious achievements or milestones. 
---
Only people vulnerable are the noobs who don‚Äôt know other spots and that shits old to me at least it‚Äôs like laughing st your own jokes that you saw someone else do
---
Tbh i thought it was factorio on forst glance.
---
it‚Äôs not efficient to do runners over lavas though. 
---
Assuming starting at 75:
---
12M / 150K = 80, 12M / 75K = 160, so you save 80 hours compared to lavas
---
the total cost would be 80 * 20M = 1,600M for 99
---
Thus, in the 80 hours saved, you would need to be making 40M/hr to break even 
---
Really? Petty insults? How about you research a little.

Mod Mat K Clearing some stuff up regarding account sharing: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3dnb5n/nobody_on_osrs_has_ever_been_banned_for_account/ct74ufh
---
Mod Kelvin (Head of Customer Support) Speaking about the Account Sharing rule:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3dnb5n/nobody_on_osrs_has_ever_been_banned_for_account/ct74ufh
---
If you want ROT banned, first you need to somehow prove (which I've yet to see a single shred of evidence) that they are account sharing.  Next, you need to somehow find how that fits into what the mods have stated constitutes as a violation of account sharing (simply using someone else's account for X purpose will not get you banned).  Which just so happens that account sharing for activities like pking is not amongst those detailed by Jagex, so good luck.

When I lived just outside my town at my mum's house we had 200kb/s upload, now I live in town now and get 110mb/s.
---
Pretty sure youre just baiting..cant tell if actually stupid, but I'll bite. 
---
Biggest reason? They destroy the economy. Anyone with a half simple minded brain can figure that out. Items that are normally only gotten through tedious, unwanted tasks start getting botted which means more comes into circulation which means the price crashes for that item. And etc etc etc. 
---
Not sure if youre a troll or just 12. 
---
Hell yeah dude, where do I sign up to open a big old can of whoop on yours truly, and by that I mean I‚Äôm ready to fight and die a load to teach these kids a lesson about looting my stuff.

No, i'm saying that there will be people regardless of polls being hidden or not, who will not vote in good faith. Currently these people may or may not be influenced by what is already winning, however will poll results hidden, these people may just vote randomly or just look at what their favourite content creator is voting for.
---
Yeah, i can imagine people trying to scam you with downloading a scam version. 
---
!remind me 24 hours
---
No that‚Äôs a bank pin. The Authenticator requires you to input a unique 6 digit code in the login screen before you can even get to the field to type your password to get onto the account. 
---
Se should be able to inflate them and play sports with them too then so we can be more historically accurate

Honestly edgelords are so fucking boring.

Not about killing or winning the battle, it‚Äôs about slaughtering and ending the war.

you don't have to put authenticator in until after password? doesnt make sense to before because there isnt a login request sent to jamflex until after you enter password and press login. you're starting to make me think this is just copy paste whining, still haven't said what delay you're talking about

I just want one simple thing. Please make ‚Äúspace‚Äù a priority over any other players when I wanna place my birdhouse.

500m xp on RS3 with Mallory, used to have a phat.  Quit because MTX.
---
I do have a gambling addiction, been following for years. "Professional help" just doesn't work. They can give you tips and shit yeah. But that's not how you fix the problem.
---
Every time i see these time of post there's always that same answer of "of if you have addiction you'll find a way around it". That's true in a way for some, but not everyone.
---
Me personally what helped me with gambling addiction is just trying to stay away from place/people or just any situation that gambling could be an easy option. So if i know i gotta go completely out of my way to gamble im gonna rethink all the outcomes of it if i go gamble and that it's gonna be negative at the end so it keeps me away.
---
On Rs that's completely a different thing tho. I just can't stay away from duel arena, i can stay away from a while. 
---
Then one night, ring of dueling just sit there in bank, cash stack/gear, tent ..... anddd there it goes "remove all my gear, take ring, rub,spam the 1 key, run to duel arena....." at that point i can't think of anything else and once i start well 99.99% of chance walk out of there cleaned.
---
So yeah, for anyone who doesn't have this addiction problem it's easy to say "oh you'll still do it or wtv" that's not true at all. It might be for some but not every one.
---
This has come up so many times and duel arena ruined the game for so many people. Yes it's their problem they went and staked their whole bank they can't blame anyone else but gambling addiction is something that's hard to stop so just being able to add a self exclude option, it would help.
---
In Casinos, you can Self Exclude. I did a few years ago and that's the best thing i could of done. There's literally NO reason why some people would even be against that idea, if you dont have gambling issue then it doesn't concern you at all.

THE AUTHENTICATOR! you need to put that 6 digit code before you can put it in your username and password. The hell are you struggling to understand here man? The Authenticator isn‚Äôt there by default, you gotta set one up.
---
Perhaps make it so it has different intervals, then they will need to check every entry. 
---
What do you mean? I basically said 120 in rs3 = 99 in osrs because of the xp rates.
---
Rc doesn‚Äôt start to make 1m/h till you bloods at 77, maybe? I have to double check that. Otherwise, at 94 you can start making double Nats.

dude im talking about the authenticator. you dont just type in username and authenticator prompt pops up, you put your password in first. im struggling to understand what fucking delay people want added to the game, and you havent explained that at all, just tried to teach me what an authenticator is which you dont understand anyway lol
---
But there already were 3 different sets
---
I‚Äôve played it. Early game is fun and very rewarding. I got like 975 total but I can‚Äôt imagine what the game mode is like once you enter mid game. I get the appeal, and the account IS fun, but I don‚Äôt really see myself putting some serious time into it. Maybe one day tho...

---
It‚Äôs a halfway decent idea, but as someone who just left rs3 for oldschool a few months ago. I do not want to see a new tier of weaponry come out any time soon. Rs3 is already on t 92 and I have a feeling they‚Äôre thinking of ideas for t 95. I understand we are back in t 70s still but I just dont want this game evolving too fast. Rs3 is on the verge of having to push their skills to 120 to fill content because they are running out of room for new tiers of weapons. And with the constant demand for new bosses.. it‚Äôs a slippery slope, and I just am not ready for that on oldschool.

That's not what opening clue scrolls on Entrana is for - the clues filter out weapons, so it re-rolls for each weapon it may have hit on the drop table for something else. People open them there for good god pages and other higher value items from lower level clues.
---
and if they "have enough info" to disable it, meaning they have the device your authenticator is on, or have access to it, you should be concerned about identity theft first and foremost, irl bank info, emails etc
---
IMO putting more effort and less time into a skill is better than putting less effort and more time into a skill because stuff gets boring while repeating the same action for 2 1/2 hours only to gain 1 level at 63 rc.

No one has to do multitraining methods if they're 1 ehp, you can just do whatever tasks you prefer. I don't like aerial fishing so I don't do it, I do like underwater agility so I do it.

I am on the fence about whether zmi running should be removed. It's over double the xp rate of everything else that has been available and the damage has already been done.

Peoples problems with the lack of delay is a hacker can just request the Authenticator to be removed and bypass the need for it altogether BECAUSE THERES NO DELAY ON REMOVING THE AUTHENTICATOR. Basically if a hacker does that, we have no time to change our password which is the next step for them to taking the account.
---
I mean, mystic sets are fine. They've been in since slayer came out, if not a little after.
---
Can you inbox me a screenshot of your ban meter so I can see why you are muted?
---
Sure.  As long as no other skill or content ever gets updated, and preferably goes back to how it was when osrs was released, I'm fine with that.
---
I'm an Ironman in F2P leveling Magic (currently at 24), but I don't know which spells to use, because I want to train RC along, and therefore which runes to craft.
---
As soon as I finish all F2P quests I'll go with P2P free trial (acquirable via mobile) and then I'll save to actually pay for it.
---
Idk man I prefer con cape to teleport POH and refill my stats then banking at edge or farm guild. Craft cape Telly is useless and I‚Äôve had it forever 
---
The only reason I'm still not sure if I'm going to max. Makes runecraft look like cooking.
---
Only if it is reclaimable on disassembly or with no disassembly feature period, with said change also rolled out to the Zulrah mutagens imo. Makes no sense to go grind a 1/5k (or worse) item to just lose it completely if you decide later to disassemble for whatever reason.
---
Don‚Äôt threaten me with a good time 
---
They have over 100 people with 2200 total they aren‚Äôt sharing 20 account lmao
---
You would have to be one hairy, fat nerd to not like this idea. 
---
So what it‚Äôs like a 2 million way tie for first? 
---
Even in places intentionally designed to be unsafe, people want safe spaces.... smh damn lefties.
---
Was killing KBD for the first time with a buddy of mine in hopes of getting heads for slayer helm. Some dude 120+ came and attempted to crash. The 2nd or 3rd kill after he crashed there was a d pick drop that I was lucky to get. Taunted the guy and then teled out and split with my buddy. 
---
18m/h\* and makes it p2w.  Make it so you can't do this method with runners, or increase the exp/hr IMO.
---
Bro I think you sold your soul to Zamorak to get this....
---
Thicc dicc is thicc
---
Gummo not gummy
---
Pretty sure Zee Kev is in Apex now 
---
You don‚Äôt care about logic, literally all you want to do is post ‚Äúomg rot bad‚Äù, it‚Äôs embarrassing.
---
And how long has it been since rooftops were introduced? 
---
Eh. why not.
---
Unless you average 5M+/hr consistently it isn't really worth paying for runners lol.  IMO they should make running at zmi not a thing (maybe so you can't trade there) or increase the exp/hr so that running isn't the only fast method.
---
I grinded RC till my arms fell off pretty much. Don‚Äôt think I can ever do it again tbh. But I got level 9 so at least that‚Äôs something.
---
Yeah because adding pandas went great with wow! Lol hell naaa 
---
You could do Ardougne Tele -&gt; Ship to Brimhaven -&gt; Charter to Catherby 
---
My expectation is 2, 3 and 4 man groups (possibly even 5).
---
\- Everyone having personal banks still  
---
\- One shared bank much like is seen in raids. (Although this could be programming wise rather challenging so maybe just trading between group members)  
---
\- Separate Highscore board but instead of it being for just one person it lists the group combined total of certain skills/ overall level.
---
so how does the rsclient know who's authenticator to ask for... it's tied to your rs account man, doesn't follow you around wherever you're logging in. to disable authenticator you need to have access to the authenticator code. do you know what hacking entails? you're mixing up hacking with people giving away account info in one way or another, which isn't jagex not adding an authenticator delay's fault, its theirs
---
This meme is so true lol
---
I remember when runespan came out, the community was so mad because it totally devalued all their hard earned rc exp. 
---
yes they removed it because it trivialized such a classic rite of passage.
---
Pro tip: watch a video that shows jad's attack sounds, turn sounds on ingame, default to range pray, and switch briefly to mage when you hear the mage attack, then switch back to range pray when you see the projectile appear. Rinse and repeat
---
How hyperbolic
---
To add insult to injury the first one's got kidney stones coming out of his dong.
---
It‚Äôs worth it if you don‚Äôt like rc, which I don‚Äôt, money isn‚Äôt really an issue.
---
Yeah, no.

In my gym it‚Äôs always 15-18C so it‚Äôs nice before you‚Äôre properly warmed up

I have my username auto filled in so that could be why but at no point have i ever had to put my password then be prompted for a new code.

This picture speaks to me

the username save is clientside not serverside, that's not the case bro

You use force rotation control...

Can you make it so the fish sack can store all fishing equipment and bait, also maybe a certain amount of raw fish that can only be deposited not withdrawn

Accuracy can be an issue at bandos

Everytime I think I'm getting bored of this sub you guys surprise me with the best shit. 
---
It's still the same game, but at the same time it's not really the same any more. There is tons of new content, people have figured out how to maximize efficiency, and there are guides for anything and everything that you want to do. If you, like most of us, were just a kid farting around on f2p you'll probably pass your old account's stats and bank value in less than a month of super casual playing. While the magic of exploring is largely gone, you'll be able to access almost all of the game's content fairly easily if you put in the time (lots and lots of time, holy shit) and there is an awful lot of content for just about every play style. 
---
If you were a rock star member with 99's back in the day, then there's new areas, raids, and a bunch of other cool stuff as well. Best thing in either case is to just start playing the game and doing what you find fun. Kill cows, do quests, get some levels and start your adventure. There's no objectives other than what you make for yourself, so have fun! 
---
Horror story: After I finally caved and got b2p I finished arma gwd 2 trips later. I forgot the tabs on one of the trips. It got almost no play.
---
It‚Äôs stupid that they don‚Äôt allow special characters either 
---
I have 82 Range/80 Mage and spent some time learning and grinding 20+ Kills yesterday on Zulrah.
---
Kill times will definitely be on the slower end. I'd say across my 22kc my kill times average somewhere in the 3-4min/kill. 
---
I'd had a couple sub 3min kills but most tend to be in the 3 minutes range. 
---
I don't have any Zenyte jewelry or anything too fancy. 
---
Legend has it that noob is still stuck in there.
---
Mandatory military service at the top end of your limited time career isn't exactly fair. If I had to quit my current job to go serve in the military for 2-3 year it would set me back so fucking far in life.
---
You mean to renew membership you don't buy a few bonds, redeem 2, and chuck the rest at sand casino?
---
If you want to save some money, yeah stay f2p till you‚Äôre finished with all of the f2p quests. However there is a members quest that will get you from 1 att/strength to 30 after completion.
---
Alch her.
---
Yeah. Thank god he made sure skilling was shit profit. What ever would we do?
---
These days it‚Äôs tough to be competitive in PvP without a highly specific build and a ton of practice. What‚Äôs best, I think, is to build a main account that you use to focus on PvM content, while also building a low level pure to get into PvP with lower stakes. You could turn your current account into something OK PvP wise but you‚Äôd be at a disadvantage having not gotten your defense levels from quest rewards!
---
I was at a rave last weekend, wearing my runescape world map jumper, of course, and some geezer comes up to me asking if it was a motherboard design.
---
Jokes on him, I wc at Senate meetings.
---
If you actually grind for it then I doubt you would disassemble it. Unless you are a degenerate staker
---
tbh only time I would ever duo dk's these days would be brining a low level or btw that wants to mage rex lul
---
Which people solo.
---
‚ÄúOH MY DAYS‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs almost like A Friend burned through all of his goodwill and rapport with the community...
---
There‚Äôs a difference between sniping someone to kill them for loot and sniping them to rag them, only the latter is player harassment.
---
Could have done Abyss minigame and got 1-9 and saved your arms. Rip in pieces brother
---
They might check CSRF tokens, and it sounds like they randomized elementary IDs in some cases
---
What people like you seem to not get is that this is the most textbook integrity issue rs has ever seen and it never should have been polled 
---
Whoa let's not get ahead of ourselves and call Slayer interesting. It's probably the most simplistic skill, probably the fastest one developed. It's just training combat with an NPC dialogue beforehand and a monster selection.
---
Firemaking is probably most in need of update
---
Nice pet, what's it called
---
Just got level 2 runecrafting, I‚Äôm #1 now
---
Where did you buy your gf
---
How to get scammed for your bank 101:
---
Share your bank with 2-5 other players
---
Drop item -&gt; gf
---
Withdraw item -&gt; kodai insignia
---
Same could apply to Dragon hunter cbow aswell. 2 birds with 1 stone
---
The amount of people that have access to it is completely irrelevant to power creep - what if there was an item
---
That could one shot any boss at any time - but there was only one in game. Would it not be Op because only one person has it? Of course not 
---
I served in the army 2 years mid career, when i came back my career was stronger than ever and i am a much better person for it in more ways than i could have ever imagined. Your talking purely about ¬£¬£¬£ (and what i think you mean is you would rather earn more money for a year than do it) 
---
No you cant
---
damn. i've been using runelite for a while now and didn't know about those fancy health and prayer bars
---
are they a recent addition?
---
He wrote a script that automates the login in process on a fake Runescape website that is used to phish for accounts. He is spamming them with a bunch of fake Runescape logins so that it would be harder for them to differentiate his long list of fake logins with that of someone who actually fell for their fake website. However, if he is not updating his IP constantly the owner of the fake website could check the IP address of the fake logins from his script and perform some action (delete all requests from that IP from the database for example) and nullify the effectiveness of his script.
---
If you make this in XL, I would totally buy one.  Please make these a reality.
---
Depends on your levels. Redirect scrolls on a house tab will get you to Relekka. Moonclan teleport in your PoH will get you to Lunar Isle. Some other guy's PoH in 330 can do the swap itself.
---
I have a Moonclan portal.
---
My pro tip: fill up your inventory with rune ess and get some free astrals and runecrafting XP every time you swap books! 
---
You didn't get the crude chair? Unlucky
---
You talk about people not understanding when you don‚Äôt understand the rules on account sharing yourself. You also wouldn‚Äôt care if this wasn‚Äôt RoT.
---
But pp isn't good until almost halfway to 99
---
usually ppl who make scams like these dont think about csrf tokens
---
Yeah, I'm thinking about ways to make the ruleset less restrictive but still interesting, because I already found myself getting frustrated when it takes like an hour to get a clue, and then I have to drop it because I can't go buy a steel mace or gnome boots. 
---
My proposed new ruleset:
---
1. All weapons and armor (with the exception of arrows/runes) can only come directly from clue scrolls.
---
2. All money must come from clues, either thru GP, selling the items, or alching the items. I think I'll also let myself take any drops from the clue guardians just to spice things up.
---
3. I can use the money I get from rule 2 to do whatever buy runes, arrows, and items required to complete quests/other clues.
---
4. (Not sure about this one) I restrict the skilling levels I can gain based on the number of clues I do. Easy clue = 1 level, Medium clue = 2 levels, Hard clue = 3 levels, etc...
---
That information is totally inaccurate.  Most of JeGeX's expenses come from RS3 as the game is more difficult to develop.  It has a dwindling player base with a vast majority of active players maxed or near max.  Every single RS3 player would have to spend on average 20$ a month on top of an 11$ membership per month to reach OSRS's financial gains from membership alone. 
---
The whole "RS3 makes more money then OSRS" meme came from the times when OSRS was smaller then RS3.  
---
Does it still tell you that the name is in use? Could be that a F2P charachter is named that way (those aren't listed on the highscores either) or perhaps a really low level.
---
Was this really necessary
---
eeww 
---
110mb/s upload?! That's nuts. I'm lucky if I get 1. 
---
No but it would be nice to have a more afkable option for agility, for less xp - not some completely afk shit like in rs3, but something. With rc there's zmi which is at least kind of afk
---
i doubt theres anything he could do reasonably.  cant be certain, but i dont see any reason why they wouldnt track where the login came from, as that just becomes more information they can use to retain control at such a small effort to track.  its also pretty much the golden rule, and any phisher will be acutely aware of it, that you always have to assume the ways which people will try to break your stuff, and on person putting in a bunch of junk entries is like the very first thought you will have when making form like this. i think this is just 100% a waste of time unless they are masking/changing their IP info with every entry.  they didnt include any captcha so they probly just dont care about automated entries because they can filter them so easily. 
---

Have you heard of the enigma code? British intelligence literally were decoding top secret German messages from all ranks of German military day in day out. They built the first computer for this and it would be inconceivable to the Germans to think that they were being listened to. Yet through this communication method there is also not a single mention of mass killing operations, gas chambers, crematoria supplies being shipped, anything of the sorts.
---
I find it so funny how people are so desperate and scared to actually investigate things for themselves. You'll defend something you know nothing about to the grave. Now that's brainwashing.
---
I think you made this last week
---
iloveemoboys. You're the best. 
---
I‚Äôm about 700 total skill and play overwhelmingly on mobile. All combat and magic are 40-45 right now and I‚Äôll probably finish Dragonslayer tonight to unlock full rune and I have Ava‚Äôs already. Is there a preferred place to kill for coin or am I a ways off from that being worthwhile?
---
I went and got rogue‚Äôs gear at 50/50 thieving and agility. Master farmers have been lucky for me but honestly it‚Äôs just boring so I was wondering if there‚Äôs something more worthwhile than fleshcrawlers for me right now, or if slayer becomes worth it at lower levels as mine is only 25ish.
---
Tell your mom to go back to the kitchen 
---
Everyone would still have personal banks not to mention they are still ironman, they couldn't trade or sell the items with other.
---
Besides mostly the groups would consist out of friends so I wouldn't be too worried about that happening.
---
~~cringe~~
---
Why would they be 1/5k when the item that you took inspiration from is much rarer(1/13k)?
---
okay, i didn't knew. Thought the reason why rs3 gets almost only mtx updates is because osrs doesn't get a single one.
---
Yes, you can do it with a single boost. 
---
After you.
---
I‚Äôm telling ya that‚Äôs what i had to do the other day. I remember cos my phone was dead and it pissed me off. Just clicked ‚Äòexisting user‚Äô and it wanted a auth code.
---
replying to yourself...
---
Mining isn't too bad, just do amethyst hurr durr
---
Used to be the same way but I was getting frustrated as I started to do more involved quests. Decided I'd Slayermusiq1 for Underground Pass and never looked back.
---
No bullshit, and his guides are a perfect representation for how long a quest is going to take.
---
U rite
---
Why does this community seem to be against improving things like this? A simple search features would be very useful. It also wouldn‚Äôt require a lot of resources to add.
---
Man that crackhead REALLY wanted it.
---
There are fun and interactive methods but it takes too long or have too many requirements in my opinion
---
Id upvote this but it has 73 upvotes
---
I'd say 40-60 at canifis takes about 10 hours. 
---
Exactly the info I was looking for. Thanks!
---
Just says the name is not available, it's a fairly unique name that I'm 99% sure wouldn't be in use, but it's got me guessing whether or not I have an old account with it used. I don't think I do. So annoying.
---
Someone being fucking retarded. Don‚Äôt sweat it.
---
You're probably one of those retards that would spend 30 minutes tryin to buy a rune scim instead of just offering an extra 5k üòÇ
---
Quest point cape is meta for using fairy rings because of the one outside the legends guild.
---
I expect you to understand that every your experience won't be everyone else's, I would miss 2 years or profession into the field (right now alot of people are aging out) and someone would be promoted in my place. It could easily push my retirement back 5-10 years and keep me out of the job I'd like for some undetermined amount of time. As far as dovy of he had stopped upload even for a year his following would be dead.
---
And your suggestion is? 
---
Ill try and make it short and simple. Its because there is no alternative to getting the reward from the group content. Obviously new items would be added to make the group content desireable. Due to the work involved getting said items they will be extremely expensive on the market I imagine. Potentially making BiS unnessecarily hard for solo people. Walling off gear would be unhealthy.
---
Luckyy
---
hur dur u r stoopid
---
im sorry im not gonna fight anymore, all im saying is that's impossible. if it weren't, 'hackers' could have your account data saved on their machine while offline, because thats what clientside info is, and if thats how the runescape authenticator works, you got bigger complaints. so I hope you're wrong (because I use an authenticator) which I believe you are, have a good day
---
Normally I'm not too big on mutagen stuff, but the rather muted colours of this design mean it should add a little more variety without being too intrusive. Given there's a precedent for different coloured forms being represented in serp helm, I'm all for it. 
---
Can't deny that. As someone who uses KeePass, this is super annoying üòÖ
---
But then you're not against recolours, you're just against new shit 
---
N0thinglast1 did a series on this he got 99, godsword set and all hard diaries done playing that way so it's a not to bad of an option as for me I have been able to progress quite well in couple of months I will have just 2 elite diaries left and by the end of year all should be completed. If you enjoy skilling you will be able to do that, if you are into bossing you can still do it. Finally if you limit yourself to 1 hour a day you might as well play as efficient as possible and that will do good for your brain (if you ever used a brain training app you will notice that it consisted of paying attention and doing some actions correctly over a short period of time) and you will never get that feeling oh I want to die because you done rc, agility, ect for 3+ hours
---
Your mom didn't complain this much when you were brought into this world. 
---
Pre GE was such a dope mix of self sufficiency and having an interactive economy.
---
They said the engine team have other projects that are priority that will take all year
---
Lol deal. I'll be home in a few hours. 
---
These look so good
---
The proposed KBD dhcb when? :(
---
Printscreening a Snapchat message, that‚Äôs courage
---
I'm pretty sure if it's inactive and even your own old account you can ask for them to release the name ü§î
---
Speaking from experience?
---
Why did you list 5 solo bosses if you want group play? 
---
Man that sounds almost cool but just a little too gay to wear in public
---
It's not about low balling it's about you pay a smaller price since you're the one now left with the task of selling it.
---
They willingly sell it lower for faster transactions
---
No, it's just flaccid 
---
Were you on Canafis or any courses that whole time? I ended up with 130 by the time I hit 50 so that sounds like horrid luck if you were.

What do you have against parties with 2 members?
---
Ai that sucks, do you have any source tho? I thought they had their eye's set on mobile and once that got finished they'd start looking in these kind of things.
---
I hate the GE but will acknowledge it's nice to see those fuckers gone
---
Lavas to hit 60k+ you need to be close to tick perfect every few seconds and requires 75 rc and requires lunar diplo and requires rune pouch. At 75-90 agility you click much less and besides seers which is optional, has no additional reqs. Also you dont lose money. Also for agility you can train it for 15k/h just spam clicking the same spot starting at 15 agility. 
---
It was passing at 85% when i voted no, did it end up not passing?
---
JMODS. MAKE THIS.
---
Isn't it something like 1/2 the people with 99 RC are maxed?
---
It does depend on age i suppose, but the idea of doing it young (20 or so, i did it at 22)  But yes your right it does depend on personal experience but you could never know if you don't do it.  
---
People tend to think "ohh ill lose some money and, for a year or so i wont be doing what i want" but the skills, friends, and life experience you will gain from it is immeasurable.  
---
Need a clan?
---
Bro, learn to balance your life. Games are fun and all, but after all they're just pixels. Give her your attention and maybe she'll buy you membership ;)
---
Chaotic Good.
---
The blowpipe cant be recolored because of technical difficultes with the fact you have to charge it. It has nothing to do with being a weapon. The lance isnt chargable, so it can be done.

Runescape is a hobby. If your hobby is preventing you from behaving like an adult/person (maintaining social relationships, working, eating, sleeping, etc) then cut down on your hours devoted to the hobby.
---
If you hardly are able to play and she is being controlling preventing you from having a life outside of her, YEET her out of your life and go buy gf 1000gp in ge lmao
---
Update: it's -47 with wind chill here. FML
---
Why the fuck are people posting Nazi propaganda not immeditaely permaban'd?
---
Same could be said about ironmans and before they got implemented in game. It's more fun when you have some kind of highscore system to work with and some kind of acknowledgement like for example something in front of your name.
---
Pretty much the same reasons why they implemented ironmans which is a rather success.
---
It's all dependent on gear my dude. Tbow zulrah can top 2.5-3mil/hr without rare but without it you're looking at 2mil/hr without rares.
---
Just some close'ish numbers that I've seen personally:
---
   1. Vorkath - 3mil/hr with DHCB no rares.
---
   2. Zulrah - 3mil/hr with rares. If you get unlucky it can be worse
---
There were a lot of good ones but when it came to final joke off the most votes went to:
---
‚ÄúWhere do you get a washer and dryer in runescape? Seers.‚Äù
---
The minority in this thread of comments maybe. But hes obviously not talking about that if you used your head
---
-grind runecrafting
---
-in full granite
---
- to the chaos altar (not the abyss ofc)
---
-you bring 4-5 shaks cause you get pk
---
-you d/c after every trip.
---
-recharge your prayer  at the monastery‚Äôs altar
---
It's not allowed chop wood on mobile while watching a movie? Who are you to decide that?
---
Fuck no. That entire system was so fucking stupid. 
---
No one in their right mind would ever vote for it 
---
After you've done enough farm runs, it's painful but very possible to do farm runs on mobile by thinking hard about what you need to bring. 
---
Osrs doesnt even exists for 10 years mhmmmm
---
Don't super like the look of those dragon hunter popsicles tbh
---
Unless that's your playstyle, grinding for a bond will make the game feel like a chore where you need to pay a bill before time is up. This will likely lead to a burnout. Play the game to enjoy it. If you're a member and stressing about bonds, perhaps pay $ or go to F2P until you can.
---
What part of 'I choose to have no bank' says 'I choose to lock new content from myself?

Humor H
---
Every day is cock day. 
---
Yeah that's what I meant by the blowpipe situation. I know there's no technical reason the Lance can't be recoloured, but Zulrah mutagens only allow for recolouring the armour items, and not the weapons.
---
I'm guessing the most damage comes from the electric attacks if you are afk?

You know it's cold when bars are closing in Wisconsin
---
Calm down satan.

And not even maxed
---
Stop being a little bitch. It's his life not hers
---
Bots actively destroy the games economy. That's a fact from a math standpoint. They're bringing too many items in the game illegally, which destroys the item itself and whatever said item can be used for. It's a chain of effect. 
---
How much in supplies did you go through?
---
Haha 
---
Yo is that Rick to the right?

Could you give full gear details? I heard multiple stuff about capes rings and stuff.

Because most payment processors are secured for this

They are likely going to keep it the way it is.

There's many good reasons for cosmetic options and thats a part of osrs already and always has been
---
Wait, that's illegal 
---
Yeah last chick I dated, I was farming zulrah/watching netflix and accidentally left her on read for like 30min before my phone started blowing up with "baby??" "Hello????" "Okay...." and ":/" messages. Honestly stressed me the fuck out and made me not want to talk to her anymore. I used to be very needy when it came to relationships and now I understand why my needinesss drove away some girls in the past. It's stressful and annoying having someone constantly up your ass all day, I need my peace and quiet lol
---
Nope. It's actually fairly east if you get to a wave you can't pass, log out, then just watch videos on the rest of the waves. Along with max gear. :p
---
Guies guies look I got him guies look he‚Äôs in his own fantasy guies look!!!!!!!!!!!?!!/?1!2!!
---
Please kid wake up. Go back to your shitter games and stay there 
---
yeah lemme just go play maple story when i‚Äôm like 20 levels from max 
---
Which means that the herb values are only worth what people will pay for the benefits of herb.
---
Keeping the price down is necessary in that aspect
---
Hell no, as long as they aren't charging real money for cosmetics, bring them on. I'd love to be able to change the look of best in slot gear. Everyone looks the same right now.

Thanks Zuko!

Can't give any advice, my girlfriend wouldn't be retarded enough to say something like this.

Does it work on mobile?

No. Pls no.

Brain and creativity has nothing to do with it. It's the way you perceive certain things. A lack of resemblance between two objects doesn't mean someone has "brain issues". 
---
They are classified as a dragon/Wyvern, and dragons/Wyverns don‚Äôt have superiors.
---
Because they are new creatures?
---
I'm not sure why you want everything at once. If anything this is better for Jagex. Now they didn't have to rush to quickly add these in at launch. Plus this opens up an opportunity to use those for a future update. 
---
I honestly don't know. Bots have been in the game since rs1 (classic) and while people who bot 200m ect then claim they are good at the game is a joke.. Gold farming bots I welcome with open arms. They keep material prices reasonable and gold prices cheap.
---
Without bots there are not enough people generating resources to keep up with the demand. Do you have any idea how many lobsters are used in the game in a single week? Without bots there would be way more food used then created. And prices of all materials (ore, logs, food etc.) would skyrocket to unaffordable prices. 
---
Ah good ol' quantum leap such an underrated show.

Herb running is planting herb seeds in the various herb patches around the world and harvesting them when they're full grown, then selling the herbs. There are teleports for all the patches, some are more efficient than others. There's a ton of guides out there. [Here's one that has trees and herbs](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/98v1h4/how_to_do_farm_runs_a_comprehensive_beginners/)

Laziness 
---
Ye, probably unofficial ironman. An actual ironman would have to lay their own egg for the chicken.
---
Should recolor the ring instead
---
As someone who loves woodcutting, I agree with you here.  It's not like we have 0 options, but cutting ents is lame and boring, and while I've never tried sulliscep farming (I do intend to sooner than later), even so it's just the same as normal woodcutting but paying a little more attention.
---
A woodcutting minigame would be great.  I'm pretty firmly against distractions and diversions but I used to really enjoy the WC world boss thing that would appear and everyone would have to cut it/burn it together.  It added some fun variety/randomness to an otherwise repetitive skill
---
I should have mentioned I plan on doing lots of bossing tasks (grotesque guardians, sire, vorkath, cerb, etc.) along my way as well, does that change your advised progression at all? Range is used a lot more in most bossing content.
---
Kieran said they didn‚Äôt have time to make them but that they‚Äôre interested in making superior variants at a later point in time. 
---
Yes I was on a Konar task, should have clarified.
---
‚Äúoh shit oh fuck‚Äù

Y fletch

it devalued all their effigy capes

Did he have to buy a car to reach the ocean or something?

I don't see how unless you mean a mouse recorder

Let us know what your luck texts back!

it's fun
---
First she doesn't want to come second to runescape, then it will be second to job, "second to family" ranking shit is weird. She feels neglected so find a hobby she likes and do it with her.
---
when copy/paste is the best you've got
---
you lose all the prestige. Now that Ironman has been released for years, people don't look twice to an ironman with a corp sigil shield or some raids gear. 
---
"70 farming without planting a seed is not uncommon" is the whole point, that's the reason people call it easyscape
---
Yeah it's still far to 99 but even 40 or 50 without planting a seed is stupid
---
I used to do an hour of BJing and an hour of PP just to mix it up
---
Mod wolf nerfed it because he wanted BIS helm to come from his quest, people gave him shit, he cried and scrapped the quest. Kept helm nerfed
---
But it actually just deletes the item instead of rerolling it. So you could actually get an empty clue lol
---
oh trust me   we are watching.    i hide in a ring of stone  just choke on my water when people run by naked.   then i post it on forums on a very long list of bossing noobs,  that way youll never get into a pvm clan!! muahahhahaha  
---
Experience speaking here 
---
Yeah! Send the art team to fix the cheat detection or something.
---
Gotta get that one checked out 
---
They don‚Äôt check the logins by hand my guy
---
of course. just a memory i had when I was a dumb kid.
---
Flair
---
try getting 99.
---
I get your point, and I also struggle to see how anyone falls for it, but these scammers are taking hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of work away from people. I support any effort to stop them, even though you're right that it's pretty dumb that people still fall for the "looks like the real website if I'm too retarded to check the URL" trick.
---
Tyvm boys. 
---
I remember my shitty deathcore days, but that album will always be good. Hadn't heard that opening BLAAARGHHH in years.
---
Not sure. 
---
I believe Jagex changed it recently. It used to ask if you have access to your registered email. You had to select "Yes" or " No", but now they might have removed that and send the email right away. I haven't checked lately, so I can't confirm.
---
TIL Mod Woof is a snowflake
---
It made me think of that scene from Interstellar where the ship is spinning and they had to line it up with that intense ass music playing
---
? The poll ended on the 25th and it passed with 77.4% yes
---
Everything in the last poll passed
---
Longtime player, just never noticed the extreme detail they put into this game 
---
Thanks for the reply man! Been doing barrows with the trident of the seas to eventually save up for a blowpipe. Guess I should set my sights elsewhere until I get a higher ranged level.
---
But his life is having no life bruh
---
I just checked for you OP, it comes back unknown player when I try to add them. It could be on a banned account, could be locked to another account for a short period or could be available and for some reason you can't claim it.
---
Selling twow is that a bee
---
ah, okay. id still recommend going for melee gear first as its used in main slayer + some bossing tasks. your best range upgrades are anguish and rigour, then get pegs and then armadyl
---
Your style of speaking reminds me of Kurtz preaching to the Cambodians in apocalypse now
---
It is
---
Pointless? You must love running out of energy every 40 seconds 
---
A Friend hasn't uploaded an episode in 3 weeks lol, not to mention the first one was pitiful. Settled is leagues ahead of him. 
---
How often are runners paid? Once an hour, every 15 mins, every run, etc?
---
Completely depends on how they collect data, they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily log IP as well as login info
---
Have you ever had a dream that, that, um, that you had, uh, that you had to, you could, you do, you wit, you wa, you could do so, you do you could, you want, you wanted him to do you so much you could do anything?
---
&gt;relatively small
---
wew
---
Sea Shanty 2. 
---
Yeah honestly barrows at your level with the trident is probably one of your best options. I'll go ahead and throw barrows into the data too.
---
Wow 8000 dwh drops in only 4 kills but no curved... That is lucky!
---
I dont believe that for a second 
---
Thats the boss log 
---
Voting no unless you add a shortcut from the resource area to the grand exchange.
---
This is reasonable if you lock it behind 11 agility and half of the easy diary is required to use it.
---
*pop*
---
How do you get so good goddamn
---
Nice. What kind of xp/h can you get with this?
---
Ha, I'll start after work. For some reason, my internet went down last night and is still down this morning. Used my phone as a hot spot to play last night üòÖ
---
You could probably do some mole without too much issue, but it will be slow eith those stats and without fally hards done. Gwd will be really difficult, but with a few friends doable. I'd consider getting a buddy or two and hitting up the dagannoth kings.
---
Getting to higher slayer levels will be time consuming but would open up a bunch of slayer bosses while also getting your stats up so that you can do more bosses in general.
---
Other options at your stats would be chaos fanatic and crazed archaeologist in the wild.
---
Getting 75 range and and blowpipe for fire cape is also a great idea.
---
The black guys face makes me think this is an SNL skit
---
What makes autoclicking easy is no variables. There are none in fletching. Positions remain the same every time. That's the entire idea behind an auto clicker.

This player is singlehandedly satisfying the whole playerbases red chins needs

Voting for your favourite content creator is also biased. And voting randomly may be unbiased, but it's potentially unhealthy for the game.
---
No shit? I had no idea thanks for the tip. 
---
My current goal is all 60s and agility has been the biggest pain in the ass to get to 60. I haven‚Äôt gone down to RC rabbit hole yet though. 
---
Thank you.
---
Also in adventure log in your house 
---
Yeah I get it but if you can‚Äôt control your habits in a 10+ year old outdated game then maybe consider forcing yourself not playing for awhile... or you could even try Ironman, that‚Äôs a pretty fair option 
---
Tbh I‚Äôd like the lance to get a cosmetic kit from somewhere else. It should have a secondary, more simple look.
---
Just saw this, but I've been on for the past hour switching between mobile and desktop a couple times no issues on my end at least. I'd change your password just to be safe, also check your email and spam and deleted email  for any recovery emails from jagex just to be sure no one's trying that funky business 
---
Hey, I had to kill *a lot* of frost dragons for those effigies.
---
Literally everyone in this community above a total level of 50 knows what "AFK" means within the context of this game. Either you're deliberately being obtuse because you have nothing better to do, or you're legitimately retarded.
---
It's unfair to say the meta for mid level players is DHC and TBow when one of them is 100M and the other one is 1B. 
---
They are literally luxury items and their power is justified due to how expensive they are. You can't balance things around items that cost that much
---
Everyone has access to a 3m/hr rented staking account. 
---
Yeah and while that's true that's considering the absolute best players are doing it with perfect ticks, mechanics, and everyone with scythes/tbows. (I do trios with 1 scythe in TOB myself cuz my friends and I aren't ubber rich).
---
 I was trying to give a common man's estimate. Thanks for info!
---
again I really think youre overestimating how many people are doing ZMI runners. 99.99% of PvM players arent spending 20m for 150k RC xp, its mostly skillers who care about EHP. If youre a PvM player you arent going to value 150k xp in a skill you dont care about over 20m in the bank.
---
ah I should've put enchant instead of imbue, you're right
---
Quick tip quickie: If you're using RuneLite you can use the GPU plugin, set the draw distance to 90 then click all the way to the altar from the bank.
---
Social media bad reddit good
---
[deleted]
---
That was an unprescendented precedent 
---
It‚Äôs been suggested many many many times, but they‚Äôve always said they won‚Äôt add bonuses to skillcape hoods.
---
Thieving won‚Äôt count as rogues, agility won‚Äôt count as graceful, slayer won‚Äôt count as slayer helm, runecrafting wont count as a noose.
---
Yeah and then people actually playing would get those items since it‚Äôs worth their while and they can make money in a bigger variety of ways.
---
I enjoy cooking the least out of Agility, Runecrafting and Cooking. 
---
Yeah you can. Get good and save up the gp to earn it like everyone else
---
Dressed to ensure the coins are dropped...?????!!!?!!!!
---
I haven't played runescape in years now, but when I see this meme format I up vote.
---
I'm glad you mentioned staves. I knew I was forgetting something.
---
How to know which one is the correct one? Spells usually require two types of elemental runes.
---
Like in my case the strongest is Water Bolt, and it needs Water(2) and Air(2) runes. Wouldn't it be better to use an Air staff and craft Water runes (since they yield more xp)?
---
Yea it was Annihilation teamspeak
---
Lol this just reminded me of when I first started playin RS back in like 07-08 and my dad would always read it as ‚Äúrun escape‚Äù when I showed it to him. Good times
---
Dungeoneering was fucking great you tool, the rewards were the problematic part.
---
Next time she might want you to have a baguette
---
Go for it buddy.
---
ZMI is actually pretty good for chilling too. Abyss was hard work, but I did a bunch of ZMI while watching movies this weekend. I lose some xp/hr because I bank a bit slower, but it makes it pretty painless on the road to 77.
---
I‚Äôve done barrows and giant me a couple times ez kills, thanks for advice seems like I‚Äôll be grinding M√™l√©e for a bit 
---
For the first few months of me playing, I could only play at a friend's house, because I was too young to use the computer all the time at home. I didn't understand what the Attack and Strength skills were actually for or how to switch to train them. I got to like 42 Attack before learning how to train Strength. 
---
Sure. PM me your rsn!
---
I am far from convinced that the majority is always right. Or even just mostly.
---
perhaps they could make an npc and questline where prince ali's twin brother, prince 'B'li, inherits the duel arena and you say something rude to him and you get banned for 365 days at a time
---
[TIL -51c is -60f, also, get on my level.](https://imgur.com/a/PMAr8xj)
---
Drop the game for her if you care about her or you'll regret it for years.  
---
Haha I should have, but I know I would remember it more if I had it in my phone, and newer phones via snapchat saving it. 
---
They're deviant spectres
---
Thank god you are not in charge of balancing.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Glad to see someone is around still 
---
No they don't trust me I lost someone to this 5 years ago I should have toned it down.  
---
There is nothing for them to fix apart from removing staking altogether. 
---
It's not Jagex's prerogative to curb your addiction, there are specific mental health services and facilities available for that purpose. Get help if you have a problem. 
---
wtf? lol i don‚Äôt like RS3 either but some people just genuinely enjoy the game. 
---
Still looks like a better skill than Warding.
---
i really don‚Äôt know why you keep pulling these assumptions out of my comment
---
all i said was, and I quote
---
&gt;people
---
i didn‚Äôt say many people, i didn‚Äôt say tons of people, i just said people
---
that being said, the only people i know of, which i agree is anecdotal, have been pvmers doing it to get 77 rc bc they cba doing it regularly. These are ‚Äúelite‚Äù people with like 4b banks who typically don‚Äôt spend a lot of time skilling bc they‚Äôd rather pvm
---
the people i know who do like to skill, would never do this because they value that money more
---
think of it like this: people who spend a lot of time pvming have a ton of money. If you spend a lot of time skilling, that‚Äôs time that you‚Äôre taking away from pvming/money making bc skills make jack shit 
---
This is deep bro 
---
Interesting, never thought of that to be honest but I agree. It would be a bettrr metric indeed ü§î
---
Parfum
---
I would rather see a new rarer drop similar to zulrah's mutagens personally.
---
nothin gayer than feelings, bro
---
Yes it's an addiction to a currency in an online game. No one is forcing you to play or to stake, you choose to. There are resources available to get help with a gambling addiction or even a staking addiction specifically. Help yourself, stop asking for them to make it harder for you to continue your addiction. Unless they remove it entirely or make it a 1 time choice to permanently disable staking on our account, you know damn well you would find a way back eventually.
---
Was that audio recording real or a hoax? You ignored attempts to help find the source and didn't specify if the police were involved and making you be quiet about it.
---
im 72 chests 1 item right now so this really is rubbing salt in the wound :( 
---
lvl 126 highway men who tb and ice barrage.

Yea personally I wanted something a little simpler in appearance, like the Grand Lance from DS2. Oh well we can hope for an ornament kit.
---
I actually agree though that the armor looks bad

I guess what he is saying is that the only updates they get is *"The same thing but with this NPC instead or in this other location"*
---
why is this a post
---
Not it you rent it and lock it out.
---
Something something.... fire runes.... something something.... alch....
---
wait you cant boost the slayer chain?
---
or we dont want skull tricking to be removed from the game
---
Plateskirts don't look as good, or even close to as good as platelegs. 
---
There would be a 7 day grace period before it becomes locked from DA, just like a bank pin. Would be very easy to remove by the owner. 
---
Because there's the people that forget to bank shit, bring all their teles or runes, or even their cash. Happens often enough that it's worth trying everyone you see. 
---
Thank you very much. I am getting close to 75 rc and I'm considering trying it out
---
Surely its retarded to suggest an AFK meathod when you're not actually AFK?! 
---
I've been told many times myself that I am actually retarded, but have never been diagnosed so I believe you are all lying to me!
---
There's a few WoW players who earn such ludicrous amounts of in-game gold, then spend all of it on WoW's equivalent of a bond "A WoW Token"; the result is an artificially inflated price of WoW tokens that benefits nobody.
---
But I suppose it's their gold and efforts to do with as they please.
---
Though I watched one of them cash in their wow tokens and spend the Battle.net currency on overwatch lootboxes so...
---
yerch...

What was it....I missed it

Ah man, too bad. Right when double xp weekend was gonna start. All jokes aside, change every password you've got linked to the account, reset router might work.
---
Thanks for making his point for him lol. And then bragging about your wealth further down. This is why no one likes the PK community
---
So the most important thing isn't as good. Great review.
---
I own basically every VR headset out there, and with 3 sensors, I place the rift way above the Vive. The controllers aren't garbage and it feels like 1/4 the weight.
---
Neither. Unless you're super high defence or using freezes you should be praying 
---
Cut down. It's a simple answer, assuming you care for this person. If your goal in life is just to play video games uninterupted it would be selfish to hold someone else down to that standard if they dont qant to  
---
The only time I got salty as a pvmer in Wildy was when I was 1 iteming greater demons at anacarl and the same people kept killing me as I spawned in
---
the most real answer here
---
If that were the case it wouldn't help OP at all so not what he was suggesting.
---
Also, I was just making a joke because it would be hilarious if rented stakers got locked out and couldn't make any money.
---
This and the poll results thing
---
Just shut up
---
Yeah that's exactly what I mean! The stats on most monsters do matter for mid level players unless you have these end game weapons. 
---
77 is very easy with zmi/lavas people just love to complain
---
why is it when every new item comes out people want to reskin it multiple colors. This would of been downvoted back in 2013 - 2015 what changed lol? everyone is fucking color mad must be high all the fking time
---
yeah but runecrafting ;)
---
If you are unhappy with xp rates please try rs3, its 250k/hr there.
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm here with lvl 90 RC 5.3 mil exp
---
The drop rate per roll is just over 1/13k, however, since you get 2 rolls per kill its halved, and then halved once again if you look at both mutagens per kill. 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Zulrah
---
Haha that sucks dude. I‚Äôm in buffalo so it‚Äôs not a ton better but I can walk outside without freezing in 2 minutes.
---
I use kronos, skipping a growth cycle is op for trees
---
I hate how rare mutagens are, as long as its not ridiculous droprate like zulrah
---
Suddenly, it generates someones legitimate username, password, and pin by some crazy miracle and a poor soul is hacked because we made a script to bug scammers instead of reporting them and getting sites taken down. 
---
Try to limit yourself playing the game. I have worked with a woman who divorced her husband because he kept playing video games and she felt lonely and neglected. Made me realize that I had to spend more time with my girlfriend and less time playing games.
---
However, this doesn't mean that you should quit. Try to balance it out and play osrs when she feels like watching series that you might not enjoy.
---
If you think 71k/hr is shit experience then I have no idea what method you‚Äôre doing
---
Okay, I'm in the process of doing that right now. Thanks for letting me know about these options!
---
A friend still makes videos lol?
---
Bis farming gloves?
---
If you're more interested in XP; Kronos seeds are your best bet as they'll speed up growth times with everything, so you'll be able to do more fruit tree, Redwood, Tree, Spirit tree, hardwood tree patches etc which I use the most.
---
Attas seeds are for profit; I made a spreadsheet of the 3.5 days it was alive doing only herb runs which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16pFiG_wJfnHw1iuWibPcwjPORPrgM46xuu5RB4EkgA8/edit#gid=0) Personally, it's very difficult to optimise this seed because you're consistently doing farm runs (depending on how many patches you do) so there's little to no time to do anything else; when you can make more with PVM
---
However, If you want to be a bit more passive with your runs; Iasor seeds as the last alternative are pretty handy as they reduce the chances of disease which are better if you plan to do herb runs semi-consistently.
---
No.
---
congrats mate, are you now going to go pet hunting?
---
Id avoid that whiney ass
---
&gt; What would be end ranging level be? I hope its close to 95 or so.
---
97-98 I'd guess. 
---
&gt; How many ranging pots, ppots would I consume for the 29000 chins?
---
You don't use PPots, they drop them and you pick them up. You might need like 10 or so to start your trips. 
---
Ranging potions are dirt cheap. Buy like 50 to start and get more if you need them, or sell them if you have extra. 
---
&gt; Also, should i use fury or salve amulet(ei)?
---
Salve amulet doesn't work on maniacal monkeys. 
---
A necklace of anguish would be best if you can get it, and you really should, because it makes a big difference and you can always sell it back. 
---
If not then a fury is fine. 
---
oh boy

you can be third

Background: the elves true power comes from their mastery of brewing. the entire elven culture is literally centered around the brewery and watermill.

You also have to pay absurd amounts of real money to get a near perfect piece of equipment. Literally gambling
---
Are you maxed/in maxed gear?
---
Both the thieving and agility requirements are in a maze with strong monsters that deal a lot of damage, and failing the obstacles deals you more damage. If you have good HP and defense levels (75+ of each) and are following a guide, then low thieving or agility won't matter nearly as much.
---
75k an hour is low?
---
And now they‚Äôre an Ironman. Coincidence reddit!?!? üòè 
---
Thank you very much 
---
I'd say more 92-94.
---
If you have Rigour; use that and what u/threw_it_up said with Anguish, you want to be adding as much damage as possible since it's the most expensive method. 
---
Right click ‚Äî&gt; Make X

Based off his previous posts, no this is not a troll.

You‚Äôre like 14 who gives a shit what she thinks 
---
You can only hold 1 of each piece. They always drop bottom, middle, top. As soon as you get the top you should go make the totem in bank it. Otherwise the very next kill could be another piece that you‚Äôll miss out on. 
---
Tbf, Settled did plenty of research before starting the account, and was clear about exceptions being made during the life of the account.
---
A Friend on the other hand just logged in on a fresh account and started recording, putting literally no effort into the idea what so ever.
---
I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs any different regardless. Just because a majority vote something doesn‚Äôt make it right either. It‚Äôs more about not voting for the losing thing that you may actually think is right because of the fact it is losing. With many people doing that, that could possibly change the outcome of the poll. Blindly voting for the winning thing because it‚Äôs winning creates bias.

Maybe take out brewery since the dwarfs have that one kind of monopolized. But I like this, a lot.
---
I had an account long ago Ive quitted and gave it away, Came back around 2018 couldnt find the friend I gave the account to he was also not listed in highscores so i did account recovery gave them account creation and all other details and Ive recovered it but it was banned so I cannot play on it now, Ive made a new account playing that now
---
It is relatively slow and high effort
---
Will cave horror be added to konar's task list?
---
Black mask is only 7/6 for melee, not 17.5%
---
Not, definitely at least 98.
---
At 83 with eagle eye reds are about 350 xp each. 
---
29000 * 350 = 10.1M xp. 
---
+ 2.6M that he already has puts him really close to 99, and that's a conservative estimate. 
---
Around 3-6 is semi-consistently to me. Would more or less say that after every slayer task or so if you do slayer regularly.
---
Looks dreadful for starters, the lance already looks pretty meh. Having a melee weapon that's the three colours of the combat triangle is uninventive and makes next to no sense plus its merely a copy and pasted version of something that already exists for another item. On top of that this has RS3 written all over it.

Is the cycle skip global on all trees at once, or does it affect only 1 tree at the time. Like could a tree skip 0 cycles when other trees could skip 1-2? If you understand what i mean
---
That‚Äôs cuz mod wolf is a pussy
---
Nah just gotta learn to type one handed on your phone. 
---
Have some self discipline.. 
---
Grossly underestimating RC training on RS3, more like 290k xp/h through the abyss on there.
---
Must. Be. Nice. 
---
Huh, TIL.
---
big yes but only if they are decently rare. 1/3000 each. So you should expect one in 1000 kills avg
---
Good luck ever having any sort of meaningful relationship if you drop them the first time you ever have to compromise even a little bit lol

I thought it was against the subreddit rules to post name, didn‚Äôt want to risk it

BIS f2p pure robes and I can obby maul in f2p again. Support.

It would be slow, but it can be done. Also, ditch the rune cbow and use Magic Shortbow with amethyst arrows.

First off, would never pass a poll. Second, ice spells already have freeze durations that they would use. No need to make them longer.

Already have one, ty tho :(

The wildy altar effectively halves the price compared to the gilded altar. Reanimating is comparable in gp/xp, but the gp/hr of the wildy far surpasses reanimation 
---
I haven't done it so I'm not 100% sure but I think you have to visit the store on the mobile app and start membership through that and you'll start the membership with the free week and then be charged after it
---
Content should never be designed/balanced around pures, no support
---
He never said anything about wilderness bud
---
Just tested both out on Gargoyles (which have decent defense) on task and I was able to get 75k ranged xp/hr with rune knives + Armadyl book and only about 70k with MSB (i). I wasn't even using rigour, but the prayer bonus from the book + blessing combo with knives might make using rigour even better. Since its only slightly more expensive, I'm leaning towards it being a universally better option

It's a broad rule and J-mods have specifically mentioned when it will and won't be applied. 
---
I'm not even going to bother with your shitty example lmfao, imagine being autistic enough to compare using an account on a game to a real life stolen ID.  I hope rot stays in those worlds and keeps killing kids like you so you can keep crying on reddit.
---
Content should be designed/balanced around Ironmen though right?

---
Making money on a private server is not the same as real osrs
---
Hmm, seems I was wrong. The rumours that it got "fixed" appeared around middle 2016, and at the time the mods did not want to give a comment on the process of determining clue rolls. (Mostly because, at the time being, clue drop rates and all weren't as transparent as they were now, I guess)

Then again, in the middle of 2018 (August), it was confirmed by Ash that it *is* indeed better to open caskets on Entrana when you are specficallh hunting for pages.

&gt; @JagexAsh Hi Ash, I know you probably get asked alot but just to clarify; would it be better to open caskets on Entrana if you're solely aiming for God Pages? Or would it not matter? I'm after the Armadyl Godbook for chinning. Thanks!
---
Then it shouldnt have the GE icon, just a regular bank icon will do
---
Frail

That moment when almost all of their membership revenue is from osrs but they dump loads of money into rs3. a game that is dying more and more everyday.

The second they do that is the second OSRS is dead. That's literally MTX which is the reason why OSRS is even a thing in the first place.

Plus I‚Äôm pretty sure ankous are at 30 wilderness so you don‚Äôt lose your void if you fight them there.
---
Exactly! I'll be getting 77 rc within the next 2 weeks or so, so the change wont really help me out as I'll be able to afk bloods, but it'd be nice if the newer playerbase could get this skill trained up outside of 30k xp/hr methods lol
---
Not as bad as before when you could leave after killing it but before it registered as a death :(

2 raids is pretty much nothing compared to other mmos.

The only other "group content" that is relevant would be BA and Pest Control.

Everything else is either solo or completely ignored by the majority of people due to lack of rewards like trouble brewing or castle wars.

You should do some NMZ for redirection scrolls so you can make tabs to taverly and brimhaven.

B0aty sub confirmed.

Lmfao I'd love to see you try, since I don't think we even live in the same country maybe we could meet up in-game and you could try on there? :) RSN: Fabled Melon I'll be waiting for your pm

It's low risk in the sense that if you're going to be an Ironman you may as well start off hardcore.  When you die you just become a regular Ironman, but having that hardcore vs regular is a status symbol.

He‚Äôs not wrong

Big sad

---
geography can be kinda fun. Think of it like the RS map, but like its earth instead
---
Okay, I get this argument to an extent, but this seems kind of ridiculous in this situation lmao. Should content be designed around pures? No. But there is a huge pure community out there, why purposefully lock content from them if there is no negative outcome for regular accounts?
---
Usually this argument is just used by people who don't like pures for some odd reason.

I live in Asia and on the best of days lowest number I see is 150.

His content has really sucked ass lately though. Lucky to get a video once a week and when we do it's just filler garbage. Used to love seeing him pop up in my sub box every couple days and would watch it immediately. Now it's getting to the point where I'll probably unsub.

New member of a fraternity. Traditionally hazed, and as frats have been faced with bad publicity and a decline in new members, they have had to make their hazing more and more PC.

So instead of butt chugging a PBR while singing ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little teacup‚Äù, they now supposedly make them grind RC on 4 accounts on RS mobile. 
---
Not sure which is worse.

You do understand that the whole point of a relationship is to unite two as one and live life together, right?

It is specifically for at mole, not the rest of the game, but I gt what you mean.

Praise be to Guthix
---
I haven't even messed with NMZ yet, but it's on the list.  Redirection scrolls sound super freakin useful though!
---
Both features can be somewhat buggy, I don't think OSRS players would enjoy the bugs with them, but in 3rd party client its sort of "fine" as its all opt-in and customizable.
---
Support

Yes because its an officially supported game mode

You can? Hmmmm that sure would have been nice to know before i did it lol.

Why confront Vet'ion though if you can lure and safespot it

this is a good suggestion
---
I have an idea for mobile pkers
---
So as it stands we stand little to no chance to spec someone like pc players can as in the g maul to godsword spec 
---
So my idea is to make the spec icon u have already set up as a spec button then we can at least keep up with our specs 
---
I no this thread will get enough hate because it's changing the game to better support mobile so pc players won't like it but the only other alternative I can think of is just to make a mobile pking world just like how they already have a bit world for bot busting

He started uploading less consistently because he got burnt out from releasing scheduled videos and literally all of his accounts were banned from the game. I never said tons of people don't do it for the money. I said that when they go from doing it for fun to doing it for money the quality of their content generally gets worse because they aren't enjoying what they are doing anymore.
---
Tweening just looks odd to me. GPU mode is great but of course won't have 100% compatibility and will have bugs that CPU mode wouldn't.
---
It just depends on your accuracy vs your opponents. There will be a tipping point where MSB becomes the better option, but where that is is situational. 
---
Just use a DPS calculator if you want to know for sure.

you can by pass the notification by using some special samsung pen thing, or asking the google assistant to take a screen shot

Do people wonder that..?  I know I don't, and I've quite literally never spent a dime on a cosmetic thing in a game.  Paying money for such things is nonsense to me, and yet I have no problem understanding why they're so popular.

Do "farming contracts" in the new guild, and birdhouse runs on Fossil Island.

Also non-ultimates can use Kingdom of Miscellania to get 8-9 seed nests per day!

The same people who complain about rc probably got thousands of boss KC along with their hundreds of hours doing PvM..
---
Pretty sure it was polled once ages ago and didn't pass so that's why the requirement wasn't removed.
---
erm this is relevant to what i wrote how?
---
Because ferocious gloves are visible to other players

That just sounds awful

This helps pures so would obviously never happen.

It's a quest in RS3

I saw a dude with a pornhub hat and an Efukt shirt at the bar one time. Dude was pulling tail too, not some creepy dude with porn merch.
---
cant even pass the pill to a btw smh jagex
---
Yup, you are correct. It was polled and failed. They are going to re-poll it (mentioned on stream)
---
Well, that's interesting.
---
this is the truth that has led to many surprises right here, welcome ones most of the time, but surprises. 
---
 I know right. I had the same feeling. 
---
 Doesn't 100% work, but in Canifis for example, I would find a mark of Grace, end the current lap, start a new one, stop on the last building (the one with bigredjapan) and wait around 3-4 min.
---
 I felt like at least 80% of the time i would start a new lap and there would be a mark of grace. 
---
 I strongly believe the marks have a "cooldown".
---
I still gotta get one too for this color, just cba getting the points.. 
---
You must have never dealt with an emotional and mentally abusive girlfriend before, have you?
---
okay thank you, thats the answer I was looking for, upvoted
---
Is it better in the long run to be getting 80-85% to avoid bolt racks or 100% for a better chance at a unique if I‚Äôm looking at Barrows as a money maker? No mory hard btw.
---
they can expand brewery here tho..
---
Frozen ground under it? are you joking? just look at those claws lmao  
---
Still gonna upvote though, maybe it can pass with some tweaks
---
Except they specifically said they'd never design content just for ironmen. 
---
There is nothing wrong with rune crafting. Not every skill is supposed to take 24 hours like cooking
---
Fair point. Fair point.
---
dont tell me i messed up &lt;\_&lt; i didnt listen to the end lol

Why would you want this?
---
I approve.
---
Wow.  Now I've seen it all.
---
what do you mean?
---
If you suicide at wildy altar you cap at about 300k exp per hour.  You also have to be on high alert for PKers.  Regular gilded can reach 500k exp with no risk.
---
I personally use wildy altar but it's definitely not for everyone.  The money you save is irrelevant if you can make a solid 2.5m per hour or more with other methods.

60 Prayer for +1 pray bonus is kind of ridiculous lol. I mean even blessings have 0 requirement. If anything, 50 would make more sense

Most of the time I use Zowie FK1, but it's more of an FPS mouse. When I play RuneScape I use deathadder, don't have any MMO mice.

It's just a game, dude. She politely let you know how she feels and didn't demand that you stop playing. She feels like a second. Make her a first and make the game a second.

Many people would get angry and demand that you give them more attention. Just from her being polite tells me that it's something that genuinely concerns her, but that she still wants you to keep your hobby. 
---
Water that seed, man. 
---
Yep. Fucking hate vork, have done like 400 kc compared to like 3500 zulrah 
---
I dislike how there are like 3 instakill mechanics at vork that just fuck you for not paying attention. Thats all you have to do at vork. With zulrah its positioning and switching.
---
Yeah I feel you on that vorkath is so simple it's gets boring
---
Reddit sucks too. At least I can get a good laugh on here though 
---
Does the lore explain anything about why our character cannot permanently die? 
---
I'm normally against making things easier for limited accounts in general but the difference is just 1 prayer bonus, which is really insignificant,  so I'm not entirely opposed to it, as long as it's just the chaps only and any other set of d'hide has no def requirement on the chaps so it does make some sense in that regard. Would be decent for people who do a lot of hard clues with the price increase as well I suppose.
---
I mean i have them blocked. But If I didn't it would be an easy skip is what I was trying to say. 
---
So you admit you're a piece of shit then . Atleast we agree on something 
---
I got a rune defender tattooed on my forearm, if anyone asks it‚Äôs a dagger. From where? It‚Äôs personal.

I got one at like 6 kc.

it dipped to -38 actual temp last night in the us midwest. i rounded up to sound cool

I don't know you, but if you put JFAC in your videos, I'm a fan.

When I got 99 Strength and 70 Attack I went to Edgeville. I started using accurate (no xpwaste) and now I‚Äôm 99 Attack. 
---
Literally 13m exp from PKing in a couple of years time. 
---
Literally better designed than warding.  
---
I don‚Äôt get why people say no to this. It doesn‚Äôt change existing meta, nothing is broken by allowing 1 def accounts use it, mains get more money from doing clue scrolls, it‚Äôs basically a chap recolor with +1 prayer which really doesn‚Äôt matter. Haters just love to hate. 
---

---
I know MTX is a pariah, especially round these parts, but I personally wouldn't mind much if minor, tasteful cosmetic stuff like this was sold for money.  Now before I get downvoted to absolute shit (which I will anyway), there are some major caveats with this:
---
- It must always be cosmetic only.  If gameplay impact is even microscopically nonzero, it's unacceptable.  
---
- It can't get stupidly out of line.  Nobody wants to see people flying around shitting rainbows or any other kind of disruptive, annoying shit.  It has to be low key.  
---
- It's much better if it's added because they actually need the money, or at least will use it to re-invest in the game and make it better.  Even if they do everything else right, if it's done just to boost 3rd quarter earnings or some shit, that's undoubtedly the beginning of the end.  
---
As far as I'm concerned, if those things are strictly adhered to, I really don't care if they add that kind of MTX.  Now obviously the problem is that it appears to be basically impossible to keep this shit under control.  MTX seems to always be a slippery slope for game developers, where it just gets worse and worse and more destructive over time.  But IF someone was capable of religiously sticking to these guidelines, I don't see a problem with it.
---
God you're a dumb child they ask a limited ammount of people feedback on warding and this is the dumb shit you want to send it?
---
LOL!!!!!!! ANY SKILL THAT PROVIDES LESS THAN 125K XP/HOUR AFK AT LVL50 IS STOOPID AND I AM SMART!!!!!!

---
Yup, I'm just sad about the mindset, I'm not even a pure myself. It's just sad to see...
---
&gt;the only other alternative I can think of is just to make a mobile pking world
---
I mean the other alternative- I would argue the correct one- is that mobile pkers are simply at a disadvantage. That's ok. Mobile is a different control scheme that has some advantages and some disadvantages. Trying to make mobile and desktop perfectly equally powered in every way is misguided. 
---
He‚Äôs showing that it matches the colors, not that you would use them to recolor the pet
---
I did it at 43 no flicks..
---
Not with that slogan
---
Can I have a chance to catch up with content on zeah before we keep adding shit
---
I also dont think it should be designed around ironmen, I shouldve said ‚Äúspecial account builds‚Äù instead of pures as one group.
---
And yes it has impact on regular accounts, pures are already OP enough against regular accounts in PvP, more so in the 60-80 bracket, we shouldnt be making them more OP
---
Yea I know +1 prayer bonus will affect fuck all, but its the premise of allowing updates that cater to pures, as time goes on we could get some stupidly strong buffs that hurt mains even more
---
Yell yeah

You start it and then cancel it for the free week, it all goes through the playstore.

I‚Äôd argue non-cosmetic MTX, such as bonus experience, the EOC, and too many ‚Äúeasyscape‚Äù updates are the main reasons for OSRS. OSRS would keep on living if they ever added cosmetics such as recolors.

You can get it the first minute of members if you have 75 defense... And of you trained to 75 def in ftp and somehow can afford 4+m you should have access to the bis melee helm. It's a t75. The nezzy helm needs 55 def and a few simple quests. It doesn't even make sense. 
---
Zulrah has breaks in the rhythm. Points in time where you can just relax and not focus. 
---
Vorkath doesn't. There's always the threat of the instakill mechanic. 
---
Yup, right click the spell. Can also configure the high alch value warning limit
---
The 'We do x now, later we'll have x\^2' mindset is retarded. We got rapier! Next we'll get EOC!

It supplements the income of herbs. I get something like 45k a run from the allotments and that's if I don't take the time to convert my allotments into their finished product. Becomes 100k in that case.

I only make money from legit AFK sources and it covers my Runescape membership thru bonds and then some. I'm currently working on Managing Miscellania for income. I recently switched to paying for my membership thru Google Rewards though.

Weird pet flex but ok.

turn your own bones to bananas
---
I don‚Äôt see your point? The viewership is much much much lower. The players also sell far less jerseys and other merchandise. It‚Äôs extremely simple supply and demand economics. I‚Äôm not sure if you were attempting to debate or not but I‚Äôd really suggest not doing so lol
---
lmao
---
They either 1) suck at pking 2) have never pked or 3) are rs3 players.

But all the Runescape money! You can get like 10 osrs gfs

If only you could easily, cheaply boost RC a whole 5 levels...

This shit was so fucking funny when it went down. Jmods responses were total blackout and the only thing they did was go around and mute players because they knew how bad they fucked up.

Lmfao, calling me "reddit detective" because I checked which comment you actually replied to, forgive me for not checking every other comment just in case I wasn't supposed to take you literally. Yeah, I'm in such a rush I wait half an hour to start replying, very logical of you to make that connection lol.
---
I never said grinding is the only point of the game, or the only reason to enjoy it, but if someone wants to skip the grind to just go bossfighting and get some mad drops or go pking, I'm gonna assume they're chasing instant gratification. If you think two comments on a single subject makes someone obsessed about something that's a bit hasty.
---
Yes, I agreed with some of what you said, you made more than one point, and I disagreed with some of it, and agreed with some of it, is that so very difficult to understand? Btw calling someone "kid" doesn't put you on the high ground of an argument, especially since the only people I've heard actually talk to someone like that irl have been well under 21.
---
No, I agree they're both completely different, but that doesn't make one healthier than the other. Just look at our current egotistical, social media obsessed, no attention span having society, you gonna keep acting like the shut ins are the bad ones, at least they don't spread their poisonous behaviour around constantly.
---
I wouldn't do 4 runners unless the runners and yourself are really good.
---
But yeah, it was totally worth it for me to grind out 100m over 20-30 hours doing stuff I somewhat enjoy and then spending on RC, which I just can't stand.

Ran a few DPS calcs on Gargoyles comparing the two, and knives seem to come out on top by a clear margin. Considering most common Slayer tasks have less ranged defence than Gargs, I think it's a pretty safe assumption.
---
Also did my own cost analysis and found that knives come out to about 2 gp/xp msb (i) is about 1 gp/xp, so a 10% DPS increase for twice the cost
---
Literally got like 70 agility from barb fishing. Haven‚Äôt even skilled agility before.
---
Can we stop wasting dev time on high level content? Thanks.
---
Sounds like they're looking for feedback before the actual poll so they can make changes before it's actually polled.
---
This is why I can‚Äôt explain why people say Agility is worse than RC? They literally buffed it and added more incentive to make it easier and more enjoyable. 
---
Those kids would never survive back in 07. 
---
Dunno why you're being down voted lmao. Community hates something you make, no need to throw a baby tantrum and scrap something else you're working on. What did he expect the playerbase to say? "oh were really sorry pwease don't give up you're really good and we like you so much". Seems like exactly what a snowflake would do. 
---
No. They're getting feedback on the idea from the players so they can shape the proposed skill into something the players will be happy with. It'll be polled like any other piece of content.
---
The fact that I have to resort to swearing? I'm swearing because I'm talking to an imbecile who's screaming about how we're psychopath's and has no understanding of the words they're using.
---
If someone stops paying for our protection they are no longer a part of our group. Which means we are free to pk them as we wish, which is not a crime. You're not paying to 'pvm our revs'. You're paying for us to not attack you as well as fight anything that comes our way. We have hundreds of people in our discord conversing and making friends every day. We're not psychopaths. You just told me you don't know what racketeering is because you're not a criminal. You don't need to be something to understand the meaning of the word? as well if you didn't know what it meant and accused us of it you're discrediting yourself completely. Secondly, you've 'heard stories' about us betraying people after they've paid us? you just stated that as a rumor. That's a myth and not credible evidence at all. 
---
1: We are not involved in ddosing. Where's your proof that anyone in the 2k cc is?
---
2: We have NEVER posted the personal information of anyone or any person in the 2k cc. Where's your proof we have?
---
3: We have never stolen login information or bribed our "employees" to turn a blind eye. I will ask again, where your proof is?
---
If you've actually reported us to the police you're either insane or just stupid beyond belief. When the cop comes to your door make sure you tell him this is all about a fantasy game and that your claims are based on rumors, failed understanding of the accusations and words you're using, and that you have zero evidence to the claims you're making.

Fucking retard.

they poll the most petty waste of time stuff, they are going to poll warding 100%.

they want to get feedback so there's an actual chance of passing.

Woah woah dude calm down. you're scaring me
---
 I'm afraid you're gonna hit twice as hard on me.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing. Round one = me, round two = her, round three = both
---
Good luck in life mate, I think you'll need it.
---
How do you keep track of when your trees skip a cycle?
---
I'd be fine with removing the negative range and mage bonus on the serp, and giving it 3 mage defense.
---
Following my proposed change:
---
Neitznot pros
---
* No maintenance cost
---
* +3 prayer bonus
---
Serp pros
---
* +21-26 melee defence
---
* +20 range defence
---
* Immune to poison
---
* Sometimes inflict venom
---
At least for me, it would be the thing to use at zulrah and raids. Right now, I can't take the -5 accuracy relative to neitznot at raids, and the -8 compared to slayer helm (i) at zulrah.
---
Reminds me of how the bomb bag in Ocarina of Time is made out of a Dodongo's stomach
---
No, it more of an agreement. 
---
yeah i've been doing the quests. Currently a bit nervous about taking on Kamil in Desert Treasure as I have to kill 2 more frost trolls first and the area that Kamil is in is very dangerous and I know that if I die I won't be getting any of my stuff back

This game is slowly becoming the bottom panel.
---
maybe unproductive for you
---
With luck from you, how can I go wrong?
---
The only thing that affects the unique drop is how many of the brothers you kill. The percentage is the secondary rewards, so yeah avoid getting above ~87% so you don't get bolt racks. They're on average worth less than what you'd get otherwise
---
Lmfao jk bruh y u so tilted lmao X'D
---
This actually sounds terrifying
---
No one cares about the lore. If it doesn't really make difference why bother
---
Can a f2p bounty hunter world be added? If emblems farmers would be an issue, just add a new emblem to f2p that‚Äôs only worth 20-50k. Maybe you could make it so you can only have one at a time, sorta like a clue scroll. Upgrading tiers doesn‚Äôt have to be a thing in f2p or anything. It would just be nice to see f2p players getting some more content. 
---
They aren't sitting there the accounts are.
---
They are playing on their own accounts ready to login on another client when someone comes to contest. RoT pays them with the "protection" funds and provides login details for 2.2k and 2k accounts. 
---
Killing someone with 0 risk obviously doing slayer or a clue is you being a cunt. The wilderness is meant for PvP, that's not PvP.

---
It‚Äôs kind of viewed as a blessing from the Gods. Right before you die you are picked up and healed and brought to safety. At least that‚Äôs what the White Knights think - when you change your spawn to Fallador they call it Saradomin‚Äôs Gaze and that Saradomin protects all the White Knights.
---
The Allah guy definitely wasn't serious, but if you were around this sub at the time you'd have seen quite a few people who were very serious about how much this silly little event bothered them.

Do some bossing or even barrows. Make a competition out of barrows. see who can get more loot in a time frame

Yeah and on the back it would make sense because that's where the logo is with the capes

mod ash has stated on dev streams multiple times that the quest is in production and the plan is to release before song of the elves, also the bis helm helm of exiles is coming with it
---
I don't know what you're carrying on you, I killed some level 75 doing green dragons last night and got his fury. People forget to bank shit all the time
---
I guess I simplified my thought about why companies like Jagex create cosmetic stores and pump them out so often. It's because people like customization and will pay a premium for it. 
---
RS3's other microtransactions aside...
---
Her emojie can get it tbh
---
Still looks better than in game design
---
I see his logic. smashing these ice warriors to bits.
---
past 77 it's afk just like fishing or w/cing. Simples. 
---
Before 77 you do tears of guthix and put all quest/diary/lamps onto RC and you wont even have to train it. 
---
Go through the website, sign in by clicking the "account" button at the top, and remove the authenticator. Right now there's no delay to remove it (which is DUMB) and you don't need the auth to remove it either.
---
They have never mentioned it being a possible thing. If it ever comes down to a poll? Who knows if it would pass. There may be enough banned players on alts to pass it. But I sure as hell hope it doesn‚Äôt. Do the crime, do the time. 
---
You have to help yourself. If you‚Äôre completely serious go to a gambling addict meeting. If you had an addiction like alcoholism, it‚Äôs not like every store in the world is going to ban you from alcohol, it‚Äôs a problem you have to work on yourself. Besides if it‚Äôs a true addiction, the lockout system will be nothing but a blocker. You‚Äôd transfer stuff to a new account to stake or use a friends account. Instead of Jagex blocking your addiction work on fixing yourself.

Can someone autistic please do a full write up of this in yellow text on a black background?
---
Personally i think there should be a giant crystal seed in the center surrounded by the bank. I like the brewery idea but it needs a couple bars, \[crystal?\] weapon shops, and a ghetto. could use an agility course as well. Industrial quarter is a nice touch.
---
Does anybody know what the symbol on nature runes is called?
---
Yeah most of the times i message through snapchat its a sidechick. Except once, and it was relatively new relationship
---
Can second the deathadder. It's such a fucking perfect mouse size for my hand, I actually cannot switch to another mouse
---
You can duo all gwd bosses, maybe some wildy bosses too
---
In my post i said it should be only available to bh/pvp worlds, also its toggle-able like it was suggested originally, so you can just toggle the key thing off and receive the loot normally
---
More like 10000 for me lol

About a year!

I did this when I first got members, felt like absolute Chad, no regrets

Well not really, I just do what I feel like doing lol, no schedules

Happy?

konar slayer for sure

He is playing a HCIM, you wont be duo bossing with A Friend
---
?? How can you talk about the ease of obtaining something without mentioning its price?
---
I think it's supposed to be a tree
---
oh, i guess thats why they're called water "skins"
---
never thought about that, thought it was a bag of cloth or something.
---
I did 99 hunter a few years ago at red chins in three weeks. I was kinda expecting I could get banned for just doing red chins for like 10-12 hours a day.
---
Looks more brown. It's such an awful shade of red
---
I'm pretty sure it's a tree
---
It's what I do
---
I'd buy the shit out of this. 
---
For those wondering, I got 14 058 xp.

Don't craft your own runes as f2p. You can buy packs with all the runes you need for cheap in Aubury's shop (varrock) or in port sarim.
---
I second this recommendation. Been using this mouse for about 3 years now. 
---
I didn't know I wanted brimstone ferocious gloves before now, but this would certainly motivate me to get back to doing more alch hydra. Big support here.
---
Imagine you make something really important to you in real life. Now imagine the audience to that product react by saying they hate you and everything you are in response. It's really not an overreaction.
---
With insulated boots it doesn‚Äôt do too much damage, but there are times when I get hit 4 or 5 times in a row for like 20+ damage a hit. Just bad rng. 
---
Great work!
---
Dead game 
---
It's weird because the same situation occurs with Lance, the items are really good in Raids but useless outside of them.
---
So, I dont mind the robe idea. But the perk should be like a CHANCE at 1.5x runes. But that's the only thing I'd take from this post.
---
I'd also say that different colors only work at certain altars, blue = water, white = air, red = fire, brown = earth and so on.
---
Adiracc has a ton of mobile players, myself included
---
kronos is def the best seed, especially since it can skip hespori cycles which shaves 10 hours off the next fight. 
---
attas seed from my experience has a minimal increase to herb yield but a noticable increase to allotment/berry/potato cactus yield

fuck yes i have, and she fucking drained me of all my will to live. But i know what that looks like and this is not it.
---
just get 214k agility tickets and turn them in for 200m xp in just 3 minutes! 
---
Because that's not the point. 
---
If all you're hosting is a database like that it'd be pretty close to free. Throw it on a Raspberry Pi or something and forget about it. Can't imagine there'd be tons of traffic after everyone stops playing.
---
Why does this remind me so hard of alien vs predator?
---
The lance is a strong weapon currently in my opinion on dragons. I dont know much about the ring in raids if your correct than i take my words back.
---
Bring an item with a one-click teleport if you're worried, like the Ectophial or a specific teleport tablet. That way if a fight is going badly, you can usually bail out before you die. I'm not sure how it works for instanced fights, but it's a pretty safe strategy.
---
Even if you get poisoned or something and die after teleporting, you can grab another one from your bank and teleport right to where you died. If the world isn't too crowded you have a great chance of getting your stuff back. I got careless once and let a Saradomin Wizard get me when doing a few hard treasure trails, and using the Ectophial to 1) escape and 2) get back to the same spot after the poison killed me saved my entire loadout.
---
I don't believe so.
---
I think it's just the dps that they want to change.
---
Melee can only keep up with the dps with special, and that's limited.
---
Magic just has no hope of catching.
---
They might just change the ammunition damage/strength. I'd hate to see any ranged weapons lower their attack speed. Potions are fine where they are, constant resources going out of the game.
---
Im very short on slayer points though so thats not always an option, she definitely has her niche, but for my current situation she isnt the best option
---
84 con is on my to-do list. Part of the reason im farming zulrah is to pay for my construction lol

Grats on your thieving level too :&gt;

I'm started vorkath with 85 range, it's a pretty steep requirement because you need 200 qp. I don't do much more PVM (yet) so I can't tell you about other ones

Vork is far easier to pay less attention to that Zul. Zul'rah is all about "Easy entry, difficult fight". Vorkath is the other way around

play wow instead, osrs is only good for pking
---
85+ melee
---
90+ mage and range
---
90+ hp
---
70+ prayer
---
I didn't say there was a problem, but you definitely don't make 500m off of 99 rc these days 
---
You just need 82 because you can get a +3 boost with crystal saw and a +5 boost with spices 
---
100/10 would buy
---
It's still incredibly profitable.

IDK about all dragons but against the dragons you want to kill (Vorkath, KBD, etc.), it's only BiS against Rune Dragons and good vs. Olm in solos because it's a 4 tick weapon compared to Scythe.

Get blowpipe, it makes it much, much easier

There is no point. Ironmen are esssentially playing *3 lefts to make a right* mode. 
---
Most Ironmen i know end up doing the same thing they do on their mains all the time and spending triple the amount of time getting something isn't challenging in any way it's just more tedious at the end of the day.
---
They also aren't infinite, so in a while you end up with most of the users on your site banned due to cross-contamination from VPN usage since half of your active PVP demo uses them.

Thank you.  This is why I asked this question.  Every now and then, the answer is the least likely one. 
---
When you fail the course 3 times in a row *teles to varrock*
---
I love this. Nothing will ever make me do tithe farm. Why would I do something so unenjoyable.  
---
When you pick up a graceful mark token thing, you get skulled.
---
I want the fairy ring/spirit tree combo as well, so i need a few extra levels.
---
I saw that movie on Netflix too
---
Few random pointers
---
Glory teleport to draynor is faster than row teleport to falador park
---
You eventually upgrade to the lunar spell catherby tele but Camelot is the fastest before that
---
You can thieve the chests near the shaman cave now for talismans or cannon the little lizardmen for favor and I really suggest getting a talisman because it's so much faster than the wc guild teleport, especially with how cheap the fangs are 
---
cbow better than blowpipe or what?
---
Tears of guthix. Hop on that it's free XP. Got me 40rc in like 3 weeks and I haven't touched the damn skill

I Already posted this 4Head
---
You can't use the +3 boost from the crystal saw for the fairy ring, because you don't need the saw to build it.. (also it's 95 to get them both) 
---
I afk.... a lot.

Ultracompost does.

Blamish oil lives matter. Time to start a petition to make them empty-able

I prefer it. I find that either way I need 2-3 stuns and the range on the cbow saves a lot of time running around the tentacles

50/50 I believe

‚ÄúActual PVP‚Äù 
---
How about anyone can be attacked in the wilderness since your in a PvP zone. 
---
Doing wildy slayer makes you a target since even if your 3 iteming you can have an emblem on you worth around 150k. 
---
Plenty of slayer content outside the wilderness, no one is forcing a player to do wilderness slayer.
---
This is why i just dont Alch

Get all the way over yourself.

Why do the noted bones look too far to the left?

I think you edited the image mate.

That‚Äôs why the negative accuracy on range/mage is an issue
---
Literally the only plug-ins I can think of are jad (gone) cerb, and gorillas. Really can't think of any plug-ins for other bosses unless you count respawn timers. 
---
Oh yeah, I was worried too about the six side buttons being accidentally pressed and the top two on the left click button being pressed accidentally too, it rarely ever happens. Ergonomics are nice and the battery life is amazing, also it can work off a single AA battery or two AA batteries, so its versatile in that way too. Being able to change dpi/cursor speed on the fly is really nice too

They never claimed to be lecturing anyone? It wasnt even aimed at homosexual people...it was made simply as a pride event. The community truly showed how shitty they were through this event.

You need to be on Lunar for ZMI (Ourania altar teleport is mandatory) so doing the pouches is dead easy and only takes a few seconds every 15 minutes or whatever to NPC contact the mage. You can get a moonclan portal in your PoH which makes swapping the spellbook easy. The pouches are kind of annoying, but it's more because of the extra clicks at the altar than needing to repair them. Either way, it's overall not that bad considering that it makes a nice little passive income which more than pays for the stams. If it had a higher xp rate it would be an awesome skill IMO. 
---
I'll have to check out lavas if they're that cheap. I like chilling at ZMI (I've only done a few hours there, am 68 now but got most of 55-66 from diary lamps and quest rewards) but spending a bit more effort for quicker levels is a nice option to have.  
---
Hahaha earrings?

DS2 Ava‚Äôs for sure. Maybe a Slay Helm (I) would be better for Range and Mage bonus?

Awe shit so Id need 90 (+5 spicy stew) to make it. So yeah Ill just stop at 82 then. Thanks you saved me a few mil and a bit of time

Note: Konar was not meant to be above duradel or nieve. So she shouldnt cater towards end game. She was meant to be mid tier so mid tier players can make a bit of cash per task. People are constantly asking for med level content and we finally get something. 
---
Something not planned properly, like brutal blues being the only blues in kourend, seems unintentional for the purpose of the slayer master. That sounds like a task duradel should assign. Not konar.
---
First thing that came to my mind^
---
you should be getting 86 not 88. use the wiki for what combo of things gets you this.
---
I wish I could make it teleport you to lumbridge and hop you to F2P if you don't put a token in every so often but right now it ALT+F4's if you don't put one in every 5 minutes.
---
Yeah I got up to 66 from diaries, I'm almost out of hard diaries and since almost all my stats are mid 70s I'm a long way from doing any elite ones.
---
If you'd rather play than hang out with her then you don't like her.  If you want to play sometimes and she's not ok with only having most of your time then drop her.  If you want to play all the time and still like her then drop both the girl and the game and work on yourself.
---
Meh, its 50/50

Yeah, I think that spoke more about mob mentality than homophobia in the community. The event was weirdly out of place and annoyed people more than I think it threatened anyone's sexuality. And, like any online community of notable size, it escalated and got out of hand. But it was never malicious. The vast majority of it wasn't anyway.
---
Just look around this subreddit and you‚Äôll see at least 25% of the player base aren‚Äôt interested in Warding. That along with the players who ALWAYS vote No, and it‚Äôs easy to see it‚Äôs probably not going to pass.
---
I also want to get the word out about a very sneaky scam: a nigerian prince contacted me about needing my osrs account to smuggle his father's wealth and without hesitation I gave him my details to assist this wealthy fellow for a small chunk of his wealth. Without warning he took all of my virtual gold and items and sold them all, presumably to fund his pking alt to get his dad's main in the rev caves. Moral of the story: everyone is lying online and has a dick.
---
Don't think that's what he's talking about
---
It's fine. Don't turn it into ezscape, that's exactly how we got runescape 3 and you guys are trying hard, so very hard to make it happen again for some reason

sorry but we're talking about op's penis here and not the cocktower
---
Head over to one of the wildys such as Brazil or even some locations in the middle east.
---
Yeah I agree, Ash already said he wanted to make the Gricollers watering can easier to get on a previous Q&amp;A. They should make the rest of the rewards easier to get too. There's some really sick rewards in Tithe Farm but the minigame itself just isn't a lot of fun.
---
It's funny when they realize they got caught with their pants down, because they have the oh shit realization that the ban is incoming. The one I saw probably thought that they were mining the rocks but there was someone else on top of them making them deplete. It wasn't until the other person left that the loser realized they were just clicking endlessly on full ores. Said "Shit" and logged out immediately. 
---
Am I the only one that expected RC to be at like 50?
---
And could also be most people who play runescape are definitely men and don't want to buy a skirt 
---
Not really. Better internet or move. There's no OSRS servers in Asia so even best case scenario in terms of internet it will still be pretty high (like, I'm in the US and have very good internet, but ping to German Worlds is still like 170 ms, just the way it is; of course, I live close to US West worlds and can get 35 ms to those so it's no big deal).
---
If you know you‚Äôre 100% putting *too much* time into the game and she‚Äôs paying for it than you need to cut yourself back and focus on real things and not video games. If she‚Äôs clingy and just craving attention than you may need to sit down and have a talk with her about her mentality. 
---
Real life always comes before osrs, with exceptions of it being your job to play. 
---
oh epic satire haha upvoted! i like how you intentionally misspelled words in your response to emulate a sweaty, flustered nerd hammering his shitty little fallacies onto the keyboard.
---
Idk. I would like to see an expens method that tops 85-95k/hr that doesn't kill your wrist.
---
Lava runecrafting, unlocked at lvl 23, should not be the best method. 
---
Fuck I would be happy with a method that gets 65k/hr so long as it's not pure aids.
---
This is not attack pking? You're using strength
---
You're the dude buying knives at 87 gp.
---
Bada bing, bada boom, and suddenly the opinions of about 6-7 liberal trans atheist vegan activists indirectly control the opinion section of the world's media outlets ;)
---
Yeah pking is the only good thing in the game because this lv 57 Gmaul pure says so. Lol 
---
also like all of canada

She should dump you. Save you the trouble.

Report this as a bug in game. That's how the scythe got updated to work on webs.

Thanks Settled
---
Your math is backwards. Bonds sell like hot potatoes on the GE because people don't like overpaying for membership. A bond is $6.99 legit or around $3 if you rwt with a gold farmer. So bonds aren't making rwt more legit, but rather making paying for membership less legit.

What content in particular? I haven't played for awhile so I'm not sure what new BiS items we've received. I bet the blowpipe is still top tier and will be for years to come.

I got burnt out after getting the Inferno. I pretty much log in and chill at the Grand Exchange like this.

people see bottom posts, they downvote.

Correct.

Not even a bad idea... would give you some time to really consider if this is a good idea.
---
It‚Äôs pretty rare 
---
I thought you wrote that it was a choice to make it an unsafe death, my statement is that 'unsafe death' should be the normal conditions of content. It's a choice to make it safe.

Did I misunderstand what you were saying?

Doubt that would ever pass a poll,  unfortunately.

---
For anyone curious this is why the blowpipe can't be recolored.  
---
They cant store the information on the item without engine work.  
---
Each item only has a 4 bytes that can be used for storing information about the item.  
---
Since the blowpipe needs to be able to hold 16383 (214) - 1 darts and scales it needs to use at least 13 bits for each. It also needs to hold the dart type which can be any one of 8 which requires 3 bits.  
---
Now you might say 13 + 13 + 3 = 29 so they should be able to use the last 3 bits for color right? Well I assume they can only partition into signed integers which would require a sign bit for each value giving 14+14+4 = 32 bits or 4 bytes.  
---
Now that last part is just my theory, it could be that they need 3 bits for other information we don't know about.  
---
Either way they don't have any bits left to store information about the item color.
---
Idk most of the responses has been wholesome and all around good advice, minus the memers.

This would be cool if there was one account that hundreds of people have to put a coin in and get as much progress as possible before the time runs out. So basically it‚Äôs a shared account by who ever puts a coin in and continues the progress where the last person left off. 
---
How much?
---
Those deep wildy countries aren‚Äôt worth it when they attack back. Try glitch PKing at home when you know people won‚Äôt attack back. Schools are a solid choice! 
---
Reeeeepost

Molten perhaps, different enough from Zulrah's magma mutagen while still fitting the red hydra forms aesthetic.
---
Ran 98-99 on slayer with mainly an obby Guthans swap since I can‚Äôt afford bandos atm, 92-97 done with dharok nmz
---
Public off, I like it that way. 
---
Not exceptionally so no. but its in the wildy of course, so ymmv. 
---
bring a couple sharks karambwans brews and restores.

The 3 bosses in the fight have special attacks that teleblock and freeze you. and one unique move per boss. guthix boss throws a heal pod out you have to hit, zammy throws something at you you have to outrun, and i cant remember what saradomin does.
---
A lot of it has to do with streamers/no lifers running out of things to do, and purposefully starting harder accounts that take longer to finish anything so they can delay the withdrawal symptoms.

Lmao, they made ferocious gloves into a real thing.

I understand that u brought a cannon to catacombs lol

Perfectly said. In a 12 year long relationship right now expecting it to be my last one, too. We respect each other and each others hobbies and she can tell me I'm spending too much time on osrs, as can I with her on Netflix TV shows.

We can talk like adults and sort it out and stop accidentally neglecting each other and that's how it should be.

I'm averaging 4-6 farming contracts a day just logging in casually at work.

It's quite lucrative.

He threw a little hissy fit that‚Äôs hilarious.
---
86% is better, but 3 Skeletons die faster because of Salve (ei) bonus so 88% is faster to reach. I don't think it makes too much of a difference either way so don't mind it, just do whichever is more convenient based on the spawns.
---
That's his rune pouch
---
report him to ur teacher
---
And Jmods think b dhide is OP. Can these niet helm be made degradable?
---
How much is this?
---
U gud it ez
---
Because after a while you simply have to accept that's what the game *is*, and either do it or quit. 1.1kc myself with no leather or claws, just sweet sweet 60k alch tails. 
---
Armadyl helm if you have the budget for it, otherwise yeah prolly blessed coif
---
imagine being that much of a beta ur afraid to wear a skirt in a dumbass cookie clicker minigame
---
Magic is the most accurate attack style against tanks of the same style. 200% acc and 35% damage buff is retarded
---
Rc because click intensive and low xp rates
---
Fake 
---
Astonishing. Just by looking at a gay you can see who is the bro (normal guy) and who is a bitch.
---
Jemgex add kitten mittons pls.
---
Oh they absolutely are equal. If you removed blowpipe and tbow from the game, range would be incredibly far behind melee in dps, even with rigour.
---
But agility same right?

This is someone else‚Äôs list of basic requirements for making a zerker but the same will apply to a range tank because you‚Äôll get the defensive stats for void, Lunar spellbook for vengeance and more all while getting the 175 quest points requirement for recipe for disaster. You basically can‚Äôt go wrong training any account type resembling a max med/piety pure/etc when it comes to questing because you simply have to train no matter what to reach objectives like 70 defense and 74/77 prayer. That being said, you should definitely quest for all of the skills you need in the most logical order early rather than training extensively beforehand(excluding prayer before the bigger quests for the sake of overhead protection convenience). Use the old school wiki to find whatever skill you need next and find the quests rewarding ___ experience section to plan accordingly. You should also look towards the future of your account: torv‚Äôs account build at that point was 99 cmb. The same account type could have elite void, augury, 75 attack and 99 strength for eight combat levels, which at that point could be used for doloing pvm content or pushing your pvp experience further. If you find this to be too much and want a taste of the account then just rush Ava‚Äôs, the intermediate boat at pest control for void range, 52 prayer and just use the dragon knife to dark bow combo without vengeance for a bit. There are a lot of items you potentially need for things like the salve amulet for Vorkath and some quest rewards you might want like access to zeah with different training methods that this quest list doesn‚Äôt cover so make sure to shop around for methods and stray from the list when it helps to speed up the process.

*rush buys GPS* 
---
You are legit an idiot. the whole point is of course they could lie about something like that. Get some reading comprehension before you comment again and call someone retarted. 
---
I have to disagree as it removes incentive for doing tithe farm. 
---
The other guy is right about jmods not reading these threads, but they probably wouldn't go for this idea, considering how much engine work group iron mode is going to take.
---
I‚Äôve read that in terms of loading time, you want a square. So 2X2 would load fastest. If you add any more rooms, you‚Äôd want to then go for 3X3 (as far as I know at that point you might as well use all 9 spaces because there isn‚Äôt a difference in load time). 
---
My house is:
---
Spellbook altar / Fairy ring and pool / nexus
---
Spirit tree / entrance portal / obelisk
---
Costume room / kitchen / barrows repair 
---
Obviously some can be replaced for others depending on what you need or want. 
---
Once u get seers I find agility not bad
---
So long as PoE does well I think they will likely stay hands off for the none chinese versions. Also I would think Tencent won't have much interest in Jagex.

Or people could just not have 5iq

B0atys "One Man Army" series is really good, Devious has an UIM series, and Alkans HCIM videos are entertaining too!
---
meta is actually to get 75 agility for pyramid for gp then get seeds from master gardeners then do 99 fishing / 99 mining while doing farm runs for farming and herblore levels then 99 firemaking at wintertodt then you can go above 10hp and finally play the game
---
Needs a minigame 
---
actual good content
---
32m according to op
---
That was a part of my point lol, get 75 range it will make it a hell of a lot easier
---
On a fucking game? Hilarious.  
---
Real life...not at all.

You about to get decimated

No problem, good luck!

Yeah sorry the Dev blog didnt actually get your account hacked. You just carelessly clicked on a phishing link.

The absolute state of your post history though, I‚Äôm not sure whether to feel sorry for you or pity you.

I'll be sure to pay when I'm on my HCIM I suppose. o_o

Mudkip is good! He‚Äôs a HCIM that‚Äôs like 50 levels from max. I‚Äôve been watching his series for a while
---
Fuck. Im laughing so much in the bus rn
---
How do they get hit by ring of suffering? Time to remove that feature since it makes no sense.
---
Thats way too much bandos chestplate is 20mil
---
what if youre facing east
---
It's a literal ring of recoil. 
---
Yeah trawler is the biggest xp waste. Did 6 trawler games on 2 accs and got no pieces on either. Would much rather do an activity that gets xp and work towards a guaranteed reward as opposed to zero xp RNGscape 
---
Haha jokes on you guys I was only pretending to be a retarded bigot.   
---
3 funny 5 me guys, so advanced, much humour. 
---
Agility; I really don't understand how people find RC worse.
---
RC gets you Runes, and can at least offer a bit of risk and change of pace if using Abyss. Agility is just repeating the same rooftop courses, over and over again...
---
According to my total level I‚Äôm 12
---
so pretty much "fuck you deal with it" is what you're saying? 
---
Let‚Äôs be honest here....
---
I don‚Äôt care which boss we talking about
---
I don‚Äôt care which quest we talking about
---
I don‚Äôt care which is easier to learn and which is harder (that‚Äôs what she said)
---
At the end of the day...
---
Elvarg was one fucking beast to tame. 
---
I don‚Äôt do any bossing with any fewer than two friends. Just not as fun to get a drop if you don‚Äôt have someone to share the excitement with imo. 
---
Who?
---
this game needs skills like agil and rc
---
I'm saying allow the contracts to contribute to points for the outfit. I'm not saying to remove them from tithe farm completely. You make it so contracts are a more passive option. The entire farming skill as a whole is passive as it it so this should be much different. 
---
&gt; Haha jokes on you guys I was only pretending to be a retarded bigot. 
---
&gt;3 funny 5 me guys, so advanced, much humour.
---
pick one
---
also, humor is subjective.
---
Just because your ping is bad doesn‚Äôt mean the servers are gone
---
ayyyy i did that one yesterday lol
---
Exactly. The xp is still slow, there's tons of clicking, and all you see is the same small map for hours and hours. The only good thing we get is the marks of grace and that takes forever to get 260.
---
plateskirts are objectively better, too
---
Agility can be trained through raids 1 while making loads of money
---
Rip
---
like 25
---
I keep getting slowed down by getting celastrus tasks when I don't have one planted yet (which I'm going to start doing once this one finishes), otherwise I'm usually getting at least 3 or 4 a day. It'd be really nice if I could get a contract for the redwood I've had finished for a week.. 
---
More client work less items in the game. Still a cool idea. 
---
Why is the gauntlet being made an unsafe death? There's literally zero risk for normal accounts and ironmen, it seems so pointless adding the risk only for special game modes. Make normal accounts have to actually risk something if you're going to make it an unsafe death
---
Did the same as a kid. Those rock crabs didn‚Äôt stand a chance
---
Please let Firemaking skillcape at least act as a tinderbox! Right now it shares the same effect as an Easy Diary reward for Kandarin Headgear... I don't think a wearable tinderbox would be too OP of an upgrade. 
---
Same applies to ring of recoil, by your logic they're nowhere near the player, so they shouldn't get hit by it.
---
I use to alc while I closed the doors on the pure essence miners in varrock.
---
Don‚Äôt tell me how to straw man
---
But there's no dark wizards in lumbridge.
---
There were people who were serious at the start, but people started meming it
---
Honestly at this point I've stopped feeling bad for people falling for this, it's been around for ages. It takes two seconds of though to determine if something on twitch is fishy, the scam streams aren't very creative...
---
they should be tradeable so pkers have incentive besides griefing and people who hate the wilderness can still get black graceful as long as they are willing to pay for it
---
Not gonna lie this is sick. Defo bring it to some merch company
---
My bad.. Guess I'm out of date
---
This game needs long grinds. This game is literally only grinds.
---
Depends on the girl tbh, if shes average then ditch her. If she is special then maybe choose her over the game
---
Need another sub for this rule34 shit. 
---
Lol, I just used photoshop for this suggestion. Got all images from the wiki and just simple recolourings.
---
Well it's good that the memers outyelled the serious people then?
---
is this harassment?
---
Yeah it was really fun for real! I remember you could alch to make money, you could do herblore and make a killing, you could fletch for what was considered at the time absolute bank, everything was amazing
---
Fish in barrels would have more places to hide and better survival odds. 
---
Runecrafting. Agility is much more AFK
---
Thieving
---
Points or xp?
---
Get her addicted to runescape.
---
depends on the service mate, 1k is for the weird 10 year old boys who act as girls, you know the ones who's name is (g4m3rgirlxx). If you pay top dollar like 500k you can get an older guy who is exceptionally well at acting like a female and might even have fake female voice simulator if necessary. 
---
Try official client I would think it wouldn‚Äôt use up as much cpu as something like runelite
---
I talk about corruption and you immediately think of Jewish people. Who's the real bigot here?
---
Classic
---
I‚Äôd like to get points first to imbue my slayer helm and berserker ring, then I‚Äôd like to do it for experience 
---
I'm not sure how you do it, but couldn't you make an ahk script that clicks spellbook, lumbridge tele, then hops to a favourited f2p world?
---
It‚Äôs frequently talked about in the media. 
---
Bonds
---
While your calculations are most probably correct, not everyone plays runescape to solely farm zulrah or vorkath. Therefore the extra gp from herb runs is pretty handy for a low to medium level player training slayer for example. 
---
So on the whole i'd say yes herb runs are still very worth it
---
You'll get muted. and if you keep it up, permanently muted.
---
Oop sorry, didn't see that.
---
They haven't been worth doing for a while at lategame.
---
Camera angle?
---
Still here and I'm following it if anyone wants it. Just north of castle walls
---
Up voted as curious if real or fake for the ban :) 
---
Ahh yea that's probably it
---
I think this fits into a similar category to AGS, D claws and the Dark bow
---
If anything I feel magic is the weakest style in general nh unless you bring occult+staff, especially as most opt for double hides
---
I like runecrafting.
---
How do you know it‚Äôs BS...
---
Definition of a crybaby lmfao
---
Bro, sadly not much can be done. Atleast to my knowlegde. Maybe you like some Castle Wars to practice switches tanking and strategy atleast thats what i do for fun.
---
Essence running is still very much a thing. I think the going rate is a few mil per hour at ZMI even at lower RC levels.
---
How do you say her name
---
Efficient 3 man ToB is over 13m per hour. 
---
I believe technically in the rules scamming and luring are both against the rules. But so is botting and how many of those do you see every day
---
reddit is gunna eat that shit up 
---
I didn't know that, have you got a source for this?
---
use rapid fire only
---
I like the stats but the current design they have looks a bit off
---
Tbh I'm just watching out of habit. Hoping maybe he'll get his shit together and actually make something decent but that doesnt look like it will happen. I used to love his unofficial ironman, darkscape, and RS3 ironman stuff. His stuff is good when hes enjoying the game. 
---
Rs at 5? I was 14 in 2004 when i made my first account and i feel uve missed alot of good shit
---
Now you have a good reason to camp the other bosses early
---
Its an adult man with a fake mustache twitter pic. Im suprised there isnt already a lawsuit being filed and a teary eyed vlog entry.
---
The splasher seems to distract the guard away from the door and then drags hims in view of the door, then they cannot enter.
---
Ah yes, I've stolen enough Runescape names in my campaigns :) They sound pretty great and generally people have no idea.  
---
I turned public off awhile ago
---
no thanks
---
This was just a joke about random events, obviously 
---
inb4 cheat client
---
&gt; Agility makes EVERYTHING you do, including RC, more efficient. 
---
I'm not arguing that; Agility is beneficial, but while training it, you aren't getting an obvious benefit, and the benefits of Agility only increase when you gain in levels. That (for me anyway) makes it a drag to train.
---
With RC, I get more Runes every trip. I don't have to wait an entire level to see some sort of gain. I can do 3 RC runs and end up with more Runes than I started with, and I don't have to necessarily gain a RC level.
---
I'd assume his software would allow you to "assume" perfect tick usage of each set, calculate DPS, calculate miss rate, etc.
---
I'd say it's a pretty solid idea IF the actual data is correct going in.
---
I'll be back next week! 
---
I love this idea!
---
If you cant have a hobby and a girlfriend then she needs to go
---
i don't think you know what the r in rng means
---
This would be epic
---
Use rapid fire only 
---
Is your sister single?
---
are you saying accurate is less accurate than long range or rapid?
---
&gt;Rapid Fire and Long-range check out fine, they attack as intended(sometimes rapid hits higher)
---
well yeah your max hits fluctuate a lot when using %boosting stuff like salve void dhcb and rigour all at once and look at different range level (due to range pot decaying)
---
accurate is significantly less dps due to attacking a tick slower.
---
If this is real then be honest and ask yourself if you are really playing too much. If you are then you're lucky that she's giving you a HUUUUUGEEEE red flag before she either cheats or leaves you.
---
Information is information, claiming reading a sentence in one language and reading it in another are easier for different people. If you think it's easier to read English, cool! Good for you :3 To someone who reads Spanish they might disagree. If you aren't aware that Green projectiles= Range and white= Mage then the plugin won't help you anyway, so if you think it's too easy for you, by all means continue using the classic client! But spreading false misinformation, while apparently okay in US politics, is still frowned upon by the intellecual community. Nothing in the plugins show any information faster than the classic client, they do not automatically do anything, they do not even explain how boss fights work. Even in OPs example, NOTHING was done by a computer. HE PERSONALLY put lines around the tiles, using his game knowledge of the mechanics and map layout. His character does not path there automatically, he does the same actions someone with the knowledge he posses could do if they had not marked the tiles. To think that my having a line on a screen somehow means he paths, clicks, prays, swaps, or plans his gear and inventory better, or even differently than a vanilla player of equal skill is laughable at best, piteous at worst.

honestly 90-99 agi is very easy at ardy course. You never have to move your camera angle, just zoom out and click the green boxes. I did about 3m agi xp this week and it's very afk just watch netflix/yt/reddit/twitch etc

What about dragonfire ward and pegasian boots?
---
I would just play castle wars all day. I remember seeing people using the MSB and thinking that the spec for it was so sick, so I bought a magic longbow (because I had assumed the spec would be the same) and would spec with it, and always asked my friends "how do i shoot 2 times?"
---
People saying runecrafting is bad is such a meme at this point that people just believe it without trying.  Agility is roughly the same as runecrafting, both are chill when you can watch something else, both don't have many options for the high end xp/hr.  It's all preference, but memes right.
---
Warding should just be an extension of runecrafting with decent xp rates, rc only has like 3 sections in he skills menu

Like a kazillion. Do they ever get banned? Seems like Jagex is allowing botting and scamming. 
---
Play RS music from your phone according to which zone they're in
---
There's still far too many variables.  It's possible, but you'd need extremely good AI and even then, the results may not be accurate.  Just seems like a waste of time for something that isn't really of any real value to proper pkers.  As a personal learning project, sure, but I can't see it ever being useful.
---
Because there are no other suggestions to implement, so let's get short term satisfaction instead?
---
They do get banned.
---
But it isn't combat
---
Reminds me of the dicing/doubling bots at G.E. You right-click follow them, then say "(insert their name) There's a player moderator/mod/Jmod over there!" and they log instantly.

It's fun.

Thats cool and all but can we talk about OP's organization skills, gahdamn come clean my house

You could probably manage barrows with your current stats. it'd be a trek pretty much every time (assuming you don't have barrows tele tabs), but I still average \~90k/chest.
---
Nice screenshot

Agility is the worst 
---
I'm back again. Done some research and messaged this 'Fel' guy to see what's actually happening and found out why he harasses you guys.
---
As far as i can tell, it seems like he hates RoT and you guys nutride them like crazy. Things like changing your outfits to the same as RoT and saying stuff they say to flame with. You also pay RoT to PvM and he doesn't like this. He also mentioned that he didn't hit any PvM'ers at all but was bolted on sight soon as he arrived in 1 item (You actually started this war with him?). 
---
If this is all true, i'm 100% for the 'Harasser'. You guys should pay him or offer him PvM protection or something like this.
---
Sorry who the fuck
---
When it comes to jewellery you can only have 3 placeholders 1 for max charge, 1 for uncharged and 1 for jewellery with some used charges. You can't have a place holder for each charge. Hope that makes sense. 
---
Oh yeah they absolutely should have released the quest by now, since that was the intent of the nerf. I don't think it would be a good idea to buff it now just to nerf it later though. People flipped over the nerf originally no need to relive that.
---
Actually when a recovery request is accepted it does lock the account and kick anyone in it off until a new pass word is set.
---
If it didn‚Äôt auto send the email beforehand you could potentially catch them off guard and possibly get the account locked before they steal all your shit
---
Thanks bud. We did it with me tanking and the 2 DPS was budget gear on lvl 100s and only I had a bgs no other specs. Felt like it was a good trip for being welfare status Haha. One day we'll get to 40+
---
you can just choose not to pray against monsters 
---
That is crazy though... I mean when you look at if from someone with my perspective the roles are reversed... I started on mobile after many years of not playing because if a lack of a PC... Now I'm getting ready to buy a PC and feel as though it will be a challenge for me as I've been playing on mobile since the mobile release... 
---
Why?
---
I have an idea..
---
What if we don't keep good content locked behind content that isn't fun to do? 
---
Or watch both... And verf too. Karamja only really enjoying his series up to now. 
---
It should be easy to make the requests through Tor and renew the circuit every time you connect to it (to use different identities). That way you wouldn't be exposing your real IP address, making it harder to filter out requests based on their origin and also protecting you against retaliation. Cool stuff!
---
From where you're kneeling it must seem like an 18-carat run of bad luck.
---
But, truth is... the game was rigged from the start.
---
Innit. What if it was all enjoyable? Would that make rs a worse game? 
---
yeah, rot is kind of messed up for this it probably really hurt these guys feelings.
---
she clearly cares about her self, just like every female.   
---
She wants the guy to change to suit her needs.

Not entirely unreasonable. .. . and there are obviosuly a myriad of details missing but  
---
9/10 girls are just selfish and you'll be better off without them

Now as I expect to get downvoted for this opinion I think we need not to add this depending on how many people would go for it.
---
All these untradable cosmetics would be better put into a bond store like solomans only you pay via bonds .
---
Pets and mutagens put a plastic gain on a boss essentially destroying the value of uniques further on top of the already generous alchables.
---
Examples of where generous tables and pet like drops ruined values on items would be Zulrah. Generous loot and a plastic gain of pets and mutagens dropped the value on blowpipe. Blowpipe is under 10m and competes very closely to the twisted bow. Blowpipe would have such a higher value if they removed pets and the generous table. With all the people hunting pets they are bringing in so many uniques due to going rather dry. I also think the onyx should be removed from Zulrah and the uniques could be dropped at rarer rate but that won't stop the ever pumping uniques coming in because of pets.
---
Jagex is doing their best to make hydra uniques keep value by changing around what the tail is used for much like how they came up with uniques having a crush into Zulrah scales. Essentially keeping the value of uniques at a semi fixed rate given scales are being removed faster than they come in.
---
Please don't add a worthless completionist item like or uniques will plummet like Zulrah's. 
---
Also... The hydra table should be nerfed to give uniques more value... And they should be degradable and repairable via GP or other components.. Change My Mind.
---
nah, i brought dh plate, dinhs, burning amulet, ds2 orb. kept orb as +1. Lost maybe 5 invents of bones from 90-99. easily the fastest item to kill yourself with. just spam 1-2-3 and you're dead in seconds.
---
You get the graceful marks for killing someone with them.
---
Well then it makes perfect sense.
---
Basically I got really manic one day and said "I'm going to build an arcade cabinet!". Then I ordered the joystick and buttons which next day forced me to buy all the damaged cedar from work that I could fit into my truck because at that point I was practically invested after spending that fourty whole dollars. After that I found a detailed diagram for a basic cabinet which I promptly ignored and then used my table saw to make 2x3's and, forgetting to angle the monitor mount (I'm pretending it was based off of a donkey Kong jr. Cabinet) built the frame. Then I added the sides made out of cedar house siding, made and printed a template for the button layout, centered the page  on the panel instead joystick position and used a spade bit set to drill the button and joystick holes. Then proceeded to install an x-star dp2710 2560x1440 monitor. Put in a mini-itx gaming rig with a 4770k and 1060ti that I built and customized as a steam machine. Even the pretty big cabinet size, it was kinda a nightmare to wire up the buttons. To make matters worse I later replaced them all with Happ style tactical feedback buttons which meant I had to redo it all. Decided then to install a trackball which was a huge pain in the ass which required me to cut about 4 more panels including screw ups, used a router to carve the trackball opening and inlay of the housing into the control panel, wired that shit up, cut (so far, some of the) cedar corner molding with the table saw, added sexy rgb, put USB ports on the side, added a power inlet to tidy things up, came up with the name runescade and then etched the acrylic marquee with a Dremel. So far have spent a few hundred and a couple weeks on it, mostly only so cheap because I bought and remilled damaged lumber.

If she does not want to come second to RuneScape she should provide more value than RuneScape, which she is clearly not. Asking to be assigned more value instead of earning more value through her own actions is a BAD sign.

She is lazy and selfish. dump her.

Reddit mods can seriously suck.i got banned from r/LSC for pointing out that Maduro is corrupt as Venezuela is extremely rich and the people are starving. It sucks

Oh cool. Somebody made Runescape 3 into a real thing. 
---
&gt;sure you can hit harder on rapid than you can on defensive or accurate. 
---
Not true.
---
Max hit = 0.5 + A * (B+64) /640
---
A is found from visible range level* prayer
---
boost 
---
Then rounded down 
---
and then add combat stance boost. Range gets 3 added here for accurate style. Unless I'm mistaken no other stances add anything here. 
---
Then 8 is added
---
Then any void/salve/black mask buffs are multiplied.
---
A gives you effective ranged strength, b is equipment bonuses and not really relevant here.
---
Matt add me back on discord..

Because if my account is stolen I‚Äôm not trying to change the password . I‚Äôm trying to get my account back from a hijacker

Back in the day it used to ask you before it did anything what your issue was

You used to be able to select your account was stolen and it‚Äôd lock your account until you put your recovery request in.
---
Even the topic of it aside, he's just an enjoyable dude to watch and be excited for. Good editing and pacing in his videos, too.

Are there any updates on group ironman mode? Is it expected to be released this year?
---
Alright but 30 minutes trio isn't efficient. I do more duos than trios and we get around 34 minutes usually. 
---
Yeah, but like someone mentioned that would technically be botting.
---
I definitely do! But I believe the length of time Caveman Only‚Äôs been active and the sheer uniqueness of his limits compared to other snowflake accounts should make him stand out more than he does in views and publicity in my opinion
---
Oh okay hahaha what could you be hiding lmao. Too bad jagex doesnt like good names lol
---
It always leans to the left.
---
the odds of getting 2 3a items on your first clue must be less than 1 in millions. I really can't tell if this is a troll or not. 
---
Apparently lol. Made myself clearer in my comment but things should be enjoyable.
---
fixed it lmfao, and nothing bro i sweear
---
probably sir suh dude's bots
---
The more letters you take out of words you type the less likely I‚Äôm going to believe anything you‚Äôre saying.
---
&gt;jsut to discourage players from account sharing and potentially having their account stolen
---
well yes and and so that they can play that card when people start whining, like inferno, or for competitive things, like DMMT or King of the Skill, or potential future endeavors so they choose to deem it unfair
---
account sharing will never not be a rule, whether you'll actually get in trouble for sharing and doing X activity is a different story
---
I was agreeing with you fwiw
---
I am getting alot of runes tho. And not paying money
---
Surely you could lock random people's accounts?
---
I also don't see how they managed to get into your account in the first place. If you have an email set up and 2 step verification, incredibly hard in the first place for it to be taken. 
---
Check your emails spamfolder
---
Hey, it's me your biggest fan! Please say hello.

At least iron your shirt

Just make it so it trims with your existing set

Nope. Go ahead and put in some offers lmao
---
I kept getting them as slayer tasks on my baby pure and I enjoyed them quite a bit.  I'm not saying they aren't profitable and may be one of the better npcs to do in f2p but they're good in p2p too. overall p2p offers way more benefits and xp rates so there is that.
---
Never heard of settled, someone explain what he does to me?
---
This
---
Why put it in the wilderness at all if it serves no purpose to PVP other than trolling skillers?
---
Not against putting it in the wilderness, but there has to be something tangible at risk if that's the idea
---
Let‚Äôs remove everything but a bronze pick axe and tin/copper rocks because everything past that just buffs skilling exp rates.
---
Not a troll, would have to scroll for a million years in my discord server to find the screenshot though it was over a year ago lol
---
Omg I have found a ticket number for my account proving its mine jagex mods if your reading this please look into the hijacking of my account ‚Äúshadostrike4‚Äù here‚Äôs the ticket number

This was just posted. How many reddit accounts are you ROTards going to make to spam this trash?
---
2 clicks either way
---
They had access to my email. My computer got logged.
---
Mid you get keylogged your essentially fucked
---
you should expect to be there for another 7k  
---
god speed, it will be worth it and provided you don't do anything retarded you will never have to do this specific grind again  
---
for the record, it is not any different than clearing a GWD collection so if this is outside of your ability you may want to just De-Iron.  
---
god speed.
---
hahahahha
---
pls dont tell me you buried them at the ge
---
Just use runelite.
---
The Tor network typically has a very small number of exit nodes and most exit nodes are either publicly listed or easily discoverable.
---
I had a RC bot within the top 100 highscores at one point. It takes an hour doing fire runes to get 40+ not a big deal.
---
TIL moms credit card is at the air altar. Brb boys.
---
With the release of mobile and the influx of new players to the game, does Jagex have any plans to do another Character Name Release as was done in March of 2017?
---
I'm sure there are a large number of both veteran and new players who would love a chance to claim a display name they desire but are currently unable to obtain due to inactive or banned accounts occupying the names. As someone who returned to OSRS after mobile was released, I found it extremely difficult and time consuming to come up with a display name I was content with.
---
Pretty shitty drop if u ask me
---
puff daddy
---
I don't get why we can't have an activity that's fast but at the same time requires skill and is challenging to the player.
---
I mean aren't activities like Volcanic Mining and Sullicep Mushrooms cool because of this? I wish other skills shared an activity as dangerous as those two.
---
You haven't been to the wilderness much have you?
---
PKers kill players when they're walking around with 0 risk anyway. 
---
Java is a shitty language and it's really badly optimized on macos. Macbooks always try to stay silent to the very end of 90+ cpu temps. When I used my 2015 mbp to play runescape I had some software that could be used to tweak the cpu fan speeds up.
---
But can it play Tekken though?
---
I'm not sure what you are objecting to. I don't really know what the fuck the helm does other than something to do with venom. I'm just saying that if level 126s are deep wildy PKing while wearing the helmet then there is obviously some use for it and it isn't dead content. 
---
Just nerf neiz helm thing is stupid op. Neiz should give - range and mage stats like berserker. And serp needs reduced zulra scales use now that it doesnt venom.
---
Yes, I've donated a few spades in my time
---
You're talking about an efficiency that normal people can't reach. You're talking about the .1% of the game. 
---
You're right. The only thing you can do is be more careful. About websites you visit and things you download.
---
The simple fact is, the easier it is for you to get your account back, the easier it is for someone to steal it from you. That is why it's so hard to get it back. Because it's hard to take it in the first place. 
---
I just guess a lot of people are excited for seeing someone overcome a different challenge than what the base game offers and what a lot of other youtubers have done in general.
---
It's a change and a challenge. Sure he has to get lamps for 15 con and mindnumbing hunter.
---
But there's so much more involved in it too. The lamp grinds are secondary. I don't think anyone is mad hype over the 10 month lamp grind lmfao.
---
I mean technically the April Fools', Birthday events and Crack The Clue aren't holiday events either, can't recall anyone being mad during those. The holiday thing was just made up as a front to deflect criticism of homophobia.
---
They should bring back the original Graceful, it looked so clean.
---
something around 800M
---
That solution doesn't change much at all: it would just continue to be slightly better but more expensive barrows (pretty much same melee def, worse range def, str bonus, poison protection.) 
---
I think for something as expensive as a serp helm, it should be the dominant helm overall with a few niche uses for neitznot and barrows.
---
* Neitznot would be the bargain option, and the best if you're not really concerned with def.
---
* Verac would be good for caves/inferno/solo sara where you need prayer
---
* Torag/guthan would be better for solo Bandos because of the 12 range def
---
This also leaves room for another helm that's better offensively for melee at the expense of defense.
---
How many weeks of tears of Guthrix? 
---
Idk why you assume that i am, or even if i was that its a bad thing some how
---
This world be nice. But for the time being if you're up for it you can find little batches if code that run in command prompt (.bat) which will check the ping of every single world then spit out the world with the lowest ping at the end.
---
I‚Äôm just going to say it, you are full of shit
---
Calling it now, you said you got cleaned at the duel arena?
---
You got cleaned, sold your account, then tried tor Recover it when the buyer loaded it with gold and now you‚Äôre pissed off because they got warned and took the gold off before you could recover the account.
---
You‚Äôre a scamming piece of shit most likely.
---

What's so funny?
---
suffering is very useful
---
Test comment please ignore 
---
Removed it for no reason? Keep making shit up. The reason was that it was broken. You can still venom minions with serp + BP/tentacle 
---
Which they've done plenty of times already.
---
Great! That'll get me to 10 rc on my new ironman
---
Hahahah!!! Get a load of this guy!!

I'm 13 and I just started in 2018

Yo make him play so it‚Äôs like having a bot

Can you sort this by location then in order of number? 
---
Wait till 60-70 :) I recomend watching stand up comedy in the background. Only thing that keeps me safe while I grind 
---
I‚Äôd imagine the reverse is true.
---
Maybe a VPN will do the trick. Worth a try.
---
Temperature is around negative frostbite here in Toronto area
---
Aw man, having to click autocast iban blast is so annoying.
---
Did you blast/trident the skeleton/bloodworms? I usually whip them to save charges.
---
Having trident also lets me freeze melee brothers with ice burst instead of using prayer prayer pots. Probably not very gp efficient but way more enjoyable personally. (Full pray -&gt; Ahrim -&gt; Karil -&gt; Everyone else)
---
It's been talked about by the Jmods for so long, I just wish they'd implement it. Heaps of people were suggesting an agility course around ToB to earn it
---
Rs3 came after eoc so you have something wrong lol
---
How the fuck u can be sure its "safe", only the creator knows that. I ve seen so many topic with scammed/stolen acc's. Im more than sure half of em are caused 3rd party (to make game ezpz) software. Are u guys like autistics or something, u cannot play the game without help?
---
99 fisting
---
I'd recommend downloading a task manager, there are probably some background apps that you can kill off to help. At least, that's what works for my Fire 7
---
I've just been using an onscreen keyboard.
---
In my opinion, warding aligns more with runecrafting than crafting. It just makes sense as warding and runecrafting are crafting by magical means. 
---
I'd say more people can, they just prefer the safer easier methods. I was mainly just pointing out how off the rates assumed were! 
---
Then why are so many OSRS players against it?
---
Yeah you guys did fine. It sucks only having 1 bgs as well. Nice tank.
---
Lmao didnt blur prayer, Im stealing that shit
---
So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve seen people leave so many drops behind. I‚Äôve looted probably 200k worth of items during tasks from them leaving shit. Rannars for days
---
Unironed shirts are causal as hell don‚Äôt hate m8, tell your friends.
---
Don't worry I'm not that retarded 
---
Since you dont watch his area restricted ultimate ironman, I doubt he does anything to you.
---
I believe the software was macs fan control. You can set nice temperature curves with. For example at 55c the fans speed is 35% and at 80c 90% and so on...
