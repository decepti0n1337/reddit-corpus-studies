50-56 bank spaces is still a shit ton for an ironman.... Out of all the bits of content that take bankspace (herblore, pvm gear, runes, etc) farming takes up one of the largest chunks.

I started soloing around 500kc, and just improved over time. All it takes is practice and you will eventually be able to do the efficiently. You don't need max gear for solos but items such as sang staff/tbow/dhcb really helps

One additional thing is. Make the Boxing ring for pets so that we can fight our pets against other peoples pets. Make the boxing ring for pets work like the normal boxing ring. Right now you can only fight cats and only your cats, so it's worthless and useless.

RoT, a large and well-known PvP clan, has been known for a while now to have, on multiple occasions, engineered DDOS attacks on people, especially during Deadman tournaments. They also have ties to the disgraced Mod Jed and iirc he was abusing his power to funnel gold to the clan. The main controversy is that they have an ingame statue honouring them for prior achievements that were likely achieved by cheating.

Yeah it's a shame. It's something that applies to a small audience but would be extremely helpful to them. Maybe one day.

You got comments about birdhouses so I'll tip you for farming- you dont have to run all kinds of crops, but at LEAST also run hops. It takes an extra 5 minutes for around 90 to 100k straight profit on a run if you have all the teleports unlocked. For fastest access you want to do enlightened journey and watchtower quest (or just use nightmare zone minigame teleport with a certain combat level). 
---
Chronicle and run Southeast
---
Camelot and run Northwest
---
Ring of Dueling to Balloon to Entrana 
---
Nightmarezone and run West inside Yanille 
---
Supposedly you can make more money with jute fibre but yanillian hops are traded more frequently and are more consistent. 
---
I am 82 farming and have never used resurrect crop and would advise you put that time instead into those two quests and adding hops onto your farming runs. If youre farming ranarrs you can potentially make 200-250k a run which is a bond in 3 or 4 days with the minimum amount of teleports on diary items.

---
&gt;&gt;That'd just make another point of entry for hijackers. With the rest of the current implementation it would make users security weaker.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;How would adding a secondary email make security weaker? The point of it is by adding an email you never use for anything else besides it being the backup email for your RuneScape account. If you need to reset anything account related and you lost access to your primary email, then you can send those to your secondary. It's the same system Google implements along with other added security that you can optionally enable. Not that I'm comparing Jagex and Google's security measures in the slightest but we can't just sit here and complain about the current system with no ideas on how to fix it.
---
Because for some reason RuneScape players put more responsibility on jagex than they do Google for security of their accounts. Imagine you're a hijacker, rather than one target for hijacking emails you have two emails you can target. The RuneScape account is now twice as insecure. 
---
Just because the point is it's only used for a RuneScape account doesn't mean it is. Can't someone do that with the primary account now?
---
&gt;&gt;The problem is then exacerbated by people like yourself who just assume the system is crap and spin a worse picture with assumptions.
---
&gt;I've always thought the system was good. I came into this thread with the mindset that the system was good and it was OP who messed up with having an unsecured account and made it too easy for hackers to get in. I can see that I have zero idea on how the new system works and I'll have to look through it to decide for myself.
---
I mean the first comment I replied to implied you thought you could just tell jagex you lost access and they'd email a new email address with a link to change a password as a hijacker without any identity verification.

It's an ongoing issue with World 34 Castlewars aKa "Theme." Some players solely log into the mini game to sabotage and/or flame bait, to see a reaction. There's just too much evidence to ignore.
---
Castle wars has had an active community since Pre-Eoc, therefore I hope to see J Mods step into the lobby, on active hours and address some of the said concerns. We're all adults here.. If someone talks trash to you or your friends, you're bound to defend or retaliate. To say the least, A little banter is fine but said person(s) has been continuously targeting players.

It's kinda sad that people won't even try pking because they resent pkers so much.

They are? Idk after this latest roll back... I don‚Äôt really believe they can track all this. Seem pretty incompetent at backing up character profiles and when items get traded.

So I know the world pop limit is 2000 - is there any way to increase it for certain world's, or would that destabilize them? I understand you want less people to compete with for stuff, but just theoretically - could we increase world pop caps and still have a stable server?

Pretty much. By the time you can enter the guild, you can usually go right for Rune, maybe even Dragon. But unless the guild had lower reqs that won't change. Perhaps access to the Cyclopses could have the req instead. Like 130 combined for Dragon, 120 combined for Rune, 110 for Adamant, 100 for Mithril, 90 for Black, 80 for Steel, 70 for Iron, and 60 for Bronze/Guild. The food shop and potion shop could also be gated behind a level so that isn't easy to access; aside from that, not much in the guild would be a problem to have earlier on.

if you already have void it's worth bringing to cut down on inventory slots and it has at least some defensive bonuses. with 75 def it's probably enough to tank the cannon fodder in the tunnels. defensive bonuses mostly don't matter vs the brothers since you're either protecting from or safe spotting them, or in the case of verac, the hits that do go through prayer also ignore defensive bonuses.
---
plus it does help kill the brothers slightly quicker. people bring melee gear to save slots because they'll use melee for tunnel kill count, but void saves slots too and doesn't hurt magic accuracy. yes 5 brothers do have low magic defence but you can't deny that going from ~70% chance to hit in melee gear to ~90-95% results in faster kills.  
---
it's also lighter than bringing several types of gear which can make a difference sometimes in the tunnels or multiple run trips before restoring if you get an unlucky middle room that requires you to go all the way around to get to the door.  
---
even with your higher melee stats, an msb (i) with rune arrows comes out slightly ahead of whip + torture + b ring (i) + fire cape  + avernic + prims (both setups using void). that's how much better it is to use range over melee on ahrim due to his 0 ranged defence. plus you'll save a bit of time on training ranged in the future.

Looking closely at the picture, I'm pretty sure the HC wasn't in OP's clan. You can see, if you zoom in, someone with identical gear sitting next to a marked tile - likely the one the HC was on when he died. I can't quite tell but I'm fairly sure that isn't a death animation the person is in. Plus, there's another one in the cc (also with a blocked name) towards the bottom of the screenshot. All three are skulled as well, and the HC wouldn't have skulled when he got jumped.

Tldr; I'm pretty sure OP was just group PKing and the name is one of his clan members pking with him.

not really, no. by just doing elites you have a 1/5 chance of getting a master so by doing the elites outright they sorta give you the value of 1.2 elites. if you trade them in you only get 1 elite of value out of them though.

Its 63% chance of at least one. That includes people who get more than one. On aberage you get one drop per n kills if the rate is 1/n
---
Why you still wearing rune though?
---
Oh, and that's why I posed the question. Thanks
---
1440p on a 27" screen makes fixed RS incredibly tiny to the point that it's unfun to play. 
---
Plot twist: The dust devil posted this.
---
Pretty sure you cant get assigned them without Bone Voyage?
---
&gt; Cons: -Literally none that I can think of. 
---
They literally make less money overall. Think of the people like you who might wanna get back into the game or play for a bit, but cant sell their shit for a bond, they instead buy one with $. Though it would be very nice and I do also wish it was a thing to sell members items as f2p, it is objectively bad business wise.
---
I'm currently in the middle east for work and am looking to get back into the game. What server does everyone reccomend I play on? I was thinking German. but I just wanted to be sure? Are all the German servers in the same location or would any give me better ping. 
---
Thanks!
---
P.S. I also logged in yesterday to find myself staring at an inventory of rune essence and I instantly remembered why I took a break in the first place.
---
Make sure you put the /s at the end or you gonna get downvoted to hell lmao
---
I was probably lucky for all this time then, who knows.
---
Tomorrow on phishing channels: !cape - I'm quitting RuneScape 
---
God I remember seeing you and felt bad you hadn't gotten it yet..CONGRATS!
---
It‚Äôs obvious from this pic that the green dot guy with star is not the hcim who was killed. Two friends just killed the hcim and OP blacked out his friends name
---
if its spam alching thats fucking you up, consider remapping left click to a key like spacebar with AHK or a program like razer synapse.
---
What I did on my thieving grind of spam clicking constantly was: I got a wireless mouse and just taped over the sensor and used my actual mouse to move the cursor when I needed to and spam clicked with the wireless one. Switching hands and fingers to click etc.
---
Hello from Benis Hammer, sorry for ruining the integrity of your account
---
Nice I‚Äôm too much of a bitch to even try one on a maxed main
---
This pisses me off because 
---
1) it took me 480 kc to get full Pyro
---
2) I didn‚Äôt get one pet let alone two
---
Vertical mouse
---
Challenges\*
---
What did mammal get to before prims? 2k+? All I can say is, good luck buddy!
---
Oh no that's so much worse I'm so sorry
---
What does changing your password so frequently do? I‚Äôm guessing it would be beneficial if one of your old passwords was leaked, but if you frequently update your password, the leak doesn‚Äôt give any valuable information.
---
Looks a whole lot better than the unseasoned shit I see on Snapchat lol
---
I was thinking this same thing the other day. Even though I'll probably never get a Jad pet or Inferno Cape I fully support this
---
Jagex hire this man
---
I too got ranger tunic on 3rd elite :o

Just want to give a big ~~shoutout~~ fuck you to Dave who didn't split the ely last weekend. Dave you said you were going for a toilet break. 
---
Yup
---
Haha hey looks guys this person really expects special privilege just because he spent a lot of time on his account. See how dumb he is risking everything. 
---
Oh, cool! Wasn't too familiar with that feature, sorry.
---
2008 Jad looks weird. Like some sort of Eldritch Horror
---
r/nothingeverhappens 
---
Oh he's stupid for risking it but this guy then bragging about how he ruined someone's day is just stupid.
---
That's over 8 hours per day. 3000/365 = 8.2
---
Killing a HCIM in the wild is on par with getting a pet imo. I don't PvP but I would love to have that achievement. 
---
fair call
---
Doubt it will not because of it being fair or not but because "engine work" to fix it
---
Hahahahaaahahaahaha
---
Farm pet with 496,287 herblore xp? Lucky. 
---
Wait so he has died another time?
---
Meh maybe. I'd be pretty excited as well. It's crazy he found 2 in 2 days.
---
The people who set these up have the whole system automated - Twitch (usually) does ban them pretty fast after they're reported, but they pop back up again just as fast.
---
Not much Twitch can do without restricting the category somehow.
---
How do you plan to explain this to people irl
---
Sounds like you need to move out of the sewers of this community 
---
Needs to be rotated several degrees for sure.
---
Why the fuck does Reddit care so much about self promotion?? For a site dedicated to consuming other people's content it's insane how much the average redditor hates people posting their own stuff.
---
Thats fine, but the marks shoudn't be tradable! Otherwise, a good idea.
---
Okay but 99 isn't the only thing that matters. Players get dragon armour and abyssal whips while hardly playing the game. Combat is one of the few skills you need to pay attention to and players can't even do that! I mean it is the definition of easyscape. 
---
shoulder deep with a spiny helmet that devil has commitment

Not entirely sure, as it's private..

It is mobile formatting for me using Chrome on an S8. I haven't set any preference so that was the default for me.

Really cool! I have one that I'm on and off working on and would love to see how she made the Ancient staff.

Where‚Äôs Marv when you need him
---
TY guys, what are the odds of getting a pet from the fruit stall?
---
What about Kourend? Theres a bank almost every 100 square blocks. and thats one of Jagex's newest additions to the world map.
---
who?!?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt trust anyone without lootshare. I remember doing KQ in 07 and we got a D Chain as a 3 man. I was ecstatic. Fucker that got it took it and logged off. It was 5M splits. Then I die and lose my V Helm next trip. (2.7M at the time)

What's your beef with letting people AFK train out in various areas of the wilderness? I could understand if they were in more populated/central areas, but you've specifically got to go out of your way to get to them. 
---
Loot on PvP worlds
---
Big ~~shoutout~~ fuck you to Dave who didn't split the arcane last weekend. Mate you said you were going for a toilet break, pretty sure that doesn't take one week.
---
Because twitch wont do anything
---
Your quickest way with what I‚Äôm assuming are low leveled stats would be to make cannonballs. 
---
Do the dwarfcannon quest and start smithing!
---
Bro, i worked at domino‚Äôs i WILL NOT put anything anchovy in my car, even in a sealed bag. It fucking leaves a horrid stench in the car.

Not as good as my 99 thieve without beaver
---
No problem happy cake day
---
Or literally any place that isn't the US lmao
---
If you ever think a spelling is the 'british way', just assume its actually the correct way and the US way is just Americans not being able to spell back in the day.
---
Gz, hope you enjoy your discovery because I don't.

Unpopular opinion I never found this meme funny 
---
No it's not not let this bad meme die ty

Ty

I have void mage helm, fury, trident, book of darkness &amp; seers on that you can‚Äôt see.

Trident + book -&gt; all melee brothers
---
Blowpipe + avas -&gt; ahrims
---
Whip + ddef + dds -&gt; karils + tunnels
---
if they have over 100 bot points they should let us attack them
---
Not unpopular, just no one cares.
---
Only until he dies legitimately I believe he said
---
88% is all you need, which is all brothers and 3 skelebois
---
88% is the ideal level for profit, as after that you can get bolts, which aren't worth nearly as much as runes 
---
idk. am i?
---
Support
---
Jagex doesn‚Äôt care. There is literally one of these people on every world doing this. 
---
However, you have posted it in the correct place to get a mods attention since they use this website for cust support. So upvoted for visi 
---
To you it's not important
---
This will help other people to avoid this kind of scam, there are new players and returning players still getting scammed and if we can tell them what the scams are then they know how to avoid it
---
Not taking to strangers isn't really good advice. There are plenty of genuine and kind people on runescape, some of them I've made as lifelong friends, there have been people that have got married irl through playing runescape together so avoiding strangers all together isn't really they way to go
---
People just need to know and understand these scams and how they work 
---
Before Christmas they said that they would look into it after Christmas but that we shouldnt expect it very soon. 
---
They also said that its more complicated than we think.
---
Make of that what you will.
---
Why say "ty," you like being a dickhead?
---
support
---
It‚Äôs negligibly less afk, and imo way worth the investment.  You practically double your xp per hour with hardly any more input.  I still hit the logout timer somewhat often without killing anything.

passed a poll already

I remember devs saying on a Q&amp;A somewhere that reintroducing these old quests would just use dev time that they would prefer to use making new quest sequels with brand new lore and rewards like MM2, DS2, and now Song of the Elves as examples. Which is a shame, but if the trade-off is redesigning and remaking old quests like Summer's End or to have brand new ones, I certainly prefer the latter.
---
hey, ive done 1800+ med clues.. 5 ranger, 6 sandals, 6 wizard boots. last rangers clue #814.. im curently over 1000+ meds dry from my last pair. im outbuying your offer. buying rope, 500k!
---
Honestly sell it, you'll forget you have it when you have a nicely set up house. 
---
holy fuck its retardspasxx4202004 didnt you start the restricting an iron man to certain zones autistically?
---
I remember how we trapped this motherfucker in there on rs2
---
rather have autism than shit taste in pizza
---
You can smash crabs in raids with it too, straight slap it 1 handed. I forgot dwh once and it shocked me when I was told that.
---
Is using auto clicker considered botting? 
---
Kill it with fire pls 
---
I know it can feel like that and yes, you're right that there are these kinds of people on every world
---
Thank you for the upvote and for understanding why i came to reddit with this
---
Another reason I wanted to explain how it worked was so people that don't know about scams or people that may be new to the game so they can understand what to avoid. Even if it's just one player this post helps then that's a really positive thing.
---
What people forget is there are thousands of new players every day, some never have played a game like this so just because we know about the scams doesn't mean they will too 
---
meh. racheal from burthorpe game room is better
---
Didnt they get demonotized and now they arent piggybacking off of streamers clips?
---
The drums are giving me an aneurysm
---
sand crabs are just more rock crabs and if rock crabs didn't exist people would just find the next low def high hp mob like yaks or experiments or whatever
---
I just wish you could herald different items outside of the few you can. 
---
Like more shields and armors and stuff.
---
bonds are a commodity though.  if nobody wants them, they aren't worth anything.  you can be rich as hell but you sure ain't selling bonds for a stack of tbows.  bond prices would crash to 50k before that happened.  they don't generate gold either (in fact, they remove gold from the game due to their conversion fee).  they're called bonds for a reason, it's not some hot term jagex decided to call them.  
---
Yes
---
How do you force randoms?
---
I would say using sarcasm in the form he used it defeats the whole purpose. noone is laughing at his comment, just cringing

Why d boots

No olive oil spread? Your chicken will dry out ):

Thanks mate. I think ill stay with Konar.

If Personal Blocklist works for you then use that instead. But its no longer being developed so it just stops working for some newer chrome updates
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest I‚Äôm such a noob and I don‚Äôt even know what poh is or what 1K Zulrah is, lol.
---
I just started playing the game and didn't get any friend. Though the pic still hit me.
---
I didn‚Äôt know this was possible 
---
Ah, well then sorry
---
Y 15 prayer?
---
It doesn't because you can't cast low/high alchemy from the spellbook with it
---
1000 zulrah kills
---
I'm calling the cops, Jared
---
50/50, you get it or you dont

Just trying to make no prayer zerk on mobile for shits n gigs. Its been a fun ride.
---
People like you suck. 
---
The 2100 flair got me ü§£
---
and for pk
---
He talks about it in one of his videos but something about "click intensive" tasks increases odds of getting randoms.  Also they think leaving ToB also increases the odds for some reason
---
Unpopar opinonin BTW
---
Have to pay the troll toll
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **5th Cakeday** xanplease! ^(hug)

Yeah but like what‚Äôs the point of that? Like to make money I guess?

I hate dust devils. They look like the scolex of a tapeworm. And the fact that you made this makes it even more disgusting to think about; I love this post.

What lvl would you recommend doing this?
---
then stop hanging out around him
---
Max combat opens so many money making doors! We should go bandos or sara sometime
---
Get upper level unlock first then prospectors trust me. Can probably do both by 72
---
Good day to everyone except the op
---
Naw I'd just straight up quit. 
---
Bandos isn‚Äôt 
---
wont you get something to eat?
---
Same resolution and screen size here, it's fine, in fact it's great because you can have 2 runelite clients on one half of the screen and an internet browser open on the other for YouTube etc.
---
700 dry btw
---
PoH = Player-Owned House. He's saying you should sell the eternal glory and use the money to train Construction. Having the Ornate Rejuvenation Pool in your house is one of the most convenient things to have for killing bosses because it's a one-click heal, special attack restore, poison cure, prayer point restore, and run energy restore. Additionally, the Achievement Gallery room in a PoH has a jewellery box that, when fully upgraded, contains teleports for Games Necklace, Ring of Dueling, Skills Necklace, Combat Bracelet, Ring of Wealth, and Amulet of Glory. So basically, if you sell the eternal glory you can use the money for things that are a lot more useful than an eternal glory.  
---
If you are ever confused about something in-game, visit [os.rs.wiki](https://os.rs.wiki) and type in whatever item you would like to know about.

This suggestion was addressed on the last dev q&amp;a. It was the third-to-last question.

https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/avjf75/old_school_developer_qa_transcript_27022019/

They seemed to like the idea, but didn't confirm if they would be implementing it any time soon.
---
I got it wrong, it's "rs2 pleasant" not pleasure, my bad!

Evidence of someone not splitting? How would you go about that? Take a picture of a bank that doesn't have 200m in it? Lol
---
I'm pretty sure you don't even need to wait that tick

Last I heard was them saying they‚Äôll keep the chat box closed. If you logged out and then back in, the chat box would be shut. I‚Äôve never heard them say anything about changing the area to tap to bring up the keyboard

No retard. there is literally a chat filter option to filter out auto texts. 
---
&gt;some of these individuals make decent $ recovering accs
---
how do you avoid becoming a target for this kind of thing and what should you watch out for? is your username used to find personal details on the web or is it more about interacting with a target to get information?  should I changed my username to avoid leading to other accounts and personal information?
---
maybe I'm too paranoid about this kind of thing
---
Dh is only better at like 92 hp

You okay?

What's your combat level?

Grats! Just gotta get the kq head now!
---
Not our primary focus but we almost always have something going on our discord has 600+ so you can find someone almost always.

If the person scamming you ignores the mods on discord and blocks you and names changes it‚Äôs pretty fucking obvious you brainlet

No that needs lost city, right?

What‚Äôs her insta? üòç

*I hear you Brother!*

But just do monkey madness for the scim 
---
Dragon Sword
---
Loot split was just adding pure gold into the game, please no 
---
Yes the long sword requires Lost City. 
---
Dragon sword. And with them dropping off wyrms they‚Äôre really cheap right now. And also the dragon long sword 
---
I'm not sure if this is a troll or not but never train defence on a zerker. Quest till bgloves and you should get nearly 45 def
---
Not to suck runelite‚Äôs dick, but I would download runelite and play that way. It‚Äôs seriously made the game so fun to play with all of its features 
---
Spear
---
any good programs that move a window in front of osrs so i can watch youtube or something? not sure if any are bannable or just bad programs
---
Totally forgot about that lol good reminder
---
Longsword requires Lost City
---
Yikes
---
No. Last time I checked "NMZ normie men" weren't forced to obtain everything they own via combat or no-xp-gain methods
---
Never really liked the teleport in and out style of bossing. 
---
Just modify Summer's End to remove Summoning.
---
Or reintroduce Summoning but remove Beasts of Burden.
---
Holy fuck all these kc:1 what's going on

I doubt many people get hacked from phishing links, IMO e-mail leakages are the biggest cause of hacks.

You sound upset

Rofl

I do it for you! 
---
It's an automatic filter implemented on Jagex's side. Did you actually read the suggestion? 
---
This
---
Well wiki is wrong then it says non quest item
---
Educate yourself on account security and this won‚Äôt happen again. 
---
Why would we have an option for a bank pin if Authenticator is all we need for a secure account? 
---
or when you're bad like me. Pain's a strong motivator tho
---
That was goldshare. Lootshare turns the items into 120 shards, which are split between the tea
---
Why shouldnt you keep it? I mean Blue elysians turn into blue audis I'd take that deal
---
The parameter for "Quest item" in the infobox indicates its use in a quest, not whether it requires a quest to use.
---
Took about 3 hours
---
Didn‚Äôt blur out run energy though
---
Please don't stop. 
---
Yeah
---
I love it
---
they're gonna run out of names soon enough though.. right?
---
You could make your window smaller and have a browser open up on the side, or get a second monitor.
---
Ah, my bad
---
Dragon 2h and drag spear
---
reg voi nub :)!
---
They're both spastic af, checks out

Email got hacked and that means they can disable authenticator, yes, it is stupid like that.

Thank you so much

Can i add you to pk? I‚Äôm pretty noob but I‚Äôm learning!

Would require grinding favor for spellbook + cut xp rates at least in half, not worth it. In the time it would take for favor alone I could have grinded out enough money for 77 prayer with some extra

Who wouldn‚Äôt want to wear that in public runescape is cool right?

Thats so cool!

So u searching for men on tinder?

I dont pk sorry

When i was a noob back when corp was released i think i one tried to enter a cavern near mortania and it said i needed (the death rune quest cant remember the name now) to enter and i believed this was some kind of grand master quest that unlocked corp. I always just imagined there was no way it wouldnt have some awesome law behind it... sad rlly
---
1000% yes! That's what I was trying to get at :) if the user doesn't take their account security seriously and shares their account, it's not jagex's responsibility to act as shield for them.
---
For sure there are improvements jagex could make, but there are in every security system.
---
Just do quests. You‚Äôre gonna have to do them anyway.

Slayermusiq fucked me up on this quest he gets east and west confused all the time lmao
---
What‚Äôs your rsn? 
---
Yeah I agree. It didn't really address it properly. At least they said that they know about the issue.
---
Actually that's pretty likely and I hadn considered it cause I can't see a player model in the space where there should be one if it's not in a death animation.
---
50% of the time I don‚Äôt get them every time.

Yoooo the mbed lpc1768? I worked with that too in a class, made an internet weather app + clock. Cool to see it here, nice!

Shit..

Nice! Thanks 
---
i have never ever contacted jagex about anything i got along with my business, never scammed, never got reported, have a ban for botting but thats because of the 1st time my account got hacked and jagex saw this and unbanned me from a perma. This tells me that they can do something aslong as they are certain that what the player says is true. All im asking for is one exception and i will literally put on 100 layers of security. I will have a key in my back yard that opens a room which contains an internet space only known to me with an e-mail and 100 clues scattered around my walls which hint towards my password with 3 authenticators spread across 3 phones and i will add a bank pin. All i want is my stuff back and its happy days for me. I just wanna do raids and its hard with no money or gear. Jagex please, if you're reading this rs is the only game i enjoy nowadays and i dont want to quit but the grind is just too much. :(
---
Plot twist your real name is hcim isn't it?

Unstable internet connections requires the strongest of sacrifices

It actually is, see my last post about Idasfar

because osrs players will do anything for another spade. phishing links included.

This is very relatable

No it works on both of your preferences. OP will only see Mod Wolf because OP has his preference set to include men, as does Wolf.

If you're doing this for better karil droprate and not some weird challenge, you're doing it wrong. Youre better off killing all brothers. Even with their stuff added to the droptable, you're more likely to get specific pieces you want

---
OSRS has well established avenues for RWT of both the in game gold, as well as the accounts themselves because of the sheer amount of time commitment they can take.

Also the size of OSRS on twitch makes these easy to viewbot without being instantly banned apparently

How did you get hacked?

I was under the impression that goldshare dropped the item into GE and sold to highest existing offer, then dropped the money

Had 5 prims all other drops untill I got my pegs at 1373 kc, I feel the pain
---
Really gonna try not to sound too elitist here, 6 jads alone is not really all that difficult, imo 6 jads should be a wave in kierans challenge mode inferno the only problem is the challenge has been diluted by the infinite practice available right now as opposed to after you go through 68 waves but considering you'd have to do it flawlessly to conserve supplies for the zuk fight it would be interesting to see. And guaranteed drops aren't really imo as interesting as chance drops, it would be interesting to see similar to Cox cm a chance at rolling the dice if you complete cm inferno in X time as inferno is one of the most interesting pieces of speed run content in the game. Guaranteed drops on 1kc remove any grind aspect from it
---
Thank you so much!

Interesting. The wiki says the gp/hr is down since kebos, but this is higher.

Fair enough, I say early to mid 30's to be completely independent financially, late 20's is still hard in some places to afford that

I clicked on a OSRS mobile beta signup through facebook. (genuinely thought Jagex would have control over their games on facebook, the biggest site in the world)

Low alch yourself, wouldve been high alch but you get points knocked off for your out of date kq setup. At least you never have to go back.

Even if it gets patched, I've found a method to do 5:0 27 tick cycles WITHOUT using the red cross bug. It does rely on flinching, but doubt they'll change flinching mechancs.

if you're 30 and haven't bought a house just end it tbh

I think for both but not sure. You can also just buy a sapling.

adding on to the above, you can also just search osrs.wiki/[search term] so you dont even have to go through google
---
What's so funny?
---
I mean...it‚Äôs locked behind pretty high stat and gear requirements, you don‚Äôt see level 80cb dudes running in there and slaying Corp all day. You either need a group of mains with multiple expensive spec weapons and Zammy spears OR an Ironman with an extremely rare DWH, BGS, and Z Spear who also sunk 25ish million gold into a POH AND has high enough herb lore for all the potions for the top tier pool.

This reminds me of when me and some randoms got an ags drop early gwd days. Shit was like 70m back then. The guy who got the loot logged on us. Another guy had his ip from teamviewer though and he booted him off a few weeks later in pvp for 200m.
---
I‚Äôd like to see a quest that maybe involves all of the wilderness bosses and their stories and how they came to be in the wilderness. Include Corp in that with a quest different from original to keep the 07 feel
---
Sounds unlucky af. If its a bug, it was introduced in the last patch, i got my quest cape a bit longer than a week ago
---
&lt;3
---
This is getting out of hand
---
It‚Äôs stupid to live in fear for things that barely anyone would use against random people. I never heard of it, there are others like me. Only paranoid people or people with a well organised and strictly updated system (for a game) would make use of such a thing. Auditing a pro but it‚Äôs a game lol

Also something to consider is the Bottomless compost bucket, which halves the need for Compost.

For about ‚Ç¨1200 you can put a pc together that is more than powerful enough to play and stream OSRS (probably even most games nowadays but the high demanding ones not on ultra settings).

For parts needed to build such a pc I cant help you. A friend of mine built my pc for this budget (buying parts and putting them together himself) .

I agree, but now that he's aware its my irl address he's going to keep doing it. Unfortunate position i've put myself in which is why i'm trying to at least get him some punishment for his actions so that he will think twice.
---
I'm not sure how this other guy is playing, but at 101 Combat I can easily make about 2m in a couple hours playtime each time doing slayer (80/80/79/81) with 76 Slayer and Herb Runs. It does pick up a lot and bonds are very sustainable. I spent about 5m on supplies for 70 Con and Herb last weekend and I've already remade it + more.
---
yeah considering contacting the forces.
---
Right? Like my eyes are 5 inches from the screen. Like chill juugflex!

I thought so too, I didn't react for a few days but he didn't stop. He has an army of cronies who think he's hilarious so he won't stop man :(

Lmfaoooooo so good

with 3.5m you can buy a viable set up for most things, i mean a whip is roughly 3 min so probably can't get that yet or you'll be broke.

nezzy helm - fremmy isles quest
---
glory
---
fighter torso (free) - but have to suffer through barb assault
---
dragon legs only like 160k
---
dragon boots around 400k
---
d scim 60k (monkey madness)
---
d defender (free) just do warriors guild shit
---
gloves - work towards barrows gloves (recipe for disaster quest)
---
the above is very affordable and decent until you get more $$
---
Once you get membership u can make tons of money. U can do alot of bosses at 100 combat just get the basic things as everyone mentioned. Netiz helm torso whip dragon def  etc etc. there are more than a 100 ways u can make bank super early levels. Wildy slayer is a good money makes as well.
---
the only reason not to do animal mangnetism is when you dont want to do the prequests that give prayer exp
---
C. a pussy
---
First of all, full dragon is a waste. 83M is only if you buy stupid shit like the full helm and platebody. In reality, you'll only need to spend about 500K on Dragon Gear, and then you'll fill in the other items with Barrows gear or other members items.
---
Once you get high enough stats, the basic mems set up for something like Melee (Nezzy, Glory, Fighter Torso/Torags Body, Torags Legs, D Boots, Whip, Dragon Defender) will get you through most things until you start hitting the big bucks, then you can move into upgrading your gear.
---
Niceeee, thank you!
---
[Gear and inventory setup](https://i.imgur.com/RTy20hB.png), at the start it was; 
---
* 2 pineapple pizzas
---
* 5 baskets of strawbwerries
---
* 1 3 dose ranging pot
---
* 20 4 dose ppots
---
[Levels](https://i.imgur.com/aEeYWrh.png), definitely a bit overkill but last time I did it was with a blowpipe so I wanted to make sure I could do it in one try.
---
I would never joke about those bottom feeder scum
---
Getting this gear set-up would unlock a lot of content that you encounter progressively building up, so i would't agree with your hypothetical point. I would recommend starting slayer, as you have a decent combat level already you should get 40-50 relatively quickly, earn money, and the increase in content difficulty is introduced to you slowly until you ready to kill bosses.

Why did you bring 200k when you were going to green dragons?

For BA collector, is points the received based on how many eggs you pick up, or loading into the hopper or only received if you shoot the eggs?

Hello, I am an HCIM skiller currently doing 77-99 RC.  I have a question to the knowledgeable peoples of the community.  What do I do with my runes that I do not use for bonds (via drop trading to my main?)  The Ali store is unfortunately locked to me, as I have no way to procure rings of recoil for The Feud.

See, there‚Äôs your problem.... you‚Äôre retarded enough to base your argument off of people‚Äôs laziness.... who the fuck just hangs out in the wildy with a few hundred k worth of emblems? Certainly not the guys in just slayer helms with d scims, so idk why you‚Äôd say that
---
Okay, so gear is mostly just affordable until you're big enough that it doesn't matter anymore? 
---
I was under the impression that by the time you're big enough to use it, you're supposed to be using full dragon or third age and other flashy shit.
---
If you don't have any money on you it just takes it from your bank, unfortunately.

There's a difference between a harmless troll and someone trying to actual ruin your real life
---
Yes harmless trolls just spamming cancer, ignore them move on with your day
---
Someone with your information, spreading it around and potentially causing a lot of damage to your life, putting your own security at risk, is something that can completely ruin someone's life. It's also illegal to dox people. 
---
There's a massive difference between a harmless troll and what is happening here. And you are part of the problem if you can't see that.

I think dhcb doesnt have enough range to hit the portal on rapid you would need an acb.

But however when overloaded its better to use trident on the vespula portal.

You want to stop playing because someone THREATENED (yes, it hasn't happened, it's a THREAT) to order pizza to your house?

Im sorry and but what did you do to piss him off or did his mom just drop him on a rock when he was a kid?

Uh, sure. If you're doing top tier PvM. Vast majority if you asked has no clue what runewatch is. 
---
I just wanna know how many tries it took. Makes the task go by fast I bet

Yeah I was thinking that too. I don't think an individuals home address should be considered publicly available information, and you could be liable for the consequences if you spread it with malicious intent.

owh yeah totaly read that as just 1 hour. let me redo some of the math and edit my comment
---
One of the guys on the ground floor of Varrock museum.
---
Assuming you bought a bond for 3.5m, you would have to make 250k every day over the course of 14 days, to sustain your membership. That's super easy to do.   
---
Your main goal after getting a bond should be to level up your combat stats. It's way easier to make money at higher levels. Slayer will probably be the most beneficial to you at your level, especially if you use Konar as your Slayer master. Even just one brimstone key could potentially cover the 250k.  
---
You could also do barrows brothers pretty well if you have around 50 magic.   
---
World 330 is your friend. People host their houses for others to use, and they have teleports to pretty much everywhere which makes it easy to get around.  
---
TL;DR:   
---
Get a bond. Money is easy to make as a member. Just make 250k at least every day so you can afford another bond.   
---
Honestly people who do that, think it's funny and think they can get away with it deserve to spend at least one night in jail to know their actions do have consequences. 
---
Right?? I was thinking the same thing just the other day
---
Your parents only met once and money exchanged hands.

I'm sorry buddy, that's awful.

I didn't think I gave it out. I was showing off my extensive  CD collection on instagram to my friend, wasn't even talking to these trolls. Next thing I know is they have my IRL name (which wasnt my ig name idk how they got it) and have searched me up in the white pages and found my address (uncommon last name).

A LOT different. Only thing 2007 is the graphics, the rest is 2019.

Its called osrs now, and jagex still doesnt hide passwords when you type it into chat, it just turns up as stars. ********
---
Definitely. I hope we run into as many as possible hehe
---
You might be right man, I'll have to do my own research and look into it.
---
Will do when I get home from work!
---
I got a problem with your methods
---
I guess that's true but if they didn't actually do anything other than order me pizza can I really report it??
---
Have you tried turning it on and off again?
---
Huh I guess mispelling internet lingo makes me a weeb, you're right desu~~~~ (and I didn't even use that word, I quoted someone, but that's just retarded lol).
---
Secondly it wasn't widely available and OP never intended to disclose this information to anyone. He linked a picture on his instagram (iirc, OP deleted his previous post where he said this), after which somebody went through great lengths to dig up his details and figure out his home adres. It's not like he googled for a companies address or something like that. Could he have prevented it? Sure, but that doesn't really change much. Toxic behaviour like this shouldn't be acceptable.
---
I thought it was since its available on the white pages which is publically listed. Obviously he should not be able to get it through a game but I still didn't think having my address is anything illegal.?
---
They only keep doing it cause  your giving them a reaction and they love it trust me on this . Ignore all of them and dont give out a reaction and they will leave u alone because its not fun anymore 
---
Brute forcing isn't a problem as you get locked out after a few incorrect tries
---
From what I can understand this is a 'long term scam'. The scammer hopes by giving the account you will transfer any wealth etc to it. They then keep an eye and will just hijack back the account as they have original recoveries and that to prove 100% ownership.
---
Personally I would just leave it be, no point playing a game to have someone of played majority of the content for you. Happy scaping!

Just flip the chat bar to the top of the screen, that's it

well i agree. i was a bit miffed to hear that rigour and augury would be introduced as a rare drop from raids. my point is that the price is high for a reason and that the price is totally justified imo. i paid 111m for rigour and i don't regret paying that much despite it being a large chunk of my bank; it was worth it to get rigour asap because it's just that good of a prayer. you should try it.

Did you click a link from twitch stream

What are some of the differences? Quest wise? skill wise? ETC?
---
Lmao rip
---
I usually blink, it keeps them from hurting lol
---
No but honestly it‚Äôs really dependent on what I‚Äôm doing, click intensive thinks that require precision is what usually gets me. That‚Äôs when I stare majority of the times, ie (blackjacking, tithe farm, cleaning herbs, etc) so I can only do that for about an hr at a time. Everything else I usually click then look away at my actual surroundings, and just glance at my phone. Ie (combat, walking around rs, everything in majority of the skills. Clicking and waiting). So I alleviate eye strain by that. Also I catch myself getting closer and closer to my phone when I pk or do boss fights and I have to make a conscious effort to extend my arms again and look away.

Thanks man

---
Yes.. But people who pk would never make a 46-47-46 build.. They would keep 40 att and 40 def. So yea then 40-57-40 and 49 hp would be the same combat. But 57 str is so low to do damage with and 49 hp is low to pk with, so no one would make that acc as pker either.
---
Unless you are going for 200m xp
---
Must be a bait title. Wife's boyfriend -- wat. And apparently he either knew to screenshot the drop, or he knew how to lure and burst nechs. Poor attempt, OP. 
---
Turn off private for a few days.
---
He can keep making new accounts on different IP addresses? There's no way you could make him stop if you don't know who he is and if he uses throwaway OSRS accounts. Don't interact with the person, ignore and avoid him.
---
you quested all your defence right? 
---
I wonder how many times I've seen this meme
---
Yeah but once he‚Äôs punished for it if he wants to keep playing rs he‚Äôll probably stop otherwise another account could get banned. Either way he should be punished for what he‚Äôs doing with a mute at least.
---
i dont know because i use tbow but maybe in synqs raids guide its better explained 
---
You know what this person wants? Attention. And OP is giving him it. What do you think OP should do then? The person could keep making new accounts on different IPs and stay anonymous. No way for Jagex to get rid of him. Same thing as the spammers in GE.
---
I always have private on friends and he‚Äôs not added trust me
---
Wow that‚Äôs crazy ty. But still this would be nice. Doesn‚Äôt have to stay could be a toggle if you want to show drops like this or not. Set to 10 seconds after then kill then goes away or something

So presumably in RS3 you can pay for XP lamps? Didn‚Äôt know that. Tried RS3 once and hated it.

I guess it would devalue the OSRS accounts that already had high levels and annoy those who had already taken a lot of time to get those levels.

Alright rap God. Keep going
---
Oooo look at me I‚Äôm an iron man
---
You don't understand me. This person could keep making new F2P accounts (takes a few minutes) and join CC's to spam your information. He can keep doing this on different IP addresses, so the actual accounts he plays OSRS on won't get punished. 
---
Yes, he should be muted, but he can continue on a new account. Look at the GE spammers. This person wants attention, so I'd suggest avoiding him, stop making reddit posts about him, don't join cc's where he's at and he'll stop eventually.
---
I specifically said for mobile bc it‚Äôs either spam my chat or manually check drops. I don‚Äôt always play on pc gamer

Only have to complete it, not as a reward from it.  He reiterates it on another reply, this should be a transmog option from the inferno, and have nothing to do with the standard cave.

OSRS is a big grinder game and people take pride in their highly sought after stats. I get where you‚Äôre coming from tho. In today‚Äôs gaming market it probably does seem really strange that a game like this doesn‚Äôt offer mtx like buyable stats.

Giving out personal details may affect the security of a player's account as well as a player's own personal safety.

Personal details

Personal details are considered to include full name, email addresses, instant messenger screen names/contact details, telephone numbers, a player's home/school address or age."

Taken from the Runescape Rules.
---
Honestly don't get all the comments asking what jagex should do?
---
How about enforce there rules?
---
There are even laws that state you cannot leak someones private information.
---
So this guy is not only breaking runescape's rules but also the law.
---
Honestly think both jagex and the police should take action.
---
However this is gonna be headache of a case i'd reckon so good luck :(
---
Why are you using super combats instead of Overloads/Absorptions? Just curious in case I'm missing something about how NMZ works. 
---
Fair enough, I‚Äôll give it a go. Might just take a break from rs for a week or so. Thanks for the advice man
---
I just use a lot of sharks. I mostly solo, even with my 86 hp I almost never run out of sharks. It's not really difficult, only information I can give really is that I use sharks and that I fletch the logs.
---
Yeah, another reason not to make them tradeable! :D Not being a pker I havent' even thought about that - but surely you are correct.
---
I'm just hoping that guy runs out of chicks to draw. 
---
copy
---
Yeah he‚Äôs mentioned it a few times but mostly does it on his alt. Either way, jagex have IPs and can see that it‚Äôs the same person and something like this is probably considered by them to be worth banning all accounts over.
---
Its ranarrs, avantoes and snaps atm
---
No u 
---
Probably could just inspect element on an actual one so you don‚Äôt need to edit anything
---
Summers end.
---
I think he's jealous of your semi-enlarged client. 
---
No that‚Äôs the issue, the report system doesn‚Äôt detect it as breaking the rules or an issue. There was a player mod called cinderizer who muted him a few times but pmod mutes only last 1 hour and jagex don‚Äôt seem to review them.
---
He was wearing a max cape 
---
It's not a f2p account, just tryna have some fun while i grind bonds
---
Where the link at üëÄ
---
Yeah indeed, easily filed 100+ reports on this guy myself for his behaviour and language and I‚Äôm sure others have reported him too..
---
Yeah I appreciate that. It‚Äôs just for those nostalgic players who are tying to balance the OSRS grind with work, study etc it can be difficult to achieve those max stats. 
---
Meat barrage
---
Not when you have to pay for them :(
---
Well said
---
A pmod muted me in 06 for calling him a nubcake lol
---
He doesn‚Äôt. Most of these screenshots are taken by my friends when I‚Äôm offline 
---
A loser amongst losers is still a loser.
---
I do 3 protected ranarr and 5 avantoes
---
If only there was a way around that shoots too bad
---
So I have another mute on this account because I called someone a nubit. 
---
But why? Worlds are insanely laggy once they‚Äôre at like 1500 players or so. See world 2 and 30 if you don‚Äôt believe me lol

You can buy cheap tabs from the ge that teleport you to various cities and other locations even if you don‚Äôt have the level requirement for the spell

Skills actually cap at level 3!

Hahaha hey man :). You kept your word!

I afk at work so I rock cake/super/absorb every 15-20 minutes. 6 Supers gives me a full 6 hours whereas overloads would have me checking every 5 minutes

13 hours a day afking = 1m xp/day üòé

Wildy altar is fastest and cheapest, even if you get pked. No reason to do anything else

Untrue the quest start is in the wilderness

Ouch. Rip.

Imagine it‚Äôs 2019 and we have usernames like Nieves Tits, where doxxers leak details in CC‚Äôs for weeks and one of your biggest pking clans DDos your servers and give them money for it.

This is some childish shit to post. Gf
---
Yikes.
---
Wait this is serious looooooooooooooool
---
What the actual fuck
---
Yep, they basicly have to filter genuine threats between thousands of bullshit cases. It's also very easy to perceive the entirety as not genuine if 90 percent is not genuine and not check the back log at all.
---
Reading all your comments makes me feel like you have basicly done everything in your might and there is not much more to do than just sit back and hope this all blows over soon.

As someone who‚Äôs done both, veteran pest control makes things so much better just because most of them know what they‚Äôre doing and camp out portals if not running to all of them.
---
Can‚Äôt remember 100% but the wiki gives an estimate on how long it takes to get full void via intermediate and via veteran. Veteran mode saves you approx 1,5 hours

But seriously, there are some very popular milestones that main accounts go after. I'll list some.
---
Fighter torso/Barrows gloves
---
Fire cape
---
Quest cape
---
Untrimmed skillcape (first 99)
---
All hard diaries
---
Trimmed skillcapes (multiple 99)
---
Diary cape (all elite diaries)
---
Max cape
---
They're in a somewhat logical order, but as if with anything on runescape, you make your own goals. If you love training a skill, do it early! If you are crazy about clue scrolls, you can try getting the special reward for each tier. Swap, skip and add objectives as you see fit.
---
I have the same screen specs and do the same. Runelite and youtube/netflix on left side, wiki on right
---
Jagex will not be able to assist you. You need to either remember the code or wait 3/7 days.
---
Last line? Does it imply that being a decent human being won‚Äôt get you into heaven, but believing in god does? 
---
Man, the amount of salt in this got me thirsty
---
Vorkath until I get the head. After that, probably finish up the last eight quests I've been slacking off on.
---
Quick! Teleport portal across the room!
---
Now acid walk!
---
So far I got to lvl 86, trout only
---
Just did that quest last night lol it was so cheesy
---
No you‚Äôre right, but the second anybody with a team sees a group of people there that have taken over the altar, they will bring their team and try to clean up shop because they know a few people would have loads of notes bones on them
---
Yeahhh I was never a big fan of the dwarf quest series
---
Actually he was full health. Does he regen?
---
See I know phishing quite well, and it doesn‚Äôt look like it. And it‚Äôs from an officially jagex email account. And it‚Äôs regarding the account that is linked to that email address. 
---
It just seemed like someone had tried to do a forgotten username/password with my email address. 
---
Thanks! :)
---
Fucking lol
---
defender and bandos.
---
Slightly slower average, less PB time potential, but with more consistent kill times versus DHCB. It has similar profit though due to lower upkeep cost.
---
Justiciar is good for rune dragon alts to make it very afk.
---
Only if it allows us to shred on a guitar.
---
Sorry I should have been more clear, I want to go p2p pk if there are viable options that from my current stats.  
---
I guess I need to read the quests and build guides better to understand.  
---
Does anyone have any preferences for G Maul? I see a lot of guides that vary significantly. 
---
Also the EU demon. And the fact that Saradomin would have a demon to begin with. 
---
He only does things that are underground or in caves
---
Read my name 
---
KBD? Cerb? Corp? Even revenants have a kc dude. Why shouldn't they or the kraken? So people can't flex on you for having 0 kc?
---
I instantly removed it when I saw that like a week ago.
---
Gz
---
Hopefully no one this time. I'm still salty over the loss of Bob, he was a classic fixture of the game and Jagex just killed him off in a cheap attempt to recreate the shock we felt when Duradel died in While Guthix Sleeps.
---
we need miniquest to kill the hosidius range guy
---
I'm same stats as you and I don't bring void melee helm + fcape. You don't need so many teletabs and you don't really need karambwans (only eat when under 33 hp). Just bring the home tab and build a Lunar Isle portal in your house. Also don't need a ring of dueling as well. I also like to super def pot at lunar isle bank.
---
This would devalue my earmuff only hardcore ironman.

Lmao that‚Äôs dope how old were you when you started playing?

---
no lol. more security is better than less. having birth year as bank pin isn't my reasoning for auth delay lmfao (if you have birth yr as auth delay its useless and that individual is p stupid). 
---
you do realize why people can get recovered 2-3 times in a row AFTER getting 2fa email &amp; 2fa everything, right? the same info that was on DB leaks can be used over and over again to hack someones account even after they have maximum security &amp; don't leak anything new. this is what auth delay would help hack and be sort of a band-aid fix. 
---
obviously people with bad security will get hacked but that's beside the point (e.g. same pws everywhere / no 2fa). the reason why auth delay would be good is to stop abuse of the recovery system lol
---
y fletch?
---
Christ, this is pathetic. Get laid and lighten up, virgin.
---
Boosting and posting about it here costs more time than just getting a couple of low fletch levels
---
There are 2 main techniques for Tekton: The walk/run around method (that you should use if you're using a 4-5 tick weapon like Hasta, DHL, Bludgeon, or Scythe) and the flinching method (that you should only use if you're using a 6 tick weapon, like an elder maul or BGS).
---
Personally I find the flinching method MUCH easier even if it isn't always technically the best since Tek's defense nerf. Can do consistent no preps in \~ 25 minutes, cannot master the walk around method for the life of me without running around full speed like I'm trying to make Tekton dizzy. Can flinch and flick piety while flinching all day tho. Point is, whatever method you're using, try the other one :P 
---
Because I need 70 fletch to string a yew bow

at that point i spam until the xp drop, it is the will of guthix which one is equipped when it hits.

It also was added to the Wilderness at a time when there was no PvP in the Wilderness. Jagex seems to not like putting quests in PvP areas (understandably so, can you imagine the complaints if the Summer quests were added and promptly got camped to hell by PKers), so these quests might be a tough sell.

Much more articulate and eloquent of a response than I normally see whilst lurking on the sub. I wholeheartedly agree though. The current wall looks so much more like a wall to protect a city. I‚Äôm curious to see what they ultimately make Prifddinas look like in its entirety.

I see everyone mentioning Slayer, which is a good money maker but, imo, gets a bit old sometimes. My cl is around 81 and total level around 1480. I honestly make most of my money hunting black chinchompas. Can easily get close to 1m per hour.

Easily kree, it can only be hit by bandos range atk
---
Why wouldn't this post make a difference? It's only going to further enforce and "justify" the people who spite vote no on pk updates. Even outsiders looking at this point will think OP is shitty for *celebrating* taking away someone's time spent building up the account.
---
Also comparing RS3's community to OSRS's is ridiculous. RS3's pking playerbase is dead even after multiple updates attempting to revive it so at this point rs3 players would rather see dev time be spent on productive things instead of spending more wasted effort into reviving the PKing scene.
---
The money picks up a lot but also you will not be going for full dragon, it's a complete waste of money. There is better gear this is much cheaper or free. The only dragon armor you will want is boots and legs. If you want a run down in what gear you should go for message me.
---
It's shit like this that makes it fun to kill hcim.

---
Authenticator delay is a legitimately silly suggestion and people just buy into it because it gets upvotes on reddit. The fundamental supposition of auth delay is "I am already hacked and just want to stall", which is dumb because the point of account security should be to avoid getting hacked in the first place and entirely prohibit others from accessing your account in any capacity. 
---
git botfukt pal

Your other comment only shows up as "[removed]". Maybe you included external links? This subreddit's set up in a stupid way and comments that link to most other websites get silently hidden from other users.
---
So you were inside Prifddinas?
---
But it does 
---
Honestly the key to getting past this is realizing when you actually have to brew. There's really no point in brewing until you can get one shot, or at the very least don't brew above 50 HP (Unless something goes seriously wrong, like stuck in firewall, about to get teleported and can't make it, hit by lightning while acid/falling crystals are active, etc.)  since most of the time that brew will just go to waste when your overload runs out... And in the mean time you spent a window of time reducing your stats before overloads restore them and lowering your supplies for when you actually need them :P 
---
Always liked the idea of a crystal city.
---
No idea what it looks like in rs3 though since I quit way before then.
---
Seems like a bad idea
---
I think he means you can pay rune watch the website to be removed, not pay back the people you scammed. You can obviously do the latter, but the former is sketch

I used to use full justiciar with DHL until I realized that I was regularly dropping food on the ground and leaving it there. Using bandos is more than good enough and the times while slower are comparable. You're using about ~300k less/hr because of not having bolt costs at the expense of slightly slower kills.
---
If you can only afford either DHL or DHCB I'd definitely say go with the lance. Its close enough at vorkath and amazing for Raids 1/Rune dragons.

That could also be an additional setting

I already know jagex wont do anything about it because they have 0 venue for customer service and are completely unwilling so I will just dispute any charge ive received with them with my credit card and see if that gets their attention.

Shouldn't be using it to begin with, much better ways that dont help the old wikis seo in the process as well.

Ash genuinely loves this game and goes to extreme lengths to make it the best he possible can. As long as the dev team keeps this amount of love for the game and interaction with the community i am willing to over look issues such as the tbow spawning once in a while.

A stupid amount of updates that are polled nowadays are catered specifically to ironman accounts, it's just funny seeing the double standard when it comes to PvP builds.

Maybe we could use crystal shards to recharge teleport crystals anywhere, without going to see islwynn (spelling questionable)?

Or if you still want to remove imbues from nmz,  just put them behind some sort of shard requirement.

81% is for runes instead of bolt racks. Has no real effect on uniques.

Why bring cishet white males into it? You're literally dampening your own statement about equality by making someone less equal based on their opinions. Just fuck them right out of your head because they aren't worthy of your existence. Let them live a sad hateful life it isnt yours to live.

don't do this, every pker gonna camp it now
---
How is solo raiding? I kind of want to give it a try since it seems like cool content but don't want to have to deal with putting a group together all the time.
---
Do you need crazy stats or super expensive gear?
---
It needs negative mage attack. 
---
Imagine thinking your opinion qualifies as a "PSA".
---
Right but companies still hire 'non-preferred' groups for the sake of diversity. Colleges do it all the time. If qualifications are completely equal, ethnicity/gender definitely has weight in acceptance/hiring process for the sake of being diverse. I mean, affirmative action is law
---
I know what your goal is; it is that which makes me describe you as such.

Oh no, someone is trying to provide me free entertainment I can choose not to consume.

That‚Äôs one of the main reasons I made this thread.

sorry I don't. this video by autumn elegy says they're pretty much the same with perfect efficiency, but that's using a quest cape which is faster than POH to fairy ring and doesn't require an inventory slot which you would otherwise have with the abyss.

Wouldn't have a problem with that if it weren't for the fact that a ridiculous amount of updates are catered to ironman accounts.

Crazy that almost all PSA‚Äôs are a person‚Äôs opinion. Didn‚Äôt think I was any better. 
---
Technically yes, but realistically it doesn't matter. Only a very small subset of people try to grind past 99, and most of the people who are doing NMZ are trying to get up their stats so they can PvM to afford that gear in the first place. So for the majority of cases, these rates are unrealistic. 
---
Those ironmen are stupid too lol. It's not a double standard, everyone who thinks their special limited account deserves accommodations is stupid. If you wanna do everything then make a main. Simple enough. 
---
I dont get it.
---
I can understand where you're coming from; the current wall is visually noisy if nothing else, so its spikiness could stand to be toned down.
---
I don't think it needs to be made entirely sleek and pretty, though. Its roughness kinda carries a neat implication regarding the power of the elves' singing, namely that it probably has limitations as far as shaping huge objects goes.
---
Should all be fixed now
---
That's a good idea. I'm gonna start wearing santa outfits
---
I thought fletching increased your FM xp/hr too since roots give more xp.
---
If I am just after FM xp is fletching bad?
---
vote no on pvp polls
---
I would say that there isn't, if there was then majority groups wouldn't have such a high rate of being hired (relative to their population) compared to minority groups.
---
Obviously rwt for some fat stacks 
---
Depends on your goals, if you just want to make sure you can buy the best f2p gear, that's easy peasy.
---
Go to World 308. The f2p Wilderness PK world. Bank everything you own before you go there. Cause if you die, you will lose it.
---
Then go North from Edgeville and pick up adamant arrows and food. You should be able to make enough to buy rune gear in a couple hours or so.

yeah i use to watch his videos then he kind of went off like i said i guess his veiws are down and he knows these area locked ironman are big there is one vid i seen i dont recall the name of the guy be he was trying to get views by making some new ironman thing  and it flop big time lol  
---
If i get a tbow or scythe im good for the rest of my life playing this game, not a chance in hell I'd split tbh 
---
I posted this like 1100 kills ago and didn't notice anything
---
Finally an end to all this madness
---
Yeah, that would be really cool to see.
---
It really sucks thay power always ends up in the hands of the weak, but many.
---
just be a chad then
---
Hmmmm
---
Probably not
---
Honestly I don't know if you're trolling or not but I recall want to believe so
---
You're right that calling people homophobic, transphobic, etc. is rather silly because bigotry doesn't mean they're the ones who are afraid.
---
However, those are the words that are used for it. Arguing the semantics of that is just deflecting the original point.
---
I was so bored of blowing glass and had 30k left I decided to do every possible chore I could think of doing
---
seriously someone summon a mod. this is an unacceptable bug
---
And here I thought the brainlet and sexy npc posts couldn‚Äôt get any better.
---
He wasn‚Äôt streaming at the time, he died off stream to his own internet disconnecting.
---
Why would you want to play portrait though?
---
I would rather shit in my hands then clap, repeatedly until the skin on my hands falls off and I‚Äôm left with nothing left then brown stained bones of hands. Then ever have to support a game that‚Äôs for trying to force its own sexist beliefs on to its community. I have never seen a pic of mod ash or any other male jagex employee/dev saying to support ‚Äúnational men‚Äôs day‚Äù. What‚Äôs next, a day where only female characters get tbows? üò≠ equality is supporting all and every single person regardless of there gender, heritage, beliefs, etc. not just shuving your own that only applies to your gender down someone‚Äôs throatüëå
---
You still play the game yet you think this is a waste of time...?
---
only if the ge gets moved to mudskipper point
---
Yeah that's what I figured. 1 pray point at a time seems worthless. Gotta grind for tb now
---
Lmao "wave: &lt;&gt;&lt; &lt;&gt;&lt; &lt;&gt;&lt; &lt;&gt;&lt;"
---
Oh I know. Just kinda curious. Like for April Fool's day they release a world with a 4000 cap or something lol.
---
I did 73 to 84 on mobile over the last few days without switching to the ice gloves. Makes it slightly less click intensive and I was only losing like 30k xp per hour. There's usually a lot of people there using buckets of water every few seconds.
---
Am I brain dead? :( 
---
Just wasting my breath about the wilderness to a room full of slack jawed, vacant eyed, mouth breathers.

It takes a while for full graceful, but I just recently did it on my fresh HCIM in a couple of days. Here's exactly what I did:
---
1-10 at gnome stronghold
---
10-20 at draynor rooftop
---
(a lot of the above is skippable with The Tourist Trap quest, but that's up to you) 
---
20-25 at al kharid rooftop
---
Do The Grand Tree quest. With 13 magic its super easy.
---
32~ to 40 at varrock rooftop
---
40 to graceful at canifis rooftops
---
With this I had full graceful at around 56 agility. Hope this helps a little! 
---
Why can‚Äôt I go to the page it just pops up a warning and the only clickable option is ‚Äúback‚Äù
---
And just like that, the duo becomes a solo.
---
ü§ó enjoy! 
---
Any reason these posts are only on reddit and not anywhere else?
---
Twitter? Forums? OSRS home page blog? 
---
Weeeeeey
---
magicstonecreate goodn't
---
The most true answer. Men don't need a day because their day has been literally every day for millions of years.
---
I got nothing against trans people either, they are just people like you and I, this person decided to have two names though, so I combined them. There is some controversy because everyones claiming he/she is brave when in reality its 2019 and that stuff is for the most part accepted.
---
Sorry you think its bigoted to combine a persons birth name and new name.
---
Did you know hell is a place of eternal punishment? Imagine burning in a lake of fire forever, no way out, nothing to distract you from the torment. I don't want you going there, all you have to do is "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved," - Acts 16:31.
---
It's easy to be saved, it's not based on how you live your life, it's by faith alone in what Jesus Christ did for you. The best part is once you trust him, you're saved forever and there's nothing you can do to lose it "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." - John 10:28.
---
Why don't you give what I'm saying a chance? I care for your soul.
---
Nah this is my mate, I was teaching him raids. We care more about our friendship than some pixels lol.
---
I love it because of the bad life choices.
---
Was this back when tribunal was a thing?
---
Ironman is an official game mode, being 1 def isn't.
---
See if you can get your hands on 13 trout
---
Set some personal goals. Maybe you want a fire cape, or to be able to make money off barrows, a fighter torso, et cetera.
---
If you have a goal in mind I can try to help you do it the efficiently so you're not wasting time doing slower methods, but I can't tell you what to do if you don't want to do it.  
---
e.g. if you want a fire cape, then I could say train your ranged up to at least 75 to use blowpipe and tell you what gear to wear and items to bring.  
---
But if you don't want a fire cape, then this advice doesn't help you, if you see what I'm getting at.
---
Another clueless yank consuming fox news. 
---
Ask Joel
---
There are a lot of ways to make money but require a lot of time investment. But as you accumulate more bank pvm returns are a lot easier to obtain. But ultimately members is like 15x more fun than f2p and thats what matters. 
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.crape.rotationcontrol make sure you have guard mode on
---
A lot of people do hold that double standard though, that's the thing. Most updates that are released nowadays are made specifically with ironman mode in mind as to not "break their metas". I remember when the deranged archeologist was released people with ironman accounts were crying over the glory drop and it was swiftly removed.
---
Honestly, 13 defence seems like such an arbitrary requirement for Song of the Elves, but it's whatever.
---
Ps. most pures do have a main.
---
Ironman accounts are capable of doing anything in the game and are not hindered by something like only getting 13def.  While they are also novelty accounts they don‚Äôt really do anything that would be considered a balancing issue afaik. 
---
You clearly got the message, sorry reddit isnt my life
---
There is (BJS), it requires 76 agility though (you can boost for it).
---
A man's gotta eat.
---
That is extremely well rounded! Shame about the high cooking! /s
---
Bowling bowl
---
I'm not, check out the video I linked.
---
Do you mean recharging crystals? Either way i agree, would be a good time to introduce this QoL
---
Dont buy an account, itll just get recovered or banned. Everything else is rather sound advice. 
---
Give it a month and youll have a decent osrs account like you described. Why do you complain about the grind in osrs and then high xp rates and no skill reqs for stuff in rsps? Do you like the grind or not? Doesnt make sense
---
The point isent that white men have any trouble finding a job the point is they are hiring people based on gender and not their talents. If white man A goes against white female B and is technically more qualified he will not get THIS job. Sure he has an easier time getting a job overall so he will be fine. The problem is that it results in less talent at jagex itself than they could potentially have. Ofc it‚Äôs possible each and every one of them is extremely talented and the best of who applied anyway but when you are hiring for diversity this is usually not the case otherwise it‚Äôs not hiring for diversity you are still just picking the best candidate for the job. Overall it‚Äôs a good move for the world as a whole and the industry as a whole but as a consumer of Jagex it just means we are potentially losing out on talent and thus a better game. I hope this makes sense I‚Äôm not trying to say it‚Äôs bad to hire for diversity but I get the argument of why people don‚Äôt like it as a consumer 
---
And? Being an ultimate ironman locked to Morytania isn't either, Jagex still added a fishing net spawn as QoL.
---
you can't kill the sulphur lizards without 44 slayer though?
---
Hey, that's pretty neat.
---
Q
---
Meanwhile in theoatrixs "best things to afk" video he recommends fucking mining rune ess. His quality has dropped like a rock 
---
I'll just assume that such a complicated universal truth won't be found on YouTube. Thanks though. I'll stick to my Neuroscience degree. 
---
a miniquest to gather seven crystal stars to open a thousand-year door
---
a hunter actvity that gives a chance at a pet rabbit
---
agility minigame that uses those crystal shards for a special stamina potion
---
new fish to catch with fishing skill
---
Absolutely. This sub is like the Donald at times 
---
Ahh. I see. I misunderstood, I can see you're point but I think it's better to knock some Slayer lvls out while you train combat unless you purely are out there to get 99 or something in a combat stat. 
---
I've played a bit on my ipad pro, it's pretty good. Way better than playing on a phone. It doesn't fill the entire screen for some reason but it's pretty close, but there is a black windowbox around the whole game.
---
Still doesnt change the fact your opinion isn't a PSA
---
Sounds like a very unlucky streak. But remember all the posts on Reddit with extremely lucky odds happening: the same happens with unlucky odds. Just keep at it. Also double check your bank (by searching).
---
Afaik there has never been a bug ever where a certain player couldn't get a drop.
---
For some starter cash, 100k or so depending on how long you want to do it for, you can loot steel platelegs and platebodies from the wilderness.
---
Just look up there spawn location world hop to get an inventory and then sell to their respective shops
---
Platelegs in al kharid, platebodies in varrock
---
Then id honestly recommend learning how to flip at the ge. You can work your way up from 500k to 1mil and so on. I flipped my way to 15mil in f2p about a year ago and have been p2p since.
---
Shocked he didn‚Äôt make a dick or fart joke after
---
You don't have to be. No1sPerfect
---
Slayer icon on your forehead 
---
Diversity group made of all white women lmao
---
And how exactly is allowing pures to finish Song of the Elves a balancing issue? 
---
I agree that adding stuff like the fishing net was dumb adn shouldn't have happened.  But that wasn't your argument, I was responding to  the difference between ironman accounts and pure accounts.

If you go to the timers on RuneLite (assuming you're using it), it shows all locations of farming patches.
---
I mean you can get enough money though farming to upkeep membs with bonds and after 70 slayer, the money gets decent. Ofc you get more money flipping or tanning hide but you get almost no level progression that way. 
---
I got 3 mage shorts and 2.2k yesterday.  About 11k total but this beats that. Rip

You did say that though, that's my problem. You give a specific outcome of your desire then give some very wordy answer to try and pretend you didn't.

"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." - 1 Corinthians 2:4-5
---
Are you dense 
---
It's not a requirement to kill them. They're 22, the same as desert lizards, youn just need 44 slayer for the boots.
---
Lol. What are you basing that on? You have to give some evidence before I even consider taking what you just said seriously.
---
The amount of people you can display is hardcoded into the game. Can't extend it and is unaffected by render distance.
---
Probably because this place gets the most traffic. Their logs show what sources everyone comes from, so if reddit is the most popular, they'll post it here.
---
just ironman things
---
Got muted before for breaking the rules. Believe me their were some infractions 
---
No they can't. 
---
I mean, I've read a lot of books too. Want me to quote some?
---
That's her dead name, though. You aren't supposed to refer to her by Bruce. She lets people refer to her old accomplishments as done by Bruce, but does not use that name anymore. 
---
Caitlyn isn't a good person and has done more harm than good for the trans community. Being said, everyone deserves to be called by their correct name and pronouns. And then you can roast them for the content of their character. Fuck Caitlyn Jenner, but not because she's trans.
---
That is entirely my argument. Why should it matter whether or not the way in which somebody plays the game is "officially" endorsed? 13 defence seems like such an arbitrary requirement for the quest, does it not?
---
I believe this is actually canon. 
---
You probably didn't make it blue or put a wave behind it. For shame.
---
How dare women want equal treatment at Jagex! I am so outraged at this, I will totally DESTROY this heinous company by cancelling my subscription because I think I'm more important than I am and the company can't survive without *my* contribution
---
wtf that isn't true at all. most layouts drop an ovl, and those that don't regular 78 herb ovl is fine. itll maybe cost you like 30s on an olm due to being 116/99 instead of 120/99 but thats all.

https://old.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/ax72d5/who_are_able_to_name_all_the_jmods_in_the_picture/ehrjxar/

Here are the list of names
---
Mod Maz wasn't in it but they had a squirrel
---
Mod Luna is known by people in oldschool and rs3
---
Mod Mohawk is known by people in rs3
---
Don't know who the rest are, never seen them before.
---
Teak trees to 99 I you can pay attention, or teak untill 90 then redwoods 90-99.
---
No thats gay
---
Bro, don't waste your time arguing with selfish hypocrites. 
---
Anything that even indirectly benefits pures is a default no. 
---
It's really sad honestly.
---
Love it! Keep them coming!
---
Gathering or running something. You'll run out of time by training skills first. Use your first member period to make as much cash as possible. Then worry about skills with your second bond. 
---
Might have to do a few quests. 
---
Look up no skill requirements money making guide on YT. Plenty of 400k/hr + options out there. 
---
that's true, if you wear bandos rassets and sit on a bench in your poh you can see clear up there and it's flat.

Uhm duh?

Americans are at the center because everyone talk about them/their country.
---
&gt;That's the most common method people's accounts get compromised. 
---
unless OP had a few hundred mil he probably wasn't recovered. pretty much always its a phish, the only people getting recovered have fat banks.
---
Yeah that works! Honestly I just want the giant bar removed lol
---
Keep 3 of them, after that you'll get a torstol seed instead. Also happy cake day 
---
Was in Corruption myself
---
Didn't know this thanks
---
I really love that analogy, but it would be nice if the dye wasn't stirred on both sides. You can't have conflict without 2 sides. These people will burn themselves. Instead of saying this is jagex diversity group it should say jagex equality group. They are literally fighting to be diverse, not equal and included.
---
I fell for it when I came back to play after almost 10 years. I had some decent stuff snd money and lost it all...
---
Fair enough. I wonder how it had the username of an account I set up years ago and have never played on since. 
---
I have 2fa. I‚Äôve heard of people getting their accounts recovered and started to get worried. 
---
Would be extremely rough to train crafting, especially if the al kharid Tanner is considered a shop
---
Reddit posts about the Swampletics intro copypasta in the Twitch chat for the CSGO tournament last week. I have seen almost 20 posts about the same thing over three to four days.

Only if that new area gets moved to stampot Bridge

Wiki probably wrong, I've never heard of using a bass. Always had to go to canifis for a shark on my past 4 failed ironmen. 
---
You get double experience when smelting gold ore while you have the goldsmith gauntlets from Family Crest. And when you use the Blast furnace to smelt them it takes your entire inventory of gold ore and smelts it into gold bars in 1 xp drop. However, you need to wear ice gloves to pick up the gold bars so if you accidentally equip the ice gloves before the xp drop you don't get double the experience.
---
clearly not obvious since it has 3k viewers 
---
Bob's death annoyed me so much, solely because it was just sort of a "whoops" in that he just happened to be standing right behind the player and didn't move. Felt very anticlimactic.
---
Those are calles view bots...
---
You do know that doing this method is NOT efficient at all. You only avg maybe 5-6 corp kills/hr. Might be dumb, but this is the only way some accounts can get Corp kills.
---
That's just wjat jagex wants you to think EVERYTHING IS SEEN THROUGH THEIR FILTER MAN
---
it's more likely he responded to a phishing email (they all look very legit) or his email was compromised, or he followed a link on social media (twitch reddit facebook etc) and logged into forums/other fake promotions.
---
recovery isn't likely unless he had a pretty decent chunk of gp on his acc, and he happened to show that wealth on reddit, discord, etc etc. people who recover accs use social media to find people w/ decent banks, then look for info associated w/ that rsn/name on social media.
---
Did you ever find them?

Grind winterdodt, good xp and decent money in the long run

Get the account banned lol

I just like to flex my Vorkath pb since it‚Äôs the only thing I have over everyone lol

Have you played the quest already?
---
Do items not count as ported content? There are many items in the game that are just ported versions. They are just renamed. 
---
Only need 256 at most! Jagex updates KQ so you can complete the diary if you March the drop rate. Unfortunately it can‚Äôt be used for recollection so I‚Äôm currently 200 kills dry for a 2nd head (used my first on recolor and lost it hydra being dumb ;) )
---
Not a terrible idea, but detractors are just going to say ‚Äúgo to world 330.‚Äù In reality there are always going to be a mass of people hosting at all times at multiple house portals.
---
From what I read earlier it's the same req as normal lizards.
---
Yup. That changes nothing 
---
I'd imagine the other 10 are a part of the RS3 team.
---
An unlock that brings the equivalent of dark essence fragments to the lower tier altars (within reason). This might help improve views on runecrafting as a skill sub 77 and doesn't really break the skill as a whole if gathering rates for the fragments are balanced against time running between bank and altar.
---
You don't understand how you're virtue signalling? You literally just stated that your opinion makes you a good human being. 
---
Dont hug me I'm scared if anyones wondering
---
Those people are literally unaffected. Except for the xp/misc. gold they may have lost. Don't pretend this isn't a colossal fuck up in every respect just because a very small minority of folks may have benefited from or were unharmed by the rollback.
---
any update?
---
those bones are all common af. you have untradable drop notifications on and such? triple check your bank too
---
Dear diary,

Damn, you're all over this thread

You can trade multipled items for crates 
---
lmao what? I've literally never seen a conversation like that. portables world frequently gets worst than wintertodt's most active world, and there's been a few times where jmods have sat around invisible because of the amount of reports.
---
I just wanted to meme on the rs3 community, but now I feel like you're trying to apply a boogeyman to it.
---
You're right man. These people will literally shoot down anything that benefits PvPers, thankfully Jagex is going to be addressing the PvP polling issue soon.
---

At Barrows I need 88%. How does opening the chest work? Say I kill 3 skeletons and click the chest for the last brother and kill him, does the loot generate on the second click of the chest?
---
Alright I went ahead and watched your video. I was going to try to link you one of my favorite book chapters but I can't find it free online in a couple minutes if searching. I was looking for circling the blanket with god. Which is a chapter out of "the terrible with testosterone" by Robert Sapolsky. 
---
Now for your video. Firstly, that guy looked and sounded way too much like Jack from Lost. But, ignoring that lets address the actual content. Firstly, it's all predicated on the idea that his religion, which didn't even exist until quite recently as far as humans go back, and this is a fundamental error. He, and most people who believe their God is the correct God, are so self absorbed they can't even imagine the idea they're possibly wrong. Secondly, his entire argument. He's basically saying you can be a child rapist but so long as you believe in Jesus you'll go to heaven. I have a problem with that. I know it's very common in Christianity too, to say you just need to believe and then your fine. I'm sorry but that just seems like a way for people who do bad things to just get away with it by lying to themselves that they're still fine. Believe it or not, there is a universal code of ethics for humans and it's found right in the middle of everyone's brain, called the amygdala. Of course there are some individuals with decreased amygdala sizes and these people are generally diagnosed with anti social personality disorder and have a difficult time telling what's right and wrong. Also they seem to lack mirror neurons making empathy difficult. Regardless, no one needs a book to tell them how to behave and this single religion has caused so much pain and suffering, along with most religions out there, that there's no way any "god" would condone the things that people do in their names. And if they do then I want nothing to do with them. Furthermore, I am not going to waste a second of my time or neural Energy believing or thinking about some nonexistent being that was most likely created by humans who don't like the idea that inherently, nothing bad happens to bad people and nothing good happens to good people just because some cosmic being is going to make it so. Along with this, the amount of hinderances that religions like Christianity have caused for the advancement of knowledge makes them wholly unforgivable. Any individual or group that tries to stop human progress in knowledge, needs to be ignored if not eradicated. FURTHERMORE if there's an all knowing all powerful being, why the fuck would be need to send his kid down to be tortured for everyone just so they could be forgiven? If he's all powerful, wouldn't forgiveness without torture be something he's capable of? That's gonna be a hard pass for me. Also why would a being matching this description give a crap where I stick my penis or in how many people??? I'm not all powerful being and even I don't give a shit where you stick yours. Quite frankly the entire concept is stupid and is solely there to keep the commoners conforming to a certain status quo of what whoever is in charge at the time deems acceptable. Please refer to all the edits that have been made over the last couple thousand years by Kings and clergy (who were very capable of being biased) to the point that who knows what that book even originally read. And I'll assure you, God didn't come down and bless some printing press to make the king James versions his official word in English. 
---
1 in 25,000 drop rate. You may have hit your luck already. But good luck with that.
---
Yeeesss i would grind to 99 agility just for this if somehow for some reason that was a req lol Just saying this would be awesome
---
It would be good if everyone did their part and manually went to the new wiki from Google searches until it's totally overtaken the Google results 
---
I mostly just did sand crabs until 70 attack and 75 range. Also, once I got 50 magic, I started doing barrows with Iban's Staff and made millions that way. I also got to 70 magic from 50 after about 150 chests
---
should also work against prospector percy and his dwarfs.
---
See you in 250 mil xp for that fishing pet
---
Well that was stupid. 
---
I don't think men need an international day because all you have to do to appreciate something men is done is look out the window at civilised society 
---
did you accidentally mispost here and not /r/conservative?
---
Yeah there's a 100% chance thats one of the first comments you'll see, just like a karambwan related comment in A friend's comment sections, both of those got old for me quick.
---
Neither of those were as good as RoTM or WGS or some RS3 quests. MM2 was pretty poor except for the whole travelling around visiting old quest locations like the troll
---
Gratz! Some crazy odds for sure. Fuck these other scrubs.
---
Got any guide or tips for this boss. I wanna camp him as well but cant find proper guide
---
As a software developer, this is an incredibly stupid security flaw and could be easily fixed. Jagex's 2FA is like taping a padlock to a door.
---
Yes but often times when raiding with friends or clan mates, you agree to split any unique loots. If someone ends up agreeing then they receive a unique, they sell on GE, split the gp, and give to everyone who was on the trip/raid
---
Yes that‚Äôs been happening just about since OSRS released lol thank for trying to warn people though
---
Well above drop rate so I wouldnt be mad.
---
Zammys best as it lowers Mage level, if you get into a fight with another pure FoZ them first and then you can land the easy tb and snare while they waste a restore dose to TB you back
---

Flex seal your anus shoot. 
---
there are also fire giants with a 0 slayer req.
---
Thx dude!! 
---
It has a cool quest back then. But what is even more important imo, is that ironman can spec it like 30 times so it has 0 combat stats and i think that's really sad. Because you can kill it without that exploit too.
---
Yanille, I did 99 prayer there and experienced that almost every day.
---
Gotcha. Thanks
---
The bigger question is, do you want to get blackballed from nearly every PvM community and lose out on drops in the long run because you can't get efficient groups.
---
yea sweep out that dust hole 
---
Diablo 3 isn't really an MMO tho is it? More of an online RPG. I feel like that puts it into a different category than osrs. 
---
Why do mining gloves have a 20 mining requirement when you need 60 mining to enter the guild to buy them?
---
Account is ruined GG. Major fucking L
---
Cool ?
---
Maybe I'd be able to reply a lot easier if you didn't make multiple replies to the same comments for no reason at all
---
Ohh noo YOU GOT MEEEEEEE FUUUUUUUUUCK
---
FYI I did this quest on Saturday and it took maybe 10 kills for me to get it.  Note if you started the quest and was casually collecting bones for awhile, if you have a bone in your bank you cant get another.  I would double check your bank and if its not there I would submit a bug report. 
---
??????? Try again srry
---
Oh it is now. 
---
No way you only lost 30k an hour or you normally do it horribly wrong anyway. If you should have your ice gloves on almost 99 percent of the time, with 27 bars in the shoot already, you drop 26 ore, run over click the box, once you click the box you hit the 1 key on your keyboard and click yoru gold smith gauntlents at the same time. You'll swap in the same tick that you withdraw. making space for the ore you fired to drop down. Also once you are in the bar interface your ore 'freezes' in time and wont actually drop until you exit that interface.
---
Grats man, you‚Äôre more than halfway to all 99‚Äôs!
---
It is pretty horrid if you want to be part of any PvM community in the future. Most of them will check RuneWatch and give you the boot upon finding out you're a scamming piece of shit.
---
I haven't done barrows in a long time but the highest possible reward potential that you can get that has a 0% chance of getting bolt racks is 880/1012. This is 86.96% but I can't remember how in game rounding works, whether this would be displayed as 86 or 87% in game.  
---
This exact value can only be done by doing 6 brothers, and 212 combat total from the other monsters in the tunnel which is 3 blood worms and a crypt spider, but it's often not worth going out of your way to do these every time, because crypt spiders only spawn in one room, there is no guarantee that you will actually get your maximum reward potential.
---
You can get very close with 2 skeletons + 1 bloodworm (206), 2 skeletons + 1 crypt spider (210), 4 bloodworms (208) or 2 skeletons + a crypt rat (197), and with the exception of the spiders, these other 3 can all be spawned from opening doors meaning you can kill them on the way to the rewards room.  
---
Getting less than this perfect value just means instead of *potentially* getting the maximum of 236 bloods in one chest, your maximum is like 230 or something which is still good money.  
---
Getting higher than 880/1012 reward potential means that in some rare cases, you get 3 bolt racks or something, which would have otherwise been something better i.e. runes, and this can happen multiple times from a single chest if you're really unlucky.  
---
So when do we purge user purge for obvious lack of a desire to have a fair work environment?

HAHAHA GUYS LOOK, THIS SUB WITH 325K+ SUBS HAS USERS THAT SOMETIMES VISIT OTHER SUBREDDITS AND MAKE OSRS RELATED POSTS!!! SO FUNNY!!!! HAHAHAH

Lol, both questions were in one reply but good try. Just keep dodging the questions/issues and make more personal attacks.
---
When i first started playing as a kid, i thought this was where your money bags went lol. I also thought youd get something it you equipped something in every slot, i was disappointed when i found out i was wrong lol

Ya i prob wouldnt to be honest. Id rather build rapport and not get myself shunned from raid or pvm communities for one BiS

Interesting, okay cheers, appreciate it bud

Ye dis makes sense bcos if it a bit chimchonpa u can only put 2 in da stink and 0 in da pink becoz of the Uther part n datz y it hits a 0

Besides I have a jumpy brain, it moves a lot don't judge me for it.

Are you mad!? That was one of your best videos!

Well thats impossible they attack every 8 ticks so you 1tick flick 8 of them

Isn't there a one hour death timer? Or is that just in the wilderness?

It's just moving soo fast I can't keep up

But you wouldn't understand

Having an hour to go pick up all of your stuff again with no penalty is a game integrity issue.

Wouldn't Verac still do a number on you, hitting through prayer?

The light spot on its snoot looks like a mouth and I can't unsee it

Maybe, but that doesn't mean Jagex shouldn't do something about it. Do you honestly believe the not having 10 spam bots in the GE on every single world wouldn't improve the game?
---
Are you wearing 4 pieces of warm clothing?

You also take bigger hits from the falling snow and brazier breaks, but those are both avoidable.

Question : how did mining of all skills get your attention 
---
It‚Äôs pure struggle for me
---
Is this furnace closer or better in any way than Edgeville/Port Phasmatys? Hadn't noticed it yet.
---
Just your average brain dead pker, move on everyone 
---
They are doing something about it. They ban thousands upon thousands of accounts for this type of thing. 
---
Well unless you are doing those elite diaries fairly soon, it's less than ideal to not boost really. Like sure eventually they will put that time into it but by that logic anytime we start leveling a skill we shouldn't stop until it's high enough for all diaries that use it. Assuming you have a reason for the diary you are doing it's probably more ideal to just boost to it regardless of the level and move on from it. Since you are "going to put in the time anyways" it doesn't make a difference if you put in that time now or later except maybe the cost in gp of the boost but most boosts are cheap.
---

/u/JagexGambit do you know why one of the demonic gorilla spawns in second room was removed? It made my slayer task this weekend far more tedious because I couldn't easily alternate the 2 next to rock wall. I can't find anything in the news post about it and it just seems to have been removed for no reason.
---
Wow, waited 2 minutes to repost someone‚Äôs post. Nice restraint
---
This is so true, pkers dont deter me, the skill itself does. Managed 91 and I want to kill myself even if I'm making decent gp an hour. I dont know what runespan is, but heard its afk and super food exp rates. Even if everyone could craft double nats, laws, and deaths, I will bet prices wont move because most rather delete themselves from life. I guess the 99 rc devalue is the only thing that people would complain about. 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs the issue. No items ever leave the game as a result and there‚Äôs no penalty to dying

You could make addy darts or if you have plenty of gp to waste then boost with dragonfruit pies and make dragon darts 
---
It's pretty hard to quantify tbh, and it certainly depends on the time of day. There are times where I am seeing/not seeing PK'ers when i expect too. I can go hours unbothered, and on the opposite end I've left several times cause i just can't find a good world.

Naw man if you did making/meeting history quests, they describe how guthix brought the first people in from other worlds thru the world portal to the new world he discovered, gielinor. 
---
on rs3 its further fleshed out that humans came from a saradomin worshipping world, and gielinor was made by the elder gods. but whether its canon or not you decide.
---
But both agree that guthix did not create gielinor nor first people. 
---
I could probably make a convincing fake screen shot in about 4 minutes using Microsoft paint.
---
Its probably stupid easy to fake with photoshop.
---
btw btw
---
It's a tricky one because the chance to get a unique depends on the points earned. The pet is 1/53 and the twisted bow is 1/34 so a 1 in 1802 chance or 0.06%.
---
With your kill count and if we assume you got max points for each of those runs then you would have had a 9.3% chance to get Olmlet+Twisted Bow by run 264. If you had minimum points each run then you had a 1.4% chance to get it by run 264
---
And when were they allowed to be married? Wasn't the wife also obligated to have sex with the husband?
---
There is.... They passed the threshold and got a chance at the drop. You just never see the thousands of first raid kc pictures where there was no unique
---
Let's be honest here, we probably do.
---
Every damn time
---
Let me see if I have it figured out.  Bare with me here ahem; runecrafting is slow?
---
Look it up, literally 80% of the UK is white. Why wouldn't the majority of jagex employees be white?
---
Yeah, I have full control over the account now. Someone how they still think I would spend $360 on the game just to charge it back.
---
Other minis are objective focused. This objective is kill or be killed. It's more than just switching prayers, it's switching and flicking. Doing it properly gives you an incredible advantage in the game, most people can't. It gets dominated by those who can, so no one wants to play unless they're really good at flicking/switching. 
---
I assumed it wasn't something "that you are constantly doing." 
---
If you are trying to keep pkers away from your ironman account by attacking them with 1 item, then I wouldn't consider it ragging. It wouldn't be in the spirit of the game and ironman mode, but it's not against the rules afaik? Not too knowledgeable regarding ironman content.    
---
If you are specifically looking for a player to attack him with 1 item repeatedly, that would be ragging. 
---
Was the grind all the time it took to pixelize all their faces? Lol

Why make agility even easier? Play rs3 for faster XP gains
---
I actually really like this idea in theory as a way to incorporate black graceful and the new elf area, but it's still not enough to make me enjoy agility. Plus I just have no idea how it would be balanced. Presumably even with the bonus you'd get lower xp rates than your max since you're essentially paying with xp for a more interesting way to train/reward of black marks (like with konar, generally lower xp but you get brimstone keys and going different places). If the rates were higher it would just make most other agility training dead content. The only two things that agility needs to make it more appealing are a faster xp method for a cost (maybe a mark sink? pay marks to enter an area with crazy high xp rates?), and a more interesting or afk method (which arguably already exist with things like agility pyramid, although the only "afk" agility methods are garbage). This just recycles the same boring agility courses with worse xp than you could be getting and a reward that could easily be added to preexisting content. Just one man's opinion though.
---
As a person who got 99WC this is what i did/alternated to.  
---
I ended up switching between Yews and Teaks to level 90.  
---
Yews - More money and more afk in WC guild.  
---
Teaks - way faster xp wise. But ideal method is dropping them.  
---
At 90 i switched to Redwoods and kept them.  
---
For quicker speed, fastest method will always be two ticket teaks on ape atoll.  
---
It its incredibly click intensive and not fun I'll tell you.  
---
Could also continue Yews past 90 for more money but I'd just redwood and keep.  
---
For later experience in FM, I believe fastest method is Todt to 90 then FM the redwoods from 90-99 WC.   
---
Thats my input as a person who has 99 WC and what I plan on doing.
---
Changing things to change the Pvp meta, with virtually no draw back to any other builds. Rune gloves are only BiS for 34/35 def accounts, super niche.

The armor should be rechargable at any point like the archlight, not when it is only broken. shield and bow and other crystal items should also be like that

Less bugs, less forced updates, could give a fuck less about diversity. As long as you get the job done you could be a lesbian Eskimo or a god damn kangaroo.

two plus two is four, minus one, thats three, quick maths

points over 500 give a chance of an extra drop, with every 500 additional points being a guaranteed extra drop (if you have 750 you've got a 50% chance of a 3rd drop, 1000 a guaranteed third drop, 1250 a guaranteed 3rd drop and 50% chance of a 4th, etc.)
---
so if you're just in it for FM exp you should only burn logs, you'll still get your 2 drops anyway, but if you're trying to get a pet you should maximize points

What you are looking to solve is numbers on a graph that don't show a equal 50/50 and think that is due to some systemic system of violence and oppression. Yeah that's called life, and in life a majority of the girls just aren't interested in this field that much.
---
And forcing them into the workplace does bring those numbers up on the graph, but that's all it does. It doesn't change interest or desire or the amount of girls wanting to do so in the future.
---
So half chicks are there now... Cool none of them play the game. Oh wow jagex is really out of touch.

There is no point, I think it's only a thing because people were asking why it doesnt count as 2 kills since its 2 gargoyles. So Jagex was like alright sounds dumb but here you go.

I don't think this has as much to do with ironmen as much as it has to do with combating bots. The difference in complexity between a bot that has to kill something and a bot that has to do a repetitive skilling task is quite significant.

Level 70 armour needs to match barrows with set effect. If they're considering adding a staff too, that means they want crystal armour to be all around good defense armour. Comparing the armour to barrows, it looks like it's balanced because people hardly ever use the full sets for their bonuses. Maybe give crystal armour an effect like increasing attack speed instead of a damage boost and add more weapons? The staff could have +5% damage boost and the set effect would only increase speed.
---
ive been playing again since 2015 and just hit the glorious 1776 god bless america total level so dont feel too bad, play for fun like how games are meant to be played.

My comment wasn't to discuss the magnitude of the fuck up, you're right. It was totally unprofessional to dick about with assets in a way that could be pushed to live, accident or not. I still hold the sentiment that it's... Really unfortunate that people got drops in that time frame. I don't know. :/

I hate mining now that I'm in the 70's but I really liked the lower levels. It goes really fast and feels rewarding especially on a new or low level account. Plus he apparently managed to make around 8m cash by only 60 combat stats and minimal game knowledge so I'm assuming that was mostly from mining.

What's the chance of getting that? I'm grinding my stats to be able to solo raids one day.

Not to mention the thing is so marginally better than a toxic trident that it would probably devalue that too.

I wish they'd do something with the boss. It's a great fight but the effort doesn't match the reward at all. Bad xp and mediocre gp that depends too much on a 1/500 drop (1 every ~20 hours). The pet is amazing but that's literally the only reason to kill it over normal gargoyles.

You absolutely don't need to use stimulants to skill for long sessions at a time. For some people, it's incredibly rhythmic and relaxing, especially Fishing. It's very easy to put a podcast on or a comfy playlist and 3tick fish for the full 6 hours without touching a drug.

My point is that the picture means nothing because it's not on runescape and can't be confirmed to be real by jmods unless it happens to them. The most they'll see is "This guy is inviting people to his clan and giving a discord name", They can't make a link from discord -&gt; game because screenshots aren't reliable.

Check your in-game attack settings - the joystick icon should have extra options for "NPC/Player attack" which allows you to hide attack

I guess I should have clarified with stews you have to think more about it cause it takes time. However I think j people wildly overestimate how long it takes to get stews. I think it's because they only take the spices they need when they are killing the rats. I just take every spice except the combat one and now I have a shit ton for when I need it. I think the last time I did it I needed 2 different spices and it took me like an hour to get enough for what would likely get me +5 for both (it did). Considering at 70+ it's like 30m-hour per level I considered it totally worth since I won't touch those skills again for a while (fucking thieving).

Grind 70 agility on rooftop courses.. get graceful and it‚Äôll make your life easier.. also start farming early

thanks for believe me!! I appreciate your comment. jmods or mods can verify that everything is fine in my account, both osrs-rs3. im playing both games same account 4 years ago.

If you die and leave items of the ground, those items are safe but de spawn after an hour. If you die to zulrah/hespori/vork etc then you lose that stuff if you die again.

---
Oh and here I thought it was about my ability to feed a family without using other people's taxes. Thanks for the clarification! 
---
Oh ya you're right getting spices takes time but you can't think of it like "more skills to get +5, more time" cause while you are getting spices for one, the other can drop (unless they share the same spice). I collect every spice except the combat when I'm there so I end up with enough for a +5 in each spice "category" every hour. Considering a 70+ skills can take sometimes an hour per level (looking at you thieving, rc, etc), it's so worth. Tho in some cases it's more worth to level it to the point you can use the guaranteed boost from something like a wild pie.

Gave ya a follow other wise I'd probably never notice when you go live lol. Good luck, already doing way better than I ever did lol.

Interesting, you go for the small rat spices instead of the boss rats? I feel like the boss rats are faster and you can just do them when you neer a specific boost.

Can you explain why you think that?

Go to a psychiatrist. Tell them about your lack of focus and forgetfulness, how you‚Äôre either too antsy to sit down for long periods or how sitting down for long periods makes you sleepy. You had problems maintaining your grades in school, and lack of attention to detail is having an affect on you at work. You‚Äôve tried everything from diet, exercise, and caffeine to help and while the energy‚Äôs there, your focus is not. You‚Äôre not the type of person to take medicine but if it means not being fired from your job then you‚Äôre willing to take that risk. Good luck. Play smart.

id rather if they made something like explorer bag into an item that works as an equippped looting bag you can't take off while it has items in it. maybe it can take 5 stacks or something.

&gt; assault is being in fear of being physically hit. 
---
I am not sure if this is the legal definition of assault. In my jurisdiction, assault is the attempt of attacking someone. If the attack lands on the victim, it's assault and battery. If it missed or the victim dodged it, it's just assault. It looks like she called the police for fear of assault, not real assault. A Friend has proof he never attempted to attack her. But more important is that his ex lied to the police he attacked her, not that she feared of being attacked by him.

Man I'm in college and I never find these addy peddlers you guys talk about.

A stronger version of obsidian armor, but for crystal might work:
---
* No offensive stats, or just enough to be competitive to use. Not enough to devalue existing gear
---
* Good all around defensive stats. It should be worth using for all styles. No one should go "well I'd like to use crystal gear here but it isn't good for range/melee/magic".
---
* Give it a set effect that makes crystal weaponry competitive against the current meta of weapons EXCLUDING those from raids. Crystal armor + crystal weapons should provide offensive capability that is on par with the current meta (when you exclude raids exclusives). You'd use other weapons and armor when crystal gear doesn't meet either offensive or defensive requirements.
---
* With this, you'd need to introduce a crystal magic weapon and quiver, to make range and mage feasible. Perhaps a crystal wand, that uses soul runes + crystal shards for its own spell?
---
I did the boss rats before and realized they took so ridiculously long that I could have probably found 4 of that spice killing rats by that point (assuming a normal cat/hellcat. Not kitten or overgrown)

Sure, from Wikipedia:
---
&gt; The nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region. Some countries use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group; an example of this is the reservation system in India. In some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes.
---
The United States:
---
&gt;In the United States, affirmative action in employment and education has been the subject of legal and political controversy; in 2003, a pair of decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States (Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger) permitted educational institutions to consider race as a factor when admitting students while prohibiting the use of quotas.
---
However, I did learn that the UK does not have affirmative action but "Positive Action"
---
&gt;In other countries, such as the UK,[6][7][8] affirmative action is rendered illegal because it does not treat all races equally. This approach to equal treatment is described as being "color blind". In such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force. This is sometimes described as "positive action".

---
Reading this article just changed my thinking on affirmative action. If you had just linked this (or any of the other top 10 results for "who does affirmative action benefit?") we could have had a civil discussion, you would've proved your point, and we'd all be a little bit smarter.

But no. You had to have a little temper tantrum and now you look like a complete buffoon who can't even hold a conversation with an adult. Maybe you can learn something from this.

Haha and just pay people based on productivity so that certain people can never compete or feed their family. Why should Jimmy get payed $20 when he does 60% of the work I do? Jimmy should be payed $12 an hour.
---
Maybe it is just due to a lack of specificity and clarity of words.  Equality can mean 1 of two things, completely equal results or completely equal opportunity, and these two things are miles apart in their societal consequences.
---
So maybe when talking about "equality" they need to be specific and say equality of opportunity.
---
This societal level miscommunication around the word equality is leading to a lot of problems.  Because people who are pushing equality of results are masquerading it as equality of opportunity.

First things first, add in a Crystal Staff. Make it need level 70 magic and 40 attack, and be a bit worse than an Ahrim's staff.
---
Next, replace your crystal helmet with 3 different helmets, one for each style, much like how Void currently is. They should have low to no stats for balancing purposes. Make it so that while wearing the full set, crystal weapons have 15% increased accuracy and 10% increased damage (much like how Void works). With a crystal staff, there would be a crystal weapon for each combat style so it would work. Im just an idea man, someone who has a better grasp of OSRS's combat system should probably fine tune the numbers.
---
Pros:
---
- A quality reward that is in a similar vein to Obsidian Armor or Void, gives a good reason to do the quest from a PvM perspective.
---
- Gives a solid buff to crystal equipment, while making it so you have to devote to a lower armor rating than if you didnt want that extra power
---
- Elves definitely have mages, gives more realism to have a crystal staff in game
---
Cons:
---
- Probably devalues someones Ironman
---
- Might devalue Obsidian? (Id argue not, because Obsidian has no quest requirements and doesnt degrade, while this has both, but its worth acknowledging as a potential risk)
---
Yeah, typos and not being able to spell are the same ya idiut

I would like to see a bit of Ancient Magicks content come from Prif, to tease at the relationship between Seren and Zaros. Be subtle about it rather than making it a huge plot point; just enough to get the idea across rather than having needless god drama. This is worldbuilding, not a soap opera.
---
For example, add a "Elf Capital Teleport" spell to the spellbook, and perhaps a new "element" of spells with a unique effect, such as Prismatic Burst/Barrage/etc., that the Crystal Staff would be able to autocast. Perhaps these spells could also be an excuse to introduce Life Runes, that could be later employed in the Zeah spellbook rework.

---
"Crystal Chest":
---
* There would be a Crystal Chest here like in Taverly but it'd have a better but also different loot table that does not contain Dragonstone (as to make the one in Taverly still good), this would be opened with the same Crystal Keys as the chest in Taverly.
---
"Singing Stones":
---
* Singing stones would be used to Imbue Crystal equipment, this would be gotten from the Gauntlet. These would be tradable.
---
* My intent with the Singing Stones is to move the Imbue from NMZ while also not locking it behind any content so it doesn't hurt any builds.
---
"Crystal Staff":
---
* I think it'd be nice to have a Crystal equivalent for Magic, I was thinking something like a 20% Damage Bonus while having middle tier stats otherwise; loses Damage bonus as charge goes down unless imbued.
---
* Should have a Spec, as we have very little specs on staves.
---
* Would have minor Prayer Bonus.
---
"Ring/Necklace of Seren":
---
* Ring, Ranged Attack bonus ring with Prayer Bonus.
---
* Necklace, Magic Attack and Defense bonus necklace with Prayer Bonus.
---
* Require 70 Prayer.
---
* These would be gotten from the gauntlet.
---
"Seren's Peace":
---
* This would be similar in concept to Guthix Rest, also being a Tea.
---
* This would heal 5 HP, cannot boost over Max HP (Unlike Guthix Rest).
---
* This would restore 3% Run Energy.
---
* This would yield a +2 to all gathering skills (Mining, Fishing, Woodcutting, Hunter, Farming) potion that would stack with other potions that boost it's related stats.
---
"Crystal POH Wall Kit":
---
* If you've been to Prif, you'd gain the ability to change your POH's Wall Kit to a Crystal Wall Kit.
---
"Spirit Tree &amp; Fairy Ring":
---
* I think it'd be nice to have a Spirit Tree patch.
---
* Fairy Ring on a far end would be good, makes the Spirit Tree more useful while also still adding a form of transport.
---
"Crystal Tea Kettle":
---
* This item would allow you to load it with up to 6 teas worth of materials of 1 tea type.
---
* Has a "Brew" option, which is the primary left click option; If done it will fill all Tea Cups in your inventory that it can with the stored Tea.
---
* This can be gotten as loot from the gauntlet, is tradable unless loaded.
---
* Would break on death even when tradable dropping 10,000gp and could be repaired for 12,000gp.
---
* This can hold: Guthix Rest, Seren's Peace, Tea, Nettle Tea.
---
"Tirannwn":
---
* Add some awkward Runite rocks w/ Increased chance at Gems.
---
* Add some chinchompa hunting spots.
---
* Add some magic trees.
---
* Add a fairy ring to the center of Tirannwn.
---
* Add Deposit Boxes to Tyras Camp and Lletya's area so gathering in Tirannwn has some purpose.

---
Weaponry: Crystal Javelin Head, makes Crystal javelin,+1 max hit from Dragon, rare drop from The Gauntlet.  
---
Crystal Bracers: New BiS Ranged Bracers, spiky vambracers made of crystal, unique drop from The Gauntlet. Degrades like crystal equipment, can be imbued to sustain bonus, charged with new shards. Ammunition Effect: Sometimes these bracers will launch ammo without using it. Only works for ammunition slot, does not work with blowpipe. Saving ammunition will degrade the bracers further.

You need to give citations to this. Poor people are the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action. In the United States white people make up well over 70% of the population. Black people make up 12.3-13% of the population. Of course white people are going to be the largest benefactors of tons of shit. 
---
The real question about it is, if you have a qualified poor white person and an almost, but not quite, equally qualified black person, who do you pick (for college)? It will always be the less qualified person.

Saying white people are the largest benefactors is idiotic. It's like saying, white people are the biggest demographic in the country. Of course they are...

I spent 10m in ranarr seeds and came out with about 15m profit more or less. Just run those every 90 minutes, plant an attas seed when you can. Ranarr seeds only require 26 farming which you can get in an hour questing. Just no life slayer, it‚Äôs what I did till 85 slayer. Never buy full dragon, I‚Äôm rocking a 500m bank atm. Boss when you‚Äôre higher level, barrows is super easy and cheap, demonic gorillas is amazing money, none of these things require high stats. At lvl 100 I had about 120m.  
---
quests are the most valueable thing to do 10000000%. good quest experience rewards and go from there! You can gain a ton of exp through members questing vs traditional training. Your first big goal as a member should be to complete recipe for disaster, once that is complete your stats will be looking quite nice!

TBH I'm fine with things like these. They're great and effective. What I think what people like him and other Chapofags is cooperate power play. 
---
They haaaaate corperate America and see it as nothing but a chain of power, and nothing more. They're obsessed with it beyond belief to the point that they try to mimic these "systemic chains of oppression" by creating a equally toxic environment of even more power Dynamics.
---
To then the world is nothing but power games. Nothing more, nothing less. Arguments like this don't boil down without leaving some flawed residue stuck in the pan. 
---
To them to gain power you must take away power.
---
When the reality of the situation is it's just some useless corperate busy body that manages people trying to convince people they are needed, and their education is valid. They're just looking at numbers on a chart and want them to be the same because that's how they think it should be. Regardless if the person really wants to work at a dated game that gives no transferable skills for 20k a year, when the standard of living is much more around 40-50k a year in that area.
---
Whoopity dooo, at least corperations make slavery comfortable for all. I just want a game that is made by people who actually play it and want to work for near min wage, not cause it makes the corperation look good. 
---
LMAO!!!

Never heard of that, seems pretty strong now that you mention it. Thanks!
---
So, I've been keeping a log of my farming runs with the sole purpose of getting some hard averages on the new hespori seeds. My first attempt was 39 runs each, 8 plots (x4 disease free, x4 not). The numbers I came to were a 4.23% yield increase with Attas and a 55% reduction in sick/dead plants with Iasor. However, starting my second attempt, I'm currently at a 0.07% boost 1/3rd of the way through. So if this run with Attas doesn't give me anywhere close to my previous numbers, I'm going to have to do more. A big rumor around here is that there's something going on with the bottomless bucket and Attas seeds, so that's something else I'm probably going to have to test.

---
When does the seasonal start?
---
Something here tells me nobody on this thread understands probability. Chance^(amount of kills) is your probability. My guy.
---
I think in the game useful=good, where I get the impression you think good=fun. I can agree it is repetitive, but that's kinda the nature of the game. I'm all more adding ways that are more interactive and fun, but agility already got a huge xp bonus with the addition of roof top courses. Part of what makes this game to me is the grind and I don't think things should happen faster. 
---
I'd pick whichever one I saw more qualified for the job, regardless of age. Infact alot of older people in some industries refuse to change their methods, stuck in their ways so to speak, and wont adapt more modern practices for things. Where as often times younger people are more open to try different things, or think outside of the box. 
---
You didn't say where to go tho

Duos are pretty awful points per hour in my opinion. Ideally until you guys are fully kitted out I'd recommend trying to find a crew to run regular 4+1s. You can get those down to sub 24 even w/o max gear. Once you've both got bows and lances duos become a bit more bearable. But if you aren't worried about that then just go for it.
---
Keep in mind Duos are a bit more complex than your regular three man, and at least one of you (preferably your mage) will need to know how to do what is commonly called 'mage-set special skips.' to keep special attacks from happening but also to turn the head regularly. So that the damage is split between you.
---
Oh yes grand exchange
---
I would like to say that I understand that it sets a bad precedent for RWT. I don't believe that it is right for them to RWT. I also don't believe it's right for them to just suffer. But I do believe in compassion and some of this shit and rudeness is just so unnecessary wtf. i just don't think it's that hard to mind your own business sometimes tbh.

The SEO results would be better if Jagex linked the new wiki in their site with follow tag, because Jagex'es sites have quite a decent rating in Page Rank. Also, .wiki domains aren't treaties well by Google - so that's that.

The same people that are hating on Venezuelan gold farmers are the same ones that want open boarders. Your not ok with them playing your video game to survive but you are ok with illegal aliens coming into your country and doing the same thing.

Illegal aliens hurt your country's economy just like they hurt RuneScape's.

Go run back to your safe space and the delusional grandiose fantasy land you live in where you believe UIM, HCIM's etc should be able to go into the wilderness with absolutely no risk and get a free pass 100% of the time. PKer isnt scummy, this is 100% the UIM's fault no matter how much you want to try and shift the blame to the PKer and call him a scumbag, judge him, insult him etc.

April fools idea: before training any skill, you get a dialogue option that says, "There is nothing to gain from _____. Do you want to do it anyway?"

Yeah agreed you gotta at least marinate it in some acid (think that‚Äôs the word for it) and oil. Makes a huge difference. 
---
Also you can roll it with a rolling pin when it‚Äôs in a big/covered in wax paper and that evens it out and makes it easier to cook - otherwise the skinny bits will be cooked through more than the big bits

dragon bolts. They're slept on and if you buy low and sell high can easily profit for break even. I made almost 50m 84-99 fletching doing dragon bolts and its 1m-1.5m/hr without mousekeys. Buying them takes some time though if you want to save$ but even if you insta buy you wont lose much.

Thank you, I'll check it out here in a bit. Also, I may take you up on that offer! 
---
Oh nice then. I just assumed it was on a pure. But cant anyone get a kc even with deaths on all rooms?
---
I mean, that argument could be made for any unlimited teleport items we have in the game. "It's so easy to get them though!".
---
If it is that easy, that only goes to show that having one that's unlimited wouldn't have any major effect on the game. It's for convenience.
---
A very big Good Luck to you sir!
---
Yeah, literally all my money comes from mining. MLM is super chill, I could spend years there.
---
I don't know what it is about mining I love, I think is the feeling of "stacking" up resources, feels super good to have like 20+ k coal and other minerals in my bank.
---
Your mentality is the cancer of the world.
---
Make the Slayer helm mute the obnoxious chat messages like "YOUR DRAGONFIRE SHIELD IS ALREADY FULLY CHARGED" every 2 seconds
---
High level ultimates usually have more items than can fit in their inventory and looting bag, so occasionally they'll store most of the shit they don't need in Zulrah/Vorkath. If they had any items held for them in this system and then they die elsewhere, the items in Zulrah/Vorkath get deleted. The items in your inventory would be completely fine, but anything extra stored outside of the inventory would be deleted.
---
Lol yeah, I know statistically I am not overdue yet, but I feel sad when people flex their sub-10 kill zenytes xD
---
Now i just have to grind out the slayer points.. 
---
Yes but who‚Äôll take you through it knowing you‚Äôll get 3+ deaths lmao 
---
For sure, I'll still bitch when I get killed while doing a clue scroll but it's fair play.

Your reasoning is exactly why he does it, it's the same as people with expensive gear saying doubling money or asking for donations.

Cannoning them in taverly dungeon while ranging is absurdly fast xp. I prefer demonics but they are really not that bad of a task as long as you cannon them. Would suggest skipping/blocking if you're too cheap for cannon.

Stop that

That still requires me to travel to Eluned.

Gz!!! Makes me happy to see there may actually be a light at the end of the tunnel
---
Oh don't get me wrong, my problem with those new trees inside Prifddinas isn't everything about their existence; it's more about the lack of consideration for consistency. Yes, it's reasonable for them to be a tad different, but the way they're modeled without textures and painted with sharply-contrasting greens creates some visual whiplash because they exist beside those low-poly, low-res-textured trees just outside.
---
A really important thing to keep in mind always is that OSRS is very unlikely to receive a major graphical uplift that puts everything on even ground, so there is a certain degree of consistency to be upheld and some restraint to be exerted when designing visuals that exist right beside those that were created back in 2007. That's why those particular trees irk me but not the entirety of Zeah.
---
(That goes for animations too; our characters will forever move like bad stop-motion, so if it were up to me I'd make sure new NPC's didn't move too fluidly outside of bosses.)
---
It isn't, especially on ftp worlds. I encounter pkers on a daily basis while chilling in bandit camp on my wild-only UIM. Sure, it's more dead than is was back in 2007, but you would be surprised what an ftp ranger can do if you aren't prepared.

I've done some testing and this bug exists for all stackables. It is most noticeable with expensive stackables. You can replicate it with seeds or darts.

It happens when there is more than one stackable and the stackables are the first or second most expensive item.

It creates some rather odd interactions.

Ironmen play a limited game mode to make the game more difficult for themselves, them having more content doesn't affect anyone else.

The real issue with RWT is that it encourages gold farming which in turn has a pretty significant impact on the economy. In the past, we've seen items like Dragon bones plummet due to gold farming en masse. This can be unhealthy for the game. Moreover, some gold farmers bring actual coins into the game, potentially contributing to inflation. Whether or not inflation is an issue is debatable, but it should be obvious from these examples how RWT can adversely affect the community as a whole. If RWT did not affect the economy and was conducted in a completely legitimate manner (i.e. bonds), I think you would find many players to be more accepting, even if they do not participate in RWT themselves.

You still need to pay attention to the falling boulders, sometimes you can't be sure of which style it is going to use until after it chunks you a 35, not to mention switching your own gear and your protection prayers AND piety/rigour. I can do zulrah by paying just as much attention as I do when I runecraft, gorillas are way more attention demanding due to their random nature vs zulrah's list of set rotations which is narrowed down to two after the third "spawn", and then down to one depending on where the range phase spawns.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
And the drug is runescape
---
1. That's why I called it lame
---
2. "Some people play for fun" doesn't even apply when you're comparing training cooking with wines vs cooking with sharks. It's not like something like "It's a waste of time to play castle wars, that's inefficient." It's a simple cost-benefit difference where it makes no sense to give up a significant amount of xp for negligible profit compared to actual dedicated money makers.
---
Nobody is watching their character cook sharks "for fun," so don't pretend like you are.

I've played runescape through some Rocky times. Removal of free trade and the wildy, EOC and Mtx  and it has never really crossed my mind that it could just disappear.
