Dude. I tried doing this last night with a maple bow scammer....I brought Addy Arrows p+++ because he gave me rune arrows. I thought I was so smart and going to scam the scammer, but he brought darts and fucked me up. I lost my cash stack of 10m and he was level 22....I'm 82. Fml
---
Also, with Song of the Elves there is a new hunting area for red chins
---
I once crashed while dropping items during the fremnick quests and logged back into the wrong world, when I found the right world all my items were still there
---
Bro omg. Make pk‚Äôd spades a different item that stacks. Combine 50 of those item ornament kits

Usually it's made that way to prevent hackers ex : same thing as iPhones with incorrect password attempts . Unfortunately it doesn't matter what ip they / you are on , it's a global number ./ chances .
---
I didn‚Äôt make this post to say ‚Äúhey you guys should try this‚Äù if it was still working I wouldn‚Äôt post it on reddit lol. It worked once and then that 1 guy told all the other scammers and they all started telling me to bank my imps. It was a one time deal cannot be replicated for the 10th time I‚Äôve said in this thread..... yeesh
---
You hate to see it.
---
If you have fairly decent melee stats definitely melee them in the catacombs.

I'm kinda confused of why there has been a huge rise in JoJo memes since the serie is like 33 years old or something... But I won't conplain lol.
---
Even in classoc you could duel anyone anywhere.
---
I'll just log out right then and there quaking in my boots
---
They're directly correlating it to the assembler/accumilator by adding the ammo collecting feature so what's the point of even adding it when it's obvious that the better option is just using the assembler/accumilator instead of the cape.
---
Didn't really answer my question but ok

Recently came back after a break and while using osbuddy my inventory highlights all 28 spaces every time I touch or drag an item.  How to disable? I can‚Äôt find it in settings.  Thanks
---
Everyone who replied to you is a noob who speculates without knowing history. Just appreciate him. You don't know what kind of hell this place is without him.
---
Never in my post did I say make the cape have the same offensive stats as the assembler before you use Vorkath's head on the cape
---
don't stake idiot...of course you lost money
---
Lmao Klin Capes, even before EoC klin was almost as easy as fight caves cuz of those OP crystals
---
Whatever I guess the cape is fucking useless and I'll never use it
---
I don‚Äôt think it changes the math, but one was a double chest, the coif and one of the legs
---
i dont think someone is trying to hijack your account, i and others have been facing this issue for weeks now, but since its just a small minority of people its happening to, no light is being shed on the situation, i have been looking for a fix for a while and i cant find anything but other threads asking about this problem too to no avail.
---
Proud of u bb, but why the fUCK did it take me 106 kills to get a Bottomless Compost Bucket??
---
Until someone uses a standard android emulator with a mouse. It would be virtually impossible to stop that.
---
It isn‚Äôt useless though? At certain places it‚Äôs best in slot, hydra, dks many places you prefer the prayer bonus over the damage bonus.
---
I just tried using a VPN and it worked!
---
I think a good rough upgrade path is Bigger and Badder &gt; setting up your block list &gt; slayer rings &gt; extending tasks or something like that.
---

---
If you're an ironman, picking up broader fletching early is handy since it is a pretty big dps boost over the bone crossbow. If you're a regular account you can just buy the bolts from the ge without unlocking it. And a magic shortbow (i) with rune arrows is often better dps for non-irons anyway.
---
Is that it?
---
I was gonna say what‚Äôs the point in hiding toxic bros name

That‚Äôs pretty sweet dude!

No shit sherlock, have u ever read any of his tweets?
---
Posting on the top comment again just to make this very clear
---
DO NOT TRY TO ANTI SCAM THESE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY NOT WITH THE SAME METHOD YOU SEE IN THE VIDEO. I DID NOT POST THIS WITH THE INTENTION OF GETTING OTHER PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND TRY IT. I HIGHLY DISCOURAGE THAT
---
IT ONLY WORKED ONCE AND THEN ALL THE SCAMMERS KNEW ABOUT IT AND WOULD NO LONGER DUEL ME WITH IMPLINGS IN MY INVENTORY.  THERE ISNT ANY OTHER WAY TO OUTSMART THESE SCAMMERS THEY KNOW ALL OF THE TRICKS IN THE BOOK AND ARE ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD. 
---
NEVER TRUST ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU ABOUT ANTI SCAMMING. THEY ARE ALSO SCAMMERS. KEEP PRIVATE CHAT SET TO FRIENDS SO THEY CANT EVEN PM YOU. DONT PLAY WITH FIRE AND STAY SAFE pls.
---
Same dude! And at the same level :P
---
Needless to say i stood there like a fucking idiot over my loot wondering wth was happeneing and got tbed and smited by a clan
---
Okay yeah I guess
---
Where you on a pvp world or were you on mobile?
---
It's still kind of blue balls if you ask me
---
i think it has something to do with the internet you're connecting with i just dont understand how shiit works enough to piece it to together lol.
---
just any free vpn?i dont want to pay for a service to be able to play tbh lol

Yea the meme never made sense but I was mining iron with the view on mobile vertical and saw how big it gets.

So you‚Äôre telling me I should take msb (I) into the inferno?

Oh no they're making bad moneymakers on a video game even worse while trying to feed their children, those monsters

what ever happened to the month ahead posts? rs3 still has them. 
---
I don't even know what's upcoming this month except for runefest.

hahaha hes kinda quirky doe but i wamna be kinda quirky doe too so imma type based because i see all the 4chan kids doing it hahahha

Barrage on defensive for that sick def xp

Well luckily for them nmz is still a thing in 2019 so they can just afk max combat while doing literally anything and then kill any monster for stupid amounts of money

What are the best Free to play quests in old school runescape?

(This is jeopardy right?)

Is that the only attack you can throw brother? Come at me with your worst. :*

It‚Äôs just supply and demand. There is less available then there is wanted, so those selling can set a price, that‚Äôs not manipulation, that‚Äôs an economy.

damn i have 99 herblore, i was going to do relleka till 90 n then ardy however if priff is that good i'm deffo gonna do it! only problem is buying the super combat pots, and hopefully the prices don't change too much, atm ive worked out id profit 48m 80-99 with marks of grace, i wonder what it would be with crystals
---
You'd be correct. I'm still new to OSRS/this subreddit.

If you're reheating leftovers, you can use a cup of water to displace the heat and cook it a bit evenly, I'm sure it will work for most things in a microwave. It's a life saving if you enjoy hot pockets

wanted to look nooby ;)
---
The lack of GE made me quit OSRS on release and go back to RS3. I simply do not enjoy old-style trading.
---
Ironically enough I'm an ironman now so I don't use the GE either way.
---
took 15 minutes for an ultimate force to spawn and free me from this madness
---
To be fair, a lot of us are stupid and playing like we did back in the day.
---
Rune arrows were stupid expensive compared to RCB and Broad bolts.
---
They are super cheap now
---
This
---
What happened with godzerker1?
---
I'd do that, but i'm a veteran who knows how good end game is, I would have the motivation to do it. What about an actual new player? What if someone told them they should just sit in a shitty minigame for 2 months straight until they have max combat stats?
---
That‚Äôs too many oak larders for me

Yes it's supply and demand, but it's such a large increase in such a small amount of time. A few hours ago I bought a couple 100 tablets for less than 500 gp each, and now I couldn't buy one for 3k. That's completely abnormal

You'd still just want to use dragon boots for the offensive bonus. It's not like it takes more than... 5 p pots or something stupid for a bloodveld task.

I'm guessing you'd lose the gear and runes.
---
I train melee in a trimmed fm cape.
---
(btw)
---
Is this a jojo meme?
---
I was same as you but I actually took the time to fix it up a little and it's much more satisfying. 
---
I made the armors, runes and potions all look nice and made tabs, the tabs was the nice part. 
---
Tab for all armor and weapons, tab for all runes and teleports, tab for all my potions and herbs, a tab that I put any loot from slayer tasks in and then a misc tab for anything junk.
---
Much more appealing to look at and you feel kinda good about urself after. 
---
And also USE PLACEHOLDERS.  Items going straight back to where you left them is very handy for keeping track of stuff
---
Wow genius, why didn‚Äôt I think of this!?
---
One sec gotta update mobile app
---
Yeah I guess it's a very subjective thing.
---
I personally did Relekka 80-89, then boosted with pies for 89 to 90 at Ardounge. After that, slow crawl at Ardounge until 99
---
Ok I'm here brah
---
I see all the memes but to be honest I‚Äôve never been effected by any of the bugs or mess ups
---
Not NMZ at all he has no stats for quests
---
Search the corpse.
---
Aka the JoJo letters
---
Yeah, op found a straight brainlet scammer, those guys are normally super smart. You can try brining in a fletching cape with some bronze bolts so you can spawn a c bow, they won't accept
---
It's patched now, but you used to be able to take in a blowpipe, then unload the darts and use them, they would see through that too, they know every trick in the book.
---
It's so hard to get anything past the guys that do this scam, so the fact this one saw an inventory of imp jars and just went with it is fucking hilarious.
---
Exactly, and I‚Äôd be extremely pissed off. Death mechanics aren‚Äôt going to stop bots. Maybe impose the trade limit from back in the day on RS2 for account below a certain total level.
---
Idk man that's what I'm saying it's never viable. If you're going to be adding random perks to skill capes then at least make it more useful. It's literally just replecating another item but without the offensive stats but with the default prayer you already get making it useless in most situations.
---
Zulrah would probably be your next goal
---
Not gonna bother to look it up but it is. I can already tell he‚Äôs done lost city, fight arena and witches house
---
Garbage cc
---
Thats the entire point of his account I think
---
wait
---
The scam is that he gives you a bow and arrows. I believe it's a maple bow w/ rune arrows. You're not able to fire rune arrows out of a maple bow so the level 27 just kills you while you're unable to do anything.
---
Dex scrolls have been shooting up to 60 mil at the end of the past 2 months though. So there is a pattern for it.
---
Seth Rogan lookin ass

Congrats my dude

got my pair first med clue. i think i used up all the luck in my life for that one

I hit 98 earlier today, I‚Äôve lost hope to get my farming pet :( good on you tho man, gz!

ü¶Äü¶Ä$11ü¶Äü¶Ä

Guessing the idea is that you then trust them and start asking about the details, then that leads to you getting scammed in some way
---
Are you logging in to world 345, the permanent deadman world? That's an entirely separate world with a separate save.
---
youre not supposed to get it until like 60m xp doing herbs or like 100m doing trees
---
I PK in edge BH all the time, it's great. Just like back in the day except with emblems

Dont forget Matt from wii sports
---
Yeah I think base is 64-65mil xp, over 35 between both accounts though and I‚Äôd love that pet.
---
Yeah fuck these guys. I'm okay with them farming their stuff manually. But fuck them scamming and botting.
---
I think the streaming content would be pretty good too
---
I report everyone that says that. I think they're bots because it's always someone different and it's pretty frequent. I didn't see their target do anything so there's 0 reason to believe them and report their target.
---
I‚Äôll do the same if that‚Äôs alright. 110 combat, almost base 90 melees and 79 mage/range. Rsn is ChokeMeJaddy
---
Thanks I hate it

Yeah I‚Äôve been knocking out a bunch of tree runs this week and was getting progressively more depressed as I realized it wasn‚Äôt happening. Lol.  Best of luck!

This is fucking RS Classic

Bless you

Welp, now they'll bring runes. Thanks OP

They get $14 out of me a month for a 12 year old browser game.

They should be grateful to me.

You‚Äôre more than welcome dude! Just join the cc anytime and tell them I sent you
---
Thanks man! I‚Äôve gotten lucky with boss pets but not skilling ones lol all under drop rate except for Kraken
---
I was just doing this achievement, check the piscarilius wiki guide and read everything carefully. It's an annoying minigame and it was dead content on arrival, but at least you only have to do it once.
---
shoulda replied with the Jojo `yes yes yes yes... YES` clip
---
And during those blackouts dragon bone prices were the lowest they had been in a while and didn't go up. If the volume they traded so drastically changed prices wouldn't the bones have went up during the time? 
---
Dragon bones just aren't that good anymore, despite being one of the main items bot farms and other things, their trade volume has dropped significantly over the past year.

Same. You can convert the rest of it to money after getting the rune pouch (although I decided to leave the points in there).

Not here. Here is a lawless wasteland where having shite opinions or obnoxious things to say gets downvoted to the deepest depths of hell.

Also, Nice. Trains defy all logic

I didnt even smile to these memes
---
Oh well.. there's no way I'm going to start all over.

If you are looking for someone I can also help I only have 36 kc but know must of the stuff and have plenty of people who like doing Learners as well. We Do Raids Discord, like mentioned above is also a great place to start. 
---
If you want to add me on osrs shoot me a DM on here and I'll get you my added
---
Honestly, if you can get through 1-77, 77-99 is tolerable being that Zeah runecrafting is pretty damn afk. Just my opinion though.
---
If you have to take on a sponsor we totally understand.
---
Search the high scores then. 
---
Search yourself on both runescape and oldschool runescape. 
---
Jagex don‚Äôt reset accounts.
---
Configure the F keys to better suit you too, using the in-game settings. You want inventory (ESC works for inventory too), attack style, prayers and spellbook set so you can switch between them.
---
The f2p LMS worlds also have more inexperienced players, from what I heard.
---
Congratulations, dude! I just got my first 99 (firemaking as well!) on my skiller. So stoked!

Yeah I was at the wrong one but I was at the SOUTH WESTERN house at first like he SAID. It ended up being there south eastern house. For fucks sake wtf.

So called harassment in the wildy should be 100 percent legal no exceptions.

If he doesn't we will riot.

Gotta be the luckiest task ever. Grats.

If you‚Äôre in a rough financial spot that you can‚Äôt afford 11$ then maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be playing runescape and trying to better your situation lol

We do raids is a good start, but it's awesome to have a reliable bank of raids teammates who always split drops.  "Galaxy Clan" cc in game has learner cox/tob several times a week .  Good luck!

Nice claws

Thanks! Those were from Halloween:)
---
I can smell sweat just from looking at this picture thru my phone

It was in the screenshot with Hans,  top left with the runelite tag as it was a screenshot of the whole window.
---
i hate my body's sensitivity to DHT.
---
My btw finished zulrah in 275 kc with 2 extra onyx‚Äôs and an extra helm lol. Deironed at 1960 total tho
---
Doesn‚Äôt it cost like 50k though?
---
They are both are doing something wrong and should be stopped. I can at least sympathize with the gold farmers who are just trying make a living and dont hate them for doing it but I still believe they are breaking the rules of the game and should be stopped.
---
RuneScapes official client, runelite, or osbuddy?
---
Don‚Äôt worry I talked to Jennifer and got another mould
---
Its definently tolerable but it sure aint enjoyable
---
This is the internet, so your opinion doesn't really mean shit. Happy Labor Day!
---
but it was a 47 second clip, lol
---
I think RuneScapes official
---
we already have that its called the zgs
---
The Karil's crossbow was always functionally similar to a shortbow.  So it really stopped at 70.  
---
And the BP was supposed to be another shortbow type weapon anyways.  But they compared shortbow (rapid) to darts/blowpipe (accurate) in the original DevBlog for some strange reason.
---
Yeah i had the worst time getting to 77 and after that its been smooth sailing.
---
The GE isn't a 1-1 economy. Jagex clearly keeps many of the bells and whistles hidden under the covers. Even something like the automatic "average price" rather than just listing the cheapest available price someone has put the items up for is hugely influential when determining "Price" of an item.
---
Additionally, the blackout wasn't necessarily long enough to really HAVE an effect on price because while Venezuelan farming might be a huge percentage of any given item, demand might simply not be high enough to exhaust available reserves before the Venezuelans reconnected.
---
It‚Äôs really only dust/smoke devils as the salve e is better than slayer helm on spectres.

Wait did you delete your old post and repost it with pkers instead of pvmers?
---
that's true. I always skip spectres
---
Kc?
---
who tf brings a cape switch to harambes? Range cape is weird bc assembler exists but its fine tbh. Better than fire cape for sure.
---
Yeah I wish Rs3 was just this. Instead of claymation weird fest
---
I got it on 500kc gl
---
Super funny and your UIM is really sick. Lost it when you were ranked 9 to complete the 69
---
So obviously I can never gain xp again. Does anyone have any other game recommendations?
---
Lmao alright bootlicker
---
I‚Äôm just saying we don‚Äôt *have* to be grateful, because we pay their bills. Also ironic calling me a little shit when you spell worse than my 6 year old brother. 
---
I feel you need to grow up and shut up, it would seem a lot more people agree with me than you.
---
Policing who can be apart of the community is also fucking hilarious. The joys of being 10 again.
---
Blowpipe beats out both of those in a lot of situations, blowpipe is a lot more versatile too
---
My mom bought me membership. And then she got herself membership. Some of my best memories are running nature's for her while she was trying to get 99 rc. Sometimes we'd play into the evening and she'd realize we'd forgotten to start dinner so we got pizza or kfc and kept gaming.
---
‚ÄúNo good money makers for low levels‚Äù lmao last I checked running essence is 2-4m an hour and has almost no reqs
---
I just got another one at 190 lol
---
I was just going to sleep as I posted this.. any luck?
---
You learned hard work and discipline and you got yourself through school. You also learned not to be the same adult as those adults in your life at the time. I'd say if you lived a different life, you would lack the perspective you now carry and maybe wouldn't have been that cool uncle you now yearn to be. 
---
If I were you, I'd feel some power/pride in where you're at. Kudos man.
---
This is the slippery slope I hear so many people go down since just starting out cox raids in 'we do raids' lmao.
---
With Runescape membership being $11 but a month membership via bonds costs $4 thru the RWT websites, I am surprised Jagex doesnt take action.
---
Then again someone has to pay full price for the bond anyway so they do get their money, but I feel it is not right.
---
Runecrafting!
---
I just got another leather at 190 lol
---
Runecrafting.
---
Thats basicslly my bank. Even the mithril grapple is there.
---

---
I was looking at the wiki page and saw it had the special attack listed, despite it [not being there](https://i.imgur.com/Rdek3ra.png) when I looked at the special attack tab/orb.
---
I thought it was a bug so I hopped on the regular client to check, and it wasn't there... genuinely thought it'd have it but I guess you explain it well, really scummy of Jagex to mislead players like that.
---
It's just toilet paper scraps dude

Ever tried frozen macaroni and cheese? Same thing. XD

Yea I joined it talked for a little

---
Ur delusional lol
---
explain
---
I always thought that monster weakness and defensive stats mattered more at lower player combat levels. Stabbing with a slightly weaker weapon is sometimes much better than slashing with a scimitar. I'd try looking on a dps calculator if you really want to get to the bottom of it.
---
Thats why i said half the healing, half the healing vs NPCs if it's that OP that's what the devs are for
---
Meh. It was one of the quests I held space through and didn't have that good of a plot to me.
---
75 atk for arclight, 75 range for bp and you should be fine. Whip or tent whip can suffice if you don't have an arclight, but arclight is really good
---
You can honestly get by with just swapping bp and arclight+defender but feel free to bring as many gear swaps as you're comfortable with. With minimal gear swaps I just bring blessed dhide body, verac's skirt, slayer helm, and an assembler
---
SGS is insanely useful at gorillas for extending trips
---
Thanks for being thoughtful!
---
I liked it just was to focus on the quest I was doing to talk a lot.  Haha
---
Every big game with money on the line has ddosing. Other mmos don't give other people the chance to loot your stuff.
---
I kind of liked the mismatched gear, you know who isnt playing fashionscape and who is playing for results based on gear.
---
Nice

I recommend ammonite crabs instead, fewer pures/bots/people in general, but yeah crabs are generally good if you just want some melee xp

Nice name

Let introduce a bandos helm but its bright blue with hearts... or we could continue the theme and not be a massive gobshite
---
Good question. It's hard to say tbh.
---
Like I said elsewhere in this thread I would do 1-2 runs before leaving for work. Then I would do one after getting home from work and one before going to bed. So that's 3-4 runs a day already.
---
So, including those 3-4 runs I would probably do 6-9 runs a day realistically. But it depends.
---
On the weekend (not including friday) I did up to 14 runs a day.
---
Of course there would be days on which I did not get around to do more than those 3-4 runs, for example when attending family gatherings.
---
The cool thing about that would that you can very clearly see how the video lengths will grow exponentially.
---
This looks like childish gambino from the ‚Äúthis is America‚Äù music video
---
You should totally start doing those bird house runs!
---
You'll be 50 in like 4 days. It takes no effort!

I needed to learn to earn most of my stuff as well when i was a kid. But it helped alot that my dad had a business so i basically could clean his office for like 5-10‚Ç¨.

Is it possible at all to be lower than 100cb with a diary Cape?
---
It depends how focused you are, but around ~1,300 bodies and ~1,600 legs per hour.
---
Fishing or woodcutting, both good while watching movies
---
The rank 9 at the end to complete the 69 is just way too good hahahahaha
---
No TOB items?
---
what is your gear and inventory set up like?
---
Make spade into an actual weapon so we clue hunters can fight against pkers.
---
And then they released Song of the Elves which copied one quest and brought in Elemis from two others xD
---
Haha fuck

Same dude from other guys post about some ‚Äúcrasher ‚Äú getting pet? Awesome RNG!!!
---
Hi kappadar big fan!!
---
Jagex should use feet pics as a new account verification feature
---
Looks like you can fill the "find whiny bitch on reddit" task early
---
Most players who track their metrics use RuneLite, which even tells you the exact square you died on.
---
Haha I don‚Äôt think so I try to be respectful anywhere I‚Äôm grinding if somebody‚Äôs there I‚Äôll hop :) in fact I had just gotten crashed the kill before this and had hopped then got pet! Ha!
---
ironman
---
This is the general impression I get.
---
I guess I don‚Äôt understand the crashing aspect still though. I‚Äôve received unpleasant comments from other players for joining their game and bumping the party size from 3 or 4  to 4 or 5 players.
---
The game is designed as an open venue. Demanding a world to be locked down to your 3-4 friends is in my opinion childish. It would be like demanding an ice rink to only allow your group of friends to be allowed on the ice. (And again, everybody that participates receives roughly the same amount of loot. The griefing aspect of crashing at bosses isn‚Äôt present at Zalcano.)
---
This dun scared the shit out of me
---
Can't wait to see you cook an Anglerfish. Those things are massive.
---
Someone‚Äôs bitter. Cleaned?
---
It's so hard to tell what's a meme and what's serious on this sub. There's no way msb is higher dps than acb with full armadyl. Unless the (i) specifically buffs it to ridiculous high hell
---
nah thats the fastest way
---
somone should tell swampletics
---
Pre sure he has 99 in defence from females
---
Walter White?
---
U wont
---
Alright, cool. It isnt too slow, just want to make sure I am doing it right, I feel like people are very judgemental and I really want a torso lol.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You mean right click right? Like the order they come in?
---
So what am I suppose to do ? Start all over ? I'm good, not worth it.
---
I never did those before maxing and after maxing I'm even LESS inclined to do anything. I fucking love it
---
‚ÄúWhy does it cost money to use a service?‚Äù I know I‚Äôll take a picture with my phone and post to reddit to moan. 
---
You have a phone mate, just play it on that.
---
Yeah, they used to be even more back in the day
---
I need more runescape food in my life. Please continue doing this, OP.
---
superworms, i think its actually what king worms are based off due to how similar they look
---
The word is ‚Äòungrateful‚Äô.
---
Take a good long look at yourself in the mirror. Then shut the tuck up cause you look way worse.
---
I‚Äôll shut the tuck up, don‚Äôt you worry that pretty little head of yours, sweetheart
---
Oh, do you not understand it? It means "therefore." 
---
Don't worry, most monkeys like to hit things they don't understand.
---
Well, not in my country at least. Most PC games were like $30 at most.
---
Classic WoW Ironman
---
You are right. I made a new edit showcasing more setups.
---
Who uses the word "weeb" unironically these days? Pretty dumb if you ask me.
---
BOT-ARO?! B-BAKANA!
---
i had to pay for it myself AND I had to beg my mom to get membership. Back then got it in 3 month packages and over bank transfer so it took at least 24 hours to activate too.
---
I think the suggestion is if you learn which ones are the left click options, then you just need to click the horn once to call those instead of right clicking, checking the options, then clicking again. It would end up being very slightly faster.
---
nice
---
Cape and pet! I'm hyped haha
---
Do you understand what I mean? Similar to a shift + click, it would be quicker than a double press, and wouldn't delay single presses.
---
That‚Äôs what all of us did dude. If you can‚Äôt handle it then don‚Äôt play, you won‚Äôt be missed.
---
those arent bandos boots but guardian boots, they're okay.
---
Your moms paid your membership...? I paid mines always myself. My mom was so against me playing RuneScape... She thought as a 9/10yo I was never be able to raise 6‚Ç¨ a month by my own. She was so wrong. 
---
Went looking for those beer bottles and "sold" Them back to the store. (That's a thing here in the Netherlands) 
---
Sometimes it took me a whole weekend just for 6‚Ç¨. But it was so worth it. We also have those big plastic bottles. Those are 25cent each. Jackpot! Ones whilest looking for bottles near a river, in the bushes I found a stolen "loan?" bike from a store which you can loan if they are repairing your current bike.. I got 50‚Ç¨ for that. Those times are golden man... Wish life was still that simple
---
Good. Cause you should shut the fuck up. :)
---
If you wanted to try and do a version that might taste nice you could user watermelon essence/flavouring instead of pieces of watermelon. I used about 50g of cornflour in mine and it was still too watery
---
THIS IS A REPOST FROM r/runescape
---
1) not everyone makes 30$/h, in fact almost nobody does. 2) If you're endgame a bond takes like 40min to get lol.
---
Want a fedora?
---
anything where you dont spend most of your time doing utterly senseless shit like this
---
Congratulations :)
---
If you read my comments, you'd realise that if I were a botter it wouldn't influence my income by much. I'd have a bunch of accounts earning money at that moment, so one of them getting lower income wouldn't make a big difference.
---
If you really want to screw up botters, make a couple of accounts and go to varrock mines and steal their iron or something.
---
Nah make it the sandwich lady.
---
Judging by your level of butthurt, I imagine you‚Äôre probably the fuckboy in the pic.
---
Low alch yourself, noob.

He just came here to flex his superior intellect on us, respect the man /s

What he said. Vorkath can become a bit of a snooze fest after a while but is better money for sure. Save up for that rigour and dhcb
---
Edit: I think tracers are red or orange in general also. Not sure without looking stuff up, I  think there might be a color system for the AR platform rounds.

runescape before jagex?üßê

If jagex is cheating on me I dont wanna know.

Haha

Isn't that a Runelite thing?
---
?

doesn't help if it gave more than 100xp
---
&gt;Trivialise runecrafting 
---
&gt;withdraw all function exists
---
It‚Äôs not going to make it any easier.
---
word, I just bought berserker ring to imbue as my first so I only have like 7 mil left which i need for merching.  
---
Gonna save up a bit more and then level up and get the crystal saw.
---
It was easier than OP is making out. I started playing in 2001, and I look back fondly on hitting up Varrock West Bank on World 1. It was always full or near full and there was always people selling what you were looking for.
---
Unless this was a new scammer scam, some one messaged "the scammer" and "taught" him to scam and said get that guy, knowing he would bring imp jars and probably win that fight.
---
My mum didn't optionally pay for membership, I had to call up at 2am and buy membership over the phone.

Gonna attempt my final two tasks for my hard Lumbridge diary.
---
I love how IVP/ Insight Venture Partners ended up a banned phrase on the official forums, back when people still used them in like 2011 üòÇ
---
No
---
ill sell you 20 of them for 700m each
---
Some barrows arrows aswell
---
Don‚Äôt have 700m right now praying for it to go 600m because the runite grind I‚Äôm doing will only get me to 600m and I‚Äôll be burnt out then but don‚Äôt they insta sell on be for 705m right now
---
And btw how tf u get 14 bill I find 100m as really really hard to make
---
Jagex will still ban them.
---
Are you planning to renew the negative xp lamp reward idea? If so, could you please elaborate on the future plans how and when is it going to be implemented? Yours truly, failed pure.
---
Yeah dailies stuck, too many in ffxiv when though it's a fantastic game. It's nice to face the freedom to do what you want. Farming is basically dailies the skill though lol but it's not terrible.

Oh yeah Feather man is sick, he's been on my friend's list for decades

How do you feel about using a % of the Duel arena tax to spare and use that to buy items from the GE and delete them. This would work as an item sink + no gp would be added to the game (GE tax could work too).
---
This comment section is a mess
---
Green tipped ammo typically has 65 grain steel penetration cores. This means it has way better penetration for shooting at targets behind light walls and things like that. Tracer rounds are typically denoted by orange tips.
---
How so
---
youre most likely still far better off than said freaks

Ranging stats and def?
---
You have like 14 comments replying to the main post and not tied to anything, looks super messy
---
90/90 tbow, arma, ddarts/darrows rigor etc
---
Woox does it without armour and only 2 food. Hardcore gauntlet is not to hard, and it can be completed every round. 
---
I'd recommend you to get 1 ranged level 3 weapon and utilise a facepunch on the last hurt before he changes protection prayer, so you can always hurt him with your 1 level 3 weapon. It gets fairly easy after u get the hang of it.
---
Can you comment on the state of bots, in particular the overwhelming amount that are now visible throughout the entirety of the game? Kinda depressing when you realise just how many of them there are.
---
I reckon 35 minutes for you, maybe 40
---
idk if to upvote or downvote
---
Tyvm!
---
Not going to downvote this, but I personally would much prefer black graceful to be an accolade, like you killed under a specific time, a certain amount of times, etc.
---
One thing i‚Äôd find really interesting would be to kill every boss in the game using only pre-determined, period specific weapons and armour available on the bosses release
---
Its gonna be really slow and really tedious with 75 stats.  Try to get up to 85 at least if you plan on grinding them for zenytes
---
Ive got 650kc, 2 pegasian, 1 eternal 0 prims, I'm never lucky in this game unfortunately :(
---
How many rev kc to get every unique? I'm assuming protected and skulled?
---
Assembler has a +2 range strength bonus.

I totally agree dude, dudeskins be queer eye for the runescape guy

"Alright cool that's enough for today, I'ma go now"

You could always try doing them on phone like I am :D I‚Äôm slowly going mad trying to do just the regular one
---
Yeah because everyone whose parents limited access to the home computer in the 2000s and only purchased them a mobile phone when they were around 14 or 15 is now severely disadvantaged and lost in society.  
---
As we all know, you have to spend your early childhood glued to a tablet and a computer in order to be successful! Totally not like that causes social issues, depression, anxiety...
---
You should probably do some background work &amp; work the joke out before crying on the osrs subreddit about him.

 when you have arclight and blowpipe and 75+ stats.
---
Can you please only answer 2-3 questions, and spend the rest of the stream playing music, playing kahoot, showing pictures of hentai artists' work, and accidentally call eachother by real names?
---
Why you you always ignore the questions regarding grotesque guardians? This boss's 100% needs a rework and people ask this I every single qna, it is one of the top rated comments but you never address it. Why?
---
This is a MID-LEVEL boss - kills should not take 2+ mins for an maxed player with BIS. Please address this boss - if you simply don't want too, explain why not.
---
There seems to be an appetite for buffing the Elder Maul directly considering how rare it is. Currently it is very underwhelming in its effectiveness to dispatch high defence monsters weak to crush. The scythe/bludgeon are often better alternatives than a weapon as rare as a twisted bow.
---
I have discussed two buffs to the maul, one being that it applies a small, but cumulative defence reduction on successful hits or that it has a 33% chance to double hit on big monsters (3x3 or larger). The second buff would not make it competitive with the dps weapons on low defence opponents, but would make it better than the scythe on tekton up until 3 dwh hits have been applied.
---
Would the team/community at large be interested in a different way to buff the maul?
---
thanks. i hate it
---
This happened to me once at bandos, guy came in snatched a single kill and got tassys.
---
Ok that makes sense
---
You can make plenty of money with little to no requirements. You can make 500k/h with 17 hunter and a couple hundred k starting cash. Pretty much every mid-low tier item is cheap these days too so you don't really need to do much money making.
---
Is there more quests in development in the Mahjarrat series?

It's actually a 40% spec, but yes it is rather useless.

Someone send this to mod Kieren to get on next weeks Q&amp;A
---
if you were any type of chad you wouldnt be posting on a runescape reddit thread thats for sure
---
For solo bossing, set dragon slayer 2 as a goal - your 99 range will make slaying avorkath very profitable.
---
  
---
If you want group content, try out godwars dungeon and have the long term goal of doing raids
---
[I've been pretty lucky so far](https://i.imgur.com/HuUrhhS.png). All four rangers came between clues 116-262. I think I'm gonna do until 400 to get the clue scroll item thing.
---
Missed your chance. You should told him all games are like runecrafting 24/7. Then you could have had him enjoy runecrafting you to 99.
---
Lmao that shits hilarious, dude is actually a brainlet
---
What does the ‚ÄúRank 9 ‚Äú mean?
---
Can zalcano be added to the minigame tablet so it can have a built In cc cause most people do it in small groups not larger groups and with the built in cc it would make things much easier

Never gain any xp on your account now

It's better but only with amethyst.

Never, I repeat, never, ever gain exp again. Your fate is sealed. Start over on a fresh account
---
WoW classic before RS3
---
I sell bait if you ever run out btw hmu
---
Corrupted gauntlet is not completely luck as many players can consistently beat it. You just need to be efficient with your gathering and time management. Obviously you can get super unlucky not getting a 2nd weapon frame or not finding a specific T3 weapon monster but even then it happens maybe 1 time out of every 10 corrupted gauntlets really
---
The rank makes it :D
---
Barrows is a ton of fun imo, you want 80 magic for it though, you CAN start with your current status but 80 magic really speeds it up.
---
Brought tears to my eyes.
---
I saw a post yesterday about the smelting chance of iron ore and how the user wanted it to scale with their smithing level.
---
After RS3 released their mining and smithing rework the community was able to give feedback and it was almost overwhelmingly positive. Would there be a possibility for that to come to OSRS in its own unique form that the player base would be okay with?
---
I might sell up then...
---
I don't think it really matters in this case: [https://imgur.com/a/RZhikZa](https://imgur.com/a/RZhikZa)
---
LOL! That's rich coming from a self described dropout working a shitty entry level job who dreams of being skilled enough to drive a fucking truck one day.
---
Now there's nothing wrong with ant of that, but there is something wrong with thinking you're better than someone else when you wouldn't even be smart enough to think of playing RS to feed your family in the same situation

Quest cape

Do you know how easy to exploit that would be?
---
add low level range/prayer gear like initiate and vestment robes for meele and magic, respectively
---
Change it anyway and scan your computer
---
Thanks!
---
The biggest integrity issue facing the game that they'll continue to sweep under the rug.
---
You do realize that in the next few decades we'll have computer interfacing tech in our brains, right?
---
If it's buying the items, then money that would have left the game doesn't.
---
Probably not but ya know
---
Pro Tip: Go down to 1hp with locator orb/dwarven rock cake and use absorption potions. It's much cheaper!
---
They do it because anyone in the wildy is open game and are choosing to risk getting killed. The pker doesn‚Äôt know what you have or don‚Äôt have.
---
How are 75 defense builds at similar combat levels? 45 to 75 adds 7-8 combat levels by itself
---
I got good prices on games by being a generation behind. Ps1&gt;ps2, Gbc&gt;gba. Feels like stores try to weed out older games faster now though. Or they just got better at managing inventory levels. Or there‚Äôs just more gamers now? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I've tried getting into a mentor tob raid and I wait hours at a time and none ever show up. Plus finding a team that will take you (without a tbow) is rare and due to my job and other irl things I play at all different times of the day on different days of the week every week so it's hard to find any consistent people to go with because my schedule is so irregular. My irl friends have accounts but are all sub 100 combat level having just started recently so for me and the vast majority of people, TOB is not realistic.
---
...We slay?
---
hmm with how common this shit is, are we sure *THEY'RE* not bots, like out there for automated self-promotion using popular news trends as a target field?
---
Good eye
---
Lots of skills there that could do with being boosted if you wanted to.
---
Combat stats look like you'd do alright at barrows - maybe get magic up to about 80 to make trident worthwhile over ibans.
---
If you're not in a clan, look into joining one that suits you. I played with very little interaction of other players from when I started 9 months ago up until about a month ago when I joined a clan. I found one which is very chilled out, not everybody is max combat, no requirements to regularly attend events which suited my real life schedule. Just hanging out in the CC adds a bit of variety to playing the game, chatting with other people and getting to know them.

I remember buying up lots of bargain bin pc games from 2006-2008 at Walmart. Crazy deals briefly.

There's nothing really wrong with furries. They're weird, sure, but besides the nazi ones they aren't hurting anybody. This ain't the 17th century, we don't burn people for practicing unusual sexual behaviour.

This is why I solo CoX and FFA ToB.
---
Ya know, I started off reading this and planned to read the whole thing, but three hours in I realized how futile that effort would be
---
I could raid and get lucky, but that's all it would be luck. Unless it was with trusted friends a split is unlikely.
---
I grind Vorkath as it's guaranteed loot and I won't get salty for not getting a visage as the other drops are 100k+ for literally 2 mins work which just makes sense to me as unless you get it, you have 0 motivation as you're always just chasing that dragon
---
Yeah I just wanted to show with the shop that it would be highly overpriced and wouldn't effect the ones coming into the game from the theatre
---
I'll try this later  
---
Thanks for the help, feels slightly better to know that this is just a bug at Jagex's end
---
I know, but the raids do change up ever so slightly and you get to do them with different people so it is definitely a more enjoyable process, but I hear you my rng really has been atrocious at raids and you make a good point about the time commitment I've already put in. Honestly, I agree. This is mostly me still fuming because I literally got the maul last night and I made the post this morning. I think I need a break.

Imagine if time played alone was the reason people got banned, I'm pretty sure half the game would be banned almost instantly. Top people on Hiscores would be banned. Most big streamers would be banned. All for playing the game an excessive amount of time.

Well you can check how your workers are allocated without collecting, I assume if you have enough money deposited and your favour isn't going down then it's probably full.

Yeah true shit, it will help me a lot with pvming and stuff

Yea it‚Äôs not significant, I sometimes beat my buddy because I have an avernic with 79 mining, while he‚Äôs got just a normal defender and max mining

Something is wrong with you if you think rs3 forces you to do dailies. I dont do dailies on my rs3 ironman like no one is raping you into doing dailies on rs3

I dont really seem to stay points positive at all, maybe its because I‚Äôve only just stopped with buying things for points and don‚Äôt have the best set up block list, but I have fucking no idea how people stay point neutral when its not uncommon for me to skip 3-5 tasks

My original comment that you were replying to was just about "hey, some jewelry faces the opposite direction of the rest", so I dunno what you're on about.
---
Unenchanted rings and the Berserker Ring point left while the Brimstone Ring and enchanted rings point right.
---
Leather boots are in 3/4 perspective, dragon boots are head-on.
---
Capes face left or right seemingly at random.
---
Neck-slot has it best, but still has some "unenchanted" jewelry facing the wrong way (unblessed symbols are the same as blessed, for instance) and also has some weird cases like the brass necklace. There's also a whole subset of these that are just laid flat, primarily the catspeak/m'speak amulets but also including the Desert Amulet and obsidian necklace.
---
# MY CABBAGES!!!

Good way of putting it

Yeah, the reason he did this was because when you leave the starting zone as a Panda, you choose either Alliance or Horde.  But he didn't want to choose.

Yes the storages does have a maximum limit how much can be gathered there. It just takes very long time (Wiki says around 9+ months depending how actively you visit the place to increase the favour back to 100)

 "Oh it's the 25th century, they're people like us too, don't bully criminals for living a different sort of life to you!"
---
Would it be possible for us to use our untrimmed capes on an npc to insure them, allowing us to keep them after recieving other 99s? 
---
This unfortunately wouldn't help players that have already lost theirs, but would be nice for those that have gone through the effort of preserving their capes or are on the road to their first 99.
---
Atleast those go unconscious.

It gave you exp starting in 4.0.1 the first cataclysm patch.

What's your block list currently? If you're just going for xp, you should be blocking abby demons/hellhounds/kraken/greater demons/bloodvelds I think, doing dark beasts and baby black dragons as quick points tasks
---
Even so, you need a pretty decent stockpile of points to be able to skip every bad task for any length of time
---
Woah. 2019 huh
---
You act like it‚Äôs outrageously expensive
---
Thanks :)
---
How do you report a post for spoilers, this fuck just spoiled swamp man
---
Obviously if he's considering doing this I don't think cash is an option for him.
---
Honestly cba arguing about this anymore.
---
Gotta love a good old pmod smackdown
---
what was your setup for lavas?
---
Found the furryy
---
Keep going bro, you'll get them eventually!
---
Thanks lol :)
---
Yeah it makes no sense for it to be just inside the cave. It would be a good idea to make it around the whole wilderness. It‚Äôs a good risk reward kinda thing and it would go well.
---
if you have the fishing level and a fire cape - Infernal eels are brilliantly afk. You never have to bank, so never need to leave your spot (you use a hammer on the fish and receive onyx bolt tips, lava dragon scales and tokkul). It is around 230k gp/h and 30-35k xp/h. I've been doing this since 82 fishing and i'm currently on 98. It's the best afk activity I have found to do as I afk whilst at work.
---
Been trying to get sub 30 min, ive been use max BP and addy darts, best time is 32 so far, dont use the rocks unless you have to, use minions to rock each other
---
Oh so generic pmod toxic nonsense and general bitching in chat.
---
Now that I‚Äôm gainfully employed I look back and realize my Mom was cheap as hell. $5 ain‚Äôt shit
---
This may seem minor, but because of my time on Runescape and similar games I learned how to type for the business environment. Spamming "flash2: selling rune scim 20k!!!!" 100 times really taught me where the keys were. It started as chicken pecking and I never learned the proper "home row" placement, but now I can type at a nice speed and not even look down. Fuck restrictive parents btw.
---
It's up to 2p minutes and each minute is one more portion of the dose gone, so if you fill all the way up with absorptions it's okay, and if you die you still keep all your potions.
---
That repost didn‚Äôt take long and you couldn‚Äôt even go through erasing the word Mom lol
---
...appropriate name?
---
I usually help them with a few 100k or some pointers when my Spanish is understandable lol. So yeah I do care about them more than pixels
---
ighty
---
It hasn't taken only months though. I've had this account for almost 2 years now. The grind for the tbow has only gone on for a few months now. So yea I'm gonna be a bit salty if I've been slaving away for two years and the only thing keeping me from obtaining my end game loot is an rng luck based obstacle. It would take me like 250 hours of strictly vorkath or zalcano at maximum efficiency to save up for a tbow at my current cash stack....
---
Cool grow up.
---
Hurhurhur got me. Not at all though, furriest thing I do in sex is fluffy handcuffs. That and your mother's unshaven puss.
---
Wow thanks I‚Äôll try it when I eventually get my fishing that high haha! How much have you made off of it so far?
---
Chuck tha bank! Chuck tha bank!
---
Lol same! I miss shooting mortars
---
Nah mate I'm not gonna do that. I dont live in a little bubble. I'm gonna stay pissed off that jagex broke this game and dont know how to fix it.

Cant see shit.

[cystal vs max range+acb against green zulrah](https://i.imgur.com/cQ8jPGg.png)

I felt motivated and modified Bitterkoekje's dps calc to properly implement the crystal armor set effect, and it beat out absolute max range + acb + diamond dragon bolts at both zulrah (all 3 forms), and sara godwars.
---
I've bought off Amazon the past 3 months and have always got it instantly.  I would double check your amazon account and bank account to confirm the payment went through.  If there is still issues I would contact customer support.
---
Thanks though I feel like I'm getting nowhere haha
---
Like I said, these are just ideas I thought of off the top of my head and I don't expect all or more than a single one to actually be polled
---
Filling the sack is more efficient than having to spend time making that money back.
---
Currently in my inventory I have 35.7m worth of onyx bolt tips, 9.9m worth of lava dragon scales and 1.4m tokkul which translates to another 10-20m. I sold some during the first couple levels of doing this but this is probably from about 83-98 ish.
---
These are in the Catacombs of Mort'ton. There are lower level ones there (23 I think). This is relevant to the Shades of Mort'ton quest.
---
You can't really fight them in shadow form. They go from shadow to corporeal form to fight, but if you leave combat then they revert.
---
I dont get it
---
Craws is bis at everything in the wildy: venenatis, chaos fanatic, chaos elemental, most slayer tasks etc. Not sure where you're getting "strictly for rev caves" from.
---
But it doesn't hurt anybody. If you genuinely can't tell the difference between a criminal and somebody that enjoys weird sex shit then you're a complete idiot, otherwise you're just looking for excuses to hate people. I guess both eventualities make you a complete idiot really. The only reason you even care is because other people take the piss out of them and you want to fit in. I'm not a furry but I'd much rather be a furry than a real life sheep.
---
Gotcha thanks, stats are actually 78 melee and 78 range, so good there. Would it be worth it to unlock void, or would your gear recommendations be fine ( I have all but accumulator not assembler)
---
Long term, my goal is to get to the level and gear where I can start doing raids with my friends. Short term, I need to make some money to buy gear, get my combat stats up, and get enough money for higher herblore (at 63 rn).
---
My question is, should I buy toxic blowpipe or anguish next? I haven't done DS2 yet, so I still only have an accumulator. I have a torture, so that's not a concern, and I can use my barrows cp and legs for now until I get bandos. But my range training feels pretty lacking considering that I have blessed d'hide and a rune cbow w/ odium ward. It's the same setup I've had for a long time and I'm still only getting like 40k xp/hr (on task) at 80 range.
---
81 atk, 89 str, 78 def, 80 range, 72 pray, 78 magic, 74 slayer
---
Nice, do you have one vs blowpipe and msb I‚Äôm interested in the result (or if you have the modified spreadsheet)
---
Thanks yea
---
As long as you can call correctly within 2-3 seconds of a call change then you're doing well enough.
---
What‚Äôs your combat level? This always happens to me on skillers. Usually my killer is a spider or rat. They usually aggro depending on combat.

Bring darts, a dds, and a yew shortbow and a rune pouch.
---
Teams thoughts on bringing a form of afk firemaking to the skill? It feels like you're shoe horned into either doing fire lines or doing wintertodt, and if youre not doing wintertodt youre seen as inefficient, it'd be cool to see something similar to bonfires so that more logs leave the game through burning. Maybe give it 30% the xp rate of fire lines increasing with how many people are burning with you?   
---
Either way would appreciate another fire-making training method  
---
Also could the team look into some minor visual bugs in Chamber of Xeric (specifically olm)
---
&gt;Yes, a pretty obvious one.  
---
could you go into more detail? it doesn't teach him anything to say, "its obvious" but if you point out what makes it obvious, it will help him understand **why** it is obvious to you. thanks
---
I‚Äôll just buy you a bond PM me on here and you can get graceful and bond. Ez game ez life
---
As I've said before but you ignore every week:  
---
1. This is way too much for a 'question', they are never going to respond to something so big in a Q&amp;A stream with limited time.
---
2. If they were going to go over this again (as theyve spoken about them before), they would have done so by now. Spamming this every week doesn't help, it's just spam.
---
3. You've ignored every single piece of advice people have given you and just copy/pasted the same thing every week. For example, there was an in-depth discussion about the difference between cerb/gg when it comes to predictability and damage from the pools, but you still state the same exact issues and statements.
---
Please, stop spamming these threads with your gigantic, never changing essay. If you actually want change done, either message the jmods personally on twitter ONCE and listen to the reply, or rephrase it to a simple question they can answer in a stream and be happy with the answer. Don't just spam walls of text each week please.

Sam and Ella is terrible way to die

&gt;If you're AFK at work like I am, it's not always as good. If you regularly have to go a few minutes without looking at your phone, you'll really waste absorption doses, and then die or end up having to restock more often.

Wait so using a locator orb/rock cake would make you waste absorption doses as opposed to not using a locator orb/rock cake and wasting absorptions?

No t bow = trash lol
---
&gt; It would take me like 250 hours of strictly vorkath or zalcano at maximum efficiency to save up for a tbow at my current cash stack....
---
That is the point. 250 hours in this game is absolutely nothing in this game. That is how long a quest cape, a slow skill and a pet grind for a single (boss)pet takes on avg.
---
And that is also roughly how long it takes to save up for a tbow. Many achievements in this game are only worthwhile and impressive because people show the perseverance to achieve them. 
---
The bow is also by no means necessary and also only starts paying off after you used it for around the same time it took you to save up for it in the first place.
---
&gt; Im like 200 higher than that but still not base 80. 
---
&gt;*You‚Äôre probably base 90s*
---
Oddly satisfying

Ive had my email for YEARS and never got that email. Why? One might ask, and the answer is simple, DONT USE YOUR FUCKING EMAIL ON ANYTHING RELATED TO RUNESCAPE EXCEPT FOR RUNESCAPE ITSELF.

1/127 for any of the three items and triple that rate for a specific one.

What. How do you not understand that... do you really need an eli5?? And when i say pure i am talking the context of osrs. From where it started and how it changed over time. To what it is now and what pvmtards like you seem to think it means. So go on, bust out your dictionary.
---
&gt; could you go into more detail? it doesn't teach him anything to say, "its obvious" but if you point out what makes it obvious, it will help him understand why it is obvious to you. thanks
---
Just to repeat: You can always log into the official site (don't use the link provided) and check your mail setting there in case you are worried.
---
If the email there did not change it obviously did not get changed.
---
I used to pay by SMS. I regularly had to go back to f2p for a short period because I couldn't ask my mom to top my phone up every month without her working out that it wasn't all going on calls/texts to friends/family.

sounds about right

Big rip on that trimmed power ammy. I got that on my 3rd easy lmao.

When can we expect the release of Prifddinas drop rates?

The thing is you have to complete a grind on a uim. Normal irons can just switch to something else. Uim you're stuck to one thing.
---
Does that include the time you spend to complete them?
---
Won't she restrict him from the pc?
---
I saw last week that a good setup is black dhide body and legs and crystal bow. You'll only lose spade if you use protect item. 0 reward for them other than the spade and tele runes you dropped but you'll waste some of their food or prayer points before they kill you.
---
Plz disclose your RCing strats from lvl 60

TO ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO LOGIN / TOO MANY ATTEMPTS:
---
You're being bruted. The hijacker is going to continue to try and login to your account so you'll panic and check your email where their phishing link is waiting.
---
The best thing to do right now is to continue to try logging in; it might take a while but it's better than losing your account. Don't click on any Jagex emails until further notice.
---
Slay, Slay, Slay.  Also, constantly do herb runs/seaweed and bird houses.  As you see how passive and easy those skills are to level, you'll enjoy it.
---
Just to let you know, there's a downside to the stacked items. If it's a pile of loot that a lot of people are clicking on and you're using that stacked runelite plugin, if you don't have the highest pid you will never get any of the items. Where as with the unstacked ones you can right click and click one of the items in the middle of the stack and have a good chance of receiving the item. Just wanted to point that out because the runelite plugin isn't strictly better. There are cases where you want to turn it off.
---
fuck your rng
---
this hurts because I literally have around this kc for vork and no uniques just 11 heads yum
---
Supposedly they're gaining traction in the developed world as a filler food to be eaten in combination with other beef (usually ground beef). They're rich in protein, the stigma of eating bugs is the main issue.

99 Slayer is free 99 ranged just from cannon, on top of the free 99 up and almost max melee.
---
Get a rune pouch too, only a few 100k if you buy a t10 emblem and then spend the remaining pts on stuff to sell (check bh store on the wiki for gp/point on the items)
---
Bottom left is me lmao. Prif bank 2k world is always the place with the hardest fashionscape flexes
---
Plastic surgery sure was popular amongst dragons in the 50s.
---
99 isn't the stopping point. Virtual levels go to 126, exp goes to 200m (187m more). If you enjoy playing your acc, including skilling, why would you quit when you hit 99?
---
Feels bad man that's alot of space lol
---
Diamond bolts e are dirt cheap? You don't lose every bolt, if you have an Ava you keep an 3/4 of the bolts you fire
---
I meant like afk meta; would that still be the best?
---
Something low level might have had a very wide roaming area. It could have also chased someone running past and lost agro. Only to reagro on you :/
---
Yeah that doesn't work when bosses drop runes, or gear that you use.

Yes.

Yes
---
Not really.  
---
Verf wants a Rune Crossbow, he paid people so he could get it.

https://i.imgur.com/4KBt6hR.png I actually did some maths this weekend, please note the Kills/Hour is going off EHB rates for the bosses, and the Gp/Hr is from the runescape wiki, so the gp/hr doesn't account for luck/or supplies. but yeah sire sucks for slayer xp...

---
LMFAO
---
refer to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cxadev/grotesque_guardians_are_stupidly_mechanically/eylbwkl/) comment
---
Those changes along with my proposed changes for the orb phase should bump the avg loot to ~65-70k (on top of the untradeable granite dust which is often overlooked as it boosts your cannon damage by quite a bit), which is fine for a mid level boss with this many mechanics. Slightly above mole/barrows in GP/h.
---
This game has had a massive pvp focus since the rsc days so I really don't know what you are talking about.
---
Before real bosses were introduced, pvp was basically the endgame.
---
give the ardough knights tele tabs
---
I bet you call it a zerker pure too ya dumbass

for astral runes there's a RL Plugin that lets you get pretty close to the altar with only one click  so you get like 20ish seconds to look at something else
---
They are speeding up the process of finding implings, which will provide a crossbow at some point.
---
I don‚Äôt want to have to repeat this again. These are different transactions. He is buying the location of implings. Whatever the impling provides is irrelevant. Yes these implings provide crossbows, but he is buying the location of an impling, not a crossbow.
---
Yes it will make it quicker to obtain a crossbow. He is not gaining an advantage over other ironmen. He is only buying implings because he is playing his own ruleset. It is taking nothing away from anyone else. He is fully documenting what he is doing for everyone to see. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt watch it - but he is not gaining an advantage over other plyers by doing this - unlike the other guy you mentioned. You seen the diff?
---
Green crown means he's a Reddit mod here?
---
yeah but kill speed is mainly what should be considered when deciding drop rates and thats what /u/SomewhatToxic said. Not that I agree that these changes would warrant a change in drop rate
---
Honestly zalcano is making me great money and it's quite the godsend for me. You will want to buy a d pick as soon as you can, and having higher mining helps (mine was at 78). 70 cons is not very expensive so you must not have much money, so I would encourage you to liquidate and do SotE. Make sure you have the stats for Seren though.
---
I'm gunna upvote this because I'm a nice guy

But fuck you
---
A (sub)domain doesn't necessarily have to have a website.  It's just a name for a place for web traffic to go.  For example, on my website example.com my automated emails are sent from mail.example.com.
---
Also, any sub domain of runescape.com, such as the one you're listing, is owned by whoever owns runescape.com.  So they're just faking the email address which is quite easy to do, and they might as well make it look as though it came from a legitimate source.
---
If you‚Äôre trioing only the tank is taking a DWH. 2 others are using range and spec transfer if anything. Soloing for short trips BGS is fine to use instead. But in terms of duos/trios DWH is still better. You wouldn‚Äôt all 3 be specing anyways if you were all using melee. Idk what to tell you but the math has been done and DWH &gt; BGS long term for defense reduction.
---
Okay - Imma just create an UIM and ruin that rank 9 of yours real quick

Grats, I don't know if you ever would have found the alter without the outline.

I saw this happen with dragon harpoon (RIP the 5mil I spent on it a year ago), but what happened to dfh? It‚Äôs still high priced and hasn‚Äôt been added to any other drop tables aside from mithril dragons and pyre ships.
---
I can't find the video, but I remember the one your talking about. So at the very least I can confirm you're not crazy and it does exist. I just can't find it either.
---
Correct. It's almost like all people are different.
---
prayer pots cant possibly be more afk than absortions imo, specially on that kind of shitty setup
---
&gt;Idk what to tell you but the math has been done and DWH &gt; BGS long term for defense reduction.

Can you link me to that, or let me know where I'd find it? I'd be interested in reading up on it.
---
Very nice. My dad used to smith Bell-end sheaths for a living to protect them from Wall Beasts. Those fuckers their claws are not to mess with

Would agree with you if the number of people didnt affect your drops, but it does so your analogy doesnt hold.I would rather make an extra 150k off a drop than not.

Nope, just a Jagex content creator

What clients are you downloading? Those were removed from the official releases a long time ago and a lot of those third party "xxx PLUS cracked" versions are pretty dubious at best and malicious at worst with potential for keyloggers/phishers. They're not official supported releases by anyone.
---
I feel for you man :(
---
&gt;i wasnt sure how they managed to do it
---
They basically had to rewrite the potion and stat refresh code for lms to work. They also had to make it so that you could pot while also being boosted.

Lmao feel free to spend double for no reason when one of the options is half as costly

Yes. I got this one today as well

---
Construction's main design is to be a gold sink. If the minigame involved using up planks for the same xp they're worth using normally I'd be for that.
---
81?
---
**Waking the Boss Up**: The proposed fix makes sense, would be nice to see it implemented.  
---
**The Respiratory System Phase**: It isn't bad currently, you can still damage the 3rd vent (and often killing it) before sire wakes up. But being able to reset the stun timer by casting a shadow spell early isn't a bad idea.  
---
**Phase Transitions**: While I agree it's a bad mechanic, you can still prevent losing out on a big hit. For example: if sire is on around 55% hp you can do a scythe hit or claw spec. The first hit(s) would deal damage getting sire below 50% hp, and only 1 of the last low-damage hits would get nulled. If you didn't know, claws is a better spec weapon than dwh for arclight users, even without this method.  
---
**Teleport and Explosion Phase**: With correct pathing, you can guarantee yourself to not get teleported on poison. It's a good thing to stay because it's avoidable and sire is meant to try killing you after all. The exploding animation also looks good enough for me, and everyone knows you shouldn't stand next to sire when it happens.  
---
**Slayer XP**: Grotesque guardians used to have 600 hp each, 1200 total. Maybe they forgot to nerf the slayer xp when they reduced their hp's to 450? Anyway, abyssal sire xp is calculated in exactly same way as normal NPC's, and it already DOES include the vent xp. Given abyssal sire's stats, its xp multiplier is 1.125x, which is 450 xp total for the 400 hp sire. The xp multiplier of vents is 1x. That's 200 xp from vents. 450+200=650. I don't mind it not being great xp, that's a common thing for bossing: less xp but good profit.

Don‚Äôt forget that you are not required to have that level to complete the step. You can boost your stats with a maximum of +5 with spicy stew
---
Vorkath for sure. I'm 89 cb and I've been farming vork since I finished ds2 at 85. 70 def 89 range 70 pray. I can't even wear a bgs, I use the bone xbow spec or just rock the BP. I can almost always get two kill trips, even 3 if the range attacks don't hit too hard or consistently. PB is only 1:55, average kill is more like 2:30-3:30 depending on spec energy and rng.
---
Keep making these please. Very educational and interesting!!

when pures try pvm

What are your thoughts on where crystal armor currently stands?  My thoughts on it ar√∑:Aside from being worse than the blowpipe and comparable to msb i, with the upkeep and initial cost considered, the time investment required for it, and the best place to currently use it being against commander zilyana as a sidegrade from the acb, crystal armor is so niche that it's almost nowhere to be seen.  Also considering how cheap the blowpipe is relative to the armor, and not locked behind any quest requirements to use, there's a severe imbalance in effort to reward here.
---
Your farming level equates to the % chance you have of picking without depleting. 
---
Therefore at 80 farming on average you will get 5 herbs before it depletes. At 90 you will get 10.
---
How is this different than using the hiscores plugin to lookup a player and then opening your skills interface??
---
You guys will never fix this. I has been asked for ever since the boss came out. Don't get false hope guys.
---
I got 650k range xp/hr on average from 80 range to 99. That's 17 hours total, compared to 157 hours at 70k xp/hr. Total cost was about 40m since MM2 tunnels means free prayer. In 140 hours I made way more than 40m because I had access to raids, faster zulrah and vorkath kills and gwd bosses. With that money I did inferno and I also bought max melee for slayer and had enough to spend on burst/barrage/cannon/inferno tasks for basically double the slayer xp/hr. That gives me quicker access to bosses like cerb and hydra, as well as good enough gear to do those efficiently. By now I'm at least 100 hours ahead of where I'd be had I used cannon and msb/bpipe on slayer tasks for ranged xp.
---
Tele/alching is good.
---
I don‚Äôt click on random links from strangers on the internet.
---
A good goal to make imo though for long term, that‚Äôll help make you alot of money over time aswell as help train your combat stats, is 99 slayer. With 99 slayer imo you will prob have 99 all cb stats aswell as big bank. Especially if you do bossing slayer later down the road when your at the right lvls. 
---
Another good tip is any question you have for fastest methods of training or boss reqs, can be found on youtube. Youtubers basically retaught me the game when i first came back after a 10 year break. 
---
(Guides for quests, pvm bosses, fastest ways to 99 stats(all stats))

It's been 30 minutes and he's still here with a dramen staff, skill necklace and stone boots..
---
Wait so over the weekend you went from 65-77?
---
Your title is confusing because it‚Äôs quite obvious you‚Äôll do more DPS with ranged with your stats/gear than melee. Never said it was your fault, you can play the game however you please, I‚Äôm just saying with your stats/gear I‚Äôd be surprised if melee was more efficient.

While we were running around thinking we were nights and wizards our moms truly were the ones of the great power

It's both, Vorkath Drops the Necklace that gives the bonus, Hydra drops the piece that allows you to combine the bonecrusher and Dragonbone Necklace into a one slot Bonecrusher Necklace.
---
Consider a metamorphosis to it's original spawn model for the pet, please. I just happen to think it looks cooler. :) &gt;1k kc on Sire btw.
---
That sucks, but pretty pathetic asking for the split. You definitely wouldn't have split with him if it dropped for you guys. What's the logic "we helped?" well it would be the same the other way around.
---
I have 3 curved bones at bandos rn in like 2k kc
---
You tryna tell us something by posting that?? üßê
---
IMO none of those complaints except for the slayer xp are a big deal. Sire is too easy to have complaints.
---
So you have to wake up sire before you put him to sleep.. So what?
---
So you have to run around and kill 4 respiratory systems in 2 sets, big whoop.
---
The teleport may put you on top of acid.. Okay so you didn't bring food/ pots/ healing?
---
I agree with the slayer xp being stupid low but everything else isn't a big deal. Once again just my opinion.

This is a good idea. It would give Tangleroot a reason to keep around, since the dialogue leaves you wanting more.

This is what I love about jmods. Actively with the community addressing issues to make our lives easier. Been on alpha and beta for many a wow expansion and never gotten the response rate for fixing the game. Even with DE playing war frame. Good on you

GPU something I think but I'm not sure

Woodcutting and mining
---
He was opening looting bag needs to be done in the wild used like a sort of bank for uim
---
This is using the uncooking pot from the bob random event though, where it turns cooked food into uncooked food.
---
So this makes sense, as only the outer food was successfully uncooked.
---
Yeah but if I'm dying 3-4 times I'm losing 100k+
---
And here is me, 650kc dry of anything, 1.5k kc with only one pegasian and 1 eternal. Fuck this game.
---
That's why this is the Uncooking pot. It works backwards.
---
Switch to long range before jad round, the round with the two Ket-Zeks. That way you don‚Äôt have to stress yourself over another switch.
---
How can you kill a god?
---
I know of the granite one for mining, teak at Ape Atoll and karambwans, but thats all I know about. You could do some research on those and perhaps a bit on the ones i might have missed. I hope this helps
---
Lmao ancient meme
---
Haha nice
---
Yeah xp/hr is better, but I find Agility more low effort and I prefer that over RCing.  And werewolf is like 60k/hr which is still decent
---
inb4 ranarr seed crashes
---
30 KPR probably takes into account using alts that have house pools, and high enough magic to cast spec transfer. This is kinda unrealistic for most people to achieve because this pertains to maybe 0.1% of the player base that has alt accounts that high of level.
---
What the fuck are you talking about, go kill them and take their pesos instead of making up the worst analogy Ive ever read
---
But it would have been cooler if you had 69...
---
Slayer / sand crabs
---
He doing ds1 ?
---
The uncooking pot from the evil bob random event. You catch a cooked fish and uncook it for him
---
Tbh we dont need everything in osrs to be perfect. Its okay as it is. Except when we look at platelegs that are diagonal, like justiciar legs. That needs to be changed.

First time I succesfuly did Jad in 2011 I had full torva + ganodermic and divine lol. And I started playing in 2006.

What‚Äôs the minimum wc lvl to boost to 90 for the diary req? I thought the wc guild had the invisible +7 boost along with a +3 boost from dragon ax spec would give a +10 boost total. I can‚Äôt cut redwoods at 80 wc with those stacked boosts though...
---
Shark quantity... Nice.
---
Extremly underrated post
---
I would probably just suggest never being on melee hand, if possible, one of the strategies of melee hand is to swap to long range trident when hand is crippled, which would give you defense xp and some people just stay on block on the hand to not have to swap attack styles

Blessed boots are fucking huge jesus, much rarer than the xbow.

I didn't know he had direct access to range pots. That's also huge, both because he's not relying on Wines of Zammy drops and saves an inventory space for TOB.

Can someone already confirm his boosted rng?

Have you tried the runelite GPU plugin?

anyone know which song starts playing at 13:46?

Its a '73' version of a 5.56 round.

73 was popularized by boaty when skillspecs killed him with a 73 ags in a brid fight long ago. Since then, it's been referred to as the *ginger integer*.

So if starving people are making money off it, we need to instantly cave any game integrity to let them keep breaking the rules? They use stolen account and bot. Some are definitely legitimate, but for them to make anything even somewhat substantial they would need to use unsavory methods.
---
And no, in my analogy i said the $50 is "pretty much nominal." Thanks to gold selling websites, GP technically does have value. Most of the player base would never cash it in though, they are playing for fun. That was the whole point, most of the player base is playing for fun, and suddenly you have a group playing for survival, to the point you either have to let them do their actions which ruin the game (like the economy in Runescape or THE ENTIRE FREE TO PLAY GAME), or you would have to look like an asshole and not take their non-game related situation in account to their rule breaking. I am saying this dilemma is not a fair one and has no place in a game.

So basically you created a lucky impling special forces

Poor thing, often used sarcastically, like this case.
---
Scythe in max beats BP in max against 0 defence, and scythe scales better with defence if you aren't on task. Any time BP beats scythe is a situation that favors range over melee in general.

I wonder what Spec weapon will be used for the Theatre of blood

Yup my parents thought buying membership for something online was a scam. After about 2 years of f2p only I just got $20 and mailed it off to Jagex. It worked and my parents still didn't believe me that it was legit. They said no more sending money in the mail but I kept doing it. Remember one time I actually forgot the stamp and didn't get my membership and lost $20 :(

Tbh, it would make sense for UIM to get boosted RNG (probably not true but whatever)
---
You are really sounding a lot like a botter talking like that
---
I'd imagine that the number of scouts was already at or near the max rate of finding one. Just a handful of people per world sitting at the spawn locations is enough. If anything more people might lead to trolls grabbing the imps.

I don't see anything in there that suggests why the email is an obvious phishing attempt. You suggested a method to confirm your mail settings, which is helpful. Nonetheless it would be beneficial to explain why this is an obvious phishing attempt.
---
At my first glance I see that it originated from an email at the runescape domain name. What else should we look for?
---
definitely not true, although Jagex could've slipped a bit of RNG into this guys pockets to boost revenue, Swampletics definitely has some pull
---
thanks (:

No 77 prayer for rigour. Wtf noob

I gasped when I saw this post. I don't gasp often

Do you not lose untradeables in pvp world?

I might just be a brainlet, but I always assumed PvP world was just where you go to say goodbye to your void, fighter torsos, and avernic defenders.
---
2005 interface styles on Runelite. Can also set to 2010, but that's ugly af.
---
So you've sat in on the QA team and you personally watched them equip the staff and fail to notice the issue? Because if you haven't then you have no idea what the QA team looks like. Maybe they don't get hours to make sure everything is right about the item, maybe they didn't even get to see this item beforehand because they've already done a rework on the sotd in the past. The point isn't that the QA was lacking, the point is that you don't get to call for people losing their job when you don't know what their job looks like. Grow up.

It's also a good alternative if you can't afford rapier or saeldor

Thats why one guy brings both

It's in the 'ground items' plugin

The rune platelegs followed immediately by a rune platebody was insane

I think the Unholy is just +8 bonus, but the whole idea is not having to spend money on refilling the books, that why I said the Tome of Fire might be a better option if it doesn't require to be filled in order to get the bonus

Morytania.
---
They are only making concepts? They are not making models, beta etc. They talked about this on a Q&amp;A recently if you want to watch that.
---
I don't use them myself but there are plenty of guides on youtube that explain it - just make sure you're always mapping one action to one action or else you can be banned for macroing. I do steam RCing without mousekeys and I still get around 55-60k xp/hr while watching a movie
---
Well with the recent update in LMS you can keep untradeables above 20 wildy if you buy the item but if you have a firecape and ur skulled above 20 wildy ur fudged man its over that‚Äôs why pvp builds stick more to untradeable builds because if you die you can repair it and if the person kills you with ur untradeables in pvp they get some gp so its fair, i think that‚Äôs the reason in my opinion
---
Can ‚Äòswap lettuce‚Äô become a meme now please

Of course it is. But the comment wasn't talking about people competing for rare resources. It was about trolls

I was caught so off guard when the episode ended.  I was like, wtf where‚Äôs the c bow?

It's ok...most people get it before 99.  We're just super lucky.

You keep untradeables as long as you're below 20 wilderness

Which to idiot sheep are apparently the same thing

Didn't even realise he... she... was a chick until this comment, lol. Konar doesn't sound very feminine.

Right but look at it this way:  
---
It boosts your attack and strength by 16.67%. If you were to max slayer **without** being efficient the black mask would make the grind around 100 hours faster give or take, you don't need to be a sweaty efficientcape player to benefit from it.
---
It's really cheap too, no reason not to go for it if you want to slay
---
Pmods getting rowdy lately, had one at ge in w420 telling us all to pack our bowls and smoke one. Total contrast from the mods 10 years ago

You are going to get downvoted into oblivion. Inb4 you delete your comment.

Nah, Dorian took one glance at Florida and realized it's already pretty messed up.

So move instead of attack? You can stand in poison for 2 or 3 ticks though if that's what you mean.
---
Bring the best darts you can afford. Tune minimum since you are lower level if you are having trouble. I finished at 90 cmb and struggled killing him a lot. Just takes time and a little luck you‚Äôll get it

I don't think there are any specs he can use that would help him very much. Magic shortbow and rune claws are the only ones off the top of my head

They're worth 5m *only* because swamp man pays 5m for them.

The expected value for opening them is much much less. Certainly under 100k, i've heard as low as 5k each

Imo the inability to land hitsplats during transitions and the god awful slayer xp are its biggest problems.

What the fuck.

Invest it in an alt so you can grind while you grind.

It's used for a clue step I believe or diary

justiciar isn't good at vorkath, you should be using bandos with serp/slayer helm if you're meleeing. that will help a lot with the negative magic bonus, it should put you above -65
---
&gt; Just go make a rune crossbow 
---
Because you can't. It's impossible for him to get/make the crossbow string in Morytania. 
---
&gt;I feel like relying on a drop you can't get in mory tania
---
It *is* possible for him to get a crossbow drop from an Imp though in Morytania. This video is literally him working on getting the drop...
---
Simple. Nut more than once and dont clean up.
