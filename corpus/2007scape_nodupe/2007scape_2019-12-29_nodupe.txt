Yep, Was totally expecting something like

---
Desert Treasure II -&gt; Opening Menaphos + Rais III.
---
---
---
I mean at least they were consistent based on the results.. way to go jamflex!
---
Maybe try out Demon Slayer? I did it last night, it’s fun!
---
At least these are difficult to obtain and aren't just a rune armor cosmetic, they all have various functions.
---
Tera IQ
---
It doesn't even increase success, probably

I agree that POH creep is a thing but, I don't know, it seems appropriate for your achievement diary gear to be placed in your achievement gallery?
---
There are lots of beginner quests. I'd suggest going to the wiki and looking through what's recommended for beginners.
---
jamfix pls
---
Cooks assistant, sheep shearer, goblin diplomacy, and pirates treasure would be a good place to start. They should help you get further acquainted with the map

I did raid on release and wanted the prayer scroll to remain just 1 item, like it was back then, as well as it being decently rare. They split the scrolls and increased the odds at getting them to counter-act very wealthy players from collecting all the scrolls and manipulating the market. Problem was, rigour was worth the 650-500M price tag back then as it's the thing that makes the range weapons strong. Augury on the other hand, is trash and not useful for anything other than in pvp situations where your numpty ass is running from a salad robe pker. In ancestral, sure augury is good for pvp. Glad they changed the entirety of a prayer scroll for pvmers but did fuck all changes when it eviscerated pvp and made pvmers almost invulnerable in 1 update with augury and bulwark. If anything, a damage boost would make magic an actual threat in pvp and would give a much needed dps meta shake up as far as pvm is concerned. Who the hell just wants magic to be niche for pvm and only allow rigour-range scape or piety-scythe scape to be the top of the food chain.

Wave 31... bro, don’t you want a fire cape?
---
Did this with a few of my buds with t he intro theme. Good times

Pro tip: Open your chat box after you click on the jewelry box. You can use your onscreen keyboard to press the key shortcut for whatever corresponding teleport you need.

Got both my rings and axe from zero in 200 kc &gt;:}
---
Sell it and refill your fucking blowpipe
---
Thank you. I strive to make the player experience as aids inducing as possible. /s
---
But really I see OP's point. But I and other players are different. Voting does take into account the time put into a game. Now I understand there are others with vastly more play time than me but I've collectively hit 2 years concurrent playtime across 2 accounts. I've invested 2 years of my life into this game. When voting I don't take that lightly. Does that mean the person voting with less playtime quit? Seems a wee bit drastic.
---
Totally agree with you on the arbitrary sword requirements, but the woodcutting and hole requirements make sense. In theory, the trees are not identical, and would require different levels of skill to chop down. Same thing with the holes, while they make look similar on the outside, they could be more narrow or more intricate on the inside
---
7.8k atm, still dry, got hydra pet at 73 tho, rng will favour us in other places my dude!
---
Fake and gay but nice story.
---
It's half the gp/hr as TOB and the drop table is already stupid as something like 48% of your drops are going to be prayer scrolls. For the power of rigour, it should not be 45M and that drop table needs a huge fucking revamp alongside some changes to some of the items on the table.
---
Monkey Madness II
---
[removed]
---
To use an agility short cut? Make sense...
---
OP is fishing there to afk lobbies for pet for what it’s worth
---
Have you tried 3t barb fishing? Its easily 100k xp per hour. Sharks no chance you will get 25k xp hr unless your 99 fishing and using a crystal harpoon, unless your talking about minnow fishing which I personally have never tried.
---
There is an untapped market in your eyes, you should exploit this and make the videos that are missing
---
No one is perfect dude lol. Your literally ragging him for making a mistake once every 5 raids? Shit happens.
---
The bot had been repeating this motion for 30 minutes prior to my recording.
---
Thanks! We’re gonna keep content like this coming, so keep your eyes peeled.
---
I should set that to my quick prayer, correct?
---
Do you need a to Beat a elite diary to use a sword or a pick etc
---
Idk if anyone makes phones like that anymore but I feel like I remember seeing samsung developing a new one
---
Thanks, but shame.
---
Its challenging because of how long it takes.
---
Whoever you are I love you thank you
---
Oh, well 1 def is the reason, not being an ironman
---
start questing. If you're too weak to complete your next quest just train your combat to get there efficiently.
---
It will give you access to most of the game, and give you a lot of skilling XP as rewards.
---
It’s generally better to do all f2p quests before you get membership, but it seems like you’ve already done that. Work on questing/barrows gloves as well as getting a dragon defender- and that should be a good boost to your account.
---
That’s a big part of the game lil guy 🤣 PvP is dead and if I raid I’ll probably end up watching a guide too haha
---
I have a few from 2007

Uhm it’s actually some pretty fucking good gear? Not everyone has 150m sitting around for best in slot. &amp; 6kc vork would make it understandable that he doesn’t have the newest avas.
---
From the bottom of my heart...... Screw you. Jk lol gz bro
---
Why do you think people will stop watching the series?
---
Start working towards bosses and big quests like DS2 and MM2
---
I’d much rather see an implementation of a cross world lobby for many of the once popular mini games.  I’m sure we won’t ever get something like this though because... engine work.
---
Gorillas are fun, if only i would known that earlier.
---
230k i think
---
290k for one
---
i'm currently rebuilding my bank, my friend gave me an empty BP, and now i can refill it :D
---
Exactly, I shouldn’t grind 30 hours to use a shortcut only to still fail it anyways 40% of the time. It makes sense in Tirannwyn with the traps, but shortcuts are just dumb.
---
Pipe cleaner abyssal whip or not this is incredibly thoughtful!
---
Anyone that played RS2 back in pre-EoC days knows that RS3 died because EoC was a horrible update that no one asked for and effectively killed the game. Everything they’ve done since then on RS3 has been to milk the little remaining player base that they have left.
---
didn’t hide inventory, gf account
---
It’s a tight fit
---
Is it common to get only like 4-5 herbs from the Troll Stronghold/ Weiss herb patches?
---
Nope, all relics unlocked already. As I mostly play afk whilst working I took skilling/gathering relics so I could rack up points easily. Just getting into combat now I’m on Xmas holidays. How am I to skip the task without points?
---
What do you mean? I think my argument is pretty solid.  Having a lvl 23 method for runecrafting be the best exp/hr method seems pretty ridiculous.  Guess its hard to reason with someone who disagrees and thinks the skill is balanced and fine as is though, since you have to be pretty retarded to think having a lvl 23 method be the best xp/hr is a good idea, for any skill.
---
Gotta fund that nuke program somehow
---
Task before this I had fire giants! Seems like I’m going from one long task to an even worse one.
---
Will be trying range gear when I get home, hopefully it helps speed up a little
---
Agreed. At this point the character looks as if it could be a stone statue and not human
---
Here's to more episodes:) great series my dude. Love it.
---
Personally I did the plough followed by making the fertiliser using compost &amp; saltpetre then I did the kitchens from like 45% favour (I think it is) to 100%
---
I'm not saying there's no hidden money makers
---
But all the "hidden" ones are just unpopular becuz they suck, not becuz they're undiscovered. Unless you're making unprecedented amounts of gp for requirements that are low, then you're most likely just being in effcient thinking you're doing some secret money maker.
---
Not too sure; I play an Ironman and only have 45 agi currently from the barbarian course.
---
Make fertilizer by combining compost and Saltpetre and give it to the clerk in the middle of the Saltpetre area. Takes 950 to get 100% favor from 5%.
---
Not sure if the exact methods would differ at lower levels, but since I do hard contracts I always have a redwood tree growing or waiting to have the health checked. That way once I get that one assigned I can just check health and move onto the next one without waiting the like 7 days for a redwood. 
---
So yes, you just don't harvest them unless you either get it as a contract or need to clear it to do something else.
---
Same, it's a gif and I'm on mobile
---
Yes it is. Its costs about a few hundred mill. Broke players still do laps at prif but the boots are by far the best way to do it.
---
This. Dude *does* have over 150m for dhcb, pegs, and dfw. It's everything else that's all fucked up
---
Presumably he hadnt spoken until after the trade began, so the joke is still there
---
well 1 prayer accounts are basically dead content as you dont really get anything from it. the combat levels gained from the prayer will be less than the levels gained by raising strength to achieve the same max hit increase. the prayer account will have bit higher max hit and bit lower max hp versus a low prayer account. also the benefit of protect item alone cant be ignored in my opinion. if youre really hard set on having 13 prayer i wouldnt worry too much about it because its mostly a novelty. 31 prayer is best for pures until id say probably cb 75 or so at which point you become very susceptible to being smited out by other pures so id consider 52 standard by that point. also opens up fire cape and other random stuff
---
dont stress the small stuff; which is what this is
---
If you also have around 90 cooking then sacred eels are probably going to be roughly the same gp/hr as infernal eels - usually they're higher but zulrah scales have crashed hard recently (though they're slowly rising now). At 99 cooking you can get much higher gp/hr depending on how much you're paying attention. Infernal eels are marginally higher xp/hr but it's negligible. Infernal eels are also more afk since the spots don't move around as much.

Once I lost a bunch of stuff after I had somehow died near the calquat tree on karamja. I think what may have happened is that I dced and then decided to quit for the day, but the character still stayed logged in for a bit and then it got attacked by a jungle spider or something. Next day I found myself in lumbridge with a bunch of stuff gone

There aren't enough players to make this possible sadly. Each world averages about 400 players' and it seems a large majority are bots
---
No, I got it. Just checking whether there was any other reason that I was missing.
---
you're fine bro, depending on your eventual build you'll prob end up getting more anyway
---
Exactly, it’s not bots. Just way more people doing zulrah all day. They’ll be back up to 250gp in a couple weeks.
---
What are quests right?
---
Right on. Everything I was reading was indicating that it wouldn’t matter. I just worked myself up over it cause it caught me by total surprise when I finished that quest and saw the prayer xp drop.
---
I’ll check it out.
---
Just drop them.

No one needs 816 slots.

Lol it’s a xs max not a iPhone 2 chill bruh 😂

any tips for finding a mass?
---
Honestly I'd just get 43-44 prayer out of the way now unless there's some reason you're not able to. With protect from mage you'll take 0 damage and you could probably punch him to death. As far as items go just take your best melee weapon (rune scim/brine sabre/granite hammer/etc) and a Glory
---
That's what you get for having Iron in your name

Thanks for the response man. That’s all great information. Helped me settle down over it lol

Duel arena is strictly used for gambling/rwting now. It should even be in the game.
---
WDR like you mentioned having trouble with does do masses from time to time and those can be good, scrolling through on twitch you might find a streamer doing a viewer mass too, and there's occasionally people who announce masses here on reddit too
---
For the first point, I consider that power creep of sorts. Easing out the midgame to reach endgame faster is a form of that, and like you point out, people complain about the power until it gets nerfed into useless. 
---
Also lore is solid I guess, I'm a big quester myself so I'd complete the content regardless. Most people would consider such content useless since they spacebar through the whole thing and don't get anything in the end, but I wouldn't complain.
---
&gt;intricate and detailed storyline
---
Hm, if it was so detailed, surely they would actually say what the story is?
---
Lol no.
---
Help him ned

The one that has a detailed storyline with a free 50k silver and a free legendary champion if you download it now?

 So here take this... :D
---
On a bigger picture, it's the last place where you can stand next to the void. Unless im mistaken, that is.  
---
Also, do you think Morytania's next big update would be announced at Runefest were it not for Settled? And now twisted leagues exists. Area restricted ironman are kinda a litmus test for these regions. If it's worth being there, they will be there. Speaking from personal experience, there's a damn good reason that most area restricted ironman are locked in Zeah. That's where the content lives.
---
I have. I just mean that I literally let my prayer run out because I'm not watching by the time the mage waves come. Too many YouTube videos while I'm doing it...

Yeah for me blackjacking was tilting but like I was saying watch a video of someone doing it with the full inv of stews and resetting him if he catches you. Its intense but it's not as tilting as like master farmer
---
My first 200kc I saw 3 tbow splits. I’m currently at 700kc and probably only seen like 100m in splits since. All in the rng
---
Th haphazard painting strokes along with decent proportions and good angular capture of the body and shoulder tilt gives this painting a lot of motion, pretty decent for a kid

Thats from the barbarian game yes

How about just double or triple bonus. Still not as much extra dps as b-ring but would actually be useful.

Don't force yourself to play. If you're not having fun just try other things until you feel like playing again.

I have mine on 3 kc
---
He didn’t. I did because I also think all the Venezuelans gold farmers ruin mine and others experiences
---
I watched it seems fake but funny
---
I never said it was lol
---
Awesome! I still have only done a few barrows runs. I feel accomplished when I do any PVM. Keep it up
---
I think that more minigames would be a great idea! Especially some skilling minigames, especially especially if it appeases the more obnoxious pvp folks.
---
?
---
Why are you assuming they're Venezuelans when there are dozens of CC's that you can pay and do exactly what OP and I just said?
---
Smokes are still at 18.. Except for your country.. Sounds third world to me
---
These posts are so pointless
---
I haven't done much of any PVM but I'm finally starting to try things. Barrows was the one thing I had always wanted to do when I was younger and it feels great finally being able to do it
---
No..?
---
It’s possible that was the case in this specific scenario. But Venezuelan gold farmers are definitely a problem in this game.
---
Gp farming sure as hell won't fix Venezuela. But it sure as hell beats going hungry and would practically be a prevailing wage in comparison to anything else the individual could do.
---
I absolutely support this. If I can remember, I'll ask this on the next Q&amp;A, as should everyone else
---
Don't forget some pretty high thieving.

united states

cutting them into arrow shafts for the PC/fletching grind on your UIM?
---
I know they are. 
---
It's shitty to just automatically assume everyone is a Venezuelan farmer when you can't do something, though. 
---
I'm almost certain this was just a normal clan. Clans have had Rev caves on lock for a long long time.
---
Then it will tell him he needs 76 mining

Whenever I see someone so dumb I'm not sure if they're trolling or not, I like to check the username.

I've browsed this sub since it first existed, and somehow you've been the culprit of pretty much every comment dumb enough to cause this.
---
Currently grinding 99 runecrafting, its a slow process but im like 500k away from 95.. and its gonna be done anyway cause one day im maxing. So might as well get it outta the way.
---
They tell you to "right click - break" a Wilderness crabs tab
---
How about just 'gold farmers, let's not single out a group of people because of where they're from.
---
I feel like I'm doing it wrong. I'm told I never need a pray pot but they drain your prayer a lot so I'm guessing im just bad at the game
---
This is all the more fun because if you included the era that never touched staminas it would be the peak of the graph, LMFAO. Come again.
---
But the diary tier that lowers it, requires using it to complete!
---
Who buys the gold mate? It is their fault not the sellers
---
last time I had to do this I found someone in world 301 in like 15 min to help me out, I guess people think this a scam now? I usually use my main to drop trade to and buy bonds but it expired so I would rather find some to help than to pay for membership on an account i dont play just to get a bind to ironman
---
Just pay $11
---
Nice.
---
Your in for a treat!
---
T
---
Hope you got a d axe
---
I'll play ironman when somethings done about crashing. As alluring as ironman mode is, I'm not going to put hundreds of hours into an account to get it PvM ready, then get crashed at every GWD boss because some dude did 1 damage to the boss.
---
why pay 11$ when I have enough items to play for free if just drop trade from ironman
---
They can all lose their virginity together 😁
---
TL
---
Many people make posts like this and get scammed. Regardless of your intention it's a gamble to someone who doesn't know you and not worth the risk.
---
"popped up and is rushed" for something that's months in the making and has gone through a balance update already?
---
Do you guys want them to hire a fucking tribunal and go through 3 years of review before anything gets added? I've never seen a community that hates new content more
---
Ofcourse task is theoretically doable, but the task is 5x more diffcult because of gold farmers and the whole "high risk high reward" just isnt there because of that.
---
The potion making is the best thing about Desert diaries.
---
I know you're probably talking about elite, but you didn't specify.
---
Isn’t this a copy of other art though?
---
yea I can see that, last time I found someone in game quick, ive only had to do this once before when bonds were only like 2m.
---
Nice man, hover your mouse over each door going to the chest room and one of them will have the “open” option. That’s the door to head towards
---
Because you're trying to find random people on reddit to trust you
---
Dang really? I've only gotten like 1 survey a month this past year. Been crazy slow getting them I've thought about deleting the app because I cash be remember the last time I had enough to collect a pay out...
---
Definitely. Was doing Jad task and wasn't paying attention, got slapped with a 97 which made me care about the fight real quick.
---
L
---
I think leveling up your mage is a good investment of that money.   Magic and range are definitely the 2 best combats for mid and low level bossing and money making!
---
Dang. Grats though.
---
The same exact girl tried to buy my 3rd age robe for 2b. I told her, "that's 2m" and she insta logged. lmao
---
Nezzy helm and 70 range
---
Good shit bro!  Hope you get those juicy barrows gear, GL!
---
ok man fair enough, thought this would be easy to find someone. like i said above last time i did this was over a year ago when bonds were only like 2m it was way easier
---
you can use your account on any device.
---
Litterally said if we are gonna spend $200 on bonds to afford to bank stand a skill we should quit. Just saying.
---
Ya that and also go for fremmenik isles for neitiznot.
---
Longer term is recipe for disaster gloves and Dragon defender and eventually fire cape!
---
Lol better than 5 ahrims hood.  x.x
---
Fuck you. 420 tob kc and I’ve never seen a scythe in a raid
---
No, I'm pretty sure the op wants you to quit if you don't like a skill and don't wanna do it to unlock pvm stuff.
---
I mean he's not wrong. I tried mobile and was like meh, then decided to do cooks assitant, over 4000 hours later im still here. Not even sure why.
---
I have over 90 iq so i can determine that level 85-90 rangers with 500 total level with spanish names, low risk setups at no requirement place just might be RWTers. Also it is completely irrelevant that maybe 10% could be from different country.
---
And the fact that your solution to rwt infested task is "just go to different master lol" is completely stupid.
---
Did you know you can save 15% by just switching to Geico? Also, gz. 5 fire runes, 1 nature rune, and you know the rest.
---
Just a few tips; You do Dharok, ahrim and kharil first and in that row. You can (but don't have to if you don't want to, no one seemed to do it but me) pray flick Dharok for practice since it saves pray, and forces you to be good or else he hits 70 and it's really easy once you get used to it.
---
no offense taken, but I have found someone to help before when I had to do this. i honestly thought it would be quicker to find someone on reddit instead of at GE
---
Oh, that last one is actually real. Haha.
---
If your email doesn’t have 2fa on it and gets compromised, essentially all of your other security measures are pointless. Your email being completely secure is the most important. That is where most people go wrong. Their email will be used on some random site, site gets compromised, they use the same password for their rs account as their email and then it’s gg, and even if you don’t use the same password, full access to your email can often be enough too.
---
Let’s gear up and kick their asses
---
While I appreciate the attempt, the op isn't railing against people attempting smaller or lesser goals in the game. They are railing against people enjoying the game differently to them or giving Jagex money for bonds.
---
Waaaay too many antidotes my dude
---
That thing is purely cosmetic, it will be worth shit all.
---
Exactly right. Only use Konar for bonus point tasks.
---
faceguard + salve (+infernal) is BiS for vork.
---
Also make sure to not have any brain cells. You’ll find that if you have any you won’t be able to get yourself to splash for xp
---
Some guy tried this shit on me too. Lmao.

He means the iphone part.

wow problem solved! i guess the whole situation at revs is solved now
---
Theres quite a few snowflake task accounts.
---
This acc is a beast
---
Isn't that a runelite feature? That it shows the object is clickable and if you click it'll 'open'
---
They are different. Diaries don't unlock new content, outside of the chin cave which was only a response for overcrowding because jagex sucks at banning bots/gold farmers. Well that and for whatever reason the chompy pet is diary only which I've never understood.
---
Maybe you don't understand structure of quests vs diaries. Diaries are just simple tasks with no puzzle solving and they give you discounts/teles/basic qol which should be in the game regardless (like infinite ropes at kq lair). Notice that diaries require quests that take much longer than the diary itself takes to complete. Two things cannot be the same when one requires the other and both have different rewards. They might have similar function in preventing certain unlocks but they are different in substance and the actual unlocks they provide.
---
Mate wut
---
Yeah its pretty weird that 95% language you hear on osrs is english, but at revs it magically turns to 90% spanish
---
Generally people with passion for a project will enjoy discussing with others on ways it could, in their opinion, be improved.
---
Thanks for the kind words homie!
---
The one shortcut that has a lore-based reason for being diary-locked. I'll pass on the Al Kharid window shortcut, but all other locked shortcuts are ass.
---
It’s hotline bling...
---
Sweet acct mate.
---
To be honest most diaries already have a pretty large number of decent rewards. IMO Jagex could completely nix the agility shortcut that are also locked behind a level from the diaries and I don't think any of them would lose a substantial amount of value.
---
Also, as other people have pointed out, allowing someone to use those shortcuts at a lower agility level completely preserves (and arguably improves) the value of the diary's reward without making the shortcuts locked behind diaries.
---
Some grinds I don't mind at all, others I see value in adding different options or new content to (like bird house runs).
---
And I vote for the ones that make sense to me. I don't see why we need to get mad that people are coming up with ideas for new content, don't like it, don't vote for it.
---
Seems his whole "you should quit" thing can easily be turned into "don't like the things that are passing polls? Than quit"
---
Good luck brother! I hope you first piece isn’t the coif like mine was :(
---
Youtubers that want to be successful need to play the youtube game and part of that game is making sure videos are getting recommended to potential new viewers.  Likes and subs aren't some arbitrary number that people just chase after for no reason, they actually make a huge difference in how fast you can grow your audience.

thats fucked gz saved a lot of p pots

Dude fuck the cynical haters on reddit.  Ignore them man, people in this place shit on everything.

My friend actually coded a bot for this scam and we ran it together, made a few hundred mill leaving it overnight every day.

Eventually started to find they would get muted quickly so we stopped but might fire it up again and see.

Is there a site or something that lets you create a character model just to see the different combinations so I don’t have to spend the couple thousands of coins just to see how a certain haircut looks with a beard?
---
seen 7, sniped for 3 got 3 split 1 one of the snipers was a iron friend so idc really generally people make it up somewhere else, like my friend who was dry 300 kc but still made like 700M while being dry due to splits
---
Not noob at all my dude. Good on you. I haven't done barrows before and I'm 99cb.
---
Magic doesn't need to be on equal footing with the other styles in terms of single target damage output because of the utility it brings to PvP, and how monsters can be specifically balanced to make any one style much more powerful than another for PvM.
---
Nope, just wanted them to prove that what they were saying was true. If you look at our conversation, I argued that doing specific methods for several hours was challenging then implied that the person I was typing to had never done or even tried said methods at my mentioned rate. They said they've done it before, so I just wanted some proof, considering there's not many players that have a 130+k/hr granite 6 hour. The reason not many players have done it, is it because it is challenging to play for that long doing a click intensive method without making mistakes. It has nothing to do with being weak or just taking time, it's actually just hard to do near perfect 4g for 6 hours.
---
Yo congrats on 99 cook. That was my first ever as well. What's the new skill to 99 to trim it?
---
I love how you typed two paragraphs in such a way to ensure you explained nothing.
---
How do you make your money?
---
And what kind of PvM you doing these days?
---
Right typical response I should have expected. 
---
If my creation IP and current playing IP location are the same, same location ever since it’s been created (if not heading over to my girlfriends house or using mobile in public). I have screenshots from 2015 on that account, 2 months after I made the account from my clue scroll hunting. I have my internet service provider changes from the account creation, all same location as i haven’t moved house in my life. My billing address and playing location are all that same place.
---
Unless I bought the account off someone who lives in my house? Yep
---
Thank you for your help tho x

This is a really dumb sentence

Oh come on you goalpost moving monkey. Everyone fucking knows about the venezeulan clans. It's more probable than the clans being from anywhere else at this point.

Wow that is intense

Bruh

It's not that I don't wanna deal with it, I don't want to deal with other players who fuck me up even though I play perfectly.
---
You can fail those?
---
How did you learn this? And where?
---
Diary achievement....
---
What
---
I literally just explained to you that utility of mage spells isn't all that it's cracked up to be or enough of a reason to make tribridding about freezing an opponent and then hybrid melee/range fighting someone. It's why DMM tournaments were won by rag bolters before they started adding wilderness weapons. In the wilderness, if your target isn't tbd they'll just tele or run away if you dd them like that and they don't like it. It happens in death matches for obvious reasons but again, if mage was more powerful, then it would only reward the more skilled.

What times do you get with your solo CMs

I'm guessing he shat himself when the ring dropped and needed to change trousers quickly.

I died, then suddenly had 1hp.  Regen timer isn't close enough to possibly be a tick regen.

I also got mine at 77 agility! Nice.

How do you upload your runelite settings? I've been accidentally clicking the import button and it's overriding my bank tags.

&gt;Why can I wield a grey sword but not a blue sword?

because even though you have 40 attack, you didn't do the elite diary, I'm right you're wrong bye bye
---
Brilliant comment
---
My expectations are so low with the mods they have nowdays, that I'm going to make myself expect absolutely shit non-challenging mechanics and then hope I'm surprised.
---
I predict it will quite literally be a Corp 2.0 where we semi-afk the boss with something until a phase happens where we swap into another gear setup and afk again. Throughout the fight, we will probably have to count to 3 or 4 as well, maybe even 5 and 6 this time to change prayer. Rinse repeat.
---
They are pointless for iron men as well because no one can go to your house to see it.

Dude... this comeback only works if someone else mentions "you are what you eat" first. Forcing it like this is just sad.
---
The benefit comes more when you wouldn't be carrying the diary item. For example, if I am doing a clue I would likely have my helm for sherlock teles, but I might not be carrying around my Karamja Gloves. So if I get the shilo step, currently I'd need to go bank an grab the gloves, which isn't a huge time cost. But since I'd have house teleports, being able to pop into POH, restore pool, and tele right there would speed it up a bit.
---
Also, doing an entire herb run with just POH teles and an ectophail does seem a bit strong. But more so, if you can justify adding diary items to POH, then where is the line? Should the Ectophail and Eternal Slayer Ring also be added? They are also unlimited teleports with some requirements and unlocking to them... Of all the updates we could get, give the place with 5 dozen teleports another 15 seems a bit much.
---
Stun core, use a less accurate cross so less chance of killing
---
Magic does not deserve to have a max hit close to the max hits of melee or range because magic has the most utility in pvp. It can TB, bind and lower stats. Remove these utilities than sure buff magic but until then, no.
---
If you're trying to apply the settings to another computer, you could copy the runelite setttings.properties file manually
---
It is worth noting that the same mods that made the bosses "nowadays" also made Raids and the Inferno. They know how to make good and challenging bosses; it is just that not every boss they make is intended to be challenging. The Nightmare is, so it is reasonable to expect it will be designed as such. Just because they took a year off from tough bosses following Raids 2 doesn't mean they forgot how to make them.
---
So pvp clans will only risk bank if they pk in singles, right?
---
Lmao I didn’t even know core could be attacked. Always thought of it as a necessary circumstance. Is it really that much better than just dodging?
---
Thank you! Finally, someone who sees it.
---
That sure is desperate
---
That makes no sense. Everyone's life from their own perspective is more important than people trying to live their lives. We all trying to live our ow  lives too right?
---
I believe runelite has a filter option, so you can filter the words roll and bet and you won’t see that anymore. 
---
Or just go in a skill total world
---
Wish you nothing but the best Verf, posts like these are meant to poke a little fun, but in all seriousness it sucks that UIM Karamja died and I wish you blessed RNG on the impling grind :)
---
Well, as a person with a maxed 60 att zerker and maxed 75 att pure, i would say being pure is much more fun and easier to pk with. Zerkers are basically obsolete against 60 att meds. They destroy zerker pures. Zerkers are only good against people that dont know how to pk and pures.  
---
1. If you've never made a pure or had one, i dont recommend maxing out right away. Your best bet is to get 31 pray, 50 att, 70 str, 75-80 range and go BH2 and or pvp world and practice 1 ticking Gmaul. It is essential you do that and master it, because if you dont, you really wont get any kills. IF your goal is to make a 75 att zerker, just go ahead and quest and get all the requirements. There is absolutely no point in limiting yourself training if eventually you're just going to go ahead and get def and better gear. If you're going to do that, start from the get-go.  
---
2. low level pure 31 pray. so you can prot maul and use ult str. once you get 82/94 magic and want to learn to brid/nh, get 44.   
---
3. For NH, best build to learn imo is 60 att pure. WAY more people around that bracket and you will not have to deal with 2h (ags) switch and having to re-equip your book every time. Once you get the hang of it and dont struggle, go for 75 att for AGS.  
---
4. Maxed pures have for the most part had SEVERAL hours of practice. You will probably feel discouraged maxing out a pure and having a rough time against other pures, and the zerkers you will fight. Start low level and work your way up. enjoy the process.  
---
5.  [https://i.imgur.com/025Epqm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/025Epqm.jpg) This is a quick IMG of what i used when i started my pure. It breaks down all the reqs needed for basically all the pure quests you need. I also have one for zerkers if you want.

That’s correct, you can only get them in the guild.

why not get 20 def?

get 70 range, 50 att 70 str and go gmaul pking

I’m close to hitting 80 hunter and I want to do herbiboar soon. I was wondering what would be a decent herblore level in order to make some profit from it. I’m currently 70 herblore.

Could someone explain to me the mechanics behind the Managing Miscellania activity? Specifically, money in the coffers. I've read the wiki and watched some videos on things.
---
I'm trying to understand why you need 500k/750k minimum in the coffers for maximum resources. It's my understanding that only 50k/75k is paid out every 24 hours. So... why do you need ten times that at all times in order to receive maximum resources?

Why didn’t you check your bank before you posted this to reddit?! Maybe just delete this post as there is no bug and your post is misleading even with your edit.

Cooking was my first 99 now I'm doing fm too haha, are you me?
---
Not sure for how much RP you go, but you should aim for 880 reward points or 87% of max. This is done by not killing more monsters in the crypt (tunnels) than combat lvl sum of 212. Assuming you kill all brothers. 
---
This way you won't get bolt racks, which are not worth so much. Unless you are an ironman.
---
Do TOB instead. Way better gp

Is that your receipt?

I would enjoy another jmod smackdown.

Yes. They wouldnt be there if they were not part of rwting.

If you're running into protection CCs, try a different world. Those CCs primarily camp total level worlds. Try some random world. If you do get pked, it's probably just a random pk team.

Lol
---
You can either endure the dreadful obby mauler grind and never want to “ruin” the account, or you can make a 50 att gmauler. Then when you get bored of that, turn it into a 60 att for d claws/dds. But never go full retard and get 75 attack

Seemingly unanswerable questions involving desert treasure.
---
1. can the mysterious stranger continue to appear after the quest.
---
2. since its possible to keep the diamonds that spawn him after the quest, can they still spawn the stranger.
---
3. if not for either of these 2 questions, can it be made so that the player can obtain a false diamond after the quest that allows the stranger to appear and attack you again equal to all 4 diamonds at once. possibly used for a unique clue type.
---
I see I wasn’t invited

No not all of us are toxic or have been toxic. What’s the benefit to being a toxic person? Geting people to dislike you and creating stressfull environment? As for this manual offense, I do agree we should all be allowed to see what we are being muted/banned for. Justified or not

Oh I see, I misunderstood how it worked. I thought what made it trimmed was having another cape, rather than having the 99
---
Tyvm!
---
"Imagine judging people by the things they say" why is it so hard for you to imagine so many reasonable scenarios?
---
Yes, but you can buy, for example, a whip at level 1 slayer vs. 85 to unlock the content!
---
Right?! lol
---
Not surprising everyone on here feels attacked. Probably alot of iron man scared for their RNG. 
---
 As I said before it's an unpopular opinion but please. Keep the hate up, makes you look even more pathetic. Some can't even handle a discussion so why bother beginning one? Is it so hard to understand not every one is a walking puppet and has different opinions? 
---
PS: compare some data.. it's easy to notice the difference between accounts.
---
I suppose the mace, since it has a prayer bonus and if you aren't able to use a defender for some reason it's more accurate.
---
I'm not sure I agree with the premise though. By the time you have the levels and  money to be using t75 mele weapons a large proportion of the monsters you're going to want to fight with mele will have a weakness of some kind.
---
Because someone in your group already has 85 slayer
---
Why only on top floor? Does it behave differrntly from bottom floor?

I lost 600m to this scam. And you know the funny part? I didn’t even tele with the pharaohs scepter. I straight out traded all my shit for law runes. This dude conncected with me on voicecall during all this and he kept pushing me, ofc gained my trust and shit and I was panicking but I didn’t wanna bitch out and he used that momentum. He even said afterwards “we were just about to log out since you knew the scepter teles you”. I still feel sick to my stomach that I made such a mistake. I was stalling them long enough, I even at one point said to the guy you’re part of it he started playing the victim “how can you say sich a thing” acted all hurt and shit I felt bad. Too much shit going on at the same time I gues. I mean, panick, staying in the safezone, not pressing the scepter, this dude kept talking to me on discord. In short the distractions were plenty and it worked. He even started calling me all bunch of names and blocked me ingame and on discord. I was like dude at least scam and gtfo no need to rub it in like that. Cold piece of shit. Also I feel like I deserve it for playing along I guess.... but I’m enjoying the rebuild with barrows and shit ngl. Blessing in a curse?
---
Ye dude, someone that clicks on his alts once every minute while putting main focus onto his main has the time to open chat, type to you or even care about something you're saying. Clown.
---
Gz and gl on ur first item! Mine was spear at 5
---
Like someone else said, a lot of it is you just seeing and hearing about lucky ones. Someone who buys prims then gets a good drop from cerb might be like "oh cool, made my money back from buying these boots" whereas an ironman is genuinely excited to have worked toward an upgrade.
---
It's also potentially a time played situation, similar to people who complain about streamer/youtuber luck. The people who play more and do more of the content get more drops. As far as irons go, you might see part of the picture. Sure, they got rangers on their 2nd medium clue but they may go 2k kills dry at cerb for pegs or they get the skotizo pet on their 1st kill then get nothing but necklaces from vorkath for their first 5 uniques.
---
Yeah, I’m sure chatting with you is his top priority
---
saeldor is better than rapier and mace for tob
---
rapier is used for vasa crystals(most things weak to stab are dragons so lance beats rapier)
---
mace will be used as 2nd bis after scythe at cerb,kq,garg boss, and sarachnis 
---
mace is probably the best out of the 3 for normal slayer because of its prayer bonus and being non-degradable
---
And people still don’t get this
---
Usually enough for everyone.
---
How do u make your bank like that on the left?
---
Also I believe the vein only disappears once someone mines an ore from it after the timer runs out. If the other person is the one to mine it you wasted however many seconds passed since the last ore.

It's been a status symbol for all these years and shouldn't be removed. Terrible idea honestly.

I keep seeing this posted, and it's always at Wyrms. Is it just one guys camping there trying this lure? I imagine he picked Wyrms as they aren't aggro, and they're in a sweet spot where people are kinda nooby but still have okay gear. But cmon, most people range Wyrms and range gear is worth so little, plus most player have to wear boots of stone there so you aren't even pking pegs.

I wasn't sure if this was common knowledge and I was just slow to notice but I did find it very remarkable yeah. I can't wait for the next episode tbh!

I think he just meant '2007scape' as in 'old school' as in 'OSRS'
---
You're right, thanks for the guide. I got around to practicing, and while I still go on some bad streaks now and then, I just got 14 in a row.
---
The main tips I got from your guide were to not try to upgrade any tier 2 armor (another guide told me to try,) and to always keep going for both tier 3 weapons.
---
Yo nice tab! How does your invent setup look like? Also my dragon alt is now 80-85-80 , would u say its sufficient to start killing drags over NMZ?
---
Says you, the bot himself. Lmfaoooo
---
This is what I do too
---
obvious joke has been nullified!
---
I kinda like being a low combat skiller though :/
---
I don't understand why you don't understand why im making this post. I have a right to know what i said that triggered my perm mute. Just to clarify once more, im not asking to be unmuted. All im asking for is for the evidence to be provided to me, as it should be, in the player support center within my character info section on the main page. The evidence SHOULD exist there already. I shouldent need to write a Reddit post (btw this isn't a throwaway account, i just genuinely don't go on Reddit to post and browse without an account). 
---
Sure, i said some bad things. But i want to know what exactly breached the threshold. 
---
That's all. Really simple stuff.

Also , have all your alts completed MM2 for the dragon javelins? Cba training slayer on the alt :p

---
Why should it be?

What are the chances someone talking to your alt would have something interesting to say?
---
Interesting, I’ll look into that, very annoying needing to reset at each login

nibba you can literally use 3-4 alts on one 1080p monitor.......

You *shouldn't* be banned with the concept, and a single keyboard button bound to a mouse button shouldn't be anything out-of-the-ordinary.
---
That makes sense
---
I guess getting a kill here and there would add up over that many shaman kills
---
Its a boy!
---
There are more advantages to half completing monkey madness on a pure than there are to completing it fully.
---
Im not referring to shaman kills
---
Yea I lost a couple because my camera wasn't zoomed out far enough and I didn't notice in time.
---
I’m with you on this one
---
What plug-in/client do you use for the herb names?
---
Yep. Happens a lot lately
---
Thought so too. Any recommendations of a good rslawyer?
---
They are absolute tons of xp
---
You should be hyped
---
Edgy :)
---
You do group Tears of Guthix events?  Care to explain how that works?
---
Good to know
---
for scientific reasons
---
If you are staying 60 attack ss is out of reach due to 70 atk req. range will be your best dps for pvm if you stay 60 attack
---
[Heres how you do it](https://imgur.com/31bpMjs)
---
We have similar Reddit names
---
Enjoy :)
---
Expecting one dollar to watch what amounts to hundreds of hours of content each year is ludicrous? Nice
---
Real question is are you going to change your name to cooked turnip after that?
---
It also seems pretty straight forward on what to do
---
Wow, do you have any other great tips for being a sociable person?
---
Why only 32k d bones? Very nice btw also how long did this take?
---
Item Identification plugin on Runelite.
---
That's cool bro
---
yeah i had this happen to me all the way to 99 :(
---
Haven’t seen this post in a few months, bravo
---
2def. Champion indeed lol.

Lmao you have no friends hahahahahahahahahhaahhahah

What model iPad are you using? It seems to happen on my 11” frequently but not as much on the 7th gen iPad so I’m wondering if it’s happening to anyone else with a different model.
---
1v1
---
Had this happen to me twice today let them trade you the tablet and just bank it free money!
---
Garbage
---
Cannon ice trolls
---
Same if not better xp with actual drops to pick up
---
Damn!
---
Yeah, gonna assume someone tagged it before you
---
If you have the money to invest, its worth boosting to make extended super antifires.
---
This is going to get banned because of the title.
---
People who play more have more money? Why are people so dumb lol.
---
I have a job.
---
amen brother
---
Amazing, made me feel the feels myself
---
No they aren’t lol
---
Man, I’d do anything to experience that level of wonder with a game again. Nowadays it’s just alts and efficiency. Take me back to pming your cousin because you saw a level 124
---
Wanna donate some limbs o.O
---
Will do
---
Change ur password asap
---
Ironically
---
Yeah good idea
---
Clearly it was all set up, look at lilsmokey's vid for evidence
---
Yes, the less than 3 wrath runes per kill is disgusting. Really wish jagex would nerf it
---
Congrats! Was my first 99 aswell back in 2008.
---
Absolute unit.
---
I see that papaya seed knowledge was used for good causes.
---
a few more clips of that castle wars game:  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbis3y2_Gm8
---
The feels are strong with this one..
---
yeah cuz everybody uses their reddit username as their osrs name....
---
If you check his post history you can clearly see his RS username
---
one of my absolute favs
---
Common misconception, Garg boss has equal defensive stats for all melee styles, but mace is still best because of the prayer bonus and additional 1 accuracy (and more in conjuncture with the new armor) Good write up though
---
There’s not a lot of profitable stuff to do in f2p honestly. You’d be better off getting some ok combat stats in f2p and like base 40s if it’s not in the budget, then buying a bond with cash. From there you could do a few quests to unlock something like zulrah or barrows. Grinding for a bond at current prices in f2p is a tall task. The gp/hr available isn’t anywhere near it. You’d be better off picking up 1 extra shift a month to pay for osrs membership.
---
You can hunt chins elsewhere and barrage in wilderness lmfaoooo
---
Indeed! I been looking for that wonder ever since, Witcher 3 was close but never as strong as Runescape back in the days!
---
WE WANT SWAMPLORETICS
---
well if he is maxed without alts, he waisted way more time then he should have.
---
You should only be getting damage by, in your case, his range attack and that is rng+ your def... maybe get 90+ def and you will see an improvement... at least for me it made a huge deference before i upgraded to dhcb
---
Edit: practice woox walk and it should speed up your kills thus getting more kills
---
Or he spent his time how he wanted to?
---
Yeah without the Dragonfire ward you have to pray mage. If you have the Ward you can pray range, where the majority of the damage comes from.
---
nibba If you think mindless grind is fun, you do you.
---
Thanks for the correction &lt;3
---
Omg I'm 5 quests away it must feel amazing!!!
---
Gz brother
---
Yeah they are. Sure you can attempt DKs with pretty ok stats, but, from what I've seen, magic is unreasonably hard to train there.
---
catching sharks is an honorable age old traditional runescape moneymaking method that is being threatened by bots.
---
You should show some respect to the real OGs.
---
Are you happy? Do you feel good that you’ve said this?
---
Think GWD or Corp beast most likely. Obviously BiS is recommended. But barrows gear is always a suitable option + a fury for most any group boss. The difference usually lies in the weapon and jewelry you wear for dps.
---
Have been working towards 99 thieving, and I gotta say. You're a madman, huge grats. Rip your poor wrist though.
---
I’ve never found screamers to be that scary unless it has that damn Exorcist Girl for the jump scare pic...
---
Lol must be nice bro! What’s your stats looking like? I might be able to suggest something for ya
---
I agree with your sentiment here, this is nothing, especially considering everyone tries to trap the implings around there anyway.
---
the suggestion was that you would have less inventory spaces to be able to do that.
---
destroyed by facts and logic!!!
---
As the other guy said, you’re better off buying membership even if it’s for 1 month if you don’t plan on selling the bonds. The extra $4 adds a lot more value per dollar. I would only use bonds in game for membership if you’re spending the GP to buy them, not real money.
---
You want to go pking with me?
---
Omg, 9 pies!
---
Check your pm's bro dawg
---
What's your point?
---
I bet it's around 5-20m.
---
Congrats on the grind king!
---
(now you can finally play the game)
---
Gay
---
You probably said the n word or just were flat out racist but ok
---
I feel man. I'm over a 1000 kc dry of a whip too.
---
Acrylic paint or? I wanna try making some and these look good
---
You know you profit from cooking shark, right?
---
“7 months. Ez pz”. Yeah no thanks.
---
Disgusting in both a good and bad way
---
Outstanding
---
Is there any reason in specific people make these type of accounts? Grinding the quests multiple times seems horrible
---
I can safely say it’s fucked to try and be in the wilderness nowadays. My friend David started telling them “plata o plomo” (silver or lead) in an attempt to get paid while sparing their lives. Typically body guards just come in and I have a second account to fight the body guards while he fucks with the farmers. Why do we even have to do this? I’m not sure, but it’s hilarious all the same
---
Im convinced a lvl 3 is possible with some janky swanky method. Considering we all used to think 19 was the lowest, who knows what the limit actually is.
---
Test
---
Yes.
---
You can even just use an anti-dragon shield for the same effect.
---
It's also possible to enter castle wars in f2p nowadays tho ;)
---
Hopefully before league ends
---
Good work King. That video made me laugh, well done! And thanks for the motivation, you have convinced me too give it a try !
---
My point was they had no life, how is that dumb? Just fuck off unless you have something to say that makes  sense douche
---
I know you’re gonna get crazy gp, but isn’t there something more fun to do than train three accounts solely for rune dragons?
---
Honestly didn’t even think of that. I was hoping for something other than planting then I guess :(
---
Hyah hyah hyah, wow!
---
yeah i got a genie at like 1m xp till 99 and just held onto it
---
No such thing as afk or no damage thieving sorru
---
U upset the nerds
---
Thanks for the idea, it didn’t cross my mind for some reason (even though now it seems so obvious)
---
Everyone just needs to relax and understand that AFK, for those in this subreddit, does NOT mean "away from keyboard" anymore. And also that the amount of multitasking one can handle is relative. I couldn't handle more than one account and a show but I know that others don't have that problem.
---
I play from runelite.  
---
Also, i tried to log in on osrs official client.  
---
Doesn't make sense to me for runelite to hack me tbh, if they did, people wouldv found it since its an open sourced program also they simply couldv put a keylogger and gotten my details instead of guessing my password.  
---
I also don't have the richest or rich by any means account who plays on runelite.  
---
Thousands of others players still playing right now on runelite so it really isn't someone hacking but a problem of jagex servers themselves.  
---
This is the 2nd time i've experienced this kind of bullshit and it always happens when i use a bond.  
---
I don't get this company tbh, keep on adding power creep updates but cant fix the damn game.
---
Full armadyl already though?
---
They're afk enough that you can easily play 2 accounts at once while making the money to easily buy bonds for both accounts + more
---
In America I'm pretty sure the national cure is going to Denny's and ordering a ton of hashbrowns. 
---
On a completely related note, never go to a Dennys early in the morning unless you're hungover.
---
I know what your saying, replanting would render that teleport unusable until it grows again also so the extra seeds are pretty much worthless
---
Been playing for a month now always nice to grind with someone rsn: Papa Tanku
---
Can’t stand this way of thinking. Only siths deal in absolutes
---
What clan? I've been trying to find a good community to be a part of.
---
How do you know that? You're the one who posts about doing rs editing and saying how jagex shouldn't make things easier for noobs. Seems like you sink a fair amount of time yourself. He could have easily done this very afk over months. Why do you feel the need to attack someone for no reason? Get help, loser.
---
Easy money. You can run an alt while playing a main or training some other account because rune dragons are low-intensity activity.
---
This is amazing in so many ways, something about your art syle too is really nostalgic to me too. Reminds me of the kind of art we would see in Players' Galleries back in the day.
---
i promise you no one cares lol
---
say n word get permed its not that hard. one of those edgelords that follows around streamers no doubt. sit the fuck down nerd
---
Why so trigger, maybe it's the truth lool.
---
Used 1000 cballs for task, got 30k gp from key
---
~~Stonks~~ Stinks
---
Ironman btw.
---
Have you tried a VPN?
---
Using mith darts on my pure so couldn’t be that, unless someone else was attacking it while I was afk?
---
I'm definitely not role-playing.
---
I wasn’t, but my guess is that someone else did while I was afk?
---
Walterr
---
Thanks a lot! 😄
---
What's your stats now?
---
Tyvm 😄
---
What color of graceful?
---
You all think woox will win this race, peasants! 25buttholes will slap all those wannabe goblinboys back to lumbridge with the swiftness with his level 3 inferno cape!
---
Purple. Reminds me of Parma violets.
---
how do u profit from fletching? the only reliably profitable method I know of is broad bolts but I don't rly want to do slayer to unlock it. fletching cape looks sick though so I'd like to get 99 eventually
---
Fishing lvls?
---
This sub is for this game, so probably.
---
Emerald bracelets have good margins. Bracelets tend to have the highest alch prices.
---
You shut the fuck up loser
---
Learn how to fuckin screenshot
---
Only karambwan from 36 to 99! Could have gotten it sooner with shark or other stuff cuz I did most of it on mobile but whenever I had time I 1 ticked it!
---
You manage to mine - You manage to mine - You manage to mine sOMe pay-dirt!
---
I read it wrong.
---
Think it's threatened by bots and boss drops. Might as well go bossing if you want Shark and logs. 7 gp maples btw, 160 coin yew logs btw.
---
Killing for 60 talismans is a little bit too much.
---
There are lights that go on trees thst make them sparkle like magic trees lol
---
Have you done the late levels of fishing? Shit still sucks
---
Yeshpls
---
Nothing... Did some quests and bit of flipping and stuff like that.. then bought them a little bit at a time, sold and got more and more money..
---
It’s not just this subreddit but entire reddit. I’ve seen it a lot of times during my years here. Love the dedication from people

His birthday is in November. I won't say the exact day since he doesn't want it to be known.

---
My first couple of hours of RuneScape back in 2007 consisted of killing men, killing chickens, dying to that guard along the way to Draynor, getting robbed by a highwayman, selling my shears to the general shop and not being able to complete Sheep Sheerer, and finding a mithril scimitar on the floor, to which I couldn’t wield for some 90 days later. 
---
Good times.
---
That genie’s face kills me, well done!!
---
Definitely not a good use of 'boomer' here but the whole 'OK Boomer' thing has NOTHING to do with age or being an actual baby boomer.  It's about people with archaic &amp; ridiculous views that don't reflect real life, baby boomers fit in this category often but not always.
---
You can OK Boomer a teenager if they're being a boomer.
---
Was that with unitzx?
---
Do farming. You make bank even at low levels. Also bird house runs for farming and rc via abyss. Wintertodt for easy money as well albeit it's annoying as hell. If you feel like doing some combat you can always do flesh crawlers for some money from drops. Also, don't neglect questing to breakup the grind game every once in a while.
---
How long did this take? Just 1 alt or multiple?
---
It's a passive aggressive way to get people to jump to another world so one can have that world to themselves. It's pretty douchy. I never jump, I just keep at it until they see it's not working and jump themselves.
---
Haha i love drawing the genie! Thank you
---
Waffle House if your south of the Mason Dixon for sure
---
Sound amazing!

They were going for ~20-22mm less than a year ago
---
Do you know how to read? When did he say both on one button? Most mice have 2 side buttons. Not even sure what f3 and f4 on one button would accomplish anyway
---
I love this thank you for making my day lol
---
I may have made that part of it my lock screen lmao
---
Does anyone else got more hungover when they drink espresso/caffeine in general after a long night?
---
... dismissive lol after blatantly contradicting your first comment, aight buddy.
---
Vid pl0x? I love watching casket openings while random items appear on the scroll
---
I just use the dragon scimitar as my mouse Pointer in runelite. It's significantly bigger than the other ones and makes it easier to find.
---
Depends from how high but yes.
---
If you fall on your back youd die too.
---
What was mod ash’s mistake he was referring to in n13? Anyone know?
---
well if you play the game you're just *waisting* more time than you should have.
---
On the grind myself currently. 0:3 against triple jad so far :( How many attempts did it take you?
---
I love the inferno btw. Will definitely do some on slayer tasks after I get my cape just for the challenge. It's just so much fun, even if you fail repeatedly.
---
I just recently got 99 cooking too! Although the easiest it love the cape so much!
---
How did you get access to royalty?
---
Don't even play RS anymore or have any opinions on RL or OSbuddy etc. This was one of my most annoying things about RS the graphic details in some cases were so small that I had to squint to tell them apart. Mind you my prescription is updated and I've got eye surgery. There is a limit to how much vision can be corrected
---
Blind Ironman? You'd have to be crazy to do that.
---
Plus, they'd just give up quickly not knowing anything about the game. 
---
Ironman is for the most hardcore fans.
---
Yes it is
---
i have quest cape so 278, i also have elite lumby diary which gives 10% extra exp or tears (forgot which)
---
Sounds normal. Blowpipe gets less kill trips, void has shit defense so getting hammered with ranged attacks is common.I’d get your range + defense up for faster kills. Dhcb method lets you pray range so you take way less damage and do way more dps. Bp is still ok though i did it for around 500 kills
---
Have you tried killing all three of them instead of one ?  😁
---
Yeah I'm sure your multiple alt money making accounts are in no way a mindless grind.
---
most infernal capes are bought btw lol, and i bet you don't have one. so at the end of the day, yes runescape does take skill, most content does not but some content does take extremely fast, accurate clicking, precise tick timing, especially in pk'ing scenarios, solo cox with 4:0 olm, etc. if all you ever did was kill a goblin in lumbridge than stop talking tbh. you know nothing about the topic at hand mate.
---
N
---
Can someone make this a pin so I can wear it on my starbucks apron lol
---
That or literally having a fanboy attack, because you ran into Zezima.
---
Add more food to cook!
---
I bet they would have colored hair
---
Hunter isn't bad once you get to herbi. If you use rl the overlay maps out and highlights where you need to go. Very low click intensity and don't need to pay attention at all.
---
That's... the joke
---
Back in the day I got stuck in the underground pass in the spike section with no food and low health. One of my homies was nice enough to come all the way to me to bring me food
---
Well yes, I cant argue against that.
---
Are you looking to stir up a fight or some shit? What’s your problem? Bored?
---
Tape a wireless mouse and walk around your house and click. There’s your afk dam

If you waste the time you enjoy was the time really wasted?

Sorry about that, I will screenshot next time :)

No ROS wasn't changed, however the new method is to have a ring of ruffering and metric ton of noted ring of recoils in your inventory. Storing a noted ring of recoil in your ROS will reset the count on the ring you're wearing
---
U can dolo bosses
---
Would reccomend skipping tasks that you hate enough to put you off from doing slayer. I skip kourend spectres and waterfiends since theyre rare tasks, blocked wyrms and drakes cause they suck to kill after a few 1000 and make me not want to play rs. I like gwd bloodvelds, not sure why ppl are so put off them, easy single trip often they attack npcs so you take 0 dmg, might not bother without trollheim tele though.
---
I enjoyed it. To each their own though.
---
No, just the people doing it take manipulation of the game to the next level. Go search xzact firecape on YouTube. Also Rendi gets a lot of hate here on reddit but I think he is an amazing content creator and deserves a lot of respect, but people on this subreddit ride eachothers dicks too hard to have their own opinions.
---
Funny how there's no "new runescape garbage" on here ie woox, vorkath, twisted bows, or "queen verzick"
---
This comment was amazing I’m sorry you got downvoted
---
Edit: thanks for my first silver. To those who downvoted me, this had 5 downvotes when I posted the original comment! The silver makes everything ok!
---
If you can borrow items from others, who else will spend time to earn for their gears? In long run, there are no one willing to lend  coz the demands will be too high. And game over. This is really a bad idea
---
to not be a leech lol. it's not "essential" or anything as you can just scav or farm but 90 herb cost is nothing when you're a raider. just pure laziness not to get it tbh.
---
I love your series man, thanks for putting so much effort into it. Content creating is hard as hell
---
None limited cosmetics that can be easily botted will be worth fuck all. If they're worth anything, next League will be botted beyond belief. I just can't imagine a way these rewards can hold value.

I saved 5 hard caskets from using my skotizo kills up a few days ago and could hardly muster the willpower to do that. This must have taken all year?

Aesthetically-speaking the Dragon Limbs look much better in a loot tab like this instead of Platinum Tokens.

Brah what
---
Seems like bots are downvoting my post. Upvote it to spread awareness.
---
This is incrediballs! Very nostalgic, it has everything a first time player would encounter. The easy goblins that are probably going to drop bones and coins, the evil dark mages guarding the gates of varrock, and that gold trimmed armour that you eventually fish thousands of lobbies for! That’s it.... I’m logging in 𝙡𝙤𝙡
---
Just tried to appeal my ban. was only able to enter some usual fields, but I couldn't explain what happend.. And you can only appeal to a ban once.. So I dont have much hope either.. But lets hope it works.
---
I dont like starting all over again, so if this wont work, ill probably never play Runescape again ;( after 15 years.
---
RIP
---
The first time playing RS and WoW , both sharing an account with my brother  is really encapsulated in this picture. Dont think any gaming experience will come close to how big those worlds felt to me back then.

ornate armor from crack the clue 2
---
there should be guides on YT
---
Just got the 1kc for corrupted. Never gonna go back
---
That is the crack the clue 2 armour!! All you need is a spade and teleports to places to dig up each part. Look on the wiki for locations :)
---
I’ll trade ya, a tentacle, a trident, and a jar of dirt...
---
Fingers are crossed for you, bud.
---
If it doesn’t work, I’d be happy to start a new acc for you? I could get base 40 and complete all the F2P stuff if that would help?
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ornate_armour
---
I disagree.
---
barrelchest isn't a end-game item so i can let it slide, scythe is a end-game item and should be place on a higher standard.
---
The crush bonus should be +70 instead of +30.
---
Cats never fall on their backs because of their tails, and nimbleness. If a cat fell from 2ft onto its back it wouldnt die.
---
Folk myth says it all
---
Likely not if you're at a high level because you will splash many times more than you can catch a freeze so replacing those runes with a brew are guaranteed hp's
---
hi starstruck
---
Ohhh shhhhheeeeettt! Didn't hear about this, has anyone solved it yet?
---
range is the most meta in this game.
---
Personally I leveled up to 60 on all the melee stats so I could immediately wear dragon. Obviously that was down to personal preference so it’s by no means a requirement.
---
I’d highly recommend finishing all the F2P quests first though as you’ll be pained to do most of them later.
---
Max stats.
---
Oo woah-oh
---
Oh wow I didn't realize Ely was so much now, I figured it was like 300m. Why is it up to 835m? Does it have any uses besides Inferno?
---
Where?
---
Its a great money making method.
---
I do not regret zooming in on the genies face.
---
Yeah I left my Sara sword on crush for like 200 kc, feelsbadman
---
Sure thing. Feel free to PM if you have any other questions
---
Yeah bro eat some carrots and have some willpower sheesh
---
no, msb is always better
---
and yes its possible to photoshop and crop pictures
---
This was shared on FB or reddit a while ago I think, so thought it was hilarious when I saw it in a non-rs related post with this dude using mod ash as his picture.
---
Could be '07 or earlier, or from the very beginning of OSRS before ge was added. 2013 I think?
---
106 kc soz
---
No? I said this method is less efficient than just using a teleport
---
Ah, you're right
---
I can never save up caskets like this - I'm always thinking "but what if this one contains ranger boots and I leave it unopened for so long, I could have been using that 30m". Of course it never contains ranger boots but maybe some day.
---
&gt;All interviews will consist of twenty questions

*- First paragraph of post*

That’s a real one

I use a latop and a monitor. It works fine since I just use my office desk and have a laptop stand that can put it at just the right elevation.
---
Look up on bis website you’ll see
---
got gloves?
---
doesnt hydra have a higher req?
---
Go for base 60s. That's what I'm doing, minus combat skills.
---
It's the same as mod Archie's birthday!
---
Because the timer isnt the same. Its different every time it resets.
---
And the graveyard/Leo random event
---
Yeah, it’s definitely true that not all diaries are made equal, but I also think that that’s okay. For example, Lumbridge is designed with new and low-mid level players in mind, and Lumby’s achievement diary reflects that. It doesn’t have the best rewards, but it also has much lower requirements than many other diaries as well, and the rewards are generally useful for lower levels. 
---
Conversely, the Morytania diary gives arguably the best diary rewards in the game, but you can’t really capitalize on them either without being a mid-high level player, and the diary requirements also reflect that.
---
Yep and every now and then someone is amazed of him and makes a reddit post about him

If you'd still like to join for one, pop into the cc in my flair and we'll bring you on the next one :)

Yes please. Skilling would be a lot better if i had more people to talk with, and all my irl friends quit.

You can use wizardry on buckets of sand and pots of dirt.

It really be like that tho

If it’s a new account you won’t get the awards to stop bot farms. If you did this on older accounts that would be why you now receive the goods

I’m also English and grew up on a farm in Devon... also my grandpa had a farm in Cornwall. Doesn’t matter where you’re from, English bacon is back bacon which is a type of ham. You’re eating smoked ham... which, by the way, is a type 1 carcinogen, up there with tobacco smoke... lay off it because it’s getting to your brain!
---
Gnooters?
---
Mid level just introduces players to the grind, high level stuff should be motivating to reach. I don't currently see a gap in gear honestly, can you point one out?
---
I can agree on lore, I love rs lore. I can't wait for them to explain why slepe exists relatively peacefully with Castle Drakan basically looming overhead. And what's going on with the chaos dwarves.
---
yea maybe if you're poor and want 20k xp/h
---
No
---
Ahh I see now, ty good sir.
---
There is a clan chat "splashworlds" that pays 300k/hr if you splash ardy knight.

Definitely. I have glasses and it only sharpens my sight but I'm handicapped in such a way that I do not recognize small details or notice them at all and my reaction time is slower than a person without my specific impairment.

Yeah and you too are watching them now. Someone could have spoiled you this exact same thing earlier today.
---
For me it was the first time I ever played Fallout 3. I had never played any of the other games or the Elder Scrolls games before that
---
A spell that can fucking freeze you for 10s does not need a max hit above 41. Sorry you're upset that tank gear lets people tank.
---
The dialogue that he gives me just told me I had to wait a day. Thanks for the info, if santa mentioned it I definitely missed it. Clicked through those chat boxes faster than a lvl 4 attempting jad with an inventory of bananas.
---
That's kind of you! I'm just glad that runelite has these kind of accessibility features. I could play the game without those specific features but it's much less of a strain for me to have them enabled. It helps a ton.
---
Oh yes thanks yea doing alot better thank you! 
---
Still out of work but luckily I have a decent job and alot of PTO. One good thing is I have slot of time to play osrs right now XD.
---
Inefficient! Brutal black alt to supply main with supplies and BIS overtime
---
Rex Bro doesn't need much -- just 55 magic and attack for Iban Blast.
---
The one doing Sup and Prime needs something like 80-85 in both melee and range.
---
Everyone should have lots of range defense, so 70 defense and some Barrows armor is very useful, as well as a crystal shield.
---
How long?
---
You can watch slayermusiqs guides on quests if youre having hard time figuring it out
---
Yes. You can either simply check the high scores yourself which takes 2 seconds or there are a few discord’s that post it daily as well.
---
This is bait 100%
---
What are you going to do with all of that?
---
How can he buy 1 on an Ironman?
---
Yeah, with the update of bh2 I thought the only way to obtain were to by from the emblem trader. Unless only in a bh world for wildy pvp
---
Twitter
---
Oh sweet. Thats quite surprising to hear. I thought they would be farmed crazy right now
---
As an Ironman you can’t even trade so how could he rwt for it?
---
I remember being trapped in certain locations and having to wait for my hp to slowly heal to a decent amount. One that sticks out to me is when I was exploring the varrock sewers and got trapped in a corner by the spiders and giants/moss giants? Fun times
---
teleportingtoliterallyeverytileinthegamethroughPoHscape
---
Shit tier bait pal
---
We dont talk to your kind brother!
---
Only 4 visages? Thats bad
---
Frick you bro. I'm going all in, 7 gp each.
---
Goal is to get a 99 on the HC before I go back to work!
---
It's already cheap. Don't see reason to add it to kbd
---
Real players started playing before home teleport m8
---
It’s called a Bot Farm
---
such an underrated content creator IMO
---
Nah fuck the runes i'm all about cat collecting BOY

I heard they thought it was some kind of pyramid scheme so they banned it?
---
Trash clicks, If i see you in wildy then i will make sure you kiss the ground to my 1 itch 6 way switch
---
Tnx, ull get there :)
---
Just dont die 😛
---
me too, the fishing spot indicators help me tremendously while I await my eye surgery lol
---
You know maxing isnt the only available goal right? Many people do pvm mainly and maxing goal on the side when they want to afk.
---
Hmmm I think I can trim that armour if you'd like
---
oh look, guess this is the only way to be able to post on here since they block you from telling the truth. Imagine getting banned for logging into osrs. Customer support is non existent. So sad that a 20 year old game doesn't have customer support. They should be ashamed of themselves since electronic arts has better customer support. Actually ea customer support is epic compared to theirs. They actually offered to help me tbh.  Bot creator is the one who designed the flawed bot detection system. They ban legit players while bots stay logged in for months without getting banned. "our systems indicate that you've been using illegal software". what software? My 9600gt and my dual core? Im using deez fucking nutz!  That's why the acc with that name got banned cuz they detected me using them. I guess that's why they're banned because that's the system that I'm using. I log in like 5 secs a day and I get banned bruh. I get banned for logging into osrs.
---
Do. It.
---
But where is the rune skimi?
---
I'm on mobile so I can't share the sauce but essentially msb(i) and Ranged prayer activated (such as Eagle Eye or Rigour) is 9/10 better than full Armadyl with a cbow. Simply because the cbow fires too slowly. So against low level or low defense targets msb(i) would  usually be better.
---
Edit: found the sauce https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cy8bhm/how_strong_is_the_magic_shortbow_i/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
holy fok. 99 pray banked from this grind ?
---
Kemp's series at the time was very groundbreaking and I think almost everyone was convinced that getting a firecape at lower than 19 combat wasn't possible.  
---
It says a lot that it took until 2019 for people to figure out ways of beating the caves with tools that have been available for many years.
---
This is going to turn into a r/roastme for sure, but glad you fellas are having fun
---
LOL same
---
Yeah its pretty much banked twice over
---
What was on the menu chief? Hope you're doing well! 
---
Big plans for NYE?
---
I just want to do varrock east low-level mage pure pking again
---
but mostly rwt to people they know that are gambling addicts.
---
No one cares
---
Show ur recent loot tab
---
Saved
---
I thought I’d never feel it again...then I started playing Mount and Blade Warband
---
~~For making a money making alt. What would be better? Skeletal Wyverns vs. Brutal Black Dragons?
---
In terms of money making and being afk~~
---
Ah never mind guys. Checked online, I think I found my answer
---
nice
---
Don't you have to be there for your best friend instead of reposting something that was already posted about 74 times?
---
Roast potatoes, Duck &amp; Veg - yummy!
---
Nothing planned at the moment! I'm looking at the moment to find something :)
---
This actually made me cry. This artwork is righteous.
---
It wrecks the economy. The moment it hits the polls you would see items like tbow, ely, rapier, bludgeon, dwh all will double in price and people will charge obscene amounts to borrow them. You wanna borrow a tbow to go sara with some buddies I'll easily charge you 2m/hr for it in which case odds are you're going to lose money. And with all the money i make off lending said item I'll roll that into buying other highly desired items to lend out. The items will have a high value realistically unobtainable if you plan to borrow items to boss and make money
---
Don’t get reported too many times. Or they will choose a random username for you and you will be stuck with it for one year
---

It happened to me
---
They wouldn’t clump since he wouldn’t be in multi
---
Please change kq
---
Everything about it
---
Thx
---
This is obviously somebody’s 3 ~~rune dragon~~ master farmer “alts” don’t be a hater
---
Haha sadly...  I sold it. But is less than 200m
---
Try changing the 'e' to a 'u'.
---
They have a special attack that you can dodge but with insulated boots it’s damage is reduced so most people just tank it, they are also aggressive so you technically don’t need to even click the dragons. They are fairly afk because they can do some damage but are damn good money.
---
Permamute
---
Huh, I know most of those but I don't think I've ever heard of a 15def pure. What does it unlock over 13?
---
If hes contemplating a bgs I doubt he has the cashstack for dhcb
---
I’ll back google and myself over some hick on the internet.
---
This is really cool!
---
items like d limbs should never be drops from gold farming monsters like rune dragons in my opinion. Completely devalues the unique drop to people who don't camp rune dragons with half a dozen alts (or bots). Every rare and super rare unique is already cheap as possible. i would totally vote to have it switched to kbd drop table and reward people who arent already farming gold in one of the easiest ways possible.
---
thanks :)
---
Account doesn’t have any favour in Kourend and I love Brimhaven dungeon anyway due to nostalgia.
---
Sadistic? Why?
---
Damn that isn't that rare, thought it was more around 1/500-1/1500. I'm new to p2p so i dont know much. Got overexcited and hyped up about it... Thank you for the response!
---
I used to have a 60 attack med with 70 def and that account is now 75 def 75 attack, but that’s it. Other builds, like 20, 25, 30, and 40 are useless or weak imo.
---
Just how high Genie is?
---
Yep. Some food is coded like potions, which allow you to eat a food and drink/eat the next food on the same tick. Sara brews and karambwans are most commonly used for this.
---
I wondered why people took karambwans when they don't heal as much as pizza. Now I know. Thank you.
---
I only ever see it in the mirror, which is like once a day for like a few minutes while I get ready. But the truth is, one only styles their hair for the benefit of others. We feel good knowing our appearance looks good to someone else. If our hair were invisible to everyone else, we wouldn't bother.
---
Hi all, very inexperiencre uim here, wondering where I should go about acquiring rune gear and how Im going to store the gear for later use.
---
That's why I always have public chat turned off. Other people are annoying.
---
&gt;I saw this on Reddit, I'm sure Reddit will love it!
---
What a cordial pro. He really is just a cool guy who pursued his passion of rs and is doing the best with it. He really cares and he re-wrote 1% of the entire game's code in a week. The title god ash is funny, but it's also kinda appropriate with how much he cares about the game.
---
Even if you have DHCB? Or if you only have BP?
---
Jesus so many people are falling for his bait
---
Lmfao that part make a you look even more stupid.
---
I'm going out on a limb and presuming that you've got an internal cape, because if you haven't, i think its time you jump off the sub for a bit and reconsider the life choices that led you here.
---
Starting later with less supplies? Might aswell skip to zuk with no supplies. If you can make it to zuk from 31, you should be able to do it from 1. It's meant to be the hardest activity in the game for a reason.
---
If you're good enough to do this, then you're already good enough to get -1.5 hour capes. If you can't put aside 1.5 hours (off task) to complete the hardest activity in the game (which you only need to do once unless you're pet hunting / slaying), then you're shit out of luck and should maybe find a game that requires less grinding

OSRSadvice. It's definitely not for everyone, as we have rules like no swearing and try to be mature. But those rules make it a lot friendlier atmosphere and people are always willing to answer questions and give advice
---
ye so it doesnt matter if you open it early or save it up. Opening it early and getting the 30m early is better
---
Thats falador not wilderness lmfaoooooo
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Me neither. You forgot "role playing." I play it because I enjoy the actual gameplay.
---
Are you one of those OSRS clan leaders that hasn't had a single moment of joy in the game for 3 years  now? I read the other comments, then thought myself a fool for overreacting to such a simple thing, i guess i'm going to say sorry for making a meaningless thread.
---
Gz! :)
---
Love the numbers. Thanks much for the link!
---
I had a 30 pre eoc with turmoil, but I agree that anything between 1-41 is pretty useless on oldschool. Only bothered to make a zerker, a 60 attack 1 def and a 50att 70def piety/rigour mauler that's more of a novelty then an actual pking account.
---
Honestly that joke was way worse than this meme
---
I opened the picture, saw the screenshot is from Vista, skimmed a part about him making 100b from buying willow bows, then realized it's nothing worth reading.
---
how about no
