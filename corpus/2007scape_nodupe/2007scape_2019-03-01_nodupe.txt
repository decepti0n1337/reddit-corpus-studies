He made an ironman, he doesn't make the best decisions.
---
---
---
Usually Im on Jamflex side, but this is awful- what the actual fuck, fuck ModAsh- fat retard
---
That guy is an idiot, but other people have a reason to be upset. An ironman lost some of his gear that took him 50+ hours to get and another account lost 400m that he traded between 2 accounts shortly before the update landed. Those incidents are unacceptable, but they happen because the rollback system is terrible. Hopefully, the Chinese overlords notices the bad publicity and decides to spend a bit of that profit on engine guys so things like this can be fixed before it happens again.
---
Just a hint, it may seem obvious to train melee stats, but ranged is arguably the most important combat skill at high levels and just in general for slayer and killing stuff 
---
You could anticipate them changing their minds after TBow crashed from 1,2bil to like 500mil, that completely fucked up the economy tbh
---
Thanks I'll tell the guy I stole it from.
---
Grandpa\_Ahab in game here. Gimme your bank, I'll take it since they aren't responding lol
---
Have you contacted @modash daddy on twitter? He responds to people
---
Sounds like ur dumbass fell for it at one point lmfao 
---
It is honestly amazing how active he is on Twitter. Earlier I was looking through his replies to try to find a tweet and I had to scroll so far down just for a tweet like 6 or so hours ago. It took me like an hour to wade through all the posts on here this morning and that was fairly light reading with only a few replies; the time it takes to read and reply to all those messages, even if tweets aren't too long, is easy to underestimate so major props to Mod Ash for managing to answer so many.
---
S
---
And irrelevant for months since he burned his entire fanbase
---
Would be cool if a mathematician would break this down and determine the odds of 4 rune square shields dropping. Let's just say for example that rune square shields are 1 in 30 drop. For 4 in a row, that would be 30x30x30x30, right? 1 in 810,000?
---
Has kind of a twisted look to him...

YOU WANNA HIT THIS RANCH BRO

I havent logged in for 3 months made me get a bond and flip tbow so yeah it’s really a big deal
---
They stated they would fix the problem, but wouldn`t roll back. So that argument doesn`t really stand.
---
Why not make all quests skippable but you get the rewards?
---
Oops i read jon tron karamja only, my bad

This single comment has inspired me to become the greatest meme creator man has ever known
---
It took them 3 hours, bug was live for 30-40 minutes.
---
Was immediately the obvious decision.
---
No error, so only OS profile is affected.
---
biggest during it's peak. just like every other majorly popular game during their peaks. 
---
That sounds like some weedscape to me
---
Turns out it was just a tbow spawn
---
Gratz. Took me 1700 lol
---
I don't think someone saying negative things in a negative thread will really benefits Jagex much.
---
Sounds like xp waste to me.
---
TFW when I almost earned my Wizard hat. 
---
Sounds like ur dumbass fell for the b8 m8 lmfao
---
??? If it was there permanently.
---
i just turned 20
---
Proselyte, unholy blessing, book of law/defender, 2 super att/str potions, and then full inventory of prayer pots. 
---
Then the rest just normal gear for bonuses. 
---
Thank you for the great explanation. I wondered how that happened, but I never figured it out until now. It was very easy to understand from your explanation.
---
They refused to take my semen sample, so I need to speak to some dude named "Dej" who was down an alley nearby.
---
You lost 30k range xp bro that was not 6 hours you wasted. 
---
Because their security system is shit.
---
They 100% have a recovery delay and not allow someone to INSTANTLY recover an ACTIVE account. 
---
Also jagex removed recovery questions which is a pretty good security feature in my opinion.  
---
Ranarr weeds are the big thing that I've noticed. Took forever to get the level to plant Ranarr seeds as well as the Ardougne medium cloak for the farm teleport, and immediately after I got that cloak the price started falling so goddamn fast that farming Ranarr is shit money. 
---
How? Shouldnt he just have the money to sell again??
---
Yes you can
---
Fucking to right we was all new once

Lucky Piglet.

I am 100% muted. :( But I am 3 months in, going harder than a virgin 35 year old on his first fleshlight.

Damn man. Best of luck getting in contact with "Customer Support"
---
I might be rude for telling the truth, at least i dont bring a z hasta has zamy items for sara trips lmfao theres plenty other items
---
Quality Resource 
---
He sold t bows most likely 
---
Yeah removing the tbow spawn ruined my alching tbow only uim
---
Sounds like ur dumbass was new once lmfao noobie
---
Account got banned, necessary sacrifice for a good cause 
---
Jagex specifically mod West left the tbow spawn on accident because he is a fuck up, not because it was meant to trap rwters.
---
Depends what you're looking to get out of your clues.
---
You can find a list of each clue tier's drops here. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_Trails#Rewards
---
As for getting a master scroll, trade the scrolls in to Watson AS you get them, not all at once. You can only have one of each tier at a time, so if you're working towards a master scroll, don't hoard them until you get all 4, otherwise you'll be missing out on some clue drops along the way.
---
Your autism level is far to good for me 
---
God is real 
---
itt: people who think someone actually lost 200m
---
Thanks! That’s great info because I would have definitely been hoarding them.
---
Agreed. I am surprised that even now that hasn't been changed when account security should be the top priority for them.
---
;D
---
If you don't think Jagex stores every single message that hits their server to legally cover their ass, you're a fool.
---
If only there was a way to open a ticket to speak to one of the three support staff they have, only for you to wait 20 years for them to get through the queue to tell you that they cannot return your items because the items have been discontinued in game.
---
I imagine the average person picking up a T-bow isn't immediately buying bonds, especially since I'm willing to bet the average member pays the membership and not sustaining memby's through bonds. If anything, I suspect your average person if selling the T-bow, is buying normal gear they might need but couldn't normally afford such as Primordials, Ranger's, Bandos, Armadyl, etc.
---
Gone down like 2k if I remember correctly. Used to be a nice drop from monsters that have an herb table.
---
It’s always the people who try to abuse the shit out of it who get banned. People who do dumb shit like sell it and buy bonds with it. 
---
People who randomly come across it and pick it up wouldn’t and shouldn’t be banned. 
---
Take as much time as you need to make videos! Your mental health comes first :)

Actually a big thing it feels like, grateful #blesseded
---
Wtf.. how is it even snarky or filthy.  You’re just a bitch 
---
Sounds like you could have a bad cache, delete and redownload.
---
D
---
Deleted account btw
---
i mean buying bonds with ingame money is a very real form of supporting jagex, whether you want to admit it or not, he said he doesnt but I thought I'd make that point. it's much more than viewing the osrs.
---
cause with the rollback it's like whatever you did is still the same. so let's say they do a 5 min rollback and in those 5 min you got a d claws drop 
---
if they put you 5 min back and you do the same things bam d claws drop
---
Ok I’ll try that, thanks
---
who are you kidding, you'll probably lose the xp anyway 
---
Yeah he's making money off of it so it's valid. 
---
You are not selling t bows for 600m. If you dumped in ge it would be caught very fast. If you tried to do by trade. Word would spread so fast in minutes your world would be filled and account would be locked most likely. 
---
When you play a game, everything related to that game, including all of "your" items, even if you paid money directly for them, belongs to the company that owns the game.
---
Oh man, yeah. I was a sad state for a beard when I was 20. I have up and stayed clean shaven for a few years, then when I tried again to grow a beard it was much better.

Not bad I think 🎉
---
Socially inept at the least. No normal human would interact with others that way for..no reason at all
---
It’s almost like you have to learn how to do something multiple times before you can accomplish it (sort of like how you said regarding your purchased inferno cape). No one walked into fight caves for their first time able to clear it. Is your brainlet head shoved so far up your own ass that you think other people’s problems don’t exist? You’re what people called a 1upper, always having to make yourself relevant by boasting about how hard of a time you have it to downplay everyone else. 
---
Who is the fuck is begging for sympathy besides you? I just stated it’s annoying and time consuming. 
---
You’re possibly one of the biggest narcissistic autist I’ve seen on reddit  in my 8 years here lmao. No one asked about you, your cape, or how hard of a time you had getting it because a bunch of aspie children break a game that a bunch of other aspie children play so they can kill their character for 50¢. 
---
What city do you live in? I’ll find you some professional help, I’ll even pay for 4 sessions out of pocket, hopefully they can get you on the meds you need 
---
i havent passed level 20 yet
---
343 didn't add bloom to the dmr, that was a bungie decision, and that's when the entire competitive halo scene died
---
 For example, herb seeds have 20 minute growth cycles. Suppose a player plants a seed at 6:35. A growth window for herbs will occur from 6:40 to 6:45. Thus, the herb will advance a growth stage when the tick falls within the growth stage window. The herbs will only have spent 5–10 minutes in the first growth stage instead of the stated 20. 
---
Are you serious? Do you remember the first week of BFA Mythic+ when people were getting ilvl 380+ gear and +15 keys? Or when World Quests bugged and everyone could recomplete the same world quest infinitely? How about when Island Expeditions were bugged and 50,000 AP was a reward, or when you could repeatedly kill the world boss in Darkshore for loot? And that's only a handful of the fuckups Blizzard made this expansion. 
---
Of course you chose to ignore all of that in order to put Jagex in a worse light by comparison.
---
To be fair you actually left the farming guild. 
---
Imvisible boosts don't let you perform actions above your level
---
I mean i get it really sucks, but tbf some dhide boots and a common hasta aren't the worst things you could've lost.  Imagine if you lost a dwh or CoX item.  I know this is probably the last thing you want to hear, but the hasta is relatively trivial to regain, and the dhide boots aren't even necessary, just convenient.  The fury you should have back within 10 minutes.

&gt;Press make backup button at 10:00

&gt;Starts saving the state of all the players

&gt;Backup takes an hour
---
&gt;11:00 backup done
---
&gt;Server broadcast warning
---
&gt;Server actually turns off at 11:05
---
&gt;Do update
---
&gt;Lets say OP died at 10:07 and got stuff back at 10:30 and between those 2 times the server cataloged his account in the backup
---
&gt;ohfuck.jpg
---
The alternative would several hours of downtime every week to deploy every update so you can freeze everyone and have a backup of the exact second the servers went down.  
---
Well done.
---
They HAD to make a choice.
---
The choice is either a few people get fucked
---
or:
---
Most of the game gets fucked, because of the economy being tampered with and people hiding tbows, the results of them (UIM's killing things they shouldnt etc).
---
As soon as Jagex pushed that update, SOMEONE was going to get fucked.
---
It was just a matter of how many people.
---
Take the most virgin-stigmatized game and do this with it.
---
Thank you.
---
All that matters my dude. 
---
Meant to quote the post you quoted.
---
Well, I can agree that QoL month has felt a bit more rushed this year and if I had to guess it is partly due to the team structure and needing to replace a few staff in the past weeks/months. But after QoL month, things will slow down back to the normal pace. For the T Bow bug specifically, I do believe them when they say it is a case were more testing wouldn't have caught it; for others like the Combat Style maybe not so much though it is probably hard to know how those sorts of updates will affect existing saves in mass.
---
But the OSRS Team isn't just the OSRS Team. There is a big project team to work on stuff like Prif and there are other teams to work on other projects, including QoL and smaller updates. So they don't need to pick one or the other; they have teams that can work on both. The only alternative is to say "no Prif this summer" and move the team working on that onto smaller updates, which may be preferred by some players but it would not be great for the game and retention.
---
It would be unacceptable that Jagex dont compensate for his loss.
---
i just panicked tbh dude
---
was unlucky i'm afraid :(
---
Player files are assumably saved when you log out, so it wouldnt be strange at all
---
haha xddxdxdx
---
wasn't an untradable, it was any stackable item
---
Theres a good chance they arent the same people with all the name changing going on more so if they are half decent names, but with all the hacking phishing going on a lot of people just straught up ignore friendly sort of stuff they dont recognize. In saying that though I wish you luck on your new journey and im sure youll make a lot of new friends a long the way

Rs2 had 2 million active accounts at one point and 300-400k concurrent players, then rs3 came out. If only 1/3 of the games last expansions have been good it's definitely fair to have the opinion the game is ass.

&gt; @JagexAsh I understand. Small nets would purely be for swamp lizards, seems a shame not to be able to do them, though that would be after lamping/toming hunter to 29.; But also not being able to do big net fishing in Burgh De Rott is probably the bigger deal out of the two.

Not at the very start.
---
It did blow up pretty quick, with 200+ opts on the spawn pretty much every world after a short while.
---
Jagex have confirmed a bunch that people who were affected, either positively or negatively, by the rollback won't be compensated or have extra items taken away.
---
It happened because characters are not all archived on the server at the same time so your ironman was archived before the rollback but your pure wasn't. Double bonds for you
---
Agree
---
Something about that Fishing Guild bank hits me with nostalgia more than almost anything - I think it's because my very first main was like 90 fishing and I spent so many damn hours there fishing sharks. 13 years later and seeing that bank gives me goosebumps

Bc he wanted to try and maintain the integrity of the game so that he took up offers over some other people who wanted to use them for personal gain
---
I mean osrs is a way bigger community to Phish so it makes sense to Target osrs players rather than rs3's inflation lol
---
How many of those degrees are in coding and game development?
---
It's a whole different job where mistakes are much easier to make and fix. Roll back happened within a few hours and a handful of people were negatively affected. Quit your bitching and go back to studying or something.
---
Were you at least replenished of your cash?

You can’t tell me my time isn’t worth anything. Get off of welfare or get out of highschool before spewing nonsense kid.
---
Full Justiciar with ely shield

Youre negative, but u rite tho. Picking up one tbow and calling it a W is one thing.
---
Standing there and picking up tbows as they respawn is fuckin stupid. Thats obviously not intentional, and if you think it is you might be fuckin dumb
---
He lost 400m he said in the process but reset anyways. But he was willing to lose gp so others couldn’t take advantage of what happened for gain.
---
Sorry but I wasn't against rollback, it was and still is 100% necessary.   
---
I just believe Jagex needs to fix their system so character backup files are synchronized.  
---
you're right it's my idol one thicc ricc

Agreed

Last day it can be changed? Challenge accepted!

Can’t wait for Monkey Nuts to be added to every loot table in March

I’m 30 chests dry...

mfw we can fix the venezuelan economy by spawning tbows irl
---
Membership starts and ends at the same time you purchase it. It is also cumulative, so if you buy a month with 2 days remaining, you will have a month and 2 days worth of membership 
---
Moneky nuts to donate to cr1tikal
---
So we should just bend over and accept it? It’s literally their fault that this happened. Not a players fault, JAGEXS FAULT. 
---
“Mama I made it to Forbes”

I have that too but I can keep it hush hush ;)
---
Has the new bucket of sand method been put in the game yet? I thought a poll passed a while back, I'm still waiting to bond my iron.
---
I mean, it says more about the lack of comprehension people have. 
---
yea exactly, but they want Warding to come out this year. A Major project that will need so much time and maintenance because I guarantee they won't get it right upon update. All that time, when it could be prioritized elsewhere
---
Stretching so hard.

It has not.
---
i feel you
---
I have been told they extended it due to the ddos issue from a while ago so that I can understand at least. My point is that the vanilla version of the game was one where you had max incentive to be careful when playing. Now you dont really have that and can kinda just do whatever you want. 
---
How can you lose 400m when buying tbows at 300m and alching them for -297.6m profit? So you're saying he bought 1-2 tbows total?
---
With extra steps
---
Was either for rwt or they were just goofing off putting tbows around and before the update missed removing that one. They shouldn’t play with the game like that since outcomes like this can happen and I hope any jagex members didn’t deliberately do this for irl gain.
---
gods have no joints, they can move in any direction they want. 
---
Really disappointed in the lack of acknowledging how the roll back fucked over so many people.
---
Tons of lost items, levels and time.
---
As a bank stander this offends me 
---
"A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways." A 1.2b item is not supposed to spawn on the ground repeatedly and actively try to profit off of it is clearly bug abuse

What happened

Finally some good fucking mood.

so what? they're just gonna be given a holiday off work for fucking up?

I'm pretty sure it is the time that you made the payment and it went through successfully.

Side not: you can play a little after the membership ends by just not logging out, but you will eventually be 6 hour logged.
---
Hey suave\_squirrel here with the Varrock Harold.  What do you lean on now?
---
You did very well on your first few videos before the memes arose. Just keep up the casual attitude, because whatever you put out is going to be excellent because of the premise and commentary alone. Things on the account are probably going to slow down, but you shouldn't feel the need to compensate the exponential xp gaps with exponentially more time.
---
Damn these players for enjoying content in gear they earned without a fear of losing several hours of progress for a mistake or disconnect, how dare they.
---
I’ll need to consult my crystal ball

Consider playing the game to make money instead of begging 
---
Ever seen the logs of an active high volume email server? Trust me they can store it.
---
There was a rollback??
---
He's not saying ash isn't a nice guy that cares, he's just saying we shouldn't keep bugging him with stuff that isn't his job. It's like consequently asking that "smart computer guy" to help you clean up your viruses and reinstall chrome. You have to respect their time or they'll come to resent you
---
Kinda how a lot of us are on our mains. We run out of money to do our current skill, and have to go back to a money making skill or bossing.

Why would that make any difference?
---
If you make a backup of something like a SQL server, you have a rolling changelog during the backup that the SQL server makes after you initiate the backup procedure. Then once the backup procedure is done, is rolls through the transaction log and updates those things that change during the backup process as well to bring things up to date and everything matching.

Go find a way to make money yourself and stop flooding this thread with your shit. Some people actually want advice instead of handouts.

I would say most would remember if they were apart of it its just pretty hard to keep track of people over a long period of time with all the name changing that happens

I think it's more the fact that they put the equivalent value for a real life currency, not a statement about *which* currency.

I wonder what the punishment for the Jagex staff who caused the 'bug' was.
---
Even if it takes 5 minutes to update instead of 30
---
seconds, I think today’s update has proved it is worth it
---
If you take only one thing from this, it's that you can fill a Vial with a waterskin (1), even though you can make a waterskin(1) with a Vial of water.

P.s haters are like water let it flow beneath you.

That's a cool way to celebrate!!

Awhile ago I mentioned to Jagex that I could no longer access the domain I registered the account on and I changed the contact info to a new e-mail. I just can't seem to remember the email I associated it with and it doesn't seem close to the ones I usually use. I've e-mailed support as well and can provide as much identity verification as needed, I understand this is a bit of a weird conundrum. 
---
I feel any other games company but jagex would have anything but apologies and a reset 
---
There is really 0 comparison between an inferno kill of tob and a 4k telos kill maybe solo tob is close. To say both games have the same lvl of difficult pvm is just kidding yourself. They are both fun in their own way but one takes much more skill. And I was never trying to claim they were the same just not the 4 or 5 times difference   people like to spam on the rs3 sub anytime someone asks about the playerbase
---
Can't see the gower bros letting that happen tbh
---
Nah, they put the trees in as an intermediary til they could remove the bow spawn. 
---
who said I didn't care?
---
All of that is irrelevant, you don't need access to any email associated with your account to recover it which removes the authenticator.  If you don't have the details to recover it, then that's tough luck unfortunately.
---
You know when you move a big file/folder from one drive to another, and it might take a few minutes, right? Same thing applies when creating database backups... except the time it takes is quite a lot more (which is partly why it takes so long to DO a rollback - think I heard 2 1/2 hours this time - could be wrong, I don't ever log in around updates)
---
So yes, backups aren't a freeze-frame snapshot of everyones account. I assume the reason they don't do it once the servers are offline being updated is to minimize the downtime - whether it's worth it.... I don't know.
---
That tbow shit really was icing on the cake. What a month. Imagine if they had a full 31 days... Scary.
---
no punishment of course, the comedy of errors will continue and players will keep being punished for it 
---
Erm..what other intent would it be?? They tried to abuse the system by taking whats an obvious bug for free membership or money. If you do that then yes its 100% worth a temp ban. Whether you think getting a shit load of free gp/membership is not malicious, plenty of others do and the devs do as well. It's obvious bug abuse..which is malicious no matter how you try to justify it.
---
Turns out we always called sand crabs as kids are ghost crabs and the mole crabs are sand crabs. TIL.
---
Doesn't wanna get hacked, obviously
---
Idr where but I did see someone say it was like 20k. And you can also assume there was a chunk of that being osrs players looking for something to do with the down time 
---
Picking up tbows, selling, buying and redeeming bonds
---
  
---
Since the membership is applied to the account overall, not in-game
---
Because they thought they could handle the situation without a rollback, which would have been ideal but the ramifications of a bug like these persisting without a rollback were too massive. 
---
I’m not giving them any shit over this. 
---
Or a twisted bow in a tree that you cannot get. Like big blue party hat in Draenor
---
in the darkest timeline archers rings were given to some random guy, about 7 million of them and he sold them all on the ge crashing the price to below 50k, and jagex "manually removed them" instead of rolling them back, also treasure trails caskets dupe lol.
---
I wouldn't say "known problem" as there is no mention of this bug beyond datamined clients on botting/private server forums.
---
At least one of the team is aware of it, so that's a good start.
---
as long as I can safely transfer the money around, i dont mind if i lose my account. 600m&gt; my account i made 2 weeks ago
---
Yeah find a healthy hobby,  when i quit i just switched to Netflix lol...didn't help.  DON'T START AN IRON MAN!!! Just drop all your untradables and bank and pretend is RS3. Gl to ya mate! I worked two full time jobs and that took all my time up,  you could do that to fill the void a few months, then keep the better job with good social connections and rebuild your social life from there.  You could also try working and start working towards a higher level degree with great career options with a part time job on the side! 
---
This is a pretty genuine shit post I’m pretty sure but honestly the amount of times I’ve wanted a 😂😂 emoji in game is real 
---
Yeh you need something to make up the time, start up a gym workout routine, set yourself a goal.  Doesn’t need to be the gym, going outside and jogging equally as good. 
---
Spend more time in the living room with family/gf instead of osrs.
---
Work more make money. 
---
Get out with the boys during the week to watch the football/soccer and have a laugh etc etc.
---
Plenty to do basically! 
---
I just got my first fire cape too, and I was SO relieved to see that it was still there when I got home. Friend texted me and said vaguely, “there was a rollback in os, your fire cape might be gone.” 
---
I have no clue what he was talking about or why, but when I got home and saw that my fire cape was still on I nearly came in my pants.
---
Upvoted for lulz
---
It's barely 1.5x the price wtf? Dropped out of school?
---
wait - are you saying I don't need the recovery email to recover it?
---
The login e-mail is seperate from the recovery e-mail - both of which I cannot access. 
---
Ty for your help I'm just trying to understand what you're saying.
---
Try to find a productive hobby. 
---
Woodworking, landscaping / gardening, something physical, something artistic. Try reading books. Try learning a new skill. Can google others and I’m sure you have your own ideas of something you want to do! 
---
Do you have a sibling/friend you are in good graces with still? Try to involve them in your hobby (or choose one together). It will motivate you to keep at the hobby and try to get better at it. 
---
This is my point. You have to leave to see how many points you have outside of your current run.
---
oh wow
---
I am getting pretty damn close to completing all f2p content. The p2p portion of the game seems overwhelming. What do I even do first if I decide to splurge on membership? Everyone says something different. Ironman btw. Having a house seems really important. Do I do that? Do I concentrate on getting around better via quests/jewelry/agility? The raids and bosses seem fun do I just work towards that?
---
Prob gonna wanna become a member first
---
my problem isn't that it wasn't bad of them but that jagex broke their game then are banning people for it. If players had to jump through hoops to get the Tbow then i wouldn't be discussing it but as it happens it could just be picked up
---
idk, i tried again after the servers went back up and it was still happening, had to reinstall for some reason...
---
Spin flax 
---
Not as many as banging hookers and ditching your preggo gf, im sure. 
---
i gotta play more often damn missed a free tbow
---
My first 99 I didn't even get a skill cape. It's fine the way it is. Hell, when I hit 99 range a month or so back I was surprised that there was a huge firework display. 
---
This month was a magnificent month for the memes
---
Yes, you don't need access to the recovery email or login email.  Just recover your account via the account recovery section of the website.
---
I thought so, too. That goblin got blasted into another dimension by that AGS lol
---
No I was still pretty new to the game at the time so I kinda assumed it was just something that could happen to anybody. I told one of my friends who has been playing since the start and he had no idea how it could have happened either
---
Ran: Lario 
---
Oh I didn't even know that existed still. Thank you so much!
---
I love that you did that. My pleb ass just slurped some coffee and missed the 99 notification because i was binge watching trailer park boys for the 8th time.
---
Your meme calendar is inferior.
---
He’s saying it’s out of his hands, there’s nothing to be done, best of luck where you go.
---
Don’t think it gets more genuine than that.  
---
Had he said sorry and cried about it people would complain for a different reason.
---
Morning, 8am - 1pm
---
Congrats man! I had my first 99 since similar times in ranged and decided to do it where I have my fun, clan wars:) 
---
I don't like this argument to be honest. Imagine the news reporting everywhere that there is going to be a huge blizzard this weekend but you go camping anyway because you didn't pay attention to the world around you. Media is everywhere so it is up to you to keep current on what is relevant to you.
---
Yes you can, I do it all the time along with thousands of other players. 
---

Trust me once you’ve done it once it’s a lot easier doing it again knowing you can do it for sure.

---
For some people it’s not. Everyone plays at their own pace.
---
Because of the roll back? How does that happen?
---
Probably happened like this

Video title is "new solo bandos meta" meaning it is better than scything bandos. Original guy I replied to says acb is better because longer trips and I tell him that he is wrong. You tell me that you're a broke ass and can't afford a scythe as an argument, which has nothing to do with the discussion. 
---
Oh nice.. he did his job. A multimillion dollar company who owns an expensive game (at 11/month its 132 a yr. 2 accs and bam over 250 a year.  Just like that
---
It’s not really a scam if they hand over their money lmao
---
What's your username? 
---
How the fuck does that actually happen but? Like someone would of have to input the item code and that particular tile coordinate for it to happen lmfao
---
People had their accs recoveres at different timestamps, so if i gave you an item a 12:10 and if i’m rolled back to 12:05 and you 12:15 we would both have the same item. If this is reversed, non of us would have it
---
This was 7 hours ago and I’ve been at work since... he said it would be done when I got back!
---
*pathetics
---
It already has a slash option...
---
Yeah I don't think that shows anything about today's update. But yeah maybe ppl messing around. Still doesn't touch on the fact a change near farming guild should have been reviews by several people
---
I'm just running along, see a bow on the floor,  pick it up, price check it, sell it on grand exchange and get banned
---
I ran into rank 1 in 2008 doing woodcutting. I used a high-tech quantum computer, and with the press of a button it made something called a screenshot. I still got it saved if you wanna see this relic of an ancient high-tech civilization called Atlantis.
---
Yeah but I'm rs3 I stopped doing dailies a long time ago since you can just afk 15 minutes at a time for 3-6m gp an hour lol. It's so broken it's basically not even worth the time to keep track of stuff like battlestaves 
---
What happens with stakes in this time?  
---
Do they all get rolled back? Imagine winning a 10b stake and then having it go. 
---
Dont see why not. People have tbows and it doesnt affect me anyway. 
---
what arm thing homie
---
This subreddit is a gold mine
---
Do you think people try to tweet at Ash before the support team? People don't go to the support team because they're basically non existent at this point.
---
can't tell if literal retard or bait
---
PUT IT IN THE CALENDAR 
---
No that’s what the rollback was for. 
---
Those who exploited it with bonds and heavily distributed them got banned.
---
wow people dont really spend $2000 on designer clothes that are functionally identical to cheaper counterparts, do they?
---
wow people don't really spend money on sports jerseys, what do they think they are the players or something LOL
---
wow people actually spend hundreds of dollars on apple products when their components aren't even worth half of that...
---
wow people actually buy google stock lol their company is literally just code you could just copy it and bankrupt them
---
Damn haven't seen that in awhile! Grats man

I’m sorry to say you are not a normie

Yes some of your fellow sheep already posted this. So yes anyone has seen this, hOmEbOy.
---
but not hiding poll results creates bias regardless of whether you are thinking that you are voting for what you want or not

swamp man good 
---
jamflex bad
---
Imagine the server lag if it was all at the same time
---
Don't forget, Mod Kieran also rwt the extra tbows for his new car. 
---
50 Runecrafting all in free to play is no easy feat, big respect there and good work on the rest of the stats too! If you fancy trying members out pm me and I'll set you a bond; you seem like the type of player we need more of!
---
I had to double check to make sure this comment chain was really happening in r/2007scape
---
My brother has been taunting me with Barrows loot for weeks.  Just finished hard diary tonight! You better believe he was the first to see this haha
---
Boo hoo.
---
Shit, if I could have and sell just *one* of those bows it'd probably get me to play again - at least for a while.
---
UPDATE: I tried again and got it! Everyone was right, once you do it once it’s so much easier! 
---
Everyone who picked one up knew it was a bug. Every single world had a bunch of people crowded around the spawn point within 5 minutes of the update going live, there is no way anyone just happened to be walking past as soon as the update went live and picked one up before anyone else noticed. On the off chance that did happen, no one with even a tenth of a brain would think that a t bow spawning outside the farming guild right after a reset wasn't a bug.
---
People who sold it and bought bonds 100 percent deserve the bans, and all the pandering going on on reddit right now is stupid. None of the posts of people saying they were innocent in picking up the bow and selling it for bonds are made by people who actually believe their innocence, theyre just trying their luck. Don't be fucking thick. 
---
Simpler times for sure! So much “xp waste” but those hours really were the best times :)
---
Getting attention on reddit is literally the only way of actually getting anything done. What's he supposed to do? Just accept the fact that Jagex's peasantry cost him countless hours of hard earned drops? What does your worthless comment (or life) add to the world? 
---
I visit this sub for the drama. 
---
UNPOLLED BUSH
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
The reason why bugs exist in code is because it's not always obvious from code review that there's an issue. You don't know what the code looks like. It's probably not "tile.add(TWISTED_BOW)" in the diff mate
---
Perhaps what I’m looking for is a solid guide that leads you to the mid game
---
Was that the hotfix to stop players from reaching the tbow spawn  and where the tree stump memes came from ????
---
Is buying bonds to sell for gp to hurry the rigour prayer scroll grind a bad idea? 
---
Where is the middle one from? I like that style
---
Honestly we can't say for sure whether their story is true or not. 
---
I'm out of the loop. What Happened today?
---
A friendletics 
---
Best not to chance it but I don’t believe he would lie 
---
There is no customer service team, so the job falls to him. If he doesn’t like it, he should delete his company twitter account, and make a personal twitter account. Literally the sole reason for these employee accounts is for correspondence with the community. Fuck you, and go ahead and keep trying to stop people from calling out a terribly mismanaged company. See where it gets you. 
---
Of course... Why was there an add the at all. Someone added this spawn... Made it a 30 second or 1 minute interval. Too much code went into it for it to have been an accident
---
Well that would have saved me time and given me a little bit more of an advantage. Lol
---
Your doing the fastest way
---
Ash has been around for a long fucking time. He isby far my fat developer of any game I play. I 100% without a doubt know he loves and cares for this game and it's players. I can't day that for any other developer.
---
Yeah, I believe so. Took the picture from the wiki. (kind of stupefied there's already a page for it 😮) 
---
duck you
---
&gt;There is no customer service team, so the job falls to him.
---
Wrong.
---
&gt; If he doesn’t like it, he should delete his company twitter account, and make a personal twitter account.
---
Or he could keep shitting on retards like he did in the OP. It seems to be working for him, and the only person upset about the outcome appears to be you.
---
After? 
---
Gratz?
---
I'm not saying he is lying. Just there's no way we can validate his story. It might be true but it also could not be true. 
---
If the cashier told you they’d give you $40 if you give them $20, then yes, they scammed you. Are you stupid if you do that? Yes, but it’s still a scam. 
---
This is probably the best time to get into OSRS. The playerbase is shooting up and we're getting a lot of updates. Also, it's playable on mobile.
---
Not sure if you know about the 'ironman' mode, but you should look into it. Controversial opinion but I think it is the correct way to play this game and it's a lot of fun.
---
Some starter advice would be to download the Runelite custom client. It has a lot of quality of life features that would help ease a new player into the game.
---
Get used to using the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/), it's invaluable.
---
Set a few goals, something you'd like to achieve within the week, and something within the month. Unlocking 'barrows gloves' is what most new accounts tend to set as their long-term goal.
---
And then successfully regained his items? Then they were magically erased from existence by something outside OP's control?
---
Do you have downs or did you just not read the post? 
---
Damnn
---
Hey @isn0w , you sound like a douchey ass soccer mom who asks to speak with a manager at a fast food place because your fries were cold and they didn't have any diet soda so that you could stock up on for your child's next soccer tournament
---
Yeah when you got nothing better to do, like work on the game. Just reply to 800 ppl on twitter.
---
Don't @ me.
---
We're just that good.
---
Yup gone forever gg. 
---
I never said wow, and none of these comparisons even make sense lol. Idk what your problem is but you seem pretty upset
---
What should a new player do to get into the game/get started, it's a bit overwhelming 
---
There was a twisted bow spawn outside the farming guild for some random reason, so of course people rushed there and kept picking up free tbows. They had to rollback the game to fix the issue so many players lost a few hours of progress. Some accounts were temporarily banned as well for picking up the tbows and selling them for bonds and such, quite the crap show.
---
It does fall to him and the rest of the staff on twitter and Reddit. Which is exactly why you see shit like this post happen all the time.
---
Fact of the matter is that this shit is terrible for business. Their lead employees being passive aggressive pricks about a mistake that they made is pathetic. He shouldn’t be talking to the community at all. 
---
"My *fat* dev* well you're not wrong..pretty sure you meant fav though.

Care to provide some metrics? Any proof to back up this statement?
---
Just from this thread alone, most of the community appears to like Ash's approach to dipshits like this.
---
&gt;a mistake that they made
---
Ash did not make a mistake.

You're definitely on top of your game. 👍 I don't have gold or silver to give, but here... Enjoy an emoji cookie. 🍪

Twisted bow in game spawn outside of farming guild every 30 seconds on all worlds. Had to reset servers to before the bug. 
---
Music cape is seriously one of the coolest in my opinion. I'd love to get one eventually
---
I was playing earlier today. Do you know the times they did the roll back? I'm at work so I can't check.
---
How do you accidentally put a twisted bow spawn somewhere

u kno wat u rite.

Did you just call god ash a neck beard?
---
stopped reading and downvoted after seeing you typed “shouldn’t of” 
---
why would you claim it isn't safe? it is used by thousands of players &amp; has no history of being shady.. you're probably just hating on it bc it's a client built around PvP &amp; pking.
---
I mean would buying tbows on ge knowing theres a bug causing a drop in price be bug abuse technically? 
---
what if a legit medically retarded player really didn't know the difference?
---
When I came back on (I was actually not logged in during affected times, so I wasn't really "reset") I was wielding both my DFS and my defender at the same time. Kind of wish I could have hung on to that

Definitely gotta 2 step that email also so you can only be hacked if they have your phine

Lol honestly though I’m surprised how many people decided to abuse this knowing damn well this would happen, and I dont have much info on this, but was the reroll to 2 hours before the patch or roll back to patch time? Cause if it was to the patch time I dont care for people who decided to play while this was happening, it would obviously be rolled back. Might sound harsh but lets be honest, it isnt the devs abusing the bug.
---
but why
---
Your idea is bad and you should feel bad
---
Jagex brought back these 2007 servers from an oldass floppy disc buried in the back of their office. This shits so prehistoric their best defense for planning against this is hoping to God they don’t fuck up (maybe now’s the time for developing a better plan for the future than just hope another fuckup doesn’t happen?)
---
force spawning randoms and temple trekking bog via runelite
---
you could argue that anyone who prayer flicks is abusing game tick bugs as well
---
it's jagex's only retarded fuck-ups to blame considering how this is not the first time it's happened
---
ok
---
I wouldn't be surprised if all player data was stored in a raw flatfile given how old the engine is. Regardless of how its stored making a very fast differential backup system is simple, and that should be performed on every offline rollout. 
---
Its insane how lacking their infrastructure is.
---
I like how everyone is railing you with downvotes despite being completely ignorant of all this until reading Ryananas responses.
---
I guarantee not a single person remembered his random ass comment from a few days ago.
---
Sample size, lil guy. Just because this post is full of Ash fanboys doesn’t mean the community at large is okay with the way he talks to people his company fucked over. 
---
A: Constructive criticism such as “don’t talk shit on your customers who’s game experience you fucked up. Be a god damn professional.”? 
---
B: This is properly placed criticism. They don’t have support for customers and this is the outcome. Notice they haven’t given out the developer’s twitter? It’s because they know they’re responsible. Mods like Ash just handle it like little bitches. 
---
That same shit was said about WoW when its developers were fucking up and releasing imbalanced content, and look at it now. OSRS isn’t invincible, and that attitude is gonna push it further downhill. 
---
Notice I haven’t insulted anyone on twitter. I don’t think the guy who did was wrong to do so though. 
---
Not irony my friend. 
---
Damn that sucks. Just know you on this day you can say you made an ultimate sacrifice for the greater good :)
---
My man you can make them tradable again by paying a fee, I'm pretty sure it's 10% of the GE price
---
I actually added someone after the update and before the rollback and they stayed on my friends list after the rollback. So its probably a different system that wasn't affected by the rollback.
---
tldr she took your money and ran 
---
lol you must have not done pyramid plunder at all yet 😭 exp rates of over 80k a hour from lvl 45 and a chance of a 7m drop. Already made 14m off of it from 50-60

God damn you're dumb lmao

trying to figure out how youve been playing 15 hours a day for years and only had a 1b bank
---
Lol your boss handled that way differently than my company. Only reason I was able to apply for my current job was because the last guy made a 100% avoidable mistake that cost the company over half a million in revenue
---
I don't think they'd be smart enough to realise they were banned for it
---
Yeah it'd be good if they did a weekly save backup before applying any updates.
---
Good one. 
---
Wow thats shitty, kinda bs they even claimed that there wouldnt be a roll back (although i think everyone agrees that this definitely warranted one). I guess according to jagex is just sucks to exist sometimes
---
Nope, it's boring and will remain boring.
---
I’m at 400hc with 5 zenyte lol. 🤷‍♂️

I would say 60/40 twisted bow and a friend drama

I didn't even know that it was down, except that i had it on my desktop so i've kept useing without know it even been down. Still 500 OSRS players current online on this client. And no i have not felt for the phising links, only reason i post this is to aware those other people who still use it. If it's doesnt make sence at all for u just ignore this post please.
---
It's not just Jagex that needs to do it. A lot of companies use third party customer support services and crap like that where "care and resonance" is non existent more often than not. In one game support workers have been treated so badly that the vacancies consistently changed on a weekly basis not to mention that the out coming customer care was utterly disappointing. 
---
Dumbass. 
---
Nice man. Id suggest the last 8 levels in either smithing or cooking. 
---
Lose the music.
---
Had a bad day bro?
---
Love for you for counting them all so we can appreciate Ash once again
---
They need a mini game that gives similar rates to the current methods. It would keep runes that are dropped by monsters at a good price but will make is less mind numbing
---
You can buy GP though, bonds are a thing
---
No matter your playstyle, it will always be beneficial to level your magic.
---
yeah, most people who don't follow that game closely probably just hear people chatting about rare item spawns and just follow the crowd
---
especially since some other MMOs have in-game giveaway events and such and they probably think it's something like that
---
imagine if you started an entirely brand new MMO and have no idea what (insert X item name here) is but everyone started raving about getting to it first drop-party-style
---
His comment is still valid. 
---
Cool guthix earrings 
---
really appreciate Ash. wished people didn't hound him when things go wrong as we all know Ash wouldn't want anything bad to happen to this game and is probably really upset with this mistake probably more then a lot of us. Humans make mistakes and everyone at the company shouldn't be discredited for their hard work and dedication because of a mistake. 
---
I guess that would make sense because i doubt account info is stored with the actual account progress i feel like thatd have security issues written all over it
---
and the official client doesn't even have a price checker to start with
---
Personally I don't recommend buying bonds because it isn't as satisfying to get an upgrade if you didn't earn it through playing the game.
---
I guess it's up to you, at the end of day.
---
most people who don't follow that game closely probably just hear people chatting about rare item spawns and just follow the crowd
---
This how I used to flip bonds in rs3 to passively make money. They sell and buy quick too
---
He is a developer. Not a support team member. It's literally not his job but he did it anyway. 800 times. 
---
Yes, jackass, it deserves praise.

Huh, in what capacity? Isn't that what "community managers" are for?

new players could totally see it as some sort of in-game giveaway event if they don't follow RS closely
---
I mean he could try. He only *might* have a seizer.
---
Lucky! Yeah I have really bad RNG just happy to get one gonna put it towards 82 con (:
---
If you don't like it don't do it.
---
I remember an osrs youtuber called Mote Plox. Very interesting fact videos, he has stellar content. He also had tons of anxiety and overthinking and over time he was so burdened that he had to leave YouTube. Anxiety, Stress and being someone that is expected to make awesome content puts a burden on people forsure. 
---
However there are healthy ways to reduce anxiety and stress through self care, and if it doesnt seem to help there is always counseling nothing wrong with talking about life problems with others. 
---
If stress and anxiety are not reduced for a youtuber it can often lead to burnout (a friend for example showed signs of burnout cause he did not care for making content at that time) or it could lead to fear of failure which takes the direction of mote plox mentioned above. 
---
I dont find your series enjoyable, I find your personality enjoyable. If it was just for the series I'd be gone ages ago but it's who you are as a person which keeps me and many other viewers waiting for more.  We are not waiting for you to change as a person though, that would be the day we leave so if your ever feeling like your personality is negatively changing then practice self reflection and remain true to your ideals and principles, change is not bad but forcing change for others to be happy and not yourself is bad. 
---
I used to put offers for potions in like 2-3k below price and just wait... Spent it all on bonds so I'd stop playing Rs3 though lmao
---
Theres no reason to ever do a trust trade.
---
we hella gay
---
So what exactly happened? I keep hearing pieces of it all but...
---
Thank you for the sensibility
---
not at all what im saying 
---
The New boss that they shall add with the songs of the elf quest would give you runecrafting xp with some decent gp, As far I know he is a skilling boss, maybe like the wintertodt. 
---
I fuckin love this pasta 
---
Theres literally no harm in wanting an improvement to a shitty part of a game.
---
glad you had fun in the wild brother
---
Deff man congrats! Despite the claims people make being dry of hundreds, it’s actually great money and the drop rates are fantastic. Even if a zenyte doesn’t drop you are still averaging 200k a inv and that usually takes me like 15-20 mins so it’s easily 600k a hour. I’ll never regret the frustration mm2 took after making enough at gorillas to finally afford full bandos 😭🙏
---
Honestly just remove the reward entirely. Its not like Hydra is missing uniques, great profit added onto the fact that it drops bis gloves and the lance
---
Ahhhh and here we have the typical mod ash nut hugger. If you stand close enough you can smell ash’s cum on his breath! 
---
Gold bars at blast furnace is about 300k/hr done right. Only a few hours for 75 which is most requirements outside of elites.
---
Aw. Ran out of arclight charges lol. Might go burst some nechs for a while or just finish task with whip. I must say its a very long task. I would bring more switches but I really dont think it would improve my kill time by *that* much. I mean it probably would overall actually but right now im still working on keeping up the process of not taking damage and switching prayers etc. Which i do that pretty well now a trip only ends due to running out of p pots. 
---
Gonna do some NMZ for now my mouse keeps acting up ;(. Might as well get 90 str. Then I'll go burst or something some nechs. I'm happy enough for now lol will resume slayer training later. 
---
Was interested in the video so google the guys name. Not what I expected. 
---
Paizuri is a subcategory of hentai that involves 'breast sex', also known in America and other parts of the world (slang) as 'titty fucking', 'tit fucking', etc.
---
I've been using it for years, and have 10b+ amongst my accounts. So, pretty sure you got hacked by other means. Try again on the false accusations.
---
jagex introduced an item called deathtouched dart back in RS2/RS3 that instakilled its target as a special event item 
---
I wonder if Jagex's excuse for this (not the first time) fuckup is going to be that they were too retarded then
---
Sucks
---
Right; but people hate change lol. 
---
“Anyone playing on the last two hours should have been well aware of the risks they took by playing”
---
How exactly should I do that? Buy a second monitor and have its only purpose be auto refreshing Reddit in the off chance a moron Jagex employee can’t tell the difference from a top tier weapon and a fucking rock?
---
What kind of a stupid sentence was that? Fucking idiots like you are why this game experienced this “bug” in the first place and why I’m tired of being alive. Maybe you and other idiots like you should go work for Jagex, obviously they would hire you.
---
Hey man. I got back into this game with mobile and have really been enjoying it. I never watch streams or channels other than how to videos, but your series changed it. Like others have said, the passion and willingness to try a different way is just so much damn fun to watch. Keep up the good work. Let it come when it does, we'll always be excited for what's next, even if it starts to take longer. You're what we wanna see and hear, not the game. You make the series what it is.
---
Also, every time you do one of those "far from the mic" callouts for something, I lose my shit. Keep those up too.
---
All the time. Have all wildy pets. Tanking out the shit pkers was the most fun thing about the hunt. 
---
I quit wow again after a month of bfa. Osrs is still fun.
---
You're comment proves your ignorance on the client, have no experience on the subject. There are no "cheats" except basic overlay and timers for pvp on exilent, in fact, runelite would be considered a hacking client by your standards.
---
Mod Ash handled that so well lol 
---
I hope this doesn't get down voted buddy. Truth, I mean sure, when devs fuck up we need them to feel what hell feels like because otherwise they won't be scared of fucking up badly, but it does not mean we do not enjoy the game. I love the RS3 and I hate mtx just as much as I love the game itself, but since 90% of the content give me more than 10% that's th, well, it's a price I'm willing to pay, and upvote an mtx mocking post on reddit once in a while too. 
---
and pray flicking to avoid prayer loss isn't legit either
---
Wow did you really assume that we all like Ash because he looks funny? You're a sad person.
---
I don’t believe this is true, but if it is, what a terrible fucking idea. Many devs are not cut out for customer relations. Not to mention that dev work is already extremely demanding, particularly at Jagex, I hear. 
---
No jagex is pretty good with letting content creators free rein on their music.
---
I didn't understand the appeal of playing an ironman until I watched your videos. Now I think I could be excited for for a mithril scimitar to drop instead of just feeding pure's gear and playing max efficiency-scape. 
---
Nice
---
We need 25_buttholes to put together a clip of A Friend beating gf with tbow
---
when this kind of shit happens twice within weeks of each other, you have to consider the reality that jagex are the fuckwads who can't take responsibility for their incompetence 
---
True that. Still send love though guys. It’s hard being passive aggressive to 800+ people all day. 
---
they already have a system in place for undoing redemptions which they used during the max cash stack bug
---
don't forget, this isn't the first time jagex has fucked up and needed to rollback
---
I take it as my fault because i used exilent, either way i made this post only for the one who use any other client then the regular osrs. ofcourse is the gp gone?? 
---
Did he say over your shoulder,”ArE yOu ThReE tIcK bArB fIsHiNg???”
---
In that case, I’d look into doing wintertodt to get base money and supplies. Then move onto mining and smithing til you can do something with Alching (train and make money for more runes)
---
The problem wasn’t just losing the stuff that happened in the few hours after the update.  The bigger issue was that a few people had traded at just the wrong time, and after the roll back, neither player had the items.  They just disappeared.  For others, they duplicated.  
---
I agree with you that there was no other choice, but it could have been better executed. 
---
WASD Camera plugin? Yea I've played around with it, rechecked it and what not, still have the issue.
---
New update added a twisted bow spawn in farming guild. Respawned every 60 seconds. Jagex hotfix was so add tree stumps all around it but if you logged in on the tree stump you could still loot the twisted bow. So they had to rollback the servers.
---
Lenny shrieks 
---
I mean it was posted multiple times before on this subreddit, so if you’re on here you should’ve saw it
---
Okay here is my two cents on the matter. 
---
1. The customer was being upset (and if truthful rightfully so) because they lost something valuable to them that at least warranted an investigation. 
---
2. Mod Ash was snarky, sure the customer was upset, lashing out abit and I would not want to deal with a customer like that but at the end of the day your at work, you hold yourself in a professional manner and should if at least done a basic investigation and compensation (membership or item return) if truthful. If it was found out to be fake then you could do a bit of banter for the world to see and it would seem less unprofessional than not even conducting an investigation.
---
No you should not be fired for this ash but you should self reflect and think "what can I do better next time?"
---
Make sure to use osrs.wiki and not the fandom
---
the only venezeulans ingame i've seen anyway are inhumanly hard workers. 
---
Or they're acc sharing, lol.
---
Trade between like 10 accounts. Ones guaranteed to dupe?
---
Personally I'd rather him do something else than max a uim in mortanyia. 
---
I forget miscellania exists
---
I have some anecdotal evidence from my company, there is definitely a hard push for "developer and customer relations". I'm not talking low level devs either, they want senior and above to mingle with the customers and see if they can find new opportunities. This company produces stuff mostly for other companies so customers are usually devs or engineers from these places.
---
I don't think many software developers went that career route to end up being pseudo salesmen.
---
I think you should try doing what you already know how to do from rs3 mid-level stuff, and fill in the gaps. That's how I got started in osrs. 
---
I was doing a ton of herb runs back in the day, so I tried to do that in osrs. Of course, I found that I'd need an ectophial. So, I did the quests to get that. Then I realized I would need a way to teleport to Ardougne, so next I did that quest. 
---
By incrementally seeking conveniences, my account came up to speed quite quickly. For example, your top priority right now should be to unlock as many transports and teleports as you can. Walking everywhere will drive you crazy at low levels. Get the standard teleports, fairy rings, spirit trees, and buy up all the random teleport jewelry. After that general questing would be a good idea.
---
But like others are saying, you're already an expert in the game. Some things don't exist in rs3, but much of the rest up know already. Better yet, you have experience looking things up ;)
---
This is some serious bullshit
---
yeah its gone they wont give it back to anyone only time they really give back gp or items was when a jagexmod hacked people accounts and took thier money but because you got it stolen by another player they will just say its your fault and to be more careful 
---
No im not. I dont really care about karma. It was supposed to be like in [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/72LMtne.png). It is not.
---
Isn’t right just white mystic robes 
---
The way they do the rollback they could plotentially double the entire wealth of the game https://i.redd.it/dc1n4fh40dj21.png
---
Apt point, but when the police (mods) are alerted to the fact that an atm is spitting out money randomly, they’re going to go and try and stop it, and prevent money from being taken by people. How to prevent people from doing so? Punish the ones that do... so that people don’t go trying to break atms to get them to spit out money (find and abuse bugs in a game)
---
I would rather have a rare chance of couple people being shafted for money then the ENTIRE MARKET being tanked because of the dumping of tbows and buying of all other kinds of shit. They could track some of the tbow money, but not all of it.
---
It's not about their ability to look into where a player put the money, it's the time it would have taken.
---
Wouldn't that get the "noon" banned?
---
yes
---
Because I didn't get a free tbow and I am A N G E R Y
---
Looks more like white wizard robes(g)
---
I got an A 
---
Luckily he hasn't played long. A great time to learn a valuable lesson about account security. He should scan his computer and try to think how he leaked his info (reused passwords etc)
---
But, him being hacked so quickly? I'd bet he either downloaded a scam client, logged in to a "bonus XP" scam, or has been using an infected computer for a while.
---
Adding ranged and mage armor sets with a large prayer boost might not be a good idea. There's already blessed DHide sets, but for the most part Jagex has not tried to add very many armor sets for those 2 combat styles that are prayer focused. Small bonuses maybe, but not the kind that Ini/Pros has. 
---
Not if ur a history major
---
Congrats dude!!!
---
Joined his cc out of curiosity/boredom and like half a dozen guys in there had names like natsoc1488, axis power and other nazi shit like wtf lmao
---
Probably mistyped item id 
---
Most hardcore guilds on WoW raid reset days bro idk where you got that from
---
Some of them are. Take that ironman who lost items for an example, pretty sure Ash replied to the same variant of tweet even after giving a answer to it.
---
I have heard of companies like Intuit doing “go-sees” where they watch a new client use the product, and see if it is in line with the way they developed it to be used, or if it’s intuitive, whatever. I definitely haven’t heard of devs having to balance working as a call center tech while developing though. 
---
I have personally done some e-mail support for drivers I’ve written, but that’s for big clients, and only while we have a tech on site. I never have to talk to the clients themselves unless I’m doing a demo.
---

Nice straw, man.

Just a shuffle button would honestly be enough for me

[V](https://www.twitch.tv/crippledscape/clip/BreakableCallousSandpiperFailFish?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time)
---
Others have pointed out the ironman in question in their comments.
---
If you honestly believe that jagex shouldn't take steps to rectify the affected parties, you clearly have no expectations for the service you're paying for.
---
(not adjusting for inflation)
---
thats the point you autist
---
I had the most fun with making  lumbridge and tutorial island 
---
1. nobody owes you a nice clean spot for any public activity
---
2. I personally do try not to hijack a spot in pvm, but we have to recognize this isn't a rule, it's etiquette
---
3. look out for yourself, and if you have to, that might include killing players no honor or driving everyone away with multicannon
---
4. We see this sense of entitlement in PKing also
---
5. these days we seem to want everything when we want it. We have to remind ourselves this isn't the case in this game
---
Yeah he was aware there was a rollback after it happened. What are you confused about here?
---
Reminds me of Aviansies. But can these bots distinguish between you trying to attack and just facing them?
---
If so, I’m really curious as to how their script works.
---
Sometimes that medium is productive.
---
It's spelled 'over-used'
---
Mfw I'm from NA but also woke up at 5pm
---
do i get bonus points
---
get a life nerd
---
I'd go agility, because I hate it
---
its not as bad atm as it was then so they dont need so drastic measures, but i digress.
---
i asked what could they do at that time because you seemed to think removal of free trade was bad idea so you must have some better.
---
You must be new to the game, as soon as I heard tbows were spawning I stopped playing and waited for the roll back.
---
MATE I did the SAME THING. I can’t remember when I finished it, but I’m terrified to even log in tbh I don’t want to do those again
---
You guys make the best fuckin memes
---
I see I've misread, retard would be a more fitting title
---
Leep
---
alchs yes
---
You and I have very different experiences my friend
---
Can you name a game that’s never had a bug in it? Doubtful 
---
What would have been the point of doing such a thing?
---
Coulda been worse.
---
Yellow 360 being where jad spawns has been known for a very long time. 
---
Had no idea anything was wrong until the 5min timer came up... Antilost 600 chins at arma, were i luckily had no drops.. 
---
Am I "punished" for doing clue scrolls while killing bosses if I'm going for pets? [Alchemical Hydra](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Alchemical_Hydra#Tertiary_drops) for example has clue scrolls under [Tertiary drops](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Drops#Tertiary_drops) which according to the wiki means if you roll a drop on that table, you can get nothing else from it. That means if I do my clues (which I love) then I technically "decrease" my chance for the pet or heads.  
---
I suppose the same is true for places like KQ and General Graardor where the clue scrolls is on the "other" drop tables which would take the spot of the pet at KQ or the pet/hilt/shards at bandos.  
---
Does this seem annoying only to me because I'm conflicted? It feels like I punish my pet chance for doing clue content now...
---
Dude, no one here is angry, I don't need to be angry to call someone out on their bullshit and I've explained several times why it was bullshit, so stop being such a sad sack just because I insulted you, cos right now you're just playing armchair psychologist acting like you know shit about someone you can barely understand.
---
why is a scythe more expensive than a tbow? is it just because of rarity? tbow seems much more useful
---
y’all not see this mans arm, what in tarnation  
---
Its understandable that a lot of people are very angry as well though. If a normie lost hundreds or thousands of mills or an IM lost a big item they're probably going to be very upset. Its understandable, doesn't make it right to harass jmods tho
---
To be fair, they could be rigging it now and we just don't know
---
“All this mage exp” 
---
You probably didn’t even get 10k exp. 
---
Found the spade pker
---
Do this

One day he’ll grow up to be a big chad. A good chad. 
---
Evidence?
---
I duoed Kril with a friend and we switched between doing the magic tank setup and the melee tank setup. If my memory is correct the melee tank setup is a little more random, our kills per trip varied a ton. While with the magic tank we got few but more consistent kills. I think as a solo the melee tank setup with pray mage is the best bet.
---
If you're already using the melee tank setup you could consider training your defense up a bit. The boss wasn't really meant to be soloed.
---
The reality is that Jagex's "customer service" is basically non existent. The only way to get shit done is to get personally noticed by a jmod. None of this shit is OP's fault and the fact that you have a problem with this getting fixed (which was totally Jagex's fault) proves that you have fucking autism. 
---
even the replies are thoughtless and unoriginal
---
do not pk at all btw
---
Imagine hitting a zero 
---
Check out the optimal quest order on the wiki. You don’t need to follow it exactly or anything, but it gives you a solid overview of which early quests give a lot of super easy xp. Really helps you kick off a lot of skills faster than standard training. 
---
Prossy has addy stats, initiate has mith stats.
---
Opposing is okay
---
Political rioting on a MMORPG is borderline cringe
---
You probably are trying to "travel" instead of talk..you may need to right click to see the talk option..
---
&gt; Regardless, the point still stands that even with the rollback, data is always lost and not everything can be recovered/tracked.
---
This is completely inaccurate. If they're losing anyone's game data in *this simple* of a game, then they're woefully lazy. When the server goes down for update their CI should immediately kick off an incremental snapshot while the worlds are patching. 1 million MAU? Come on...
---
Also regarding the items lost on rollback death: death timer should pause+save during downtime. Not sure what half-measure they came up with there but that's a big yikes.
---
icu
---
yeah, i was gunna say, has that dude never been to an amusement park before? the lines are majority of your time
---
wtf  I don't remember that agility bit being difficult to pass. I did it with around 75 agility maybe Im lucky 
---
Scythe is bis at all the large bosses and you pretty much need one to do ToB.
---
I believe very few people are successfully doing ToB and that is why they are so rare.
---
Don't shave it unless you want to shave it. Don't let other people's perception of what true alpha should look like. That's what builds character and uniqueness. Like you said earlier. You want to grow it out and see how it looks. Don't make the rash decision to shave because tanner from high school commented on your reddit thread and got gold for it.
---
Guarantee i get 50 downvotes. New record PogU
---
Sure looks like I used it right. Don't pick fights man, just don't let emotions drive you.
---
Thanks.
---
Yeah 100%, I'm a software developer and our team has two BAs so I don't have to deal with that shit and can focus on producing the best product possible. The very concept of getting devs, who are notorious for being bad communicators, to be the primary source of communication with the customer is nothing short of idiotic.
---
You can either try the Jad challenge and beat the five Jads to fight just one Jad or do the Regular fight caves entirely.  
---
There are no shortcuts to single jad fight.
---
Gotcha, I'll give a melee tank set up a go. I agree that K'ril doesn't seem to be made to solo but it seems like a fun albeit time consuming challenge. Thanks!
---
Good thing I bought 20 years of membership
---
Ezscape
---
You are no one just some loser on the internet so no you can’t mate lmao. Sorry to break it to you but you sound insanely dumb spewing stuff like that on the internet. 
---
 you have to put in the wildy so pkers will vote for it 
---
While the wiki is an incredible resource a lot of it is just people's best guesses and the community coming together to share information. It is all too common for something to be flat out wrong on the wiki.
---
I'm pretty sure clue scrolls are always dropped with something else making their drop independent of the monsters table.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's the first person to get Smithing to 99, right?
---
Give it a 1 in 1000000 chance of getting a tbow when chopping it and a thee and a regular bow with also a 1 in 1000000 chance. 
---
I know a Karen, she’s a bitch
---

So you went through all that lore based and somewhat sensible thought to come to the conclusion that it’s all a planned conspiracy by the Gilenor masons?

They can. He clicked attack on them which gets sent to the victims client so they're just looking for that event and Tele when it's spotted

Now you have 15 upvotes

Remove him cuz u dislike the banter he made towards ur hero you saw on youtube?

Thank you, I wasn't sure if that was something I should just because I dont know how the report will be handled or if it will even be looked at.

1.5 hours from the update onward

Check out Orake. It’s basically what Runescape Classic should have been.

yeah i just read through the subreddit, but i dont see any video or anything ,just memes. where did it spawn? and you could just world hop to keep picking up tbows? xD

You dont deserve all these downvotes my man D:

If your statement was true how would people defeat ToB when it was first released. Since it’s a ToB drop :think:

Thank you, I sent in a report for a real life threat because of the seriousness he's talking about it

Youre insane
---
Even if he wasnt, customer service can be a bitch when it comes to people like isn0w. I worked it and some assholes can really put you down. Now when you helped someone and they genuinely thanked you, its the best feeling in the world.
---
Wow you managed to dodge the point so fucking well I'm impressed.  
---
&gt;In absolute numbers there are simply more educated white people than any other minority in western countries, I am not surprised they form the majority of the workforce, instead of the... minorities
---
Yes *per capita* and *by percentage" which are the only measurements that matter in this scenario, they are overwhelmingly represented in positions of power. Why do you think that is? Do you believe that minorities just inherent don't have it in them? Or could it be for societal, institutional reasons?
---
Are there any cmb 3 money making skills? 
---
Imagine doing anything in game when you know there's a game breaking bug being looked at, sorry but that's just how it is
---
Delet this.
---
Send him to duel arena
---
Roll backs are only for the whole game. Setting everything back to the previous backup (updates)
---
So you’ve got basically no debt
---
Just got to ride it 
---
Yes. A higher slayer level. Besides, training slayer will raise your stats and open different Doors for you in the future 
---
All worlds next to farming guild. Jagex has no system in place to roll back so at first it was announced that nothing would be done. They ended up shutting down the game completely not just dcing the worlds (this has never happened in the history of rs).  The sysadmins has to go in and figure out a way which partially worked but left many people losing billions of gold, not just from the rollback, but items they had before. Persumably hundreds were banned for anusing it too.
---
Low 80's combat stats, is not really viable for a lot of PvM content (if you're going for efficiency). The "best" PvM money maker you can do is probably Zulrah. again, it's not going to make you 3 or 2m/hr with your stats, but it should be some decent money. But without a mouse it will be extremely tedious. So you should probably consider buying one, it can be a cheap mouse to a few dollars, it doesn't really matter. 
---
Other than that maybe just do slayer, it will make you a lot of money while getting your cbt stats up :) 
---
What is better to use when purely focused on making money. 
---
Using a melee setup with the dragon hunter lance. Or using the dhcb at bosses like Vorkath and other dragon bosses?
---
I have been looking around but see mixed results and not sure which style to pick. 
---
I have just enough to buy good melee setup but have to sell a chunk of my bank if I want to go for the DHCB set up. 
---
I got assigned to kill Lizardmen in Kebos Swamp. Any way I can do Lizardman Shamans, or am I stuck with normal lizardmen?

You should start pking, you'd fit right in

Not really, nice going putting words in my mouth btw. I study in a major European city, in my year of 300 people there are less than 20 of any ethnicity other than white. Do you really think a modern European institute is just that racist? No you asshat, it's socio-economic factors. Again, I am 0% surprised they do not get hired as much for highly educated jobs.

Initiate/proselyte is tier 20/30 armour, meaning that an equivalent ranged version of initiate would be studded/snakeskin chaps/body with a significant prayer bonus. No one wants that. 
---
Gratz. I think people freak out too much at jad and it fucks them up. The buildup to jad is big and takes a lot of time. 
---
Once you kill him once I feel like most people have enough confidence to where they won’t panic too much and realize jad really isn’t all that hard. 
---
I’ve got a mouse haha, I just don’t always have the space to use one. I live in a house with a few other people so it can be cramped at times with everyone on one couch.

But looks like Slayer is the concencious so far. I’m guessing I should just go with the highest level slayer master I have available?

Yes

Thanks! Didn't even knew about this!

Tbh setting up a database is really not that hard. They wouldn't even have to host the db themselves (they could tho)

Pretty lame and sorry to hear but i saw a tweet from ash today where someone swapped 200m between 2 accounts of his after the update, because they had different save points the 200m was lost in the roll back and ashs reply was there was nothing they could do about it. My point is if they cant do anything for 200m id say its the same for a graceful top :/

This game was designed to run on dial up internet in the kpbs range, your 5mb/s is not hindering your chancrs
---
You're never gonna get the good stuff without training though, so might as well start 
---
RuneScape?
---
....... is this a copy pasta? 
---
You missed the point of my comment which is my fault. I should have been more specific. Yes, white men where the founders of the industry therefore they are traditionally more inclined towards said occupations and therefore become better at it. But *why* though, what's preventing minorities from entering such an industry when it's so overwhelmingly represented by white men? What's preventing women from taking these jobs? Or black people?  Surely just "telling" them won't solve the issue. Surely black people would like to have more say when it comes to the governance of their country given their situation, why is it that they're so underrpresented in government? And women?
---
The idea of voting to start up an older backup of a game because we didn't like the way it changed is a pretty conservative thing, so the community is likely right-leaning. I just hoped we as human beings would have been able to acknowledge that other people exist by now, but it looks like the OSRS community still has some difficulty getting past that.

I just don't understand the mindset. If you're truly worried about this person then seek the help of a specialist, don't seek the opinions of uneducated people on Reddit. And if you don't care about this person and just want to seem like a great person and get some Karma because you're posting about something that maybe people on here can relate to, then again, just don't. 
---
Black chins do work, if you get the center spawn Jad then go to northeast corner when he’s spawning, then over to Italy rock, trapping him on the corner. when the healers spawn they’ll be behind him, just switch to the chins and throw a couple til they’re all aggro’d, due to Jads position they will be stuck behind him, not healing, and unable to attack you.

Oh I’m sorry was you asking for an alternative? I don’t think there is a viable option that gives the same xp rates as blackjacking bro tbh, you could just steal from stalls or somthing if you want to be more afk but thieving doesn’t have many different options when you want the most xp  
---
Send them to a suicide hotline or call a suicide hotline yourself and get them to walk you through what to do. I don't see how you think coming to Reddit is a good solution unless you just want some Karma and nice comments.

Oh :( think I'll do master farmers till 55 and then ardy knights till 90. My aim is 90-94 for now. 
---
I wanted assistance and that's what I received from other people who commented. We discussed that and he refused to call. I sent an email to a jagex email address that someone else in the comments gave me.
---
i had same those levels are long if u dont want blackjack, but u could try pyramid plunder or fruit stalls til 50/51 and then plunder or do blackjack till 55.

Add in all the other xp outfits aswell and you are a literal swizz army knife running around.

You sound fun at parties

Pyramid plunder sounds good! Do you recommend doing plunder till 55 and then ardy till 90s? Or plunder all the way to 90s?
---
In yesterday's update, one of the devs left a twisted bow spawn on the ground east of the farming guild. Potentially thousands entered the game but Jagex have since rolled the game back. They later added this twisted bush as a reminder.

Its weird that with so many incels the US doesn't suffer a population decline. Instead it's japan that does. You know why? Because asians are predominately incels. A disproportionate amount of incels on reddit for example are asian. Amazing how far more racist, sexist misogynistic, and virgin asians are.

Don't encourage him, it's probably the best day in his life now ffs.

Just Google "Suicide Prevention" 
---
It's great you got the help you were looking for; but I really don't see how a RuneScape Reddit page that has the purpose for people to share achievements/memes/updates etc is the correct place, in your mind, to seek help for somebody in-game that wants to kill themselves. Also in my opinion I can't see that person being very grateful that you're posting about a critical time in their life on the OSRS Reddit for everyone to see. 
---
I bet everyone looked down to check then it was "meh".

Upvote for the post, but commenting for the flare. is your name Matt King or are you a fan of Super Hans?

Can't say I check Twitter, but I check the osrs website daily(multiple times a day even). I like to stay current with any poll, update, server issues,bts,annoucments or anything else they post from time to time(like charity or merch store stuff).

Explain to me how to be a racist but not a tribalist.

Have you played any Bethesda game ever? Only difference there is that they let their own community fix the bugs instead of doing it themselves.

If they don't even know what a tbow is then it prolly looks innocent.

TOB 416. 
---
Yeah it’s called harpooning whales, I.e. your mom 
---
&gt; they’ll hit Jad then all the healers
---
This is what I meant specifically. The wiki says chins hit in a 3x3 area. But I think Jad is already 3x3 or more than 3x3, so I don't know if this area includes the squares in which healers stand.

yeah unfortunately i finished this raid then started hearing about this tbow glitch

Did you not read any of this sub from the last 12 hours?

Likewise, thats why im glad that polls, updates, server issues and such are usually mentioned in game, as an alert.

I would love to see the study that obtained that statistic. I want to know how many people they tested. In order to have gotten that information, they had to ask volunteers to create 2 different resumes and submit to a large enough set of companies to aquire accurate data for that type of thing. If this was a study done with 10's of thousands of people then sure, but if it was a study done with 50 people one time, I'm less likely to believe that statistic. Twice as likely to get any job for being white sounds like a crock of horse shit to me initially so you better have a study to back that up.
---
Dental floss?
---
Im fairly high level but if I see something worth a few K and have space I still pick it up. Never been called out on it but wouldnt care anyway.
---
If youre new definitely no shame in it. There are better ways to make money than scavenging after you have trained your skills or combat stats however.
---
No, not in game, the osrs front page where all the news happens.
---
I lost 1.3b from me and a friend having different save states.. as much as I hope all items can be returned, I doubt it will be possible. I know pets gained and lost due to this issue will not be returned so although they could refund in term of bonds to let me buy back the items, I am not sure they would add untradables back.
---
After you finished the game. Look into mods like beyond Skyrim.
---
my GF gave me the herp but it got rolled back fk ye
---
I'm on phone but it was done more than once with some years distance in between. Look up resume whitening and black vs white resume names on google
---
My bad about the adult life comment, I see now you behave worse than a child. 
---
I truly feel sorry for you that you would get this angry over RS. It might be time to take a step back from the game and relax a little. Shit talking people on forums is fine but you may start doing it in your day to day life to people who matter to you. 
---
Don't be that person. Hope your issues in and out of the game get fixed.
---
I've still got the placeholder in my bank
---
Yes thats great, but my issue was that I had no idea that a rollback even occured until 8pm last night, because I was playing the game
---
Thanks for specifying which one is you in this meme. Very cool. 
---
Really? Would it be better to maybe try to do 2 trips in one go or just tele out to castle wars to restore and go again? 
---
I'm a little over a month in and I don't even wanna check my total hours played. I have like 1300 total, I play too much
---
Are you sure? I thought they changed this a long time ago.
---
No I wouldnt this game has much more emotional value to me. Been playing it for 15 years on and off. Its a part of my life now.
---
My point was simply highlighting that I wouldn't see a problem with the item being given back due to it having 0 impact on the economy as it has no value due to being untradable. But knowing Jagex if they make exception for one it would create a lot of backlash so will probs be the standard 'sorry no'

Happens way too often xd

I'm going to do it. When I use to play I used to be really bad for real world trading. At least itll keep me away from that. 
---
Because hiring costs money. And they have to interview people for certain positions, they can't just hire any person off the street of is fresh out of Uni (college for us Americans). The interview process is itself costs money, time is money. 
---
Wow reading all the replies below this made me forget I was on the osrs sub 😂
---
For sure. There's videos on it, but I'll explain the best I can just to get you an idea; it isn't *too* hard, just takes a bit of attention.
---
Basically, for the melee brothers, after they spawn, you sprint to the opposite side of the coffin until you're on an edge-tile and they are, too. Then, with **run off**, which is super important, manually cast a spell at them. As soon as you step to the side one square and start casting, you **ctrl + click** to the next cardinal direction's square. (i.e. Verac is on the south east side of the coffin, you're on the south west, you manually cast, then as you're casting, ctrl + click the northwesternmost square)
---
Then repeat! It's really simple to execute. Take note, though, that two of the brothers work a little different, but I don't remember which; You can only safespot them on the broad side of the coffin or something. But! I highly recommend it, saves a lot of money, just costs some more time.
---
every time i see a post to do with sand crabs i cant help but think someone finally screenshotted me talking shit at some stupid crasher

Well, Cyrisus sends you to get his stuff from his bank in the Dream Mentor quest.

&gt;went to the tbow spawn
---
stop bug abusing then
---
He needs to die because he called Kieren some names? 
---
No thank you, Im good the way it is and I don't want to pay more for membership. I personally have only had to contact Jagex 2 or three times, and each time they got back to me in a reasonable amount of time, an amount of time from what I would expect from paying pocket change every day for something I obtain a massive amount of enjoyment from. I mean sure, i'll definitely pay more if I had to and if it meant more stuff, but I personally have had nothing but acceptable interactions given the price. 
---
Maybe its the autism finally kicking in lol 
---
We were talking shit to each other and i found it funny...
---
Haven't been in-game yet today. Guessing the tbow is crashing hard? 
---
Now up the ante
---
That would constitute systemic racism if groups of people are actively trying to keep it that way. Class warfare is a thing in the US, but in Europe that is really not a thing.
---
Step 1: buy some unfinished darts and feathers
---
Step 2: do Ardy diaries
---
Step 3: buy a stock of Dodgy necklaces and brews
---
Step 4 (optional): get thieving outfit, if level 50
---
Step 5: afk thieve at Ardy knight, and fletch when you’re stunned.
---
Think about how many hours you’ve already put into your account/accounts, realize you’re talking about 3 hours, and just shit the fuck up. 
---
I’m so tired of seeing people complaining about 3 hours when 99% of people on this sub bitching  have hundreds of hours invested. 3 hours is NOTHING in RS
---
oh damn i didnt realize you couldnt cannon in catacomd. id have to recoil them to kill them, maybe its an unrealistic goal hahaha

The point of a TLDR is to make the text shorter...not longer.
---
The player run games of chance rule includes participants, not just the ones running it. 
---
what are you talking about its all hands on deck when something happens. All these services people are suggesting cost money, and i'll just say exactly what I said on another "just hire more employees" post. Given that I pay less than 50 cents a day for something I get much more worth of enjoyment from, im OK with the ways things are. 
---
More services like these means bigger monthly fees, and I have been playing runescape for a LONG time, thousands of hours, and nothing bad has ever happened to me. I'll take the current situation given the price I pay for what I get, and if the time comes where they expand their team and raise the price, I will pay more. 
---
Where's the lie tho?
---
Ok then have a nice day :)
---
Lol, I guess I’ll pass
---
Plus, people who spent a lot of time playing Runescape likely don't look after themselves, and blame their inexperience with women on the women themselves. Although it's a bit of a stereotype, hardcore gamers are probably more likely to be incels.
---
I always try to tell him thank you for taking the time for me.
---
Chances are slim unless someone takes up the project. It’s possible but it would be a ton of work to figure out and would probably only ever be on Android 
---
Yeah it can take up needed bank spaces so it’s a bit silly 
---
Excellent argument
---
This is cute as heck
---
But what if that brainlet actually won and didn’t get scammed? Would he become big brain?
---
Bank spaces are limited?
---
Apologies, didn't mean to be a dick about it
---
We need a February only drama calender
---
:)
---
Where his arm tho?
---
Theres the fairy ring BIP but you need 50 agility for the shortcut, a bit of a run if you dont want to pay for to scrolls/tabs.
---
Yeah, you can have 800 different things in the bank, and they give you 8 more if you have a pin, and another 8 for setting up an Authenticator. F2P only has 400 spaces, plus the optional extra 16
---
There have ready been plenty of answers, but I'll pile on too. Pick up whatever you like. If someone dropped it they did so because they do not want it anymore. Add me if you have any more questions!
---
RSN: 2 dads haver
---
&gt;but in the developer world there is currently a push to have support integrated into developer roles.

That is such a massive waste of the company's resources. Lol

Yikes. I had no idea.

I’m a new player and only have about 100 items in the bank so far. 
---
Says the guy who literally gets his politics from Brooklynite millionaire podcast hosts
---
Ok, thanks. I have absolutly no knowledge of how this stuff works, but I figured it would be difficult. Here's to hoping someone picks this up as their project!
---
*You'd* pay more. Does mean others will or can. Businesses normally try to find a medium between maximizing profit and catering to a number of consumers. If they raise membership, they *will* lose members and, because they stopped the payment at 11$, I'm guessing that's near the peak of the iceberg.
---
This is the funniest picture ever
---
As the other reply said, the whole point is that it doesn't matter. You start when you start and it ends when it ends. Then you reconcile the transaction log.
---
So you're supposed to read through the whole wiki before even playing?
---
What the fuck have your parents do to you, you efficient little monkeys?
---
Just play the game. 
---
You too enjoy the weekend &lt;3

Thieving

When i see system update i go “huh whats goin on?” And i look at the osrs website like any normal none bitchy person you lost 100k wcing xp and are whining. Main websites exist for a reason utilize it. Stop whining i saw so many gyazos of peoplw getting pet or item drops during the bug that got rolled back... and your crying over 100k wcing xp a skill thats afk to begin with. Get real.
---
Why the fuck would you even go bossing after something so game breaking a server rollback is extremely likely anyway?
---
What's your source on this? 
---
I like the subreddit drama tbh. Its always fun and the comments making me fucking laugh
---
yea, i lost my ring of life watching Jojo while doing some wintertodt, thats why i want to train magic, so i can get another ring of life

If he didn’t die he wouldn’t have lost anything… how does that compare to logging in and seeing you’ve been hacked because of Jed.
---
A bit off topic; is there a subreddit for these types of memes?
---
In your Amazon example, there was never a signature. This is a calculated risk that they have accepted.
---
With gold selling, they presumably have screenshots/videos/something to confirm that the transaction had been completed.
---
This is literally one of the most upvoted posts already in the last 24 hours. 
---
i will go for the agility pyramid 10k per lap sounds pretty good, thanks!
---
Lmao I didn't even notice, that's so funny
---
When I was in Singapore I didn't have too much of an issue with ping about 50-60ms similar with Hong Kong. Outside of these small countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia the game was literally unplayable. Interestingly when playing from Japan the game defaults to West Coast US worlds with a pretty low ping. I would like to see some SEA worlds in the future.
---
Probably cant afford prims yet, not like its cheap
---
But can you read? He said ancestral bottoms at TOB. TOB doesn't give ancestral bottoms leading to the joke about a glitch

Why is that? If you wear god affiliated robes your defence is almost nonexistent anyway. 1 pray switch missed and you guarantee death

?

Let’s hear the argument for being a retard for getting barrows gloves. 
---
I hope that you tuber keeps that video up forever, watched like 2 mins and I'm just like wtf
---
And just to add on, it's out of his or anyone's control to grant 14 days membership.  If you think anybody at that company can grant that, mere hours after a huge disaster at their company, then you honestly don't know anything.  Companies can't just give away their subs without going through dozens of red tape.  If this is your first game, then it makes sense you're inexperienced.
---
Wouldn’t even be hard to get this in via the lore! Maybe one of the justiciars was captured / killed in combat so they took his armor and tried to imbue it with some big dick zamorakian energy, resulting in the justiciar (corrupted) set. 
---
prims come before tassets and definitelyyyyyy before bcp

I never thought about it, but I would also love to try these. I do believe that they all suck.

Yo fam! I remember seeing you xD wasn't there also a guy leading people there from Lumbridge completely separate from you? Lol
---
I was the IronMan that spotted you btw
---
Such a strong tendency to refer to people as retarded or idiotic for seeking barrows. Someone must have some deep seeded anger issues. Calm down, bud. 
---
Can we see a buff for the strung rabbit foot? Currently it increases the chance of finding a bird's egg or a ring in a bird's nest rather than seeds from a rate of 3/100 to 3/95.
---
I was thinking making changing the the effect to only increase the chance of finding a bird's nest to 3/90 or so.
---
So uncivilized barbarians and people with no wordly posessions? Ill give you the wildy though
---
This is the autism I’d expect from a Runecrafting flair.
---
Its already best stab bonus in slot, so no
---
Oh wtf they rolled back to 10min before update?
---
Because it's jamflex. They don't care about casual players lol.
---
The whole ancient spellbook? 
---
WHY ARE WE ARGUING SEMANTICS!?  Lol.  Rwt and buying gold makes you terrible and if it did happen it was deserved, I was just saying there’s a chance it could be disputed is all. Ultimately, I’m unaffected by the rollback in every way so I’m unbothered either way. 
---
yes PLEASE
---
Rising up!
---
Where else are people supposed to go when the support team doesn't respond on twitter and the main website doesn't offer anything that can help him? 
---
Is he not justifiably angry? That a massive bug lost him 50-100 hours of playtime (the expected time to make that sort of cash) and that he's left in the dark about it? Ash isn't the one in charge, but he's pretty much the only one on Twitter that is going to listen to his story. 
---
Jagex should do better.
---
Why not just make all magic more accurate while ur at it
---
Everyone’s got 95+ mage in the wild and hides are free so magic def is through the roof anyways
---
I’ve already purchased a bil worth of god magic items in preparation. See you chumps at the bank
---
I bet 5m one time and won, of course I didn't do it twice. 
---
Good luck with your future gaming endavours. 
---
So I wanna do DS2 for Vorkath my question is this. I dont have void but can sell off like half my bank for DHCB, is that worth it or should I just use a hasta or something with melee?
---
The amount of original content produced since Swampletics is amazing. Personally I love all these new series, I often find them a lot more interesting than the old OSRS content. But of course no need to watch it if you don't.
---
I feel you. Not proud of this but my dumbass made a solid main, around 150qp around 4-5 years ago. Hated quests and agility to the point I risked my account to bot agility after spending a Fuckton of all legit time and got caught/banned. Long story short I have quest cape almost 2.1k total on new account and can say questing easily makes this game comfier than doing anything else (also having at least ~70 agility by the time your reaching high level). Do it. Think of it as a Time saver/investment.
---
That's awesome, will you be doing all the towns? Can't wait to see that.
---
My pride
---
Just read it, goddam lol 
---
There was a few ppl leading noobs to the coins lol. But yeah I was just one account :D
---
Are you SERIOUS lol? Wow has some of the worst fucking issues I've ever came across.
---
Were you not there just a few months ago when the stat squish happened? The game was literally unplayable for more than a week.
---
Have you never done mythic dungeons? The one where you throw the orb around, the orb can literally get stuck in the ground, causing you to lose your key.
---
Wow is littered with bugs that the dev's just fucking ignore. These guys had an accident that they fixed in under a day. Wow accidents can go for weeks before they even address it, IF they even address it.
---
Wait is Jed actually in jail?
---
I don't give a fuck about 100k woodcutting xp, I care that in order to find out about a rollback I have to happen across a news update that came out an hour after the rollback happened, without anything **IN GAME** mentioning it, and instead I have to see people talking about it at the GE before I even know it happened,  how is that so hard to understand?
---
My virginity
---
I agree on all points (and was also completely unaffected).
---
And we were arguing semantics because it is fun, probably.
---
Ancient magicks lol
---
hey amigo, welcome to america. he was being sarcastic. 
---
People that clam pk me while I do a greater demon task in monk robes. 
---
Not everyone plays by efficiency though, I see plenty of folks rocking d boots with bandos at ge
---
Nah i havent
---
This happened to me for 50M yesterday (Made a post about this earlier) but the sellers we're okay with it and anyone else that day that got their gold rolled back got their money back again (In game money not what you paid) 
---
no sir! i recently grinded out 99 defence for my range tank build so i just face tanked it with veracs!
---
OMG how much time?
---
Tree Spirits in the Enchanted Valley (Fairy Ring BKQ) have mithril axe listed as a common drop on the wiki.
---
Buff the cape for no reason? Na.
---
Stab isn't used as the main method anywhere except corp, but people do use it at corp.
---
Just an FYI "because its not BIS" isn't a reason to buff anything ever.
---
Actually kind of worked out for me on my ironman. I was doing defender grind, used about 800 tokens and only went from iron to black. After rollback I got all my tokens back and got to rune in less than the same 800.
---
Can I get in on this downvote action?
---
im thinking of all the flexing possibilities :')
---
There is no argument. This guy is just a troll.
---
1000 bucks says OP is the author. Account is 3 days old and it’s called throwaway. He prob surfs this sub on his main and thought posting here would be easy views.
---
I just use tele tabs. I grind out a heap of mage xp making them and hydrating the clay and then i have 1 click teles to everywhere. also less invens
---
Sure, he's justifiably angry, but he's throwing a tantrum and threatening to quit, and Ash took the time our of his shit show of a day to respond, fairly neutrally.  You can't take your anger out on the people trying to help, if you do you don't deserve any sympathy just like the guy who lost that money.
---
Yeah I'm happy they made a news post, but unless you were going to go on their twitter / main website anyway, it was kind of useless.
---
Just a little in game notification saying their was a rollback and linking to their website post would have been extremely appreciated.
---
But “one can easily make the argument”! If it’s so easy I want to hear it just out of curiosity. 
---
&gt;30m I made from flipping while people dumped gear to buy tbows
---
That's kind of the point if the rollback
---
There is a jad simulator, uses the rs3 version, but the audio is the same. 
---
God damn I love RuneScape! xD
---
Because of this post....
---
How does it feel being a complete fucking retard
---
I'm actually asking
---
You trade in the cats for death runes so if we do that (which I think we should) the cat shouldn't be able to be traded in for death runes and has to be set free. Seems to be fair without making ironmen lose access to early deathrunes if they want them
---
Would void armor count as guthix armor?
---
That's like saying rune scim should be BIS just because it was once the best weapon in the game
---
Best food at wintertodt? I find myself banking too much to get more food currently. Standard account, 65FM, 70HP. 
---
Patch notes:
---
* Increased the defence requirements of all dragon-hide armour pieces to be equivalent to their ranged requirements. This was done to compensate for the high level of defence offered by dragonhide.
---
He likely used worldedit (or whatever the equivalent is nowadays) for the majority
---
They could add new types of god robes with warding :)
---
Eric Andre
---
What could they have done to please literally everyone? 
---
"REEEEEE ROLLBACK THE SERVERS!"
---
"I lost my pixels because you rolled back the servers! Nice developers, genius!"
---
Like fuck off man, grow up. 
---
In order of importance, here are my tips:
---
* Use ultracompost as /u/SpackyJack said. 
---
On top of having a lower chance of disease, an herb patch treated with ultracompost will guarantee at a minimum of 6 herbs on successful harvest. Supercompost only guarantees a minimum of 5 herbs. Ranarrs sell for much more than ultracompost, so you'll definitely come out ahead.
---
* **Equip** magic secateurs. 
---
They have no effect when they're sitting in your inventory. This increases average yield by 10%.
---
* Use as many disease free patches as possible, and **still use ultracompost** on these patches.
---
1. Hosidius Farming Patch - Disease free with at least 50% Hosidius favor
---
* Trollheim Herb Patch - Requires My Arm's Big Adventure
---
* Weiss Herb Patch - Requires Making Friends with My Arm
---
* Harmony Island - Requires Morytania Elite Diary
---
* Do multiple runs a day.
---
You're not going to make earth shattering amounts of money doing only one run a day. I recommend at least 3-5 runs a day.
---
* Be patient.
---
Yields increase with a higher farming level. You should still be turning a profit at the minimum for planting ranarrs, but profits will only increase as you level your farming.
---
* If you're losing money with the above tips, consider planting toadflax (38 farming) or avantoe (50 farming) at the non disease free patches and ranarr at the disease free patches.
---
Toadflax and avantoe are much cheaper to plant, but the herbs are also much cheaper than ranarr. You'll make a more consistent profit and won't lose nearly as much when a patch dies.
---
The earlier you do quests, the better. When you're low level, those xp gains feel even bigger. I'd recommend going to the quest page in the wiki. They have a list sorted by xp rewards. Pick the skills you want to accelerate first, and see which quests you should do. 
---
Of course they remember it was fucking yesterday.
---
Idk mannn I was hunting black chins (I’m lvl 97 combat) with full black dhide +glory, guardians, and a dihns, and this level 67 came up and was wrecking me with the saradomin strike, I was very surprise at how accurate it was. I’m not saying I’m against this change, I enjoy the idea actually, just throwing my 2 cents in
---
&gt;expecting any pvp change to pass a poll
---
keep question. look at the quest xp rewards page on the wiki [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal\_quest\_guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide)
---
i didnt say it was only at 750. 
---
/h
---
Calm down sweaty lunatic.
---
Just camp the tbow spawn
---
How did they let a one month old have access to osrs
---
Sure why not
---
From a development standpoint it really is “just a bug”. It’s a single item spawn. It’s not like a Tbow is a big highlighted object in the code that they’re hounding every second of every day. Agree that it’s probably not the best item to be using for testing due to its market value, but from a coding standpoint it **is** one item amongst thousands. The code itself wouldn’t take GE value into consideration as that value is driven entirely by the players
---
Probably bought it for rs3. Contact jagex support and they will fix it.
---
Honestly, its great you're doing it all in one go, but I would still get some rubbish ones out the way, some only take a few mins so while you run around finishing off other ones or doing more barrows you'll have better gloves that people can't slate you for and they'll be just better than a combat brace after Mithril, plus, if you do Tears of Guthix you'll get more time each quest point so an extra 5 quest points or so would be good while you wait.
---
You're already saving state when you log off. You just have to take a copy of it.
---
If you allow the world to change while backups are happening, you will get very inconsistent state.

Ok

Could always run dragon bones on the house party world.

I don't know a single autist who would do it by hand

You are an idiot and not a single person gives a shit if you quit...
---
18-22k for a developer, I don't think so. 
---
Dumb cunt
---
So I've had the secateurs in my inventory all the way to 80 farm... 
---
Thanks for the detailed tips!
---
Yeha but you could just wear zarosian robes to make ancients more accurate.
---
Still cool tho. Sacrifice stats to specialize for certain spells, rock on.
---
Would also make clue scroll items more valuable, 10/10 idea. Also opens up an area for other god spells like Armadyl.
---
Nice metaphor!
---
well it's not USD, and that's just from what i've heard. I'm not very bright but I think its true
---
Don't give activision-blizzard your money, record earnings = new exec getting $15m bonus + firing &gt;800 employees
---
And there are many good private servers of each xpac depending on what you like
---
what's your magic level?
---
May as well hold on to it. Your account was likely used for botting, but since you recovered it, that probably won't fall on you. Nobody is going to kick up much dust over 2m and a bunch of ores, so I'd just consider it reparations for getting hacked and keep playing.
---
What’s your magic level, Napalm? 
---
This is why most sensible games either have a short downtime period while applying updates or a rolling backup by grid. There is no excuse for two players standing beside each other to not be synced up on a backup.
---
That's just the standard dinh's walk animation.  When walking towards the west side, the bulwark will face the opposite direction.

You're probably looking at that sort of wage for a community manager maybe but other roles a lot higher. 
---
January wasn't any better lol osrs starting it's decline soon tbh
---
I see! I'll probably do a few easy ones today then and see if I can at least get the mithiril gloves. I appreciate the advice! 
---
The combination of high dps spells and tb will be aids, this would be more appropriate for dmm
---
Yeah that's how I would see it.. I tried zulrah for the first time yesterday made it to jad phase and after but I did horrible dps because I'm not used to switching yet.. 
---
So for me brimstone would be the way to go.. Lol 
---
No, they are external customers. What do you mean by "by the time they pass front desk support it should have been confirmed and documented"? Do you mean that the bug should have been already known about before it reaches support? If so I that's the ideal, but in actuality that's never been how it works.
---
This could also be incorporated into the Warding skill!
---
Panic buy zamorak monk robes
---
So it's fair to hold him to different rules?  He went there under the understanding that if he died his stuff would be there on the ground for an hour like the rest of us.  He couldn't have possibly known this would happen.  If we had the original death mechanic he may have chosen to risk less.  That's such a fucking stupid argument and you know it.
---
how many times did you fail at detecting sarcasm before you developed this delusion that *sarcasm* is the problem?
---
Bruh look at all the reddit posts. Jagex accidentally started spawning Twisted Bows outside the farming guild.
---
I doubt the obby cape will be better than fire/inferno capes next week :^)
---
Meet Craftletics, my Minekaramja locked Ultimate Ironman. 
---
One-hour death piles should be considered a gift. Under the original regime, those items would have been gone (or looted by someone else).
---
It's risky to boss close to an update. This is one reason why.
---
Wine if you want to save money
---
how can you not notice lol what did u see then
---
Yeah but they rolled back. I'm wondering if people have no confidence and are panic selling 
---
Our memories were reset with the rollback, no?
---
could always find a private server with inferno but i know thats frowned upon around here
---
Forgetting that no one cares about the base stats of prayer armor because you use it for the prayer bonus, which makes your 100% PvM immunity last a lot longer.
---
Not in favor of this change because you can already safespot 90% of situations that you would use ranged/mags combat in. The other 10% portray the value of melee in PvM.
---
OP is moving side to side like you would on the final boss while pray flicking jad (video on the bottom left side) and clicking to attack while staying behind the shield.
---
Any monster that is bigger than a 1x1 has its "actual" square in the southwest corner. So your chin would be exploding from that specific square. In other words, the tile to the north, northeast and east are wasted because thats all jad himself.
---
This is also very useful knowledge when cannoning. You stand on the northeast corner of your cannon to maximise double hits against 3x3 monsters because their southwest tile aligns with the cannon double hit spots.
---
Hope this helps, best of luck

$23.76k-29.04k  for Americans. In America that is below the median income and means jmods would need govt assistance if they were here. I’ll be collecting tin foil hats here ^.

Thats if theres only 1 tbow. If it keeps spawning, you must be a brainlet or a new player to not know it’s a bug
---
Hell. No.

Except for in the wilderness.

I'll check it out.
---
Rune scim isn't the power of the gods, whose blessing you have to earn and special equipment you have to wear just to wield their power. It's a tier 40 scimitar. And to be fair, it's the best F2P weapon in the game still for overall DPS.
---
pretty sure a r2h was bis but okay
---
i dont really get why these insanely dumb posts about buffing some dumb spell or anything other obscure item "to make it better for pvp" always has dozens of iroman flair people sayin how cool it is, that pvp should get something to be more interesting and how they always wanted to cosplay as a zammy mage.
---
But when pkers ask for extremely basic things like adding permanent UK bh and pvp worlds or atleast moving the US server to east coast so people arent event unable to pk in bh/pvp every 2 weeks they get mass downvoted.
---
I've sacrificed everything, what have you given?!
---
15 years of this kind of abuse, it's basically Stockholm syndrome at this point

Agreed, we need more German servers.

This was very informative. Thank you for the thoughtful reply and providing that insight. Also I'm looking at the spreadsheet and see Gas Tank as the first recorded hack. That guy is a friend of mine, I got hacked about 1 month prior to the to him then and I told him all about it. The guy was even nice enough to offer a 200m lend to get me back on my feet. He had like 14b at the time when I got hacked one month prior to him.

lol when i was really low cmb my friend irl was always higher than me so he'd kinda guide me a bit and convinced me to go for it
---
But simultaneously very elitist.
---
Would tie into Warding too, good idea
---
Lol they just tried to make it more accessible with lower def reqs to help pures a few weeks ago
---
In RS3 lore, Zaros is explicitly stronger than Zam after his return. Its not really a contest, in one quest Zaros nearly straight up murders Zam until he realizes its making Zam into a martyr.
---
In OSRS lore, its not well established. But believing he gained all of Zaros' power doesnt make a lot of sense. For one they had been in a fight, so Zaros must have expended some energy up til that point. Im sure there was some energy lost in the transfer as well. It was undeniable that he got a good chunk of Zaros' power in osrs, as it made him a god. But how much is what's up for debate.
---
That being said, Zaros hasnt been talked about in osrs lore. He could actually be dead. Azzanadra states he cant hear his lord anymore, and there hasnt been much else after that.
---
No quick go get one.
---
Depends on how it would be obtained. If through clues then yea pretty useless. Could just be an occasional extra drop when you get a twisted bow as a drop 
---
It was fun as hell lol, some of the best content they've released in a while

---
While I agree that in an ideal world he should get his stuff back it's fairly likely that Jagex can't even track the stuff he lost. Them just handing stuff out to people without being sure what happened to it isn't a great thing to start doing for pretty obvious reasons. 
---
Seeing as how the people that lost stuff from raids bugs got refunded I'd imagine he'll get his stuff back if they can see what happened to it. 
---
&gt;They'd have less people quitting over getting hacked or scammed if they did.
---
Not sure how better customer support would make people not quit after being hacked.
---

No exact times, but if everyone knows what they're doing, the waves only last a couple of minutes. Later waves take longer just because everything has more health/you have to kill more things.

---
Good thought tbh
---
Which would you prefer 1.Jagex MAYBE rigging the updates after the players do hidden voting, 2. Players who mob vote without thinking and get things passed or failed that would benefit the community, all because the vote count is visible, or 3. No voting at all and just hoping Jagex gets it right?

---
That's just for the name of the style of pking now. Nobody who does it thinks it is NH
---
which obviously makes the point about "glass cannon" that the previous poster made pointless
---
I kinda like it, but I'd also like to have lower tier items that are able to autocast the spells.
---
'RS3' You do know it was released around 2008 right? Nothing wrong with those tools. They seemed balanced back then.
---
Wait until you find out about the guys carrying logs outside of the Fossil Island boat at the Digsite.
---
I went for full graceful before doing agility pyramid on my ironman. You won't want to do it at lvl 40 because you will fail so much. I started at lvl 57 and I thought that was a good time. Also keep your weight as close to 0 as you can. I wore my full graceful and brought cakes and water skins
---
Based on the OSRS Quests and our existing Grandmasters, my predictions would be...
---
* Light Puzzle: They kinda already revealed this one and hinted it is that Crazy Stairs-like image use as a background for Song of the Elves stuff. Either way, some form of Light Puzzle seems like a given.
---
* Agility: Underground Pass had those Bridge Jumps, Regicide had the Forest Traps, and MEP2 had those Handholds... If there isn't a section with one really hard to pass obstacle or a series of obstacles to pass is it really an Elf Quest?
---
* Character Death: Both Grandmasters featured an important character death. But I actually think SotE may avoid falling into that pattern and not kill off any important ally. That said, if they were to it would likely be Arianwyn or Eluned, more likely Eluned for RS3 reasons...
---
But based on where the quests went in RS3, I have some further predictions...
---
* Dark Lord: I was going to put a spoiler tag and reveal who I think it will be, but chances are some of you would click it without having done the RS3 quests... So I'll just say if you know who the Dark Lord was in RS3, it seems very likely to be the same in OSRS. To add to this, I could see the Dark Lord being the big final boss &gt;!like it was in RS3!&lt;.
---
* Clan Leaders: This is smaller RS3 spoiler but in the final quest focused largely around getting representatives from all 8 clans, mainly the leaders or whoever was left, to restore Prifddinas. Personally, I am hoping OSRS will address the Civil War part of it more with Lletya and Iorwerth's armies battling it out rather than sneaking in. But given how out concepts for Prif feature a similar 8 clan layout to RS3 and based on how the Reqs seem to suggest 8 clans too, I expect they'll play a role.
---
* Regicide: One of my favorite parts in Plagues' End was when you &gt;!rallied your Human Allies, overthrew the Mourners, outed King Lathus as a traitor, and sparked an Ardy Civil War between the Knights and Paladins, leading to you storming the Castle with the option to kill King Lathus!&lt;. Now OSRS may not do that exactly, but I really hope there is some resolution to that part of the story instead of just focusing on the Elves.

Can someone tell me who this dude is 😂😂
---
But fire surge exists now. I don't think they need to be better than a 95 requirement spell.

If they added this, I'd also suggest they remove dead HC from normal ironmen hiscores. Which will never happen. 
---
But daddy G put in those edicts. Should have some merit in the wildy too.
---
So painful and true. 
---
I was thinking a similar thing.
---
Zammy is usually the preferred spell so the fact that it's items are only a little less easy to get kinda makes it not matter 
---
It is indeed pretty smart to vote no to stuff that goes against your own interests.
---
PvP updates only happen if they also benefit PvMers.
---
I think that might be difficult to code wouldn't it, it would be a continually varying risk percentage
---
Well the name comes from pre eoc (2010 ish) when if you hibrid pk you werent able to use overhead since it was a pussy / no honor move.

Whoever thought this would be fixable without a rollback is pretty dumb

Messing with noobs and bots just never gets old.

Dont talk shit about giant mole!
---
And they should get their items back.
---
I'd argue that people who got items/pets the period between Jagex confirming there would be no rollback and then changing their minds should as well.
---
This guy and anyone in situations like his where they lost items THEY ALREADY HAD prior to the rollback due to the timing of the rollback should definitely be a tier above and get their stuff back. 
---
They literally lost items they worked hard for due to a Jagex mistake.
---
lol'd 
---
can gain xp while working on this :)
---
I've been thinking of an overhaul to high prayer levels with God devotion to buff certain prayers and spells by aligning your self to a chosen god this would fit in rather nicely with that
---
Lmao imagine comparing real life currency to pixels in a game where it is explicitly stated that there is no monetary value attached to anything. 
---
And I at least found MA2 relatively fun and adventurous.
---
Support.
---
No I wouldn't because I'm a grown fucking adult and I've got enough perspective on life to know that none of this shit matters. I've got kids, a mortgage, a great job, and a good outlook on life. 
---
If I lost all my stuff on this game I would sit back, let out a quick "aw shucks", and move the fuck on.

Did you even read the commenters to you’re original comment?

My agility level wouldn’t change

I doubt it was anything serious. If you understand how fucking old this game is and how many different ancient scripts are running together its amazing how bug and crash free this game is. There is an undocumented small fishing net spawn that appeared in morytania a few weeks back. Unintended behavior is a fact of programming life. Hell the most basic cin buffer in c++ has one of the largest cases of unintended behavior ever known to man and it is used by millions of people and programs.

Hey! Looks like on the crafting sheet your formulas don't extend entirely in the xp to columns. Also, thanks a lot for making this and updating it and sharing it with us, you've put a lot of effort into it and I appreciate it :}
---
dumb fuck. its easy to get bonds replaced if you just take half a minute to send a ticket... youre complaining about the wrong thing and sound stupid
---
Or you could do what people have been doing lately spamming at ge to buy them p2p

damn

wait is that how time zones work? FUCK REVOLUTIONARY

10 euros per week? Look at mr rich guy over here
---
Lake is iron and hes 4k kc  so its not that updated
---
I did it on a whim the other day and won 10 in a row. Just small like 150-200k bets, but legit 10 in a row. People watching started accusing me of being a part of it so I just logged. Wish I had done 50m bets 
---
I also learned somewhat recently that the tool leprechaun will turn your produce into notes if you use them on him, so that saves time on banking especially on hops where you get like 20 per harvest.  
---
I was used to seeing people drop stuff all the time so I had no idea.
---
i know right? i could but all sorts of different trash! oh what i wasted money on back then. 
---
Like that Ironman who lost items because he was rolled back to when they were on the floor in Sara room or the guy in Roidie's CC that lost Zulrah pet.
---
BIG UPS LIQUID RICHARD

Your post shows your ignorance in one line, " Due to how the save archives of each account works on servers across the globe". I read that as 'I am a complete ignoramus and have no idea how this shit works so fuck ima throw some words up that sound like what I want to say kek'. If I really need to explain why this statement is so bad there's no saving you.
---
It’s a comment thread you fucking tool
---
When I read what he wrote, I just assumed the current tier arms in each category. Which doesn't even make much sense considering what numbers he used lmfao but I understand what you're getting at 
---
Yeah that would be worth a bond each time
---
rip lahey
---

---
I know why people use it—doesn’t make them sound any less dumb. I suggest you forget it from your lexicon. 
---
I don't blame him for quitting tbh.
---
And my comment is just a comment, no need to be so butt hurt.
---
Thats why you do it when update happens and there is a downtime. This is normal to any other game that shuts its servers down.
---
Know the guy, hes completely lost the plot.
---
Can we delete this guys reddit account? He seems to think he's entitled to anything because he has a keyboard.
---
 No, this is one that actually has a brain. What makes the rollback loss so painful is that I was unknowingly a part of losing a mates tbow through no fault of my own. I know the pain of losing my bank and am gutted for the guy.
---
Imagine being so casual that you don't wake up early on Thursdays with a big ass pot of coffee and multiple boxes of chips ahoy
---
A snide response is not a courtesy to anyone. 
---
I want him to reply with this level of care, or not at all. Simple. 
---
So I don't know exactly how it works but Ash mentioned that some people duped/lost items. Obviously only the people who lost items have come forward.  
---
From what I've seen it works like this(T bow is an example, could have been bills in cash/items) - 
---
Account A has a T bow, account A trades their T bow to account B, account B loggs off(Saving their rollback point with the T bow), account B quickly loggs back in, gives his T bow to account A then account A loggs off(saving their rollback point with the T bow). Given the time is so close to each other there is no reason both logout points wouldn't be the roll back point? Both would still have the T bow. Both accounts stay logged on until the rollback. 
---
Very possibly some J Mods knew this is how it works too and big time exploited it? I could be very wrong but does it note make sense? Very open to being wrong so please correct me if I am or if I've made an obviously mistake on how it works.
---
This right here. There's literally no way to interpret if he even was being snarky or not in that. It's fucking text for god sake. People are seriously reaching here

Do NMZ bosses receive increased defensive stats on hard mode? Most guides and sources say that before 80 attack I should be using normal style bosses for xp, but according to the wiki defensive stats are unaffected by hard mode. If this is the case, shouldn't I put it on hard mode to get the most hits in on each monster? 60 attack 69 strength for those wondering. Thanks.
---
Wait, are you saying the fishing net spawn was completely unintentionally? Wasn’t there another Morytania only that asked for a net spawn?
---
Doubt, there's no reason to even put anything there. The only thing that can happen due to this is the economy getting fucked because someone found out how to no clip in there and abused it for months before being caught.
---
Ive always thought this too. 
---
It's always kind of bothered me that the absolute best thieves in RuneScape only ever shoplift from open air stalls and pickpocket people. 
---
Who the fuck is trolling? And what makes your point “reason” and my point unreasonable? Get off your fuckin high horse. 
---
So I should be buying out all god gear?
---
They have a lot less players dude.  Just because they're worth less doesn't mean they can't provide good customer service, they just have to hire less people.
---
Yea but, look at all the upvotes you'd get... [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/avsgll/the\_roll\_back\_caused\_my\_ironman\_to\_lose/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/avsgll/the_roll_back_caused_my_ironman_to_lose/)
---
Yes but hundreds of innocent players who did nothing wrong lost hours weeks months of hard work due to the way the rollback works. It leaves a bad taste of collateral damage.
---
No I dont if you read back I just said I could give a shit less about jagex and the game. It would be fucking retarded of me to buy gold with my stats I've been playing this game most likely longer than you've been alive but having 2 kids and working hard for my irl money everyday if my kids bought gold on this game and jagex just decided to take it cause of a fuck up they made I'd be kicking someone's ass. Where jagex fucked up is charging irl money for their in game shit and I'm tired of seeing bullies like you and the one I was commenting to bully these kids because you didnt lose anything and they did. Reddit is a place for help when you have no where to go to get answers. Its not for assholes like you and the previous guy to just get a laugh. 
---
right click and uncharge it.
---
Very very few people lost more than 2 hrs of work. The only one I've seen is the Ironman at gwd on the front page
---
Players have an interacting property, so it just checks that for every player in the scene. If anyone is interacting with them, TP. This should also work with trading and following. 
---
It does surprise me that people think a few terabytes of texts is too much for a company to handle
---
You're free to provide proof that backs you up.

Nah 1m in risk
---
Was there a calander for 2018? If so can someone link it i cant find it
---
That hair tho
---
To be fair, with how fast the bots type and how legit they all make it seem it isn't unreasonable to think some noobs might think it *is* part of the game, and not player ran. 
---
I see A Friend content, I downvote
---
jagex wouldn't want to set any precedents they will never follow through with
---
Haha Tbh it took me back to those days when people told you stuff, and you believed everything. Except that this time it wasn't in the wildy.
---

After hearing about everyone crying about this quest i followed a guide (cant remember who by) but b0aty said its the best guide hes ever seen and the quest ended up being quite pleasant because of the quality of the guide.
---
Tl;dr dont know what everyone was bitching about.
---
Different accounts have different .dat files on the server.
---
Whenever they logout, the .dat file is saved (creating the restore point).
---
When they do a rollback, they revert all .dat files back to their latest state that is also *before* the incident.
---
If the 2 accounts logged out at different times then they have different restore points.
---
Log out both accounts at the same time and the restore points will match (or be close enough to match).
---
And you can always create a new restore point for your account by logging out and logging back in, **not a world hop** but a full logout (just to be sure).
---
We unnote at banks. Not really op imo for leprchauns just saves us the trouble of running to a bank quickly
---
I'm saying that there was no documentation for it whatsoever, it just appeared.
---
I think that’s the big takeaway here.
---
Really makes you wonder what’s going on behind the scenes.... like, is there a QA team beyond the devs coding these updates/changes to the game? Did there used to be one, because these issues didn’t used to be a monthly occurrence to the point we can literally make a monthly calendar for it...? 
---
Should there definitely be one now?
---
When the issues/bugs introduced to the game are this frequent, it would honestly shock me if a company in 2019 is playing it this fast and loosely with updates. We need to raise the bar for quality updates here, whether it means taking some more time to flesh out updates with the current team, or we straight up need more devs back there. 
---
Jagex has their work cut out for them, because this particular incident was quite the doozy and for some players, it was nothing short of a catastrophe. So many items lost to the rollback, or accounts wrongly banned... what a mess. 
---
God forbid next week’s update comes with more fun like this.
---
Looking for friends usually winds up badly, you just gotta do you and eventually they come. Forcing friends to spawn has a very low success rate.
---
Hey, I know this is old, but could you please elaborate on this. I'm stuck and also can get the client to fully loaded.
---
You should have a rune defender in your bank from when you got a d defender.
---
It shouldn't be? 
---
I said I am not sure I understand either. The guy I replied to had an explanation. I am not sure I agree with it but I don't pk so whatever.
---
Yeah
---
I think I just came
---
Yeah it's a little scuffed but it works
---
Expected an oh fuck... This subreddit spoiled me.
---
Thanks and should I focus on magic or attack&amp;strength first? 
---
I believe so dragon defender is spawned in a place of its own that only droid d defender
---
&gt;Lol, like I said, they have less money because they have less customers.
---
That's not what you said, this is what you said: "They have a lot less players dude, they'd only have to hire a fraction of CS people Blizzard has. "
---
&gt;Of course they get upset on slow responses.
---
Slow responses were your idea, see here: " Even if it takes them 10 days to get to you"
---
&gt;If they could rest easy knowing everything would be returned and restored
---
OSRS's stance on this is known and won't change
---
&gt;You don't seem to use your brain very much dude.
---
I've responded to each portion of each of your comments. Your resulting ad-hom shows that you can't represent your argument.
---
Have a great day 'using your brain'.
---
I disagree, this sub would be trash without them
---
You're assuming that literally everyone knows a bug is actively happening as soon as it happens, and I don't think that's a fair assumption at all.
---
I would honestly sell the suffering  and get a trident of the swamp. Tormented should be the second upgrade.  Swap out that useless void for blessed d hide and take advantage of your barrows gloves.  Trident of the seas isn’t very efficient, but you could get lucky and get the fang. Regardless, Zulrah will Buy you the upgrades quickly if you grind it out

---
I hope you are joking
---
I always though trim/untrim was an option before I got my 2nd 99. Its automatic.
---
melee armor on chest and legs is about defence though, using prossy gives massive prayer bonus and you lose little offensive value compared to praying when using range.
---
Umm, see this is where your wrong. Tyrone stored the key in YOUR asshole, you ain't top bunk Jed, not today.
---
Not yet
---
Picking up an item isn't abusing a bug. I don't think you understand what a bug is. This wasn't a bug. This was something that was meant to be removed before an update was pushed but they forgot. That's their fault. Remove the membership from the accounts that bought it but that is it. You can't take action against players for a mistake they made.
---
This is what I came for
---
Should get bonus % chance towards tbow dependent on total level.  Not a lot, very minuscule to make sure lower levels don’t get super lucky.  Would also need to become 2x or more rare and time consuming then acquiring it the normal way.  So the chance has to be small as fuck but would be quite funny maybe make it degradable and once it hits 0 it disappears from inventory so its not staying in the game for long and isn’t tradable.  
---
In b4 someone tells me to STFU and go and eat a big mac
---
My recommendation is to quest like no tomorrow! Get farming up ASAP. It’s easy money every 60-70 minutes but start with toadflax seeds. You can skip a lot of early level grinding through quests as well. 
---
Some good farming quest are: 
---
Ghost ahoy 
---
Client of Kourend (get hosidious favor)
---
Fairy tale part 1 
---
Garden of tranquility 
---
I would also get agility up ASAP as well graceful helps with questing and it’s pretty great for a skilling outfit. 
---

1/256 and untradeable. Not sure what you teled out for but it's cool. I got 4 in 100 kills :(.

Also close to a charter ship, bank chest, and a spirit tree come to think of it. It's fuckin great for an easy diary.

I played Durning the roll pack period and went to sleep before even hearing about it. Woke up and it was rolled back. Only lost about 2 slayer task worth if xp and points but I would have never known to not play. I didn't even know there was an active bug that could need a toll back. Not everyone is checking Reddit every 10 minutes 
---
Gotta go fast 
---
What about Gandalf the white ?
---
I don't feel like explaining this in a public forum, just to have the community influence the situation.

All I want is to speak with a Jagex employee that can/could remedy this situation.

It takes 40 mins tops

What a legend
---
studded leather range bonus with prossy prayer bonus would be great when using protection prayers but would feel op if you were safespotting using the OP vigour prayer since you wouldn't get the armor downside of fuck all defensive value
---
That’s cute.. you think you can petition to remove people from a game you play. 
---
I just buy tabs lol
---
Maybe if Jagex would add some legit gambling tables to the Games Room we wouldnt have to gamble with bots.
---
Not just that, but the gold sink would be immense.

Well that's two osrs artists that clearly have a for fetish. 
---
i tried facing them to test the triggers, but it's hard to do w/out moving. I assume its something to do with ID when clicking. Some bots have a threshhold of like 3-5 clicks then run.
---
According to Ash, different accounts were rolled back to different times that were close together (not sure why this is). So for instance, one individual (claims to have) traded 200m from his alt to his main and the main was rolled back to before he accepted the trade (and therefore did not have the cash) and his alt was rolled back to after it accepted the trade (and therefore also did not have the cash) so the money is seemingly gone.

I'm 25, nice try guy. Also if you don't care about Jagex and their trash game. One, why did you have Billions? Two, why you mad bro?
---
Probability of multiple events all happening is the product (multiplying) all of the individual probabilities. 
---
So for a 3 step clue you need to complete step 1 (77% chance) step 2 (77%) step 3 (77%), so multiply 0.77*0.77*0.77 = 0.456=45.6% chance for a 3 step. Its the same idea for 4, 5 step ones.

If you sold the tbows from the spawn and bought bonds with obviously dirty gp, then your account is gone. Put more detail in your post or just expect it to be overlooked.

---
 But they could do that anyway. 
---
it's not that bad. it's slightly annoying when the shadows attack you and close interfaces but you can get them stuck behind pillars or just kill them since they only have 15 hp and really low defence.  
---
there's only one obstacle that depends agility and it doesn't fail at 91. with 83 you'll be fine, I did it at 71 without summer pies and only failed a handful of times, and you only need to get past that obstacle like twice. just bring plenty of stamina potions (especially if you're in proselyte) and a few prayer pots since the shadows do hit quite accurately.  
---
I think prayer boosting gear and more staminas is better than using graceful with more prayer potions since staminas are cheaper and you'll be running most of the time, but it's not going to break the bank either way.  
---
only reason I was getting frustrated because I was doing it while I was tired and getting directions mixed up, wondering why the puzzle wasn't working. otherwise it should be easy, just a bit time consuming.

---
I’m kinda lost. In my understanding, they took down the game twice. First for the weekly game update as scheduled. Second as a result of the bug in the update and the need to roll back. I’m saying that it seems obvious to me that jagex should make a full backup while the servers are offline for the game update each week, since rollbacks are most likely to be needed after a botched update, and more importantly because with nobody logged in at the time, nobody can be negatively affected by rolling back to that backup (except for lost progress). So I guess I disagree with your point on the grounds that a better rollback system could and should exist.
---
Thanks for the feedback, WeFightForever. I'll take everything into consideration. :)

One advantage of using god spells is that you can be brewed down and still 1 tick a mage attack.

To Morytania, so Settled can do Barrows more efficiently.

I mean, when your fuck up cost a customer potentially hundreds of hours their life, you really should be taking the high ground, even if it's just an empathic response to a rude customer.

God spells not worth at barrows (2 blood runes is too much per cast).

Void is good at barrows rn too anyway.

Hey now people can't complain they got 2/3 less days because they bought membership in February.

Yea it's just that not everyone is constantly up to date with what happens. 
---
It was also my first 3rd age piece as well, 10 clue count :)
---
This kid is on my friends list! Lol
---
They grow up so fast these days 
---
Quality suggestion 
---
You also need to sacrifice said fire cape for the Inferno track (no, you don't even have to clear any waves for those curious).
---
So you'll probably want 2, 1 as a spare.
---
Yes it should be. But I switched between void and elite void equipment and the calculator did not show a difference, and then I looked through the source code and did not find the elite Void modifier anywhere.
---
Didn't investigate it super thoroughly, so it's possible I missed something.
---
Cool but short
---
Hehe ty thought somebody might get bated huehuehue

Zulrah you should have at least 75 range/mage, vorkath at least 75 range.

I actually just read the post this morning about the ironman who lost a bunch of shit for jagex's incompetence and i wanted to get in on the bitching. Didn't realize mistakes only had a 24 hour life before we forget that this company is shitty and just move on like nothing happened.
---
You’re so fucking dense. YOU CANT MAKE IT HIS JOB JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO COMPLAIN TO SOMEONE. There are plenty of community engagement people from Jagex on Twitter, it’s not my fault you are a fucking moron and don’t look for them. Fucking google search community managers. They are better equipped to handle community issues. 
---
Ash is not Jagex. If his company fucks something up, the onus is not on HIM to make your problems right.
---
Just legit have it be underground?
---
There was another project to build varrock and lumbridge we are Minecraft. Maybe you should check with them and ask if you can borrow the world and combine your world with theirs?

I think someone above proposed the void mace but I don't think it would be good to have the other two be buyable and the mace from a minigame

Double checked, and it's not. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Other games aren't built on years old garbage spaghetti code in runescript. 
---
Yeah I’m pretty pissed off about it but there are definitely people worse off from it than me.
---
I think those reveling in other people’s misfortune are envious or devout fanboys that refuse to criticize the almighty devs.
---
All I got when I complained about it was a link to the bug that I already knew about and a bunch of people either saying that I’m bullshitting or telling me to get over it. The toxicity of this community is next level. It’s just pure Schadenfreude.
---
Thanks for actually caring, I appreciate it
---
Why not? They are cool soells and this could make them mkre popular for both PvP and pvm. Cheaper for some players and its a lower requirement.  
---
Tangleroot is the pet that I really want. And since I really want it I probably won’t get it until after 99. 
---
A) I lost a spectral. B) I would 100% choose a rollback that affects people minimally. C) Of course they have a lot of work to do sorting out any illicit activities that happened during the couple of hours of the broken update. Doesn't mean they shouldn't also help players affected by this who did nothing wrong. They still haven't fixed last weeks cockup so they are going to be rather busy but they have the responsibility to the players punished for nothing.

 Still awaiting a knowledgeable explanation off you btw.

&gt; @petterrs96 As players' saved games are distributed across multiple servers, since there are so many of them across the world, they don't all have the exact same archive points. Thus different players get slightly different results.

nordic countries should have their own servers (german servers are not enough) having server either in sweden or finland would be good

If only that was the case. If the trade had been the other way it would have been duplicated. Mod Ash has stated multiple times yesterday on twitter that its entirely possible for this to happen and it sadley happened to me and a few others this time. Be thankful it wasn't you.

Of course they have test servers. But they also have nearly two decades worth of legacy code developed using proprietary tools that no one else uses. It's impossible to review everything that could potentially break in an update.
---
Thank you for the addition. Forgot about the safespotting. Its basically dmm pking lol
---
1. They're knights, doesn't really make sense lore wise
---
2. Ranged and Mage already have prayer boosting gear (blessed dhides and vestments) so meh
---
Yes but if the handle was shorter the blade could be longer
---
should i pick the crystal shield or bow when i complete roving elves? does it matter?
---
I'm at 77 hp and I bring 4 karambwans with me. I bank every single kill though.
---
Yeah check out dmm
---
Haha I'd prefer to do certain high level bosses early for content access which safespotting is great for.
---
Not everyone wants to spend 200 hours grinding a couple stats so that they can face plant the tough bosses.
---
Oh misread that. For that he needs to tweet mod lottie. She does these analytics

Emergency protocol: rollback.
---
Can I be friends with y’all, wtf
---
&gt; I would honestly sell the suffering and get a trident of the swamp.
---
Unfortunately the suffering is imbued and I cba to sell and reimbue it, but swamp will be my first upgrade.
---
 &gt;  Swap out that useless void for blessed d hide...
---
I always heard that void was BIS until Armadyl for high 90s range. 
---
Sempre tem um retardado metido a bonzão...

450+ 
---
The rng gods giveth, but they also do not giveth.
---
83 construction is definitely on my list (68 now), isn't Karil's worse than void for high 90s range?
---
Be nice to know one way or another. All I am getting is "we cannot return items due to technical reasons" yet it has happened before now.
---
I had to insult him somehow.. 
---
If you’re above 75 (I think?) combat, you can use konar for slayer tasks and make ok money from brimstone keys while getting combat and slayer up.
---
This seems legit

It was a apathetic at best, and rude at worst. 
---
Imo, when your fuck up cost someone potentially hundreds of hours of their life, you should give an apology at the very least, if not actually attempt to fix the situation.
---
Bow is basically useless everywhere, shield is bis range def (besides bulwark ofc). Probs take the shield, it still isn't particularly good but serves as sort of a budget dfs in some cases 
---
Fucking yikes dude
---
“Rollback, but, like, not completely rolled back. Or something.” - you
---
Isn’t abyssal dagger better str training than Sara sword if you have dragon defender?
---
Dust/laws/natures in pouch. Then if you need to high alch, bring tome of fire or stack of lavas/fires.
---
Gosh, that's a bit weird. Thanks for the info. I stand corrected. 
---
$11 btw..
---
Because forging these kind of things sure is hard!
---
It’s from settled new UIM series.
---
Cant argue that. Just saying short was a bit vague so i was confused 😆
---
TRUE ntellectuals sold the GP and bought membership with BiTcOiN
---
I was schleep tho.
---
I'm not talking about just the twisted bows. i'm talking about the weekly hotfixes that come right after the updates because they don't do enough quality assurance. 
---
Add it to the bog  event
---
It looks like what happens when you use opengl on multiple threads.
---
Why did abyssal daggers crash? I bought one for 7.5 mil while it was low, which was nice. Just curious.
---
Doesn't even state the issue...
---
I would also 100% not bother without arclight and blowpipe. 
---
they could even have player mods that check shit out on a test server before making it live. or maybe not do updates every single week and give yourself more time to not fuck it up. 
---
These rwt websites are more professional than you think
---
yeah he did lmao he edit out like a little bitch
---
Yeah, but it is cool, like i'm not saying it looks bad but some adjustments would make it cooler
---
BRB investing 2B into Ancient vestment robes 
---
Criticism is welcomed
---
Aim for short term goals, like all easy achievement diaries (which knock out several quests and set you up with some beginner skills.)
---
If you need REALLY short term goals (money), you can try a myriad of "skill less" money making like buying/selling from shops, looting at slayer areas or PvP areas (make sure you bank all your items if you do this).
---
Probably somewhere off in the corner of the Fisher king realm.
---
Why would anybody use it at Corp? By the time you’re stabbing it Corp is literally a zero defence potato so accuracy makes no difference and fire Cape is better.
---
It takes a brisk walk over to your POH
---
Yeah, I mean it isn't the exact same situation but I basically got rolled back to before I lent the gear off my mate and he got rolled back to after he lent me the gear. Hopefully they can fix this so noone else goes through the same thing.
---
What does it say if you search it?
---
150-160ms is actually the best ping world (467 1750 total) according to runelite, its usually 180-200ms plus in most american worlds, European worlds are 250ms plus.
---
Would be good for you, I guess it doesn't make business sense though or they'd of done it already? 
---
I was in FOE (big pure clan), and getting caught teleporting from a fight would get you kicked out instantly. And I’m pretty sure most clans (or at least pure clans) had a similar rule.
---
I have one as I'm primarily power-slaying at the moment. I use it on 80% of my tasks. I only need to bring like 10 pieces of food on most tasks. Some I end up not eating at all, but that might just be cuz I'm piety slaying too. It's very much worth it to me. 
---
Back in November when I first started again after a 12 year hiatus I def fell for this. Lost all my tutorial island stuff lol
---
This is written like a 5th grader trying to fit a bunch of long words in without really understanding their meaning or usage (apologies if English is not your 1st language).

Ya it would also feel weird going the void Mace 15% spell damage bonus
---
it’s in bad faith to compare hourlies with the salaried positions

lmao

Good guy gold sellers. Tbf that’s their livelihood and any reputable seller isn’t going to fuck over their successful business to make a few bucks. It’s definitely in their best interest to re-deliver the rolled back gold

Underrated comment
---
Little more context? 
---
Hey, I might actually play DMM. Time for some war profiteering.
---
no compensation for the rollback? &gt;.&gt; i lost a bunch of levels =\[
---
The bow is needed for a western province hard diary task, but I'm not sure how much people use it other than for that. 
---
I got kbd pet on 44 kc
---
i agree, its been awhile now. why cant they just put a seperate list on the homepage so people can track it? 
---
Don't shoot the messen...oh, too late I suppose.
---
If your stats are halfway decent, you should be able to tank them just fine. I had like 70 defense for my first Jad kill and I had no issue with that. 
---
Tanking is the simplest method, so unless you just really can't survive their hits I'd say that's definitely the way the go. The last thing you need is to give yourself more things to focus on
---
Just remember to only do 1 thing between each prayer switch, that's the tip that will save your life. So like, sip your potion, switch your prayer, and then click on Jad to start attacking again. If you try to squeeze an extra action you're just going to get yourself instakilled
---
Shut
---
I enjoyed the whole ride tbh. Fantastic and iconic quest.
---
When need rs4 to tank the next wave of mtx. I'd say we're going on round 10 of mtx zombies.
---
Lynx after getting permanent #1 rank
---
I wonder if anyone has realized they can use the dev tools in runelite to put any price they want there. It's basically inspect element but for runescape
---
They won't return items because literally any shitter on reddit can claim they lost a tbow. Like me! I lent my friend my tbow and now it's gone, where is my tbow jamflex?? And my scythe!!

Nobody 'lost' anything with the rollback. 
---
RWT all the gold ingame, buy the company, rollback the servers.
---
Even cartoon feet are fuckin gross 
---
??????
---
As OP learned the hard way, they either save state while you're playing or he didn't mention that he logged off during the item recovery.  If it's the latter, then that logoff was his most recent when they did the backup.
---
Alright reddit let’s put our money together and purchase Jagex. Keep it away from the Chinese where you get banned for saying Winnie the Pooh
---
in asia here we get 200+ ping.. so yeah that be great it there was one for the asian server
---
Thing is 90% of people use zammy flames due to its effect. So the zammy robes would go up and others would become viable alternatives
---
5,8k no pet
---
Just got 90 herb today. I did prayer pots until I unlocked super restores and did those to 90. You could try doing Bastions as well but I heard from a guildmate that the unf potions take a while to buy on the ge. 
---
90 herb is definitely great to have if you are planning on seriously doing Cox. The regular overloads don't give as much points as the overloads+, and points give better chances for loot. You don't always get muta/Tek for their overload drops either. 
---
Thats just good ole supply and command XD
---
Wow.. I’ve been walking around with enchanted gem all this time and the fucking slayer helm has one in it. Duhhhh. Yeah this picture is so me 
---
on the quest: merlin's crystal, i have to have the ability to defeat a level 39 enemy, how do i know if can do that?
---
&gt;I believe Blizzard restores destroyed items and and returns stolen items from the person that stole them.
---
WoW is much different to RS though. Pretty much anything that anyone would care about losing in WoW is untradeable so there's not really any repercussions for giving the items back.
---
&gt;You just take people's stolen gold back from the account that it was traded to.
---
It's often not going to be that simple, though. Especially if people know that's what Jagex is doing. 
---
Jagex aren't going to be able to respond to everything instantly. In most cases the gp/items are going to be long gone and integrated back into innocent players accounts. So they either start pulling items/gp from totally innocent peoples accounts to return it or spend massive amounts of time undoing potentially hundreds of trades for every hacked account which could end up negatively affecting innocent players. 
---
For what it's worth, Jagex did actually try an item return policy quite a while ago. It didn't work out very well.
---
Is it always most powerful? 66 range with cbow I go slower than with d scim and 61 str
---
Imo it’s good, with mobile being out I see more people going zulrah and fewer people going sara
---
Yes, people did. Jagex even admitted that their way of backing up is flawed. People have lost items that they had *before* the update ever released.
---
Pretty sure, but sara sword is only 1.5m, compared to the 7-8m of the dagger. I’m a poor boy lol.
---
Having more testers or time doesn't help if you don't know what you're looking for. Why would the testers randomly walk around the map looking for accidental item spawns? Of course it's easy to find a twisted bow on the ground if you know it's there, but no one even thought of the possibility before yesterday.
---
I’ll call the waaaah-mbulance.
---
 H
---
Yeah I don't really have a problem with them not instantly shutting down the worlds and rolling back while they explored their options but there really should have been a global message warning players. 
---
That's a fair way to look at it too tbh
---
This is correct
---
Ya I can tank the hits and waste pots and food or I can take 1 step to the side and kill the NPC safely. Here's what the NPCs are actually thinking: "Oh no! If it weren't for this pebble in the way, I would be able to 1 shot this level 3."
---
this is really important to think about, how the good armor ladder lines up with the new God spell ladder
---
Seen a lot of bits of this podcast can’t wait to get home and actually watch it lol
---
just think, you have to go through that darkness to get to shiny prif
---
It’s not property, you don’t own it. You’re essentially leasing your account from Jagex. 
---
But please, I’d love to see you try to sue over this. Keep me informed on your legal battle, please. 
---
Exactly lol. "Oh look at all this illegitimate money I made when the economy was in shambles"
---
Also 30m isnt shit, you could have made way more with a fuck up this colossal. 
---
They won't. It's "too much work" to be able to sift through all the people this happened to.
---
A few might get lucky and get up voted posts here to force Jagex' hand, but most won't.
---
Ty
---
Ruined? Who are you referring to?
---
Didn't they say they wanted to nerf magic defence? Removing Karil's top might be a good start
---
Range is the most useful in my opinion 
---
He's the best. He always replies on Twitter
---
AND he created Coil so he's the MVP
---
Is Justiciar/Lance really necessary for rune drags? Or could I use Zammy Hasta and some barrows gear and get away with it?
---
Ur just mad a hc has a better account than you lol 
---
Man, imagine going back now with all the knowledge. Would be pretty funny. Like that time some guy laughed at me for using mage in melee gear at barrows. He was kitted out like he just logged in from 2008.
---
Slim to none of. Especially if you are there to manually click every now and then. 
---
Bring back Darkscape!
---
I mean technically he's right 
---
personally responding to 800+ tweets isn't just taking a break my dude.
---
Witches house gives lots of hp xp and can be safespoted with range or mage
---
Just recently started playing again. I literally have not played since 2007 before they moved to RS3. I have no desire to play RS3 but when I signed into Old School Runescape a few weeks ago it made me create a character even though I used correct login information and did not have to re-register. Additionally, my name is a weird combination of letters dashes and numbers now instead of my original character name "Snicklesnorf" 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but they never made you pay to display your actual username before did they? I am kind of mad it now wants me to pay money just to change my name. So a few questions here:
---
Why was all my progress reset? Can I recover my progress somehow.
---
Can I somehow get around paying to change my name and if not what is the cheapest way to change it?
---
If I change it with a one time purchase of a month of premium or some other way is it permanent or does it revert once the subscription ends?
---
Many thanks for all of your help!
---
What are the mechanics behind what you do and do not keep on death outside the wilderness? I've read the wiki and while helpful is still slightly confusing. I've also noticed that the in-game kept-items UI doesn't match what you'll actually keep.
---
Obviously, you keep your 3 most expensive items, 4 with the prayer, but then it goes on to say that you keep all untradables aside from some exceptions. Does this mean that you keep the 3 most expensive items and then you also keep any remaining untradables after those 3? The wiki also mentions that you will always lose your pets no matter what, but I previously saw people mentioning that picking up the pet and dropping your other items to force it as one of the 3/4 items will allow you to keep it, so which is it, do you keep it or not (obviously a pet following you is not an item you keep on death)?
---
This is certainly something I can test myself in-game, but I'd rather not tempt fate. I'm also aware that some items will be damaged upon death and need to be repaired.
---
Unfortunately the player base in major Asian countries is too small for jagex to justify spending time/resources on setting up servers there.
---
Ha! Nice try Venezuelas you'll just have to slay dragons with lag.
---
He mad cuz jagex robbed him: [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aw7ufa/jagex\_sells\_gp\_for\_2\_usd1m\_bond\_34m\_7\_usd\_them/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aw7ufa/jagex_sells_gp_for_2_usd1m_bond_34m_7_usd_them/)
---
its bad that I can say its very accurate just from memory 
---
By the same logic Netflix would be allowed to randomly shutdown your account and Jagex would be allowed to randomly - without reason - cancel your paid for membership. Yes, that's very much illegal and not what that clause is meant for.
---
Sure smells in here. You need to use some deodorant after P.E. class.
---
That's a leaf mate
---
Laughin so Hard jesus ahajahahahahahaaa 
---
I think the barrows gloves are a bit unnecessary for an alt, I have one and I always think of time invested into it as time lost on my main.
---
Your plan does seem pretty solid, when I was leveling mine I put it in NMZ far too early with 43 prayer and about 50 melee stats. Be prepared to get really bored with leveling slayer :D
---
Nice try Jed 
---
I’d hide it in some general store or random shop like the one in gnome village. 3rd party clients would find it anywhere on the ground. 
---
I somehow got to do it again when I just done it a few days ago, not complaining.
---
Also Jagex donates x amount of money per mil to charity.
---
There's dozens of people like you, but are in on the scam. Every single world I see a dicing bot, there's another guy going "no way guys it works. Give him 150k and you'll win!"
---
Depends on distance/hops to server and how good they are tbh. For league i get a constant 27ms and osrs i get 100-170 on american worlds. 
---
It was to combat rwt sites. There was enough time for people to sell the bows and rwt them for lodz of emone before the rollback, resulting in rwt sites losing that money 
---
Why not just get an Android and use the app?
---
You got some solid friends. 
---
If I try to go buy gas for my car and tell the clerk I have 500m in RSG I don't think I'll be getting much gas. 
---
You can't possibly be equating world economics to in game RS gp economics. That is a straw man.
---
He's definitely being a bit of an ass and it seems really unwarranted of him, but let's not overlook that your total is only close because of the ever-so-prestigious 99 firemaking.
---
You're assuming the bot is telling the truth about people winning 20m lmfao
---
&gt;een in and out of rs for 13 years now and is still dont know what ping is
---
It is the response time the game offers for every action you make in the game.  
---
e.g. after you tell your character to walk, it waits a little while before start walking, thats your lag, if it waits just a little while your ping is low, and if you have to wait almost half a second for everything, thats a high ping
---
There the one chunk at a time guy. Hopefully he keeps going.
---
No they don't
---
Let's do some math:. 
---
Say there are 300 RuneScape worlds.
---
And let's say there are 1000 people in every single one of these worlds. (300000 ppl)
---
And let's say each person is sending one message per minute of 1000 letters.
---
60 minutes in an hour * 24 hours = 1440 messages a day per person.
---
1440 * 1000 = 1440000 bytes per person per day
---
1440000 * 300000 = 432,000,000,000 bytes per day
---
That is 432 gigs. Half a terabyte. 
---
And I don't even think the RuneScape player base is even half of that size let alone talking that much.
---
The Great One Approves 
---
The last one I did was 5m and it traded me the 10m just as fast as 150k, but I’d never do it again. It’s like playing dick where you win with 4+ but it only goes up to 4 not 6
---
Nobody cares if you win, you still tried and that's what makes you a retard. 
---
In 300+ kills my friends and i got 2 boots and 11 shards lol
---
It hasn't been for nothing. Not to get sappy, but your friendship should be worth more to him than his TBow was. I have several RS friends that have become long time IRL friends. That's what RS has given me that I value the most. Not what is IN the game. 
---
That’s true. I was mostly just thinking about the novelty of it. Can’t imagine people trying to do it seriously when you could just stake
---
A long long time ago I bought an sgs thinking it was an investment and I’d sell it if I didn’t like it. It ended up being one of the best purchases ever and I’ve had it since. That’s all I’m sayin. 
---
If you're a member you get one free name change a month. You can also burn a bond to change it more frequently.
---
Progress was reset for everyone when they made the new instance of the game.
---
Found a dicer alt
---
It was tested but because it was so far away from hespori, what was being tested, it went unnoticed. Its not logical to check every tile in the game every update
---
Or they could do what other mmorpg's do and have downtime during scheduled maintenance.  
---
That way they have time to sync everything before an update is live.
---
Mod ashe hooked him up 
---
I will get my tinfoil hat
---
That's a good point about the gloves. I've been trying to use the time I've been questing on my alt to focus on the afk skills I've been putting off training on my main, but sometimes I'll end up with three or four things I'm trying to pay attention to and it kinda gets out of hand.
---
U're*

Yo I literally got Ahrim robeskirt on my 8th barrows too!

---
Not a single post
---
okay so what happens when you have your bank litterally full with members items? then your mems expired and you get an extra 200 or something slots? then you buy mems again and you have 1000 bankspaces.
---
Monks Robes count as a Sara item, at least in GwD
---
Welp
---
lol
---
❤️❤️
---
Someone else will probably reply with a more robust answer but you can assume that untradeables will be dropped in the wilderness. If you're trying to kill bosses or something bring 3 items because if you have an expensive 4th item you will get smited for it.
---
Outside of the wilderness the kept on death gets very weird, I've died with full barrows on and kept like 8 items or something.
---
Given the fact that you have Nieve as your slayer master, I'm not sure you can do Demonic Gorillas. They have a Monkey Madness II requirement

Why are you asking this question... Wouldn't happen to be an OSRS Dev looking to do something nefarious, would you? But I'd go with the north side of Prifddinas; last I saw you could walk all the way around to be greeted by a big gate and a dead end. Other good choices are dead ends in Meiyerditch, the area east of Brugh De Rott and south of Barrows by the wall that you never need to visit, in a far off corner of one of the Rat Pits you aren't required to enter for the Quest, the far west side of the Menaphos wall, southeast of Cave Horrors by Trouble Brewing, far west of the GWD shortcut to the Wilderness, and similar forgettable locations not used in Quests, Diaries, Clues, or Comp.

What's the best setup for farming kbd for the pet?  Currently I am using a RCB with ruby bolts (e) and diamond bolts (e) to switch.   I am saving up for a DHCB, but was curious if the cost is worth it or should I instead go for a zammy hasta, DHL, or ACB?
---
stats: 90 attack, 92 Strength, 81 Defense, 99 ranged.
---
Am I better off swapping to melee and investing in a hasta?
---
Is the difference between ACB and DHCB noticable?
---
Would it be worth it to invest in a dragonhunter lance?
---
Im In the same cc with this guy (wehatewomen) and he once said that im an ugly cunt, which is literally True, but I dont think you guys are taking this into consideration. In the final analysis its all his fault to begin with: dont create a runescape account if ya dont wanna lose everything. 
---
You do realize with the conversion to USD it's almost the exact same numbers in the exact same equation.
---
I've never seen someone *flex* their lack of intelligence before, on a Runescape subreddit no less...why am I even remotely surprised.
---
I love getting crashed at dust devils. Some level 90 retard comes up and starts bursting my stack, I just walk a little and let him stack them. Then I barrage that stack. No damage, no need to pray, and I can out dps him easy. 
---
I hope the new owners have the balls to finally put MTX in OSRS. I want my daily spins/xp lamps. 
---
So If I do member for a month and change my name 1 time, will it stay permanent if I let my membership lapse?
---
Sucks about the reset but understandable.
---
How much is a bond? Can I just buy a bond and change it  permanently without being a member?

Same, for other reasons. My only guthans spear was looted with full inv. Teled out before I could pick it up from ground. Rip.
---
Assuming you're  60+, I don't think so.  
---
If you're under 60 then wildy course would be a good option, but 60-90ish seers (with diary) is the best xp/h. 90+ is ardougne, and you can boost into ardougne early (Prolly 86+, doubt it'd be worth at 85) with pies

so basically last man standing?

Currently 71. So that would mean I’d have to get all the stats for hard to change my teleport. So without diaries, is Seers still the best?

That's a great one.

Once found, players dig on the spot and have to find out the PIN Number.
---
Once the correct PIN is entered, the player is given the reward, the keys disappear, and the chest returns to the owner.

This item can help spice up drop parties and can potentially have more puzzles/locks aside from the PIN Number (Sliding puzzle for example)

I'm welcoming you to try to prove me wrong with direct facts and not just "he spent this much money" or "he gave this person money".  As I said above, I don't think he's on shit money, but I don't think he's on as much money as most top RuneScape twitch streamers. If you look on Glassdoor a reoccurring theme with that company is people say the salary is crap.
---
working with the budget i have as i mostly play ironman and the questions arent that hard. 50m is alot of gp for people
---
Well depends on whether you pronounce it “anti” or “anti”? 
---
Damn what an unfortunate situation. I would feel devastated if that happened to me. Hope you get the items back...

Stop being a Virgin and getting nervous over content made 10 years ago

*PeePee Enlargus: 69 blood runes, 69 body runes, 69 Magic.

-This spell would temporarily make the player's peepee twice as large as it normally is. This spell would have an additional 10% boost if wearing the Boner Amulet (i).
---
Not without Mage levels or runes
---
Well a lot can happen in a few hours, let’s say u got a pet or an expensive item while bossing?
---
Just tank them bruh
---
And while they’re at it make smithing blirite swords after the quest possible

Droptrade to main.

If you'll be going with friends or clanmates you can go without herb to try it, making some extra pots for you won't be a big deal. 78 would be the primary goal though, for making your own brews/restores. That's most of the work in prep, and you could stick with 78 until you have the most important pieces of gear out of the way. Making one more ovl or scouting bosses that drop them is not a problem. Long term, or if you want to raid with strangers, get 90 and you can make your own overloads.
---
I'm not sure what the cheapest potion to train with is right now but it changes pretty often. Super restores will pretty much always be in heavy demand though, so they're safe.
---
I'm curious if the roll back hurt our Lord and savior settled.
---
To have a blast.
---
lmfao valued at $700m. RIP the previous owners who sold Jagex for $300m in 2016. EZ 400m profit for the chinese if they get it sold ofcourse.
---
Rick Astley plays his song 
---
Multiplier based off prayer level?
---
probably some of them yah. 
---
The roll back was necessary i would rather lose my whole bank than have the game permanently ruined thanks to a bug. And jagged has always had a firm stance that they will not return items. Move on 
---
Dunno I never bought bonds I grind for gp
---
So Void+Guthix claw

I know.

I didn't have much time to take it before it teleported again, but it was able to walk around on the water just like the ducks. It, also like the ducks, was unattackable.

Still waiting for the prove check 
---
very helpful thank you. 
---
Would it be too greedy to ask to let us trim steel armor with blurite for a fee of like 100k to thurgo
---
no.
---
it means they allow trust trades where one guy gives the other one dmm items/gp in exchange for gp on the main game.

When the healers come, try to hit one of them and then focus on changing your prayers. Keep doing this until all of them are off of Jad.

It probably isn't but yesterday I went to an unrestricted world and went to Barrows without doing any research about it just for fun. Full Dragon and 99 all stats I died in two hits. So yeah I'm a bit nervous now lmao.

Sometimes when I search for something IRL I add an OSRS to the end...

Why so much salt?

Aarh okay, seems like the timer doesnt change, just the amount regenerated. Thanks for the answers
---
Posted this late last night so it didn't gain any traction so I'm reposting.
---
thanks man. i tried them for the first time yesterday and got like 5 kills per trip. is there any way to predict how they will attack next? i know it's 3 attacks then they switch... but they hit me hard once before i can switch
---
If we can prevent players from losing stuff after a fuckup like this there should be a proper backup procedure before rolling out an update. Even if that takes 2 hours. 
---
...12 years ago was almost 6 months before the release of GWD 
---
As a Brazilian myself, I think we deserve our own server.
---
&gt; The fun is the journey not the destination.

Wise words! couldn't be more accurate for OSRS

How can your 150 ping matter if the game tick is 600ms?

Why are you so stupid? Just use your atm card pin as RS bank pin, duuh.
---
Is this the runescape remastered that has been teased for a few years?
---
Move closer. Ping, at some point, is based on distance and server quality.
---
I'm not sure where runescape servers are, so i'll use LoL as an example.
---
When the servers were in Cali, I played on about 90 ping. That meant it took about 45ms for it to reach me in Wisconsin and 45ms for it to travel back to cali.
---
When it moved to chicago, my ping dropped down to 22.
---
Things don't move instantly. Distance matters a great deal.
---
No you are being an ass now, prayer flicking was a bug but runescape wouldn't of lasted this long without it.  No 3rd party timer is going to get you to prayer flick perfectly thats a skill you learn.
---
Possibly, I don't know the logistics behind it but I'm assuming since you can use real cash to buy in game gp it could be considered.

When you doing bandos and click house tab instead of bones to peaches.

Don't you think that they'd be able to tell that another mod is picking up tbows instead of doing work? Like they were actively working to track down tbows and fix the bug and somehow they wouldn't notice that one of the jmods is picking up tbows and selling gold and shit instead of helping lmao. The theory doesn't work unless you believe all of most of the jmods are in on it, and even then it doesn't work

Thank you. I did a bit of googling myself to see if there have been any tests comparing hidden polls to open polls and couldn't find anything, so I'm genuinely curious whether people actually have a good reason for wanting the poll results hidden or they're just jumping on the reddit "bandwagon".. But yes I understand and I agree they should be hidden now.

NH pking basically made osrs pking shit.

This is how you get eoc combat bar

Ice Barrage has the same max hit as god spells, casts at the same rate, and costs 2x as much.

On the bright side they're hiring experienced people instead of interns. On the downside they're from Riot, Amazon, Playstation, and EA...

We are going to build a wall.

Just use runelite lol

?????? In 800 hard clues u never had one over 2m???? Theres absolutely no way
---
Venezuela
---
lol... thank god you're not a dev
---
I hope not, but honestly, with the amount of MTX in triple A games now, it’s possible
---
I...have to disagree. This is a popular area and if you were using runelite to extend your screen you could easily see the spawn from the guild. If this was intentional, it's pretty stupid for them to not think about it being rolled back.

This

Thanks now I’m horney

for the most part, a large number untradables don't count towards the 3 item limit. untradables are always kept if you die below level 20 wilderness, and always lost if you die above - the items just disappear from the game, you cannot go back and pick them up.
---
certain untradables that are useful in pvp combat such as void armour, fire cape, fighter torso et cetera become broken when you die in a pvp situation and must be repaired by paying gp, and 75% of the repair cost goes to the person who killed them.  
---
a pet is kept upon death IF it is one of your 3 most valuable items (assuming you're unskulled). because pets have a really low value, almost everything will have a higher value than it which is why people drop everything else they have. I don't know if different pets have different values, but my only pet is the agility squirrel which is only valued at 100 gp.
---
if you lose a pet upon death, it can be reclaimed from probita in ardougne if you insured it prior to losing it. insuring a pet costs 500k for each pet, reclaiming it costs 1m. I think the 500k cost is a one-off, you don't need to pay insurance again each time you reclaim, but I could be wrong so don't be cheap and risk your pet over 500k, check to be sure.  
---
clue scrolls depend on how and where you die. above 20 wilderness it is lost forever unless you have a clue box which protects it. below 20 wilderness but still in the wilderness, if it's a pvp death it drops to the ground and lasts for an hour like any other gravestone item. if it's a pvm death outside or below 20 wilderness, it is kept in your inventory like a normal untradable.

because people are equally dumb and give them money

They really need to handle these updates better. Like put a 1 hour timer to server shutdown so everyone can prepare for it. Then shutdown the servers, make backups and patch.

Good luck with everything bro!

---
I agree with this post it would give new options for range and make it viable with a cbow
---
That's what I was thinking , so it seems like the REAL solution is to eliminate bonds. 
---
Too relatable. Trying to get my friend to give it a go while im here sweating tob with max gear
---
Ive always wanted wasd in rs
---
Swampletics good
---
what do you mean man? 30-100 that's 70% chance he'll get quadruple his money, way better odds than the bots 
---
nice hp level
---
Agreed they chose to restrict themselves.  their should be 0 updates for ironman mode. 
---
How one should and how one does are different things. No law says they have to do anything, and it apparently it is how they treat theirs. 
---
what if the causality goes the opposite direction? you don't know the reason behind the correlation.
---
Are slayer monster dots a different color? Or did you highlight them? 
---
If you for some random reason are using ethernet over powerline or bad bad wifi you can improve your ping a bit there. Went from powerline to wifi shared from phone(waiting for proper wifi adapter) and ping went down by 24 from 69 to 45!
---
Make a god bonus, like strength bonus and higher tier god shit has a better bonus. Like an Arma themed rune plate would be +5 god bonus, ACP +10, full Arma book +5 or 6 etc. Then based on god bonus you hit a higher percent in damage and/or accuracy. 
---
Pking?
---
Where's the d long
---
Edit* I would make it as strong as the addy cbow so people can PK with it too instead of maple short bows and addy arrows if they wish
---
There's at least 2 different server locations in the US so make sure you're using the lower pinging worlds.
---
Haha, thank you! A kind user has already gifted me a bond and I am doing some final leveling and research before I give in. I believe I will try to focus on Agility and or Slayer as well as a few quests. I doubt I will make enough to afford a bond but I will try to get a taste of everything to decide how to proceed.
---
Yes pegs are better.
---
However they are 35?m for a a 5 accuracy bonus, so there are plenty of more useful items you should be getting first 
---
I see, thanks!
---
Door
---
Yo this is amazing! I'm from the same clan chat as you and I vote the same man. We got to unite to get better ping! It's crazy slow to play the game and I always lose to vorkath because of that :(
---
Back in the day everyone at school always seemed better than me at rs. With osrs I've somehow managed to still have irl friends but flex the fuck on them. I may be an asshole, but I enjoy feeling badass way more than I enjoyed feeling inferior.

If they are flaming someone else who doesn't deserve it, they've got an ignore list too. Don't pick internet fights.

Yes! Some did. But their scores are locked as regular ironmen on the high scores

Fuck, I'm too late.

Do you need to key still to get the invasion notes ?

Congrats though man!

That’s gonna be a log off for me dawg 
---
I never understood the teleporting thing either. It was the people who were too lazy to get 85 mage or were on ancients and couldn't TB that cried the most. The safeing complainers were funny as well.  
---
I admit I rushed all kinds of people. I also didn't care much if people did it to me. And sometimes id be impressed with how much damage someone could do in so little time. 
---
I wouldn't PJ though \*unless\* someone got a big PK and they lolligaged showing it off, in which case they were asking for it. 
---
But at the end of the day its the wilderness and all bets are off. if people wanted a structured fight they should go to the duel arena.  
---
On Wednesdays we get Settled.
---
Today we get a guy called Freddo in a frog mask killing people doing agility in the wilderness
---
Cox lol
---
This tbh

Hope so myself !! xD
---
Ye
---
Get that shit out of here 
---
Then removal of free trade and wilderness will happen again
---
Let's say hypothetically that jagex could prevent all gold farmers and they set the prices. 
---
What would be jagex's motivation to not constantly increase the amount of gold you get for each bond? There wouldn't be any. So they would steadily increase the gold since it doesn't cost them anything and would slowly make the game more and more pay to win and devalue all other activities that generate gold naturally by inflation.
---
To prove this situation: let's say that jagex sells 10m bond for 10 dollars and currently 1000 people buy it every week. However if they sold a 11m bond for 10 dollars they could sell 1100 a week. Why wouldn't they constantly raise the amount of gold in order to get more money since making and selling bonds costs them nothing. Of course there is an upper limit to this. They couldn't just sell max cash for 10 dollars because they would lose players due to the game becoming stale or unfair for non payers and as such lose those membership costs.

The tiger atop the cliff is your past.

The tiger at the bottom is your future (we all have that tiger to look forward to right).

The present may not always be comfortable but enjoy it and savour the things that are.
---
At least that's what i read into it, im certainly no authority. 
---
I lesson learnt, yet you'll see people mentioning you all around in such a closed minigame. you'll always be curious to see what they're saying. It's not like you're walking around g/e and getting randomly flamed. 
---
petition to rollback reddit and twitter as well so there is no evidence the rollback happened
---
Poor attempt at a deflection.
---
Since you can't back up your statements, I suggest you stop spreading misinformation.

Cheers!

I'm going to assume you put treasure trail loot in there obviously. So, somewhat misleading. But still, lots of cash.

That guy on the left legit has a built in arma helm fuck

Lol noob you don't even have torso, btw combat bracelet &gt; mithril gloves, also get armadyl blessing for ammo slot, free 1+ prayer
---
Isn't that what a bottle Royale is...??
---
I don't think so with graphics but runelite has something under GPU that let's you increase the draw distance 
---
Im not in argentina now but support, i played many years with bad ping and theres a lot of people playing from south america 
---
I remember when I tried to get in there with all my keys. 
---
The only item of significance from treasure trails is the ranger hat. Not really misleading though, as I got the clue from a slayer task.
---
Thanks!
---
This is tinder
---
As a 35 def account, I want that
---
Awww thought you had some good sites.
---
hmm. I'm pretty far from the reqs (especially since one is kill Zulrah) but maybe I will just use Karil's. 
---
It’s scary people downvote any RWT comments. Seems like we are cursed with cheating 
---
Runelite can increase your draw distance, use your GPU to improve the graphics, and can make your interface look like 2008, however no client out there can change the game's graphical style to the 2008-10 era.
---
That seems significantly low. 
---
Mexican server por favor
---
requires high combat to facetank, but i used full veracs, rune boots and gloves and a glory. inventory setup was 1 super combat, 2 annakarl teles, 3 prayer pots, and the rest summer pies
---
I use to PK a lot before they took it away, over a decade ago, but haven't given it a shot again. I might do some staking/pking once I get 99 def/ranged.
---
Make them all PVP worlds to be realistic.
---
Roll it back
---
No problem for our swampy boy.
---
The easy thing about this is that there are so many good RSPS servers. That being said they will most likely contain micro transactions too, but not on the level of rs3

So what happens with the other 9999/10000? Jk

Oof. Im at 63 with two drops. I got a Karils Top yesterday morning at 24kc when they told me there wouldnt be a rollback...
---
While I agree that there are very few methods, they're both very fast compared to the other grinds. I'd rather see Jagex make some simple QOL like left clicking the sand pit or slightly faster collecting.
---
I hope not.  Every new project for Jagex doesn't go well and it would mean splitting the communities once again.
---
You sure you want to know? It involves a toaster.
---
/r/BoneAppleTea
---
No idea but I don't think it's actually cheaper for osrs players if you don't play rs3. I'd do some maths to check first 
---
Haven't they tried and failed every other game they've ever tried making? I feel like the last few like Transformers and Stellarscape never even ended up coming out
---
It had problems with getting false positives, has been fixed since.
---
They're fine for their Slayer level.
---
Congratulations. You stated a non-pertinent fact.
---
u trollin
---
Why you got 1 clay
---
Jagex cant do anything about it since its in the hands of twitch. Twitch bans them in 5 min when you report but it. Unfortunatly they are remade in a few seconds. 
---
part of it is just American internet being garbage.
---
Why are PKers like furries? 
---
Both are fucking cancer and like to fuck children!
---
Bost your login info including pin and authenticator and I am sure someone can help you get set up
---
As a latin american player i would never go in the brazilian server
---
Sorry for calling a ban. that's my bad.
---
But my point still stands. no amount of kindness justifies doing terrible things.
---
I've been getting a decent amount of snapdragon seeds from the chests, but no crafting supplies short of gold/silver ore. 
---
Better than nieve, though, I only get Bloodvelds/Greater Demons/Hell Hounds....
---
How could you rat on him after he did this for you! 
---
That's pretty inconsistent with how prayers work in this game. To be honest I wouldn't really want this animation every time I turn on my prayer either.
---
I'm part way through the grind myself.
---
Could I just ask why everyone uses blowpipe rather than zammy hasta for it? I found that when ranging my killrate wasn't much different to hasta due to how dependent range is on accuracy bonuses from armour, yet the time cost for getting the ammunition for blowpipe is huge. Never seen anyone not range them though. Any reason why?
---
As a nordic european I support this! Should be humanright to play osrs without latency!

Just because his outfit is the same doesn't mean it's him. Anyone can make their clothes like his, and I bet tons already have. Can't really tell without the chat log or a right click

Ban anyone calling me Richard

Because defending urself when people flame you 24/7 is a terrible thing?

I'm more concerned about the fact that that thing could be stored in a hidey hole.

What
---
RS3 has Brazilian Servers and customer support since long before the EoC. I don't think this would be hard to implement
---
I live in the middle of nowhere and usually play on 300+ ping with our only available isp :/
---
“OSRSHelpMe” great CC, lots of us share a home world. PvM, skilling, lots of chatter. 
---
Lol you keep thinking that way. I’m sure everyone agrees with you
---
runescape is an endless grind you can pay to skip. they love that shit
---
Fuckin kek
---
What part of the lore are you looking for? The wiki has a bit about GWD and 3rd age lore, I know that much
---
&gt;roperly? Ha. Nice joke. I'm a New Zealander but I usually play on US worlds.. its really not a big deal..
---
It is a big deal, dude. Some things we type and send on OSRS are just lost on the way to the server, then we have to type those things again
---
It's consistent with pathing in the rest of the game, at least
---
This is very very very common lol 
---
Somewhere in the distance, UIM Verf is breathing heavily
---
whoosh
---
The real choke daddy

ruining the game

Yeah, I was going to say that's a massive improvement.

Or maybe he derailed the debate

Yes!! I'd love this to happen.

Ghandi was a piece of shit, just like the agility skill lol.

Im from israel and i feel your pain. Hope they add more servers

That went pretty well last time imo
---
Thanks Is it ok just to use diamond or would ruby and diamond be more effective?
---
There's a chance the acc is compromised
---
Holy shit man that’s awesome. Good rng
---
So was Rune gear to be fair.
---
Downvoted, when people put "An interesting title" it pisses me off.
---
The god spells are the coolest spells in the game, so this could be an amazing update. I'd love to see use for the god spells in PvM and this could make it work if you can get the accuracy high enough.
---
Good Star next to world, see if world says PVP world. That or high risk. 
---
Can someone explain what’s going on?
---
I'd rather see them come up with a new minigame that fits OSRS better.   
---
Also, there's a reason they started OSRS before Summoning. A lot of players quit because of that skill, myself included. I loved stealing creation and Soul Wars, and I want them to bring stuff back that feels really similar. For what we pay though I think we deserve more than a reskin of old RS3 content. 
---
Yeah 85 here, died to Jad twice because of misclicks. I want the cape so bad but the time sink for no reward hurts.
---
Rebinding is g2g. Just don't bind 2 or more keys to a single key function. 
---
Yes please Jagex. I've been playing for over 15 years now and always on 150+ ping. It's annoying being locked out of so much content, especially PvM.
---
I’ll sacrifice my reddit carma for this question: why do u think it’s fake? Serious question

Good because Claws of Guthix is my favorite spell.

People bring tele tabs for slayer tasks?

gz, im 4750kc on kbd still dry. SHould get another 100 or so in tonight. Hoping for your RNG.

I’ve only tried once and died cause I prayer flicked wrong and died In one hit lmfao haven’t went back since

Make another yolo

This would be really cool

Ironman here BTW....

This. I finished a slayer task and completed a clue on my way into work, checked in on my lunch break, all progress gone, I was so confused.
---
I'm pretty sure JaalPeds been considering real quality of life and account support a waste of time and money, and have been funneling all of those resources to this big new secret game they've hired tons of people for.

I'd honestly be surprised at this point if they even use code review or automated testing \*at all\*
---
maybe if this gets the attention it deserves something will be done about it So annoying killing them legitimately and seeing all those bots running around for 2 months now...
---
lol no
---
Submit a support ticket on the website
---
I THINK the items always go from left to right might be wrong tho
---
Girlfriend
---
And getting paid for it? Sureeeee
---
Or have it spawn elsewhere. 
---
In an ideal world all iron men would have a personal world but we dont live in that world. Sorry
---
But hey there's single way combat shamans in Molch
---
Sandstone update used to get buckets of sand easily.
---
Pretend to be a bot 
---
runescape:battle royale
---
Every item has its own roll on the drop table. IF this is real it’s crazy rng
---
Same.
---
That looks soooo satisfying
---
Shit I'd do it for free. Jagex pls
---
They have to the Chinese servers, the Chinese version of the game has incredibly amounts of P2W conveniences and elements GGG knows better than to implement in the standard game. I don't know the popularity of it over in China though, perhaps P2W elements just jive with them culturally. 
---
Hot, but I doubt this community will appreciate it.
---
I think you mean: "And then you log out."
---
Ah yes so Xbox is irrelevant because it didn’t sell as well as a Sony guess they’ll totally stop making them now.  Look Sony did nothing but push Xbox back into focusing on gamers first. I’m glad that Sony is successful. I’m also glad Microsoft is innovating to compete. Xbox isn’t irrelevant until it’s no longer being supported. 
---
Maybe you will get a server in winter of 2020.
---
No we get it. I asked why you’re reposting it 
---
they arent soloing
---
Spawning an item is different than creating an item spawn.
---
They’re also easy af to kill so it’s a two way street. 
---
i mean if your real life physically does it for you on your account on your computer im not sure what jagex can do about it but its pretty scummy if you ask me. earn it like everyone else did.
---
not pay to win but it is pretty annoying I agree
---
another point for dota up on the big board
---
Nope. It automatically trims all your capes.
---
The game doesn't remember a "preferred style" anymore. Instead, each individual weapon remembers what style you last had it on.
---
This was big on here like two weeks ago. They even added a disclaimer to pures. Maybe you didn't quite understand the reason for it?
---
You don't.
---
Think of the poor green dragons though!
---
I bet you if you login and say out loud you're just gonna to steel dragons for fun for a little, they'll drop the legs
---
I’m i Spain and i get around 40 
---
I'm with you i just posted my own thread about skeletal wyvern bots Some of them have been running 2months+ 0 BAN I'm sorry but what is jagex thinking are they on vacation or something? this cannot be allowed to continue 
---
Same
---
Last time was less of a split and more of a quarantine. 
---
I scan it with Avast and Malwarebytes frequently. Can the malware make it past those two?
---

Ewww anyssa - qxvy //a friends cc
---
Up!!!!!! 
---
Parabéns pela atitude, Iakee! 
---
@jagex olha pra nóis, nunca te pedi item!!! &lt;3
---
Ok, got it. Now what?
---
:( tebow was the talk if the town that one magical season 
---
Jagex is owned by a Chinese company yet where is my asian server?
---
These are pretty much everywhere, gargoles, kurasks all profit slayer mobs are pretty much botted to death
---
sending you my rng fam! u will for sure get it soon
---
Seems quite likely
---
Bro what???? You do know that just clicking on a stream wont do anything to you right? Clicking on anything in the description will . Rofl ....
---
I did get Prime again and did get my 14 days, thanks though. Split the cost with a friend and connected with Amazon Household, works out pretty well
---
Do monkey madness 2 asap or u have no balls
---
What's a dice bot? 
---
Why doesnt jagex care this definitely has to do with ranarr seeds crashing wich in turn hurts actual players 
---
Does this include doing all clue scrolls received? 
---
And then all 4 people who were actually playing it can continue playing, and the million people that claim they played it all the time can continue ignoring its existence forever!
---
I haven't played in seven years, but this sounds amazing. 
---
It’s possible. It’ll look pretty suspicious getting the cape in 1 attempt 
---
If it brings in more players I'm all for it
---
That dev? Andrew Gower.
---
Bond is healthy mtx. Everything else is unhealthy mtx in comparison. 
---
I got it and then I used it to get the notes. I then dropped the notes later (to free up space) once I realized I've already put them to use from talking to the King about them which prompted the twig conversation. 
---
Why not bring back all of those old prayers, I forgot what they were though but I thought they were cool 
---
There are a lot of factors. Distance, server equipment, client equipment, internet speed, etc. I’d say 45 ping on runescape is pretty good. Companies like Blizzard and Microsoft obviously have much more resources to devote to their side so you’ll see better connections to them. 
---
As far as things you can affect, probably your WiFi/Ethernet Card or adapter, ISP speed, and making sure other running programs aren’t downloading and uploading a lot of data. 
---
Champions aren't balanced by price lol
---
Fake: op matching with his friend 
---
Gay: op
---
bring combo food to quick heal ;:) also recoils
---
shit man i havent played in a couple of weeks so i guess that is why i missed it :/
---
h
---
That's what's great about his guides is if you're not slacking you never have to pause except in the first 2 minutes to gather materials. You bring up his quest and watch the vid start to finish and you're done. 
---
Mtx that can:
---
* Boost your xp/hr (by doing faster things)
---
* Can skip a lot of content by skipping all gp farming
---
* Allows you to buy power.
---
I would argue that its better than not having bonds, but i mean, it's very much a big mtx. I don't have stockholm syndrome at all.
---
Lmao that looks like so much fun dude you're awesome 
---
I try my best to stay up to date, but how does something like this pass? I ruined a 4 year old pure b/c of something out of my control... Not really a fair update if you ask me
---
They're probably using the same system they have been using since the start of RS2. They're in desperate need for an upgrade, but good luck getting the Chinese overlords to pay for that.
---
I love when someone crashes my low level pure thinking I'll get bullied but then I come on my maxed main in Max str gear and two shot whatever crab they are on. It always ends hilariously
---
Honor. Now I can't go to rev caves for 2 mins without getting tb'd, barraged, and triple AGS'd by 4 dudes all smiting me. "Honor" is overrated but still, jeez. How is that even fun lol
---
I'm getting off work tonight at 9. I haven't played hardcore in over 9 years. I started a character a few days ago on osrs and am going to buy members tonight. Where should I start and what should I do? I'm so lost. I used to have my dad and mom to guide me around but now I'll be alone and just need a little guidance without being overwhelmed. 
---
I'll take a pass on the eccentric billionaires. The odds become too high they'll get bored, strap all the game servers to a rocket, and shoot them off to some other planet.
---
Maybe he doesn't have a second account with membership he could drop it to. Might as well get the 60k than just dropping it to some random.
---
I currently have 173 hespori seeds. can you add a gold sink there you take 25 hespori seeds and 1M cash and it can be used on the flower outside of hespori cave to revive hespori
---
Whats that do?
---
Im from Australia and I primarily play on German worlds. The ping really isn’t that bad.. 
---
Didnt see this in my feed like I thought I would. Yesterday was a bit... Messy. 
---
I really like it. Neives butt is really off. But the mesh work is pretty good. It doesn't feel like a texture is painted over I feel a bit of the depth
---
I’m all for these suggestions regarding new servers in countries with a large playerbase, but as someone working in the IT industry myself, I don’t think you should get your hopes up. I doubt Jagex has the kind of money to implement new servers in countries they don’t already have a presence in. This is probably the reason that the “Australian” worlds are actually in the United States. 
---
Bump us up to $12 and maybe we have a chance￼...😂
---
All bow before the legendary SwampIetics.
---
Teleporting was definitely NH within the pure community at least.   I pk mods i got kicked from foe for glory teleing from a NH brid iirc.
---
Please god let it be true 
---
i don't give one single fuck about people who lost their stuff, have fun rebuilding 
---
Mods don't read this thread
---
Yesterday's update accidentally included a tbow spawn where that bush is now. Naturally, players started looting them and Jagex rolled back the servers to before the update. When they patched the tbow spawn they put a twisted bush there instead.
---
You can't burn RuneScape servers at the border, so it might be viable international aide.
---
if I'm not mistaken, 45 unlocks blackjacking. Do that.
---
I've also always liked the idea of making the hill giants in the lava maze a fire giant. This would make it so that f2p players/ironman have a way of getting a rune scimitar except from smithing one. This would also fit the 'lava' maze better and would make the wilderness a more scary place in f2p. Right now when i'm traversing the wildy I just use f2p worlds as they are mostly empty in higher level wild. Another pking hotspot would be cool have in f2p.
---
Waterfall Quest and Witch's House will get you instantly up to 30 str/atk and 23 HP. I'd suggest working on quests as a good way to ease in and start seeing what you're feeling and go from there.
---
Pay dirt!
---
Can I change my interface from [this](https://imgur.com/a/lrJgdVv) to [this](https://imgur.com/a/hDuw0JE) on RuneLite?
---
It’s the iron knight uprising! Help us!! Summon the white knights!
---
pyramid plunder until 45 then it's blackjacking til 91
---
Fucking same
---
Depends on the target. Generally if they're weak to crush but strong against slash (Gargs for example) battleaxe will be better.
---
yea
---
A large % of players have never tried bh or pvp world ge/Camelot pking and will never understand this necessary mutual agreement.
