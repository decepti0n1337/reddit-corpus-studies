You found a new business venture
---
---
---
Same. F1-4 On my side panel.
---
Calling it orsr makes me think you don't really care anyway.
---
Uh oh. U got tiddies and u posting here. Hold the flood gates
---
Here for that Hunter hoodie, Thieving hoodie is pretty badass too
---
But can you buy it at that price sp you can get it without completing the objectives?
---
You still need them enchanted bolts. But yea you can buy those slowly
---
We're all always dying.

"How is this true to osrs"
---

---
Boy youre in for a shock, osrs is a build of runescape following the old school design not a exactly as it as in 2007 build.
---
Bold of you to assume they "missed" anything. 
---
Noobs with dumb ape brains and wads of cash to spend will want big, shiny, doofy looking garbage to make their accounts look amazing. Look at any MMO with P2P and you'll see it.
---
Haha, no it stops you if your cart is over a few thousand dollars.
---
Old Rune School Scape?
---
Is there a cc for zalcano. To form small groups better loot
---
Wowee
---
Thank you. &lt;3
---
Alright I hope the time machine you're building to go back and properly school a child on tongue in cheek humor is going well, since this post left you so distraught
---
Stuffed crab is the best.
---
Woah, Verac is a popular guy. Guthan is my favorite though.
---
And also pass as an undercover furry
---
Also im jealous of the jacket. The slayer symbold is goofy but identifiable and the game has bad graphics so its blocky way kinda fits. That maroon tho.. i wouldnt pay for it from the jagex shop without the accurate red but i rather like the jacket as a whole. Jagex plz
---
This is why I love the idea of revenant caves, even if it's stupid broken for clans being able to lock down entire worlds to bot it endlessly.
---
Nothing in revenant caves is necessary for pvm. All the unique rewards are only useful in the wilderness, where they're farmed. The only reason you would be willing to risk going into a pvp zone is if you want the items to use in a pvp zone. This is an excellent way to design a feedback loop into player choice.
---
Theres a little animation you use in a few quests to hand items over to NPCs, it would be cool to use that in player interactions
---
Found the hacker trying to steal Ops name
---
Too much negative mage accuracy that vestments robes are worth it
---
I will get 99 agility for this.
---
Oh my god there are gloves too?? I HAVE TO GO BACK?
---
Will you be doing the inferno? If so it will be good for that

The construction icon in the skills tab used to have a green pixel in the middle I believe.

How will they make sure you can‚Äôt wear your quest cape hoodie if they release a new quest?
---
Yes it's good for pkers and less good for pvmers hence why i said overall
---
What I thought still made me giggle a little.
---
that option C dragonstone looks like it would actually fit very well.
---
Happy cake day
---
My bad, used very poor wording. I agree with you, but where are you getting 500k from? (just seems a bit lower than my calc)
---
Buying gold, so I suppose gold farmers
---
Video games cause violence too. Hes going to grow up to be a serial killer
---
The comparison to msb shouldn't have been there. If they just said explicitly that its a 3 tick range weapon, 2 on rapid, there would've been no problems. Not sure why they wouldn't clarify this fully at the time.
---
If you fish in draynor or at barbarian village in F2P you can run into some hilarious conversations.
---
I got the full set in 7 games. I didn‚Äôt realize that it was kind of rare.
---
dude if you‚Äôre dying literally every time you cross into the wilderness then you must be doing something wrong. i‚Äôve been PKd exactly once and it was while i was afking wildy slayer (ie, my own dumb fault), and yet i go there for a clue step at least once a week. just pay attention to the minimap and be ready to hop worlds if you really don‚Äôt wanna fight. it‚Äôs seriously not that big of a deal
---
They havent increased it the real dollar is inflated.
---
Also you can use the osrs highscores page to see your exact exp if you wanted it.
---
ROFL. Doesn't exactly give you more XP rates to begin with. What in the client makes skilling easier? Cannon overlay for slayer that should exist to begin with. Ground markers... Bank tags.. agility hotbox highlighting? What else that's truly "lazy"? Or are you just in the "3rd part client bad" group because ?
---
Option A is the least bad, but really need to change the helmet to a normal full helm. /u/MaximaxRS also had some good suggestions for a less purple version, which would be nice.
---
Of course you don't, but *if you do,* you should honor it.
---
Youre right, this was communicated poorly by me. I understand why this was down voted now, totally expressed something I didn't mean to. What I was indicating by unique is that we will see maul abused less after this nerf, but I like your word choice more. Sorry for that. For what it's worth, I totally support the maul change.
---
I just hopped worlds (the first time I made it to fossil island) until I found someone stood at it and asked them for a hammer
---
Just get hard diary done
---
Bot
---
I think the bigger problem is that the osrs team is a tiny percentage of Jagex and has no real power to do anything major without approval.
---
i don't really see a problem there because you wouldn't be able to level the skills anyway
---
Mid-level cutie here, fresh off my second failed fire cape attempt and my nerves are shot so no more of that for today. whats some chill/easy stuff you guys like to do to help ease you back into enjoying the game after something frustrating?
---
The crystal gems make a lot more sense
---
I just don't get it though. We never asked for armor with a gem in it and it just looks plain stupid
---
Imagine using the official client in 2019! Switch to Runelite, the official client is dog shit.
---
Considering the gmaul is used exclusively for pking i think it makes sense that an npc who interacts with pkers all the time (emblem trader) figured out a way to make the gmaul even more deadly so his bounty hunters could take down more of their assigned targets. This also matches other similar items like the msb (i) scroll and saradomin's tear.
---
People on here just try to do all sorts of mental gymnastics to justify buffing slayer further because it's the main thing they do.
---
It's also pretty hilarious that if pkers object to anything they are toxic or "bitching and moaning" but of course when you or anyone else on here who shares your opinion says anything they must be bringing up legitimate grievances.
---
It's macroing, please tell how you think its not.
---
he's lv 55 with about 100 points to go
---
I was about to say I love the RS community, then I realized that was your title.
---
What's the aversion to paying for membership in cash? No access to a CC/Underaged and cant work?
---
well the runt was the best loot...
---
I like the idea, but I think that would be too hard of a nerf. The whole point is for people to have something to protect themselves with so they don‚Äôt die, with the huge drawback being that it‚Äôs 2-handed but incredibly weak offensively. So you basically can‚Äôt attack while wielding it and have to try and run to safety. If you couldn‚Äôt actually  run with it then it would just turn into dead content since you‚Äôd still probably die even if you had it to protect you.
---
Gmaul got nerfed - its spec now uses 60% rather than the 50% the dds uses, which makes the dds a better spec weapon.
---
yes sir, will update you when I max
---
"we pay we say" mainly, not to say people werent saying that too
---
Who would leave protect from circulation on in the GE? At least show experienced players for fuck's sake.
---
Generally if you have to ask, it's not allowed
---
What construction strategy is shown here, sorry I'm only 70 con so idk.
---
Get in the habit of looking up everything in the wiki and exploring different links there. Look through the skills for any unlocks you might want to work towards, check out quest rewards that might interest you. It's really up to you what you want out of the game and there is a ton of content so it might be a bit overwhelming but start small and explore
---
[removed]
---
What's that? I can't hear you over all these lootsplosions!!
---
Lmaoo
---
An unlock from tithe farm that stops weeds from growing.
---
Only some accounts have it.
---
I would buy the fuck out of these.
---
huh. Odd
---
Wouldn't pkers just join the cc and find people that way
---
Nice
---
You know what macroing is right?
---
who tf is designing this shit
---
They should make corrupted armor dragonstone instead and make corrupted match ghostly robes. sorted.
---
Fuck u twat there so many open world's
---
Lets get this on a tray
---
Most of it is just bots. If someone mines your world, report them for botting and you've got like a 90% chance
---
true, but the pvp aspect was definitely more emphasized at the time than the free trade aspect, coming from someone who was literally there
---
do it again with Harmony or any other chill song playing on the back
---
DO YOU realize how effective and efficient these clans and teams are getting, particularly at revenants? The protect from magic was a lifesaver when it halved the duration of the hold spells. Without that, many people would be dead even easier. I wish you had not messed with it and hope you reconsider. PKers are powerful enough this day and age. It's annoying how many updates Jagex has been doing recently to fix relatively trivial "problems", PKers needing their backs scratched cause they can't jump the rev shortcut, fellow BHers believing they are owed a kill when they absolutely are not. They have to survive and that means gaining defense, which they won't do so Jagex decides to hold their hand to help them. It's getting pervasive and annoying.
---
If you are an active pker regularly affected by these kinds of mechanics then you know why things like this and TB in f2p are getting added unpolled. They are such basic changes and just make sense for the integrity of pking. Should never have been polled in the first place.
---
Mousekeys were banned for dropping stuff faster than some could, Menu Entry Swapper literally makes it one click compared to putting in effort to do it faster.
---
imagine thinking this is homophobic.
---
I quit! Can't take this game any more!.....ok I'm back
---
What is op about putting the wiki on your screen... You telling me you manually compassed every co-ordinate clue and didn't just google it?
---
Savage methods

&gt; immense
---
I think you need a reality check. 2 seconds is not immense.
---
Banter at winterdaddy is fun as hell, it's a damn good time
---
I was kind of under the impression that Dinhs should make you practically invincible. You give up all offensive for pure defensive. In a 1v1 environment you should be able to outtank anyone. In multi Dinhs gets shredded by geared opponents.
---
You do realize some people came back to RuneScape because of mobile and only play on their phone/tablet, right?
---
*"If the player drink all doses or empties the potion, it will become a regular empty vial"*
---
hmm

yes
---
the floor here is made out of floor
---
It's literally stated in the news that they are testing it on newer accounts
---
They are a cosmetic, from a free to play monster, of course they won‚Äôt be worth a lot.
---
Should make them alch for 50k
---
And plenty of people think it should be use just like other items.
---
Missing the point.
---
ah my bad. Good catch.
---
Well given 6 months netted 3 mil... no
---
Yeh definitely strong. But nothing drastic or amazing. Especially when of all minigames and forced activities that one needed the most love from the team.
---
We don‚Äôt deserve this level of genius
---
Too bad Jagex doesn't think that.
---
They're literally rewarding lazy people, I wish they cared about the game.
---
While I 100% agree with the post you‚Äôre replying to you‚Äôre either very young or haven‚Äôt watched the last decade or two unfold in front of your eyes. Slippery slopes are the real deal.
---
What‚Äôs up with the insane lag at demonic gorillas? Does it have something to do with the design of the crash site cavern? If so, are they planning to fix it? 
---
It sucks because if you lag for like 3 seconds you can easily die there. I‚Äôm on the lowest ping world I can find. Don‚Äôt lag this hard anywhere else, ever.

---
You sound like you need one a lot more.
---
Black dhide is ranged armour. It is t70. It is *meant* to counter magic. Stop casting in mystics or xerics and expecting to hit a person with 99 mage and anti-mage armour..

Never understood how putting the Ammy in a frame made it never run out of charges, but hey
---
This is not a dating site.
---
Yes the World of Warcraft is knows for being an open, friendly, and accepting community. Definitely always good. Yes. Very kind. Such good.
---
Awesome I‚Äôll look into those thanks!
---
Eh. It helps solo PKers and not really anyone else. People complain about getting 20 man teamed, so this will probably help with that.
---
Besides, at mid-max level, people on normals using fire wave + entangle + TB inherently have a fuckload less food and a fuckload more risk (smoke staff + fire tome) vs budget ancients in salad robes.
---
Nice hiss!
---
Yup
---
I'm curious if there have been any PvM polled updates that did not meet the 75% threshold and made it into the game. If anyone can think of any, please post them with a screenshot or something of the past poll result they were in.
---
No. Cause then it ruins the, ‚Äúif you know, you know‚Äù vibe.
---
Zskillers is a pretty good cc, you need to be a level 3 skiller or 10 hp acc to get a rank but anybody can hangout and ask questions, a lot of the people in there have nearly maxed or maxed skillers and mains and are pretty knowledgeable
---
It‚Äôs been happening to me as well recently. A good fix is to restart your client when you enter the caves.
---
Honestly, back in actual 2007scape, I had such a good little group of friends at the fishing guild. I still remember some of the fun we had grinding our fishing to 99.
---
Why is that?
---
Ur a downy
---
If they are decent quality I would by a couple too lol
---
Short for no honor.
---
I played F2P for several months before becoming a member and I still had things to do and explore.
---
I only played like 3-4 hours a day, though. But I trained base 50/60s on all F2P skills before moving to member. It honestly made my life so much easier in the transition.
---
Then I found out about the Waterfall Quest and that I could have saved hours of training on cows/warriors. RIP.
---
I do think the balance of P2P vs F2P is a little imbalanced... but truthfully to someone that was brand new to the game... I had tons of content I could still achieve before buying member...
---
Now that I have played for some time, I can skate through most of the grind and know that you can easily quest 1k total level in like a week if you're dedicated and a mem, so no reason to be F2P for me anymore, just buy more mems.
---
Can i get a source please (am being genuine i would really like a source)
---
Would def snag the mage for at home, the hp for my rs gf, and quest to flex in public without anyone knowing why im so sweaty!
---
Not willingly, in the few times ive been forced into confrontation i havnt had much issue killing, but maybe its because i have um... ACTUAL GEAR and not salad robes and air staves.
---
What about lobster Karamja spot ü¶û?
---
There is a cc ‚Äúosrs advice‚Äù that will be perfect for you.
---
Runelite plugin
---
I don't care but for the record when you get people, especially if they're tanking or weaker than you and not likely to get the drop, to come with you under the pretense they'll get half of the loot that is by definition a scam.
---
Just pvm related stuff. Inferno, gp farming, pet hunting.
---
Some examples for a pure: brutal black dragons, zulrah, giant mole, kbd, zilyana, chaos fanatic
---
Oh and good for ge bankstanding

Assuming you aren't referring to the options in the menu, I'd imagine it's a plugin.

I mean he does have a point.

Why do people expect things to be free? And you even have the option of paying for membership through playing the game. Definitely not a thing most games do. And as others have already noted, it's $11.

I‚Äôve had some very interesting conversations at that spot: discussing poverty and the 2008 housing bubble and what it was like going through that as a pre-teen/teenager, talking to people who are on acid or other psychedelics and just vibing with them for a couple of hours, I could go on and on.
---
Of course, I can‚Äôt forget all of the racist jokes/slurs and general retarded-ness that happens ~70% of the time, but honestly those just makes the actual conversations a little bit better.
---
Budget ancients in salad robes already sucked. Easy to escape with teleport cos they can't stop you from doing so.
---
You poor thing. Get help.

 About wc?

Also, highly subtle? Maybe highly subtle to the point where I'm genuinely asking for his rationale as to why it's a terrible idea because I genuinely want to know.

At first I found it funny. But then I kind of felt sad for the guy.

No longer 2 minute buffer between keys and the drop rate doesn‚Äôt decrease for additional keys anymore! Bring a blowpipe , Zammy shirt, Ava Acu, Sara chaps if you have them. Bring a range pot and stamina pot , maybe 2 p pots 2 brews and the rest food and seed pod. I got 4 keys in 10 minutes a few times with this method.
---
Made a good rs fishing buddy at barbarian
---
Definitely do this and don't make them look cheap
---
Both of which are legitimate responses
---
Nice man! My first solo I received Zammy spear :) I would trade ya! Coxie the streamer killed a bit over 10k zammies getting over 80 kills per hour on 4 accounts... he would be jealous!
---
It makes the game more fun for the minority who are struggling as it is and brings more balance
---
Idk man everyone's just upset as always idc anymore.
---
I'm a pvmer btw

I love how you contradict yourself in the same post

Stick it out. Technically, i didn‚Äôt go to 99 at Wintertodt because I stopped 250 xp shy to get it with friends. But honestly, it‚Äôs profitable (albeit slowly) and it‚Äôs really less attention hungry than burning logs imo.
---
NxsPvm is open for you bro! Also have a discord server.
---
Nice. I'll probably do the same. Thanks
---
Sounds like sand crabs.. its either i was banking or i accidently afkd too long and logged

Just to clarify... I meant to remember to focus on your own switches TOO.  Getting the defensive prayers right are equally as important. Good luck!
---
Make it your shield slot, it's already the right shape.

Haha nice man I couldn't do more than like 20 something games maybe 30 I still only have the hat.

Send me a discord link or w.e (I never used it but have it downloaded on my phone) and I‚Äôll add the Clan now

My brother kinda has a hyper active brain that works a lot better when we can be portable with his laptop. He‚Äôs used to that classic touchpad life we had way back when but he has been starting to use a mouse and actually be more efficient.

Since the image says you are using it on the redwood fence I like to imagine you milking the fence for its thick juicy sap.
---
It doesn‚Äôt really need to be a good PC to run runescape, doesn‚Äôt have to be above and beyond
---
No.
---
Yes. Aside from the size of the collection, collections are valued based on 3 factors.
---
Burnt fish can't be traded on the ge, making a collection of them more valuable, since they must be burned by a player then sold to another player, etc, until they get into the collection.
---
Bronze equipment has a very low GE trade limit, making them very desirable for collection when compared with things like runes.
---
The third largest factor impacting the value of a collection of an item is whether it's f2p or p2p. If the ge limit of an item is 125, and you have 8 accounts, the limit is effectively 1000 every 4 hours. If the item is f2p, it costs you nothing to put in those offers. But if it's p2p, you need bonds on all those accounts, making the items more expensive to obtain large amounts of, increasing the value of the collection.
---
[Better explanation with examples](https://youtu.be/PwSuAoMjn7g)

---
Don't be obtuse. F2p mage, range and melee gear *does* exist
---
Ive set my buttons up but they dont work in runelite. And ideas why??
---
You should quit now and invest all your time into achievements... No fun no friends just work
---
I always thought they'd be a cool way to flex. Imagine, this demon pops up in Lumby and some steel armor noobs get to see an epic fight between a massive demon and a player in Justicar.
---
of course

---
Glad I got 99 farming while Liliwen was still hot af.
---

---
What‚Äôs the average time for getting 99 Fishing?
---
Its more like your clueless and judge an experience lots of people love that you've never tried
---
Only if I can dig up my pool and wear as a ring
---
Support
---
Quite the opposite, with a few exceptions. There was one guy who built up a collection of ahrim's staffs, then for years tried to get the ahrim's staff buffed to boost the price of his collection. Eventually ahrim's was made into a 1h staff and was given a damage boost, and the price went up tenfold.
---
This was more of an investment than a collection.
---
I always do my birdhouse runs alongside my herb runs. Somehow I just assumed literally everyone does that. It seems like a waste of time *not* to just do it all at the same time. Never had this happen because of that.

Not really sure, but I feel like f2p players in general are a lot more amiable, but then again the only p2p players I've come across have been either at the GE trying to flex on f2p players/beg for a bond or at LMS (which everyone knows the pvp community has a lot of assholes so no surprises there)

Cool man, that sounds awesome. Hope it was a good run. We‚Äôll be around if you need that refreshing taste of nostalgia.
---
Oh no, I'd also *like* a way to get a d pick that doesn't involve the wild, price be damned. The bosses that have a good drop rate, Callisto, Vetion, chaos ele, are just stupid content. They're only really doable by manipulating safe spots and guiding them to the edge of multi. Stupid mechanics and in the middle of a pvp hotspot like you say.
---
I posted the same thing, this guy going around asking about "Do you watch Twitch" then asks for one of your gear pieces. Jagex...

Have you thought about financing a laptop or pc from bestbuy?
---
I found a great laptop for your budget on amazon : 
---
Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop, 15.6" Full HD IPS Display, AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, Vega 3 Graphics, 4GB DDR4, 128GB SSD, Backlit Keyboard, Windows 10 in S Mode, A515-43-R19L
---
You might want to get another 4gb stick of ram and a bigger hard drive. 4gb ram is a little small for multitasking (watching netflix in a browser while using runelite for example). If you have never used an ssd before you're in for a treat.
---
then it's harder to click accurately in your invent. get my point? it's why literally every pk youtuber uses fixed in their videos.
---
Just because you're bad at mobile doesn't mean everyone else is
---
I honestly feel really bad for her. She's clearly been putting in work to make new stuff for us and all the feedback she gets is "this looks like rs3." Like it just gets harder and harder to justify employment when all the players say they want is purple rune. Whoever manages the art department needs to understand that delivering a lot of intricate and high quality assets should not be the measure of success here. The most important (and hardest) thing the artists need to do in this game is figure out which combinations of textures and polygons capture the 'soul' of osrs, if there is such a thing.
---
All those dragonstone armors suck
---
This deserves way more karma
---
I have 99 range would 100% buy my cape. I have 99 def,wc,hp,fishing on rs3 might consider those. But those are days long past.
---
Cute, but can you make the main colours more rune colored?
---
Your statement makes about as much sense as defending multi-million dollar insurance companies over an ingrained irrational fear of the word ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù... Does the upcoming recession mean we are ALMOST great again?!?
---
what is the fastest way to level RC from 40-50, on a 1 def pure?
---
100 upvotes on the games own sub Reddit is hardly a marketing success
---
THIS HAPPENED TO ME AS WELL about a year ago. I barely play RS at all anymore now.
---
Karil set with amulet of dam
---
My favourite is when jagex bundles completely separate questions into one, so that if you want one thing you pass, you have to vote yes to both.
---
Yes you have to click ur spec wep, and change back a tick before but it is very natural and you fake spec a few times first and you can pot hide the preload.
---
Also 90% of the playerbases uses runelite, so only the exlient users dont have access. If your using the normal client to pk, i duno why you would gimp yourself so hard for no reason.
---
Lol I‚Äôve done 5k kills trackpad only, I wish trackpad was an available rsn üòÇ, I suck at osrs with a mouse
---
We all do.
---
Cballs are chill but honestly after 2 weeks of one I got kinda sick of using that alt, the gp was just so slow. Especially when you compare it to stuff like Vorkath and raids on a main. 200k/hr wasn't cutting it for me lol
---
You could do something like a bones to peaches tab alt or a fishing alt (anglers are really afk), both of those are like 200k-300k/hr. 
---
Otherwise I think the best alts are typically combat based. Wyverns, Gargoyles, Brutal Black Dragons and Rune Dragons are some of the best alts that come to mind. Lot more investment into the account but the payoff are a lot bigger.
---
Because the people voting no are people who dont like being TB and entangled, not people who like entangling.
---
I mean there was the whole Mod Jed incident. But chances are you weren't affected by the Jed incident. But what more than likely happened was there was a database leak.
---
Well, can you?
---
I'm a simple man. I see weeb shit, I downvote.
---
they prescribe weed for anxiety?
---
You're absolutely right. Just interesting concepts to thing about.
---
Trust me I know these things. I‚Äôm not disagreeing that this is Widely used. I‚Äôm just saying that if pan1c is worried that his friends account will be banned because of this, it shows there‚Äôs an issue.
---
why doesn't it stop you for 15.0 seconds as the spell says it does?
---
Not a valid argument because all noobs can use runelite too, 90% of player use it already. The only ones missing out are exilent users but i dont think noobs would use that.
---
Also, generally their arguments are dumb and it's really obvious that what they actually want to do is just troll. If you want PvP support, ask for things like Dual Arena and LMS, not ways to make killing skillers and PvMers easier. The latter isn't PvP, it's trolling people for profit. The former is PvP, you fight people who actually want to fight people, are equipped for it, and ideally there'd even be matchmaking (though let's be real that's not happening).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I67pPXS96UI
---
Lol... there is no way it could be bannable lol. Its to stop people bitching about it.
---
You‚Äôre interpreting my complaint about scale prices being too low as me not knowing how to kill zulrah? You‚Äôre either trolling or genuinely mentally retarded. Either way, I‚Äôm sorry for your parents‚Äô loss
---
All of these PvP updates are direly needed for the survival of the sublet PK community.
---
They are truely integrity changes.
---
Not sure where the ass hurt is coming from. Im assuming the only PKing you did was casting your god spells for your diary req.
---
Just saying what he stared in his comment thread on the video.
---
yea cant you just buy the Bounty hunter points?
---
I disagree. In RS2 the bunyip summon healed the player once every 15 seconds for 3hp. It's not a huge amount but over the bunyips ~40 minute lifespan it was the equivalent to nearly a full inventory of sharks. A regen effect would allow mixes to provide more healing per inventory slot without making them eclipse their non-mix counterparts
---
They said it multiple times in QnA... It's not solution to just give all dead content items from p2p to f2p just because it's dead in members... You are not aware how it would destroy the f2p
---
Id argue theres mode agility capes than spectacles.
---
yep lol, welcome to the american dream
---
I thought line of sight was pvp only? Gz btw
---
I mean PKers are obviously different people with lots of different views and wants.  
---
But in general if we were to look at things purely from a "how can we make things benefit PKers/PKing the most"  all that stuff you listed totally is for slayer specifically.  
---
Whips and all slayer obtained drops would favor PK'ing more if it didn't require any slayer level and was dropped in the wildy (or given out by bounty hunter emblems).   For a while now a big chunk of BiS in general hasn't been super relevant for PK'ing whether it be because risk vs reward isn't worth it, or jagex specifically changed the item to be weaker in PvP
---
&gt;I feel like those are always moving
---
That's true. What would be considered good at the moment?
---
stfu nerd
---
what is the "best" way to get 99 fletching? darts sounds way too expensive and cutting bows seems way too slow
---
Just dont die. Iirc you lose the pet if its following you and it is not insured and you manage to die
---

---
Integrity and balancing changes generally don't get polled.
---
New content does.
---
Warding fits into the latter category, PvP balancing changes fits into the former. They did poll some of those, yes, but this was in their error.
---
thanks in advance man!
---
no ferocious gloves?
---
Yeah I realized that after I looked up who he was lol.
---
Barrows, torso, and fire cape are considered a good mid level account
---
Gonna take a bit to recover from that one
---
Rice
---
"Aggressive"
---
Walking around like flavor flav. Lol
---
Or you could not use it because you don't wanna bother with interruptions while Skilling. My whole point is there is no right or wrong way to play, and people's mindsets are so locked into "do this skill this way or you're wrong" which leads to people thinking , well I HAVE to do this method, and this method is a pain in the ass cus I get interrupted, so pls jagex make this method less interruptable. When in actuality the only reason something that op was introduced into the game is because you can be interrupted, and it's perfectly viable to do another training method if the interruptions both you. Gilded altars and ensouled heads are both perfectly fine options that are more relaxed and afk.
---
Ha, didn't cover the fuel door cover. Rip account.
---
I‚Äôm about to lose my membership for awhile. Is it better to liquidate my equipment and have a cash stack or keep the equipment sitting in my bank?
---
Broad Bolts during Agility is the best way if you're worried about cost but it's just as intensive as darts.
---
Pwople these days..
---
You could use dhoraks
---
RSN : Baile y
---
after what gearbox and randy pitchford have been doing i'm gonna wait til i can get BL3 for $10 or less before i consider it lol
---
Maybe you deserved it?
---
Being dismissive and ignoring people's valid concerns isn't going to make anyone agree with you. These changes *do* hurt people who don't want to interact with pvp.
---
I remember cutting maple logs just north of seers bank while watching the Giants vs. Patriots 2007 Super Bowl. 
---
Was peak 2007Scape for me. A dude allegedly lost a $1000 bet

why wouldn't you consider onyx an unique?
---
I got myself one after that post too. It's from somewhere in Asia so the sizes were off. I'm 6'1 and pretty slim, and got myself an XXXL and it was still too small lol
---
Trees don't get scared when you chat near them. Fish do
---
Everything you mentioned are great examples of quality 3rd party client features.
---
The features that tell you where every book in arceuus is, the feature that shows you everything you don't/shouldn't know about in mage training arena, the ability to swap use/bury on bones, the failed poll features such as swapping your prayer book around for pvp/pve advantages, etc. 
---
There needs to be a line drawn somewhere, sure marking tiles for herbiboar to make its tracks more visible is negligible but what if you go beyond that and mark the tiles where a shaman aoe is going to land?
---
Sadly, Jagex doesn't care about you.
---
They'd sell you to north korean slavers for a slice of cheese - and they don't even like cheese
---
Rs3 used to have this until they removed it in favor of mobile so I doubt it will ever be a thing re added to either game. 
---
Tbh I am not really a fan of adding it back either. With mobile it is simple enough to already do this with mobile. The only time this would be "needed" is if you are checking on your merches. To check merches you can simply log off at ge or quickly teleport there using the current mobile app. 
---
The only time it would be useful is if you are at a spot where ge is inconvenient to get to but you can get to a bank easier so you log out open app by what you need and log back in and grab it from the bank.
---
Are onyxs unique to zulrah?
---
Not even surprised, man takes so much pride in his ability to 1tick 5way but is 100% reliant on antidrag smfh. Zero skill besides hoping for Rambo gmaul prods on pures 12 combats lower

You don‚Äôt think someone could out heal your damage with the same pots?

Government ran fire departments is not exactly a socialist value...

Gmaul update literally ruined pking
---
Massively "multiplayer" online RPG.
---
Old crates and doors do, look around for them and you'll see.
---
I love these textures, shame they don't use them a lot for new content. Jagex is always tryharding with models, really breaks down the nostalgia trip.
---
Do most OSRS players actually like Sara more than Zammy?
---
Huge lul
---
calculatedfor my alt acc  how long would take to get to SOTE quest reqs and it was 85h+ questing not included
---
in that time I could be making 400M troloing
---
Fashionscape is about to get real
---
Please stop trying to turn osrs into RS3-EoC. If you want trash mechanics go back to exclusively playing RS3
---
Imbued heart is a literal handicap if your magic is above 94. It‚Äôs sacrificing a brew or restore for no reason. If you think you need it, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not trapping mobs the best way possible and if that‚Äôs the case odds are a brew or restore would do way more to help. Watch Xzacts guide and learn how to off tick mobs, corner trap and deal with various stacks. Focus on using up all your supplies so you can actually get to Zuk for practice before worrying about making it to Zuk with enough to finish because odds are you‚Äôll die due to nerves or lack of experience. Practice flicking, luring and re arranging stacks early on that way you‚Äôre not investing too much time getting to the late waves and just dying. Basically learn how to deal with mobs sooner and you‚Äôll be way better off in the long run.
---
"Me and my mates do bandos on the weekends"
---
The empty bucket in the inventory is a dead giveaway
---
High ping might make it easier tbh, many things in osrs are affected oddly, as an example you can ask splash for much longer if your fps is set to 1 instead of 50
---
Those kinds of questions get an automatic No (or Yes if they phrase it like "Do you not want..." from me. Phrasing questions in that way is toxic.
---
Tbh I'd say heart is a must have until you're at least 96-97 magic. Otherwise 1 hit from a bat = no more ice barrage unless you wait it out or restore.
---
‚ÄúQuantitative easing for the meme economy‚Äù Hahahaha high effort
---
God I wish that was the case
---
I‚Äôll summarize:
---
People who are upset about this are bad and should feel bad.
---
A glory hole for what, a dragon? I guess it's a win-win as long as they pay in dragonstones.
---
gz! how many attempts?
---
    that's not a valid reason
---
72
---
Jad plushie? Yes, please!  And you're totally right, Jagex is missing out on a lot of potential.
---
Correct.
---
Why doesnt someone just make them themselves? I wonder how much they would be to make
---
Yeah, people make a lot of the "this devalues my x" jokes, but... people like that *actually* exist. Some people actually want other people to suffer the same way they had to, even if there's an obvious, and reasonable, solution.
---
Every 15 seconds for 40 minutes versus 6 hp spread out over a while. Regen bracelet can do better and save you inventory spaces.
---
Thanks those are definitely the highlight of the piece.
---
To be fairahhhh
---
When will you people learn! That your actions!! Have consequences!!! You fricken fricks!!!!

---
I kept reading it as ‚ÄúI want heroine. 14m fishing xp and 93 fishing with no heroine. Sad times.‚Äù
---
I have a problem lol
---
Lots of people mine there. It's the only way to get jades/opals etc on early iron which are pretty useful for early teles. It's not like it's dead content, it's used a lot
---
&gt;big stuff isn't even explained
---
Look at Priffdinas. So much shit was unpolled. It's the closest bank to an anvil, closest to a furnace (and doesn't require payment like Shilo Village), and the closest bank to a sand pit. None of this was polled.
---
But the point of Nex was It was a long fight with low drop rates but many items to balance It. Teams were large as well so It was balanced.  Also Nex didnt shit out resources like raids does since it only dropped one roll of her drop table. I think good rewards could be OG armours, no upgrade shit to bandos/arma, a new high hitting rapid staff like a nerfed arma bstaff, royal crossbow, and prayer scrolls to upgrade protect prayers to deflects (rebounds 5-10% of what you would have been hit in pvm)redemption/smite/retribution/Leech prayers/overhead boost pray . But first they should nerf bp and tbow before adding range armour.
---
Is your girlfriend single
---
You'll only land that entangle if you bring mage offensive bonus. Now you lost inventory space. You can only cast the spell if you bring the runes. Now you lost even more inventory spaces.
---
And you're skulled if you attack them preemptively. Not a smart move.
---
Player driven economy....ironmen can't trade...

Posho. Cutting the Yews towards Catherby was the real spot for entertainment. Especially back when people went afk and got a flying axe head random / ent, or when people took on the aggressive randoms.

Just got a 3a Druidic robe off a clue.
---
Can confirm works 100% of the time.
---
Of course his copy doesnt have that..
---
Twitch.tv/AColdOne
---
If you buy more than one, you get access to special trimmed variants
---
Can you tell us what the armour would look like if it felt Old School?
---
Just learn the maps, there's not that many of them. Probably the only clue step that's actually easier without Runelite
---
I'm sorry to hear you don't like them. Can you specify why and let us know how you would have it look?
---
This needs attention and support
---
The girl looks exactly like how I pictured every girl to look like that plays video games.
---
Dude couldn't even get an xp theme pack.
---
How would you have it look?
---
No u
---
No you both
---
Appreciate it wiz &lt;3
---
Get your range, atk and str up to hit more consistently. Maybe park yourself in nmz for a couple days
---
Crossbows other than dhcb are not good for vorkath, if you have access to bp then don't use them. 
---
Don't try &gt;1 kill trips with bgs/bp until you have higher stats or maybe better gear. What other gear are you using currently?
---
No one who plays runescape owns 1000$
---
Also to add to what the other guys said. If the crasher does more than 50% of the damage, he gets the loot but if the Ironman does more than 50% none of them gets the loot.
---
Yeah idk what people are saying about black dhide, had a guy land 6 freezes in a row through black dhide and my 99 magic when he was in salad robes and a freaking water battlestaff wtf. Splashed once. The whole nerf black dhide thing makes no sense. You get unlucky sometimes but I would say I only get splashed on like 20% of the time in black dhide.
---
Also people can deal like 250 damage nowadays in the duration if a single freeze, yet jagex buffs pkers...  maybe they're just bad?
---
I had seers diary but I was absolutely tired of rooftop content so I did 70-73 agility here
---
2 def doesn‚Äôt matter. If it bothers you so much, do nature spirit, get 13 def and get addy gloves and use salad robes. Or gonthe extra step and get 20 def.
---
Personally 2 def wouldn‚Äôt matter to me, I‚Äôd still continue grinding. If you ever need help or wanna pk dm me, I‚Äôll pm you my rsn
---
Then it will be possibly dead content, and it's already to op of an idea, you could kill vorkath and zulrah in 30 seconds
---
I went to wintertodt for 60 fm.. this guy was aggressively telling everyone about flat earth and if you didnt respond or disagreed with him hed freak out.. kinda funny kinda sad
---
Lol all this outrage about rs3 looks and the community picks B over A.
---
!sticky
---
Its not tho, you can get it for $8 if you use your brain.
---
New tasks like: Kurasks, Skeletal Wyverns, Gargoyles, Nechraels, etc.
---
Just make an item sink so the parrot and cape is used to create a single item, cape + parrot
---
 Which can be equipped/unequipped as one item
---
Can confirm. Had 5 hour conversation with a guy the other day it was great
---
Everyone idolizes slayer but its my least favorite skill next to thieving/construction
---
Not just 1 slayer monster, around 70ish is when you have the proper block list/slayer helm and enough points to skip shit tasks.
---
Dude just give it a go in melee gear. Remember prayer is a thing, high prayer bonus, flick protection and you'll be fine while you build the bank up
---
They shoud just remove PvP &amp; Wildy its unfair.üòÇ
---
No idea what to look for here but congrats on completing 9 easy clue scrolls I guess
---
Ungrateful
---
Because it's literally a rune armor
---
No purple
---
Loads of people care about the wildy, but the bitchy PvM players want to ruin a whole aspect of the game cause boohoo I got pked for a spade, grow the fuck up you manchild.
---
I'm using elite void, salve ei, God dhide boots, blessing, and explorer's ring.
---
The thing is, I can often get 2 kill trips with a crossbow but I can hardly manage one with a blowpipe. I might just need practice though, I have not done as many kills with the blowpipe yet.
---
total xp
---
I think its base 70s but I like the clue thing more haha
---
I had steel drags (last skip) &gt; waterfiends. I hated my life killing these
---
Bots are farming it
---
Salt, pepper, garlic powder
---
Say that again but take your tinfoil hat off.
---
Reckon it‚Äôll go back up or keep crashing? Wondering if I should buy one now lol
---
Yeh, this is a little late now :'( I wrongly assumed I could add it afterwards like normal buckets of supercompost :(
---
Other f2p additions:
---
Castle wars, last man standing, rings of forging, clue scrolls
---
More and more are coming into the game and since there is next to no punishment for dying there aren't any being omitted from the game. This guarantees a price drop over time.
---
I second this I was in 330 in someone's POH doing gilded altar and some random dude did a 99 mini drop party... got 3 dscims and a couple glorys :) and that was just some random.
---
There's another guy now "This my kill" going world to world just crashing people at corp. Luckily he can't enter 2k+ worlds. But this is getting stupid. Where's the ban hammer?
---
Ohhh hahahaha very nice man
---
I think that developing it off of current armour models is what would feel authentic. 
---
Trying to change the sprites and models and upgrading them is not something that would make us log on and look forward to putting in the countless hours we put in, because so much of what we worked hard for had a different feel than what is being presented. It feels like a different energy is being put into the game when you stray away from the regular style too much. I appreciate how difficult it is to produce fresh ideas on an old model, and I understand the difficulties with this, but I believe it is more simple than what you are currently doing and can be done, and that‚Äôs all we want.
---
Great video but the music could be louder and even more obnoxious
---
I got that same email, but my account is still banned. What gives? Who can I talk to about that?
---
PvP has been the most neglected part of the game since release (Except maybe minigames?) Mental people get upset over this stuff. I stopped pking because it literally got no updates.
---
Also even when i've been in 100m+ gear, Bulwark is still broken.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even bother soloing it, it‚Äôs just a waste of time and supplies. You‚Äôre better off soloing saradomin
---
slayer is one of the worst skills in the game

That mounted glory goes well with the Steel 2h

Roses are red

Violets are blue

It don‚Äôt always be like that

But sometimes it do
---
Too detailed.
---
They look visually like they are same tier as justiciar or bandos but they are really just rune armor, better armors are more detailed and cool while worse armors are goofy looking.

He said 70+, not 70.

Thanks!!! That was quick
---
Iron deposits to the right of ardy.
---
&gt;Should we ban the wiki?
---
Not until the wiki automatically reads the puzzle and then instantly tells you how to solve it. I really don't see how you can view reading a guide on how to do something then having to figure it out and do it as the same thing as RL just telling you how to solve it with no input or learning required
---
My pleasure. :)
---
Release for RS3 too since they‚Äôre way more into buying 99s over there
---
Bro I just looked at your post history, your ironman is 33m total xp with a 60m bank... Making a maxed pure is harder than that...

I'm just surprised its only 30M

Would ruin the game even more, not too long ago there was a osrshd 3rd party client that people were using and some of them got banned for it but this would be horrible, very biased opinion though as I quit when they started adding all this bullshit into the game

Rc at 99: 1m/hr crafting nats in abyss
---
Slayer at 99: killing hydra for like 2.5-3.5m/hr
---
Its epitome of delayed gratification, when you've got a high enough slayer level it just becomes bossing with increased dps. More importantly, its far more engaging than running in circle to the bank and back
---
Watching sara brews drop in price because of this rn
---
i play runescape on a $120 chromebook that boots into a weird form of linux. im pretty sure osrs can run on a smart fridge if it can run on this Frankenlaptop.
---
Inventory space. Not worth it to keep ash always on inventory and not worth it to mine it always before doing composts. Too much hassle. Better to zulrah bank stuff and do it all in on go. On that its worth it to go all compost bins too.

welcome to the real world buddy, go hide in your hole again.

---
What in Runescape is actually varied then? Lmao.
---
I was in a similar position to you, I gave MM2 a go and it was just boring, so I've spent the last two weeks splashing at work and have gone from 92-99 magic lol.
---
That's Hans twin brother Bans. He's the successful one in the family.
---
Eh I feel like the whole point of slayer is to eventually get into boss slayer - after a few months of grinding out 99 slayer on mobile at work, I just do whatever boss equivalent there are to my tasks and it's honestly quite a bit of fun
---
I wish I had a dollar for every time I had to tell them to close the doors..
---
For what. The dude who posted this agreed with me. Also i met my wife on rs, not looking for someone elses
---
Yeah sorry mate. I don't really remember typing this comment I had some drinks. Kinda off the wagon unfortunately :(
---
They realize if they wanna be antisocial...there's an 'off' option for public chat...right?
---
You would be a rich person, no one ever closes them and then wonder why the void knight got killed
---
Yeah the issue is mainly that I can't get in contact with jagex
---
Well that's your personal opinion and I fully respect that you don't want anything of HD-remakes back. But some of us do, and I feel like there has to be an option for the community who has been asking for it quite often in the past already.
---
&gt;  People will spite vote PvP updates no matter what if they are not a PKer.
---
  
---
Because jagex keeps putting new PVE content in the wilderness and PKers already have massive advantages (optimal stats for the combat bracket, full inventory of brews, ancient magics, lv 3 wildy scouts, clannman mode, PJing) so nobody who wants to do PVM is ever going to vote to make it easier to die anymore than PKers would vote to have all pvp damage reduced by 50%.   
---
I've said this before and ill say it again, if jagex wants people to pvp they should promote things like LMS, have pvp training/tournament worlds, 1v1/2v2/3v3 etc arena brackets with rewards, enable XP locks/downscaling (say pay 100k to lock xp gain on a skill, 100k to resume it, some high cost like 1m+ to lock a skill at a lower level so you could change combat brackets or builds without re-rolling a new character) and other purely pvp options. Trying to lure walking sacks of gold into the wildy is never going to revive it, its really shitty design, and all it has done so far is cripple the ability to make "improvements" to PvP and update select content.
---
And my axe
---
Used the wrong word. Wasnt talking about that, it was the nonwpec 1t
---
MORE HOTPOCKETS!! LOL southpark wow episode
---
This makes me sad. Runescape is such an addictive game, don‚Äôt give a baby crack. I love it, but I know it‚Äôs bad for me.
---
Fiber optic line from heroes guild to POH.
---
More points
---
Tldr
---
The government was made to do certain things, and the things socialism wants it to do would be terrible under a single centralized entity. You think insurance is bad now?
---
Name one higher money maker than requires zero end game gear
---
You should always vote! But I understand being lazy and not wanting to lol, the thing to understand the way people typically vote on pvp content is ‚Äúis this going to make my life even .00001% harder if it does I‚Äôm voting no‚Äù ‚Äúdoes it make me enter wildy then no‚Äù, I swear every one has become too used to the new death mechanics and just wants this game to be as safe as possible, but just read the polls and figure out if it‚Äôs OP or not because at the end of the day pkers are fellow players so you have to respect them
---
Slayer is on average slower than even 1+1 lava runes, if you're doing both skills 'right' you won't reach even close to the same exp/hr as rune crafting.
---
95% on a new quest.  I love it.
---
loool love this
---
Someone just had a rough day in the wildy, didn‚Äôt they? :/
---
Not really, basically the OSRS reddit tries to shit on RS3 cause they dont want to think about how Runelite is basically a cheat/bot client that takes anyway any real challenge from the game and deflects to making content like this to try and make themselves feel better/superior. TBH I enjoy playing both games in tandem, both have their perks and the different gameplay styles are refreshing, also shared members on one account YEET
---
Only because they have a bigger team and more content. They have a lot of stuff I want/miss, like the finished goblin quest line, as well as the void knight quests and Mahjarrat questline.
---
Most of the stuff I want from that RS3 was released when it still resembled OSRS in terms of gameplay.
---
Why not
---
It should be no one gets the loot, that way there is less incentive to crash.
---
Wanna bet that bots wont visit that bank, ever
---
&gt; They need to train combat , and slayer is just a way of doing that 
---
Exactly.  If you're going to train combat anyway, you might as well make it a little varied and possibly profitable, and barring NMZ you basically either do Slayer or just pick a monster.  Might as well get started on the road to Cerberus early when it won't matter much anyway.
---
Damn!
---
Objective is to get 99 in every skill and finish every quest. In order to do so, you need your own tactics to make money. 'Nough said
---
Slayer &gt; NMZ before level 90+ with max gear for combat xp.
---
Pretty sure it is 2 scales every 3 shots...? 
---
Not sure if trolling though.
---
It is in some situations, and useful ones at that. Claw spec, c hally spec also I believe. Dragon hunter lance gains a max hit. That's also ignoring the future strength bonuses we'll get so it'll have an even bigger impact.
---
But it devalues my profit snake
---
I've used full black dhide and I hit low and less accurate. Full void hire 3 or 4 higher and hits more often. I'll take my chances and continue using void
---
Maybe OSRS could've had all that if the team didn't waste time making "Great Kourend".
---
This would actually be a great update. I remember having quit playing RS3 but was still around in the lobby to chat with the boys. 10/10 idea :thumbsup:
---
I feel you. Its my least favorite skill next to itself
---
He you can do the same thing with some tape on your monitor, or screen markers. So what
---
The chat makes it less of a grind. You get a few good chuckles and if you participate in the fun you almost forget you're playing a 15 year old game.
---
[here is the official page](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-fremennik-exiles?oldschool=1) No release date yet though.
---
Thank you
---
Good job cherry picking. The majority of players that wear these cosmetics do it ironically, most other players actually have some fun and really cool outfits. Nice try though.
---
Thank Saradomin for RuneLite‚Äôs scaling and GPU rendering options
---
Old school runescape started from a backup in 2007 when there was no HD, and 2004-2007 were the most popular golden days of runescape hence why they used it
---
Were you high when you posted this?
---
Plz help install imgur.
---
To 0?! Holy shit!
---
Try the SOA clan chat if you don‚Äôt get anyone here.
---
Dinh‚Äôs is the best attack  xp in the game.
---
And is still bulky af
---
Better than original.
---
Big mean pker man stands close? Protect melee.
---
Big mean pker man stands far? protect range!
---
Removed what? I haven't been playing recently. All bots were removed?
---
There's a bunch of questlines to look forward to! Desert/Menaphos, Mahjarrat/Lucien/Hazeel + void knight as you mentioned, slug questline, Fremmenik (obv coming now that this vote is done), Zanaris/Fairytale, and Dwarves all have unfinished storylines, and lines like Mory/Vampire, Devious Minds, Penguins, and a few others could potentially have extra quests added on to expand the lore as well. Outside of RFD I don't think Karamja has had a quest added since 2005.
---
Honestly I love new quest content, and they could add on to any of them and I'd be happy to do them
---
I wish Jagex would put scaling for that interface on the game by default. It would be perfect.
---
i could hear the pain when you typed ‚Äúso cute hah‚Äù i hope you get that little dude soon, going 4.5k dry has to hurt.
---
Google optimal quest guide osrs
---
No announcement I can find, however if you try and get a trial, you no longer can
---
I caught the sarcasm, I decided to place my reply here though because OP didn't explicitly talk about devaluing Zulrah.
---
Some people do legitimately say this.
---
Might be best to retrace your steps even further and open dialogue with previous npcs.
---
A "free" (lost cost) membership method botters were using has been removed
---
Magic accuracy on dhides is abysmal. You can test it yourself by simply playing a few lms games on world 317. Sometimes it's complete lottery who gets the first freeze and who splashes 5 times in a row. I think augury's magic defence buff is a big part of the problem as well.
---
Am I stupid?
---
Why fletch
---
It's all good dude. I think they're just not thinking through how they do stuff. 
---
I don't think that after the first entangle poll failed they had any intention of putting it into the game anyways. And they polled it again because people kept asking for it in Q&amp;A's. What we're looking at is an evolving viewpoint over time where they eventually realize it needs to be an integrity change. 
---
I think to solve this problem they should take a closer look at balanced that are being polled "for the health of the game" and decide if they need to be integrity changes right off the bat. I think that they *did* do this with the Bulwark which is a better way. Hopefully we will stop seeing this failed polling followed by ignoring them pattern in the future now.
---
Thats not even true. Ideally you'd do the lower levels in NMZ first then do Slayer after you're 85-90+ melees so you don't take forever to kill the high cb LVL tasks.
---
the dihns still tanks dude, who cares if it has 0 mage defence. obviously if you‚Äôre using dihns it‚Äôll be used with black d hide if you‚Äôre tryna tank.
---
Real ironmen standing alone and solo TOB instead of taking the easy way out /s
---
That takes me back to my first point that the serp helm comes from a boss and the new helm will not be from a boss.
---
well the droprate is 1/3k, so i‚Äôm really only 1500 dry which isn‚Äôt too bad. i‚Äôve seen pics of someone getting it at 16K kc so i guess it could get a lot worse
---
Hey mate, I‚Äôve just finished chinning and bursting to 99 range and mage, I think the most expensive part of bursting is the gear, having a kodai is a must, I lost track of how much I spent but I think all up it wouldn‚Äôt of been more than 20m ish
---
Now i see why you left it out.
---
Slayer is pretty fast at low levels, you get to 70 in maybe 20-30 hrs.
---
ignorance, i remember i didnt shut the door the first few times i played and everyone was flippin on me and i had no idea what i was doing wrong.
---
Terrible design and not oldschool at all. Oldschool way things were like abby demons, cave horrors etc. Locked behind high slayer level but once you get it you do it whenever the fuck you want.
---
Now you need a fucking task for a mob to be worth doing are u fkin kidding me, we didn't even vote this kind of design, it has never been polled.
---
pk with it if thats what you‚Äôre into.
---
Yeah, the PoH is probably one of the best updates to runescape. I remember spending hours at random house parties as a kid. I just really wish we had more creative ways to train construction.
---
Who cares. Zulrah came out like 4 years ago and the serp will still be incredibly powerful. It has defensive bonuses, protects from all poison/venom, and has the chance to envenom mobs, and its price is protected by the cost of scales. Not to mention that +1 doesn‚Äôt help in every PvM setup
---
Loneliness btw
---
Damn man, I‚Äôve heard of being over KC but that takes it, gl I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get it soon
---
Me setting up an alibi in case jagex suspects I rwt
---
I believe they said 6 weeks is what they're aiming for on one of the Q&amp;As, so 5 weeks from now or so.
---
They choose to limit themselves.
---
I did them all on mobile with similar stats. Arma was the only one that was a bit sketchy, but that was just due to me not having the timing down well. Just watch a solo guide for each of them and you should be fine.
---
You get it.
---
As long as the quest is "Sailing" ;)
---
I think my opinion may be a little biased but I think the little guy is pretty cute
---
There should be a 1/5k chance of this following you if you best someone in a POH boxing ring.
---
You didn't fully complete the dialog with a previous NPC.
---
Nah I need to hit my dank 360 no scopes on the level 5 goblins
---
Ancients entire spellbook doesn't have a teleblock. That's a tradeoff you're ignoring. It is and was the main selling point of normals
---
Okay, thats quite cool.
---
Honestly it would just ruin slayer for lower level players for a few weeks. Super annoying to roll up to Cockatrice or pyre fiends for them to be super crowded
---
Slayer is an awful way to train combat at low levels. The monsters are scuffed af until at least Cheldar but even then you'd rather wait until Nieve -&gt; Duradel.
---
NMZing until 85-90 melees then doing Slayer is considered the optimal way to train.
---
I won‚Äôt say they‚Äôre all exactly OP,  but they do allow you to play the game a lot more brain dead than you would with the vanilla client. You‚Äôre right in that a lot of plugins give access to information you can already have, but we also need to accept that people wouldn‚Äôt be using plugins if it weren‚Äôt benefitting them in some way. I think perhaps some of those more benign things ought to be implemented by jagex themselves (optimally, like stat orbs).  Some, however, are a bit OP though.
---
Lance doesn't gain a max hit in full str does it? Main things I saw was claws getting a max hit which is pretty minimal for a spec weapon like claws. But I thought lance in max gear was unaffected at olm?
---
I used to write slayer off thinking it was impossible for me to ever hit high slayer levels. once I got past 70 it became easily the most enjoyable skill for me. The slayer exp comes as a bonus to me now, as I‚Äôve used slayer to get 99 range, 95 strength, 99 hp, and 94 range. Sitting at close to 94 slayer now and it barely felt like a grind because there‚Äôs so much variance to the skill. Also helps out the bank a ton, haven‚Äôt sold much since 70 slayer and my slayer tabs now sitting at around 160m. 
---
Keep with slayer, once you hit your groove it‚Äôs worth it!
---
Theres consensus on every poll that isnt PvP. 95% of all polled questions pass. Thats pretty clear consensus that people default vote yes to everything.
---
lowkey hope nex gets added in the GWD expansion. Was a fun boss to kill
---
Pleased with this, I still would have liked to see use of the new helm locked behind the new quest, and even making the upgrade untradeable
---
Pretty anti dihns and tangle change, but lad these two aren‚Äôt contradictory at all lol
---
Instead of saying "I don't like it". Explain why. The devs aren't psychic.
---
You said all of that completely ignoring that I went over each of them in my comment lmfao
---
Wow this is great! Can we also get rid of the wildy, remove free trade, and create an ability based combat system that no one wants while we're at it?
---
what is Guthix's sinister personal agenda?
---
They likely didnt have the option to do this back then. Arguments like this are honestly just detrimental to the game and make no sense. By that logic slayer helm shouldnt be imbueable, neither should rings, we shouldnt have Priff. Just because it didn‚Äôt exist in 2007 doesnt automatically mean its not old school. Thats a cop out when you have no valid reason other than you don‚Äôt like something. The ONLY thing you said that was even reasonable was that we didn‚Äôt vote on it. That said, i like this design far more than every person having an basilisk knight alt.
---
So you mean to tell me that if I train one slow skill efficiently and one slightly less slow skill inefficiently... the first one is faster? Whaaaaa???
---
Lmfao.
---
pretty much this, only do afk task and sometimes actually play for good money tasks
---
Pfft say that to me in the wildy nub
---
And the helm before serp came from an intermediate quest. A helm that's still used currently due to negatives of serp in raids. And serp will still compete with a modern release helmet in melee gear focused stuff, as the faceguard will occupy hybrid / tribrid pvm / PvP. 
---
Zulrah doesn't have to offer 3 amazing drops for the rest of OSRS existence btw
---
Lmao! Love this
---
Its likely 1/1k or 1/2k like the wyrm/hydra drops. Off task its probably 5-10x as rare
---
Because everyone wants to use the qol themselves, but a lot of people don't want other people to have them.
---
Congrats man!
---
The regular gem mine is so godawful that it's worth the time compared to trying to fight the bots at the regular gem mine. If all the other reqs are done, and I'm just trying to get some red topaz, I'd much rather grind out a gout tuber than deal with the gem mine.
---
It needed to be removed.
---
People were exploiting it.
---
Real talk tho, this is so that it isn‚Äôt inside armors, right?
---
This is rs3 isn't it?
---
If it was so overpowered, then why was it so cheap? High demand would make it more expensive
---
Yes, future content will be more work. There is no getting around that. Also, items already in game that dont have HD assets all need to be created. (Ie. serp helms, blowpipes, pets, etc). So there is a significant amount of work to be done, no question about that. 
---
We need to be honest to ourselves though. Many might not care about the HD graphics and would rather the extra time spent be used for more content, but content alone is not going to get us more players, only maintain the current base. There is no doubt Jagex wants more players on oldschool. Back in the hayday we had 1k+ in every single world. World 1 and 2 were always maxed out and you would need to keep attempting login to get in. Our inferior graphics are holding us back from appealing to a newer generation of gamers.
---
Well do the PKers want to attack these people or not?
---
Your arguments aren't consistent with each other. You implied in previous comments that real PKers don't even want to fight these people, yet in this comment you seem to imply that it should be a priority of Jagex to make PKers want to kill the skillers.
---
What it really is, is a method of PKing is made easier with the Bulwark nerf and you want to maintain that, so you reach for other poor arguments to protect your meal ticket.
---
Context aside who tf took the time to take that 3rd pic?

49KC.....
---
Yes Objectively better, pal. Since when does humor have to do with better quests? 
---
"As a person that looks to have a laugh now and then and doesnt care for the cool factor, this isnt better. Subjectivity and all." 
---
RuneScape isn't a comedy game for your information. It's a medival HEAVY fantasy MMORPG, if it has some comedic content that is by the discretion of Jagex.
---
For your information, the newer quests do have comedic dialogues it seems like you haven't played the game.
---
Sailing + dungeoneering is something I could get behind ngl. Enough of this item/gold sink bs tho, we are good for gold sinks and no construction items need sinking/
---
Who am I? You sure you want to know?
---
Go pk a runecrafter and type ‚Äúsit‚Äù
---
Maybe you have turned off the sound in the settings called runelite?
---
I disagree, but you're right that it's not *that* important.  Definitely the least useful of the ones I listed if OP wants to skip it.
---
Also agreed, if you're going to get close anyway, it's worth going all the way to the Quest Cape.  I'm only two quests out myself and it's a great way to guide yourself through some interesting content you didn't know you were missing.
---
How the fuck can you see... oh, heh.
---
Most people do it just for the FPS increase or in CSGO a lot of pros have Been playing with the same res for years and have no reason to change it
---
Am I the only one that feels like iron man mode is killing RuneScape?
---
true
---
Where‚Äôs the bird tho?
---
Cabbage skill was the best
---
Yup for botting accounts lol
---
I started old school recently for nostalgia. I went from 65-70 attack just in the warriors guild getting defenders.. a 1/50 drop.. best but is I‚Äôm not even disappointed and I‚Äôm still going strong
---
That's dumb
---
If you skip 1 meal you can have membership for a month.
---
It wasnt really that small back in 07. Our screens had low resolutions so that small box took up a large amount of the screen
---
It really doesn't though, RuneLite offers so many QoL things that would never make it into RS3, such as the clue solver stuff.
---
That is really bad luck and i'm sorry you've not had any yet. 
---
It really does go both ways, I posted a picture a few weeks back of every single drop from Wintertodt in about 300 crates, but on my main super unlucky.
---
2000kc later...
---
Hard disagree. Wilderness altar is 10/10 worth it. I lost maybe one inv of bones from 72-80. Saved 5m overall.
---
its optimal, but its not fun. low level slayer isnt always the best, but at least its varied and youre vaguely playing attention. if a new player asks for advice then you should absolutely not say "oh do a shitonne of quests, get 4m for dharoks and afk for 50 hours, have fun"
---
In what way? I think it's quite the opposite, ironman accounts actually makes Runescape more active (lots and lots of people would've probably quit by now if they just had their main account).
---
Oh yeah, that's the one I've been using. Thanks for the help though
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/NJCG1IH.png](https://i.imgur.com/NJCG1IH.png) 
---
For added clarification, the one I'm trying to figure out how to do involves luring it behind this rock - it seems you have to stand in multicombat for this one but you don't need to keep prayer on for any of the kill once the lure is successful.
---
You gave gp away for free, this is what RWT looks like to Jagex, thus why they banned you for it.    
---
    
---
You might however be able to prove that you gave it for free because they are your friends, especially if they've been on your in game friend list for a long time
---
Or they can use ahrims/ancestrial or better mage weapons. Instead they want to be able to freeze while holding whip/crossbow / other non magic weapon and offhand
---
Disagree with what? It being cancerous or not having to use keys?
---
How are u raiding :S. The xeric and tob regular drops easily cover supply costs with profit, unless ur wiping every other raid
---
Hahaha
---
So most pkers play in this tiny window size? How can they see anything?
---
Yes
---
Found in south Florida! Wasn‚Äôt swampletics himself.
---
He's not silly, it's all the heroin!
---
I have over 50m rc exp but I used alts and paid runners at lava.
---
Indeed you can. But if you have ever looked through the project structure you will see its not all open source.... Some parts are closed source and prebuilt for you.
---
I remember reading about all the stuff related to Nex.  All those sweet Zaros drops.  Zaros Zeitgeist.   And the first time voices were EVER in Runescape.  It was insane at the time.
---
Slayer is garbage. Everyone rips on new skills be proposed, or older one's like Dungeoneering not being "real skills", but Slayer is literally just "Go kill this thing" it's just fucking training melee/range/magic with random restrictions.
---
With their eyes
---
DAE PKers bad???
---
Both of these are valid points and not even contradictory if anything they go hand in hand
---
Hey man best of luck, If you have the option I would go for membs right away since you have to quest your attack XP and the training/money making methods are quite faster
---
Im A Shelby &lt;‚Äî‚Äî user
---
I feel like 1500 total is more reasonable maybe higher
---
You're training combat intentionally inefficiently and being given XP in a pointless skill in exchange for doing so...  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Slayer could not exist at all without the game looking any different content wise.
---
Well, the last comment ain't wrong...
---
Ok well he also said theres pictures on the wiki. You didn‚Äôt need to add that you‚Äôre stupid and don‚Äôt have runelite
---
Rs3- 83
---
Osrs- 36
---
It could be good if some of the issues with it were fixed.
---
50 att/str is about where my account is at. I kept getting these awful tasks that were taking ages and giving me worse exp/gold than if I was literally just killing chickens in lumbridge and picking up feathers.
---
Some of those mid-level slayer tasks are really horrendous. I ditched it and picked up farming in between quests and it was definitely a good choice. Within a week I made enough through farming to sustain my bond, starting from scratch and knowing nothing about farming. In 15 hours of slayer I think I was at a net loss from food and pots, and I still don't have any slayer points because I kept having to downgrade from awful tasks.
---
Wait y‚Äôall don‚Äôt play like this regularly?
---
please dont do jagex's work for them, no need to defend their stupidity
---
If you assume 99 Melees then it's pretty easy to hit 20 hrs because 70 Slayer is only ~700k XP, and you can get 30-35k Slayer XP/hr just by meleeing every task other than Metal Dragons, with a Cannon it's obvious that you can get 70 Slayer in 20 hrs.
---
This is Nieve's task list at level 1 Slayer: https://i.imgur.com/D2bj148.png, on an suboptimal list that assumes you have 0 points, doesn't assume you use Craw's Bow, and still does suboptimal tasks for a high point ratio in order to get points for Blocks/Skips, you're still able to maintain 50k xp/hr long term.
---
Synq on YouTube has a great guide. Highly recommend checking it out
---
*laughs in runelite*
---
H
---
In RS3 you can literally press a button to drop your entire inventory and continue an action while dropping
---
Then why did they poll it?
---
But that sucks to then. There's no reason the same bosses couldn't exist without Slayer.
---
You want synqs guide as mentioned. It explains everything perfectly.
---
Lavas is more than 66K/Hour.
---
Higher lvls are even worse but bossing is ok if you like it
---
It literally looks like a 5th grader's concept art from 2005. And why tf did we need ANOTHER set of ornamental rune armor? How many are there atm?

fuck me we need another one with more purple shit on it NOW!
---
Numbers are from wiki.
---
Is that dude jizzing all over the horse ?
---
&gt;By that logic slayer helm shouldnt be imbueable, neither should rings, we shouldnt have Priff. 
---
this but unironically
---
Had the same issue. I think resizeable mode was the best QOL update that's came out other than maybe Mobile.
---
wait he made another account? why tho
---
It really is just personal, I think the cugdel is a real eye sore while the rest is quite ok.
---
Zulcano also gives very little rc xp if you have to get close to a small number.
---
Gratz! 14mil no pet here :(
---
I'm at 78 right now spicy stew boosting for frem elite. Once I kill that spiritual mage I may grind it up for base 80s, but after that I'm not gonna touch it for a looong time.
---
What if we stopped making differences in combat between PVM and PVP.
---
My dude I scammed since osrs came out my guy and a little before eoc
---
Yeah, jagex doesn't need to do anything now since runelite patched the problem.

You kinda have to explain more if you are going to claim something big like this.

99 √∑ 2 = 92
---
No, there should be an integer option under ‚ÄúStretched mode‚Äù that‚Äôll fix it
---
*mild confusion*
---
Integer scaling

also gives you bigger area to hit. it doesnt matter, it just depends on the speed of your mouse, and how far away your monitor is.

Maniacal Monkeys are decent XP and definitely mobile-friendly. I think you need to have completed MM2, or at least defeated Kruk.

That's what I'm asking!!!! Wth
---
Mine didnt have that :I rip
---
Yay it passed. I will pay for mems again once its out :)
---
But like, I dont get it. Just dont give the kid stuff? I was going to give the first guy a dragon pick because I wanted to see where is was going. I was turned off by him NEEDING it to be noted. What kind of person is going to feel the pressure to keep going to their bank and grabbing things for the scammer? Pretty sure both times they were mid lvl 40s like you said.

I don't understand how you can use npc contact to talk with him when time passes differently in the abyss,surely he'd be listening to you speak extremely fast.The lore states that he doesn't even get fed in the abyss because time passes so slowly there,the poor guy must just be getting permanently contacted from his perspective.

Rigour first without a doubt. Single most broken upgrade in the game tbh
---
as someone who mainly plays runescape for questing, i highly doubt that's an actual reason, my only gripe with osrs is having so few quests compared to rs3, in the same time frame we should have had at least 30 more quests in osrs, but the mods aren't a fan of "one use" content, so quest junkies like me end up on the side of other more important content.
---
Why did they poll changing the D Spear Stun Lock? A lot of the polls were done years ago by staff that are no longer on the OSRS Team. The current OSRS Team might have repolled it based on player requests, but ultimately they decided it fell under balancing. I'm sure if they could have, they would have made those changes without ever polling them but just because they mess up and poll something that doesn't mean it should be off the table for them to fix, like with D Spears.
---
I zoomed in to the screen like how the hell can you see him wearing a lumberjack outfit...
---
Imagine abusing your child.
---
Don‚Äôt let Jagex see this thread. They‚Äôll think Slayer needs to be buffed and make another 5 content updates for it before Christmas.
---
Usually the better one is used by people with bigger banks as it is more expensive risk usually with craws bow + ether and pray pots, maybe even blessed dhide
---
78 unlocked the Iowerth Dungeon one
---
nezzy helm isnt bis, serp is. and serp is much more balanced since it has a significant cost to use, so people dont always just automatically pick the absolute BIS, they balance the cost/benefit and often times end up picking nezzy
---
new helm makes gameplay more shallow rather than richer
---
Imagine taking the time to write that shit post comment of yours, do I need to grab a baby bottle for you
---
Im not sure I fully understand what going on. I see the quick cuts to him hiding his spec bar but what this doing? does the plugin see the spec on his opponent's weapons?
---
I think the main problem is that - while OSRS players don't really like EOC, the original combat system has a huge flaw in that you can just melee in basically full ranged gear, which is kinda meme-y. 
---
Also, black d'hides melee defences (in my opinion) are a bit high for being ranged gear.
---
You shouldn't expect to catch a freeze very easily on a guy with 99 magic in full ranged gear - but he shouldn't expect to just whip out a 75 AGS in practically full ranged gear either.
---
(Basically, wearing the wrong combat-triangle armour should affect your accuracy when it comes to D'hide, and meleeing in Karil's, in my opinion ...)
---
At the same time - tons of melee/hybrid based gear has some joke stats too.
---
If you're in full rune, someone trying to barrage you - especially if they're in literally full endgame gear - should VERY RARELY miss. (Rip Amenity's Edgeville PKing luck)
---
Anyway, that's just the way I see it / why I don't get why people like PKing in OSRS.
---
Especially with the whole AGS a 70 into an instant 40 G-maul and then you're just dead. Not very exciting to me - but ehh.
---
Yes that is generally the type of person they target
---
Nah, its bis for def pure training boy
---
the helmet is especially ugly
---
So on a normal client, a weapon does not have a special attack bar if it doesn‚Äôt have a special attack. These clients make it so all weapons have a special attack bar so that they can one tick spec from a weapon that doesn‚Äôt have a spec bar. Usually there is a slight delay before the spec bar appears when changing weapons.
---
This one and the Khazari Jungle ones are the bane of my existence. I willing to put up with more annoying shit for elites/masters (looking at you, Dragon's Eye), but for a Hard, there's not really any reason to make it this annoying.
---
I'll look in to it, thank you.
---
The helm doesn't come from the quest, the quest just blocks the ability to get it from basilisk knights.
---
Plenty of top BIS items pre-raids came from things that were not difficult. Black mask comes from a level 80 monster, DWH comes from a level 150, barrows gloves just requires some basic questing, and dragon defender is just from level 100 cyclops.
---
This is more akin to zenyte jewelry than anything, and unless the drop rate is extremely common, or the basilisk knight drop table is overpowered, I don't see people stopping Zulrah to do this any time soon.
---
that's the wrong demographic, these players still basically emulate the way they used to play as a child which equates to hardly and skill advancements compared to time played
---
they're having the most fun though, right..?
---
Look at it like
---
1- bulwark Nerf
---
2- black d'hide nerf
---
Pkers use black d'hide as well so they won't need that, and bulwark isn't risked so they don't really care about price, but want it nerfed...
---
Not the best template for this. But it still gets the point mostly across
---
Yeah the house is super convienent and I really want more stuff in it, but training just puts me to sleep. I have the planks and everything for it but it's click intensive enough that you can't really zone out whilst doing it like you can with AGI courses or ZMI RC.
---
With Slayer you get to change up what you're doing every few hours with different tasks sending you to different places (and potentially training different styles of combat), but Cons just seems like a bank-standing skill without the benefit of an actual bank.
---
It'd be nice if there was a hybrid training method, even changing the Crafting XP from Shades of Mort'ton to Construction XP would be on theme and a nice little bonus.
---
Ok so you literally ignored half my post good to know that there's no point discussing any further with you. Basilisk Knights are a tier 60 slayer monster, they absolutely won't be as hard as zulrah and if you think they will be youre delusional.
---
Those firelighters are booming
---
yes i agree and somehow i don't think it will be the hit they think it will because i think people are going to get sick of having to keep restarting the game over and over everytime they get too big for their boots and start forcing stuff in
---
People default vote yes to everything? No, that‚Äôs not true at all. There for sure is a small group probably that would vote yes to any new content but it‚Äôs certainly not a large group of players. It only takes 26% of people to not like something to overrule 74% of players voting in favor anyways and on the flip side there are for sure a small group that vote no to everything as well.
---

they already added a shortcut to make getting into the jungle dead simple... it doesnt take more than 45 seconds to get to any khzari jungle hard clues
---
To me, it's not at the bottom because it's always useful. Firemaking? Nah. Theiving? Nah. Sure, most people buy 99% of the stuff you get from smithing/fletching/herblore/crafting/runecrafting instead of making it themselves, but it is nice to have something tangible to show for it.

Oh those armor looks bad, like really really bad.

---
Yeah legit wasn't trolling I thought you meant tiers like each tier being a new level, like wow raids etc. Why do people call it tiers instead of just calling it lvl now?
---
Better for PKing because your important menus (attack style, inventory, prayer, spellbook) are in a fixed, compressed, and non-overlapping location relative to the actual screen where you and your opponent are. 
---
And obviously if it‚Äôs stretched (aka bigger on screen) then you‚Äôll be more precise with clicks and switches. Think of it as how some people prefer to play competitive FPS at low+stretched resolutions.
---
There‚Äôs a setting where you can set the value of items you want to drop without receiving a chat box notification that you‚Äôre dropping something valuable. It also works with untradeables.
---
It's all ogre now

Is someone gonna tell him about resizeable?

Fuck you. Games are supposed to evolve with time. Bring in the loot boxes and make this shit a game worth of beingnactive in 2019 ^^^/s
---
I think with the DFS i got it because of the str and defence bonuses, would a defender be a better option because of its useful attack bonuses?
---
No i just tried it last night, it pixelates the interface way too much.
---
They're probably stretching the videos to 1080x720 resolution to fill in the black bars. I highly doubt that they actually play the game stretched.
---
Text book narcissism. You should get help mate, at least try to learn to act like a normal person.
---
What are ya talking about, it requires 40 defence
---
Seren is definitely harder than the archer. The archer turns  your prayer off, just turn it back on. He also has the explosive arrow, move over 1 square. You can beat him without getting hurt.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY N01s Perfect!

So they want to make it look like cash ain't no big deal? They let you hold their sword for a few minutes, then ask to borrow your fury then frick off?  I mean I guess that could work. It damn near worked on me the first time around.

No no no... it's obvious. Just make questing a skill!

It‚Äôs no more diverse than any other skills, only feels that way because you‚Äôre forced into having a diverse experience with it.

You can easily make any other skill as diverse as you want. Go chop teaks at hardwood grove for an hour, hop on down to sulliusceps, go kill some ents, chop yews at the guild.

The genre of the game still isn't "Comedy" it may have it's moments but it doesn't mean it's a Comedy game.

I did lizards and honestly didn't find them too bad on mobile I did them until I could get into falconry. Falconry isn't too bad on mobile either camping out two spawn points. For lizards you can use the one tap drop for them in case you didn't know.

Eh what you think is meaningless to me and I use to scam scammers,Venezuelans, lurers, and just regular people. I made it a living and I enjoyed finding ways to lure and scam and mostly just trick people into giving virtual money to me. It was a fun hobby plus a good side business
---
I just didn't understand what was happening. If he was literally asking you for money to stop following you world to world and doing this to you then screen shot and maybe even get video proof of it. send it to tipoff@jagex.com in an email. That's where they deal with raggers/ griefers and he is griefing if he is actually following you world to world. It's hard to get a response about it but also report him in game for disruptive behavior every time he follows you. Sucks that people spend their time trying to upset others when we all play games to escape reality and have some fun. Hopefully it gets settled.
---
The title made is pretty obvious with the amulet of btwspeak

Yeah can't get that cause the quest line also takes us out of Kandarin

Thanks man! just hit 1k subs :)

Believe the wooooosher has been woooshed

Oh, I think it requires the quest to be able to equip it though. Much like the previous quest but what with it being a monster drop it‚Äôll be quite costly.

Pumped for the quest, I think the reward is terrible though. The ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù of grinding out for a tradeable by killing basilisks, I know the team is more creative than this.
---
Hey, that‚Äôs pretty good
---
This one isn't as basic as the last one so we won't be seeing 1000 different versions of it in one day, which is good.
---
If that's true, then I'm good with it. :)
---
With the upper level the veins work on a timer. You can have 100 people mining one spot and it wont make a difference. I think it was made like this so being packed wouldn't effect it.
---
yeah they're dumb it looks horrible
---
In RS3, at some point, Jagex decided that Bronze and Iron having the same reqs was kinda stupid, so iron took steel's level and stats, steel took black's, black took mithril's, etc. all the way up to rune becoming level 50.
---
Hello fellas  im a dedicated door closer.   too bad i finshed getting my void last week.      i would stand by the door and open and close it like an automatic door at the grocery store.   the little stragglers that exit the boat late  i would open the gate in their face and shut it on their ass cheecks after they got through  one by one to really drive home the point.

Everyone was so anal about closing the doors when I got my elite almost 2 years ago. Went back on my pure and what a shitfest it was. Doors left wide open, the void knight getting stacked out, Bandos+obsidian cape guys etc.

Damn 3 tbow accounts is my dream, where all do you use em?

I think it really depends on whether or not you go by combat exp or total exp, but generally it seems like at 90s combats and 80 slayer, i liked to nmz during my afk hours (studying, sleeping, watching movies or casually hanging out with a friend) while during active hours i liked to slay. Generally the general pattern seems to be.
---
NMZ Active: (Dharoks, power surge, 90-97 hp with preserve and super combats (more afk)  
---
110k-130k Str exp a hour from dharoks + 20k-30k exp a hour from power surging dclaws with piety flicks. 130k-160k active melee exp a hour + 40k-50k hp exp. 170k-210k total exp
---
Slayer: 160-200k average total exp a hour for single target cannonables with 80-100k melee exp, 30k-40k slayer exp a hour single target cannonables with 25k range exp a hour from cannon and 30k hp exp.
---
Bloodvelds at zeah:  Dharok level EXP rates with a slay helm, high hp, pretty afk. 130k melee exp a hour + 30-40k Slay exp a hour and pretty afk. Always debated wondering if save or skip. Not overly profitable but super afk slayer exp with really good melee exp from high health / slay helm bonus and blood rune drops. Ussually break even with slight profit using piety and prot from melee on them with proselyte.
---
I like my normie main only because I CAN play him like an iron when I want and also still have access to faster training methods/ge if I desire. No one tells you how to play your account no matter what kind it is :) Just do what you enjoy!
---
Check on the runescape forums. I just joined a clan on there! Plenty to choose from
---
&gt;possibly a diary
---
No more of that please, agility is already useless enough.
---
Untradeables stay on the floor for 3 minutes when dropped, you can hop worlds to collect them back. The timer must've ran out before you got back to it
---
I'm sure they will be more in the spotlight now, but especially at lower combats, I've found obby maulers to be amazing and dominating, especially in BH.  9/10 of my deaths until around 55-60 combat were to obby maulers  It almost made me make an obby mauler lol.

You frequent a runescape subreddit.
---
What's this post and your joke have in common?
---
Both sad.
---
Probably don't need to wait all the wait all the way until base 90s, but I would wait till your bank is a bit bigger. Leaving yourself with 10mil is definitely too low.
---
On what planet is nezzy bis for melee?
---
Unlucky. But hey, cyclopes are great xp so dont worry youll get it soon ;)
---
100 kc jar :(
---
Pointless actually.
---
What the hell?
---
If you've done everything, sure. The rest of runescape is just grinding it out. You can do that slowly over time while having fun on the Ironman.
---
However if you've still not experienced most things on the game, it's worth doing those before starting an Ironman. For example, bossing solo and group bossing, raids 1 and 2, all quests, minigames at high combat, a few of each clues, etc. Lots of things to experience in the game for main accounts.
---
Once you're done with the main stuff and the rest of just grinding for higher levels, that is when I would personally make an Ironman.
---
I think everyone is waiting to see what happens and what the new meta is.basically the 1def/1pray build is dead and the 13pray build is also dead right now. So everyone is waiting before they change their accounts.
---
what language is this?
---
If you total bank is only worth 45m I wouldn't get 83 cons right now. If you have good gear and a 45m cash stack then probably. Either way I'd focus on solid gear before worrying about cons. You can always use the bh world and go to whoevers house is hosting. Slightly less convenient but gets the job done.
---
Serp helm has a 100% chance to venom with blowpipe. Its still very very good
---
Good to know, thanks :)
---
Sure but you still have to get the Slayer level for the good tasks in the first place.  Unless you just never plan to do Slayer at all.  You can NMZ to the stats to do Slayer with, but you're doing the same Slayer tasks one way or another.
---
But that's my point anyway.  NMZ isn't an alternative to Slayer, unless your only objective is EXP.
---
you die in real life
---
You most likely prayed at the nature altar or something similar and forgot that you did. Happens to me a lot
---
Said you wanted pet, but okay
---
Do we know that the Basilisk Knight we fight in the quest has the same stats as the ones that drop the jaw?  The ones after the quest could be harder.
---
Or Reddit
---
Yeah, you're unlucky. I got mine in a few hours I think.
---
That doesn't help me, looks the same
---
Take my downvote.
---
Wait till you have a solid bank first so 83 con won‚Äôt break the bank. You can always use w330 so it‚Äôs not that big of an issue to not have it yourself. It‚Äôs just a convenience to have
---
There are very few places venom is actually viable anymore so that isn't really a redeeming factor.
---
 That‚Äôs why I stopped wasting my time there. Vorkath is way better
---
I don't PvP and I play the game to enjoy it not to get the optimal XP per hour and stuff like that so to me having the game at full size is a must

You say useless, but they're part of one of my favorite [fashionscapes](https://i.redd.it/vf0gmvn18ce31.png).

Absolutely. There was between 10-30 people at any given time.

Nailed it
---
So the issue isn't with one tap drop or how long unreadable stay on the ground. The issue was your lack of using the available safeguards to prevent such things from happening.
---
Tldr: incompetency issue not game.
---
That‚Äôs fine, I can try and find one and see if that fixes it. Thank you.
---
Great insight.
---
Was this one recent?
---
Lol the original post people were saying was trash yesterday. I thought it was pretty funny so I‚Äôm glad the repost is getting some attention.
---
Oh what you mean actually change my screen resolution? Yeah that's not really a solution I want to use
---
looks like a loli in this one, yes FBI this comment right here.
---
Wow wildy is extra dead now. People are better off just getting 60 attack for dds Gmaul stacking
---
Why many word when few do trick
---
Alright. I am indeed using the bh world for things like demonic gorillas, clues, zulrah, etc.
---
Yeah I will get my combat stats up along with slayer so I can make more money, once I got all of the gear I need   then will I start building my cashstack up to 40m to start the cons grind. Thank you!
---
*Cries in MacBook Pro*

You do realize that just because there are a boatload of extensions for something, it doesn‚Äôt mean that every player uses them? I‚Äôve seen plenty of people rave about RL while refusing to use certain plug-ins that make the game even easier.

This is the rng we need in life.
---
Efficient runecraft is well over 100k xp/hr. Ranged is well over 1m xp/hr, and melees are ridiculously high, while mage is 0 time. Slayer xp/hr doesn't come close to runecraft rates.
---
buncha pussies
---
+1 to it just being rng! I have got two full in a single task as well, and I have got none in a full task just happens.  As for normal I would say average I get like 1-2 pieces a task, so I would say you a lucky guy be proud man!
---
i've been doing solo corp too, only 170 kc so way far behind you. Can you give me some explanations why people bring warrior helm and barrows/ferocius gloves while still wearing voids?
---
Good point about black chins, still pretty niche overall though now. May not add a max hit not, but will contribute to it when the next strength increase item comes out just a bit quicker.

You made a living out of it ahahahahah
---
My bank would like to have a word with you. My friend hit 99 rc and I hit 99 slayer and have almost double his bank value
---
What is this from?
---
Pretty shit joke.
---
Can't be a bug. Nothing in the game would cause something like this unless you did some action that boosted your prayer by +2. Why didn't it happen to me as well if it happened to YOUR friend as well? You must've forgotten about the action. That is the only possible explanation
---
Why doesn't this have a Lavine response on why it's actually good and how people would pay to watch this?
---
Your post history says otherwise.

That and OSRS has a unique, charming, and aesthetically pleasing art style. That can often make up for the low technical quality.

Omg thats exactly how i started playing back then in 02! Used up all the allocated time and had to steal my moms library card to continue playing. Boy was I scared of getting caught.

It's still something. Level 50 may not be very much xp but leveling up from 1-50 is so slow. It's definitely a decent chunk of the grind.

i think inferno is possible with crossbows.

What about iOS?

No. It won‚Äôt. At least not solos.

Eh, what are some sweaty nerds on reddit going to do?

I've been afking combat on my main and raining hell on f2p noobs in the pvp worlds on low lvl mage alts. Basically all you can do on mobile is afk one char while the other does something.
---
Go for all elite diaries. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing and it‚Äôs really kept me motivated to skill
---
Probably do the good xp quests, then train all the skills that are 100x easier/ faster on membs, blast furnace for smithing, winterdodt for fm, crafting through dhides/ bstaffs and prayer then spend the rest of the time training agility and runecraft as much as possible
---
Decent for Raids 1
---
Must have been more than that. I got a plate and swapped for yellow phat and some cash on release. That was like 1.5b.
---
Just for clarity, I think it's better to use obsidian armour set with b nec and sword. Unless you have 95+ HP.
---
Which is like 6m. Have less fun. Yay!
---
And, did the bot detection caught up yet, or haven't you used this plugin?
---
No clue honestly.  Have to see if they have a app that clones other apps like osrs, some apps also have difficulty since osrs is 64bit. And ios is notoriously bad with allowing apps into the store.
---
Noob don‚Äôt use yellow on white
---
I'm fine with an upgraded nezzi but not a helm that literally outclasses everything by a longshot.  It should have had the same +str as a serp and a +1/2 pray, those stats would still make it a bis helm.

For real the amount of people that crash me without even trying.

Just last night some dude ran into Kurasks room with me and other people already there and immediately started fighting. Even told him there‚Äôs a separate room for on slayer task kurasks and he‚Äôd have more options there. 
---
He simply said ‚Äúyep that room is there. And yes I‚Äôm on task‚Äù then continued crashing
---
But theres literally a quest in rs3 where you ha e to kill him. Im pretty sure rs3 team knows yelps was a terrible thing
---
damn yall got skillets?
---
I believe they said that it was 5-6 weeks out recently if it passed polls(which it did)
---
Wrong. Maybe 80% of casuals. The long time players know this game already has too much content. Don‚Äôt ask for more unless you can show me a screenshot of your maxed account with completion status.
---
ehh, not really convinced it would have a large pvp impact. with a 40 def requirement on dhide boots, i'm sure most zerks, 70/75def, mains, would still prefer climbing boots or dragon boots because they don't come with the insane -magic penalties that +range boots have. mostly seems like it would affect range-only based pking

It is YOUR logic. YOU said it is just a videogame anyway. Consqeuently, it is just pixelmoney, therefore no reason for you to screw them over. THEY probably value it as they value the game.

And probably so do you, but you use some ego defense mechanisms to convince yourself that after all you are not a bad person, because that is something your ego can't take. Either that, or you are just extremely dumb. Or maybe both, who knows.

On my main I did some alching while I did agility to make it a bit less mind numbing. When I really wanted to push for level 70 I did some tele-alching with the Camelot tele. After 70 it is really hard to beat bursting slayer monsters. 
---
On my iron I did some heavily afk fire striking blue dragons. The xp/hr was obviously terrible but it was great to do on mobile while doing other things.
---
You must be new here
---
Probably 90-92 for most skills if not all. The exp requirement grows exponentially but exp/h doesn‚Äôt, plus (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) I don‚Äôt think there are any skills where the max or near-max efficiency training methods aren‚Äôt available before 92.

That said, I could be totally off the mark,

I'm unsure on the viability of your idea specifically, but the idea of a skill being locked behind a particular total level seems a good idea in itself.

If you have decent combat stats its really easy. Even with low stats rs has evolved so much that it shouldnt be hard. Just eat food so u dont die and the rest is just waiting for rng to finish the fights for you

Theres a Stargate episode that shows time distortion from gravity fairly well.

Say there's a time bubble where time is slower inside you go in and live your life. Looking outside you watch a jogger, and it looks like he's sprinting for dear life. After a day, you walk outside and find out a week has passed, because time outside is going faster relative to you.

This way it can appear to the outside world you haven't eaten in a week, when really you've been going about your day just fine.

What's with the caveman only thing then? I'm not flaming I'm just curious. I'm not familiar with the (I'm guessing) series

Probably because people get the glasses thing from They Live mixed up with this scene from Spiderman. In They Live the sunglasses allow the protagonist to see hidden messaging behind ads and things.
---
Ancestral has shit def tho, maybe we could get the first mage armour with decent defence. Yeah before adding pernix they should nerf bp/tbow
---
I say do slayer but only with magic! Get 99 magic and a pretty high slayer level too!
---
Don't worry he changed it to African American now so it's all good
---
I still remember getting 30gp as a win.
---
While this would probably mitigate some Slayer bots those aren't the bots that are doing real damage to the economy and most players wouldn't support an arbitrary requirement like this.
---
We need a better general solution for botting, and honestly I think it involves more community effort (e.g. fletching at zulrah and reporting bots) and overall better bot detection on Jagex's part.
---
If you ask a child what it wants for dinner 5 times, and it asks for a plate of tomato ketchup 5 times, you don't give the child a plate of tomato ketchup. Sometimes jagex need to take control and change things for the greater good, and due to the amount of 'spite' voting against pvp updates, I support this.

Getting 69 total right away is a must.

A bit of punctuation (which is common in most languages) would've gone a decent way.

It‚Äôs suppose to the slash version of the rapier. Both the rapier and the sword are niche items with slightly (1 max hit) above their previous bis slots.

Thanks, makes me appreciate my RNG after all lol
---
&gt; There is absolutely no incentive to train those two skills since by the time you get them high enough to make top tier gear, your combat levels is way past the need for it.
---
why do you need an incentive to train them? its a video game, do what you find fun. the fact that theres no incentive to train them is a good thing, that means you dont have to spends 10s/100s of hours doing a skill you hate just to unlock something to do the content you do want.
---
I trained those skills to 99 for the personal satisfaction of getting 99, not for some reward. the fact that theres a max cape with such dumb op perks is a bad thing
---
Just playing, good start. Do all the f2p quests then decide if you want to get members or keep training in f2p
---
Imagine being this wrong
---
Better off just going to twisted bow/scythe. Both the sword and rapier are not really worth the price to own considering at most your getting 1 max hit over a tent whip in the first place.
---
Well it's a snake, it won't drop dragonhide, don't you think?

That is what happened here
---
nah you gotta leave something for the commenters

I actually kind of enjoyed red chins in the private western provinces area. I did 70-80 over about a week on mostly mobile without 3T'ing however someone made a post about how easy it is to 3T chins on mobile.

Same time. Gotten it 6x. Last one was from an avantoe :)
---
So let me get this straight, you want to train to 99 mining because you want the satisfaction of having 99 mining and that is okay. But I enjoy my max cape and enjoy the rewards it offer so that is wrong?  So basically rewards are only good if you don‚Äôt have to invest much time in the game is what I am getting at?

I love the concept of the wilderness, I just haven't explored much as I've been doing quests (I like exploring different stories). In fact, I want them to put all the dragon tools on wildy bosses to be consistent and strip some less relevant drops.  I'd be cool with quests that involve more of the wilderness as well to diversify reasons to go there as well.
---
You're still not getting the point though. There is no risk if the reward it gives negates the negatives. You can't currently describe the wilderness as high risk- high reward when you lose nothing except five minutes to get back. I want it to be more punishing but that goes against EZ scape and would further kill the wilderness.
---
i only voted yes to see all tears from twitter k pop fans and twitter e daters cry babies.

Solo Zilyana - venoming the minions at the start of the kill is extremely helpful
---
ToB - You need some form of poison at Verzik p2, I guarentee that every good team will have at least one person with a serp helm.  
---
Cox self scout solos - unless you want to spend the extra money bringing sanfews every raid, serp helm will probably still get used for people who do solos without an alt to hold the raid, especially considering the new helm doesn't give a max hit with the scythe (or the lance unless you have max str which nobody brings into solos).
---
Haha xd rune make bad skill haha lol!!!

People wouldn‚Äôt spite vote if pvpers didn‚Äôt cry power creep every update. Or if pvpers were not constantly trying to get pvm/skill updates in the wild to try and lure non pvpers into it.
---
the gear reqs are like 100m
---
If you take them to different corners each pack, this works around the issue and you should be able to loot. The ashes should despawn by the time you get back to the original corner.
---
Here we go again...
---
Well scythe has like double dps and more reliable healing than Guthans. Doing half damage means being taking more damage as well. He had to innovate new strats and a way to troll the dps checks in ToB to compete it.
---
If he was so familiar would he be asking which skills were essential to start with? Not to mention he swapped over gp to use. Ironmen are like vegans man i swear. 
---
To OP: barrows gloves should be your first big "goal" and can be achieved in a couple weeks from scratch especially if you got a pre funded acc. This will level some necessary stats, along with necessary quests. Other than that i say start slayer as early as you can - then use slayer for training combat. Its more enjoyable and bearable that way grinding slayer to the level of actual profits from it. If youre not an ironmeme then you dont need to go for graceful immediately, or wintertodt to 99 FM or anything like that. Maybe get 50-60 att/str at sand crabs before you start slayer to give a little boost to training. 
---
I did something of the sorts, and got barrow gloves before i really started my slayer grind. I wanted to have max efficiency with slayer - so getting your untradeables like fire cape/torso/d def/b gloves helped. Also training a bit first to use a better slayer master will make the early levels go much quicker.

You really must be great fun at parties. I made a joke, you got super defensive about how you structured a meme... Relax.

I got my motivation back grinding for all hard diaries. That opened up most quest reqs then so started going for quest cape. I take breaks to do slayer, but mainly do slayer for clues and any clue req I can't do, I get.

Hello, osrs pleb here
---
What does hide all, 120 outfit, spike trap mean?
---
Honestly this is so unnecessary. People like you make me wish all skills were locked behind 500 total level so you can't play the game anymore. *sigh*
---
I voted no to warding because it sounded boring and didn't bring anything truly new to the game. Sailing as it was polled wasnt a good skill either but it has far more potential
---
Ava‚Äôs devices are rewarded from Animal Magnetism and are pretty vital to ranged play. You‚Äôll likely want a dragon scimitar when your attack skills get near 60 and that requires Monkey Madness II. Proselyte armor is also very useful for a long time and that‚Äôs obtained from the Slug Menace questline just to rattle off a few things.
---
Woooo

Quit and play something fun, seriously.

The blog did not suggest a toggle, unfortunately, so many answered "Yes".

Going from 1 to 30 is a bigger gain than going from 50 to 51.

Mining and smithing supply combat via range ammo and supply magic via alchemy fuel and I don't see an issue with this. Nothing about the skills is wrong imo. The training methods are diverse and the enjoyable to me. You're the one that seems to be stuck in the past if you think smithing should be used to make top tier armor. The skills purpose has changed but it still has a purpose.
---
But Boss what did I do??
---
You make like 150m over 300-350 hours at bloods. That's not exactly a lot per hour 
---
But some people seemingly don't agree with that basic understanding of gp/hr. You know you can make that same amount of money literally picking up loot from other people's fights.
---
People are taking it like I'm saying skilling can't profit. Ofc it can. You can make 100m from 91-99 mining as well from amethyst. But guess what that takes like 500 hours ahah.
---
Tbh I personally prefer getting that xp later on when the grinds become so long and monotonous and leveling takes forever. I don't mind grinding under 50 when you get a little dopamine hit every now and again for leveling.

I wouldn‚Äôt say you‚Äôre getting wooshed because I think that‚Äôs overused by people who make a bad joke and are trying to cover up and I‚Äôm just going to be honest and say I made a bad joke and you didn‚Äôt catch on. Completely understandable because, like I said, it wasn‚Äôt a very good joke.
---
You've misunderstood. I said it makes a good amount of money for 99. As in getting to 99. Even it's best methods of gp/hr don't come close to far easier methods.

Killing vorkath doesn't require like 100 hours of low profit skilling in an individual skill to then gain 1m/hr

That wasn't sailing that was a part of a quest ahaha. I wouldn't have expected the skill to be anything like that especially seeing as their initial proposal was moving around the ocean with clicks just like your regular player.

Yup just like any mage spell.

Thats a thing?

This isn't ports though. Ports isn't a skill

Its just funny to me how he CLEARLY states he isnt very familiar with the fucking game, but youve still gotta throw in youre an IM. Also saying its the most fun way to play is extremely objective. Cant do team based PVM outside of raids, or PvP, etc. Well you can if you dont mind getting no loot for your efforts.

Its also 100x more of a grind - so im just saying, its a very objective statement you made about being the most fun.
