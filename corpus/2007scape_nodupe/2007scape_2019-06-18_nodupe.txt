Get your def to wear obsidian armour, get full obsidian with obsidian weapons and an obsidian necklace, and you will see decent exp rates. 80-120k is hitting void range with blowpipe and 90 range, or Best in slot melee gear and 90 stats

But they did talk about it on the stream a while ago so something could be coming

I'd look to change bouncer to something like Kendal or Sand Snake.

Otherwise your XP seems to be about what you'd expect for your gear and levels. Things improve dramatically with Obby/B-neck/Sword and d-def (plus d-boots and b-bring(i) will give you some nice hits with small investment). 
---
If I were in your position I'd stay at crabs until 60 def then work on d-def requirements and and money-making required for the other gear.

Irrelevant to the post, but relevant to everyone talking about how their parents pronounced RuneScape. My Mom called Skyrim, "Skimrim" when it first came out and that shit still makes me laugh like 8 years later.

Hey its jfwu feel free to add me and yes its expensive but gratifying. Tip your healers. Its 124xp per cast and cost 2.3k per cast (4 astral 3 law 3 blood) and that's not including the food. I use angler which is 1.5m per 1k so I can max heal people which damages me 90 hp I've been doing for awhile probably  around same time as kroll show

Some of the recent content ideas like Warding were looking at making Lunar armor less atrocious. It's worse than fucking splitbark armor ffs. So it at least looks like Jagex understands that it currently fulfills no purpose in spite of the effort to get it. Stats don't match its requirements at all.

Yeah mistyped that, meant diaries.

You need a Fighter torso, dragon defender, Recipe for disaster gloves, at least a dragon scimitar, berserker helm or netizinot, dragon boots. These all give str bonus which means more damage which means more experience! Good luck!
---
I mean you get to see the parts to the pc when you buy it and upgrade or downgrade where you want. It's not like they are trying to hide anything.

Yeah I looked at that diary again. 100 combat level and having to raise multiple skills to much higher levels, no thanks! I’ll stick to exactly what you said. At least the bosses will be a very welcomed change of pace compared to the repetitive blast furnace.

This post quickly went to a mess, but I'll just leave it here for now. I prefer the main RS game over OSRS, but I mostly play OSRS for two reasons:
---
1. No mobile; went back to iOS recently and there's little hint at all of RS coming to it any time soon
---
2. [No UI scaling](https://old.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/byaadm/random_reminder_that_ui_scaling_needs_implemented/); biggest barrier stopping me from playing
---
This is what I like about RS over OSRS:
---
* Looks modern
---
* Combat is interactive (not boring click-and-wait)
---
* No NMZ or WT
---
* Overall QoL with skilling (M&amp;S, picking flax giving farming XP)
---
* AoE looting
---
* A bit harder Ironman mode (iirc more group activities are restricted on RS, and with Pest control you can't use points for XP at all)
---
Unpopular opinion time:
---
* EoC **in its current state** is fine
---
* MTX in RS is optional; however, I'm unaware as to how bad it's actually pushed (ironman btw). If it's in-your-face occasionally with ads about buying keys and whatnot, I'd be highly off-put from playing. But with ironman mode, I don't notice much of anything even hinting that MTX exists.
---
* Comparing your goals to someone else who may or may not have bought some MTX on RS is silly; people can buy skills and items with unofficial RWT on OSRS or any game, and bonds are just a pricer, official way of RWT; not to mention people that splash, use 3rd-party clients with indicators for Jad/Inferno/Zulrah (RL+), and even bot outright; there's a lot of devaluing features in both games
---
* Combat skills are heavily devalued on OSRS due to NMZ just being an afk XP fest
---
* Double XP days on RS is garbage (probably not unpopular opinion). Doesn't affect ironman either way, but I'd wish there was an option to not have the double XP rates if you didn't want it
---
* RS has more weapon choices available; in a lot of cases in PvM with meele, you're at a disadvantage if you aren't using a scim in OSRS, especially pre-Dragon; at Dragon it's a d long until the scim (maybe a dagger at slight inefficiency, and forget anything else exists unless you use the DBA just for the str spec); on RS if I want to use a 2H, I can, and I get the expected benefits out of it (higher damage over a scim)

Chances are if you’re flipping scythes you dont care about 15m, unlike people like me who get bored of the game and chuck 40m at duel arena just to quit
---
actually how
---
On death to pker with a clue scroll you should drop a "scroll of sadness" telling the pker when they could have won (legit just shows a posible casket reward of that level at random with maybe a 1/10,000 chance of showing a speed boat/family holiday) if they let the guy find the loot BEFORE killing him.
---
All the risk for the reward will be gone and it will just be another brainless boss
---
That's a fair point. I completely forgot you had to spend GP to even start the skill.
---
Which also brings to mind: Every quest that has a GP requirement is locked. Even the Dwarf RFD subquest can't be done because you need to put a single coin into a few beers. This UIM would be brutal.
---
Dude has 50 strength and thinks he is halfway to 99.
---
I like pking so OSRS all-day. RS3 is a great game, just a bit different. People want to act like MTX is a reason to not play but unless you're going for hiscores in a 20 year old game it doesn't really matter.
---

Well the reason why they exist is because people encourage them, if no one gave them any attention just like how it is for them in real life, then they might actually stop.

You may be unintentionally giving them their highlight of the day lol. 
---
You do you though.
---
They use to be like 5m :(
---
hopefully not, i've lost interest because it takes so damn long to get anywhere in the game. 20 days playing time on console games gets you to the point where you've beaten the game, with runescape 20 days gets you a 1392 total with 196 quest points, while grinding isnt fun.
---
Ye 1 def hp low as level for example I’m f2p pking at lvl 47 with 64 strength 40 attack and 68 range with 52 hp but that’s with cannoning some range levels to keeps hp a bit lower
---
Yeah I can respect that. Personally I like the grind, but if you don’t, then I can’t imagine this is the game for you
---
In the essence running discord. The invite is dtEqAD8
---
In all fairness it will make the rewards in the new elven area more valuable for trading just for the sheer fact most players cba going through that stuff
---
Which is fine by me :)
---
Yeah, that would be simpler, I agree.  Whenever I bring that up to people they either don't understand it or they say that it's going to ruin the economy.
---
Would have to have a way to make sure that the correct players receive the correct amount of cash either into their inventory or bank, when the offer fills.
---
Idk how Jagex codes, so Idk how they would do it but basically, if they can do it without the extra steps then yeah.
---
I mean I have sub 8 min runs and never splash. Although I agree I should get helm of nietzot, I just haven't done it yet. And there's literally no reason at all to bring any gear switches besides the weapon IMO.
---
  
---
Sub 8 minutes, and 1 sip of prayer seems like a pretty efficient run to me. But I'm open to advice and convincing me to start bringing gear switches.
---
Are u a brainless brainlet
---
No one is going to watch 11k clips, especially people at jagex. Also its ridiculous for someone to put 11k clips together.
---
I dig it.   Ice blast with some alching/humidifying for flavor.
---
That's fine, I haven't done the quest for the helm yet so I'm just rocking my slayer helm until ibdo. My setup gives me fantastically short runs, no splashes, and I take almost no damage from brothers. Plus I don't need any gear switches and only use 1 sip of prayer per run.
---
My setup seems more than ideal for 0 def enemies and me already having over 98 combat.
---
As mentioned in a comment below, I'm maxed without a single skilling pet. Not only that, but I have over 15m experience in every skill that grants a pet, and always use the methods that have the best chance of giving a pet (for example, I have a little bit over 100k giant seaweed in addition to the fruit trees/etc.)

Underground pass is a waste of a quest imo. Here we have this twisted, all powerful mage living in a tunnel blocking off the Elven Lands. Who is Iban? Why is he there? What does he gain by ruling over the underground pass. Ive done the RS3 elf series and it never really answers any questions. I really wish iban was apart of something much larger... like a group of demigods who remain on runescape even though guthix has banished all of the true gods. We took advantage of his weakness and slayed hom, but many others exist. Itd be a real good start to a OSRS original quest series.

Yes same account either way and no, mobile players have certain disadvantages like in PvP but also plenty of advantages when it comes to skilling with tapping.

Real talk though. What are some profitable low intensity ways to make money on an alt?
---
I'm running my alt ranging at Green dragons but it's really not that great.
---
I really didn't want to write this all out as I'm on mobile, but here goes. Please bear with me.
---
The fact that you're using literal DPS is throwing your math off. Osrs mathematics are measurable in specific increments of time. Ticks are a significant unit in this instance and must be accounted for.
---
Clean Max hits at 99 strength are as follows:
---
Dscim: 22 per 4 ticks
---
D2h: 27 per 7 ticks
---
Over a 28 tick scenario (the common denominator between the two),
---
Dscim: 22 * 7 = 157
---
D2h: 27 * 4 = 108
---
157/108 = +45.37%
---
Max gear max hits are as follows:
---
Dscim(empty shield): 32 * 7 = 224
---
D2h: 36 * 4 = 144
---
224/144 = +55.56%
---
The only point to be made here is that the scim outperforms the 2h by  close to 50% with current balancing and that difference is made greater with Max gear.
---
While we're doing the math, even without decreasing Max hit for the 2h, if the 2h we're allowed 1 tick greater attack speed and the dscim is left untouched, the math is as follows:
---
Clean:
---
Dscim: 22 * 6 = 132
---
132/108 = +22.22%
---
Max:
---
Dscim: 32 * 6 = 192
---
192/144 = +33.33%
---
The dscim would still maintain greater damage over a common number of game ticks, but the d2h would receive a buff to lessen this difference.
---
For a quick bonus: clean dds @ 99 = 18/4t
---
If buffed to 3t vs dscim:
---
18 * 4 = 72
---
22 * 3 = 66
---
72/66 = +9.09% more damage for dds
---
BUT, for the preferred attack style, accuracy is 40 for dds, 67 for dscim.
---
Dscim is 67.5% more accurate.
---
For this case, at the opposite of the spectrum, the dds would be superior to the dscim, but only against low defense targets. The dscim would maintain superiority in every other case due to it's increased accuracy.
---
As dds is currently only valued for utility and spec, this update would give it an additional niche due to superiority vs pures.
---
This is in it's 100% conceptual and unbalanced form. I would imagine the final product of this change to include positive and negative str bonus in tandem with possible weapon str bonus nerfs/buffs especially if scimitars were to be included.
---
Good game
---
No bank??
---
Cool I guess. Just wont happen is all.
---
Thank god
---
So even if something is dogshit in the game you think it should stay just because it was here for a long time?   Thats such a dumb fucking reason.    ME2 is barely being changed, just one ridiculous aspect of it is being changed and the best you can do is "fuck ironmen, ME2 was here first!". 
---
 How about have a legitimate argument against the change.  How does it affect RS negatively?  The average player?  Is it a waste of dev time?
---
Yeah for vorkath you 100% want elite void, the damage bonuses stack with the salve ei, giving you a really nice damage boost. For raids 1 elite void is nice to learn because you get decent damage with less switches, once you learn how to not die and get a bit of money upgrading to traditional switches is better. I haven't started ToB yet but I believe elite void is used very often. I'd suggest not working on pest control too much until you hit 100 combat, the veteran boat does make a significant difference over the duration of getting elite void. No worries man, good luck!
---
I think it's ok, like a poor person's Zam Hasta, comparble DPS to Lance vs. non dragons so it shouldn't impact Zam Hasta/Lance price too much.
---
I recommend completing Slug Menace and maybe Monkey Madness 1, to unlock the Proselyte armor and Dragon Scimitar respectively. Those rates you are getting makes sense for the gear you are using. I think those two things should be relatively easy to get and should bump up your dps and make you last longer until you are able to unlock Full Obsidian armor (including the weapon and necklace).
---
The main thing you should do is unlock items that give you strength bonus for higher dps or items that would make you last longer.  Honestly I did not start NMZ until I got base 65 stats and was able to afford full Obsidian. I trained at Ammonite crabs and Sand crabs.
---
oh yeah forgot about hasta, that things great

How would this solve the bot problem? The only people you hurt with this are the people who invested a lot of time into the game, not the people who set up low level bots.
---
Absolute dumb idea
---
Nothing in this game is "hard".  RS3 and OSRS are not "hard" games.  They are time consuming games.  You can make the game "hard" by not using guides or any outside knowledge except your own of the game and you can make it hard by playing as a UIM who is severely restricted.  
---
If you use Runelite you do not care if the game is "hard" which means 90% of players do not care.

I wonder about the decision to require a list of 50 random items to get a talisman from a dwarf in the first place. I guess they wanted to have death altar unlocked as a reward, but were very against giving you the talisman for it too.
---
It's a tedious thing that I never really look back on, kinda forgot I ever had to do it. It's like a blip in the timeline of extra things you have to do as an iron, but it just doesn't make much sense as an existing requirement. If it fails, it's just another thing that irons have to deal with but aren't overly upset about. It'll just continue to be a quest mechanic that no normal accounts even acknowledge the existence of. So it's strange that anyone cares if it gets removed; seems like the objections just come because it *would so happen* to mostly affect irons. Because normal accts don't even interact with it.
---
Thanks! I'm excited for it... kinda...
---
You get more points/h doing solos, thus more chances for pet roll. It's far less xp though as the majority of xph from WT is from the base xp of the crates, not from the rest of the minigame.

In early osrs Jagex did some "fun" livestreams killing 1000 of each boss, 1 hitting them so it was quick, so people could record the loot and figure out gp/hr.  They made an area ingame to do it and you could watch them killing the boss over and over again ingame, while they did it on stream.

Can only one pet be given per round (regardless of which world it happens). Like I guess with real bosses, only one pet can be dropped per kill?
---
You're right it doesn't prove his innocence but it doesn't prove his guilt either. Why even bother with a two week ban if you're just going to assume he's buying capes. Just perma ban the account if you're going to assume guilt before innocence, don't give them false sense of the possibility of redemption. Sometimes people fuck up and change their ways, sometimes they don't. I'm not defending the decision of buying his cape the first time, but if he really did do it himself the second time there's literally nothing else for him to redeem. What lesson does that teach to someone who learns from their past mistakes? He did his time, let him get his cape.
---
Now the only people that can manually check if its a legit cape is jagex. Its been said that once you get flagged you get sent through a flawed automated system. Its likely that this could be a false positive. A mod is the only one that will let us know if its legit or not. Obviously if its another fishy instance then he deserves his ban.
---
Do you use poh dummy to test if the level gives you a max hit or why that str level?
---
Only problem I can see coming from this would be everyone just putting in offer for 1gp  or so and noone actually "paying" full price since when one drops it'll just autosell to highest price even if it is 1gp or 10kgp.
---
Holy hell.  I never realised I was that lucky.  No wonder I can't get any rare uniques...burnt out all my luck.
---
RS3 has bank presets that do exactly what you want. But....we can’t do that cuz people hate EZSCAPE.
---
Too bad people don’t even realize that Runelite is easierscape than RS3
---
GNOME SAYING
---
How would you know what they voted for?
---
From what I saw, the reason for having the 3x exp is so you can camp red dragons without leaving. Take alchs, needle, and thread. Tan hides in the dungeon with the tanner, alch what you make, use bones on the burner. I don't really see a problem with this?
---
::bank
---
That and no combat xp from mounting unique boss heads in POH!!! Just give an xp lamp instead.
---
I got a rune pick before heading to mlm, it shouldn't take long at all.
---
Alright, thanks for the heads up, I won't be giving away accounts now that I know this. :)
---
Did you enjoy browsing /r/2007scape today?
---
&gt;Yes
---
Gmail has a neat feature where you can login to multiple accounts at once
---
I have two emails with vastly different untrue information needing to recover, both with 2fa and both with no activities other than my RuneScape accounts.
---
I don't tell anyone my login name, ever. 
---
I don't go around telling information to everyone like ISP etc
---
don't be an idiot and it's pretty hard to get hacked

Would you play my shitty text-based tic-tac-toe?
---
I'm not a virgin, but thank you for your input.
---
He just got moulded by the wrong people. Dude was homeschooled, probably little to no friends, extremely impressionable and then you have some junkie freak like Hyphonix doing scams and shit around you, acting like some self obsessed manchild. Alfie didn't stand a chance
---
Hi not a virgin, but thank you for your input., I'm dad.
---
I agree, my buyers usually all come from clans and already got friends playing.
---
If the child is paying $11 a month for candy and gets fruit he’s gonna stop paying.
---
I want 10 floors, more handholds, unique puzzles for every player, floor traps, wall traps, swap the shadow monsters for revenant knights, and if you leave the whole place resets. 
---
If its gonna be a grandmaster quest, then make it a *grandmaster* quest.
---
Regular ones don’t but the mutated ones in kourend do
---
Alright thanks for the heads up, I'll stop.

Yeah I brought sgs to my last trip indeed was so much better

This i believe will be true, i just finished the 70 agil grind from 55 to finish MEpt2 and it was a piece of cake. Im probably gonna grind out to at least 80 before attempting SoE, hope thats enough

Don’t be so hard on yourself man
---
you rotate the mirror, see it shine over a cliff, get lost because the minimap is super small, go down a ladder to try to get over it, go back up but go up the wrong ladder and have to go back to find the other ladder and finaly reach the second pillar so you can rotate the second mirror, and do it all over again with the next one
---
Either or man I just want something along the line of this as I think it would be a badass non game changing update!
---
But who's gonna skill my main? You think I care about the rune armor and black dhide these accounts will have? I know I'm lending to noobs, theres no point recovering. I have the accounts, I might as well sell/give them away since there's no point leaving them to gather dust all tourney.
---
Idiot troll.
---
itd be 30 or so monkeys with 0 pts gained. no worth
---
I only have a mobile account and I’m sure this will be so much fun........
---
Nice.
---
in this case interface being how the player manipulates the puzzle as a whole, not how the player manipulates the objects of the puzzle
---
I don't follow OSRS twitch channels very closely, but according to the comments he's been temp banned many times in the past, no?
---
If this was his first offense then yeah a permanent ban is probably extremely unreasonable but if not then you're definitely right, the man caught the ban he deserves.
---
What offhand should I take into Cerb for my first task there? I will be learning the fight this task.
---
lol I did darkness of hallowvale without a guide or runelite. It was terrible, but not impossible bc I didn't have any of that impossible-to-find-out-on-your-own shit some quests have that are otherwise easy. Took me soooo long to navigate the area and figure out what I needed to do to progress. 10/10 recommend doing it.
---
Anyone that’s ever played MW2 cannot claim to be innocent
---
I think you misunderstood, I'm not charging anyone Real money, I just want GP. OSRS GP has no real world value according to Jagex TOS. I'm not gaining any real money from the transaction, just valueless GP so I can go stake at the duel arena and have fun. Account sharing has been allowed since the beginning of OSRS, I'm not breaking any rules/laws. Jagex's property is still jagex's property regardless of what account it's on rofl.
---
Finally this autistic streamers career ended.  Sick of seeing that deadass meme “noooooooooooo”
---
tbh if my account was saved on someones list somewhere, they're probably not interested in RS anymore because that was like 10+ years ago. My account surprisingly doesn't appear to have been missing any wealth, but then again I don't really see much gold beyond maybe 1m because I'm a pleb.
---
The post kept getting auto removed, i was concerned it was because it violated some filter, so i astericked out the offense, but its is exactly what you would think
---
Yeah the potential on the screen is via RuneScape and not a rl plugin
---
I had to leave and get summer pies but I’d already dropped my mourner gear. If I brought them to start with I’d have been fine

Try disabling the quest list plugin

It aint worth it

No, i'm pretty sure you're just attacking a strawman here. Just because these individuals happen to be female doesn't mean hes speaking of female streamers as a whole.

Level 147 in tutorial island

But why even have a step that require other people? No other step in hard clue scrolls require another person
---
Me too lol. After seeing those ballers busting 25s in Castle Wars, I simply had to do it.

After enough failed attempts I levelled to 36 agility and managed lol.

That brother is a fellow marine. You talk shit about him, you're talking shit about me... and the next time you want to talk shit on me, remember my position in life and remember yours. I'm not some druggy piece of shit mf, I'm a fucking United States Marine. A title you will never claim. I've worked harder in the past 2 weeks then you ever will in your life. I have matured, learned, and taught myself how to be independent while you're still living on your parents paychecks. I make my own money, I pay my own bills, I work on a fucking Osprey while you can't even get a job at McDonalds. Don't ever try to talk down to me again because you were once above me because I will do nothing but strive to be on top and be better then the person I was yesterday. I've worked to hard and felt too much pain in my life for you to try and say you're better than me. Gtgo.
---
Never been much for pking, but id love to try it out by fighting back, if only skull tricking were not a thing.

Yeah, I was just referencing the Dragonfire Shield and how it has a face. Would be pretty wicked.

---
&gt; Very VERY simple concept that YOU are not understanding here. I never believed that I'm entitled to kill some stuff there in peace. I was EXPECTING to die, a few times actually, which is why I bought extra sets of stuff to head right back in after deaths. The issue isn't that I was killed. There's nothing wrong with that. The issue is that a couple people hunted me with zero reason, no incentive. I accepted the risk, but what the fuck can I do when someone makes it their goal just to fuck with me? They're higher level than me, there is two of them, and they're determined to kill me repeatedly for zero gain.
---
I fail to see how you were being "hunted", have you ever heard of hopping worlds and turning off your private chat....? There are TONS of worlds now in 2019, if youre seriously telling me that you couldnt get away from people "hunting" you simply by hopping worlds then you either dont know what turning your private chat off is, or you are woefully unintelligent. 
---
Literally all you have to do, turn off private chat...boom problem solved. Genuinely dont understand how you struggled with such a simple solution.
---
&gt; Second, what fucking tank gear am I going to put on at 60 defense? I'm still only a month or two into the game, facing off against people who are way higher level. Am I missing an unspoken rule that players like me aren't supposed to go in the wildy at all because we're just going to get beat up on? Is it only for high level players and pures? Is PvP set up in a way to shit all over newer players, because guess what, that's also shitty PvP design.
---
Black dhide? Brews and food have no level req. You said you were in monk robes and brought strength potions and little to no food...I mean what are you genuinely going to expect? A level 70 could even kill you easily because you were so poorly prepared and defended. I mean its not exactly hard to realize you have absolutely 0 survivability with such a setup, the "high level and pures" argument kind of flies out the window because of that. You were an easy target to kill for ANY player of reasonable level thats reasonably equipped to pk. Anyone would be able to kill you on even a level 50 pure with no stats but 75-80 range, probably even less.
---
Youre also in almost level 50 wildy...like what exactly are you complaining about, you think its unfair near maxed main can attack you there and only there? Of course people a lot higher level could kill you, the wilderness is balanced by that concept. Pures often dont go deep wildy for that reason and thats an account built for pking, deep wildy isnt meant to be "fair" at all.
---
&gt; But don't worry, you'll defend it with your life because it's the only PvP you aren't shit at.
---
Well youre clearly mad, cute projection you got going on there. All I did was simply point out that you put yourself in an extremely, extremely disadvantageous situation that made you nothing but a completely helpless victim by choice. You decided to get all emotional and hurt by the reality of it. Either dont go deep, deep wildy as a lower level and do a task in lower levels if you can or try to prepare well enough that you can escape by tanking and catching a gap and logging out or something. Theres nothing else to tell you beyond that, but dont act super surprised or its somehow unfair if you go to 50 wildy as a lower level in nothing but freaking monk robes dude and then complain about how PvP is broken because you happen to be a moron.
---
Stop gatekeeping you fucking turbo Autist, I build computers regularly and I bought my own personal computer from Best Buy, it was marked up $150 from what the cost in parts would’ve been and you can chalk that up to the neat cable management and time spent to actually build it. Buying a computer online or prebuilt in a store doesn’t make you an idiot, it makes you unconfident in your ability to not ruin anything, especially considering just how easy it is to fry a motherboard.
---
 Nope. Disrespect for any is disrespect to the whole group. If it was really about the streams, not the streamer, the hate would go towards people that sub. It doesn’t, because it isn’t.

I don’t care for your platitudes, so feel free to move along

No they're trolling you bro. There's no way now.. I suggest you take screenshots with your friends and family now while you have an untrimmed cape and then back them up on google drive just so you dont lost them. And then when your ready, take the plunge!

It’s so funny to me people are acting like no one wants this when we all know it’s gonna pass.

I remember when I was a kid I went through hell and back to download a gold generator from one of those “complete a survey to download” sites. It must have taken me hours, they are near impossible to complete, and then when I finally downloaded it, it linked me to the new version. This happens again and finally at v3 the button did nothing. My account never got hacked but I’ve always wondered if that was the case or if it was just a survey/ad money scam

Hey man, I see your getting hate for this. Just wanted to thank you so you can get recognition for the hard work. The boy I'm a godfather of suffers from mental retardation. Unfortunately he got scammed by this exact email last month.. he was devastated...
---
If this helps even one person its worth it. Help out people like little Timmy!
---
To be fair, I think what got him banned was him continuing to talk about it instead of just moving on. He didn't just swear, he said "suck a dick faggot." Turned off steam, and deleted the vod. He then turned on the stream and dug himself a big hole by not shutting up about it. I don't think he would've been banned had he just said it, apologized, then moved on.
---
Back in actual 2007 I spent most of my time woodcutting and playing castle wars / pest control. Surprise surprise, I was dirt poor.

They don't though.
---
If you say ni**a with confidence but not ni**er, you're fine. N word is treated differently because it's always used in songs, it's easy to have in your mind and say it without racist intentions. F word is never propagated in such a manner and is only used as an insult. I'm surprised Alfie, who looks like a Fa**ot has that part of his daily vocabulary even if he was drunk.
---
He's talking about the effects of alcohol. Some people just can't act or think straight when they're drunk which is what I think happened to Alfie. Graphist isn't this careless when he's smokes.

How do you make 17.5 gp on a 17 mil item? Are you that rich?

Lmao what? 2007scape is christian mingle? How often are you seeing these kind of posts?
---
I started back the same way, as it is fun to loot while your lvl 3. I cant imagine u wud end up spending too long at Revs looting before heading elsewhere, but it still is an option. No ones gonna be in your combat bracket 99% of the time, but you wouldnt be picking up rev drops: you would be picking up the scraps from the PKers who didn't fully loot their kills. Ive never done it myself but its totally feasible to try.
---
Underground pass is easy with minimum reqs on a norm acc and on an ironman its not much harder.
---
Ults a little harder but just do it in a few trips and your good.

What is he trying to say with the picture? I play league and  I don't get it

---
Depending on your build, you can use slayer helm as +1 and welfare rest, i.e rcb and gmaul. This combo is enough to antipk 1def pures - hell, you can sometimes get kills with only rcb and dbolts sometimes.
---
Dang, I really like this art style or how this is rendered or whatever it is that makes it look the way it does, I like.
---
You're definitely right.
---
Ok that's just not fair, RS3 looks beautiful

For real when I realized I wanted a bcp I immediately thought “damn, I have to chop like 20k magic logs for this.” No other money making method crossed my 13-year-old mind.

false. when rcing ur at 0kg with boots of lightness and spotted cape so graceful does nothing. same with farming.

Where/how does a UIM store fat stacks of potions? Sorry if it's an obvious question, I just seriously have no idea how UIMs manage to keep track of and store everything. There are a lot of storage mechanics I am completely unaware of in this game.

Lucky you it's impossible to do verb task with 170 without have god level reflexes

Flipping is shit now that YouTubers are making videos on it.

Oh damn, that's pretty dope. (Just started playing again)

Rc best skill

Then this game probably isn’t for you. That sums up the majority of the content in the game.
---
I like weed raking content, which falls under Farming
---
Oh fuck off. 
---
You do know ironmen aren't one big homogeneous group that all think and want the same thing, right?
---
Not every fucking update that makes the game easier is supported by or tailored towards Iron Men. And even if it was, if enough normal accounts also want it, what's the fucking problem. You do understand Ironmen can't pass polls alone, right?
---
You guys sound like little children that have a vendetta against people who like to play the game a little differently to you. If you're genuinely outraged by this, fuck me lol.

If you're not rune drag alting 6 other accounts during an afkable skill you're being inefficient

Hi jargex
---
Can they do a max cape for 1669 total level? Like I know I’m not maxed, but people with higher total level get new content all the time. Just think it would be nice for us 1669 to get a new cape, change the meta etc.
---
Please let me know.
---
Thanks 
---
An idiot
---
This man EHP’s
---
The reason why the rest of the game is like that is because all that content leads to something. All this is, is just a lazy obstacle placed there for no real reason
---
Not gonna lie, I’d watch a tv series of this. Amazing work!
---
I would argue that this post alone was more useful to the community than any meme that has been posted here as it literally helped this dude get his clan and friends back. When you get hacked you can basically replace everything except for your friends so I'd say it's pretty awesome there was a place for OP to have a place to post something like this. And regardless, it was a very specific situation that happened where OP got hacked before they got to exchange personal info. 
---
With how toxic this game can be why be so discouraging when something nice actually happens here? 
---
Also the Unsolved Mysteries comparison is better but if you're going to make that comparison I'd say a unsolved mystery in Runescape of all things was a lot more entertaining than the constant crab memes we've all had to endure.
---
But you can vote earlier if the forthos dungeon is added.  So what the fuck are you bitching about.  Adding the forthos dungeon is one of the first few questions.  Its not being added regardless you monkey so maybe you should learn to read?  Read the first sentence IF FORTHOS DUNGEON GETS ADDED.
---
There’s hundreds of unnecessary obstacles I could name in this game, but without them, the game would feel empty and like it’s missing something.
---
I definitely was invested, thankfully someone notified me from another thread that it was solved
---
I know the math perfectly well, and I would disagree even further if you want this update for the rest of the game. *I don't want defence to be even better*. 
---
Also, when people refer to "soaking", we mean the pre eoc update which was literally named "Damage soaking"
---
Having defence is already incredibly strong; most dps upgrades comes from getting it. Piety, bandos armor, serp helm, fero gloves, prim boots, avernic, ancestral, rigour, and the list goes on. 
---
I agree that defence doesn't do what you'd generically expect from other video games, but it's already insanely strong as is, and buffing it even further is such a fundamental change that I'd never wsnt to see it. I also whole heartedly reject the "but it makes sense!" Argument people often use; that's what created EoC when you dragged it out to its logical conclusion
---
I was a while back, were you the guy that scammed me for 12m?
---
Thanks homie
---
Just as I started to hate these... very clever tho
---
You can... But you'll struggle as a BTW as your only option is Ibans staff. There's no way you'd have 87 slayer for the trident at this point.
---
Zulrah can be done with Ibans if you're experienced but it is a fair bit slower weapon than trident so it affects the way you kill it
---
I'm against buying xp and unlocks with real money, but buying adventurers log would be something i'd be ok with as mtx.

I edited my comment, clip in in there now. Enjoy

Not even a real god pfff. Merely a demi god

well it also recorded pvp kills which is useful.

I played RuneScape on my grand dads computer and like 2 weeks later he got a virus, blamed it 100% on me and I was never allowed to play again, little did I know he was downloading free programs and anti virus software to speed up his computer the whole time. But no miniclip and RunEscape gave him the virus
---
MM is great and gives you the xp booster for mining, but it’s best used afk. I prefer it over iron for that reason but that’s just me
---
Yes! this was amazing. Once i got a Divine Sigil from Corp (Before EoC) in a mass cc. My Friends didn't believe me and i had this beautifull update to back me up. +1 for me
---
It's really not that big of a deal. Guranteed 99% of the people crying about it have already completed the quest anyway.
---
Lmao I'm dying man. I don't even play RS anymore. I just stay for the memes
---
I already got my qp cape. It is time.
---
That about sums it up perfectly.
---
If you're using Runelite, you can press Alt 2x to turn off ground items. You can also hold in Alt in order to change which items show up.
---
Yup, it's really convenient. I hunted 12,000 monkeys this way and saved myself from the pain of hunting chins
---
70 in 8 skills is one of the highest requirement quests in the game, they're going to progress slowly in quest requirements just as RS3 did
---
Youre best bet at this time is to simply do it again and record it this time. I know its a difficult task but if youve done it before you got this. Record it, and it happens to be removed, then you can request the wrath of crabz
---
Mep2 with no guide is difficult
---
The rich get richer smh my head
---
Lmao why make it easier, I'm a btw myself but this is just rediculous

No XP waste 😤

This thread makes me grateful my folks knew computers.

I think he was saying that depending on who you compare your wealth to, just about everyone is poor - except for like Jeff Bezos.

A working class person might be rich relative to somebody that is homeless, but compared to Taylor Switch, he might as well be homeless himself.
---
I'm the one who mapped darkness of hallowvale out for runelite. I did it because I had to do it myself and God did it suck
---
All these resources were desperatly put in nmz to combat botting. Now they have solved that issue, tower of life and wildy bosses drop way more eggs than picking them up...
---
Its time to remove this one from nmz, and work on removing the last few resources as well...
---
If you hate an individual puzzle, you must either use guides or be bad at puzzles. You're a genius, dude. I bet you had lots of fun with the agility handholds

I think YouTube needs to focus on increasing their steaming platform so they can knock Twitch down a few notches off their high horse. They think they run a monopoly on live steaming games and YouTube will start getting more of the people getting banned.
---
You making a video for this opening?
---
Exactly. 
---
In all honesty, I wish some sort of botting was allowed, but it wouldn’t affect highscores and such.
---
Hey I have purple skin and gray hair whatcha tryna say
---
Patience of a saint my man, will you be uploading the results ?
---
Yeah, had over 15mil of highly inefficient slayer and bolting steels for a good 20 magic levels in that game without on.
---
In os i got one on my zerker within 3 mage levels, than another one later on my ironman from just 1k wyverns..
---
When Mod Ed went through the puzzle in a meeting and said "one of you will need to be the guinea pig to test it out and see how long it takes to complete" everyone immediately had that look on their face.

Someone do it with orichalcum weaponry/armor

Oh yeah... that’s definitely bad... I understand how bad that had been then.

Pure gold lmao.

The entire attack style update Jagex did is a disaster. They should've never messed with it. Players were used to them and it workes for the most part. Changing the default options and mechanics people know is bad in general.

Looking for comments not karma 👌

If revs dont work, try looting Kourend Slayer caves.

Randomised traps and puzzles per person, and they shuffle if you fail.

Yeah, bring back the original Inferno Adze. Loved that  item.

That's ridiculous. Let old content remain the same instead of applying ezscape...

Grinding is fun

Glad that i've got the quest cape and most necessary places in game unlocked already
---
Poll nerfing the blowpipe and it will 100% fail. People just vote in their own interest, they don't care about the longevity of the game
---
\&gt; I feel like you guys are arguing against the spirit of the idea rather than the actual proposal. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That's not a bad thing.  Note the first two words that constitute osrs - this game was made on spirit, and it seems that strategy has worked rather well for it, since at this point it's eclipsed rs3.
---
\&gt; I honestly just dont understand why anyone would really care that much about this change 
---
I know.  Of the billions of changes that the community and jagex could work on, they chose to suggest that they should do weird shortcuts (that arent necessary because the abbyss exists) on a decades old quest line.  I feel like theres no particular strong case to be made for randomly making the elf questline easier at this juncture, and if you're clueless as to why anyone cares about this change that should if anything make you prone to agree with me on this.
---
The default state of any quest is unchanged.  If a change seems inconsequential, then thats an argument against adding it.  Not for.

No, people shouldn't vote in their self interest. People should vote on what's best for the game.

I aint gunna argue that u can think more in rs3 bosses, i just dont find any of it enough where its really challenging. I could streak telos all day but i play osrs way more and i’ll die after 5mins of perfect osrs bandos. Tho perfect telos and perfect bandos arent completely comparable.

speaking of 300 u seen that awsome gif of mod ash hahaha
---
Oh I see! The way you worded it was confusing lol
---
I like bot interactions hence why I play RuneScape
---
Can you bring them to gargoyles?
---
I don't know why this is giving me so much feels
---
Back in August 2016, Jagex posted [a statement](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/third-party-clients?oldschool=1&amp;gsi=iv56lz) saying that 3rd party HD clients are indistinguishable from botting clients and that anyone who uses them runs the risk of getting banned. Furthermore, the statement said that in order to resolve this issue, Jagex would have to give out info that would make it easier to bot. Is this still the situation? **Is there any way to open the door to 3rd-party HD clients?**
---
I did the pass like 8 times for regicide, I don't mind if nobody has to do it anymore
---
~~Giving people easier access to Regicide is progress?~~  Giving bots easier access to Regicide is progress?

Seems specific, nice projecting

Will we get raids 3 and if so when?

I meant as like he says it will make regicide easy but that’s how rs is it always making content easier it’s been that way forever shit happens and people just have to get on with it if ya know no point people complaining over it is  what I mean haha
---
Either he has 99 cooking, or at least 68 farming. Either way the ID card is lying.
---
Why do they have different alch prices
---
whats your goal? 100 legit takes 2 months via med clues, currently getting 1-2 a day 3 hours of game time :P
---
It's a simplified version of MMOs
---
Why?
---
Hey! I'm combat 57 - There's a huge amount of people lvl 40-70 all the time :)
---
In the context of this thread I had assumed he was talking about polling in general, not this specific poll which may have incorrectly colored my response. Still, assuming he means this poll question only, even if you think this change is bad for the game they're not really mutually exclusive. Mutual exclusivity is more like two things that physically cannot be true at the same time, whereas the relationship between this poll and the health of the game is a matter of opinion. Even if you think your opinion is the correct one, that doesn't make it an unimpeachable truth. 
---
As for comparing the community to a bunch of children you may not be wrong but I'd just like to point out the irony of what your suggesting. If the community really doesn't know what's best for itself and it needs some higher parental authority to tell it what's best, wouldnt that mean that you're advocating for no polls and for the mods to just decide what the game needs?
---
Nice to see you're back, serene. Thought you might have self-alchemised
---
Wew
---
Ah exactly, yes I get you. May want to slap a cheeky edit in there before reddit ragdolls you about for a bit
---
Sneaky surprise if they sit me

Yea I’m prepped for the down votes oh well haha
---
I legitimately spent 30-40 minutes failing the bridge in olafs, played some dota to calm down, then came back it and solved it after another 10 or so.
---
Fuck that quest.
---
Magic shortbow (i) out dpses crystal bow pal. But also, yes. Zulrah has set a *very* bad precedent for OSRS bosses, shitting out consistent profit vs relying on unique drops.
---
That is extremely lucky, people get 99 wc with no pet
---
Don't talk shit about the best skill in the game like that, normie.

---
**Could Barbarian Assault reward XP, perhaps a small combat XP lamp?**
---
In the course of getting my fighter torso that BA is pretty fun once you get past the learning curve and find a good team. However, I don't want to keep playing because it doesn't give any sort of XP. I assume this is to prevent pures from being forced to get defense XP when they serve as attackers, and to make it more fair for collectors/defenders/healers. Lamps would solve these issues--everyone would get XP, and no one would be forced to train skills they don't want to train.
---
\~ yolo \~

How come I have to wait a minute to use the looting bag on PvP worlds when I'm already IN THE WILDERNESS? (For example, I PK someone at revenant caves, I have to wait 1 minute in order to put the loot in my looting bag. It wasn't like this before).
---
Thanks - A_G_4

Bot busting streams aren't actually effective at stopping bots, they take a fair bit of resource too.

\~\~ yolo \~\~

\~\~yolo\~\~
---
And what’s your prayer level?
---
One tip I'll give you is the community is healthy but I wouldn't trust anyone with your in-game items, and there will be people who try and trick you into going to a phishing site, or luring you for your items.  Just remember, if something seems too good to be true - it probably is.
---
^ this basically

I was lied to.
---
#funktion-oneganggg
---
Math isn't my strong suit

😂😂😂 bunches and bunches of them

~~yolo~~
---
Figured it out
---
I think it was already polled (and passed) that guardians would be getting a new tradeable unique to upgrade the granite maul.
---
the pvp world is 325 now
---
Because that is relevant? it’s not for the bots it’s for the players how can jagex help a by product it’s like saying they shouldn’t of removed the wcijg random or fishing random because it killed bots sometimes. Lol
---
Could we get a Prifddinas theme for our POH after completing Song of the Elves? Perhaps it could be a reward/drop from a boss/minigame/thing in Prif.
---
The theme would be like a house from Gwenith, with White walls with wood and a green roof with some windows poking out.
---
Spinewielder should smite the heathen.
---
You'll get sucked in and Will bever be Anke to leave
---
Your first point is fair, I can't argue something as a fact when it's an opinion, even if it's, in my opinion, an opinion that's hard to debunk.
---
As for your second point, I wouldn't want polls to be gone, but I would like for Jagex to restrict who votes on what. Just like how I think I personally shouldn't be allowed to vote in every pvp poll when I've never solo pked in my life, I don't think a pker who can't even get his own fire cape should be allowed to vote on ToB changes. I know this isn't how democracy works but I do think it would be much better for the game.
---
Mfw it says “etc” implying a situation if you read the post
---
I think the forthos dungeon and the spider boss are good, as well as it bringing a niche 65 attack crush weapon into the game. The ones about underground pass are pretty bad though.
---
How does it work then
---
end game content is where all the fun is at - grinding slayer with bis gear for your current level doesn't long at all to get base 80 combat stats
---
Nmz makes combat 99s a breeze but isn't efficient if you care about that stuff
---
As a deep wilderness pker, this took me a quarter of a second. I can spot a spade from 10 miles and pick up the scent from over 25. Was this supposed to be a challenge? Fool, all you’ve done is rekindle my thirst for virgin cluehunter blood. I am coming.
---
This shit has to stop or ill never ve able to to Monkey madness...I need that quest guide

Collection log improvements
---
Could tabs/bosses turn green once complete?
---
Could we see some sort of high score system for the collection log? Even it was just for the top 1000 players. It would be great to follow who is closest to completion, and would encourage some competition.
---
It wasn't nearly as bad as the first time since I was over 20 agility higher, is not great when you forgot antipoison and have to go back through
---
I already feel sorry for Slayermusiq1 , failing this a bazillion trillion times before completing the guide.
---
u/uwutranslator

cause lot of players vote no if it doesn't benefit them. as more players get high lvl, expect most mid lvl content to have a harder time passing.

Oooh, nice jab. It just reeks of confidence, doesn't it? I'm flattered one such as you would defer to my linguistic expertise.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
No, you see, if this was a question that was sincerely asked to incite discussion, why would they add an 'even' at the start there? Why add the 'why jagex?' at the end? Why go out of ones way to mention how long the quest has existed and, not to mention, how long ironman mode has existed?
---
It comes off as needlessly complain-y. Sure, it *is* a question. It *will* incite a debate. But it never asks *us* what *our* opinions are. It just rethorically asks Jagex why. And no, rethorical questions aren't inherently complain-y or anti-debate-y. Quite the opposite. Remove the 'even' from the first part of the question, and you've got yourself a perfectly fine rethorical question.
---
the govt ain't arresting him.
---
Can you take a look at eliminating some of the unnecessary dialogue in the viyeldi caves after you have completed the quest, especially when walking over the rocks? Maybe an option to slide down in exchange for a certain amount of damage?
---
Is the Helm of nezzy, ddef, dragon scim, obby body, torags legs, dragon boots, combat brace and ammy of power and acceptable set up to train combat for the time being?
---
Is this alright or can I expect to see myself over on r/cutenoobs?
---
I don't have that much time to play as I have a newborn so I don't really want to do barb assault for the fighter torso. 
---
Is there any better legs I could use and which items could be upgraded for me? 
---
I have 70 def, 68 attack and 70 attack.
---
Any advise would be greatly appreciated! Haven't played in 2 years so my knowledge is dodgy.
---
How?
---
people are just too scared to lose their items, just look at the death timers
---
Training combat magic costs so much it's hardly profitable. Try running herbs, I like that. For plain combat nmz&gt;ammonite crabs&gt;sand crabs&gt;rock crabs. I always thought tithe farming is a waste of time. I only did fruit trees and herbs for 99 farming. For actual money aim for zulrah or vorkath.
---
How’s it feel to make 4 gp?
---
5 or 6 grand? I'm assuming two or three builds in that time?
---
I built a mid-range pc back in 2012 for about $1700 CAD - all I've upgraded since then is the graphics card to a 970. It can still run most new releases on high settings. Maybe I've just been lucky it's held on this long.

Yes.

Idk much about how it all works, but if osbuddy could pull prices from GE to give GE value prices etc, I feel like runelite could do the same with the loot tracker as well. This would actually be a super cool update.
---
You all laugh but this is close to how a lot of people think merching works.  
---
Can't tell you how many people I've had bragging to me about flipping an item worth 30m for a profit of 200k.  
---
Merching isn't about the amount of profit. It's about ROI in percentages. 
---
I have a certain item that I regularly high volume merch for a 10% ROI.  
---
You should focus on getting at least a 7 to 8% ROI.
---
I do but I always seem to get a lil bit from a random world each time. I’m unlucky lol

---
No
---
Disagree. Puzzles are great
---
It's multiplayer but you can play different modes which make it so you can't trade other people. And two modes of that which further restrict the account which either makes it where you can't use a bank or you have 1 life and if you die you become a normal Ironman.
---
Lol big rip I made 300 when it went to 34 $ sis you really think Navi would be so hype to drive it up. The stock has been extremely up and down and unless you bought above 30 like 5 months ago or like a week ago being down 100$ is better than what you were down in December.

I can do vorkath for 2m/hour or whatever he is now but some days i just want to train noncombats casually so my cash stack basically doesnt move.
---
Minigames and bosses are multiplayer, skilling is solo :) You can join a clanchat to talk to people while you're busy tho! If you need guidance, the community is very willing to help out new players!
---
To me the fun part is continueing to find new ways to improve how I play the game, there's so much content that you'll be able to find out new ways of doing things even years after you started.
---
The best way to play is using [RuneLite](http://www.runelite.net), a community developed open source client with a bunch of quality of life features. You can track your gainz with [CrystalMathLabs](http://www.crystalmathlabs.com), but beware, experience is addictive. :p
---
If you ONLY want rc pet do mind runes with the teleport tablet
---
The OSG Models are really well done here wow
---
You can play whichever way really. A lot of it is solo, but some bosses and minigames are group.
---
It's also highly addictive and can easily consume your life
---
Saw the aftermath in his stream last night. Was pretty funny to honest. Never watched the guy before but it's pretty sad that he just kept crying and digging himself in deeper. Should've just kept his mouth shut and gone to bed. Not saying that he wouldn't have gotten banned but he only made it worse for himself
---
Thanks for the reply :) don't know why everyone is down voting this. Some people just have sticks up their ass I guess. ^_^
---
zerker get 45 def and high stats on str/ranged/mage
---
usually att lvl can go 60 or 75
---
Twitch has the right to refuse to host any sort of speech they want. They're a private company that owns their own platform. Free speech doesn't protect you from being banned from a private platform.
---
Buying a 1000 pack of needles off Amazon and putting them all in my urethra at the same time is better content than that quest
---
The light puzzles are easy though I can't believe people are dumb enough to have problem with it

Can a Jar of Smoke be added to the Thermonuclear Smoke Devil drop table? At this time it is the only Slayer boss that does not have one.
---
Idk why but I love the Twitter reply “what happened now” I use to actually enjoy his streams for maybe a day or two then proceeded to get tired of his persona of “oh I’m not making any money off twitch please donate to me so my landlord doesn’t kick me out!” I think it’ll be good for his mental health, go out get a job and make some friends.
---
Make sure all quests get your defense to 45 that are necessary for a zerker. There are guides out there. Otherwise you limit your max potential
---
But they'd have an iron full helm on :(
---
He's been tempbanned and given warnings plenty before. Other streamers get a 30 day AT MOST for things like this
---
Whoops, I meant glory instead of power! So really a zerker neck is the next step then.
---
I'd be loathed to do barb assault encase the little lime starts crying, wouldn't be fair on the group if I go AFK. I'd forgotten the whip existed! They don't have a strength attack option though does it? Should I stick with my dscim for strength training?
---
Thanks for much  for the reply.
---
This is a very sorry term attitude. Maybe you enjoy it, but the thought of logging in just to pick up ash from the floor would be depressing.

Is crash cavern a lose everything at death area after mm2?
---
Like chewing 5 gum
---
Iv always wanted to merch, but was always too dumb and impatient for it
---
Yikes
---
So, couldn't you just not do it then?  Seems like stuff like this and the MM2 platform are just ways to add time to a quest to call it "very long" and "grandmaster" without actually writing a significant amount of plot.
---
By the way, my favorite quest is Underground Pass; I don't hate stuff just because it's long.  I dislike it when a quest has a part that turns off the plot and just decides to have a step that takes 2 hours without adding anything to the story.  Am I the only one who thinks this way?
---
Awww 3:
---
"The"
---
I'm your dad

Ye ik I was just joking. the first guy said "smh my head"
---
Our hero is toiling on the island as we speak! 
---
Thanks for the kind words
---
Looks like Deathwing when he fell into the Maelstrom
---
Especially after you make a mistake then you just try to rush back to where you were and fail 15x times more cause of that.
---
Whos nobody?
---
Assuming that someone is multi accounting. Lol
---
Not once you've completed the quest i believe
---
“One”
---
Just start over and make whichever account you're interested in playing, you've basically done nothing so it's not a huge loss. Whichever account you decide to do don't just jump into it and start leveling, look up a guide so you know which quests you can and can't do for your build etc.
---
Why do people care? the list of items is mostly a waste of time, why not cut some out? It's not like it actually adds anything to the game at all. If mains had to do the entire list it would have been changed years ago. Ironman just highlights shitty design.
---
That assumes you have a bunch of other high level stats though.
---
Can we get elks/moozes into Priff or surroundings? https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c1nyf1/feeling_my_new_outfit/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Most ironmen I know like having a well rounded account and are not going to wait a year to spend 50 minutes getting a 1/128 drop so they can save 25 minutes during the quest. It makes no sense whatsoever my dude. This is legit the first time I've heard people take the suggestion to wait to get the slayer level to do the quest seriously. I chill with irons all day and it is mentioned sometimes, but ironically because who the fuck does that lmao.
---
Lol ik read what i wrote again
---
The solution to the game taking significant amounts of time to get anywhere meaningful? Either do it or don't play. Don't try to overcomplicate something that isn't complicated. You're either willing to do it or you're not.
---
&gt; a month after release
---
Lol.
---
I'll be doing it a day after release when the wiki somehow already has a full guide.
---
OMG sorry bro I totally misunderstood !! Well I often see post from this sub while lurking popular posts so I didn't even know there was even two versions of this game. Sorry man.
---
Can we complain about it for 4 years after it doesn't go our way?
---
I always got annoyed that i couldn’t advance to the next part without clicking on the menu like the Run, Quest Log and Friends List. Maybe that could be some inspiration
---
Ok great thank you all for the advice, I'll see you out there soon enough
---
Yeah I've been viciously called a cheater by people in this community because of using Guam tar to set down traps fast and to barb fish. After I quit rs as a kid I played fps and moba games and I really enjoy high click intensive activities so I try to max out my actions per minute because that gets me going. We all play this game for different reasons. I think we should all respect that. Unless you play this game to practice writing scripts. Fuck your bots.

Oh, so you want it to be completely skippable with a ring? Ok, I'm down with this.

Yes, it would work. It will take you a super long time and unless you use melee and prayer flick it will cost you a ton of gp.

You don't have to do it.
---
Why are the amount of employees that work on old school RuneScape so low compared to jagex in general? 
---
Jagex lists 407 employees total but there’s about 20 that are listed as part of the old school team at the end of developer blogs.
---
This is incredibly out of proportion as osrs is the only game 85% of paying customers support development for.
---
My friend keeps RWTing i report him and he doesn't get banned wtf jamflex
---
I left off at the infamous light puzzle part of Mourning's End Part II. Should I wait until they potentially patch it before attempting to complete it?
---
Mep2 light puzzle area isn’t instanced. Nothing is lost
---
Nah hosting isn’t great as switching requires time and is sometimes full,
---
Also there are more pkers in Wildy than random world, plus more lag and spots are harder to find
---
&gt;t just makes no sense. "Lets allow players to create different accounts with restrictions that make the game harder", followed by "These restrictions are making the game harder, lets make the game easier for them"
---
How is getting this list of items adding difficulty? It isn't it's just a waste of time that should never have been in the game. If they actually had hard to get items then you may have a point.
---

Some of it is luck finding good items but it’s super easy to make money even if you don’t find home run items all the time. Flip barrows gear, flip the most traded items (zulrahs, bloods, cannonballs, etc.) Runes are good if your cash stack is low. 
---
When you’re starting out look for things that are traded a lot, sharks/raw sharks, coal. The margin checks on those items is like 10gp at most so it really shouldn’t add up to much in losses. And the buy limits are high so you profit 10,000x your margin check “loss”.
---
If rc doesnt bother you, you should look into getting 75 rc and running essence for astral rcers its 4mil + hr
---
How much playtime on that acc? Lol
---
Isn't that what interns are for?
---
By just doing the one in the farming guild once a day
---
"Knocks"
---
I think possibly lots of people don't know it exists because... Well it's in construction and people avoid that due to expenses and only think about it for the rejuv pool and teleports
---
If you are 75 runecrafting
---
This is really good! Only thing I would say is using more shading effects to help my eyes see the break between its body and its head would help a lot
---
This is good. These are good. Keep making them
---
Purest are the only ones complaining. It's the same with fire Cape. People think jad is hard but he is one of the easiest bosses.
---
hi did you ever get closure about that recording? no need to say but it would be nice to know
---
MM2 docks are completely unnecessary and unrelated to the quest itself. It's a travesty it was kept in.
---
Goodbye

I was literally just on that thread. Are you me?

---
The most apt answer
---
I mean the light puzzle was fine... As long as it doesn't have a high agility obstacle with 10 checks for failure with low af chance.
---
The actual puzzle was fun, and if you didn't want to work it out following a guide made it child's play. It's just that damn agility obstacle that tortures people's memories because most people got to doing the quest while being wayyyyy low in agility.
---
I love how bent out of shape these nerds are over this. Can't wait for the quest
---
no way dude
---
I imagine the 50-100 votes (depending on clan size) really won’t affect polls anyways but good for them.

Btw

Have you never played back in 2007? Dying anywhere almost certainly meant losing your shit. Its so forgiving right now.
---
That's my 11 herb spices secret
---
It was something along the lines of content sometimes being pushed/held back because you had to keep irons in mind and it could be stressful. Not sure if it was a jmod comment or on a stream. Hell idk maybe i dreamed it at this point (not really). 
---
But anyway sorry to put you on the spot lol
---
Ironman players sign up for the challenge, don't change the game around them. UIM player here.
---
You cant use the tablet version, has to be the real spell i think, need to unlock it first if you didnt do it yet
---
Precisely. The only annoying thing about the last light puzzle was the stupidly aggressively designed RNG check.
---
But in an osrs World with staminas and graceful and this being released 6 years post launch.. most people's stats will be at a point where running around doing a light puzzle following a guide will be easy. So it will probably involve that just to make use of people's high skills. And monsters attacking you is good imo.
---
There is a mystery to every item
---
Keep dying, any tips?
---
You *can* play your account on a computer; they're the same accounts.
---
Yeah, super easy when you've got a guide on how to do them. 
---
Mep2 light puzzle takes like a half hour even if you know exactly what to do and never have to repeat a step. It's just unnecessarily artificially inflating the length of a quest.

I want summoning too

The cooking guild bank is locked behind 99 cooking or varrock hard diary, which requires planting a yew tree, which means at least maxed skill or lowest skill is false.
---
I actually enjoyed the puzzle; the high-hitting shadow monsters were the real horror of that quest
---
Not good for anyone, creating more of a divide is only going to grow more of a problem
---
I tried tons of things. Ppots/stam pots, sharks, dark crabs, various pieces of armor/god d'hide, ores, bars, you name it. Maybe part of it was being picky due to my cash stack, but even so I was finding tons of items with &lt; 20 gp margins, if that, and the more expensive items I tried like barrows or d'hide were only ~10k or less, which isn't much when you're working with a 3.5m cash stack and can only buy 2 or 3 of them.
---
Lol

Lmao, imagine perming a content partner for that. You're a streaming site where people can't edit out their fuckups and you take away someone's livelihood permanently over a single middle school tier insult. Christ.

Hey, wanna hire me? I’ll do it for free no pay.

You are right, all your comments are stupid and you are just hearing what you want.
---
The hardest part of ironman is the mid game, which is the easiest for normal. Otherwise its way harder for normal at first (especially because ironman is literally given  a free  set of gear right away and normal people have to make it or wait to buy it. (not to mention its equivalent to iron, not bronze. so they literally skip a level.)
---
and its no where near 98% but just keep throwing out random numbers like you know everything. As the person above said there is a very select number of skills you can use the GE to level at. Otherwise all the others you literally have to do on your own. But just keep ignoring where you are wrong and act like you are winning. 
---
And better gear doesn't make a task easier when half the ironman guides just say "skip tasks until you get this one. Use a cannon if you can make cannonballs. Safespot these. Etc." Hell even the wiki says NOT TO DO IT UNTIL YOU ARE BASICALLY OVER LEVEL 100 and if you don't have gear by just naturally progressing then you have no clue what your doing. Like you arguing right now.
---
1742 total, started new years night 😜
---
Excellent task! Get to spend some quality time in the sun while slaying, what more could you ask for?
---
&gt;why was the decision made
---
So that players could vote on it. Did you want them to implement the changes without polling? 
---
&gt;To an unrelated poll blog
---
Do you think that having multiple facets to a poll is bad? You know that you can vote Yes to the bits you like and no to the bits you don't like, right? 
---
&gt;Leaving no time for feedback
---
It was literally polled in a poll, giving players the chance to give feedback by voting either yes if they thought it was a good idea and no if they thought it was a bad idea
---
&gt;How can the team justify
---
They didn't attempt to justify it, they gave players the chance to vote on it in a poll. No justification was necessary as this is not something that was implemented, only polled. 
---
I seriously don't get why people are upset, I voted yes to the good things and no to the bad things. That's how polls work.
---
Unsure if you're joking, but absolutely doesn't apply here. Twitch is a private business, not the government.

He argued that Ironmen already had it easy enough for this quest. I reminded him that this might cater more to UIM than regular.
---
If the poll changes anything for UIM, they have something to do with the poll - obviously. That does not mean it was created with the intention of catering to UIM though.

it took my brain  a really long tim to make sense of this image.

Deep enough to make a post about it. If you would’ve just lost a spade you wouldn’t care.

Can we get post-99 RNG scaling for skilling pets?
---
How many people do you really think use the authenticator?
---
Hopefully the votes reflect this and people just hit the damn trail and get elf quests done. People shouldn't be fucking worried about making ~10 hours (GENEROUS for UPass, Regicide, MEP 1+2 and Roving Elves) of questing go faster. It's supposed to be a journey.
---
Besides, people shouldn't feel locked out of this content, this poll for SOTE happened months ago and it was very obvious you'd have to finish all the other elf quests first. If people procrastinated and you give them an easy way out, you're going to just give them no reason not to procrastinate next time, and they're just going to assume they'll get another easy way to do shit again.

So many crybaby bitches in here. “Nobody likes these” no. You just hear about people not liking it because the people who don’t like it complain. The people who do like them usually don’t have much to say about it

Ironically, that's the reason most people are at Zulrah

I enjoy the challenge of solo and I never cared for being efficient or making the most gp/hr, just the way I enjoy the game I suppose

And I have a hardcore in the works and need to be prepared for when I get to bandos

This bwana has got 150m worth of bird nests in his bank lmao
---
just spend 4 hours picking mort myre fungi and you can afford a bond. put all other cash into training slayer/combat for now and work toward barrows. If you need breaks, do quests. 14 days is plenty of time to pick fungi. you can spread it out and do like 10 trips a day or grind it out if you really want. Or pay IRL :P
---
 green drags ain't too bad either as phantom mentioned, but can be demotivating if you get pked
---
its not the same when you inside a instance area, it instantly lost

You'd think by now you should know you can't use banks...

Do you know this from experience?

Ikr? You'd almost expect a shitstorm like that for Runescape but nope. I love y'all

Unfortunately the app does not support a mouse so it might not work just plugging it in. My S7 would not work properly doing so. There was an app I used that allowed it but I cant remember what it was.

that’s not how math works lmao

They should randomly generate it for every player. No guide can help you now.

No it fucking isn't. It's dogshit. And I mean that because it's boring and poorly made

It's not necessary, but other than NMZ (which having it there doesn't make sense anyways) the only other reasonable ways to get the eggs in any kind of bulk require Venenatis grinds, or ToL grinds
---
First off you definitely don’t need a different account specifically for pking, in certain combat brackets? Maybe, but most of the time you can still come up with a set up that will work recently as long as you know what you’re doing. Second, training an account to 70 stats does not take that long at all, neither does taking one or a few stats to 90+, if you can’t handle that this probably just isn’t the game for you
---
yes.
---
if you're going to use it, dont worry about its price and just keep it

if you're not using it, may as well sell because you're not using it

So people who don't want to do the quest don't do the gaubtlet or zalcano

Jagex do exactly the opposite of what he just said. Else we're gonna see a massive rise in rope + crude chair prices, perhaps also invest into nature and fire runes.

There really aren't any non-catastrophic attack vectors on Runelite w.r.t user login information. Client settings are stored in their servers and authenticated via OA2 and google accounts, but they don't store Runescape login information as part of that - it's stored on the user's PC.

How are you still not understanding this? People complain *constantly* about Regicide, Underground Pass and MEP2. 
---
Are you looking for dozens of posts that say "Jagex poll this!" because that isn't what's happening here. Jagex sees people complaining a lot about something, so they poll it to see what the community has to say. Only polling stuff that you, personally, find important isn't feasible and it is unfair. 
---
I'm actually shocked that you fail to understand that
---
Fantastic argument
---
You've swayed my opinion
---
They didn’t when I did the quest a few months ago, the wiki recommended using the interface as a safe spot since they won’t attack you

To think I paid for youtube premium for like half a year before trying out vanced lmao. Loving that dark theme too.
---
When I first saw the requirements for this quest, that's exactly what I thought - difficult for the sake of difficult.  Rather than have a quest with varied requirements that are appropriately scaled to what the character needs to do, let's make them all a hard, no-boost 70.
---
Better yet, let's pick skills that almost no other quest requires at that level - Agility 70 (previous high: 63), Construction 70 (50), Farming 70 (46), Herblore 70 (53), Hunter 70 (60), Mining 70 (67), Smithing 70 (70), Woodcutting 70 (66).
---
Did you give your camera acid?
---
Yes man I want this difficult as shit. Give me something that will rack my brain until I'm finally ready to end it all.
---
but who even does mep2
---
That's true, you're more comfortable in familiar surroundings

If there is no RISK, there is so no gain.

Ohhh I knew that... But how do you constantly get those tasks tho? Lol. I thought you meant magic does high damage now you can use that as your main way to DPS instead of melee or BP

F#
---
...I liked the first light puzzle in concept. The issues are that it's difficult to make it out because the interaction points are far away, and as you unlock more of it and scale it up, it's never really a puzzle. You always have every piece needed to solve it and no extra. It's kind of like walking down a corridor, c there's no branching paths.
---
I Lost 30k on law runes
---
I stand by the idea that the puzzle isn't at fault for the bad rep MEP2 gets, it's the interrupting shadows and the high fail rate agility obstacles that make the quest stressful and frustrating.
---
The puzzle itself is good. Take away the shadows and you'd never hear a single person complain about MEP2.
---
I recently did the MEP2 mostly without a guide and I really liked the light puzzle. But it was still very frustrating for two reasons:
---
1) The shadows constantly attacking. I don't know how you're supposed to be able to think and figure out a puzzle when constantly under attack.
---
2) The green and magenta crystals being locked in pillars without any indication that this was the case. This was especially egregious with the magenta crystal. The magenta crystal is in a little room you can't reach so there is no way to know it's there until you're desperate and putting light anywhere you can reach it. This wouldn't be as bad if you know about the green crystal because then you know there is precedent for crystals to be set in pillars, BUT the puzzle doesn't use the green crystal until after you've used the magenta one. So again, you have no idea it's even a possibility unless you happen to click on the pillar with the green crystal.
---
I think that if they design the puzzle well, then the MEP3 light puzzle could be a lot less frustrating and less hated than the MEP2 one.
---
IT'S MA'AM
---
\&gt; You know you're wrong 
---
Then I must be a very skilled liar, since I've established, supported, and defended a point whereas you failed to do any of that, and as such there is no reason to believe your argument has any substance to it, whereas there is plenty of foundation for mine.  If you want to imagine a world where you were actually right, be my guest - but if you were capable of doing that, you wouldn't still be responding to me.
---
\&gt; You know you're wrong - it appears someone else has cited the sources as they aren't on mobile. 
---
And I've explained why their sources aren't sources of a community request for this feature, they are free to reply to me if they want to discuss it further.  Since you were unable to even take the first step of providing some sources, I believe my business with you has ended long ago.
---
\&gt; It is unbelievable how such a trivial change has evoked this evisceral response not only from you but from other people as well. 
---
Dude take a look in a mirror lmao you've been sitting here spouting off as much as me.  I started this argument with a literal one sentence statement lmao.  Difference is you're just spouting empty words that you've yet to substantiate.  
---
I see you're in the "why do you even care that much, loser!" stage of argument loss grief.  Good luck coping.
---
\&gt; There is little to zero common sense here and I am wasting my time. 
---
You could always try making sense if you feel like your bs is wasting your time.  Personally I extract some amusement out of it so I'm good either way.
---
I’m guessing you’re new to osrs so welcome noobie. Seeing as how you’re a noobie, let me tell you that lava is unlocked at level 23.
---
&gt; Pyromancer outfit.
---
So Supply Crates work a little differently from a normal drop table, link [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Supply_crate).
---
In short, it does a roll on each "tier", where Pyromancers are on the 6th tier. If you do hit the Bruma Torch/Gloves tier, it just means that you rolled them at the same chance, but it doesn't mean that you would have got Pyroamncer gear.
---
As other post said, you're just unlucky.
---
maybe his cat stepped on the keyboard
---
I'm not saying cut it but why not make it actually require some effort to get the items? Maybe I need to kill a dragon or go through a dungeon. Getting items from the bank is pointless.
---
I block fires, it’s a long task with shit GP and high nieve/duradel weighting.
---
Item prices often rising due to merching but eventually, it gets so high, people to want to sell off and then people don't want to have a bunch of items that will lose value so then all sell off.
---
It could even be X
---
Dude is like a diving bot. Way richer than you and the government does nothing to stop him

Well nobody likes rune crafting I would like a more interesting way to train it, not necessarily faster but more engaging
---
Yay another SOLO boss in a supposed MMO. Because if you are a new player and new to pvm you definitely should go about it alone. You don’t even lose gear anymore so what’s the point of the gear return mechanic on everything? I remember accidentally exploring into kq lair in rs2 and 3 iteming into kbd just so you could see what the boss looked like with your equally stupid friends. That’s how you RuneScape, not this every new boss is instanced into single way combat and we UPS your gear back to you if you die.
---
Erm thats content in the wilderness that is designed to be used by non pkers, yes theres a risk of being pked but i think im allowed to hate them.
---
As an ironman i need the wilde largely for the chaos altar/lava dragons/clues/rune shop etc

When I start playing again I'll have to check it out, sounds cool
---
No deal Noel no deal
---
Sorry. Just gained my breath back.

It was just a joke.

some people don't have time to actively play, so its better to gain some pretty afk cb xp than it is to gain nothing. once ur max melee u can make gold a lot easier anyway
---
Is there a reliable guide to installing runelite?
---
Have you ever considered polling F2P snare? Since teleblock is F2P, it wouldn't hurt to poll a level 50 spell being made F2P.
---
Separately poll yew bows and rune arrows too?
---
The plot justification is that you need to work your way through the temple's ancient defences to access the death altar, so that you can use the altar's to re-seal the place and prevent the mourners from accessing it.
---
Ah, alt account, was wondering about that.
---
\&gt; People complain *constantly* about Regicide, Underground Pass and MEP2.
---
And how many of those people complain about either the 50 items or request the number of items is lowered?  None of them in your links, as I've explained.
---
\&gt; Are you looking for dozens of posts that say "Jagex poll this!" because that isn't what's happening here. 
---
Yeah, I am.  The original statement that you're trying to defend is: " If enough people request that to be polled then it should be polled. ".  Are any of the people you cited requesting this to be polled?
---
Are they, yes or no?  I'm making this real easy, since I'm shocked that you fail to understand this.
---
Give this guy a nobel prize
---
I liked Underground Pass too.  There was just a rawness about the design of the pass itself that was very appealing to me.  Some levels and maps are very contrived, efficient, and simply functional, and the underground pass actually felt like what you'd expect - twisting paths and caverns, heavily trapped and filled with ugly and horrific things.
---
S
---
They also polled option to skip whole underground pass after completion of quest, but you need to go through it during regicide twice and they want to remove that
---
Just wait until you get home from school
---
Just looked it up and yes!

Casual games now start with 4 players after 30 seconds.
---
Now if they could add custom lms, with more maps, and customizable items, stats, prayers and spellbooks, THEN we'd have a real PvP scene.
---
Maybe you're good as fuck at a certain bracket, but trash at another. It would all go back to player skill since lms would be the great equalizer.
---
Custom lms could allow different PvP brackets and more  diverse competition.
---
I meant more so the fact you can't have multiple characters (your character IS your account), which is only mentioned at the end. Of course my ignorance is also to blame, but I launched it to try it out and didn't really expect that to be the case.
---
I try to avoid knowing how much time ive played this game.
---
You don't block them because they are low weight compared to other bad Slayer tasks.
---
Grandmaster quest. Either you have challenging boss or a puzzle (or both).
---
No body plays trouble brewing, so you just need to get lucky if you're 1 of the 5 pple who brew ales in this game. hence why a ale made out of 4 chocolate dusts cost me 60k when I boosted for barrows gloves.
---
Nice but would be better without the last panel
---
Rune make bad
---
Got bp early (89 kc), but went 1770 kc for magic fang
---
Doubt this is true, but otherwise, thanks for saving my hands while I go for 99 thieving, as wmk is 100% not bannable.
---
Yeah and OSRS makes a lot of money too, the problem is that OSRS bond money gets redirected to RS3, only membership money stays on the OSRS side of things. 
---
Source: know a JMod who told me this.
---
In other words, even if we cut RS3 entirely and killed it off, let’s just assume 30% of the players would switch to OSRS and the remaining 70% would go to similar games to RS3 like League or WoW, we’re keeping more of our bond revenue to OSRS and adding 30% (on average) of RS3’s revenue to OSRS. To me it makes sense that even if it’s an overall loss of money, there’s less resources that need to be managed with a simpler game like OSRS, in other words, OSRS is a lot cheaper to run and by cutting RS3, they might make less per year but they might actually profit more per year if that makes sense.
---
Hai and welcome to my guide
---
Meat good
---
yeah so fun, buy tomatoes from the GE and wait a day...
---
You are dumb lol this game is for kids and you are complaining that it's too hard to understand. 50 bucks says you're african american.
---
No authenticator delay bad.
---
it is your decision to finish clue, you are not forced to do it, you can get all clue scroll rewards and never enter wilderness.
---
I actually got the pet on my uim and lost it due to a lagspike.. :(
---
Turoths I like, but firegiants and dagannoths can just go fuck a rope.
---
It seriously bothers me how much Jagex is trying to push these Ironman-friendly updates. Ironmen choose to limit themselves and shouldn’t have updates directly catering to them. Updates like the sandstone grinder are fine because it at least provided some use to otherwise dead content, but fixing what isn’t really broken feels unnecessary
---
Now this should be polled lol
---
Max cape btw
---
Phishing has been been a problem for a long time. I remember it being a massive problem in 2008-2009. 
---
Nothing much anyone can do other than not click external links on Facebook and YouTube.
---
I mean if runelite had a RAT you could literally watch them login and take your stuff. There would be concrete evidence. Database leaks- on people with no authenticator- just happen. At any time on any computer. IMO they're the more dangerous threat, and they're thwarted by auth.
---
But have we ever had a smacktown with so much drama? the potential is astounding.
---
No I just don't want knob heads playing the game
---
[True](https://youtu.be/1dCD3EyPK-0)
---
Ok thanks my dude, I was making it more complicated than it needed to be
---
Judging by your attitude, i'm not surprised you feel that everyone is toxic to you. I sympathise with anyone who is unfortunate enough to get into the same team as you, must be difficult having to carry a slow and mentally deficient moron.
---
Song has to wait though...
---
Is it on RS3? Also this is what billing support is for, not Reddit.
---
I didn't know you could go to Jagex for elementary school
---
Yup. Ok, maybe not 50 times, but it does have a pretty nasty learning curve. Once you learn all the rotations, where to stand, what to pray, and really start to understand the max hits (41 from zulrah, 15 from snakelings) it becomes a whole lot easier.
---
The easiest ways to check your ping are to use the RuneLite world switcher (it shows ping) or to google it and download a .bat file that checks your ping on all worlds. If you don't use runelite and don't trust a random .bat from the web, then you can check it manually. Hold down your windows key and hit r, type in cmd, hit enter. Type in "ping oldschool(world#-300).runescape.com", hit enter. For example, to check your ping on world 302 it'd be ping oldschool2.runescape.com , or to check your ping on 416 it'd be ping oldschool116.runescape.com .
---
Nieve is easier to get to than Konar lol
---
South East corner, second level...33 times in a row at 70 agility.
---
&gt;it should be called the SufferRing
---
_Harvard wants to know your location_
---
Yeah I agree they should stand by rs3 out of loyalty to the time invested by existing players. 
---
But I do feel that old school should be developed and presented as jagex’s primary product.
---
Secret is weed
---
What is your setup/strategy for afk NMZ at work?
---
I didnt the entire elf series with no struggle other than the bloody handholds in MEP2. 
---
Yea its a bitch having to go through underground pass a second or third time, but if you plan ahead its completely avoidable. And its not even that bad. Train your agility
---
[So this is how mods were looking at eachother when Mod Ed said that.](https://i.gifer.com/7zUS.mp4)

I always bring runescape signs/clothes for at least one of the days at festies like hula and shit 🤣

---
Happy cake day chief!
---
You could've been famous by now
---
I agree. It's not a huge hassle for either ironmen, but definitely more so for UIM than regular.
---
I for one do not care, but for the sake of integrity (or "EZscape reee", if you will) I do not welcome the change.
---
Started doing birdhouse runs and I’m wondering what’s the use of birds nests?
---
Then perhaps an MMORPG is not the game for you anymore, you need to play something that you can get more out of playing in a smaller time frame. MMORPG's are not the game to play if you do not have as much free time as before.
---
Are you feeling any urges to roll a pure? If so I'll dial 911
---
Quest good
---
Puzzle bad
---
What part of mep2 had this?
---
People were saying about the crazy agility stuff in mep2  but when I did the quest there was the handholds and that was about itm
---
How are dags at watetbirth fantastic? Can't even cannon and the drops are shit
---
There can only be a finite amount of possible combinations. 
---
Sounds like true challenge for slayermusiq1
---
Do you have the “perfect mold”
---
Probably a Venezuelan.
---
Thank you so much
---
ah just was wondering, thank you for your response!
---
I don't know if you think you're being smart or not (you aren't) but i'm not the one that got ultra defensive and felt the need to type out an entire paragraph because his feelings got hurt. Now *that's* funny.
---
Having runelite highligh the click boxes for obstacles makes agility so braindead. I probably wouldn't be over 70 without it
---
Lunar magic (contact NPC) or 58 agility with boosts bro. Profit margin is significantly higher
---
That's what I've done, yeah. Was just quiet annoying to learn is all. Just as another nooby question, why is Free-to-Play more boring? I know Membership adds more content, but surely you can get through the F2P content first?
---
death runes and dragon claws failed already 😂
---
Duradel gives the longest tasks in the game
---
Here's a wild idea. Go to a community center/library and pay 10 cents a page to print the guide off. *GASP*
---
Loling
---
They’re a secondary for Sara Brews, which makes them expensive. Best to sell them on the GE if you aren’t an Iron Man.
---
Yea, those details are definitely neat. I also find the mininalistic playstyle rather satisfying most of the time - even if it means dropping duplicates once in a while.
---
Used in herblore.
---
I guess your supposed to trap or kill the shadows  but when there's more than one it's just like
---
Wtf? Am I not supposed to be able to open a single interface in this puzzle?
---
I *never* want to see another stealth section in an RS quest. Whether it's going for Goutweed, the platform of MM2, or Ratcatcher's pure *bullshit....* ugh.
---
Haha get it? Cause RC is slow?
---
Yeah I agree that everything should be balanced correctly, but every update the osrs team has put out so far has been great. 
---
And tbh the amount of good community backed ideas I see just on this subreddit all the time makes me think the team could definitely do with a few more developers just so they can realistically keep up.
---
What is this abomination?
---
I just want a different puzzle. I've done that shitty quest enough times, I don't understand why they are recycling such a poorly designed puzzle for. Christ even MM2 at least bothered to change the puzzles from MM1.
---
The number I gave is based on my experience in practically empty lobbies, doing nothing but running resources
---
This... This is the OSRS subreddit right? Agility is easy as fuck with runelite.
---
Don’t worry about it, I do this all the time 
---
I mean OWO
---
Rename the quest to Mournings End part 3
---
That's just Reddit for you
---
You gotta get a feel for how the thread thinks as a whole then comment what you think will get upvoted, not what you actually think.
---
Like now, in this thread, you can say you like puzzles, because that's what the echo chamber is saying
---
I’m pretty sure slightly “better” Nieve tasks =/= profit margin or slayer point gain of Konar. Not entirely sure but that’s just what I’ve seen
---
Cry about it stupid
---
What do you mean? You're doing the same tasks as you normally would but making extra money
---
What a dumb opinion
---
if you wanna be an edge lord at least make good offensive memes, this is just shit and dry of humor.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/GuqPt3s
---
I agree with that point for sure, a good Nieve task can stand to offer more benefits than a normal Konar task. But from personal experience, I get more shit tasks than good ones so it turns mundane tasks into far better ones with brim keys. As far as specifically DKs, if you have the combat to kill them efficiently you’re not using Nieve or Konar
---
I was doing blast furnace for awhile before I got slayer up. Easy to do on mobile and make like 600k an hour doing steel bars. Can make a little more doing mithril.
---
Look at the wiki money making guides, it will give you options for members and f2p and will list the required and recommended skills. 😄
---
Generally speaking the best money makers are bosses and slayer, best non combat related money makers are farming and runecrafting. 🤗
---
Honestly the second text should be Chaelder’s initial message. Then you go to check what she meant... desert lizards...
---
Why would anyone use a client other than runelite osbuddy or vanilla. I know there’s an older one I’m forgetting but outside of those, why would anyone download any other client? The logical answer is cheating, that’s why everyone’s sat here accusing you.
---
Lol fyi most people who participate in pvp also pk in the ways you've described there is no skill difference between them. My clan mates and I do both
---
Or you had above minimum agility. The fail rate is extremely high for minimum agility, but scales up strongly as you level it up.  Quest was a breeze at 70 agility
---
Jujimufu is the dude!
---
I have a regular Sara sword I bought for 1.4 mil in February, seeing them at 800k hurts my soul.
---
You’d be surprised how many people want it to stay like this
---
Oh wow does he work for Jagex? Or was this like a community design thing lol
---
Well there's not really any hunting worth doing as IM, so you can just let it slowly level up as you max the other skills
---
Opinion: If your title has the same text as your body, your opinion is invalid.
---
Why are you carrying your bank in your inventory?
---
My clan and i do too you fk w/ me I fk w/ you. Vote no to our polls guess who also gets the no
---
1. Tie Warding with Firemaking (makes fires actually useful) by creating wards with fires, better tiers creates better wards. 
---
2. Get rid of unnecessarily complicating stuff (soapstones, monoliths, runic energy/vis, battlewards) and keep the lamps.
---
3. Make the lamps chargable at Runecrafting altars for different types of wards with unique uses (crafting magic robes, imbuing, dissolving, etc.)
---
4. Also throw in some runecrafter robes plz because those were sexy af back in the day.
---
Hackers are getting more creative.
---
It's been over two weeks, people are just talking about it now because of the blog post.
---
They aren't really comparable imo, the docks in MM2 with a guide takes 20 minutes for anyone who isn't a brainlet or playing on 1000 ping. Endgame only takes as long as it does because the physical distance you have to cover is so  fukken gigantic, makes the docks look like Melzar's Maze.
---
Can we pay Hatius Cosaintus 10m to come in and complete the song of elves light puzzle for us
---
Thank you. 
---
+ I definitely agree they should invest way more in osrs. The game is a gem.
---
Also it’d be good to be reassured that a fair share of jagex’s profits goes towards ensuring the osrs jmods are paid well enough.
---
I have a girlfriend, I’m sure she’d be willing to help to save me time from grinding out gp
---
I don't want to see this type of info.
---
Ultimate Ironman what??!?
---
I killed dark beasts for a death tally 4Head, fk running around gathering items
---
Go do waterfall quest for quick combat exp boost, and imo get Fairytale Pt. 1 done asap to start farming using magical secateurs. Herb runs and slayer are a great way to get the money rolling in, don't be discouraged if slayer is slow to start, it eventually picks up.
---
reminder that you can store cash in NMZ
---
what bosses did rs2 have that shit out resources like zulrah and vorkath???
---
I can understand what you're implying though, to me personally, OSRS died when they removed free trade and the wild, it just was on it's deathbed afterwards. The graphics update to make the dscim look like a dildo and the whip to not look like the whip, I really don't care for any of that. That being said, even up to EOC.. What bosses shit out resources like the current ones do?
---
PVP definitely had more of an impact back then on the economy. Clans were active, the scene was alive. Maybe you weren't apart of it? I'm not sure.
---
Oh God, no.... The flashbacks.
---
fuck that
---
Lost 150m in 2 weeks on it, made 700m in 2 weeks with it
---
i used to keylog the same way eventually just put duds at the end of the sharecash link to generate passive bread

What gear are you using?

I don't always panic at the mine

why do you you censor yourself? this is the internet and you have freedom of speech. What are you 13?

Don’t fuckin mess m with my Kalphite slayer helm...
---
Well first of all, we don't still make fricking **fire** runes at level 47...
---
Looks like it's too fat in hand
---
RC has 77+ better than agility imo. And mining too, although mining is quick at least (free RSI included).
---
Honestly they’re all cool
---
Im failing to understand the logic of your argument.
---
When you refer to "getting more" out of play time, are you referring to the intrinsic value assigned to enjoyment of the game or the tangible gains in xp or gp as a result of optimal efficiency?
---
If the former, you're arguing a moot point. Osrs is the most entertaining game I've ever played, regardless of how long my play sessions are. It's been that way when I was a child. It is still that way now as an adult.
---
If the latter, again, your argument is invalid unless you can find a way to take xp and gp gains for a given amount of play time and directly translate that number to either real monies or comparative gains for a different game.
---
But, as you're suggesting something other than an rpg, this comparison of gain/time cannot be done.
---
Tl;dr: I like RuneScape; your argument is invalid.
---
Wrong post. Lol
---
Sure but the halo is always best for Prayer bonus. Save the switch and the time and just main slot a halo.
---
Honestly once you get the teleport crystal, you'll never go through the pass again. I've gone through it 3 times and that's it
---
cool cool cool, should I max my runecrafting while I'm at it?
---
I see. Adding an interactive/fun alternative to the current (and only) repetitive/tedious method. That I support 100%.
---
Ok send me your credit card info Incase jagex needs some verification
---
I’m not shaming someone. They’re saying Konar is better, that is objectively wrong.
---
They don't look cute or cuddly in any way shape or form.
---
Is there something I am missing with Ranarr herb runs? I have magic secateurs and none of my patches were diseased. Seeds cost like... 151k and the herbs cost 168k (170k cleaned). I heard that it was a decent money maker but htat's pretty bad. Is there something I may be missing?
---
Damn, remember when we couldn't even swear on RuneScape. Wild times 😂
---
Not quite. You go from 11.7% at 56 to 17.7% at 70. 
---
See https://mobile.twitter.com/jagexkieren/status/700383893652955140?lang=en

Lmao i love the little spoon necklace he has! I wonder what thats for?
---
This right here is the only reason you would go that high and even then you only need 83. 72 is all you need for the portal nexus.
---
MEP2
---
Wrong. The higher level portal nexi can have more teleports, with crystalline able to direct to every location.
---
I'll take my down votes with a side of salty tears thanks man.

It sure will!
---
Sounds like someone is a bit salty they didn't make the big boy gp. Again thanks for backing up my statement with math though. Happy scaping.
---
Max slot portal nexus, he literally wrote it in the post.
---
The level 72 nexus only can hold 4 teleports.
---
tl:dr?
---
What are you attacking?
---
Cyan translucent shades is so aestetically pleasing.
---
You can buy bonds in the grandexchange for 4m every 14 days
---
Ill add you later tonight when i get on! Good luck!

I've gotten a lot better for sure. Learned jad and zulrah a hell of a lot quicker than this three headed ugly dog
---
50 cents is 710k
---
Cause fuck bringing an axe
---
Oh yea, ice boxes. Annoying as hell
---
I’m not because MEp2 was enjoyable for me solving the puzzle with a friend doing it at the same time.
---
I’m down for quests that aren’t dynamic because they’re a LOT more fun with people.
---
I saw him too, the other side of the sign said “buying gf”
---
Personally I think the max portal nexus is definitely worth it if you can afford it. Very convenient.
---
NOT TO REDDIT
---
Depends if you're picking fruit too. I see so many people that cut like mahogany's on fossil island, and drop them. Like just pay to cut the tree down, why cut 28 logs?
---
I got banned for having the name 25\_buttholes! Screw twitch its all about youtube live
---
I saw one in runescape and wanted to share with someone who had hunter high enough but have no friends
---
It looks so trash, why couldn't they add similar features to firemaking or something? If they're gonna add a new skill, it better be a good one. There are already several shit-tier skills. I will buy a bond when the poll starts if I'm not consistently playing then, so that I can vote no.

Can you move the Draynor Agility shortcut to the fence along Draynor Manor where the fountain is for easy access from Fally farm patch to the Belladonna patch?

Okay well obviously there’s extreme verbal abuse, and then there are some words where the word alone is sacred and should never be said. Like Voldemort
---
just make CTC3, 4, and 5 steps in the quest lol

Yea I get it all the time

Can confirm. Herbis are great especially after you memorize the routes.

---
If you ever feel like trying an RS game again, RS3 does have a faster progression system
---
Indeed, it's an inside joke regarding anglers outfit
---
Are you actually so delusional that you think the early game is easier because ironman gets a set of armor?
---
Blocked, holy shit.

Oh my bad didn't realize that was 92. Thanks.

Allow us to collect black marks of grace from non-rooftop courses and everyone will be happy.

It surely does not beat the xp/hr of blackjacking, ardy knights, or PP (after high enough lvl)  right?
---
I think one of the requirements is for the login screen to be mirrored down the middle afaik they’ve all been like that

So that one phone is the one and only screen in their whole apartment/house?

no real goal in mind tbh. Just something chill so I can chat with friends and what not.

Was west, not wolf. Damn W's :P
---
The wiki has a moneymakingguide for everything. Raning from killing chickens to non-profitable methods such as casting spin flax
---
No need for the max nexus unless you just want to have a fancy house. Tbh I still just use portals, there's only like 6 teles I use anyways.
---
I'd stop at 83 and see how you feel.
---
I have a 155m bank and am considering getting rigour. Is rigour worth spending 53m on so I can raid and boss more effectively?
---
Tell me what he proved me wrong about.
---
It's about 15m right? I feel like it could be worth the investment if I like the convenience. I guess it's one of those things that I'll never get a full return from though.
---
Wrong ***according to what you like***.
---
Finally someone understands.
---
There's a custom message for using a pet on a slayer master and I have no idea if it's some kind of reference.
---
Definitely deserved
---
The plague is a lie anyways
---
Woosh right over my head haha thanks
---
Didn’t start really pvming until I was maxed. Had max gear and stats and still struggled. Stick with it and you’ll succeed soon!
---
It makes me so sad to see someone act like you do..... I can't imagine how you treat the people you know personally. I feel sorry for them.
---
I just skip them, you get more points doing any other 2 tasks in the time it takes to kill 4 of those things
---
Ok pal. It’s literally worse xp, points and money. You’re clearly like 1500 total and know nothing about the game so there’s no point.
---
I'd agree - make it a real achievement to complete the quest!
---
It would be painful, but I think it'd be worth it
---
Then unlock the autokill option from the reward shops
---
Lmfao this shit has me dying, jagex needs to do this for 😂
---
I mentioned the summer pie because that's what I actually used.
---
And it does scale strongly.  Going from 56 to 70 increases your chance of success by 51%.  70 to 80 is a 138% increase.  In what world is this not strongly scaling?
---
Does anyone ever watch these?
---
Do the permanent one, you get 5 or 6 hours of pvp protection. Do plenty of quests like Dragon Slayer, Waterfall Quest, and other quests which give combat exp.
---
lol not even close to zulrah 1 defense fight can last under a minute with all the food gone.
---
ironmen don't get combat xp from pvp
---
I'd try it out, but they'd eventually probably wreck it like os
---
I used to be scared of pkers until I learned that one simple trick that stumps them: black dhide.
---
The pkers at wildy bosses are so shit that putting on black dhide and basic prayer flicking will get you out of there 90% of the time. I've even killed a few with my pvm gear because they don't know how to deal with someone who actually fights back.
---
It has worked fine for 14 years.
---
As a somewhat new player wiki guides are way slower. Quick quest guides are vague and just say go meet up with x, and i dont know who that is so i spent time looking up where he is etc..
---
Slayermusiq just tells you everything you need to know.

Like OS or like RS3 you mean? And if you mean OS, what makes you feel like it’s “wrecked”?

anyone else seeing that it has jmod reply but not seeing a jmod comment?

Another addition to the challenge: Finish MEP3 using a soup guide
---
I've tweeted them a few times about it as well and I have not received a response. It's unfortunate because it basically just makes the entry gap for new you tubers even higher, since we can't make as high quality of videos as those who already have it.
---
How do you do this?
---
This and Herblore are my lowest skills because I have no idea how to really grind those skills.
---
Gotta activate that windows bud
---
Yeah exactly the “HOLY SHIT NINE OBSTACLES AND YOU HAVE TO PASS THEM ALL IN A ROW OR START OVER!!!” Complaints you are all these 1500 totals whining about is actually one obstacle that needs to be passed twice in total
---
Yeah Friend, I get a few clicks. I got a small subscriber base, Gotta advertise and start somewhere. Gotta keep the grind going til I get famous!
---
My thoughts exactly when they released the requirements way back.  They just took the skills that had previously low quest requirements and upped them to 70.  Quest requirements were traditionally gradual creep.  I guess they tossed that tradition now that we only get like 1 quest per year.
---
What is the easiest way to get into and finish a game of chambers of xeric?  I need for elite diary. I’m 90+ combat stats and I’m just sitting here on world 365

I value the QOL lol, hoping to a crowded poh world and having to find a host is annoying.
---
The last part of the story (MEP2) was released in october 2005, seems like enough time for people to have caught up
---
Looks really bland, like some generic quest item.
---
They're a much better buy than tassets and prims. So if you think either one of those is a good buy/upgrade, then you're just dumb to not think fero gloves are.
---
Agreed, I think if RS3 died out entirely they could move the whole RS3 team over to the OSRS team and have enough people to make RS2HD a thing again.
---
I love this, got the link to number 1?

Unpopular opinion but I liked RuneScape in 2006-7. No grand exchange or tons of new items, and the interface changes that make things easier. And wintertodt? C'mon, how is that supposed to be fm training? It's just a new game with a RuneScape skin. The day of oldschools release was as close as we got to what we voted for, downhill since
---
RS3 had light puzzles in their precursor to the priff quest (between MEP2 and the price unlock). However, all of those light puzzles were small enough that the whole puzzle rendered on screen at once. If Song of the Elves went in that direction, I think it would be much better received.
---
I play guitar and G flat doesn't exist
---
Ah yes, everything would be much better if everyone was homophobic and racist without any negative consequences.
---
I don't follow the issue you have with it.  It's supposed to be unpredictable.  It won't always take the same amount of time.  And what do you mean it's no different? No different than what?
---
Imo it's not, unless you have scythe.
---
Aren't quests unlocked after a few days? Also is dmm permanent just ran by clans?
---
Doesn't matter if no one is playing. You can run 100 buckets of water in just a minute and then AFK for the rest of the 20 minute game, collect your 100 points, and buy two packets of The Stuff. Takes zero effort and 20 minutes for The Stuff plus 5 minutes to run to the two brewing vats and start your brews. After a day or two, both vats are probably mature and you just made some nice coin.
---
&gt; That's how magic always has been
---
Well Staff of Light was released last year sooo
---
You may not like it, but peak male performance is being able to read and click accordingly in a dated java game.
---
the constant easyscape updates and forced new content that makes it feel nothing like the game did in 2007, or even in 2013 when osrs came out
---
Then what is Wintertodt ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°,)
---
Pretty sure they have more devs than OSRS, it would be huge for the community. Their player count is getting less and less stable too, so maybe one day.
---
No, I did cooks assistant immediately on dmm. And no i dont think it is, I’ve only played dmm for like 3 hours total.
---
I’m glad you enjoyed the sketch! I’m happy you liked it enough to clean it up so nicely, he looks so good colored in!
---
I just did exactly this. I haven't played since '08 and got back into it via mobile. Just last week I finished Dragon Slayer and then bought a membership. Having the membership beforehand would have made some quests easier, but it was a fun goal for me to have and it was very rewarding. Now I'm enjoying exploring all the members content knowing that the F2P quests are done.
---
I've had an idea for POH. It's called "The Pit". You can build it at level 1 and all it requires is a spade to build. It's a pit then you fling gold into it for xp. Having it be roughly 25 GP/Xp would have it be much less efficient than any training method but save players from having to mash 1 and 4 on their number pad for hours on end.
---
Why are people saying homophobic slurs being punished? ah gee I dunno... what a horrible thing!! right??
---
That sucks, think it's time to stop trying to get it yourself and just buy it from the GE.
---
People actually were mad when fish got added to Runescape because of how it ruined cooking. You used to have to prepare real shit now you can just use all the fish on fires and that's how cooking stayed. Look at the gnome restaurant crap, that's how all cooking used to be.
---
Why are you making underground pass and mep2 easier then?
---
Oh I 100% agree, I’m a 2011scape guy myself but even I could appreciate the authentic, pure old school feel of the original 2007 servers. A JMod I know described the Blowpipe like this to me: “it feels like something straight out of a private server”. There are some good design choices in new content, then there’s weird shit like you mentioned and the Blowpipe. I’d rather play with Chaotics and Nex than have Zulrah and Blowpipes.
---
Agreed! That's why I'd say QoL things are ahead of rigour in this priority: main budget gear &gt; 83 Con &gt; Rigour &gt; Big fear upgrades

Join the we do raids discord and wait for a beginner session to be advertised
---
I see, thanks!
---
Fair point I agree 100%.
---
I was joking lmao
---
Ah damn I only planned on getting 199.3m so guess I won't go for it.
---
Don't get it?
---
The sketch was too perfect!
---
No idea honestly, the steel dragons was the first task that I paused when it got assigned and just said “fuck”.
---
Luckily I had decent magic and just used Ibans blast. Took about 2 hours to complete it lol.
---
I know a couple people who will happily kill you now. Congrats. :)

If it takes fishing skill to get, it's a fish.
---
Well shit, why didn't I think of that :(
---
Could you display as pet examine text, at what kc or skill lvl a player got said pet? If yes, would these be retroactive?
---
Amen.  Normies 1 LothricsLegs 0
---
Before I could grow dragonfruit I specifically grew palm trees for Herblore, and that made Herblore go by incredibly quickly on a low budget. 
---
But I am at a high enough total where every skill is going to take some time to work on and I can’t possibly work everything at once. Taking small opportunities to gain some xp in other skills while working on a main skill goes a long way too. 
---
And it interesting working those skills I would find the game boring otherwise.
---
This, coins replace your axe, and now you have gp on you for buying plant cure or the spade / dibber you forgot.
---
I wouldn't say its unpopular, sure the puzzles suck but its necessary for Oldschool.

Or the tale of fossil islands ship is hysterical too

Ah cool. Thanks!

You, sir, are a godsend. Finally quests are reasonably doable on mobile.
---
This is exactly what I do
---
I checked out like 15 minutes of a random stream and he said he would never go to Mexico because it isn't safe due to the "types of people" there. Even when he isn't being explicit, Alfie is just a regressive guy.
---
Guardian uniques outside of the properly priced one are like what, gloves and a hammer? Slightly better than a combat bracelet and a leaf bladed battleaxe? How much do you expect that shit to cost? Don’t forget people kill it for the cannonballs too
---
I agree that something like obor shouldn’t have a pet but the rationale of more efficient players “ruining” the gp/hr of a low gp/hr boss is kind of a stretch, and the guardian analogy is straight up false
---
Looks like a lot of fun!

Through a series of unfortunate events Jenkins the pirate was hit in the back with an arrow, had his bones turned to bananas, and had monkeys rain down on him "having their way with him". His sword was untouched however so it must be lucky.

Okay thanks that makes a lot of sense.

No. This sub reddit comes up with some garbage ideas Jesus christ

G...wait a sec
---
Everything works on it and it’s very OP, I just don’t trust they won’t exit scam
---
36 Farming, Ultracompost yes and yes I was wielding magic secateurs. I got 27 Ranarrs/4 Patches so 6.75 average for that particular run. I plan to keep doing them and keep an eye out but the margin seemed really low
---
Probably gave his meat a good ol' rub with some spices.
---
Everything is crashing, and when everything is no one wants to keep items so it just escalates.
---
Yeah, generally all ship ones are pretty hilarious. Even the Lunar Diplomacy Ship section. Another really great one is Fremennik Isles, especially if you come with all of the required items before they actually ask you for them.
---
Just buy it from the shop at fishing trawler lmfao
---
But did you run into [this](http://i.imgur.com/qESjEs7.jpg) guy?
---
Also, Bonnaroo was lit!
---
I heatd its bannable but idk lol
---
Thank you, that we’re some rough days I left behind fortunately :)
---
But Chymistry made me want to Runecraft
---
It’s all about practice
---
Guess i’ll wait to buy a dragon platebody for a bit!
---
These were my first task. Not a fan of slayer since then
---
I disagree about the shadows being a detriment to the puzzle. Runescape from its inception was a open world survival game, and the shadows give a reason for players to be good at surviving dangerous areas for a long period of time. If the shadows weren't there then players would complain about the puzzle just being a bunch of boring running around until you finally figure it out. When you have a bunch of dangerous enemies like in the light temple and the monkey madness tunnel, running out of run energy becomes scary and you need to think faster. When you don't have enemies, running out of run energy is boring.
---
Totally agree about the crystals locked in the pillar. There is no visual indicator that the crystals are in there, and like you said, players never expect that it would be a mechanic because they were never trained from an easier puzzle. If you've ever played portal 1 or half life episodes 1 and 2, if you go back and play in the commentary mode, they have this great developer commentary where the devs talk about training the player in the mechanics of the game with simple puzzles to start and using the knowledge that they have taught to the player to build harder and harder challenges without the player getting frustrated. Its amazing the work they put into even simple levels because even if the puzzle is forgettable, the knowledge the player learns is not.
---
[Here's a walkthrough of portal 1 in commentary mode.](https://youtu.be/4jXlGK_LwDk) It should be required watching for any game developer, /u/Jagex_Wolf, because their thought process is just *so* thorough.
---
Actually the first proper task where you gotta go so where different
---
Menaphos though.
---
Ooo this is something they do in RS3? That could be interesting
---
you you.
---
You're not Chaeldar, you're just some common bitch
---
I’m sure there’s a runelite plug-in for this
---
Off I go then.
---
well you can, but it’s unlikely we’ll get inflation at this point
---
It's funny that runescape actually has a pro-vaxxer problem, with the whole fake plague thing.
---
it’s easy, just mind numbingly boring
---
Sadist
---
One of the best submission 🤣
---
The way I imagined it, yes, it would be PvP in the hallways of the ship (singles) and the rooms would be multi-combat, but instanced. As such, you can complete as many rooms as you want (a little bit like the Barrows mini-game) and you end it with the encounter against Captain Vormassa.
---
e-moms are good moms.
---
Are dragons harder than I remember? Initiate, prayer, and dmace or range mage with antidotes used to be enough
---
My mistake, when i say Wi-Fi i mean internet. Because afaik they're the samething.

1/1000 rate RNG that when you log in you'll be in the deep wilderness with your entire bank's cash stack in your inventory

This guy is a real gamer!!
---
Can I also be downvoted
---
Read the whole comment chain you fucking moron, they said Konar is better, not that they prefer it.
---
&gt;We can already see a bit of this happening with "Slayer-scape". The majority of players like PvE combat. They like to boss and do slayer or whatever. To cater to this, Jagex makes releases where slayer-bosses and whatever else drop a lot of PvE resources and similar because they have to give them some kind of reward without powercreeping the game too much with equipment. These get voted in because the amount of PvE players outnumber concerned skillers by quite a bit. Of course, this results in a lot of disenfranchised players who really like to just woodcut for money or whatever.
---
 
---
It is a sad state of affairs for sure. I am a player that likes most parts of the game pretty equally. But I would say I sway a little towards skilling, spamming a boss over and over isn't as fun to me and I like to multitask while playing. It is just a bummer that there is such a plethora of ways to gain valuable materials quicker than the skill literally designed to obtain those materials.
---
Any solo olm guide will explain. 3:1 and 4:1 are melee hand run methods, 1:0 is a really old way to do melee hand without getting hit, was good when solos were very unrefined
---
Looks good though might want to tone down the length a bit. I like how in Runescape most of the one-handed weaponry is of realistic size instead of people swinging huge anime swords around. Though godswords are pretty cool...
---
how make mone
---
And the blast furnace coffer!
---
I've been getting a lot of bloodvelds today too
---
Oh God oh fuck
---
Only helm/chest/legs. Berserker necklace is basically a must as well.
---
The way I envisioned this wasn't like a raid, but rather like the Barrows mini-game (ideal between levels 80-100).
---

shit i havnt played runescape in a good 5 years now, damn. i feel like i should get an alcoholics anonymous pin or something. lol.
---
Then why are you complaining about the price of it?
---
Haha yeah it was very low effort, I wasn’t expecting much. Just saw the q p in the title of the YouTube video and had to add a W to it :)
---
In that case .....it broke during the fight
---
You’re not wrong
---

Picking flax for 10 hours straight builds character
---
Barrows gloves
---
Fit pits aren't efficient for anything so will likely always be dead content, most players these days don't necessarily play for fun but play efficiently.
---
When will Wintertodt  be looked at? 
---
As it stands Wintertodt punishes high leveled accounts while rewarding low level accounts which makes no sense in a survival mini game .
---
For new players: Wintertodt does damage in percentages. This means that someone with 10 hp will get with 1 and 2s while someone higher level will be hit more damage. This means that one cake for a low level account can potentially last 1-2 rounds of Wintertodt saving on inventory making the mini game more afk, cheaper and efficient at lower levels. On the other hand a high level account will take massive damage while playing the mini-game this means we use more inventory space for food because we get hit more  damage and our food is way more expensive resulting in more food used per game/round, less inventory space, and in my opinion making the mini-game super inefficient at high combat levels.
---

Just try searching " Where in the sick fuck are people getting these clients that can do all this shit like switch prayers and pray flick for you."
---
Why are there a disproportionate amount of RuneScape players at music fests lol
---
10 hunter
---
What do you guys do with all the gold ore you get from mlm?
---
Are you kidding me mate? A UIM is riskier than a HCIM LOOOOL. You die on a HCIM, you safely keep all your items as an IM, you die on a UIM? You don’t keep anything but a couple untradeables. Now you have to get a looting bag back, go to your death pile at least twice, and also hope you had nothing in Zulrah/Grotesque/Vorkath storage because that stuff will be permanently deleted if you die with stuff in there.
---
Oh and if you die in an instance? Cya rune pouch, cya everything else in the looting bag.
---
Trust me, you can ruin a fucking UIM. If you die at a bad time with something good in the looting bag or Zulrah storage that can be a serious game changer.
---
Okay I should have said that I was just using that as one example. I know there are some that aren’t as crazy as the prayer flicking and such.  I just don’t understand much about the clients and was looking for some more wisdom about the “dark” side of them if you will lol.  Thank you for clearing this up a bit though
---
Thats fair, i wont touch RLPlus lol

This game is hard and Grindy enough. If you don’t like it don’t use it, it’s not that hard
---
Spider-man only has 20 hp confirmed.
---
Check out their discord and findout for yourself.
---
You're not going to find anyone that knows anything about it if they dont actually use it.
---
For instance what this guy said, "It is dangerous to use. Its not made by the makers of Runelite." Doesn't really make any sense since that would mean OSBuddy is also dangerous to use.
---
You'll have to tell me what but tholes?
---
nah dude, me either. I REALLY want to but its just not worth it. I'd kill to use a hydra plugin.
---
Fuck you, Shoresy
---
god bless you i just got rune kite and granite shield!
---
Holy shit! 23 sweets,nice rng man
---
Q
---
Is there somewhere I can find all the rules and unlocks or changes about perm dmm? The official website says nothing about quests for instance
---
and now a rune warhammer jheez!
---
They do have the option to speak their mind, there are just negative consequences for doing so.
---
The GE is where I got my stuff, it’s by far the easiest place to get it. Although you should check shop prices to see if you can get a better deal or try for drops on some monsters (you can easily range or mage safespot ogress warriors and they drop some tune stuff)
---
I got a scimmy because of the ornament kits, but they are an overall good weapon. A 2H is also a great option, and if you want to be a bit different a longsword is also a good option.
---
Shoot, guess you can't help yourself then.

Haha it’s worth a google XD

What makes this funny is that the plague is literally a hoax

Killing fire giants at deep wildy dungeon for a task,low lvl wildy slayer suuucks
---
Is Wilderness Slayer still faster or more efficient than buying it via Slayer points? Sorry, I've been away from the game for a while and can't remember how fast you can get 1,250 points.
---
Fuck yeah dude! This was my groups totem :D
---
Yep! Grand exchange will be your best bet, and definitely get rune scim right away at 40 attack if you can afford it.
---
Maybe because it's not getting hot *wink wink*
---
I do get it though, people are very bitchy lately.
---
Says famous now.
---
I think it is, actually lol. Similar variants St least.
---
Ah that sucks. I know Albion let me use a mouse natively just assumed OSRS would too.
---
&gt;Yeah, ‘titty’ streamers wear tank tops. If nerds like you didn’t blow your load over a girls shoulders, they wouldn’t exist.
---
wearing a tank top isn't against the TOS. nerds like you make it sexual, and they profit off it. Once again, if you actually cared you'd be getting dudes to stop blowing their loads over girls in tank tops, but you're not doing that because you like it, just not when females use it as a way to turn the power structure.
---
When I was making the final run for a quest cape, I had just finished MM2 and was feeling entirely burned out. It was long, the stealth section was frustrating, all of the fights you could just cheese without really fighting...
---
The next quest I did was Making Friends with My Arm. Boy, did I need that. I didn't skip any of the dialogue throughout that, it was a blast. Quests are honestly my favorite part of Runescape.
---
Yes you can, I move around to help with the boredom. I have gone through all defenders on a few accounts and I always find that there’s one that ages compared to the others and it always changes for me.

Are you seriously trying to blame the end user for security breaches that occur in companies?

Yes you can make yourself safer and yes you can use different passwords etc.

But in the end there should be more options to you regarding the security of your own account.
---
A lot of items increase over time due to merching, and then they drop when they get too high and people sell off to make money from merching. It always go on a cycle, soon the Tbow will increase again, probably not back to 1.2b as it increased a lot due to the hydra.

I think people should be able to say whatever they want, whether I agree with them or not. The sad part is that the internet is becoming more and more reliant on ads, making any sort of complete free speech impossible.

See the post from another reply - Ash posted a list awhile back that 85 is the minimum. That sounds like a great reason to use a skip to me
---
Mod gambit is the best bro. Unbanned my acc for macro major
---
Good use of RNG: Determining effective xp/hr and gp/hr rates while giving players a chance to over/under perform in the short term until they eventually regress to the mean.  
---
  Bad use of RNG: Adding arbitrary "artificial game lengthener" RNG rolls to quest content that if failed adds length to a quest without expanding the amount of actual content in the quest.  
---
  In general AGLs are considered a dev cop-out that allows them to lazily boast a larger amount of content in their game (by basing "content" off of "hours to complete" rather than actual substantive content) than they actually put into it. Random, purposeless agility RNG rolls in quests are AGLs. Just because OSRS is heavily RNG-based in most of its content and generally uses RNG in a positive manner doesn't mean that you can't misuse RNG in ways that are detrimental to the gamer's experience.
---
Beat meat good.
---
2nd task? Fuck that pay a visit to turael in burthorpe and get a new task from him. It'll overwrite your current task and re set your streak but you've got no streak anyway so
---
It might be, but anecdotally I've never failed on OSRS on that quest and I've done it at 70 agility both times.
---
So does everything else
---
"Eligible" means you have the quest and skill requirements complete. I think Ash means that once you finish the pre-requisites, log out and back in, then within 4-12 minutes. 
---
Your times corroborate this because you waited around 15 mins after completing the quest (lost time because you didnt relog), and 15 mins after relogging (which roughly fits the 4-12mins that Ash reported)
---
Hey man I was struggling with the same thing until a buddy of mine gave me the below advice.

"Basically you'll want to get your mouse positioned at the 4th tile from the south of the head of olm just before the mage hit, then get really it's quite simple from there. You just. Git Gud."

17.7 chance to get all the way across. So somewhere between 1/5 and 1/6. At less than one minute per attempt, my experience of around 5 minutes per attempt to cross was right in line with the actual statistics, and not in line with the reactionary nerds who freak the fuck out every time they fail an agility obstacle.

That shit is on my block list. Black demon tasks are absolute aids
---
why use many word when few word do trick

You mean RS2HD? Those fires were pretty.
---
Fair point. In that case, I'd be down for a giant bowl of soup to heal about 3 x 15 HP.
---
Lol yeah you actually inspired me to simplify my rules last time we talked. I cut out barrows and now only use the red stars on the map (which btw shades of mort'ton had one randomly added like 6ish months ago. So if you weren't doing it before it has a lot of good stuff)
---
Hey buddy. It’s me (OwO With Me) not in their clan. But I just added your new account.
---
Why do people hate bloodvelds so much?
---
Pfffft. We don’t know each other at all.
---
Randomized player specific light puzzle good.
---
I will hate every moment of it.  Truly good OSRS questing content.
---
If the blade’s special attack didn’t pass the poll, why wouldn’t they re-poll a better special attack? I don’t understand? People didn’t want another d spear special attack, why is it that special attack or no special attack? Shouldn’t they just re think their initial idea? Come on!!! RE-POLL A NEW SPECIAL ATTACK!!! DAMN!!!
---
The best gear upgrade for learning solo cox is sang staff. Saves you enough brews that if you're just short of finishing it'll bridge the gap.
---
They didn’t mention this in the Stronghold. I’m fucking sweating.
---
Still waiting on the smackdown...
---
That’s an insanely dope sign btw!
---
I just did MEP2 without a guide on my alt. Ended up using my main to resupply like 5 times cause I couldn't be fucked to get the mourner's outfit back and run back to the temple every 15 minutes. The shades make sense lore wise I guess, but I could have done without them

Pet roulette
---
500m for a 1/500 chance to get a pet roll at a pet shop
---
Odds and pricing subject to change.
---
Exactly. Example: my shield left half from Bandos is rarer than the pet
---
Are they near a bank/ stackable?
---
Totem? That's a doof stick.
---
Rapier doesn't look op either. Godswords do though and they aren't bis.
---
Which xeric's tp goes to her? I feel dumb for not knowing this 😂 I have architectural alliance done and I have been taking the fairy ring to the agility shortcut
---
Yeah but did you phish though?
---
Anyone bringing an osrs totem to electric forest next week??
---
Hoollllyy fuck was Trey on another level. That was insane.
---
maybe bring a trident to switch to when you're full hp?
---
How about that heavy metal Wilson?
---
Just imagine it being a diamond crystal.
---
GLORY TO THE ALLIANCE
---
Maybe
---
I mean... most people just do some medium clues.. but yew do yew
---
ZygoTitan
---
Funny you scratched out some of your skills. Ashamed?
---
My character Kappa
---
Vorkath's fireball, Olm Prayer orbs and Shaman's spawns aswell. I'm convinced Jagex uses our webcam to see when we're not looking
---
Old quests have tons of AGLs. So many quests have you just fetch a bunch of random items one by one it's stupid and it's one of the reasons I'll never do old quests without a guide.
---
He shouldn't be ashamed of his strength for sure
---
You still haven’t explained how they removed your bank pin in 2 hours..
---
Serene is back it seems
---
Wait why tf did people downvote my comment lmao
---
You mean that pog 97 strength?
---
&gt; Who's to decide good v bad?
---
  There's no reason they can't poll things like that. I think you'll probably find yourself among the minority in the opinion that adding a bunch of randomly placed agility rolls that add 5 minutes of jogging to the quest if you fail them is "memorable" rather than "a giant pain in the ass that turned what could have been a fun elf quest line into one of the biggest chores in RS". I guess you could say that the elf quests are memorable, in that most of us remember vividly what a pain in the ass they are. I'd much rather have quests that are challenging (this is NOT synonymous with "long"), have engaging stories, and unlock interesting and worthwhile content. AGLs aren't adding challenge, they're adding length. Failing an RNG "add time to the quest" roll is a shitty mechanic that, thematic or not, should be sent the way of the dodo.
---
Technically yes.
---
Realistically no.
---
Almost like Runescape was one of the most popular MMOs in the world at some point
---
😪
---
How do I explain on something I have no idea on?
---
And anytime you fail your slayer level is reduced by 1
---
I saw Emily kill mod mat k in the wilderness once, he dropped a pink skirt that I picked up. So it is possible to kill them, but maybe they have to disable some kind of godmode.
---
If it took you 4 hours, I don't think it was the platform that was stupid.
---
💪🏼
---
Well your blaming jagex.... but so far it seems to be your fault and not theirs.
---
Why would you cover up like some of your stats and numbers but leave your name open? Are you really a Dumb Ironman? Lol
---
Don't forget to setup a new authenticator!
---
I’m in a position right now that I can’t purchase a bond. I think I’m just gonna grind it out and get it eventually, this post was out of pure frustration. Thank you for your comment and insight
---
Ayy
---
Why do u have 1 hunter and farming though
---
Holy shit, it's almost like account are being phished and bots are being made faster than it takes to confirm they're bots. Maybe players should stop getting phished so their accounts can't be stolen and used to bot. Do you honestly think it would be better if they were more so liberal with macro bans that legitimate players would get banned?
---
D
---
Always report, it helps.
---
Your comment
---
&gt;There is never a reason to do Konar other than for Hydra tasks. It’s worse points and XP per hour than Dura and Nieve.
---
Let's take a closer look! 
---
&gt;***never a reason other than Hydra***
---
Well there's point boosting, so you missed that one. There's a use, when you said there wasn't.
---
i did figure it out on my own, suck yourself off some more
---
Yeah some things are just like that, like the Lunar staff for example. Kinda sucks but at least you can get it back without too much sweat
---
Wow!
---
I just feel like it doesn't do enough.  Like how is there so many 100m+ range exp accounts doing this, with the bare minimum skilling levels, and all have 77 slayer...  How is this not a red flag?
---
Fk this is so funny, osrs leaks at almost every major festival now
---
What the fuck is that prayer book layout
---
Seems legit
---
This is probably the unfortunate truth
---
Greetings from a Manchester native. How did you enjoy the festival?
---
you can probably afford some summer pies by the time you're done at least
---
0/10
---
Old people get phished too. And honestly you're right. Grandma is a piece of shit for being ignorant and not understanding that people lie on the phone and online. Old biddy needs to starve to learn that lesson.
---
Thank you
---
Thanks dude. Going to a music festival this weekend and a sign like this would be perfect lol
---
There are literally players in this subreddit who post their accounts with 99 combat skills and 99 slayer with sub 20 in most other skills. They have to take a liberal approach with autobanning players as to not ban legitimate players. Would you it rather be the opposite, where training certain skills for consecutive amounts of time would get you autobanned?
---
Just the standard normal rumble with Absorptions and Rock Cake and whatever gear I have at the time. Currently invested in the Obsidian set.
---
how do you know they aren't alts?
---
No one makes you use a guide you know....
---
Please read the text.
---
I noticed this too, I think it's because the vessel with a karambwanji in it is a different item to an empty vessel. So when you catch a karambwan it unloads then auto reloads again and the vessel is basically a new item.
---
Just my guess though
---
Counterpoint: The randomized puzzles make the puzzles simpler and less enjoyable for people who actually like completing the puzzles, because it generally just becomes trial and error instead of actual problem solving. So everyone loses.
---
If your connection goes out because you're traveling and your signal drops momentarily between towers you get force logged, it sucks for mobile on the train sometimes. 
---
when i was afking nmz while at work I actually ran the client on my home desktop and used chrome remote desktop to click every 10 minutes or so from my phone.
---
I don’t think autobanning for basically ANYTHING should be done.  I think certain things should be red flags for investigation.  Like always being logged at brutal blacks, with 77 slay and 100m+ range exp.
---
Idk man 200m rs3 only converts to like 50k osrs. So glws.
---
That's means a JMOD is shadow banned lol.
---
Yah... Trying to support your argument with a fallacy only hurts your argument.
---
I’ve already had two smouldering stone drops at 75 slayer, so I’m not entirely sure what’s going on with my rng
---
depends on the boss. Bosses like zulrah and vorkath use lots of food. Loads of people kill rune dragons and that uses a shit ton of food. Also general slayer im sure tons of people are using karambwans and sharks. Anyways the main reason is because theres only 2 or 3 worlds with people pking using sharks and then for pvm its every world. ALSO, alot of pkers use dark crabs or manta rays instead of sharks.
---
It’s not against rules to transfer. Just need to find a trusted person.
---
FWIW, not making mistakes and not talking aren't proof. People alting bbds are the same people doing 3t4g for 16 hours a day with 0 fuck ups. Dropping the black dhdide is a clear giveaway though lmao
---
Inventory spot saved also
---
IP addresses don’t mean shit. They aren’t unique to computers or your connection as many people, myself included have a dynamic IP. Rebooting your router can change your IP, them warning you that your account has been accessed by a different IP doesn’t help at all. If you went on mobile you IP would even change depending on when you last hit flight mode or changed location. Sure if you suddenly logged in with an IP in fucking Cambodia then yeah, however it’s easy to spoof an IP and appear elsewhere. 
---
Also there’s no chance in hell that your bank pin was removed in two hours. Runelite, whilst I use it myself, isn’t official and is still technically a risk to your account security. Are you saying that your bank pin is gone? Or just they bypassed it? Which implies a piece of malware that watched you input your pin and screenshot each click. 
---
Change all passwords on a phone, take the pc off of your network, scan and fully clean and then you can go back to normal. Malwarebytes is a good cleaner, AVG always did me well too.
---
nah, still comes from fish skill
---
Thanks a lot guys! :)
---
I know, I'm not looking to buy any fancy stuff. Just needed some cash to level smithing/crafting  for  mm2 and Vorkath. Since those are the content I really want  to see!!!
---
That would literally flag every bbd alt.
---
That’s like 19m in osrs.
---
This is not true for SoA, only Heroes.
---
That’s how you tab back and find yourself in lumbridge
---
Can we get osrs HD someday?
---
Yeah, I'm the opposite. I almost never use my phone at work otherwise, so I use it about ten times as much now than I did before AFK NMZing. I'm still the most productive fucker in the building though, so no one really gives a damn.
---
If you're saying that the fight is very robotic and instead of reacting to the bosses attacks and interacting with what is going on you're just clicking back and forth at the correct time, then I kind of agree.
---
after the deadman change, it said it changed from 1/100 to 1/50...?
---
Is there not a sufficient team to sift through probably less than 5000 accounts??  A lot of whom are bots???  Like..  it’s pretty easy to distinguish between the two even as a normal player, not a Jagex employee, with insight into hidden machinations.
---
RIP to cannonball profit in the last couple months.
---
Yeah i play diablo 2 and 3.
---
Yes, it’s considered a trust trade
---
Transition into path of exile.. it’s Diablo 3 as it should have been
---
For deadman mode, yes
---
