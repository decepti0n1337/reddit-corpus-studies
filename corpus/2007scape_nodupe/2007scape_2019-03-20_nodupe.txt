Great, thanks!

You get 25 charges per token, so 2560 for 64k bones. Obv still a lot, but way less hah

Wait, so are they polite or pricks.  I'm confused. 
---
You can't prove that more people would vote if poll results were hidden. But that's a moot point. What's important is that you can't prove that any poll would have swung if poll results were hidden, because that wouldn't happen

I've double checked and can confirm that the account is now back with the original account creator. It looks as though the other account that you took the screenshot with also wasn't created by you so that too has been secured for the original owner to recover.

yahoooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
With Max stats and bis gear i can kill 50 in a trip. On my iron i range them which means infinite kc because u can safespot them
---
Because the game mode is objectively worse by every angle. 
---
RIP in advance to all the good suggestions that won't get read.

Lmfao

If I was trolling I wouldn‚Äôt be being serious.  But yes, you‚Äôre ‚Äúa fucking retard‚Äù.
---
You missed the whole point my dude
---
cant tell if for real
---
Please talk about any ui improvements (if any) to mobile. Especially the part about huge ass text boxes and the fact that you can't see the info for spec attacks.
---
Its a mmo better get used to it. Anyone  with better stats and gear deserves to get the kill. It has always been part of the game. 
---
Another story is if they personally world hop and grief you.
---
None of them have a response nearly that negative so I can tell that you didn't actually check

Bad for the game is bad for the game. Racism is bad for the social aspect of the game as a whole. MTX, racism, botting, scamming, impersonating mods, etc is all bad for the game and should not be allowed.
---
I'll *just ignore it tho* when they take it out of the ToS
---
All that will happen is clans will camp there all day and charge people to get in. Then you‚Äôll come back here and moan again.
---
If you make it an instance the bandos uniques will crash, as more people can kill so oversupply and this will have a knock on effect and disrupt the economy.
---
It‚Äôs a shit part of the game, but it‚Äôs a key element. 
---
To be fair, both taking 85 attempts and using justiciar means he‚Äôs quite shit at the game in general. 
---
Thanks! :)
---
Please Add an authentication Delay 
---
That part was hilarious. The excuses people were coming up with for why the original account owner would be talking like a dickbag hacker threatening to drop items and finesse their way into the bank. 
---
Sad this guy lost his entire bank because Jmods made mistakes. 
---
/r/brainlet
---
Really good people can do it in like 2 hours. But first attempts are usually like 3 hours. I realized I was low on prayer so I waited for 9 sgs specs to get up to 99 prayer 2 waves before the first jad lol.
---
Did you just make this up? Anyone who knows him knows he's not like that.

I just did it with one stamina and 2 ppots, super easy with 99 range and diamond bolts, I rather this method since I take way less damage :D

Good to know I can farm skotizo now

Oof, tbow and ely...

can the charter ship interface be update for mobile? currently it's hard to press some of the karamja areas.

Honestly can't even imagine how much personal harassment you had because of Jagex's mistakes. You deserve a personal apology from them (/u/Jagex_Weath /u/JagexAcorn).

---
Inb4 the ctc2 solver tries to start a youtube career and make each video about vague clues they pulled out of their ass so they can be relevant for as long as possible. Just like ctc1
---
part of the game, if it was easy to get bandos rooms the gear would crash and no one would be there.  
---
Man I don't know haha which is why I would die in those situations. But with Justiciar and ely you just run to the south pillar and safe spot them all. The melee will dig straight to you so you never have to deal with him while other monsters are attacking you.
---
is it better than using other armor?
---
It's much better than a phone. Bigger screen for my sauage fingers. 
---
The best part of this is a hood instead of the awful helmet
---
The internet is weird, my gut reaction was that you were telling the truth but with all the witch hunting and the "Jmod Smackdown" thing I thought "How could everyone be wrong?" And changed my opinion. I kept reading into your points and I did say that if [it really was your account you would be vindicated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/azr15o/making_a_reddit_post_to_recover_an_account_that/ei9qred/?context=3) But yeah sucks to be on the receiving end of so much hate. I hope this doesn't ruin your time with runescape or the community too much. All the best Brodaki. I also saw your original posts have been taken down so I thought you were banned in this sub. 
---
Doing it the justiciar way doesn‚Äôt teach you to understand mechanics. It‚Äôs just brute forcing it and hoping you get lucky to tank hits. That‚Äôs why most people talk down on the method. I‚Äôd rather learn how the monsters work and deal with them properly
---
What do you expect him to do? He removed it from the public chat as fast as possible, do you want him to cry about it? You realize that's what every streamer deals with, yeah? How about you get off your personal hate train towards him and focus your energy for something more useful
---
There was a guy here a week ago got like 3 of them in 100kc or something 
---
This big announcement has not offered anything to pvp as it currently stands , please change the mindset of pvp updates being only DMM
---
So racist jokes are bad for the game? Plenty of people equate dark humor with racism. Would you say that we should ban edgy humor?
---
Most people aren't offended by edgy humor. SJWs, like yourself, are bad for the game. People who advocate for anything besides freedom and personal responsibility, are bad for the game. 
---
Companies should let us tweak what we want to see to our own liking. There are things I dislike seeing, I block the people who say them. I don't try to force the company to make them stop existing. 
---
If you are an adult, you can just as easily click the ignore button as me. But let me guess... That's "ableist" right? Hope I didn't offend anyone. LMFAO.
---
I can't think of a single polling system besides OSRS where results are shown before you even vote. Imagine was election voting would be like if we could see who's winning before we even vote. Still shitty, but even worse.
---
Tell ya what mate

Used to make BANK buying unids 1k ea.

Jmods wont respond to this thread :crab:
---
well with a tablet you can get the keyboard and mouse attachments. could do the same for a phone but not as nice.
---
What tablet do you use?
---
Yeah that guy isn't in Oblivion, He's 123 combat. I followed him BECAUSE he has Oblv in his name and isn't Oblivion, you can even see me typing out "whats going on here" then he says that and I instantly put him on my ignore and the laugh isn't one laughing because of what he said it's because of how out of the blue it was. 
---
But yeah, please tell me more how I laugh and laugh about it and all the constant and blatant racist my clan participates in.
---
I‚Äôm OOTL
---
What is authenticator delay?
---
If anything it shows that there old systems dont keep as good of track as everything as they claim they do. 
---
most is just doublespeak, I'm surprised most people seem to be pacified by this
---
I think it's a fair assumption to make in &lt;currentyear&gt;
---
Your content is incredibly funny and I love your sense of humor. Looking forward to seeing more videos.
---
Yeah this is actually a big issue. We need to get this popular so Jmods have to reply. They were so confident and yet they were wrong. What does that say about the future of your account security? 
---
Which, and I've said it before, is interesting that the worst part of the RC grind is actually in the mid levels.
---
It's a unique characteristic of Runecrafting which I feel is fine as is. 
---
Sorry Freddo I don't have time to watch the vid so I can only comment on the title and what this conversation is.
---
if you hear us then why havent you done it yet. itd take like 10 mins of someones time. its so easy but you just give us bullshit answers like this. you dont need to understand and be able to fix all the issues in one go or we'll be here till the end of  time. you dont even discuss when you reply. you give one half soaked reply then hide till the thread dies. we all know theres plenty of issues with the polls, so fix an easy one now before we all get fed up and your brilliant game dies because we think the devolpers arent doing anything to fix stuff.
---
Hom3r is still in the clan
---
Runelite
---
His story adds up and he has the account back. Jmods were wrong, it happens. Quit being mad because you were wrong. 
---
Jagex is so full of shit when they reply to threads like this, amazing that anyone takes their word for anything after all the shit that has happened
---
&gt; **Most people** can't even unlock zulrah in that amount of time, much less on an ultimate.
---
I very clearly talked about the general population. A handful of experienced players being able to do it does not change my statement at all. Zulrah banking has existed for virtually every single UIM since the start. Nothing you say can change that statement, as it is fact.
---
Because they‚Äôre pagans and they don‚Äôt believe in the Christian god, so they think it‚Äôs funny that he was so stupid as to grab a red hot piece of metal thinking a god that doesn‚Äôt exist will protect him. 
---
It people wanted unbiased polls then they should have properly done their research on the matter and voted for it during the poll.
---
Just because you believe yourself to be a "more educated" voter doesn't make your vote more special that anyone elses. 
---
Contest winners still don't get their prizes.
---
Max cash spawn, T Bow spawn, now this.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Jagex wtf?
---
I just did this myself (well I chinned to 90) and especially at the lower levels I found that swapping necklaces really hurt my xp per chin dramatically, that +dmg from the anguish is way too important. But I think 90-99 is a different story
---
i need to switch. Isuckers
---
IDK how I'd feel about that.... I'd probably just be more likely to skip it more often than actually vote because it was pushed at me. ü§î
---
This way it's up in my face, but still a choice... 
---
I mean, if they wanted everyone to vote, they could definitely make it so you had to complete a captcha before voting, and submit your votes before playing (captcha to help get rid of bots... Kill 2 birds with 1 stone?) but the community backlash to that would probably be incredible... 
---
I did, I was referencing how much of a shit show it was last time. At the time of my comment 3 hours ago it quite clearly looked like people were going to turn it into shitting on Brodaki again.
---
Glad to see it didn't.
---
Thanks, now I understand completely. It helped that you stressed that justiciar is inefficient actually. Remember when people used to pray range against jad while wearing ganodermic armour and polypore staff? Inferno sounds like a less severe but similar situation.
---
1. Many new players have come to the game for the PVP content - hence are already on PVP worlds.
---
   
---
2. Lurers have mastered the *art* of social engineering and manipulation. Not that hard to entice a new player with bond-bought gp to *flex* back after being called poor.
---
3. Not all of the reading a book lures require giving the victim instructions. Perhaps a common thing in the more long winded lures, but not so much in the spur of the moment entice-a-noob-into-flexing-their-bank situations.
---
good to know my third degree burns are an indication my tech is working the way it should.
---
does Jad always 1 hit you if you mess up your prayers? just spent so much time getting to the final wave, and the guide i read said that I should pray range to start, so i figured that meant his first attack was always range. got 1 hit and just feel so defeated.
---

Good luck on the rebuild.

Rofl dude mine used to stay cool but now its a freaking Coleman grill
---
I hate to be so negative but I don't see why everyone is so happy about this. Obviously they've known and been aware with how dissatisfied we've been. This blog post means literally nothing until they actually do something about it (which if you'll recall - has been a fat load of fuck all) 
---
Doesn't sound like the worst idea tbh. As the game grows, I think it makes sense to ensure F2P grows with it. 
---
People love to bitch about something. Which is a shame.
---
If you want the real answer of why not, you're wasting your time. There are a shit load of ways a normal account can make money and train crafting a lot faster and be a lot more efficient.
---
Not only is glassblowing very slow exp as far as crafting goes, but collecting only a few at a time from whatever appears from an irons' overflow is going to be a fraction of the speed you're able to train crafting otherwise.
---
Although this is an efficiencyscape mentality and not everyone cares to play that way, it's the truth. You're wasting time, so unless you REALLY enjoy picking up glass, I don't see the reason.
---
That type of mentality is why I made an ironman though.  Ironman isn't about being the most efficient and wasting as little time as possible with buyable skills.
---
Can there be a confirmation on selling a max cape back?
---
Please. Past 77 you have it good. Just line up a million movies and tv shows.
---
I was just thinking - they have Land of the Goblins almost finished. Why not go above and beyond and make that the Another Cook's Quest to a set of mini-quests followed by finale. A Bandosian RFD. Maybe for Runefest 2019?
---
I figure since RS3 killed of Bandos so early, we could have a section building lore about the God via four subquests: Goblins, Ogres, Trolls, and Jogres, followed by an abridged reimagining of Chosen Commander as the final boss fight.
---
Be a perfect way to introduce dragon nails and brutals.
---
Honestly this is way more in line with Desert Treasure-tier than RFD, but either way. I personally would love it.
---
Who are you?
---
Vikings, the good stuff.
---
Wait a second, that's a penis!
---
Or put the amulet of range as a reward for beginner clue scrolls and up? 
---
Generally, which slayer tasks are better to use melee for, and which are better to use ranged for? Sorry if that is a really vague question. 
---
Since the game requires no skill I‚Äôve assumed you‚Äôve completed every possible challenge the game has to offer?
---
I feel like that only adds
---
There are talks of people adding reqs to skilled clans by posting your actual Inferno clear time versus owning the cape itself.  Because it means you can't hide behind spending days sitting behind a pillar and SGS speccing to full or using Justiciars, because a half-decent non-Justiciars/SGS completion is definitely under 100-110 minutes.
---
Sure it's elitist, but it is a remarkable difference in the quality of the player's capability versus saying "I have an Inferno Cape" nowadays by proving your completion time.
---
Good tv series LUL
---
Bro your chair stinks so bad
---
"Shit boys their onto us" 
---
Everyone who said rude things deserves have it shoved in their faces. So much of the social media community is literally worthless trash (to the community not worthless as people) its pretty pathetic.
---
Glad ya got your account back! Sucks you lost the 350 m tho thatll be a difficult rebuild from nothing unless you have people that would be willing to loan you good gear for stuff
---
Can‚Äôt unsee, rip 
---
They should have locked the account from the fact that two different people were on it.
---
Wait so this isn't some funky ass black treasure trail gear but the crack the clue 2 rewards?
---
If that's the case these look tight af given you can just go dig them up somewhere.
---
It's true. We're all just riddled with crabs.
---
I waste my time picking it up because the only other way I would get that glass is by wasting more time collecting even more sand. Nobody wants to do that.
---
That doesn't apply to a normal account by any means. Not only is collecting the glass slow, but actually training by blowing glass is extremely inefficient for a main.
---
totes allowed, have fun.
---
So say you wanted to 1hp NMZ, what bosses would people suggest to have unlocked prior to NMZ, and what's a good inventory to have  for that? 
---
Let's all be 100% clear.
---
If hidden polls are added it will do nothing, but cause less content to enter the game.
---
Is that what you all want? 
---
Yes, but 1 person deciding to vote instead of note vote is not going to change the minds of other nonvoters. Thus, 1 vote truly does "mean shit" and is still only 1 vote. Your logic is right but you're ignoring that each voters choice on whether to vote or not is independent from one another.
---
If you brew up above his max hit (97) he can‚Äôt 1 hit you. He hits very accurately but can hit anywhere from 1-97 so no, it‚Äôs not necessarily always going to be a max hit
---
lmao, dont worry brother. I just finished getting lvl 5 all roles a few weeks ago and it was indeed as bad as i thought it would be and I only wanted to die irl. I dont blame you whatsoever. If it wasn't my last elite diary I would have never fought through it
---
Its either a troll or some kind of lure. Its been posted on here a couple times in the last few days. You should be fine as long as you avoid the usual lure/scam shit.

All of those points are true but also with last time: with the way how it ended up being solved using the angles on the clues... there was still a decent amount of guesswork. The lines meant to denote angles weren't straight, so there were a number of possible "solutions"

It's my last and I'm considering never getting that diary cape. Just for the memes

This also means that the account is basically unusable, as the hackers can recover it again at any point. If they've done it once they can do it again.

In all honesty, a "smackdown" is what the community sees. Like most cases of a Jagex Smackdown is just a reply of a Jmod stating that the account was either bought or the player did commit an offense, there is literally no direct flaming or shaming, they just the facts and proof. 
---
Community blows it way out of proportion and makes a spectacle out of it, while all Jmods do is replying on an online forum/reddit thread.

Actual customer service: hmm seems like this person is providing conflicting information, lord knows we are not perfect and our account recovery has appeared to be easily socially engineered. He has provided us with information that at least warrants us to do a bit more background look into it. Hmm I guess we should lock the account until we can situate everything.

What if you got to keep the cape but it got a symbolic ‚Äúbig red x‚Äù kind of denotatiob on the cape? That way it shows that you died but you maxed before you did it. Also it would lose all the perks of the max cape and you‚Äôd have to get a new regular Ironman max cape to reap the benefits. That way it‚Äôd just be purely fashionscape.
---
You're supposed to use Melee for all them except Dust Devils, Smoke Devils, and Nechrayaels, maybe Bloodvelds, Abyssal Demons, and Ankou if you're feeling extra efficient. Of the ones you don't melee, you Burst/Barrage them and of the ones you do melee, you Cannon them if you're allowed to setup a Cannon in that area.
---
If you're a newer player, just melee all the ones you can, and if the monster is too hard, range/mage safespot it depending on what the wiki says it's weak to.
---
Which wyverns are you fighting that drop nothing?
---
I‚Äôm not proposing that it doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm stating it doesn‚Äôt.   When did I suggest that it *should* take skill?  The simplicity of the game is perfectly fine.  There *shouldn‚Äôt* need to be a skill curve so why ask.

I tried doing zmi yesterday but the xp rates are so fucking bad. Like 69 rc and was getting 35k xp/h or so

Right but based on the information they had, the hacker seemed likely to be the original owner because of the info OP had leaked. They can‚Äôt keep the account locked forever, they received a credible recovery and handed it over.

**ADD NEX TO GAME WITH A REASONABLE DROP TABLE?**
---
 \-Nex was my favorite boss in RuneScape and I'd love to see her introduced to the game.
---
 \-Drops could include armor enhancements pieces to be added onto previously existing God Wars armor  (bandos,armadyl)  to make them resemble the Torva and Pernix and Virtus (for Ancestrals maybe?).
---
 \-Having Armor add-ons would get rid of the original problem people had with Nex where God Wars armor was devalued due to better armor being release.
---
 \-Armor add-ons could make the armor scale to t-75(instead of 80) and/or maybe add prayer bonus or some kind of prayer bonus or prayer siphon effect to make it valuable for PvM. Also making the enhanced armor degrade similar to barrows(with higher repair fee) would balance it so that players will still want older, non-degradable God Wars armor to do things like slayer or easier bosses with.
---
\-Make the enhanced armor look like Torva, Pernix, and Virtus did? Let's be honest those armor sets were bad ass looking :)
---
**Things to note:**
---
 **-**If Nex was released into Old School- it would be much harder due to lack of powerful things like Curses, Summoning, and Overloads(due to stat restore for brews.) I am completely okay with it being more difficult but it may have to be tuned down if you want it to be as accessible to the audiences as it originally was.
---
\-If it isn't tuned down the drops will be much more slowly added into the game(with less players able to get kills and much shorter trips without yaks/soul split) so it will hopefully have a slower more gradual impact on the in-game economy.
---
\-Originally Brews and Restores were dropped regularly to extend trips BUT i don't think that would be healthy for the game as the prices of these potions are MUCH higher than they were compared to when Nex was originally released.
---
\-May need to lower magic level of the boss for T-Bow- but not sure.
---
\-Finding a good fit for the stats of the armor may be difficult but I have plenty of ideas I'm willing to share.(I just didn't want this post to be to long and monstrous to read.)
---
**SUMMARY**
---
   Nex would be awesome to see in the game. The rewards could be add-ons for existing God Wars armor to be less op and avoid the devastating effects of releasing completely new armor sets into the game. Would need to account for the lack of things like Summoning, Overloads, and Curses- as well as avoid the small drops like brews and restores (because of prices.)

PS

  I love the passion that all of the J-Mods poor into the game. (Not saying this to get my question on stream or anything.) I watch the stream every week and it makes me so proud to play the game. Each and every decision and project is carefully made and thought over while every J-Mod just wants to see the game they've loved- just as much as the players have- thrive. It's inspiring and almost a bragging point with friends when they complain about game devs ruining their games. Keep up the good work you guys because you don't get appreciated enough.&lt;3 Especially you God Ash.

D scim. Easily best answer. Leaf bladed axe only for kurosks and turoths slayer tasks. 
---
I didnt write any posts about it because i didnt truly care. But i was definitely on the side of "please at least lock the account you incompetant apes, the guy on the account clearly isnt the owner if hes threatening to drop untradables and real world trade live with evidence"

Reddit is the only place where this shit is happening, I regularly talk to people in my clan and elsewhere who don‚Äôt use reddit, they‚Äôre confused when they hear about this shit, it‚Äôs not as widespread as reddit wants to make it seem.
---
they dont give a shit homie. everyone at jagex is doing the bare minimum to skate by and get their paycheque as the game plummets to its eventual death from mismanagement in a couple years along with the one hit wonder developer that has slowly killed the only thing its ever been successful with
---
Idk I was making a joke lmao
---
All they have to do is just print faster than inflation, easy fix lol
---
did you see the screenshots/proof in the other thread? Plus the recovery request should have contained enough info to just outright give the acct back to me, let alone lock it. It was a lot more than me asking them.
---
People who crash, admit to crashing in chat, and then proceed to be an scumbag asshole and tell you to hop.   
---
These people are counter-culture to everything the 90% of the respectful in game society represents in terms of behavior. Should then be banned if they do this regularly? No. But they should get temporarily lose access to ge-slots or something.   
---
  
---
You also have in-game proof that scammers are scamming, and yet these people almost literally never get punished. 
---
I remember someone made a server a few years ago that included most of F2P. Its no longer up though.

---
I had to mine Runite Ore. I had to pickpocket an elf. I had to travel to the wilderness and battle double agents in 2 of the most PKer infested hotspots: Lava Dragon Isle and the Chaos Temple. It spent 6 months in my bank as I slowly did each step. Needless to say the grind wasn't worth it. But, all the skilling I did earned me about 20 mill. Lesson: Sometimes the journey is more powerful and epic than the destination.

You should read the rest of the thread then.

Sorry to break it to you mate but it's because it has a higher strength bonus, not because 10k is breaking the bank. If the glory had the same str bonus it would be the new meta

Jagex know all about the bandwagon effect and try to use it to push the community to vote for content they already took time designing.

Cringeworthy reward that could have been implemented any other way but they couldn't ditch the idea after the polls failed for all of the interesting parts of using it.

OP mentioned in the original post that the hacker threatened to drop untradeables if he didn't give him the bank pin. Since I doubt OP gave him the pin, you gotta wonder if he went through with it
---
A few months is ages of time, you can easily do the requirements in a week.  If you're playing UIM you are probably not the most casual player.  I'm not saying everyone who has played UIM has unlocked Zulrah in the first few months, I'm just saying that it's not even close to difficult.  That said I do agree that Zulrah banking has been around almost the entire time UIMs have been, doesn't really change the fact that UIM was meant to be 1 inventory and the new mechanics changed the game mode in a perhaps unforeseen way (although IMO it was a change for the better). 
---
Repfam I see you
---
I have to steal from a gem stall so I'm right there with having to pickpocket an elf requirement of 75 thieving...debating now if I really want to do it.
---
They should have given you the account back for sure. But if they decide that they dont let you recover it and they think you are not the owner of the account, why would they lock it by your request? 
---
Truish 
---
?
---
-laughs in android-
---
yeah. im of the opinion that if im going to go full autism and challenge myself in that way i may as well do it right. uim being a meta of going out of your way to find as many pseudo banks as possible kinda ruins it for me
---
Thanks, Sabre. The sabre-toothed tiger is an awesome animal. I figured you were likely aware of this, but I just wanted to give it a shout out as something I'd like to see in person.

I don't love seeing the n word and occasional full on hate speech spammed while I'm trying to do Wintertodt. They definitely shouldn't get banned though. In the past (10 years ago) I had been muted a couple of times for telling people to kill themselves. The first mute was a week, the second was a month, and I never got muted again after the second one. 
---
I think that there is actually an opportunity here to correct behavior, while a ban or even a perm mute could make it worse.

---
it's much less impressive than the achievement could be due to oversights that are fundamentally against the spirit of the game mode. ironman is still impressive if people abuse alts for slayer, tanking bosses, etc. just less so and against the initial spirit of the challenge.
---
if your entire defence is how good the stats and autism of the player making the argument is, go ahead. guarantee mine are better

You're being a dickhead.

This means the mod was being an extra dick to him for no reason.
---
Wow, /u/SrGrafo's work has even reached OSRS. Impressive.
---
Except those things you listed are literally cheating, meanwhile the only goal of UIM is no bank which is exactly what is happening.
---
A comparable example would be pray flicking and such, nice try though buddy
---
Congrats man, what‚Äôs the justicar method? I‚Äôm far from even attempting but I think I‚Äôll be in way over my head.
---
Asking for help?   Your post was multiple paragraphs bitching about slayer and saying fuck you to jagex and acting like a fat douche.  God you're whiny. 
---
Ban gambling bots. I have to disable public chat and overhead text (with runelite) every time I enter the GE otherwise it's unbearable. 
---
But to call an entire clan of people racist based on a racist comment of someone who is not in that clan is irresponsible, because now you are making members of this clan a target just for being in the clan. The irony
---
I mean if you're going for a 2b bank to do the inferno I doubt you're going to be doing vorkath/zulrah as your main money makers
---
There‚Äôs a whole community of us that prefer f2p.  The Ironman f2p rune scim grind is real heh. 
---
I dunno. For me it‚Äôs just a more simple and pure experience. There is just sooo much shit in p2p. I feel like the fundamental stuff that makes rs what it is, is f2p. I only wish that slayer was a stat. 
---
LUL thats actually a good one
---
Probably sound like a douchebag here, but I just can‚Äôt watch people with accents I don‚Äôt like. Same reason I don‚Äôt watch the Karamaja guy and most brits. I enjoy EVScapes videos because aussies are cool, but other than that i only watch settled and KempQ
---
I feel some of warding content will be added but not as a new skill. I don't think there has been any official talk of it recently though.
---
No one wants to vote when polls are 40 questions.  They need to be 10 questions each.  Save the remaining questions for the next week.  The way jagex words the questions, 10 seems like 100 as is.  That shit confusing sometimes 
---
Good to know it wasn‚Äôt all wasted on low value items haha
---
all that update did was make it so my 10 spaces from a tree ironman couldnt catch chins anymore
---
Disgusting
---
I believe the strong hold of security taught me specifically that a Jmod will ONLY message me thru the onsite messaging system. TIL
---
I won't remind you in 2 days.
---
Guess we'll need another few months or maybe years of front page threads. I'm okay with that.
---
I'm not even sure that's a trigger, tbh. I have been to numerous different countries and log in there, never any issues. I do use the same computer though, so it might check for that. By itself, logging in from somewhere new has never been an issue for me.
---
That's not even close to a comparable example. The entire point of Ultimate Ironman is to see how far you can get without a bank being limited to your inventory. Utilizing relatively modern updates that give you storage space as QOL or as easyscape death mechanics to get around creating pseudo banks is fundamentally against the initial spirit of the game mode as you are finding loopholes and oversights to lessen the impact of the restrictions placed upon your account. This is no different than a regular ironman creatively working with the restrictions on their account to use alts to lure for slayer or to tank bosses. It's at root the exact same form of cheating that ruins the competitive nature of the challenge to a certain extent.
---
It's pretty clear that you are looking at things with blinders on and not actually listening to what other people are saying and honestly considering it. I have a maxed main with 1b xp, a maxed ironman and an uim with ~1500 total. Got to about 1k total in f2p uim, got members, and quit it instead of going for max as the gameplay felt more about abusing modern easyscape mechanics for bank space rather than an actual challenge based around scarcity of space. The challenge is still there to an extent but it is diluted and unsatisfying due to the constant presence and influence of what are essentially cheats. The impact is very similar to how some of what I mentioned about regular ironman impacts and hinders my enjoyment of that mode. If you disagree and enjoy it more power to you but it is pretty childish to go around yelling at people with genuine opinions just because they differ from yours
---
tl;dr up your autism kiddo not even on my spectrum
---
Happy cock day
---
I'm mobile only too. Trust me it's a pain in the ass but %1000 worth it. I'm sitting at 100qp at 101 combat lol so I feel your procrastination pain. 
---
Yeah it's pretty insane. 
---
It's literally on the rules: https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules
---
Regardless of whether or not they enforce it, account sharing is against the rules exactly for reasons like this.
---
Yeah thanks man, it's funny the v skirt and karil's coif were a double chest
---
It‚Äôs painful. I need runelite! 
---
Auto click magic to 99.  0% ban rate if you‚Äôre using random intervals.

I know because I‚Äôve done it. When you‚Äôre alching, your mouse is in the exact same spot. So is the auto clicker, so how would they know?? (They don‚Äôt!
---
A lot of raids teams want you to have a tbow or scythe these days.
---
Shit no I was in 5th grade so I was 10
---
I‚Äôm 95 slayer and I have no fucking idea why I waited this long...
---
Exactly what I thought. The only case where that doesn't result in a locked account is when the person who now lost the account phished or hacked it in the meantime 
---
Even with that, a temporary lock for a further investigation is the best solution. Even if a day later they double check their facts and OP couldn't deliver on his promise of a successful recovery, they just unlock it and the "original owner" continues playing 
---
Amen brother
---
Jagex is British. 
---
I mean it‚Äôs really only 1/87k if you are actually looking at that specific drop. If you are just looking rare drops on the rdts then you lump to like 1/4K or something which is a roll independent of the pet. Just keep killing it and you‚Äôll get the pet eventually...
---
Hey, it's you! You're the guy!
---
Digging at what?  Do you think a sample size of a hand full of people proves a point?  If so you‚Äôre objectively wrong.  My ‚Äústalwart defense‚Äù is because a rallying cry of people on the opposite side of the fence than me.  If anyone says anything even remotely against the horde than you get jumped on, but the thing is it doesn‚Äôt bother me one bit contrary to what you might believe.  
---
I‚Äôll continuously, and gladly, express my view about it the more that people question it.  Every response I‚Äôve given is in reply to someones late argument against it. If people don‚Äôt want a ‚Äústalwart defense‚Äù reply, than don‚Äôt ask a question to receive an answer you‚Äôre going to refuse anyways.  It‚Äôs counter intuitive and just fishing. 
---
There‚Äôs this obvious stigma of elitism that emanates in the core of this game that‚Äôs amazing. 
---
Just drop it and stop having a conversation with me if your mindset is just going to be an impenetrable stone.
---
Man the only downside to this is that smack downs will probably not be issued as often in fear of repeating the same mistake. 
---
Also sorry for doubting you OP I didn‚Äôt think the system was THIS bad. Holy shit. 
---
People are literally demanding mods to respond to threads
---
Is it as satisfying as ending runecrafter lives? I sometimes do it for the response more than the glories. 
---
I second this.
---
It‚Äôs even more ridiculous considering the ‚Äúoriginal owner‚Äù threatened to drop untradeables and blackmailed him. 100000 iq 
---
Don't forget to insure the pet with Probita in Ardougne, in case you ever accidentally die with it!
---
And gratssss.

lol if you followed the situation and came with that opinion. Then I have a bridge to sell you.
---
Imagine thinking I'm going to read this.
---
You're not the one that decides what uim is about when it was created, and the way literally everyone plays it, is that you can't bank. Otherwise they would disable any content that stores items, which they did not. Bye
---
thanks for this! simple and easy to understand
---
Not Making your way a poll is a lousy excuse. Some people, such as myself, dont vote bc we don't know enough about the game. 
---
No problem! 
---
I suppose that would be valid if I was in the EU, so I do not believe that should have any effect. 
---
Tell that to my 99 magic skill cape. And how would they detect it if the click intervals are random?  
---
For visibility a slightly thicker font black border would be better. Great meme though thank you 
---
Why do you bring it up and then say that you aren't making an argument? Jagex can fake the polls all they want as it is, bringing up that they can do it as well with hidden results means nothing. It doesn't contribute to the discussion when you just say something that has the same possibility regardless.
---
Well shit. Missed that. 
---
Fuck lol
---
Welp. Fuck. 
---
It was obvious as fuck the whole time... I'm so frustrated for you man. I can't believe they didn't lock your account. And the whole high and mighty attitude "the account has been returned to the original owner" just a slap on the face.... Sorry--just venting now. 
---
I didn't even bother to comment that day because it was just a ridiculous circlejerk. I'm very glad to see my instinct was right that day though!

---
That's literally what I've been saying, it's against the rules because even if it's not bannable, I've literally said from my first post that they don't enforce it and they have it in there to cover for the edge cases like unclear recoveries and in the client example, OSHD. If even after this post you still don't understand why it's against the rules, you're literally retarded.

You can resell the pieces for at least 90% of the price you bought them for anyways so the cost isn't really relevant unless you literally cannot afford them, in which case you probably shouldn't be spending all your money on burst casts anyways.

---
Repost 
---
That‚Äôs one way to look at it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt matter. Those people‚Äôs votes created that outcome. Assuming the 2nd person in your example didn‚Äôt vote, the opposing choice would still be at 100%. That‚Äôs influence.
---
When people make the choice to not flex their vote, they miss out on having any sway at all, no matter how small. After all, these polls are supposed to be about what the majority wants, but if the majority don‚Äôt vote, then the passionate few that do vote frequently will usually get away with whatever changes they like.
---
They only ‚Äúaddressed‚Äù the situation to calm people down. All they did was create a post saying they know about it. We know they know about it because they look at Reddit every day. How about instead of saying they‚Äôre aware of the issues just fucking fix them. 
---
This isn't a repost lol. Not unless someone hacked my phone itself today.

Sadly I doubt Jagex would admit that they were wrong here, just adds even more bad PR to them, they're not exactly known for their truthfulness...  
---
tbh even reading their recent post about everything lately, it just screams as a very generic "we're sorry we'll improve in the future" talk.
---
this IS THE RIDE!!!

The "roots of the problem" rely on a basic understanding within the field of statistics. They refuse to acknowledge this. There is nothing that they "need to understand" because they are simply refusing to even acknowledge something that a high school statistics class would teach.
---
As a straight man I'd rather bang the guy 
---
Just because the game's already slipped this far away from 07, doesn't mean I can't try to stop it from getting any further.

It's funny, whenever I see long posts like this about nothing I think, "Why do we have to deal with people like this?"

I‚Äôm sure this has been asked a ton but is elite void worth using at barrows or should I just use tank gear? The void seemed convenient but it seems like a lot of people use tank gear, but there are also a lot of dumb people so idk, anyone actually done the calcs or tons of barrows and know what‚Äôs ‚Äúbest‚Äù. Ironman btw so tank gear would basically be the barrows items 
---
Also because they ***never*** have provided proof
---
People come in here saying "I was false flagged for botting", then a jmod says "no u were botting" and everyone goes "Ouuu SMACKDOWN!"
---
But there's no appeal and they fuck up constantly with other customer service shit. They make impossible claims like they carefully review every botting ban and don't unless they're 100% certain but then they have like 2 employees in charge of that and they claim they ban 150k accounts or something like that a month. Then you either don't ban 150k accounts a month or you don't carefully check them. But there's no appeals and there's no proof presented

They just explained how lol

I'm not a Timothy Leary fan for the same reasons you provide.  He dosed people who were unaware.  Psychedelics have been shown to help terminally ill patients come to terms with their death in numerous peer reviewed studies.  Anyone who suggests giving psychedelics to people with dementia, assuming they're far along enough to be so far gone that they don't understand what they're doing, is a degenerate.  OP doesn't have dementia.  The OP can do whatever the fuck he wants, but I know if I was about to die I'd want to trip before I went.  He can choose.

I like the idea of fighting together with the community against the game instead of fighting against each other (DMM)

Hopefully it's good. DMM has way too shoddy of a history regarding "insane" updates that turn out to be you auto complete this quest or they fix boxing.(jk no they didn't omegalul)
---
Whatever it is it better allow solo player's some opportunity to get into the end-game at least in a little bit of a reliable fashion. I'm not saying clan warfare has to go anywhere, but the mess that happens as the fog rolls in is so anticlimactic for a ton of players.
---
I'm sure people will disagree with me as I don't fuck with DMM at all, but I would watch it a least a bit more frequently if I knew I could watch solo players have a fair chance. I like solo players the most, as do others I am sure.

I don‚Äôt think people on here owe you an apology. I think Jagex owe you an apology for handling the situation poorly and falsely informing everyone that you weren‚Äôt the owner. That‚Äôs the main reason everyone got annoyed at you. They should have locked your account and investigated further before jumping to conclusions.

Q
---
not to mention he tried to appeal the ban and they say sorry the account perm banned and we dont have to prove it. wtf is this? how can you just ban a account without proof that it rwt? he lives in the same freaking house as me and only made the account to hold gp for me.

This isn't "open communication", it's corporate double speak for pretending that they haven't been burying their heads in the sand and putting off issues. The very same day as they put out this post, a Reddit user was given back an account after *2* jagex employees publicly slammed him. That's right, the same day they are claiming to care about customer support, they are being silent about two of their employees' incompetence causing a paying customer to both lose in-game assets *and* be insulted personally by many people who saw their comments. If this is open communication, then why hasn't there been an apology for such a public disgrace?

This basically sounds like the World Events that they had in rs3, and the first couple of those were very popular (except for the 3rd one with Tuska...). If this idea is more similar to the first couple world events (Bird and the Beast was amazing), then I can see a lot of people jumping on board!

My one memorable experience with a "bad caller" was a guy who just kept clicking whatever the hell he wanted, constantly. I had to follow the other attacker (I was playing collector), and ask him to call instead. I always looked for *his* call and went by that. After a couple rounds the rest of the party agreed the call-spammer was out of line and restarted without him.

Ehh I used to fly around a lot for work and my account never got locked. I have heard they keep track of hardware IDs too though which might have kept me safe despite the rapid and wide change in IPs.

This is a huge fuck up on their part, they cost you your bank. I would post this daily until it either doesn't hit the front page anymore, or a mod addresses the mistake. 
---
It makes jagex look horrible, they don't want this shit on the front page. If you posted this daily with a title like "Day X of jagex refusing to admit they fucked my account" then I could see it become a hit. 
---
No one wants to end up in a situation like this, and everyone wants to see how Jagex will respond to this. Since again, this is a huge fuck up on their part.

Eee..yikes. Yeah gmail is hands down the best. Umm id still try contacting hotmail though. For an old account like that a lot of times if you can explain what happened then they can help you out. Just give the best info you can. Try talking to hotmail support. A random old email like that doesnt hold much security leverage so it shouldnt be to big a deal. 
---
We pay, we say, unless it‚Äôs a sandstorm update that passed but jagex changed their mind.

Are you sure one of the wizards aren't attacking you? It's single combat area, so you can't attack him at the same time.

Hey u/brodaki, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

The computer you use has what‚Äôs called a hardware ID that I think they use. You can change this without too much trouble but I think it‚Äôs one of the things that when it is the same it keeps you safe.

Of course!

Yea, that's what I'm saying. The argument of, people who aren't knowledgeable on the topic just voting with the popular opinion, is weakened by the fact that they can just skip the question

Yes, I‚Äôm sure that must be quite the annoyance that you woke up like that.  It seems you‚Äôre taking your tantrum to all of my posts.   
---
You‚Äôre such a good boy. 
---
Nah, I traveled for work too and never had an issue but I‚Äôve also used a VPN when playing and that won‚Äôt lock it up. I think this is because they track your hardware ID. You can change your hardware ID without too much trouble if you want but if it is the same then it keeps you safe. Just my guess though.
---
I have had my bank flag my account because of my VPN usage though. They shut down my card and froze all transfers. I wasn‚Äôt even mad though I was impressed.

---
Well to be fair, was anyone really excited for the items themselves? IMO the items look nice and I plan to probably pick up the CTC 2 reward soon enough, but what was always interesting and hype to me was seeing people work together, share their ideas, etc. It became a "who cares" item I feel more because the hype behind solving it was dead, but if it was somehow made where you have to solve it yourself a LOT of people, myself included, wouldn't care to begin with.
---
Like the point I'm trying to make is that it was fun/cool seeing everyone work together on both CTC 1 and 2 and being able to get the items as a community. If it was somehow made that you have to solve it yourself, I personally as well as I'm sure many other people, wouldn't care enough to be invested in discovering the answers because of how bizarre they were.

Without bots a lot of the games items lose major suppliers. Lower supply means higher price. Or f2p noobs would be able to farm for gold more easily, resulting in a higher demand for bonds. Higher demand means higher priced bonds. How big a problem are the bots, really?

Sorry you're being downvoted when you're the only voice of reason in this thread. OP admits he account shared and then did a shit job of recovering his account the first time. Jagex, going off the shit info provided by OP, don't believe OP that it's his account when they compare that shit info to their legitimate info. Then OP provides better info to jagex when he recovers the account the second time and jagex side with him. Now OP and everyone else in this thread are just pitchforking back at jagex as hard as they pitchforked at op in the last thread, when from an outside perspective op did all of this to themselves.

Just getting back into the game and wants to actually play it and have fun, suggesting getting two 99's is probably a bit much lol.

If I were you I would set a goal of getting barrows gloves (completing Recipe for Disaster). It is an attainable account goal that will make you train a variety of skills to make all the quest requirements and it will expose to lots of different areas in the game.
---
I think they have specifically brought this up in dev streams because it was the main complaint when it was first introduced. They of course want you to visit priff but I don't think they have plans to make it a hub.
---
Why?
---
That's exactly what the people who oppose the things you support want you to think. Why not just vote? If you support something, vote for it. If you don't want something, vote against it. Because if you do vote, you cancel out a vote on the other side. By not voting at all you give the opposing side a net +1 vote.

Sometimes, like every other month or so I deliberately let my account run out of membership (while still having enough gp in my bank to buy a bond when I choose to), so I can have a little break or play more casually for a while. Work on f2p skills and so on. Its really refreshing, and keeps me motivated in the long run. Because having membership kinda feels like im oblicated to play, because not doing so feel like such a waste - might sound stupid I know. F2p on the other hand is much more casual....I might not log in for days when Im having my f2p break.
---
This tickles my OCD nicely. Looks great!

That's entirely not true, and I can prove it mathematically. A non voter gives the other side 1 more vote than they would have had.

It's possible, by watching a ton of videos of skilled players doing the inferno you pick up on a lot, and will have a much easier time of it than the people who did it on release with no guides or footage or watch, someone who's insanely skilled could potentially first try it with those resources combined with practicing all the techniques needed for inferno. The problem is it's easier to just start doing the inferno ASAP and learn that way, so unless someone had the goal of trying to first try inferno, they probably wouldn't go into the inferno prepared enough on their first attempt.

I've never voted in a poll because it seems rigged from the start.

Definitely the most important part

Justiciar allows you to pray mage and tank the rest (ranger and blobs) rather than pray flicking and thus making it easier.

Agreed

Just because you are doing fine without them affecting you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not affecting anyone else. Lack of empathy is the root cause of all problems. 
---
It is the same thing, sir. Gambling addiction is just as much of a devastating disease as drug addiction. You are only as strong as your weakest link and unfortunately for the world everyone isn‚Äôt strong minded. Why arrest heroin dealers? Because drug addiction leads to theft, assault, and other crimes and they‚Äôre whose pushing the shit.

I understand the resources are limited, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt speak up.

Fools said I you do not know! Silence like a cancer grows.

Thank you for confirmation!

Thank you! Messaged you regarding Internships as well. :) 
---
Inventory? That's how we spell it in the UK too?
---
60 seconds per level. 90 with Preserve prayer.
---
How many levels it give is 10% of your level + 3
---
And I think, not certain as it
---
might have been integrity change, the change in total level to be able to vote at all.
---
The change in methods such as wines of Zamorak telegrab to require total level to get the buffed method. This was interesting because it was ‚Äòreported‚Äô (by reddit) that adding a total level to access the upstairs room meant that bot/farmers who had the req. total from their current method of botting/farming just switched to improved wine of zammy instead.
---
Because polls doesn't need "fixing", because they're not broken. Reasoning to keeping them visible is that people can follow the vote as it's live, giving it more "authenticity".

---
Haha every time. 
---
Well yeah, but not in the same way as an Ironman limits themselves. Pures limit themselves to become more powerful than a normal account, whereas Ironmen limit themselves to make the game more challenging and interesting.
---
Which explains why all his stuff is gone... Not.
---
I don't think it's worth it to spend 10m on 7 magic levels, since magic levels arent that OP (it only gives accuracy and some mage defence). I think that the best way to increase your magic damage is to invest in magic strength gear like occult and tomented brace (as soon as you can afford it). 
---
The magic levels will come eventually when you start bursting slayer tasks so i wouldn't worry about it too much. 
---
Range levels on the other hand does matter a lot in damage.
---
But I play runescape only for pk.
---
But have acc just on iOS
---
I vote on every poll because my "no" or "yes" votes matter on that slim 75% chance shit
---
Messaged :)
---
Mate literally the first thing I said why it should be rectified is because of the scamming involved. Regulation came from casino talk because the dicing bots ARE NOT REGULATED. Gambling addiction is a serious issue, but not the issue I have a problem with. Some people can‚Äôt control whether or not they gamble, so the non regulated methods should be absolutely removed. TO PREVENT SCAMMING. 
---

task only area is pretty cool
---
Its not a cache issue, it‚Äôs a token issue. Tokens are distributed by jagex, you‚Äôll have to wait for a fix on their end.
---
Most obvious troll ever.
---
Why people play with public chat set to anything other than friends of off is beyond me.
---
so why would OPs friend threaten (and then follow through) with dropping his bank?
---
but WHYYYYYY
---
Thanks for the update, I don't know how everyone ignored that him being on the account didn't prove that he was the owner. 
---
It's amazing how quickly people pass judgements in either direction without some sort of critical thinking. 
---
What it seems like is that his friend or whoever gave him the account initially ended up letting him use it again. 
---
I believed you the whole time and felt bad for all the hate you got if that makes you feel better :) 
---
Raids 1 is Trident/Tent Whip/BP/Dragon Crossbow/BGS, while Raids 2 is Tent Whip/BGS with TriHelm Void plus DDS or Claws with sparing usage of Blowpipe/Trident.
---
This is the bare minimum and very functional on its own.  Raids 1 armor sets can be flexible to using Void but Ahrims is better than Mage Void.  TriHelm Void is BiS at Raids 2 with Bandos just being a bit extra.  The catch is not being a deadweight at raids in the first place, hopefully with kc to show off.  Bringing a TBow/Scythe is definitely not a requirement.
---
It is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, after all
---
The creator of the account is the one who took the bank.
---
However as they originally created the account and OP was just using it they were completely within their right to.
---
neigh!
---
Is that a range by a chest?
---
Yes, I understood all of this from your previous comments, the issue is still not worth the time to fix.
---
However, on another note, we need to remove The Wilderness and enforce trade limits to prevent scamming!
---
Sounds like it
---
One of the huge problems with polling is the double barreled questions you guys constantly ask. Why do you guys ask these so frequently? It's hard to get an accurate poll if you have people that like or dislike one part of the idea but then don't like the other part. Or like one part os they vote yes 
---
**I know this has been suggested on reddit but can jagex and the community look into offering ironman max capes. The capes would not provide anything different than a traditional max cape.** 
---
as shown in this post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b2ylll/ironman\_max\_capes\_but\_styled\_to\_match\_each\_modes/?sort=top](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b2ylll/ironman_max_capes_but_styled_to_match_each_modes/?sort=top)

I think it would be a unique way to highlight the achievements. Since there is ironman armour. What harm would including a cape recolour for those whom took that plunge?
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄBRODAKI WON'T REPLY TO THIS THREADü¶Äü¶Ä

I worry that the current attitude towards the game from most players is what kills content like that rather than any lack of changes or rewards. Players are often so engrossed by the grinding aspect and xp gain that they don‚Äôt put time aside for things like that. Even if jagex reworked a lot of that content and added new rewards to me it seems that would do about as much good as them posting a psa about its existence. Some would go back to it for a few weeks and it will die again. It‚Äôs just in the nature of the game 
---
Hey, I think it's pretty great that you messaged those two users :) - I don't want internship info or anything, I just think the level of community interaction Jagex has is wonderful. Thanks for being cool!
---
the hacker also threatened to clean the account. i dont care if they had a damn semen sample the account should be locked until the dispute is resolved 
---
I don't much of the point, really. Any non-f2p player will only use bronze-rune for a very limited time, and every melee weapon past rune has its uses (except maybe Torag's Hammers).
---
Saying "there's no con at all" is just plain stupidity, it's a waste of dev time that will fix nothing since people will still use whatever has the best DPS. If anything, a rework of these low level smithable weapons should probably come with a smithing rework (if it ever happens).
---
Now that your account can speak with dolphins, what is your next goal?
---
Wum bots?
---
All I see is an eagle hunting for food.
---
I was exactly right, again lul.
---
Yeah why not, I kind of feel bad about making this post now. :( 
---
Oh and would you look at that :^)
---
‚ÄúHighly‚Äù it had someone recover the account with a lot of information and then someone with no information try to recover it. Why should it be locked because someone failed to recover it? It wouldn‚Äôt fix anything - the original person would just be able to recover it again. 
---
Jagex did everything right and there‚Äôs no way it would jump 5000 miles in 10 minutes twice and not be dodgy. 
---
not even slightly cool unless BTW
---
Obviously only OP and/or the creator would know the answer as to why they recovered it again, rather than just registering OP's email back on the account. I can only speculate that it was an attempt to make it appear as though the OP was the one recovering the account from the original location.
---
The IP address for both this recovery and the first one that started this chain of events are identical and the OP is the last one to log into the account. If we had indeed given it to a hijacker, I'm not sure how the OP would have managed to regain access to the account.
---
this will never happen
---
id rather them vertical
---
does that seriously not sound like a suspicious thing to do? 
---
I think you would only roll on a pet in pvp if you win so if you afk your team is more likely to lose. But i agree its not as simple as just throwing a pet in without any other changes.
---
Thought so. This reddit jumps ships so quickly. 
---
99% of the people flaming Weath originally on this post were probably flaming OP in his original posts. Now they‚Äôre all back to flaming OP. 
---
The fact is, very little people on this sub know how the recovery system works, and think adding an auth delay will fix everything. 
---
okay but what about the second successful account recovery? does that not sound a LITTLE BIT quick for someone to forget their own password? 
---
People get hijacked because they somehow leak their details. Be it their current details or their previous details.
---
Most people for example still re-use the exact same details everywhere. If one service gets compromised you will be vulnerable everywhere. Therefore you should always use unique passwords and preferably usernames and emails for important things.
---
If you have all the security features enabled both on your RuneScape account as well as the registered email, you have drastically decreased the chances of getting hijacked.
---
The main issue is that we can't seem to do anything against a recovery hijack through the recovery form. We can't disable compromised details ourselves for example. At best you're able to preemptively send a strong recovery appeal yourself to give Jagex a template to compare other appeals with. 
---
This is crazy good
---
Except you‚Äôre still full of shit OP. Glad you‚Äôve been  smacked down once again 
---
But why would they drop the bank and untradeables after recovering back their own account? If they really were the original creator, then it's no longer OP's account after they've recovered it - dropping items doesn't harm anyone but themself. Plus trying to scam the clan members looks really really suspicious.
---
Even more, why would they then recover the account *from themself*? The order we have for definite is:
---
1. The supposed-original-owner has the account
---
2. OP claims they're going to make a recovery from original IP, original email, etc.
---
3. There was a very strong recovery made, which ends in OP being given the account
---
Weath guesses that the recovery in 3 was made by the supposed-original-owner, which doesn't make much sense to me if they were already the one who had the account at that point. Even if they did have a very sudden change of heart and decide to give the account to OP, why make a recovery first?
---
So, for a second time, you're going to lock an account just for me to unlock it?
---
This is all really interesting though, thank you for being more transparent on what information you were given in the initial recovery appeal, because it sounds to me like my information was entirely compromised, more than I even thought. The hacker's geo-location or whatever, whether it's spoofed or not, he was not the account creator. Because that is me. This is not a case of an account seller then recovering the account. 
---
A for the whole 5000 mile thing, I have been upfront with this the entire time. For all intents and purposes, I live in two different countries and travel back frequently. And I live for the most parts, in the US with my brother, who I pk with on occasion. After sending in the recovery appeal from the UK, and seeing in my email that it was successful, I immediately hit up my brother and told him to get on my account and let me know if the untradeables were dropped. We talked for an hour and I had him take a screenshot we could use to post for reddit. Why did I not just do this myself? The computer I trekked halfway across the world to get to, the very computer that I knew would prove I was the account creator, is obviously my father's fifteen year old windows xp piece of junk. I did not want to even go about installing runelite on that. None of this matters anyway. I'm not sure what you're trying to say. That me moving, or traveling is somehow indicative of something. Do you want some proof of me being who I am? If you're making accusations, I'll gladly bust out my laptop and log in to the account in the UK. 
---
I am the account creator. I made that recovery appeal that was granted. You just locked it, for some reason (like you locked the other account). Now I am going to unlock it.  Whatever. What I want to know is what happened to the wealth that was taken off the account? Did you punish the hacker who RWTed my bank? Or are you just busy locking people's accounts for them to unlock in some hilarious game
---
Smells like my grandmas house.
---
for what?
---
Is he confessing to arson?
---
Could i also get the information for internship? 
---
so the original creator performs the first successful recovery and gets their own account back. then OP makes a failed recovery from another country. then OP obtains the exact IP address of the original account that jagex never gave to him, fills it out with new information, then goes back to his IP address in another country. that doesn't make sense 
---
Hey man, if you're on bedrock you need to either host a realm for people to join, that way people can build while you're offline, you can get a 30 day free trial then it's like 9 bucks a month after that i think. Alternatively people can add your gamer tag and you can open your world to friends, however no one will be able to be online if you're offline. 
---
I noticed a stated issue regarding polling was the lack of participation by the majority of the player base. This being said is there any other method in making polling more accessible? I know the stations are already in banks all over Runescape, but what about introducing a second login screen dedicated to the polls that a player can vote through prior to getting in game. 
---
At that point if a player skips past that login screen then the reasons of why they don't vote may simply imply that they don't care or aren't interested in the content.
---
Maybe even integrating it into dialogues i.e when accessing your bank or the GE. In the end voting is the most important thing we have in terms of voicing our opinions. Yes at times things aren't implemented or updates go unpolled but ultimately these votes carry a significant weight for the future of OSRS.
---
Yeah, I'm guessing you only heard the sound on one of your computers.
---
If that's the case try to reinstall Runelite. (don't get scammed, there are a hell of a lot of fake Runelite clients out there.)
---
If it still happens after that, it would seem something else on your PC is interfering with Runelite, or your sound drivers are dying? :S
---
That's really well put. Truthfully, you're very right. I can see that danger like this is an extremely valuable lesson at an extremely low cost - and set up players to avoid the same in real life situations. I suppose I felt it an injustice to the new mobile players who've *bought* into gold buying and being 'robbed' of wealth with a real world value attached. 
---
they're fine until something goes wrong and you need to speak to somebody. then you use the "message center" to try and resolve your issues which often isn't replied to so then you have to call them but it's *really* hard to get through to a fucking human.
---
for anyone that knows this struggle, the best way i've found to get a human to pick up the phone is to just keep swearing at the robot.
---
It's not but I've gotta post it with a photoshop mock-up of the interface for it to hit the front page.
---
Maybe it would look weird. But doesn't an entire mmo of everyone using the same damn scimitar look odd. If there dead weapons anyway might aswell atleast give people the option to use them.
---
the first one involves op convincing a guy who was willing to steal several hundred dollars worth of wealth to stop being mean, which isn't exactly easy. the second one involves op knowing the information that weath was 100% absolutely undeniably certain only the original accounts creator could know.
---
Sincere question, would a VPN explain certain drastic location changes or can you guys see through that? I have been curious of that since I started using one due to my work and new geographic location.

4 months ago and still same issue.

Good question ill have to go back and see. Could it be that I get to close to one of them? Cause sara and growler doesnt seem to through mage pray on youtube

Wilderness bosses- The team mentioned they'd like to address this in the past. There are 2 problems today:    
---
They are safe-spotable
---
Completely in the wild encourages a 'hunter/hunted' scenario between pvm'ers and pkers and pushes pet hunters to PVP situations. This is not a positive player experience.    
---
Suggestions:
---
      
---
    
---
- Put them in their own separate enclosures, similar to KBD where you have to enter the wild to get there, but once you're there it's safe.
---
- Additional to the above, remove their safe spot mechanics
---
Additional to the above, lower their damage (it's absurd atm)
---
- Additional to the above, reduce their average loot value to account to account for reduced risk
---
How do you do this? I am trying on iPhone SE.
---
It'd be interesting if bronze-rune daggers were given a spec. Right now their niche is as the worst beginer weapon, which I guess is fine, but it could be cool. It would be hard to balance and definitely effect pvp though. 
---
**I** was 99 defence - **then *Jagex* ** rolled me *down* to 1 *defence* **.** *Then they rolled it* back up to 99. *Is that a little clearer* friend?
---
Thanks man! Will definitely set up a realm in the near future :) 
---
The cape is a "I'm a maxed HCIM" cape, not a "I maxed as a HCIM cape". Should we also allow anyone that goes from UIM or HCIM to regular ironman to keep their "I'm a maxed UIM/HCIM" cape? Or if someone de-irons, would they keep their "I'm a maxed IM" cape?
---
a lot of the top teir items such as raids 2 also is hit, i reckon its due to the value of gold increasing because of the duel arena tax.
---
I like both aswell, rs3 for my main, and my iron man is on osrs :). I have to agree about how everything seems to degrade as you get high tier gear in rs3, very frustrating how much its used
---
are you seriously going to jump on the bandwagon this fucking quickly?
---
It could make it appear as though you have drastically changed locations but we wouldn't use that alone to conclude that you're not the account owner.
---
Why trigger? And I tend to overlook slight differences in spelling e.g. dropping the 'u' out of colour, flavour, humour etc as not being all that serious.
---
I've seen a lot of Americans fail to spell pretty simple words as a result of your inability to avoid turning a T into a D if it's in the middle of a word, and making A sound like O. If you don't see where I'm coming from, say "noded" and "posta" out loud and tell me it sounds any different when you say "noted" or "pasta" - and no, you're not saying it how Italians say it.
---
Most American accents struggle with various sounds in English and I can only summise that the American school system is pretty poor. Over time American English will get further and further away from its origins in English, but don't pretend that it is more correct than English about anything
---
See it doesn't make sense is what the problem is. When the account was hacked and when OP received the account back were both appeals from the same IP. Either both the hacker and OP had enough info to recover the account and one of them spoofed their IP, or the hacker recovered the account twice and gave it back to OP.
---
I have the same Problem. I think when you log in, the game sounds are on for a second, and thats what you hear
---
the real reason why I train construction
---
Most MMOs have a BIS weapon that everyone uses. It's not anything crazy. 
---
I'd still be for a change if done correctly, I'm just saying that there would be some obvious issues. There's a reason it hasn't happened and it's not just because people are too lazy to do it. 
---
so if the information is this muddled, weath could not possibly know for sure that the first recovery was done by the accounts rightful owner. so he lied about that during his smackdown and cant be trusted
---
You calling him fat?
---
There should be a fremennik NPC named Holgate who will offer this service to players if they've completed the elite diary.
---
Seems like an honest mistake to me. The first appeal apparently had enough information to convince him that it was the owner of the account. I think saying he can't be trusted is a little over dramatic.
---
&gt; Jagex support is not a kangaroo court to resolve disputes in clans or between friends. The current rules set up allows all of this to exists
---
The issue is...there was no dispute over the second account.
---
It's as if you're incapable of understanding what happened, and instead want to argue which is a severe sign of autism. 
---
AHHHHHHH not my reddit points! This guy went 85 attempts with a fucking t bow LMFAO  he deserves to be flamed

---
Oh I‚Äôll get it done, having too much fun building it :) 
---
So its true, the wildy is about farming unprepared and unwilling pvmers that have only come out due to jagex forcing PvM In the wildy. Without PvM the wildy would die. I love it...

can somebody explain this? ty
---
Spears are absolutely obsolete due to Hastae. A Hasta and Defender gives more attack *and* defensive bonuses. A Hasta and Shield gives far superior defensive bonuses. This means the *only* reason to use a Spear is to get a +5 Magic Def buff instead of -1 or -2...
---
Suggestion: buff Spears to be exactly in the mid ground between a Hasta + Shield/Defender.
---
A Dragon Spear would have: +68 Stab, +67 Slash, +67 Crush, +63 Strength, +26 Stab Def, +27 Slash Def, +29 Crush Def, -2 Mag Def, and +13 Range def.
---
This way instead of min/maxing for DPS or Defence the Spear would provide a nice balance between both.
---
gotcha, most of my items are membs though, for example, I have 130 burnt pages. Can i drop those to another account or would i have to have membs to transfer that as well
---
Hurrrr durrrr someone flamed me in a YouTube comment better put it on reddit

I do like 25 runs before banking everytime. Normally have full blessed for range bonus and the cape is for a slight mage bonus. Yes its occult necklace. I only use 3 drinks a run using my set up with sol. May be odd to you but it works for me lol.
---
He needs to "get a life" with 42 stats and &lt;1/2k total?

Are you burnt out after you've completed tutorial island?
---
I play solo haha no real reason to talk to a whole lot of people
---
Claws: Make faster (and overall better dps) than scimitars, but unable to pick up any loot.  
---
Just use a ring of wealth and glory teles to travel around these areas. I reached the agility level to crawl through that underground lately, close to never had to use it. Unnecessary.
---
Why keep a 2h as a ko weapon only? It sacrifices the shield so shouldn't it give a DPS benefit against some npc over the other one handed weapons? Uninformed guess but what about a strength bonus so it hits higher but not faster or more accurate than say the short\long sword?
---
Once! I got somewhat too engrossed in a YouTube video and before I noticed, poof, dead.

It's not really an issue, only takes a few minutes to run back.

do u have 75rc with a giant and large pouch, this makes a huge diff. also those 72k/h rates are actually near impossible, u need to bank + tele in about 4 game tick i believe, which is done by using mousekeys or ahk, dont miss any ticks walking, clicking altar, everything combined. if ur more of a casual, like myself, u might wanna go ZMI as ull get similair xp rates for under half the effort

Man, how else will i let other people know the fact that i have killed 10 cows in a row, and all 10 of them dropped cowhides?!
---
Recently I started an F2P-only UIM account. I prefer it due to the minimalism.
---
Are you saying that OP is the ev guy?
---
If you stack your damage the speed of the 2h doesn't matter since it's still slower than the main weapons and you time it so it hits instantly. You don't hit twice with a 2h.
---
Is that a poorly executed /woosh by ev guy? Yikes..
---
unless your team is actively not doing the raid skipping rope is always more efficient.
---
I don't like the idea of balancing everything just by making them faster. You're basically balancing them by making them more similar to scimitars. I think the attack speeds should be kept the same but increase the other stats so the DPS becomes competitive with the scimitar without actually making them faster.
---
Damn quite unfortunate 
---
whats new, evscape being a dumb twat
---
If you got Amazon prime? You could make a free prime account with your card, cancel it straight away but keep it for a month.
---
Next link it to a twitch account and link the twitch account to RuneScape using Twitch Loot screen. Boom 14days free members.
---
One-time use codes generated offline is the way to go, you copy it in paper, memorice it or w/e , as a replacement of recovery requests for account recovery.
---
Then, authy reqs that to be removed/passwords changed etc. So this way your account cannot be lose due to 1/2fa  2/phisical item to remove 2fa

Truly stunning

It's under my belief the community trust the voters and vote on subjects they are passionate about. There is no reason to change the polling system except hiding the poll results. Players demanding the poll results also show how much trust the vocal playerbase has in the Jagex staff.
---
According to mods it's technically against the rules but not enforced unless you use it to get certain accomplishments without completing them yourself (like having someone else do Inferno for you). Also, because it's against the rules, you have no recourse if the original account owner decides to recover stuff to take back your account (like what probably happened here) since Jamflex isn't going to support your claim to keep the account if you broke the rules to get it in the first place.
---
Basically, nobody's going to stop you from account-sharing but it's an at-your-own-risk type thing.
---
&gt;You literally responded to me arguing I just made a statement
---
&gt;For noobs a glory is a lot
---
&gt;Yh but its unnecessary having to come up with that money when you can just not lose it in the first place 
---
&gt;Let's say a noob with a 500k bank has a wildy task, why would they take a glory instead of a strength ammy?
---
&gt;12k for a 500k bank is a lot.
---
&gt;This conversation is pointless this is my last reply
---
&gt;12k out of a 500k bank... 
---
&gt;When I was a broke I accidentally emptied a prayer pot and my chest hurt.
---
&gt;Also that's the whole point, no one wants to go cut trees to get back a glory they lost 
---
&gt;But it's unnecessary if a noob can just wear a strength ammy and not lose it in the first place is my point. Why lose the 12 then have to go get it back when you can just not lose it in the first place
---
These are your posts of you constantly arguing that 12k is a lot of money I don't even understand what you're talking about saying you aren't arguing. I'm literally here starting at the retarded dribble that fell from your sticky fingers onto your keyboard and you deny it. Jesus Christ dude 
---
Yeah. Eventually i had enough. Building mines of moria, what a headache it was.
---
I always wondered why claws are 2 weapons and you only hit once. Why not slow them down and allow them to deal 2 hits? Makes sense seen as though the character is wearing 2 of them. A worthy sacrifice IMO as you're having to give up to option of wearing a shield.

What progress has been made on this, and can we expect to see wider availability of the orb any time soon?

Yes. Without the gauntlets you will continue to burn shark all the way to 99. With gauntlets you'll stop burning at 94. With hosidius range and gloves you'll stop at 89 :)

Why would you change something that is used for a specific purpose for 15 years, just so you can make it do the exact same thing as a rune scimmy?

Having poll results hidden until you vote doesn't do much, should be hidden until poll is complete

I agree with you. Tbh i like seeing the results.

It's more than obvious with anyone with half a brain that this account is involved in some really fucking shady stuff. There is no way anything you say is true, you're just trying to save face after being smacked down a second time.

I don't watch his series but if he did train using gear transferred from his main he ruined the account. Maybe he can use ad revenue to buy a dictionary

It is pretty sad that Jagex has to put time and resources in certain area's that were perfectly fine. 2FA delay won't solve a thing for most people who get hacked. After all these people fail to secure a fucking runescape account. Just let that sink in for the mooment. They have their info all over the website so a simple delay only really delays the inevitable, getting hacked. Meanwhile a few friends and myself have followed the simple instructions Jagex gave us and we never expierenced problems. Also pretty funny, I visit lots of OSRS communities but only on reddit it seems people have problems with getting hacked and complain about it. I've been 4+ years in a clan now, and really only had one person who got hacked and it was their own stupid fault. For fucks sake, clicking phising links in 2019. Getting hacked is awful, but be the better person and admit were you went wrong and improve your security in these area's. Most of the time Jagex simply can't prevent this because the person who got hacked has all their info for the taking.
---
Same goes for customer support. They could help you, but you'll be returning the next day simple because the hacker has all the information they need to recover again. This will lead to people with real problems not being helped due the amount of people who fail to secure their runescape account. I'll admit I've never been in touch with customer support since I don't got any problems whatsoever but the very few people I know who got in touch with it, got helped without a problem. Maybe reddit makes it a bigger problem then it really is? I don't know for sure.
---
Hiding poll results. It failed the poll two (2) times already, seems like the majority of the community doesn't want it. Only time is see people complain about this is on Reddit. I'm genuinely sorry you can get your own opinion influenced by others. Nothing wrong with that if the others could provide wellthought and decent arguments. Unfortunately this isn't the case, the whole argument to hide polls is "I can't make up my own mind and will vote for something I don't like but I still do because it has the majority of the polls."  Also I've only seen this "problem" rise the last year. Why is it suddenly a problem while it wasn't before? Is it because of the influx of new/returning players or what?
---
About anti cheat: fair points. I play mostly F2P these days and I can assure anyone in here that it is filled with bots. Glad they have total worlds so it isn't that bad but still could use some work. Shame to say it, but botting is a part of RS and it will always be. Sucks but that's just how it is. There's only one working solution for this and we all know how that ended. All I could think of is hire a well known bot maker and make him anticheat. Worked out the last time if I recall correctly.

The state of PVP. I could ramble and rage about this and write a 200+ page essay about this but simply put: The fucking clan cups flamex, where did they go? Where's this support and features for clans promised over 3 years ago? Though they gave us rev caves, which revived some of the wildy and made a great hotspot overnight. Still it feels like PVP is seriously neglected. I'm not asking for weekly, or even monthly updates, but there are some things that could be prioritised over others IMO. Also making the barrier for PVP lower is a good thing IMO. PVP is imo one of the most iconic things of OSRS, I really hope they can create updates that allow more people to learn and get into PVP.

&gt;1. We will continually survey all players, rather than just those on  Reddit or Twitter, to understand what you think is important from a  Customer Support perspective. We‚Äôll use this to inform our priorities  and measure our progress.
---
Great, I hope they publish the results as I am very interested on how the majority of the community stands on these subjects instead of Reddit alone. Not a fan of reddit because I think it is an echochamber. I've accounts on various forums so that allows me to see various problems/suggestions that you won't see in here. 
---
Why? Jagex granted the appeal. It's also possible to boot a hijacker off your acc and to lock your acc. If brodaki did all the things necessary, he didnt have to post on reddit. Idk why Jagex said it wasnt his acc tho but they mustve had good reasons. Maybe the acc was sold/bought and multiple ppl can recover it
---
It's about getting the gear, the series has nothing to do with his stats. 
---
Huh? Is there a joke that he gets all the dismissed genies?
---
The dfs gives positive magic defence when fully charged, and the dfw gives positive melee defence when fully charged. It would only make sense for the wyvern shield to give positive ranged defence when fully charged.

Hello there team of the OSRS! I have a question about the one-handed Event RPG equivalent weapon that was mentioned when the tench poll was removed. Any progress/ideas towards that, when will that weapon come out? Is OSRS team trying to work on this or is it at hold at this moment? Can we expect the weapon this year?
---
I would argue that being high would mean he is not the best version of himself mentally which caused him to act naive
---
He's not the brightest. He said mage needed rabalancing (buffed) because he kept splashing on black d'hide while using a staff of water and salad robes. I'm not saying black d'hide isn't arguably a little op for the price but complaining you're splashing on level 70 anti-magic armour with a level 1 staff and level 20 robes is just dumb.

Alch stuff for a bond for an alt then drop stuff to it

This really is the dumbest way possible to get scammed though. You literally handed him your shit. I can only imagine what the other dude is thinking
---
You're right and that's good, but changes would benefit them to actually be used in combat and wouldn't make those specs OP since the specs aren't reliant on combat stats. 
---
You do realize that for every bond sold in game, someone has payed real money for it. Game time isn‚Äôt generated when someone buys it with GP. There needs to have been one purchased for real money in order to sell it for GP. There is no loss of money to Jagex, and only an increase in income.

But you would still need a decent amount of information on the account to do that. If they had malicious intent and access to that information they would just try to recover the account even if it wasn't for griefing.

Why are you calling this guy a retard for not being aware of a youtuber. It just means he's avoided the plague of posts involving swampletics. Don't get me wrong, I love his content but people really have beaten that horse into the fuckin ground
---
Go apologise to ur friend, he doesn't deserve that shit.

Ev is a favorite of mine, it‚Äôs sad to see him flame someone that isn‚Äôt a well know stream friend. It would be different if he was flaming purp or Ron where their friendship is known. But flaming a fan is pretty uncool

I didnt read all the text but i skimmed it and saw nothing about content winner rewards delivers

Ah yes that's obviously what their series is about!
---
&gt; [...] jagex just revises via feedback until people are happy enough for them to poll it.
---
So better than havig no polls at all, no? Thus it is neither desteoying the game nor was it a mistake.
---
If you don't like hitting 0, stop using equipment the enemy is clearly strong against, 4head. Use one of the just as easily accessible items.
---
It's like complaining that you can't penetrate a tank with a sword, while it cuts down people nicely, why can't it just cut tanks just as easily.
---
A problem doesn't exist? That many items are only differently labelled "alch to get gold" packages because they are useless due to bad balance design?
---
Your comment reeks of "I've been using nothing but whip for years and I refuse to put in effort to change"
---
Oh good! I always liked ezscape
---
Yes.
---
&gt; level 1 staff
---
I do find it kind of odd that magic weapons have such low bonuses in general though. I suppose it is offset by the fact that robes etc. also give you bonuses that you can't get from melee armour.
---
I also find battlestaves and mystic staves to be some of the most pointless items in game since they gave you melee bonus rather than magic bonus.
---
Then my dumbass died because I couldn't pinpoint the safespot to kill the tree spirit, I'm about to neck myself.

---
Not sure where you get that idea from to be honest, the fact that I disagree with how some people behave and voice my opinion in that regard doesn't mean I'm getting 'worked up'. But I suppose our definitions of getting worked up are a little different maybe. For me, getting worked up would mean I chose to bother going to EVscape's video and dislike and comment on his shit, which I couldn't care less about really.
---
You take that back. Take it back!
---
Because it made sense for the hacker to threaten to drop his untradables on his own account, or what? He even mentioned he did share his account for PK. Well shit, he even said he knew the guy that hacked him, which is proven to be true based on the most recent mod reply lol.
---
*Votes first option on every poll*

Why? Outfit is a waste of time, and autoweed is just ezscape

So then go recreate the shit woox has done to start. When you're done with that we'll start coming up with specific possible scenarios for you to run through.

You seem to have a very fundamental misunderstanding on the word skill. Or just english?

You can be skilled at near anything. There people that have more skill in a mundane task than you have in your entire lifetime.

Yea, nobody gives a fuck about your drops.

Basically its a method where if you get bad positioning you run to the south pillar to preposition the monsters almost always. This takes a lot of the rng out of the fight because you can almost guarantee that you'll get a good position every wave.

Eh, this project is different to others because OP is just doing one block = one in-game tile, which is fine, but buildings will look tiny and claustrophobic.

if you have half a brain in your head youd realise voting is supposed to be completely non biased. how can it be that when you can see the winning vote. you dont poll things like this anyway i have no idea why they thought they should. some things should be implemented just because its the right thing to do. you think the government irl thought hey lets ask voters if they wanna see other peoples votes? 
---
"just do 5000 hours of fishing, and you'll have 75 agility no problem"

This will not happen because they will not even answer to this suggestion in this thread. Reason being that if they tried doing the engine work or whatever the fuck needed to make these changes happen they would inevitably create some superglitch again that makes tbows spawn. They would rather just not learn to code and not answer to this suggestion than do these simple changes and still manage to royally fuck up.

with a few changes this could be fucking amazing!

Finally someone speaking some truth, I am also with experience in the account buying and selling from years ago and even a couple years later I have seen people have their accounts recovered. &amp; Not only that I have seen friendships ruined in real life over stupid account recoveries, end of the day make your own account, do not give any details away ever and get on with your own shit instead of false accusing Jmods for not doing there job when in reality they‚Äôre protecting others and doing the job they were given.

I also can just put in Justiciar and run to the south pillar. Why do you think I need to do things the more difficult way? As someone else said, I could solo bandos, pray flicking every minion, while wearing full rune because its "harder". Or I could wear good armor and do it the better way.
---
Don't pretend that somehow the way I got the cape was invalid. I used what was available to me using money that I made.
---
The problem is you either nerf it and make level 70 ranged armour pretty useless or artificially increase the price by increasing the price to tan it but that would make crafting black d'hide prohibitively expensive and cause a load of economic issues like they caused with climbing boots. 
---
It's printed in PLA so it's quite strong and you can bend it quite a bit without it snapping, even the thin pieces like the guard can take quite a bit of force.
---
How about the pet just constantly annoy you to vote instead
---
Exactly.
---
That‚Äôs the point, it is overpowered because you get very good bonuses for zero cost especially since magic has the worst accuracy of all styles. 
---
Nobody complains about the bonuses of Karil‚Äôs or Armadyl, because they have a substantial cost. 
---
Like "No, public was on." Or like "'no public' was on"
---
For me personally. Tears of guthix is one. It is laughably easy/short and the passive exp is definitely worth it.
---
RFD is an obvious one. I always thought it would require tremendous effort and that it was difficult. Turned out I waited long enough to already meet all requirements. And most of the subquests are short/easy, there are only a few that require a little more effort/time.
---
Bone voyage is the other big one. I never trained hunter as I saw no point in it. Then I did the quest and fell absolutely in love with fossil island (birdhouses and hardwood trees mainly). Wish I started earlier.
---
Jagex, we all know this is a joke, but... please, make it happen
---
                                                        W
---
Not really significant apart from the fact that it is slightly annoying to balance 42 HP with 42 attack/strength/defence. It means you have to cannon range and splash magic.
---
Well actually it's well under 400 hours, nowhere near 5000, but okay
---
Oh really, I thought there would be more than one.  Anyway, the real reason this can't happen is because giving people incentive to vote will cause a lot of people to just randomly pick options to get it over with quickly.
---
Gotcha. I only started playing way after Zulrah was put into the game so I never saw the negative effects. I'd rather be engaged for a few hours and earn 20m rather than afk skilling for better rates.
---
Eh? I came home one afternoon to find 6 emails from PayPal about my business debit card being used. One phone call, couple number presses for a human, added to the queue to be called back and 20 minutes later I was speaking with someone. The agent was awesome and PayPal credited my account, which I then transferred to my checking account.
---
This is one of several instances where PayPal support has been perfectly fine for me. Always sucks when I read about people having crap times with CS from companies, I never do.
---
He literally said in a video that he‚Äôll transfer items over to speed up training then transfer them off. Thus, not effecting the series but improving content... so many people calling him out without having watched his videos. Or watched with half a brain. 
---
First ever big pvm drop XD
---
This is horrendous. Support.
---
I don't think it is the best xp/h out there
---
He refused to bridge me in bh Edge bcs of Aussie ping Lol
---
I haven't watched the series but if it's all about pking to achieve gear why is he even bothering to show training? Surely that's just unrelated content. Especially if he started the series with some stats, might as well just say "I trained up X skill" and then go back into the relevant content of pking.
---
That could be true, but I just couldn't make it past the waves. :/ After I got zuk to half hp that 2nd time, I was 100% sure given enough Zuk fights I could get it, but I probably had 40 failed wave attempts after that, never getting back to Zuk.... Justiciar made the waves far easier for me to deal with. If I had to do it again I'd take Justiciar again, I never even got close to dying. 
---
The only immediate problem I see is F2P PKing with Ranged into rune 2h.
---
If you sped that up, not only will Ranged become more powerful, it will also become more safe. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying NO, I‚Äôm just calling it as I see it.
---
It really really is. There's a reason very few people have the cape.
---
can't believe he went through your history 
---
Lol 75m in 60 hours at zulrah? Think you're doing something wrong there buddy.
---
Ironmeme maybe?
---
You joke but he just linked his reddit acc to his rs account. Better hope he aint been posting no personal info on reddit
---
I'm confused on why this is causing so much drama.
---
EV said at the start of the series that he'd be transferring items from his main if the whole purpose was just to train.
---
He transfered the items in the last episode for the sole purpose of training.
---
You guys have to realize - it's not a standard from scratch series, EV had this pking account pre-built and his goal was really to learn how to PK.
---
Plus- he's providing free content--stop bitching. 
---
Ev and Purpp both flame their respective community but as of late tend to flame the wrong people for no reason and end up just shitting all over some innocent dude or someone who's pointing out a solid point such as this. It used to be funny and light hearted but these days it's just embarrassing yet they're followers are too spastic to give a fuck and encourage it. Ignore it and move on.
---
The "hacker" (in reality the account owner and most likely some sort of firend of brodaki) had the correct IP, all the recovery info, while brodaki didn't (and still doesn't) have shit
---
How much bank you made off the plebs risking more than they should?
---
Thank you! Yeah, the grind was really long. I mostly play on my bus rides to and from work, so usually no more than an hour in a day.
---
This sounds reasonable - thanks!
---
But it‚Äôs because you submitted a recovery with the wrong email that caused this whole to become what it is. 
---
How is that far-fetched considering the overreaction he gave in this post's image?
---
Gotta love reddit. "I feel like I'm losing an argument. Let me dig through their profile and attack them personally about something completely unrelated! Surely I'll be seen as reasonable and level headed after that!"
---
Stop saying ‚Äúhacker‚Äù. He wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhacked‚Äù. 
---
What do you not understand here? The ORIGINAL account owner recovered the account. He threatened to drop his untradeables because he didn‚Äôt work for them,  but he‚Äôs still the original account owner. 
---
Big support for Zogre changes
---
Ah ok thanks 
---
definitely did not expect that lol
---
If that's the case, the poll results have to be hidden. Otherwise, people will just push the vote that is already in the lead which will cause a bias. But at the same time, it's easier to vote against since it takes 25% people to go against to fail a poll.

Every non Ranged PKer would have to re-learn the timings of ranged into R2h so they don‚Äôt get stacked out, because it would be faster.
---
Buffing(Revisiting) one style of combat and not all three just breaks* PvP and ‚Äúcould‚Äù affect the economy.
---
* Essentially you make it much harder for mages and much easier for Ranged to R2h switchers, while simultaneously making melee so diverse it punishes you for not melee PKing until everyone adjusts to the new switches.
---
Damn man, ive 33kc and only got a flail

you can watch any PK youtuber say ‚Äúthis is an account i had access to.‚Äù and it‚Äôs always a pure with 99 ranges 1 def. 60 attk 99 str with a name and bank you‚Äôve never seen before and it is never seen again in a video. that‚Äôs exactly what he‚Äôs referring to lmfao. none of those accounts have been investigated or locked bc of their appearance in the videos? we‚Äôre supposed to establish a base of trust because they shared the content so ‚Äúwhy would they do wrong?‚Äù
---
If you pk with gear from scratch it seems fine to me? Whether or not his stats are higher or lower don‚Äôt seem to matter. For example a max main could still do a from scratch
---
What is this witchcraft
---
Congrats! I'm still waiting for my first at 47 kc
---
He didn't really ruin his series tho, the "from scratch" is only his equipment to pk, his account already had some stats leveled up. 
---
You could check youtube for some advice, there should be plenty of "things to do in f2p osrs" videos out there. 
---
Personally I would suggest looking for a "things to do before becoming member osrs" video, do those things and then buy membership. There are a few deals that grant you a cheap price per month. But personally I find f2p too boring after a few weeks or months if you don't know what to do.

Imagine flaming a series and saying that it is ruined without even watching episode 1 where he literally said that he was going to do this. The whole point of a series is to make money through PKing on a 1 def pure account. His bank was 0 at the beginning, but he had the stats. The amount of people that actually use their brains on reddit is astonishingly low.
---
Dude this is my youtube wtf
---
Elvarg keeps handing my ass to me at NMZ. Tips?

Okay, I agree with you. I still think the HCIM max cape shouldn‚Äôt be red, because it looks the same as the normal max cape and my point still stands.

Update about group ironman
---
Looks like someone got flamed for saying some dumb shit 
---
I understand where hes coming from complaining though, sure he was in salad robes and a water battle staff+book of darkness but the guy was legit just in dhide top and bottom and bulwark and in all honesty even if he was in mystics he probably still would have splashed 3+ times in a row. Its more so frustration thats built up over timewhen youre NOT in welfare and splashing so often that even though youre in shitty gear you still expect to at least have a chance at freezing a guy pretty much 3 iteming.
---
Exactly, the direction of the game is out of my hands - I'm just along for the ride
---
Just sounds like two smack downs for the price of one to me, is Jagex having a sale? 
---
It's bad but it's magical and it is said that it heals wounds
---
I'll ignore the unwarranted 'moron' comment and pretend that you are willing to understand.
---
Nothing should be viable **everywhere**. Everrything should be viable **somewhere**.
---
That's the premise behind this thought of rebalance. Of course that's an ideal situation, mostly unreachable, but the violation rate should be 0 and below 5%. Currently it's ~5% and ~60% respectively.
---
I did some formulas in the past, taking rune-dragon items vs green dragons, gargs and bare 0 def health bars, with full formulas as examples, and it's entirely possible to nail values where items have atleast a few uses in a game. Of course the whole thing is infinitely more complex, that's why this is not a 2-3 month draft we can just pull up like they did EOC. I'd reckon for Jagex this to be a major project of a year, ideally split up to 3 years to still sprinkle plenty of content between.
---
The hit chance formula is actually quite good at eliminating inbalances from marginal errors, but outliers avoid it more and more.
---
During the summer I'll probably sit down and create tools to make nailing the values easier and try to wrap it up by september (ealry-midgame only), but as the other guy "nicely pointed out", I'm occupied with university so can't focus on this as much as I'd like to.
---
High volume items are good when you're just starting out. Logs, runes, arrows, food, ores, bars, etc.
---
If it was something like this that directed you to a website I think a lot more people would vote, due to \*no xp loss\*
---
Well, that's why I don't check youtube guides for Xp rates most of the time, but I was under the assumption that the wiki was more realistic with its projected rates.

People voting requires confidence in the electing system.  Right now?  That's not there.  The community as a whole isn't really convinced that things are being done in good faith, and that shows.  We're getting maybe 70-80k turning out.  Are we even getting 10% turnout at most?
---
Do any of the mods have a ballpark for how many accounts are eligible to vote in polls and active?  Is my guess even within an order of magnitude of the actual turnout?

Yeah I have internet, every other site I've tried works fine. The only problem comes when trying to open RuneScape client and going to the website

I believe having less than 0 magic attack bonus reduces accuracy quite a bit but having more than 0 doesn't really do much. Basically just try to get around 0 magic attack and you should be fine.

You're a special kind of dumbass. 
---
But it also ruins voting for many who vote later than others, they believe their vote will not matter because their choice is already losing by so much. 
---
I think a better fix for this would be to make it so that member items don't count toward the 80 f2p slots. So when you go from mem to f2p you have 80 slots for f2p items.
---
Goal is getting gear from PKing not levels, the leveling is purely funded from his main since the start. Its pure set from scratch, not making a pure from scratch.
---
just do all of them. worth it and the green chunk looks nice

Whip is better yeah, but with the downside that it can't train strength efficiently.
---
Yep, OP's story seemed off from the beginning. Especially with the admissions of account sharing (that he's *still* making). Plus the need to make a passive aggressive post asking for apologies.
---
huh? You stack hits with range on the same tick, the speed of the 2h doesn't make a difference. You don't keep holding onto the 2h for multiple hits
---
He‚Äôs got shtoyle 
---
Grats mate! 
---
Got my cape yesterday as well, but with the usual method.
---
I‚Äôve hated EVScape ever since he was a dick to Wild Mudkip during the last runefest.
---
Congrats man! I‚Äôve been thinking about creating an ironman for a while, but I have so much time invested into my main for a quest cape that I can‚Äôt haha!
---
I dont have enough money i feel. An hours worth is 3m to buy mats :(
---
Racing at agility courses.. pathetic lol 
---
If you have the bonecrusher necklace you can get a normal bonecrusher in addition from the disciples at the ectofunctus. The necklace still crushes bones while in the inventory but does not give the effect of the necklace unless worn.
---
just let them clean the noobs and then perma ban them and boom money sink.
---
Untrimmed capes are the ugliest... and people thinking rarity matters on an online game are twelve year olds who jerk each other off to the fact something is rare 
---
It's misleading though? Whether you TP or don't TP you get almost the same number of marks. The only change is XP amount
---
Dragon weapons are still somewhat relevant after the big melee upgrades are unlocked (piety, barrows gloves, berserker). Especially if the point is to make the stab and crush weapons useful.
---
Can we please delete runecraft from the game?
---
Hatrick in hats
---
if u watch Jimmy's content ofcourse you're gonna get more of his content in suggestions
---
The solution to this is more PMODs. I‚Äôm 3/4 qualified to be a complete asshole so don‚Äôt take this as me wanting a silver crown. But seriously when is the last time you saw a pmod that wasn‚Äôt a streamer?
---
why dint you figt it :( 
---
My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. ü§¨ What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.ü§≠
---
Is it really flaming if he's the idiot in the scenario
---
just figured out you could even see that, and it seems that many attempts to log into my email have happened and I can only see for the last month or so, and not once did outlook notify me of this activity 
---
&gt; I have re-secured it for the creator to recover and have sent an inbox message advising that further abuse of our recovery system will result in the account being permanently banned. If the creator of the account wishes to continue sharing it with you then that should be done with this risk in mind.
---
How can people possibly think this is the wrong move in any regard? Account was created by a specific email, the recovery info to unlock the account has been sent to that email and now the owner of that email can go ahead and do what they want with it. So the real question stands, whatchu doin now /u/brodaki? Did you (or your brother lul) get the email and have a screenshot of it so that everyone can see that you are in fact the original creator of the account and didn't deserve the outlash from the community?
---
DEATH MECHANICS?
---
The ''temporary'' death mechanics we have now have been in place longer than the original mechanics, when will we see this addressed seriously?
---
Would dilute the votes of people who actually care and try to inform themselves
---
Idk why this made me laugh so much more than i needed to
---
Correct. I have 15-20 spirit trees decorating the outside of my house.
---
Cool. This isn‚Äôt relevant to the comment thread though so...?
---
Oh yeah, RSCV is so authentic with its global chat. Global chat was definitely in RSC, right? Give me a break, lmao.
---
Not to mention the owner is a well-known liar: [https://i.imgur.com/CTpugoa.png](https://i.imgur.com/CTpugoa.png)
---
Does that picture make you think? It certainly makes me think.
---
No pin or auth on any account, its your own fault then.
---
Of all the European things to complain about in osrs you choose how they spell defense and not how their 1st floor isn‚Äôt the second floor ok 
---
Well the difference is that Hespori is actual content, a pet from voting in polls is more akin to having a pet gotten from a daily lottery
---
i love kempq
---
i thought this was normal tbh
---
It's great on ironmen before you can make your own super str pots, but at that point you're not really even using it as a weapon. 
---
bloody nmz prods
---
I think if scims are still best overall it will maintain the fundamental aspect of the game. There's no reason maces should have worse stats than a scim AND a slower attack speed..
---
Please upload a video of you hitting someone (gently) and tell them to sit :)
---
If everyone gave a shit nobody should be taken advantage of. But that‚Äôs in a perfect world. I do agree with you that selflessness leads to being taken advantage of but if you have the sense to know you should be nice you should have the sense to know it. 
---
Third place seems perfect then.
---
Hi guys welcome to my Max Cash from Scratch and today we're starting off with 250M to get things rolling. 
---
Well I play F2P since a while and it amazes me the amount of noobs I come by.
---
Combat 41 killing scorpions with Training Sword and Training Shield.
---
People ranging with longbows and full rune.
---
These people really enjoy the game and don't care about efficiency. That's how I played as a kid and it reminds me this game is there to enjoy.
---
Crab rave.... if you haven't been living under a rock for the last 6 months, you've seen the video at this point
---
https://youtu.be/LDU_Txk06tM

Sounds like your info has been leaked at some point. Check haveibeenpwned.com
---
Cringe 
---
Lol how is that going to help?
---
As well as seaweed spores I believe! 
---
Okay I will! 
---
Not to be a doozy, but 200 projects like this have been started and not finished since Minecraft was made.
---
Just keep killing monsters while enabling the loot tracker in RuneLite :)
---
Scotty kilmer lmao.. Never thought id see him in a osrs sub. Nice.
---
How about you just play what you like and shut it instead? No one cares.
---
Season 6 soon boys
---
So you're telling me, if he gave the account all the gear, and finished getting the 10 extra strength levels, and then made the first video you'd be like "Oh yeah, fair game"? It's from scratch, all the money the account has made was made in the way he said it would be. 
---
You complaining about this sound as ridiculous to me as someone complaining that settled left Morytania because his series is "morytania locked UIM" even though he explains at the start that there will be two exceptions. 
---
Perfect! That is easy enough! My next question was how you had a sample of over 1m abby demon kills so that answers that
---
You shouldn't need much gold at this point in the game. If you need some easy gold you can spin flax. You may also level your farming and do herb runs for cash. 
---
Otherwise just leveling up your combat and taking what decent items you get to the GE is your best bet. Like many people I fought chaos druids around your level, just watch out for PKers. Definitely need to get that str level up. Also range is good for safe spotting a lot of higher level enemies. You can make good money on blue dragons at a low level combat with decent range.
---
If it "evened out" it would screw up the ratio. If you have 7 votes for yes and 3 no then and then you and vote to each, you've gone from 70% yes to 66%.
---
No separation required. He's never given the account money, just gear to train with. 
---
Ain't no one got time for Kandarin hard diaries. I need my 8 more levels for Morytania hard diaries..
---
I would look up an efficient quest guide. It'll give all quests in the best possible order. Doing it that way will get your stats up pretty good
---
The people that immediately walk up and talk about how they won so much money immediately strike me as the bots handler. Because after this they always stick around UNTIL I leave. And they‚Äôre there with the bot til you come back. Pay a little attention and I think it‚Äôs quite easy to see who has a stake in that particular dicing bot. This is a team of people with bots and handlers in almost every world. 
---
Loser nerds lol haha

Wow an hour mute will do so much.
---
Yes. 100%. But if he started with a high level, it'd at least be obvious that he wasn't doing it from scratch at a glance. 
---
I grinded zulrah for loot and the pet/mutagen got rewarded nicely in the meantime.
---
Yeah, I've noticed it does it on my desktop, but not on my laptop. Both using runelite. Not really sure what would be causing it 
---
So that's the reason I'm not seeing all the messages in my chat log, thought it was just a runelite issue. 
---
Good to know though.
---
ok so when you say you're making a pie from scratch it's deceiving to then go buy a pie crust to "save yourself from having to waste time" right? 
---
i think that's the issue here
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quests/List
---
You can sort by difficulty, length, quest points reward, etc.
---
not a fox news fan, but you are describing every major news network and how they operate not just the ones with the political backing you don't agree with.
---
I completely understand the devaluing standpoint. And I did considered it before making my post. But the idea is that it shouldn‚Äôt matter which skill you decide to level first. 90% of skills have literally no effect on difficulty. The only capes that actually poses a challenge as you both mentioned is hp and slayer. Unless of course we are considering ironmen/pures. But in that case, they‚Äôve chosen their on destiny. 
---
If we're changing stats of F2P gear though then why stop at just Rune weapons? Why not totally rework the magic armor situation in F2P, which basically doesn't exist right now? They've expressed a desire to rework Black D'hide in P2P, why not start from the ground up with Green D'hide and totally reshape how all ranged armor works in OSRS? 
---
Cheese grater 
---
And Man, I just want people to stand up for SOMETHING right, and not immediately shoot shit down because it would be difficult to remedy. That‚Äôs called laziness. 
---
Or you can look at the data and filter out obvious outliers. Hell, you can have a question like "what is 1+1" to filter out people not checking answers. That's how actual surveying groups handle non-serious replies.
---
I agree that they need to be careful how they approach this. It also should NOT be enforced in the context of Clan Chats. Clan Chat's should always play by their own rules since it's private. Same goes for PMs. If you don't want someone using certain words in your cc, just ban them from the cc. Same principle applies to PMs and the ignore list.   
---
Half of what makes the game special is the chatroom aspect of it. I can guarantee that if they neuter in game chat too much, that will trigger the decline of the game.
---

I lurk this sub daily and I haven't seen this suggestion laid out quite like this. I've heard the mace buff suggestion a few times though.
---
Plus I don't get this obsession with keeping f2p the same, this won't affect the pvp meta or whatever else the purists complain about, it will only add depth to a pretty bland combat system. 
---
making a pie takes slightly less time i think.
---
As the fault is being caused by your GPU driver, roll it back.
---
Device manager &gt; select gpu &gt; properties &gt; driver &gt; rollback.

Might not be as simple as that depending on the gpu software. 
---
They used to have 24 hour muting capabilities if I‚Äôm not mistaken. 
---
Stay Strong Brother
---
Except autoweed and the seed box
---
It makes it pointless imo. It's fine if he wants to do it that way but it isn't from scratch if you are using gear you didn't get on that account. 
---
Took me 40 minutes, but I had put it off until 97 farming.
---
Don't be like me. 
---
What if it rolled for it when you interact with a poll booth for the first time each day, that way you don't even have to vote but it gives people more reasons to even go to the polls and more likely to vote.
---
We care dude! gzz on the bucket. I got one too at the same kc I think haha
---
Fair enough haha
---
‚ÄúPvP set from scratch‚Äù
---
Even cooler
---
THe shiftiest dog gets a bone every now and again huh?
---
Simple answer is don‚Äôt share info pertaining to your recover questions online, use a different password for runescape than your email or anything associated with it. Most ‚Äúhacks‚Äù are bc an email account got compromised in some sort of link and the Rs account shares a password, or because someone got recovery answers through social engineering.
---
Good practice is to treat recovery questions like passwords instead of actual answers 
---
Thanks man! I'm super pumped. I find it hilarious that this post is so downvoted though!! Haha, did those guys have a long barrows grind, or what? 
---
The SHITTIEST dog even gets a bone every now and again huh?
---
Congrats man
---
well....i say grinded. but its long to kill him and its very long to get the opportunity to kill him. so i did 15 totems. that was over several months. i have more totems now.
---
Nah m8 this guy overplays the Aussie stereotype. Any Aussies can tell how much effort he puts into trying to be as stereotypically Aussie as possible.
---
Early-game was fun. Yeah, at 1650+, it's getting really tedious to start getting these hard diaries done and grinding towards 87. I can't wait until I hit 1850-1900 and start enjoying the rewards one reaps from the time spent in the mid-game.
---
you dont smoke coke noob you snort it
---
He posted in this thread. OP is still lying
---
I agree. Whos wants their theiving level at 4
---
Fooled how? I still believe that he was the original creator of the account, the main user of the account and the rightful owner of the account.
---
Sure, there is some dodgy stuff going on with the account which I acknowledged, saying that Jagex took an understandable course of action with the information they had (spoofed IPs, weird geo-data). But the only question I'm interested in is who owns the account, and I still believe that it's this guy. 
---
Ya and what you originally said was as well an obvious fact since Trump is on record saying he got "a small loan of a million dollars".
---
Spam filter doesn‚Äôt work. Can already turn chat off and ignore list them. 
---
Oof these comments are rough. I think you guys take what people say a little too seriously. EV is a sarcastic dude.
---
What? From nothing and from scratch are kinda similar..
---
Make skip be the first option instead of last
---
difference is no-one at jagex is as much of a powertripping sociopath as riot lyte is/was/always will be
---
I took to Twitter and found a few people have tweeted about this. Someone also mentioned being unable to use Microsoft office products (which I was having trouble with yesterday, don‚Äôt know if I am now since I‚Äôm no longer at home). I think AT&amp;T might be having upstream problems. Are you on AT&amp;T?
---
That's true. But I'll need 74 anyway for adamant darts and 83 for Lumbridge elite diary. Might as well just chip away at as much of it as possible. 
---
Got mine on the day of the update at 3-4 kc, didn't know what it was until someone asked me about it :o
---
Sounds like the second world event in RS3 with the Bandos vs Armadyl but on a bigger scale. It was one of the events I had most thoroughly enjoyed then and would be amazing to see some form of comeback in this way
---
about 10k less xp/hr and less marks of grace as hard diaries give 15% more, so its not worth doing without hard diary unless u really want full graceful early
---
I agree actually, that's why I said mediocre. His videos are more entertaining than Chris' though imo, even with all the cringe.
---
I see both sides of the argument; personally I vote nostalgia but I also see the other side's reasoning for continuous updates and improvements. 
---
The way I see it at the end of the day - the majority will win. The reason is the same as always: Jagex is a company and they will do whatever nets them the most profit. In this case, more people want upgrades, etc.
---
Disclaimer: I only want everything kept the same because it's what I played growing up and I came back to it thinking it would be the same game. Either way, I'm happy that there is OSRS at all, considering the RS3 is just...I can't even put it into words.
---
Do you think Pawz had a harder journey than Disziple?
---
I'm saying Jagex should improve the spam filter so you wouldn't have to ignore them in the first place.
---
I got two words for ya: A Friend 
---
Probably shouldn't call it from scratch then 
---
I don't think you know what a strawman is. This is a very valid concern
---
You got me all kinds of fucked up
---
I would say you can't really ever "buy" an account, it's more like you're renting it for an indefinite amount of time
---
at current speeds/max hits that is 100% impossible to do in f2p pking. AFAIK
---
Right and wrong are relative. Morals are not universal. You may think this is right but it's probably wrong to other people. I honestly don't care about gambling bots and think the effort is better put elsewhere; does that make me wrong? To you, maybe. To me, not so much.
---
You can't choose everything (or anything really) in life so you fight for what you believe in, which is what everyone does as that's what our bodies are programmed to do. In the end it won't matter though, cause you probably won't make a change or if you do you won't be there to experience it.
---
Life's a bitch and then you die so just do what makes you happy and don't worry about shit like gambling bots.
---
Runelite is getting a chat filter on Thursday btw so you can ignore shit more easily. 
---
He posted it on twitter, just like he does all his "sick burns", to try and brag about how good he is at insulting people, and he's adamantly defending it on there. Not everything is a joke just because it comes from an Aussie.
---
What's the point in not voting if you're looking at the results you are literally already there it's what like 4 mouse clicks more to vote?
---
if you can make a second video showing your DKS kc, we will be happy to believe you. 
---
That‚Äôs the issue, people commenting on it haven‚Äôt watched the series lol. He didn‚Äôt even show a lot of training was just explaining during the mcfs 2v2 he was afking his pure up to the max strength lvl it could have before gaining a combat. Simply telling us how underpowered his pure is at the moment
---
Ah, my bad. My cape just teles me to the blue drags
---
#mythgang
---
And his status was removed because he wasn‚Äôt contributing to the community. In fact, he was actively contributing against it. 
---
I‚Äôd love it but I feel the easiest solution is more pmods with one day mute powers. 
---
Not good enough, I think you should have a chance of a pet every time you log in. /s
---
I need this one as well! Send me a PM if you still need help and I‚Äôll come find you!
---
go tot the ZMI world, there are people spamming it. 
---
Lol the osrs clan is ganging up on me.
---
The quote "get a life"  obviously is a trigger word to get you all sensitive.
---
Yeah like how does he call it from scratch if he trains with great from his main lmao
---
I cannot get the helm! I have all the items, I'm not wearing anything else, I even have a skull like he does, and I do the emotes in that order, but no helm! Please someone help!
---
Why
---
Separate but related problem that there needs to be more affordable/efficient stab and crush weapons on the same tier as whip if attack type is made to matter more IMO.
---
It is kind of overpriced but it also isn't. There is no upfront cost and compared to other mmo subs it's on par but mmo subs are also a sort of outdated model. It's just kind of lame that the logic is that you are paying for two games when most people only play one or the other.  
---
So let‚Äôs recap then: you commented an obvious fact, I replied with one, and then you replied with another. 
---
Glad we got that down. 
---
It‚Äôs in your runescape settings when on mobile, there‚Äôs an FPS slider
---
it just came back up for me so they might have solved the problem.
---
no wonder lol, i've gained over 30mill xp on fleshies over the years and never a superior...I was like what
---
Imagine thinking that EV is actually mad there
---
Couldn‚Äôt you, if you were a god of consistency and clicks, stack an arrow and R2h every hit? For example stand with two tiles in between each other; fire arrow, switch to R2h smack a stack, run back, switch to bow, and repeat?
---
There is a title in RS3 ‚ÄúThe Robotically Efficient‚Äù for legitimate players who were falsely banned for botting because they were too good
---
we need you to extoll the virtues of sorcerer
---
&gt; It's clear that the majority of people here have no idea about the goal of the series.
---
Everyone knows what his goals are, his goals are not "from scratch", because his rules don't meet the definition of it. He's welcome to have his own rules, but advertising it as "from scratch" is a flat out lie.
---
&gt;Also, EVScape is known for roasting people in the comments of his videos
---
Exactly. He posted this on Twitter himself which is why he got the attention. He wanted it. If he is allowed to roast his viewers for messing up, they can roast him when he does so too.
---
&gt;people blindly follow without looking into it at all.
---
No ones being blind here except you, here's the definition of "from scratch":
---
&gt;from the very beginning, especially without making use of or relying on any previous work for assistance.
---
Does literally any of that apply to his series? No. Just because he's abiding by his own rules doesn't mean he's doing it from scratch.
---
yes i am angry. We all should be
---
I‚Äôm 17m farming xp, I‚Äôm already like you üôÉüôÉüôÉ
---
You need to clap not cry then, hope that helps
---
Yes shooting twice and then gmaul speccing requires an insane ammount of skill. 
---
Yeah, thats exactly what im doing, thats also jagex' take on it
---
This makes make me feel like if older melee weapons get a rework, why not other non melee weapons? I see no reason to use anything other than a staff for magic, crossbows and blowpipe is also the only viable weapons to use near the end game. 
---
Very good comment. I agree with you. If only I didn‚Äôt spend so much time trying to enjoy my GE standing I probably wouldn‚Äôt care either. 
---
Somehow it's going completely unmentioned that you obviously get mage xp too from teles. Let's not forget that people spam cammy teles to train mage especially at lower levels. 
---
Now I want a cooking pet that is a crab an shows up more frequently when brewing alcohol.
---
Easily solved by defaulting to skip. If people want to skip through every poll that's fine, but just getting them to go to the booth and have to click a button makes them much more likely to place a meaningful vote even if many just skip.
---
You've got to be a troll. No one's that ignorantly dumb.
---
And now he's crying because people are calling him out for it. For someone who think's hes such a banterous boy, he's incredibly thin skinned and stubborn. 
---
Banter is generally on a mutual ground. This is just being a dick.
---
I mean it was cool and all when we were all running around whackin shit with r2hs...but it is so much more interesting when all of the weapons have their own dynamics, I mean when I started there weren‚Äôt even banks but you don‚Äôt see me not using the...btw oh wait...fuck
---
Well, claws are lightweight weapons, so making the attack slower would seem kind of off. Maybe lower the strength bonus to claws and keep them at the same speed with double hits? 
---
girlfriends age?
---
I think its odd to flame someone in a thread about complaining someone flaming someone else. 
---
it was just a joke
---
no because after the stack you would still have wait before shooting with the bow, the same speed it would've taken to hit another 2h swing instead.
---
Basically stacking does more burst damage/high KO chance, but less consistent DPS than the bow
---
Thank you! Why was mine different?
---
What about RuneShark's Godsword Set From Scratch then? They popularised the genre, and they did it on their main accounts which they trained between episodes... it's clear you weren't around back then.
---
"From scratch" has never meant from a new level 3 account. Even B0aty recently did an infernal cape from scratch, which he did on an account with 2k+ total.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L15kCsQZNiA
---
in this old video you can see the animation. It was in the game at some point but was removed.
---
I'd say you;re hotter as a dude.
---
Investment banker by any chance
---
I posted this in the weekly Q&amp;A but not sure if it was in time.  
---
But... how closely tied is the lore of OSRS to RS3?
---
Is it the same? Are there any differences or changes?  
---
You have your obvious diversions like chambers of Xeric.  
---
But is it same world just different parts of the story are told?
---
Twitter has one of the worst rapports for banning people based on their ideology and not actual harassment. Not a great example to bring forward, especially given how forthright osrs players are with their views, you'll end up with all left leaning being banned or all right leaning being banned (aka twitter all over again).
---
grats bro I still haven't gotten anything worth 1m yet
---
I think there was
---
Woe is us, brother. But now that I'm over 15m it's been quite nice. 
---
Up front, a lot of people talk about tool belt, coin pouch and resting to restore energy.
---
Have you not been on this sub for the past few months? 
---
It's clear you weren't around when "From Scratch" challenges started on RuneScape. Look up "Godsword Set From Scratch", arguably one of the best RS series of all time.
---
Eh, if he wants cosmetics, it can still cost him upwards of ~50M etc.
---
fastest way at his level is to to give bounty kills for emblem upgrades and such.
---
You could say there's even less reward for grinding for hours and incrementing a number.
---
And more power will allow for other fuck nut mentally unstable p mods to do even more harm. 
---
Ironman who hasnt gotten black mask/slayerhelm
---
Welcome to my 10 hp but not actually 10 hp even though I put 10 hp in my title ironman
---
Hands down best episode.
---
What we really need is a bloodveld mask
---
agreed i dont get why kids need all these new fangled tools, ive been rocking my tutorial island gear from day 1 without ever trading it in and i had no problems getting max melee, cooking, and prayer all from the same chicken coup
---
What sick fucks are downvoting an office joke? 
---
thats not his main goal though, the goal of the account is to make money, the stats are meant to be a maxed pure he just started the series early before it was maxed.
---
Oh I get it.  He clearly mentions that he'd be doing this in episode 1 of the series.  
---
Regardless, "From Scratch" doesn't mean anything when you create your own definition of from scratch.
---
&gt;Also, EVScape is known for roasting people in the comments of his videos.
---
Lol.  Jimmy Carr roasts people.  EVScape calling someone a "fucking twat" showcases how immature he is.
---
Laptop model? Also is the pen stock?
---
yup, that's what I did. I now have different passwords for all 3 accounts, and an email that will never be logged into or used for anything other then runescape recovery information.
---
thanks for your help and time. I appreciate the information
---
TIL there's a database for that. I just assumed it all went away after I reset it, so I'm glad I'm helping out in one way
---
Lmao. Yeah you go ahead and pick a series that supports your view.
---
What about B0atys infernal cape from scratch?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1uE7isEOGY
---
At no point during that series did he move items across just so he could train easier, because that would not have been "from scratch"
---
Welp, this was fun. Thank you for the information and conversation, I have to get back to class(magic training), school has been eating up too much of my playtime.
---
 Can you setup a command by throwing flashbangs and smokes to act as prayers?
---
I'll be your friend! ... for 50m :)
---
I was around since 6months after the release of classic but good try buds.
---
I don't think you know what the word "scratch" means then.
---
What people do and what the definition of the term means are two different things. It's irrelevant that some popular streamers do it on maxed accounts.
---
Will a J-Cup or clan wars tournament similar to the pvp championship be a possibility in the future?
---
tldr OP is fake and gay
---
they removed aggressive random events that would attack you when they made random events optional
---
A percentage chance is meaningless if you don't also consider the time it takes for each roll on the table...
---
Join a CC, turn public chat off and never turn it on again

---
It was in OSRS but passed a poll to be reverted to the OG animation IIRC
---
Yup! That and the ogres that came from fishing and evil tree spirits. I think they got rid of all dangerous randoms. They are still around tho. You can fight the evil chicken in the hero‚Äôs guild. And you can fight tree spirits in Zanaris. 
---
thanks for the response. I've only recently gotten into combat/prayer flicking etc. and just got my fire cape at 70 def, 75 ranged and was wondering just how big of a step inferno is. back to runecrafting it is lol 
---
Hard to swallow pill: not everyone shares your opinion or view point on every subject matter, try ignoring content you don't feel interested in instead of shit posting.
---
Heard sparc mac is also doing a 150B giveaway soon. Might wanna check that out as well
---
Who finna tel him

I didn't even know that this was an option, thanks!

That's a whole 45 minutes of Tithe farm

Any tips for a noob whose goal is to do barrows? I‚Äôm currently grinding 50 base combat stats and 43 prayer to start, then going members (going for 60 combat after) . Should I do the Morytania diaries first for double drop? Any other things I absolutely must do first(besides the actual requirements) 
---
Honestly, good idea
---
Nice! I‚Äôm rockin an Amazon hd fire 8 and it is beautiful on there as well
---
I'm tired of it. Deca sucks and the game isn't good enough to make me play despite Deca sucking. It's stale. 
---
If you think things are unbalanced play as an Ironman. It makes you
---
Realize how much everything actually is balanced and makes sense for itself
---
void is only useless in rs3 because it cant hold invention perks tho. it was used a lot before invention
---

---
This was honestly the big flaw I saw with this after thinking about it more in-depth after posting. Didn't even think this silly little joke-suggestion would get this much attention lol.
---
But yeah, there'd need to be some other way to get the pet that doesn't involve voting directly. Counting your votes is fine, but voting itself to obtain the pet is a no-no.
---
Those are the same thing. From scratch is saying you are starting from nothing. EVscape is not doing that. 
---
Thankyou, in my excitement I crushed the post haha  
---
&gt;I honestly think each weapon should be buffed more. In the sense that they will be VERY useful versus the enemy if that enemy is weak to a certain type.
---
Yeah, what OP is suggesting is nice, but it's by no means enough.
---
you just proved his point
---
just kill them at ogre enclave its not that much further and nobody is ever there
---
Wow, deep connections being made here. Turns out fire in real life is similar to fire in games.
---
I support basically any silly headgear
---
It's always subjective, but a few things I've seen the last few weeks such as support for Summoning, Runespan style runecrafting methods, reworking of mining/smithing, and even someone saying prayer flicking shouldn't be a game mechanic.
---
Now granted, not all these are widely supported and wouldn't pass a poll. However it's more the looming thought that if more and more people who have these ideas enter, with enough time they may get their way in some aspects.
---
My biggest issue currently is people thinking polling should stop being so restrictive and to instead let Jagex have control to add or change what they like and instead polls are a "suggestion".
---
My hypothesis for this recent behavior is prior to mobile and RS3 breakdown, people would trickle to OSRS and have their ideas checked by the community. If someone had to wild or outlandish idea, people would inform them why it's not good for the game, and they would learn to meld with the community, generally.
---
Well now with this large, almost doubling our size, influx of players we see these ideas not being checked by experienced or long lasting members of the community simply due to volume. Now instead these newer people aren't learnig and are instead reinforcing each other's bad ideas or habits.
---
Like I said, currently the voice is small enough that it hasn't changed anything yet, but it's the problem that it's getting bigger and becoming more apparent. 
---
So far I think OSRS has gone in a fantastic direction and I hope it continues that path. But my original comment was me just warning that we shouldn't make the same mistakes that were made the first time around.
---
How do you even get it at all? Is it on runelite? And how do I find it if it is? 
---
That's not how youtube suggestions work. You watch J1mmy and get recommended fortnite videos in russian and trannys doing makeup tutorials.
---
That only works if something is attacking you. If not then you get logged out at the normal afk logout Timer( 2 minutes). If you‚Äôre splashing attacking something then after 20 minutes you‚Äôll stop casting until you click something. And no matter what there is no way to prevent the 6 hour log out timer.
---
except in actual 2007 people used all of these weapons because they didnt know what the fuck was going on. I would argue it would make it closer to the way 2007 felt for me at least.
---
Brown apron changes the source code for your character. Each tick actually becomes 6 milliseconds rather than 600. Cooking is a four tick action normally, so the 2400 millisecond cooking action becomes a 2376 millisecond or 396 tick when you're on Brown Apron Time. It's a whole big thing. /r/osrsconspiritards has been all over it for years.
---
oh ok. whats your osrs name? can i add you
---
That‚Äôs what you get for not having pin or authenticator 
---
IMO I would prefer the table options to be in a global menu at the top rather than squeezed into every single table
---
Dont drive sports cars and bmw, they are unreliable money pits. Take my advice and drive a 1993 Toyota Corolla!
---
I thought I was looking at a fridge for like 30 seconds wtf.
---
I really don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a straw man. It‚Äôs a legitimate concern. People definitely can be voting randomly if they don‚Äôt want to take time to think about what their vote means. I also disagree with your last point. I think it‚Äôs important for people to voice their concerns and discuss this from every angle so our end solution is the best it can be.

---
How is the game now if you would start right now? Feels kinda meh when everyone is pretty much maxed at this point doing raids while I would have at least 2 years to get there. Would it be wiser to consider doing an ironman as its newer? 
---
Black d'hide is level 40 armor, as it only requires 40 defense for the body. The 70 ranged requirement should really only affect its offensive bonuses because ranged is an offensive stat. It's pretty ridiculous how well it stacks up against karils which costs way more, requires 70 def, and degrades.
---
Cars on fire is a daily occurence here. One time over 100 cars were set on fire  during one night. Thats why FM has the most ammount of players with 99 :)
---
Stopping the grind after 13m exp 2019 lmao
---
I didnt get full graceful until about level 70 agility
---
a lot of efficient players leave canifis at 47 to do wildy course for almost double the xp/hr, and then at 55 go to werewolf agility course
---
since I wanted 70 agility for sara gwd over full graceful which i still rarely use, i did the faster route. after 70 i did get the kandarin hard diary done which allowed me to get full graceful fairly quick. 
---
not saying canifis for full graceful isnt bad cuz maybe an activity u want to do requires it, but u cant say everyone does it 
---
Bahahaah... I guess you don't understand he is still restricted to f2p areas which is the entire point. He can't quest for combat items. He still smiths rune plates. Educate yourself.
---
Is that you C Engineer?
---
You forgot about rapier lol and that kinda shit
---
This
---
Oh right. Duh
---
Facts
---
Lol, yes. We do.
---
I‚Äôm on an iPhone 6S and it took me from maybe 40 minutes of battery life to a couple of hours. My iPad goes hours and from a full charge might dip to 70%.
---
And I'm saying he didn't go on members worlds because it would be illogical for him to do so and there is clear evidence to the contrary. 
---
Ever hear "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"? It means that if you are going to suggest something fucking stupid, the only reason anyone should believe you is if there's really good evidence to support what you said. 
---
So, if the claim is "he could've gone to members worlds and bought items at the GE to train some skills faster" then it would naturally follow, logically, if he doesn't have much experience that is, or even could be, bought, this is almost certainly not the case. And you might think "250m is a lot of experience!" But compared to his total one bil, it really isn't. If the account creator is just trying to get internet points, he could easily have 1.5b exp by also training prayer, crafting, and maxing out his magic and cooking exp (or firemaking, I forget which one was 200m already) and have a more impressive account, still using these same methods that don't interfere with his music list.
---
So, if there is clear evidence that these methods were not abused, and also clear evidence the guy did most of his training on f2p - as ironyee said, only those three skills, totaling 250m, are "buyable" (by his wrong definition I might add) that means 75% of his exp (at the least) is done legitimate. As a person who got 100m experience, as a member, using advanced gear, using NMZ, and doing decent money makers to abuse high exp/h methods for all my skills, I could not FUCKING imagine doing that seven and a half times, with methods that are maybe a fifth as effective, I would fucking end my life. So if I was driven by this idea "man I really want to do this all f2p and legit" I wouldn't give up three quarters of the way there. 
---
I cannot PROVE he did not use members methods and everything they're saying to abuse higher exp rates while not being revealed by music. But, given all these reasons to not believe it, I would have to give zero shits about logic to believe that he has.
---
Real af, 43 prayer can be done for 100k using the wildy altar, even cheaper if using big bones instead of dragon
---
Man id like aggressive random events back
---
If you cant handle being called a fucking twat when you say something stupid then I guess...dont make a stupid comment? I dont think hes an asshole at all, then again im not a hypersensitive crybaby. Its freakin aussie banter bro, "fucking twat" is no more rude or offensive than just calling someone an idiot in the US.
---
I have never encountered a PMOD. 
---
Did you get peekay‚Äôd?
---
If EoC was polled pre EOC then it would never have passed. Players had the ability to test EoC and no one really liked it, I just don't think that RS still would have been as successful as it is now (OSRS) even if EoC wasn't implemented. The game would have peaked and other updates would probably have killed it. I think the reason why OSRS is so successful atm is because it all started from a clean beginning. I definitely see OSRS peaking soon too since there's nothing to keep up the hype and players entertained. We will see many similar bosses because OSRS doesn't have the "engine" to make them unique. And skill wise they will never top something like summoning and dung on OSRS so we will be stuck with boring skills, which once again isn't going to bring any new players. 
---
yeah I just got hard diaries done, so not sure of the timeframe but I feel like it would be 2-3 laps a minute. so like 5 hours maybe
---
Cool. So what should the price be lowered to? Oh wait, if you lower the price it further encourages players to just buy this item off GE and its demand will soon cause the price to rise and stabilize again. The GE market, over time, has identified this item to be worth 1m for its rarity and purpose, plain and simple
---
Start with 99 fm then aim for quest cape/diary‚Äôs I think would be decent 
---
F2P UIM as well huh?
---
it's not even charged lmfao
---
Maybe he was playing mobile while walking down the street
---
Pretty close then. You got nothing to say other than that?
---
I like how there‚Äôs a gamble-bot, ties everything together. 
---
You got a rune longsword? Lucky man I‚Äôve been grinding kbd for hours but only got the pet and dragon pickaxes. Maybe one day I‚Äôll get the rune longsword
---
I¬¥ll buy one and check if i can get better xp rates. Posting here when i got some evidence.
---
the current pmods in the game dont do shit, they need to remove their statues and be given to people who actually want to help the game instead of just have a crown next to their name to help their ego.
---
I agree with your comments overall, but just want to point something out regarding "splash or hit low"
---
Low hits have nothing to do with magic attack or opponents magic defence. Damage amount is purely RNG, 0-max hit. Attack bonuses only affects accuracy (spash / hit)
---
The guy thrives on this kinda stuff. Just look at his Twitter. 
---
Doesn't player model take priority over NPCs? I have never seen players hide under there so I don't know. 
---
sigh. TBow is only really good at a few places. Remember how it works... 
---
He makes a vid every day for a year straight, needs to do what has to be done.
---
Clearly this is not the clan for you
---
Let me explain. He has a pure that is around level 72, so not very good pure stats. He started with that account and wanted to get maxed pure gear from scratch on an already trained pure, so he‚Äôs not training the pure from scratch. He wanted to train the account up because it wouldn‚Äôt matter because he started with an already trained pure. So it wouldn‚Äôt really matter if he trained the account and transferred the items off.
---
yeah actually, i absolutely do not agree with being able to see others votes because its a pretty well established fact that people are influenced by the most popular opinion, i dont see how this is hard to understand. 
---
Nerf blowpipe
---
No.. The point is to never enter members worlds. He can still use faster bankstanding methods in members.. eDuCAtE yOuRsELf
---
Unless they changed it recently RoW keeps coins from appearing in the loot tracker
---
rewards for voting is a bad idea, i agree. people who dont vote already would just rush their votes in and skew the results. 
---
IMO they should instead have a popup (where the pms appear, exactly like the update post popup) when a poll is running. I know the chatbox already has a notification, but it is fairly easy to overlook it. 
---
Early cuz ur giving up the best xp/hr for marks of grace
---
So what‚Äôs more effective, personally convincing thousands of people to vote anyways or simply hiding poll results so they will do it on their own?
---
Is there any monster like the lesser demon at the top of the wizards tower Just a higher lvl?Something I can grind mage (I‚Äôm low combat lvl) and not worry about dying
---
Time to run a counter-army of bots that latch onto each gambling bot and spam toy horseys. 
---
This is about 10 minutes of work? lol
---
Youre still missing the point dude jesus christ youre writing a lot for someone who doesnt even know what hes arguing against.
---
Nobody asked YOU to prove anything. The problem isnt that you havent proven it, its that you claimed "there was no benefit to using member methods" and people were just saying "yes there are"
---
Where u get this model lol
---
&gt; nobody cares
---
Way to be negative before people even react bro
---
Sigh.
---
Most busted item in the game and removing +4 prayer will barely affect the price.
---
EVscape taking it on the chin 
---
better be a wolf that follows you around with stink lines comin off it
---
Nah caps just has that effect it just blows my mind someone can make a point, fail to defend it, and then just attack me instead. Go ahead bud, if you‚Äôre capable of rational thought defend your stance and explain how taking gold you didn‚Äôt earn is not theft. Ironic your name is intelligent. Think you‚Äôre capable of that buddy? 
---
yeah i agree on the most part but again, I just think his title is very misleading then because you wouldn't have to explain that if your title was more clear to begin with
---
you're right, most people probably didn't take the time to investigate but it might as well be EZscape for him at this point, having the ability to transfer wealth. It's so much less relateable to the general public now
---
Oh no you dont see what the results are as they come in. You can just basically see what a person voted for, and then you can null his vote or have somebody lynch him outside if he votes the wrong way. :)
---
i just got my ddef w few days ago and it makes a *huge* difference!
---
I think dragon/crystal halberd would be better
---
How? Using more scales? Dmg?
---
Ironman luck
---
All his statements go along with what Jagex said. Just because Jagex believes his account is in the wrong hands or whatever doesn't make it true.
---
They were wrong in the last thread...
---
Nothing bad about it having +4 prayer bonus stop complaining
---
riiighhhttttt
---
Same, I've been waiting for Keris Hasta forever
---
Yeah, my old TS was full with guys who did this for irl, not going to name drop cause cba.
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä Jagex wont respond to this ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
By that logic all dragonhide should have the same defensive stats and all melee barrows armour should too. 
---
Someone lost their shovel
---
Yeah, imo Dream Mentor is worth it because they're a ton of points without having the annoying mechanics. Desert Treasure and RFD give really good points, but they're also annoying af to deal with, so they're not worth it imo. If you're okay with NMZ being less brain dead simple, then they're probably good to include, though. 
---
Also i wonder if some people don't feel like voting in polls when most of them are just pointless questions like "should we slightly change the color of x item" or "should we add a right click travel option to an NPC".
---
I know that this is what most of the community wants. But i feel like it does make the polls less attractive when most of the questions are no brainers. 
---
&gt; Dude every single time I pk I get piled by a huge team on solo, the only chance at survival is some splashes imagine getting Tele blocked and having these retards hit every single freeze on you when your praying magic and wearing dhide...
---
So....THATS why you think mage is totally fine? Yeah, totally sound logic there my guy, so much wrong with that logic its crazy. Not only do you have your own personal bias clearly displayed but youre insinuating that if mage is fixed that EVERY freeze is going to be landed. What so it would go from one end of the spectrum where things splash far too much to all the sudden EVERY freeze hitting? Are you even being serious right now? Not to mention...if you have 5+ dudes maging you...yeah dude youre probably gonna get frozen and you will RIGHTFULLY be at a disadvantage and have a much lower chance at surviving, thats just how things work in ANY game..you will probably die if its 1v5 so what exactly are you complaining about?
---
&gt; the only people who complain about this are pking in huge groups in non multi I hope they bring the 15 second pj timer to every world
---
...what in the ever living fuck are you even saying right now? The only people who complain about mage defense being fucked in PvP and mage being week are people who pk in singles teams? Not only is that COMPLETELY false but makes absolutely no sense since if anything those teams land freezes MORE often than others because they have 3-4 guys freezing in near max or max mage. Your post is clearly just fueled by your own personal bias and zero logic or objectively valid points whatsoever. 
---
There should be a better pj timer though, that was pretty much the only valid thing in your entire post.
---
I'd have an infernal if I had fucking 2b gear lmfao. I did fcape 1st time with a rune cbow
---
Well done man this is a hell of an achievement considering your schedule! 
---
yea its only good in the inferno, raids, theater of blood, sara, arma (still worse than chins though), zulrah, mole, dks (it was incredible on prime AND supreme before they had to tweak supremes stats to balance it), chaos ele, skotizo, cerb and hydra
---
also it was incredible at bandos before they had to change its stats and make mage bandos viable because it was too good
---
''a few places'
---
Raids 1
---
Inferno
---
Hydra
---
Armadyl
---
Saradomin
---
Dks
---
Cerberus
---
Fight Caves
---
Yeah even if the BGS gives a slightly higher defence reduction, it doesn't seem worth the extra effort to me. I'll just stick with arclight until I get a dwh. Thanks!
---
Not really an opinion when its pretty damn clear twitter isn't objective whatsoever.
---
Working out where the path changes and other little details took a lot lot longer than I realised it would to be fair but maybe that‚Äôs just me ahah 
---
Search bond in the GE.
---
Fair enough I suppose.
---
I enjoy it and it pays very well. Plus it is during a crunch time and isn't normally like this.
---
It‚Äôs probably close to 2k noted pure essence per hour! You also get useful herb, seed, and alch drops, and range xp as you‚Äôre safe spotting them
---
This comment hasn't aged well. Accounts been locked again. Jmod smackdown #3 on this boi.
---
Thanks mang!
---
Steezy asf and bootleg boy singlehandedly prevent me from breaking down mentally 
---
Same person creating the bot doesnt mean it's the same one. They may last a couple days but they get banned. Also some of these accounts are hacked from inactive players so just flat out banning the accounts isnt a great approach because it punishes the original owner.
---
Unfortunately that's the systematic problem within the game balance itself, it's solvable but usually needs future proofing.
---
Misleading viewers = good content LUL
---
Nope! Software developer!
---
oof yea idk why it would be doing that lol
---
if your vote goes on how the community is vote, you have bigger issues.
---
This is one of the most common ways for pures to be ruined outside of misclicking. Just go forward remembering this. Also, don't do Tears of Guthix if you do start over, FYI.
---
REWORK NMZ 
---
Thank you! I was a solo player back in the day, but I did start using the grand exchange when that came out
---
cool story
---
moral of the story dont be a dumbass
---
You are acting like a butt, but you are right. The reward is getting what you voted for.
---
gave himself platinum to hahah
---
Sounds like a phishing scam
---
I guess it might end up being profitable. Only takes 2 kills (hide/bones) to recoup costs of the half of ppot you may use if you go in with full bar
---
What mistake? 
---
The one i got is an hp envy laptop 2 in 1 and pen came with it. I found the on screen keyboard but wish there was middle mouse button on the pen
---
Maybe in PvP but it's pretty useless in PvM, unless you meant pre-nerf when you could just AFK cheese bosses with it.
---
:) ahah probably wat im gonna do hajah. MOD ASH save me!!!!!! Hahah 
---
If you want to require a pmod to have a specific task such as patrolling the ge, you need to pay them. Checking for bots isnt their only responsibility as a pmod as well
---
Fixin the clan chat is another big one that effects everyone including pvp. 
---
Just haven‚Äôt gotten 55 for it yet
---
Balista can't recover javelins, Tbow can't recover arrows. The money you can make just from having a tbow, black d'hides and dragon arrows is ridiculous. 
---
Also why would anyone have a problem with dragon arrows being 3K each? 
---
Yes it will, the will give their suggestions and ask peoples opinions how is that not atleast a shitty attempt at fixing it.
---
"There's a sucker born every minute"
---
what?  rapier is no where near as good as chaotic, its so much weaker.  Blowpipe is good but crossbows are only good in niche usage like dragon hunter crossbow, armadyle is pretty is shit tbh.
---
Made a potato move :) cud live w it. Cant go w my rev pk clan anymo tho hahah. We will see.. 
---
Doing wintertodt to get some starting cash and supplies is always good as a starting ironman.
---
Sounds like a twitch chatter
---
EVScape confirmed a dork
---
Oh I guarantee you it's more than just a bone...
---
Come try out one of the RNG representatives. Whats your RSN I will give you a 10% increased odd 
---
"Let's see some ID's boys"
---
That's not the point. If the poll is at 95%, even if I disagree with it, there is no point even voting as my vote will have no impact. Same if it's on 50% and I agree.
---
If results are hidden, then myself and others will not know how close the vote is and then vote how we want as we care more.
---
M9 are you saying you can‚Äôt easily spot these after a quick tele to Ge? 
---
Thank you! There are so many comments in this subreddit that show there are people here who can afford 90 hours a week into the game. I'm glad to see that there are others like me out there who struggle and cherish the small wins!
---
Quest reward? Fuck that, pets should be hard to obtain so everything doesn‚Äôt look like rs3
---
Send me these terms when you see them in game and I can do something about them.
---
Not at all - if you're pushing it you can get about 95 laps/hr in, which amounts to a law rune cost of less than 20k gp/hr. Then consider that the 20% increase in lap speed also translates to 20% more marks of grace - when you factor that in you're actually making 5-10k gp/hr by using the teles.
---
Thank you so much. It's been hard and took over a month but I'm so happy I did it!
---
I like black guys, Jamie. There's no doubt about it. 
---
The man's literally bought 200m mage, cooking and fletching - I don't think the price point bothers him.
---
During absolutely normal gameplay?
---
Jagex doesnt even fix stuff when its their fault
---
s
---
*doing the same thing over and over gets tedious*
---
Don‚Äôt even worry about buying membership lmfao, this game isnt for you
---
Or we could have a side button saying you wish to abstain your vote so people who really did not wish to vote dont effect results and its quicker.
---
Go and look up what definition of "from scratch" means. You can't just change the meaning of a word and then call people dumb for assuming you meant the actual definition. Dude's a mongo.
---
Remove stats from tbow now i've completed inferno with it.
---
I think they should give a form proving you voted to get a $200 tax credit.
---
That would incentivize many people to vote.
---
Or the alternative... a tax penalty if you don't vote, but that would penalize people who, for some legit reason, were unable to vote.
---
dont know if it is but heard rumours about it was just asking if any sources have confirmed
---
$44
---
Buick actually
---
Last night I was getting between 70-75 courses done in an hour with the teleports while not really paying attention, so I would say about 13 hours for 1k laps. You definitely profit while teleporting due to marks of grace.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt take your scam money if it made me Sparc Mac rich. I care about the longevity of this game. Shove it up your crooked asshole. 
---
&gt; envy laptop
---
Do you know the model number?
---
54 RC is hell of achievement. My not BTW account is over 2 years old and I only have 50 RC by grinding it. Gratz man!
---
Ah yes because we all have the option of borrowing the best items from a main account to train and just give back 
---
Always bothered me a scimitar does better against things like skeletons and spiders than a warhammer.
---
IIRC didn't he end up brute forcing it to? He just kept taking inventories of items until it finally worked and then he was able to backwards solve it
---
Someone explain pls. 
---
I was under the impression degrading and recharging is to help with economy
---
I wish I was balling like that. Seriously good on you though. I‚Äôm a skiller mostly so I‚Äôm usually near the poll booths but when I see everything always with a big majority when I go to vote I usually don‚Äôt bother, especially when there are polls so often and I would rather just play, I do usually at least look to keep up with what is going on though
---
I understand your OCD dude, having a pure myself, but Jagex will not fix this error. All weapons have reset their styles, as intended. What wasn't intended was that the wrong XP was given for attack styles. That is not the case here.
---
What I think happened is one of the more common skulltricks. Player 1 attacks player and tries to look vulnerable, you attack him back. He freezes you and walks under you. Now player 2 with a similar name and gear walks from under you. You attack him assuming he's player 1. Now you are skulled. This can be done in a lot of different ways. 
---
Welcome to osrs btw, if you have any questions pm me
---
Your ability to communicate like a proper being checks out with your potato move.
---
Lol the autism plates are a nice feature 
---
ty for the updated info
---
from the very beginning, *especially without utilizing or relying on any previous work for assistance.* Hmm... 
---
So, if no one attacks for a few ticks, combat ends. He was probably trying to skull trick you, so he bound you, stopped attacking, and ran out of range for a second so when you hit him you would become skulled.
---
Oh, well gl on the grind be sure to spend a few hours dhing nmz so you can imbue it

Isn‚Äôt the whole objective to be PKing from Scratch? His goal is to get max PK gear right??? Why so much hate if he trains with gear from his main as long as it doesn‚Äôt benefit the gear he‚Äôs PKing with¬ø 
---
its not their fault this time its mine...ahha

Clicking your mouse 1 extra time is annoying? You‚Äôre going to have a rough time doing more advanced PvM my friend

This would be a mammoth task for the devs to implement wouldn‚Äôt /u/Jagex_Kieren

&gt; Not using your mains account items to get your further ahead.
---
When did he use his main's items to acquire more PvP gear through PK'ing?
---
I promise you he didn't start the character and never tranfer anything over to train skills before the series...
---
&gt; EVscape easily broke his own rule "from scratch"
---
His own rule was "PK starting from nothing, only acquiring items for PKing through PKing." not "Never use any item except from PKing."
---
If you don't understand the series, it's clear that it was named badly, but it doesn't defeat the purpose of the series, or break the rules, and everyone is being dumb if they are saying it is/does.
---
The RNG bots are hosting bots for games of chance, which are against rs rules.
---
In the end this account, which likely is hacked, will likely be banned.
---
Buff that armor plz. 
---
EVscape has always annoyed me. He doesn't have the class of other area locked series / from scratch. It's pretty obvious he cheats alot off camera anyways. He cusses people for stuff he often does himself. His pking isn't up to par with half the other smaller channels even. All around just a mediocre guy.
---
stolen account advertising dice games
---
I mean to say that they dont even fix stuff when they are at fault. That means they are even less likely to help since this is yours.

you speak the truth my friend :/

It's called gambling , just because you got shit RNG doesn't mean other people don't win.

Thank you! Yeah I can‚Äôt really confirm because I was playing on mobile and it was a bit tough just to attack him but it‚Äôs possible he logged and someone else logged in on his spot. Guess I‚Äôll stay out of the wilderness :/ Just wanted to make sure there wasn‚Äôt some game change where that was possible now. I appreciate the reply!
---
Yeah I‚Äôll definitely see what all I need to do for it, mostly just knocking out 70 agility so the future of my slayer tasks are easy
---
Fair point. Every other roll is much straight forward though. I could put together a better tutorial ingame tbh.
---
Also made an entire video on how it's not viable to buy rigour and then bought rigour a few weeks later

How do you think the devs are paid on RuneScape? Lol

read the name dude its pretty clear i made this account for a reason
---
My one and only queen kill got spent on a torso, no regrets. 
---
Fair.  The Stronghold of Security needs to be updated to cover this stuff.  And honestly I'd like to see a new F2P entry level quest that basically teaches these concepts to warn new players.  
---
That and/or the banning spree could just make exceptions for relatively new accounts.
---
&gt; The current polls are 100% for a fact being abused
---
What does this even mean
---
Turn deposits worn items off in bank settings 
---
I understand where you're coming from. As much as I'd like to think that there would be enough opposition in Jagex and that they would just naturally accept the player opinion, it's still a possibility.
---
I'd expect that further measures or solid proof that Jagex can't skew results from the poll system would be needed or something along similar lines. But hey they could be rigging current results easily. It's just something where we just have to accept that they aren't all Mod Jed.
---
Yes it does. Do you even know what from scratch means? It's not a pure set starting with a load of gear from your main but only used to train. 
---
It's all a frame of mind :) I'm proud of myself, wanted to share, knew there were going to be haters, and here we are.
---
Celebrate the good no matter how small
---
They should add mobs that require agility to fight. Something quick and lethal, rewarding agility xp upon kills

And as we all know, salamanders are good at CASTING magic, it should get a +30 magic attack bonus so spells cast with it are more accurate.
---
Fuck that sub. It's literally an excuse to show off your ass while having a small runecape log in somewhere in the pixels. I thought it was gonna be Zuhaar material smh.
---
Every time man tries to override the opinions of idiots, to make a foolproof system, the universe gives us a bigger fool.
---
Who watches EVScape lmao
---
The idea of the series was to make enough money for max pure gear on an already relatively high level pure. He momentarily transferred the gear to train up his strength, didn't add any value to his "bank" towards the gear.
---
Hahaha! It's so true it's actually sad.
---
They're actually working on a weapon diversity update that is supposed to revitalize most different types of weapons so this problem fully goes away but as of now, there are very few weapons that have unique traits to them such as halberds, which have an extra range for AoE attacks, and chinchompas, which make all abilities AoE but are at t78.

---
Again, your entire argument is that you decided that your definition of what UIM should be is the correct one. All UIM and jagex themselves disagree with you. You are also passing judgement on how impressive someones account is while your own account is literal garbage. I already said all these things in previous comments, I don't know why you wanted me to repeat all of it.
---
Yeah I mean I haven't done it since osrs came out so it's been a few years, sure it's not perfect. I think part of it is just that without a real refined strategy, defender is just way way harder than the other roles too. I've also heard kieren say a number of times that the ba code is an absolute nightmare so I'm sure the tutorial is just as fucked and they don't wanna mess with it lol

* A Black D‚Äô Hide Top, Body, and Vambraces provides +86 Magic Defense. It costs about 15k.
---
* Maxed Mage equipment provides +174 Magic Attack Bonus, It costs about 388m.
---
**Calculations:** 
---
* Defense:  ((99 + 4)1.25)0.7 + ((99 + 19)1.25)0.3 x (64 + 86) = 17400
---
* Accuracy: ((99 + 10)1.25) + 8) x (64 + 174) = 34272
---
* Chance to Hit: 1-(17400+2)/(2(34272+1) = .75
---
Wearing items worth 15k, will prevent a mage with 388m in items from hitting you 25% of the time. How is that not unbalanced? 
---
Not only that, but you don‚Äôt have ‚Äútrash bonuses against everything else‚Äù. You‚Äôll literally also have +58 Ranged attack, +92 Stab defense, +77 Slash defense, +100 Crush defense, and +86 Ranged defense too? 
---
The difference between a Black D‚ÄôHide Body and an Armadyl Chestplate is an extra +3 Ranged attack, +1 Stab defense, +1 Slash defense, +1 Crush defense, +20 Magic defense, and +2 Ranged Defense. Literally the only major upgrade is the Magic defense.

Waterfall is also a good early quest. No reqs and with food to survive a few hits it's possible to skip right to level 30 attack and strength.

The series is called pure SET from scratch, not pure from scratch. He traded over items to train with then traded them back after he got the levels. This is the same thing as ditter's max set from scratch but no one complains about that. 
---
I am a postgrad double-major in statistics and computer science. You must have a very poor understanding, or fundamental misunderstanding, of both machine learning AND maximum likelihood in binary variable polling to make such a post such as this. A downvote to you, my good sir.

To be honest,  if jagex would have us believe them. Rs3's mtx pays for rs3 and partially for osrs. Meaning rs3 could drop membership needs all together.  Essentially you're just paying for osrs with rs3 being a free bonus

Goddamn is everyone fucking dense today.

Go watch the series from episode 1 when he trained a baby pure to ancients in less then 72 hours. He transferred 1 billion to the account literally at that point to train the stats.
---
Like none of this is a surprise to people who watch EV's videos regularly. His pking video series is very enjoyable, which you clearly have not watched an iota of a second of.
---
I'm not the biggest EV fan especially considering he left Mudkip behind as he gained popularity but it's very disingenuous of you to rip on someone that you don't support and have no context for outside of a screencap.
---
This is classic Reddit drama where you guys are bored af and are a shithead comment. Don't translate him being a shithead to someone in his comments as him marketing the pking from scratch as purely from scratch.
---
Maybe it's a little more clickbait then it needs to be but at the end of the fucking day since episode Zero of this series he's been completely upfront with how it will be played out.
---
Fucking hell you Redditor's and your misguided assumptions.
---
Don‚Äôt increase the speed of the 2h weps. Literally people use r2h for ftp pking and it‚Äôs fine as is.

Do you need to have a RL account for it to count? I hadn't bothered to make one yet but I will if it helps the wiki.
---
That's hilarious and awful and I need it. Support.

If it's that bad, change how magic resistance is applied. Instead of 250 mage level, apply +500\~ mage defense value.

Lowers TBow's abilities and still makes mage worthless.

I don't vote because I don't play enough to understand the consequences that some votes may have. I would prefer someone to vote for me.

Yes it does, it ruins the integrity of the series. It should be "from main", not "from scratch".

It ruins the point of the series.

Idk if this is even possible but imo the best way to simplify it is just to filter it so the ones you have in there are at the top.

I had someone with maxed total ask me if I wanted to help him antilure. It sounded shady and he had no need for me to help so I figured it was me being the middle man on a rwt transfer or something. I told him no and a week later he was banned. Doesn‚Äôt show up on the high scores anymore lol

It‚Äôs true that pmod reports have a higher priority, but this still only means these accounts get banned a few days post-report. Sadly pmods can‚Äôt do much vs these bots apart from sit at ge for 24 hours a day which none of them will do
---
I mean...are people expecting him to go the wildy at lvl 3 and attempt to pk his training gear? The point is he gets all of his pking gear from pking. I love EV's daily vids. Takes dedication to upload daily even though things may not be the most exciting.
---
To play devil's advocate; the series is "pure set from scratch." He's trying to pk enough for a max pure set or whatever. Training isn't hard and doesn't require any skill, he just saves time by transferring items for the purpose of training. He does not make the actual pking any easier because he doesn't use the transferred items for pking.
---
What? Waiting for a big hit to spec in the same tick? So diverse mate... pvm in osrs is just prayer flicking and some movement. Shit is outdated and will not hook the young audience. That and the grind this game brings
---
Somehow I knew there was more to this story. Typical toxic iron meme.
---
It's worth doing when you can't do any other course, or if you're superheating gold or something early on. The courses aren't that big of a difference when it comes to xp rates at lower levels.
---
Why would they add content by polling only pvp cemtered players if those same updates would affect the entire game? That makes no sense whatsoever lmao it would just eliminate a majority of community interaction with jagex, which is against the way they want osrs updates to progress. In my opinion just hiding poll results, and adding a higher total level requirement to vote would help the system a lot more.
---
Yeah I realised my high quality meme missed out on that one just after posting üòÇ

---
Support has no reason to publically lie, you didn't create this account.  It's as simple as that.
---
OSRS polls are the most backwards things ever. Everywhere around the world, every individual or organization that wants to be taken seriously with respect to elections or polls hides the results before people get to cast their vote.
---
Jagex on the other hand goes against all conventions and then dares to ask "Why do you want hidden poll results?", which is just mind-blowing. The real question that should be asked is "Why does Jagex not hide poll results?". They don't dare to admit that they don't understand what's wrong with it, while it's blatantly obvious that a major flaw of the current system is right in front of their eyes. (It's not the only issue, but definitely one of the biggest).
---
I don't know about others but back in the day when god wars dungeons came out, I always used to be the tank in the team because I had the worse stats so I just used guthan and my friends dfs to tank the bandos boss while others did the damage. I was basically just leeching and eating while all the others did the work. So I guess my answer is doing content when you don't have the stats for it.
---
Your post contributes no value.
---
I did this and literally went to every farming patch in the game that I could access and raked the weeds for the final time
---
It makes fight caves faster and therefore you won‚Äôt use as much of your inventory getting to jad. If your problem is with the jad fight itself the blowpipe isn‚Äôt really necessary.
---
It takes about an hour at lower range levels doing the caves with blowpipe, meaning you‚Äôll spend about 350k on blowpipe charges alone on each attempt.
---
In the end it depends on how much the fire cape is worth to you. 
---
Generally, you should become a member once you complete every f2p quest since you'll have the levels for a lot of early membs quests

Is there a plan for making the item drop tables and monster drop tables more consistent?
---
For example, right now the wiki has the abby demon black sword drop as (4/128) on the abby demon page and "common" on the black sword page.
---
Would this be a good thing for contributors to spend time changing? Or is there a plan to do this automatically at some point in the future.

On my uim just finished obtaining full graceful and by tonight ill have a 1mil cash stack through agility pryamid.  My next active goal is hunter to 83 or 99, whichever I feel like doing.  (is my favorite skill actually)
---
But I actually need an afk method on my phone.  Going to be away a while and wouldnt mind training melee with nmz while I can.  My melee is base 50.  Will complete monkey madness and sand crab my way to 60attack this week.    
---
Would melee void be best bet for decent setup on nmz normal?  What construction lvl do I need to store both graceful and void?  Ill be using all my chins after 83/99 hunter on range in ape atoll anyways.
---
I think this is a good direction to take b/c  I do no want to prayer flick during slayer tasks on melee anyways.  so higher stats is helpful.  Lastly, reccomended cash stack to get melee 60-85 in nmz?
---
I would just focus on one rotation at a time, if you dont get the rotation you want log out and it will put you on the dock. Zulrah really just comes down to practice, eventually you'll be able to do all the rotations without even thinking
---
Please tell me your did eyes of glouphine before starting rcing. Takes you straight to 22 from lvl 1
---
I'm genuinely curious as to why I have no drive to vote. I do care about the direction of the game with what comes and what goes but I feel like between not having too much time to play and most of the suggestions being either awful suggestions in general or ezscape updates I couldn't care either way about, I'm not motivated to even go look at the poll. 
---
As a sidebar, it sucks that the people who have enjoyed the game for years have the same amount of input as a brand new user. That being said, I don't know how you could change that effectively. Just because someone has played for years doesn't necessarily mean they have more valuable input, but on average, a veteran user will have more insight into the trickle effects of changes proposed in the polls than a new user.
---
Sounds like this game mode ain't for you.
---
Agreed but sadly I have a feeling this would fail at the polls.  
---
I believe this will be done automatically in the future so that it would automatically generate a list once we've finalised the process for monster drop tables.

just dont vote for easy scape updates or suggest them and u are welcomed
---
Yeah at the beginning he kicked people at the wildly altar to get his first stuff, then built up to like mitch scimitar, then monks robes, etc 
---
it was actually a pretty cool series at first. Now it's just kind of a normal pking series since he has enough money for normal gear
---
OP lied to us again....

As much as i love runelite and have used osbuddy, i dont think pk'ing in rs will come back to its golden days as long as those 2 clients are active.  Also removing the ability to hug trees and rocks in the wild killed tanking and was a nail that killed clans in the wild.  PVP just isnt the same in osrs like it actually was in pre eoc.
---
It happens once or twice a century, I‚Äôve heard. 
---
 I fuck with highlighting like herbs and untradables but not big ticket items. I like to see the red text for ultra valuable when I hit a big drop instead of just the same color as an ancient shard lol
---
I‚Äôve had this issue as well on IOS - since I updated I have to enter my details every time.. 
---
are dragons salamanders
---
Once again our hero is here to save us from bad grammar. Thanks you, Sir.
---
Has one checked their drop table? They probably have different dp than male trolls.
---
Blowpipe is insane, the only drawback is the upkeep cost. If given the choice between only having bp or tbow I'm sure most people who have both would take the blowpipe, really makes you think. 
---
Also keep in mind this is a bis list for xp and kill speed (pet hunting) and assumes ddarts are used.
---
or are salamanders dragons
---
Appreciate the info!
---
carpal tunnel now 
---
&gt; A strength and attack bonus for them would be useful instead I think.
---
the max hit would have to be brokenly high in order to compete with the scimitar. That will not be good for PvP.
---
It‚Äôs Wednesday my dudes isn‚Äôt a swampletics meme 
---
which nobody seems to know about lmfao
---
Wtf lmao. Nice fam
---
Name checks out
---
Eh, apathy voting has never been proven, which is why entire countries adopted mandatory voting.
---
Nope not at all, I was just kidding
---
Well salamanders are slimy I think and there‚Äôs a dragon type Pok√©mon called goodra that‚Äôs a.. goo..dragon soooo I would imagine yes that must be true 
---
You can't, people are assuming. If someone gives you platinum you can reply saying thanks to an automated message and if they respond back then you can see who it was.
---
Or fire dragons in Nieve‚Äôs cave 
---
Voting skill when
---
You autistic retards that get so jealous of content creators because they have your dream job are so funny.
---
The problem too is it‚Äôs a circlejerk over untrue opinions that come from retards, it‚Äôs actually extremely sad
---
When did Minecraft get a farming guild?
---
Revamp Castle Wars
---
1. All supplies and gear are provide in match
---
2. Only god spells + standard spell book stuff like entangle
---
3. New rewards that are worth playing the game for in addition to the classic ones 
---
And I also want the bounty crater to be back, but not to replace bounty hunter as it is. 
---
Let me guess, you haven't watched the series.
---
delayed until Thursday you noob.
---
Only UK people can vote. meh
---
You're in the drop rate...
---
This sub is full of autistic retards and it seems you're one of them.
---
Oooo that makes sense, thank you!
---
They are 100% rigged, i watched a guy trade one 200 mil in 1-15 mil trades in the span of 2 minutes the other day before he figured out it straight up wont pay after 1ish mil.
---
Have you at all entertained the possibility that I might just support the idea, and the fact that the one gild I gave clearly enraged you so much made it all the funnier to gild the remaining two?
---
Everyone made it sound like he was using the gear from his main to pk. But I don't see how what he did affects the series, what would it change if he simply trained before starting?
---
lint roll your knee high socks please
---
You and other people here have obviously not watched the series.
---
Hohoho. Delightfully Devilish, Seymour. 
---
What?
---
The lesson is to actually go through the stronghold of security lol
---
Fuck off kid why would you not want them hidden?
---
So my first post on reddit has raised my awareness against the further use of the pointless red circle. Message received üòÇ
---
What is a elder tree ?
---
You are so fucking autistic it hurts.
---
Well just figured out it‚Äôs MorYtania, not Mortania.  I logged back in after a few months break a few days ago and tried finding my Mory legs 3 to fill bone crusher to do some slayer, but couldn‚Äôt find them so tried getting them from the ahievement guy again... I‚Äôm so dumb
---
Smells like a shitpost to me
---
&gt;sore taste
---
Name calling! how grown up Mr professional pants!

ü¶Äü¶Ähide poll results because we're incapable of thinking for ourselvesü¶Äü¶Ä
---
I don't get it, but I would be so mad if you spent another $6 of your own money on this thread. I really hope you don't spend more money on this thread because I would be so butthurt if you did. Nothing would ruin my day more than seeing a doomed idea get gold.
---
Naa, I'm a complete random that no one knows.
---
It's 1+b. Leave it the way it is.
---
I mean I agree with that point 100%, but just to be clear, the capes in the image already exist in game, the point of this post is that if you combined your infernal cape with a max cape, and then a new skill came out, you would have to train the new skill to 99 to be able to use your infernal cape again. 
---
  Since adding the max cape to infernal (and other BiS capes) adds no benefit and only changes it cosmetically, I believe it is actually punishing to any players who do this if a new skill is released, because you would have to grind new completely unrelated content to use the Infernal cape you already unlocked completely legitimately.
---
really, care to name some?
---
Am I the only one who thinks his stomach looks like his huge Werner? :(
---
You‚Äôre wrong.
---
Yeah but i fucked ur mom lil bitch hahahaha
---
The god cape should have at least one prayer bonus.
---
Then again it's a pure mage item not a prayer item so i'm not concerned much either way.
---
Whore thot bitch
---
It's not. The purpose of the series is to pk a pure set "from scratch." aka nothing. 
---
None of the gear used to train is used to pk. 
---
I have. It doesn't matter what he's said his rules are earlier if he still calls it "from scratch". If he uses a phrase that isn't accurate it's still wrong, even if he warned you it was wrong.
---
It's literally like me making a video title saying "OMG I got 6/7 ToB items on my Hardcore Ironman" and then in the video I say "oh actually I'm just a normal ironman".
---
further motivation  
---
This. 
---
I agree with both of your ideas 100%.
---
Crass is actually really fucking good and influenced a lot of future punk artists. You should give them a listen if you have a chance, Banned From The Roxy is my personal favourite. 
---
It's honestly baffling how thick headed they're being about this. It's polling 101.
---
&gt;You are also passing judgement on how impressive someones account is while your own account is literal garbage.  
---
This does imply that I am in no position to criticize UIM.  
---
 
---
&gt;What's even more funny is that you went back to check what I said a day after the convo happened, and then also made up some bullshit about me dodging responses.
---
I‚Äôd like to go back and see if there was anymore discussion. I only saw you replying ‚Äú?‚Äù 2/3 times so, yes. I wanted to see if you had anything else to say which you did.  
---
Of course, my opinion is irrelevant. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs an opinion. Doesn‚Äôt stop me from giving it. 
---
ill just kms then :(
---
personally I think there should be no stat boosted max capes, Should stay a nub stat cape with tele perks.  Completionist cape should have all the best cape stats effects added to it. One of the few things rs did right was those capes.
---
Support 
---
Wow I almost didn't recognize your name. You must be the proddy3 from the runescape twitch scene. Man you're awesome, I see your kappa emojis in chats ALL THE TIME. I had no idea I was in the presence of a god.
---
What if there was just a motivational crab next to the poll that cheered you on after voting? 
---
I get the point of the account but that's not the topic of the thread 
---
The most I ever made was a 4.5m cash stack a guy killing KBD forgot to put away. It was great
---
tbf with barraging slayer, i'd bet alching past 13m will do fuckall in comparison to that, when it comes to ranks
---
Some weapons like the claws and longswords/hammer have some stat buffs.
---
The problem with slow weapons is they cannot be viable unless the max hit is so high that it breaks PvP. This is because the speed difference is too great.
---
&gt; So it's not really a from scratch series? Why not at least train the account to whatever stats it needs off screen and then start the series.
---
How is it functionally different from that? 
---
The "from scratch" part refers to pking a pure set. 
---
I know this is fake because there's no giant "jamflox"
---
Other than that 130k average p k. With a 400k average on craws and mace carriers
---
Elders are more afk for sure :) 
---
After they level fishing up I seriously doubt they keep fly fishing when they could fish for profit. If they're bots, the will fish a profitable fish to RWT the gold.
---
Why are you so bothered about this thread, the gilds and me gifting them? You've commented 14 times on this thread about it, almost 10% of this entire thread is you.
---
please stop gilding this post
---
Oh darn, it didn‚Äôt pass?  Sucks for me. 
---
One benefit at the cost of a big con, so your choice in weighing it (assuming you're a pker):
---
Pro:
---
1) You can pot up less since if you're at the cusp of your max hit, then you'll need to re-pot up to the maximum possible to be able to hit that max hit
---
Con:
---
2) You could gain a combat level, so check to make sure you're at the "strongest for your combat level"
---
He originally started this account featured in the series ‚ÄúPvP set from scratch‚Äù in another video in which he set out to see how quickly he could create a baby pure with unlimited money that was ready to pk. I forget how long it took and how much he spent but he did it in I believe in under like 50 hours or something.
---
Fast forward: now the baby pure he originally created is not completed but he was antsy to learn to pk he decided to go on and start using this account that was NOT completed(aka not max stats for combat) 
---
He used this account to create a new series which this entire post is about called ‚ÄúPvP set from scratch‚Äù in which he takes us through his journey of PvP progression with his self imposed rules of only using pk profit to buy gear to pk with. Also all he did from my knowledge was to transfer a granite hammer and torture to this account (he could have easily bought the hammer and may have even been able to afford the torture).
---
His entire series was based on the premise of him leveling and creating this account separate from the series in question. The ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù part was only applying to the gear/supplies he would use to pk with, as in only profits from pking would be able to be used to purchase gear and supplies to use whilst pking.
---
A lot of people probably haven‚Äôt followed the series and just assumed it was a baby pure from scratch, which is never what he intended and literally made a video showing how much he spent/how long he spent on making this pure
---
42 is the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.

I don't know who you're referring to. I'm not berating you whatsoever. I never insulted anyone. I was originally responded because you didnt understand why you were getting downvotes.

---
I never claimed there was a conspiracy, you put those words in my mouth. I just don't understand how you trust a backend that you have zero knowledge of, and which has been proven to not even catch a massive internal breach. No other company reacts to a person on a public forum by then talking about account details in public. Furthermore, they come talk in public without giving any proof, and yet you people come in and act like jagex is always right. There have been plenty of cases where jagex's "backend" has been shown to be faulty, why do you act like it isn't? You strawman'd my argument from the start and yet you want to bring up the fact that I got recruited into the "army of /r/science" initiative years ago.
---
Games like castle wars need better rewards that are actually viable.
---
Lol need ‚Äúi voted‚Äù bumper stickers. 
---
Fair enough. Makes sense now
---
I did redwoods all the way to 99. There is simply not a better afk mobile grind. 10/10 recommend
---
But training costs is not something that other people can completely forget about. The whole point of "from scratch" accounts is to show that you don't need money, gear, armour or whatever for a certain piece of content. Of course he will afford a max pure set quickly if he has no other costs, but most people have to pay for their own training.
---
"From Scratch" series' are meant to be inspirational for other people to say "there's no excuse for me not to do that, he's in my shoes". Except EV isn't in anyones shoes here but a rich guy that just drops tons of money on accounts to train them quickly. He's not experiencing what real "from scratch" accounts had to do. When B0aty made his infernal cape from scratch series, he didn't say "hang on, let me transfer over a max range set so I can kill armadyl easier for the ACB I need".
---
i said loot from 7.3k revs because the other 2k kills is when collection log wasnt out so it didnt count the drops i got then
---
the bone spear gives +0 prayer
---
You only got 1 queen kill to get torso??? How?? You have to get 375 pts in 4 roles, I killed like 4 queens in that time.
---
You would see the live poll results AFTER you cast your vote. Fack mate

Hopefully not his house

I‚Äôve never felt like my hand got tired from playing rs. I get why some people‚Äôs do but mine just don‚Äôt I guess haha

??? What happens tell me

Oh the innocence, you don't deserve this....

"SawCon my dick! L0l0l so funny"

It's one of those stupid things like Ligma where people say "What's Ligma?" and they respond "Ligma balls". I was trying to get back at him for using Ligma but he saw through my ruse.

I followed the efficient quest order on the wiki and trained using the most efficient methods available whenever instructed to train. Got graceful at 73.

Nobody wants to buy you shit from amazon. Get a job skank

welcome to my scratch kitchen, would you like the spaghetti-O's or the kraft mac'n'cheese
---
Found the poor kid
---
Can we please all agree to not even post meme ideas for clue rewards?
---
With the giant boot and runes cape I'm not so sure these ridiculous ideas won't make it into the game
---
Turn off the runescape setting that allows you to have collapsable toolbars and they will do that.
---
Nothing specifically, recently became interested in the game again thanks to swampletics but don't know if I should buy membership due to not knowing what I'd do.
---
The scythe is one of the strongest weapons in the game currently by a large margin and needs a nerf. See how bad your logic is?  The tbow doesn't need a nerf and the blowpipe does. 
---
Well you have occult and tormented for extra damage as well which are affordable
---
Apparently you can't even relate to your own quitting story considering you play [right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b0dxkv/can_i_start_raiding_with_these_levels_or_is_78/)
---
No but the game has come to a point where it's similar to WoW. You don't really risk anything when you die. Even in pk there are people who have like 20M on them but when they die you get like 90k. What's even the point anymore?
---
I came here to say this!
---
have you met swampletics?
---
Is it possible that the linux installation method in the old school wiki [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Linux\_game\_installation\_guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Linux_game_installation_guide) can cause bans for macroing?
---
Lucky. Mine start hurting anytime I do something incredibly click intensive for more than 15 mins. Like dart fletching and 3t fishing, and stringing bows way back in the day before it was automatic
---
1000% multi varrock pking was the shit fam. Lv 20 hill giants clan pking too. That was the real old school runescape.. Good memories :') 
---
I was thinking about this too. Imagine if you had like 6 alts or friends spec xfering while another rounded up nechs you would be able to infinitely spec if you used both nech rooms and had enough character to spec xfer, Tele to house and refil their spec with no downtime to the ‚Äúspeccer‚Äù
---
Ily

Not a kid but I for sure am focusing haha. Just a little log in before lecture

That's true as well, but I figured we were just talking about top/bottom armor slots. 
---
When have u ever seen an nher with a veracs brassard lol. Don't try and reinvent the meta as a noon 
---
Doesn't surprise me coming from a guy who bought his inferno cape cuz he couldn't get it after 1736378184682 tries. Then roasts people with cheese capes like 10 times a day like it's a huge meme. Saddo
---
Yes, but what happens? 
---
I LIKE THIS
---
Blowpipe should also be nerfed that's pretty obvious lol
---
You must've started at like 40 like me. I'm at 66 and need 10 marks.
---
Is that Robert Whittaker?
---
What are these friends you speak of? Seriously though I could see that being fun, but im so far from having the level for that üò≠
---
Cool you posted it then tried for internet points. 
---
&gt;Lets say it takes levels 92-95 to get your max hit from 40 to 41. Will there be any difference in the chance of hitting a 40 at level 92,93, and 94?
---
No, but there's a caveat. Your dps while potted can benefit from these levels because even if it doesn't increase your max hit at the maximum boost, it can still increase your max hit on down ticks of your potion.
---
Wtf is this? 
---
&gt; So it's not really a from scratch series? 
---
Not sure if youre just dumb, cant read, or just going along with the current circlejerk going on in the thread (that happens in this sub 24/7) because you cant objectively think for yourself.
---
His series CLEARLY states, **PURE SET** from scratch. Not just **pure** from scratch as in everything about the account is from scratch. Which means the series is ONLY about gaining a maxed pure set from scratch, which means MAKING MONEY. As long as he isnt using that gear to aid in making money (as in he isnt doing a money maker with the gear) and is only training in NMZ on it (and therefore SPENDING money) then in what way does it make any difference? The account was already a pretty high level pure before starting the series, so obviously it was a not an entire account "from scratch". Swear to god some of your autistic kids on this sub cannot think for yourselves and just go along with every circle jerk so you can farm your sweet little upvotes and look cool on reddit instead of actually being accurate with your comments even though often time being completely honest and truthful and accurate on this sub gets you downvoted because of well...autists who are socially retarded and whose lives are the internet.
---
I‚Äôm shocked no one has commented on the fact that OP is a dime.
---
Sigh... I'll get the big black dildo
---
I don‚Äôt think he is a content creator. He is saying that content creators have immunity to this and the accounts they use. They can easily make their own account but it will take a lot more time than asking to borrow one for a single video. 
---
The other account was locked for account sharing. The one with the first screen shot. He is saying if he was a content creator that account would have never been locked for account sharing. Since that‚Äôs what the majority of PK content creators do. Share accounts. 
---
100% true
---
Multi varrock was pretty active from the release of mobile until about January.  There are still clans and snipe teams though you just need to join one. 
---
Not that I‚Äôm proud to admit but back in my thriving grind I did 12+ hours ardy Knight grinds multiple different times and never once had any type of fatigue physically lol. Maybe I just got strong hand muscles lmaoo
---
Didn't know you could play on that lol must be awesome!
---
Now I don't know if I should watch the series to make sure you're telling the truth ;D lmao but yeah karma is a bitch
---
Also you get the same amount of points regardless of the seed you are using.
---
LOL!!!!! REKTTT
---
You can control for that after the fact with a large enough sample. There are statistics you can use to reliably remove false positives from a set.
---
But it would honestly probably round itself out on it's own unless an insane amount of people were doing it. Especially since we know that everything rounds to bit percentages (X/256)
---
\&gt;Posting your license plate number on reddit
---
Thanks for the account kid
---
some one make these but with nsfw content ok thanks
---
What a faggot. 
---
My entire point is based around the series being named "from scratch" and the fact that he trains with gear from other characters. The definition "from scratch" Is completely different and opposed to what hes doing. The series just doesn't make sense at all. Hes calling it exactly what its not and honestly imo. Its kinda of click baity. But again i never watched too much of the series so imo he just totally rename the entire series and what its called for no more confusion. Just because again calling something "from scratch" even if you dont want too, adds rules such as being legit about getting items, what you're training with etc, he could be grinding levels and bosses for better shit with other gear then what he acquired with on that acc which imo in a "from scratch" series is cheating
---
For me it's as simple as seeing the numbers go up and know that I'm progressing towards higher-level content. 
---
Runescape is and always has been primarily based on goal setting and time management, especially when you start cresting the 70s/80s and things start to become more grindy. 
---
If you ever feel yourself burning out or bankstanding without a purpose, try setting some goals. 
---
For example say your goal is taking on Raids 1. Well, you'll need to get 78 Herblore. But for that you need money...well PvM is good for money, but what to kill? Vorkath is excellent GP but you'll need to do Dragon Slayer 2...which you need 70 slayer for. Slayer will make you money in the meantime as well. From setting just one goal, you now have hours and hours of content to do. 
---
This^
---
Oh, I deserve it. Thanks for explaining.
---
Tie- th
---
If I see you, I'll tip my fedora to you. 
---
That‚Äôs what the grind is for (: I had 2 friends recently switch from RS3 and they are both only around level 60. I can give them advice and stuff, but really we are just waiting until they are high enough levels so we can do bossing. One step at a time, like starting from KBD and working towards raids. Hell, I am not even there yet. 
---
The grind is the fun, skills will never disappear even if gold does. And every quest, diary and skill you level up, you find new ways to train (more efficient or not)
---
I suggest talking to people while you do slayer or skilling. I‚Äôve met a ton of my in-game friends from just sitting at a slayer spot and chatting it up. Find a good CC and be active - you‚Äôll find your friends to boss with
---
Can't believe there are people who actually follow this autistic manchild.
---
What makes melee so much more valuable than range?
---
Spending an extra bunch of hours to train an account is bad for content, and not everyone values ‚Äúpurity‚Äù in the way you do
---
It generated views but generated lots of dislikes too. I never seen the first video but from all i've heard is it was a "from scratch" video where he was starting completely from the beginning and he ended up transfering items over to make his experience easier. Again idk but if its an adaption to "from scratch" then it shouldnt be from scratch if its not what from scratch is
---
If it gave strength bonus yes
---
swampletics happens
---
Damn i love USA, how much do custom plates cost and how long can you keep them? Like can you extend them?
---
Lol youre the fucking "bellend"(what is this England in the year 1643? Bellend?). The account was already a pure that was somewhere in the 70s CB before the series even started, and explicitly stated that the account WAS NOT from scratch as a whole and then clearly explained what he would be doing for the series. Which was that he would be taking everything off the account, and going to then MAKE MONEY from scratch to afford a max pure set, hence the name "Max Pure Set from Scratch". Notice how it doesnt say MAX PURE from scratch, just that he would be acquiring the set from scratch.
---
Im sorry youre so fucking dumb you cant comprehend such a simple concept but you might want to go back to 5th grade reading and consult whatever teacher attempted to teach you and tell her she did an awful job.
---
If everyone just stopped using them, they would disappear in about a week.
---
Yes it's fine. We don't need more unnecessary buffs to pvp. I'll definitely be voting no on anything like this.
---
just fucking hide them so we can get new fucking memes.
---
rogue set seems kinda useless now that you get coin pouches instead of just coins
---
sexy Juliet vans lol romeo would rock those everyday
---
I guess my first thought is that when they hide the polling there is presumably no way to confirm what the results are and cry babies will just go "NO FAIR THAT DIDNT PASS YOU JUST ADDED IT TO THE GAME WE PAY WE SAY" but idk
---
This is actually not a bad idea.
---
The principle. At least.
---
He said it was expressive 
---
Do we have proof of that?
---
so the value mostly comes from the difficulty or rate of xp gains? 
---
yeah you're still being pedantic about what from scratch means. 
---
A brilliant observation.

However, my post will not be making it to the front page, because it's anti-Swampletics. Anything anti-Swampletics gets downvoted by his obsessors. So, whilst I have made a Swampletics post, it will fortunately never make it to the front page, thus I am not actually contributing to the Swampletics posts in actuality.
---
Because the results are still visible to everyone else? Pretending a problem doesn't exist by ignoring it doesn't mean it fixes the biases that make the polls flawed in the first place. 
---
With the stats you need for post quest Vorkath, you can kill Galvek. He‚Äôs not as hard as you think. 85 range and 80 def with some tank gear and you‚Äôll be fine. Don‚Äôt be scared about giving it a go, dying is part of learning and you get all your stuff back by paying 100k. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go to post-quest Vorkath with less than 85 range
---
No. Press the booth, press vote. Start voting.
---
Maybe jagex could change the interface so the default isnt to show the first 2-3 questions for a split second while you look for the "vote" button.
---
oof

Do you understand the definition of irony lol?

Your comment and reading comprehension suggests you don‚Äôt

He's deleting comments lmao, trigger mission successful

please, tell me how you really feel

Lol, destroyed.

turn up ur dpi then lol

So what if everyone else did this? 
---
You do give your consent, loot tracker is an opt-in feature
---
No mate, I'm being accurate. Pedantic is a minor rule break that doesn't affect the spirit or the series, something like Swampletics grabbing himself a house. Incorrect labelling is what EVscape is doing, which is just flat out lying about what your series is.
---
What's your strategy on staying alive? What Revs do you kill? What stats do you have?

Ugh barbarian assault though

Why don't buy a keyboard and a mouse? I think that's the best way

No one fucking said that lol

Alright, thanks

I died doing RFD and lost my granite plate so I figured I might as well upgrade
---
Fighter torso is your upgrade and its free
---
My bigger hatred is that 81 agility shortcut in slayer cave. I'm 77 now but can't be bothered to go waste several days to get it. The stupid cave is designed in a way to punish you like 30 seconds per task for not having 81 agil. At least 70 is reasonable for the area.

yeah exactly, you're still doing it. stop spamming me pls

Having a bigger screen has its advantages and disadvantages. Not sure how the fire hd 8 will run osrs but with the recent update, tablets seem to run osrs just fine now. I do have a fairly large screen size phone and hardly use it to play osrs (it's more of a hassle for me because clicking a phone screen even with my small fingers ends up with me clicking everywhere) so i tend to play on my ipad mini most of the times. I can see how "normal" sized tablets can be a hassle too being that they are a bit too big to hold comfortably but smaller tablets seem like the right size.
---
How did jagex limit staking?
---
Yes, so teach people how to vote responsibly.
---
The solution is for people to vote according to opinion and not look at the results before voting.
---
I don't think they should ban people for gambling while the sand casino is still a thing.
---
Wtf..

lol you think they manually review everything
---
wow thanks for pointing that out man i was seriously freaking out over the wikis unethical collection of my video game data.

Only thing i hate about the "hype" is that its clearly only posted about for karma whoring. Go support him on his channel or social media outlet dedicated to him. The fucking endless 1 worded posts saying "swampletics" is just beyond annoying. Granted most of the shit posted on this sub is some shitty meme being reposted a million times. Karma and upvotes is such a shitty niche that reddit offers.

Glad to know im not the only one going through this. Big rough.

Tbh that's exactly what I would do if I was one of these region-locked UIMs.  Especially now that there are so many of them.  Tbh there's zero chance that at least some of these guys aren't "cheating", especially any who don't stream at all.  The videos consist of like ~15 minutes of clips that are only a few seconds to a minute long showing all the various things they got done.  All you'd have to do is go elsewhere to a real training method, get almost all of the xp/goal you're going for, then hop back over to your region and turn the camera on and be like ayyyy 40 prayer.  You'd get it done in an absolute fraction of the time and no one would be the wiser that you didn't ACTUALLY spend 60 hours getting fucking 2k xp/hr in mining or what have you using whatever unplayably slow method you "discovered" for your region.
---
Go watch surg1n‚Äôs new video about this exact topic. Came out less than 24hrs ago. The guy telling you dura is best money maker doesnt have a damn cluewhat hes talking about.

For extra reading look at surg1n‚Äôs video about slayer block lists.

Needles and springs would not be made out of iron...so it's more like if you completely changed your self you can be anything. Just saying

Ah fair play. Maybe it‚Äôs something you just get used to. Hah
---
Most children these days have gambled, they're condition by games like Overwatch, Apex Legends, and other "loot box games" where the rewards are randomized and you have to continually "buy in" to for a *chance* to win what you want. The only reason they aren't legally gambling, is because you can't "cash out" with real world money. That's why Jagex had to stop letting people buy Runefest tickets with bonds. It allowed people to convert digital currency to real world money, which ran be achieved through RNG elements like the sand casino. 
---
You runelite, you filthy sewer rat. 
---
Lmao
---
That's probably what happens to the people who play it for the videos, but people who play the account for themselves wouldn't 
---
I'm glad I got hacked this game is too addicting. 
---
Make voting a skill. 
---
I don't get what is the problem there. Did people suddenly wake up and are surprised he didn't level up a pking account by pking only? It was about the gear, Link's Ocarina has the same thing. 
---
Erm..thats like saying with staking its always one persons loss. Thats a flawed idea to make PvP more "rewarding" and I'll start with saying that pking is not a viable means of making money in this game for most players. Changing the way that works would be dumb. 
---
F.. sorry bro

You know you've gotta learn what words mean at some point right? I can help!

Lol, haven't you seen the videos of second party moderators that start to believe in the conspiracies they're forced to watch all day? Working pressure is supposedly extremely high and most people don't last very long.

Hey man. You should give Empathy PvE a try! We have daily bossing events, learner raids and regular raids and pvp events. You are never forced to come events, just chilling in the cc is fine too. Find our recruitment thread here: http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?320,321,113,66062890,goto,1

What kind of response is that? We should all play p servers instead of trying to get jagex to improve their game? We can do both lol

You can keep them as long as you pay for them. Registration depends state by state.

Tell us more about pre-ge rs and how it used to be

Use someone else's altar
---
use the Chaos Altar. Has a 50% chance to not consume the bone and gives 3.5x xp just like the gilded altar. The problem it's in the wildy so you can easily get killed
---
Use the Ectofunctus. It gives 4x xp but is a lot slower
---
Use ensouled heads.

---
Thats dope, enjoy it.
---
The odds are fixed by the game itself at the sand casino.  With player-run games of chance, it's impossible to distinguish rigged scams.  Rigged scams are RWT machines.  People RWT based on winnings from the sand casino, but the winnings cannot be guaranteed.
---
They wouldn't be banning people for gambling.  They would be banning people for encouraging botters and RWTers.
---
Lmfao or just vote because you care about the game
---
Saw it, had to make the title better 
---
Jesus, you just got a golden ticket
---
You can easily find out if they cheated with cml
---
Sure, I'm sure some (most? Who knows) of them are doing it for the "right" reasons, which is primarily for their own challenge/satisfaction.  So you wouldn't cheat yourself.  No chance that's all of them though.
---
A potential solution to the pvp/pvm voting issues is to put 1-2 poll booths in the wildy that are exclusively used for pk-related updates. This way to vote on those changes you would need to risk and it can create another hotspot or meta spot depending on the poll cycle.
---
triggered
---
Exactly. They're also too stupid to understand that the Tbow is only really good at Inferno and Raids 1. Every other boss that it's good at (ie Sara, Hydra) are low-end bosses for anyone who owns a 1.2b item.
---
Go fuck yourself he just gave you the exact same logic for the bone spear and you sperg out? 
---
You can leave NMZ whenever you want
---
Do you camp around 30? I've 99 agil so getting away wouldn't be too hard, could possibly risk a craws in downtme. 
---
Oh wow that‚Äôs crazy. 
---
Saw the logo and double took... thought I finally met another runescape player in real life.
---
That's fairly harsh I feel like. Some people spend months getting their infernal cape because they do it the old fashioned way of earning it legit and probably have no interest in doing it again.
---
Inferno is a special hell that I am sure some people would never want to see again. Maybe your masochistic and feel player's still didn't earn inferno if they can't do it twice, but man I feel for people on this so I'd vote yes if it was polled.
---
I didnt spam anyone, want to know why? There is no real person to spam. It is all automated. Any other MMO would resolve this issue. Not Jagex though. There is clear proof i was hacked but for some reason cant get any support? I mean what crazy person refunds a graceful set? Not me lol i am just happy that it seems like they are starting to listen

&gt;He's not the brightest. He said mage needed rabalancing (buffed) because he kept splashing on black d'hide while using a staff of water and salad robes. I'm not saying black d'hide isn't arguably a little op for the price but complaining you're splashing on level 70 anti-magic armour with a level 1 staff and level 20 robes is just dumb.
---
A water staff is +10 mage which really isn't all that low compared to other staves, also he is correct in that mage sucks/dhide is OP, he just wasn't in the best gear to make that point.

Im the wrong subreddit lmao

ooF

What the fuck is the point of a releasing a poll blog if they're not going to read feedback on the questions.  They should be splitting, condensing, clarifying, doing SOMETHING based on poll blog feedback, but they don't.  They just release the poll the next day with no changes, then are surprised when there is resentment.  
---
Some of their poll ideas are good, but need to be refined to be viable, but they refuse to do so and good potential content is dead in the water.
---
I wish there was an option to hide pets, they're so dumb.
---
I don't even know who evscape is or what his series is about but what a twat

Then we'd accomplish the exact same thing as actually hiding the results. The entire thing you're trying to argue against.

Well supers are relatively expensive for lower lvl people, probably why.

How about you don't need to vote for the pet, just open the interface and scroll to the bottom? You'd only get 1 roll per poll regardless
---
yeah it sucks, over time you just get used to the mechanics of it and it's more afk i guess

You should also definitely complete quests that are required for Recipe for Disaster since the completion of that quest gives you Barrows Gloves which is one of the best glove slot items.

It may be fast to get through whatever means, but if that Jad run is a failure then a low-mid level account essentially just used those 1-2k scales as sand crabs.

They should just test it tbh. If nothing passes then so be it and we'll have to think of a new way 
---
i assume that is blowpipe using dragon darts though which is very expensive, and obviously tbow isnt going to be BiS for things like zygomites they arent bosses so why include them.
---
It ultimately depends on your stats and whether you‚Äôre using melee or not. Before I used void, I used full range and mage switches to maximize accuracy.
---
Nah there's way worse subreddits than this
---
Now I'd be absolutely in the wrong to suggest a third party client to yourself, and you should definitely use the jagex provided client, but if I were to suggest a client, which I'm definitely not doing...
---
Ah fuck it, just use runelite

mousekeys involves using your keyboard to move the mouse a fixed distance and making very precise clicks. Pretty sure this sets off the automatic system because you are clicking the exact same pixel hundreds or even thousands of times.

Oh totally true. But this one is still completely filled with toxicity and just makes me think the game is falling off the deep end
---
That's because Mod Ash unfortunately doesn't own Jagex only works for them. When they say jump he does his best to do his thing but right before Jagex is like "your fired!" he says what the company pays him to say.
---
You can toe the line all you want but eventually you still want those paychecks being deposited. You also have more influence on the inside of the company then being self righteous and leaving because you personally disagree with one company policy.
---
just use whatever melee armour you have that's best. Magic accuracy doesn't matter. Also you might wanna bring a meele weapon for ahrim and karil, depending on your stats.
---
Big yikes going on in this comment chain 
---
Thinking jagex should make paying for protection clans illegal does, it's quite obvious.
---
This guy was sadly real.
---
As already mentioned this data comes from RuneLite, from an anonymized database export of its loot tracker.
---
I think that projects like this are very important to the longevity of RS. For example when RSC was announced to be shut down, the community tried some last minute data collection from the players https://www.reddit.com/r/rsc/comments/8lybzc/rsc_preservation_project/ to use to recreate the game. With enough time I think OSRS will end up in a similar situation, and right now we are in a unique position where we can collect game information from the masses effectively. Hopefully more projects like this are to come.
---
IIRC I'm sitting at 86 laps per hour, with high alching. Might be possible to squeeze out 90 if you're paying max attention.
---
Yes. We remove bias, and people can still follow the poll if they want to.
---
Yo bro what do you even do after 99 slayer? I'm close but have no idea what to do after 99. 
---
Admittedly I wasn't considering Crystal Mathlabs, but doesn't it only get as granular as like a daily xp rate?  That would defeat part of my point which was to get videos out on time, but theoretically couldn't you just train for like an hour a day doing a real method instead of 10 hours a day doing a silly region locked one?
---
This guy got 99 melee stats on tutorial island
---
10 marks of grace can be traded for 100 amylase crystals. Each mark of grace is worth about 10k at current prices.
---
Rich mains give them to their alts. How do you think the low combat infernal capes were done?
---
But that's besides the point anyway. It's just about making sure that the power level of weapons matches their requirements. Karil's cbow and Twisted Bow are 5 levels apart, think about that. 
---
He literally just said it's not a grind mate..? Tf lol
---
hes not trying to make a pure just get a pure set, hes trying to pk a pure set not train a pure, it doesnt matter what he uses or where he gets it he just wants a max pure set
---
Wrx?
---
If you had every safety precaution provided by jagex in place, and had antivirus software on you PC, then you have to put it down to jagex.
---
However, if you didnt, then that's on you.
---
I feel like jagex need to bring something in that makes it almost impossible to hack an account, then that way, if someone is hacked, it's the players fault and they wont get any items back 
---
It's funny how people don't want them to make an educated change, and instead want them to just brute force a change that may not be the best possible solution. 
---
They literally just want to research the topic of how to solve the issue.
---
Rs3... you can now code anything you want.
---
Yeah for sure, it's more about learning it the first few times anyhow, just my two cents
---
True, but currently i prefer the slayer master in kourend, because of the unique drop table from the chest even tasks like hellhounds are profitable with a prayer setup
---
However i think i will give it a shot, maybe it will be even better
---
Thanks for your advice :) 
---
I don't know, as far as gaming subreddits go this one is easily the worst I've come across.  Low content flow and minimal moderation allows trolls and dumb opinions to just thrive.  Most people come to subreddits for info, but this one is mostly a social/meme subreddit.
---
Not sure I understand the first bit of your question but this is not a content suggestion thread, simply questions about the game that players need help with.
---
As for the second part that would be disgustingly broken xp/hr
---
Nice. 
---
Bro wtf are you doing with your life? Accounts cant just get "hacked." Not unless A) you bought the account,  or B) you fall for some stupid phishing scam and agree are too embarrassed to admit it.  
---
But how many polls will there futuristically and necessarily be? Will we get polls every week? Will it ever slow down or pick up? 
---
Because nothing changes about your account while it is not logged in.
---
You're really not good at taking jokes. I've seen the RSGW posts, I'm aware. 
---
but from what I know, if they have absolutely no info on you other than publicly available info, should be close to 0 if not 0%...right?
---
That is funny, since I just finished watching it and nowhere did he 'disagree' with everyone. He, just like everyone else, was on board with gathering data before jumping the gun. 
---
Ironically Reddit has a mob mentality when it comes to hiding poll results 
---
The marks of grace are like 160k an hour, at Seers with the hard diary. It's not much but it's better than nothing. With high alching addy platebodies I'm sitting at about 220k an hour.
---
It is possible he wanted to get you banned rather than the dropper throught some weird money-laundering scheme. I have no idea how the system works.
---
And so on and so forth
---
To me the entire story sounds very weird from both sides. Idk what to believe anymore. 
---
If I‚Äôm being completely honest, I think both sides are to some extent lying and/or making mistakes. I believe OP to some extent is mostly truthful, although probably hiding some small detail. I also believe the Jmods are either hiding some info or simply making a mistake. 
---
So much of his story adds up, and lines up well with the Jmods story, yet there‚Äôs a few small differences. It‚Äôs also weird that Jmods are treating someone sending threatening hacking messages as the original owner and not seeing anything wrong with that. Add on top of this that ‚Äúaccount sharing‚Äù isn‚Äôt against the rules, yet when OP regains access to the account by going to THE original owners (whether it be him or someone else) location and recovering with all correct info, Jmods re-lock it again and threaten to ban him if he continues to recover his own account again. 
---
This is a wild ride. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter for falling. Only levelling up will prevent falling. Not sure the levels though. Weight reduction just means your run energy will deplete slower 
---
It used to be glitched and worked on unlimited targets. 
---
duradel until you get hydras, lets you do gorillas (which is insane gp/hr), cerb (more freely), etc. 
---
when you unlock hydras, i‚Äôd camp konar for tasks. 
---
Yes weight matters 
---
That snowflake on the M really fucked with me. Like when it was just a thumbnail I could read Winter Is but I was like "I know what that's supposed to say but it doesn't look like it".

Stupid snowflake.

The nation of dinkdinkdink.... dink.... DINK would like to forge an alliance with the nation of tinktinktink.... tink.... TINK against the enemy of tickticktick.... tick.... TICK. Do your people accept this offer?
---
Trap?
---
Not speaking from experience, but from what I've heard there are a few clans that pretty much dominate the caves at all level brackets. The agility shortcut will help you evade them but I don't think the gp/hr is very good because of how much clans try to kill you.
---
I agree completely. However, even if it is the fault of the player they shouldnt be left to suffer with nothing but automated links to FAQ pages to help them. If my stuff got stolen in a different MMO, lets say WOW as an example, their support would remedy the situation very quickly and id have my hard earned things back. I am hoping Jagex can learn and change. I personally know many players who have quit OSRS because of this. We need to be encouraging new players not making people want to leave.
---
I don't need to impress you. You're not my dad. 
---
Oh, so if i don't like some content creator i can't talk about him? That's interesting
---
That's the way I see it. They wouldn't even have your login as ign is different. 
---
Haha just watch the original video about how fast he can create a baby pure if you don‚Äôt wanna watch the series, you‚Äôll see what he clearly explains he did with the account! I quite enjoy his PvP series considering I‚Äôm starting to level a baby pure and just beginning learning pking (used to pk back in 06) in osrs
---
Change the interface you say..
---
You mean like.. Hiding poll results?
---
Is there a quicker method to get to an altar? I dont have one in my poh yet so currently i go to Camelot to restore prayer then run to the fairy ring next to the legends guild.
---
I need to buy a damn slayer ring.
---
Tanzoo CC Reppin
---
It does. You just lack the self control.
---
Does this accommodate the different drop tables between monsters? For example, the goblins in the GWD have some different drops from regular goblins around lumbridge and what not.
---
OP is a total cunt judging by post history.  Thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. Honestly reading his dumbass comments just make me cringe
---
I mean I completely understood why jagex didnt have a customer support phone service when osrs came out, but now its successful and it should absolutely have one.
---
I remember back in the day when I first started, getting support was easy.
---
Both of these suggestions are broken AF. If they let you "fletch all" you could do 20 mins of completely AFK fletching, come back, click twice, and keep going. There is a reason it is limited how it is.
---
And Insta-casting any spell would be insane for exp/hour 
---
DUDE YES. Now make one for law school pl0x
---
Ardy cloak is pretty good early on. 
---
That did happen in rs2. Not sure if it carried over to osrs or not.
---
except it doesn't work that way regardless. Plus it's not like they can't revert the changes if they're not seeing the results come through and can make it clear that they can.
---
It's just annoying that they HAVE to make it a complete democracy on EVERY thing, like specific QoL changes that should be implemented regardless.
---
P2P is absolutely worth it imo. Exponentially more things to do.
---
They lack the self control.
---
bro the last few months have had multiple things each month lmao

Haha that might backfired cause i liked how that was a nice clever jab instead of being completely toxic

I tried this before but i never got a response back.
---
If we're being pedantic, getting the cape while using melee would imply you're meleeing the boss, which you literally can't do. Doing the caves normally and using an sgs is "using melee".
---
Don't be pedantic.
---
Git gud
---
No. Christ that'd be awful.
---
He is also missing a comma (,) after 'However'.
---
I kind of get this sentiment, but at the end of the day 'completionists' is just another sect of players.  It's in Jagex's interest to consider how their updates will effect every sect of player.
---
Just roll credits the second you equipt a tbow
---
How did you miss that sarcasm? Couldn't have been more obvious.
---
What the actual FUCK is this RNG
---
Right? Having an open dialog between the devs and the community is so unique. Why not take advantage of it and try a few things out here and there, just being open about it. We ain‚Äôt gonna judge if it doesn‚Äôt work out, and we‚Äôre just as eager for a solution as the devs are. I don‚Äôt see a negative of tempering expectations, but still at least trying it for a few polls. 
---
happy cake day to the biggest crab ever
---
I feel like a dipshit because I use my ardy cloak and didnt think to use the tele.
---
That's because servers are supposed to be better than OSRS' servers are. 
---
Never worth it to skull with Craws, you will die and lose it in there. Probably pretty quickly
---
lost all their money getting 99 prayer, resorted to buying gold, and now they're an example on reddit
---
&gt;ice\_poseidon2 apparently got raided by FBI.

&gt;Idk more random streamer drama. I went to the subreddit and it says "this sub has been quarantined do you wish to enter?" Like goodness your a OSRS/RS3 or whatever streamer and your community is so bad it gets itself quarantined? Yikes.

&gt;But the answer seems to do with not paying taxes or purposely evading paying them/lying. He apparently lives in a mansion or something. Idk I'm done researching this goon, hopefully people find this comment useful.

I am one and the pmod discord is very active and there's constant discussion about this issue. Pmods can't do anything against this issue.

I didn‚Äôt delete anything how autistic are you that you‚Äôve been reading the same comment chain for over 48 hours straight? Literally you exist only to kill other people‚Äôs brain cells

alright will give it a look now
---
First no swampletics on Wednesday and now this smh
---
I think sara, arma, cerb, and hydra are definitely still worth doing but yea I see your point
---
There wouldn't *have* to be any gap to fill. They just used it as an excuse. It's not because you change the reqs of tbow and blowpipe that you'd be forced to make new t75 weapons. It literally does not matter.
---
Quality content right here

Then unfortunately it seems you guys aren‚Äôt trusted well enough to do the jobs you have to do.

‚ÄòThis means the next swampletics episode is only in 6 days!‚Äô
---
It does contribute to falling. Read a wiki.
---
I'm not saying I agree, just that they recently addressed this type of suggestion
---
Best idea would be to just add the temporary bedroom while training. Also keep in mind that the servants coin pouch exists as an item you can build on a bedroom to remove the dialog for paying the servant when training
---
So basically you're after the advantages of being a pure but with none of the disadvantages. If you're gonna min-max, you have to accept the mins.
---
Rip OP‚Äôs inbox.
---
Exactly and they used to have an item recovery system but unfortunatly it was abused and taken away. Hopefully they find a way to impliment something that works

Ah, could it be possible that using a trackpad on a laptop would be interpreted a similar way, as some remapping of the mouse keys, and would be flagged as some kind macro?

Because the community voted no on it. They should just repoll it and it'll pass. But if we start ignoring our voting system then we are ignoring a vital part of what made osrs the game it is today.
---
I think what makes this subreddit unpleasant are posts like this, doomsayers and negativity farmers who can't do anything better than be critical.

can u change ur gender on osrs? im about to change my character to a guy. 
---
No, it would be the equivalent of paying for cooking classes so you can make a good pie, not paying for part of the pie itself.
---
Lmao imagine getting so butthurt over someone making a simple comment that you call them a fucking twat and risk your reputation as a streamer. 
---
These comments are great. And when I say great, I meant fucking retarted because apparently we‚Äôre making our own definitions for words today. 
---
Sorry bud. Just learn from this. 
---
You should also ensure you're at a proper height with proper arm posture. 
---
No doubt that you know this already, but the slightest change in arm position can entirely negate any sort of pain. I found that some discomfort was alleviated when my wrist was raised.

---
There are a lot of cars in the world that work fine but are still pieces of shit. 
---
We can't trust the players to make good decisions because they're selfish and vote to make the game easier. So what's your point.
---
They are scared of nothing passing, but then just adjust how things win. Instead of 75%, it's whatever has the most votes. Wouldn't that fix that problem?
---
U mad bro? Because YOU sad bro? The only pussy that u get comes from you dad bro! I've got a mad flow, U can't kill Jad, bro! Your so autistic that I'm starting to feel bad bro. So just repeat, "triggered" freely, cause your level of consciousness is so beneath me.

ONE SMALL FAVOR
---
He literally says episode one that all training will be via funds from his main, the only part from scratch is pking money for his gear. That's not even remotely disingenuous.
---
&gt;How does it no longer make it from scratch
---
You talk about making sense with your arguments, but how can you say this in reply to someone quoting the definition of whats up for debate.
---
This is the exact definition of the phrase from scratch. Regardless of if you like his videos or not, EV abides by absolutely 0% of that definition. He didn't start at the beginning, and he did rely on previous work for assistance. He's welcome to make whatever rules he likes, but they are not "from scratch". He could say "pking my way to max gear" and that would be accurate, but the series is not in any sense of the phrase "from scratch.
---
I get really tired of EVScape and his boys using the "from scratch" meme.  But I can see why they do it because it gets the most clicks.  I still watch their streams but I don't watch it *because* I want to see wealth built "from scratch." 
---
All the triggered redditors just makes Evscapes comment even funnier 
---
No, the smaller pixel icon actually has a red pixel. Not sure what to do about that...
---
no, its the same people just with different accounts
---
Kinda ironic based on my post but yes this is exactly what i think too, the negativity just annoys me in an irrational way
---
More than anything, people are just pissed because he was such a tool about it. The initial question was super innocent and he just came in swinging. It was totally unprofessional and left a bad taste in everyone‚Äôs mouth.
---
I hope someone saw this on W331 a month ago, a guy gambled and lost over 180m in 20m intervals...What people don‚Äôt realize is your odds of winning when you be low amounts are higher so that you‚Äôre temped to bet big. After certain thresholds the odds lower drastically and after a certain go amount - 5-10m your odds of winning are almost non existent. Why people trust these dicers bots thinking that they are legit and regulated is fucking stupid.

I was just putting in the bare minimum you can wear, and TriVoid is excellent still for Raids 2 at least, but not Raids 1.
---
Bandos/Fero is extremely good though in ToB, but the other poster was saying everybody needs a Scythe/TBow to join a raid team often.  Not everybody needs that cream of the crop bank value to raid.
---
Can you not follow directions? Why did you put a space in front of the "S" ?
---
Can you go into a bit more detail on how this works? Returning to the game for the first time in 12 years and I don't really know what you mean. 
---
90% of your post history is bitching about swampletics.
---
They said theres more flaws to the polling system than them being visible. Kieran:"hiding poll results wont make that number (12%) magically go up to 90.."
---
How do you get that to display on mobile? 
---
The thing is, Jagex still has to put those questions up for polling.

It‚Äôs harder for someone to invest serious time into skilling levels for a bot and risk a ban. Which is why I think we ultimately need to move more towards high requirement content like Priffindas. 
---
I mean, that's still inefficient time/money wise. Basically you're still wasting time (unless pet hunting which most don't do) because you could be doing something for more xp/money.
---
He also said at the start of the series "the account isn't very good so i'm going to transfer gear to train it up at some point".
---
The "from scratch" refers to "PKing a max pure sex ***from scratch***", again, anyone who watched the series would know that.
---
Don't let this distract you from completely losing your minds over a series that you haven't even watched though, just downvote and move on, wouldn't want to distract from your reddit REEEEEEEEEEEEE circlejerk.

He's training easier than poor people or real "from scratch" people.

Most people have to pay to train. He doesn't. He's literally getting an advantage every time he "lends himself" some stuff. How can you not see this?

You keep avoiding the actual questions and just saying "you've not seen the series" as if that means anything. Everyone KNOWS he's specified these rules, but they DO NOT make it "From scratch". How have you not picked up on this yet?!

What is this "personal gain"?

He just shits on people in his comments a lot and then posts it to Twitter.

However for new content and endgame I am in favour of more weapons and making certain monsters weak to certain weapons.

I wouls like to to see more diverse equipment weapons and armours for certain slayer monsters or slayer tasks instead of whip/canon/slayr helm everything.

You didn‚Äôt word it like a joke 
---
 Oh they arnt attached to my body, my ex girlfriend took them from me while we were dating, i just recently stole them back just to stuff them in your mouth for this occasion.
---
The major problem with this is abuse, any clan could use this to troll anyone using autochat. I would prefer if they just made a system to obtain pmod so more people could get it and keep the worlds clean. As of right now i pretty much only ever see them on 2k or 2.2k total worlds since they have likely been playing for years to get it.
---
Blowpipe has a significant upkeep cost, though. It doesn't just cost a few mill, it also costs 300k+ *per hour* to use.
---
People are putting too much focus on weapon level tiers recently imo. That's something that's only truly relevant in RS3. Pre-EoC level requirements have always been loose guidelines and IMO that's what makes OSRS somewhat unique: that level requirements aren't the real bottleneck to using certain gear but rather the price of the items.
---
Would you want the dragon claws to have a higher attack level requirement because they're a better spec weapon than the AGS?
---
Idk, I like weapons not having massively high level requirements. It allows the player to use them for a longer time before they max their stats and as long as they have mid-level stats and have the money, what's the harm in letting them use them?
---
In Australia cursing like that is pretty damn casual. He wasn‚Äôt swinging, he was just talking like normal. It‚Äôs everyone who doesn‚Äôt know diddly squat about him or the series that saw it out of context and decided to make it all into a big deal lol
---
42- THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT NUMBER
---
42- That's it! What's the question?
---
I agree on the higher total level requirement as for the regular content being polled. But if Jagex wants to bring out some new content based on a specific group of players why would other players interfere with the results if they don't use the content. In my opinion the players who actively use the content should decide. (If it only affects that specific content)
---
I didn‚Äôt know about it until the video either. But apparently there‚Äôs a spell that lets you transfer special attack meter to someone else. The guy was using an alt to perma-special attack by refilling his meter. 
---
Personally I'd rather them research the possible solutions before just jumping the gun.
---
Why does the community cry about Jagex doing things quickly and without being informed, but this must be done NOW! 
---
Also why does the community believe it is smarter on the subject than the people who literally have data that could suggest otherwise? Just all seems so silly to me.
---
Give them a little to analyze the data and if it comes back that hiding poll results will fix the issue, then sure that's perfectly fine. But as it is right now we don't have all the answers and it's better they don't make an uneducated decision. 
---
Trash tbh

Check the responses OP has been providing everyone and check what mod weath has said.   
---
Heres some of what Weath said  
---
&gt;After reading OP's first post, I looked at the account and noticed that, on the day that OP first appeared on the account:  
---
&gt;The login location moved 5,000 miles in 10 minutes  
---
&gt;A new email was set on the account  
---
&gt;A new password was set on the account
---
Here is what another user asked
---
&gt; I have believed you since your first post, but I have one question. You asked your brother to login to your account, why? You say you have your laptop with you in the U.K., why not do it yourself? 
---
Here is how brodaki responds
---
&gt; Is it even important? I was livid and on a call with him and others while i was opening the email seeing my account is back in my hands. Here I am, on discord on my phone and even though I know my bank is gone and my untradeables are probably dropped, there is a glimmer of hope or just some curiosity that I must know right now what is left on the account. So I told my brother to check. In retrospect, I could have opened my laptop and done it myself. Which I'm happy to do now, if that's to dispel any sort of rumor. Because it's a mystery to me why any of this is important to begin with. 
---
Yeah I only got 37 from the other :(
---
Why you do this
---

It‚Äôs has a nostalgic effect but honestly standing around and selling shit was a pain in the ass. I used used Zybez (might have that name wrong?) and the game functioned the same way as the GE but a little slower

I don't see a space, just says deleted.
---
If the account isn‚Äôt very secure it‚Äôs very possible to have your account hacked randomly. Happened to my original account. I got it back, but found it had traded hands multiple times and was permanently banned. Jagex said it would remain banned because the account was ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù to get stolen again.
---
That is a great a iincentive!  My agility is almost 87 and I wish for the squirrel on every rooftop.
---
Keep slaying that shit bro, the slayering never ends.
---
Yay! Any publicity is good publicity.
---
Log out forever.
---
Nothing on reddit makes me more mad then seeing a comment saying "Youre retarded if you get your account hijacked" or "Good, idiots like you deserve to lose your bank, its natural selection". Like OP already lost their account or bank (presumably) and then you gotta say that?!? And whats even worse is that the comments are actually upvoted! Ive never seen a sub in which so many uneededly toxic comments are praised.
---
I think that's just evscape, he is Australia's best pker afterall

Wonder what is droprate of thta skirt

I remember when the update first got released and on the newspost they listed the item stats in the newspost I was drooolingggg
---
How do they look underage?

I will now only see a bra

Is there some way of seeing a list of your login times? My account was banned for something I don't think I did and I am trying to figure out if my account was compromised.

Meanwhile Kodai wand gives +20 Mage defense because who knows why
---
No... the problem is a flawed polling system. That is literally what the complaints have been about.
---
That's because he edited the comment to remove the space after I commented. The bot then came and removed his comment and flared the thread.
---
Can't vote.
---
Need to see poll results to decide. 
---
Yes it impacts like 3000+ people.
---
I'm saying people won't be able to vote on super easyscape stuff if Jagex doesn't put it up for polls. I think they are smart enough to know what to poll and what not to poll. But we still need polls to show what players want, but Jagex is still the gatekeeper.

---
i think just like other skillcapes / quest cape, when a new skill comes out you shouldnt lose the max cape u just cant use it. Get 99 in the new skill and get ur cape back.
---
IF it doesn't work this way, ur idea is the correct solution if a new skill is added. 
---
Dangggg, ok thanks for the response 
---
i agree with the moron
---
I've also been collecting cabbages! Since the day OSRS was released.
---
It was quite slow going at first, I reached 300k before the release of the GE, partly by picking it myself, but mostly by hiring random noobs to pick them for me at 200gp per cabbage. One guy alone picked 110k cabbages for me. I still wonder if he botted it lol, but so long as someone delivers the cabbage I don't question where it comes from...
---
Been a lot easier since the GE came out though. I'm not rich so I just have to leave a low-ball offer in and wait for it to fill instead of paying through the roof to hit the 6k buy limit every 4 hours. If only though.
---
Anyhow, I'm probably about a month or two away from hitting my goal of 10M cabbages now!
---

---
Impossible. There are no documented cases of females being on runescape.
---
The firecape feature was actually removed for the exact reason you mentioned. The other stuff doesn't REALLY give you a huge unfair advantage though does it? 
---
The draw distance can be done via vanilla client I think now anyway, you can't interact with certain content beyond a certain distance away from you. 
---
The PVP thing, I don't think those are really issues like being able to see their HP or stats? 
---
It‚Äôs beautiful 
---
I‚Äôve ran underground pass off the top of my head as a one shot. Big boss fight at the end, several puzzles, underground dwarf npcs, ibans staff and klanks gauntlets as rewards 
---
It wasn't solid hours. Just an estimate. Sorry I can't give you the exact timestamps in microseconds. 
---
Imagine thinking that higher tier gear shouldn't have better bonuses...    
---
The fact that they were not only able to hack you but also ddos you shows they had all your information somehow. Not jagexs fault at all you somehow leaked all your info or got phised into getting a virus.
---
That's like discrediting settled for leaving mory for a saw and for doing ghosts ahoy
---
That is a great idea.   I have been hopping from roof to roof searching for the Squirrel.  My agility is 87 and no sign of the the little guy yet.  
---
There are 6058 maxed players and I figure if you're maxed there's probably a 50% chance you have infernal cape, and there's tons of non maxed people with them too.
---
I think there's definitely more than 3000 people with infernal cape I would be shocked to see proof showing otherwise.
---
I‚Äôve seen more people just go for an early B ring than people going for a ring of wealth and using that.
---
According to the RS support site, it looks like the old name will be reserved to your account for at least 35 days. More info here: https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206519409-Character-name-change
---
Very nice. Certainly would have been a great addition had the update come with a built in item sink to stabilize the supply and prevent stagnation in value.
---
&gt;tfw when you finish watching an entire movie and still have 543 laps until the next level.
---
wont happen though, they want to have jagex boost a niche item like twisted bow to tier 90 when in reality the stats for it are extremely low for tier 90 and would handicap the rest of the game when it comes to item progression for non niche items.  
---
Phew, read the comments but still wasn't prepared for her profile üòÖ
---
&gt;Just because it's not 100% bis doesn't mean its not great at plenty of things in the game, and using it doesn't cost nearly as much as it costs to use the bp.
---
I literally just told you that it's not great at "plenty of things in the game"... People who can sink 1.2b into an item won't bother doing shit gp/hr methods like Sara or Hydra. Efficiency wise it's ONLY great at the Inferno (one time content) and Raids 1. It's mediocre in ToB and the rest isn't worth it if you're rich enough to get a Tbow. 
---
This really isn't a hard concept to grasp. BP is OP because it's cheap and can be used in SO many scenarios, from high end pvm, to low end pvm and slayer; Tbow is not.
---
Even if they did look into it they will not return your items and by the time they look at the accounts that took your gold they will have already sold it off. The system they have at the moment does pretty much nothing to stop this.
---
Do not collect the reward from monkey madness.  A lot of returning players are forgetting it gives defence exp haha

  *  Gambit, Kieren, Ash, Wolf, Sween, Mat K, Bruno (chat).
---
2.  Sween and Mat K talk about recent blog and discussion on hot topics.
---
  *  Spoke to player support, there are 3 main questions/feedback. This time we have one big project, sentiment, each topic makes this up and we're looking at how we can address each one. For things like Authenticator delay and password strength there will be surveys to find out what players thoughts are and how that can addressed. Reiterating that of all of the issues raised this will be the hardest and work is under-way, we want the experts (player support) to talk to you. --- Lots of questions about toxic behavior, perhaps we want to know what players consider to be toxic... offensive language or is it people spamming at the GE? What do we want to address? --- When conversations continue and when player support starts getting involved there will be more information in the coming 3 blogs. --- The increase in visibility and communication will be a good thing.
---
3.  Contest winners.
---
  *  This wasn't included in the blog as it doesn't impact you in-game rather a very small number of players - it's still embarrassing and we want to address it. In the past the process of handling this was not managed well with no accountability, the budget-holder was in another department. In the future there should not be the same issues faced by previous winners - previous winners awaiting their prize should email oldschool community@jagex.com with their account name, contest and other information. 
---
4. Polling and hiding results.
---
  *  Lots of support for increasing accessibility and visibility, players had a bit of feedback on this and we want to look at options like making it accessible via button on game-frame or login screen messages. We don't want to force players to vote but do want to address this. 
---
5. Hiding poll results.
---
  *  We want to consider a number of things with the poll system, this included and restricting voting and seeing who is voting for what. Could polls act as a means of suggestion rather than being a yes/no, what is the fundamental purpose of the poll system etc? What solutions should be in place to ensure good representation and results. Is it working? Hiding the poll results wouldn't fix the polling system on the whole or make it achieve reach with a wider player base. We want players to care about voting and know that their vote counts.
---
6. Fixing old content in-game.
---
  *  It seems there is a difference between what 'we' (jagex team) see fixing content and what players actually want - QoL or larger reworks that are much larger projects that we invision.
---
7. Fixing PVP.
---
  *  In the past we've perhaps spoken to the wrong people and asked the wrong questions, having a confirmation bias by talking to the same people or not talking to the right ones. Perhaps asking a wider range of players, those that actively PVP or those that used to PVP but don't now, what do players want - more players to kill (resource gatherers) or more PVPers to fight? More QoL PVP things? Perhaps focusing on ways to draw people into the PVP scene is where we could be moving. 
---
8. Main Q&amp;A starts.
---
  *  Talk about the seed vault. Check  @jagexmaz on twitter for a preview picture, it's done development wise. Just waiting for QA to look through it, after DMM and hosidius and treasure trails etc, it's a few weeks away from being QA'd. Perhaps in 3-4 weeks we will see the seed vault. 
---
9. The OSRS team often get asked about what they want, what would each member NOT want in the game and why - points for not saying the obvious like EOC or MTX! 
---
  *  Sween: Daily Distractions, not a fan of feeling like having to go do a bit of content --- Wolf: Don't like the idea of health-boosting armour. --- Mat K: When summer's end was released and you have the light the 8 fires, if you died during this part they would go out and you'd have to start again. This was later changed so they didn't go out, wouldn't want to see this change again! --- Kieren: Same thing Sween said, Dailies like distractions. --- Ash: Avatars for clans that gave benefits for training in the area. Giving benefits like that wasn't something I want to see again. --- Gambit: Elite skills that require a minimum level in other skills to access another, prefer being able to work on any skill.
---
10. Have you considered opening Gertrude's Cat to F2P, it's a great small quest and cats area a great introduction pet.
---
  *  That's a cool idea, we could also give newer alternative content to F2P that give benefit? Generally like the idea of low level members content being opened to F2P where appropriate to give them a taste, we also discussed the agility skill in the past (perhaps an intro course or a level cap) to help give F2P a benefit and a small bit of that content.
---
11. Add things to the store to spend unidentified minerals on packs of clay or gems?
---
  *  Don't see why not, good idea to give them a use.
---
12. More unique diary teleports?
---
  *  Like graphics QoL and unique teleports yeah.
---
13. Crack the Clue 2 solved!
---
  *  Feels good to have it solved and great work everyone! In a few weeks maybe Mat K will have a stream showing how it's actually solved.
---
14. Can collection logs and boss logs be accessible via a menu rather than an item?
---
  *  Yeah it could be in a similar place to where the 'poll button' would be - it could be in many places like the diary/quest tab or the account tab. Would be a worthy thing to have in the interface.
---
15. Thoughts on buffing Keris dagger to be BIS against insect monsters?
---
  *  Could be nice yeah [not really an exact answer]
---
16. Chatting publicly on agility course, can we hear players on the other side of the course to make it a bit more social (upstairs, across the map etc).
---
  *  The engine lets us do it for an instanced area, but easily for a larger game world area and if you are going up and down levels it again would be harder.
---
17. [IMAGE] Different coloured max capes for ironman mode? 
---
  *  It does look cool! Strawpoll: 84% YES.
---
18. Are you guys going to address issues with bottomless compost bucket? Adding buckets individually gives you 2 charges but taking from a compost bin gives one charge. Also when using the bottomless compost bucket while the Attas plant is growing it seems to give fewer herbs.
---
  *  I thought the first thing was fixed? The second thing shouldn't be an issue at all and we have looked at the code and tested it further but still couldn't find it. If you can reproduce it please let us know exactly how! 
---
19. Can we have disease and yield rates and how it scales with level?
---
  *  They're all weird and complicated! We could give the rates and that would be good, perhaps the rates at various levels and you can interpolate as appropriate?
---
20. Any chance of bringing back Soul Wars and Stealing Creation with revamped rewards? Would that fit into OSRS and would the community want that?
---
  *  We had this discussion a few days ago! We looked at Stealing Creation and would have to do it significantly differently. With SC the gameplay had to be manipulated and done perfectly to get it done efficiently. The other issue is the rewards, if they aren't 'good enough' players probably won't play it and if they are good enough then the goal like above is to just play as efficiently as possible rather than to have fun. It's also hard to know how players would want to interact with the game these days rather than how they did back in the day. 
---
21. Can we get more player mods and an application system would be nice?
---
  *  Steve W: I agree that we could do with more Pmods in OSRS to help deal with scamming, phishing, games of chance etc that often plague areas of high-traffic like the GE. We currently have 1,641 player mods and 32% are in OSRS. We are actively carrying out checks now and there should be about 100 new Pmods in OSRS next week. All of our next recruits will be for OSRS until we have about 900 in total. --- We have looked at an application system in the past and didn't find it very effective. In a like for like comparison, we actually found more suitable candidates via random selection rather than from the application thread on the forums. If anyone wants to maximise their chances at being a Pmod, make sure your authenticator is enabled otherwise you won't make it to manual review! 
---
22. What are the challenges when it comes to creating art assets for OSRS, presumably you can't follow modern standards while fitting the OSRS aesthetic?
---
  *  The challenge when creating assets mainly comes down to the unique tools and way that the game is rendered. But on the flip-side these actually help reinforce our core art style by providing hard lines that we can't cross with our designs. I could write a whole essay on this but a challenge that we face on virtually every asset is working around the very low resolution vertex grid we have relative to modern games which can be seen when bits of geometry snap about during animations. This gives movement in OSRS a very distinct look that no other game replicates as far as I'm aware. We mainly take this into account when designing worn items and NPCs so that details and silhouettes aren't lost if some close proximity vertices move to different positions. This is less of an issue on props and environment models due to their static nature but it still enforces limits for example the level of detail and smoothness of curved surfaces that can't be created.
---
23. Have been nominated for EE Mobile game of the year! 
---
 * Please vote if you can, we're up against some strong competitors. Voting gives you a chance to win tickets to the rewards. You have to be a UK resident or have a UK phone number to vote.
---
Only so many niche items cam exist that aren't just upgrades before what ever you put out isnt just useless garbage
---
Needs an all-around nerf tbh
---
If they can do that without the EoC part I'd be on board.
---
Not blaming Jagex at all, but it is what is it. Would like it if they could do anything for me. Just hope someone sees the post.
---
What‚Äôs your combat stats and what‚Äôs your slayer level by chance?  Cause you can camp some monster for way more gp/hr than cannonballs lol. 
---
Well he showed the entire creating of the account through another video and was showcasing it in this series to pk in, it was severely underpowered for his combat bracket (14 str levels) and threw it in this series to show his viewers he was getting it to its full potential... I don‚Äôt understand how showing progress on an account you use in a series is a bad thing lmao 
---
I've seen the Venezuelan power outages caused bond prices to go up so much though
---
I like how her eyes are already closed, patiently awaiting the incoming ice barrage. I wish I could lose my spade with such zen. 
---
How much did you make off the zulrah scale update? 
---
Now you see? Now you see now? You know you fucked up right? 
---
Yeah I went about that much without one too, pretty sad feeling lol 
---
You won, he deleted everything. Gottem.
---
No he‚Äôs actually a 6‚Äô5 200IQ computer science major alpha male who can bench an elephant 
---
I don't think they expected him to level by pking. They probably just thought that the training would also only be done with resources from that account.
---
You don't give out any account info while buying gold tho
---
Good cosplay, great pics :D
---
Yeah, uh, I was asking Reddit to see if anybody knew for certain or had done it before.  "...at least 35 days.¬†After which it may be freed up." is pretty vague. There is zero certainty in it, except that it's a minimum of 35 days.
---
It'd be cool if using a weapon type vs a specific monster gave you increased damage against it.  Like if a specific being (demons maybe) were weak to maces, because they give prayer bonus.  Something along those lines. (Not saying to replace darklight as BIS, but maybe d mace &gt; d scim, even if just slightly).
---
There are many useless items in the game.  Torag hammers for example.  Another recent example is the hydra tail, useless item with such high reqs.
---
Whos to say they dont just make up the results anyway???
---
What are the complaints about Zulrah and NMZ?
---
Lol. "Trained data analysts." Trained data analysts are the ones that say you should hide poll results prior to participating in the poll because seeing the results before you vote skews how you vote.
---
For Karamja Elite, can‚Äôt you just use the Lunars spell NPC contact? Or is switching spellbooks too much of a pain?
---
I thought it rerolled hits over 50 to hit something between 45-50, and not just a 50 everytime, could be wrong though. 
---
Blowpipe being op was a good thing. Before the blowpipe it was all melee scape. The blowpipe made range useful, while being costly to use. Nowadays the blowpipe is a staple ranged weapon while there are still several other range weapons frequently used depending on the scenario.
---
They shouldn't do anything because either you leaked your info which is 100% on you or you rwted it and hope you can double up now. So you screwed up 1 way or the other and your bank is gone now.
---
What do you think is more likely one of those 2 or jagex had a huge security breach and all the hackers took was your info for a few mil?
---
Go for it. Play around with some of the new skills a bit and just jump into doing quests right away if you enjoy questing 
---
Double name change and its instant. 
---
Otherwise its like 30 days + an extra day for every week you had the name or some shit like that. 
---
that doesn't make sense.  if only 12% of the rs population is voting it would only take another 1% of the population to vote to either kill an update from passing, and another 9% to vote yes to have a vote pass using your 87/13 number.  The fact that such a small % of the community votes makes your one single vote mean even more, and you are not taking advantage of that and throwing it out because your mindset is lacking greatly.  You cant expect someone to hold your hands throughout your life, learning that now will help you mature and be a providing person to your community.
---
It‚Äôs 7$ bro lol
---
You do realise the point of the game is to play it? Why don't they just make Vorkath afk while they're at it? Fun for everyone!
---
maybe if theyd have done this like a long ass time ago instead of doing nothing like usual we wouldnt be sat here sharpening our pitchforks. people are tired of waiting for jamflex to get data and do fuck all with it
---
He made a dumb decision and committed to it, now is in denial of it being a dumb decision to protect his ego and this is the result.
---
Dude is a bitch basically is what I‚Äôm saying
---
Isnt the series called "Pure set from scratch"? The point being it is about pking to earn the cash for a pure set, he said nothing about the stats being from scratch
---
Delayed 1more day
---
Trying to rebrand a skill and failing to find a focus group is such a good concept and your interactions are funny, just had to be slowed down to see.  Don't sell your humor short.
---
I get what ya mean, though.  Might take some different editing techniques to find your zone.
---
Can we get this guy a freakin audio job jagex?  Geezas off the chain
---
&gt;People who can sink 1.2b into an item won't bother doing shit gp/hr methods like Sara or Hydra.
---
People who can sink 1.2b into an item will do whatever the fuck they want because its a game and they clearly aren't desperate for money. I've seen tbows at Cerb. I've seen tbows at demonic gorillas. I've seen scythes AND Sanguinesti staves at dks. And I don't know what rock you're living under, because I've seen more tbows at GWD than anywhere else in the game past raids.
---
Stylus OP 
---
Not the guy you replied to, but i once fell for one in another game.
---
My friends account was hacked and he messaged me saying he saw my video and thought it was cool, i asked what video and he sent me a link that was slightly off the games official forum url, swapped a o for a 0 or something. It loaded up a forum that was identical looking to the official one and a video embedded. When i tried to play the video it prompted a login. The second i hit submit i saw my character logout on the other screen.
---
I was lucky in that i had a macro set up to login so i was able to contest the login over and over logging out the hacker while i reset my password.
---
What can they do? Idiots will always find a way to get hacked. 
---
Yeah well that‚Äôs how it is. There‚Äôs a good portion of the community that don‚Äôt want it. It needs to pass a 75% threshold and it failed. Twice. 
---
Pretty sure I got the idea from you
---
Was watching live and I figured someone would clip and post immediately for the fake internet points.  
---
complaining about agility in 2019 when we have vertical camera and screen markers is silly. agility is not even bad when you have a cheat client lol, you don't ever need to change camera angle and all your clicks are mapped out.
---
it's an afk skill now tbh. just watch a show on the side, you can turn your brain 100% off doing seers course with runelite.
---
Some tasks I need to high alch/barrage on, but yeah thats a good suggestion, will have to look into it.
---
MSBI with rune arrows until you can get broad bolts, shouldn't take long at all.
---
I casually play a restricted Ironman myself for the fun of it and for sure I made some exceptions that would actually allow me to have fun . No way in hell I‚Äôm waiting 17 months for a cooking level so that I can churn butter , no thank you.
---
Meet Deanlectics, my developmentally-locked ultimate autistman. After running out of content to repost on Reddit, I decided to up the ante and forge my own content from scratch.
---
Anyone else find it hilarious someone complaining about a series/video starts off their complaint with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt watch this series‚Äù 
---
Wow! So glad you managed you keep your items safe
---
Yeh that's what I'm doing which is why the pickpocket cancels his attack I think? 
---
whether you think you amd everyone else is being influenced or not, you are and thats the point
---
yes you can absolutely, nobody is *required* to pay clans to protect them. but it's the wildy and people can kill you, so there's that.
---
If you want to get someone that job, go check out the guy who made the music. The link to his video is in the description of mine
