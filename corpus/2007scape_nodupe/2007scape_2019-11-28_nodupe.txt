They did respond to him and they detected it themselves?

---
Seriously jagex did nothing wrong here
---
Yeah I don't think the community would handle that very well
---
You mean like rendi did?
---
&gt;The word 'dupe' should not have been censored. You might be able to argue that discussion of how it happens should be deleted, but making people aware that there is an active game breaking bug should not be censored.
---
The actual thread that Rendi used to show that "dupe" was being censored has the word dupe in it several times, alongside the person typing it out as if it were auto-censored which I highly doubt. He could of just used Ctrl+F to find this but making it look like some grand conspiracy is far more engaging I guess. Thread:

Exactly. I see ironman killing Corp I run in and take their kill :) 
---
Love ruining people’s time spent in game
---
I’ve been doing that a bit since I was training my combat, however it just gets tedious fighting the same hard-to-reach monsters over and over so I took a break. Once I’ve gotten enough points to get some of those cool perks it’ll be better but atm I’m just not looking forward to killing 100+ hellhounds again lol

Please don't call them admins, they're moderators. Admins are the pinnacle of Reddit staff and are paid by Reddit to handle the site. Moderators are self-appointed users who monitor specific subreddits, they have little control outside of the subs they manage. It's kind of like a player mod vs a Jagex mod, the player mod might be able to mute and report players in game but Jagex mods are essentially god.
---
Tbf he had direct contact with people who were just one forced crash away from doubling the amount of gold in the entire game. If jagex couldn't prevent the preceeding 1.10e^11 billion event, they sure as fuck weren't going to prevent the 10 trillion one without rendi spamming them. That's why I think the hatejerk rendi is getting is unfair, had he kept silent we would have had to endure a total rollback and lose days of progress. The video could have been made less sensational, but that alone doesn't deserve him getting all this hate. Imagine if he didn't flag jagex down and later disclosed that he was aware of the bug, we would probably all be upset.
---
It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't type of situation. But at the same time this community has the worst community when it comes to rational thinking and mob mentality. Yall are dramaqueens
---
I know, I censor words myself for comedic effect.

Wtf this guy do to you hahah

48k after tax is a lot more than 48k. In Aus I'd guess it's around 70k which is not bad.

His grammar was perfectly fine, you're just an idiot

2) buy bonds

5) Buy even more smokes

Yeah, once you unlock slayer helm, ring crafting, bigger &amp; badder, etc. slayer is a lot more better.
---
Fair enough tbh
---
Hmmm. The way bot clients used to work, you could open literally hundreds of bots at once on a computer that could only support maybe 10 actual accounts. The bot clients would render things differently to where it uses very minimal resources. I ran like 40 bots one time on a stock intel Pentium back in like 2008. If that thing could run 40 bots, I couldn't imagine how many my computer can run right now lol.
---
But I do see what you are saying, my guess is that the 2 people ran at least 900 bots each and I'm sure bots now days have multiple vpn connections so you dont risk banning a main account while botting, thus changing the login connections. Still, that's like 500 vpns or else you still have 4 and 5 connections from the same location which doesnt seem reasonable imo.
---
Lastly, even so, an ftp world jumping up to 2k players from where it was should have alerted them in general. Why would a world go from 300-400 players to 2k players that quick? Jagex must have been sleeping.
---
Not really, you don't want the information of working but exploits being spread openly as that they want others to attempt it themselves.
---
anyone got a clip?
---
This happened to me. I stopped playing for a few years and when I came back, turns out the account had gotten hacked, botted on, and banned. I tried the appeal option expecting nothing in return but they actually did unban me.
---
This is not the same. This was developed by an old Jagex employee colluding with the bug abusers.
---
Wait until he gets promoted to “sales engineer”, that’ll show mom.

it doesn't just become expensive, it's expensive right away, 80$ for a night of drugs ? fuck that shit

I'd have loved the plot twist of him actually getting the cape like those 16-17cb fire capes that happened recently.
---
I still buy my bonds in pesos.
---
So do percs
---
&gt;sn’t seem to cover any of the other interactions that occurred between him and the JMods in the server in which we did quickly acknowledge his tip-offs and did 
---
Actually that's not true at all, unless it is written very poorly an NDA covers anything you know that you ordinarily wouldn't. As it turns out, except for spills prior to signing, it includes anything you have learned past present and future, and is usually enforceable for one year past the date of signature (due to relevancy) unless specifically stated otherwise, and that otherwise specific usually has to be spelled out, not just general info.
---
Your rent is only $350? Damn that's a good deal.
---
I would if i could afford one. And tbh I'm burned on vork, been camping him since i had to rebuild
---
Oh, it's not suppose to look like that?
---
I just think there is nothing Jagex will be able to do.  The amount of RWT and botting for RWT is insane.  The only true way to fix this is just to sell gp from the rs website.  Sure it will destroy the economy but who cares, RWT and botting would be fixed!   
---
Ironman BTW
---
Glad people in this thread are starting to realise that Rendi's video was just a huge attention grabbing effort. Acting like he's some god-given savior of the osrs community like dupes have never happened before. And then when Jagex haven't done anything to him and are just trying to control the situation he sets himself up as a martyr and says nah fuck you I need the publicity thanks.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Sounds like your email is compromised. You need to put 2FA(Two factor authentication) on your email account + change email password + set/change recovery questions. Then setup authentication again on runescape and change your runescape password. I think this is generally it when it comes to securing your account.
---
(Make sure both emails have 2FA and are secured btw)
---
Another good precaution is to have an antivirus software and to make sure your computer is not infected. Malwarebytes (Premium) is a pretty good one. Real-time protection for everything (with premium). Can get a trial members version for 2 weeks without credit card.
---
Thank you!
---
Not really. Im pretty mediocre.
---
But I'm someone who has dealt with, and continues to deal with addiction.
---
 I also know that when somebody reached out to me, it led me to reexamine how I treated my body and lived my life. So if anyone needs help, I would love for them to get in contact with me so I can keep the cycle going.
---
Heaven
---
Like adding an infinite tbow spawn? Or the infinite gold from pvp that took like an hour max to find? I understand deep bugs that changing one thing changes something else 100x unrelated, but some of the bugs are pretty surface level
---
It’s like all those people who saw that allegation on the “People whose NDAs expired what stories do you have?” And someone said everyone there is all on coke.
---
Like it makes for a funny story but forgive me if I don’t buy a single reddit comment as concrete authority
---
Well, i don’t think it’s entirely common knowledge that you need a house before you can get con exp from wt. so without knowing that, the post might not make a whole lot of sense
---
first of all I do not calculate slayer with max xp rates, since this is unreasonable to keep up. 60k is not hard to keep up. i dont know where you get these 300 hours for slayer from, but it is way to long if you do duradel. 
---
Yet again you are showing me a calculation where we have no clue what kind of tasks for slayer was done and how much xp you get there per hour. So this beautiful graph may be right on paper, but it neglects a few things, which are actually crucial in THIS case. 
---
Its funny how you say to me , that I am bias with my "max efficiency playing" , but yet again you show me this. :P
---
These 300 hours are only possible if you have between 45k-50k xp per hour on average....
---
Wait what happened with gold glitching?

Isn't it Mod Gee's birthday as well?

Moved to NJ from NYC and my motorcycle insurance dropped from 32 bonds a month to 6.

I would invest in real bonds that way your fake bond purchasing power increases .....after a year you may increase your 8.5 m/hr to say 30m/hr all counting that your investment in real bonds multiplies by 9% and the inflation in fake bonds increases to 10m each risky move but scared money dont make money your choice

LMFAO you're now at 98 comments about rendi. 
---
 
---
Mental breakdown much? And you're going to try and call me out for insulting you? Let's look at your comments.
---
No
---
\&gt; Anyways, yeah, the rollback system has been known to dupe items since the Twisted Bow spawn happened. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF5oS5sMzU8) a vid by Michael RS showing it off. The only new information that came from Rendi was the two people who were actually crashing the server, but even then that wasn't Rendi alone who found them, he had a whole clan chat helping him. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I love how you've now accused Jagex of being unable to patch a glitch that's been known for a year, causing servers to crash.  When you defend Jagex so hard you end up condemning them.
---
\&gt; I'm not gonna stop you 
---
You're gonna bitch about to all high hell instead
---
\&gt; but his video came across as insanely egotistical.  
---
Ding ding ding - the actual reason you're mad.  He hurt your feefees.  You don't actually have any proof about anything, but you not liking him is proof to your clown ass
---
\&gt; He didn't do anything to save the game 
---
Again, if he didn't do anything, you wouldn't be here insisting for comment upon comment that he didn't do anything.  You're kinda proving he's done everything he's needed to do.
---
Gmaul is +81 crush. This adds 32 crush
---
ill do the percent increase for you

(32/81)x100=39.5% base increase in likelyhood your gmaul will hit.

Posts like this actually getting upvoted is depressing.
---
Fucking ironmemes
---
they had a year and a half to come up with that patch, only got themselves to blame if this is the case
---
You've claimed I'm not worth talking to yet you're still sitting here messaging me.
---
How are you even typing with your foot this far up your mouth?
---
You absolutely can be sued for sharing company information even if you don't sign something. Pokemon right now is suing some people for leaking information of the official pokemon guidebook for Sword/Shield and those people didn't sign anything. The way they are using it for the Content Creators is if they release any information regarding this bug/exploit it could cause more harm to the game in which they would be liable.
---
Because gear progression and appropriate level requirements are an important part of the game.
---
You don't just see all the armour stacked into one defence level / requirement. As your levels go up, the access to more powerful gear happens. Shouldn't just soft cap at 75 due to fear of powercreep while simultaneously releasing more and more powerful gear on that tier.
---
Tony Hawk pro Scaper
---
The problem is the way Rendi is painting the picture. He discovered the problem and notified Jagex. That was the right thing to do.
---
This video, however, is painting the picture of a grand conspiracy to cover up this dupe when, in reality, no actual censorship is going on.
---
An NDA is not censorship. The sole purpose of an NDA is to prevent information from being spread outside of people "in the know" from getting into the public and, more importantly, you cannot legally be forced into an NDA.
---
Mod Bolton's comment as shown in Rendi's video stated he wanted people within the discord to sign NDAs because he was afraid that discord channel was not confidential. This is normal because they were discussing an ongoing bug with the potential to destroy the game and the less people who knew about it existing before it was 100% fully dealt with, the better. He basically was unwilling to speak about it much more unless people were willing to keep the conversation confidential, which is the right thing to do.
---
Remember, this is a potential item duplication glitch that relies on servers crashing - that has a million ramifications that may take months of engine work to fully fix. It is very much possible Jagex has not yet worked out all the kinks and Rendi's video about the bug may actually be harming Jagex's ability to fight by putting more people "in the know."
---
This crashing and resetting bug may very well have other interactions that could break the game and the more devious minds with devious intentions apply themselves to a singular cause, the more likely it is they will find a separate breaking point - perhaps one Rendi wouldn't be informed of.
---
This would be super cool, and would allow for so much development of new metas beyond what you find in twisted league where a lot of them are already known ironman methods.
---
Don't you want games to start or not
---
Dont you think it's basically impossible to diagnose that kind of thing over the internet, based off of a few reddit comments? Also, doesnt it seem unlikely that so many people you encounter would have the same problem? You might be misdiagnosing these people if you're going into conversations looking for signs that would potentially indicate they have maladaptive perfectionism. 
---
Not saying you're necessarily wrong, just some observations based on the limited context I have.
---
How the fuck is saying that they can't give out specific details to random content creators when they're not under NDA a threat? Seriously, what rendi claimed was 100% bullshit, this is the exact quote from Bolton to the discord channel:
---
&gt; we can't trust that things said in this channel are confidencial, we'll have to move all feedback to private channels until we get everyone NDA'd
---
THAT IS NOT A FUCKING THREAT. It's an explanation why they're not going to share private details to people who'd then be 100% legally free to publish all of that in a video...
---
Cause then his content wouldn't be as interesting.
---
You choose to be a 75 attack account. Sorry but that isn't a reason to make high level gear not be appropriately levelled. In fact your example is exactly why it's important to properly space content and gear out in appropriate tiers.
---
I'm not talking to you, I'm **EXPOSING** you, because I am a true hero.
---
Not being disproportionate for one, maybe subtle wasnt the right word (not a native speaker) but it reminds me of the barrows weapons
---
Wait you can actually buy bonds with money and sell them for GP? As in, you can real world trade directly through JAGEX themselves?
---
It’s been going well because we don’t just let them “do their job”. Do we need to pull out the runescape history books again as proof of what happens when you let them do as they please?
---
First post. "It's a big deal for ironman too".
---
Silly bondies always backtracking.
---
If I'm here for attention why are you giving me more?  You're doing an awful job of showing you're not mad.  You should try not being mad.  Being mad is bad for your mental health.  
---
\&gt; Call me names, get mad, them storm away.  
---
I've literally sat and explained everything to everyone until they were done.  I don't think I've walked away once today laddie.  
---
\&gt; You're just helping my argument 
---
What argument? You're just off your rocker salty continually replying to someone you claim you shouldn't be talking to.  Pathetic lmao.
---
Blowpipe as 75 makes sense to me. Afterall MSB is bloody 50. Karils crossbow is 70. So t75 for blowpipe makes sense.
---
Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to have blowpipe and tbow on an identical tier tho.
---
What do you mean finally? You went slightly over the droprate.
---
\&gt; I'm **EXPOSING** you, because I am a true hero.

Yeah alright, I think you've shown how much of a clown you are.  Go ahead, dance for me, but at this point I'm just going to watch.
---
Loosen the tinfoil a hat a bit please. Yes, dupes have been happening for the last 20 years, they get caught, they get countered. THIS bug, while possible for an extended period of time, has not been being abused for "months at least", because it literally requires crashing servers, which is a massive fucking deal. That's not something Jagex doesn't notice, or would leave til monday. People crashing servers and fucking with save states is fucking emergency level shit that needs to be handled ASAP.
---
Ah how times have changed
---
This is fun. I like you, you're a loser and spinning your wheels. You've made over 100 comments about this. It's pathetic. I feel like a cat, batting around a small bug that's half alive. 
---
Stay salty, 100 comment downvote machine
---
I was actually thinking about grinding barrows to get money for the cannon and then training smithing to make cannonballs since I need smithing exp anyway

For f keys you'll want something like this: F1 invo, F2 prayer, F3 spell book, F4 combat styles/spec.

Fixed screen vs resizable doesn't do much but fixed gives better fps

If you don't already know about combo eating that would be useful to learn

---
Well that's where the problem started. That shit is rarely not absolute shit.
---
Botters already knew about this class of exploits being possible.  Nothing new was learned by anyone seriously trying to break the game and nobody who wasn't already trying to abuse it has the capability to generate packet-only bots at scale.
---
Mine is 0 ;o
---
Lol not even going to click any link you send me, I'm not *that* dumb.
---
Have fun being EXPOSED. God damn, I am so good. Rendi could learn a couple things from me.
---
Osrs community and jagex: "bot detection is flawless," 
---
"you obviously botted kiddo"
---
"you cant appeal"
---
 "waiting for jmod smackdown in comments"
---
3 microseconds later after getting 5k updoots on a subreddit. 
---
"Sorry we false flagged your account for *insert normal thing people do on the game*"
---
Authenticator should fix that and a password change
---
no, Jagex bad rendi god
---
Ahh, you're going to more personal insults. I like it. Your incivility hurts your argument.
---
Keep dancing for me.  After your last comment I really think you're either mentally ill or a great shitposter.  At this point anything I'd say would be not nearly as bad for you than just you continuing to be you.
---
You can't "take their kill" because irons get their own instance, so you wouldn't see them to be able to take their kill. 8) 
---
Bad comparison either way
---
Chief, I want you to know that I respect your opinion on this matter. This meme isn't for everyone, but a sizeable portion of this community greatly enjoys it and the wholesome commentary that comes with it. In a way it's the equal opposite force to counter the brainlet memes that so dominated this forum for years. Thank you once again for expressing your opinion, and best of luck with 99 fishing.
---
*good
---
It's not that I don't think people are capable of lying about this sort of thing, but based on what we know about his character as I said I see no reason as to why he'd lie about it *outright*. I can believe that he may misrepresent things, which is why I've bee throwing caution and not taking his word for it without giving Jagex a fair hearing.
---
Keep dancing for me. After your last comment I really think you're either mentally ill or a great shitposter. At this point anything I'd say would be not nearly as bad for you than just you continuing to be you.

Oooo gotcha was thinking the opposite.  But regardless I still think if it were to happen the game would not go away.  People would quit, not everyone but a lot.  But who knows what would/could happen.
---
Yes it is recommended. Best way to get him in order is karamja elite diary gloves, karamja hard diary gloves, and then brimhavin cart to shilo.
---
Keep dancing for me clown.

I looked at the screenshots, it looks like they might have been referring to NDA for Jmods?
---
Keep dancing.
---
Yeah, he's a true hero. Hatesranged is literally at over 100 comments getting all salty about his hero
---
It /is/ a big deal that the /could/ have been ruined. Also I don’t buy bonds. I support the developers with my $11/mo
---
Rent free
---
:(
---
Well, that's part of it - this bug isn't fixed. Jagex slapped a band-aid on that prevents crashes in the same way - this particular method was hit, but the root problem still exists.
---
Sounds more dramatic than it is, but it's likely that even more people are attempting to discover methods now that it's known to be possible.
---
Yep, the fact that he is a known man child should put down any idealization this sub has about him. He’s not a hero for making public a shitty bug and claiming he discovered it.
---
Test
---
Mines 155 bonds lol, i hate myself
---
Yeah but if you prefer them to try hard the entire time just let me know
---
Wat
---
Aww, the dance is over.

MOMMY HE CALLED MY WACK ARGUMENT WACK AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
\&gt; Stay poor.
---
Bwana there's even odds I have a bigger bank than you and I haven't made money in months because fuck moneyscape lmao
---
Since Jagex and players knew about it, and Jagex were able to (appearently, since they now have) fix it - without actually doing so - it's clear to me that Jagex have, at the very least, taken lightly on game integrity in this case. This bug was severe enough to warrant limitless effort. 
---
Foil hat: this should in turn raise questions regarding the twisted bow spawn and the max cash glitch, which both resulted in rollbacks. 
---
Especially the max cash glitch is interesting, since it occured in July 2018 - after this post, and just over a month before the firing of Mod J\*d.
---
It's statistically unlikely just based on playerbase age and average unemployment rate
---
You and me both, my dude.

Jesus mate don't hold it down you'll get banned

---
So it's Nbd and everybody is going nuts over nothing,
---
Cool.
---
Yeah, buy, train to 99 str, sell
---
This is fucking hilarious
---
Weird considering you post to top minds? Does this sub attract dipshit psuedo intellectuals too?
---
I think you're just exaggerating your point because you're annoyed other people don't care as they're unaffected lmao. You've back tracked on "It does effect you" and "It's not a slippery slope claim".
---
Anyway, I think I've proven my point. Christmas bonds specials are just around the corner so you can probably treat yourself to some 3a soon, bondie lmao
---
It’s roughly 20 Xp average per cannonball on low def monsters so divide that by the xp for 75 range and you have your answer or close
---
The Human Resources part of me is literally fucking fuming right now I feel like Torvesta getting smited for 1b like I'm literally genuinely upset.
---
In that one discord message Mod Bolton said in this video he explicitly fucking says he's afraid the discord isn't confidential and he wants NDAs. That's a fucking reasonable thing to ask for when you're LITERALLY DISCUSSING SOMETHING WITH EVEN THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBILITY OF DESTROYING THE ENTIRE FUCKING GAME. And, you know what Rendi does? HE FUCKING REFUSES TO SIGN THE NDA. Fine, his right to refuse.
---
Then, THEN HE FUCKING MAKES THIS VIDEO WHERE HE'S THROWING A HISSYFIT BECAUSE JAGEX STOPPED DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO SIGN THE NDA LIKE HOLY FUCKING SHIT. MOD BOLTON WAS OFFERING A WAY TO DISCUSS IT FURTHER AND YOU SPIT ON IT, SO WHY THE FUCK DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO DISCUSS IT FURTHER JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.
---
And, the beautiful part in all this. Mod Bolton added Rendi on discord to discuss it further. If you don't know what this means, it means Mod Bolton actually had to get permission from some shitass manager or another at Jagex to give Rendi special fucking permissions to discuss it further without an NDA... AND EVERYONE IN THIS FUCKING COMMENTS SECTION IS SHITTING ON MOD BOLTON DESPITE ALL THE HOOPS HE'S GOING THROUGH FOR RENDI. WHAT THE FUCK.
---
Outliers exist
---
It's trending in Australia. Jagex must love that.
---
I mean people are literally saying how dare he expose the fact that this exists, so no it's definitely why for a lot of people.  Also:
---
**Before Rendi's video:**
---
* People knew a money duplication glitch was happening but had no clue how bad or if it was under control
---
* People were randomly unable to login or play and f2p worlds were crash bombed repeatedly and no one knew why
---
* It was impossible to discuss the glitch or the surrounding events on reddit so no one could ascertain anything
---
* The lack of concrete facts was causing more and more outlandish misconceptions to spread about the situation
---
**After Rendi's video:**
---
* People know what happened and when it happened, as well as most relevant details
---
* People know what Jagex did and are planning to do about it
---
* People know that the situation is stable
---
* It is possible to discuss the events freely and transparently over reddit, and most misconceptions are cleared up
---
* Literally no damage was done to game integrity
---
How can you possibly claim Rendi's video wasn't a positive moment?
---
You missed the step where Rendi was the one who made a video laying the foundational workings on how the bug works, and the step where he was having discussions with the guys who were working on the dupe.
---
Rendi is someone who works to bug and exploit the game quite often, though not to my knowledge for malicious intent. That second part is very important, but the community that works on and theorycrafts all these bugs and abuses of game mechanics includes many bad actors. It is, in my opinion the absolute responsibility of all the people in that community to use extreme discretion, and to realise ahead of time things that could be used for extreme negatively impactful purposes, and keep Jagex promptly informed about such things. Rendi did not do that. He did not alert Jagex until after these guys were crashing servers and trying to dupe gold. Then made another video explaining the detailed dupe process before all underlying problems were fixed. As such I believe Rendi carries a lot of blame here.
---
I recently feel OSRS is especially dead and empty with no other players around.  
---
Or is that because everyone is in TL?
---
Thanks man. Im just hoping a jmod will actually look into this because it is just sad how this turned out.
---
Yup he definitely leaked the entire lower the better series for a couple thousand views.

You can disagree or agree with him and his actions, it doesn't matter. Making incredibly stupid comments like that just causes everyone to tune you out for being an idiot though.
---
Because blowpipe is a bit better than karils, and it's higher level? Tbow is better than blowpipe so should be higher level than that. I don't get what your complaint is? Blowpipe is higher req than karils.
---
\&gt; Human Resources 
---
Ah, the people in charge of lying on the company's behalf and covering their asses (that last one is literally your job description and you know it).  Thank you for identifying your opinion as biased and morally bankrupt.  Good day.
---
&gt; Because they're weak-minded individuals who have to compensate their insecurities by rallying against someone
---
literally what's happening in this thread with anyone bitching about twitch. It's funny as hell.
---
Some members go extremely hard check out 07 gone wild
---
Think about it, if 2 entire worlds were complete bot farms for a day straight then what does that say about the actual player count of the game?
---
"Bro here's your powerleveled Account back. Even got you some DEF lvls for free. Don't even have to thank me."
---
That your choice but Reddit was made to share opinions essentially 👍
---
jagex pls rollback to the point right before I chose my 2nd relic.
---
At least let me get broader fletching first...
---
Bump
---
Something going on uber this game's spaghetti code is increasing your odds of pets. Overwise the odds are just astronomical
---
So you got 1 in 360k **twice** within the space of 5 minutes and now this?
---
What's even the chances of getting a farming pet?
---
I do. Balance and integrity is more important than a specific build demanding they be continually able to use gear above their power. 
---
Now if they were like "lol Gmaul is 70 att now". Yeh I'd be with you that that's ridiculous. But this isn't so.
---
It's happened in path of exile a bit ago as well.
---
They redid their networking so that the server is sent your inventory every time you do something that could like generate value.
---
You’re a man of culture I see
---
Yeh a selection of PvP builds not being able to use a BiS PvM weapon will be the cause of it to crash...
---
Oh lawd I can see it now.
---
"Sorry guys swamplady doesn't like me playing 15 hours a day so I'm just going to create a regular Ironman, non region locked so I can play more casual. That's cool right guys?"
---
**Shiver**
---
I dont know much about the Jagex staff but didn't Rendi say that it was done at a time when no staff were online, and he used other means to contact jmods to get online?
---
I think Jagex would have known too had they been online, of course. But if it was at some strange hour and no one was online then its possible they didnt know. That doesn't mean they owe him anything. I've reported bug abuse in the past and that doesn't make me a saint who deserves a statement from jagex.
---
No offence mate but keeping in mind the decisions and actions jagex has taken for previous problems(mainly lies) I wouldn’t just eat up anything sween says
---
The number of pures and zerks that actually do ToB are pathetically low compared to any other account. Stop exaggerating
---
Just did some quick maths and if I did an extra overtime shift at work twice a week I'd have enough for max melee gear by Christmas.
---
for functional ones I agree, there should have only been infernal, vork and ma2.
---
as for plain recolors I think there should be more. with these limited time modes you could reward people with unique cool cosmetics to show off their achivments. I think twisted could be a cool start and if they bring back dmm is like to see one from there.
---
and just so it's clear I'm not maxed in osrs, I just think itwould be a cool idea
---
Bp is miles better than karil, much more than 5 levels imo. But beside that, bp in context with the other lvl 75 items doesn't make much sense to me.
---
Prayer.
---
You unlock it through a prayer scroll, costs about 50M
---
it increase your ranged DPS by quite a margine.
---
You can go in welfare gear with rigour and out DPS a max ranged build without rigour.
---
Wiki has a long list of moneymaking methods, don't reuse your emails and use a unique one for runescape.
---
If I had to walk uphill both ways to school you all have to aswell! Kids nowadays smh my head &gt;:(
---
Cleaning cloths don't work on it?
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I think the only real difference is that HC have to play safer i mean even if i do die on this ill still continue it as a regular iron
---
&gt; They were already in the process of doing the same thing if it wasnt for that meddling rendi.
---
you added this part after i made my comment
---
Either way, whats inherently wrong with not disclosing a patched bug?
---
They've already expressed that they want the negative side effects of relics to be carefully considered as well, and do not wish to make them able to be toggled.
---
i downloaded a 3rd party youtube client on my phone a while back that has since been removed from the app store but i still have it on my phone and it's so wonderful being able to watch youtube with non-intrusive ads. i can also minimize the app and turn off the screen without stopping the video. fuck youtube
---
Wait, which one do you need for the clue?
---
it also happens with every server update when the servers are crashed by jagex themselves..
---
An NDA isn't a threat. It's a legally binding contract that states the person will be responsible for confidential information and that legal action can be taken against them if they are discovered to break their NDA.
---
It's the legal equivalent of, "I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you."
---
Basically, because the jmod signed an NDA to work at Jagex, they can't share information with someone unless that person is also legally held responsible for that information.
---
It makes sense in this situation to ask for an NDA because a major duping glitch is a severe threat to the game and spreading knowledge that the dupe even exists risks evil people with evil intentions finding even more exclusive exploits.
---
Okay gl on that goal, I would get obby set and berserker necklace instead.
---
That sounds like a sophisticated title! I’m not being sarcastic either lol
---
What actually happened with the whole Bernie thing though? Since it's all over your post history and stuff.
---
A server being reset is not the same thing as a server being crashed.
---
Exactly man. The game mode is what you make of it. If you want to stop thinking about max gp/hr and just explore all different parts of RuneScape content I'd say definitely give it a go.
---
You get like 40 snapdragon seeds on the way to 99 if you average 750 or so points per game. Very good for post max content
---
Rune Helm (h[1-5])
---
Not the one that specifically matches text word for word
---
post max content eh
---
Bonds would be a great investment against I.clarion if it warmth for that resale fee.
---
Own a MMO, customer buys a subscription, ban them right away = free money without having to provide the service paid for.
---
This is an example of why we can't just passively accept game companies having the right to revoke access at any point without reason. Obviously they need to be able to ban people who break the rules and ruin the game for others, someone paying money doesn't make them above the rules, but it does mean that if they want to revoke access after the customer has paid, they *must* have a very good reason to do so, with 100% certainty.
---
Got mine very luckily at 23.7mil xp from a Calquat tree. Was doing any possible farm run. Don't do any tree runs anymore but I still think it's a fantastic skill
---
well thats neither here nor there. i just did the math and 800 daganoths yields on average 1 torstol and 5 snapdragon seeds. cannoning daganoths is liek 400 kills per hour probably more so you should get about 180k per hour in snaps/torstols and then a little extra from gems and the snape grass seeds. maybe you trained there for a bit and got unlucky. i trained there for like 7m exp and was pretty well getting the numbers i just laid out to you. about 200k loot per hour
---
Except theres a subtle difference you are missing.  Here's the real scenario that happened:
---
I am a customer of apple and find a bug in their software.  I warn people of the bug as it ruins the integrity of apples product.  An employee from Apple tells me that I can not discuss this feedback with other customers because i havent signed an NDA.  I now sit here confused, why can i not warn people about a faulty product, if I do what is the repercussions.  
---
The moderator didnt say in his 340 statement that he couldnt dicuss details about it without everyone ndad, rather he said "we" (as in anyone discussing this currently) can not talk about it without an nda
---
op acts like he isnt echoing 90% of the sub and that jared was quick to patch the exploit (even tho it was first brought to their attention in may 2018)
---
Thank you for what you’re doing for our country
---
I did him a favor! In fact, he should be thanking me! WOW
---
Lol people with car loans
---
Over 110B gold was duplicated last week due to a major bug. Rendi's newest youtube video explains it nicely
---
I also found the number of bots availabe for such few people alarming. 
---
As an ironman I love feeling safe from possible gp crashes.
---
Jagex does seem unprofessional but I'm also partly convinced that they're not certain if there are still related loopholes and maybe they dont want a lot of people trying to find any.
---
I was exited for a second there then I saw how much that still is.
---
still way more than I'm willing to spend on fashionscape
---
Good to know, did not know that.
---
Love me a golf R! Got a GTI over here.
---
Don't forget buying the pots, just as aids as buying the balls of wool which is nearly as aids as the rest of its creation.

Which country tho?
---
Hi Kevin
---
Why do you have such high standards for twitch chat?
---
I see I was not needed here. Good day to you, sir.
---
It happens often to those with a level 1 screenshot skill, try leveling that next time your in game. 
---
But in seriousness, it’s a known error with no workaround.
---
Someone is likely trying to bruteforce your password. Should be fine if you have 2fa even if they know your pass.
---
I'd sell the anguish to afford a crossbow and just camp fury
---
Common practice would dictate that you do format your drive after getting a virus that can possibly mess with your personal information. Don't forget to change ALL the important passwords and even change credit card if You have entered it's details into the pc. Do the changing AFTER a clean install of the operating system.
---
And yes, I am serious. These things are no joke.
---
You’re gonna get hit by a frozen poop piece from space and die.  It only makes sense with those odds
---
Are that many people buying gold?
---
Great suggestion, they could make the enchant have charges where a new tomb must be used to cast another buff on the item, or maybe have the item become unusable unless it's charged so you're going to have to sacrifice availability of the item for the damage buff. The item can go "dorment" when the charges hit 0 and have to be enhanced again to continue use
---
Some of the gold sites have put out metrics in the lower 7 figures annually.
---
I made an Ironman for the same reason. And to be fair, you can play the regular game that way, I just have poor self control.
---
Dude it's on sale right now... Like 9 a month if you buy a year vs 11 regularly.
---
&gt; most of the player base
---
&gt;Outliers exist
---
sounds likr effort though
---
What happened to him?
---
i believe karambwans are better, not sure where prices are at currently though
---
whats the bodybuilder reference, i dont get it
---
if you plan on doing a lot of bossing, sure
---
Weird. I remember clearing the paint in the past, but that obviously wasn't on OSRS.
---
Mines 121 bonds weekly. :(
---
Yeah they unbanned my account for something similae
---
No one knows my password, I memorized by heart and it's never in the same account in any platform of game or social media.
---
oh shit really??? whats the discount??
---
I.. know? I have totally talked about how they aren't going to publicly announce things that tarnish their company rep. That's call business. Again, everyone does this.
---
99 fm is only if you plan to max at some point. 75 fm gets you enough gp for your early quests then you transition to thieving for early game gp as thieving is a far more useful skill
---
They're not threatening legal action. What the heck are you on?
---
They're saying "hey guys, we noticed some leaks, so it seems our informal request for confidentiality isn't working. So we'll stop talking here and if you guys want in on the discussion again you'll have to sign an NDA" which is perfectly reasonable. No one is being forced to sign an NDA or anything, they would only have to do so if they want to still be in the confidential discussion. That's standard in every company I've ever seen, even for something as trivial as an office visit.
---
I literally just told you dude... 90 for a year...
---
My password was never changed and I did send in an appeal and have herd nothing back
---
If you do solo wintetodt the construction xp is actually really really good. The amount of con xp you get per brazier repair scales based on your construction level so it keeps going up. Somewhere around 130-150m firemaking xp is 99 construction.
---
Ardy
---
Yep I want to be safe rather than sorry, I’m planning on sending my pc when I head off to work shortly
---
Got mine between 700-800 kc a while back.  Sorry in advance ironman accounts.
---
Sorry just can't find any mention of it on the site.
---
That rng

I mean Hitler was an awesome public speaker. It's just a shame that his views on the world were absolutely insane.

Click on buy membership and look at prices.
---
Tfw you and your wife are 47,500+ bonds in student loan debt...I think I’ll just play RS for fun and save the bonds for irl...
---
I like to believe that it's actually Zyzz'z brother.
---
No, dense essence is acquired at a fixed rate. You could use a bronze pickaxe and get it at the same speed
---
I made the account in 2015 when I was in Korea
---
okay but joel has grinded 126 bowling already
---
gratz on 99 fletching tho
---
Ehhh unlikely. There have been a lot of posts about duping on this sub before his video went live. It definitely wasn’t unknown, but it wasn’t main stream knowledge.
---
Yeah that's true
---
Likely also a result of the long term membership farm that was allowed to go on after mobile to get "more players".
---
That allowed who knows how many bot farms to operate doing members methods rather than F2p ones. Generating far more gold.
---
Ex fucking scoose me???
---
No bc I would like the game to look as medieval as possible. That is how rs originally was.
---
Is Graardor applicable to any tasks, or just his minions?
---
I know boss tasks can roll him, but I haven't unlocked them yet because I don't have experience with most.
---
bout time u maxed
---
Early this year? Gold hasn't been $1/m anywhere that was actually competitive for years.
---
This dupe was the result of forced server crashes, not updates. If you've convinced yourself of the urban legend that we only use 10% of our brains, please stop believing that. You'll get so much more out of life when you realize you could use your whole brain.
---
Same thing really.
---
If youre looking to put a new account on the email account you cant do that, just start a new account, your old account will have transferred to rs3 eoc anyway and thats trash. So make a new one.
---
It's been in the game code since original RuneScape and RuneScape 2.
---
Pet by 99 is like 30% chance
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee fucking freak!!
---
Niceee
---
Doo-doo-doo dooooo
---
The house looks like it's shrugging.
---
Ruined my merhod...
---
Can't really take it when you don't get their kill as a result.
---
You can ruin it, but that's wasting your own time just as much as theirs.
---
Got mine at 4.5k
---
"Dps per hour" lol.
---
Every bad company does this*
---
I've seen good companies that are actually honest and upfront about everything.
---
I just don't like how you said Rendi likes to over dramatize everything. I don't even watch the guy, but he was the only one that stepped up and did something about it. Maybe now they will actually fix it instead of applying a band aid to it.
---
You play RuneScape. You're never having kids mate.
---
hey, you found my wallpaper from my old workplace.
---
I think that was different. Because it was a legal matter, so they had to announce it publically. 
---
If you remember correctly, when everyone talked about him being rouge, they "investigated" him and found "nothing". Can't say we heard the full story tbh. Not until the cops were involved, is when they said something.
---
Lol sorry, I can't lend you the wand.
---
Good luck at zulrah! 85 mage shouldn't cost you more than 10m if you have the money to spend for bursting. I can't stand alching or teleporting for magic xp, so I don't mind dropping the cash to not have to click every second.
---
Everyone involved with this situation deserves basic respect and decency as a baseline. 
---
The internet is a cesspool, with a specific emphasis on the OSRS twitch community on this particular day. Horrible.
---
There's just no reason to damage corp when there are way better alternatives, like allowing the item to attach to both mage's book and arcane, and giving a higher bonus if it's attached to an arcane, which give life to the new content without damaging old content.
---
Issue is they would to roll back over a day. It was claimed 6b from like 2 days prior. I and many others would really dislike having our accs rolled back 2 days. For things like max cash bug it was a very short amount of time.
---
My car payment is 103 bonds...
---
I'd love to know what state you live in because here in Portland, not a single trespass arrest I've made the past 4 years has stuck nor required me to go to Court. (The exception of course is if it was an additional charge that was tacked on.... even then they will typically drop trespass in the plea deals.)
---
As for resources... How could a DA office not care to save resources? That make's no sense. When each ADA has a case load of 50+, they pick and chose according to public safety. Trespass is lowest priority and is often not pursued.
---
Every crime has certain criteria to meet so the circumstances very much matter. It's not black and white such as you did or didn't. Each crime has elements they must meet. For example one of them would be Mens Rea (State of Mind). Basically if the Law wrote requirement for Trespass 2 is to "Knowingly" enter. Then DA has to prove he knew what he was trespassing. Defense Attorney would have to prove he didn't know he wasn't suppose to enter. Then evidence is provided such as well we had a Yellow Gate on that path. Then one would argue against it saying well it didn't have a fence. The jury then decides based on law and what a reasonable person would think if they were in that position.
---
What makes you think I'm "triggered." You're projecting and "triggered" has somehow become some catch-all term for Reddit in order to passive aggressively insult someone. It's really distasteful.
---
Your both pathetic.
---
They know about it, and they do ban them. They can easily fix this, but they won't. Want to know why? 
---
When all bots got banned, there was a wait time avg of 15minutes. Imagine waiting 15 minutes per game. Enjoy this while it lasts, because when twitch prime is over, it's not going to have bots. Then I will see all of you guys complaining why no LMS is starting.
---
I think its lame that Jagex will always offer 75, no matter how absurdly powerful the weapon is, to help it pass a poll. Most people aren't going to calculate the DPS of a new weapon against various monsters so they just eyeball it, oh 75 won't be too OP. Then people were killing sara gwd's in under 10 seconds with twisted bow.
---
The last line got me.
---
Boobs
---
i really dont get it
---
It's not a matter of if we should know but when we should know.
---
It seems they're still working on the issue in order to ensure it is never a problem again. If they let us know immediately, then we might have seen armies of edgy teens try the dupe and they'd just end up crashing all the servers without accomplishing anything.
---
I used to lure a little, but after my luring career i actually made a clan and gave a lot of GP away in drop parties in my clan. I feel like this helped my case for going to hell.
---
They allowed 110b to be duped and would have allowed 10 tril to be duped. This sub was already flaming jagex for the tbow dupe and proceeding rollback, how are you all actually saying you would have preferred if the dupe was followed through, likely not spotted until the next few dupes, and then rollbacked behind a considerable amount of time? Would you be happy that you lost days, maybe even weeks of progress from a rollback? Holy fuck this is like a fever dream. All your shit you got before the dupes would have been gone from your accounts, and you're saying that that's the ideal outcome? I know I would have lost a lot of progress during the dates of those dupes.
---
Not to mention, this dupe method is also likely the cause of all the missing money from duel arena dc's. This has been an ongoing problem for a long time and absolutely nothing was done about it until someone spoke up and gave jagex the real scope of what was just about to happen. 
---
This sub counterjerks itself into wishing there was a rollback instead. Cba this is like a fever dream
---
If you have the money its a no brainer, however you will be bleeding GP if you die and lose ether constantly. You'll also be focused more by PKers than with BP.
---
Almost all osrs music is 100bpm lol
---
well, technically you haven't done that until you get 65m exp.
---
Holy fuck that song was 10/10 carbonite
---
I mean, multiple servers crashed and you had a huge influx of new accounts in a very specific place. I think even Jagex should be able to go through the logs and figure that shit out.  It's a bit much to say he saved the economy...
---
I swear in the 15 years I've played this game, this company has made some of the wildest decisions ever.
---
Fake, Cr1tikal would've become the godking of Gielinor with all his nuts.
---
Lol just get your attack up u autist, imagine caring about low level raiding so much ahaha u take a medieval cookie clicker far too seriously man just enjoy the game hahah o no i have to raise my combat level on my raiding account whatever will i do hahaha

The real clue was the construction XP we got along the way

Venezuelans aren't bots, they're real players selling gold. But it's most likely from twisted league

It held it's price for a while actually.

While it was useful at revs.

That rev weps came in and it crashed hard.

Just FYI IP bans are next to useless. Changing your IP is as simple as unplugging your router for a few minutes

Wow, why car?

Way to hide your rc level. You should get that to 99 next.
---
Pro tip do get 40% favour and go kill gang bosses  (they drop real oaks and mahogany planks) another tip; wt for money as you get coins also do your clues and start slayer as many of the monster drop nats and other runes especially bloodveld they drop a of blood runes
---
Infernal eels are more afk if that's what you're looking for. If you wanna be hands-on minnows are pretty good
---
Interesting how they were able to address the issue as soon as they had to for PR reasons, no sooner no later.  The universe is full of coincidences.
---
the ultimate cancer is RC
---
no, the rise of all bones (literally every bone) is because jagex explicitly stated the "use bones" runelite feature is allowed. If you have no urgent need for prayer, i would wait a month or two before hype dies completely down and prices slowly and steadily decline
---
guh..
---
lol
---
/r/runescapebets?
---
Yes, because Jagex aren't doing that at all.
---
&gt;Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game game

right but I consider fishing and wc to be the second and third worst skills after rc, so this dude's on a roll.
---
I’m over here paying 264 bonds for my mortgage and prices are even higher here now.
---
siding with jagex, this subreddit: "wait, that's illegal"
---
Either do alch agility or telealch or burst to get that mage lvl up
---
Well that's the thing is the current duping method was completely fix, the video shows him testing that. There'd be no harm saying it occured and had been fixed. People going on a treasure hunt for a duping mechanism that no longer works is as "dangerous" as it is right now. At this moment there's people thinking of ways to dupe as well. There's always people trying to figure out ways to cheat the game. The whole discord in the video was dedicated to it, you better believe they are still theory crafting bugs as we speak. 
---
So if you announce "someone found a way to dupe and we fixed it" and they actually fixed it, there's seriously no risk. Sure people will be thinking how they can dupe as well, but that's no different from now. So long as the way it was actually accomplished is fixed, there's no greater risk than there is now since there's once again no actual known way to do so.

Is that when every Ironman watches the exact same videos and reads the same guides, then go to Ironman skilling Discords and they discuss whether it's worth spending 30 minutes gaining a level when you'll get it passively from 50 hours of fishing?
---
Ironman Mode is beyond explored and over analysed, sapping a lot of fun. Now it's just waiting for RNG on drops, which a Main can bypass with trading while still doing 80% of the same content.
---
This bait is amazing!

If you are serious though, stop being an entitled knob.

The way you lot are talking makes me think you're all buff as hell dudes on laptops.

Oof lots of people that already have lockpicks about to be salty

I know dude that's what I wanted to say was just like "bruh" wtf was he doing. The guy was flexing about being there for 3 hours. Homie I've been here for 32+ hour sessions for the past 2 weeks lmao. Ain't nobody impressed with your 3 hr lookin ass HAHAHA. Dude was a clown.

Is this just shit tier satire?

jmod bad

It looks like you grabbed that seagull by the throat while it's preparing to launch a fireball at your face. Also there's a cat.
---
Well isn't waiting for that kinda pointless now? Not only has the event been publicized, but the exact method has as well. I don't think they are waiting on a statement to protect the community at this point. All the details have already been revealed. If they are gonna make a statement they are probably just taking a while at this point because they are making it absurdly pristine and PR friendly. This has already exploded and their bigger concern is definitely no longer hiding the exploit but instead repairing community relations.
---
Or hindsight is 20/20, especially after you finally get to hear Jagex's side. They weren't so transparent with Rendi, so why should we judge Rendi after new information comes up that he didn't have. Pretty frustrating stuff for being in that poisiton, especially with Jagex making mistakes that perpetuate misunderstanding...
---
I was a bit annoyed that he took up freaking 15 minutes of the stream but geez, I didn't even know the chat was going THAT nuts
---
Awhh I'm sorry, did I trigger the 50 EHP little babby? =[ move it along, yew tree cutter.
---
How do you not know where you downloaded a virus
---
Everyones different. Personally I'll only skill what I need at that point in time and I dont use clan CC or discord servers. If that's what you're into it's fine with me
---
Because everything melts under Blessing and Focus. There is nothing tanky enough to sustain at all. They actually die.
---
But you can be something like 65 combat and get a hundred brutal blues. You'd only get 10-20 Steels and they're significantly easier to kill.
---
Haha Walker.

You can't do the hard diary without a lock pick, meaning you can't do the elite diary either. Those give perks in the twisted league which grant a significant advantage over other players.

The likely reason they said nothing is because a bandaid fix isn't actually sufficient. It is very likely people are trying to find another way to crash the servers right now and more minds may be working on it than before this video was released.
---
It's actually props to Jagex - this means they're not half-assing this exploit. They are looking for a way to ensure something similar never happens again.
---
The reason Jagex saying, "There was an exploit, it's fixed" is a terrible fucking idea is because that confirms that there was a dupe. A duping exploit in any MMO is a treasure hunt and people who want to exploit it will try to find it if it is confirmed to have existed. There are people who still try to recreate the Pink Partyhat dupe today.
---
You also don't seem to understand why Rendi's video being on YouTube is significant. YouTube is not like Reddit where moderators can hide posts quickly. YouTube would require Jagex to copyright claim the video to take it down after many Rendi subscribers already watched the video EXPLICITLY stating Jagex is censoring posts about it. That is even worse for Jagex.
---
Also, again, the reason Jagex wasn't communicating with Rendi or the other content creators was because no NDAs were signed. This means Jagex wanted to share information but wanted a legal guarantee that the information would remain confidential. The censorship was because the subreddit mods of all gaming subreddits censor posts about ongoing bugs and exploits that could break the game. It's specifically a subreddit rule.
---
I'm going to repeat this point because you seem to think a bandaid fix is fine. It really is not. Just because this specific method for crashing the server no longer works does not mean the duping exploit is entirely fixed. Keeping it secret would 100% have been best even now - if Jagex managed to actually fix the rollback issue then any server crashing methods would not threaten the game economy.
---
It doesn't exsit
---
Sure but not "make a whole new game" hate like eoc
---
You'll be fine the best tip I can give is what a lot of my friends and I use is chins. As soon as the healers come out switch to them till they all come to you. If you can't out damage them then lure away and kill all but one and get it low. Then go back and kill had after you restock go and prayer and pots and just fight like normal. 
---
Got a lot of jad kills with this its pretty stress free
---
That isn't what it means by enumerated purposes...
---
Are you being serious right now dude?
---
I have like 200 something days left on a yearly subscription - is there no way to transfer that to my ironman?
---
1 minute? He had to explain why he knows about, how it happened, how he tried to fix it, and how it worked.
---
Got ignored/ was in enough contact to know about NDAs, choose one. "since we're still working on it pls don't make more people aware of it" Isn't that the definition of what an NDA would do in this situation? He knew they were working on a patch because they were actively hotfixing this weekend when this stuff came to light and to top it all off, according to Jagex they were in contact with him and working on it with him so someone is lying here, and a dramatic content creator is far less trustworthy in my eyes then a legally bound company.
---
I'd vote for this
---
|to use the information only for enumerated purposes;
---
Quite literally means "You can only use the information in ways specifically listed out by the contract"
---
I hate you

That's true but a ton of players didn't even give it a chance
---
For me EoC was kinda cool in the beginning, I had a lot of fun for like 6 months before it got really bad
---
Sure. However, nothing stops them from using their knowledge to purchase in game items that they assume will raise in value..

What is the proper channel to go about this? Your website says you are entirely unable to submit a request if the membership has already been used. I have 208 days left that I want to transfer to my ironman (my new love) and I'm getting mixed signals here :/
---
Also, you live longer so you have longer time to enjoy your wealth.
---
You can cancel it now, if you wait till the last few days it might auto-renew which ropes you into another month
---
My weekly budget includes bonds
---
this thread is for asking other players, not the devs.
---
answer is yes, I think the largest group of devs would be content developers in fact.
---
As I said before. Everyone who can do these crashes, already knew about it. 
---
Half the people here can't do this.
---
You can cancel it now if you wish, your remaining membership days won't be removed.
---
I mean, we might all be doing the same things, following a guide or whatever, but were still doing 10x as much different content as non irons. If you don't like alot of the stuff irons have to do then that's fair, lots is kinda boring, but I enjoy the variety.
---
I also really enjoy how ironman highlights the interdependency of skills, and shifts the focus from gp to items and accomplishments.
---
Different strokes ya know.
---
&gt;he's been banned on accounts in the past, and this one is up soon too.
---
either this or i can only assume he gets embarrassed when people call him out like this and he makes a new account to avoid having the post history follow him
---
Ik this was way back in the day, but watching that protect from melee literally never change hurt my soul.
---
I play solo on mobile, don't really know anyone that plays so that might be a struggle. Havent heard of the spider but I'll have a look thanks. I did want to start playing again to get my slayer up  but it's not high enough to make much money yet either
---
Its the noob trap
---
I feel like wearing a hamburger costume is a betrayal of your character as "/u/hotdog3344"
---
Yup. I was so pumped to have rigour I didn’t give a shit about 60m. Having all the prayers unlocked looks dope too lol. Every time I come into extra gp, I spend it within the hour
---
Ahhh gotcha. What’s your combat level if you remember?
---
I know, he's the best!
---
It fucks a lot up tho. Many people getting wild drops on ironmen only to loose them. Hardcores dying being brought back to hc status. I was joking about 3 months who knows how long people have been duping shit in the shadows maybe it has been a few days.
---
Lik de sjröm veurrom maar neer
---
Wait, since when can you get a pet from herbs? Was this always like this?
---
He also spent 29 days with probably 8h+ per day doing that to get there.
---
Not instead of my car payment lmao. I’m not struggling for gp either tho so I don’t mind
---
I feel this. I feel like RS should be based on a pseudo rng type system where your luck early on is super shit and over time it gets more and more likely to get it. Then when you get the item you get back to shitty rng to make it so people don’t go 1947492948 dry
---
Not that I disagree but he isn't likely to respond because shit talking a sponsor that he has taken on would likely be a void of the contract, and he might not have had much of a "pick" in which sponsors he grabs.
---
RuneSkate
---
I prefer the old school look of armor due to nostalgia but what made me stop playing is that the abilities had no place in osrs in my opinion.
---
Fuuck that’s tough. NYC prolly expensive to park too so maybe subway is a win
---
If you're talkin efficiency then you should upgrade asap. Memb speeds up basically every skill. Doing memb quests is the recommended way to do early levels for most skills. Definitely do it if you have 60 atk for that DScim but you should be training slayer to get there really.
---
I hate math. Math can't lie to me like people do. Numbers are only falsifiable due to human error.
---
I don't feel so go-
---

---
Nice.
---
I just never saw it as grinding for bonds. I would grind Vorkath cause it was fun and I liked seeing the drops. Those drops add up and there’s your bond. Granted most players don’t even have the time to get to Vorkath so just spend $11 lmao. Or don’t play
---
Yeah but OP is a burger only ironman it's more impressive
---
Afking skills while playing skyrim, name a more iconic duo
---
Thank u so much!
---
&gt;Husky: Yes, this has been reduced to 4% and defensive stats are lowered. Not going to say that it's going to be worse than the Arcane. If that were the case then it could be dead content and it feels that a group boss like this would be reasonable to drop this. The arcane will still be a niche in its own right too. We feel it's a fair proposition after the nerf so get out there and test it and vote and give feedback
---
voting no on tome if they dont make it an arcane spirits hield attachment, otherwise arcane is going to be completely dead content.
---
Nerf alch tables is better fix, gwd should inspire future droptables, no trevs/vork

Classic 50/50
---
This is hilarious no idea why it doesn't have a humor tag
---
No this is dumb
---
If it was sold which I imagine was maybe 1 day from being sold, it would've been a problem. That money could be sold to players that buy bonds amd them the money is gone.
---
Wow what a surprise, things aren't always named in exact precise ways LOL
---
Kettle, meet pot.  I literally didn't know anything about the guy 2 days ago.  You seem to be quite familiar with the taste of Jagex's shoe polish though, looking at your comment history.
---
is there any proof any of this actually happened besides him saying it?
---
I have no qualms with killing flipping.
---
Cosmic runes dropped about 30gp last week and stabilised a few days ago. That might be a good bet but its your own judgement
---
Basicly like a private server, you set your stats. Gear up from a table that has every item in the game. 
---
I am only trying to come up with against points so you can make an educated decision. Also your speaking like the fights will be an outlast fight.. have you ever done any f2p pking? People will only fight you if you risk hp below their max stack here and there. Also people who dont risk 40k, dont really get fights as people will just run from you. Ive had a 20 atk and then 30 atk before doing the 40 a few times and mith and addy are shit compared to rune2h. Even with the extra str, matched range and low hp a 40 atk acc outclassed it in every way. 
---
But again youll understand a shitload on the tourny worlds.
---
Between 5 and 6 add Rendi didn’t get enough attention so he made a video exposing how to exploit the bug while simultaneously trying to make himself look like a martyr when that wasn’t the. Actually that should just be your 6 with the he didn’t get the attention he wanted part added.
---
Welcome!
---
I see that guy used the troll naming system to generate his name
---
Can confirm this is the case.
---
Turn on your brain, you know what he meant
---
&gt;The thing is, Clue scrolls are not efficient for money. Why would i go do clue scrolls when i can just kill zulrah / vorkath for 2.5-3m/hr.
---
That wasn't the argument and you know it. The argument was "Clues are already mediocre for money, why make it worse." It was also speaking of the metaphorical value, i.e. clue completion count, as getting multiple quickly would be easier.
---
&gt;Which is why i mostly just get 1 clue every task as i don't bother regearing every time.
---
And that's entirely on you. That's why I mentioned "I'd like clue scrolls to keep their 'should I or shouldn't I' aspect" in my original post. Personally, I like getting 6 hards in one task, despite the tediousness of needing to regear.
---
&gt;Making it possible to stack multiple clues up to a cap of 5, 10 or 25 would make it possible to train combat/slayer then when you bored or something, you can now go do the clues.
---
They're not meant to be a something you do when you're bored, they're meant to be done as a break from what you're currently doing. Clues should not bend to peoples' laziness.
---
If you truly just see clues as something tedious, instead of subjecting yourself to it, why not just not do them. What's that? You want the chance at some of that rare loot? Then put in the work.
---
I'd honestly like to hear what your clue counts are like that make you think that repolling stackable clues for the main game is a good idea.
---
I’m assuming he was up for one of these awards before? (New to actually keeping up with OSRS community so out of the loop on that.)
---
Jagex devs should realice sooner than later that the main negative effect of power creep is to displace previous content and suddenly evaporating the utility and value of your player's assets.
---
And such effect is totally avoidable with upgrades upon previous BiS, which wouldn't make new content "dead content" nor past content "dead content".
---
Please, this is not a problem with just Arcanes, everything in the future risks the same bad trend, start being creative with new items that upgrade upon previous BiS, do not sacrifice old content for new. Add value instead of removing it from one place to put it somewhere else.
---
Ok gotcha and ya i have just been a tremendous amount of time lol just getting back into it all since my friend downloaded it onto my phone. The tourny world requires a new char? Or everytime u transfer to that world shit is just given to you?
---
Que?
---
Monks friend for a huge wc level boost, druidic ritual for herblore, buying a house and training construction a little for free construction xp. Also thieving for cakes if you play to do wintertodt at 10 hp
---
I really don't like the stats on the inquisitor set. The strength bonus is far too high and manages to devalue every competing strength bonus item for their slot. Obsidian armor becomes useless, fighter torso becomes a waste of time, and bandos chestplate no longer holds its edge as objectively best. These items seem only to exist to replace or devalue its competing items, rather than existing to fill a niche.
---
like a skinny white teen
---
I mean you refer to my comment history but I’m sure there’s only like 1-2 comments of me siding with JAGEX on this compared to your history so if anyone is a boot licker here, try looking in the mirror.
---
Same account. But its like a new char even time you log into a tourny world. You have to reset fkeys and quick prays and bank etc each log. You should be able to set your levels and grab any gear and supplies from the table.
---
Did you tell konar to ignore combat levels? You shouldn't get blue dragons under 100 cmb otherwise
---
smoke bonds everyday
---
She does chill, straight under a rock during MM2
---
My mum died on Tuesday. Thanks for that. I agree. Do it guys. Don't regret not doing it.
---
The real answer is bird houses and herb runs. They're frequent enough to be a decent moneymaker but don't require constant attention like the usual money making methods, so you can log in on mobile a few times a day and spend a relatively small amount of time making money to sustain your account with membership.
---
I think you mean about 17m/h!

Twitch chat and twitter comments go hand-in-hand when it comes to toxicity. Not saying reddit is any better but I have seen more toxicity in one OSRS twitter post about an upcoming update than I do on this sub for weeks at a time.

How much have you made off skilling ?

Imagine wildy with no borders, ATTACK 😂😂Looters be stressing
---
You don't need it, the way I did it was plant 20 and water them, running all the time (at 63 agility) and then when I harvested I walked and had plenty of time. Also the watering can is 100% worth it, the best first item, as you'll save a lot of time refilling cans.
---
Hunting red chins is easily 400k+. That does require 80 Hunter. Death runes is 500k+ at 65 RC, smithing mithril bars with 60 smithing is also above 500k. You can get 500k with fishing minnows at 82+ fishing, but it can easily take 6+ hours to get the angler's outfit.
---
For 1+ mill all I know of are making rune bars (85 smithing) or killing demonic gorillas (unreliable) or Money snake/dragon.

Good to know i can work 60 hours a week and still make addy tier :)

no

but this is ranged, and there are % magic damage boost as opposed to flat increase for melee.

Lovely, did my task yesterday, unfortunately no rings

i still think the tome is far too overpowered. still makes the arcane spirit shield legit dead content. +4% magic strength is nuts and a +5 accuracy over the over arcane is crazy, i think it should be at the most +3% magic strength with a +2 accuracy over the arcane

Ballista can spec a 76 and that thing is a lot cheaper. Also dark bow can hit 51-51.

Depends on their reason for joining I suppose before you can rule that out.

#Ashihama Rewards Beta and Sire Changes
---
28 November 2019
---
*This week sees the release of a rewards beta for the upcoming Nightmare of Ashihama boss as well as Abyssal Sire improvements.*
---
#The Nightmare of Ashihama: Rewards Beta
---
We've opened some beta worlds for you to test the new rewards designed for the Nightmare of Ashihama!
---
The beta will be hosted on Tournament Worlds. On these worlds, you spawn at Clan Wars with Tournament Chests nearby containing various supplies and equipment (this time including the new boss rewards). Tournament Worlds use a separate profile than your main account does, so no progress is saved or affects your main profile - feel free to go anywhere in Old School to try out the new gear!
---
For the purposes of this beta, worlds **446**, **464** and **477** will become Tournament Worlds. Once the beta closes, these worlds will be turned off rather than converted back into normal worlds to adjust for reduced traffic.
---
More information on the backstories of each item can be found in our Nightmare of Ashihama poll blog.
---
All the rewards are a work in progress and subject to change as well as passing a poll. Let us know what you think of them on these discussion threads on Twitter, Reddit, and the Official Forums!
---
**Changelist:**
---
Since the release of the poll blog, the following adjustments have been made:
---
* The stab, slash, crush and magic defence of all Inquisitor armour pieces were slightly reduced.
---
* The Volatile Orb's special attack base damage was reduced to 58 (including the staff's built-in 15% additional Magic damage).
---
* The Eldritch Orb's special attack base damage was reduced to 44 (including the staff's built-in 15% additional Magic damage).
---
* The Siren's Tome Magic damage stats was reduced from 10% to 4% and it was given -10 stab, slash, crush and ranged defence.
---
* The Staff of Nightmares has been renamed to the Nightmare Staff.
---
**Inquisitor's Armour**
---
[The female variation of the armour.](https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2019/newsposts/2019-11-18/inquisitor_armour.png)
---
The Inquisitor's armour is a new set with high crush accuracy and defence. All three pieces, the helm, hauberk and tassets require 70 Strength and 30 Defence to equip.
---
[Stats: still broken as fuck](https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2019/newsposts/2019-11-18/armour_2.png)
---
**The Inquisitor's Mace**
---
*[The male variation of the armour.](https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2019/newsposts/2019-11-18/mace_2.png)*
---
Once the personal weapon of the Inquisitor, this mace is a one-handed crush weapon requiring 75 attack to equip.
---
[Stats: +95 crush, +52 stab, +89 str, +2 pray](https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2019/newsposts/2019-11-18/mace.PNG)
---
**[The Nightmare Staff](https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2019/newsposts/2019-11-18/staff_of_nightmares.png)**
---
*Note that special attack animations are placeholder only.*
---
The Nightmare Staff is a magical weapon requiring 65 Magic to equip. It is able to autocast both Standard and Ancient spells and can be adapted using three attachments:
---
* **The Harmonised Orb** gives the staff a passive effect that allows it to cast standard spells one tick faster than normal and removes the tick delay when autocasting. However, the staff loses the ability to autocast Ancient spells.
---
* **The Volatile Orb** gives the Staff a special attack that fires a single spell at the target. This spell requires no runes to use but costs 50% special attack energy. The attack deals up to 58 base damage (which can be increased using damage boosting items) with 50% improved accuracy. This number includes the Staffs own Magic damage bonus.
---
* **The Eldritch Orb** gives the Staff a special attack that fires a single spell at the target. This spell requires no runes to use but costs 75% special attack energy. The attack deals up to 44 base damage (which can be increased using damage boosting items). This number includes the Staffs own Magic damage bonus. It also restores the caster's Prayer points by 50% of the damage dealt. This can boost the caster’s Prayer points above their Prayer level to a maximum of 120.
---
When the staff has an orb attached, the Magic requirement increases to 75.
---

---
**[The Siren's Tome](https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2019/newsposts/2019-11-18/sirens_tome.png)**
---
The Tome is an item worn in the off-hand slot that requires 75 Magic to equip. This could be a stand alone item dropped by the Nightmare, or an attachment to the existing Mage's Book. Let us know which you prefer!
---
[Stats: +25 mage atk, +20 mage def, -10 other defs, +4% mage dmg, -5 pray](https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/oldschool/2019/newsposts/2019-11-18/tome_3.png)

#The Abyssal Sire
---
**Phase Transitions**
---
The Abyssal Sire transitions to its next phase when enough damage was dealt. Previously, the check for damage was carried out when the boss was hit but before damage was applied.
---
For example, the boss transitions to Phase 3 once it reaches 200 hp (50%). If the Sire had 230 HP and you hit it for 35 damage, it would be left with 195 HP (below the phase transition threshold). Rather than transition to the next phase, it would wait for your next hit. Let's say the XP drop you receive indicates you "hit" another 35. Rather than go down to 160 HP, the Sire would then move to the next phase with the 195 HP it had from before.
---
This has been changed so that players no longer deal "lost" hits and the Sire transitions when expected.
---
**Shadow Spell Stuns**
---
Successful stuns against the Sire using Shadow spells give you 30 seconds to kill all four of its respiratory systems. However, it takes about 10-15 seconds to kill each respiratory system, so this phase usually takes a minimum of two shadow spells.
---
Previously, quickly killing the first two respiratory systems resulted in dead-time where it was not worth starting the remaining two. This was because the Sire's remaining stun had to expire before the next could be cast. this has been changed so that the Sire can be re-stunned with the following success chances:
---
Shadow Rush: 25%
---
Shadow Burst: 50%
---
Shadow Blitz: 75%
---
Shadow Barrage: 100%
---
The Sire can now be stunned to begin the fight too. This will still trigger its waking-up animation, so you won't know until it's fully awake if the stun was successful (unless Shadow Barrage was used).

&gt; incredibly uncomfortable to a point of semi-impossibility. 
---
I have no idea what game you're playing but it seriously is not this severely different when at 10hp vs at 50hp or 99hp. Literally the only difference is you have to eat different, slightly worse food. That doesn't make it 'incredibly uncomfortable' or 'semi-impossible', those are large exaggerations.
---
If you're worried about cost, just use wines. They're 1gp for 11 health, and if you need higher healing just use monkfish (400gp), which heal 16, not too far off sharks for 1/3 the price. If you're an ironman then it's not much different at all, since you have to get your own supplies anyways, and getting cakes takes the same amount of time as something like karambwans, but the latter gives reasonable useful xp and are useful if you overstock later.
---
Your point about the rewards being openable later is valid, however if you plan on getting 99fm instantly on an ironman then you'll only have 200 bank space until high levels, which is a questionable decision.  
---
Also whilst as you say the damage reduction is tied to the pyro set, the pyro set has no effect at 10hp since the lowest you can take is 1, so the reduction is ONLY useful at higher hp levels, and this lets you take longer before needing to eat
---
That all being said, you have a valid complaint that it's easier to do at 10hp, but it's not as horrible as you make it sound like it is, you aren't being cheated or punished etc. It's a very mild nuisance overall and is mostly undone by the damage reduction effect and increased rewards useful immediately.

Mod Maz, when creating a design for the proposed max fire cape was given feedback saying how it looked like ketchup and mustard and she started going off on a few people calling their avatars ugly and even went as far as to insult them personally. Mod Gee insulted janitors of all people by putting them down and comparing them to the people insulting Jagex on Twitter, Mod Acorn just threw a few temper tantrums on Twitter and the subreddit as well at various users who were discussing things irrelevant to the game itself. TL:DR, women being women.
---
#f2ponly
---
There was no threat in any of the information disclosed by Rendi.  He substantiated it, and Jagex confirmed it.  I've already explained this to you.
---
Your conjecture about how random people on reddit are now going to try and log in with 2000 clients is worthless.  Fun fact for the road - most people on here knew this was happening, they just couldn't talk about it.  And now suddenly we can.  I wonder what's changed.  I guess the bug's neutralization happened to coincide with Rendi's video /s
---
Ok bro I go for that next time, unfortunately can’t afford ring of the gods, but may get myself the explorers
---
I heard it can even scale to more.....jagex better get on this before the economy breaks!
---
Nice deffo got me through the task
---
again, you're missing the point, flooding styles with constantly better gear without taking in to account what they'll to do other content is ignorant is not how game design should be discussed.
---
&gt;Is it easy to completely crash a server?
---
"Easy"? probably not. But there is undoubtedly multiple ways to pull it off, especially considering this method of duping has been exploited on games where the servers are substantially more stable and trying to overload it with thousands of accounts just doesn't work. 
---
&gt;Otherwise, why were these guys using that method?
---
Probably because the Ice Poseidon vods gave them proof that it works without actually having to try anything, and they just so happened to have the resources to go through with it.
---
That is literally an easy scape solution
---
This sort of tough restrictions is what makes a region locked account challenging. So you want every item to be dropped by a level 100 Monster? No that is shit.
---
 Look at swampman for example. To get a rune crossbow he had to open 400 lucky imps which takes way longer than grinding slayer for Hydra.
---
Suck it up and do it zzzz
---
Fair point
---
What's to stop people attempting the dupe prior to the restart? As I understand it, players have different save points. 
---
Can a player not trade someone else, give them gold and potentially revert back to when it wasn't traded? The other player then may have a save point when the gold was recieved??
---
I even posted a comment for context but it seems no one saw it. Guh!
---
Smerkaberrrrrlll!
---
Yea now you can just wake it up with a shadow spell. However if you are not using  Shadow Barrage then you need to wait until it's done waking up to see if the hit was successful. There is no reason to wake it up with a blowpipe anymore.
---
The next tbow/scythe weapon is going to come from the next raid, as it should. Those are the hardest pvm challenges and should give the best rewards. The boss already drops insanely good armor and a mace that is better than the grazi rapier. Considering the price of the rapier, the mace is going to be over 200m because its +95 crush as opposed to +94 stab on the rapier and an additional +2 prayer bonus. The armor set should cost at least as much as bandos, but will likely be significantly more again due to the prayer bonus and it gives crush accuracy bonuses.
---
Dark bow can hit 96s? AGS can hit 85? Lol
---
Yeah and that hit is with engame gear, try the staff with like ahrims and look at it then
---
Is this on certain times of the day that bots run? Im online now and its 10pm for me and theres fucking no one lol
---
ah dang, I was afraid of that. Eh, I probably will go back to mage training then, thank you!
---
When you say do lines I hope you mean a pit stop where you can rack up a fatty to keep motivation up.
---
Why should it be? it's not from a raid
---
Every comp game in a nutshell
---
&gt;He substantiated it, and Jagex confirmed it.  I've already explained this to you.
---
 You've misunderstood my point.
---
&gt; Your conjecture about how random people on reddit are now going to try and log in with 2000 clients is worthless. Fun fact for the road - most people on here knew this was happening, they just couldn't talk about it 
---
Wrong, a lot of people didn't know that this was happening. On top of that, most bugs don't require you to log in with 2000 clients. This is gonna make people try bugs that are simpler.
---
The harmonised orb is absolutely ridiculous, I feel like way too many people are gonna be complaining about the other orbs and this one will get overshadowed. You can't keep the 4t surge orb like this.
---
What makes you think it's going to cost over 100m? There is no use for the item besides pking... not really going to be a huge demand for the item, and we dont know the drop rates but I imagine the boss is going to get camped a ahit ton and add a ton of these to the game bert quickly.
---
No =(
---
my point is not that price reflect power of an item. My point is that price is true gate for accessing the item
---
&gt; The gp value of an item does not at all reflect the tier it's in
---
if by tier you mean level required to use item of course price do not reflect the tier. price also do not reflect power of an item, price reflect multiple things at once. 
---
price reflect complicated relationship between how hard to get, power, usefulness, rarity, prestigious of an item.  
---
Currently to get better gear you need to spend a lot of gp or spend a lot of time doing raids or other endgame content.
---
Even if you move Tbow to lvl 90 it will be harder to get money for Tbow not the level 90. So you do not unlock better hear by leveling up but by amassing hundreds of millions of gold.  
---
So the effect is that making weapons unlock at different levels do not make it that "As your levels go up, the access to more powerful gear happens".
---
Dark bow has lower attack speed by a substantial margin with a decent travel time to react for eating. Nobody is sure what this one is though.
---
AGS is also melee, and dumping 75 attack is a lot more restrictive on an account than magic level because those that have magic will use this anyway.
---
Nah that's not an option
---
HAHAH I bet you feel all high and fucking mighty Correcting my mistake lmfao
---
\*Splashes\*
---
Finally mobile clients get to compete with runelite! Monster HP bar checker OP
---
Go try and use it on someone while you're using mystic robes and they have full dhide. Its not OP
---
Crohn’s for foodies?
---
1. Protect item is a thing so your not losing it
---
2. Smite team? you have to suck at the game to get smited
---
3. yeah ags can hit higher so can dark bow. but they cant bind/freeze/tele block
---
4. the max in ahrims, occult, torm, ma2 (20m gear) is still a 76
---
5.
---
76 is an insanely high hit considering that it can be used with ancients, you're forgetting the utility value of magic.
---
&gt;The Drunken Dwarf has been told to make less noise with his whistle so will do so more quietly.
---
This devalues my DeafMan Mode ironman, reee
---
Why do people think this staff is going to cost so much? It's not going to cost over 100m. Maybe initially when the boss first drops but once enough supply enter the game the staff is going to be well under 100m
---
You do know how fast the spell travels because it’s in the beta worlds. And yeah those weps have some disadvantages but they still have way higher max hits to offset it
---
why would you be using it in that situation though? your pking wrong if your doing that...
---
it should be for slayer for example, only a sanguistini staff will still be perferred in a lot of situations because of it's healing effect. Take for example no prep solo CoX
---
"The Siren's Tome Magic damage stats was reduced from 10% to 4% and it was given -10 stab, slash, crush and ranged defence."
---
Way too big nerf tbh
---
The fact that that’s still obscenely lucky really underscores just how astronomical OPs RNG is.
---
What slayer master assigns MTA?
---
Well that explains why Rendi's post is top page with a trillion upvotes doesn't it?
---
14 Years ago i was in a car accident that left me with pretty reduced mental function, one of the hardest areas hit was my memory. Doctors said i had the memory capacity of a distracted 6 year old with ADHD - well, they didn't say it in those terms but it was heavily implied. The accident also had a profound impact on my general intelligence (I, and the doctors involved didn't really believe in the scientific accuracy of IQ tests, but it was noticeably lower).
---
Updates like this is what keeps me playing. Thank you so much Jagex.
---
WhErE's ThE LaMb SaUcE?
---
Lol woops, I totally missed that haha. Was a bit tired while making it, my apologies.
---
Same. I’m living that sweet, sweet three figures paycheck life as well.
---
Anyone know the u/ of that binomial probability dude? Would be interested to know the odds for this!
---
I’ve just unlocked my third relic and I was leaning towards choosing Gatherer or Warrior, but the stats say the majority of players are taking Artisan. Aren’t those skills already fast? Am I missing something obvious?
---
im definitely an outlier here but i even hated the 2008 "hd" update, never mind the godawful artstyle that they eventually shifted to for rs3
---
What you mean? Cleaning toadflax is like 1m per hour profit.
---
That actually does sound pretty scary yeah. Would you say up the reqs or use more spec? Or would you say just scrap the whole thing? I really like the staff, but I'm starting get my mind changed about its power level
---
That means empty ectophials are now a discontinued item?
---
Rip when someone gets banned and they all move up 1 spot
---
same with OSBuddy
---
Everything except the mace is still overpowered. Gonna vote nope.
---
I understand why it’s frustrating, I just don’t get why someone would volunteer to play a restricted Ironman mode only to turn around and complain about the challenges . It defeates the purpose of the entire game mode lol
---
Is this main game too?
---
The game was almost destroyed because someone found out how to destroy it. But the mods and op saved the game. Everyone loses their minds 'cause the mods didn't write about the incident in a manner that you find suitable.  
---
Thats how small some of you are, unfortunately.
---
&gt;Everyone that was in any way informed about this game knew.  That category includes everyone who has the ability to organize massive server kills like this.
---
Just look at the top comments of the original reddit post by Rendi. There was A LOT of people who had never heard of this happening. :D
---
&gt; You're claiming that the existence of exploitable bugs in the game (something everyone knows) is going to generally cause people to pursue bugs that are exploitable that are in no way related to the bug we're talking to? 
---
No. Making a BIG DEAL of them and spreading them is gonna make people pursue bugs similar to it, and bugs in general.
---
&gt; And somehow any of this is a justification to not talk about that aforesaid bug, which has no relation to the bugs people will try? 
---
Yes, I don't think we shouldn't at least make videos about bugs and how to do them, even if they're already fixed.
---
&gt; Christ man, give it up, stop grabbing at straws. I think you've already realized you know nothing Rendi revealed was harmful. 
---
Nope, my opinion has not changed at all from the original. I still think that this is gonna be harmful in the long run.
---
He said train
---
you need ore information on screen to get more efficient gameplay.
---
2 bonds is a small price for a meme
---
Yeah and do you think letting the rest of the community know and talking about it (i.e. indirectly doing their part to contribute potentially valuable information for these bug abusers) is a good idea?
---
u/JagexGambit why no Australian worlds? :/
---
The price of an item doesn't balance an item. If it's OP then it's OP. You wouldn't want [death-touched darts](https://runescape.wiki/w/Deathtouched_dart) in OSRS even if they were a mega-rare master clue reward.
---
A 16% drop shows a very obvious rush of gold into the market lol
---
Jagex definitely removed a large majority of the gold. They wouldn't flat out lie to the playerbase like that, no matter how sketchy everyone thinks they are. Gold dropped because people still believe it wasn't removed,
---
Also after him crying about the golden gnomes I'm not surprised
---
Ah my bad, it was an 85 for ags spec. Thanks for actually pointing out why this is strong. I keep hearing a lot of REEs but very few arguments. 
---
Isn't ballista more for finishing at the end? That vid you linked definitely seems busted. You've changed my mind for sure and there definitely needs to be something changed. Thanks fam.
---
Jagex may be advertising the staff as the magical tbow/scythe.. but the sang staff is still better in the majority of scenarios with its higher max hit and healing effect. + the staves with special attacks kind of lose the effect any time defence specials are required.
---
The only time i really see these staves being viable may be zulrah.
---
Hi there.  
---
I've seen someone else with a similar problem recently. Let me know the display name (either here or via DM) and I'll add your account to my flag to Jagex.
---
Devaluing my 17 unsuccessful attempts throughout 8 hours for four days at young impling looting &amp; dissing dozen of crashers &amp; hundreds implings looted in total Kourend &amp; Kebos locked ironman!
---
r/tryingtoohard btw
---
&gt; Do those runes you quickly withdraw from the bank let you go to any wilderness obelisk, any spirit tree, or any fairy ring straight from the bank area too?
---
Never need the wilderness obelisk, and since I'd be starting from the GE which has a fairy ring and a spirit tree within a 5 second run, yeah, kinda.
---
Imagine calling that training, and wanting to do it for a long time.
---
Still OP anyway.
---
Farming is an easy answer, tons of points to gain from leveling, farming guild, and tithe farm. Otherwise aim for base 60's and points will come naturally
---
$80 is a night of moderate drinking...
---
No gold dropped because it was sold for $0.20 a mill for several days before jagex even knew the dupe existed lol
---
they already do haha
---
The Konar drop table change is making the year feel so slow...
---
&gt;Since Jagex is advertising this weapon as the magic weapon counterpart to the Twisted bow and the Scythe
---
If they are doing this why doesnt my tbow hit 75s on players?
---
Your logic is flawed, that shit is straight up overpowerd.
---

Damn, the phat + god armor combo really brings me back, always wanted that back in 2005 but could never scrape together enough money no matter how many yews I cut.
---
Yuck!
---
Lmao I decided fuck it, I'd keep fishing minnows instead of doing anything active and even then i said FUCK that and got off
---
it feels so janky to play without gpu and ani smoothing :(
---
Guess what I'm trying to say is that nobody did anything wrong. I'm thankful everything was fixed before it had a considerable effect on the economy
---
what if someone took all the names to ruin your fun
---
&gt; You can hit a 93 with a slayer helm on.
---
nice, maybe it will make mage useful for non barrage tasks.
---
Short-term yes, long-term no
---
They're really comparable dps wise on olm. You may opt to still use sang for the healing effect (especially if you do no prep raids).
---
This is a very 1 dimensional way of thinking. What if a gold seller lowered its price and so did his competition in anticipation of the new gold. But there actually is no new gold? Do you just blow up your price again while your competitor is still offering lowered prices?
---
I'm sure you'd get more useful answers if you laid out some more specific question. And what is your thesis statement. It is so easy to answer yes, it's the same in osrs and irl. Then what are you going to do with that answer?
---
Twofold thing, it doesn't take much effort and doesn't expose much to message back someone in regards to this, and your personal bias is going to stifle any form of conversation here out the gate. 
---
Jagex could've messaged him back, but they didn't. No big deal, they're not required. But him seeing the post deletion on Reddit plus the radio silence from jagex on such a major bug? 
---
What else could he really think? 
---
He does speak in a manner that shows he thinks highly of himself and he did jump the gun with some assumptions, but look at it like this. 
---
He could've instead, NOT told jagex, and started duping gold and items himself for real life money. But he didn't. He could've not said a thing about it and just let it happen. But he didn't.
---
Sure, think lowly of him for making a mistake in the past, that's up to you to judge him for vocalizing his work went unrecognized in a moment of passion, but what he did here? It wasn't a bad thing at the end of the day. It wasn't the best thing either, but he definitely didn't do it for personal gain as he could've done very different actions very easily for that.
---
At least he has videos I can watch lol. 
---
Also it’s pretty scummy and low hanging fruit to try and attack someone for  having medical issues they can not control and being prescribed a medicine and using it because it is literally the only drug that provides any relief or quality of life without detrimental side effects. Try harder next time.
---
Boo hoo
---
I stopped reading after you said triple cheese pizza rolls. Combination is the best bro.
---
This requires a fix to actually be in place
---
- from my sub 2k main with a 160m bank (and dex)
---
Yeah fuck you mate
---
I agree but the thing that confuses me is jagex MUST have known about this dupe possibility since Ice Poseidons stream, maybe even sooner... they've had so much time to fix this.
---
So It's either a huge huge problem that can't be fixed (which is very concerning) and they've actually been trying for ages, or they have been extremely incompetent at dealing with it to begin with, thinking no one would try it and letting it get out of hand like it has. It has to be one of those lol
---
And yeah they've apperently "dealt with it" to some extent now, but I believe they've only merely put flags up to detect it,? so the root issue is still unsolved. 
---
Not trying to bash Jagex here, I agree with all the NDA stuff and most of their statement is logical with how to deal with this, but I'm extremely suprised it's been out there in the open this long and has not been fixed and is still not completely fixed!
---
Nah I think it's perfectly reasonable that I can make a 70mage 10hp account and hit 73's two iteming with this staff+occult at combat 36. I might even consider throwing in 25prayer too so I'm only risking the occult.
---
39combat 600k risk hitting 73's with back to back specs - seems legit thanks jagex.
---
/s
---
So wouldn’t that be a great or amazing money maker and 4 mil still be good? I’m failing to see how any of the previously mentioned bosses aren’t good money. 
---
Plus who the hell is soloing or has a team to do ToB with always? I doubt that very many people have the gear or group to do that consistently the way camping a boss is possible
---
I could be wrong but that doesn’t add up for me
---
not really, it required 2k standing in a 50x50 square and doing an action or 2 at a particular time, there's no need for someone with a bot farm now that everyone knows how to do it
---
do you really think Rendi forced Jagex to make a reply and weren't going to prioritize this? a glitch that would literally ruin their game? why would they ever DISMISS anything involving duplication even if it was on a small scale. and as far as I know the whole thing was solved before rendis video went up, so it was literally pointless
---
wow people try to break the game. jagex sorts it out. tank u rendi
---
Are you gonna gain an cb level getting mithril or even black or steel?
---
That was probably me haha. It's just a copy pasta where you have X popular person that is generally well received within the community and is rather wholesome but placed in that ridiculous scenario to buck your expectations of how they act.
---
&gt;there's no need for someone with a bot farm now that everyone knows how to do it
---
&gt;do you really think Rendi forced Jagex to make a reply and weren't going to prioritize this? a glitch that would literally ruin their game? why would they ever DISMISS anything involving duplication even if it was on a small scale. and as far as I know the whole thing was solved before rendis video went up, so it was literally pointless

april 30. 2018.
---
he's a part time cashier wtf would you expect? my first job i got paid like $800/month
---
Ah so since ToB exists every other 3m+/hr activity in the game is shit, gotcha
---
Jdfghkojjmhi is powerless against rendi
---
Slap on a 75 att req for those staff (fuck it make it 85 idc) and you're good lol
---
I like Rendi and his content, and I'm glad he did what he did. I think stuff like this is good for the player base. Good post.
---
Ye 1t hunter, it's used by sweaty ehp nerds to boost hunt exp per hour
---
I know that yellow text is a pro but our stakeholders don't. Otherwise, good presentation.
---
Is the RL plugin removing combat styles okay to use?
---
Im at 1850 hours played and im no where near maxed.    
---
Just have fun playing says me.  I had about 3500 hours on my old rs2 account and wasnt even as progressed as I am in osrs.  Being efficient can be pretty miserable, sometimes.
---
Maybe if you're a casual. Obviously it's not preferred, but get over it
---
oh, just checked your history. you're literally just shitting on rendi on a blank reddit account. whoops, shouldn't have engaged the troll. gl with life dude.
---
No.
---
Quote me calling them "shit" please
---
Those were regular accounts by that CLONE WARS guy. I think he would stack venge or something
---
If you want to have fun in this game make an ironman or disregard every piece of content thats bad gp/h
---
I'm also worried that their "fix" doesn't exactly cover the whole problem. I have a feeling that the servers may still be crashed in other ways, still resulting in accounts rolled back, which means duplicated gold. I'm sure at least this situation has them more aware, and on their toes looking for more possible gold dupes though
---
How about you just get the 5 str/att levels for your defender
---
Very misleading name in that case
---
We have to know, was it on an iron?
---
I've never done CoX before, when can I expect to be able to just run in and kill these guys for a lock pick before leaving?
---
Did it work? Did the newspaper give you 500m for no absolute reason after you dropped your bank on the floor?
---
You can brute force a kill yeah but it will take hours
---
Just drink a glass of water and get some rest King, you need it
---
haha i wish
---
staff occult cape is 73, add torm brace its 76 and if u add tome its 78
---
and that's all on a pure
---
yeah, the base damage should definitely scale from 75 to post 99 going off effective level, be only usable in melee range and should be good
---
thats one of the best parts of the set. breathes some fresh air into acc builds. its not powercreeping anything really so whats the big deal
---
&gt;Clueless people, like you, yes.  Those people wouldn't even know where to start with crashing a server
---
Haha alright buddeh. Or maybe everybody doesn't follow the OSRS reddit every day? :D
---
&gt;literally
---
:D
---
This dude ain't wrong tbh. People are just over reacting. BP is still the most broken thing is the game yet no one complains about that
---
i love how it looks
---
How does that not matter?.. Rarer than an arcane, harder to get than an arcane, so why should it not be better than an arcane? dumdum.
---
&gt;Haha alright buddeh. Or maybe everybody doesn't follow the OSRS reddit every day? :D
---
No, I learned about this from elsewhere, though there was also plenty of (censored) traffic on here about it.  Again, no one who learned about this from Rendi's video will be able to duplicate it.  I think you're beginning to understand you're wrong since the :Ds are coming out in full force.
---
Show me on the doll where the mods hurt your feelings, poor baby :(
---
Just remember all pets are equally as useless :)
---
shutup windowlicker
---
No idea how many times i've clicked too fast while doing a farm run and not refilled my vial - good update.
---
Not at all
---
It is and has been for a decent time.
---
Your email may be compromised
---
Think we found the real reason for your hate post.
---
But it's not...  and plenty of people use vanilla.
---
So this is that blue whale game all the kids been talkin' bout!!!
---
I think if the armour was better then obsidian but worse then bandos for str then it would be perfect and pass.
---
Glad I could.belp most videos don't ever show chins cus it's a high-level strategy
---
Rendis video did nothing to get the glitch fixed as it was fixed already at the time of posting.  Him creating the video was a transparency move in part but also an ego stroking move at the same time.  Apparently the transparency part was effective and much needed.  Him making the video and releasing it after the bug was patched, acting dramatic like it was going to cost him everything was a bullshit ego stroking, whoa is me move.  
---
He wasn't creating copycats after the fact as the issue was likely fully addressed.  
---
Though I did enjoy the information in the video I rolled my eyes off the bat when he said he was putting his career on the line for releasing a video about a fixed bug.
---
Hardly, making bis lower level is idiotic, it's part of the dislike of tbow being t75 when it clearly is t85-t90
---
I'll be voting it down, I'm sure it wont hit 75% in it's current state and only appears to pvp.
---
I mean its broken either way its just more broken for different combat brackets
---
Good for Rendi for raising the issue, but i rolled my eyes a few times watching the video. He simply got overly excited by the fact that HE was the one to report the bug, and thought he was entitled to special treatment from Jagex for it. Dupe glitches happen all the time in runescapes history, his ego took full control in his video, and I do feel that he thought this would make him the king of osrs in the eyes of the community, and would benefit his channel.
---
Wait what?

I agree that I don't really like the appearance of the staff, it looks too much like a flail with one of those incense burners they use in churches which is hard to imagine being used in combat - it should look like a proper staff a dark wizard would use. I agree that the staff in [this reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dh7cpz/the_nightmare_of_ashihama_reward_nightmare_staff/) looks cleaner and more Runescape-y.
---
Ooooo
---
But is it true?
---
Fuckkkk. I literally just did 800 bones over the few hours before the update haha.
---
No, because both are caused by many accounts in close proximity sending many requests to the server.
---
The fact that it was attacking and switching gear instead of trying to pick up a few items doesn't make it different "bugs". 
---
It might need several different ways to patch it, though.
---
As by your logic, both the attacking eachother and switching gears would be different bugs.
---
Next could be lots of accounts fletching or alching close to eachother.
---
What do you mean is it true :s log in and check lol
---
Does anyone know if the sound effect for Giant Bats (as seen in Deep Wildy near Mage Arena) is the same as the Drunken Dwarf whistle? They sound very similar.
---
Yeah and I wonder why?
---
Big if
---
I'm talking about the twisted leagues so gear would be pretty much terrible... what are the usual rate for leeching a team do you have an idea?
---
So I guess trying to brute force with with full rune and a whip isn't a viable option?
---
Rename that to "Absolute Chad Headgear"
---
Stuff on tourney world isn't transferred to the regular game.
---
Ikr, I was stoked for that one
---
Why not make the magic off-hand tome a "Dark Blessing" that can be used on either the Magic Book or Arcane Spirit Shield, granting the item +5 magic accuracy, +4% magic damage, and -5 prayer?  That would avoid devaluing either item and would give more options for the drop too.
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
Almost funny.
---
it has definitely became a necessity now when playing. i couldn't imagine not having loot tracker or the tracker for your herbs/trees/birdhouses. 
---
As we have all said before the vanilla client really should have these QoL updates man.
---
You're looking at it from the wrong angle. Imagine dropping everything you're doing to investigate an exploit in a children's medieval point and click adventure game that you could abuse yourself to earn literally thousands of real dollars. After taking the time to look into the problem, you choose to immediately expose the bug instead of sell/abuse it and you get zero reward and no acknowledgment.
---
He acted selflessly for the most part, I think it's very reasonable for him to share what happened because the bug is so difficult to exploit. Sure it's slightly dramatised, but that doesn't change the fact that he has forgone huge amounts of real USD to make the game a better place. I don't blame him for wanting a response.
---
Bro i saw people with tbow and like infernal cape and stuff??? i dont even have fire cape yet but i dont want to cheat for it
---
This may be an unpopular opinion but my issue wasnt how mod Bolton was a bore when discussing NDA's or how they talked about the bug rendi brought up. It's the fact as a paying member of this community, seeing the kind of revenue jagex brings in, and this bum cant address the community without taking his candy or whatever out of his damn mouth.  I'm a paying member, I dont think I should have to listen to someone sucking their saliva down their throat while talking. Its disrespectful and disgusting. I handled this knuckleheads savory sucking of saliva for 10mins and for what, an over explained coached statement on NDAs? This company has shown time and time again on this downhill snowball effect that will be the end of them.
---
I used to never use my ectophial because I thought you had to do the buckets of slime and grind bones thing to refill it
---
*thanos snap*
---
[deleted]
---
He paid them with donations from the community though; I'd still consider that acquiring
---
Then there's me who hasn't got a single clue drop, 60 in all combat, 45 wc, 50 fishing
---
I think the 12th. Actually a good idea
---
There are some worlds where you can spawn any item in. Do whatever you want. But when you log off of that world everything is deleted out your inv.

Without runelite, I'm sure I'd slowly stop playing. Its just so convenient and helpful
---
that's the meme bro
---
He’s a rendi fanboy. And he thinks Jagex themselves censor THIS subreddit. What a goofball.
---
Fuck them. Be proud.
---
Well there’s obviously speculation of when group Ironman will be out and when the next league will be, but it would be nice
---
This should have been introduced natively. But looks clean and glad it's done. Once again another 3pc doing jagex job. Good job runelite.
---
People will downvote you because they may not be thinking on neutral stance.
---
&gt;At the time, within Jagex there was "disquiet about the pay levels for developers", meaning that when careless senior veep Hamza Mudassir left a copy of his mother-in-law's visa application on an office printer, complete with his own salary details on it, news spread quickly. McCambridge first saw it at 7am, later pointing it out to a passing colleague – the "only person" he told that day about it, as the tribunal judges found.
---
&gt;he was on at least 10x other employees
---
&gt;has people fired because he was misusing the office printer to print personal effects
---
Oh, damn, I have similar stats!  Thanks for the motivation to try this quest sooner rather than later! Quest cape here I come!
---
Finally saved up enough to buy a Dragon Hunter Lance, curious about which attack styles to use and when. For stuff like Rune Dragons and Vorkath it seems obvious to use it on Stab, because most dragons are weak to stab and that's my highest stat generally while using it, but are there circumstances where you should switch it to crush or slash?
---
Seeing as you use it for everything in CoX I figured maybe for things like Tekton you might be better of switching it to crush instead. Is that suspicion true? Or do y'all always just leave it on the stab option?
---
He’s been commenting on every thread. Obviously trying to farm out the good boi points so he can cash in on some juicy tendies
---
Since showing up is half the battle I would say the moment you log in :):)
---
That's what's up my dude
---
I would focus on completing dragon slayer quest. 
---
To start dragon slayer quest you need access to champions guild. Guild unlock once you get 32 quest points. So the best would be to check quest list in game and see what quests you can do.
---
I mean it still is probably empty in your inv between your character refilling it
---
Who doesn’t remember?
---
Didnt they specifically say in a Q&amp;A a few years ago that they wouldn't do this?
---
and yet russian oligarchs do it anyway :(
---
Gonna copypaste what I've already said in the counterarguments page (how does it feel to know I'm literally debunking you with a template?):
---
" I assure you that I don't have particularly negative or positive opinions of Rendi, I just like what he did yesterday, something my opinion of him does not change. Similarly, your opinion of me has no bearing on what I'm saying or my point and is just an ad hom. "

What kind of Facebook bot reads the YouTube video channel and slaps a cute girl sticker on the profile pic???

---
My point is not that I'm advocating for making it relevant to snowflake accs. I'm just saying whether it's 30 or 70 really only matters if you have a snowflake account. Nobody is playing this game and buying a Scythe with level 30 def, except he specifically set this as his goal or owns a main acc. So what I am saying is that def reqs don't matter, since it only affects snowflakes.
---
He is, but only trending, like me
---
I wish more people would just shut the fuck up about XP rates.  Of all games to be irritated at not being hyper efficient/competitive, it's the one with the longest, most soul crushing grind.  I play shooters to be competitive, I play slower games to kick back and watch videos to.  I really get bothered when someone tells me that I'm wasting my time chopping yews when I could be whatever ticking teaks or something.  Just let me chill dude.
---
Nice cock in my ass
---
are you using the gpu plugin and if you are, are you sure that your 1070 is the gpu actually running runescape and not the i5 integrated
---
He's either imagining it or he saw it on a fake gold site.
---
I posted it twice and both times I was accused of being a crybaby who wants to "make obtaining pets easier" despite currently having grinded ~50M exp post-max just for skilling pets. So... no thanks.
---
I don't think reporting bots helps Jagex find RTWers. People being falsely banned for RTW have pretty much shown that Jagex has some kind of algorithm that tracks gold trades and flags potential RTW for review.
---
I think his video was good to show what actually happened but the parts when he felt like Jagex owed him personally an explanation felt a bit wrong. Overall I would say, good video but he came across, I don't know, I don't want to say egotistical because I didn't get that vibe but more that he thought he deserved a personal message from Jagex over the issue was a bit annoying.
---
... You win this time
---
I honestly don't understand why I get so much shit for being Ironman.. It makes me completely immune to giving a fuck about ANY of the 'drama' that happens around here. Yet I get made fun of for it literally daily 🙄
---
Yes, Morytania would be off-limits, as well as the elven city, and using Zulrah as a bank. It would be extremely difficult to play, and require absolutely minimal teleports other than minigame and home teleport AND amulet of glory mounted in a POH (all that I could think of). I have given this idea a lot of thought, and I really want to try it.
---
You really want the logs lol? Where should I post them
---
Any good tips for mobile players?
---
Thanks! Also side note. How would I go about obtaining steel tools? I see them in my unlocks but I don’t know how to even get steel. Is it like real life or is there some special method?
---
this dood gonna ags spec Kraken  :')
---
&gt;Or do you think the game would be better if we still only had barrows items and whips?
---
It would.
---
Magic does not need to be overpowered.
---
Spoon feed conditioning can be evil rather than beneficial
---
Birdhouses are fun
---
I'm talking about a player buying a couple hundred mils and buying bonds with them from unknowingly duped money.
---
Waiting to go home so I can try to get back into this game instead of just stalking to sub.
---
It took you 10 years to get the reqs for mm.. but gz
---
Thanks for the tip! I know this is probably a common question around this sub and I am glad that you took the time to answer!
---
He need some milk.
---
&gt; It was our own u/JagexOsborne who spearheaded the firing apparently
---
Quote from OP on crosspost. Dear oh dear what a mess.
---
I totally do the last one... My bank is pitiful and all I do is slave away at Skilling and Zulrah.
---
Bots? What? It’s a skilling clan called Solace
---
Happy 🦃 day!!!
---
Can someone tag the head of esports at Jagex pls?
---
They can hit 7s, I'm sure at least one unattentive skiller has died to them. RIP
---
Theres been literally two other posts. I dont sub to only this subreddit, excuse me for missing those 1 out of 100 posts a day?
---
&gt;This can hit it from 10 tiles away, ags can not
---
who care if u can hit from 10 tiles away on slayer task?
---
for context the video this comment was linked to was of two people using the staff in pvp, one tripple eats on tick and the other hits back to back 80s
---
the tripple eater cant survive
---
their opinion may be exaggerated but it's kind of right, the stuff about staff members aside.
---
What relics are you using?
---
That's some good pasta right there
---
If bonds could drop by about half yeah that’d be great people
---
why not just rename Eldritch to something that doesn't begin with the letter e?
---
I'd rather have Staff of Nightmares(h/v/\_) than Harmonized/Volatile/Eldritch Nightmare Staff.
---
its called torva, pernix and virtus
---
Still gotta kill a bear
---
Nice anecdotal experience. Not everyone will fuck up like you did
---
[https://imgur.com/LZiNc7P](https://imgur.com/LZiNc7P)  
---
They're even higher than what you're posting, unless I'm wrong
---
i mean theres kinda a gap isnt there? magic both doesnt have any dps weapons or any ko weapons- kinda limits pvp when an entire combat style is so gated on its utility that ALL it can do is barrage/tb/veng
---
Same. This man was speaking like some whistle blower journalist who is about to seek asylum from Jagex. It's a bug in an ancient point and click game lmao, chill
---
He means that the new staff + max mage would be 1b+ in all likelihood, since jmods compared it to tbow/scythe when designing it
---
Happened to me too, dude named droopy maxed ironman with infernal, told him to fuck off
---
... except this is very different. You’re commenting on a twitter video about pvp. Let me know who pks with a scythe and tbow? Magic is the least damage on the combat triangle for a reason. Teleblocks and freezes. Doesn’t matter the price of it, people already pk in full ancestral, ely / arcane. Dbow isn’t comparable to this either. You can eat between the hits for one, and also requires 2 rolls to hit a 48-48. Go buy a dbow and let me know how many specs it takes you before you double max.
---
I find Zalcano to be a pretty fun way to make money. Maybe get caught up on quests and get song of the elves done, then give it a shot?
---
With a 4 person team I was averaging 200k a kill not counting crystals, since I don’t have a DHCB yet it seems like Zalcano is better gp/hr than vork
---
Trees make logs so trees are logical. Since you're teleporting to a massive tree its more logs so more logical.
---
💦💦💦
---
I'll give you my tip
---
&gt; power creep
---
where? cannon is 10 times better than this staff for slayer
---
To hit the new staff's max hit, you'd have to be using full ancest, MA2 cape, occult, tormented, new tome and new staff...  
---
Ignoring the new gear, you're already over 150m.. New staff + orbs, plus new tome atleast for the first 6 months post release, will be massively expensive, as Scythe/tbow was on release, so your risk, with full max mage will be 1.5b+ easily
---
I mean... why not? It’s not that much less xp fly fishing and dropping. Or 3 tick fly fishing
---
It doesn't affect either streak? Wtf
---
LMFAO
---
Wait what.... you can’t make silver necklaces anymore?
---
Idk it closes after its use like the golden snitch
---
It’s fine how it is. It’s not hard to get the 120 combined levels at all.
---
They mean between leagues, not the main game.
---
I see no issues with that so long as collection logs don’t have point values.
---
Yeah i saw the clip. Still over dramatic, there's a reason why it's in beta testing.
---
People just love to say "reee jagex" no matter what, rather than be constructive lol
---
You didn’t understand my comment.
---
Dupe -&gt; Sell gold -&gt; Everyone banned and gold removed
---
The gold has already been sold, so it affects the prices of rwt gold. But the gold is then removed, which means that it doesn’t affect the osrs economy.
---
Yeah I mean it’s crazy how limited magic is.. like you can only teleblock your opponent, freeze for a full 15 second on mage pray and hit 46’s with fire surge. Fuck it, we need a new off hand 10% damage increase, and maybe a staff that can hit what the ags does and faster. /s 
---
On a real note, look at the reactions of people that actually pk, that should tell you all you need to know about how grossly op the staff is and how unneeded it is.
---
Rwt is against the rules anyway so then can just ban the player if they buy gold
---
I'm feeling this witch king look
---
Omg be careful
---
Yes but  that would fall under a major content clause and that plus the rat on tutorial island would be the two things I would ever kill
---
Are you looking for a specific tip? Overall I’d just say practice makes perfect. I’ve been playing on mobile for over a year
---
In stories, people have a very easy time believing the impossible, and a hard time believing the improbable. "Opening a seed pod or pouring out a vial of goo makes me teleport? Okay sure." "That sci-fi soldier has a gun that fires deadly lasers? Okay sure." People are coming into things with a suspension of disbelief that lets them accept fantastical elements as a matter of fact. But then you introduce questions like "How do they power the laser guns?" or "Why doesn't my ectophial run out of slime?" and the fantastical matters of fact start lacking internal consistency and suddenly your brain starts trying to look too hard for logical answers.
---
And that goes both ways as well...? 
---
An experienced brid is going to be able to counter and read the other opponent. 
---
It’s a lot easier to predict and defend against mage &amp; range from distance.
---
Whats your end goal?
---
If you think this is in any way comparable to what you're suggesting, you've hit your head too many times hahahaha
---
Its almost like there is a difference between being able to hit a 82 from a screen away and having to be in meele range for it (completely ignoring the fact that magic defense is incredibly rare in most pvp setups).
---
Will be fun when chinhunters cry on this subreddit that pvp should be disabled because they get spectraded by a clan again and this time their bulwark couldnt protect them
---
Over 110B gold successfully duplicated due to a bug last week. Watch Rendi's video if you want to learn more
---
just don’t die dummy
---
Oh I know that, and no one would say it carries to the main game, but across the leagues it would be cool
---
Thieving is a Gatherer skill.
---
I reckon the only reason his videos are so spaced out is because it takes him this long to get 10 minutes of happy sound bites
---
The gold was not removed lol
---
no- using OPs stats (82 attack 90 str) if he DOESNT have anguish bp is .03 dps better at 0 dwh specs, if he does have anguish it's .25 dps (8.5% better)- this difference is about the same regardless of bandos defense reduction. this is using a rag range bless dhide setup with addy darts. 
---
bandos is one of those places where bp is just overpowered. i mean obviously you are right to recommend melee given his stats- its close enough to where melee having spec would make it even-ish kill time wise with considering bp cost but you are definitely wrong about range only being good with high range and rigour.
---
September was the OSB making two click actions one click through plugin. It affected several skilling methods but the biggest controversies over it were blackjacking, wildy chaos altar, and construction, making it so instead of having to right click and then left click on the option you wanted, all you had to do was just left click on the menaphite thug/altar/building hotspot. 
---
October was about the basilisk knights that were buffed only 6 six days after release because max level players were complaining they were too easy to kill even though the monster was made with med level players in mind. The buff made a potentially profitable task and turned it into a task that just isnt worth the time and effort (similar to drakes now) unless you get extremely lucky with a jaw drop.
---
I honestly don't even know haha
---
Hold up
---
WITH 2 INVENTORY SPOTS!

Inb4 some high rank HCIM rushes towards the phasmatys bank for an antidote only to die to poison with 1 tick margin due to being forced to refill the vial during that 1 tick^^^^this ^^^^will ^^^^never ^^^^happen ^^^^but ^^^^it ^^^^would ^^^^be ^^^^funny ^^^^as ^^^^shit
---
What?
---
Ideally everyone does those on the same world. It seems like you are contradicting urself and/or have no clue what you are talking about
---
Good meme
---
Ok then it’s evidence of bad work. There’s YouTube videos of this happening from 8 months ago. 8 months for a game breaking glitch and they didn’t fix it. So they either didn’t do anything, or they did a bad job trying to fix it. Either way they still dropped the ball.
---
Is there a legal argument to shutting these websites down or was this just corporate strong arming?
---
Putting it in raids seems really random?
---
Anyway if you're one of those people who are going to complain that spent xxx hours getting one, you're a moron for wasting so much time going after so little league points in the first place.

I don’t think you’ll find something like swampletics since most people don’t wait 2 months between videos haha
---
73 from far away is insane! The staff should be more like a dds spec.. we dont currently have a mage spec wep please dont make the first one much more powerful than an ags...

Not a pet you see to often in public, I'm actually gonna go for elite diary so I can get it

&gt; it’s a real shame that companies allow bad practices like this.
---
People will do exactly what they think they can get away doing regardless of the law. We should be happy that the court ruled the way it did because we can have some confidence that society isn't completely fucked.
---
There are much worse crimes people get away doing all the time, but at least this one wasn't swept under the rug like Jamflex wanted.
---
ayyy this one went through
---
https://twitter.com/deyegenerate/status/1200021108570722304?s=21 take a look at the comments.. I think they’re commenting on it.
---
Seriously, same. Once you let go of any concern of effeciency, maxing, profit, etc and just play the damn game it's such a great experience. I don't underhand why I get made fun of literally daily for being Ironman
---
Nice man. I did it on RS3 and a couple months ago OSRS. Now i need to do MM2
---
We love you dude, keep trying
---
Sween stated it's an ongoing issue. From the comments here, it seems people have discovered the dupe fix is just a bandaid fix preventing multiple players from crashing a single server. If there were another exploit that could force a server crash, the dupe may still occur.
---
This means Jagex wants to stop the rollback to last login on server crash first because that is the underlying issue. As long as that exists, it would have been dangerous to let the playerbase know because more minds looking for server crash exploits means the faster a new crash to continue this dupe may be found.
---
Remember, if you have a leak, you put tape over it and then call people to fix the actual leak. You don't just ignore it, tell everyone it has been dealt with and hope it's ok. The difference here is that telling us too much would make things harder for Jagex with no net gain because no one here works at Jagex or understands their engine.
---
20m is about 15 minutes of irl work lol
---
TBH if I was jagex I would remove the posts as well. The 110b prob won't hurt economy that much, but reddit outrage culture is absolutely unbearable.
---
Mad dogs have u ever tried pvp this weapon would be so op its insane
---
Maybe you don’t like the game
---
Probably because more dps (and thus more/faster kills) is more interesting to watch live than seeing the same 5 steps repeated for hours, while seeing the big dopamine clue openings are really cool content to see on youtube.
---
Is there going to be some sort of nightmare pet drop?
---
Rapier is commonly used by 75 attack zerks with a dds or dmace as a k/o weapon. It has a higher initial investment cost but that combo is equally as viable as an ags for a 75 attack zerk.
---
The point is that it doesn’t upset PvP. It can put out a lot of damage but you’re still on even grounds with the people you’re fighting, gp != an advantage when it comes to the rapier.
---
It’s also very popular among 75 attack pures for training and safe PvP such as castle wars or clan wars.
---
I don’t pvm well, I have a very shit slayer level, I got the level required  to afk cave horrors for money and pretty much stopped there.
---
I have several different pures I use often for pure PvP, and I’m telling you that if I had this weapon on my tsotd pure it would be overpowered. The people I would be up against would be at a massive disadvantage.
---
One post, 1 (one) post. Just one.
---
Sulliuscep mushroom cutting benefits GREATLY from having a lot of people in the world cutting them. Each mushroom is instances per person and a lot of people helps keep the paths clear for faster runs and even splits the damage from the tar beasts up among multiple players which decreases how much food each player uses and how long each trip can last.
---
Yeah he probably logged on only a handful of times in those 10 years considering he only has like 7 million xp. Realistically the title should say played osrs for a couple hours of gameplay and just finished MM 10 years later.
---
It’s still necessary for a hard diary task, and the diary rewards are pretty nice.
---
No I haven't done it. I looked at that calculator when I first started but I'm just not seeing it. I'm pretty good at going at least every few days, there was on little mishap with a villager but we've moved past that. I'm collecting about 2k coal every time I go.
---
Yes, before today the only workaround was to lure the wizard away so someone else could spawn a new one.
---

---
This guy clearly doesn't even raid.  It'll more than likely slow down CM's seeing as you'll have to get lucky to get the lockpick early on killing scavs.
---
I feel ya, iv been doing all the things I never did back in the day and it's awsome
---
Ur still owed 1 more lol
---
I think all herbs are at least 20gp or so profit cleaning them. Thing is it's boring, shit xp and there's usually better ways to earn GP.

People already do, it’s not like low level pures are usually funded from the ground up. It’s not like my tsotd pure went out to kill kril and zulrah.
---
If it’s tradable then it will be used and abused by people who even have the base requirement to wield it.
---
This guy fucks
---
PoH pool or clan wars portal?
---
Ya u gain 3 lvls for blk and 6 for mith but at that point u just goto rune and fck it lol and inly a point of two extra damage from the upgrade to weapons
---
You are mentally ill if you think a bottle neck as big as grinding imps for a item as easy to obtain as a lockpick was a good idea.
---
The biggest problem is the save state mechanic, not the method used to crash the worlds. There's more than 1 way
---
\*grumble grumble\* back in my day I had to manually fill up my Ectophial and not forgetting to fill it up made me a better player. You osrs millennials have it so easy smh.
---
But...that’s the kind of shit that makes osrs interesting.
---
Less thinking
---
Post it on your reddit profile.
---
Shouldn’t have died
---
You would have to be 15hp and 1 prayer for what you just described to be possible and you would be risking a staff that will probably cost 1b.
---
Set a pin before you rebuild
---
I mean, snape grass is strictly better but much more costly than watermelons. If you're on a very tight budget I'd stick with melons. If not, snape grass. You can break-even/profit pretty easily with your level, but it's risky.
---
No one cares
---
Hold my tinfoil I'm going in
---
Not sure if I want to have my character go full main or stay at a point where I can PvP in edge with kinda lower bracket stuff. Currently only have about 20M so I'm not super rich.
---
The stats right now are
---
1. 70 atk
---
2. 72 str
---
3. 70 def
---
4. 72 hp
---
5. 70 prayer
---
6. 77 range
---
7. 91 magic
---
8. 90 Combat
---
Last night I was NMZ'ing my str and trying to decide if it would be worth getting 75 atk or staying 70 while focusing on strength and doing PvP stuff.
---
Quest wise I've completed everything so I have all those unlocks. Also not sure if with these stats I'm capable of doing Zulrah or Vorkath efficiently. I wouldn't mind trying to get the Vorkath drop for accumulator, and if I hit 100 combat I'd definitely go for elite void. Right now I haven't bothered only because I'm not 100 combat for the diary.
---
I assume you're meaning 75 att/str which yea they could do but that's pretty absurd to just slap t75 reqs on this t65 weapon and 75 strength on a staff? lol
---
Imo making the base damage scale from something like 40 at lv65 to 58 at 99 would be a lot better. That'd mean the maxhit at low tiers with staff+occult would be 50 scaling upto 73 with the rag gear at 99 and then with full ancestral on top upto 82.
---
I bet it's nowhere near as popular since Jagex came out with the official stance on AHK.
---
One guy on this sub posted a vid of his script that banked and one ticked cleaning herbs whilst he held down the "1" key.
---
You think these are all the same person?
---
Haha XD
---
Love the staff. Let's all just keep in mind nobody will be pking with it in all BIS gear, you cannot use veng, and ags hits a 76 with a strenght amy as risk.
---
The staff is t75
---
Dds? you do realize that the staff comes from End-game group boss. not an easy item to get, also it's price will be extremely high so i doubt any low level Mages will be running around with that staff in Pvp.
---
Banging 7 gram rocks gets expensive, especially if your finishing em too.
---
I'm curious if you saw that we reduced the damage % to 4% and gave it negative defensive bonuses. But thanks for the feedback anyway  it could just be that the learning experience from this is we shouldn't touch adding better versions of corp rewards
---
There are a lot of pures, zerkers and other similar account builds who go for 99 slayer. It's not that many people total (probably at most a thousand or so), but it's also a tiny change, so why not?
---
&gt;I didn't do smite
---
Damn, sure missed out! Could've smited an AGS from that training dummy!
---
About tree fiddy
---
It really does suck for your friends that abusing glitches of the game engine to get advantages pvm is considered cool and skillful, but if you abuse some glitches to create useless novelty accounts you can end up perm banned if someone you know gets into some jmods crosshair.
---
Just a forewarning those controllers are like herpes. Forever.
---
Fire Max :joy:
---
I do everything except armadyl on mobile lol. I’ve currently done around 2200~ kraken and thermy kills and ~850 hydra kills all on mobile. Mobile ain’t too bad

Or how about magic based melee telling you they attack based on your magic defence against people in metal armour
---
I'm just salty I spent 4 hours doing something that now takes 15min.
---
Oh I didn't say I didn't like the idea. I'm just saying it's unlikely going to get much traction.
---
This is pretty legal here in the US. If anything this is more frequent here than across the pond. You can be fired for nearly anything. 
---
The U.S. has security funds for those who lose their jobs this way, but you losing the job is legal most cases.
---
same here
---
Then enjoy it. Because yesterday they all left, nobody could find a match in 1 hour. So they just did casual and the ones who wanted comp left
---
Am i wrong or is that not oakdice saying how good itd be and him just agreeing?
---
I did see that. The negative defensive bonuses mean very little, especially in scenarios like COX and TOB where skill is more important than defence. I also believe that the damage % of 4% is still ultimately destroying the arcane spirit shields usefulness. 
---
The one BIS item from Corp for many scenarios is the arcane. The ely is a niche item, used for tanking and infernal mainly. The spectral is only used at Cerberus. Both of them have passive effects.
---
I struggle to think of any scenario in which the arcane would be better than the sirens tome under these proposed changes. I think for long zulrah trips possibly, but even then the zulrah meta is tbow now, and those who can’t afford tbow likely won’t be able to afford the sirens tome upgrade. 
---
With all of what I’ve just mentioned I really think the only item from Corp that is used in a variety of situations as a BIS will be destroyed. As Corp is one of the most nostalgic bosses, and should have at least one item serving a purpose across the game, I’ll be voting no.
---
You do realize the DDS hits higher than the AGS, right? It just has lower accuracy due to a lower base Attack Bonus and 25% modifier compared to a Godsword's doubling of the accuracy. But seeing as this is on a dummy that always hits your max, that number would go up if it were like the DDS even if it is were less accurate.
---
Hi! So, as the other individual indicated, I have received a message from Jagex’s message center saying they’ve processed payment. They’re also indicating in my account details that I “need to update my card details” while they’re “attempting payment.” It is in attempting to update my card details that I get the message “your subscription is through Apple. Here’s how to cancel it.”
---
Well, Apple refuses the refund, ostensibly because I’m past the automated grace period. I’ll probably have to call after the holiday. But having worked in tandem with the iTunes Store when I worked for a call center on the tech side, I can tell you that it is 100% going to rely on their good side that I’m not trying to defraud anyone in a game whose subscription system they are not obligated to understand. I’m not holding my breath.
---
I can’t very well dispute the charge through my credit card company, because I made the purchase in good faith. Even if I ignored that, it would put my Apple iTunes Account AND my Jagex account into an unfinished payment scenario.
---
Or at least, that is what the community, my experiences, and Jagex’s articles are pointing to. And since I have no way to reach out to Jagex in a way that matters, because there’s not even an email I can get to for personal review, and I’m not a “content creator” that gets them attention, I’m out $30.00 with nothing to show for it, and if I want to keep playing this game, I have to shell out yet more money to keep playing in the meantime. Not likely.
---
I am sad, frustrated, and probably should be thankful that this experience is shunting me off from this game, whether I want that or not.
---
Unless you’re an Ironman, just sell it on GE and then use that money to buy more compost. 
---
If you’re an Ironman.... you signed up for this lol
---
Use a watering can on the demonic gorilla before it dies and you'll get it in 100 kills
---
DM being sent now.
---
It is high, the dds only hits that high because it hits twice. 
---
If this spec hit twice it would do 188 damage
---
Except the fact mage freezes for 15 seconds
---
Yeah he agrees it would be a good video to make for views?
---
King Roald
---
Vorkath is an obvious one with your range level instead of blue dragons
---
It's ironic that a business wants you to use their services instead of others?
---
Omg yes! Yes please!!!!
---
Seems like a stretch to say thats evidence of him doing it for the purpose of views just rather then agreeing with him, idk guess i just see it different
---
Ohh they look sick now, love it!
---
Back to Cerb I go :)
---
same -- both runelite and mobile osrs app are down for me.
---
Thanks for the summary. I remember reading about a lot of these actually. Warding failing is pretty sad, pretty much confirms there will never be a new skill in OSRS.
---
What stats would it give you?
---
Bond market doesn't flood the game with botted resources.
---
Seems like a question you should send into the q&amp;a. I don’t see a problem with it.
---
Hehe
---
The Cat Mage is a level 58 Wizard
---
(and ice barrage is 20 seconds)
---
Nice
---
If it makes you feel better, the lockpick has a small chance to break depending on thieving level.
---
This isn't true at all for the artifacts, of course, but before you read this far you probably felt better about it.
---
I love how you just completely omitted half the entire sentence from the wiki (the part that proves the point I've been making this entire time)
---
Yet another display of an inability to be logically consistent.
---
Lucky..I always put a tbow or scythe on my alt and wait for these guys to approach but it never happens to me :(
---
Except the bond money keeps the game you know and love, alive.
---
They real problem is that I can craft a full suit of Adamant(ium) armor, forge an axe made of pristine crystals, but a slight bend in a random stick of wrought iron? Impossible.
---
Fine I will keep responding lol, you seem like a chill guy tbh and that was dumb for me to say. It just peeves me as I just don't understand how all of this info gets completely morphed. The jmods NDA threatened the entire channel for the first time in... ever, and only after a dupe was mentioned. That was really my only source of criticism, (censorship) and that likely some possible reddit mods under their thumb of censorship. Everything else was said in justifying my actions of spamming general etc. I guess one other source of criticism in the video of the jmods  I said for about 2 seconds before leaving it was that they don't really respond to my pms about basic unrelated questions as well in the designated private server for it, which kind of added to me just leaving and not having use for the Discord. But you can see even in the summary of the entire video though at the end the only thing I didn't agree with was the censorship of their video.
---
I mean except it isnt gambling according to Jagex, and its a crucial important part of the game.  I don't understand why people who don't like the duel arena just don't go there
---
Pretty depressing, yeah. In an at-will employment state, you can be fired for pretty much any reason at any time. Was just thinking about it as I read the article.
---
Shame on you. the man's just trying to provide, you should give it back and maybe a little extra for his troubles.
---
Also, bring chaps instead of avas if you gonna 2 way switch for range.
---
That guy won't be able to feed his family because of you. Happy Thanksgiving!
---
This is why you wait until the end of the month to update the drama calendar. This shit is way worse than the faux drama Rendi tried to stir up.
---
Probably for the better lol, don’t take any chances
---
One promotes botting, the other promotes helping people to get membership without paying :-)
---
I had no ads
---
EDIT: I, personally, had no ads while watching the video. No I am not /u/Rendimento , /u/TheInnocentPotato
---
Although I just realized that may be because of an ad block or something.
---
both accounts had over 70 agility, and the quest does recommend a higher agility (probably for the caves) even though you only need 55 to do it.
---
Again, they are profiting without consent. Copyright infringement specifically works best when a party is profiting from another part's work without consent.
---
Trading gold between players is fine because it is within the boundaries of the game - profiting from it in real life is not. That is actual copyright infringement with actual, legal right on Jagex's end to sue.
---
It may end in Jagex "strong-arming" gold sellers to force them to stop, but don't try to pretend for a second Jagex has no legal right in this instance.
---
Dude's name was John McCambridge. Poor guy.
---
literally cant play this game today
---
How is everyone being able to easily obtain an item not fair?
---
Looks like meats back on the menu boys!!
---
Because it is your choice to play the game? They locked the area to make it more difficult. You players want to be handed every little item to make it easier. Deal with it.
---
&gt; I'd do a billion other things than compete with a sweaty virgin for a lockpick.
---
Then go do them and stop bitching?
---
"Plus, all those who buy items and success devalue the achievements of legitimate players." Oh really? And bonds do what lol.  I'm for bonds but... the irony of that statement lmao
---
Its been around 600-700m for two months and a half now after the steep decline at the end of August
---
You're the one complaining they made it more practical to get lmfao all I'm asking is why is it so upsetting they put another way to get lockpicks in the game?
---
They weren't aware at all of what was happening I can tell you that for sure. They were aware of how rollbacks effected servers for years but not about the crashes going on
---
Lol
---
Here is a closer look at them.

Big congrats! I love to see people celebrating 99’s irl

Is it just me or does it make a sound now that it didn’t before?
---
I am talking about in video ads / sponsorships. If you don't put mid-roll ads YT won't sidebar your video
---
You don't need a degree though just a supple wrist. Plus them sailors tend to be pretty worked up and easy to satisfy.
---
Not all of them have that text. Try one that doesn't.
---
I use vanilla but it’s like 40% bc i’m too lazy to swap and 60% bc im too noided about losing my childhood account for any reason, and RL just feels like a threat to that lol. Definitely an unreasonable fear but what can ya do
---
They should put a tbow spawn in the game so we don't have to grind for it. Or or or they should put a lodestone at every location. They should move the rogues den to Zeah to get the lockpick!
---
Why do you feel the need that everything needs to be easy in a game where it takes 250 hours to get 99 fishing.
---
So Sween lied yesterday?
---
Tell me about how 11$ per month isn't enough to keep the game you know and love, alive and the excess money totally isn't going to the pockets of the higherups at jagex, for fucks sake, they fired a poor staff member illegally because he came across a document with a salary of the VP.
---
As long as it doesn't have a skill level requirement you can use any silver world.
---
DESIGNATED
---
I wasn’t to know he had that when I killed him an I normally bring chaps don’t c point much at rev caves though
---
If that is what he said then yes or he was most likely just referring to rollbacks not specifics on recent crashes
---
What I'm saying is "what if RWT didn't exist with no drawbacks or tools to stop it". And again, what I'm making fun of is the line that is marked. Come the fuck on, they are not ok with others buying gold while shamelessly selling it themselves and milking the live game.
---
Your forum chat badge indicates that you have membership.
---
What happens when you try to log in to a members world? Are you trying to log in to RS3 or OSRS. If OSRS, is it a normal server, or Twisted league?
---
I agree. Going dry for essential items on an iron is definitely shit, feel bad for the dude
---
Congrats, King!! Enjoy that sweet d scimmy.
---
I just looked at the graph on the Wiki, seems like it fell 300M in 3 months.
---
You just compared Tbow to the power of a lockpick.
---
I'm fucking done lmfao
---
Sorry if it comes off as harsh but I don't see how this has anything to do with what I said.
---
Lel so randum
---
Are these changes on the live server?
---
So, just a picture of conjecture.
---
Otherwise there is zero proof :/
---
Ahh, yes. Downvoted for not being irrational, and gullible.
---
Like an endurance normie has trained any skills beyond FM and Slayer
---
Rendi just keeps digging the whole.
---
I accept this defeat, and will leave my post up so I continue to look dumb. You got me this time!
---
f2p noob, someone explain pls?
---
Thank you, I don't think I knew that.
---
This meme is about those some people!
---
Thank fuck for that ay
---
Thanks King
---
lol what a bitch
---
Aw I’m actually sad now. I didn’t realize there was a big bass, I thought I was done
---
Yeah, I've never felt more fulfilled than during those Cerb tasks where I drop 2-3mil on prayer potions and get jack shit as a reward, everything in the game should be like that. Then I could finally quit and save my $11/month.
---
People say this garbage on this subreddit all the time, but Vorkath's consistent rewards don't cheapen how awesome it is to get a skeletal visage from him at all. There's absolutely nothing wrong with people wanting to earn decent rewards for their efforts while playing, and there's this weird disconnect between that and some members of the OSRS community. When Song of the Elves came out I argued that either Zalcano or The Gauntlet should have their drop table slightly buffed because the money from them wasn't great, and the other two GM level quests brought in Vorkath and Demonic Gorillas, which are some of the best moneymakers in the game. SoTE has even higher requirements than either of those two, but the stuff you unlock from it is immediately forgotten, and everyone's cool with that. It seems like a ton of people actually *want* everything to feel frustrating and unrewarding. Why?!
---
Because it's a containment site for smooth brained people to gather and echo chamber. 
---
Smart people don't go there.
---
Harvester makes herblore ezpz

I would track him down and give him some cash but he already got banned for Real world trading 😂

&gt;I didn't say that

Never said you did. Just pointing out you're acting like it is.
---
&gt;Sorry you camped 4hours at an imp spawn and now malding they made it more accessible to everyone else.
---
I don't play league. Just pointing out the unnecessary pandering to whining players such as yourself.
---
I'd say Twisted League is pretty damn fun, and that entails generally playing the game
---
This should have a picture of a buff guy behind a PC lol. It's all good man happens to the best of us redditors
---
Thanks a million my dude, I tried looking on my own, guess I'm blind. I'm seeing in another thread that a mod has confirmed he deleted his own post. What a shitty person...
---
My first fire cape I had the same thing happen to me lol. Took my rune darts out and started throwing them at jad. I even contemplated restarting with more scales but one of my close friends convinced me to stick it out. Next thing I knew I achieved my first cape :)  today I now am close to max w inferno completed when I never thought I’d even get past jad at one point in time. Anything is possible bro keep grinding and soon you will also have your own cape to cherish best of luck!
---
Got a d axe from wintertodt last night while just trying to get a Willow seed. Farmed for 5 hours overall until I got a Willow seed. I just wanted a fucking Willow seed man.
---
Thanks. :)
---
I don't play league soooooo.
---
he also spend a bil on the finder off the rcb imp
---
Yeah, would be nice to regain prayer this way hopefully the bug is fixed soon so we can figure out if it's balanced or not haha.
---
Jagex customer support is reddit and you’ll need at least 2-3k upvotes to get a response.
---
Yes, he most certainly did ! But some of these people mustve been on it for the hype and honour of actually tipping of the rcb.
---
Good luck affording that battle while unemployed and up against a corporate legal team.
---
Freedom! :)
---
I was expecting something kinda bad but this was on another level
---
Would be cool if this new boss isnt just untankable damage like ToB where you have to avoid things, or something like the inferno where if you miss a prayer you die.  Would be really nice if justiciar got some love, or tank mechanic in general.  Don't get me wrong, other mechanics are fine too, but I would really like to see a tank mechanic at some point in OSRS, even if its just a phase of the boss fight or something where it gets on 1 player and that player cant pray or something, would be cool to give the ely/bulwark another use outside of PvP tanking as well.  It'll be sad if its just another boss where you just take void and call it a day, I want somewhere to use the new raids tank gear.
---
LOL 😂😂😂 you’re 100% in the wrong in this argument bro
---
Now THATS a claw spec
---
That's a false equivalency and you know it, guy

Yes they do, rank[therankgoeshere][anythingtoindicateitsthefishingskillweretalkingaboutsuffixgoeshere]

Question does void work on chompies now?

99 fm-&gt;  99 all cmb -&gt; stop playing

nobody was scared to buy gold or bot in 2007.

Double spec claws is yikes anyways

For real! the irony lol
---
The problem is that the company is paying 96% in dividends, meaning that your support is nothing more than the investors guinea pig.

You get loot doing that or nah?

Only thing I missed during the downtime was the barbarian assault timer ;-;

Id make vannaka 1 slayer as well so people dont have to have done quests and shit to start getting slayer points

Starting slayer at 80+ combat stats seems oddly optimal right now

Id like people to get benefit out of doing a handful of mazchna tasks at low level

Damn, nice one!

Yeah was my first attempt on him, tomorrow he's mine!

ya prob shouldn't have made him a spartan. But helm gives it away that he isn't a mage

If you're color blind I imagine the red and blue ghosts still look almost identical at a glance.

Bruh i know the feel ive been playing since 04 and have never done MM XD
---
This guy is implying smart people go to r/2007scape to share their thoughts on updates
---
Yea I hate how both sides are just a huge circlejerk on the extreme ends.  
---
"Dramatic" is a very good word to describe the video.  It was good quality and the information in it was more or less exclusive.  Rendi definitely put himself on a bit of a pedestal and that's a criticism that I really think he should listen to, but other than that I don't think there's any reasonable gripes.
---
Also, the notion that more people are going to try and dupe because of the video might be true, however this being in the spotlight will force Jagex to find a longterm fix asap which is better in the long run.
---
Litterally unplayable
---
Or maybe the vanilla client is just outdated ass?
---
I mean, he on purpose sits in cc's in game chatting about exploits and bugs.  Wonder what he does on his alt accounts.
---
What was your work exactly? Do you work in a saltmines perhaps?
---
ITT: Reddit babies not happy finding out their idol is morally depraved. Big yikes.
---
Any chance we could please get an Aus tournament world?
---
You're joking right
---
Most people have had that range level forever.
---
Plain and simple, jagex managed to stop a major bot farm, causing scales to skyrocket.
---
Zulrah uniques are tied to scale value
---
He posts proof and you still just pussyfoot around it lol
---
thanks, yea i will probably join them to learn it at some point.  I have the stats and most of the gear, but just trying to wrap diaries at the moment and getting the extra 10% bloods while leveling RC would be nice
---
You know they could combine the griffins with the castle in the sky ideas and make them servants of Sara

Make him a Demi boss and that you have to be a female character to kill!

runelite destroyed all the magic of this game. teaching people to adhere to xp efficient shit is absolute cancer.
---
Bone Apple Tea'
---
I am not, why?
---
Cool post. Wonder if we'll see a resurgence of 30 def pures, although I still highly doubt their viability, even with this new set.
---
I know mm2 pures are kinda neat with 34 minimum defence and heavy ballista, but they're pretty shit tbh.
---
I don’t see how a company paying out dividends has anything to do with giving money towards the company rather than third parties.
---
Thank you, i posted some other achievements aswell if you are interested.
---
&gt; Jagex could've messaged him back, but they didn't. No big deal, they're not required. But him seeing the post deletion on Reddit plus the radio silence from jagex on such a major bug? 
---
rendi posted the chat logs (linked in this thread also) and as was seen there, rendi posted about it at 6am UK time and Jagex responded about 2h laters at 8am.
---
&gt; What else could he really think? 
---
that people aren't at work at 6am and he should wait till the workday starts?
---
A major zulrah bot farm was stopped, causing scales and general drops to rise in price.
---
Scales specifically are used in such vast quantities in bp/toxic staffs/serp helm that once a large source is depleted, scales skyrocketed in price due to demand
---
Zulrah uniques are tied to scale prices
---
Yeah if Player A cheats then Player B cant possibly be RWTing, selling infernal capes and duping gold. Thats literally impossible.
---
Aw fuck I teled out my first time. No wonder
---
McCambridge was then summoned to a separate disciplinary hearing – again, heard by David Osborne – and was duly sacked the following day for gross misconduct. Jagex accused McCambridge of not showing "remorse for your actions or consideration for the injured party, instead suggesting the blame is that of the party for leaving the information on the printer".
---
"Gross Misconduct" Haha.
---
Invalid, only slightly though, because you can't get barrows gloves at 30 def. I'm pretty sure the minimum is 41.
---
I do like the effort you put into this though.
---
For pvm does my defence determine whether i get hit or not at all? Would the number if i get hit just be random?
---
Maybe you can log out before it gets filled.
---
It's bad enough people beg at the GE.. Go play the game and buy your own bond.
---
I agree that calling someone a bitch for apologizing can't lead to anything good. But the way I read it, that's not what happened. 
---
I think they called Rendi a bitch because he was being a bitch about not winning the Golden Gnome, as witnessed in the [linked Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ddf7e7/rendi_not_happy_with_the_golden_gnome_outcome/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).
---
Jamflex trying to cover the 110B dupped with pets
---
That aint shit compared to my Knights sword
---
Yeah that's what I meant. You won't get banned for using it's client or features. While you're still at the grace of runelite devs for your data security. I would trust them over everyone else and potentially even Jagex.
---
The book looks insanely overpowered. +5 mage bonus over arcane and +4% magic damage... Sure it has large negatives but tbh I think that is too much. I would like to see the mage bonus reduced to 20 to match arcane. Book will still be bis with the dmg buff but will not be so much stronger.
---
Incredible, you're very talented. I would buy one of these if they were for sale.
---
The entire post is regarding zerker meta, not 30 def... uhm.. Meta? Lol
---
You can say what you want, but this armor set is for zerks. I can't see it making 30def viable
---
I don't know enough about PvP meta to comment anything other than "I think it looks too strong" but it's important to keep in mind that Magic KO is stronger than other styles because when you're combo eating, Sara Brews lower your Mage level which makes it easier to get hit until you restore.
---
It's also strange from a new player's perspective
---
You've reached 30 defense! You can now use addy (dropped from most mid-level monsters, ~20k gp, modest defensive bonuses) and inquisitor (only comes from endgame group boss, &gt;100m gp, bis in most places).
---
Probably like 150k/h
---
I think some people will make them. I’m doing one right now.
---
I mean I guess you could skip to whip like a few people commented. Just seems like 10 years is a really long time to be playing without doing one of the most important quests
---
I hope Jagex bans him for exploiting bugs. Lmfao
---
Yeah because "Soft Booty" is definitely on the same level as "JEWBURNERXD"... ^/s
---
Edgy af bro
---
What career?
---
Ugh I rolled my eyes every time he talked about how he saved the runescape economy.
---
Dude’s an insecure little twat who masks his insecurity by acting like entitled and elitist.
---
Lmfao thats a fucking joke if you witness my post history I have reached out twice publicly let alone messaged almost every mod. 
---
I EVEN MADE A TWITTER ACCOUNT JUST TO SPECIFICALLY REQUEST THEIR HELP RESOLVING MY ISSUE 
---
All they do is give me the run around. This isn't fair. Multiple accounts, years of my life and time, and I can't even get a decent human response. I am so upset. I watched it happen to many others and they get it fixed because theyre famous or popular but when I get false banned twice now for NOTHING I have NEVER BOTTED and they know it and are ignoring me I used to love this game and this community has helped me through some really hard times in my life and I'm being left in the dust by the ones I thought ai cared about the most. Fuck man.
---
Thanks for atleastt the recognition I feel like I havent talked to a real person about this in week now.
---
Oh yeah, people will definitely make them, when I think is pretty cool. But I don't see it shaking up build meta much, if at all
---
I've been playing RuneScape for 36 years, and I know it's not much and nobody cares, but I've finally finished tutorial island!
---
The blowy p
---
No, not in the slightest. I’m just one of those who likes having every build possible and wasting lots of membership just for the chance of that 1 perfect scenario where it’s the best choice.
---
Gz on your new neopet
---
zerkers can use the lvl 1 def tassets that give +1str tho
---
rune def reqs 40 defence, b gloves too, a build based around the inquisitor would not use these items
---
But he did apologize in that same reddit post. I think it's a bit unfair to call him a bitch because of that.
---
He posts on here but I forgot his name.  Dude actually has shown 42 separate accounts being user controlled, all woodcutting alts in samurai gear.  Lad is mad.
---
Gz
---
not the 3td age mage hat? lol
---
I think Sween said in a reply to the original video linked thread that the Reddit censorship wasn't requested by jagex and was just the Reddit mods acting in good faith thinking they should censor it before jagex made an official statement, which imo is a fair decision.
---
I’m looking at ur stats I assumed that shit was max account only content, my stats are higher by a little was this solo?? I would want to try it
---
Fucking beggars
---
I’d do 30 clues in a row where I either had minimal wizard steps or everyone lured. But then I’d have 1 clue where the absolute biggest brainlets in the game queued up to not lure the wizards at both spots so that one clue took as long as the previous 30. Thank god for this change.
---
He not remember
---
My king. Do not be saddened, but celebrate your victory. While many other kings might deem completing this quest as just a small step, it is in fact, a very large step for you my king.
---
For my king you see, you've now opened the path to success and even more handsome experience rates than in your past – not to mention your new, truly seductive sword. –  So rejoice my king for you've progressed and showed your masculinity, only good and better things shall await you in the future.
---
Why would you risk your life like that
---
Dev mode is more powerful. You can always see the invisible imps no matter what, letting you hop every world to scout and get the jump on anyone attempting it blind.
---
&gt;Wouldnt this hurt the entire meaning of having magic magic potions in game
---
Not everyone has 99 mage dude
---
I can hear it!
---
Haha its my bandos coif
---
Raids &gt; rc
---
If they're poisoned that close to death and decide their best bet is Port Phasmatys bank they deserve it
---
Seems like the exceedingly simple solution here is to attach an attack or def level to wearing the new staff along with the magic level to force its level bracket to be something higher than it is. You could just quest lock or nerf it in PvP specifically as well. Even make the spec damage scale based on your targets combat level with a cap so that its lower in lower level PvP brackets but powerful as a spec weapon against bosses etc. There are a billion routes they could take to fix that problem if its a problem to begin with
---
Explain?
---
What a time to be alive as a 60 zerk! Dagon Hai now this - I’ve just maxed my build
---
Ty! :D
---
also did like 40 dmg before he dinged must've had more than 2def at the time
---
monkaS
---
Do these change with the new face guard?
---
Time was of the essence and it was important that jagex understand exactly what was happening. If they don't communicate, there's no real way to know if they understand the gravity of the situation. We can all agree that jagex is notoriously incompetent.
---
uh... fire strike is 13 mage...
---
Was Durial the only one who could attack others?
---
Yeah the gpu plugin changes the way the entire game feels. I wasn't sold on osrs until I turned that on.
---
It does set a precedence. It's a challenge mode. Sorry that you want to be spoon fed.
---
I use Arch Linux btw
---
Care to explain what you're talking about
---
Once you get it done you’re done with it forever! (Unless you make another account of course) but it is worth getting it done, especially if you’re dreading it the feeling is great once it’s done
---
Yeah they are. Idk if the drop rate has changed from the pre eoc version of rs to current osrs, but they’re currently a rarer drop.
---
Omg yes
---
KC is in Missouri
---
I often sort by controversial and and toxicity displayed in the downvoted comments still aren’t as bad as twitter. 
---
It could also be possible that people who are toxic refrain from commenting or comment something that isn’t as bad because of the downvote system.
---
100k xp/hr while making money is definitely not bad at all
---
Yeah, if it became a fang obviously you wouldn't be able to insure it lmfao, come on mate.
---
Do remember to stay hydrated while talking about runescape drama
---
Honestly I've hated him since his lowest Jad where he flexed how big his dick was constantly despite it not being a competition. He's always been a self absorbed cock
---
&gt;How many pkers in max actually pk with dbow
---
If spec damage is that big of a deal then why DONT they?
---
Bro u should sell these def would buy
---
Lol you are severely handicapped if you ever think Jagex was going to let you know about this.
---
HCIM and half the map is the wilderness

Rendi just posted [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e31lfq/discord_logs_more_response/) showing the full creator discord screenshots and promptly deleted it.

Congratulations, king! Although many others have hundreds of mils or even bils, it certainly doesn’t downplay the massive accomplishment that you’ve achieved today in finally breaching the coveted 1m cash stack. I, for one, praise your commitment and achievement, and am rooting you on in your quest for your first green cash stack, champion.
---
Remember all those conspiracy theories you found on late night YouTube by some church preist about all the lizardmen that run the government? This is probably for contacting your shaman guide for devling into this new Christian religion.
---
It sounds like a pvp update, which means a no vote from me.
---
Runelite brought the magic back for me with the gpu plugin and animation smoothing, not to mention ground items and some other qol shit. Sounds like you're just projecting.
---
&gt;People dodged it because they don't want to wait in line, they want to game.
---
So you admit that it is unnecessary for advancement within the game mode.
---
OK then, your arguments are all invalidated by that fact.
---
It's on controlled, so it's only 1.33x exp
---
I think most phones have an 'always on' option for mobile internet, mayby it works.

Exactly. He is a minor youtuber/streamer for fucking runescape. Acting like he is some divine god giving up his godhood to shield the entire RS community. Man, some people.

I still see 1 hp claim that as a win

Youre playing in fullscreen, lmfao

&gt;and monetized this video
---
Holy shit do people not deserve to eat.
---
Alright, never used it as a wep so wouldn't know.
---
Plus dovydas
---
So we punish magic users AND people who have 99 magic?
---
Ranging potion increases damage, str potion increases damage. Why doesnt magic potion work?
---
I can see why they made it weaker than it could have been. We would have all screamed power creep if it was BIS overall. 
---
However I totally agree with you, it's kind of dead on arrival if there arent specific circumstances where crystal armour isnt BIS for something. 
---
They should have made an elf boss with it that required crystal armour for an edge, or something like that
---
Also this recolouring shite is such a waste of dev time - sorry just throwing my opinion out there
---
Ha cute.
---
yep that's fair, considering one of the reddit mods [said on twitter](https://twitter.com/SirSuhDude/status/1200119045753688064) that they were as much in the dark as everyone else
---
What's ligma?
---
Maybe it is, maybe it isnt. It doesnt matter if u find it more fun to do it manually. What matters is people do clues 10x slower if they have to look it up, this rewards people who can be good at it and punishes players who do it braindead. As the game should be. Adhering to a sensible system.
---
Congrats for real dude! I just did MM 1 and 2 on my main, not realizing I never did mm1. It’s honestly a huge achievement for mid level accounts.
---
Not exactly viable in godwars, now is it
---
*4head*
---
QPC, hard diaries, start getting some elites like lumby/frem/varrock, rigour and raids gear/stats
---
Gonna do a task there again. I'm about 300 dry so I'm salty but this looks pretty easy to tell. Glad they did this, great QoL for color blind and unimpaired vision
---
75 unlocks all weapons, see what cmb lvl you'd have at 99 of the stats you want 99s in and see if 75 sways your lvl too much
---
Obviously the balancing of it is up for debate, I just think it’d be a small, fun side goal.
---
Hard to tell what's 3d and 2d
---
It is not nothing. It's definitely odd that it's taken you this long, but it is not nothing. Congratulations on the scimitar. Now you can curse your misclicks when you accidentally use the spec on an NPC, just like the rest of us.
---
Poggg gz!
---
Not true
---
CSGO has had me hooked for 5 years and it's a piece of shit game
---
Lol barely one max hit for a bill risk prob? Seems like pvm armor.
---
I had 63 range, ward and archer ring kindly lent to me by my friend
---
if you die below 20 wild then it drops to the ground, don't believe npc or other player matters
---
No, absolutely! Also if optional UIM... never access your bank? You get UIM points at the end.
---
Make the first time require a confirm so denoting drops doesn't fuck anyone
---
that's next level kind
---
to give back a bond that's how much today
---
like 6 mill?
---
How is this exposing anybody? It’s like me messaging someone saying God Ash was behind it and then screenshotting it saying exposed lol.
---
Not even a rendi fanboy, think his vids are over rated shite but yh unless it comes from the horses mouth or you have him admitting to it this is just he said she said.
---
6m + 580k to convert.
---
&gt;76 is an insanely high hit considering that it can be used with ancients
---
Know what else can be used with ancients? AGS
---
Same only time I don't report those is if I'm already in the banking interface, and can't bring up the report one, I just hit ignore.
---
Look at the accusations from frazer. Not the best source but he has screenies, also the accusations seem believable based off of rendi's response to the whole situation. You never look innocent deleting posts.
---
one kik rick
---
Okay not recommending it is different than it being not possible lol
---
Rainbowscape
---
&gt;Plus, all those who buy items and success devalue the achievements of legitimate players.
---
...What are bonds, Alex?
---
^((I think they're good in general but stopping gold selling sites while still selling bonds isn't really doing anything about people buying their success in the game.)^)
---
It's a Thursday at an off time of the day for most people, and the tweet is not from some super famous or popular person in the community and the exposure this tweet had before before this subreddit post was like literally 1 retweet and 2 likes. 
---
Also its Thanksgiving most people are preoccupied even if they would be normally on RS. 
---
Um ya that makes total sense why no one would?
---
Can I pay you to rename it to peepee woodwork
---
This one sparks joy
---
but then they just blame it on something else
---
theres always something they can find that you "technically" broke the rules, if they want to fire you theyre going to.
---
also it goes on a state to state basis, theres no one rule for the united states. some states you can just fire someone cuz u didnt like their work ethic.
---
I’d honestly rather just see an all UIM league that only lasts a month.
---
Even then, it gives you access to the amenities of the guild (which are more than just buying the capes). They could have made it so that the masters were relocated outside the guild instead, for example. Another example of an unwritten perk of a skillcape is access to the crafting guild's chest without the diary completed, same thing for the cooks' guild's bank.
---
Can you actually pvp effectively vs people in your bracket with those stats? Pretty sure you can get stacked out from full hp pretty often
---
They could make it dependent on slayer level instead of combat level, which still leaves the reward aspect
---
This isn't Twisted League. :D
---
Yeah, much longer most people (including myself) couldn't do
---
you dont have to disclose that you had a previous job or why you left it
---
You can cheese the last fights in mm2. You'll be fine.
---
Idk ask Joe
---
Looks like people making leather with the spell is down cause of everyone playing Twisted League. 
---
Just did the math, its like 2-2.5m profit an hour right now with Tan Leather spell if anyone wanna make profit.
---
Yes.
---
ash is one of the best payed jmods
---
Who cares?
---
Happy thanksgiving
---
pking has a very very steep learning curve, it's usually recommended to have a decent amount of money to play with before you start pvp since you'll die very often. You can also just make a second account for that, which lets you do high end pvm and also pvp stuff
---
Why can’t you redownload Authenticator and login ?
---
He said this because he was praying but it wasn’t obvious because normally people would see smite when you slap an 83. Idk how this dude got so many downvotes when hes clearly just trying to be nice and explain what he did
---
He easily has the best series name too.
---
Horrible rng?!?!?! Have you even watched Swampletics?  He's gotten so painfully lucky on literally every single drop hes ever gone for on that acc
---
What is true then
---
xTeTr
---
Good job
---
its illegal there too
---
you can still fire the guy, you just face legal repercussions later, which is nothing new for jagex
---
Why did he spam jmods to fix the issue then?
---
I mean what would the even have to do besides write in code to change the pet color, the red panda is already in the game, they don't need to model it or anything.
---
Magic has the most utility out of the other combat styles, so why should it get a spec weapon as strong as the other two styles?
---
The bug has been public knowledge for a long time, it's just not been very popular (Michael RS made a vid on it in March). The video being made by a more popular Youtuber with evidence of it in practice being used might actually pressure Jagex to upgrade their Engine's way of handing this dupe.
---
Either way, the people with the resources required to pull off this glitch were likely already researching ways to exploit the game and this information was available.
---
Most people who don't have 99 magic won't use this staff either
---
Message me your ign I should be on later might do a few raids if so wouldn’t mind having someone scale
---
Back to work you go
---
I thought it took more than 70 kills
---
Faith in giant cyclones restored

Big shark is 1/5000, big swordfish is 1/2500, big bass is 1/1000. Rates are on the wiki
---
Dont incourage him!
---
Why in the world did you bring all that healing, but now know that tank armor is way better?
---
Because he got burned for billions of gold he was hoping to have duped and sold.
---
It's not that they're paying out dividends, it's that it's almost exclusively dividends. That's why the developers are so poorly paid and a large number of quality people have left already and more follow. The pay is abysmal and whatever is left after paying out dividens goes to management which Jagex seems to have more of than any company I've ever seen. They pay the developers a pittance and the quality and issues show from it.
---
When you sell them on the GE, you're selling them to other players. The price of a bond is determined by supply and demand - more people want bonds or less people sell then the price goes up.
---
A bond is essentially a virtual membership card that people sell to other players. It doesn't automatically just give gp to people who buy bonds.
---
I did solo games till 100k off 99.
---
1875 total on mobile only. Cant relate. Over 100 days playtime. Im sure its frustrating though since RL has alot of QoL stuff.
---
Salad, entree, dessert ya heathen
---
Only for jad tho, our boy deserves to eat right
---
I don't get it
---
Red pandas aren't thought of as thieves because they are heavily sectioned into one part of the world and are endangered, whereas raccoons are plentiful in number and live in many urban areas in the world. Also, red pandas are more closely related to raccoons then other panda species and while not really being thieves they are mischievous.
---
U didn’t get what?
---
Probably people trying to replicate the dupe glitch.
---
So wholesome
---
that's very nice!
---
Take a guess
---
I fixed the issue. 
---
I waited 2 hrs so my block can unblock, and i only used safari. When I was using chorme and safari it doesn't work. 
---
I was able to take off authenticator..
---
Wanted to leave this in history for the poor chap who reads this in the future (e.x past)
---
His videos aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. So what you put hours and days into achieving something and a similar amount of time editing the video? Not everyone cares how low combat you can do something, not everyone likes his editing style (me included on that one) but I’d assume almost everyone enjoys Li’l Smokey’s edits because they incredibly well and tastefully done.
---
Blowpipe is 75 range so that's interesting
---

Pick one

---
^(Jk this is a very reasonable idea. Also congrats on 99 slayer on a zerk, that's mad impressive!)
---
As far as I know, you don't tick manipulate to cancel animations, so this would not work. It would yield the same result as simply walking away from the rock you're mining.
---
Tick manipulation works by queueing an action and then changing the type of action before completion. So for instance you queue the three tick action of mixing herb tar and a timer starts. But while the timer runs, nothing is keeping track of what action the timer relates to. So when the timer ends, it simply finishes the action you're currently executing, rather than finishing a specific action. Meaning that if you change the action you're executing while the timer runs, you change what action is completed.
---
That being said, there is no way to tick manipulate with single tick actions, as they are completed before you get a chance to change what action you're executing. Tick manipulation with herb tar doesn't work if you finish mixing the tar, so tick manipulation with karambwans would not work if you finished cooking it, which is done instantly. You'd need a two tick action you can start on one tick, then switch your action to mining in that same tick, making that the action that will be completed the next tick.
---
What do you all do for fun? Got 60-75 combat skills.
---
I mean it was illegal there too, they just still did it
---
Mad RWTer is mad
---
Yeah just emphasizing the laughability of the entire conversation surrounding this new staff by pointing out a level 60 weapon worth 20k can hit harder
---
I understand preferring runelite, I do too. The game is not unplayable without it though lol
---
Say thanks to botters...
---
There’s a federal law about talking about wages being legal. Being fired from your job is dependent on state. That’s why I said as well, they don’t need a reason and can say something else but if you can prove it was due to that you’ll win the case easily.
---
Yeah I don't think anyone believes he saved RuneScape economy lol. He was roping up a good story for views and it worked, I saw the vid on #30 trending yesterday.
---
Unless you get really lucky, no. But you’ll knock out the task pretty fast.
---
Gambling addiction, “just one more”, if-I-win-I’m-out, “bro I can pay you back with interest” gang rise up.
---
huuuuuge drama  
---
also nice /u/
---
I can't say whether or not he knew it would dupe items, but neither can it be inferred from the posted message.
---
Wait wat the heck are these
---
"I can only train/use skills when doing a clue"
---
Why didnt you continue with the chins? You could have used them later for when you go bossing, like at arma. Which you need the helmet from. Like, it's a bit slower than the black salamanders, but at least chins are useful.
---
F
---
Whether you would actually get banned is hard to predict. But it would definitely be a banable offence.
---
I could picture someone that made 2000 osrs bot accounts also making fake reddit accounts for vote manipulation. 
---
Think about how pissed you would be if your ultimate get rich quick scheme was made public. 110 billion = 50 grand USD right?
---
You really shouldn't have that level of confidence.
---
Surely you remember the rat pits exploit, right?
---
you smell like a racist lava rc'er
---
THAT WAS NEVER PROVEN IN COURT.
---
Shut up grandpa, I survived a real war
---
The main thing with that is that like the phoenix debate, that would take dev time while the red panda is already modeled in-game at the prif red chin area.
---
In case you didn't know it, Infernal cape requires a lot of skill and some time. Max cape only requires a lot of time and no skill at all.
---
Both capes are obtained in a totally different way
---
I'm not sure it's even possible but it's sorta moot.
---
3t4g is restricted by movement time, you can mine instantly but it'll still take 3 ticks for each rock.
---
you'd have to mine at a spot that doesn't have depleting ores which makes it irrvelant cause it won't be good ehp anyways.
---
Well said. His video gave good information and him attempting to get Jagex notified of what was happening was the right thing to do. End it at that. His video is dramatic and self loving because he's using it as his career to make money. He isn't a hero. He isn't a villain. He's a dude who did the right thing and then made a long dramatic video to get something for himself out of it.
---
Indeed. It's just for the novelty of having a heavy ballista at that low cmb. You can also have rune gloves. Just a novelty build.
---
Next time, please make you chat box opaque. Reddit prefers yellow text on a black background, but that is the second best option.
---
I think you’re being facetious but it’s absolutely comparable.  It’s an exchange where prices are affected by supply and demand, how in the hell is that not comparable?
---
Why not just make it an item that never needs refilling ?
---
So what do they make?
---
We arnt employees so we can discuss it!
---
I know I was just saying that’s crazy
---
ur fault
---
True, but if he has runes for fire strike he has runes for air strike

let's hope so, imagine if it wasn't an act

The most unintentional and intentional RNG ever captured on video
---
You can currently get stacked out for FAR higher than that, with current items in the game.
---
Protect from melee
---
Okay I get it now
---
Yeh I would have thought a flail would be the best option. 
---
Therefore mage = tall staff with mage hat.
---
Range = curved bow shape.
---
Melee = shield, big helmet, hanging flail weapon.
---
3 different shapes on orientation of hat and weapon
---
Who’s the slimey little communist shit twinkle toed cocksucker down here who just signed his own death warrant!?
---
Try dying to a poison tick or dart on a pvp world?
---
That's why I never make friends in Runescape. Scammers everywhere. Had one "friend" who kept begging to play on my main. Told him to fuck off.
---
Read Jagex replies
---
Mage also has trimmings on his legs, warrior has a coloured hat. I think whichever jmod did it did a really good job, though a spear might not have been the best weapon.
---
theyre a hard skip for me. i save the block slot for steel dragons since iron tend to be pretty rare from my experience
---
Underated barrage of words
---
Yeah I've done vorkath, raids, Hydra, Arma and zulrah on mobile, but let's be honest, it's not ideal lol.
---
The concept is comparable, yes. But the mentality, and simply the scale of it all, very different
---
I think that if roads were white, the speed and effects of climate change would be lessened.
---
Either I don't notice it, or I have no issue running the game at 50fps.
---
It makes me really curious to know what kind of CPU people are using that makes the game have a poor framerate.
---
What does it mean to be drinking claws? Or am I missing something? 
---
I realize they aren't scales, but what else rhymes with "laws" if not "claws"?
---
Iron and steel have the same rarity
---
We're getting very close to a moral dilema here... Can you use a robotic arm to play for you? Probably not, it's automation just like a bot... Can someone with a bionic limb use it to play the game? Makes sense I guess, but what if it's a bionic arm that runs software in it that can be used to automate certain activities? What if you have an A.I. robot, can he play runescape? The wonders of the future... This world is getting too advanced for me :/
---
&gt;he passive aggressively tried to clown kemp is suprising
---
What's this?
---
&gt; No one should be celebrated for "having the courage to not exploit a bug" - this should be standard practice. 
---
A lot of people on this planet would prioritize thousands of real dollars over a video game's economy. Doing the 'right thing' would be the exception, not the norm. It might not even be the right thing to tell Jagex depending on what else you could use that money for.
---
to get ready for inferno, you simply need to respec 700x for infinite prayer
---
Alch com
---
The guy who got ligma
---
Oh lol. Then it was 75 ranged :@. Im 78 now and did it 2 weeks ago so ah well
---
Stacked out and hits actually registering on the same tick are different. Even in ftp, you can *stack* two arrows by managing projectile and movement mechanics - the hits don’t occur on the same tick and can be eating through. Stacks that aren’t on the same tick are FAR less effective. Prime example being the dark bow, where two hits stack on consecutive ticks and can be eaten between. 
---
THAT is where this weapon becomes incredibly strong. Because you can stack an 81-41 with a 2 way switch regardless to if you have pid or not. That’s like spec’ing with an ags and then getting pid swap on your gmaul every time.
