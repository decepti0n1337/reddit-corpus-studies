&gt;Look, lomeone elses picture slopily stretched across my home screen!

-OP

---
Nice karma farming. Looks terrible all stretched out, too.
---
---
---
lmfao rank 1281 in construction... smh
---
But those are from other players who did have to pay real money.
---
Why is that the best? Optimal is in any of the corners so that you get hit by the least amount of mobs at once
---
???
---
If you set the alch value to 500k, people will just alch it and thus bring even more gold in. The GP coming in from alchables is already ridiculous.
---
Yeah but it takes so long to get that many nuggets. It wouldn't effect the price of d picks. I've only gotten 1200 nuggets from ~50-90 (plus outfit, upper lvl, coal/gem bag and bigger pouch). I guess 1500 may be a little low, but if you do like 60-99 at mlm, the nuggets gained from that getting you a d pick wouldn't really be OP
---
Check out the fishing guild. It’s near Camelot. 
---
Or, try catherbry. I probably spelled that wrong but lots of people there you can strike up a convo with. I don’t do much WC but the WC guild is actually really nice and populated. 
---
For thieving, join “thirvinghost” and hit east Ardy bank. 
---
For firemaking, WT is the best xp and on dedicated worlds, is always full. 
---
Crafting, you can make gold bracelets in edgeville, the furnace is right by the bank and decently populated. 
---
Cooking, go down to the rogues den. Bank is literally one space from the fire. Lots of company. 
---
Anyways those are all the ones I can think off the top of my head.  You can always do bank standing skills like fletching at the GE or castle wars bank. Hope that helps. All those locations have tons of players totally up to talk
---
Already know OP has a green stack of gmauls.

I’m a gym junkie, guess it was probably funnier to me than I thought it would be to others. Makes sense if you see how big of a youtuber he is, and it’s all about fitness. Video starts with a motivational intro and ends up being about osrs instead of bodybuilding
---
I wish. I got cleaned at the arena a couple days ago. Bank down to ~200m from 2b. I could still make a few hundred mil if I invested in Gmauls though.
---
JMods with class, makes the game so much more.
---
I have honestly only met 2 or 3 people who have used it to gain an advantage. It's meant for brand new players, even so it's much cheaper online then through runescape. The people who are buying gold are not doing it through jagex
---
Doesn’t matter, as long as I had fun making it :)
---
The OSRS team has done an outstanding job of bringing gold sinks into the game. The staking tax has taken out hundreds of bils, far more than an item’s price re-work would bring in. Also this post was satirical and you took it too seriously. It’s clearly a joke lol
---
You sound like the biggest pussy ever. The reason they ignored poll results is because pvmers like you kept spite voting it. It would’ve been polled in favor if not for you retard pvmers that think hopping worlds to a f2p world while doing a clue scroll is acceptable. Use your brain you dumb monkey.
---
30-40m (non iron that is)
---
I guess? Not sure why everyone took my comments so negatively. It’s fine for every generation to have different ways of enjoying games.
---
Damn that kinda sucks. Also if you make gmauls 500k alch value every fucker at gargoyles is gonna make 7m/hr or some big number like that
---
Bit mental that they’ve just thrown in the spec proposal yesterday for the sword and immediately polled it. If it was there since the blog was originally live we could have given more info to slightly change it
---
The person on top was an og osrs streamer
---
I have don't 600kc and got like the spring and the light frame b2b like wtf do you know how much shards I could get? I am so mad
---
The rings in RS3 are actually really tiny.
---
Good. The OSRS economy needs a little bit of instability. Chaos if you will. I’m a devout follower of Zamorak and when things go too peacefully or too nicely I get this itch to want to bring a little chaos to the world.
---
This is EXACTLY rs3.
---
This doesnt work for me, but i heard it depends on your model of keyboard. Tried mohog benchs for a bit but decided on teaks because i could just tape down my 1 key and just use my mouse
---
Neat.
---
most of the people working on path of exile
---
Just-a-car, if you're Mammal
---
It won’t become dead content. Please use your brain for once
---
Yes
---
I think I’d vote to yes to this. But thanks to darts, smithing would just be cooking 2.0 In terms of training it
---
Thanks!
---
If you open up the minigames tab, there is a clan chat you can join for people who need to find a partner for the quest.
---
You're actually the first one to think of this. I promise!
---
Lmao 2k total is basically nothing?  Go outside
---
I just don’t know why they wouldn’t do something like this if we are already doing it with the surp helm
---
That was probably intense and you sir must have lots of patience
---
Wow
---
Thats not really precision or skill based though and its abuse or circumventing what is supposed to happen in game
---
Would definitely not do a wildly clue in this setup lol!
---
Training your skills is always worth it. Random bonuses from diaries or whatever is just a nice bonus
---
Are you insane? This would devalue my hellcat which is top tier endgame content
---
you are so lucky,,,unlike me.. I got 20m Thieving and no pet yet.
---
Literally just keep one or ignore them lol do you really need a toggle for it
---
Real recognize real
---
Void melee is only really used at corp and tob, range at tob, 99 range and dex zulrah, chinning, very specific cox layouts. Mage is only used at tob.
---
Might as well get it if you are getting void.
---
Umm wtf using Saradominist fucking symbols on our boi Guthix's cape?
---
Lmaooo he’s a troll but one of my best OSRS friends, his pure “blazor” is a legend, first maxed pure in OSRS. And he just changed mains name to ironblazor as a joke which is 100% mobile account So u just got crashed by a guy playing on mobile lol
---
That seems pretty low for an entire week
---
Oh yeah I remember that item was as OP as a ags spec  . I liked it tho
---
&gt; 99 range and dex zulrah
---
arma is better
---
If they could, I imagine they would. That's the issue! I'm glad we're now on the same page
---
Grilled!
---
If they end up being good, having untradeable potions is the same debacle where herblore becomes a combat skill (remember extremes/overloads?)
---
I play with it this way, I find that if I’m afking it’s helpful to see if I missed something valuable.
---
Osrs soa*
---
As in Shield of Arrav.
---
Real answer? Because Runescape is magic. Think about when you teleport, you get really small right? Same logic. The ring starts out big, but when you put it on it shrinks. Logically, there's no way a bar of gold would pump out only 1 ring, so obviously we only craft big donuts rings(Adventurers in Runescape aren't exactly known for their...finesse). I mean, hell, the emerald on that thing is large enough to be its own ranged weapon.
---
6% is normal fluctuation
---
The orange mage on 62 tells you where jad spawns
---
Osrs players shit their pants lol
---
Doesnt the chatbox notifications do the same thing? Or colored item overlay?
---
You can use the middle mouse button to move the camera very quickly as well. That seems to work very nicely for most people.
---
Looks like someone's jealous
---
Ugh now I gotta figure out how to quickly record my screen on Mac
---
I most certainly was.
---
Can mobile players do this?
---
didn’t mean to hurt your little feelings, I just like to have my friends backs
---
No but they can add the Void defender again. I think that’s what it was called. It was a shield slot item that replaced any Void piece but a helm so people would wear an Arma chest with full void plus the shield thing for ranging and stuff.
---
And world
---
both look ugly beyond sin
---
This is really cool.
---
I'm mad that it took me over 10 years to learn about rimmington and unnoting bones. Always did yanille.
---
Your thumb or the hammer?
---
Good content
---
10/10
---
On the surface its a nice idea, upon further thought, I don't think it would be good, thats 3 more skillcapes in the game and we'd start to see an influx of suggestions similar to this except with different skillcapes.
---
I love this subreddit sometimes
---
RS3 does have much more specific weaknesses.  Green Dragons, for example, are weak against bolts in RS3 whereas in osrs their weakness is range and stab.
---
are you implying that he cant buy dances/emotes at the "auction house"? as far as im aware there are several treasure trail items that give you unique dances and emotes. unless they removed them? funny because i remember them being in the game back in 2007 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
if i remember correctly they added some new ones like the tankared you hold that makes you drunk. funny that
---
What does on vg mean?
---
How do people like y’all make money to do stuff like this?
---
I’m gonna have to snatch a Zezima one! These are awesome man!

game is shit idk
---
He doesn’t have bandos and 2-4 hours for +1 strength bonus is going to be by far his fastest way of getting more strength. Unless he has a large cash stack and wants to spend it on the worst upgrade possible (bandos)

Got the members stuff from Twitch Prime, planning to just no life mining while listening to podcasts and shit because that's what I loved doing when I was like 8; if I get really into it hoping I can just do bond shit to keep playing.
---
I looked up clans, mainly for just a place to chill in and break the silence, would you guys recommend 2007_Reddit, Reddit_07, or something else?
---
I did remmington back when I played 10 years ago or so, but never knew about unnoting bones lol
---
If she regretted it, then she would have acknowledged it and made a genuine apology.
---
If she has done so, then feel free to link to it. But if she has not, then you can't really raise the possibility that this is "the thing you regret doing the most in your life", if she doesn't even show remorse and just continues going as if nothing happened.
---
btw cancer is a very serious illness, and faking it is a very scummy thing to do.

how about you just drop it when you get it? hardly a big fucking inconvenice since you spend 80% of this game standing around at the bank doing nothing all day

Nope, and wildy altar is 700% the XP so thats were you go if you are ironman.

Ye voids mostly late game. Range would be decent for training depending on what you are training vs, however people usually wait till 100 combat.
---
I agree
---
Thank you! I wish I could link the GitHub repository. It's just called OldSchoolRSTips/OldSchoolRSTips (Same username and repository name).
---
Yup, that's the kind of stuff that made me confused when looking at osrs weaknesses. I was expecting a specific thing.
---
guthix

lmao no ones feelings hurt you just sound like a giant douchebag
---
If something is weak to magic all spells affect it the same, the only difference with each elemental spell is the max hit, which corresponds with the level to cast it
---
Except the genie..... Because he floats....and I need my agility xp.

Except there is as a mid tier dfs. Have you not been paying attention?

We need Tarn’s Lair dedicated worlds

Take my upvote. Its a jealous upvote, but nonetheless you can have it.
---
When I recovered my account I found that someone apparently sold it (the ingame note was someone saying this and was like "gl hope you get it back") and in april 2013 I ran into either the "hacker" or a friend/gf of the "hacker" who even provided pictures of them on my account as if my account was a trophy to be bragged about. I tried to get as much information as possible or to while trying to pretend to be calm (saved pictures/chat) without being able to get too much useful information other than proof.
---
.
---
Someone would have had to guess the recovery questions and other recovery information and it was recovered during a period where jagex support was widely known for giving up accounts too easily. At this time I was only logging on right after windows reformats (1-2 times a year) while keeping my information safe, I suppose being so inactive made jagex think their recovery request was more legit than if i was actively playing.

If we encourage abusing refunds to get free membership, they'll just eventually stop offering it if enough people do it.

Really cool series.  I woulda liked to see it with 5 new accs, but recognize the grind and time that would require.   Having a series start at mid-endgamish content doesnt leave a lot of room for the series imo, but i think you guys will make it work.  Look forward to the next video and your guys "ironman luck".
---
Exactly

I didn't upvote until I saw the lower half. Nice

You claim OG then mention funorb. Rs2 was dead by that point, sucks to suck.

“Runescape is something else.” You’re damn right it is.

Phials was added to osrs in January 2015. He wasn't always there.

Nice!

 I'm level 97 and did not know this :D
---
Creating a f2p pure to pk with but doing it on members to make the grind faster. Did i fuck myself in terms of hp levels by doing waterfall quest? If not, would it be a good idea to also cannon the range levels? Im at 30/30 atk/str aiming for 40/50 through normal combat. Aiming for 60 range as well. Whats the lowest hp i should aim to have?

I’m trying to do animal magnetism and want to go through a portal to Kharyll. The game is telling me I need to finish priests of peril to teleport there first yet I’ve already done that  quest. What am I missing? I have all of the requirements listed on the wiki
---
Good job boiz
---
So I'm going to guess by "early days" you don't mean OSRS release but rather the earlier years of RS in general so like 2004 for example.
---
\#1 thing I'd have to guess is different times. A lot of the players now are the same people who played a decade ago or more. I know I 1st played back in 2006 and was very on and off so never got too far into the game, but at that time I know for a fact things like KBD, KQ, Barrows, etc. Those would all be revolutionary in my eyes. Now, if they released a boss THAT simple I'd be disappointed. Hell, just the other day I had my 1st Kraken task and it's honestly kinda pathetic how simple it is for higher level boss content. We're at a point where new updates for either RS3 or OSRS can not be simple to be fresh.
---
\#2 would probably have to be tied in with #1 which is the players played differently. People exclusively played because it was fun and a way to spend their time after school. Again, remember that most of the people playing then are the people playing now a decade or more later. I know me a decade or more ago, I didn't care, let alone even understand efficiency. I was making my money doing I think it was novice level Pest Control and spending the points on Void Seals, XP, etc. I didn't know what void armor was or what it did. The early days were filled with people like me who could and would enjoy just about anything they could do.
---
\#3 one of the bigger reasons as well that's REALLY worth keeping in mind and again it was sort of touched on with #1 is that the early days had very little. Almost anything they added was brand new content. Now, Rune armor is whatever just the best F2P gear. VERY far back in the day, Rune armor was NEW content and BiS with the only method to obtain it being smithing. Anything that was added back then was completely original and non-redundant so they could do almost anything and it'd be new while also being extremely bare bones to begin with so they could have just about any idea and not have it overlap with existing content.
---
\#4 QoL updates are what a lot of our updates are now both RS3 and OSRS. Sure, we still regularly get new content fairly often but back in the earlier days it was never or at least rarely QoL as opposed to just new content.
---
\#5 Probably the easiest thing to look at is honestly specifically the OSRS community. While I can understand the concerns behind power creep from the community, it has a large drawback which is that not only does new content need to be largely different from old content, but it needs to have reason to do it or else you get people calling it dead content before it even releases. If it has new gear or equipment that'd just devalue CURRENT BiS gear or equipment, people say it's powercreep. Eventually the OSRS team is going to have to just force out new BiS gear for armor and weapons, but until then they are just stuck having to fill in every potential niche new content can have. For example: if they were to release a Dragon Hunter magic weapon to fill in the missing magic vs dragon spot, they have to make sure it's strong enough to have some sort of uses compared to DHL and DHCB. They can't make it too strong that it overtakes both DHL and DHCB or it's power creep and they can't make it too weak or it's dead content with no value. It'd probably end up something like being BiS for metal dragons while DHCB and DHL are good for dragons with lower defense/ranged such as chromatic dragons.
---
Just scroll up and see the other guy who disagreed with you you’re conveniently ignoring.

Good job boiz.

If I can speak on behalf of the community, no one knows what you’re talking about.

RIP. hacker got into my account while I was sleeping, deactivated my new authenticator and my bank pin. Lost 4.4b, infernal cape gone, and disabled my authenticator, and was left only with my avernic defender, fero gloves and tanzanite helm. Unlucky man
---
Just hit 85 mage on my pking pure and so far I've been pking bots. What stats should I train next? I definitely want to continue killing bots and maybe try BH. I tried it twice earlier and realized having 10 hp in a Gmail/obby maul bracket is not a good time.

Damn. What was that area, clan wars? I remember it.

I never fucked with funorbs

What would be nice is if the diary just gave a 100% success rate on the shortcut instead of unlocking it.

This is my first couple hundred. All claws were under 200kc
---
Even though the set isn't good, the top and bottom for most setups are used a lot. And even if they were to buff the full set, what what you do with it? Change it completely? or buff the already effects that it has?
---
It sounds cool on paper but no one will really use it when we have whips defenders etc. there's just so many better options then losing a shield slot (besides ahrims) But who knows.

Never heard of her before this post. What’s wrong with her?

I want to get into pking, stats are 70atk/70str/70def 75range/75magic and 75HP/70prayer. Can I even compete in that bracket with these stats if so what load out should I be using? This is my main account been mainly pvming. Got around 5m to play with

Wait how? You went to the multicombat section? Or swapped targets when they switched prayers?
---
Also im strictly 60 attack, so no arclight or dharoks.

Damnit same

Explain this

Not sure if it still breaks even but I used superheat on steel to level to 82. Bought iron, coal and nats. Then sold steel bars and broke even.

He is actually right.

Yee
---
I never understood how untradables work in the wilderness upon death. If I have like a slayer helm and stuff, what happens when I get pk'd. Need to do wilderness slayer soon and don't want to risk stuff on my ironman.
---
Another question would be what it one of the best low risk wilderness slayer gear sets for an ironman, I want to get the rune pouch sooner rather than later.

I’m excited for this series! Best of luck to the 5 boys.
---
I enjoyed the video. Group Ironmanning has alwas been a cool concept for me.
---
That being said, I was diappointed in the use of established accounts as opposed to fresh accounts. 5 billion is a lofty goal, but 5 talented players on 5 good accounts will blast through this
---
Big TL;DR
---
That fake lisp thing makes me wanna puke
---
Why won't it let me post?

I thought this was common sense...

As a 95% mobile only at work player, i feel successful if i get 100k+ xp a day. I dont think about how much money i made
---
Why the Crabs?
---
I’m up there 7 days a week. The grind is real i have a hunch that gaming and fitness go well together as hobbies.
---
Dw I banked at varrock west. Ended up switching to lumbridge and banking in lum castle after a while
---
I was a but disappointed that the series didn’t use fresh accounts. 5 billion is a lofty goal, but it doesn’t seem like it’s going to be too rough with 5 established accounts.
---
Still enjoyed it though
---
Ahhhhhh shit man I got my mom to buy me mem  ONE time it was the best month of my life
---
For the sake of your sanity just spend 11$ on membership if you enjoy the game
---
why did you post 3 times?
---
interesting concept I like it subbed
---
So are you though
---
Cool idea but unnecessary. Adding a bunch of random stuff like this will just make the game cluttered and waste dev time
---
Seems pretty impractical. The memory dedicated to storage is static so regardless of whether or not players are storing items the memory is used, so you might as well make it available.
---
Yeah that's why we implemented the whole GP based restriction system to make it more interesting :) Glad you enjoyed it!
---
Thank you very much!

It's allowed in dmm too lol, Torvesta got banned for standing in the safezone all day (however, if you fill your 6 alt's deposit boxes and afk in the middle of nowhere on the alts like Mika it's not muling)

Ya Unidentifyd is a real looker to be quite honest. had a good couple of wanks to some of their nudes. the wife got pretty pissed when she caught me though.

you don't have full bronze (g)? what the fuck are you doing Slayer in?

I didnt think it was as bad as everyone says. Probably disliked graveyard or alchemy the most. Bots were an issue for the enchanting room which has been fixed to an extent, however if you have access to total level worlds you can probably do the dragonstone method anyway. Chuck on some netflix and breeze through it
---
You can kill Hill Giants for Long and Curved Bones, you need about 3k of those, which translates to around 3 mil Hill Giants. Construction is one of the most combat based skills.

Nice work mate. What rendering software did you use?
---
i usually see people call it bpipe
---
ALK ans SIM
---
1 extra click every single inventory you do. Cooking/fletching have it, so why not smithing? Not too big of an ezscape change
---
Interesting. What is appealing about doing brimhaven under 20 agil?
---
I usually just spec once per kill with the bgs when using the lance since I'm there for like 4-6kills so repooling takes more time than how much a bad spec slows you down.

Yeah because they’re definitely all the same accounts.

I never PKd so I'm probably wrong, but it's probably because you don't have to move your mouse as much
---
Sir, this is an Arby's.
---
Double click seeds and empty plant pots then humidify.
---
Probably get your range to 75 for blow pipe and just train your melee stats through slayer which will open up a lot of monsters you can kill for profit.  
---
Since you are fairly low level, I'd say just start grinding out slayer and focus on getting 70s for all 3 then work on strength.  Also, invest in 43 prayer if you dont already have it.
---
Thank you accepted.
---
So you can pick it up!
---
Smaller gaps between switches which means you can switch faster

Halp. I don’t understand but I want to

yup lol

Should make it count as a bandos item in gwd.

I assume you mean killing mobs and bosses not PvP. If so, ranged is probably the best combat skill for PvM (player Vs monster).
---
I calculated the odds, it's 22201/2847656250000 or roughly 1 in 130k. So there's probably like 20-30 people with 4
---
Needs to have a bit less swearing for no reason for that wholesome Settled like appeal ha
---
I can understand defence, but how do you not have attack and ranged at 99? What do you do to fund buyables if not through combat?
---
I calculated the odds, assuming 2 rolls per crate it's 22201/2847656250000 or roughly 1 in 130k. So there's probably like 20-30 people with 4. Once people start getting more rolls maybe it goes up to around 100 total but that's just a guess
---
Yes pls

Ideal setup for mediums. On lunars, rune pouch is law/cosmic/astral.
---
Food likely isn’t needed unless you have low stats, all of the medium clue combat is pretty easy. And for any teleports in the picture you don’t have access to, just don’t worry about them at first. Then, when you get a clue that you don’t already have a good teleport for in your inventory, start carrying around whatever your best available teleport is for that clue.

Pray flick Dh, guthan, karil, ahrim. FACE TANK torag and verac. did this running around in full obsidian using iban blast for 50+ chest using 1-2 ppot doses a trip. You'll need sharks/monkfish but thats alot cheaper than ppots. GLHF.

Yeah I can. If you mostly stick to the methods and activities seen in 2007, it'll feel precisely like the old game. Minus some of the QoL changes

Have hellhounds on block list for a long time.  I honestly don't think I will ever block gargoyles, they are my best task by far.  Have had 3 and they were all over a million coin profit.  I finally got 94 magic for barrageing but don't see how it is sustainable did a dust devil task and went through 2k death runes.  I'm actually trying to unlock abbysal demons for the whip drops so I can make some coin.  Hear slayer is one of the best skills to make money off of if you can't high level boss or raid so trying to make gp off of my slayer tasks.

He's probably expecting lewd remarks in return. It's not about "confessing" love, but rather to discuss the woman with other people who may be interested...

That's exactly what we thought as well, starting brand spanking new accounts would drag it out unnecessarily.
---
I want group ironman badly. I hope this becomes popular enough to inspire jagex to finally make such a mode.
---
haha hilarious, you got him so hard!!!!
---
Gj on confessing that you're a bandwagoner
---
Probably best advice so far.  I know at times Konar might not be the best but it is hard to turn down those key drops, I make a million off of about every 10 keys I get and that buys cannon balls and sharks for tasks.  Plus I don't like suqua and elf tasks and Konar doesn't assign those two.  Elfs are terribly slow having to use prayer and run upstairs to recharge it every few kills.  It is hard to make gp in game cause the skiller methods I relied on in RS2 like fishing don't make much money anymore and if you can't do high level bossing like vorkah or raids there isn't much of a way to make a lot of money in a short amount of time other than buying bonds and were not all independently wealthy to do that.

Seems like a pk clan didn't like it exposing shit so they took it down via a copyright strike.
---
It’s (1/512)(1/512)= 0.000038 or so
---
Although this way is fun, I really enjoy watching early game progression. It’s like the build up before the climax of a good book.
---
Why would they go to grotesque guardians? They don't need guardian boots they need bandos boots so both would have to go to bandos for worthwhile trips
---
That's actually not a rule you can follow for a lot of instanced fights. Some instances force you to lose all items. Generally those have a collection mechanic like zulrah, but it's probably safe to not risk it.
---
  
---
That being said, if you're bringing 4 other items that are more expensive than a suffering (with protect item) I really really really doubt you'll have an issue with any quest boss.
---
It depends on your goals, you have the freedom to do what you like. Quests are always good for improving your account. Barrows gloves is a nice mid-level goal.
---
Nobody cares

But that changes the HUD and chat to make it smaller

I think you'll find that once you get used to boss mechanics like with galvek (dodging attacks and staying mobile), you'll be much more prepared for other bosses later on. That's been my experience, so don't give up!

and so another successful series was born

Why do you feel the need to put me down?
---
Oh interesting, of course it would. Though I get the feeling that it would be a small enough effect that you'd be able to set it up to work for a short enough time to flex on someone's stream. But this is completely conjecture, I might be completely wrong.
---
It will rise again, just hold it for now.
---
Well it depends, considering the 0xp gained during the grind. That time is enough to farm gp efficiently by doing farming, active merching and some other high-efficiency money maker. Let's just assume above method yields 4m gp/h. Bcp is around 18m.
---
Depending on his play style going for bcp might more sustainable solution, since it is much more useful when bossing for example. Also that money can be invested elsewhere later, not to mention money making usually gives xp.
---
 If he plans on doing pk, a torso might be better, but going for it means that he's losing and gp. Ofc ppl play differently and he might enjoy the ba grind.
---
Going for bcp or torso is highly dependant on play style, so it is very hard to make these decisions for other players'.
---
Agility and runecrafting. They’re currently polling a brand new agility course locked behind high requirements, and it peaks at at 65k xp an hour. Why is everyone so unwilling to have better experience rates at higher levels? Who the fuck is enjoying it, who’s it for?
---
I don’t get it, never will, it’s a damn shame but that’s just me.
---
Alch for profir while questing
---
Next update plz jagex

Nice job!

Its only 4: Xerics (dont wanna die with it and farm a new one) claws (protects over assembler) Quest cape( ill just lose 99k) Scroll book( got like 3m in teles in it)

Ive got a bank tab setup so its done within 10 seconds.

i do, and that's what counts

Assembler, Gaurdian boots, Eternal Boots, and especially Barrows gloves are a big one

My post history is a work of art
---
When I was 13 I kept making new accounts because I didn't like the name and you couldn't change it
---
I always laugh so hard at the people that say they're struggling with jad yetthey swear it's not because they're getting nervous.
---
You literally get over a second to react. They might as well be calling themselves EXTREMELY mentally slow if that was the case lol. Jad is 100% all nerves. 2 hours of anticipation is an insane amount for a few minutes fight.
---
But i would need to pay attention to 
---
* where to click to go
---
* if jad is sending any ranged/magic attacks
---
This is where panic settles in.
---
This benefits pures so I'm voting no &gt;:(
---
Memes aside, I don't see why not.  I always thought masters should have been based on Slayer level, anyway.  Seems wack that a maxed pure might not even be able to use Nieve or Duradel.
---
It's surprising something along these lines wasn't added in as a hidden perk to begin with. While the primary perk is useful, it does seem (just like the suggestion in the OP) to be as situational, due to already having 99 in a relatively slow skill. Support
---
OP literally made an alt to give himself praise, nice

I think it's harder for younger people to get into osrs. It doesn't have the instant gratification a lot of games provide these days. Most would instantly get turned away by the graphics of it. It's awesome that you started at such a young age and actually progressed as far as you have. Back when all of us were your age we were inefficient players probably just having fun at Castle wars lol.
---
How did I know you were American.. 😂 I'm a gay men and it doesnt make you special go to work pay your taxes. Why do you feel the need to bring your sexuality into everything true equality is just being apart of society not being like look at me.
---
Why is there no chance he does this? You can still grind this game and have your shit together. It’s called priorities.
---
imagine the gravel on their feet that isn't worth no boots
---
What? You pray against an attack, then click behind Jad and switch to pray melee as jad's next attack hits you. You'd never have to focus two things at a time.
---
The slayer cape's perk is insane, it's a large boost to the xp/h or gp/h depending on your goal post-99
---
Do some quest. Kill some cows you're on your own after that 😆
---
1. Convenient is subjective. I personally find wildy to be just as convenient as POH, and seeing pkers adds some excitement to the grind
---
2. Better xp is true. Dbones is 650k xp/hr at POH and 550k xp/hr at wildy altar. However POH is twice the price for 100k xp more per hour. If getting that extra xp is that concerning, it’s better to just use a better bone like hydra or dagannoths on the wildy altar
---
Just use common sense. If you do anything beyond what would be capable with mousekeys, you're risking a ban. Not that hard to figure out

I like the alternate slayer requirement idea too!, though i feel 85/80 slayer and 100 combat/90 would be abit more balanced. But either way something to make either the later slayer masters accessible with either high slayer requirements or slayer cape requirement makes alot of sense.
---
Whos jacky
---
I have been waiting to do barrows till I have higher combat stats, but I did a couple runs with slayer dart. It seemed like I was splashing an awful lot wearing my melee gear. Is Iban blast better?

🦀 REDDIT IS POWERLESS AGAINST ALT ACCOUNTS 🦀
---
The fun with watching group ironman would be that every account would have to be built striving for different goals that all complement each other. You'd have a fisher/cook for food, The thief for gp, 1-2 pvmers for drops and someone else doing something else, it's this synergy that makes group ironman a fun concept. That doesn't exist here and you may as well all just be seperate accounts because the accounts are high enough levelled that anyone can do anything at any time. Makes it not fun to watch and way too easy to accomplish.

Jad phase only

Because it was just lowly grass before the farming update and jamflex didn’t think to upgrade its status
---
Fuck that, i don't want to go to chaeldar/konar for 20 levels. This only makes sense if you only train combat through Slayer.
---
f2p doesn’t need to be updated so regularly
---
This looks better idk why
---
Pretty sure a good rework is coming
---
Why doesn't the iron man just hop?
---
Incase you haven played yet, buy this game. Cheap, fucking awesome small dev team, 99% polished, fluid, wonderfully skillful game. I sunk 60 hours into week one lol.
---
It'd be good because it'd really fuck up the botters
---
Yeah these where my thoughts, I think just having the ability to use any slayer master with the slayer cape equipped is more then enough.
---
It will stop beginners from being in them, which is all OP cares about. Not the actual nest/bottle lol
---
Whatever you say, do u think that your trolling is making me sad or smth?
---
Ehh... It'd be possible, but you'd almost definitely be looking at 1 kill trips...
---
You'd probably be much better off doing Zulrah.
---
You look at the picture? Don't think he is hurting for xp
---
Where is this?
---
?? You wouldn't be forced to do anything, it's an alternative requirement.  So if you had either 85 combat OR 80 Slayer you could use Nieve.
---
I'd also like if Ignisia at wintertodt sold the firemaking cspe instead of some random guy near seers village.
---
what is the osrs team about introducing HD graphics?
---
i dont expect it to be a 100% no because new content textures look way more HD than osrs imo  (most zeah buildings and areas, the new troll cities npc's, etc)
---
recently last Q/A you wanted a way to keep new players and all my friends that tried the game and quitted very early did so because of the graphics. most of them legit said to me that they "like the game but the graphics are a huge turn off" and some are willing to give another try if they get better.
---
i personally also want better graphics but i dont want them to be ultra 3k realistic 4d graphics xD
---
A total of 69696969 exp? 
---
Nice.
---
I was assuming it would work the same way as with Duradel now
---
Good bot
---
Downside is that it's expensive as fuck. The tiaras often go for &lt;5 gp each whereas you invest more than 100 gp/tiara.
---
Start punching cows m8
---
Agreed, but my setup is best for beginner-mediums. For hards and elites, add a blowpipe and a black dhide tops and legs. 
---
Masters and a different kettle of fish. A bit mote setup.
---
Maybe I was wrong but i assumed OP meant for grinding lower level clues rather than a setup for higher level ones? 
---
As for you issue, just run and log out if it is armadyl.
---
Or take the initiative to bring a blowpipe if you are doing an elite.

---
That's true! Thing is, is someone in that situation capable of facing the mob? It would also mean admitting they lied and if it genuinly were a disorder, then that wouldn't be an option.
---
Wait what? They’re discontinuing DMM?
---
I really think that if you work things out better (like actually receiving the most expensive item or something), include some emblems to make it worth the kill (pures/berserkers/not-smites) and sink the rest of the gear, you're almost there
---
IMO a task system could just be added in as a minigame sort of thing just like farming contracts are. If artisan was to bring in additional content for the skills it has you interact with, that content could just as easily be added into said skill. There's not really a necessity to make the vast majority of that into a skill.
---
I think the only way to really make enough content for artisan would be to have it be similar to invention. I don't think anyone really needs to guess as to why that won't pass.
---
In my opinion it has the same issues warding does. If you remove the battle wards like everyone is asking, warding just becomes a glorified crafting. There's not really a good reason to make that new content into a whole new skill without just making a new skill to have a new skill.
---
There just isn't enough natural content there. Jagex would have to pigeonhole other content (just like battle wards) to flesh out a skill and make it seem like it deserves to be another skill, not just an expansion or rework of an existing one.
---
Thank you :)

I'm not going to look through 489 comments just because you haven't been playing long enough to realize that in OSRS AFK means stuff like rooftops.

GZ on winning the lottery mate! :D 
---
please tell me you bought a lottery ticket, its a free win
---
1. Get roughly 70 Agility and unlock Graceful (Weight reducing armour, makes moving around so much easier)
---
2. Do quests in this order:  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal\_quest\_guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) 
---
3. Whilst questing do alchs for profit, I use alchmate it shows potential profits on items.
---
4. Do herb runs (Farming) whilst going through quests for extra profit.
---
5. Once you have the stats for a diary, do them :)
---
6. Once you've done a good bulk of quests (Perhaps 175QP for barrows gloves) its time for fighter torso.
---
7. Get 75 range and firecape
---
8. NMZ your combat stats to roughly 80 each to unlock ring imbues etc. and give yourself a good standing.
---
After that you should have a good idea where you want to go next, some ideas include quest cape, 83 construction for most house unlocks, slayer for money, bossing etc. If you want some more pointers or help along the way message me. Also try find a decent social/pvm clan. I have one if you want to join, but you can find others on the osrs forums.

Try leveling other skills. There might be one you really enjoy. Combat isn't working so well
---
Just a torso and work towards more zenyte and cerb boots! Nice bank tab btw.
---
Also can I piggyback this thread for a question? How do you know what to buy? I have sacrificed all my good slayer and raids gear for bis for zulrah (no arcane) because I'm farming for a mutagen. But i cant raid efficiently because I have all my gear tied in snek gear. But I get 25 kills an hour and 10 kill trips. Reeeeeeee
---
Judaism and all it's forms is from the desert. Also I'm not sure if anyone ever specified USA.
---
You’re not even at drop rate, not surprising. Don’t solo for drops. Solo for xp
---
Did you ever play it? The servers are still pretty active and it's a lot of fun if you don't want to buy Mordhau
---
No GE so nope. Fuck standing around for hours spamming shit just to buy some food or a weapon
---
Maybe for a bit. Or off and on for a change-up, but probably not exclusively. The osrs we have today is definitely the better, more complete game
---
I'm not sure how you're not getting this.
---
Next you're going to tell me that crafting Blood Runes isn't AFK.

You forgot to censor compass direction. Thanks for the account.

I did like how they game seemed to remember how much you'd lost. Back then I would regularly lose 500k at a time multi-pking as one of my clan's few magers, but still made profit when I went back to Edgeville. I used to rake in the statuettes.
---
wtf are you talking about lol, "you generally dont get a 99 during the fight. yes you do, the odds of you getting it when you kill it is small. smh
---
There's too many skills where gp doesn't play a part
---
You could have won a decent powerball lottery but instead you got two shitty drops on runescape lol gz
---
Nice profit! 👌🏼😂
---
Not in the cage but by the well? Have you entered Morytania through the bridge first?
---
Double whoopzie. Oh well, the point stands that it wouldn't overpower dds/maul.
---
Not these days with every piece of info being widely available. 
---
Really skilled and dedicated people used to be maxed at the age of 13 back in 2010/2011. That was impressive.
---
Are you going to be building an API for this as well? I’d be interested in including your tips on a part of my OSRS project I am working on at the moment. Would be nice to be able to pull down all the tips as JSON like this or even better yet give them an ID, text, and category. That way you can filter your tips even further to make it more specific for what the user is looking for or provide more specific tips for the devs using your API
---
Set short term goals so you don’t get burnt out. Get the requirements to get in the warriors guild then go for a dragon defender. Maybe do some pest control in between each defender so you break up that grind. Then go for torso
---
Keep the 1hr/day blast furnace so you can maintain a bond.
---
Thanks
---
There’s always the one loser who has to insist someone who’s famous for playing video games, “isn’t that good”. I really wish they knew how pathetic it comes off.
---
Its obviously a joke. It's a pretty common joke when you've been lucky at a game or something meaningless to say you should have bought a lottery ticket. Much like when someone complains about rng being "wasted" on a shitty rare drop

Not reaching for karma just thought it’s be fun.

I suppose you would be correct. Lol I wasn’t thinking about the fact I share it on the OSRS reddit.
---
Imagine thinking your so much smarter than everyone because you know java script, while at the same time being too stupid to understand why someone would read your drivel and downvote it.
---
I have a tip btw: Sticky keys, which are built into the operating systems already, can be used to shift-drop items, without having to hold shift all the time.
---
Same. I played the game for at least 5 years on my old main as a kid and early teenager, and that account was nowhere close to my current account, which I've been playing off and on for the last couple years.
---
Though, I don't think we had the wealth of information back then like we have now. People have min-maxed this game down to a science in an effort to be as efficient as possible, and it's extremely easy for the average player to find that information and implement in their own game play. 
---
Not to mention, the Grand Exchange... Pre-GE, I know I spent hours upon hours bank standing trying to merch my shit. Now that we have the GE, you can just dump your stuff into the exchange and peace out to keep farming resources, do quests, slayer, etc. 
---
There's a lot less standing around in this game compared to when we were kids.
---
If MLGudi wants it, sure
---
Doesn't take long to make a baby pure if you are planning on just pking with normals.
---
How old is he now? Maybe he just wants to retire and streaming certainly isn’t anywhere near a real job.
---
mediums getting rangers on rate is like 2-4m an hour. profit per hour  depends a lot on how fast you are at doing clues as well as obviously if you are on rate for rangers.

What? how does this have anything to with the post

99 Fm from Winterdot, then 99 thieving blackjacking into 99 fishing 3ticking should get you well started.

So this tells me to add a flair but then it tells me I don’t have the permission to add post flair on this subreddit. Why even message me in the first place telling me to add a flair then, Subreddit Moderator? You add it if you’re so worried about it or give me permission to add it or just quit bitching.
---
I would if there was GWD and the GE
---
Because if I'm e.g. woodcutting and a nest falls I have to pick it up to see what kind of clue it is in the first place. If I'm playing on mobile then it's even more annoying. I used to anticipate doing any clue from a nest or bottle but now the majority of the time it's just a beginner clue.
---
I never said it was a big fucking inconvenience, and if I bank stand all day then why would I have thought of this suggestion in the first place? I'm sure this would be an incredibly easy thing for devs to implement.
---
2150+ total puts you in the top 20k accounts in the world as of the time I post this. Even without the hard stats, I am next to certain the average age of these account owners is nowhere near 13 years old. If you don’t think it’s impressive, then that’s your call, but personally, I’m impressed.
---
This community really likes to hypersexualize any girl they see. Just ask /u/Zuhaar.

Please don’t do it. I’d kill for an almost maxed 13 prayer pure. You should just create a new baby pure to do NHing if you want.

---
projection
---
Oh wow i didnt realsie it was so much,  I think im doing about 15- 18 clues an hour but never really checked tbh so could be more or less.  I was really enjoying the first bunch i did so it felt like it went quick. I have most of the stashes set up and can do every step just dont always have the most efficient ways to get to the place
---
He's not wrong. The amount of people who tag me in stuff is quite worrying
---
?? pepega
---
You could have made one post instead for the full image...
---
Well, people usually go for DeviantArt for these kind of things.
---
I really don't see what other uses the weapon has than making it easier for clans to fuck up a person in single-combat.
---
After hours of slayermusiq1’s dedication to questing*
---
No, it's meant to help decrease magic damage, not make you immune.
---
I second making a new account. I came back recently and it made my experience so much better since I hadn't played the game in ages and it helped me relearn a lot of the game.
---
You must be new here
---
That's right. Medium packs lost heavily in value because their high-value tasks are fruit trees which are only unlocked at level 85.
---
For high-tier packs, you unlocked redwoods at 90, which provides a very small increase in profit.
---
Use slayermusiqs guide and method for final boss. You should get it first try :) bring anglerfish if you’re really worried about it. Think I only ate like 4 of them though
---
What will the next quest be? Restless Ghost?
---
Gz, really big achievement!
---
Buy a bond
---
"Azuk has resubbed for 6 months!"
---
Yeah right you expect that people get 75 def before 70 prayer.
---
Is that mexico on the other side of the wall?
---
He doesn’t. Payment was Halloumi, wings, sausages and a burger. He’s a friend.
---
No luck needed when your medium clue kc is 6000+!!
---
Just so you're aware, you're a bad person.
---
Just use slayer points, it's extremely useful and saves inv space for tasks and other things
---
Same
---
Good work man. You'll get a lot better feedback in the /r/blender sub. IMO shadows need work.
---
He could just get 70m farming xp on another account, boom easy

🦀🦀🦀 THAT WALL WAS NOT POLLED 🦀🦀🦀

He should give it to me so I can fund the effort to sub to him
---
doing chest only pyramid plunder is one of the faster (if not fastest) methods to get rocky.
---
Its mostly basic pvm/ slayer gear so
---
Using occams razors we can deduct that the one on the front seems to be changed physically while the one inside is mechanical
---
What other hints give this away?
---
While the front one is technically "slow" if the front one was correct we would have to assume it would be further along then the physically set clock or that the one inside is no longer in function. 
---
It's quite elementary my dear scalpers.
---
Will do thanks for the advice bro
---
Ever since Mod Mat K left things have gotten chaotic in Gielinor.
---
And the one before that
---
What’s the reason to vote no to this specific change? I don’t even play LMS so idc really but I’m genuinely curious what the downsides are, if there are negative effects.
---
Same thing with black mask. Slayer helm is mostly cosmetic
---
Oh shit, didn’t even notice that.  OP come do some clues for me.. damn.. the slider puzzles are so time consuming and make clue life suck; the rest of the experience I enjoy
---
No way dude is this real??? What hotel is this
---
When minigames are way more active on private servers (and they are), you know the game direction has a problem.

Epic GAY-mers.

Hey, I've updated those, thanks.

Mo money; mo problems

I see you're akin to the voters of Hillary Clinton
---
What does the CP in your name stand for?
---
Bought one 2 week ago on my ironman. It was the last thing I had to buy I never canceled a task felt weird paying that much at first but it's done. On to the next one. Already forgot about it
---
Lmao no it's made to decrease accuracy not damage,that's what mage pray is for.
---
I see the logic behind the voters of Hillary Clinton
---
I'd add that wines are pretty much the best food to eat at wintertodt. Worth 1-2 gp each and heal 11 HP. Works best when you're low HP but still works at 99 HP.
---
Chief your account is 7 hours old
---
ok
---
Well, they are men, and they do live in a cave...
---
&gt;I don't recommend it tho. The controls are wonky as fuck and it get boring pretty quickly. It depends on your type of games but I didn't really enjoy it.
---
Yeah runescape isn't really for everyone.
---
TIL the bedroom clocks tell the minute of the hour within five minute increments
---
Half past rune, twenty to rune, quarter past rune, rune o'clock, etc
---
OP is enjoying his Saturday with u/Nikozxz and /TheHuttis elsewhere. I asked if they want to prove :). I’m at home with the white cat from my u/telloleyell profile picture.
---
Your friend is completely right I think.
---
There are 2 reasons that the price of high-value gear goes up.
---
1. Inflation
---
2. Lots of new players acquire a reasonable amount of wealth.
---
ACP actually exemplifies this better.
---
Both of these combined is what caused a long sustained increase in the price of armadyl: It wasn't that sought after at first because people were buying max melee, zenyte jewelry, and SGS first. That meant that fewer people were in the market for Arma, and the price reflected it.
---
From May 2015 to May 2018, the price steadily rose from 13-44m for ACP, as more and more people finished earning cash for their max melee, and moved onto the next thing to purchase.
---
Now most everyone who doesn't chuck their bank at the sand casino and has played for at least 3 years should have a net worth of at least a few hundred mill. Everyone has an ACP now, and they never leave the world.
---
Lololololol shilling on your own post to try and make it popular. That’s about as low as you can go on the Internet. Go outside you need fresh air.
---
that meme is so shit can you not please.
---
Likewise, if you attack with Ranged while wearing black d'hide negative melee bonuses literally won't affect you.
---
It wasn't always there BTW
---
70 defense for black dhide would make karils useless. Imagine being able to afford nearly 300 sets of black dhide for the same price as a karils top, with the same requirements.
---
Nice!! I’ll be there
---
OP meant the pronunciation of the words
---
Yup. 90 minute buildup for such a quick fight. I stopped on 61 to take a couple deep breaths. Grab some water and go to the bathroom. Remained calm the whole fight and didn't end up tanking any jad hits. It was great.
---
He’s outside currently with u/Nikozxz and /TheHuttis. This is his gf responding all the time on her account. Not our fault you felt like he used alts :D
---
He's not saying it can't be a good new wep
---
He's saying that a good new single handed melee weapon is already so filled up with niche choices that we should be getting something else good
---
Jesus god
---
50/50 it either happens or it doesn't.
---
Buddy has his gf commenting on his posts? Can this get any worse?
---
Day 1 korasi pking was some of the most fun I've ever had in the wild
---
They are going to nerf the melee DEFENSIVE bonuses, and possibly the mage defensive bonuses too. Of course it would affect you since many monsters do attack with melee and even if you safespot them then you have the pkers.
---
Also don't forget a lot of pvmers are going to be playing the guantlet on release.
---
Which if you grind that out a bit you'll have a stock pile to go before you even start using them
---
LMFAOO, you’re reaching. You’re being ridiculous nothing else, I don’t know what’s reason you’re being that way. We liked his content so of course we suggested him to post on Reddit and cheer him on. Is that wrong?
---
please .
---
Thank you!
---
That's a shitty comparison and you know it
---
Rapier is new on handed bis melee wep, already replacing it for a better option is some crazy powercreep.
---
Osrs has been pretty good about powercreep compared to other iterations of the game.
---
Buy rope and chair
---
Make it clear Phials is an npc
---
Progression is not power creep. Are you also gonna ask to remove all non-bis melee 1h weapons now?
---
Np
---
And welcome to the grind
---
around half the xph of alt luring, he was most likely doing this while looking for a free world
---
That's why i said "Most people", and not "Everyone". A negative side effect of the Pride events is that they also provoke protest from certain extremist homophobic groups. The ironic thing is that those homophobic people are the ones who are not accepted by the majority of society. 
---
My point is that we don't need this event within OSRS. There is plenty of room outside of the game for this event to take place, and imo Jagex should stay away from introducing politics inside the game. Because like you mention with the Pride events in the southern USA, an event like it would for sure provoke trolls and homophobics to spread negativity. Jagex can express their political interests anywhere else, like social media, by physically attending Pride events or whatever. Just keep it outside the game.
---
Is this a Copypasta or something?
---
Ammonite crabs are better
---
That's what he gets for being a city fan you fucking plastic cunt aahahahahahahah
---
Holy shit this is sad. Go back to /r/SuicideWatch
---
Oh mb, I thought you were talking about OP's proposed nerf
---
DELETE THIS
---
You are hereby banned from the internet.
---
I think it would be fun because odds are they all wouldn’t be pulling the same profit or drops.
---
Watching them slightly bicker because one guy is just killing guards and running clues for 0 profit would be fucking hilarious. 
---
At this point it’s just kinda like watching my CC owner. Losing it all at the sand casino and rebuilding.

Mmk leaving not even polled, he still leaves.

Wtf jamflex.

your gear and your stats -- high xp is only possible with very high str and hp levels while wearing dharok's. And it's not afk at all btw, since you have to click at least once every minute to keep your hp at 1.

Can I interest you in double your money? Accept my teamview intivite.

Thank you for this! I’ve been looking for more series to binge.
---
Trust me. Not mad, just decided to go through the comments to see a fucking trainwreck caused by OP and his supposed suicidal wife/gf/alt. Yall are just dumb. It's funny to make fun of you, I'm not mad at all lmfao.
---
well he did say in order, but i guess off the top off our heads most of us dont know what order quests were released in
---
The crystal needs a better buff it is currently a joke now and after proposed buffs
---
&gt; jagex will do nothing about this
---
And they fucking shouldn't. It's multicombat and you're playing an MMO.
---
Go in reverse of what seems natural
---
I forgot about axes breaking! I remember being pissed when my iron pickaxe head went fucking flying when I was mining outside varrock as a f2p kid
---
The game seemed so vast and incomprehensible then
---
Just an a tip there are like 30 of these types of posts on this subreddit daily
---
It's cause ash isn't real, he's an AI simulation of a perfect human.
---
Just stop.
---
I felt like such a boomer realizing I was already older than you when I first started playing Runescape 15 years ago.
---
(the guy who shit himself)
---
The crystal bow is basically a joke and will still be after the polled buffs
---
&gt;Why should they do anything about it?
---
Because it can make players to quit game. 
---
&gt; Crashing and negative experiences are things that happen in MMOs.
---
Bugs are also part of any game but developers try to get rid of them.
---
Uhh you're a brand new account and your only posts are on this thread lmao you can't blame people for thinking you're an alt, and even if you're not it's weird to create an account just to leave a comment on your friend's thread. Idk mate you do you, deuces
---
How's the spec requirements?
---
i cant fix the title but i did fix it in the post thanks :)
---
Yes they do. AdAway
---
Around 90+ hp and str full dh becomes better than full obby. I’d also put ur rumble on hard mode. It’ll increase their hp which means more xp
---
Great, now everyone is gonna start doing this.
---
imo this is hardcore done right, not going for completionist for thousands of hours and always playing it safe only to lose it in some stupid way regardless.
---
The man, the myth, the legend
---
classic enlightened centrist rushing to the defense of racists, nice
---
🤣
---
What are those 3 white dots
---
&gt;And they fucking shouldn't. It's multicombat and you're playing an MMO.
---
is this also argument against having private instances for bosses?
---
How sad that this is what people do with their game time 😂
---
No you moron.  In your case people are crashing you because they want the limited resources you're currently occupying (the nechs).  They're not specifically targeting you as an individual, where as with streamers they often are.  Frankly you're asking for it if you're a basic bitch with iron or fe in his name or whatever.
---
This did not age well lol
---
True but that's still downloads that are lost out for the official one (for people who are yet to download mobile at all) and they don't want to do that I guess
---
How are you going to watch one of the best movies of all time online recorded off a video camera. Theres no good quality copies of endgame until it gets released on cd. The time it takes for you to find a copy of endgame and ask reddit, you couldve worked your lazy ass and watched it in the theatre

I always assumed all mosnter drops are from players they've killed

Born too late to explore the earth. Born too early to explore space. Born just in time to explore the destructive consequences of memes.

I think it's quite fitting that he was number 2

not really when you can easily do it every single time without fail. Thats like saying someone eating a shark and not dying is insane lol
---
I'd sell any new content items
---
Yeah, I didn't know how powerful it was, though it was just a shit quest weapon, but when someone switch to that weapon and you try to pray melee and BAM magic
---
Like a few months ago people were using a fan to click left click, and jagex made it bannable because it was impossible to tell the difference between an autoclicker.
---
PC games in general have the most toxic chats, thanks keyboards.

i created this today. I have another account which is u/telloleyell. I never blamed anyone, just had plenty of conversations with different mindsets. This is my boyfriend’s post, I saw him crafting and masking this video last night and in the morning he sent it to us on Discord. We thought shit was funny and original? Suggested him to post on here. Never did he once asked us to comment on here, it’s sad that you’re assuming him since I was the only one alting here and giving him the attention that he probably wouldn’t need because as you can see plenty of people seemed to enjoy it. We’re always the first ones to comment on his posts :D. We too, enjoy his posts. Idk why that feels out of place for you guys
---
At that point it's griefing
---
Like it's one thing to crash for the world but it's another to crash just to be toxic
---
Shut up robot you havent even enslaved mankind yet
---
clue kill count
---
can’t deny that :D
---
And now you've gone and told everybody with a post near the top of the subreddit and this being the top post.
---
I’ve learned to live with it
---
Would be way more fun to have your account ruined and see your reaction to it. You seem to think its okay to ruin someones hard work as long as its not you it happens to.
---
This is how it is:
---
If i work 3k hours on an account its value is 3k hours time for me (it can be converted to show how much cash its worth by taking hourly salary multiplied with the amount of hours its been worked on) (not to be mistaken with market value, thats what other people are willing to pay for it)
---
If a girl works on her job for 1k hours and she decides to put 100% of her salary on a car, then the cars value for her is 1k hours. (it can be converted to show how much cash its worth by taking hourly salary multiplied with the amount of hours she worked for the cash for it) (not to be mistaken with market value, thats what other people are willing to pay for it)
---
If she now decides to ruin my account somehow, killing it if its a hcim or getting it banned somehow, then she ruined something worth 3k hours me.
---
If i then takes revenge on her and burns her car, i will have ruined something worth 1k hours for her.
---
This means she is still worse, i lost more, she only need to work 1k hours to get back what she lost.
---
I must work on a new account for 3k hours to get back what i lost.
---
If you still disagree with me after reading this crystal clear explanation then im out of this argument/discussion with you. If this didnt take then nothing i say can nor will get you to understand this.
---
Well they’re not there to fuck spiders
---
Ok? RuneScape has always had bots
---
Alch yourself
---
What is this twitch primeloot ?
---
Or mobile or take a break
---
The dude was well over an hour ahead of rank 3 and could have taken 45 mins to shit and still held the 2nd place record
---
There was no reason for him to shit his pants, if he even did. This is all based off a single in game screenshot where the dude basically says "I shit myself". It could easily have been a joke and has since gained him the infamous title of "ehp rank 2 pants shitter"
---
Why nh with 50 atk 52 pray? Just go 60 atk 45 pray. Gmaul pking is braindead already
---
I like this but instead of reward chance what if it was tokens and instead of a raid it was a skill where you explore dungeons and at the end of each lvl you have to fight a boss to exit.
---
I'd kill for the Zaros version. Purple is life.
---
No...
---
Oslo should be banned, but not for this.
---
tell your clanmates to not pause their trackers while hopping then - the time wasted hopping and the amount of half xp kills you get makes it terrible compared to having an alt keep full stack infront of you the whole task

If it weren’t for the kind people of OSRS, I would still to this day bury bones at GE :’)

At least keep your story straight if you're going to try to bullshit us, OP

Any idea on his elite clue farming method?

Nah, his volume was high and he added more stuff onto it

Reminds me of when I was ~12 y/o in 2006 and faked that I was sick to stay home and play runescape. I was about to sell my black gold set for 350k a guy traded me I accepted it got canceled and I accepted again I didn't even bother double checking on the second screen I checked my inventory and I only had 35k I remember crying for like an hour straight lol, I met a guy that was selling a ton of rune items i told him the story and he probably felt bad for me since he gave me a rune scim for free he could prob tell that i was young. Anyway even though i lost a lot of gp that guy made my day a little bit better. I will never forget you kind human being.

I don’t believe for a second you have a gay friend, let alone multiple lmfao

You're wasting so much time going to people's houses, not to mention maining on the laggiest world when you can unlock prayer restore and a good chunk of the teleports at 50 con which costs ~1m

When I think racist I think of someone who is truly evil filled with hatred for people different than them that they don't even know, apparently when you think racist you think of 13 year olds using the N word to piss off others in an online game.
---
Reminds me of when I was ~12 y/o in 2006 and faked being sick to stay home and play runescape. I was about to sell my black gold set for 350k a guy traded me I accepted it got canceled and I accepted again I didn't even bother double checking on the second screen. I checked my inventory and I only had 35k I remember crying for like an hour straight lol
---
I mean you're still not even 2/3 of the drop rate so it is nothing
---
Yet they ban people for "ragging" because of a couple of pvp obsessed mods don't like that, even though ragging is not mentioned anywhere in the rules.
---
Issa joke, he's saying the people he's crashing are his alts
---
You can bury them? Wtf why is that even an option
---
no
---
well you guessed wrong kiddo, been there since the beginning, but ps3s didn't come with mics, so never really had to deal with that nonsense.
---
That takes way longer. Rl shows u how to do it in the least amount of clicks. It’s very easy lmao
---
Alright so assuming that you aren't the same person as OP. You would have no reason to make a new account (several apparently but I haven't looked at the others) just to comment praise on the post, when you already have an account.
---
Fuck it. I’ll be first. 50/50.
---
Getting crashed: What are you doing? 
---
Crasher: Training slayer
---
Lmao that had my dying. 
---
Dick move though.
---
Lower the detail, make it 2D. Then we can talk.
---
Looks great! Keep it up homeboy
---
&gt;nobody's gonna read this part but I like dick in my ass....
---
Do u have an ironman
---
Ahh sheep herder 2. The lambening.
---
It hurts me that your vote matters just as much as mine in polls.
---
Btw
---
Are you even surprised?
---
People will just make ironman alts to crash people if there were ironman only worlds.
---
Probably dragon imps
---
this is exactly what John Galt took 80~ pages to say in that speech he gave
---
You have a problem because it’s completely sane doing. I don’t know how you act with your friends or s/o but this is what I do. Who does it hurt or affect if I indeed happen to create multiple accounts? It’s you who keeps assuming crucial shit. I might lack it but it doesn’t have anything to do with what I’ve done over this post. The world doesn’t need any favor, it will get destroyed nonetheless what I do. I didn’t know that wanting to bring a positive mindset to someone else brought a vicious thoughts to someone who I don’t even know. That’s a bit more pathetic don’t you think? If you don’t see the problem there are professionals for it
---
We won't know if we never try /s
---
Pretty good loot, how many hours per day?
---
Grats! What are you going to name him?
---
Bruh gold doesnt boost garbage posts
---
I made it to the Wildy volcano earlier.. done the emote and realised I didn’t have the clue..
---
Surprise motherfucker
---
Nerfing an important midgame PvM armour because a small portion of the playerbase is mad that magic defenae armour is good at negating their magic is smart.
---
Just turned 30, hardly middle aged. We’ve had a really nice barbecue and a few drinks. Just though you would like to see Ash in his natural habitat, but if you want to be mean........
---
Replace dreamy eyes, with baggy dark eyes from hardcore xp grinds
---
That's kind of the point... Well, the Pepsi is recreational. The vodka &amp; cigs are to speed life along. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA6e5MkHZjU
---
Got pretty lucky on the rare drops, nice.
---
Scratch that. Twenty!
---
Ya know progression is a thing...
---
I can do everything on iPad except clues and demonic gorillas
---
Just downvote his shit person method of training and move on folks. LOL
---
Wow ...
---
Not even close lol
---
It really isn't that much effort to type. Of course, if you're a BS-ing manchild, I suppose any criticism is a personal attack.
---
Shitty title
---
Nice. Jagex is gonna have probably take this opportunity to nerf barrage slayer meta as a whole. Incoming single-way catacombs.
---
Support
---
4-10 id say, pretty much tried to be there whenever i was online
---
People got 4 months to train for the quest though, and a lot of them are quite easy reqs or already completed like 70 smithing req for ds2
---
You sound like the biggest jackass.
---
Definitely not. The slayer points take waaaaay longer to get than 1m
---
how the hell does it work with potatoes, care to explain?
---
why can i only see 2 of the comments here?
---
If you actually thought about good of the game then you would be still voting no to it
---
This has been posted for like a decade. Fuck off
---
never paid a dime. ty ppl who buy bonds btw &lt;3
---
He’s lucky the US military didn’t raid his house.
---
Stop posting this hoe ffs ! You always do this when you see a fucking girl streaming ... OMG SPEECHLESS !!! Fucking virgins
---
But he did it for a record in a kids video game so it's tight as fuck right?
---
Any red click under an npc stalls it - picking up an item is an example of a red click. Obviously if you pick up the item it's no longer on the ground, so you can drop an item, withdraw all your potatoes to fill your inventory and then repeatedly click to pick up the item on the ground to stall the npc. Then you can attack once every 10 ticks to flinch cerberus.
---
You're trolling, no1 can be this stupid :D 
---
.. i've clear proof of myself and my friends in imgur.
---
Nah it ain’t near personal attack, it would be if they brough up my post history from another account. The thing is that none of this is bullshit. I’m stubborn type so I won’t just let you assume lol. You can’t even give out reconstructive criticism. I have to repeat the same sentences. You believe what you believe but if you assume shit that ain’t true I won’t give in. It’s not even a criticism to assume. Those are two different things
---
Are they stalking a specific player with the intention of preventing them from Edge PvPing for days or weeks on end? 
---
It's the same concept as someone constantly following you around and crashing you, over and over and over, for days/weeks. 
---
That is harassment.
---
Must be fucking nice
---
They're between 40-50 kills per hour usually
---
Do combat xp quests then do birdhouses and herb runs between slayer tasks. Super easy to maintain bonds
---
Aren’t those solo?
---
It's only 67m dude calm down
---
Not many people with 1 def at 126cmb where blakc d hide is a problem.
---
im combining method 2, 3 and 4
---
"An herb" sounds fuckin stupid
---
I also wanna know
---
[deleted]
---
That's your clan
---
Ever heard of SlayerMusiq1?
---
I was one of the few people who was in support of EoC as I understood what the decision was made for. (Pre eoc hit a content wall as everything was already so drastically overpowered)..they could've nerfed everything of course, but it still woudl've resulted in eventually reaching the same issue.) I also understood the potential that it had. 
---
While it certainly made some improvements (the quests as you mentioned)...I really did not like the way they done the abilities. However, I could be biased against them as I was spoiled by Guild War's ability system. I was expecting it to add more strategy to the game, which it unfortunately didn't really as nearly all of the abilities are just damage modifiers, simple bonus damage to next hit, etc. The original Guild Wars on the other hand had shutdowns, pressures, interrupts, buffs, debuffs, etc.  Compare that to RS3 where every class uses about the same ability rotations. Every class was also different while RS3 made melee/range/magic into copypasted versions of each other. 
---
This was since last I tried it though, so perhaps improvements have been made since then, but I doupt it.
---
Well not gonna lie OP is succeeding at life but I’m not. If you’re still mixing me with OP you don’t have to write, save up your time and do something nice with it. Don’t fool around like us. There’s no head, no end. The internet brings mixed feelings and it’s nice to change up the pace once in awhile, but this was unexpected. Didn’t know that this couls hurt someones feelings so hard, we’re just a bunch of supportive friends. Excuse us if we misbehaved :).
---
Get access to another trees, I recommend fossil isle. You can try to cut on PvP worlds
---
yeah but it'd be like "an erb"
---
also sounds stupid lol
---
Conditions: both accounts have membership and have 1 free name change
---
Change name via website on current account --&gt; change name again on current account via bond --&gt; QUICKLY change name of new account via website or in game to the desired name
---
I mean I agree with you, but it's an online game where people are free to do whatever they want.
---
If people get scammed, they (hopefully) learned a valuable lesson
---
If people get crashed while doing a task, they learn that they don't own that tile/area and people can do things that you don't like or do things that are out of their control and they can either deal with it, or find a solution(which would usually be hoping even though theres other solutions)
---
I'm not saying that you SHOULD crash people or that I encourage being a dick to people, but catering to people getting their feelings hurt when they can easily move along or hop worlds leads to the "everyone gets rewarded for nothing" mentality that has ruined lots of games.
---
Looks like you ~~missed~~ ignored my response! I'll paste it down below again so you can see it again and reply.
---
&gt;Alright so assuming for a moment that you aren't the same person as OP. You would have no reason to make a new account (several apparently but I haven't looked at the others) just to comment praise on the post, when you already have an account.
---
Lol some dumb asses do take peds early on to get to that physique, but that physique is achievable naturally for a person in 5 years give or take one or two. Good excuses for not seeing results though lmao yell steroids
---
Yeah that is not steriods. Stop being so jealous lmao.
---
200k/h on at prime time.  Not worth it unless you plan on doing afk headbangs
---
It would be *a* honor to speak differently
---
That wouldn’t stop the splashing problem on like all accounts above 90 combat
---
That's a scout
---
Yeah but it can be annoying at a non 2k world with all the bots and beggars
---
Don't think so, I started playing 2004 and I don't know when ectofunctus was released.
---
Keep your health above 0
---
Ranger boots
---
I have not.
---
Idk. Some people enjoy the grind, it brings them  sense of accomplishement.
---
If you don't find that your naturally setting goals for yourself it's s going to be pretty hard to enjoy rs without friends to mess around with. I had a similar issue before getting members.
---
Dunno what but something needs to be done
---
Ahhh actually sayin it like that doesn't sound quite so stupid thinkin about it...
---
"you got a herb?"
---
"you got an 'erb?"
---
Both work 
---
Merr i retract my previous statement
---
Obviously not, Level 3's would have no DPS. Even a million lvl 3's wouldn't be able to. Just use your brain for once smh.
---
Nah fuck that mate, Happy Birthday!
---
OSRS is much more of a sandbox style than an "amusement park" style that you see in stuff like WoW. You don't really have chaining quests leading you piece by piece through zones and content. You really have to set your own goals and decide what most interests you at the time, along with what your primary objective is.
---
I know they brought back the 1-month membership with Twitch prime, so you might want to look into that to try out members, which has an absolute ton more content than the f2p version. Even if you're not big on the quests, there's a lot more stuff you can do with it. You might be able to find some guides or lists of objectives that help out new accounts which can give some direction.
---
39 days
---
Im not on my way!
---
Add tag: humour
---
What's always helped me is to remember that you're not doing the quest just to unlock what you need right now, but unlock everything you'll need it for in the future. For instance, I had a Master clue that required Mourning's End part 2, one of the worst quests in the game. What got me to do it was realizing that if I did it I would be able to do that clue step any time I get it, the hard clue step requiring ME2, and Song of the Elves. I'm Pretty sure Tai Bwo Wannai Trio has a lot more content locked behind it and isn't nearly as hellish.
---
Dont tell me you've been doing tree runs by teleporting to Draynor and running east? Or worse, teleporting to Lumbridge and running all the way around the general store
---
1. Gain farming levels 
---
2. Unlock fissile island
---
3. Plant  teak trees there 
---
4. Cut your own personal teaks ;)
---
Can you change primordial crystal to pegasian crystal?
---
They're the exact same rate, it's just that then you'd never be upset about a drop at cerb because if you don't get it then you make money.
---
Not possible: you can't use rings of recoil against drakan and be forced to gain some levels. And the Quest requirements have combat too wich cant be done with rings of reccoil
---
Introverts*******
---
it's clear you've never pk'd before. You're the same guy that tried to argue to make ghostly robes have a defense requirement lmfao (which would remove their only purpose and become dead content).
---
A maxed main (full ancestral, arcane, tormented bracelet), splashed on my dhides 4 times letting me escape the team for a box. That shouldn't be a thing (as much as I hate getting clanned). It's double d'hide that's a problem. 20 defense mains that can wear xeric chest still get frozen just as much as pures do. I've faced numerous zerks on my pure that have like 70 magic with full black d'hide, still splashing against them with my 95 magic. Or even on my main, while fighting chin hunters people have 80 magic with double d'hide and I splash just as much in mystics.
---
Weird you say "that channel" and not Wildependant lmao
---
I'm far from worried, and running a marathon isn't healthy either lmao. Don't concern about my, I'm in great physical shape, and I'll be playing less RS again after max. giving up when you're over 90% there would just be a retarded thing to do.
---
While addy/rune/dragon darts do much more damage than mithril darts, people use mith darts because they have the highest dmg to cost ratio. If you're looking to use blowpipe for general range training, mith darts should be your ammo if you want to keep the cost low.
---
Oh I know. It's not even that quests are that difficult or even time consuming, I just can't be assed to sit down and do them. Like, I had membership for over a month before I did druidic ritual. I'm too stubborn to play this game right way. I just want to afk and skill and quests take too much effort for my feeble brain.
---
Kill the monks with melee then pick ip with your hands, you will be faster than the spell
---
Go see a psychiatrist. Those are bad symptoms to have. Thats the behavior of possibly becoming a depressed hardcore drug addict later on.
---
Kill the monks with melee then pick ip with your hands, you will be faster than the spell. Or go to 500 skill total
---
&gt;Why the fuck is this relevant to any of us
---
Protip: Stop giving a fuck
---
I think the first paragraph should say gap in the wall not gab :) well done mate
---
An honourable thing indeed
---
Maybe Club Penguin is more your speed
