A league with 4 relics: N,S,W or E. From that point you can only travel in that direction. If you get stuck you can be sent back to a respawn point

The icon where the quest tab is located is the one from leagues.

I’d love nothing more then for Jagex to bring Keldagrim back to life! It’s such a massive area and it’s beautifully created, imo I think they should add another GE there. I think it would be sick and shine some light on the area.
---
Coz u been playing private servers with me
---
You joke but I’d play the fuck outa some blackjack
---
That makes sense. I think for guardians, rune pick is a no brainer. I assumed it wasn’t for that
---
Yeah but you'd get like 5 times the points you need for a pouch, spend the rest on sellable stuff and make the cash back.
---
That, and woodcutting.
---
I don't see any craps, imma vote no.
---
Gz yo
---
Craps table best table.
---
You just want them to build you the best pool and portal nexus for cheap.
---
No pickles! I mean vambs!
---
Drop rate is 1/65 so..
---
They both increase your damage though, so instead of maxing 30, you'll max a 33 for example
---
If the OG game is still new to you and you're having fun, than stick with your main. Leagues will be back. I wouldn't invest all the time in leagues since the account gets reset at the end. Once your bored with your main leagues is a great time sink.
---
I'm not sure how much work this takes, but is it at all possible to design just a new map for twisted leagues so we're all learning at the same time?
---

---
The most fun part for me is that it feels like I'm learning the game again, and I think that's cause zeah is relatively unused for its size, so we're all learning new methods.

I knew I had bad luck at battows but I just checked. In 859 chests, I only ever got a K coif and bolt racks.
---
This is always the exact reply to someone who links that subreddit
---
If you go fighter torso and legs, the torso is -40 mage attack, just make sure you stay above -65 otherwise you'll splash your crumble undead
---
why is this here
---
Yea only 10 houre per drop not rare at all /s
---
Holy shit
---
Our god has spoken. Rune pick it is lads
---
Take this downvote
---
It's really not.... do your research my dude. It's given to children because of its good safety profile.
---
Well there isn't one so...
---
no?
---
Not sure if sarcasm, but you need the fighter torso for a master clue step.
---
Who cares tho, its like 60xp. One incidental hit and you're leveled up. Shit happens
---
Meanwhile I can't get a fucking msb haha that's actually pogchamp tho Gratz!
---
I agree there's no harm done here and likely never will be, but i still think it's just better to write the check you actualy want to happen.
---
Ain't one at a time is it
---
Surprised theres no why fletch
---
Enable protect from Magic when Kamil appears. Thank me later.
---
excuse me but W H A T
---
Nice.
---
You explicitly mention Shadowlands, so you might want to actually construct a real argument before trying to fling shit. 
---
&gt;OSRS has more content than retail.
---
Objectively wrong. Doing the same 2 "raids" and 10 "normal" bosses for 2000+ kc isn't "more content". WoW won the mmo game of all time, that isn't even a debate.
---
the check x &gt; n-1 is mathematically equivalent to x =&gt; n when x and n are integers. It's the same exact check either way, both are perfectly valid.
---
This is true, it's definitely the anti-afk relic lol.
---
you forgot about vambraces
---
not the point
---
not the point here.
---
Do it again
---
Hydra is also locked behind arguably one of longest grinds in the entire game. A 95 slayer req is nothing to sneeze at.
---
No vambs.
---
We’ve been bamboozled
---
that corrupt mode will stilll have the time limit, the problem with normal gauntlet is the time limit makes it not possible to obtain a full t3 gear yet. Why even add it then?
---
Another idea is to add a 'lower level' with no time limit but reward chest only gives 1 drop roll or something.
---
Set yourself some quest goals. I knew the game from playing when I was young, so I was able to get recipe for disaster done really quickly, which you definitely want to get done. Plus it familiarizes you with different members skills. I’d recommend looking to get recipe for disaster done.
---
Easiest is what you make of it. 2.2k sort of happens. RS is all about setting goals, so adapt your playstyle. Woodcut Redwoods if you want to chill, or fish, do maniacal monkeys for chill hunter, 99 pray on wildy altar, smithing addy plates, for a few ideas.
---
They're recorded in chat but the version that has its own message screen that stops your actions only starts after lvl 30
---
Totally fair. I just think that by the time you've grinded enough to get multiple spirit trees and the levels needed to grow two, it would be nice to be able to use them. The appeal of trekking across Zeah wears out a bit after running back to the farming guild 30-40 times, and there aren't many other great transport methods to get to that side of the map. Charge dragonstone jewelry doesn't work (no legends quest), so if you get a skills necklace, you won't be using it for very long. And you can't get a gold leaf to build a jewelry box containing a skills necklace in your house, either. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I chose endurance, so it's not a huge problem for me, but the spirit tree patches are there, and it seems a shame they won't get any use. Before the mods mentioned that you couldn't use them in the Q&amp;A, I was grinding hard for 88 farming (to boost to 91 for two trees) because it seemed like the next logical quality of life upgrade for me. I forgot about the tree gnome village requirement. I just don't see any major downside to giving us that quest's completion; it benefits everyone who puts in the time.

This is copied from the Twisted League Knowledgebase Discord server:
---
Arceuus spellbook
---
The Arceuus spellbook as 3 viable teleportations:
---
&gt;Arceuus Home Teleport
---
&gt;Battlefront Teleport (23 magic, 1 Law, 1 Earth, 1 Fire rune)
---
&gt;Respawn Teleport (27 magic, 1 Law, 1 Soul rune)
---
&gt;The Battlefront teleport will be one of the best ways to access the farming guild, important for future farming contracts.
---
&gt;Respawn teleport will be one of the many ways to get to kourend castle.
---
&gt;Arceuus Home teleport brings you to the dark altar
---
**Normal spellbook**
---
&gt;House Teleport (Kourend Castle)
---
&gt;Teleport to house (40 Magic, 1 Law, 1 Earth, 1 Air rune)
---
&gt;Teleport to Kourend Castle (69 Magic, 2 Law, 2 Soul, 5 Fire, 4 Water)
---
Teleport to house is teleport very close to the Hosidius farming patch, which could be usefull for farming runs, before getting enough Fangs
---
**Lovakengj Minecart Network**
---
&gt;With 65% Lovakengj favour you can unlock the minecart system around Zeah, mainly having 1 in each faction &amp; 1 in CoX
---
&gt;Teleports cost 50 GP each, or a 1 time payment of 100k GP
---
**Tithe farm minigame teleport**
---
&gt;With 34 :Farming~1: you unlock the Tithe farm teleport.
---
&gt;It's a free teleport to the hosidius house
---
The only acceptable punishment is death
---
You can tell it's photoshopped because of the way it is
---
It was pretty shitty. I thought I'd never need to do slayer again on multiple occasions now. Like when I hit 99 slayer ... or after I finished alchemical hydra.... and then the basilisk knights came out. I burned through all of my slayer points grinding out alchemical hydra for the lance. 
---
I've a pro when it comes to bad luck though.

The yellow tiles indicate the tile he is moving to based on his click, the black tiles are the ones he already placed.

hunter (17 levels),construction(7 levels), fletching(7 levels), farming(4 levels), firemaking(7 levels), thieving (8 levels), smithing(14 levels),prayer(14 levels), heblore(9 levels) then u got 9 more levels, you can do some agility, fishing,mining , defense etc
---
Why would you do that?
---
Is this a troll post? You will never die to rng if you play correctly. Xzact does consistent runs with sub 70 hp, you just aren't good enough.
---
Rng can make some waves very hard, but if you get stacked over 99 damage in one tick you fucked up HORRIBLY. You're always starting with pray mage up, only one wave has two rangers. Every single other wave it is literally impossible to get one tick spanked without having time to react, and the only wave it's even possible is considered a joke.
---
Seriously, every other person has some sort of clue unique and most of them have under 10 clues completed. Has to be bumped up.
---
Yeah for some reason my brain didn't process that way. Thanks.

Very nice idea.

You’re getting close to the drop rate at least :)

Obviously buyables

This just reads like a shitty flex post
---
They aren't widely used or talked about really. I was trying to learn as much as I could about them but was struggling to find good tips on using them.
---
Don't quote me I could be wrong but I think it used to allow for it and people would lure people to drop their stuff and a stack of say 60 Uri's or Wizards would be on the loot so they couldn't get their stuff back.
---

what is the name of this bot?
---
Woox is prettiest princess.
---
Ah nice, thanks for replying.
---
✋😁  I remember the first time I changed my username I thought I'd have to start using the new username lol
---
I also advise going for the Recipe for Disaster. It's got like 10 parts, many doable right away. 
---
Another quest is Monkey Madness. Dragon Scimitars are very good.
---
Wait really? Proselyte over something like Ahrim’s?
---
I think you're right. I just take things too literally when people say them. Like that time that someone said "imagine working a full time job yeah? then taking a half day break, finish twisted leagues and go back to work. because that's what woox just did" and I thought they were saying something. Then I got accused of trolling for not understanding the... joke, I guess? I don't know. I guess I dont understand post-post-postmodern memes.
---
Played UIM for a while and you're right, it's how it should be but for now, playing like that is hugely restrictive for some of us. If I had to drop my ahrim/karil/dharok each time I have to do some skilling, that wouldn't be fun and there would be no point to even grind for those items either.
---
Would be much better if you could just store those sets in your POH but that's not the case :/
---
Be a redditor

Once I kicked jad to death in 12 minutes cause I ran out of darts

If you can trigger gyazo you can trigger sharex with the same button.
---
Looked up on them, they do seem kinda interesting but at this point I think you are better off using a normal potion
---
Gets to 99 bans you DO IT AGAIN
---
I regret accumulator everyday and I keep playing, lol it hasn’t stopped but it made me know I need to really plan next time
---
Why?
---
Repost much?
---
I just have it pinned to the taskbar so it’s just a click of the mouse. I don’t want to use hoykeys
---
I still love how you guys meme jagex for bots. You really don't have an idea how good they are at banning bots. 
---
Just like any other game, bots will always come back. Every game his this issue, even league of legends. 
---
It's only more noticeable here because of how RS plays.
---
If you got the money, construction prayer and Fletching are all pretty quick buyables. Todt to 99 fm. Then, I'd go thieving and herblore. At some point get agility done, maybe first to get some slightly better xp rates elsewhere. When you can't pay too much attention to the game, afk fishing and redwoods or do nmz to max those combats.
---
Most osrs players don’t have real jobs
---
posted before
---
Yeah, vork is really easy once you get the basic mechanics down. It kind of a building up boss where you start out learning basic mechanics then building upon them, such as turning off prayers during bith special attacks and then implementing a woox walk for acid

Lumbridge teleport!

I think the graveyard room is worse actually feels like it takes ages just to deposit the fruit

this is happening to me too!

No it's not. Check the eff slayer guide lmao you dont unlock jad

No problem man usually fast finding someone

Am I just stupid or did he not get chaps? They just look like regular black chaps to me.
---
When the clue bois fight back :o
---
It's like 40k xp in sub 1 hour if you know how to do caves. If the guide leaves that out it sounds pretty shit.
---
Oh damn ok nvm
---
Here I am in twisted league sitting around with my 5 gloves and 3 torches at 120kc
---
you're right. Not enough feet in this one
---
I thought the GY was by far the fastest out of them. 
---
The maze room feels so damn clunky for me.
---
That's the thing for me, I don't get nearly as much enjoyment right now as i would if I had endless endurance especially now that I have planned out what build I wanted. In fact, its actually more annoying to play than it is fun right now. I just wish I could start over :(
---
have a real time anti virus running when looking up your hentai
---
I mean, if you're gonna go that far, vambs are missing too.
---
Yes
---
Mom says my devotion to osrs is NEET
---
and i stole a few from her lol
---
He hardly plays, only plays when big update comes otherwise he says he gets bored
---
6k slay xp in 10 minutes its 36k /hr. which is really really bad.
---
WOAH FUCKIN CHILL HOMIE
---
RuneLite. OSB is shady and any other client is irrelevant
---
It would give real cash value to runescape gp, therefore it would basically be a legitimate currency, like bitcoin etc. It would attract all the legal issues associated with that.
---
They were different times. Zezima was a champion among us kids. He knew about no xp waste while we went out and fished lobsters for hours on karamja. Same with the old nite, he got interviewed by some kid and that was his advice no xp waste. Woox has brought in an insane amount of skill.
---
I just did b2p for the first time ever yesterday and the alch was the worst for me by far. The maze wasn't that bad and I kept graveyard for last so I was motivated to do it well.
---
I also finished all hards today for the first time ever too so im not sure what to do next!
---
Been outnofnthe loop for a while but Instill browse the sub sometimes.  What is "leagues?"
---
&gt;All of them have their ups and down sides
---
What? What is the downside to infinite run and 4x faster health regen? What is the downside to being able to select your slayer tasks? What is the downside to not taking damage and getting more loot at wintertodt?This statement is totally baseless. 
---
Most of the relics are straight buffs, but a few have unintended side effects which make the game experience worse in niche situations. They should all be direct buffs, and the **only** drawback should be the fact that you can only choose one per tier.
---
Boss is crystalline hunllef
---
Its possible, but only if you git gud.
---
A tip of my fedora to ya good sir that's quite the grind.

---
Well that’s very good to hear lol.
---

---
We pay we gay
---
Cballs are bad because although they are super afk, they make hardly any money
---
Even if you spend an hour a day on your alt you need to make 400k/hour to just maintain a bond
---
So you kind of need really strong moneymaking methods to get any profit because i cant spend 3 hours a day making cannonballs no matter how afk it is
---
The issue is Classic WoW is in the beginning stages. You are comparing classic WoW in its current state to the new advanced OSRS. Classic WoW has so much more content at Phase 4 than OSRS could ever have. Plus it is far more skill based. But I also dislike how much I have to click in OSRS.
---
Bro I would have nutted right then and there

Cannon lives matter

Whoa man you've got way more to rags hammers than that other guy

guthan spear is the only item im missing at 1.6k kc

How many times it take you guys to do a successful inferno run?
---
KBD and a few of the wildy bosses/demi bosses like chaos ele. Giant mole.
---
I agree. Im committing lots of time to this based on the idea that i might achieve things others wont.
---
No service is identical to another competing service- all of them have pros and cons. This is true for everything. It's true for internet and it's true for mmo's. Saying they aren't the same is kinda dumb cuz like, ofc they aren't

uh idk 350-400k if purely auto chiseling? i really dont know for sure tho

What do you mean? Being a Gamer is a full time job

---
Don't think I've ever seen that pet before either
---
Some of the things you’re suggesting are just to ease the burden brought on by someone’s preferred method of gaining points, which is generally a byproduct of what relics they choose. For instance, if you decided to 200m thieving, fishing, agility, magic, runecrafting, farming, and herblore there would be 0 player competition and you would most likely gain enough points to buy all of the League rewards. Would it be fun? Probably not, but that idea nullifies some of these suggestions.
---
Ultimately, Twisted Leagues was made to have an element of competition to it with the resources. If there’s enough of everything for everyone to do whatever they want, the game mode becomes a lot less fun.
---
What you think happens to Molly everytime a nibba teles in there. She's not wanting you to catch her twin. She wants the *staff*
---
Absolute worst damned room. It'd be better if there was more than like, five "puzzles". 
---
At least if you start with Bones to Peaches the graveyard damage can be healed through. The enchanting room you just burn through. The alchemy room can be non-terrible experience.
---
Telegrab 'puzzle' room can eat my ass.

Grats on an extra 66k I guess

I get about 60k total exp at Jad

If you were wondering about the series of events - 
---
-&gt;Revenant was fighting Ancient Fury
---
-&gt;Reign of Terror crashes the fight with Sovereign
---
-&gt;Revenant and Ancient Fury fight back vs Reign of terror + Sovereign
---
-&gt;Divine Kings+1750 revs+2k revs+Skulled Revs + Divine Kings go to help Reign of terror/Sovereign
---
-&gt;Jaja+Chivalry Legions went to go help Revenant/Ancient Fury
---
Fight went on for 32hours, Reign of Terror/Sovereign side dropped a lot of numbers leading them to be outnumbered after 2 hours - but tried dragging it out hoping they would gain numbers. They gave up and started 1iteming 30 hours in, and eventually called it off 32hours in.

Can be a portforwarding issue, had this problem with ny 4g router. I opened port 43594 and the issue was gone.
---
Early-mid game Ironman is the most fun time I’ve ever had playing RS. I haven’t gotten to the insane grinds yet though but I’m like 1600 total and it feels way better to play on than my 1900 main
---
sorry im only 60 combat, my bad
---
shame the af/rev alliance let RoT win lol, you guys have 9 clans in that discord and u cant even beat 90 RoT? SMH this could've finally been RoT's first wilderness loss of OSRS
---
why don’t you just play for fun, the trophies are the rare and impressive items anyways. not sure why you’d stress over tradeable items, anyone who has money and didn’t play league will have them right along with you
---
I’ll have to test this, interesting
---
you realize 6k points isnt even close to all of the rewards tho right
---
Damn bro.. I’m like 200kc and nothing
---
Interesting. And what happens after the 2 months?
---
Should really use an alt and pull from both rooms so you’re killing 8 at a time vs 2
---
A polished turd is still a turd. Being better than horrible doesn't mean it's good, or even mediocre. It means it's not horrible. It's still bad at catching anything but the most obvious suicide botters, and the suicide botters are the least of our worries.
---
Still not good enough to detect an NMZ bot that runs 24 hours per day for weeks on end.
---
Still not good enough to ban Zulrah bots in the top 500 highscores for magic, but with every other level at minimum requirement to unlock zulrah.
---
Still not good enough to ban rune-buying bot farm of 200 bots that controlled the market for cosmics for months.
---
Still not good enough to ban the actual hundreds of bots at the lumbridge spinning wheel at every single second of every single day.
---
Still not good enough to ban the tens of bots at the oak tree outside the west Varrock bank in F2P that are there 24/7.
---
Still not good enough to ban dicing bots that all wear the exact same thing every time spouting the exact same lines over and over while paying off pmods to silence opposition.
---
Still not good enough to ban the slayer bots that sit at certain slayer levels and do nothing but get infinite melee exp making profit on gargs, wyverns, or other creatures.
---
Still not good enough to ban CoX bots for over a year. Still not good enough to find ToB bots.
---
If they weren't manually investigating every inferno cape they'd never catch anyone who botted it, if they do at all.
---
You speak in an accent like a nobel prize winner and you sound a lot more respectable
---
yea i got my jaw off task on my ironman like 83 kc or something.. whew
---
They do get banned every 1-2 days actually. Zulrah lasts 3-7 days based on client &amp; proxy. Dice bots are banned daily, but they are replaced on ban.
---
Their system is only really good at detecting public bots. Private bots last way longer, but they still eventually get banned.
---
If they get instantly banned then the script makers will know the reason why they got banned and patch it. How about u think for urself or in fact do some research and understand their methodologies. Jagex has really uped their game in bot detection recently.
---
Some bots don't get detected as they are insanely good and come at a cost. Most bots do and at an absurdly high rate.
---
i tried it with some friends for abouy 10 minutes. it kinda worked. but it seems too inconsistent without a longer testing period.
---
For team?  Yeah it is.  You dont need to run in a 3c really at all.  You could easily bring 3 strange fruit per raid and get by.  Endurance people either get robbed pts in the raid (no ruby e bolts) or miss out on hundreds of raids from having to farm rubys and addy bars/bolts.
---
Me too, started maybe 3 or 4 hours ago and have tried out runelite which works though I'm afraid to close the window after logging out, because what happened to my osrs client might happen to runelite.
---
The points youve earned from completing tasks can be spent on various rewards for your main account. Some are tradeable, some not. A lot of people seem to be excited about the house recoloring. I don't really know the rewards. I just love the game mode
---
Oh I thought it was closer to like 45k, my bad.
---
Imagine not having treasure seeker
---
14 days from when you log in. Hope this helps!
---
I love how Jagex manages to look like an actual indie company despite how much the company is worth and having over a decade of experience.
---
She looks like sid from ice age fix her eyes ffs
---
Yea maybe read a newspost every once in a while
---
Back when returning first became meta, clans were a lot more reasonable about it and would call it off and stop returning if it was clear they were just getting completely destroyed and were completely outdone. Fights were still a few hours back then, but the max was probably like 6 hours and the average much less. But over time, it became more and more meta to simply use returning as a stalling tactic and hope the other clan simply got bored and left (or, if you had a timezone advantage, stall it out so their members went to bed and yours woke up again the next day), so then you could claim victory. That's how you get these 14+ hour fiestas where half the fight one side is just getting completely decimated but as long as you run back and die over and over you can say that your side is still fighting and hasn't lost yet. 
---
Clans will usually claim victory and leave if the other side starts 1-iteming too much during their returns, but of course the 1-iteming side denies that and claims that *they* won because the other side left. Then you start the multi-day post-match "fight" on the RSB Clan Discussion board (RIP) where you argue over which side was the true winner, and everyone in all the other clans responds "gg &lt;x&gt;, looked easy" depending on which clan their own clan has the bigger rivalry with.
---
Could easily be I'm just guessing
---
"imagine doing this as an ironman lmao"
---
Authenticator is savior.

I would actually love this.

Yah no on that.  Go to rs3 for graphics

I love that game. Always a pleasure playing it at a silky smooth 19 fps.

Are clue scroll rate rewards lowered in Twisted?

How tf did anyone know what was going on though?  Seemed like people just spammed clicked the tele spot with ice barrage.

I asked the RL team about it, they told me to ask Jagex to do it lol

Damn 789m spent on imps means you profited from just the rangers.
---
Why deleted?
---
With your stats I used to safe spot venenatis with a buddy of mine using rune crossbow Ruby bolts e then into diamond e to finish off. Being welfare gear so you don't lose much from deaths. Venenatis 1/128 roll for dragon pick was awesome. It was a great bank booster for my early game

glad they changed it then but that's hilarious

Weak propaganda btw
---
Don't worry you're probably already on their list of who to fuck over.
---
Theres a bot in w330 doing the fally shortcut over and over lol
---
nah, i think i fucked up on this one.
---
But how much playtime in total?
---
You do know the turnover on those gambling bots is like less than a day, right? What do you want them to do about it? They frequently get muted by mods, or automatically muted already. 
---
The person who runs them uses external servers to run his bots so you can't just IP ban him since he'll just switch servers. Jagex can't just hire one person to go around banning all of the gambling bots they see. The market for gambling services is already very difficult to enter into since Jagex is so keen on automatically banning/muting your advertising bots. The fact that its only profitable for just 1 or 2 people is good enough for me. There isn't much else they can do.
---
But only if you have angler gloves
---
Welcome back
---
My buddy just got a kite on 121 clues
---
May the rng gods be with you
---
I haven't got runelite but I'm unable to open the OSRS client as of today. stuck with black screen and ''Loading Configuration - 0%''. Perhaps these are related?
---
repost
---
Literally all Jagex has to do to make this room bearable is
---
a) Make us regain run energy while casting Telegrab, or alternatively give us infinite run; and
---
b) Make Telegrab instant, so the guy starts moving right when you cast the spell
---
It is fucking misery to do this room.
---
Haha
---
Smithing (rune 2hs at lvl 99) and Runecrafting (Bloods at 77) are definitely the best, but both take a long time to set the account up. Fishing is decent (sacred eels and anglers are both good), and don't take nearly as long to set up.
---
Honorable mention to making Tabs. It's skilling, but uses a combat skill, so idk if it counts. Also it is no longer good money. I made 500k/hr doing Bones-to-Peaches tabs, then 300k/hr doing House Tabs...but now they're both about 100k/hr, because bots :(
---
But i bet you love clicking the same monster all nice and safe with 0 risk
---
okay lol
---
they can do that though. i'd do it for free actually, because it's so fucking easy. there's no hop limit rn either and all these fucks literally dress the same and spam the same message. it's not like there's any doubt about it or that they are hard to locate lol. also doesn't take much logic to think that someone with 35m mage exp from using a trident at zulrah likely isn't a legit player.
---
I found a post somewhere that suggested resetting the router for my fix, and it worked. So try that out and see if it doesn't help ya out
---
You don't have to do it without stamina potions, you know that. There's no rush.
---
I believe you still have to manually trim the quest and achievement capes
---
I'm having the same problem right now
---
Staff of balance auto casts claws of guthix
---
Staff of light for sara strike
---
Staff of the dead for flames of zammy
---
Inshallah, Falador shall burn.
---
Where do you get it back if you lose it ? Cant seem to ind anything on it
---
Thanks for the positive feedback 🙄
---
More reason collect them spades, baby!
---
Everyone does something different but I went to solo Rex with trident at 75 and got pretty lucky there.
---
I did it on task and at the time the rings were 5m.
---
If I were you I'd be aiming at Zulrah but it depends on how willing you are to learn in error. I say that because there's a cost associated with learning Zulrah that doesn't really exist for Barrows or solo Rex.
---
You can also duo the Daganoth Kings if you have blowpipe trident and a friend who has the same.
---
74 and I have no graceful
---
apparently it was only since the last game update that it was doable. Hard to say, everyone is super secretive about it.
---
I recently placed a willow sapling in the varrock tree patch and it has been fully grown into a tree. I have read that the tool leprechaun can note any type of log, that has been harvested via farming. But after using Willow log-&gt;Tool Leprechaun he says:"nay, I've got no banknotes for that item"
---
Do i need to get bank notes somewhere or did I missunderstood something?
---
Showing collection log?
---
So is your comment bruh
---
Simone’s here laid in those chaps
---
There are 3 kind of osrs players, those who watch video quest guides, and those who read quest guides/quick guides from wiki. And then there are those who don't quest, but we don't talk about them.
---
Congrats man. Any tips? 1900 total amd thinking about pushing hard for it
---
I do. Make them so obvious you know them for 100 years god damn. Like birth city or mothers middle name. They still are secure cause no one else has your memeory
---
Wholesome
---
And I'm talking about if I lose it 50 + wild , unskulled,  at scorpia
---
Just make a new account? OSRS is a fresh start anyways, so unless you have some sentimental attachment to your old name or something, no reason to not just make a new account. 
---
To answer your question though, Jagex Support is about as reliable as dad’s who swear they’re only going to the store and they’ll be right back. Unless you have lots of money or clout, you’ll never see them again.
---
He wouldn't even lose his pikachu not skulled
---
People could bruteforce your password, but they'd need to know your email address first. If nobody knows your rs email address it doesn't matter if you tell people your password.
---
The people that get hacked are people who click on dodgy stuff, or they get hacked by a friend who knows their password.
---
Any 3rd age?
---
Same here.
---
Are you ok?
---
Yeah, I'm getting it too. 
---
Last time it happened it got fixed by itself after waiting for a little while.
---
I'd like to know this too
---
you still gotta find the entrance to the underground portion and explore there for a bit
---
The bottom
---
Damn Chad how many girls you fuck in a night? 30? 40?
---
Or maybe box wizard for hours to ruin clues for everyone hmm..
---
Yes, it's called marketing. It was like removing the head phone jack. Since apple did it, it wasn't as hated. Imagine if Samsung did it first lmaooooooo
---
Blocking them is a waste of points

You have your facts entirely wrong here

why is this a video
---
This is what a failed ahk script or a mouse recorder program looks like in action most of the time.
---
Best part is you can just grab a picture of the login screen to cover it up lol
---
new anti repost meta
---
Long read but great
---
Only if they were going to train rc in the long term anyways. The benefit is just qol, getting task and cancelling in the same location and not swapping spellbook between burst/contact npc.
---
You can boost from 86 as well, 2.3m less rc xp.
---
how  could i have been so blind, this is huge brain
---
No vambs though ! Nice tho holy shit.
---
People like you are the reason Jesus hasnt returned to earth.
---
I used a botting tool once. Thought why not everyone else does. Used it for two hours and got caught.
---
After my ban one morning I was smelting in Edgeville seen a bunch of gamers all dressed the same running back and forth from furnace to bank they were definitely bots. I was on for just over an hour. Went out came back later in the day and the same people were still the doing the same thing. Must have been 8/9 hours and I bet they are still going without getting caught.
---
I have kids...
---
Btw btw😉🤘🏽😏
---
Ah, I remember when I was a young country so full of people that I could burst, those were the days.
---
Rune drags become low focus because of the justiciar
---
It's what 5 wrong tries before it locks you out for a few mins? Even assuming 100 tries an hour that would still take a few hundred years minimum to brute force a password of 10 characters or more
---
0 prayer potion dose if you have the expected prayer bonuses for Catacombs barrage and bone crusher for dust Devils. Still need pot for nechryaels though
---
You know you’re a baller when you can afford to keep your rewards lmao
---
What’s the backstory here?
---
So what you’re saying is that we should start beheading all runescape players so there is no one alive to buy gold anymore. You have a good point, that might just work
---
Ever heard of... You know, screenshots?
---
That's a lot of clues
---
Out of curiosity, why?
---
Correct!
---
Hey u was in di too? What years from ?
---
Oo thats really nice of you boomer .XD
---
Okay i'm clearly blind, I'm sorry and thank you for your answer.
---
Ah you mean a specific monster wiki page.
---
What happened? Could you pm please king?
---
Yeah man, good luck hunting
---
Ps on low defence monsters focus on high str bonus, with high def you will more often need accuracy.
---
shut the fuck up
---
Thank you for the tips!
---
Well shh then?
---
A "niche game" that has more players than any steam game except for the big 3.
---
This is one of the few ways that gold and items leave the game
---
I don't want to be banned for bug abuse. /s
---
Read the closing of my original comment.
---
The author of the spreadsheet estimated 400-500 hours depending on how quickly you can quest etc. Of course a lot of that is just afking in NMZ though.
---
There's plenty of people even risking their high lvl accounts at the myth guild runite rocks. I would go back there every couple of hours to afk/hop rune rocks and I see the same few guys hopping every single time I go there and they are there for months never a time when i dont see them even at 2am my time
---
Thanks RoT bot, very cool. Btw 1 iteming to stretch on the war is opposite of winning
---
Curious about the price check
---
Pm me about the incident?
---
Will they garnish my loot rolls ?
---
That makes little sense. 
---
* If you are a Pker and own a Rune pouch and it's about to get pk'd by other, you will lose the Rune pouch, therefore destroying or not will get you nothing
---
* If you are a PvM'r and own a Rune pouch and is about to die to a Mob, you keep the rune pouch, therefore you should never destroy the pouch
---
* If you are a pvmer getting pk'd, destroying the pouch gets you nothing as the pker can't have it and it will be destroyed regardless... 
---
Im confused with your answer
---
Every once in a while it randomly turns on again right?
---
If you’re playing twisted league, it’s a meme around wintertodt. To tell Joel to get on skype
---
Is that almost 1b from rangers alone lol
---
Did a robot make this? What does the title and the image even mean?
---
I loved Dungeoneering. It was best and highest skill for me in Rs2.
---
Also you could make good money from that skill in F2P/P2P by selling floors.
---
I'd definitely recommend getting 65% Lova and unlocking minecarts, can pay 100k to use them for free, very nice method of TP'ing that doesn't use runes/charges
---
It's a skill. Doesnt matter how you see it
---
Oooh, thx
---
Higher*
---
HIGHER, THE KING OF THE SKY
---
You've only done 3k barrows chest, those are rookie numbers, let's get that that KC to 5 figures and see if you're still missing any pieces...
---
Thats not a problem- runelites farming tracker doesnt cheat and 3p clients cant do that anymore even if they wanted to
---
Geomancy is the only way to check for death/disease other than being physically near the patch.
---
jajajajajajaja
---
Would you say, from implings, you profited?
---
If one were to not get these through implings, what would be the best way to get them? Fally guards?
---
nice
---
Bruh use your f keys youd save so much mouse travel time
---
I'm still missing the purple and pink elegant blouses at 2.5k med clues. The shirts I have multiple of, but the blouses are fuckin' elusive! 113/115 forever.
---
Like 10-15 good runs. But i also planked on triples and zuk more than avg.
---
OMG, congratulations.
---
Yesterday I got Thieving pet at 33m exp but to be hones I wasnt exited for it so I ensure it then I destroy it after few hours.
---
Alchemist room is the worst imo
---
Found the Revenant member lol
---
I selected arcane courrier as my tier 2 relic.. You honestly can't complain unless you have this perk. I have to go to the bank to pick up my logs if I want to fletch or train firemaking &gt;:C
---
99 rc
---
LMFAOOOO
---
Yeah its something you have to get use to, but i like the kickstand the logitech keyboard case combo has.
---
and why should people be doing master clues? Are you an elitist?
---
Same af from pre-OSRS?
---
“Smh my head” = “shake my head my head.” Stop that.
---
/u/chronolis 
---
you only need 82 farming and can boost with a garden pie to get into the high tier farming guild.
---
and at 71 you can boost with the pie to plant the highest tier seed at tithe farm, which makes it so turning in 100 fruits gives you ~175k exp instead of 100k which makes the grind go a lot quicker.
---
as another guy said, the gem stall task is a pretty easy 250 points for the requirements.
---
another thing that's overloaded with points is wintertodt. getting 50m or 100m exp isn't that long of a grind since you get 5m+ exp/hr at 99 firemaking and theres a ton of tasks involved.
---
&lt;3
---
Meanwhile riot made 1.7 Billion and Blizzard made 7.5 Billion.
---
But yeah, you keep pretending 92M is an unlimited Budget
---
You can't damage the guardians with anything other than a pickaxe. He was calculating the dps difference between Whip and Pickaxe on stab against Vasa's crystals
---
Yeah for real grab a friend or a little brother nd a bond and tell them to just start looting
---
because you can do 1 boss fast doesnt mean having boss tasks enabled isnt dogshit
---
Slayer is set as the filter at the moment. You can change it to anything you want
---
I disliked it at first, but now I somewhat like it. The interior needs work though
---
I don't know if they changed it but you can log in the site without authenticator and remove it.
---
Ahahha
---
Post it anyway! Don’t let one person’a massive accomplishment take away your respectable one.
---
Loool
---
yeah I dont think you get what im getting at. 6k isnt top end. tier 1 armor is 1k, tier 2 is 2.5k, tier 3 is 10k. the banner is 750, the helm is 6k, home tele is 750, poh is 4k. The top 1% players should be able to afford the t3 armor, slayer helm, poh, home tele, and banner if they so choose. that is 21500 points.
---
Is that a real kick message though?
---
not all of them heal either but are very handy for 10hp irons
---
Blast furnace tho
---
Sounds like a rargh and link pvp challenge
---
&gt; You have to stick to doing one activity until completion if possible though, as regearing takes a lot of time.
---
This is the biggest thing keeping me from playing UIM. It looks like fun from the outside, and I love playing on my regular IM, but I find myself bouncing between activities way too frequently for me to not have access to a bank.
---
V
---
Good fucking lord
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Is going back to that horrible place worth the pet? The recolor is kind of cool actually.
---
Uh... No.
---
Imagine being so greedy you loot 200k instead of participating lmao
---
Yeah it shows like that for everybody for whatever reason.
---
CoD Zombies. Ah shit, here we go again meme. 
---
Sign me up!
---
Wow
---
Wow gz
---
Wow, thank you for the detailed response! I want to go until I get the bird, I already have artisan but I’m still about 1200 away from t4. I was torn between dhins or clue hunter, I think I’ll just have to wait and see if I get the bird lol
---
Who are you?
---
these are neat but do you draw originals or just trace other characters? lmao
---
yesterday i saw what i'm almost positive was a bot just walking back and forth in varrock center. i watched him for a while trying to figure out what he was doing but he didn't stop just walking back and forth through the fountain.
---
Exactly. I only have 106 subscribers.
---
oh my god
---
Scabaras is the one task I wont ever do. I hate it
---
NEVER!
---
clearly made all that money selling leather bodies
---
But you can also type that... we do it as a joke in our cc sometimes
---
F2p wars are more organized.
---
Goes further back than that, I remember it getting spammed in twitch chat during LCS in like season 2 or something
---
Who cares
---
Yeah... no... We don't do black text on blue backgrounds around here
---
Wrong. The earth is 2019 years old. How can you be so dumb?
---
My man there are people who play video games that don't even know what steam is or even own a computer. Ask random people your age that play video games what runescape is and they'll either say they have no idea what the fuck your talking about or "oh i think i remember that one game some nerds liked to play when I was 10".
---
Born too late to explore the world. Born too early to explore the stars. Born at the right time to explore the flax fields.
---
I feel like this is only a west side meme oddly enough. I used to be a flithy easterner and never saw this, but i see it all the on west side.
---
Ohhhhhhhhh thanks im an egghead
---
Yar it does
---
0/10 not yellow text black background
---
Yikes imagine being this easily triggered
---
Same reason someone would grind a boss for 32 hours. They think it's fun.
---
Sadly he already got his account cleaned and was intensively raped this morning.
---
Ok zoomer
---
Check out the sarachnis cudgel if you can afford it. Even better crush alternative than dragon hasta
---
Damn i was in rsd too from like 2010-eoc what was your rsn?
---
I am not even level 20 in all skills so I dont really have a clear image about that and thus a not objective opinion
---
Yeah it depends on what you want to do in the league. If you want to get points, the XP relic is the best by far.
---
Gamers be like “how come greedy companies won’t pay their developers” then be libertarian smh
---
Stop it get some help
---
&gt; play video games 
---
&gt; Don't know what steam is
---
Yeh that would be console players under the age of 13. Seriously you think people at all into gaming don't know the most popular platform for said gaming?
---
Rs is by no means a massive game like something like Fortnite or League of Legends. But to call it niche is hilariously out of the question.
---
+1 for no bullshit wildy bosses
---
For the solo speedruns yeah, but otherwise Wisdom will be fine. I'd probably rather avoid any group raids demanding people that went Focus anyway, probably get the boot the moment you make a mistake
---
Rargh and links pvp challenges &gt; anyone elses
---
Somethin came in the mail today
---
/r/ironscape's official HC CC is the same way. The second I joined I saw the mods masskicking people for making dick jokes. So I said something along the lines of "The mods here are the true small penis locked ironmen". I got instakicked and never came back.
---
250? Wasn't it 1000?
---
and some are pray you don't get hit 2 50s type bs mechanic
---
Thank you for the detailed response :)
---
Thank you!
---
220 fire giants and 70 shayzien crypt zombies and still no rune scim, I wish I could talk to Oziach my luck is fucked
---
took my runelite about 5 minutes to load about this time. guess it was runescape wide. seems to be working fine now though idk
---
That's so ironic considering Zombies mode was released on CoD Mobile today
---
Im just an outsider but you guys left first in a "war" doesnt that mean you guys lost?
---
In twisted league you get 200m almost in the same time that you spend on 99 in the main game.
---
How about an instance were you are thrown into each god wars boss room. After you kill the boss you immediately get teleported to the next boss. At the end you are teleported to a chest and in the chest is a chance at a drop from 1 or more of the bosses. 
---
You'll be able to join lobbies to have friends join or something.
---
Yeah wtf I can't believe people are actually defending upper management capital investors. They are not good for anyone, their incentivized to make profit at all cost regardless of quality of product or quality of life for lesser employees. They literally don't give a shit if RuneScape is a fun game or if their devs are happy, they literally just care that their profits go up. When you're only goal is profit you will sacrifice so much in pursuit of that goal. You can say 'thats just the way the world is' but then the world is fucked and if no one stands up it will never change.
---
More
---
Official client is still janky. Good thing I have homework today :/
---
Would wildy bosses drop dragon pickaxes? Would be nice for HCIM.
---
This reminds me of an old flash game, it was blacked out like this, point and click puzzle game similar to Abes Odyssey, but messing up would often kill your character in pretty gruesome ways. Had a lot of crows and scarecrows etc. I remember part of the puzzle being clicking on a bird, the bird would fly off and pick up a rock, and then you click the bird again to make it drop it and you have to time it right to activate the next step. Anyone know the name? There was a 1, 2, maybe a 3. On Kongregate I'm sure
---
No worries
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Fuck, now I want to play again.
---
You're right, it tooks me 30 hours
---
6 foot 5 inches
---
This is what having too much free time looks like
---
I'm getting this error:
---
"There was an error loading the game configuration from the website.If you have a firewall, check that this program is allowed access the Internet"
---
There have always been things like that though. Sire, Kraken, Cerb, Thermy. This is just another way of achieving the same effect.
---
IMO the right way to think about basilisks is that the unique is locked behind a Slayer task, but there's a small bonus chance you could get it off-task.
---
Rot bitch
---
I feel like a lot of players don't remember the old days of clan wars and HONOR pking. Could you post a link to your clans page? I'm very interested in this. I was active in the original rs2 war scene and would love to get back into that part of the community. I didn't know wars like this still happened!
---
Yes.
---
It will be a while.
---
Summary: 
---
"Mage pray mage pray mage pray mole spawn mole spawn mole spawn veng up veng up veng up"

this is against integrity rules.
---
Would look like heron
---
having the same issues. my runelite wont even work for me.
---
No release date yet. The only news we have so far is that the helmet will be blue
---
Free membership
---
It's a rental, 100k gp/h
---
The environment in HD looks nice but not the animations. Or how they changed what gear looked like.
---
On PC. Experiencing same thing since last night
---
If more clans went out the wild wouldn’t be dead. 
---
Money in this game is so easy to come across. It’s unfortunate more people aren’t into a strategic style of gameplay. Instead people wanna just kill a boss 10k times like a machine
---
You have disgraced the Ironman ways
---
No I didn’t know, I thought the illuminati would kill me irlif I didn’t use a cannon...come on dude. Dont take shit so literally.
---
Rip RNG
---
It literally has a reward shop. It is instanced. It plays best with other people (or rather is sometimes impossible without others). All I'm seeing here is things that correspond to minigame, not skills. Also the rewards are untradeable. While it happens to be a skill, it feels and looks and plays and exists entirely as a minigame - just with xp and levels + the points you get for the rewards shop.
---
I thought the post was funny my man take it easy.
---
You posted this comment 4 hours after op replied “no” lmfaoo what
---
We have been seeing issues with the Jagex servers for the last ~15 hours where they will sometimes not accept connections for http requests. It seems sporadic and if you retry it works eventually.
---
Desktop client is not working for me.  Mobile is working.  RS3 is loading.  I have cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the game, checked with my ISP and, turned off my firewall, reset my router, and reset my modem with no success.
---
They could also struggle with spammers. Then this guy no one knows starts talking about Viagra for no reason -&gt; bro wtf *kick*
---
Was probably killed mid script and got lost
---
You can easily add lore that a powerful mage has summoned all these bosses to protect his treasure room
---
I'm just speculating like everyone else, but it doesn't have to be that easy. For example, it's possible that the engine has no way of knowing if you're on a twisted world or not. If that's the case, the question becomes, should it know about your world type? I could imagine that they don't want to architect the engine in a way where it's aware of game mode types, which would mean they have to design another way that fits more with their overall engine architecture.
---
Besides the coding part of it, like any idea, they'd need to get together and decide on what they want exactly. Maybe there's some issue that we haven't thought about that they will have to consider. Then someone has to design this too and it has to be approved. 
---
 All of this of course would take quite a bit of time and maybe it's not really worth it. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's super easy and quick. 
---
At work we often get clients asking for "small changes" and it's really not always simple as they think it is. Of course it's easy to look at it from a distance and say "well, you should have designed your system better if that's so hard", but that's such easy talk for a complicated problem.
---
wut
---
Not just you. Seems like an issue on jagex side that's affecting a lot of people.
---
Quest man good
---
&gt; I can't believe people are actually defending upper management capital investors
---
Their business practices can be fucked, but this statement:
---
&gt;They are not good for anyone
---
is just straight idiotic. You can't start a company without a huge amount of capital. If you quit your job to found a start-up, that start-up is going absolutely no where if you can't fund the company. Investors give businesses the capital they need to actually get off the ground.
---
Not to mention this line: 
---
&gt;upper management capital investors
---
is meaningless word soup. Investors are not upper management, those are two completely different groups.
---
300 at 2 AM lol, let's try that at even 9am or 10pm and it's 600+. My whole point is there's a reason the main game has so many worlds. Once you get past the initial stages of the game, there's x amount of stuff to do. When you take the amount you can do, 3rd it and then only have 18 worlds. It makes all of the training spots terrible. It's not too bad in the main game, because of the large selection of things and worlds. People will truly understand in a week or so, when everyone is doing slayer and crashing people.
---
There aren't though, pretty sure this is twisted league. There are things with lower drop rate and single combat available in the league but nothing better than fire giants.
---
Nope
---
I'd argue with the way people play now to be efficient, dungeoneering would never be played (as a minigame) without good rewards. Basically people don't do content if it's not good money or doesn't give BiS items. If polled as a skill and not a minigame, max players wouldn't want it. It doesn't fit in osrs as it is a 120 skill. As a skill it's just a poor idea. As a minigame, cut down in size and factor by probably 80% then maybe it would be ok. The devs don't have the time to remake dungeoneering as it was a huge undertaking with all new assets. It also made use of summoning and other features not in osrs.
---
It just isn't a proper fit with old school, too much dev work would be put in prior to polling - see warding, artisan, sailing, just to fail the poll. OR in the low chance that it passes - the rewards will be contested and we will end up with rev caves all over again with a bunch of alchables and supplies further killing the skilling item market.
---
You have to ask yourself - what would dungeoneering ADD to the game - especially without rewards in consideration? Well for me the answer is a minigame (because it wouldn't pass as a skill), and as we know most minigames are barely played - the ones that are still somewhat active are those with BiS and Diary rewards (PC and BA).
---
Nah, there are tons of teleports, you can use energy pots or get high agility to keep up. Besides, running around all the time isn't something you do so much.
---
I'm just a walker, but it's really not a big deal. There are a few places where it can make a big difference, but that's true for all the relics.

There's a trick where you can lure a spider and literally camp forever.

You can still put an offensive name. After a certain amount of forced name changes though, a j mod will come up with a username and force it to be yours. That’s what happened to me lol, hope it was god ash who named me.

So everyone complains about NMZ then we upvote this?

I mean there are a million things. Maybe they are in school with extra free time. Maybe they are rich and completely carefree. Maybe they don't have a social life. Who cares.

Draynor is multicombat, which is the main reason for that ciry.

You mentioned only a few skill. It's supposed to be a grind. When everything is oversaturated, you can't even begin to start that grind.

You can use blast furnace for pure strength hp without health hp. Also quests.

Lmao

Cannot wait for your group iron-man videos

Never heard of ot happening. If you are set up on the auth there shouldn't be any problems.. "Shouldn't"

Same thing here, been trying everything for hours and im super frustrated at this point. Last night before 8 or 9 pm it was working perfectly, since then it won't connect to jagex servers. I was able to use runelite only ONE time and got a few hours in before bed and when I woke up and woke up my PC from sleep mode it doesn't want to launch either. 
---
I've flushed DNS, i've tried to the compatibility/set as administrator, I've tried going into my windows and router firewalls and the ports all there. I don't know what to do and the runescape forums are totally useless, most of the posts from googling are either deleted or a jmod locks the thread after a few days, which is completely stupid and defeats the purpose of online forums. 
---
I can only play via mobile but I have big hands and it just won't work well for me.
---
You're trolling?
---
yea, "shouldn't". because i did set one up. did click the button to remember my device for 30 days tho, so i actually only used it once. but i don't know if that matters

Its not the longest

Juicy details please

2 comments here are hidden, so I'm curious. Can you PM the info or whether or not this is a joke? :p
---
The whole cave
---
Great point. That basically sums up your side of the argument. What a waste of space.
---
Should get that engine light checked out
---
Dunno what this is about I just came here to say FUCK ROT. Why haven't every single member of that clan been banned yet for being cheating scumbags? Surprised they didn't somehow ddos everyone and manage to win. That's totally their MO.
---
This game lets you practice resource and time management, while planning contingency for market risks, and zone crowding.
---
You can build plans around anywhere from a few hours, to setting long term goals well over a year.
---
Detail orientated builds which require research and precise execution, else risk 11hp or 2def. Similarly assessing the cost benefit analysis of foregoing unlocks to limit CB, and similar paradigms.
---
Constantly calculating and referencing wiki develops research skills indifferent to most other applications.
---
Ah you too are a person of culture and enjoy the finer things in life I see

Imagine claiming you know what the design is.

To be fair, that entire sub is boring.

Slap a Brazzers logo on and you’re good to go

Why do iron men call bosses completed when they have half the drops. Shit is so dumb
---
Like people that comment "Nice" in comment chains. Knowing they lead others to a path they cannot follow.
---
1.2m/hr isn’t really worth the time lol?
---
take it to the op, i don't get paid enough
---
That's what amazes me so much about this man. Last weekend he did a first ever solo raid on TL with terrible gear, and got 40k(?) viewers. One of the most viewed streams at the time.
---
And then he just goes back to work the next day. I love it

Lol I do not.

Maybe something other than the existing uniques. If the drop rate is too good, the uniques will crash hard killing normal bossing instantly. If the drop rate is however too bad, nobody will do this.

I don't know of the process but there is an actual link through the website somewhere, it worked for me in the past

Just because you use runelite doesn’t mean everyone has to bud

Thanks for the advice everyone going to do a few quick buyables and finish it of with 90 base! Lets see if i can manage before 2020.

You need the boots of stone for that no? Requires 44 slayer, lots of people want a scimmy before starting slayer.

---
&gt; Are there any dev companies run like an LLC?
---
Good question, but I want to address the idea of LLCs first. LLCs are extremely flexible business structures. A lot of start-ups are initially founded as LLCs now days. Structuring as an LLC doesn't mean every employee has a stake, it's just easier to get to that structure under the framework of an LLC. 
---
As for whether any dev companies are structured to give all their employees a stake, I'm not sure, though I would guess not. Giving all employees an equal voice (or a strong voice at all) is pretty controversial. The commonly used example is:
---
Imagine you have a company with 100 employees. The company realizes it can pivot to a new automated system that would allow it to mass-produce its highly sought-after product at an extremely low price to consumers; but, doing so would mean cutting 55 of the 100 jobs. The employees vote it down. Now 55 people have prevented the rest of the public mass access to this highly sought-after product. Is that good for those 55 people? Absolutely. Is it good for the public at large? No.
---
Now in reality the issues aren't going to be so extreme or black-and-white, but it's a useful illustration to show that employee interests aren't always in line with the interests of the public.
---
Upvote for visibility. I had no idea this happened.

I hate that so much. Maybe I was fortunate enough to have received praise as a kid and some people didn't get Enough of it, but I hate it when people announce meaningless "achievements" like 51 fishing or fucking beginner clue from fishing. Fuck me, do you want people to congratulate you on 50 gp.
---
Rs3's mining and smithing rework is s good update dont @ me
---
Buying gray bonds
---
I would be happy if Smithing was consistently useful for making your own gear.
---
Hm, yeah that makes sense why they do this. Might be the case, poor sods.
---
I dunno man, this one feels kinda avant-garde. I'm digging it
---
Writing the mechanics for the boss? Most likely not. But this isn't just writing boss mechanics.
---
In software engineering, there are well defined flaws that appear in rotten code. One of these is immobility. In software design this means that code that should be easily reusable isn't. When this flaw is present in your code base it is sometimes easier to just rewrite the functionality for your specific need.
---
OSRS is an old game and we already know the codebase is rotten. This feature very easily could be hard to implement.
---
It’s not bannable. As long as you 1) use it ONLY for a 1:1 key rebind (which jamflex said was okay) and 2) use native windows programs for the mouse movement (sticky keys and ease of access) then you will be fine.

There's literally no reason whatsoever to even consider a Mac

Yea it just costs 1k per hit to use rather than 150gp like twisted bow with dragon arrows.

You literally traded them to him? What was the expected outcome?
---
Time to test it out!
---
nice one homie
---
Look at these comments.. all of the clans are just claiming they won. So in other words no one did.
---
I will leave this offer here for now. If I finish the quest or receive an offer through the game itself I will let you know
---
Galvek is actually relatively easy as long as you can avoid the damage and get good RNG. But Seren, the damage is unavoidable and you literally have to rely on nothing but the RNG gods to get through it.
---
tbf his health would be low af already. Just chuck a ball at him, ez catch.
---
You lost me at ‘still a student’. Speak on these matters when you’ve actually worked in development.
---
But until then, keep in mind that the MAJORITY of dev time isn’t even for coding.
---
I think it has something to do with the massive amount of items being dropped in that area.
---
Oh shit, you DA zookeeper 🤣🤣🤣
---
Don’t act tuff here, you and beast planked plenty to me and benz
---
Road to being muted
---
It could  simply be too many objects in that area due to people dropping large amount of objects from the fruit stall while theiving. You will notice the same thing if you try this at the barbarian fishing area for example.
---
Thought I was the only one, joined the CC and made a joke about the child’s dookie blanket you have to pick up for a quest and offended a few people.
---
Ill tell u the rng gods were not on my side for galvek. Guy cost me millions. Seren was do e on my second try when i decided to just switching to sara brews and trident damage
---
He's using it uncharged, it's still better than Rapier for a few tasks uncharged but I'm not sure if Gargs are one of those tasks.
---
I think we all just want dungeoneering.

Rewards caps at level 60, reward amount caps at 99. However you the gp difference is so small that theres no point in waiting after 60
---
~15 hours? More like the past 15 years
---
&gt;PvP in OSRS also has a far higher mechanic skillcap than PvP in any iteration of WoW
---
so we can assume you have at least 1 rank 1 mount? which season?
---
Not really sure what I just watched. A bunch of unbalanced trades for the purpose of...?
---
Go for melee bro, take swordies with u and u probably will be fine,
---
GL!
---
You don't need every teleport unlocked for them to fly lol. Construction cape is the same as having house teles, which are barely a cost. Fairy rings are nice but only speeds it up by 20-30 seconds? Depending on where you teleport. 166k for all med stashes built.
---
I wish it was 6 hours. 120 is the same as getting 99 eight times over.

Wt to 200m fm with the artisan and double xp relics, then use gp from wt to turn oak logs into planks.

If your with a 4 man split squad with on par drops, no, COX is better. But, if your solo, i believe vork is better with bis vork gear.

Oh lmao!

Never get high on your own supply.

yesterday i ran in circles at an agility course for 5 hours straight
---
It's a Phoenix. It'll come back.
---
One fewer purple sweet and he'd have some normy number
---
the amount of money you make @ cox is VERY dependent both on being on rate for dex scrolls and tbows, and your overall efficiency.
---
one raider might avg around 35-45k points an hour including downtime between raids and avg split loot, one raider might avg 85-95k an hour doing efficient solos. 
---
for both pvm and skilling wiki tends to list more "medium effort rates", rather than absolute max eff.
---
Who are you to judge what somebody else considers fun? Lmao he can do whatever the fuck he wants
---
Gzzzzzz
---
Is it fun though? It doesn't sound fun to me and it doesn't sound like a lot of them are doing it for fun either.
---
You could probably make a runelite plugin for it, I wouldn't see why not, but I don't know if anything for it currently exists and like the other guy said the warning it gives is pretty good already.
---
It did and then it died again, clearly

I’d be a gnome flying a glider.
---
cerb is definitely not good outside of uniques
---
Your stats are perfectly fine for the Elvarg fight. Bring a strength potion and lobsters or better, be sure to equip your anti dragon shield,  try not to let your hp drop below 15ish and hurray smack that dumb lizard. If you want you could also bring runes for an emergency teleport, since you can't leave the boss room until three fight is over normally. Also if you have any prayer, may as well turn it on for the small bonuses. About all I can think of, it's been a while since I last did that quest.
---
I have no idea I'm sorry I gave up on windows a while ago.
---
Literally had no idea I had ever got a pet until I checked my collection log

I'm a librarian (while I'm a student), so I'd probably set up in the Varrock library with all the adventurers coming through for their quests.

Or if I'm lucky, somehow land a job at the Prif library

Y?
---
whats your combat level?
---
If you can’t afford $11 I would reassess your priorities.

If you’re unemployed and can’t afford to spend $11, then maybe you shouldn’t restart the RS addiction...

---
Wilma cock fit in your mouth
---
Lunar diplo
---
Well, in my country $11 isn't nothing, so even if employed, spending that much on a game would be ridiculous.
---
Yeah but that refers more to company plans, strategy, customer base, etc. NDA covers facts about the business that could put it in legal trouble (i.e. whistleblowing and theirs a very strict rules around this), give it's competitors an advantage or cause unrest.
---
UK law prevents a company from NDAing certain aspects of someone's role too. For example, MMK would be allowed to disclose his salary as it allows him to compete in the market. He'd 100% be allowed to share his opinion on his own salary too. He probably wouldn't be allowed to share if he was given any money to leave (gardening leave,  redundancy, etc.). Probably wouldn't be allowed to say if it was redundancy or not too as that his various implications.
---
I've been NDA'd multiple times (including my current role) in a few different industries, and for both joining a company for my day-to-day, and on leaving a company.
---
Thanks, but didn't work for me

At the risk of sounding like a white knight, you're wrong.

There is a clan chat for Shield of Arrav and the quest following it, also there is usually a guy who is almost always helping people out, you can tip them after you finish the quest if you feel like it, i gave him 200k since i am not filthy rich so feel free to tio him whatever i think is worth the help

---
this is too high quality, please ban
---
Log your osrs account and make an account on rs3. Trade the money from you rs3 main to your rs3 noob (osrs main). Buy a bond on the rs3 noob (osrs main). Redeem the bonds for members. Now your osrs main is member.

If you're looting and being attacked you could get out with a few more brews or restores you otherwise would, which could mean the difference between life and death

Black text, blue background? The jury will decide your fate.
---
No, but for real this just sounds like a better version of NMZ. I don't think that's an inherently bad suggestion, but I don't think I like the sound of using proper bosses for this purpose. Quest bosses are nice since they were single purpose; just beef up their stats to semi-tob level and give them all a multi attack or something.
---
Because botting isn't illegal.. lol
---
And her follower count just jumped
---
I watched a video, I feel saddened but that also is an inventory at a time if you are banking so not super effective. Thanks for notifying me though I did try it for a few.

yeah but as you guys post pics and say rot and sv cleared, they post pics of you and jaja and dk cleared.

---
4:20 downtime and very good rng on olm
---
As you can see he has 1.7m total xp so probably nothing crazy high yet.
---
Could you not pre-link accounts as an effort to stop a black market from forming? Say "Iron Blorb" wants the rewards on their main "Blorb", so before the League starts they go through a linking system (requiring entering both logins, maybe?) so points are sent to Blorb instead of Iron Blorb?
---
Well 2 lucky people 6.5m, thanks for the turnout
---
Yeah bro I can barely ever complete a while master clue 😂
---
maybe it is guaranteed at 200m xp?
---
She’s wearing an off the shoulder top 🙄
---
I won't call a boss rush mode anything but boss rush
---
Boss rush mode with no rewards seems cool (with rewards makes it mandatory)
---
I will say though any content thats in multicombat is group content
---
Just because SOME OF yall some bitches playing EFFICIENCYSCAPE and not RUNESCAPE doesn't mean the content isn't there.
---
Get in line luv
---
Depends on the girth
---
Just FYI videos and photos are evidence of anything in the eyes of Jagex due to how easily they can be faked. That being said contact your ISP and tell them what’s going on and they’ll come and change your IP address or help you do it. But if you’re legitimately hoping that your discord screenshots carry weight and that Jagex will/should take action based on that evidence you’re going to be disappointed.
---
Not being rude, just curious, why the big appeal for twisted league? I haven't really read the blog or anything but I hear the mode will disappear in January? Why go the lengths to do all of the things people are doing? Are there rewards for main account? Again, just curious. Thanks.
---
That's what it takes!

Ranger boots clue 1980.. u know runelite takes screen shots right lol
---
well the net isn't the problem (you can catch imps with butterfly nets) the problem is you don't have the jars to put them in so that's why you can only barehand them.
---
Just a few more boots then maybe
---
Omg those earrings are awesome

How is F2P so dead? Did they actually get rid of the bots?

Oziach my balls

No, those are all bots and the truth is there is only about 17 f2p players in the world
---
They gave you a good example of public interest not aligning with worker’s to disprove your statement that public interest always aligns with worker’s interest. Maybe next time, instead of deep diving into a rant, start off with “This is a good example and disproves my earlier point. However, ...”.
