Well he managed to do a lot of other stuff in his 4 minutes of free time
---
See you on the front page you monster
---
Hmm that’s strange, I’m around the same stats and my kills take around 2/2:30 mins. Do you double spec vorkath or spec once per kill? 
---
The leprechaun should also store your gold coins since it's well... a leprechaun

Considering i still play RS3 from time to time
---
Nice assumption
---
Have you ever heard the tragedy of falador's masacare?
---
You like being bombarded by irrelevant and sometimes spoiler filled ads on a wiki that sometimes contains wrong information?
---
my mans
---
I try to double spec. Sadly vorkath likes to fireball me when I try to double spec lol. Are you using addy darts as well or DPSing during acid 
---
No, you still keep your +3, you just can't use the protect item prayer. I can't really speak to whether higher total level worlds pkers are better geared, my guess is probably.
---
Now that we know how it works I think the only problem is calling it a mimic. Having to enter the chests pocket dimension is a cool as fuck solution to the design problem and very runescapey too
---
amazin
---
Congrats man! I’ve been hesitant snd scared to do it on my own even though I have very high combat skills haha. First time jitters I guess. 
---
Honestly who cares if he rwt’d a couple bows, more power to him. He still has a sick account and I would do the same thing in his position. 
---
Saying 'it could' is far from a promise. It just means, it could
---
Yep like any business they'd have to justify the investment into the upgrade. The real thing also is that the engine is bloody ancient, and finding an experienced person to work on it is hard, and/or costs a fortune. 
---
I know where I’m pking tonight 
---
Yeah but by the same logic it could never happen and you could save no money. It works out statistically to cost you 33% less than if you used a gilded altar (if we use a base of 50% chance to not consume the bone)
---
Not that lucky. I’m sure there’s a billion merch offers in the ge all the time to try and get a few mil off high ticket items. I’d say getting 118 is unlucky. 
---
Hmmm, the real question is, should we trust just some nerdy dude?
---
I'm pretty happy in my sysadmin job, lol. Just been playing for longer than you've probably been alive. 
---
If you want an easy game with modern UI design maybe don't play a legacy version of an 18 year old MMO, retard. 
---
Ah you’re a legend
---
😎
---
Oh shit.
---
I wouldn’t.
---
and dont say god dhide that shits ugly
---
YEET
---
I’m not sure, It also could’ve been a timing thing 
---
it's owned by wikia
---
TRUE
---
Addy darts and I just walk around during acid. I think rune darts are probably a bit wasteful so if kill times are consistently long either train up ranged a bit or try get prayer up and invest in rigour if you have enough. I don’t think woox walking has a massive impact on kill times so don’t worry about trying it if it takes too much of your food when it goes wrong.
---
I can attest to this completely. I’m in college and didn’t play at all during summer or winter breaks because I usually always had something better to do. Now that I’m back in class, I resort to RS for my daily dopamine/serotonin fix, or mainly because I really don’t feel like doing work and RS provides me with the enjoyment I need.

Just secure your account though

The regular attack’s he does? I feel like I’m constantly getting 15-20’s from the mage attacks and range is hitting almost 30

Ikr, it’s just reddit guys, we’re all here to share fun stuff and have a good time. I hate when there’s so much negativity for no reason :(
---
Finally
---
I get the salt at how little Jagex pays but “just hire more people” is such a lazy response even if it was possible, it’s so much deeper than just needing more devs
---
The vast majority of this game comes from mid 2000s era engine code that the current dev team inherited and had no part in designing, not to mention that broad engine work on a game that’s as expansive as OSRS, constantly live, and so outdated at the ground level would require an insane amount of time and effort invested just for the possibility to then spend more time and effort correcting small QoL stuff like this. Hiring a team of devs to go down that path who then have even less familiarity with the code and have to be let go after finishing the engine work would make absolutely no sense for any company...Why do you think WoW has only rarely done any engine work? Almost no MMORPG’s, and very few games in general, will rebuild their entire engine unless they’re launching a massive expansion or an entirely new game (like they did for RS3). It’s just not worth it for the payoff in most cases
---
Thanks I appreciate the links. After watching that and rewatching his first video where he says he paused the recorder it does seem unlikely that it's a joke. I'm sure dying was very embarrassing but lying is clearly not the way to go as it puts all past and future actions into extra scrutiny. 
---
Double it again and... it's gone
---
But god d'hide is the only upgrade you can afford with 7m cash atm.  You'll get +2 prayer bonus from it.
---
Why are you taking damage from the mage attacks? With mage prayer and super antifire it should only be the ranged attack that does significant damage (flames occasionally hit but not very often at all)
---
Not sure lad
---
One of my favorite tracks in the game. Great rendition!

&gt; I get the salt at how little Jagex pays but “just hire more people” is such a lazy response even if it was possible, it’s so much deeper than just needing more devs
---
Except it's really not. They have a lack of Java developers. Right now, they have 2 or 3 I believe? That's not enough for two games - OldSchool RuneScape and RuneScape 3 are absolutely massive games at that.
---
I apologised in my letter. I did something wrong clearly “so what did you use?” That’s what I need to discuss with a mod.
---
It was a different client and that’s what I think they detected because if there’s a way they can check my gameplay they will see I didn’t have a script or whatever.
---
So I’m just putting it out here I apologised for using it cause it clearly mercd me, and gave evidence to show I’m constantly grinding.
---
Yh that’s it really oh and that I want my account back and I’m willing to pay.

I don’t wanna talk about it. Let’s just say party hats aren’t worth was they used to be

They exist but you can only get them in the aftermarket because the seller sold out. Come join the RuneScape Pin grade exchange  Facebook group I’m sure someone would sell you a pair 😁

so improving the osrs style slightly and adding more detail is bad?

I agree that it sounds that way, but I thought because there is a 50% chance that you save a bone, there is a chance that someone would think that he meant you only get 50% more bones out of what you buy. I figured it couldn't hurt to clarify.

Gonna ask you and the other fella, I kinda wanna grind for a bond in a member's world because it's more efficient to make money there. Where should I go to make the 4 mil the fastest, cuz I wanna optimize my time as a member. Right now I've been safespotting Ogress Warriors at Corsair Cove, and it makes decent-enough money, especially with the rune drops, but is there another monster that I don't even know exists cuz honestly in all my ten years of playing RS I've never actually bought a membership, but I've gotten this far in OS so I figured now might be the time.

Yo you think those obsidian dudes bang each other constantly?

I personally just do a fruit tree run and it’s pretty cheap. Made lvl 70 farming today without much effort or coins. I just use this run once a day. Currently only using papaya trees gives about 30k xp a run/day.

1. I go Camelot/Catherby fishing spot fruit tree patch. 
---
2. Then go to the docks sail to brimhaven fruit tree patch.
---
3. Use my crystal seed Tele to elves fruit spot if you have Rolving Elves quest done.
---
4. Then Tele to Varrock use spirit tree to go to gnome strong hold fruit tree
---
5, use spirit tree again go to tree gnome village. Then walk through the fence have the gnome take you to the beginning of the maze to the last fruit tree spot.

*Looks at other thread where they literally DDOS'd the person's home internet to disconnect them, logged in using their username and password they obtained through phishing, then pillaged their account for 100mill in less than 5 mins because they didn't have a PIN or authenticator and apparently were dumb as shit about clicking links*
---
It only happens if enough information about your account has been leaked for someone to make a successful recovery, which is usually through the user's own fault (or the person bought their account, but that's another thing.) But that being said, this kind of thing happens when people made their account when they were 12 in 2006, most children aren't that conscious of internet security.
---
There should at least be a way for someone to replace recovery information with something else if they created their account when they were very young, or if they have reason to believe that some of the information is compromised. Right now the only way to invalidate compromised recovery details is to *actually* get hacked through recovery and then recover your account back yourself, which is kinda shitty when we could just have the opportunity to manually invalidate compromised details before any hijacking happens.
---
If you created your account more recently, at a point in your life where you were much more security-conscious online, then you don't really have to worry about someone being able to make a fraudulent recovery on your account, and 2FA on account + email really is all you need.
---
&amp;#x200B;

(For sure, things like Jed happen, but I wouldn't worry about that because Jagex do take responsibility for it if it happens, and you will get your stuff returned, sooner or later. Though I couldn't blame someone for quitting or losing trust in Jagex entirely if something like this happened to them.)
---
Rs3 no longer runs off of Java. Only OSRS uses Java and it's a proprietary version of Java called Runescript

holy fuq its so accurate

Something is most likely clearing whatever cached files left by osrs mobile, whether that's osrs itself I don't know but wherever the cached files are you may be able to set them as read-only if your iPhone is jailbroke or android is rooted.

He who wishes greatness of all beings, the one betrayed by those seeking power over unity. He who would do all he could to lift up those broken and lost and show them the way to become greater in one self and with the world. The one who would see a world at peace, not one scorched by the greed of others or the lust for chaos. The one who would finally give us peace, taken from us before we were mere children.

Is there a way to make Runelite smaller? I play on a 15" laptop (macbook) and Runelite takes up about half the screen, even when compressed as small as possible. I'd love to just make everything smaller (the interface and actual gameplay) so I can multibox on a small screen.
---
Any thoughts?
---
Once I realised it was the inside of a chest, I thought it was awesome. Before I was a bit confused though
---
You get that if you wear a combat bracelet.
---
If you get double blowpipes every kill that's 8.2m per kill. Record time I could find is 34s. That means you can get 105 kills per hour, not counting any banking or respawning zulrah.  That's a theoretical 868m per hour. 
---
Arent mimics supposed to trick the player into thinking it’s the real thing? How would a mimic go from a normal sized casket to a huge octopus monster. And why would a casket mimic be inside of an extremely large casket full of coins?

Check the money making guide on the wiki for some ideas. At your levels there's not much in combat that's great, but grinding out some money by tanning dragonhide or making cannonballs might be good. It will be a chore at your levels though

The stark contrast between RS3 and OSRS mimic boss is telling. In RS3 it is genuinely a lootbox boss but in osrs its a clue casket boss
---
Wtf this whole thread is genius 😂
---
Elaborate 
---
2010-2011 would have been a nice middleground. But then curses and overloads would have been in the game, and who actually wants 95 Prayer + 96 Herblore as hard requirements for PvMing?
---
So mid 2009 in that case. This would be after SC and SW (+ Fist of Guthix), but before curses and overloads. Though there would still be Summoning, and before Summoning, those minigames didn't exist.
---
So... let this be a testament to the old saying, "you can never please everyone."

Anyone see his clip where he explains it and cussed someone out on his stream? He showed no emotions and went way too detailed about it. Def lying. "Invalid credentials" ?? Wut ?

Come join the CC: Vox Magna, and they can explain the reqs there :) 
---
I think if it was a normal mob you could cheese with your clue hunting gear, then yeah this would make sense. As a boss though, having people gear up each time for the chance of it, I don't think that would fly.
---
Firelighters obviously
---
Why a 8/127? Why not lower that down?
---
I know I should use the official wiki but man the other is so much easier to use for so many things. I've noticed the official is improving though so hopefully that trend continues 
---
LOL
---
Can we see a continuation of the Zarosian quest lines?
---
In RS3 the quest line eventually leads to the death of Guthix but it would be very entertaining to see a world where Sliske is foiled and the world story becomes dominated by the lesser pantheons and demigods of RS (Karamja, desert, Zeah). Such expansion could lead to new content in old areas like barrows and Karamja while further defining the unique nature of the OSRS time-line. (Also Zeah is nice and all but its not the only story to be told...)
---
It got backlash on reddit so I think it was scrapped

Why don't I pay 25k to protect a 5k tree?

Why?

shhhhhhh, dont think about it and go grind
---
Staker, the friendlier way to tell people you gamble.
---
The "comical" opinion is honestly a bit ridiculous.  This game has never taken itself seriously at all.  Half of the quests consist of NPCs fucking with you and trolling you, and there are a lot of "self aware"/fourth-wall-break moments throughout the game.  
---
I mean, in the single most endgame quest in the entire game, you're assisted by a talking cat that Jagex memed on in the 2000s.  Like... come on.    
---
You can run to the chest in lumbridge basement instead. Or for 200iq use the chest on pvp worlds 
---
Set it up, complete the content, and then remove it if you're that sure you don't need it.
---
Crazy thought. That looks like the chest from that squeel of Fortune shit in rs3. 
---
What if the coins represent our $11 and the chest represents mtx? Unless we give jamflex more money the shadow of mtx gets larger. 
---
zaros does not forgive idolatry 
---
So your 5k tree doesn't die and you waste all that time it was growing. 
---
yes
---
No you don't lol.
---
Im in favor of tele-block being f2p as well, however Snare is needed as a 5 second bind is trash.

How does it make sense? Never knew the inside of a wooden chest was supposed to look cartoonish.

Over 2k total on main? Quest cape? I have 0 issues doing masters. You must have only scrolled far enough to see my iron levels. 
---
No, it shouldn't. The game isn't 2007scape anymore, it's Oldschool Runescape. The 2007 label has been gone for a very long time now and if it was still trying to be 2007 it wouldn't be anywhere near as popular as it is today. 
---
What is your problem exactly? The hardest part is the Galvek fight, but that is just about precise clicks and supply management. I can help you out if you tell me what your issues are.
---
First thing I did.. 
---
Why not? It lets people that flip items know if they've hit the limit or not does it not?
---
No 90 woodcutting among other things.
---
Interesting. I could get behind this if we made snare hold an opponent for 15 seconds and reduced entangle to 10 seconds, however the level requirement and rune costs will remain the same. 
---
You should write out where exactly you plan to do tree / fruit tree / herb runs and then map out your own routes. Personally back when I did tree runs I would try to avoid doing all 3 at the same time as you just don't have the inventory space. Figure out which teleports you need to go where and then map out your planned route - you can also bank halfway though if you need to. At low levels it can be very convenient to use a Clan Wars TP halfway through to recharge stamina and free up inventory space.
---
A very popular setup is to do an herb run or an herb + tree run and finish at the Catherby patch, then go to the bank immediately south to set up for a fruit tree run. There's a fruit tree patch in east Catherby and then a grapple shortcut that takes you to the Taverly tree patch.
---
So you're complaining for the sake of it? I honestly see your point here. Yes content shouldn't be behind something like this but at the same time look at it from their perspective. They want to protect your account, best way to do it is to lock semi-common and common content behind it.
---
"We are finally working on the bank rework, it IS coming."
---
Six months later: "Bank rework is too hard, we aren't doing it, thanks for buying more membership and bonds and keys tho"
---
Seems pretty shitty of them to me, some might even call it misleading, or just a flat out lie.
---
So did he have an account there to attack you instantly? If so what did you lose?
---
I just don’t have high PVM skill. I haven’t started the quest yet. I watched a lot of videos on it. I just probably won’t do it, or I’ll have a friend come over and do it eventually 
---
I'm not in that much of a rush to raise my farming level. So why would I quintuple my costs for nothing?
---
This unlocks so much content for my account 
---
Sounds like you were ratted lol. Reformat the PC.
---
I've been doing blast furnace for a bit actually. it's really good money but was wondering if something could have been better.

3 tbows, one for each phase.
---
Because I don't want to spent 25k to save &lt;1k. Quick maths
---
Thinking about pots from tree runs mostly
---
I'm guessing you don't flip items for your money
---
But it is their job to "comply" with "non gambling laws"
---
I could do that, what's the first boss i should worry about? i'm not too knowledgeable about the combat aspect of the game.

Aw it's not that hard really. The Dream fight is really easy, the Vorkath fight is even easier, and then Galvek might take you a few tries but you only pay 100k and your used supplies, you don't lose any items so you can try as much as you like. It might seem intimidating from the outside but it's really not that bad.

Or perhaps, having the culling go from 300 over 100 over an eight hour interval. So that way all regions would be affected. Aus, USA, and UK.

Guild Wars 1 sharing the same name as its sequel is a travesty. Everything about that fuckin' game dude, so god damn good. I logged back in for the first time in 8 years like 2 months ago and re-did a few of the campaigns with some of my friends, and it warmed my heart to see a handful of people online still.
---

Yea! It’s player base is pretty ok still! To do some end game stuff is a bit tricky as you have to find a niche guild for it but it’s not bad!

That would be awesome but you know they’d say they can’t add it because of too many new animations or something with all of the other gear

Good point. I guess I would give him credit for effort since hes one of the younger gods but the most powerful after Zaros', dude was just trying to stop what happened tonhis world happening again on Geilnor. His anti god wall at least kept the majority out but his own idea of not being present in the world for at least awhile bit him in the ass since worship of these gods continued and conspiracies to bring them back persevered until they succeeded. Some time spent explaining the folly of gods and why they shouldnt be followed may have convinced some mortals to abandon the pantheons and take an active roll in defending themselves, perhaps a much earlier emergence of the godless.

P.S.

The Grand Exchange is both a blessing and a burden. It's evident that trading pre-G.E was horrible, spending hours typing the same thing over and over and hoping for a trade is not a fun use of game time. At the same time, the G.E removes a small bit of player interaction and obviously makes certain elements of the game considerably easier. The deterrent of manual trading meant that players would collect skilling resources themselves or perhaps grind for PVM drops themselves. Personally, I'll never advocate for the removal of the G.E entirely as it passed a poll and has shaped the meta of the game for the past 4 years. On top of this, there's nothing forcing you to use the G.E. I enjoy collecting certain things myself and buying others, and that's how I'll continue to play (I'd start an Ironman if I had a spare 1500 hours to catch back up to my main account). It would just be nice if we weren't railroaded into one location to do all of our trading. Runescape can already be quite monotonous, anything that breaks this monotony is incredibly welcome in my eyes. If this were implemented without a graphical change to the bank booths, I'm sure it wouldn't consume too many hours of dev and QA time.

All you had to do was ask /u/Rendimento  at https://imgur.com/a/EVv5pua

Can’t say for sure as I haven’t tried it but I’m going to venture to most likely not. It has no reason to be if it is.

i have a 1750 total pure so not many people can hit me, but when im unskulled using craws bow i make like 3-4m /hr, I've heard from a cc that locks down the 2k worlds that skulled revs is 4-7m /hr with cc protection. You can probably have up to 6 max doing revs efficiently, anymore there would be diminishing returns. if everyone skulls thats around 24m- 32m/hr i believe? Also, someone made a video saying that the cc that locks down a 2k world charges 75m every 2 weeks to be able to use it.

Why is the chinchillas subreddit private lmao
---
Ikr? Dude says he likes to play alone, yet he has a good team and gets fed all the time. I guess its still not enough for him to even make it to 1v1s.
---
It's really hard to make a list because it changes considering what you're doing.
---
Say you're going for barrows runs, it's better to use high def armor. If you're going for NMZ, it's better to sacrifice some def and go obby set for more dps.
---
That said, on osrs.wiki training guides there's a section dedicated to best-in-slot gear for each slot. You can check were you're at and what would be the next step for an overall performance. Here's the link to melee: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pay-to-play_melee_training

Honestly I don't see why Jamflex can't just implement a simple ticket system for customer service. It's so dumb that people have to resort to being hopeful enough to be seen on Reddit and Twitter.

was it disappointing?

Well when you're buying something it's orange with the blank space. The blue bar tells you that you've hit limit.
---
There are better and more pleasing designs than this but the point was that there is no way of knowing if the reason your buy offer isn't being completed is because your offer is too low or if you've just hit the buy limit. 
---
This is a problem for everybody especially for people who frequently hit these limits.
---
I agree that a timer would be much better than a blue bar.
---
Blame other people; some people just like typing all their details into a phishing site or to another person, and 2FA *somewhat* helps prevent that
---
Dont downvote this one folks. Its what he wants. Just leave at 0 lol
---
Why not bonds 0.0.
---
Damn, too bad the IASIP reference is getting missed.
---
Dark souls didn't invent mimics
---
that's fine, the people who spam open chests don't bank their caskets and open them in 50+ wildy, which would make banking another option to check if its a mimic... yooo what happens when u get a mimic in wildy...?
---
Cerb is a task-only boss and is a huge prayer pot drainer, and pretty bad money unless you get primordials

Going 2k+ dry, specially on an ironman, is super painful. It's definitely a big deal.

Kinda funny and could be used as meme music. But from one strat player to another, please use a more transparent overdrive and let that puppy sing, give it some good articulation, remember Hendrix and frusciante and run, don’t chain it up like a lea Paul!

Thanks mate, always happy to!
---
Nice! Finally getting that first kc is the best feeling!
---
I don’t really mind how the game looks. They got to keep adding newer things like this to keep things fresh so I understand the concept. I think it’s a cool idea. 
---
It’s a great low-brain game to play.  Not a lot of thinking required a majority of the time. 
---
Is there anything else that could be a bigger deterrent than a double snake skin drop on your first zulrah kill? Good luck I hope that your next kills yield fruitful drops
---
I don’t get it
---
Hey so first of all,
---
Sorry this happened. We all make stupid mistakes and luckily this mistake won’t effect your reputation in real life lol. Shit happens, and my only advice is to consider private servers. A lot of people look down on them, but I have never been really talented at the grind of runescape like all of you maxed fellows so I played RSPSs on the side when I would get bored of OSRS. 
---
I am currently about to have my first account over level 100 in osrs after 12 years of on-and-off playing. Pretty abysmal, but! In private servers I have totaled over 600kc Jad, done inferno a couple times, 350kc Zulrah, I’m practicing raids in Chambers of Xeric with obtainable osrs gear. My point is, I have been able to work on end game content with little to no risk and ample amounts of practice with a little over 10 days on my account. It’s been fun and enjoyable and having a friend to do it with made it ever better. 
---
Whenever I get sick of pest control or motherload mining, I can go over to my maxed RSPS account and do raids with my friend. Quick note, in inferno you can skip right to the boss or do all of the waves. Jad you skip all of the waves. It’s great practice. Good luck buddy!
---
Apparently you haven't. That was available in the developer mode and he mentioned in a later episode that it had been removed.
---
U ok?
---
Thieving 
---
Yeah, because "Password123" is a lot more secure :p
---
You don't need upper-case characters for a strong password. Take the password "aqnpmc462w4ph7k3jqe5"; such a password is easy to use with RS, assuming you use a password manager to auto-type it anyway, and nobody is guessing or brute-forcing that.
---
a 1% chance to get max cash, hmmmmm
---
You can use EL wire.  They're pretty easy to put together with a lot of premade components available.
---
?
---
If you've done the Underground Pass quest, you could pretty easily do Barrows right now. It becomes much better money after you do the Morytania hard diary (which you're not far off of being able to do), but it's still pretty good without the extra runes
---
hermione?

It's relaxing and therapeutic for me, I love it. Playing Apex Legends induces a deep rage in me..
---

Lmao get good. 
---
Thank you :)
---
Request an account delete to Jagex; you don't have to worry about recovering that (they legitimate wipe the acc out; name and all)
---
Yeah but now that i have double the money idk if ill be so bored....
---
So is this a real person or what? What is the scam here do you think? 
---
I play osrs specifically because I stopped playing rs3 the day eoc came out

Meet Cookletics, my Lumbridge-locked ultimate ironman. After recently finding out I'd have to do Cook's Assistance to use the range, I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No Cook's Assistance, no Woodcutting, no Firemaking, but this time I can't learn to bake a cake. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescapes biggest challenges, getting 99 cooking within a castle fireplace.
---
you can hide it on mobile
---
Rs isn’t addicting btw 
---
Wait how did he get all that experience to unlock that spell?
---
its a rune and its the escape button lol
---
What's the full requirements to become an ourania runner? 
---
It's actually a fairly famous infinite series, 1/2+1/4+...1/2^n which equals to 1, but tbh I forget the proof since I haven't done maths in ages.
---
It's so gr8 no h8 m8
---
It could be done now with the inventory tags plugin, no updates needed
---
If I remember correctly range can hit 97. You’re supposed to pray range as his spawning and make sure sounds are on and if you hear the mage noise you switch to mage. If you start with mage pray and hear the range stomp it’s too late 
---
It's not useful if you're soloing it either because they meta method for it in solos is to just tickeat it, otherwise it still does too much damage for you to sustain through.
---
yo what youtube vid is this from again
---
If you need any and all general or specific pking advice you can pm me if you'd like (rsn raideniza)

If the email has 2FA as well as the account and you don't leak out your recovery info (account creation date, credit cards, transaction IDs, old passwords, internet provider, etc), then you're totally safe. 
---
You can only really get hacked if they either gain access to your email (weak/leaked password and no authenticator on email, or faulty recovery methods on email) or if they have enough info on the account to recover it (if you bought the account, or if you leaked a big amount of info). 
---
If neither of those happen, there's 0 chance of losing your account.
---
Pixel monk fans unite!!!!
---
Oh sorry. I've seen a lot of people struggling with fire cape lately so I figured I'd REPOST this e-z jad guide
---
Just look at your Youtube history lmao
---
Thanks! I'll add you tomorrow 
---
Excuse Guthix for having Saradomin invade his planet and eliminate his species for not wanting to fight after that. Guthix brought magic and rune stones to Gielinor. Imagine playing runescape without magic and rethink your god. 
---
If you find out let me know. I think it has to do with Java settings' interaction with the Retina display. I notice that my screenshots are 2x scaled as well.
---
Its a pretty big hotspot for pkers and you'd lose pretty much all your bones.
---
Shut up and take the money. 
---
I'm an awful multitasker, prayer flicks arent bad, but trying to lure the healers away was what made me fuck up and die. I eventually just got def up for karils and tanked them. No clue how 1 def pures do caves tbh 
---
maybe 15 accounts but no more than that
---
What about zuk, the shield needs to be drawn :) 
---
Ranarr weeds are their most prominent drop, followed by other herbs like avantoes, kwarms, dwarf weeds, and irits. Their main stackable drop is law runes. If you bring a looting bag your trips should last a fairly long time and each one is 200-300k I think.
---
You can stand under the rune and addy dragons and they wont hit you. Just remember to move out from under them when Galvek does his fireball. What problem are you having at Vorkath?
---
Almost like they should've just ditched this idea in the first place.
---
You'd be right
---
10-20k is my guess.
---
Do Druidic ritual to unlock herblore and tons of quests 
---
If you think about it slayer is a very well designed skill if you’re looking to addict players. You have like 4 different short term reward loops: leveling up, getting rare drops from monsters, getting an awesome task, getting a lot of superiors... it’s OP my brain can’t resist
---
I mean 'risky' is relative here. Tons of pkers are at the burning amulet tp spot (not even for bone runners, often for rev cave people, but they'll attack anyone anyway), whereas the graveyard is basically the same distance and not a soul is there.
---
On top of that, you are most 'vulnerable' right after TP'ing because you have your full invent of bones. Once you're at the altar you'll quickly use them up and even if you do get attacked you can often still use most if not all of your bones anyway.
---
Ourania is relatively fine 30k xp/hr after 60 and  semiafk with runelite or intensive without it. 
---
You can ditch pouches for afkability, making it as afk as mlm and such but lower exp. 
---
i blast through 60-77 in one week playing 3-4 hours of rc training per day, just to give you an idea.
---
You make a profit of 200-400k/hr dependent on your clicks and luck with the runes.
---
:( 
---
Sad to see this going on.
---
Stakers depend on seller like these.
---
I agree.  Stacks of giant coins would be cool and add some color to the room but it's way too busy as it stands now.  Also, fighting a boss on top of a pile of constantly shifting coins would be impossible in real life.
---
It was under a different title right? Did someone reupload this? 
---

---
Thought he meant zulrah scales at first. 
---
Ye
---
That's a good question. If you tweet at him he would probably elaborate.
---
what do you think about this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQKP7uJOy7s
---
But it barley relates.
---
Computer isn't necessary to setup 2fa, have you followed the instructions for setting it up from the main page (in your mobile browser)
---
I have a clue scroll with coordinates inside the ogre city. I've already done Watchtower but the guards keep shoving me off the cliff every time I try to hop the barricade. Do I need something special to pass them? 
---
What did you bring, mage gear wise? 
---
My solution is allow the game to be tailored to cheaters, and mules, and stuff. It's interesting for a lot of people for the xfering rates, which help keep pkers around. Risk vs reward money makers for those who like that challenge  and account building and quest speed running kinda thing.
---
You should mule if you can, you still lose levels. Maybe add some mechanics that if you receive items from a trade you must actively play with it for a certain amount of time before the timer on it hits, then drops it.
---
And I thought I got screwed... I just did a hard clue and did two quest to get to one of the steps to get 32 laws a rune pl8 body bandos vambraces and a Magic short 
---
I don't know anyone that's on less than $20. None of these people have any qualifications. They're just standard labouring jobs. I'm fairly certain even working in a super market is like $22. So even though minimum is $18 you or at least I never see anyone below $20 and most seem to be on the $22/$23 mark.
---
i thought he was gonna sell the beer glass for 2gp and buy an ale

still pretty gud tho

Don't you mean KrispyKreme?
---
I also *see* his mother every 10 weeks Ha! 
---
reality is many clans and even people from this sub has tried to fight these players head on for the world not hiding on pures that they can't attack and rot won. its just part of the game man its the communities fault they have zero competition.
---
I disagree, albeit heartbreak can be fatal, there is one soulmate for everyone, brother

The guy had to get 60 fm burning the log spawns at the top of the castle I'm sure he had a fine time cooking beef

I did a  q p in the standard chat, and then someone in my clan chat said something with a W, and it lined up pixel perfect. He didn't even know about it, wish I took a screenshot.
---
honestly with those stats, and the swamp, you might have an easier time that I did. I don't even a fire cape.
---
Took me about an hour and half maybe before my first kill, and by then I was already picking up on the patterns.

Switch Prays &gt; Move &gt; Switch Gear.

Jad phase is easy, it just alternates.

Im by no means on an expert, but I'm decent with a mouse.

Buy 250 Manta Ray, and 150 Karambwan and some zulandra teleports.
---
Learning Zulrah is easy because there is no downtime. Die &gt; get food &gt; tele and your back in it
---
does it though? each aspect of the combat triangle has its pros and cons. Pros of magic = special effects (freeze etc), cons = little KO potential.   
---
  
---
They are balanced as they are. The issue with magic has to do with magic defense on black d'hides

Don't log out with any wealth on or in your invetory.

I do know I use runelite instead of the official client and I don’t have any problems

The client should know the server time and therefore all it has to do is remember what server time the offer started at.

Sorry man I only follow one god and its God Ash.

A Zaros themed quest where we have cult members trying to resurrect one of zaros’s main followers.  Desert treasure type quest?

---
Some would just pluck the notes in the song but you also added flair and feeling, gives it a warm character. I say if you tighten up the note consistency and got a good recording it would be very popular. Cheers lad, all the best and I look forward to hearing more! 
---
Not even then. Pray boots
---
This way other people's pets will get in the way of right clicks. Not sure how i feel about that.
---
which one is which, quick please I'm almost to jad
---
Are you saying sea world, or see the world?
---
Most bosses in oldschool are made to be solo-ed, raids works very well as an ironman and so does all the slayer bosses. Corp takes a while, but it is really fine. And the wilderness bosses eveeyone just safespot anyways.
---
The only thing ive found a bit annoying as a high lvl ironman is gwd, those bosses were not designed to be soloed and thats the feeling you get when doing them as well.. But they are not horrible unless you go really dry 
---
Yeah because its hard enough with 10 seconds of standing still
---
C
---
I'm at 1k total on my ultimate ironman after being placed on third shift lol

Yeah that's it. Unfortunately most of the episodes have been removed. There are a few re uploads tho.

---
Not sure how to caption a video yet but here’s my shit rendition of the intro to the song. I couldn’t wait any longer to clean it up but next one will be autumn voyage :)
---
&gt;If you required specific weapon types, then people would bitch about 3rd Age Longsword being BiS for something
---
Why would someone bitch about 3rd Age when Dragon weaponry are basically the same. Again, even if you just bring a certain weapon as a switch to counter a mechanic, that is enough to give them a relevant use.
---
Nice repost 
---
This is like the terrible flute version of the 20th century fox theme and sucks enough that it should be the official Jagex anthem.
---
Crab rave too but I would be rolling on the floor if this played during clips showing off Jagex weekly fuck ups
---
God bless you sir 
---
that guy isnt  evenn an employee of jagex
---
true bae
---
Thats some real fucking dedication over there
---
Yep. As soon as I hit 99 slayer I quit the game, nothing else felt satisfying to me anymore.
---
There's a thing online that simulates prayer flicking on jad. I'd link it if I was on my desktop, it should be easy to find. I'm not trying to sound rude but with 92 range the only thing stopping you from getting your fire cape is you. People recommend doing it with like 75 range. 
---
how so? btw im a norwegian so i might be void for anything else.

Imagine thinking you're trolling a scammer but really responding to a bot

Don't worry bro, Jagex will add one new quest called Desert Treasure II and it will be expected to tie up all loose threads from the Zaros lore when instead it's just an excuse to shoehorn a new 5m/h+ boss into the game

When and how will it spawn?

Maybe you finally realize this game isn't suppose to be complex?  I watched the videos of this Raids and tbh i don't think the boss mechanics are that intricate or unique. It's only because of a few attacks that forces players into a playstyle that isn't popular to begin with.

Not trying to white knight Jagex here but the double standards between industries are outrageous.
---
Example: MTX spending cap.
---
I absolutely hate MTX like treasure hunter and solomon's store, but forcing a company set limits on how much shit they can sell is stupid. Do alcohol producers also have a cap of how much alcohol they can sell to particular distributors/ consumers? They don't. You can trace all sorts of shits like mountains of debt to alcohol consumption (or even addiction) as well, so (possible) self harm shouldn't be a factor.

how does the rs3 one actually look this much better

He took his shoes off on a flight. That's an asshole move.

Swamp would traduce to pantano, so.. pantanoleptics?

I mean I gave a lot of examples of how its not. Just because a few of the scraps of what make each room unique exist in a solo doesn't make it good design.
---
I mean it really just sounds like you aren't particularly experienced at tob and haven't actually gone and tried solos. They really just aren't good content.
---
Seeing how no-one actually gives an explanation and just downvotes you're probably right. Petty attempt at stirring up drama.

Hahahahaha I love this so much

rs3 farming update: player owned farms where players grows animals, doesn't sound bad right? wrong. You get roughly 300k exp/day without any other farm runs. And it costs only couple of gp/day and it has led to tree seeds to plummet because every other method is bad.
---
Osrs: Farming guild where players still grow regular plants, gets challenged to grow a certain plant in a guild and gets rewarded by seeds, has farming boss that you can access by farming. no methods ruined.
---
I agree, i prefer osrs more than rs3 but still occasionally visit at rs3 to continue to max it/doing quests to keep my quest cape in rs3,osrs and perm dmm.

The animation continues for a bit after you stop fishing. Clicking the fishing spot when you're already fishing also cancels your action.
---
Just a wuick thought, do you have to be within level range to cast "heal other"?
---
Cause i feel like, when in wilderness, that should be the case.
---
I can see valid arguments in both directions. I personally think in a game like runescape, you should never be forced to run a team for any content. There are accounts made to play by themselves with a game mode literally for it. Should they be locked out of content? No, but multi pvp shouldnt suffer because of it either.
---
Lets be honest here. The problem isnt the pvo zones or the action taking place. Its the clan doing it.
---
These are the slimey fucks who ddos tournaments. They will lie, cheat, and steal to get what they want. Theyll Dspear you and ancient mace you for bloody 50k and they are incredibly toxic.
---
You CAN put in features to limit exploits and abuse of toxic players without ruining pvp. Which I think should he implemented.

You lie. It’s no longer on top.

I play because I'm unemployed and pretty much ran out of other games.

---
Sorry, you said in your original post "Jagex" was saying these things. Jagex helper twitter accounts are the twitter versions of forum mods really. They don't speak officially for jagex in any way.
---
&gt;And clans hoarding revs and attacking anyoen going in is ragging,
---
it's really not, and jagex (yknow, an actual jagex employee not some rando on twitter) has directly contradicted what you are saying.
---
&gt;i even said i would run out there and die however many times would be required for them killing me to BE ragging on their part. all jagex has to do is give me a number, i will record myself going out to revs and dying that many times to clans to get them all banned.
---
Throwing more developers at a problem doesn't necessarily increase productivity

Thats a fairly toxic mindset and that viewpoint can be used for anything.
---
Ddosing deadman mode? Dedicating time and players to profit.

Hacking accounts? Dedicating time and players for profit.

Lets be honest here. The problem isnt whats taking place right now. Its RoT is mega toxic and should be taken action directly.

Just as a short bit of detail about who I am and why I value respect so much. I know some people may have brushed that off their shoulders, especially as a trial member in the clan, but that ain't me. Thanks for taking the time to read and comment :)

Yeah, extremely rare is the only way id like it.

Not sure about that one, man. Clearly the guys in the FC are fucking airheads, but military service has no weight in that situation. Thinking it does will lead to nothing but you getting pissed, because 15 year old kids will shit on it if they can tell it's something you hold as important.

I'm with him on saying you worded it poorly. Not American.

They could make it so that the chest is called Baby mimic and you deliver it to npc in z who then says please take reward from that giant chest over there. They could make it more of a Reward room after boss battle feeling with Giant chest (which would be the mimic boss) in middle with few coins scattered around with chests of gold and stuffs at background like rs3's mimic boss (not from clues) https://i.imgur.com/7Ffx6DW.png .

 Wishing to get in contact with a Jmod directly about changing my  accounts Email, as i no longer have the access to the old one (yes i  have tried the recovery page on the runescape website but because the  account is over 14 years old it is rather hard to remember all the  recovery questions). Thanks 
---
This is gold.
---
🦀🦀🦀JMODS WONT RESPOND TO THIS THREAD🦀🦀🦀
---
He’s obviously challenged. 
---
Do you neeed to trap Jad? If you are confident with your prayer switches, you can then concentrate on running around Jad (out of melee range) to tag each healer, and then line them up so only 1 can attack you. Tank it and finish off Jad. 
---
I want to say it’s tehnoobshow.
---
Ya lol cut ties , this clan obvi trash 
---
Trust me, you are not old! Majority of the player base is in their 20s and I even know people in their 40s that play!
---
Most important thing is quests, quests and then some more quests. Some people find then awful and some people like me find them fun. Either way, they are very important for your account. They get you through the slow early levels and unlock content.
---
The big quest you want to work towards is Recipe For Disaster. It has big requirements but unlocks a very good piece of armor for the glove slot.

That sound like a tempting offer. I love me a person in uniform :). Yeah avoid the toxic CC's. I find that when someone toxic joins a CC they invite their friends and it bakes it uninhabitable for casuals and chilled folk alike. You can always do better!

His Reddit account is 6 years old. Guarantee someone can recover his account with the info he’s leaked over that time. The question is who will be autistic enough to go through all thousand of comments/posts?

Your suggestions are terrible.

Besides Jagex already does offer ingame benefits by giving you 8 additional bankspaces and another 8 for the bankpin. 
---
The leftmost chest in there literally gives max cash. Confirmed by Mod Ash on stream several months ago. 
---
I'm okay with this idea except when you go to open that chest, you should get a message that says "The chest is securely locked. There's a faded engraving around the lock; Only those with invisible crowns of gold can open this chest." (References Jmods) 
---
are we looking at the same picture

Yea, agree with those above - nobody gives a fuck about your petty squabbles.

Are you really so lonely in real life you’d post your online arguments here?

I also use his guides however I noticed he tends to lie a little here and there and it's quite damn annoying or he'll make you do something he knows doesn't work, feigns surprise etc

idk what youre trying to gain from posting your drama. cc's arent some institution that requires pristine and integer leadership. many are groups of friends of friends. where ranks dictate how close they are to the owner not how capable they are. and in small groups this is fine.
---
hell no
---
It helped me so much. 2 healers spawned behind me and had to walk to jad which I could easily tag. The other two spawned next to jad to I hit em with a chin and aggro'd one. I just out dps the other one. You can do it

Zaros want's to guide the world from the shadow? world. allowing people to choose what to believe instead of following a god. So him being manipulative doesn't really fit imo.
---
It feels like you are portraying Zaros as an evil god, while in the rs3 quests its pretty evident he is far from evil.
---
Why do you even need to flick? He was low enough HP, or you could just let him get really low and then finish him. Seems a bit of a silly way to die.

Zulrah is fine at your stats. Decent money especially if you hit a unique
---
You should do Monkey madness 2 for seed pod and access to demonic gorillas, Dragon slayer 2 for access to Vorkath and ava’s assembler. 
---
The quests suck to do but the rewards are damn worth it
---
I’m not heavily invested in oldschools art although I do like it, I wouldn’t be opposed to oshd for example but only if you’re doing everything at the same time otherwise it just doesn’t look good and isn’t consistent throughout the game 
---
Protein from the chicken and fibre from the breadcrumbs... balanced diet 
---
agreed 100% consistency is important.
---
Might try ds2 ty for the ideas
---
Right...
---
So you want Jagex to give you access to an account. An account you're unable to identify yourself for as the account creator.
---
Yeah, that's never going to happen. There are reasons why Jagex can't help you through direct contact and why they rely on this recovery form or your registered email for account recoveries.
---
Quick guides are the best 
---
What does.

Why are u surprised if ure mixing a bunch of different gear

Pretty sure pet always drops on death no matter what.

YAAAAS! I especially want a Zaros themed poh chapel! I've been holding out on maxing my chapel for when they finally let me build one. 
---

---
Oops
---

---
Zulrah would be your most viable option if you really want to make some cash **right now**. I wouldn't really recommend it tho, you can make enough money for anything you need through slayer (which levels your combat stats, very useful later), herb runs, and birdhouse runs. To put it in some perspective for you, Zulrah with your stats and not max gear would be around 2m/h. If you wait to make money til you can raid, CoX gets 4-9m/h... And ToB gets 10-20m/h. 
---
Getting 77+ RC to AFK blood runes wouldn't be a bad idea, not the best in terms of profit but it's one of the best AFK skilling money making methods out there (if not the best, since most skilling is either sub-100k/h or click intensive).
---
Getting your hunter up would likely be a good idea as well if you'd like to play efficiently, red chins are OK profit and black chins are AFAIK the best skilling moneymaker in the game (Not counting running ess for people at ZMI, since you gain 0 experience doing that) on top of being the best hunter xp in the game. Going for 99 hunter via red/black chins would make you a decent stack of cash (Enough to get 77 prayer, 83 construction, 78/90 herblore, rigour, augury, and still have cash left over for gear) and you wouldn't "waste" any time with inefficient bossing.
---
In terms of goals... Quest cape stats would be a good start, then knock out at least the important quests (Fairy rings, ancient/lunar magics, barrows gloves, DS2 for assembler/fero gloves, etc.). Might want to work on some diary reqs as well (specifically seers hard and western province hard, both are extremely useful). Past that, decide what you want to do later in the game... Do you really enjoy skilling? Then go for base 70's, base 80's, elite diary reqs, base 90's, and eventually max. Do you really enjoy PvM? Then go for 95+ combat stats (Atk/str/def/range/mage) through slayer, 77 prayer, and figure out the rest of the skills based on what you wanna do (Chambers of Xerics? Go for 78 or 90 herblore. Theater of Blood? Go for elite void reqs which come from Western Province hard.)

Normally high action for a shitty guitar is caused by the neck being angled wrong entirely. Truss rod could be out of wack too. However, if at all possible he should take out the saddle and sand that bitch down on the bottom, and pop it back in to lower action.

Spent about a minute looking at that trying to figure out if it was a typo, or some strategy/technique I haven't heard of. Like a... TELEport PROTect? Leaning more toward typo.

With King Arthur I kinda figured that since his kingdom was in a different world then his title as a king in runescape was mostly ceremonial. He got his castle from the Sinclair family so I thought he might actually be considered their vassal.

Wat else would u even use. Yes always worth it

It doesn't stop how hard you get hit, but can make those high hits hit less often... I seem to get hit a lot less with Karil's than d'hide, especially from the rangers who can be pretty accurate at long range... I try to hit them at melee range as much as possible because their melee hits are weak. 
---
Nah I'd just use a row
---
How about buff the rapier?  A weapon that is meant to be the best stab weapon and get is bis nowhere because of how op the Lance is. 
---
And for melee always use a bring
---
Nice Mohawk son of a mother brother and cape! Gz

Then people should be able to sell P2P items when their F2P runs out . Can’t scratch one back and not all.
---
Looks good to me tbh
---
From where I stand, you're the one who got angry because he got told he was wrong. And you were. The guy you're arguing with's point was simply that your comment was completely irrelevant. Magic and range attacks from jad have exactly the same max hits, and you getting one shot from mage always and not from range is literally just luck, hence his comment that you should stop spreading misinformation, because it is nothing but that. 
---
Even if you were just talking about your anecdotal evidence, it's still irrelevant and could make people think that the mage attack is more dangerous. It's not. You don't have to be so mad because you're wrong. So yea, a little common sense would greatly help you, because clearly, you're the one who's in the wrong here.
---
Nope against 0 magic defense enemies it does essentially nothing. That’s why it is possible to burst in prossy or do barrows in graceful/range gear.

This is actually a necessary step in extinguishing a fire. Once the hose line is charged by the engineer and the pump panel, the firefighter on the nozzle has to “bleed” off the residual air in the hose. When there’s a raging fire that needs to be brought in check, it’s not very wise to feed unnecessary air into the fire which acts as a fuel and can make conditions worse. 
---
It would be botted on shit tonnes of accounts and luck would occasionally result in a few bots gettinh max cash. Don't kid yourself, it would ruin the economy lol

Yup, go ahead and attack the only part of my argument that could possibly make you correct. Or you could read the rest, and realize that this problem occurs with any piece of armor

Do them, get your range up a but and do some vork. I can also vouch for demonic gorillas. Usually make 4-5m a task, but recently I got 3 zenytes in 180 kills

I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock  from the results today. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the  fucking fuck is he disqualified? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking  breakdown. I don't want to believe Jagex is so corrupt. I want a  future to believe in. I want Torvesta to be DMM Champion and fix this broken Game. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed  to be like this, I thought he was doing well in Slayer???? This is  so fucked.

As pointless as adding uppercase and special characters is, they have addressed in a newspost that they're considering this.

Was just not hitting and prayer was low.. i was pray flicking fine till got distracted by chat. Should have just banked but im an idiot sooo this is what happens lol.
---
Who said i ever got pked?
---
Yep. Less loot to grab= more bursting time I find
---
And relying on sound is the worst advice you can give too. The sounds from different things, like you or the healers attacking, clash with jad sounds, and there's no way it's easier to learn jad that way than just fucking watch his feet.
---
Nope, I usually just wear my ring of dueling but I do it with just range/mage. You could use an archers ring if you wanted and if you are using melee I would recommend you use a zerker ring.

You dont kill the boss, you punch the flowers, leave, and repeat.

Honestly, just keep exploring the game and enjoying yourself.  As the game has gone on, people have learned the most optimal/efficient strategies.  This is great for those of us who played normally a decade ago, but try to just figure everything out for yourself!  Google is your friend.  I'd try to use clue scrolls / quests to guide your account progression.  Don't worry about your age, you fit perfectly into the average age of the community.
---
And above all, have fun!!
---
yeah I do know that one but there comes a time in a man's life when he has to say ENOUGH
---
Nice base 1 stats
---
Selling gf
---
Indeed lol
---
His video guides still showcase everything you would do in the quest normally just in a much faster, neater and higher quality than his original guides
---
I'd suggest against rushing Waterfall Quest.  It's a decent skip through the early game, but if it's your first time playing, skipping through dodges a good amount of content / learning.
---
Honestly i didn't even see that much hate here, well other than the usual amount that every new update gets. It was mainly on twitter where for some reason there was massive hate.
---
If no person think it’s looks bad without content creators telling them to think that, the idea never would have originated in the first place
---
I mean, you're not wrong, but it's wildly misleading. All the mods have a strict schedule (they planned on releasing it today). Your title makes it sound like mat k is personally chewing out mod ghost in particular.
---
And it might not even be mat k that enforces that schedule, just the mods themselves trying their best.
---
Yea and now I’ve got a million other things 
---
Game Center thinks my number isn’t my number so like bruh
---
If Jagex wanted him to be mysterious they probably shouldn't have released DT or Curse of Zaros miniquest just saying

What /u/_LeeLee_ said. 
---
Just go for it dude. 
---
Have fun playing a game for once. 
---
After we collapse a pillar on that ugly thing called sea slug queen
---
Why does the 2h clue scroll reward make you shorter?
---
Depends on how much you're gonna use it. I used a DCB a d Broad bolts almost exclusively from like 72 to 97 Range so it was worth it for me in the long run, but the upgrade is fairly small. Anguish is much more important of an upgrade, and Blowpipe is nice but it costs a lot more money to maintain and you can't use Blowpipe against Dragons or Wyverns while you can use a DCB against anything
---
Yeah I think you might be a little retarded.
---
dragon crossbow, no. dragon hunter crossbow, yes
---
Can't you have posted this in 2008?!
---
20 gold? If you've completed the quest you shouldn't have this problem
---
It's gerrymandered so gnomes can never win an election. 
---
this made me laugh out loud and i’ve never even been in the caves
---
I have 215 qp, solely using his guide, and I think he has only forgot to mention something without pinning it later once. 
---
Real treasure was completing the quests so you can get 1 step closer to QP cape
---
Good to see them taking action! Some might complain this isn't 'enough' but hey, it's a start!
---
Yeah what I do now is just tag the first healer that appears with the blowpipe and kill it. Then when the next comes along I do the same until they’re all dead. I’m in the same boat at you I wouldn’t know how to get a cape on a lower level account. I just basically abuse how powerful the blowpipe is.
---
Ask Mr Mole, I’m pretty sure they’re banging

Getting hacked a couple times was like a rite of passage when we were kids just starting to play this game xd but that's how we all learned.

With the farming requirement in place is it really that big of a deal?

Why are you crying? Mod Gambit happens to be a funny lad. The "KBD" he spawned doesn't deal any damage... it's just cosmetic.

Thought the song was out of tune, quickly realized i got bamboozled

I'm gonna try this method next time I go for my fire cape. It seems so much easier worrying about one switch.

Using scb's for slayer cuts into gp/h for no reason. The only time you should be using them is in serious pvm where you profit the 2 invo spaces

Ourania runecrafting until the big 77. Also, farming.

What kinda stuff ;)

Nah he explained in the tweet. It is the average price the item is sold at. So it sells on average for 2.5gp. He didnt actually track for how much they sold.

What’s fun is I managed to walk away from this quest with a hell kitten. What’s not fun is everything I just said. 
---
They're being downvoted because that's not socialism, and Venezuela is not currently in the mess it is in because of socialism. And because either way, it is sad

Always wondered if this ever gave u better chance at loot

The price of the leather body (g) is going to be huge I think. Even if it's a beginner reward. 
---
Every pure and their mom will want one for risk fights, especially in f2p.
---
Nice

Blowpipe is generally BiS, but has a high cost to use (and shorter range than dcb).  Dcb/msb are only useful if you're trying to be cost effective (like slayer).  dcb is better on high defense targets, msb on lower defense.  
---
Not sure what spyware they refer to. These sites literally ask you to type in your Username and password.

...you know, so they can install spyware and hopefully get your user and password later on.

you can get just about every skill to level 20 or 30 by doing quests

this page has a great list of all the skills and the quests that get them up
---
Gotcha, thanks! 
---
Seems like a scam. Make sure you hide your run energy or your account is COMPROMISED
---
You are somewhat right... but still, don't you agree that even though there are bad things in the world that you can't change alone, a small effort still counts? Like, I realize I can't save the world, but I'll still try to have a positive impact. Or at least not make it worse. Because if you exaggerated your way of thinking, it would mean no good thing ever should be done because there are still other problems. Pointing out problems doesn't require you to immediately put in all your effort to change that. Sometimes even understanding the issue and talking about it can be beneficial because it educates. Meat is a great example actually. People hate to learn about why it has negative consequences so I appreciate those who at least admit that.
---
Sounds are seriously useless outside of PVP lol.

Gatekeeping in a game where people collect burnt food lol mmk

No where is sub optimal if you can physically see the big fucker when he spawns.

That's the smarter way to do it. You can get faster search suggestions 
---
there are too many in the game and get dropped annually so no
---
Why👏 do👏people👏do👏easy👏clues👏and👏expect👏500m👏drops
---
No, they do events every year giving out party hats, Santa hats, etc. They’re not going to become rare again. 
---
I always think high level PVM is an amazing phenomenon. Two years ago I was struggling to kill Jad. Now I'm flicking Bandos, chinning armadyl, etc. Once you learn prayer flicking, all other PVM just becomes so easy.
---
I also worried myself because I remembered trying Jad as a 12 year old and failing every time.
---
I wouldn't consider partyhats rare, seeing as how we get more every Christmas
---
I think most people are frustrated when they read a moron's drivel on reddit

When you have a fill inventory and you get a random that gives you an item, then it will stay for like 4 hours i think. So probably from a drunken dwarf random event

I did sulliuscep, yew, redwood and i have to say yew and redwood is best for afk and xp

I've never believed in stuff like that before. Now I do, I really do. I feel incredibly lucky and loved upon.
---
nice. can u do gnome village party next?
---
A lot of people aren't really super capable of being educated or willing to be educated, that's why it's still effective years later and will still be effective for many years. Most users don't care about security, it's just a waste of time to them until they actually lose all of their items.

I love how this has been in the game since 2001 and just now we're discovering this.  Makes me wonder just how much more of the game there is to uncover.

Yeah i have used that guide on almost all hardcores, thats why im asking for another fun start tbh. Repeating the oziris guide is ehhh. But thank you for the reply lovely sir &lt;3
---
nah, i got magic fang and a serp visage in 1 drop
---
Magic shortbow  pros is good vs low defence monster. Ammo is also cheap.
---
Bp is generally good vs all for dps. Cost is the cons
---
Crossbow is slow dps so is good against high defence monster. Ammo is average price...
---
Nice repost
---
Just like when people fake laugh when they're watching TV with someone. They wouldn't have laughed if they were watching alone, I'm 100% sure. Or when people fake cheer at football games, pssh...

---
Vorkath is one of the only places in the game that has risk when you die though, it comes with a cost of 100k. Which is leagues better than just no cost at all.
---
A system like Death in rs3 would work just fine if Jagex had any intention of giving dying a punishment while giving no incentive for ddosers. He keeps your items for you when you die, similar to theatre of blood, vorkath, zulrah, etc, he keeps your items forever until you die again - but you pay a fraction of the cost of your gear to reclaim it, and set values for untradeables and degradeables. Or, you can choose not to pay to reclaim, and instead run back to pick up your gear for free. I don't see any cons with it, when it comes to integrity.
---
However, they don't want death to be punishing at all, so nothing ever changes and dying stays an extremely minor inconvenience compared to what it was in 2007 and prior. 
---
~~wil~~ will
---
Actually i think people dont hate the look of mimic, is more about the mechanics and how it spawns. 
---
Why you gotta project like this?

Man, that guy deserves a tbow

It already is a stronghold question I’m pretty sure

They usually don't get you to install anything to your computer though.. All the ones I've seen just lead to a phisher

---
Worked for me! I failed at Jad 3 times. Once I panicked, once game lag caused a pray switch to miss, and 3rd I panicked on healers. Got him 5th attempt.
---
Trick is to take your time. Protect mage, watch him, make sure right pray is selected, make a single action (like switch to chins or attack a single healer), then switch back to mage if necessary after the attack and watch for next pray switch.
---
Trick is to always try to stay at protect mage until you see that stomp.

I wonder if he has time to work on official client using GPU instead of CPU now, cuz current game uses only one core to work

One day he will get one, and then well be kicking ourselfs saying, why dident we do that ?

No, it was three guys who were more than aware we had already been in that world. When you see two guys waiting at the door I think it’s pretty normal to continue to hop for an empty world
---
Ayyyeeeee
---
Fandom one was better before it stopped being supported.  Runehq still better quest guides.  New wiki suxxxxxx.
---
Maybe you can also use a compost potion or compost on a mimic chest to have it puke out normal rewards if you don't care for a fight?
---
Lmfao so that’s you crashing them then. You don’t own a world. You own being in the room. If you all leave the room it’s free for anyone to take it lol. They definitely didn’t crash you
---
Zammy might be useful if you wanted to do wildy Slayer and not bring a defender.
---
You know the quality of Jagex artists have fallen far when not even an account security PSA can escape looking wacky and dumb as hell.
---
Genuine improvement, nice.
---
I prefer the term gilded ;)

His discord said something about irl issues. So hopefully he comes back in full force and we can get those sweet hour and a half eps
---
I didn't until that fucker messed with my cat
---
/s ofc :P I mean that people have different behaviour when alone compared to in a group. (In this case being watched by people, but basically the same thing)
---
Why is this guy downvoted? I don't see anything bad with his suggestion of using both sound and visuals?
---
Looks far better. Whilst I'm all for community outreach, sometimes some people on twitter can be insipid morons. I really hope the devs don't take all the comments on their post as actual criticism.
---
Good guy zaros.

Except when he fucked up that Hydra. He had zero chill with that

Burst spells roll independently on each monster, so even 95.0% vs 95.5% accuracy makes a noticeable difference in the long run

you need tank items or you're just going to end up feeding chins to pkers.

Yeah. I really wish they could just implement it as a shift-click feature but supposedly it's extremely difficult to implement. 
---
Long story short you’re only going to point out quick drops that only pertain to your situation but then ignore the shit dry streaks he’s had on other weapons? Lmfao your whole mindset is flawed
---
I'm finnish but from the translations I found, I believe hypertensive crisis fits it well. Her blood pressure was very high, she could barely breathe, she described that her heart felt like it's coming out of her chest, and her body felt numb or something.
---
I don't know the best word from translation, but the doctors said it could have been a condition before a stroke (stroke is translated as 'aivoinfarkti' in finnish).
---
How is it user error if they weren't wielded they weren't on the ground and no where in my inventory?

So toxic? Lol you want to go out of your way to act like a child to bother other people, yet you call the comments toxic?

Definitely pick the range helm first because it's the only set that is useful on its own. BTW for Slayer you should try to get a black mask and imbue it at nightmare zone, it's better than void.
---
HOLY fuck, my uncle just came downstairs and asked me why the fuck i was laughing so hard.

Glad to see another lucky one. Yeah, I'm never gonna let my friend go expecially after this.

I had a couple glasses of wine a month ago and started browsing Twitch... the top stream had 3000 viewers and featured all of the mods discussing double xp. Now I knew that RS3 was the only game that got double xp, but thought maybe it was coming to OSRS.

Id prefer the 10k reward go to the devs.

I have a feeling that back in the early days people would do something stupid and email Jagex saying they left their room and their brother lost all their shit so they put that in

RemindMe! 1 hour

Frankly nothing is worse than underground pass, that quest on its own is like 2 hours long, but with fails, it can literally be a 4 hour quest easily. I tell people just get 70 agility and graceful and never worry about agility quests again.

I think we can all hold a small criticism against the advice of "stop playing those stupid games and go make real friends".

What did we agree on guys, no taking creepy pics of fellow virgins
---
I will probably try to get one of each prior to the update. However there is always the chance that jagex will prevent these caskets from having the chance of new loot. They have done it previously with bird nests. Not sure exactly how they will implement this one though
---
Yea I'm not complaining anymore lol.
---
I'm literally doing that quest as we speak, and its my last quest before i get my cape, god this quest is horrible.

It's because Settled tweeted about it. If he had tweeted that he liked it, it would have been the opposite response

Hello! I posted thhe continuation video as well. You can find it under my username. We won the first game at home by 6 but lost the away game game by more than 6, so we didn't make the final 4. We made it to the national semi finals though, they will start on 25th of April.

Great. Took me ~3 years to go from barely being able to walking on my own to now running ~10-20 miles a week depending how busy I am. I am in my dream University, have a 3.95 GPA, and am all-around successful. I'm ~5 years behind most of my friends in terms of school and my career, but I am alright with that. I can walk. I ended up meeting an amazing woman who would never have passed my path if not for my health issues. I'm great.

Mixture of asthma, dangerous blood pressure and a flu. Doctors said it could have led to stroke with bad luck. All tests have not been conducted yet (the most critical ones have), and neither of us are doctors or know barely anything about the subject.

Yes, the person taking over your spot has no way of knowing if you went to the bank or not. Once you leave a boss/spot it becomes fair game for everyone.

I'm talking about Void? Not sure where you're getting 4 extra items from. Mage void gives 45% accuracy bonus and 2.5% damage bonus and when you're camping Barrows for a very long time then the small accuracy void increase from Mage void adds up and you don't need to bring a ranged and melee armour switch besides the helms.

Like the other guy said it's so hard to make progress early when you spend all your time making money to buy bonds.  Unless you are playing 4+ hours daily or an experienced player I would recommend paying for membership for 3 months or so, until you can do a higher level money maker.  
---
Yeah I have come across it, and honestly I usually let one live so that I can stay at 88% chest percentage

If there was 1 spawn and you crashed, yes you're the asshole. If there's enough and they're rude, you've got every right and moral reason to stay

I still don't remember grim tales very well 😅
---
1/400, stop crying
---
I mean I dh’ed at base 70’s just fine
---
Yeah thats how mine happened. Only had two on me tho thankfully. I think it was because I clicked the next door on the same tick as he spawned so when I went back inside to fight the first Karil the game didn't think he spawned. I hit him once and went back into the other door and it seemed to stop him from spawning again.
---
looks like ph4me to me

Defence stats mean nothing against Jad. If you mess up a prayer, he will hit you.

You don't spec/pool POH method at kraken. If you bank and come back to kraken and someone is there, it's technically fair game(as with any NPC) but it's still the asshole thing to do

Yeah, that would be convenient

&gt;I'm an old person (read: over 25 but not yet 30)

Pretty much everyone who plays OSRS does so because they played it when they were kids 15 years ago.

Do quests. I liked knocking off as many as I could that opened new transportation options to make it easier to get around the world. Open up the world map, see if a place looks interesting, then go to it.

I don't pay at all, I just use bonds which I buy with the passive money from my dailies. Imagine monitarily supporting a game that cares this little about its community.

Nope. They had plenty of time to pick it up themselves. Better you get it if you want it than it disappearing

Do you want the short answer or the long answer?

That blows I really like Zulrah. I only have a handful of kills but it’s fun
---
If I accidentally missclick and barrage a monster clump an Ironman was fighting. I apologise but he starts insulting me and threatening me. AITA for doing it again since he didn't stop insulting me?
---
Multiple clues failed the poll. Stackable reward caskets passed - so that's what we're going with.
---
Are they directing you to go to a link? 
---
theres not a lot of value from releasing vids like this.
---
it's under ideal circumstances comparable to mediocre raids. however, even if you are a pvmer you have to participate in protecting the worlds which ofc cuts into gp/hr

It is the original 2007 giant coin design though...
---
Phishing email. Jagex doesn't ask for account information over email (only on the recovery form on their website), and they'll *never* ask for your bank PIN.
---
yeah zulrah is very fun! I sold all my zulrah gear to buy a DHCB but I might just do a couple more days of vork and buy my zulrah gear back to try again.  I didnt give it enough time to get good at it. 
---
Thought so, thanks

Don’t tell him before you actually receive it lol

i put one away cause i forgot one of my graceful bits. I did this to not get roasted but set me self up for this now haha
---
Are 2 beavers better than one?
---
Not a bad shout - I think it'd match the set. 
---
Lmao.
---
It's also an amount of time that really does fucking nothing because you aren't using that time, unless you are currently in combat then you get a single hit off with that "extra time"
---
112 for sweden aswell
---
No, that won't be possible since it failed the poll. The reward caskets will be stackable though.
---
If you're on a Mac, it's Option + B. I dunno about windows.
---
you dont
---
&gt; If you made ToB more easily soloable it would trivialise ToB because everyone would be doing it.
---
I would be fine if everyone would be doing it. I don't think it would trivialize it anymore than any other bosses. 
---
&gt; Also as a note, if your idea is to change the mechanics to be more solo friendly, you will still die at nylocas.
---
You could die at any of the waves.

You could just do something else while growing the cat, but okay.

Just trying to figure out the best order to get certain items. I only have about $2M in the bank, so wondering what should be the priority on items to help me get more money through slayer and bossing. I have 70 att, str, def, and mage and 73 range. Currently using dscim for combat, guthan god book for mage, and rune cbow for ranging. So would my dps be better if I got an abyssal whip and filled my sammy godbook or should I save up for a blowpipe? I figure I’d have 75 range by the time I’d save up for that anyway. Thanks in advance! 
---
does just clicking on the link give them your PW? I saw one of the twitch streams about quitting, and I rarely go on twitch so I clicked on the link but immediately noticed the website name was off so I closed out.  Should I consider changing my info? its been a few weeks but nothing has happened
---
Yah but I could also have barrows gloves by the time I was done growing my cat soooo
---
I want to say yes?
---
NVM all of a sudden its working,  
---
unsure but maybe it was because i was using a 'fresh' account
---
thats ofc a phish. theyre on your account, they dont have your pin. That "first bank pin" is a bait because ofc most people dont change their pin ever.
---
scan your pc, change your email password, add 2fa. Then go to runescape.com, recover your acc. 
---
Yeah but imagine keeping alll that bond money and only paying $5/mo. 
---
You make it sound like im giving them some absurd amount like $11 *psh*
---
Gotta do a test swing first sorry

Yes, downvote and move on

Cmon man

There’s your answer 
---
I learned how to do it a few months ago. I'm just not a fan of team-based content and prefer soloing stuff.
---
Have some fries with that salt man. 
---
Yeah but it requires purple sweets and tick-eating. I consider tick-eating and one-tick prayer flicking to be exploits and contents shouldn't factor them.
---
Rather just have a alternative way to negate the arbitrary mechanics or have them removed entirely.

If you're looking to make money for membership you could do blast furnace. Early on, combat is not a very good money maker as low-mid level enemies don't have valuable drops.  
---
There's a money making guide on the [osrs wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide), but to filter out most of the stuff that is probably not viable with just 1 week, blast furnace is often suggested as a good money maker though it is quite click intensive.  
---
It doesn't have high requirements to start doing it (but doing it at max efficiency does) and you can make it slightly easier on yourself by levelling your f2p skills before you use the free membership trial - 50 mining and decent combat or 43 prayer for protect from melee lets you get the ice gloves, and 60 smithing removes one of the costs for using the blast furnace.  
---
Fletching is also a decent choice if you don't have much money to start off with and you're looking to make some capital (as you usually need money to make more money) and it's quick and easy to train, so having to train it up before you can start making money isn't that big of a deal.  
---
Enchanting sapphire rings is another low requirement option, and is pretty afk. Once you've enchanted one ring your player will automatically enchant the rest of them (not all at once) which is great if you want to keep up membership without feeling like you have to play the game all the time just to be able to play it, you just need to check maybe once every 2 minutes.  
---
Though I do agree that it's much easier just to buy a few months of membership if that's an option for you, it's not that expensive and it'll save you hours of grinding.

So you’re right, but some things I do disagree with. I meant that clans aren’t an issue in the sense that you don’t usually get pked by clans while in multi. I didn’t really take muling too much into account. So that’s correct. 
---
The second thing about escape routes. I both agree and disagree. A true player would in theory know all escape routes, but that doesn’t guarantee survival. The point I tried to make with this post is that on your journey to becoming more resilient, you’d likely get pked multiple times and you’d be slowed down significantly. Moreover, carrying stronger gear only makes you a bigger target. (This is partially irrelevant since the pkers go for anyone, small or big target). I’d like to think I know most escape routes, but there are still 20 second freeze timers, and the damage output from stronger players is just too high for a lower level to escape. Even in a zone with multiple escape routes, you’re still very likely to be bound for a minute straight, which, against a good pker, provides enough time to do HEAVY damage. The other thing I want to mention is that brews are 30k a pop because all the herblore guys control the market, so they’re inflated. So realistically, new players can’t afford to carry 20 brews. To add insult to injury, restores are 40k, and sanfews are 100k. Once again a lose lose situation. 
---
I do applaud that you started long after and were subsequently able to come out strong. Maybe it’s just my playstyle, but it’s found it incredibly difficult to do virtually anything in the game efficiently. Even maxed players in DMM345 claim that you’ll 100% get killed if you even enter the warriors guild without 70 range and 70 defense. As someone who has been there, this does in fact hold true. It is possible to escape, but the true deadman mode spirit is lost because you’re supposed to stand and fight, but in reality once again you don’t stand a chance so you’re forced to run. 
---
Sorry for spelling errors, was pooping while writing this. So I do agree you make some good points, I guess i just see the game mode in a different way

Yeah dude, most people don't think they'd get phished either. What's worrying is that so many people are doing this on runescape, they'll probably end doing this with more sensitive information too. People could end up giving away personal details, bank details, recovery questions really easily.
---
Glorious 🦀
---
Anyway back to the team thing.
---
The dark beast has the energy ball attack. It' looks similar to the Olm's portal switch attack, in solo mode the SotG could just make it so you have to move near a maze tile to reduce damage. Otherwise it's basically a glorified Callisto shockwave attack.
---
For Verzik lightning, they could slow down the homing speed and make it so you have to run through the boss while it's chasing you or something. I think insulated boots reduces the damage too.
---
Most of the bosses moves  are not difficult to maneuver or anything, the real reason why players are discouraged from attempting them is because they are objectively tedious and obnoxious over a long period of time. Some perfect examples are Drakes before the breath nerf and Vorkath's acid attack.
---
That is why i think bosses should generally just be the way they were before Vorkath existed. 
---
So I shouldn’t attack him the whole time even with ranged/magic? And I think I’ll do what you said, 37 magic then use firebolt. I don’t wanna keep wasting time trying to cheap shot him 
---
watching other people do it really helps you learn
---
It was definitely a different time. I think it's because so many more kids were playing back then, and it was really commonplace to pretend to be a girl to get free items because naturally thirsty children are going to throw away their items for fake affection. What's more of a status symbol than having a female character following you around, I guess?

You'll notice playing ironman that you're gonna end up in a lot of infinite loops, i.e. "I should do x before I do y, I should do y before I do z, and I should do z before I do x". At some point you kinda gotta bite the bullet and just do something. 
---
It is true that if you waited to do todt till higher farming you would get better seeds, higher mining better ores, etc. You kinda gotta decide for yourself whether you need the todt loot to jumpstart or if you wanna save it for later. 
---
hands down my favourite content ever
---
&gt; So you're usually naked or not wearing any armour. You might have what, like 3kg on your person?
---
We were specifically talking about whether or not you're prepared to fight a boss. If you're naked, you're not. If you're carrying around full armour/weapons/food/supplies, you don't weigh 3kg.
---
You can't argue it both ways lol.
---
This whole comment chain started with:

&gt; Having to gear up for a fight that probably isn't going to happen would get tedious real fast.
---
Well yes... But that doesn't explain why they stayed in that world. It would be better to hop worlds I would think 
---
Does settled control The mods now? He literally complained about it yesterday and they fixed it right away 
---
Less than an hour. Little longer if you're low farming. 
---
uhh no lol
---
Not really going for the whole “this is an unnecessary world and we need more osrs worlds.” I see it as jagex unintentionally creating a way for players to simply capitalize on starting early for their own personal gain. In other words, a server that allows for easy money making just because certain people have a huge head start. Veteran players can just farm highly coveted items, sell them, and swap them - and because there’s such a small player base, the prices are controlled. GE really didn’t help the game that much

again it would still end up with tob being far easier, if it wasnt for the tick eating req for solos for verzik and sot.

They seem to be a more detailed model, actually. The original Grim Tales coins are just a solid color with a flat, 1-tone design, while these coins have 3 tones and a more intricate pattern.
---
Definitely inspired by Grim Tales, as they should be, but they're not the same model.
---
It's not a tasteless meme though.
---
They already removed the coin floor lol
---
I did that towards the end of the video. Do they have to be perfectly centered in each section? It definitely is a really pointless random but I want to be able to beat it at least once.  
---
&gt; As far as i understand the reason that there is nothing like this planned is because for now there is no solution for fair drops
---
I'm not so sure this is the reason as reasonable groups do have splits and things like runewatch exist. I think it's more about adding new drops and how to balance them and them not be dead content.  You're going to expect some sort of niche drop or bis drop that holds value and most people don't want these bosses flooded with skilling drops.  This is kind of hard to do and then you need to find a quest/lore/reasoning to add it in.  
---
It is kinda weird having a “competitive” game mode for money when it’s largely based on RNG
---
Either or!
---
Bad analogy. Manual transmission is fine. The only valid complaint I can think of for manual is that it's not as common to find them anymore, so there's newer drivers that may never encounter them.
---
Point was that people behave like that when other people are around them than when they are alone.

Thank you, after playing the game for 9 years on and off and always being laughed at for using a cooking skillcape, I can finally defeat jad and obtain the cheese cape. Next will be the barrows gloves! I’ve already started learning barrows runs so I can do them faster and get my gloves sooner.
---
Wish me luck! :):)
---
No, I don't think there has ever been a time when Jagex as tried to step in and fix the economy. It will sort itself out with time.
---
Wtf is wrong with you. W45 player here. 
---
Yes reseting the server is a good solution for 2 weeks then later we’re worse off then now. Retarded idea to reset. The people who would play the type of game dmm is arent put off by anything currently in w45 dmm except the population. This wouldnt bring in new people and would just eliminate the semi-active 45 players 
---
Next, delete dmm? Again dumb af. All this does is get rid of fun that ~”200” people enjoy playing. This is a net negative solution. No one wins, only loses. Who the fuck cares if 30 people make money from dmm for the real game? 
---
The real solution is to just add quality updates to dmm. Stick vls on there. Stick chaotics, add soulsplit/turmoil, add overloads, whatever. Make dmm the “fun” pvp test mode. This keeps people coming back. 
---
 The swap rate is actually stable-ish. 50x rebuild xp already exists. It wouldnt affect the game mode at all if combat xp was 50x. 
---
Pretty sure different countries still have their own number, but its an automated redirect. For example, if you call 911 in the Netherlands, you'll automatically get directed to 112, and the same happens if you call 110 (german police emergency number) here. 
---
Vice versa, I'm also pretty certain that if I were to call 112 in the USA I would be redirected to their emergency service automatically

---
That’s what the duel arena was originally supposed to be.
---
What you're saying is a 5v1 against a med level is acceptable but bc the mains are smart enough to make it a fair fight since hes only 1 person it's not ok. If they wanted a fair fight let the mains hit the pures? Then they wouldnt of healed the med level. Have them bring a main to combat the other mains. Get defence and they can combat the healers. You act like these people made a 2k med level for this specifically, it's difficult to get 2k total. Hes handicapping himself and complaining about it.

I beat Zulrah with extremely similar stats, except my defense was much lower. (about 76 I believe). It was tough and took me about 5 real attempts but I watched a ton of videos. My first kill was when I swapped to just using void and necklace/Cape slot switches and focused purely on the mechanics. Kill took me around 5 minutes. 
---
It is possible, just expect frustration
---
It’s so... unrelated. Oh well, I suppose that is the function of the downvote button. 
---
I think it's this. Most people are right handed. When they enter the castle, your wrist (hence your mouse cursor) shifts to the left in order to run up the popular south stairs. Shifting your wrist left is less effort than shifting right, you can try yourself if you're right handed. 
---
&gt; thats a hard disagree from me, there's a reason tob learners are so rare.
---
It took me only 2-3 tries to figure out how to deal with the mechanics. Out of all of them, the only bosses i find favorable were the bloat and the bat boss. Other than you just need to stand in a specific position. There isn't an intrinsic challenges in my opinion.
---
&gt; Again you are suggesting pretty major changes, which is my point. 
---
What would you change to the bosses if they were solo able then?
---
I wouldn't really bother changing anything because the length to complete a raid only lets you do maybe 1 or 2 per hour anyway. That and most suggestions are "add this that you move away etc" which are unfavorable. If it is easier as you claim then reduce the general loot from the chest should suffice with 5 man team giving bonus amounts and maybe increased change of obtaining a unique drop.

---
I recall bosses came up a while back on the Q&amp;A and I think they said there is room for a boss like that or similar. The reason we've seen so few new simple group bosses in OSRS is because we already have a lot of them while there weren't many endgame group or endgame solo bosses. But now that we've gotten a good bit of those, another GWD style boss or similar may happen. That said, technically the new Skilling Boss seems to be a bit like that, but it may be more involved.
---
It's my go to when I want a wc lvl soon rather than just doing magics on mobile. It's like the nicest balance of afk/paying attention to xp for me. Much prefer them to teaks for whatever reason.

JRE 6 was supported (to the public, at least) until April 2013, so there's really no reason to switch to a newer version - don't 'fix' what isn't broken. Companies using "old" but still supported versions of software is extremely common - it's plain business sense to not spend money changing what doesn't need to be changed.

Theyre in a messed up order for some reason. Im telling him that his probabilities he calcualted arent actually as astronomically low as he puts in the video because of the way he calculated the probabilities

His account looks pretty damn progressed based on the large amount of untradeables/hard diary rewards I see. He should honestly have that quest done by now and be very close to Quest cape at this point.

It's not what I'm implying. If you had to retrieve it, I'd assume you were not in control of the account. Whoever was in control of the account probably just recovered it back from you.

It literally does, but with the logic you provided you sound like a dumbass so whatever. Cool beans bro.

I hope Ash went up and collected his award

I do. It's part of what you sign up for as an ironman. Not only that, but it doesn't prevent you from getting anything, it just means that you can't do 1/16 Hard Emote clue steps.
---
Like I said, it will make getting a crozier that much sweeter, when on a normal account croziers are next to useless.
---
Whats more surprising to me is that he even wants the infernal cape. Its not very good and doesnt save him many hours on the way to 200M all. And he only just recently got it after being very deep into slayer, would be different if it was before starting, but even then it makes such a little difference its not worth it. And basically if you cant get it within your first few attempts then youll have spend more hours on attempting inferno than what you save on it.

How is someone optimizing an account for PVP an issue with PVP?? And I can boss just fine at 45 defense, have like 370 zulrah kc, 2 TOB and 1 COX KC. His issue is none of his stats are high enough. Get magic and range 85+ and you can do most stuff in the game IMO.  
---
&gt; not everyone is interested in efficiencyscape and getting their character PVM bossing as quickly as possible. Some people just want to play the game to have fun.

Then just do Konar if they find it fun like I said. Doesn't change the fact that she's trash to do and is basically a crutch that hinders your progression.

Is forming clans a bad thing?  Being in a clan is significantly more beneficial across all games almost absolutely.  If you want to play the game on hard mode as a solo player that's your choice.  And lol, it's fairly unrealistic saying that there will only be one clan left

Could we have an option to remove email login and use only Google login?

I'd like to see proof of this because I can most certainly tell you that this didn't happen. Imagine Jagex trying to say that it's against the rules for a clan to hold down a pvp area. Reading your reply is essentially if a clan is targeting SPECIFIC PEOPLE. We are not targeting anyone in specific. We attack anyone and everyone that comes in and isn't with us. Sorry to say that you've got your own reply wrong.
---
Jagex told you " However, if it's a case where one specific player/clan is specifically targeting you (not different people/clans), then feel free to report them at [tipoff@Jagex.com](mailto:tipoff@Jagex.com) and they will investigate it"

The answer is probably yes. The player didn't ask for the most efficient method. Plus being sub 100, GP and slayer points are probably more important than a few extra slayer xp/hr.

What you're saying doesn't make any sense though. We don't even have 50 meds. We have 50+ mains.. all of which are different people.

You're making up random bullshit to fit an insane suicide narrative you have. You just keep repeating the same thing. "I'VE BEEN TO THE CAVES I'VE SEEN THE CHAT!"

No. You're wrong, were proved wrong, look silly and are just arrogant and making up false facts because you're mad.
---
Our cc is no different than your pure cc. Has chill people. We do chill things. Except we have a buy in to join us. Either pm me on discord or stop bothering us. Next time you come caves and harass us and claim you're not doing anything we'll expose you.
---
Fuck you, you stupid cunt.
---
I played during this time and have no recollection of anything like this, nor do I understand how 5,000 player characters were killed at any point....
---
&gt; not tryna be a dick to them but some teams just don't worry me
---
Not a dick at all man some people are better than others.  Where I get where you are coming from I was just speaking from the perspective as the pker who gets noted bones from dinh's dudes.  FL is hot garbo even with their cannons at the cemetary.  Fools is iffy when we've run into them and so is flamingos.  I've watched these #clans tb, pile, follow us to trade specs, and then spec each other instead or hit their own teammate off for us to get away too.  
---
I know this also adds nothing but fuck it upvote
---
Everything you are saying is irrelevant because I TOLD HIM TO INSURE IT 2 WEEKS AGO WHEN HE GOT IT.
---
Tabs pls
---
Are you really gatekeeping osrs, a game known for being a sandbox mmo? Fuck right off. OP obviously enjoys the game as he played long enough to wield a godsword. 
---
Jmods wont respond to this thread.
---
Awesome
---
no offence but this feels like a copypasta ngl. Good work man
---
1. PvP is PvP.  If ragging is specific to bounty hunter, then it shoudl ONLY be bannable IF that person is on a bounty hunter world, but also, you claim if i dont want to engage in PvP dont go into the wilderness... How does THAT not apply to anyone else here?  You dont wanna deal with the fact you will be temporary inconvenienced by someone you could EASILY kill?  Dont go into the wilderness.
---
2. I cant just not go into the wilderness, Ma2 cape, BEST IN SLOT MAGE CAPE is there.  If i want that cape, an item i want for PvM becuase NO PKER HAS EVER USED IT IN PVP, i have to slog through the wilderness, using an item that actively kills me, and risk PKers.  If i want a dragon pick i have to go through wilderness, if i want wards i need to go into wilderness...  all thigns i want for PvM are gated behind PvP.  THAT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW IT SHOULD WORK.  PvP items shoudl be in PvP areas, jagex has to create reasons for people to go to wilderness because if they dont then NO ONE WOULD GO THERE.  And gating BiS items is bullshit.
---
3. Defending territory?  Its not yours, it doesnt belong to the clan, and only amplifies the issue, now this BiS gear is gated behind PvP, and RNG, and cunts who can see that im not risking by havign 2 items on in full monks robes, but kill me just because they can.  Using your logic i work in a grocery store, i shoudl charge you to enter my fucking store, then charge you for the items you buy, but thats not how it works.  As far as im concerned, delete revs from the game.  They were meant to replace PvP to begin with.  Or, have multiple rev caves, including one cave in single combat, or have revs become extremely aggressive towards skulled players and being attacked by one stops PKers from teleporting, and freezes them so they cant just sweep through rev caves killing everyone then walk out like nothing happened, because as is Clans dont risk, even if they all gears up in full justicar THEY ARE NOT RISKING becuase theres 50+ of them at a time.
---
Again, gunna point out what you said here: "player A is attacked over and over by player B, for no purpose other than to ruin his day, therefore not allowing him to participate in 1v1 pvp content"
---
THATS HOW EVERY SINGLE PVMER FEELS WHEN THEY GET ATTACKED, why is special treatment given to allow PKers to fuck with PvMers, but when a PvMer or another PKer does it to the PKer its suddenly agasint the rules?
---
Final note: If PKers want to do all this bullshit why did darkscape fail?  why didnt PvPers get behind that?  Oh... right... its becuase PKers DONT want to PvP, they want to be shits and ruin everyones day, otherwise they would fight each other, PKing isnt for PvP, its to ruin everyones day.
---
Badass
---
I think it comes down to age disparity. Fortnite is full of younger players who wouldn't be interested in voting in things like this while OSRS has older people that would. 
---
Most g maul builds are 13 pray at edge till around 64 or higher cmb I’d say. Prayer on a pure defo geared towards bridding &amp; deep wild.
---
No way the 235ppl that upvoted this have even one piece of 3rd age
---
&gt;thinking any vehicles is superior. That’s brainlet level of IQ there buddy
---
If I could stand by the door and get 1 point every time I close the door I'd abuse the shit out of that. You only get a few points for winning the game
---
Nah 12
---
&gt; Probably not a huge priority due to the % of people that partake in PvP related activities
---
They should've worked with pvp from day 1 when it was a mucher larger percentage of the userbase.  Time and neglect causes these numbers to dwindle a long with memory of Jagex's past failures in pre-eoc/rs3.
---
Me either. Just stumped across it and was confused as hell. 
---
Because he has a rune warhammer instead of a dragon warhammer, a rune warhammer isn’t a special attack weapon
---
There is literally no evidence to suggest they don’t do you have a source?
---
Speaking of slayer I'd recommend investing 1mil into the black mask item. Wearing it boosts your DPS during slayer tasks and overall makes them go 15% faster. It's worth it 100% and you can always sell it back when you need money. If you don't have the money you should really look into grinding gp. You're nearing the midgame of osrs and having a decent cash stack is getting very important. You need to be able to invest gp into items to upgrade your character. 
---
Am I missing something, I don't get it.
---
aw that’s a little upsetting, it should: 
---
A) be toggleable.
---
B) Across all clues+scale to player/clue lvl     
---
       -not catered to hogh lvl players
---
C) and be in the open world (maybe double loot for Mimic’s opened in Wilderness)
---
RWT is 100% unappealable. This is definitely a phish.
---
Nah
---
Welcome to DMM. On these worlds you die. Jagex warns you as you login everyday. If you arent expecting to die then you logged into the wrong game. Expect to die, be happy when you tank it. There are plenty of ways to survive as a solo player I spent a year solo and got high ranked managed to do whatever I wanted with some exceptions. But those are what you expect from dmm. If you arent 70 range/70 defence and you go to the warriors guild and die? all that happened was you learned you cant do that.
---
The main problem with dmm is that the average 07 player doesnt have the right mindset and this game wasnt made for the average 07 player. Which is why so many people say to reset or delete w345. As a long term dedicated player i can tell you almost no dev time goes into w345. ash responds to a few tweets promising to look into this or consider that and we love him for it. But it usually dies there. If you want to play dmm take jagexs advice and expect to die.
---
Remindme! 15 hours
---
Wait, I just watched the video while reading this comment and you weren't lying. 
---
Yeah I kind of got behind the fact that any of my suggestions would be cumbersome and, quite frankly, useless. The best thing I think that could happen is adding higher xp rates. In my head this has no salient downside, and it allows players to progress quicker. I really like the seasonals xp rates where it’s higher outside of safezones. 
---
[Here's my leftover fossil inventory](https://i.imgur.com/Vl8Y64N.png) (not a single fossil was lost or obtained elsewhere) and this is [the chat message you get once you get all 225 Kudos.](https://i.imgur.com/xBO8tm4.png)
---
Hit the nail on the head.
---
That's funny because the people on Twitter say the same thing about the people on Reddit. 
---
6x6 yea
---
I just had a friend come in with me and let me kill him.
---
You really should've started questing sooner. As a member you basically don't need to start leveling a single skill until around level 30 or so. Many quests give huge xp rewards as a member. For example, doing Recruitment Drive and Tourist Trap gets you all the way from 1-30 Agility, skipping the lower levels of one of the most notoriously annoying skills to train. 
---
revs are as much of a 'PvP update' as wilderness slayer.
---
&gt;they mentioned about talking to different PvPers for feedback on updates.
---
they'll talk to the same 5 dipshit streamers again.
---
you ever seen purespam or framed PK? all they do is sit at full hp, use skilless prod combos (msb ags/gmaul) and cry a lot, and when they're not doing that they're rushing or TBing with overheads sitting at overbrewed HP in max gear while complaining that they're getting ragged for it.
---
/r/woooosh 
---
Grind some runecraft! It sucks hard at first but once you get lvl 77 blood runes are great. Plus it would be a great first step to noted DK bones. Once you get to Cerberus/noted DKs/vorkath with slayer you'll be laughing to the bank, especially if you want to kill some hydras

You obtain fossils in Fossil Island and can put them under the Varrock Museum to restore the fossil collection, and with each complete fossil display, you get kudos and an XP lamp.
---
I suddenly realise I want to hear a full band cover of this.
---
Jagex  censoring "banned" on their only customer support page? Seems shitty 
---
Suppose to buy bond on a throwaway, then trade the bond to another throwaway, then use bond on main. Use a different VPN for each throwaway acc and never get banned.
---
I assumed he was asking if he should sell it (he'd have to gain some more gp to transform it first though)
---
Not really. The bonds were going to be bought anyway we're just benefitting from it
---
Not completely. The new boots will likely be 30m+ for a long time while these will prob be 1-5m. 
---
Why not put some third-age / gilded pieces in there? 
---
Agility makes the most sense as it’s the only one that won’t effect the economy.
---
Wins mobile game of the year... Still uses reddit as customer service
---
What did John Cena have to do with old school mobile? 
---
/s
---
I was mainly trying to make OP realise how insensitive his post was and  wasn't actually gonna reply to the comments but jesus christ. There are genuinely people that still think like this lmao.
---
Does your brain seriously associate selling drugs with breaking a virtual games terms of service? Those aren't analogous whatsoever. That's just "ignorant logic". 
---
You've also unknowingly brought up a genuine dilemma in philosophy, The Heinz Dilemma, yet you seem to have made up your mind on where you stand on it. Check it out, take a few minutes out of your day to learn something new. If you still share the same stance, fair play, I'll concede.
---
"special treatment"..
---
Clans were 24/7 camping rev caves and destroying the economy. Swap rate went down from 1:2.5 to about 1:1. The valuable drops from w345 were removed from the drop table, thats all they did. Swap rates have been about 1:1 untill the recent addition of the Grand Exchange, which has brought it up to about 1:1.3.
---
Changing the drop table was absolutely necessary and i don't believe that was a "notable development effort"..
---
That’s a better question because there is no real grand scheme but in relation to the pet thing, major details would be your inventory, skill tab, spellbook, quests etc. 
---
I didn't, just got addy gloves and trained to 20
---
You meant that sarcastically.. but that's may not be a bad idea
---
its fine until you use runelite 
---
The thing is, the initial goal for a lot of players is to get to a combat level where they can saliently protect themselves from higher levels, which essentially requires stepping outside of a safe zone to some degree to make leveling sustainable (I.e leveling range and mage for bolts/runes respectively)
---
we don't deserve something this good
---
1. It is
---
2. I disagree. I think danger should scale with difficulty and this accomplishes that.
---
3. I think the problem here would be the edge cases of allowing it to be fought anywhere. A simple example would be opening it in a multi-combat area which would allow it to be attacked by other players or opening it near a food source such as a bank or a farm patch. Plus with an uncontrolled environment they can't really give it any fun mechanics.
---
So no more Daredevil seasons because of your mining grind, Charlie?

They didn't lose to "them", they lost to the autists on here clamouring about how they'll take their $11 somewhere else like these jerk off addicts can go anywhere else to begin with or be good at anything else

Yesssss broooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥

If poll mentions 1 def = fail 100% of the time.

Pures got rangers tunic, blessed sara sword, regen brace. Bandos book but that was floated on arma book so i dont count it. 
---
Can anyone explain how they make their phishing work, even trough the 'secure dot jagex dot com' manual link?? Pretty sick if that's the case
---
Ranger boots are on the same table as every other unique item in medium clues.  Adding 1 item to the list is not going to make hardly any difference.
---
Now kith

I think that’s the way I’m going to go, fast 99 which I’m excited for. Any experience doing wintertodt on mobile? It’s turning into a mainly mobile account haha

JMods will reply to this comment.
---
So you’re saying it should be skippable? Idk how I feel about that but it is interesting. 
---
you really just need a few casts of fire strike or whatever to hit the jungle demon at the end, you can safespot it. since you have 44 pray though you won't even need to. you'll be fine, just be careful ofc.
---
I can't tell if I love it hate that sentence
---
Genuinely disappointed in the community lol. Sure my initial post was hyperbolised to an extent, as in, I doubt every single person killing green dragons is killing them to feed their family but literally no one's mentioned or refuted that point. Everyone's commented and argued against my point with the assumption that was indeed the case.
---
Oh well, I guess you can't change the way people think. People are just naturally assholes.
---
Crab rave when?
---
Lol if you haven’t noticed yet every other nice gets upvoted and every other one gets downvoted. 
---
Dragon Slayer 2 has a **LOT** of requirements. 
---
why do we need crush weapons
---
Anyone who upvotes this blatant bullshit who says "waiting for smackdown" is braindead
---
These scammers are evolving 
---
Rune Bars
---
both of these are normal mechanics for these bosses. they are indeed incredibly annoying, but increase the overall points and "number of bosses enabled" by more than they appear.
---
or imagine not using a dragon battle axe 
---
Honestly never realized ardy was south of catherby
---
Honestly, I’m happy with the game and there’s already more content I could ever get to.  The only way I’d come back is if I had a ton more free time.
---
In dark souls you can throw a blessed talisman at them and it makes them fall asleep with their mouth wide open for looting, was thinking something along that vein. 
---
I’m blushing stop 
---
Theres a handy guide on YouTube somewhere. The inadequacy does give 40-50k pts.

Against reddit rules to name them
---
This r funny. You are big gay
---
Are you saying my post is bullshit? 
---
I would spend hours on end at this minigame. I was just... addictive lol
---
If you can afford it, the Bandos Godsword would be an alternative. The main reason you want the spec is for the defense reduction, not the damage. 
---
The game is not melee focused. If f2p got fletching the meta would be to make long bow (u)s which are not good for ranged. Also can we not get fletching, id rather not steal updates from the failing rs3
---
How do you know that?
---
d mace is barely accurate enough to hit her. dds will not poison her, but has more chances to hit for overall more dmg. ima vote dds, but mage shortbow spec might still be better. good luck!
---
What an unexpected gank.
---
Depends on your stats, just complete the dragon slayer 2 quest and you’ll have it
---
flex that helmet
---
fuck i’m at 1.5k right now, hope your luck turns around and i get the pet before that kc. 
---
Terrible analogy
---
Now kiss
---
&gt;These "features" should have not been available to players.
---
Why? Because that's not how YOU want to play? 
---
You know what? Messages of when we finish a slayer task is just ezscape. We should have to ask the slayer master to see where we are in the task. 
---
You know what? The GE is too ezscape. Lets get rid of it and do manual trading.
---
Fuck it, if you're not an ironman, you're not actually playing runescape and should just quit.
---
Obviously I'm not being serious, but it's easy to cry "ezscape" when you dont use a feature that others like. Hell, I dont even use most of those plugins you mentioned. They just clog up the screen and distract me. That doesn't mean that others that can use them efficiently shouldnt be able to. As long as the plugin doesnt hurt other players (for instance, some infamous pvp plugins), why not? Agility is aids to train and I'd rather do it while watching a show instead of having to consentrate on osrs to do it.  Same with drop highlights. Its just convenience 
---
I think the fact he added the extra /s made it even better. No joke. 
---
No joke. 
---
I agree, but nex is a terrible example, nex has 5 phases that are based on current hp
---
Already got a finished high end zerker :D! And piety isn't really my thing, decided to make a 20 def!
---
[Viewing this image has been known to cause intense distress among /r/2007scape users](https://imgur.com/a/WeulNQ7)

Decided to make a 75 20 defence, but i will do Nature spirit and what lies below! 
---
Is kraken better with def pots?
---
And yet still an analogy.

Uh fuck.. Uh pkers are txic trash, fuck Pkers, vote no, raid kc?

???

Got mine at 76 too! Then another one at 87.

Is that mod Monroe?

The testing of PvP idea is actually a great idea.

Zaros quest line was worthwhile asf (curses pray book)
---
*facepalm* Just admit you're wrong and carry on. Next. 
---
Nobody inherently has a right to anything. You can do whatever you want but don’t be salty about the natural consequences. Specifically I said “the way I view it” so nobody would ask what you did.
---
it's a meme
---
why would you train to 13? you'll end up as a joke since you wont have addy gloves lol
---
Go for ini pure.. Black d hide chaps initiate platebody firecape and i think you can get rune gloves at 20 def
