I see. Either way I don't have a whip quite yet so I'll have to wait for that at the least. I do have dragon boots (over climbing boots) and everything else you listed, so I guess as soon as I get a whip I'm good to go.
---
---
---
I didn't care much for it.  It's click intensive so you do have to put more work into it.  I personally let the fish get autocut which gave me a short reprieve between catching fish, but I know you can get much better exp rates by actively cutting the fish every time you send out the bird.  However with that method you really are constantly focusing on the game.  If you're okay with that training style then I recommend it.  Also plenty of beginner clues should you care about those.
---
This is a pretty stupid mentality. "I'm going to crash you, but if you ask nicely I'll hop worlds, since I'm such a nice guy". People know what they're doing when they crash you. I'm not going to feign politeness when they already decided to be annoying. 
---

---
The only real way to deal with someone crashing is to ignore them. They can't handle crap xp rates for more than 10 minutes, they'll leave eventually.
---
haxunit? yeah get this guy
---
&gt; The efficiency obsession is ridiculous
---
Yes. And I was mocking him for being so obsessed with efficiency that he would shit on the other person for it.
---
&gt;people who get defensive and claim something is correct when its clearly not are annoying as well.
---
He wasn't claiming anything was correct. He was saying it was "worth it" and argued why he thought so. u/HiddenGhost1234 seems to think "worth it" is synonymous with "highly efficient" because that's how they like to play, but that's not how words work and policing the other guy over it was shitty haha

I keep a cannon base on me in case people act like arseholes. It's nice when you get to a point where you don't need loot either from tasks as you can outlast anyone. We're a stubborn breed.

Can you help me get my torso:rsn p2p inners
---
For leveling? Feathers, extremely cheap. Least that's how I did it 10 years ago, no idea if it is still viable.
---
Raiding and looting are not the same thing I take it.....
---
If it helps when I started doing barrows I was running around in a rune platebody and dragon legs so if you dont have money for better gear that will suffice. It doesn’t a lot to do barrows you just wont be as fast as better gear. Still could make close to 500k an hour if you’re lucky. If you haven’t done morytania hard diaries that’s a must. It boosts the amount of runes you get by 50%. If you’re close to finishing them or having the skills for them it’s worth it to put off barrows just for mory hard
---
Practice, then once you get comfortable with switches start pking with groups and in welfare.  Make a pure, theyre cheap to pk on and tons of fun, great for learning as well as you don't need many switches.
---
I thought they just cancelled that
---
Buy a bunch of minds, airs and a fire staff and find a demon to attack.
---
Idk getting to gnome stronghold is such an adventure when your acc is new!
---
I love wearing stuff I like the appearance of. Even if it's not optimal. Sometimes I walk around wearing noob looking stuff, too. It's fun.
---
Splashing is slow but very afk
---
If you want faster and more cost efficient, actually kill something. That way you get xp for the spell and damage rather than just spell plus drops. 
---
Imp Catcher + witch's potion gets you to 10 or 11 magic.
---
Sara Sword for cheap strength training weapon maybe? Otherwise whip is better for def and att.
---
Why is the second "i" lowercase?
---
Thank you!
---
This mentality is exactly why I was surprised and excited for the series
---
Going to be honest mate, but it is really difficult to get a permanent mute. I'd put money on you being a dick on multiple accounts and you haven't stopped so they got your main.
---
Isn't there a demon under the mages tower that's southwest a bit of Lumbridge?
---
How much of a speed difference are we talking about in splashing vs killing? I'm stuck to only using mobile so I would like to go with something less click heavy.
---
I don't remember what Imp Catcher and witch poitions are, sounds like a member thing. I'm staying free to play till I get a PC soon.
---
Dwh kc?

Trying to win an internet argument by criticising grammar? 
---
Is it 2003?
---
Watching pro DMM gave me a whole diff perspective on pk intricacy. The best players are absolutely nuts. I suggest checking them out, it's crazy.
---
Sara sword almost the same price as bludgeon, a cheap str weapon would be leaf blade axe, or SOTD or granite hammer I guess lol.
---
Idk i just know i got my 99 str off sotd and a bit of dh.
---
Needs to be much more oldschool looking
---
Why would you choose to view any other content creator and deprive yourself of another "HAI AND WELCUM TO MAI GUIDE"
---
If you have 100 slayer points spare then you could unlock the 'Hot Stuff' perk which allows Duradel, Nieve and Chaeldar to assign Tzhaar slayer tasks, so it would speed up your practise times within the caves!
---
Why I'll never learn to raid:
---
Defense rarely matters for slayer
---
yeah, when i died i spawned in edge walked to ge spirit tree, took 30k out of servents moneybag, took zammy cape from caperack, fairy ringed to lighthouse (lumby elites and house fairy ring),  got bandos book bought some potatoes at warriors guild and a rune sword from champions guild (teles on jewl box) and then killed 40 goblins with a rune sword

I'm sleep-deprived enough to give this some serious thought, and I feel like there are no objective BIS items irl, but in some situations certain items are BIS. The spoon is the BIS for soup.

Thanks bud.
---
one of the original ironman challenges on runescape was a group ironman lol
---
Played casually for like 3 months now, still dont know how to level hunter lololol
---
If you can't figure out how to get to the gnome agility course, run energy is the lease of your concerns
---
There was a post on here recently with someone getting fc on mobile playing casually. You can do it!
---
Didn't someone literally just post a picture of 190M experience with no pet? What gives?
---
Ranarrs used to be like 10k ea, now there around 7-8
---
I miss the bartering and waiting for that trade notification back in the old days. You never knew if you were gonna make bank selling stuff or bagging a bargain there. Was always nice as a noob to trade high level players just to see expensive items in the trade screen. Ahh.. the good old days
---
I’m sorry...somewhat delusional all day as this is what I’ve been thinking about for the past 72 hours. Got the kill though!
---
I meant that you have to manually cast those spells (they can only be auto cast with a staff of the dead I believe).
---
My friend started when mobile came out and quit about 6 days later after I gave him a ~150K starter pack because he was so tired of having to walk everywhere. F2P energy is a major problem.
---
You'll need to spend at least another $200 first
---
You don't pvm much then
---
Yes I agree, we'll write OP a prescription for 35 hours of grinding.
---
I remember flipping flax and logs on 2 accounts, posting fresh zybez ads, and realizing i was making 4usd per hour at peak times.
---
really was a golden era for osrs at $3/m
---
You can do it, but getting 75 ranged for a blowpipe would make it a lot easier. I hope you bought bonds and didn't use a gold selling site :)
---
Ding Ding, if you think Iron's get salty about their spot being "stolen" wait till you deny the "optimal cannon spot" from a normal player.
---
I average about 30k a patch with farming cape, magic sects, and the attas plant.
---
I honestly hate you. You're so full of yourself  you think that your potato salad is far better than it actually is, you never pick me up when I need a ride and you litter too much.
---
We shouldn't be friends anymore because I disagree with your views on the carbon tax
---
I encountered this level of organization while risking 500k, probably on 50 different occasions.
---
dumb question: is rannar more profitable than snapdragon?
---
Well, I don't, but 10k is 10k.
---
It's better to set up a block list for turael if you are gonna turael skip. Bears, kalphites, banshees, ghosts, wolves, and lizards are good blocks. 
---
Other decent turael blocks are crawling hands or dwarves as well. Really up to preference for what kind of tasks you want. The initial list is pretty afk with a cannon. 
---
For the best spots to kill things from turael, join the Gear discord and look for the turael slayer section.  
---
For those wondering, you can skip around 30 tasks an hour with turael, equalling to 900 points an hour worth of skips. It's incredibly powerful.
---
Its not as much about the hosting location. Its more about the representing flag. Now all dutch people find each other throughout the servers, but a general server(s) would be nice.
---
I mean osrs is just filled of bots everyplace you go there’s more bots then players
---
I'd vote for a lumby course especially if it's F2p
---
HA: 1 coin
---
Sara is my favorite good because I think I'm better than everyone else
---
That would be another option, but I don't think it would be the best choice. Gnome is 8.9K while Draynor is 9.3K; it isn't unreasonable to stay at Gnome and skip Draynor if you wanted instead of trekking back across the world. It is also pretty easy to get back from Gnome to Draynor or Al-Kharid with Homeport.
---
But if you started in Draynor, would it really be worth going across the world for another 400 exp per hour? Especially when you would have to come back to this side of the world for the next courses. Also, it would be annoying for players who start playing after a decade away to go all the way to Gnome to start Agility only to find its level was changed from 1 to 10.
---
So I think it makes more sense to keep Gnome at Level 1 and add a new Level 1 Rooftop with like 1/3rd the exp per hour somewhere else in the world. And Lumbridge does work well since it is one of the only major locations without a rooftop course and it would be hard to miss. Even as far away as Draynor wouldn't be as obvious since it is outside of the normal range of tutors and such.
---
I have. Made no difference in the poor fps. I've tried just about everything with the plug ins. I turned every single one off, and still the problem persisted.
---
I was 16 when that happen. So I was already smart enough to not fall for all of the other scams. However that was the only one. Though alot of people fell for it, because it was in the same year Jagex came out with the current color system.
---
&gt;higher effort to yield higher xp/hr
---
I feel like Falador and Canifis are kind of backwards though
---
I mean nh pure fighting is still rags but now you’re just spending runes
---
Honestly big fucking support. I know RS3 did this sometime around when I made the switch to OSRS and it sounds like such a good idea. Since it’ll be locked behind an end-game quest, only REALLL Chads will be there.
---
Well I'm not focusing on Woodcutting right now, and the more xp I take down during farming the less I have to work on when I'm actually at the guild, I have a lot of other things to worry about than whether magic trees aren't worth chopping.
---
Who did this 😂
---
Friend of mine went 325 dry before his first purple (sang); he has 800+ kc now with 7 drops so it has improved a bit - hang in there!
---
Damn that’s unlucky
---
There is no ge sell limit though
---
So i died and repayed him and it worked -\_-
---
Dude old school rs2 pre eos, melee was the way to go for karil. Toxic trident is just op, and it didnt work out well because all of my combat stats are less than 75
---
Pretty sure they have no plans to release iOS until full release, due to how Apple handles betas.
---
Friend of mine went 325 dry before his first purple (sang); I did 90% of the raids with him, and would always meme his luck. He has 800+ kc now with 7 drops so it has improved a bit - hang in there!
---
Nah at high levels a lot constantly have fury/ring/staffrisk
---
Con of having a non-ge world. 
---
It will have 1 player that isn’t an Ironman on it, which is OP
---
Haha it wasn't too bad. A 2004 basic Dell Desktop, but it got the job done. It definitely began to struggle around 2008 when the HD update came along.
---
I boosted UP with summer pies from 51 agility, its a pain but you can get through it with patience.
---
Its not fun falling on the last jump multiple times in a row
---
I used an ags and specced twice and missed once and hit a 40 the other. They laughed I hit a zero with 75 attack and 70 strength
---

" reading a wiki for 4 hours" If you arent stupid, you would just look up the single page of interest and read it. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tree_Gnome_Stronghold
---
Heres the page for your dumb ass since youre apparently too stupid to figure it out yourself. Read the transport section (it might take you more than 4 hours cause of how fucking dumb you are). Gives you all the quickest ways to get there, with links the the relevant pages if any items were mentioned.
---
All of you are so fucking stupid and keep usingg the dumbest fucking arguments to try to support your point. Im fine with people discussing this and disagreeing, but you all keep  pulling straw mans out of your ass to make it seem like its *impossible* for an early-game player to spend 5 or 10 minutes to walk somewhere in the game.
---
Yeah, I'm actually really surprised it isnt there at the top tbh. But that's what it means, that's why people sometimes say "the virgin _____ vs the Chad _____" or will say "what a fucking Chad" when someone does something badass. It really depends on the context, but I'm like 99% sure that if some runescape player called you a Chad he meant it in the badass way. Theres the definition that you said (douchebag) and theres also the incel lingo definition which stands for a normie who has sex and picks up all the women.
---
Technically, he could've been mocking you though, since it would be the equivalent of calling you a unit. Who knows.
---
Hmmm god hydra brings sommuch raw go into the game
---
Is that Enel’s face from One Piece?
---
Where is the original post? This is my screenshot so I’m trying to find out where it was first posted haha.
---
Devils advocate: They don't want the devs to spend a big chunk of time developing something rather niche that they're not going to be using. Obviously group Ironman isn't the easiest thing to develop (engine work ^TM ) or they be able to implement it and put it to vote rather quickly.
---
I actually haven't! But I wanted to think of something that would fit into what already exists in the area and I don't think Lumbridge actually has a decent layout for a "rooftop course" to exist.
---
"Houd je bek, nerd." is van Thermometer 4.
---
odd, do you have an integrated graphics card? I know one of my buddies had the same problem and he played on a laptop with an integrated card and a performance card, and runelite seemed to automatically use the bad one for some reason
---
Void is hella bad pre 99 range and dex if your target has any defense at all.
---
As other dude said, pre torm evoid mage and dhide. Or just dhide and ahrims/mystics. Really voids useless pre tob/corp anyways
---
How many tenches did you get? And would you do it again? I'm passively going for this
---
I think the way I wrote it is confusing maybe. Im trying to say the first day whips were actually in the market and available. I sold it for upwards of 60m - so there was very few circulating. Basically got this dude in splitbark/mystic 20 lvls higher to fight me (I had a gmaul out, and was doing the 3 spec glitch) and i ended up 3 specing him, dude either forgot to protect? Or didnt think he would die that quick. 
---
Either way was lovely. Ive googled some old pks that were uploaded on a clan forum I was in back in the day on either monkey 933/44 warriorz 44. Monkeys the acc i got that whip on though. I used forum.tip.it and posted it there I believe but this is 14 years ago+ so most the images i had online are broken now lol. Might still be some old ones up tho I'll try googling those 2 accounts again.
---
Eh not that fun to have done to you as a new player trying to level. Sorry I don’t have enough time to play osrs to ascend past my normie status like you.
---
oh nvm then, glad it worked gl
---
Gotta be a troll to be this stupid

I relent, 4 hours was an absurd number, but still, you shouldn't HAVE to read a fucking wiki to learn how to play a skill.

If you hit the buy limit it would work since buying from yourself doesnt count.

How would rune dragons be with a z hasta + DFS + full barrows? Still worth doing over gargoyles or wyverns for AFK cash? Currently 99 att/str/range and 90 defense

I feel like a rooftop agility course wouldn't be a good fit for lumbridge. I suggest some sort of crappy looking, and almost insultingly simple, agility "course" in someone's basement. Imagine an NPC Making a big deal out of a NEW STATE OF THE ART WAY TO TRAIN AGILITY EVEN FOR THE MOST AGILE MASTER ADVENTURERS. And then it turns out to be similar to Dwight's gym from The Office. He could charge 10gp or something goofy like that to come in. Would be funny and much more fitting than a rooftop course I feel like.

My one problem with Jagex is played having to rely on reddit for customer support. They’re such a great company and it’s unfortunate no customer support is going to hold them back significantly from becoming popular. This is a grindy game, what player wants to put in hundreds up to thousands of hours, get banned and never be able to contact anyone about it? I made a pure once, leveled it a bit in f2p, left it for a while only for it to be perma banned lmao. I didn’t even trade it gold yet, thankfully. Just sat it at chickens for around 10 hours total, casually afking on it. Never heard back from support.
---
You should do some Slayer monsters :)
---
Finding a raids team is like finding a job when youre 16-18. Nobody will raid with you because you have no kc, and you can't get any kc because nobody will raid with you.
---
If d axes could be needed for raids and were more rare at wintertodt itd be worth as much as a dpick.
---
You completely misinterpreted what he said
---
Yes. This would remove the extra click to look at the wiki page though. It doesn't save enough time for me to bother to set that up but yeah.
---
They did the same thing to my friend , he basically kept posting on the Facebook page for a week straight and he was eventually unbanned saying he evidence was reviewed and they decided that whoever broke the rules wasn’t the owner of the account even though he was in the same spot he had logged off in and nothing had been moved lol.

The g.e screwed me, I would sit there for hours upon hours just merchanting.

Yup I remember that too!  "buying lobby certs!" And having to hold the click to trade em all instead of "trade all" option...lol

Not a fan of the no xp after level 15 thing, but otherwise nice concept

he might aswell be botting for 50 hrs, he'd probably get away with it instead of autoclicking the same spot for 1000

As long as you don't mind actively monitoring your character, it'll probably be more profitable to do the wilderness tasks.  I blocked revenant tasks, but other than that I haven't had huge pker problems (I average about one log off/tele a task outside of lava dragons and black demons, or when I'm cannoning near revs).  Once you start to get familiar with the wilderness, it becomes a whole lot less daunting.
---
I'm working on the entire series that leads to the music you get from MOS Le harmless. First hard clue on this account, fun!
---
Sorry bro, I didn't mean for this to turn into an argument. One final comment and I'll call it quits. I don't think that he understands that there is a very big difference between "worth the time" and "worth his time". Personally, I couldn't care less about how he chooses to play. The only reason I commented was because he tried to justify his choices by disregarding the fact that it's a terrible way to train. OSRS is designed around time investment. You get out what you put in. If he gets less for doing more, it is fundamentally not worth doing. That doesn't mean he can't or that he shouldn't, just that there are better alternatives.  You can't just disregard that fact just because you choose to play the game a certain way.
---
Where the fan at?
---
At that point wouldn't you either pay for runners or run it yourself on alts
---
Then you can’t multi log or transfer wealth between characters
---
Few hundred mil and depression yeah
---
One of the biggest disappointments when I transitioned to OSRS was realizing that the dangerous randoms were gone. You fuckers will ree at changing the nostalgic locations or the EZScape of buffing agility/rc rates. But you voted out dangerous events? I don't even care if they were useless against bots, they were fun and exciting.

You mean since they changed it so that it's no longer possible?

Yeah but how is that f2p? Sure he did it on a f2p account, but if he’s using p2p accounts for funding than he’s just p2p with extra steps and restrictions. If he were true f2p, he wouldn’t have spent any real money to accomplish this, which he did

No, you can’t run at zmi anymore. Now it’s 4m/hr at astrals or 7m/hr at lavas
---
did you notice how I was false banned before?
---
Yea I get the appeal behind it. Just wondering what mechanics need to exist for it to be a non-trivial extension of single-player mode. I feel like it's basically mainscape if your group is big enough since you're just trading with your "inner circle of friends" anyway, but it's more challenging if it's just duos/trios since content like GWD, Corp, and ToB is well designed for that sort of thing. Also not sure how good/bad the engine is, it may not be well-equipped to handle the scaling required for very large groups.
---
I guess it's not really worth speculating... I'll think more deeply about it once any information about group ironman becomes concrete at all (e.g. whether they are able to do it, whether it is being polled, whether it passes said poll, etc.).
---
thank you, i will try that out
---
I was gunna ask if it was good for ironman, is there any better ways or is this actually the main way irons do zulrah before they have the herb lev required
---
Personally, I'd keep my Ironman and just make a new account to do a road to 1 bill from scratch. Gl though either way.
---
Elite void is used for vorkath, corp, chinning, and tob basically
---
It's not a trick but there actually is a strategy... If you see people in typical TB gear,  (usually you can tell because everyone in actual dps gear will off you and some kid in shitrobes and a mudstaff will be standimg there nonchalantly staring at you) you put on your best mystic prayer and magic defense gear and pray mage
---
Your suggestions are ass and you're a huge twat on top of it. Alch yourself

Hm very interesting maybe i will do these for the clues then!

I would definitely recommend it was a lot of fun but you definitely have to be in it for the long haul because you could get un lucky

I don't doubt they're making money. But a typical business has better communication with it's customers.

Kbd lever spiders in the lair are single combat. The spiders North of the lesser demo area and ladder down to kbd are multi important distinction

I personally recommend saving Entrana for last so you don't have to re-bank. Other than that, you can really do whatever route you'd like.

I’d rather reduce the level requirement of the draynor village course. It’s incredibly easy for low levels to get there and if you don’t know how pandering to you won’t make the game better. Plus this way saves dev time for other stuff and will preserve the look of lumbridge.
---
No shit you dont know if it's going where it should what qualifications do you have for that??

What the fuck is the purpose of your comment? Are you suggesting they are laundering money? Or doing something shady with it??

If you are serious about this question you must not have played much when lens item was a thing. It actually made pvp cancer, you get a free +1 that you have no risk of losing. All you have to do is either have a friend lend you the item, or trade it to an alt and lend it to yourself.
---
Exactly why I rushed mine
---
2 respirators would speed it up
---
am
---
Lol we’re all just (obviously) joking,  are you genuinely trying to give 23 year olds advice on how to lose their virginity?
---
I don’t think the “knowing how” would be the problem.
---
Is that 180 days irl time, or 180 days time played in game?
---
Well that would make it literally impossible for Ironmen to do. Even with suicide food piles, 4 DWH + 5 Arclight is required
---
What?
---
6 years and you didn’t even have 99hp what a noob.
---
# good bot

This is as low effort as it gets, common man do better.

Except you replied to me when you weren't part of the conversation. Bye little man.
---
He stole it
---
Lol this title made your post seem like a scam. Maybe I'm to paranoid when i read a phrase like that. 
---
Anyways yeah they have had these up for a while now. Most of them do what you describes also. Must still have people fall for it since they're doing all that though..
---
if you think walking to tree gnome is a big grind you are insane. Leveling agility is way more of a grind.  Also what are stamina pots and teleports?
---
Lastly, even giving them the ability to level their agil will do little to nothing, like i said before, even at 50 agil your run energy restores at 1% every 4 seconds. This wont do nearly anything for new players
---
Definitely, and nah not really, by all means if it's not a problem (self esteem wise) then wait until you get a girlfriend/boyfriend whatever.
---
I just find it a bit annoying seeing people online like "I'm a virgin and no one wants me", not that anyone said that here, just that general vibe, like man don't complain about it online, go do something about it if it gets you down so much right?.
---
I'm also 23, I just want to help a brother out.

Make a new account at that point
---
Is that even English there at the end?
---
This picture was taking in my hometown in belgium, thats how we think about our vote system.
---
Well, I get it. You have to commit a lot of time to it, and because how busy I am, its not worth the money. Yes, I buy bonds whenever I know I can spend a couple of weeks on OSRS, and I mostly skill Slayer. Even then, I'm lvl 70 Slayer (if I remember correctly) so I dont even make a lot of money either. At this point, its casual play but its still an investment.
---
which world?
---
C
---
Yeah that was cool, but GE is too good.
---
Well, what did you say....
---
now that u mention it that makes much more sense
---
302, just south of Edgeville right now
---
You missed the point. He can now main his alt with the name Zezima but not have trolls always trying to login to his account.
---
Wow, I'm frankly surprised you got it back at all.
---
And screw over 4+ years of progress? No. I’ll ride out my bad rng in pure stubbornness.
---
I brought a cannon into edgeville wilderness thinking I was a genius.

Nice :)

Wyrm bones at someone else's gilded altar on the house party world (W330) will run you maybe 400k and take 15 minutes. 288 wyrm bones will get you from level 1 to 43, unlocking all overheads. Using the gilded altar it'll cost you a little under 400k to buy all the bones. You can also use the Wilderness altar to cut that cost in half, but you run the risk of being PK'd.
---
If you're just starting out then 400k sounds like a lot of money, but protection prayers are by far the single most important buyable unlock for basically any player. If that doesn't sound affordable for you right now, then honestly I wouldn't stress too much about trying to complete clue scrolls and would instead just progress through the early game however you want - train skills, do quests, etc, with one of your goals being the ability to afford buying 43 prayer.
---
Oh this brought back nostalgia from when I did this quest back in 2010, fuck quest, hated it then, hate it now.
---
You can have protection pretty much for free in 2-3 hours if youd like. Looting for cash then buying skele wyvern bones using the CC, then taking them to the wildy altar with burning ammy.
---
MEP2 really just suffers massively from:
---
A.) Making you have to constantly run around long distances just to check whether what you did was right or not.
---
B.) Having aggressive monsters constantly harass you the whole time, which means you can't really just stop and spend time to really analyze the puzzle to find the solution, which is annoying as all hell.
---
C.) Having an agility obstacle that has a ton of rolls for succeeding or failing on it, making it something you need to do at least twice, and each failure costs you multiple seconds to get back to it.

Should Jagex just link to reddit from their website for customer support?
---
I heard Mod Ash has it stored on a 1 gig flash drive somewhere. Hopefully we don’t get banned as well because we should NOT be speaking of this weapon.
---
We do it all the time. Multi-piling is meta for some quests/bosses
---
180 days of play time is over 4000 hours
---
I won't tell if you won't, we don't have enough up votes to get a response or be noticed
---
Is this loss?
---
how much is that in kg
---
Probably the rarest cape in the game
---
[oh no no no.....AHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA](https://i.imgur.com/tKFPDYC.png)
---
Jiggaflox is a disgrace for not having real customer support. I hope you get your account back if you’re innocent
---
Yeah but he's bad.
---
Haha too late. Stole ur method
---
The vast majority of irons i've met have gotten the full set (post update) so far under expected rate if it was 1/8 for any that i'm convinced it's bugged. I've not met anyone so far who has really come close to the old rate for rogues set.
---
... On ULTIMATE ironman, right?
---
The atrocious customer support makes the monthly membership a complete joke to be honest. It's insane that you have to take what should be a private matter between you and Jagex to a social platform where thousands of people can see and judge in order to get some kind of help.
---
Nearly 30M range xp, never been to zulrah. What am I missing here
---
Jagex could try making him log in with his email instead, this way spammers wouldn't just type Zezima to try and log in lol. They'd need to know his email.
---
I mean, even without the game officially creating the mode, you can still play this way with a group of friends. Just don't pick up other people's drops and only trade among each other.
---
correct, it's total playtime, not days since he created the account.
---
How does the edit change anything? The emote doesn't help in combat
---
except he doesnt play RS3 tho?
---
Oh God damn it that's just disgusting. Share I tanked p3
---
Its still a solid 2.5m an hr before supplies cost on my zerker.
---
99 HP and still using Konar.
---
P pots but also food.
---
Rune pouch but carrying 9 different types of runes with melee, and a tele tab.
---
Using fire runes instead of lava.
---
He's fighting a tanky monster with melee, he doesn't need a stamina potion. 
---
A slayer staff...really?
---
Oh you really got me. Not max ironman I put a few hours a week into. Shit, that really makes you less of an idiot, huh.
---
total play time.
---
Source: am roommate of OP
---
Didn't they already do this for someone else in the past? B0aty or a friend maybe
---
Lol, thankfully I did.
---
It's not too bad though, the run to the back entrance in the underground pass really isn't that far, especially if you fail a jump and fall down.
---
I smell a jmod smackdown, give me the goods that my $11 payed for pls
---
Someone like Zezima has maxed alts anyways. One of the guys in the top 10 hiscores, I forget who, runs 4 rune dragon alts and makes 4b/month off them. In case you weren’t aware by the time you can fight rune dragons you’re already almost quest caped and a maxed main. Pro RS players don’t see a problem with account building, why do you think all the comp caped people from RS3 play OSRS? Obviously it’s not the most ideal solution. The most ideal solution is for this toxic repulsive community to stop attempting logins on his account, the next best solution is if Jagex can change his login to an email, the third best solution is to transfer the name to another account with a different login. If you can’t see that then I don’t know what to tell you bud.
---
Sounds like you got caught and you're sour as fuck about it. They're obviously not going to show you how they found out that you were botting, you would work around it. 
---
&gt;maybe from my mouse hopping on the screen due to the touchscreen on my laptop? 
---
You're not the only one using a touch screen in 2k19, mobile is out bud, good attempt.

Good joke, Jagex
---
In response to everyone giving me crap about bonds. I did buy a few bonds along the way to pick up extra GP. I know it’s not the most respectable way to play, but that’s how I enjoy playing and I like that it goes to support Jagex. I hope everyone has a lovely day and will continue to play the way they want to play. :)
---
that's some poor print quality
---
? can't change your login name, it'll always be Zezima for him.
---
This is actually super impressive.
---
One McZuk please
---
 🤣
---
Oh and also, the first ban happened the day after my friend PMed me in game saying that I should "just bot my wcing lvl".  Which I shit you not the very next day I got a 2 day disable! Talk about conspiracy theories.
---
Seems ridiculous, I know. But that's why I've tried everything because I feel like ever since the first disable my account has been watched harder or something due to various dumb circumstances. 
---
My account was very very well rounded other than rcing and hunter. I was just starting to grind out wcing again so I could get some extra gp from yews and also trim my ranged cape. Such a disappointment to see all my hard work destroyed and swept under the rug like that. I got my first 99 EVER doing slayer with blowpipe.
---
Why would he main his alt though? He obviously wants to play his main, which has 5.4b xp.
---
Idk why I didn't think of it, ty for suggestion.
---
Her guides are fun but she always skips the traveling causing me to frequently pause her vids. Slayermusiq records everything so you can essentially just follow along. 
---
I do like how snuggle provides more insight on what the dialogue is about where slayermusiq just skips through and only tells you what options to pick.
---
what's the point of that? So let's say you're maxed in OSRS, you want to play that account, and suddenly you get this situation. Would you just startup again from tutorial island for a mistake of jagex? Lmfao.
---
It's probly better that he be banned if he's playing that much lol
---
LOL and now his roommate has a brand new reddit account defending him and vouching for him that he didnt cheat
---
Maybe tracy is his grandmother and she can join the convo
---
he actually doesn't have maxed alts, you clearly have no clue just shut the fuck up already fucking brainlet.
---
No? Zezima has an alt... it’s literally in the fucking OP picture. People like Zezima who are efficiency nerds have alts with 150-200m+ xp anyways. His alts are more like mains.
---
It's not his fault he's allergic to roses.
---
I recently started playing rs3 again, burthorpe is the starter area, there's a sample of every skill there and its horrendous, so much for exploring.
---
Doesn't F2P have energy potions? Maybe give them super strength and super energy to spice up questing and sweaty p2p.
---
You'd get drops of you got mvp /s

As a poor noob, I'm beyond satisfied with 2.3m, it just hurt to think I might have passed on so much more. Thanks for the info.
---
don't worry Borchert97 clearly has brain damage and has no clue about anything.
---
Figured this would be a typical response. Touch screens on a windows OS are not as common btw.
---
ahaha exactly this, he has like the worst 'solution' ever.
---
Its nice for learning bosses where u need switches, zulrah and raids for example.
---
Also good for Vorkath.
---
Void gives a 20% damage boost, in some situations like chinning, it's very good
---
brooo im dead😂
---
The risk v reward for killing pvmers seems really schewed, especially with the popular YouTubers doing this all the time and the "PvMer" having venge.  Then again I'm a coward so I wouldn't risk nearly that much.
---
It also gives an accuracy bonus, idk how it stacks up to traditional armour though
---
I made this meme.

Honestly not sure anymore. I feel like their "support" email changes everyday. I recovered through the website and then spammed emails when they'd tell me to "reset my password" and explain that i cant just reset my password when this person banned my account rofl.

Lmfao

I saw that too late, by the time I noticed, they had stopped. My bad.

Salve ei gives 20, which stacks with void for 30% damage and accuracy boost
---
yo how is sv so damn bad lmfao
---
Yeah you've got a point, that definitely needs to be addressed. Another reason a solo player doesn't stand a chance in pvp.
---
I liquidated pretty much all of my RS3 assets and used a service to swap it to OSRS.
---
This would be a great random event if those still existed, in line with the old axe handle flying off event.

I don't think there is anything else in the game that doesn't give xp. To introduce something like taht doesn't really make sense, tbh.

May I ask why people take both melee void and bandos/serp/ferocious to tob? Where is melee void better?
---
Yeah, I'm not saying it's the best art ever, but if you look at this guy's post history, he's only been getting better and better with time.
---
Sure his first pieces aren't going to be amazing, but I bet even Zuharr had drawn cringy stuff before he was good.
---
It's really just so I can see it easier cus sometimes it moves around when I bank lol
---
Okay my biggest complaint about the dark tournament (in my opinion even worse than Genkai coming back to life) is that despite being trained specifically to use the spirit wave, Yuske did not use it to avenge Genkai, instead just Spirit gunned dude like he would anyone else.

learning the inferno uses a lot of supplies, but individual inferno runs don't really use too much compared to the runes you go through doing barrage slayer anyways

I hate you 2000 dry and had an Abby dagger 1/32k a d med 1/8k and an elite clue 1/1.2k, good luck and bad luck at the same time
---
Lol yup. So funny when people try to do that with 4 or 5 dudes on them. Like bro are you really trying to make us believe you're fucking woox??
---
I think it depends man, I've been playing pretty hardcore, like 12 hours a day and in the last 20 days I've made just over 40m xp, granted that's being boosted by skills that have high xp rates but I think it would be realistic to say I could max in 180 days
---
Imagine being such a dick you vote based on what you think is best for the game, or that resources be spent in a direction you think is best/benefits you  ☝️

What is the rate? Like 1/50?

---
Yep cannon multi area, it was most enjoyable thing in game for me, relaxing to do. Exp varied by level but at 99 its 75k/hr or so depending on attention. Got just around 20k shamans killed so was pretty lucky on droprate
---
Thanks! Found it
---
@ OP
---
I couldn’t do it for the life of me. I literally thought I was retarded it took me over 150 attempts but I finally got it. When I finally got it down it’s because I approached the learning process in the wrong way. Look at it this way:
---
Just like everything in life, the step to learning is first learning what you’re doing wrong. 
---
Watch someone do it live and have them explain what they’re doing. Before you focus on killing it, focus on staying alive and WHY you’re staying alive. Not getting killed is 70% of Zulrah. 
---
The “why you’re alive” will consist entirely of your prayer, where you need to stand, and where it’s going next. Your prayer will be the first thing you learn.
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks for the tip! Found it :-)
---
one of my teachers liked to bring up a factoid about how much people are valued in terms of elements, minerals, etc. it's like next to nothing.

I suppose organs would realistically be worth quite a bit on some black market

When mining for coal for the Blast Furnace, is it faster/more efficient to Motherlode Mine with Full Prospector, or mine coal in the Mining Guild (+7 mining lvl bonus and halved rock respawn times) with the in with Varrock Armor (10% chance of mining two ores from a rock), Mining Gloves (40% chance the rock doesn't deplete when an ore is extracted), and a Coal Bag   to half my number of bank trips?
---
They're both somewhat AFK (or at least don't require much attention), which I like. XP/hr is a factor, but primarily I'm just trying to maximize coal/hr. I know blast mining is a better XP rate, but it requires more attention and only like 1/5 of the ores will be coal. I have 79 mining and am using a rune pick if that affects the math.

This is an extremely bold accusation, but I’m almost positive this account was outside of nmz with its prayers flicking on an off for an entire day.

Oof, gotta take that apology back now, bud. Just read the update about your outcome. You wanna shoot an apology my way for guilt tripping (and lying to) the entire /r/2007scape community?
---
I have to admit, it was a good try though. You were thorough in your efforts.

Yeah if you aren’t a complete twat who doesn’t understand basic account security.

What was the ban reason and what was the evidence provided?

This is great lol

Instant declines indicate no where near enough information or incorrect information given generally.

The vampyre attacks you when you're trying to use the farming patch.

123 combat gang is referring to the soft wall you hit when you've maxxed out your combat stats but still need to level prayer to get to 126. So many players hover around that level because they can't afford to train prayer higher due to needing buy gear. If you're an iron man you also have to spend forever farming bones at this level.

Sure but do you have to insult the employees when you do it? I don’t see how you’re any better than them when you insult them based on their salaries

i need this.

Stupidity is the only answer, it’s always because of something they directly or indirectly did, Jagex has never had any data leaks, so it comes down to not following basic internet security.

My original RS3 Account had its name changed to "sara merch " and they banned it for gold macro.

How obvious is it that it got hacked?

Gambling ruins lives and willingly advertising them as easy money isn't really moral.

Perfectly encapsulates the pkers being brainlets since they can't even follow simple instructions; the girl wasn't supposed to hit first

How did this botter get so many upvotes? His presentation was very low effort.

Sorry in advance for poor formatting, this is the lover of /r/arts_degree_huehue. She’s really nice and has me over for tea and crumpets occasionally. I can provide pictures of her in various positions to prove she’s real.

Maybe shoulda hid your username. Inb4 hacked

Didn’t you get over 2k upvotes on ur last post. Why did you repost this

And the last attempts of a failing counterargument is to disregard the entire essay your opponent wrote and tunnel on the last thing he said.

If you're comparing a single player rpg story vs an MMO's story, of course you're gonna get differences in quality. But compare RS stories to other MMOs and it blows them out of the water

a 650w pc with expensive electricity at 20 cent per kwh is roughly a dollar a day when on for all 24 hours. running a dozen bots for 24 hours could easily rake in over 50 dollars a day.

I've gotten a perm ban + proxy ban for macroing goldfarming back when I was 12 years old. Didn't know what that was. You can always get a "pardon" unban in half a decade like I did lmao

My cousin's account for banned. He came back after a year or two to try to play and typed in his info to find out he was banned wrongfully for macroing. He pretty much threw in the towel after looking on this sub and seeing that everybody flames people for being banned because they think it and end all be all when jamflex bans someone.

yah i got over 400 on my origional rs3 accts, pretty common tbh, most the comp/max people in my clan had 30o+ days playtime. im already up to 40+ days on all my osrs accts (multilogging)!!
---
 yay, heres to getting 400 days playtime on osrs!!!!
---
shit bot
---
Boy people don't like the things you say for some reason...
---
Some people actually get false bans for botting tho. It's not common but it does happen, mainly when they play I'd say more than 5 accounts at once. My buddy has been chain banned on 10 accounts 3 or 4 times now and been unbanned after months because he wasnt botting, they just say sorry.
---
Bookmarked this to watch this later perhaps you can answer a question for me now, how do you avoid burnout? Ive done all the bankstandkng skills but stuff like agi/mining/wc i cant do for more than 30 mins

I think Construction was always intended to be a money sink.

Might take a few tries but there are some good people in the game who will have the patience to work with you and help you understand the game. Just gotta find the right team!

You can tele out for all of the MM2 boss fights. As far as I know Making friends with My Arm is the only one you can't TP out of.

Oooh jmod smackdown on the way

when the xp per rune goes up .5 xp each one, it is objectively bad design.

Hey man let him rock it. I recently got my Sara and loved taking her out on Slayer runs. I only swapped to it for specials and used a hasta for damage but that's just cuz I'm a skiller and can afford to funnel my funds into combat.

I'm that guy that's been using the whip for years and just finally did MM like a month ago. Went straight to 70 on experiments 2 years back. Honestly kinda funny now because how easy the quest is in retrospect.

I'm just scared because it has been proven that jagex has falsely banned players that did not Bot!

 After thousands of hours, I would be devastated to lose my accts.

It’s honestly impressive they have a player base this big on a game that really came out in what 2000 (?) and hasn’t had a major graphical update in 12 years, while being one of the grindiest, no definitely the grindiest game most of us have ever played
---
Taking a tiny break from it rn, will do some cooking later

Seriously. Everyone thinks that because they pay $11 a month to Jagex that they must be qualified to run the company.

This makes sense. I am working on Agility and I found it frustrating to travel ALL the way to Gnome Stronghold without teleports and 1 Agility. Because I am a veteran player, I knew this method, but let me tell my Agility training story once I got my first membership in 2006.
---
I was curious 11 old newbie who wanted to try out new skills. I wasn't sure how Agility worked, so I went to the closest Agility course what I knew on 1 Agility. What was it...?
---
Brimhaven Agility Dungeon.
---
Guess how many hours I spent there getting 30 Agility so I could move to the next course which I THOUGHT was a good idea?
---
Many freaking hours, running back and forth between the dungeon and Tzhaars for restocking with swordfishes and lobsters while spending thousands and thousands gold for every entry fee back to the dungeon. I was lucky that SOMETIMES I actually got the ticket which DID become possible once I got 20 Agility.
---
After finally I got 30 Agility, I moved to the next course on the level up list: Agility Pyramid.
---
By that time I knew the desert and its mechanics, so I prepared myself with desert clothing, plenty of full waterskins and some food. Then I journeyed there by magic carpets and got started. But ooooh boy, what was my training...
---
I don't even recall reaching to the top because I was stuck on 1-3 floors due of failing all the time. My "training" was more like trial and error will I success at the obstacle or not. I don't remember how long I tore my hair off or how many times I restocked myself at Nardah, but I grew tired of that damn course at that level. I don't even remember how many levels I got there, if none due of never reaching to the top for lap bonus.
---
Later I became more intelligent about Agility training methods, so I trained it at Barbarian Agility Course -&gt; Wilderness -&gt; Ape Atoll. I got my Agility to 70 for God Wars Dungeon and it left there for very very long time. Maybe I grew tired to deal training it so poorly, but nowadays I see it way better, all thanks to the rooftop courses and my special &amp; huge Agility project.
---
So, that's a little story about my Agility training. I gladly support Lumbridge rooftops for 1-10 Agility so new beginners doesn't have to go same shit as I did back in the day.

I’ve had my Rs account for 10 years + I would constantly log on... walk around and say it’s changed too much, I had no idea old school was a thing till it came out on the App Store I was so far removed. But about a year ago, I logged on like I did ever few months to give the game a shot and my account had been banned. I was able to get my account back after a few requests, but it was scary, i know it’s sad to say but that account is part of me and I’m happy i was able to get it back. In all the google searches I did, a lot of people automatically assume you bottled and I get that, but if you are telling the truth, I hope you get your account back.
---
I feel like you’re the guy who rolls round in full dragon armour, with an obby cape and a combat bracelet..
---
If you were to do any more I'd recommend bringing a dragon warhammer, I get ~6-7 more kills per hour when I bring one.
---
Do you need gambling? No. Do you need cigarettes? No. Do you need alcohol? No. 
---
Is it really the addict to blame? Addiction is a mental illness. You don't smoke while saying "Oh yeah, this seems like a great thing to get addicted to". Drugs/gambling are taken as a escape of reality, and that's also why the ones that supply them take advantage of people in poverty. In my country, most betting houses open up in the most poor neighborhoods. They take advantage of the poor with the promise of easy money. Hell, they even opened a betting house just in front of a gambling rehab centre. They try to get underage people to waste their money. And that's why I'll never have respect for any gambling house, or anyone who remotely supports them. They're just wolves that hunt for your money, regardless of your mental health.
---
And yeah, I'm also not really happy with alcohol/cigs being legal, since they're only proven to be harmful.
---
Also, just because someone expresses an opinion that is contrary to yours doesn't mean he's trying to be a smart arse.
---
I wouldn't do Revs for money. Nowadays there's probably double or triple the amount of Pkers than Pvmers
---
Zulrah. You're guaranteed the money.  Revs youll spend more time hopping running and dying when all that time you can have consistant gp.
---
Welcome to reddit

I dont believe him, 18k is the number b0aty threw out as an estimate for how much time he's played runescape across all accounts.

no it isnt but its also a mostly single player rpg not an mmo
---
Get rid of pking (not pvp) implement a system where you have to "accept" a duel
---
Nope
---
there is already enough content for pvpers, dmm, pvp worlds, wildy worlds, bounty worlds, wildy slayer, wildy bosses/demi bosses, rev caves... for a relatively small area of the hame the wilderness has a fair bit of content imo 🤷‍♂️
---
Not to mention that he won’t get any content. If he streams it he’ll just get spammed with meme trades and millions of gp that just ruin it for people starting.
---
I have a max cape, the rest is accurate
---
 **D**
---
What was your ban reason?
---
It was, and I have no problem spending millions on a nice aesthetically pleasing house, but having to remove 5 portal rooms made from marble,to replace it with 1 room, which came out in a new update, without any form of compensation seems a bit unfair.
---
u/ABUSlVE lol you're free
---
Now show us your dagannoth king drop log.
---
It's pretty good money tho, 5.23M from Animated Rune Armour, I'd camp it if you need cash
---
hard disagree, the entire pvp scene is cancer to new pkers and pvmers alike. Its hard to learn when your experience in the wildy is people constantly just farcasting into a ags gmaul spec then fucking off, and as Pvmers its particularly annoying because we cant geath for both the boss fights and pking. So we are pretty much sitting ducks most of the time, and when a pker does get us all we hear is racial slurs and general trash talk. This situation is by definition not "fine"
---
TACHYON

Don't you see a difference between those 1000-2000 hours and 18,000?

gaming is one big role play
---
Completely up to you on whether you want to go straight into P2P or not; same with HC.  Obviously there’s a lot of started xp to be had with members quests. I love Ironman mode and started F2P (with no intention to ever get members) until all quests complete.  If I did it today tho I’d probably go straight to members.
---
Just change it to Broomstick and have the option be Fly-on

This is them making the best out of the game while making money off it.

I mean exactly what I said, it was possible to profit from skilling and it wasn't a measly few 100k/hr, making pots or selling enchanted bolts was easy money and XP, was PvM still better absolutely. Yes most people wanted the g/e obviously, it was voted in, doesn't mean everyone did.
---
it drops the armor he uses for them. no gain
---
So annoying... several patches and it still happens on my android tablet, at least on IPhone I can save the credentials with my fingerprint and easily enter it. Wish they could fix this faster.

Honestly about to neck.

U got 5,3 mil just from animated armour? How ?

Thats the joke

I’m not quite up there yet but I can absolutely admire and appreciate that

O.o

Is there any risk to this? I use a vpn whenever I’m on my laptop.

Same , almost 2k with less than 2 active friends IGN: Thugist
---
I love RuneScape and always have.  But let's be real. They are paying their developers pennies compared to most companies, so what do you think they are spending on customer support reps?
---
To be faaaaiiir
---
Yeah until you dont know how to setup vpns, or go about transfering it in a dumb way. You'll get permed as a gold farmer and your ip will be fucked, any little slip up and ur fucked. Even subject to false bans.
---
Oh look its all my clues
---
Using rune and it drops it every time so it just adds it to the total gp, you don't really get any money out of animated armours. When you kill it you get your armor you used back.
---
It’s more time consuming than I thought it would be. Skilling Slayer takes so long but was going to be my primary source of income for the game. I never got past those 5 levels so I can start making serious bank AND THEN I would be working towards better items.
---
Is there a comment telling him to quit and never come back? Because he is the worst thing to ever happen to video games. That's including micro transactions and dlc packs to give you the rest of the game.
---
I've just completed MM2, now i plan to solely focus on slayer and pvm for a little bit.  Im sitting at 76/84/75 and 83 range.  Is there a minimum level i should be aiming for before attempting these on task?  
---
I dont want to be getting it handed to me or getting very little kills per trip.  I'd appreciate some feedback from people  with similar levels to myself so i know where i stand.
---
I mean if you're a main account it's not really worth mining coal - more efficient to buy it off the ge. If you're an ironman I'd recommend asking this question in r/ironscape as I'm sure they'll be able to give you better advice on this subject.

I mean, this community is one of the best in online games. Have you ever played cs or league? I actually had to quit these games just because I was tired of people talking shit literally every game, saying racial slurs and stupid shit, no matter what rank I was. Got to LEM before I just had enough, this community is a fucking godsend in comparison. Maybe wintertodt and pk'ing are kinda bad but again, nothing in comparison to those two games and many more.

You see this with a lot of weird training. If you are botting a shit training method for 100 hours you are less likely to get caught then if you botted a solid training method for 10. He won't get banned unless he is still clicking.
---
Get to where pures can't attack you. I'm 118cb and i love when a pure team rolls through and clears the whole area for me. Max mains are less common in my experience and I can tank a few zerks

Cool, thanks for the info!
---
You asked for opinions, I gave mine. Clans like the one I’m in ideally would be the people you’d want to hop into pvp as it adds a larger base to it. Don’t be so salty next time bud, a lot of pvm players stay away from toxic pvp players like you lol

I've noticed that happening before when that post was around, but after a while it never happened to me again. Maybe they quietly fixed it? It really never happened to me again like 2 weeks after seeing the post. Thanks for the heads up though!

It's not a macro...

---
We are already here tho
---
There's a JMod tweet about it that exists somewhere, but IIRC you still roll the clue table as normal, but you just don't get a clue if you would have rolled one you already have. So your easy clue rate would remain unaffected.
---
&gt;It's not a macro...
---
lmao okay
---
That makes sense... and it doesn't surprise me people made up or misled re: bloodvelds being aggro in the catacombs.
---
In 2006 I begged my parents to buy me a "book" on how to become a runescape millionaire from Ebay.
---
When it arrived weeks later, it wasn't a book, it was just a stack of A4 paper that wasn't even bound together.
---
One of the methods for getting rich included picking bananas from Karjama and selling them to vendors.
---
Big grats. Did you feel like the SGS was an absolutely necessity with that gear? I want to attempt it on my 60 attack med, but don't have the gp for a T Bow.
---
Nah bloodvelds were never aggressive. To afk them you gotta find an open world, protect melee, hit all the bloodvelds once and let auto retaliate continue fighting for you while you watch porn on your other monitor
---

You can semi afk them, I just left another comment explaining how

Twitch prime a 30 day and then buy one more month. If you grind decent for 2 months you can self sustain with bonds by then. Private servers will be out dated and have low player base. I personally am not a neck bearded virgin like most these redditors so I wont judge you for going p server route. But content is updated and player base is real on the main servers.
---
totally not cheating

I've only been playing again for like 3 weeks and most of my skills are around 50, so that surely means I'll max out my account with only 6-7 weeks played :)

RIP, I got my account of 15 years banned recently too with no way to appeal. Jagex going out sad when they’re punishing long term players but they’re allowing whoever the fuck to create new accounts and bot in members worlds. At least our accounts are in the void together.

Make it a goal to get barrows gloves and all medium diaries completed.
---
  
---
Work on slayer and focus on getting range up quite a bit. Range is very important for content; zulrah, vorkath, jad to name a few.
---
Quest a bunch and do slayer. I'd also recommend getting in the habit of doing herb runs after you have the level for ranarrs.
---
Most bosses are considered early late game content. You're probably still in the early game based off of your skills and I'm assuming you barely have any quests and diaries finished.
---
simply epic, thanks for the meme 2014
---
Dude 10 mins in an he's upvoted by 4 points, chill out and let the upvote system do it's work. If the comment didn't deserve the downvotes they'll go away. Just like they did here.
---
1 or 2 ppl downvoting right away is a normal occurrence. Inbox downvotes are very real. They even out within a few mins usually. 
---
If I ever see a comment downvoted for no reason I always upvote it back up
---
Stick with magics and dragonfruit, add in mahogany and calquat
---
calquats, celastrus, redwoods, spirit trees, mahogs, hespori and maybe torstols if u care to spend the time on them
---
I only see 5 upvotes?
---
How was I being condescending?
---
Which I'm totally against. Did they listen after dozens of posts? Nope. They then try and clean their name with mental health care events, while keeping the duel arena in the game, which course a lot of players to be gambling addicts.
---
Then again, the players defend that shit, so it won't be removed. The same players that leave the game and come back just to gamble again, loose it all, and start over again in a never ending cycle, that will translate later in real life gambling. Not to mention you can pay real money for in game money, not only giving them the chance to use real money to gamble, but also giving thqñat gold a value in real cash.

Get rid of fire max cape. It's time

Probably just wants the rare drops and isn't getting any. Idk.
---
Calquats, celastrus, and fruit trees every day. Normal trees once or twice daily depending on how much you play. Mahoganies are good but that's every 4 days, redwood once you can plant it are 4-5 days too. Spirit trees would be good if you have a surplus of seeds, the items for protection aren't too bad as well.
---
That's roughly 225k xp daily for one run, add in more for a second tree run or any extra crops
---
"guys I never did anything fishy, I swear guys" It's the same shit every time. 
---
Say what you want about Jagex and their fuck-ups but you don't just ban a almost maxed account without giving it a second thought. 
---
Feels unreal to me that we keep seeing these post racking up gold and 10k+ upvotes ending with the retard making the post gets whacked by a j-mod.

Fair enough but the whole two fresh Reddit account thing just doesn't add up. I'd also think if they've got some kind of problem they've discovered they'd go back and flag similar cases. If that's not possible, his appeal he said that he put in should've been accepted.

Then I went to a furnace, looked for the highest lvl guys, checked hiscores to see if they were 88+ smithing. Asked one if he could please make me full addy from my ores. He said yeah, took my ores, tele'd out and blocked me. Just plain griefing noobs.
---
Petscape
---
Lol sure let me get you my username..
---
I'd say definitely not.  Remember the tbow spawn?
---
Pretty sure there's jad plugins and zulrah ones that show you where to click and when, as well as vorkath, since afaik there's no way to keep the indicators you see stationary when you move your character in the world, unless I'm missing like 90% of that feature
---
Don’t play dumb here. His challenge defiantly has merit, but would be on a totally different level if he was truly f2p (im talking him as a player not his specific accounts). Whether you call it directly or indirectly, he spent his money and used/sold member items to achieve this goal. And before you say it again, yes, he did it on a f2p account that has never been members, but did he use p2p accounts that are members to achieve this goal, yes he did. Many players play on multiple accounts to and use those accounts to benefit the whole.
---
Oh damn, that's nifty!
---
Yeah like the other guy said there’s some way in runelite to make it not stretched when it goes full screen.
---
No, you are missing the point.
---
Aww I actually liked Ridiculous 6. =(
---
Cg, now jagex should delete fire cape from game
---
Asking the real questions
---
It was 100% all for pet but after awhile I accepted it and just enjoyed making bank
---
Best of luck amigo!
---
Fam, u can conquer the inferno in that gear, but not Zulrah.
---
Nice, keep doing ablum covers. Wanna see more
---
Please end it for me x D
---
He was being sarcastic not condescending.
---
sir, this is taco johns, please order something or leave.

Saving for future self
---
What worries me the most is the fact that my net is hella unstable so flicking for long periods at a time isn't really an option. And as far as I know this isn't possible without flicking. :/
---
Use bones on the chaos altar in wilderness. It essentially gives 7x xp per bone compared to burying
---
Monsters have a limited range in which they can wander. For example you can’t hit a chicken in lumbridge and lure it all the way to Camelot. It will return to its designated area
---
No pls, I don’t want to be an area locked uim
---
you kinda set yourself up for “learn how to take a screenshot” jokes
---
Ahhh there’s the other brother who can’t find one on this game either, thought I was all alone
---
Well that solves it then
---
You are basically asking yourself to get hacked ASAP.
---
&gt;And as far as I know this isn't possible without flicking. :/
---
Thats because you're listening to noobs justifying why they still have a fire cape.
---
If you attack a monster from outside it’s wander range it will backpaddle away.
---
If your fighting a noob or if they’re in rags then sure you could do okay.
---
The fact is if they have access to much higher range/mage dps armour. If they are halfway decent you will lose, or unless you get a Rambo ags maul.
---
I still stand by what I said. At around 97-98 combat meds start getting the advantage in edge and deeper wildy. That doesn’t mean you can’t pkay on a zerker after but you are fighting at a small disadvantage. Something like 55-45 in the opponents favor if they’re built properly.
---
This is coming from someone who almost has a max med and a near max zerker.
---
I think if you dislike someone so much, you've already given them more of your time than you ever should have.
---
Ok
---
You're not entirely won't though, they could potentially get enough info from their Reddit name it it's used multiple places etc etc
---
English is a notoriously difficult language
---
Are zulrah and vorkath more or less click intensive than demonic gorillas?
---
Give more information than just your email then dork.
---
Slayer! It will help you train your stats. And higher level slayer monsters are good money
---
When it comes to nerfing pvp stuff.. Jagex doesn't take long to act.
---
They got rid of spec swapping, added coin sink to untradables to repair them and a whole slew of changes.
---
I'm not anti-pvp. But i am in favor of a fair pvp environment.
---
Yeah, since the quest runs on Android it's just a matter of sideloading the app onto it and loading it up.
---
13 games of wt what's that like 20m fm xp
---
Except he gave u the expired milk
---
Wow i wasn’t aware how many 9 year olds play this game.  Pdp is human garbage
---
such a boring video tbh.
---
You could just google "zulrah guide" and find way better things though...
---
i’m kidding my guy, yeah it’s a good idea to sell and rebuild, i did the same and sara/zammy/hydra/raids/zulrah are all good starting points! you won’t regret it.
---
There was only one instance of that happening you fucking downie
---
This calls for dragon rake to be added as well which I am 100% in support of.
---
Me:
---
*real human anger* 
---
What I say: ayee nice that’s sick Gzzz dude
---
If you like CS, switch to faceit, way less toxic people , if it wasn't fot faceit i wouldve quit too, but the osrs community is indeed way less toxic
---
Sure but non-displayed orders don't contribute to the nbbo and aren't protected, so most orders at lit exchanges are normal visible orders.
---
From what I’ve seen void after (91?) range is better than blessed dhide.
---
I don't give a shit about that dude
---
B gloves leave the dragon boots behind.  I could bring BGS but I was told arclight is better spec
---
I'm not even gunna get involved this time boys sorry to disappoint.
---
Too many normies likes other things

Ooo thank you sir. This really helps

When someone gets inferno cape, one random player should get their fire max Cape permanently removed.
---
bro at least put the nsfw flair on, my virgin eyes
---
Wtf all I want is an explanation of what led to them banning me, is that really so hard? Apparently it is haha
---
save your totems and do it on task. don't forget to use both arclight specs at the start, and use chivalry since you aren't 70 prayer yet
---
Is that trident the same as the Trident of the Swamp? Wiki directs me to that.
---
Im not gunna link anything, but dont google it. Just type this into search bar
---
Runelite . Net
---
Yikes
---
pk sets
---
Bp is better than dcb, and yeah at 95 regular void is probably still better than blessed dhide but it’s not a big deal if you’re just doing 50 kills for a head
---
Appreciate the advice. Admittedly I'm not very PVM experienced and not great at prayer flicking, so it could certainly help. I think I'll grab a couple more fire capes, trying to pray flick in the cave, before I get anything else.
---
Yeah I’m like shit, I could afford it but I don’t have the hours in the day to actually train my account lol
---
Tbh I wanna see your skills. Having the berserker necklace and it being enchanted is fairly impressive for iron man and 1 year. Unless you play a fair amount.
---
Lol what?
---
no  one does
---
Never realized how good of a beat the wc sound is I approve
---

Finally finished. No rangers for me.
---
Honestly, getting lost in the f2p is one of the things i miss most. Now i know the entire map like the back of my hand... enjoy it while u can man. Many of us old players are jealous of u new guys because you get the truely enjoy the game where as we have to be efficient and grind our dicks off cause we understand too much about the game.
---
I have a fury, regen brace, and ring of stone as well, I posted my stats on my twitter @yungsos3  but im 1720 total atm

You know when he gets that rune med drop he'll be more excited than any of us were playing this game.

Not to shabby. Good job.

I’ve been posting about my false ban and it always gets caught in the spam filter of this subreddit. The mods used to help me when I msged them about fixing my post but they just ghost me now and I don’t even try to make a post about my account anymore.
---
I'm a fairly new returnee to OSRS, and while I know that voiders are the most toxic people in all existence, I have no idea why they are this way. Does all of those hours playing Pest Control really make you go mad?
---
ty man :)
---
nice bot
---
I miss making the run through the wilderness dodging pkers the whole way there. Sure you were going have bad time but thats what made clan wars worth it. I think anyways
---
Search for "Disable Hardware Acceleration RuneLite" and follow the wiki on our GitHub.
---
I can't post link to it because GitHub links are still for some reason filtered on this subreddit.
---
 Bad music, and no one really likes to watch f2p vids, i stopped at 31 seconds, and this shit is like, shorter then hell.
---
Farming... its a good skill smh
---
Dodgy necklaces only work during pickpocketing, not blackjacking
---
That being said they're still worth wearing since you should be using the pickpocket option when your blackjack is in the air, and if you fail to knock out the thug then you'll go for a regular pickpocket instead
---
this is half the reason I like one small favour. the dialogue is most the fun of the quest
---
You do realise that buying a bond still costs real money for the person who sold it?
---
Kinda hard when you guys use d spears and 20 ags specs ;)
---
I'm not trying to be rude but 10 seconds is awhile , try doing vertical zigzag down two columns then do the other side. It's basically the same as how u should clean grimy herbs (if you were to do thousands of them)
---
You need to disable hardware acceleration by passing this argument to the launcher: --=mode=OFF
---
If you’re not sure how to do that there’s an explanation on their wiki, but I can’t link it here because of automod.
---
this dude didnt post a one chunk more video for a couple of months and then drops a disney song..
---
unbelievable

i made twitter just for this
---
Then what does he do if he does all this and money is still tight?

If you genuinely think he is a Nazi you clearly have no idea what you are talking about and your opinions on the subject are irrelevant.

As if people don’t create their own Jad plug ins and use them. Lmao.

Buy a t7 emblem from any one of numerous clan chats, always go through a middleman or trade with a ranked member of the clan. Bhandchill and emblem area are both reputable

Oh, I've been playing since hunter was released. I was just making a suggestion because of the Dev Blog a few weeks ago where the Devs said that the biggest challenge for new players was getting around the map.
---
You’re definitely right.  And for the most part my friend follows that.  Doesn’t drink, doesn’t like coffee or anything fancy like that.  He does drink though.  He just works at a shit job with poor pay and has to support his kid.
---
It’s like allowing a bottling software to exist but with no bot coding and Jagex saying “hey don’t use this pretty please”
---
No, it doesn’t. The fire max cape weighs significantly less than the fire cape. Same with the Ava’s max capes. The ardy max cape weighs more than the ardy cloak. They are NOT cosmetic in any way.
---
this gonna get nuked but ill upvote you, fam
---
Orange man bad.
---
it's the culmination of being let down a hundred times over
---
I like your name!
---
Is the area single combat? If so then if any thing attacks you cannon will only fire at that thing, but so long as nothing touches you cannon will fire at everything.
---
Doesnt matter cosmetic or not
---
Lol, yeah:)
---
I love this
---
Lolol, did I hurt your feelings?

You can’t even get dragonstone rings from bird nests which is crazy in my opinion.

Les Mis ain't no disney shit dog, put some respek on my man Claude-Michel Schönberg's name.

I very much doubt this without any form of proof

I put that there because there would probably be some sort of "process" that would unlock it, judging by past content. I think it should just work right away, though. I knew people would ask, so I wanted to have some sort of example in place.
---
You realize none of use care and that you actually look like the dumber person by trying to start a witch hunt on reddit.... Pathetic Xd

---
something something rookie numbers
---
Dude....are all your tabs like this?
---
So right back to my original comment of it's just assholes trying to ruin the game. 
---
Cool. Full circle.
---
 Pretty sure BGS is technically a lot more consistent.
---
Average hit on spec is something like 35, and it's coming off of a double accuracy hit.
---
DWH is going to be a 60 and 42 defence reduction, but accuracy is massively reduced.
---
Vorkath is slightly higher defence and BGS is still technically better for consistency, which is a **lot** more important for skotizo where its instanced so you only get 2 specs.
---
U do know this is 100% fake right?
---
Abusive? More like abused
---
Trying to click the comments on mobile was very confusing
---
15.6s to throw back a full invent (26 fish)

the idea of a one-time fee is beyond stupid though, remove that

Yes I do. ^^That comment right there
---
Nah I’ve seen a few in my time...
---
Drown him in his fish tank
---
This mumblerap mixtape is dope as fuck yo.
---
I feel that verse where he goes cuseoaoejdnclaldkfjakalaoekd so much man, this is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥👌👌🙌🙌.
---
&gt; the idea of a one-time fee is beyond stupid though, remove that
---
I agree, which is why I wanted to be able to drown him instead. Unlocking essential stuff is dumb, but people always ALWAYS ask what the unlock requirements were, so I just pooped one out that somewhat seemed fitting. No requirements at all, please!
---
Hopefully. Appeal submitted yesterday. Stupidly used my email and an old password that was probably a combo from some database. Fucked up with no authenticator. Feel like a retard but hopefully I at least get the account back even if all my items/gold are gone.
---
Oi, I heard you like ice barrier lich x but plus life drain
---
That sounds like addiction. If you’re not already seeing a therapist, it might be a good idea to get in touch with one. They’ll probably be much more helpful than anonymous message board replies

What comment? I didn't get muted for language when I got Pmuted. Obviously, you do not know.
---
Just get a job for an hour LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
How everyone else get so much head??? I have 3 heads with maybe 600kc and one of those is the quarantined drop
---
I have a couple of problems with this analogy. First, why wouldn't we let kids with a broken ankle play soccer if we could somehow do that? Second, unlike actual exercise, exposure to repetitive strain is something that is never good for anybody in anyway, unlike playing sports.
---
It's not more xp/h, it's more xp per DAY because you get to spend more of the day training farming. In terms of actual xp/hr tithe farm sucks ass compared to planting trees
---
Do you not do quests as an additional challenge or do you just hate em?
---
Not sure, I think pot up son made one once.
---
Shouldn't the new elves' design be similar to the old ones to keep in line with the "oldschool" feel and not the other way around?
---
Both tbh, i grew to love the challenge
---
It just so happens gaining more xp per day works out to more xp per hour
---
It seems like it fires at like 4-6 enemies then just focuses on one even if none of them move out of the spot where it fired on them. Is it randomly engaging enemies on me with some kind of weird delay? It also randomly goes back to shooting several enemies at completely random intervals.
---
I just hit 99 Fishing yesterday with very little Barbarian fishing (maybe like 300k xp in total). I definitely would have done more if they had added something like this, it would save the wrists of future generations of Run Escapers.
---
That is incredibly slow.
---
I'm lucky enough to be easily able to pay membership but I understand that a great many cannot
---
90k xp/hr isnt that bad lol
---
It is morbid but my take on jokes about serious topics is that there's nothing too serious for a joke because serious topics are where we could use the laughter the most
---
NICE. I mean he recently just made a post were he was a dick to everyone who commented and then told me to choke on my inhaler. Guess im the dick. Fair enough I can see those numbers adding up.
---
Tell me how you're getting someone with a broken ankle to play soccer without it being blind kid playing football style. Also if you have a broken ankle and you stand on it to play a foot intensive sport, you are exposing yourself to repetitive strain.
---
This feels like a 25 buttholes video lmaooo
---
I think adding in new transport is better for the integrity of the game. Once players get the mage level for teleports they dont need to use the new system all that much unless they dont have the law runes. Overall I think it would make the new player experience a lot more smooth.
---
some nice kappa streetwear pants
---
Arclight would only be better if you’re tanking his melee, which is inadvisable. Arclight lowers his defense, str, and att by 10% per hit, additive, so at most you’re lowering his def by 40, str by 50, and att by 48. Since you’re not tanking his melee, the last two don’t matter, so all you have to do is hit higher than a 40 with two bgs specs. With your setup you should have a max spec of 56 if you use chivalry, or 49 if you don’t. Either way, you’re looking at a pretty good chance to lower skotizo’s def by more than 40, so bgs is better.
---
why would u mark vorkath? its not like he's gonna go anywhere lmao
---
Quick, someone repost the 'take your time swampletics' spongebob meme
---
Incredible!!! He should make more
---
thanks my guy :) i try to figure it out
---
If you really have to you can always wait for some special attacks, it can also bring you past your max prayer which can be done b4 going into the cave
---
Kind if line an angler for prayer. I like to use ancient mace on max hit dummy in my house to get to like 130 prayer before going to a boss.

---
No you fucking retard.
---
If you spend 30 mins on a tree + fruit tree run you get 1m xp/hr up to 2m xp/hr. If you do that then spend 10 hrs at tithe farm you've got ((1m *.5) + (90k * 10))/10.5 = 133333.333 repeating xp/hr. Unless you're in some kind of rush, just plant fruit trees + trees and go do other shit like slayer and you'll get your farming up sooner rather than later.
---
Isn't that gear setup a lot closer to 300m than 150m? Grats though
---
People who try to take the moral high ground and insult others for not being as holy as them are human garbage
---
Those puddle whales are even worse. Once saw a noob get sucked right in. He died so hard that his account got banned.
---
Fruit trees + trees = 1m xp/hr up to 2m at higher levels
---
And what did it cost?
---
Mate, I put an arrow “^” showing you what comment I was referring to. I can’t make it any more simpler for you
---
Well I probs is hard because they don't do that, atleast hundreds of accs banned daily, why they should prioritize your acc? Because of upvotes?
---
"And after?"
---
"Idk. Plant some of that nice herbs, and yannille hops."
---
easily the best RNG I've ever gotten in my 12+ yrs of playing off and on. decided to finally try wintertodt last night, and when i opened my tenth crate i was like "wtf, i only got 7 lobsters?" then saw untradeable drop: phoenix and thought "nah that's not mine." safe to say i was pretty stunned when i received my first pet
---
Looking at the players age for botting offences is not, and has never been a thing.
---
Regarding scammers, it doesn't matter. With no fixed exchange prices would fluctuate wildly - and that's the beauty of it.
---
Vv true, i'd just hate to ruin his fun is all, and i don't need it.
---
Yeah, you also don't need to be efficient all of the time. It's why I'd vote no cause I don't really like the idea of changing how the game is because people hurt themselves playing a game cause of this weird desire for max exp/hr in every facet of the game.

A t10 is enough for like 4 rune pouches. Unless you pk and risk them it wont be worth buying that. The slayer points for rune pouch are way too expensive for how long they take. Buy a t7 from a cc like emblem area
---
At first I was struggling at those waves as well, try to position yourself ready to handle the melee when he digs, this often means that you have to flick the ranger/mager to get a good position. Also, 1 tick flick the blobs. If you can get the ranger/mager to hit only 1 tick apart, you can actually take 0 damage when 1 tick flicking with the blobs on you as well.
---
Dude, it's over. Crabs are getting stale
---
I have 75 att, with 45 defense and 65 prayer, which puts put at 100 cb for elite void. I can pvm at any boss I want, use any weapon I want, edge ok and deep wild pk fine. 75/99/70 puts you at like 110 cb, and at that point you might as well just become a main, if you want a med level you shouldn’t go past 60 attack
---
Just because you're enjoying it doesn't make it healthy bro. Please stop.
---
I like it but it should be incorporated into a new skill: Conservation. Gain xp by releasing fish and hunter animals or by PKing anyone who's recently gained woodcutting, fishing, or hunter xp
---
Make it so ironman mode is disabled on a non-ge world.
---
I want this so I can catch a shrimps, keep it in my inventory for six months, then release it and watch it swim away only so I can complain about emersion.
---
There wouldn't be enough people to trade with this time around. That aspect of the game and the culture around it is unfortunately gone. Ironman is a good alternative though, you still need to achieve your own goals without the GE. The only difference is instead of paying 40k like back in the day for your Rune Scimmy, you have to go kill Fire Giants for it. It's still rewarding in thst aspect, but we'll never get the trade culture again.
---
I'm done replying to you because you just can't seem to wrap your head around what I'm trying to do. Try re-reading the thread, idk.
---
Then you just want your own personal world?

Why you guys got time to talk shit while fighting? Isn't PVP all about prayer flicking and shit? Easiest way to shit talk is by winning and never saying a goddamn word. Then they know they weren't even on your radar.

1 platinum token each and it has to be in your inventory

Ahhh. Wow.  That's embarrassing on my part.  I had no idea they were two different sets.

Thanks for the help.
---
MEP2 is arguably easier without a guide than MEP1. MEP2's puzzle can go two ways for people, you can either figure it out on the first try or become a brainlet and just be really slow with the puzzle.
---
The hardest part of the quest isn't really the light puzzle but more with inventory management with food, stam pots and prayer pots. Oh, and you can't forget the damned wall ledge. I also never wish anyone the disaster that is not talking to the dwarf (to unlock the alternate route through Underground Pass so Ironmen can go back and get the items for the dwarf) cause if you mess up and lock yourself out then gg.  
---
Actually never mind this quest is aids and no wonder it took me a little under 7 hours to complete it without guides. I think a OSRS streamer named Jillyfish recently completed it without guides in like 14 hours.
---
Sit where u belong
---
No, jagex paid the mods to remove it. It got to r/all so have to minimize the dmg to their already shitty brand
---
I was just giving a random example. 
---
They'd try to find bot activity. Things that seemed bot-like would be banned.
---
I imagine they're from main clanners since it's better range def than rune for the same price(ish?)
---
This comment aged real well

Make it similar xp to the nature altar bridge.

You realize you aren’t supposed to say F when someone actually dies irl, right?

Oh i didnt know you could get it anywhere other than G.E or the monkey boiz

Yeah I had heard bgs plus bp is most dps, but the banking makes dhcb better.

I think I've seen this porn before

This is actually a great idea.  Would add a bit of role-play value, too. :)

---
why can't we lock it behind a quest or miniquest like the barb fishing one? I prefer more lore-y introduction for content than just paying a fee to unlock it. Save the gold sink for something else. Rest of the idea is spot on i think! Full support otherwise.

T10 will crash to alch price when tradable thanks to Jagex not doing shit about the bots.
---
The thing is he made it seem like I was talking to him before he said free. I was talking to someone else, and he just said free when he 30 30 gmauled me, so really he started talking shit.
---
That's pretty good! your best one so far, keep it up buddy!
---
Don't a pussy and go ahead And upvote
---
This screenshot looks so scrunched together
---
Yeah my main issue right now is that I just can't manage the blob on top of a mage or ranger with a melee, I just end up taking so much damage. Good tips to practice, thanks man
---
Or, you know, just ban the dicing bots
---
Dude I was Pingu42’s bf too
---
Sounds good to me :)
---
You cannot really avoid it completely but you should be able to get good profit if you don't risk much and don't die too much.
---
Bring a one click tele (seedpod), bring combo food and maybe a phoenix necklace, use overheads as best you can if you're attacked. 89? agility for the shortcut is pretty helpful as well.
---
No, mods removed it. It got too popular with 12k upvotes and on r/all so Jagex probably "*suggested*" that they remove it. Wouldn't want all that bad press on the frontpage. 
---
lul paid mods

Vorkath is definitely less click intensive than Zulrah, it's way easier to get max DPS on him imo
---
He called you free because you are
---
Mod smackdown.
---
&gt;Lol thank you, I don’t know why that got so much hate
---
Hard to explain. Half of it was probably from you claiming to have 99 RC. I believe that you do but a lot of people will just assume you're lying to legitimize some point you're trying to make because that's how discourse works here so often. Not that you were doing so but most of these chucklefucks can't see that far past their nose.
---
People are insanely toxic here. A lot of stunted little kids in adult bodies. It can be hard to grok.
---
You are not limited to play on a 2200 total world

&gt; No, mods removed it. It got too popular with 12k upvotes and on r/all so Jagex probably "suggested" that they remove it. Wouldn't want all that bad press on the frontpage.

It's like you think under-employed people wouldn't take more time or another job if they could. Or that it's even acceptable for people to have to work overtime or multiple jobs to afford a basic standard of living, for that matter. "If you're poor it's because you're not working literally every waking hour" lmao buddy I'd be shocked if you even work 40 a week.

Why does it need to be unlocked if its an inferior method of disposal and easy af irl to just yeet a fish into a lake?

Free bow twisting

The information at the museum wasn't clear about that, however there were multiple pairs - so possibly for both as the would have been used to attach people to walls for example or just to move people around whilst being tortured :D

Damn those rune set drops are bank, gz
---
Meh, we have auto arrow pickup and equip and auto vial smash for free. I think we would be okay without a fee.

Tbh, I love this idea. Great job op!
---
For real RS membership is near the top of my list for things I'd cut if shit got too tight. I love reading the financial opinions of people who've never experienced any sort of economic hardship in life, it's so amazing.
---
Beautiful idea.
---
does anyone know roughly how much mining and crafting xp you'd get from 77 rc to 99 doing bloods / souls? i'm not really sure how to calculate that
---
how did you get dragon knives?
---
Stfu
---
yeah don't bring dodgy necks for blackjacking because you shouldn't be regular pickpocketing them. If you keep a full inventory then you can't pickpocket while they aren't knocked out because there is no space for a coin pouch, this is a good tactic because attempting to do so will stop them from aggroing if you fail the knockout even though the pickpocket doesn't work.
---
Can’t wait till you get perma banned again. And you wonder why you got perm muted? You’re honestly an idiot. People are fucking with you cause you exposed yourself as severely toxic and it’s hilarious seeing someone get so heated over a reddit post. I can only begin to imagine what a sad life you live outside this game.
---
Would it take up much time though? Excuse my ignorance but surely to disable the GE + iron man modes on an isolated world wouldn't take too much time? 
---
Regarding your point about not enough people playing the mode for it to be feasible - we have over 100k players online right now - even 1% of that would be enough for a sufficient player base. Yes it would take a long time to get an item you wanted, especially if it is rare, or the world has just launched. But you have the choice to choose to use something else! If it's not as efficient so be it. If you need a specific item for a quest or something, well you'll just have to do something else. It's this aspect of the game which I miss most - and I'm sure others do too.
---
Youre the one making a false equivalence here. "Because some low effort low rewarding methods are make-x then this thing that has never been make-x or make anything should also be make X!" Thats not in line with anything. So yes, it is indeed very gamebreaking. What about make-x amount of ardy laps or make-x kill monsters? It would be in line with other things! You are truly in favor of botting, youre lazy and youre entitled and you should probably play another game. This game is not for you.
---
Currently I am 98 combat, 99 range, 91hp, and 76 defense.  I have beaten every quest, and boss regularly with no issues (GWD, Vorkath, Zulrah, etc). However, I can’t beat Jad. I always go in and get him down to half health and the healers come every time and I panic. I’m not sure how to deal with the healers and need some advice. Should I just tag them all and try and draw them away from jad then long range jad? Or kill a healer then hit jad more then kill another healer etc?
---
All my switches are fine it’s just what to do with the healers. 
---
SETUP:
---
Full Armadyl (chestplate, helm, and plateskirt)
---
Armadyl boots 
---
Anguish 
---
Barrows gloves 
---
Archers ring
---
Blessing
---
Blowpipe (dragon darts for jad)
---
Pots are not an issue
---
I know this setup should make this fight more than easy, but for some reason Jad seems to be my biggest weakness in the game.
---
Goodluck on the rebuild brother! Remember not to go back to the sand casino
---
Maybe you need to meet more people in a less ideal financial situation than yourself, my dude, because I know plenty of people like this guy's friend who have no expensive habits or vices, live very humble existences, work full time (or more than full time), and just barely scrape by. I hear about all these poor people who spend $40 a day eating out and they just need to stop doing that and they'll be rich overnight but I've literally never met a single person who spends their money that poorly.
---
Thanks. And no I won't be going back there. :)
---
What the people who say that mean is "It's the amount I spend and I just assume everyone else throws money around like I do".
---
uWu zuk-san
---
i should've just stewed from 80 cb tbh
---
Anyone who spammed their way through that quest on the first playthrough is not my kind of player
---
Runescape isn’t a gambling service. There’s plenty of online casinos around. If you want to gamble go play them.
---
I’ve boosted to catch implings higher than my hunter level before
---
Dg is better
---
Both of which are easy to spoof. Never click a link in an email. Log into the website on your own and see if it is valid.
---
In short, they can’t. Jagex had to participate in a whole real-life committee meeting a while back that monitors the ethics of gambling platforms. Jagex had to specifically advocate that they are AGAINST gambling methods and do not intend to enable their “customers” to gamble on runescape. 
---
Unfortunately, third-party platforms have too many ways to utilize runescape for gambling and is ruining the game itself in the process. However though, the only reason third-party platforms exist at all is because certain players WILL PAY FOR GAMBLING in the first place. 
---
It’s just an ugly market that’s been created because a small minority of players don’t actually play the game as intended. And to add onto that, Jagex can’t properly manage it’s player community and filter out (in real time) the difference between a bot and a legitimate player.
---
99 fishing here, devalues my arthritis. shift-dropping works fine.
---
Pollivneach and canifis are both not in free to play either
---
I have two buckets, and I just want some white lilly seeds so I can stop skipping the contract...
---
Kill orange mage on wave 62 last and turn your run off. Get Jad down to half health like normal, switch to long range with blowpipe just before. Attack each healer once and walk them away from Jad if they’re close. Kill Jad.
---
I played enough peat control to buy full void and i got exp for it instead lol, cant wait to grind out void again later on. Pest control is my favorite existing osrs minigame!
---
With that said though, PLEASE BRING BACK STEALING CREATIONS AND VINESWEEPER
---
The profit you make from these methods is really insignifcant, like 200-300k/hr. Barbarian Fishing even with this AFK af method would still be 40k+ xp/hr which completely outclasses all the methods I listed, and only Karambwans come close to maybe being able to compete, but that's not even as AFK as the proposed Barb Fishing method.
---
Buy members, drop a ton of stuff, make it a temp ultimate ironman account.
---
Thank you friend
---
&gt;You're telling me that you'll have enough prayer to keep a protection prayer up for like 200 minutes straight? Yeah, I'm not buying that
---
Dissmissed my comment while clearly having no idea what you're talking about, no regular account will need 200 minutes of constant prayer, and ever heard of an item called the saradomin godsword? Look it up and maybe you'll find it useful.
---
However since you're complaining about it without trying it at all, aswell as being willing to give up over slightest hurdle you're clearly not going to get the cape ever.
---
So i'll just hope you have fun wearing droopy cheese on your back for the rest of your playthrough.
---
I like this concept
---
Regular void im 99 range and 97 magic though
---
Yeah pretty much all no name pickups in guitars will want replacing. Also how's the bridge on your guitar?
---
1) You do not know what the previous dude was saying to me, and you do have a say in what justified speech is. The worse thing that was said was "u retard" when like 50% of the game call each other autist which is similar.
---
2) I did not chase down OP, I got him as a target again an hour later, and he ran off and skipped me. Then I said something to him because he said "free". 
---
3) I don't understand. Is like everyone naive to the fact when you shit talk someone, they may/probably will shit talk back to you? I've been called a lot of names pking, I do not got make reddit post about being called a moron after I talked shit.
---
Nah
---
So accurate

Lol *air guitar emotes*. Thanks :)

why do u even have it equipped tbh
---
I’m curious about how you became unmuted though. You said you talked to a mod... there must be some messages to back that up. These messages would probably indicate that you were incorrectly perm muted in the first place. Post the messages or we’re going to continue to assume your first mute was due to talking like this in game. And if that’s true then yeah you were pretending to be clueless. “I called people retards a bunch and got muted.” That’s what I’m seeing.
---
It's the same with every community, the outspoken minority ruin it for everyone else. Not all pewds fans are toxic same as not all osrs players are toxic. 
---
I've met amazing people in both communities

Can you tell me how to enable those notifications for zaff shop and such? Is it a runelite feature?

What use does bulwark have for burst tasks?

plz
---
In that case let's remove shift dropping because when I played, you had to do 2 clicks instead of 1 to drop anything, making training methods like Barb fishing undesirable from the time it took to drop and/or bank and kept other more niche fishing spots more populated.
---
Waiting for Settled to cover Dog Eats Dog.
---
The iron man one makes no sense and I stated I can’t drop the shit because all of it’s important
---
You could give me maxed account with bis gear + a year to practice and I still couldn't do it. This dude is just insane.
---
I have no problem with what you've suggested in CSGO, as long as the crosshair zooms in on the target slower, than almost all of the playerbase that does it manually. Thanks for the comparison, this helped me decide, that I'm leaning towards thinking that this idea is actually great.
---
Do you know what an ultimate ironman is?
---
All the fish you throw back die to their injuries anyway. Who knew a hook through your brain woulf hurt you?
---
You don’t need to go out of your way to get farm xp on an Ironman - if you’re active with contracts and herb runs then all you need to do is dragonfruits and mahoganies to keep farming up with your other skills.
---
shouldn't have stopped paying when it was $5 a month.

"I have little to no experience of this personally but people on the internet have a psychotic hatred of it therefore I am biased""

 No
---
My point is that both are a bunch of fucking dice rolls determining whether you win or lose and both are a huge problem for gambling addicts. Just because you can mitigate randomness with skill doesn't mean it's not gambling. It may be a gray area legally but as far as I'm concerned rolling dice for money is rolling dice for money whether it's combat or not.
---
I'm a pretty nooby ironman who can't finish the stupid steel dragons task. I've been using the fairy slayer master and have these stats:
---
70 att 71 str 70 def 61 ranged 54 prayer 64 magic and 71 hp.
---
For whatever ungodly reason I've gotten 169 blue dragons twice in a row and now this (14 steels). I've tried both Iban blasting and meleeing and I can only kill two before having to bank, which is getting to be annoying as fuck. I don't really have mage gear but I'm wearing torso, anti drag, neitiz helm, str amulet, ardy cape, rune legs, climbing boots, d scim, and rune gloves (i know) for melee. 
---
I haven't even started earning points yet so this kind of sucks. I'm assuming I should get the herb level for prayer pots and just melee them + protect from melee? I drain the entirety of my prayer (without pots) on one dragon because of how long it takes to kill them - maybe there's a better weapon I should be using?
---
thanks in advance
---
You serious dude? I can easily afford membership but some people use their income to make ends meet. Not to mention you don't have to spend a fuckton of hours on the game, you just chose too.
---
It's as relevant as any other gambling. Just because you're mitigating the randomness with skill doesn't mean it's irrelevant to a discussion about "purer" gambling.
---
A special iron that has no bank that was what I was referencing. Basically you can get members, play without banking, or drop a ton of stuff. Those are the only 3 options if you want to play on the account
---
It's something that I will maybe do at some point but I wouldn't hold your breath
---
ur right poor people shouldnt play a free fantasy rpg :^)
---
Melt them back down into bars?

I had a similar situation. Legit first 10 or 20 kills I got a fucking d axe and just tilted off the planet.
---
Its honestly pretty decent. A bit of a change if you are new to headless. You tune with a allen wrench. All of that comes with it. Our other guitarist has a 6 string nk and it seems to hold tuning a lil better than the 7.
---

50k per person who wants to unlock this is nothing.

Yeah, therefore I'm biased. I said I was biased. And it wasn't really a psychotic hatred so much as a pretty in-depth review. I mean I said I'm obviously biased against it so idk why you'd think I was being ironic, whatever that would mean in this context.

I just appreciate op using and giving proper recognition to credible news sources like the Varrock Herald

Pking in today’s meta requires very set builds unless your going for maxed mains.
---
Use prop swap. if anyone else is advertising better rates they're probably scamming.
---
It’s rule of the subreddit? Either got auto picked up and removed or personally. Either way it’s still against the subreddits rules.
---
Isn't shift dropping also easyscape? Why did it get passed?
---
Very nice c: those guitars without headstocks always confuse me.
---
Runelite + and lyzard day your wrong
---
Change my mind:
---
If you play the game in a way that you enjoy it, you are getting the most of out of.

Stopped playing this game a year ago. Still on the subreddit for posts like this. Love it
---
Well if looked at that post you would see that it went from no mutes to a perm mute, so if I was calling people retards all over the place, then I would of had a temporary for that. I do not think you can even get muted for calling someone a retard.
---
You easily would if you watch YouTube tutorials. It's relatively simple on a main just requires patience and practice
---
Like... Wh.. What?
---
I never had a main in all of my runescape history, plus i want that big challenge being HC plus 1 def and 1 pray, i have to do things much harder and i will keep going until i die. Let’s see how far do i get.
---
He’s been working so hard for this. Truly an incredible PVMer and I’m so glad he finally did it!!
---
This is like comparing red dhide chaps to black dhide chaps, they're just plain better.
---
Metal dragons are generally a shitty task even with decent gear and steel dragons are the worst, it's going to be miserable trying to kill them with a dscim or with 64 magic. I'd either block them altogether or reset your streak at Turael, if your streak isn't too big. If you want to finish the task then just do 1-2 kill trips until the task is done, as 14 isn't that many. Ideally you'd use a hasta for melee but as you're an iron that's obviously not realistic
---
If you're going to mage it at your level you can try iban blast, which is nice because you can guaranteed take 0 damage and makes the kills very afk
---
&gt;auto picked up 
---
lol yea only took hours and until they were on the frontpage for that to happen.

just like they remove every other thread about this kind of thing, for "breaking the rules". Except they dont get removed, and the difference is those threads stay local to this sub, not getting big enough to be on /r/All

Depends on how you define "Getting the most out of the game" I personally use Runelite and have no issues with it, but I can totally empathize with anyone that doesn't want a bunch of text or lines all over their game world. Yeah Runelite makes reaching higher levels of efficiency *easier* by nature of its addons, though I'd also argue that those addons have the potential to be extremely immersion-breaking for those who value that and they are largely just tools of convenience.
---
tl;dr agreed if your goal is peak efficiency at all costs, not necessarily if it isn't
---
Why would you make suffering first? Genuinely curious
---
Take out the card and put it back in

What did you do instead? I’m looking for peak afk methods

Nice. Get rid of the mystic though. Wear tank armor, barrows brothers have no mage defense so accuracy is pretty useless.
---
you cant say your getting the most out of it until you've tried the best version. I.E. You cant say you hate toast if you've never put anything on it before.

You can still get there by paying 1 000 gp for the trip without the quest.
