I dont pvp. It‚Äôs not hard to avoid skull tricking. If you‚Äôre not good enough to avoid it you‚Äôre probably not good enough to get a kill, so just dont attack people altogether.

That‚Äôs stupid. Voting no to a bunch of updates because you dont like scammers. Scammers are going to exist as long as free trade exists so why bother? Sure they‚Äôre pricks but they‚Äôre easy to avoid if you dont try to get ambitious with them

Why are people being so critical? There are literally noobs running about in d med helms with combat bracelets who don't give a flying fuck about anything being said in the comments right now. How about you stop thinking of it as Firemaking training and think if it as magic training with a bonus.   
---
The OP simply offered an idea. These ideas are pretty much never implemented in the same manner as they are suggested. They are tweaked. If you polled FM today, you'd have literally no idea that Wintertodt would be around the corner as a possibility.  
---
Why can't this suggestion, or literally any other suggestion, be the same way? Ideas CAN be improved, you realize that right?

2 almost identical names is an easy enough trick for someone to fall for. It‚Äôs an easy thing to put in a fix for. And killing someone vs spotting a name difference are 2 different things. Most people are looking at the person and their inventory and not of the name is DIIICK or DIIIICK.

You get a slayer xp boost from finishing a boss task, so id say if you cba with the boss it gives go for 3 as youll get more slayer xp/hr that way since the boost it gives you, if you want to grind that boss for an item, i.e. Kril from zammy hasta go for the max (35 iirc)

thats just every anime show i remember watching ever since seeing pokemon in 99-2000. but i see a lot of gamers go super hard on anime and i've had them recommend me their favorites. a lot of the time its just like a group of girls attending high school, or like a kid playing soccer. im just curious what the appeal is. as i said, its just like animated reality tv imo. i don't understand the appeal to reality tv either

self interest includes voting no to things that would be considered a waste as there is no benefit to someone who doesn't engage with the proposed content. spite voting is anecdotally a strawman argument. i've talked to easily over a couple hundred people in game about certain polls and why they're voting for what, i've never seen unless obviously a joke someone voting because "hah i hate that group of players!"

its not harder, its longer.  Let's be honest, its not hard to max in osrs in 2019, i mean i have been maxed now for 2 years its not a big deal at this point which is why this cape color for iron men make no sense.  You are rewarded with bis cape, enjoy it it that is the reward, not impressing others who dont really care.

might be a habit, not a bad one

I failed jad at least 10 times before getting my cape and that‚Äôs what worked for me, I also can‚Äôt emphasize enough logging out and calming down right before the last wave as it significantly helps get those pray switches down, once you get in a rhythm i think it‚Äôs hard to mess up.

Whatever narrative you may think of this is your own and opinions are openly accepted. But, don't downplay as if this were a bad idea or this is not enough, my suggestion could open the door to TONS of new content I could imagine with many uses. My main focus is trying to explain my suggestion thoroughly rather than letting a person state its a bad idea, give me a reason why it's bad and i'll try to work with it to make it better, simple.

Stating its bad is one thing, not giving a reason is another.

I'm a Radiologic Technologist (x-ray tech), and this is the exact answer. We have a higher "cap" of radiation that we as radiation workers can be exposed to on an annual basis, as well as a lifetime basis. In other words, if we get too much radiation, they can literally force us to quit our job in radiography for life. Not to mention that a small amount of radiation over a protracted amount of time is nearly harmless, whereas we are exposed to it in large quantities every day; so shielding ourselves from it at every opportunity is incredibly important.
---
For anyone curious, the best way to stay safe from radiation is DISTANCE. Every time you double your distance from a radiation source, the radiation exposure is 1/4 of the previous amount. And it is speculated that at 6 feet from the source of a modern x-ray tube, the dose should be minimal enough to consider yourself safe.

May not be much to you guys, but I just finished monkey madness for the first time!

Big arms don‚Äôt necessarily equal strength. A better indicator of strength in bench is back development in my opinion. Also biceps do not assist with a bench in anyway. The prime movers of a bench or overhead movement is your triceps and chest. Also, no where did I say accessory work isn‚Äôt important, I just associate intentionally training biceps as being no more than just aesthetics. There is nothing wrong with that, just not my thing. Just keep them out of the squat rack!

Nah, it's been in OSRS since it came out.

I was also thinking of new firemaking methods. I was thinking burning stumps of trees that you farm that give half of the farming xp. Takes about 2 minutes to fully burn and you can plant another tree. The ash left over has a chance to upgrade your compost to the next level of compost, so regular becomes super, super becomes ultra.

What‚Äôs the drop rate on those skirts??

When asked about why the mechanic was bad, your only response was to talk about how you *feel* which is a terrible reason to want a game mechanic changed for everyone.
---
A mechanic is a mechanic. As long as it's fair for everyone it's hard to say it does any harm plus there are hundreds of unintuitive things in this game just like this.
---
Imagine an rpg where you collect coins. You can see a coin on the ground and you can pick it up. So you try to pick it up but you can't, for no reason other than the game's code limits your max cash stack. Would you not see that as a jarring viewing and playing experience? It's even more so when you break it down to the simplicity of RS. 
---
* There is nothing in my way
---
* I am within range of this coin
---
* I clicked on it first
---
* Others can pick it up just fine...
---
Imagine a game where you store items in a bank. You have an item and you can put the item in the bank. So you try to store it in the bank, but you can't, for no reason other than the game's code limits your bank spaces to 816. Would you not see that as a jarring viewing and playing experience? It's even more so when you break it down to the simplicity of RS. 
---
* I can see that there's open space in the bank
---
* My item is bankable
---
* I can stack more of an existing item
---
* Others can store stuff with the same banker...
---

---
In all scenarios, that argument is completely inane.
---
The limited development team has FAR better uses for their time than to fix some corner-case immersion ruiner for you.
---
Depending where you're doing your tasks, using prossy and teleporting to an altar to restore prayer might be an option. Really nice for catacombs tasks since you can get back in under 30 seconds.
---
The more you know.
---
Black chins are interesting as well because in reality, they aren't well balanced. The GP and XP is unparalleled by any other hunter method and it's so incredibly close to both a teleport into the spot, as well as a few steps to a teleport out, that you could literally bank and return within like a minute at most. You could legit bank every 50 chins or so, make a nice chunk of profit, get the best xp/hr for hunter and easily escape PKers.
---
People tend not to complain about the PKers there because they understand PKers have an ACTUAL incentive for account progress. You kill someone collecting chins, you can expect a couple thousand GP in chins with realistic chances of a significant amount more. You can't really argue to a PKer killing you that you don't got shit when you are hunting black chins and you'll look like the clown for crying that you get PKed at black chins.
---
That is literally the stupidest shit I have ever read on this.
---
There is a LOT of stuff that people don't like that has been polled that hasn't gotten passed. The entire point of polls is to keep shit out that the majority doesn't want, regardless of how much sense it makes.
---
I seen a video months back titled something along the lines of, "What would chance of the Divine passed polls" and the 3 examples were super niche situations. It was something like if you get hit by Zuk during inferno, you'll survive if overhealed to near full, but the problem is if you're getting hit by Zuk you're probably inexperienced and can't afford to waste the supplies anyways. If you got hit max by a rusher doing ice barrage &gt; AGS &gt; gmaul, you'd survive if overhealed by like 2 HP and last was some other very niche use as well.
---
The point is, polls have always been majority takes priority based off their preference. People don't like PvP polls for various reasons and vote no. People don't like QoL they'll vote no. It doesn't matter what it is, if people don't like it they won't vote yes for it. The literal entire point of people voting no on polls, is they don't like where they end up in it.

Oh, buddy. You don't even understand the english language. Hold off on judging writing until you do. I was referring to his use of "autistic roastees". He is referring to the person doing the roasting but the roastee based on the form of the word would be the one getting roasted. The word he should have used would be "autistic roaster". Never did I declare myself a "winning roaster".

They generally do 2 big updates per year, one in the summer the other in winter. The last few years the winter updates have all been in January. (CoX, Vorkath, Kebos Lowlands) So most likely not anything more for this year.
---
As OP and others have suggested. Give an option in the Attack Player control to only show the attack option if the player has attacked you first. Then you would be able to remove players ability to skull-trick you.
---
Great for people who want it, optional for those who don‚Äôt want to use it.

Why would you use tome of fire to alch, such a waste even for those overloading in coins

I mean you can afk the BA and Challenge Mode pets as well.

Helpful tip for those who struggle in and out of membership, since there arnt a huge amount of commonly used F2P items, ive always stocked my bank with a bit of everything. 
---
When you have membership, buy 1 of each weapon, food, rune, tool, item or resource that you know you'll need in F2P, keep a placeholder down so that they stay when you have 0 and next time you run out of membership (provided you don't forget an item you need) you'll still be able to use your bank as normal, despite it being full.

My first thought seeing these is keycaps that match the icons for the menu. Bags, prayer, spellbook, equipment, stats, etc. People can place them on their Fkey shortcuts. Good way to remember them if you want to remap them
---
Super good idea. I will definitely be visiting this idea as so many people have suggested it
---
You are coaxing sometime into unintentionally doing something that they don't want to do. That sounds more like a scam than outplaying to me.
---
Not true. As usual, someone who knows nothing about pking has something to say and gets a lot of upvotes. Deep wildy pking is a lot different than BH and pvp world pking. If you‚Äôre looking to NH brid, those worlds are useless for any combat other than pures. And even then, if you‚Äôre on late at night, a lot of times there are ZERO people to fight. It‚Äôs not the same.

he probally did a bond and some p2p...

you cand do say x43 x1 bond packages, have to buy the largest bond pack or several smaller packs...

This has nothing to do with immersion and everything to do with balance and fairness.
---
You're examples to show my logic as poor were in scenarios where you clearly ignored the limiting factor that is displayed.
---
Yes a player might be confused they can't add to their bank. But the game indicates their bank spaces, and tells them their bank is full, same deal with inventory 
---
The coin thing is a little bit more hidden of course, but it's also a limitation of the coding language itself. That is out of the developers hands and thus they can only implement workarounds like platinum tokens. It's expected that a new player won't exactly have 2.147b in their hands anytime soon.
---
You obviously have your own opinion that this isn't important. Whether that be because you think it's a legit tactic to abuse LoS mechanics or because you "don't want them wasting time" etc. And that's just.. your opinion as well. I can have an opinion while also speaking on objective matters.
---
Personally? I don't pk. This will do nothing to impact my gameplay. So it's not exactly an opinion that of line to want it changed for my own reasons. It's an opinion I have that it should be changed because objectively it's a poorly designed thing. It's add no gameplay experience, it's not a skill that is rewarding to learn, and it's not clearly illustrated or made obvious to a player why it occurs. Your examples of my logic being applicable to existing mechanics ingame satisfy those points. They indicate why something is happening. And it makes sense to a player (from a balance or code limitation). Not being able to attack someone who can attack you "because" is not exactly a good system. 
---
Can you provide any reasons as to why it is? Or is your only point "it's a waste of time I'd rather them work on the XYZ thing I want"

I am quite shit but most pkers in the wildy are quite shit too so it's not usually an issue for me.
---
At least when you max in runescape you aren't a hundred thousand dollars in debt and interning 60+ hours a week!
---
Nawwww! My boy likes to do the same thing, black cats are the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Max combat
---
It's Dragonstone Armour. It came out on OSRS when they released Song of the Elves. It's a rare reward from the Elven Crystal Chest.
---
Thanks ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
That's a different kind of Dragonstone Armour anyway. It doesn't replace Rune Armour and it's Hybrid like Void. It can be used in F2P. And.. In my humble opinion, even though it looks bad, it still looks better than the OSRS version.
---
Do you have any social media to keep up with your art?
---
I‚Äôm gonna hang on to this one
---
Well, most OSRS players have a lot of loyalty points on RS3 already, since membership works with both games. Probably millions of loyalty points. Consecutive membership grants more loyalty points, but you get them even without consecutive membership, that's what I mean.
---
He sure does and his mommy jagex tucks him in nice and good
---
Wouldn't a maxed player vote yes for any potential new content since they've already done everything?
---
I feel like people who go for completion are more likely to just love playing the game and would want more game to play as a given.
---
Doubt many people are maxing solely for the fact that they have a fancy cape and don't want more content because it might mean they lose their cape.
---
It'd be pretty insane to put thousands of hours into a game you don't like playing, right?
---
When you hit 99.
---
Lmfao legit service I can imagine
---
I too took high school Spanish. Leche
---
This is one of the best in the thread. You would have to intentionally fail a minigame, by yourself, on the correct world without being kicked out for inactivity.

Let me mass cook stacks of food on the ground by casting fire spells on them.

---
Thanks for the extra money and hope it will be some nice fashionscape!
---
The recent TB changes were a giant step in the right direction (and a super obvious one for anyone who‚Äôs actually tried to solo PK any fucking where in this game) but I agree. Even in singles it‚Äôs near impossible to find a ‚Äúfair fight‚Äù as most people in the wildy are a part of some massive circle jerk community that if there‚Äôs one... there‚Äôs 10 more soon to follow.
---
I thought I was so fucking cool when I managed to kill one of them at the Karamja docks lobster fishing spot in F2P. 
---
Always brought my full equipment when I went skilling just in case I got the chance to flex on the noobs by killing one of the random events. Miss that shit.
---
well anyway thanks for getting upset on someone else's behalf it's really entertaining
---
Literally how the fuck though?
---
O ya
---
If you want AFK I would recommend either maples or yews in the WC guild.  The +7 boost (presumably also a +3 from your d axe) from the wc guild will be a nice boost to xp/hr and I assume Hosidius favor is already a priority since 99 farming is your goal.
---
I used to do lots of f2p rc before EoC. I wasn't very efficient I just liked the running. Eventually I got to about 40 rc.
---
Escape key should be the logout door icon
---
Meet me at canifis I'll take on all of you.
---
i mean runelite gives the lookup feature i dont really care about people's gear clan or message.
---
Because having 99 in a skill doesn't guarantee success on everything
---
No
---
It‚Äôs not removing skull tricking as it is so much as 3v1 In non multi is still 3v1. There‚Äôs no grace period so the solo PK concept is kinda Shit. Lord knows the popular multi spots are riddled with ballista teams who each risk a max of some Dhides. The PvM side was ‚Äúcoddled‚Äù with a nice death timer because of DDOS attacks, nothing else. The instanced Gear retrieval concept is a lame one,  but if I lose 100s of hours of work due to these spaghetti coded servers? Damn right I‚Äôm not ever touching this game again.  PvP in this game has many ‚Äúloopholes‚Äù that get massively abused. Making the concept unfinished and an unpolished shit show for anyone new trying to get into the game.
---
I think they could honestly deal with it really well by creating a neural network that flags bots for them, we already know a bot‚Äôs end goal is to make as much gp as possible before it gets banned, so all you need is a neural network that looks for high uptime accounts that were recently created, then from there it should be easy to figure out a few additional parameters that make it really easy to flag bots.

Just hire someone to clean your bank and they will do it no time!

u know ima do the same although it aint gonna work lol

After your first cape you just need to kill 1 and give it to kolodion with the corresponding cape for any extras

After doing a bit of research it seems that this is the 3rd rarest "drop" in recorded OSRS history.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwPd\_KeJnTM&amp;t=209s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwPd_KeJnTM&amp;t=209s)

Why does it look like the genie took a shit on ur face

Downvotes are the true upvotes, troll posts aside.
---
Eh it's something like this - log in to the osrs website&gt;account management&gt;subscriptions?&gt;cancel subscription. It won't cancel your current membership but will stop it from being recurring.
---
Time and money waste do it with Slayer and agility
---
Your joking ?
---
Congratz mate ;-)
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre trying to tell me, all I‚Äôm saying is the guy said just because it‚Äôs a 99 it doesn‚Äôt guaranteed non failure, when in fact 99 cooking does just that
---
Wyverns get stuck due to their size AFAIK so no.
---
I admit I like where the house tab currently is, could make that the exception?
---
I did some small testing when the beta worlds opened. They still get stuck on some rocks, but I don't know if all the old safespots still work as I've never done them off task.
---
Wow what a hilarious joke,
---
Love. I would personally do the f-key icons for mine.
---
Is that an oompa loompa
---
Yeah that's what I mean, make it basically the LMS version of castlewars decorative armor
---
Cause PvM doesn‚Äôt have crazy OP gear *cough* blowpipe *cough*
---
No?
---
As far as I can tell from the amount of times I've been killed in wildy and what I can see at Torvesta, Skillspecs etc. PvP is still going strong. I personally liked the time when wildy was PvP free and the revs ran around in the wildy and I shat my pants everytime I saw one.
---
Waaaaah I didn't get the drop I want
---
Are you using the updated version of the wiki? I.e. os.rs.wiki and not the fandom.wikia.
---
Because this page https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Watson certainly shows the correct location of Watson.
---
you need 2 anyway so who cares? you got lucky as wheres problem? usually you have nothing at 2kc
---
Well you need 2.

100k per character
---
My best guess would be Air Staff for Camelot/Seers bank teleport and Tome Of Fire for infinite fire runes to alch (non combat skills don't drain the charges)
---
I always wondered why a gf was 50k, seems cheap for such a rare drop. He's been crashing the market for years!
---
Dude, it's 6am EST/3am PST on a Saturday morning, what are you expecting, peak hours numbers?
---
This guy fucks
---
&gt; just deal with it bruv ;)
---
I mean, we litterally do "just deal with it", sure you can report people but it's not like you're getting your items back. Also it's on a world that doesn't matter and any progress or accomplishments are getting deleted so people need to calm down.
---
Strange, i checked the diary (western provinces) but there is no mention there about passing for free. It can't be the Watchtower Quest either since i've done that and i had to pay 20gp to pass, i guess it remains a mystery.
---
&gt;dh bomb ppl tryna duel, dickhead
---
It's a shame there isn't some sort of Colosseum where honorable combat can occur. Or a part of the wilderness that only allows 1v1 combat.
---
I would agree with this counter, but only if Ironmen weren't allowed to benefit from bonds at all. As it stands, ironmen can benefit from a normal account using bonds on them. It just seems nonsensical and ridiculously arbitrary that they need to use a middleman account to purchase the only item in the game with any monetary value that they can benefit from.
---
Looks super impractical.
---
Yes
---
What Huh
---
Don't think so
---
Tbh this wouldnt change much just makes things simpler, rather then having to get on an alt and just so it can pick up the shit you drop and sell it on the ge

---
Haha I originally started in runescape classic back in 2001, I think theres too much going on in PVP these days and it's way too easy to combo someone out for WAY more than their full hp Nd so PKing completely lost its joy for me. I just PVM now really.
---
Money will magically wind up in miscellanea or something instead of in the form on members items

I've been very active in the game and am very diehard pvm with some recent skilling. I've never disliked PvP what I dislike is the community, I really want PvP to be revived especially nh as the high intensity of it is really fun, honour pking never appealed to me it seems like an rng fest of who can get that big hit
---
A drystreak for first sigil is bad. Good luck, hope you get it soon!
---
You really didn't need to do this, and you also really shouldn't have.
---
Fuck yeah, you got the spade
---
You can burn things at 99 cooking. The skill isn't what's guaranteeing non failure, it's the Cape that does
---
He looks really young. What happened to the poor guy?
---
Completionist, spectral is my oldest uncompleted goal on osrs. Was never planning on using it anyway, but also didn't expect to go over 5x droprate dry. Can't stop now!

More efficient skilling for buying and maintaining buffs is just needlessly complicating and creating new meta.

He was 25 years young, he loved to ride his motorcycle. He rode it home from work the other night when a vehicle pulled out in front of him and he had no time to react. I dont know to many details past that point.

Why not keep this reward out of LMS and actually bring back Fist of Guthix (and Stealing Creation)? Whenever I speak to players about is nearly everyone gets excited.
---
I reckon runelite could it do it first before j√§gex
---
Rotate the Zaros symbol 45 degrees to make it look more like an x

If I were in your shoes, I would get POH upgrades first, then rigour, then upgrade slayer gear.  The house upgrades are so useful for all PvM, questing, general travelling around the game.  Rigour is great for raids and bossing.  Also it might be the paranoid side of me, but if I somehow get hacked those con levels and rigour upgrade aren‚Äôt going anywhere.
---
The first 7 arclight specs do drain corp's defence lvl, because it's at around 110 after the 3 DWH's. 
---
The reason why arclight specs are needed is not to "not get smecked too hard" (protect melee is able to block all melee damage). It is because of the BGS drain order you just mentioned. The fastest way to get BGS to drain magic lvls.

Fake videos. Even elvemage waaaay back in the days before monetisation, was caught faking his videos, or in some instances, luring friends and fans.
---
Rev killers risk, because revs actually drop loot. The NPCs from wildy rejuvenation don't drop shit, and they're safespotted with 3 items or broad bolts.
---
You raised your runecrafting from 20-27 in only a week. Impressive.
---
I‚Äôm very sorry for your loss. That community sounds wonderful. Is it still active?
---
the fact that the music is delayed slightly irritates me.
---
&gt;You've just made the same contradiction you made before. First you state that Pkers in &lt; 1M risk are safe, then you say that any skulled Pker is at risk.
---
because skulled pkers that are worth going for nearly universally risk more than 1m. if you don't get this yourself you're clearly unqualified to have this debate lmao
---
&gt;Good. If they're not risking anything because their crap gear isn't making them a target then they shouldn't have much chance of winning the Bulwark user's risk.
---
quoting once again because you clearly didn't read this: 
---
&gt; a catch-all tank shield that makes tanking easyscape is not good game design, especially in a game like runescape that focuses a lot of importance in switching your gear to reap the bonuses of each of the combat triangle parts. dinh's undermines this, because all you have to do is camp hides, dinhs and your other 3 unskull protected items and you're essentially protected from all of them, leaving the only effort in switching your prayers. 
---
your gear doesn't have to be substantially better, it just has to be the right kind of gear. with bulwark, that balance doesn't exist because the pvmer risks essentially nothing but still gets the defence of far higher valued gear.
---
&gt;You could just gear in more expensive gear and risk more chance of getting killed in exchange for a chance at getting the kill.
---
what have you actually said here?
---
&gt;You and so many other pkers bang on and on about how PvMers never risk anything, yet your issue is that Pkers have to risk bank in order to kill them. You can't get rewards without risk and so you want PvMer's gear nerfed until you can.
---
risk/reward balance is always skewed towards the unskulled pvmer because they can use more items at same risk than the pker. pkers automatically risk far more than the pvmers **even in rag gear**, simply because they're skulled. the issue with bulwark is that **even** then it isn't enough. it's just a cheap crutch for tanking and takes a lot of skill out of it.
---
but ye, im getting real tired arguing about pvp with someone who's never pked a day in their life, but if you wanna keep this discussion going then please learn to read, thank you:
---
&gt;"well-equipped" = 4 unrisked items + black d'hides &amp; bulwark afk? all you have to do to protect yourself against practically anybody, is to chuck on augury and sip brews. that is NOT by any margin good game design, considering what kind of a game runescape is.
---
&gt;??? why do you choose to not understand that 4 iteming with far less than 500k risk is not an appetising target for anybody, compared to a SKULLED pker, who ANYBODY can pj at ANY GIVEN MOMENT? all it takes is for the pker to skull up for them to be at risk of being hit by teams in deep. if you don't realise this, you've clearly not been to wilderness enough.
---
bulwark is shit game design.
---
What does this have to do with the pet thoo
---
Giant mole is probably the easiest. All you need is pray mele. Kills might be slow with those stats but you can go train slayer to get them up, if you can afford black mask that will help the cup hr.
---
I pk everyone I see and even if they're in nothing. I'll get 5 or so pks each week where it's over a mil from some clue hunter bringing stupid stuff or some dude having 1000s of c balls on him but no gear on. This happens enough where it's worth attacking everyone.
---
melee for saccaranis , train strength and use a dragon scimitar

best way to acquire them is by saving money and buying them, at the grand exchange. killing monsters and selling the drops at the grand exchange is a good way to get started saving.

So you‚Äôre gonna touch his fossilized mushroom?

Why would you want to do inferno on beta worlds when you just can get the cape from the spawn tables WeirdChamp

When stealing creation came out bonus xp wasnt a thing. It gave degradable t40 gear/tools that doubled your xp when used in their respective skills. It only had stuff for a few skills like a harpoon, pickaxe, axe, mage, range, and melee gear iirc. maybe a butterfly net too.
---
It was a ton of fun. Since no items are allowed in (because once you get in, all the tools and pking gear have to be made in the designated area in the time) its pretty much just as fun in rs3 but nobody plays. I used to run with a cc called something like fast sc or fastsc a couple years ago, but in their games they dont allow pvp.
---
Saying stuff like
---
"the game wasnt taken seriously"
---
"retarded cousin"
---
Is nonsensical labels to add to attribute to the game. LoL and Fortnite are possibly the 2 most hated games and communities in gaming, do you think LoL should change their game to be like RuneScape? Or maybe COD?

New to the sub and to osrs. What does the 11$ thing mean

Who cares? Bring blowpipe, accumulator, clue, clue box, spade, and a few tuna. If you die you lose 500gp and 3 minutes of your time, and just try again on a different world or in 15 minutes.

1) If you and your opponent are the same combat lvl you can't go deeper in the wilderness. 
---
2) what does standing in lvl 2 wilderness achieve? They don't have to be stood in a safe zone, their hp is not on display for everyone to see. You seem to assume that everyone piles onto someone in full DH as soon as they enter the wildy?
---
3) people are testing the beta so why would they go to the duel arena? Also a pretty naive answer as nobody uses the duel arena for that type of combat.
---
4) you're genuinely suggesting people go multi for 1v1 fights? Wow, just wow.
---
5) yes it's a beta. That means that people DH bombing are purely doing it to be annoying cunts.
---
6) you clearly have no clue about PvP. Yes it's 1v1, but as soon as the fight is over the PJer can jump them for a one shot before they even retaliate... That's where the term comes from FFS.
---
You have to switch prayer before he spits out his attack during jad phase. 
---
As soon as you see the yellow ball change to range pray, and as soon as you see green ball change to mage pray.
---
It wouldn't bother me because I'm not a snowflake that loses sleep over words.
---
I‚Äôve been wanting this for years. There would need to be some reward system to incentivize people to play it for sure. Although the old rewards may be a little too OP? But I really want this to come back. Everyone just needs to consistently keep it on the radar.

Pkers killed pking. No matter what content they add to the wildy as long as there are pvpers going super gungho about killing me and taking my stuff, I see no reason to be in the wildy.  Unless jagex adds a world where the wildy is pk free I'd rather go grind elsewhere.  There's no fun in having a band of sociopaths chase me for my stuff when I'm playing casually for fun and they are playing competitively to crush me

Also the easiest way to tell what to pray is to watch the bottoms of his feet when they lift up. If they're facing forward pray range, if they're facing the ground pray mage. Waiting for a stomp or hover is a surefire way to panic pray and die.
---
I‚Äôd love pvpers to have fun fighting each other. 
---
But to make the wildy feel full by making people that don‚Äôt want to pk go out there for stuff doesn‚Äôt fix anything that‚Äôs really wrong with the actual PvP system. 
---
They‚Äôre all out there waiting for clue hunters because they‚Äôre not having fun dueling each other. That‚Äôs what needs to be fixed.

Yep, he's damn hard. I got him down to 17 hp one attempt, but I had to teleport out as I was on 13. I seem to take too much damage on phase 2 though, like half my food goes to that.

Banned for having so much chrome tabs open at the same time

Pretty sure they won‚Äôt add it just because people will just farm it for the xp rewards and not just to play the mini game the way it‚Äôs supposed to be played. Back before RS3 there were ccs where people would deplete all the resources to intentionally get faster games and maximize points. I want SC as much as the next guy but unfortunately the mentality of efficiency would render this mini game unplayable for fun

Yeah that's fair it was a long post. By 2 heads per side do you mean I'll be on the left side for 2 attacks then run to the right side of the island for the next 2?
---
Very cool, bet they look even better when the keyboard lights up.

---
Ah yes the dreaded manual ban for no reason. Most unfortunate.
---
no it's not lol. even if you are clueless they will still take you because chambers is extremely easy.
---
So going to the side bar and hitting subscriptions showed nothing?
---
In all ways to make this weird you go with this. Good day to you sir
---
id be suprised if that was common knowledge. I had never heard of seren before the sote boss fight. Honestly when i quest i only read as much as i can while spamming through it as quickly as i can (not cause i dont care about lore, i just dont care enough to double the length of my quests reading it), but i cant imagine seren is super relevant in most of osrs outside the lore of that one quest.
---
I'm pking some clue hunters to this, even if you vote no I'm still gonna do it
---
I don‚Äôt mind them since they‚Äôre good xp, but it seems like they‚Äôre way too frequent
---
Yes! That's exactly what i mean :)
---
Gah damn okay thanks for the response!
---
I plan on using the Lenovo mostly for school anyways then having my gtx1060 at home hooked up to an external chassis. I‚Äôm sure I can get 50fps if I use low settings and no gpu plugin..

That's awful, I'm sorry for your communities loss, he sounded like a wonderful guy and a genuinely good person. I hope your community can continue to flourish and work without him, I'm sure it would be what he would have wanted from all of you.
---
The sentiment is shared, when i check the new content on OSRS. Both ar far from what they started as.
---
In reality they don't even notice, did 99 agility with my brain turned of and watching something alongside it
---
Was 805 kill dry :) then got this on 1 task
---
Was it d3dicat3d?
---
I think I might have to just do that. Spend all day just to wrap my head around the mechanics and rotations. When it's the range faze I feel I take massive amounts of damage even though I'm praying mage. Yes I know it throws range in there aswell but I feel like I'm just eating the whole time and I barely get any range hits in.
---
Scam.
---
If you're ever unsure just log on through the actual RS website (not any of the links they give you) and check there
---
Use a computer. If you really can‚Äôt get a stylus that helps
---
That much I agree with.  From just one picture, granted, but it seems like he probably wasn't happy with the game 10 years ago and he's not going to be happy with it now.  Homie needs a new game.

yes another to downvote for today
---
I love when pkers don't have a looting bag. Less profit.
---
I have a normal account too, simmer down, Zalcano.
---
Why does everyone say that lmao don't bot next time buddy
---
It's the skull trick scamming motto.  It's how they justify lures and other scams as well.  Don't trade anything you're willing to lose.  If you walk into the wild you should expect to lose all of your items.  If you log into a PvP world, even in a safe zone, expect to die.  As long as you have influencers repeating that, you're going to have sheep agreeing.
---
Bro you don‚Äôt even have a sob story? Wtf

Inferno is SO easy after the 20568th kill, i dont get why you guys find it so hard.

CoX may be easier than alot of other content out nowadays, but its still challenging content for someone inexperienced.

I went from doing the one-finger-peck method of typing, to 128wpm at my peak playing RuneScape as a teen.  People still comment when I type quickly and I always tell them I learned from the best.

Good idea, thanks man!
---
No looting bag rip
---
Without the hard diary you have no way to locate the mole. Even with the locator the gp per hour is still quite low. Without the locator the gp per hour is probably close to 100k an hour
---
Yes its fake
---
i wanna say yes, i got one recently aswel
---
99% of the time someone posts a "false ban" it's a legitimate ban
---
Speed typing and English, and many life lessons such as ‚Äúif it‚Äôs too good to be true, it probably is‚Äù.
---
Pretty sure there are hard clues that take you to the wildy? It's not about it being a master clue, that part just makes it more frustrating for me because 1. they're a lot rarer, and 2, all my progress is lost, including spending like 8m on leveling herblore specifically for this clue. If it was a hard clue i'd chuck it without a second thought.
---
Just practice really
---
I'd vote no so hard, the minigame would be dead content unless they added op rewards. If they added op rewards people would figure out how to leech/afk and ruin it.
---
Seren is an old god, Seren and Zaros were made together by Mah (I think Mah) and are linked together, which is how they both ended up on Geilrielrneor together.
---
Thank you, this makes a lot of sense now.

Nah I‚Äôd dh bomb people waiting for a fight, but thank you for making an assumption and running with it

Master clues with equipment for emote step of over 500k and you don't want to change the X option so you just take it all out.

It you subscribed on the play store you have to cancel through subscriptions on your phone go to settings &gt; itunes and app store &gt; click on your apple id at the top and hit view apple id &gt; subscriptions

Why on earth would I want that in my single player game?
---
Weird and morbid but I wonder if anyone‚Äôs HCIM has genuinely outlived them yet
---
Jagex need to make big update and add bunch of new agility shortcuts. There is entire skill for these shortcuts, word is big and there is not even 98 shortcuts in entire world.
---
Lmao who needs a jmod smackdown when you have post history
---
I figured you did but I just wanted to bring up an aids cure because you definitely need it after grinding a maxed POH. XD
---
this is kinda sad
---
Or bumblefuck wildy that ends with a 3 way
---
How are y'all out here still getting scammed in 2019?
---
&gt; be nothing more than a sack of meat
---
if you gear for PVP with only 3 good items you already are
---
Nah lol like 300m max. But it‚Äôd be like used to buy bonds, and quest items and things like that.
---

---
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him
---
Well they could obviously put some things in place for that. You have to risk x amount, have to be in combat for x amount of time (I guess rushing would get fucked over there, that could go either way) have to deal x amount of damage (same thing here) Or they could do a FoG/BH matchmaking system of some sort. And yeah people would sell kills (they already do for totems and other shit in OS) and farming could be exploited but the majority of players don't do these things. Yeah some bad would come of it, but I think this is the sort of revival that actually might mean something. A lot of players would genuinely start pking if it was actually legitimately rewarding.
---
Ahahahahaha wow
---
How much are you expecting? Lol
---
RNGesus hates you
---
it was for a different account, and theres proof. The account in question was made after the date of that post. a jmod will know
---
Dude you might be an expert on shit you have never experienced or participated in. You don‚Äôt pk but think your opinions on PvP hold weight. Then you opine for a fix to skulltricking, only to turn around and say you‚Äôve never been skull tricked. Why do you think your ideas ‚Äúmake the game better‚Äù?
---
I got banned for holding 5 and + on windows mouse keys, and windows mouse keys are supposed to be allowed according to their homepage article from a while back, was only 2 days though so I gave up on Jagex's "customer" support - or more specifically, lack thereof.
---
Which part is sad? Finally finishing a goal I set for myself, having a supportive girlfriend, or moving for a better opportunity for work and realizing I can try something I think is pretty cool? I don't see the sad but I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
Hopefully you get some Reddit luck and get 2 pieces next run.
---
I seen like 100-125k
---
2019 scapers be like: add a direct teleport to it and make sure it‚Äôs available from the POH
---
You don‚Äôt need your whole cash stack for that. Often less than 1k
---
People do things that are not efficient all the time, the reason most people don't play castle wars is cause they just straight up don't like pvp or running a flag from one place to another.
---
Thanks for the tip. Polli sucks. I'm prob gonna get membership again and focus on completing the hard diary, then spend a good bit of time training
---
killing demonic gorillas
---
At the very least you used a auto hoy key to alchemy according to your previous post so get fucked :)
---
So you made the account to bot on after learning how to bot? Your logic is on point my dude.
---
Reward doesn't need to be monetary, fun is a reward too
---
LMFAOOOOOOOOO
---
Did you or did you not use ever use AHK on that account
---
You should definitely be grinding hunter to 99 while assisting and doing farm runs
---
and DESECRATE my OLD SCHOOL experience?! /s
---
beautiful. proud of you brother
---
That's actually quite fast.
---
Why not just add souls wars then
---
Sometimes people do. That's enough reason imo.
---
i never used ahk on the account. I swear
---
So turn on right click only derp
---
Kinky.
---
As long as your account shares an email and or password with another account it can be that.
---
Or something else, but it is you and not runelite
---
nope it was 103 cb with mm2 done etc wouldnt bot on that
---
Half way to 99 you fucking dummy
---
either way a lot more than me ;\_;
---
Base 90s are fine for most end game stuff.
---
gotta be bait
---
Start with a f2p pking account, no risk and u learn kinda about stacking, safing, and eating
---
Yanking the shit out of his ass. That‚Äôs dedication. Gross. But dedication.

Shut up Dedicated

Yeah but nice to see in bank!
---
If you have an infernal cape, are you able to still choose Jad from a TzHaar assignment?

Don't you think the water should he pvmers and the grate the lure to the wilderness

I thought so too! Especially since in 2013 I started streaming on RS, I thought it fit nicely. 
---
Also thanks! I'm ahead enough to sleep normal now but instead I may do a 24h last day lol
---
Btw
---
‚Ä¶ is that a thing??
---
well i can show you offense history and it woudl be clean if you want me to?
---
Considering you got hacked again and blame a FOSS you don't know your shit
---
I thought so, but everyone else that has commented seems to think otherwise.
---
actually though lol. look at his post history
---
You got this bro
---
The most annoying part is losing the clue though, I'm so fucking curious every time I do a clue, not getting the reward makes me seethe!!!!
---
He should flip her for profit
---
little bit of technique in there as well
---
hmm okay. That's kind of frustrating but less frustrating than getting banned.
---
dont forget your bronze dagger and full monk
---
I‚Äôm going to put this on my Toyota Prius next to my Bernie 2020 sticker!! :)
---
lmfao ur trash
---
Zulrah Jad phase is kinda hard to get down because it‚Äôs so weird and if you do it right, it feels like you‚Äôre doing it wrong. So let‚Äôs say he starts with range. You‚Äôll pray range and when you see the range attack, flip to mage pray. Now comes the weird part. As soon as you see him close his mouth wings to launch the mage attack, switch to range prayer. And vice versa. It‚Äôs kind of hard to understand, and if you don‚Äôt get it I can add you on discord and share screen with you so you can see what it looks like.
---
Okay, what the hell is going on right now. I am in the process of completing Mage Arena 2 but none of the staffs allow me to autocast the required spell? I am having to cast spells manually and my character keeps defaulting to walk to them rather than cast; resulting in me doing no damage.
---
Why on earth is there no autocast option for christ sake?
---
News flash: people fuck up.
---
Go quest. Your stats too weak to even kill green drags efficiently
---
Thurgo is love, Thurgo is life.
---
Ah man :( Yeah might as well just pass all the agility obstacles at that point. Can‚Äôt imagine that clue step comes up too often though
---
&gt; Yes, removing all non-pk content from pvp would be the best solution.
---
&gt; incentives to fight back
---
these are completely  2 different things. 
---
1. GL getting jagex to ever do it. If any they will just put more content there...
---
2. to incentive fighting back jagex would have to just incentive PVP for non-PVP players, and they dont want to do it. Just look how bad LMS rewards they are pooling.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt consider what he did a scam. He did a stream of taking donations for future content, and that‚Äôs what he did. But the content he did with the donated gold for wasn‚Äôt what people wanted, so they cried like the children they are. Then he also took a sponsorship from a gambling website, which doesn‚Äôt look good for a YouTuber who has a large younger audience. People just love being mad that‚Äôs about it.
---
Bud, here is what I'm going to tell you. If something sounds way too good to be true, it's probably bullshit. Whether it's "Show me your inventory and I'll give you free prayer pots" or "Whoever shows me a bank above 100m or more gets 10% of free" or something else of that nature.  
---
Just in case you don't understand these scams, in the first example you show scammer your inventory. Scammer puts up prayer potions and accepts. If you follow the accept, congratulations, you've scammed yourself basically. 
---
In the second example, Victim shows valuable bank in trade. Scammer sees idk, 170m in trade. Puts up 17m gp in the trade and accepts. If the victim accepts, scammed. 
---
*These people play on greed.* Keep this in mind so it doesn't happen again. There are a lot of different scams people will try to pull but as long as you know that base concept, you won't fall for them.
---
It was his clanmate who streamsniped him. gave everything back
---
As long as it's cosmetic only and can also be acquired outside of PvP I don't see anything wrong with it. It won't pass a poll if PvMers and skillers can't get it though.
---
Nothing wrong, just bad RNG. I myself went 80kc dry then got 4 items in 12 chests. It all evens out in the long run.
---
The rewards potential doesn't matter for barrows items, just for coins/runes/bolt racks. If you don't want bolt racks stop below 88% tho
---
There's other skull tricks too, like the ol running away and then having an account with close to the same name in the same gear run back towards the victim. Stuff like that is just stupid and deceptive but I have no idea how you would fix it
---
damn then maybe they went for the head,  they learned from thor attacking thanos
---
so now youre saying im ignoring something without pointing out what im ignoring lol, I addressed exactly what was commented.
---
no ask
---
don't really care if people mess up in cox ffa. its better pts/min for me. only a problem if they hard afk prep or spread burn
---
PoH for sure. It‚Äôs so nice being able to tele to your own house and have a pool, jewelry box, altar, fairy ring, and tele nexus all there for you. It‚Äôs gunna cost you a bit, but it‚Äôs so worth it!
---
lol
---
Yes, add fist of guthix also! ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
no. everyone either has to no-life, get lucky, or get donated to to have this kind of bank.
---
I mean you technically dont have to no-life, but if you weren't then it would be a longggg time till you got that much worth.
---
No they‚Äôre not. Just get better at duos.
---
Butt* dedication
---
How to enjoy the ride instead of rushing through everything
---
Rock &amp; roll only a couple minutes til it's all over
---
That‚Äôs the point of the alt, yo do the farming, scavs and pot making while you guys are doing the rooms. Only difference is olm will be scaled to 3 man raid. While learning it might be a little difficult especially if things aren‚Äôt going your way but you could see a boost in points that could make it worth it
---
Investing the 30m+ for a max house is so worth it. I don‚Äôt regret it even a little bit
---
I kill imps for fliers. Just so the pker gets something.
---
Cool story bro.
---
How do you have 70 prayer? O.o
---
I‚Äôll touch that point, if you go to the Wild with 3 items, be prepared to lose them.
---
I got hit about a year ago.   
---
I was an avid rider who did a lot of dirt bike riding and owned a sports bike and dirt bike only a few months ago, I've decided to sell both of them. Just got done selling the dirt bike the other day.    
---
I love riding but I'm willing to die, lose a limb or be permanently injured over it. Therefore, riding is a kick in the face to fate, saying 'it won't happen to me'. I actually got hit by a car last year. A car on the other side of the road turned into oncoming traffic at the last second. The fact that there was nothing I could have done to prevent that has completely ruined the false sense of security and safety I had while riding.  
---
In the space of what must have been about half a second before the collision so many things went through my head. I remember the feeling of the bike starting to slide sideways due to me locking up both wheels, even then managing to slightly lay off them to prevent lowsiding.  
---
I remember coming to terms with the fact that I was going to crash, There was a certain thought and feeling I had that was not a voice in my head, but spoke so much. It was along the lines of "This is going to happen", "This time I'm not getting away with it" (in reference to how many close calls you get on bikes on a daily basis, cars merging into your lane, pulling out etc), "I'm going to crash", and as cliche as it sounds "This is gonna hurt". All of those words and sentences were processed in that split second with a feeling rather than a voice. I assume it's some sort of instinctual thing related to the fight or flight reflex, where you don't have time to think via the vocal voice in your head.  
---
I was knocked unconscious and when I came round the woman was crying her eyes out thinking she killed me. Her face of horror is ingrained into my memory and is very traumatic to think about.       
---
     
---
She admitted to police she was texting or looking at her phone or something when it happened.    
---
    
---
I think that's what did it for me. It's just not worth it imo.    
---
For a lot, the love for riding is too strong and the pros outweigh the cons, but ever since meeting my girlfriend whom I plan to marry and have kids with I want to be there for my family in full, not a vegetable state or unable to play football because I was paralysed from the neck down or dead etc.    
---
I know it's probably not what you want to hear, but the possibility of this happening to you is very real. That person you hear about on the news who died, or old mate who's now in a wheelchair because of a motorcycle crash can be you. You can easily be that person.    
---
      
---
It's your choice to make, it's your risk to take. I really do advise you to do what you feel is best. So many people go through their lives loving riding a motorcycle and get away without permanent injury. As long as you have all the facts and know the risk then I'm happy.    
---
On a slightly unrelated note I remember doing my CBT in the UK, and despite the fact that 16 year old me was gassed (excited) that I could now ride my 50cc supermoto around, it is disgraceful. We should not be sending 16 year olds onto the roads on motorcycles with only a single days worth of training, only an hour of that being about road signs, how roundabouts work etc. Granted I picked it up quite fast, not everyone does.    
---
My mate ran two red lights on his CBT and still got the certificate. When I renewed mine before moving on to get my full license, someone who could barely control the bike by the end of the day was granted their certificate.  
---
Sorry for my ramble haha. Only meant for this to be a sentence or two.
---
Oh lol, nvm
---
you really think someone would stage a hit for.. 50m? thats like 20 euros lol
---
Yknow, im still just sitting here wondering the origin of the meme.
---
If i ask anymore though, im sure to get meme responses
---
Dumbass lol
---
Nope.
---
But that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
Fine by me I‚Äôll be out of wild after 99 pray
---
The supply cost is part of grinding anything endlessly though
---
The problem now is that PvPers have a smaller population than the rest of the players likely to vote in polls. And PvPers have backed themselves into a corner where no Wilderness revival poll would ever pass if it included rewards that could only be obtained by people that the 'no' voters despise.
---
Thought theres a current poll for cosmetic and exp rewards?
---
Hope you get out.
---
Uncharged time of fire tho?
---
lol dude the fuck
---
dont invalidate your own story

I was supper setting this with tricep extensions on the cables.  Hat bill gets in the way.  I don‚Äôt typically wear my hat backwards

PoH is already rich with a lot of useful content. No need to make it even better.

Should have just done sea slug
---
if it's not targeted harassment as in someone camps you deliberately to keep you from pking, then attacking people in a pvp area is all go lol
---
if you don't like being attacked in a pvp area, you have many options to avoid it or fight back. but yall choose complaining on reddit as your play ü§£
---
FBI Open up!
---
I must have been in heaven because he is God
---
Ride like everyone is trying to hit you
---
Don't worry, there will be another emotionally stunted, angst ridden PvMer to take your place. There's a lot of y'all running around, I don't discriminate
---
Imagine trying to gatekeep on the osrs reddit, don‚Äôt you have a defenseless Venezuelan to kill?
---
i wish i could be as wicked smart as you are with your proper grammar usage on the world wide internet
---
Gz! Also what‚Äôs the best way to fish here? About to go there on the iron, so I just zanaris bank it and run back? Also should I start at 65 or get a few more levels barbarian fishing?
---
performance points
---
pvmers are just mad they aren't as good as the pvpers, and therefore die all the time
---
rather than learn and improve, they spend even more time afk reading on reddit
---
So because of an integrity change you wont allow other players to have fun with new content?
---
Are you braindead?
---
Phase 3 was the only one I died in. That wave and one hit fireball combo would wreck me as I couldn‚Äôt dodge both. If you‚Äôve made it to stage 4, have u tried the running in circles while attacking during that stage?
---
gatekeep? do you know what that means lol? im roasting him dude, smarten up
---
he coulda had a maxed account dont mean shit, he clearly is a pussy nowadays
---
clue box protects your clues on death
---
haha no
---
Enjoy your spades my man, make sure you don‚Äôt misspell ‚Äúsit kid‚Äù. I know it‚Äôs hard for y‚Äôall.

A player owned harbour.
---
Nope and most likely those are phising emails tbh
---
I remember watching Ziz's stream that whole month and he seemed to be plunging further and further in to madness. Stay sane!
---
How did I invalidate my own story? The difference between pking today and in 2007 are totally different. I used to pk all the time bh craters, ep era and more and it was fun but now a days you have people world hopping looking for gearless people to try to make quick gp. I literally got barraged and 4 people logged in to barraged me for 25 dragon bones lol
---
They don't look at you, they look through you
---
Think it‚Äôs 50/50
---
I paid after watchtower
---
Yeah, and the account names don't really scream "bots". Not the usual "arltjdks63q" name. Seems like normal alts indeed.
---
ss created an incentive to flick all the times to heal, replaced guthans and food effectively because dps was huge and even a minor % leech was a lot of hp regen between and during kills
---
back then pot share OPness wasn't even mainstream for pvm
---
Ok voting no then for that next Pvmer
---
They arent. My username is visible in the email. I changed my pass with that link the first time and the pass change came through as well. I can show you a link and send it but I rather not. Because of them spamming requests my account has been locked once as well because jagex thought it was stolen. I had to change it then.
---
in 2007 there was no chaos altar, there wasnt as many bots and people didnt expect the whole game to be their safe place.
---
Thats what's different, the wet noodles for brains players.
---
Noone is forcing you to bank.
---
LMFAOO how does having a maxed account not mean shit? Is his spade collection too low to garner respect from the pvp population?
---
is rc snek
---
virgin vote no to pvp updates sit nerd
---
Ahh well the first part still is true that there is no way to change login
---
I'm looking for midlevel skilling money making methods. Any suggestions?
---
I feel great lol. I think I'm going to do a 24h for last day.
---
That‚Äôs not and integrity change is a straight up nerf to a tank item . Call it what it is please.
---
Can confirm, 50/50
---
okay, so you're saying we should not attack anybody who's "clearly" ungeared? so what's stopping megamind pvmers to just take off their gear, but risk stuff anyway?
---
killed enough "clearly unarmed" people to have learned always kill them, since every now and then they do risk a lot of items they didn't need to.
---
Okay sweet. I also have 3 full sets but no dharoks pieces
---
itsArmand
---
You don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm saying clearly. You don‚Äôt tele out after the first phase. You kills the resps, that spawns the boss. You kill the boss. New resps spawn, you kill those and as the boss is coming out THEN you poh tele, come back kill boss, kill the resp THEN poh tele. 
---
You lose 15-20 seconds per kill but it is made up by not having to bank for 10-15 kills, and you don‚Äôt use prayer potions. 
---
Idk why you‚Äôre getting so defensive
---
I just got one too.
---
Nah I don't PvP and I don't really care what they do. I'm just saying that the way they treat non-PKers has all but guaranteed no new content for them (at least through a poll). To get rewards now (through a poll), there isn't any logical way it would pass unless either non-PKers also had access to the rewards, or the rewards themselves couldn't be used outside of PvP.
---
Spite voters aren't in the business of voting in new items for the population of players they despise.

They're friends. Classix, the guy who killed him, is his clan leader. It's for jokes more than anything. It's like the 3rd time a Mod has pked him while he does clues.

Damn right brother 83 construction gang

Pretty sure the POH method is well known as the meta for killing sire dude, I was probably just too slow. I've killed a few more sire, teleing as soon as I see the red bar of the final resp system, and had no trouble so hopefully the problem was just that I was too slow.
---
But yeah, the POH method saves so much food and prayer pots it's so worth it.

Yes please. I will make this t-shirt.
---
it seemed you were implying that for such a small amount of money it wouldn't be worth it, and yet there are people who have done much worse for much less. I'm sure you don't think 20 euro is worth killing someone over either, and obviously there are easier ways to make it, but the point is there are people who would do it
---
I like how you left out exactly the part people are upset about. You‚Äôre leaving out the part where the money he got from donations were spent giving away to a scammer to see how far the scammer would take it.
---
I‚Äôm sure people that gave him money were expecting to see his classic loot videos or other things he might come up with, not literally giving it away to some sad scammer.
---
Don‚Äôt down play what he did as not shitty. It definitely was.

Clue box for wildy
---
I'm personally voting 'no' on any and all PK/Wilderness polls from here on out. If/when ones manages to pass a poll it's always so poorly handled and badly executed that Jagex as essentially just wasted a bunch of dev time on what amounts to dead content. This dev time could have been used on updates that are actually good and that many people want.
---
I don''t have a horse in the PvP race, I'm just tired of the waste of resources shoehorning this crap into the game. Dev time is finite. I only care about the allocation of dev time. I just personally feel that dev time spent on the Wilderness is almost always wasted.

Graceful, teleports, shovel and whatever they ask for to do the clue. If its a wildy clue I replace graceful with clue box
---
Well that was a dumb cluer
---
It plays on mobile for me but it seems you have a set pixel rate of movement for the tears rather than it being relative to view size? The tears come very hard and fast on mobile
---
Whoa now that's an epic gamer move
---
a man can dream
---
How am I proving your point when you have no point? You think people should quit because they die in pvp area while pvming or using beat In slot training methods? I was being mature by saying I‚Äôm entitled to voting no as you are to killing pvmers
---
You can high alc as you do quests (running around from place to place). it doesnt seem like much but after you do all the quests and diaries it is a lot.
---
you can also splash on the kraken boss, which gives you more xp than normally splashing. it gives you xp based on what you would have hit but the kraken boss will never take damage and never attack you
---
Id agree if it was reducing the cost to use, right now its just stupid expensive to use.
---
12 k a shard? Hmmm
---
someday, maybe. Which god should i pray to for luck until then? Zaros?
---
Dawg work on your reading comprehension, I don't even take the bones. The only drop I want is your tear drops hitting the floor as you realize you have been killed by another player in an area solely designed for players to kill other players.
---
Wouldn't they also smite you for your +1?
---
AND that's only 1/3 of the clue's step! Usually followed by going to the Lava Maze and the very end of the shadow dungeon from Desert Treasure.

Yes sir

you know, you‚Äôre not wrong. I play on my acer aspire from like 2007. But I‚Äôd like to use the gpu plugin, discord, music, Hulu, etc. on my current shitbox that all really slows down runelite
---
Taught me about the concept of luxuries and how to view money. 
---
Buying things like 3rd age are going to be awesome for a few weeks. But that pleasure you get out of it degrades. It works the same for similar items in real life like a new Rolex or nice car. Instead, just invest your money in things that will help you make more money or in experiences.

Yeah, I'll be wanting to hit mta sometime soon, but I'm pretty low on pretty much every rune other than air and mind, so I'm going to have to hold off on that for a while. I just hit 55, and can wizard mind bomb from 56 so I should be done with it pretty soon anyway.

&gt;Software engineers? So you take software and turn it into hardware? How does that work?
---
You can't lose hundreds of hours of progress for making a mistake in the DZ. It was also worth your time and you were never forced to go there.
---
What content is worth doing in the wildy? Revs was a step in the right direction but everything else is dead content and doesn't promote actual PVPing.
---
Oh and you can't be tricked to go rogue in the Dark Zone (not that it would matter) or get scouted by the level 3 bot of a 10 man team ready to fuck you up. So yes, the wildy is very unique.
---
I got one too like an hour ago. Went to the website, changed my password manually just to be safe. The mail I got (after requesting a password change myself from the OFFICIAL website) was from the same address and got listed under the same conversation. The fuck?
---
How much would u sell it to me for?
---
This comment Is so funny jesus
---
Yeah OP clearly doesnt seen that its not a normal trend marketwise but a shift due to new content demand. Blowpipe was bis at Hydra if youre too broke for tbow so there was a substantial amount of demand of scales.

Same exact thing just happened to me. I thought it might be the recently publicized Chegg leak, but my log-in email is not associated with that. Something related to Runescape must have just leaked emails.

See my reply to other dude, I only considered that after the fact :(

It's safe for normal gameplay, but it's extremely dangerous for any level of "FashionScaping" and should be avoided at all costs.

Another idea I was thinking, was make it so you can charge scythe only using vials of blood, making it slightly less powerful than charged with bloods and vials, but more powerful than it being completely uncharged.
---
It's legit. I got one recently too (within the past couple of hours) and I sent another. It came from the exact same address.
---
Something related to Runescape just leaked emails.
---
Once i did skotizo and got a wildy step for the clue. I didnt want to regear for my next skotizokill so i thought ill just do it in my skotizo gear lol

It's possible to spoof email addresses though, keep that in mind

While we're at it just make a teleport to clue dig spot spell. Having to actually run to the spot is just dumb and a waste of rc xp

Well alright then.
---
Damn I wish I knew the guy... may we continue playing in his honor
---
How else do I speak for people who can't speak for themselves
---
Blowpipe is so crazy powerful that you'd probably be better off just leaving the offhand in the bank
---
Runescape emails were recently leaked by a related service, so you should double check to make sure you can still access your account.
---
If it's a skill you planned to level organically at some point, any point in the future really (even years), it's fundamentally inefficient to ever bother with random event XP. If it's a skill you refuse to ever touch no matter what, yeah I agree I don't see why you would shoo it away. Say Runecrafting makes you literally suicidal? Toss some lamps in it. If you ever planned on making even a few air runes though, you're already wasting your time by collecting the lamp.
---
Your display name same as your login?
---
Oh yeah definitely just for jad lol. I appreciate your offer (: i actually just got an archers ring+bgloves so the run should be pretty smooth
---
People love gambling, and there is enough skill in RS pvp to let a skilled player win more often than ot versus less skilled players. It's entirely uncompetitive in equal skill levels, but most people love beating lesser players for rewards in any game and this one has gambling added on too so double dopamine hit on every kill.
---
Wholesome minus the weeb shit on the other monitor.
---
Non-stop firing with amethyst arrows is only ~90k/hr with an accumulator or like 65k with assembler, for a fairly significant increase in damage output against almost all slayer monsters. It's the exact same argument of rcb vs bp, but less extreme.
---
Pets are very rare. Certain skills have pets and certain bosses have pets. When doing that skill, saying catching a fish here, you roll a very small chance on the pet drop table. Idk if you used the wiki back in the day but it‚Äôs the go to source for info. You can see the exact rates on there for each activity. You can have one pet active at a time and they can be insured. They‚Äôre meant to show off basically.

Sorry for your loss, thanks for the wholesome post. I've never had to go through anyone dying other than my grandparents but I was young it didn't really sink in

Well before I developed physical illness I was very productive but now that I can barely do things outside of bed without having GI issues it's been very difficult. I need to recognize my limits ya know
---
While the logic is sound in your argument,  I think you‚Äôre missing the fact that wouldn‚Äôt the old school team change the rewards? I‚Äôm pretty confident that anything that would boost exp wouldn‚Äôt make it in the game and as a result we‚Äôd have the mini game we like and better suited rewards. What those rewards would be beats me, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something possible.

---
Black demons are good xp, if you want money do demonic gorrilas on your black demon task. Thats not actually that bad of loot from a black demon task I usually get less. Theres potetial bank in that clue plus totems give you skotizo kills
---
Theyre already deep i mean like 28-35. You mean in single somewhere else?
---
Jagex please consider putting every farmable NPC into deep wilderness as this would cut down on gold farming. 
---
Revs are 28-33 wilderness as is. Gold Farmers/Venes are free pks, moving them deeper wouldn‚Äôt help.
---
Yeah, switches and prayers are totally nontransferrable.
---
Isn‚Äôt it always the same amount of runes even if you splash?
---
I am doubtful cheat clients are affecting the rate coming into the game. Most of the people that use those are absolutely terrible and still less efficient than max groups running tob.
---
Prioritizing dps over defense is the meta and such prayers would be OP
---
Real dads gaming
---
Honestly. I got this board from a friend and I didn't really build one myself. Headover to r/mk there's a ton of much more knowledgeable people who'd help
---
Sure, that's what i did, got bored of zerker pretty quickly, imo rigour is just a more fun &amp;  better overall build.
---
He's nervous
---
Do 75 def 77 prayer rigour augury way less limited than a zerker
---
Can you ‚Äúhot switch‚Äù so you don‚Äôt have to hold the FN key? (I play osrs and F keys are crucial)
---
Actually not true.  I have friends who do record runs and their whole team uses the client.  Getting the record without the client would be almost impossible now.
---
Can you right click to tele to the portal? I thought you could but have t played recently brought to know for sure.
---
I feel like its a little unbalanced... We get so many of a house's benefits for nothing
---
...That‚Äôs not at all how leveling in this game works. Halfway to 99 is 49.5. Halfway to the level 99 in RS is 92 with how the exp curve is handled.
---
It takes a few hours to make that much money
---
For sure. Almost feels like cheating
---
Does that require you to log in though?
---
s
---
Because they would be getting killed way more cause there out in 45-50 wilderness and it would make it so there way more people in deep wilderness trying to kill people killing revs
---
Wrong leveeeeeerrrr!
---
Your anger doesn't drive me to PK. However, it does drive me to keep PKing PvMers. There's something about those extra salty PvM tears that's just so damn tasty. 
---
Just let me know what world you're running bones in and I'll come pay you a visit ;)
---
They need to stop pushing pvp vs pvm updates and start updating pvp so that it is more fun for the people actually doing the player killing! 
---
Pking has such potential to become a competitive esport - there are so many variations. 
---
The wilderness is supposed to be high risk high reward, but in my eyes hunting people in welfare gear (woo glory pk off guy in Veracruz?) isn‚Äôt what the future of pking should be built off of. However it also shouldn‚Äôt be neglected
---
Authenticator would be great if it had a delay! Sorry I had to. I do have authenticator though but had no idea anybody could initiate a password reset. Starting to seem like runelite had a data leak and a bot is going through trying to hijack accounts. Luckily my email account has 2 factor as well so they will never be able to reset my password that way. That makes me feel a lot safer.
---
This is essentially the same mindset that goes into gambling.
---
No but the friend that introduced me the game back in like 2004 wasn't allowed to keep playing after like two months because he computer could be infected by the game or something.
---
It's how numbers work. 99/2 is in fact about 49.5. I'm 50+ in all skills, so I am halfway to max.
---
this some autechre shit
---
Cant say my parents ever blamed me for it but they have definately have similar issues. The older generations dont generally have a clue what they are doing on a computer and look for any excuse but themselves for their incompetence. 
---
That being said some, like my parents can recognize this and will actually listen to someone who clearly knows better. (Helps I am in IT)
---
That just leaves the wilderness dead though, the point is to get people who don't already pvp into pvp.
---
Let the anger flow through you, give in to your anger!
---
"halfway"
---
PvP'ers dont want to fight each other. The majority just enjoy fighting people who don't fight back.
---
Jagex is doing a really good job of splitting the PvP community even further though adding all these different activities in difference places. Then only to turn around and wonder why all of them "feel dead".
---
Shutting down deadman was a good step, but trying to salvage LMS to essentially replace it is the same issue.
---
The people interested in PvP is already a small minority, stop splitting them between so many different areas (Deep wild, revs, BH, LMS).
---
Instead though Jagex is throwing more lootboxes at LMS and BH hoping that will "fix the problem".
---
When its likely just going to create another massive issue and destroy some more markets.
---
PvP's profit should come from taking items away from other players, not generating wealth out of nowhere. It's like 76king all over again.
---
Similar thing happening to me - it's my main email but a insignificant account so that suggests its from somewhere I put my email previously being leaked and someone indiscriminately mass sending reset requests.
---
Cus you fingered your arsehole in front of her while humming sea shanty and aren‚Äôt aloud over anymore?

Another to watch out for is there is a fake Old School Runescape facebook page advertising 2x exp and a poll to gauge the amount of interest in a 2011 based server, both requiring login.
---
Why the fuck are you automatically assuming he kills naked clue scrollers where did he say that lmao
---
Keep it 60. I run a max zerk and get spanked every time in a NH scenario.

If I said W132 would that ring any bells?
---
Most places graceful is used stam pots are used too so you never get the regen effect
---
you prob dont but you do care about pvp updates which will fail
---
Glad life is going well for you and you have something in your life really motivating you. However i cant help but worry as this seems really unhealthy man. Best of luck to you going forward but definitely dont let this game consume your life for the sake of beating records.
---
So let me get this straight, Your trying to say you shouldn't get skull tricked because you should have attack off, but also encouraging people to fight back and calling them bad for getting skull tricked and just sacks of meat to be looted.
---
How about you make up your goddamn mind.

your pussyness after responding to me for the past 6 hours disgusts me

This is fighting kolodion not casting 100 times...

In high school I had a friend's whole family blame me for slowing down and putting viruses on their computer because they gave me the wifi password for my laptop.

Do as many of the boss as you can handle, it's just so boring to do you probably won't enjoy it very much.

As an admin of the OSRS Veterans page, I would like to say, thank you to everyone for responding such positivity and respects to us during our time of need. His funeral was just held this morning, and some members of the group drove 5-15 hours away to attend.
---
There is going to be an in-game funeral held for him tomorrow at 9PM CST. I'm not sure if there is any drop parties planned, but as of right now I do not believe so. We want everybody to get together to celebrate the life and opportunities that Mike has given us, as well as him being the one to create the group that we have all came to love, and met my second "family" from. I have drove 6 hours out to meet up with a few members of this group, as well as flew out to Denver, Colorado to hang out with Mike and another admin.
---
Side note: I am on mobile right now, so I will do my best to post any pictures if possible. I just have to figure out this atrocity of an app
---
Thanks! I did a lot of prep and full understanding of the risk. I don't ever plan on holding this record if its broken. 30 days is a long time to AFK life lol

Why‚Äôd you make sausage rolls lol?

just as rare as any other combination of clue rewards.

---
You're welcome! lol
---
Exactly. And the thing is, with pvp since its a player vs another player its easy to see when things are OP. Its not like in pvm the monster is complaining that theyre dying too fast lmao. Pvmers need to understand integrity in pvp means balance.

Also checked email, got no recovery attempt, not yet at least :P

---
I'm glad you got hacked. Wish you would have gotten perm-banned as well.. it's a shame.
---
It should have cheaper maintenance thats for sure, maybe a ibetween mode where its between max dps and a rapier..
---
or wathever it will keep dropping in price
---
after you leave do you need to use another or is it a one and done type thing, i havent tried out grotesque guardians yet.
---
nah dude its fine trust me im an expert
---
I think you forgot the whole 4 months bit. So yeah that's pretty grindy.
---
Ah! Good news :P.
---
You are officially my hero. Thank you!
---
Yes its a fucking nerf you dumb fuck. For integrity reasons. Bulwark was too OP, it was imbalanced for pvp. If you pked, you would understand. Since you dont, shut the fuck up
---
Gz@!@!@
---
If you're thinking of starting one but worried about the time/effort to reach end game then I'd suggest ignoring that aspect of the game and just shooting for small goals. It all adds up over time. Low level content differs a lot between normies and iron memes.
---

You are completely retarded. Try to understand what im about to say. Read it multiple times. You can still use the bulwark. Its still good. Its still good bro. Its just more balances. Its not nerfed to a fucking wooden shield. Its stats are slightly changed to make it a more balanced item in pvp scenarios. Its still good bro! You're fucking retarded!
---
Bro I already told you the only thing I'm after is your delicious, delicious tears of anger. Why do you keep giving them up so easily? I've never had 1 PvMer supply me with so many of his extra salty tears. I'd drink some water if I were you right now to stay hydrated, you've been leaking tears for hours.

Yeah allow me to stare at the screen watching my entire 360¬∞ surroundings with my cursor over the logout button the entire time I'm in the wilderness so I can log out within 1.5 seconds in case someone anywhere near me logs in. Yeah, that's realistic.
---
Reminds me of Metal Gear Solid on ps1/2
---
Why wait, be the change you wanna see
---
lol price crashes so you want to buff it and in turn have the price go back up. Scythe is fine, you‚Äôre just poor.
---
Is there a longer recording of this? Sounded quite nice.
---
Reminded me of bf3
---
Your +1 is a dragon dagger / Gmaul in this scenario. Hopefully you don‚Äôt bring +1‚Äôs to revs solo
---
'kill the spinners' sounds like master level clue with high requirements. Stop catering to the endgame
---
Show us your ironman bud
---
~~Fuck you~~
---
No but seriously gz!
---
The middle one was just a bug it seems.. Magically started to work again for people.
---
There is a Twitch clip in the comments if you don‚Äôt believe me.
---
so some streamer had his friend kill him doing a clue to clip reaction and post to reddit to advertise stream? lol
---
It's not against the rules.
---
&gt;RNG dictates pretty much everything in this game. Even the absolute best players can just get screwed by poor rolls. 
---
I have mostly mastered the art of kicking Vorkath's teeth in.  I fight him with Netflix open and spend as much time watching tv as I do watching the fight.  But every once in a while he spams his magic attack, and they just keep hitting, and all the splats are over 30, and I'm sitting there power-eating sharks trying to keep up.  
---
I'm not complaining, that's just the way things go when all of our damage is determined by dice rolls.  But I'm not interested in participating in a PVP fight where a series of specs might be able to kill a maxed potted player or bounce off a noob, depending on the dice roll.
---
That‚Äôs cool. Random/slightly exciting thing that doesn‚Äôt cost money or really change gameplay.
---
Edit: I didn‚Äôt say thank you. Thank you!
---
Are you secretly working for Glough?
---
Ah. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Wooosh
---
I'm confused how you even know you were breached. It doesn't sound like you were hacked?
---
The boys look huge.
---
They're like fire giants 2.0
---
looks painful
---
Ironman can get slapped in regular worlds too, are you scared or something?
---
Just finished Jad today at 73 hp, yeah it costs a lot and dying to him is very frustrating. Remember you can pause the game by logging out. My advice would be to just sstay calm and focus on jad 95% of the time. Say the prayer as it is happening. To get the healers try moving just once after each of his attacks, until you are close enough to the healers to kill them. 
---
Breathe man you can do it!!
---
Why doesnt this happen for other mmos? oh right if your wow/ff14/guildwars account is compromised it isnt compromised forever like it is with osrs since those games have dedicated teams paid by part of the subscription fee
---
You don't have an ornate jewelry box with 2100 total?
---
Show this to Rezz and she might complete the soundtrack
---
Just take it super slow, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the healers heal him to full as long as you pull them without killing them (you won‚Äôt kill them if you take time to switch back to Jad between each pull).  Focus on the prayer switches above everything, you have more than enough time.
---
I'm not accusing them, I just don't trust them.
---
F
---
Yes because somebody who comes back after months of not playing instantly knows how to do that amirite?
---
This is a scam don‚Äôt fall for it
---
running perfectly fine for me.
---
You need to do it once after the puzzle part.
---
I get them all the time. Always log onto the runescape website and check your account details before checking these.
---
Oh thank god it isn't just me, I thought it was my internet
---
Nah you enter the death altar during the quest. I have all of the hard requirements it's just the music track from visiting the death altar during the quest. You do need it for the diary though
---
As somebody who occasionally turns public chat off, yes I would play on an empty world.
---
What do you limit it to?
---
This. 
---
Ps. Bulwark bad, black d‚Äôhide bad, pvm bad, wildy dead, PvP good.

0.7% of the way there :p

I got an email today on my old email - only use if for Facebook and apparently an RS account.  It's an @live.com account (Microsoft/hotmail account) so I don't think Google had anything to do with it.
---
my bank pin was delayed cancellation...
---
thankfully everything was banked, password, and email were the same.. my account is safe in terms of my items...
---
how ever someone managed to get on and cancel my pin [attempt]... i got the message in time.
---
üíô

nah but obviously you are if you only willing to fight when you have the advantage
---
Sounds like my jam

Ring of suffering and tormented bracelet both a higher priority than an amulet of torture? Surprised by that

I just realised I just got scammed by this thing. I don't play runescape for like a few months or so but now I just started receiving these mails and I thought that for real, stuff is happening. :D
---
Well, gg.
---
Ya those FOOLS don't know that you can show Lanthus your assembler to give you the ammo saving effect.
---
Main game is still rs3, whatever your opinion is doesn't matter, cause it's a fact. And rs3 servers are far from dead lol.
---
There's no 99 strength buttt yeah
---
Now you just gotta ask Mod Ash how to sell gf
---
Would you be willing to share the art assets you used for this, please? I'd love to recreate this with Godot as a personal project. It's okay if not, of course.

Nh at wests is what im talking about
---
Hmmm... Human music?

Nice one man, feel like mm is hailed as being difficult for no reason. The run through the caves is the worst part. Gz anyways my man

Nicee

Recurring payments only

what

Listed GE price on the essence is unreliable because the quantity traded is so low. Most people will just make the staff and sell the staff. The listed GE price is under 400k but ge-tracker has the buy price at around 7.8m which is pretty much the same as the staff.

Do it

That‚Äôs kinda what I figured but I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances

Go for it

Why don't 10/10 dentist's recommend Crest pro health?
---
No but seriously, is there truly a difference between tooth pastes? What tooth paste do you use? What is your routine throughout the day to take care of your teeth?

He's not though. To get that sort of gold takes a high level account which takes ages to get

I love me some runescape extratone

Started making maps for DnD and decided to practice on already existing places.
---
I'd love to eventually make a full map of OSRS like this.
---
You hover over or click on the letters.
---
However, the KEY point im trying to make, and that i think you're missing, is that this kind of IN-GAME behavior is happening in 
---
THE WILDERNESS. 
---
Phishing and Skulltricking are about as similar as apples and oranges.
---
The bottom line is you can't skull trick somebody ANYWHERE outside of the wilderness/PvP zones, 
---
and if being skulled unintentionally is too much of a risk to incur, the wilderness is too wild for ya.
---
Oh, wow. I thought you had to bring logs and do the puzzle every time, and I was like...no wonder nobody uses this transport system.
---
I'm such a noob. Thanks.
---
Cheddar for me, cant wait to get 160 infernal mages.
---
It's called Lyzrdlite.  I probably shouldn't advertise it but just remember use at your own risk blah blah blah... you know.
---
Gotcha ok. Nah IP doesnt matter. In this case your email is conpromised. Probably happened from you using your email somewhere that had a security breach at some point. Unfortunately if they have access to ur email they have access to everything. They can change ur password and remove authenticator no problem since thats all done from your email address. Change ur password ASAP for ur email. Add 2 factor for ur email adress along for ur osrs account. Look into switching your email for ur osrs account as well. Good luck man.
---
Rip! He's in a better place now!
---
My phone does when playing and charging at the same time.
---
PvM and PvP aren‚Äôt exclusive communities. People are just dumb.
---
it‚Äôs likely to be a skulltrick.
---
Here‚Äôs how it would go down:
---
1. You kill him
---
2. You see some loot
---
3. You spam click the loot to pick it up
---
4. His alt logs in right on the loot, and if you don‚Äôt have player attack option to ‚Äúright click‚Äù or ‚Äúhidden‚Äù, you attack him and skull on him
---
5. He kills you
---
MAGIC ROCK MAKE BAD LOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Because TubbyRS doesn't like rulite users. A report is a report and there's always a chance to get banned by mistake.
---
My mistake, wiki was only giving me the values for the individual mobs. You likely can finish the entire task in the time it takes to get 15 KC fwiw.
---
I only learned about that last week! It‚Äôs crazy all the small stuff people don‚Äôt know about.
---
Ok, but luring, BH multi abuse, tree safe spotting are all in game mechanics as well, so I don't accept that as a fair argument on why it should stay.  
---
Saying that the wilderness is too wild is fairly condescending, I've seen plenty of high level pkers complain about various wilderness mechanics, is the wild too wild for them too?  Like, pjing timer is a in game mechanic, in wild, that isn't exploiting anything, yet people acknowledge that as an issue, so the part I don't understand is why  skull trick scamming is still heavily defended unlike those other wildy issues.
---
mission accomplished
---
? his mods/clanmates kill him on stream all the time for jokes lol,they gave all the shit back. Nobody was being an asshole
---
Lmaoooooooo
---
Ok cool, make an account under lvl 90 and lets go
---
Solid point. Both communities need to grow a pair. Valid comment.
---
Love finding arrows and shoving them up my ass LOL
---
This is not a ''Rip rng''. This is what people wish they could waste their rng on.
---
Tick manipulation is possible, it's just harder to nail the crossover to the third tree because it requires moving to another tile then to the tree on specific ticks or you mess up the bunnies.
---
That was deep, but true
---
The point really activated my sphincter xx
---
i got the same email but they sent it to my old address, i switched my emails a few months ago so if they did a reset they would send it to that one instead right? kind of confirms it as a scam for me
---
Really tickled my prostate

Good you ass

His face is why I love his stream

Fuck boys

My cock is uncut

When I see your mom‚Äôs ass

lolololol im an ironman you want to fight its tourney world or my ironman you chose either way you will fucking lose
---
I love dick cheese
---
The absolute Chads on this sub bashing people out of of bis gear is why the playerbase is shrinking. We are so toxic to new 0layers that no one stays to learn the game.
---
:o indeed, I didnt know that! Good luck all the same friend, you got this!
---
Is this all hand-drawn?
---
Look pal we agree here I think the current wildy is garbage game design, a pvp area in a pvm zone is obviously nothing special but the execution is...uniquely bad which is why we don't see more of it.  
---
You have a dangerous area where people can lose tens (or hundreds for the daring) of millions of GP worth of gear because of a bad dice roll, so on top of losing the time you spent in there you're losing the hours it took you to grind for the gear **outside** the wildy.  
---
So most people are going to enter the wildy in some type of welfare gear, defeating the entire purpose of having a high risk area. The wildy is a pretty shite and toxic place and has always been, it's impossible to fix with how the game works (especially with our stubborn community).  
---
If it was up to me I'd simply remove the PVP aspect of the wildy and keep it to the PVP worlds where seeing a white dot dashing towards me in the middle of nowhere is actually exciting as opposed to annoying but that would never pass a poll.
---
My old PC used to keep doing this. It would crash then make those weird sounds. Anyone know what causes this?
---
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis 2 Nieve??
---
Why would he wish that upon her? She‚Äôs the best
---
Yeah I was gonna try to get enough marks of grace before switching to that cause I wanna get the graceful outfit or whatever
---
Jalape√±o
---
Even if your email login is leaked you‚Äôre still safe assuming you have all the safeguards in place. Just don‚Äôt click on links that you didn‚Äôt request.
---
Settle down there slugger, I just told you what to do
---
This should be when a hcim loses their status
---
Mains also blowpipe/cannon a lot more for general use stuff like slayer.
---
Old but gold
---
well at least you nailed the unpopular opinion part
---
Where will the in-game funeral be, would like to come pay my respects.
---
Lol what? If you can find a single instance of someone donating sparc mac anything other than osrs party hats for his collection, I‚Äôll apologize. Dude gives away like 2B a week to his subs as well.
---
Why? If my blizzard account gets hacked i can just get blizzard to restore it to the way it was before it was hacked no questions asked
---
I'd be fine with it.  Goals are nice to have.
---
The daganoth kings one is my least favourite clue in the entire game. First I forgot my fking pet rock... then I forgot my throwing axes... then I didn‚Äôt bring enough food/prayer pots and when I finally got to the fucking spot I realised I forgot my spade. I just logged off immediately
---
I suspect your account wasn‚Äôt as accomplished as you may feel it was
---
Yeah I understand is crazy unpopular opinion, but tbh no matter what they do to the wildy people will be unhappy so every suggestions is unpopular ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Although I agree, it also sounds like the prequel to ‚ÄúMy 600 pound life‚Äù
---
You're only proving how little you know about the tech behind this stuff. Jagex would have to rebuild OSRS from the ground up in order to put in a system like Warden. Its not possible to do, no is it worth it.
---
Looks at least partially digital. Some of the trees are replicated
---
And your point is? I've been playing since 2014.
---
I was able to max even with a full time job.
---
You can never be halfway there.
---
Did you just click the link or did you click and enter in a new password?
---
Could you change your password again from the official RS site?
---
No accounts are safe these days. If at any point your real life info is ever leaked, that is ALL anyone needs to recover your account. And once an account has been recovered, it'll never be safe again.
---
Kinda upset you didnt say "stay sane, Exile!" Due to the fact Ziz plays PoE
---
he doesn't even show emotion
---
Riighht..when people are playing a game in 2019 they started in 1999-2002 ish. Ok lmao
---
Good bot
---
Still better than me when actually trying
---
&gt; gmail
---
Not sure if intentional or not
---
Some kid shown me max cash saying "you wish you had this eh?" So i said "hold on" got mine, traded shown him mine 14.75B, i said "You wish you had this eh?"  He went quiet. Wish I had that recorded, why don't i record...funny stuff happens when I'm not recording.
---
Your shit should never be leaked in the first place if you legitimately use your email for your account and nothing else. Don‚Äôt touch it ever again.
---
Slayer bois when they see a mutated bloodveld üçë
---
Day 78: Yeah still can‚Äôt unsee this from the first time it was mentioned.
---
35m? For a fully maxed house? Nah dude way more than that, 35m maybe just for the con xp.
---
Like zoom into your inventory???
---
Ok good luck to ya
---
Gz
---
Bots that grab arrows? Never heard of that before. Thought bots just took resource nodes
---
Dude, exactly the same, helped me a lot!
---
How do you run it?
---
he probably got skull tricked
---
Dont log in to the website it leads you to. If you already did, change pass asap (and pin if you got tricked into putting it in)
---
There is? I've always walked to draynor to deposit...
---
Nah, lanthus is the dude who runs castle wars, show him your Ava and he‚Äôll let you use the castle wars cape as an ava
---
Hell yeah I did. :D
---
Ummm, that account was bought. Idk if it's due to owner recovering it or this link working but I don't have it no more.
---
Work up your cooking. At higher lvls it will make decent profit.
---
I too lost motivation a few months im 121 cb and like 96 slayer should really get back into it and finish it off but I have no friends that play so its kinda boring:(
---
&gt; I guess that makes sense
---
????
---
May want to cover yourself though with Jagex if you are going to be profiting off of their property. 
---
I would love a version of this https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/World_map#/media/File:Gielinor_map_poster.png in your style though, wouldn't have to be as detailed as your shilo map though. The only issue I have with this map is the RS2/RS3 stuff that isn't in OSRS (and wouldn't be in it, ex: I'm okay with menaphos, but not daemonheim or soul wars)
---
oh so he has a lot more than 50b rs3 now but what about his osrs bank?
---
Damn, sounds like a great guy. Rest in Peace Mike
---
This rifht here. Jad doesn‚Äôt have a ton of hp to begin with and it will more than likely get healed to full anyways.
---
Sounds like normal dialup toned down about half

i have a gtx 950 and the gpu plugin was working perfectly fine until today

---
This was me like one week ago lol, now I have a bond tho -3-
---
This is cool, reminds me of african villages where huts are spaced out a lot and patches of trees and bushes grow in the unused space. Just the wooden fence doesn't fit, but that's how runescape is.
---
You literally broke the game
---
After how many regulars did you start doing corrupted?
---
Fashionscape
---
It wasn't created for it's graphical supuriority there little buddy.  It was created due to its pre-eoc mechanics. A side benefit was the pre-loot share economy.
---
But yeah, hey, let's act like children and call each other names.  That works too.
---
I still feel weird seeing poe references outside of the subreddit, even though its pretty big now.
---
Ah. I also forgot about the cunts who cheat in pvp. Certain things like having auto kicker, auto dispell. Ownedcore is a website where you can search a good chunk of botting crap or other cheap nonsense.
---
Hotline Mining
---
You know I feel like that's a problem too. I find myself logging in, checking my friends list, walking around G.E. and logging
---
Why do you go to CoX? To get that rare Tbow which doesn‚Äôt happen often. But you still open the chest.
---
Holy fuck, the mad lad did it
---
How to get a friend who doesn't have a job, doesn't get hacked and doesn't burn out?
---
That is all at once? Im sure you could drink more over an hour or so... Ive seen people do that with beer.
---
I think as raids are added to the game, and with them endgame pvm rewards, raids 1 will turn into that. It kinda already has
---
You should do the rice cup method for effective kills you need an ornate pool and fairy ring
---
Mammals reactions are all so extreme but you know it‚Äôs genuine dude loves the game

Looks sick

Couldn‚Äôt clicking a link alone compromise you though?
