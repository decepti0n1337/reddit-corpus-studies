Stands for death dot, usually that term is used when a team pks and all stand in the same spot so it looks like 1 player on minimap. I guess it could also be used to describe when you stand under your opponent in a 1v1 when he's frozen to hide your switches, which was how he was using the term.

Bump, what's the status of this poll? Can we have the results?

Came here to say this.
---
Then don't play ironman if it's so easy and unfair with alts and all that, nobody forces you to. 
---

---
Be happy instead that you can work at mcdonalds for a couple days and buy bonds for what you earned and buy bis gear from ge instantly or bankstand a lot of skills. Seems pretty fair to me.

nUh UH U c@n'T pR0t muh attAAAAAAACKS1! maaaaaaaaaaaaahm! get jamflex daddy to b@n th15 k11$d! Clan wars and the duel arena have the things you're looking for regarding yes/no on prayers/overheads/other specific fight rules. It's just that people spam 50/50 no movement gamble fights instead of DUELING and that is why the sand casino sucks.

So there's a 1 in 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000 chance of me shuffling a deck of cards in a specific order?
---
Do you think it would be fair to increase DWH drop rate to something like that, or would it become ez scape?
---
No, you don't. 
---
There's 50 cards to choose from on the flop, not 52 (because you already know your KK).
---
46 of the cards are K or lower (50 - the 4 aces). Thus 46/50 for the first card dealt. If it isn't an ace, theres now 45 from 49 to choose from, thus 45/49, same for the 3rd card.

I had one of those auto generated names back in the day, it was "34 Nearly".  Got made fun on a lot by randoms and I hate it it. That thought me the lesson to not get myself reported so I can re change my name for free.

Can do it easily with rune crossbow

Anti fire potion+shield completely blocks that fire damage.

Yeah I would do salamanders if money is an issue

Guidesforusall just made a video on it. It’s alright I guess. I think the rewards are okay but could be toned down a bit. They give you a free set of iron right off the bat.

If you've bought more than the trade limit, and the price is below your offer when the trade limit resets, you get the current high price.

This happens all the time with the alchables I leave in offers for, just at more reasonable prices. But I do save 100-200 gp per item on average pretty often because of it.

He’s placing the comma at the end of the sentence which is why it’s followed by a period.

big difference between going into the wild and getting lured to getting attacked by lllllillllill and then fighting back and hitting llillllllill.
---
Twice a week in the pure scene. F2p Saturday and P2P Sunday.
---
I hate all non-combats on my main.  I enjoy them in iron man mode (except for rc and agility, which always suck) though.    
---
Non-combats are functionally useless, except for to unlock diaries which feels like forced content.  Besides diaries, they are merely ways to gain resources, which can just be bought.  That's why the game feels more "whole" on an iron.
---
crushing attacks were the most affetive against plate armor
---
Stand and deliver!
---
I believe you have a Diamond of Blood!

They’ve spoken about this before. The way the music actually works is really janky. Ash has said he’d like to do things like this (specifically creating a queue iirc) but it’s just not in the cards any time soon.
---
String amulets, cut mahogany logs then plank make them. High alchemy things that cover the loss of runes. 
---
Magic is an easy way to make money, but it takes a bit and it’s generally fun.
---
None of which proves you are the original owner of the account so it means nothing at all
---
Haha, that's what I ended up doing for mine. Man was it painful going in and out hoping for a ruby spec. I think it took me like 20 minutes plus the time of hopping worlds.
---
Kinda his own fault for going to the wild on a HC. Was c engineer a dick for hunting them, yes. I'm sure hes not the only one that hunts ironmen and hardcores in specific
---
I disagree on the basis of that massively slowing down the workflow.  It already took them 6 months to do SOTE and having to poll every asset when they want to add a new area would make that time even longer.  The rate as which new, meaningful (so not you Zeah quests) quests are added to the game is already abysmal.  
---
Though I do think in the future they will at least show concept art in the poll blog.  They did post their art while it was in progress and asked for feedback but it wasn't well advertised.
---
It was 1m pre update. 2m ish post update. Kill takes around 20 mins in max gear kiting it. I have like 7kc.
---
It's 35 (14+15+6) different helmets, 35 platebodies and 35 shields. Then it's 20 different legs and 20 skirts (28+12 for both). Yeah wasn't very clear in the original comment.
---
IMO, your best bet is to camp sub-30 on an unskulled low 70s combat account with 89 agility using a regular world. 
---
I was also contemplating an account with like 50 defence for granite legs/shield as a tank switch. Without melee stats or prayer, your account would be mid/low 80 cmbs . You can sit sub 30 and be safe from mains, and you should have enough ranged defence to tank bolts from pures until you can make it across the jump. You wont have rigour/bulwark/overheads which hurts but it might work. If you got 40 prayer for prot range, you'd be 90 cmb which is worse but honestly might be worth it.
---
Bursting during slayer is relatively close to break-even, at least Dust Devils and Nechs. You can burst them off task as well but it's not as fast and more expensive.
---
yup. almost died on hc in wintertodt. fucking jamflex
---
Nice
---
Youre welcome
---
To matter what he did, someone was gonna say it looks like shit.  There's literally no way Jagex can salvage this beyond putting a bandage on the worst and moving on.  The toothpaste is out of the tube.
---
Thanks! Don't suggest garbage next time!
---
35% of all statistics are bullshit.
---
Like, how many people does he think have only completed 9 masters. What a shmoe!
---
D
---
He took the kill like a sport and he's playing on his now normal ironman, but it's the harassment that followed that I want to discuss.
---
My thoughts are not everything needs to be policed and carefully stepped around to protect people's feelings. Sucks for the guy but he can deal with no public chat and friends to private for a little bit. Or he can name change. He's got a dumb meme name anyway.
---
I mean dmm relives this same thing and it grew boring stupidly fast for me. Long term goals are far more interesting than short term hype rush for a couple of days.
---
Barrows gets boring once you do it a lot.    
---
I am really looking forward to it on my iron though.  The satisfaction of completing sets just can't be had on a main.
---
In 2012 we missed 2007, in 2019 we miss 2012
---
I agree.  Slayer can really put you in a nasty rut with a streak of tasks you don't want to do.
---
At lvl 99 farming, what's the best herb to farm for best GP/HR?
---
chaotic maul was dead content except that people were fucking awful at the game so they still bought it.
---
Now that's a tough family
---
Literally everyone online is like this get used to it lol
---
I started an HCIM some months ago, died stupidly at 950 total, decided, fuck it, I won't make it far on a hardcore anyways, and I didn't have an ironman before that, so now I'm just staying on it as a regular old ironman.
---
Can someone make this but in 1920x1080?
---
RS2 had a feature where you could add songs to your playlist (although you could only have one playlist, so it was more like "favouriting" them), and then shuffle them. I think this would be a really good addition.
---
I always tell new people to it that if they have a regular ironman already their time is better invested there. I made a HC and went till I died and now it's just my regular 
---
Too bad I DC'd and died to a skilling boss tho amirite
---
Don't be afraid to stick to your combat/regen bracelet. Barrows gloves are SUPER overrated. It's not BIS for mage or melee and only give you an TINY +1 range over vambs. 
---
Let that sink in.
---
Possibly the most rated piece of gear in RS.
---
Alching
---
Interesting. Then that is a bit strange of a choice. However, it is worth remembering that they are just starting to test this and they are doing stuff like AB Testing. So one player may get the "members get 500 coins" while another may not; some others won't get the Adventure Paths at all. They will be trying different variants to see what works best.
---
Though I wouldn't say this isn't worth discussing. A "get membership for more free stuff" message is a bit iffy and may not invoke the right things about membership or the game as a whole. But membership is pretty obvious from F2P already with all the things that can prompt a "you need membership for this" message. So we'll have to wait and see if this sticks around.
---
Smithing and crafting interfaces are a dream come true, can we do the same for sawmill operators?   
---
I just cut and made 12,000 oak planks on the ironman for construction XP, It wasn't so bad with 3rd party clients on PC but doing it on mobile was infuriating and just made me want to throw my tablet across the room...   
---
Why is the default option 1 plank? Who goes to the sawmill with a full inventory of logs just to make one plank?   
---
Also, the ability to configure the default option to 'Buy-plank' would be very useful, Long pressing NPC's while moving is the bane of my existence
---
Literally always have player attack options on right click so that this never can happen. You don't need it left click unless youre actively pking.

Just... remove the purple crystals from the dragonstone armor please. We get it, it's "dragonstone.." but please, it doesn't look good and never will. Either that, or just don't have an armor in the game named Dragonstone. Save the armor for a later update and introduce it without the ugly purple crystals. Without the crystal it looks fine.
---
If you enjoy doin Diaries, I highly recommend doing Motherload for Prospector for Fally hard
---
Well, I will stipulate that the eye situation is weird, but specifically because there's a visor on the helmet that is suuuuper similar to the bone colour of the skeleton used. At leat from what I can tell, because I can see the chin-nose of a pretty well-modeled quality skeleton, and then it just turns into a flat panel, which makes me think just a poorly tinted visor.
---
It's good for safe spotting some bosses during some quests. Otherwise pretty useless.
---
Issue is that no skill can meet that criteria without shooinng away another significant fraction of "maybe" voters on a new skill. I imagine if they keep at it, they might top out at 72% in favor of a new skill.
---
The problem is vorkath and zulrah IMO broke all balance shitting out 3m an hr consistently. raids aint helped either but at least they are challenging and based on uniques
---
Regardless of position on the issue, rewards displayed and the display of what you could have gotten if you were a premium user is a staple tactic of freemium games, it really is a trapping tactic.
---
Now aside from the morals of trying to coerce players into payers before they’ve managed to come to a natural conclusion based on gameplay and feeling like they’re missing out if they don’t act early, I think one of the biggest issues is free to play should ideally be a standalone experience, sufficient enough to stand on its own two feet and provide a fulfilling experience that a player then decides he or she wants to experience more of.
---
I also don’t feel having new players jumping straight into membership is good, I don’t personally think that having immediate access to the whole game is good tutorialisation, having limited exposure to what you can do helps you to learn the mechanics of the game without being overwhelmed.
---
All in all, I think players should be left to decide when they want to start buying membership and not feel like they’re not missing out by not having immediately, I mean this pathfinder system is intended for very very early game, getting players to pay before they’ve experience any of the game seems rather a lot like whaling and not pursuing customers that want to pay to enjoy the subscription content
---
 **Note:** **If you die during the battle, you will respawn with your 3 most valuable items, as well as the greegree and the sigil. If you teleport back into battle immediately, you can recover any other lost items.**   According to osrs wiki

Unexpected baby + shotgun wedding = divorce
---
I mean it wasn't SUPER FUN but I liked pretty much everything about it. Add a minigame that gives good XP rates and it would fit in and be great.
---
This is kind of what I figured all along but this comment proves you don't actually have any endgame/raid experiences. ToB is *highly* competitive since drops are only awarded to one person which factors in MVP status. Because of this the meta has shifted to players maximizing dps and balancing risk vs reward (i.e. risking a crystal halberd instead of a dclaw spec). This is why so many players buy the scythe and other expensive gear - if you have casual gear in a team full of scythes you'll never get a drop.
---
The number of unique combinations of a deck of cards is roughly the same (order of magnitde wise) as the number of **atoms** in the Milky Way.
---
Considering he says ‘your generation’ it’s clear he means boomer.

And it’s fucking funny.

tbh he is only well known because he has one of the most annoying voices out of all rs content makers.

no exposing in this sub, read da rules

Dang, really wish it wasn't behind such heavy quest reqs, I just started playing again and only have 40 QPs, Would've really been helpful.
---
Option C - remove dragonstone armor from the game
---
lol did you just call tob and cox challenging?
---
The problem with the gauntlet is that it was meant to be based on uniques, but the uniques were a total failure. It has 1 drop that's worth more than 1.5m (the Blade), and its estimated at 1/1000 or 1/500. That would be like if Bandos only dropped the pet, or if raids only dropped the twisted bow. It's terribly balanced.

good point I should have mentioned that

Always worth using at vorkath with salve they stack

You should be using void elite over Karils definitely

As long as I could shoot at noobs on the way to my destination.  Just to scare 'em, not hurt 'em.

Q
---
Down votes for truth?

I'd disagree on your last point: if poll results were hidden and somehow they felt there was a real risk of 99% being achieved, I could definitely see that happening. But otherwise, yeah.
---
Huh
---
Hey, I just started playing again a couple days ago as well, I'm wondering if you guys have like a CC I could join or something, having some good friends in this game make it so much better.
---
Ur doing him dirty not posting his name
---
This account was made back in December I believe because he died on his previous HCIM in ToB. I remember because I made a HCIM the same day and died two weeks later, swore off the game mode for good.
---
Sure im sure you might be able to survive alot of stuff wearing it but chain was created to be worn over a gambeson, which makes it effective against blunt force trauma, Its a cheese grater without it, and extremely uncomfortable. its like saying you cant bring up the tires when you talk about a car. they're part of eachother. 
---
And yes chain is used for some things IRL, mainly shark suits. Modern maille is usually made of titanium and signifigantly smaller, welded rings.  That being said it is no where near stab proof.  thats chains biggest downfall.  Anything with a sharp tip geometry is relatively easy to break the chain with. This is due to the extreme pressure exerted at the exact center. Its best at stopping cuts, worst at stopping peircing attacks.
---
You just wield the staff and use it to crush the KQ
---
But I would be using Salve with both options regardless, so is it not the same question of accuracy vs Void?
---
Is that skull kids hat
---
It literally looks like the fortnite default dance which was ripped straight from scrubs. https://youtu.be/8wMYs4m39dE
---
Not osrs enough, not gonna max another skill oh wait
---
god i really want this with the armor too, the rune mace is something im always eyeing when im playing f2p because its like one of the only things that gives a good prayer bonus but id never use because its shit lol
---
But then you lost an invy slot to the dramen staff, thus not having a full inventory of food
---
I know. I just like that song.
---
Fairy ring and close to an altar
---
Its actually insane for me and i keep the cloak and dramen staff with me wherever i go
---
Rings of forging are also f2p, so you're wrong there buddy
---
Too real
---
this is SO funny what is he even mad about??
---
Nice.
---
you're right they were. But they could still stop a significant amount of blows, and usually deflected hits, causing less harm to the wearer.  Its when the armor became dented and battered that blunt force was particularly deadly.  But this is also why knights held swords by the blade and used cross guards to batter eachother to death.
---
Will cost 3-4 mill to 99 from 60ish and 2-3 months of splashing overnight
---
High alch it. 
---
If you're going to use a halberd, the crystal halberd is the one you want... And even then, it's extremely niche (only really worth it for the special attack v.s. groups or large monsters).
---
I couldn't put it better man.
---
If you venge every chance and tank the venge hits it's not too bad
---
First step and 81 thieving...
---
My 1 gp offer cannonballs just bought lol! 
---
I've had it in for a few months and they legit bought (even though I'm not a member and haven't logged in on this acc for ages). 
---
So you defs didn't have the offer in for 20gp, or you removed it before you had the chance to get it.
---
hows the bar in prif? thinkin about adventuring out there in the future
---
What Jagex needs to do is start taking action against the accounts that are playing with these bots. The bots aren't going to waste a bond to spam in the ge if there is nobody to scam money from.
---
Maybe im a scrub but wouldnt ardy cloak be more beneficial then obby cape for fight caves.
---
Link?
---
I feel homie....I feel

I legit saw these on Etsy earlier. Good on you.  I hope this takes off :)

I personally did use it a lot as a med level until I unlocked slayer rings.
---
Can we please ditch the Chinese samurai look on the irowerth elves. Ktnxbai
---
Why do I have the feeling that these will only be in the shop for a few years then removed and become trade able....
---
Are you taking action against the accounts that are interacting with these bots? If you start temp/perm banning or bank wiping accounts that play with these bots and word got out, that alone would stem the flow of this behavior quite a bit.
---
r/UnexpectedThanos
---
What happened was the person who lured you into the pvp zone used an animation glitch that made their character appear as if they're in front of you but they're actually in the pvp zone. This can be done with any item/spell that has a long/delayed animation, and while the animation is happening they click their character into the pvp zone. So when you went to trade/follow him you were actually trading him in the pvp zone.
---
1500 hours and all u have is 94 slay and 200m bank? Yikes
---
But I think once you do 175 qp you’re much closer to 200qp or even song of the elves. Which might just unlock new stuff for you? 
---
Idk if this applies to everyone but it sure helped me get just 25 points more for ds2 and vorkath has been really helpful with building my bank. 
---
If I had never done those 175 I doubt I’d have the motivation to grind to 200 qp when I’m at like 70 something.
---
Not all end game content needs to be zulrah or vorkath. Honestly they should be nerfed into the ground as well. people expecting to make 5 m/hr is the exact bs that got us here now.
---
most people hide in their pohs and do it
---
Usually this kind of thing is solved by rating the options, so you give a higher value to your favorites and lower values to ones you like less.
---
Did people dislike the resting option in RS3? I’m new so idk but I loved it.
---
Getting stuck at the prospect part of tutorial. Decided to make a new account bc I thought I fucked up.
---
I thought they misspelled threat and meant treat.........

and then I understood the feeling of farming.

Completely deserves this. Dude is a fucking cunt irl. God this makes my day. Hope his life continues to be miserable

1. It was polled.

2. Not everything needs to b polled.
---
3. Everyone's been wanting this for years its brought up ever live stream and update.

What kind of welfare monitors you using?

---
If it makes you feel better, I lost my hc status after my first week on the account. Went afk by a hobgoblin so I could add a clannie on disc and suddenly got a runelite notification that I died lol
---
Ok hahah I was like no way there are two people in the rs community named Mary j
---
Just did this quest for the first time. Guards could sniff the scent of ranarr on me from the other side of the house.
---
I did exactly that on my first ever run. Got it on the second try luckily. I hope I never have to do it again 😂 inferno is INSANE
---
I mean you still need to take into account your basically wasting like 80-100 hours of time grinding out 99 when you could just plant trees and earn go in the time you save lmao
---
Nechs are great down there with a cannon, I love it. Just wish the room was a little smaller. Feels super big for nobody ever there lol
---
Source? That's right unless someone tweets God ash we can only assume that it might with an incredibly high drop chance. Check mate.

Gold isn't easier to get on 07, it's just much less inflated
---
Is it just me or is the grammar here really confusing
---
It's all about the mentality you take while playing., In reality it's just a shiny red sticker.  I made it to top a 100 and died a while back but wasn't hurt by it because I knew at the end of the day my account was still pretty dang awesome.
---
Absolutely
---
Had the same type of drops in one trip. Couldn’t believe my luck
---
It took me roughly 2000 tokens starting at the minimum stats to get a rune defender. Took roughly 500 more for dragon. afaicr I got slightly lucky on the dragon defender, so I'd recommend 3000 tokens as a safe average.
---
I think this is a bit of a non issue, but yeah the rewards should be the same or not tell you they coulda been better.
---
Why take a picture of the bones and not the message saying that you killed him?
---
Snapped 💯
---
While there is no delay to remove the authenticator, you do still have to confirm its removal through email.
---
This dude's out here living in 3007
---
Nice, alright, think i got a pretty good game plan now
---
If your cat is fully grown can you get a new one? I'm attached to mine but also need to trade him in for death runes for the diary I'm pretty sure.
---
Fair enough, didn't know it was polled.  But I disagree, while I don't think absolutely everything needs to be polled I do think that changes to diary rewards should be polled.
---
I mean it doesn't really matter about the raw gp/hr numbers, it just matters what you can buy with them. And even with the commission fee of transferring gp, it's really hard to beat ToB's gp/hr in RS3.
---
Yea man gl on ur drops and have fun

83 Woodcutting XD. You asbolute noob.

In 2007? They were worthless!
---
Could be bots tele-alching and they keep misclicking the teleport option
---
lol yeah. I smoothed out her lower face after I noticed that.
---
Regen statue is useless with ornate pools.  Everyone who has done desert elite has ornate pools lol.
---
I was under the impression we were already doing this.
---
Always used mini map to click idk why
---
Oof

If my internet cuts off for a second at bandos, I should lose 10m? No thank you,  that would kill higher level pvm
---
What if longswords have a higher stab accuracy but lower slash accuracy than scimitars?
---
Goteeem
---
Okay I may in the minority here, but.... One Small Favour was kind of fun. In a masochistic way.
---
Keep sounds on if you want to afk a bit, you stop your action if you take damage except when cutting logs.
---
That not accreate it wrong sometime say it other thing than it do so it far from accreate. It say friend do MLM but atcually he do wood cut so not accreate for him 
---
Ps: sorry bad English Iearn just now sorry if not accreate i working hard to be good and accreate
---
:-)
---
not even a seercull smh
---
About to finish Desert Treasure, are there any other places I can switch to Ancients other than going allll the way to the pyramid? Not including the magic cape.
---
Ultracompost always increases the minimum yield by at least 1, so as long as the herb you're farming is worth more than an ultracompost it's worth using ultracompost.
---
Ultracompost costs less than 700 coins on the ge while a ranarr weed is worth over 7000. Using ultracompost is absolutely worth it.
---
Fallujah bad! Fallujah bad!!
---
Most people wouldn't. Fire capes become pretty expendable pretty quickly. with a 2m protect value people would be protecting their fire capes over whips, staffs of the dead, etc.
---
Stupid science bitches couldn't even make I more smarter
---
Hey, Jase, congrats
---
U wot
---
I would t advise you to waste charges on the sort of tasks and save them for demonics and zammy gwd
---
Whip is good enough at Abbies
---
Wow man! I totally believe you and I’m sure your friends definitely remember and are still proud of you!
---
The wildy needs risk, I can agree to that fundamental rule of the wilderness. But that doesn't answer the question of how is the game made any better by not having the option to "Hide left click to attack player unless attacked"?
---
Yes but by your logic rune plates, dragon boots, glories/furies, neitz helms, and basically all other pk gear are just as easy to get as barrows gloves. So fire cape should protect over all of that stuff?
---
Yeah man, I play this game because it's fun and I enjoy it. I don't have the time to no-life 14-hour sessions at maximum efficiency each day to get me to Max Cape.
---
I do what I want.
---
It removed unnecessary tedious clicking. It's still the same game minus the carpal tunnel.
---
Yes it is. Just like mining, pet chance is different per ore. J got mining pet at 61 on iron ore. That was a 1 in 714000 chance.
---
1. I meant elite void (12.5%)
---
2. Idk, but I haven’t seen anyone testing on dummy’s in POH have better hits with crystal armor.
---
hell yeah man!
---
Because his level is low af and he is doing maples. Like i got mining pet at 61 on iron ore. The chance at that level on that rock per mine is 1 in 714k
---
Mad gratz dude.
---
I just realized that Vet’ion’s weapon looks a lot like RS3’s khopesh
---
science is a liar some times
---
If you're just looking to get high stats fast, follow the efficient quest guide. The quests give a good amount of xp, without all the grind. If you follow the guide, you will only train for the levels needed between quests.
---
bandos dhide boots would have been much much better xD

I got a 69 from a couple bushes ;)
---
Plus whoever killed it first would know exactly when it'll respawn, giving them an edge. Unless the 6 hour respawn is universal
---
I completely agree with you.  I hate that I wear graceful most of the time I play, but it's just too strong :(
---
Just let the boys alch
---
Pretty sure I do since I bought it and set it up myself but I'll look into it.
---
Aren't dead clocks usually when you click on an interactive object? Say you click directly in a tree but it's there yellow marker. That's the only type of dead click I've seen
---
roasting some1 for using inventory tags? weirdest insult I've heard in awhile lol. Define Alive (rank 1 ToB) uses them...guess he's bad too
---
No pet no gz
---
It is not and official thing and it is not condoned by Jagex. It is technically against copyright laws hosting a private server and Jagex has filled copyright infringement lawsuits in the past against owners.
---
I have hosted a private server back in 07, but it was much simpler back then. Nowadays the servers are more complex and I don't know the ropes anymore.
---
If you want to play a private server, I would be careful, as there have been instances where private servers were used as a bait to phish players or install malware.
---
No matter if you think your right or wrong your friend is always going to think you were wrong. So its not a question about if you should keep the claws or not its about if you want to keep your friend or not.

That's exactly the point

Yes, dragon bolts are worth it.

No, you're not going to make "fat cash stacks" doing BBD's. There are much better things for you to camp, even if you're looking to AFK with DHCB (Rune Dragons come to mind).
---
Read  all the comments even though I didnt understand anything

It’s all luck some people get it under 1k tokens some it takes over 3k but 1500 is a good amount to try with
---
Don kedic has logged in - Don kedic has logged out... but wait... he logged in.

Logging out resets the timer yeah

You probably use a chest client for ToB lol

Was it a dead click or did he actually just not click?

Smoked lobs would just cost about the same as swordfish so it wouldnt matter at all

I think i found what i was looking for sorry ive been up for 16 hours now. But i was asking if i do questing or whatever for lamps instead of using it for rc construction herb etc if i should dump it into slayer to help me not get burnt out so much. Since i know i got awhile yet before broad bolts.
---
The resources arent at floor the things theyre used to make are.
---
Marriage when the wife is expecting
---
I'd use lamps on something slow, like runecrafting or agility. Construction can be expensive but it's very quick and slayer isn't as mind numbing as runecrafting or agility.
---
Started from the bottom now we here is such a true statement. My first day of membership almost 3 years ago I went to lumbridge and spun like 1k flax into bowstrings to make starter cash. Been ballin’ ever since lol. Anytime someone begs I just tell them to spin flax. 1k flax is like 2k gp and makes you 100k
---
Yea right we have seen time and time again the minority of the community will block any new skill

Idk why but I’m rooting for vinny
---
Go to alchmate.com buy shit at lower than alch values and high alch. I just got over 1k mith items to alch at almost 850gp under the high alch amount. Meaning that's going to be almost half a mil profit.
---
Chauncey what are you doing?! That's dangerous!!!
---
IM FREAKIN OUT
---
Haha swamp man upvote
---
Alching, enchanting, casting lunar spells can be profit depending on what you use
---
You could also just use magic to kill things that have decent drops
---
i just got super angry at sheep herder last night cause they kept getting stuck in random corners
---
What 3 items add up to 350m that you'd use at kbd? Ive been trying to think of them.
---
I think it would be cool af to have an ornament slot for gear that you could be boss related ornaments in that you have the pet for. Not mtx for it though
---
They aren’t even the OP of this. It’s been post like 6 times today.
---
I recently got mine as well! At like 12-15 kc! Man I haven’t been able to get one since then haha!
---
oh no i agree, i just meant it is possibly. honestly, its probably more likely that at some point a new skill get passed than it is for some rando to beat that chess dude someone mentioned above
---
Do toadflax and birdhouse runs at the same time to make sara brews from scratch.

Pretty much 95% of all music added to the game since osrs release has been great

I got 4 dragon axes, so I kind of feel you pain... just to a slightly lesser degree

Imagine, the time and effort spent writing this post you could have bought the salt for the slugs yourself.  I know you are enjoying yourself but the amount of subconscious procrastination people do in rs makes me wonder why they even play at all.

Follow the money, all the content creators are on Twitch now. Problem is, going from Youtube to streaming isn't always a smooth transition. People underestimate how hard it is to stream for 3-6 hours straight and keep the same entertaining personality. I was following him and he never pulled a significant viewership. He stopped streaming a few months ago.

Yeah, like on that long stretch from the docks of Kourend to the castle if someone else has a fire they're resting at you can stop by with them and chat. Maybe it even extends the fire if someone new rests at it, or you can add your own logs to it once to extend it.
---
ahah, is that actually what Lynx said?
---
I agree, it’s so dumb and pointless and inconsequential haha, such a fun piece of nonsense

Just use the visual indicators as the sound is slower. In the settings you can set up F keys to swap between the bag/prayer tabs

Tbh I'm more of a YouTube content consumer because it's more entertaining to me. Edited content to be condensed to what is enjoyable, rather than just casual and live stuff. Different strokes for different folks, but screaming into microphones and heavy breathing would turn me off a stream pretty quickly.

Rune trimmed is how they increase the value of their risk. Its not really rags, it’s some of the most expensive f2p armor

&gt; you don't see DMM as being exciting, despite it being actually a more exciting and refreshing design take on that.
---
That's just like, your opinion man.
---
&gt; You're thriving off the nostalgic high
---
OSRS launch was entirely different from my pre-07 experience. My enjoyment of it had nothing to do with nostalgia.
---
[Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aae431/k_here_goes_clip_of_lynx_titan_hitting_200m_all/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Absolute legend lol
---
I have seen that monster on picture many times.. is it real person tho ?
---
But this was a retaliation to a comment? Or just your goal? Or did it just end up that way? That 98 cooking is making me suspicious that it just ended up that way lol.
---
could get to that stage in his account within a week, nothing of value was lost lol
---
they put themselves in a position to never be killed, thats why theyre ragging in full rune trimmed.
---
You boys like SDBs? Cuz we got em. Lots of em
---
I'm one of those people who's strongly against graphical updates that ruin the old school feel, yet I'm fine with updates like this. It doesn't make sense that a shortbow is better than a longbow, and it would be nice if metal weapons besides scimmies and 2H's had some kind of use.
---
Not strange at all, whoever sold those cannonballs put them to sell at a price of 1. 
---
Usually the GE allots to the highest bidder UNLESS someone exactly matches the price put in. So in this case, this man was highest in the queue for 1 Gp cannonballs and the seller listed at 1 gp
---
Part of the journey is the end
---
Content bloat can not replace community interaction. A lot of the fun of OSRS launch was the wonky economy--how people traded stuff and the ease of finding a niche to fill.
---
Nice, QP?
---
the npc near the tree swaps weapon seeds into accorns, then you have to plant these in saplings as usual
---
why weap seeds? it was a suggestion fr a redditor noob, kmods didnt thought too hard about it.
---
It will make me almost 1b profit once stock dries and ppl pay for their tru value (+270k ince per 14 yield lmao)
---
My only nitpick is to not gain more gp from alchs. Otherwise, very cool suggestion. 
---
I'd also want the ability to rest at a fire place to be indefinite. Meaning you could rest there even after your stats are replenished.
---
?? Why wouldn’t you just sell on GE?
---
Yep! It definitely helps having more qp. The location of the tear spawns also plays a big part though :)
---
people collect them, you cant sell burnt food in the ge
---
Damn, I didn't know that! Pretty awesome achievement tbh especially given the KO potential at Zammy and Bandos
---

I have never met you but i can tell youre not in shape or have an even remotely healthy bmi. I can tell you never leave your house all in that one reply. You must never get invited to parties at all lmfaooooo
---
al mac
---
Honestly if you're in Prif you already must be pretty close to a QP cape, it's not like it's easy to get in, it requires a grandmaster quest. If you have a QP cape you have unlimited teleports to the closest possible fairy ring. It's super unnecessary to add a fairy ring at this point. Just leave it as it is.

They are nsing (non stopping). Basically they attack each other while thinking "Hahaha haha I'm wasting so much of the other guy's time" and this continues on in a loop until one of them logs out which makes the other guy feel superior. They literally brag about how long they can go without logging and who they "win" /outlast against. I remember some saying 50+ hours back in the day. This happened a lot in pre eoc too except it was mostly done in FFA portals. It usually starts with something stupid like "you will regret hitting me" or cause some guy shared their e-gf's nudes/cybered with their e-gf.

I really hate seeing other HC's advocate for things like this or arguing that it would actually be a positive for the hcim game mode if what few bis items from the wilderness got non wildy alternatives. The point of HARDCORE is how much you can achieve from vast variety of dangerous content. It's a good thing that there prestigious items that we have to brave totally unpredictable situations for, and it's not like there's vast amount that requires wild. Some of my best experiences with hc were MA2 and surviving pk duo to finish a clue for zammy dhide top. And slowly becoming more daring as I strengthened my wilderness content loadout 1 by 1 until I knew If I did things right I had no excuse to die in singles (k top, dh legs, fury, crystal shield, inf boots, rune cbow to bolt back with master wand switch). Leave my hardcore experience hardcore
---
Seeing how much this sub loves to complain, I think there is enough calling out going on.
---
this is also incorrect. p^2 is the probability of in 2 back to back trials of 100 kills you receiving at least 1 jar in each

Very true man, still it's a nice achievement to get and I gz u for it :)

Haha yea man I'm trying to grind my stats back up so I can start making money to get the armour I want

OMG another one hahaha yesssss

Which one were you?

Fucking love this community.
---
Need that
---
OpposeGod !

Wrong
---
Hell yeah bro. Hopefully I didn't make the game boring by giving you gp lol
---
Worth noting during the poison phase, don’t panic. Keep run off, and find a nice long line without any green splats on it. Click back and forth between this area until it stops. If you stop walking, you will die. Running during this phase makes it harder. Don’t worry about walking over a couple poison splats to get to a clear area, it’s better than dying to the fire balls. Use ruby bolts (e) and diamond bolts (e) after half hp. Good luck! Don’t forget to anti fire too :)
---
My dude! Hahaha. 
---
Fuck yesssss
---
drop rate is 1/150 i think for dragon defender once you have rune. Took me about 850 kills though
---
Unless he alched then yes his hp would be this high because of that additional xp. You said it yourself 1 for every 3
---
Aye jumbo just so you kbow even when it saya unapealable and perm banned you can still appeal and be unbanned. I can provide proof but take my word for it.
---
His "critiques" were kind of brainless, like he wouldn't really mention what Jagex did wrong or w/e he would just be like "FUCKING JAGEX". Lol, it was funny watching the community grow out of him when they got a bit older, dude used to be the powerhouse of RS content creators which was essentially him just screaming at a mic and sometimes doing PvP which he was horrible at.

Try the recovery system. Even it says unappealable you can still click past that and submit it. I had 3 accs that were perms unbanned. One of the reasons was that ive learned my lesson because the perm was 15 years ago. The other i was hacked and botted on and they even stated i was hijacked in the appeal success.

Holy Hand Grenade.

How do you use the correct you're the first time but not the second time?

Ouch, that's gotta suck. Good luck, hopefully get it within the next 26m lol

How are they not worth killing at temple of light? Double cannon spot and scythe, cheering. What makes the Priff ones better? Just the shards? What about the xp
---
Wait how can you get more than one imbued cape, I though once you chose one only that dude would appear?
---
You sound like a douche. "Stealing" their brews in a team based activity? Maybe theres a reason that youre playing with randoms and not a group of actual friends. And its probably due to your shitty attitude thats on display with this little rant. 
---
Youre literally saying that you do what you want. Just solo the raid then. You're clearly playing with random groups for a reason.
---
Thank you
---
Since it is too late to change the existing polls, I decided shelve this post until after the current ones have finished.
---
Yeha I see it now. How come the untrimmed HP cape is such a flex then? If you train all your combat skills equally, it seems pretty obtainable.
---
Ye i was thinking about it after posting. The answer would be explained and wouldnt just be a 1 in x chance. I feel that what you feel about the luck upon first glance would be as strong as the odds laid out and explained.
---
I do keep checking others posts to see if someone actually does some math and explains it nicly
---
you can also run from nardah bank then sit outside the entrance and wait for your health to regenerate if necessary
---
Either that person drops it and gets another 99 and then picks it back up keeping it untrimmed or yeah like you said. Pretty obtainable. My first 99 was hp by like 16k xp (99 range was soon after)

Deep down our hearts we all know that Zezima will always be our Number 1.

Are you forgetting p2p would have access to this to?
---
Membs is going to feel so good after working for it like that, gratz dude youre going to have so much fun :)
---
Its a slippery slope. On one hand, I welcome future changes and development of the game for it to expand and grow. This is what the devs ultimately want too. However once you start doing certain things then the game starts to lose what many people play it for. I love traditional MMOs. Rs is NOT one of those, and it shouldnt try to be. Rs3 sucks for a reason - it tried to be more of a traditional MMO and failed because there are dozens of f2p MMOs out there that are thousands of times better than rs3. 
---
I agree that a lot of spec attacks need to be updated or changed though. Whip being one of them. Current whip spec is hot trash.
---
Idk I have a feeling walking would be faster than stopping at a fire to wait for your run to recharge.

To be honest I really couldn’t care

Just remove dragonstone armour completely. we've tried, but obviously cant make a dragonstone rune set that fits osrs. Maybe replace it with some ceremonial elf armor
---
Its runecrafting, that wont be a problem

To add to what everyone else said, it could be more about the personal goal to Jase instead of just about ranks. He has come so far so he might as well finish

Sadly I'm a normal account, but I've been in a ditch for cash, so that's a real nice boost on that front.  
---
I also don't have 70 magic or Def yet so, can't use them either way, just glad to have some cash and bragging rights, friend of mine was extremely pissed
---
That doesn't make much sense. If you'd be trying to learn to pk you'd be skulled anyways, no?
---
:)
---
Can kinda agree with the gem armor, but even option B is solid for the elves. Option C is best and fits in greatly, and takes heavily from legend art's example. You're being extremely nitpicky.
---
Sure if you're David Dickinson, Dickinson's Runescape Real deals
---
Pretty much this, all of the filler items are the reason the blowpipe is so cheap despite it being a twisted bow/scythe tier weapon realistically. When you think about it, it's crazy that niche items like the dragon hunter crossbow sit comfortably at 100m+ while the blowpipe is 3m despite being so powerful in so many situations.
---
Jagex really isn't good at thinking about the big picture when they create content/new items sadly. I know they can't accurately predict what kind of prices new items will settle at but adding such a powerful weapon to such a farmable monster that has 2 rolls on the drop table was a terrible idea.

As you can see he's missing some runecrafting xp perhaps he is half way thru max xp

I understand dude. I really dislike slayer on osrs and mainly because of the assignment system... i 100% know why that makes it so enjoyable.
---
What i have done for 69 slayer twice now is follow michealRS youtube guide for the most easy and max efficiency way to get 69 for mm2. This made it easy and i smashed the grind over a few days each time. Trust me this is your best way to quickly and constantly get the level.
---
Also be careful about mentioning dislike of the skill, it is such a loved skill by sooo many in the community.

Salve (ei), rune crossbow, anti dragon shield. Void range if you have it, dhide if you don't. Bring ruby bolts e for the first 2/3 of his hp, switch to diamond for the last bit. Pray range, you'll only take damage from his mage attacks. 
---
Bring crumble undead for the facehugger, click under yourself when you see yourself get frozen so you stop attacking and can cast instantly. 
---
For the acid phase, keep your run off when you see the green spit. Walk in a line ~5 tiles long left to right, don't try to attack during the fireballs. Click to walk back again before you reach the end of your line.
---
Try to eat only when your hp gets below ~40, or when it's a special attack and you can't do damage anyway.
---
There is. 
---
A sweaty chair.
---
Pretty sure the wiki page has a useful enough guide on it.
---
Just take blowipipe, void range and salve (ei). Pray mage and whatever range prayer you have access to the entire time. Take a bastion pot, antivenom pot, and 2 super restores. Have chaos, law and dust runes, and then fill the rest of your inventory with food. 
---
He has 4 attacks to look out for:
---
1.white attack that will freeze you and spawn a small crab. Click anywhere on the floor first to stop attacking vorkath, and then use crumble undead on the crab as soon as you can.
---
2. Purple attack, will turn off your prayers. Just turn them back on again as soon as you get hit.
---
3. Fireball, he shoots a big fireball into the air. You have to move at least 2 steps away from where you were when he started the attack.
---
4. Acid phase, he places a bunch of pools on the ground and then starts firing a barrage of hits at you. Just **walk** around the room avoiding acid pools, make sure to always be moving in this phase and don't worry about attacking.
---
Other than that just keep up hp and prayer as needed. He's fairly weak compared to his post DS2 version anyway so he usually doesn't cause that many problems.
---
Yeah the boiz

They're definitely rigged and they do use hacked accounts to trick people into thinking they're legit. Look at it from the operators perspective, you can make more money and there's literally no drawbacks as nobody has access to the code, so why not?

I used OakDice with their website. Cleared my rs3 account and went for it.

Never bought/sold gold or anything like that so I was extremely hesitant to do it so I spread it out over a week in small trades so I'd never get scammed for the full amount.

Didn't get scammed in the end and got 7/1 rate, maybe other clans have better rates.

Oh no, now that you said it, they do look alike... Fuck how do I unsee it?

No that’s not in future context, saying he will never have a job means he never had one nor will ever get one.

Yeah, like I said in the video this doesn't revolutionize the meta, particularly for main accounts. However, the method is probably viable for Iron Men looking to accumulate Crystal Shards for Divine potions (or crystal equipment etc). It was still a fun little find though.

Hopefully this will give you some motivation; on my ironman, I had zero uniques until about 650kc when I got the bp. Got the magic fang and visage within the next 125 kills.

---
Pretty crazy to me that Randy is still top 10
---
crazy how them shits pilin up
---
Yeah, a few sec. And massages dont hurt
---
Zulrah would probably be your best money maker for sure. If you ever do DS2 and get Elite void, then Vorkath also gets up there if you're doing BGS/Blowpipe. Even more alternatively you could get your combat stats up a bit more, especially mage and range, and buy raids starter gear which is about 20m total if you skip the Zenyte stuff early on, you could do CoX for some money as well. More reliant on the big RNG drops but Raids 1 and Raids 2 work out as the best conventional money makers in the game over time.
---
BRing Imbue should be a priority.
---
Actually the chance of anything dying is based off of what compost you are doing. Im 94 farming and trees still have 1/6 chance to die at all levels unless I use ultracompost.  Even the calculator linked below, farming level doesnt effect chance of death
---
The fuck’s the icon for r/raimimemes
---
Zeah RC. Don't get me wrong, it is better and more tolerable than regular RC, but I still hate it. The mining is really not that afkable due to the sheer RNG of mining there, the xp is painfully slow, and actually crafting runes is pretty click intensive for a solid 2 mins of the ~8 mins per rc run. 
---
Spending 10 hours at bloods for 1 rc level and I'm only 85 rc is just so painfully bad, I don't know how people do 99 in Zeah.
---
Clap clap why clap comment clap if you clap don't even clap clap know what you're talking clap about clap palm clap face

I hate how they made the older elf quests easier (without polling any of the changes/people voting no to related changes) for the sake of newer players.

Is he actually?  I loved this dude.   He wasn’t really funny anymore by the end of it but I still have fond memories watching his shit.   Even his Minecraft shit was funny
---
Meanwhile I'm on like 2m/hour at Zalcano paying almost no attention and watching 90s sitcoms.
---
oooo I want to buy that chair.
---
Indeed. I bursted em from 90-99 and got fucking bonkers loot, tracked all of it and the runes I bought and ended up making almost 10M profit
---
Those numbers will also be about 10% lower if you've done certain Kourend diaries die to the double essence mine.
---
He has one rc alt with 100m+ xp, not 4. He had around 60m rc xp on his main when he quit rs3, and did the bulk of rc xp doing lava runes. He didn’t make anything remotely close to 50b gp by rcing on alts, in stead he made the bulk of his gp doing the karamja store method.
---
That makes sense to me
---
Or one mothers credit card swipe too! You got it bro, get that shit.

Did they change it? I coulda sworn it was only a week

Look at his current Slayer points: 666

Good luck at work today. :O

Probably gonna end up dead tbh, not a lot of people play with music on. I just love the music in this game lol.

It's worth noting that we're not banning the accounts because you're specifically posting about them - we already go through and ban them en mass, however they're easy to create and therefore show up often, and we have to be cautious when banning them as quite a few are often hijacked. 
---
Also, accounts we ban won't show as random [#] names on your ignore list - that's only when we remove the display name on top of a ban.

GE keeps everyone at one location on the map. Before a lot of cities looked like this. Varrock Fally Seers Catherby... there wasn’t really a central hub unless you went to trade worlds so less players were just in one spot. People could be found all over the map.
---
Not like now, everywhere is a ghost town unless there’s a skilling spot.
---
I have one for Lunar Island for Vorkath.
---
probably work towards barrows gloves ?
---
Same :/
---
Can't you set the amount in one of the boxes to the right and then just tap what you're making to make that amount?
---
It still is dead content - this guys numbers are ridiculously off. It's closer to half of what he said.
---
The game add padding on each side since a lots of phone with a ratio that isn't 16/9 have a notch. Since the game can be played both side, they added padding on both side to avoid having the button under the notch.
---
Your pixel 2 xl have a bigger aspect ratio than the pixel 2, so that's why you have them.

Alch it

If someone doesn’t help out on the group project, I sure as hell won’t trust him to print it out. He’d fail his only job.

Co-OP isnt cheap, but it's barely a step above Iceland quality. 
---
Co-Op produce is also trash where I'm from, and all of their own brand stuff is actually rancid.

My suggestion would require players to stop what they're doing, while the stamina fires wouldn't, so I don't see what he's talking about.

The We Do Raids discord has a starter gear list on their discord and they do learner raids all the time that you can join. Once you get decent KC and find a few friends in the learner raids who you like playing with you can just do trios or 4s with them for solid cash and fun.
---
Zulrah with your stats if you have blowpipe/trident is probably like 2m an hour once you learn the boss well enough to get multi kill trips. Vork is probably similar GP an hour with BP and BGS but you're not relying on unique rates to hit that much so it's more consistent in the long run with the off chance at a big loot at some point. If you're going to do Vork with BGS and and BP though, elite void, salve amulet (i) and at least the level 70 house pool that restores run and spec energy are pretty much required, as well as a portal to lunar isle in your house.
---
RnGesus is with you my friend. May your luck inspire everyone's RnGesus to do the same!
---
A chain is almost useless against blunt trauma, it's literally its weakness since it has almost no rigidity due to being constructed in a chain formation. I also can't imagine it being anywhere near as heavy as plate armour. 
---
Its main use is to be under some kind of plate armour to protect the joints where swords or arrows could get into the plate mail. 
---
Either way, in game it's literally just a chain mail so it should be much more effective against slashing and stabbing than crush.
---
Adding onto this as an example, the hops hover around 1k each. They have 4 different patches and you can easily average 100 hops a run alongside your herbs. The seeds are also cheap and so is the protection of tomato(?) baskets. Protection is optional, but it costs like 1k to make sure you dont cut into the profits. 
---
TLDR: hops 1k each, average 100 from the 4 patches, hourly runs alongside herbs. 10 minutes = 300k profit.
---
I know stuff from the qandA posts makes it in, only other thing I can think of is the current quest tab layout.
---
The puzzle was genuinely fun and doing it with a guide is just cheating yourself out of the experience
---
Nowhere in that screenshot suggests a p mod was there though, at least leave the crown unblurred
---
It's never going to make you massive amounts of gp. But keep in mind it requires almost no work at all which is why its referred to as a bit of passive gp. If you're having trouble selling them, the best way to do it is to insta buy one and then sell all of yours at that price. That means you will have the lowest offer on the market so you will sell it off next time someone insta buys. With a highly traded item like b staves should sell quickly
---
So...you gonna join the "ChhekClappers" or what
---
And how do u make money killing green drags? :D
---
Wuk ist me gie, belgn ftw
---
Helm is fine.
---
Fighter torso until BCP.
---
Obby legs/Verac's skirt until Tassets.
---
Fury until Torture.
---
Blessing is fine.
---
Fire cape is BiS until Inferno.
---
Ring is fine.
---
Defender is fine.
---
Dragon boots to Prims.
---
Get Barrows gloves.
---
In order I would upgrade to Barrows gloves, finish Torso, get Fire Cape, buy Torture, Prims, Tassets, BCP. The Majority of Slayer tasks will be done with protect from melee on so you can put the Tasets and BCP off until last and use Prossy top and bottoms.
---
Mines bugged its showing me stats for rs3
---
15 minute kills using ruby bolts and crystal armor with crystal bow, but yea, it’s super repetitive killing it that way for 15 minutes straight. I made probably 100m+ though off that rabbit so I’m happy lol.
---
Yea cut the runes given in half
---
Fuck man... I feel old as shit watching this. I remember walking through Varrock looking like this as if it were yesterday; been playing on and off for nearly 13 years now. OSRS brings back that happiness I had playing as a kid. 
---
I’ll never forget how proud I was when I made my first 1k, then 5k, 10k, so on and so forth. Felt like the richest player alive. Full mithril, defense ammy, addy sword, leather boots, leather gloves, and black cape from the highwayman south of falador. Good times, man.
---
Idk man, I don't think the majority of the playerbase knew that back in the day. The real reason is Varrock was a social hub and most people played RS like it was medieval club penguin.
---
Both pretty brutal. Second one reminds of the whole "OMG JaGeX cEnSoRs yOuR pAsSwOrD iF yOu TyPe It!" scam too. Back before the email login days.

Damn dude you're so smart, why don't you apply to jagex?

Barrows gloves. Progressee the account a lot

This is why f2p is getting snare/entangle soon. Full runes gonna get rekt soon.

It's heavily edited. If you want to see the extreme freakiest physiques look up matkus ruhl, paul dillete and big ramy. Anything bigger is photoshopped.

That's nuts, I just blasted RC day 1 and pumped out minds for disgusting prices. I wasn't alone but EVERYONE needs to train magic day 1 so it didn't matter.
---
Saying most is an overstatement
---
Im tripping on acid and im crying laughing
---
I got scammed for about a million. I don't rememeber exactly what happened but it had something to do with willows being tricked for magic logs and it was on a Swedish server. All the game words were in Swedish back then and I remember thinking at the time 'this seems too good to be true'.
---
Ever since this day I have lived by the philosophy, 'if it seems too good to be true, it probably is'.
---
But they weren't wasting time in their eyes, it was a social experience for them so they were doing what they came to do.
---
Seriously, getting to 77 RC isn't as bad as people in this sub would have you believe. Then it's just easymode AFK from there.

..What? Its a game, if you feel like the time you spend playing it is wasted then you shouldn't be playing.
---
they have now until they die (or osrs closes) to achieve 200m all skills so it will eventually happen
---
Honestly, knowing the kinds of people that play RS, we shouldn't have any problem getting the votes to make characters white again

Gratz! Really motivating post, the loot and the pet looks juicy.

Put it on Microsoft paint and make the white back ground black. Cmon kid you play rs surely you can use paint

I mean, really all it was was that instead of one spot (the GE) it was two spots (Varrock West and Falador East). The reason it's so populated in this video is most people played the game as a Social hangout and were also ten years old. It's not like if the GE weren't here we would instead be wandering the streets looking for deals in general stores. We would just go back to Varrock West as the unofficial GE.

The only real factor at play here is playerbase demographic.

I’m a new member account with 2Mil that’s just sitting in my bank right now. I have 750k in Miscellania that I replenish every day, I buy Zaff’s staffs every day so I keep 210k on hand at all times and a little over 500k for my Ranarr runs and general questing purposes. Why can I do with the other 1Mil that just sits idle so that I’m makibg more money?

(Here for this statement.)

im not an iron, but my DPS is not enough

Pretty sure you could already avoid the bubbles by using the minimap to walk, it auto paths you around obstacles like that.

I on the other hand was the scammer for a while back in  probably around 2006-8. At one point a friend and I took advantage of 10004 gp looking like 1000K before the coin stack changed colors when it hits 1m. We made a ton of money in items. Ended up getting banned. 
---
Then I had a friend who scammed a Santa hat back when it was like 6m. He let a bunch of us try it on and when I got it I teled and logged out and sold it. 
---
Wasn't the nicest player back in like 2006-2008 but the noobs back then weren't as smart and half the time we would give the items scammed back just to teach a lesson.
---
Yeah better slam it shut when you're the only one through
---
I was told that most do. 
---
I’m not a P-Mod myself so I wouldn’t know, and I doubt any other players/or even P-Mods would hop the worlds to report &amp; try to mute them. 
---
When I have reached out to 3 P-Mods that I know, they’ve all ignored when asked if they could go to the GE to mute a dicing bot on said world.

If he said will never have a job again then it would be correct... it doesn’t matter that much. It’s a tiny argument of one word. The main point was the other guy was making a huge assumption about someone he knows nothing about.

You get 14-15kills per hour with efficient group of 3-6 people and 20kills when there is 10+ people instantly bursting Zolcano without any circles
---
I'm not worried about that, I can afford the full price. I'm just a very casual player and I tend to be busier in the summer so I was hoping to push the 3 months a little more into the autumn. I guess I just waited a little too long!
---
Thanks for the reply though u/Polox33

There are literally settings to prevent this from happening.
---
Using ignorance to fuel the salt mine in your head is not exactly a good explanation for why the rest of the community votes on proposed content the way it does.
---
Lots of people pk unskulled, its called anti pking. One of the best ways to learn because less risk means higher tier gear with better accuracy and/or damage allowing for more mistakes.

Its 1.2m now. Since it's a guaranteed drop I expect that it will keep dropping to like 200-300k
---
Why is that so bad?
---
If you're on runelite and right-click the inv icon the option should be there to unlock highlighting or whatever. Then just right click stuff in inv and make whatever colour you want
---
Zulrah guarantees 2 rolls on the drop table each kill, which makes dmeds 1/62 instead of 1/124. 62x62=3844. As I said, not that lucky.
---
Bad Man is Big Gay
---
Yea!
---
I'm less than 100 with a higher total. Dude has a shit account.
---
look up varrock museum quiz on the wiki. you can get lvl 9 hunter (and some slayer xp) in ~10 minutes.
---
It could yeah, but I calculated the probability that would happen at the reported 45/55 rates and it's like .002 which is absurdly unlikely to see such a long streak. I might actually do some stats to find their true odds, but I'll just have to see cause I'm lazy
---
Untill you get a Slayer task requiring one of those pieces of equipment
---
But for the most part, everyone says to get Slayer helm pretty late  you unlock a few things b4 Slayer helm becuz mask is basically the same thing

You're either being dense on purpose or you simply can't read, a growth cycle is based on a global timer and doesn't last the same duration for every player based on when you planted.

Use your spare cash after getting your bond to charge unpowered orbs into air orbs for a few days and you’ll be able to buy another bond or two I used to do this before I got high enough slayer to maintain a bond. Also unlock the kingdom of miscellaenea once you have spare cash it adds up

I mean he might be quested out with that total and have a lot of high lvl gear unlocked/earned and just likes to pvm/pvp. Lot of players like that dude. Doesn’t mean it’s a shit account lol.

I'm doing smithing and trying to figure out which is best to smith while being the most AFK. So has to be something with 1 bar per smith. None of the armor/weapons are even close. Most people do dart tips, but it turns out unfinished bolts are actually slightly better for addy. I checked javelin heads and arrowtips just for fun, and saw the javelin head alch price was really high, and then noticed the whole thing.
---
Maybe when you get the hydra tail? Potentially a guaranteed drop at 250 (similar to Kq head, so a broken one) then duradel will assign them. So you still have to kill hydra firstly with konar but then you can get them from duradel, (but at a low weight  as to not crash the items that much)
---
I appreciate that there are settings to prevent this from happening. But that doesn't excuse the scumbaggery of skull tricking.

Less than 100 cmb? Lol what a shit account
---
At this point, shouldn’t someone go through files of what was expected to be changed with the polls and make sure they’re all reverted?
---
Not necessarily scamming, but I remember back when I was a kid I had just entered the heroes guild for the first time. I knew that you could charge your glory in the dungeon.
---
Well, the 7 year old kid in me liked to flex with his bank out all the time. I met some guy killing the dragon and he trade lured me in, I lost all my bank, and basically spent the whole day crying infront of my Dad.
---
You could buy the bottomless compost bucket for your ranarr runs. It will save you money on compost and make the runs much easier because you won't have to manage all the compost and buckets.
---
You haven’t watched Slayermusiq then my friend
---
where are your parents?
---
people like slayer because (not I) 1) ironmen have jagex by the balls so slayer monster shit raw gp\\mats 2) its passive xp since you'd be killing monsters anyway 3) its a meme and if you're not a part of the meme you're being left out.
---
That's not a useful poll unless they have something to show so we can grasp what's being offered.
---
What if they polled crystal armor but didn't say what stats or effects it would have?  They just said "should we add crystal armor?"
---
The difference being, the stats and effects for crystal armor are easy to derive.  Fit it's stats in between other armors at a similar tier and slap +% accuracy and damage.  Versus producing 3 or 4 3D models for every question.
---
And 2 days after that he'll say he's bored with 0b
---
Good to know, thanks. Runelite is usually on top of things like that so I’ve always thought it was strange that something as simple as a timer would be so inaccurate
---
I mean in this specific instances, the stuff they changed like these bubbles weren't polled and they changed it regardless, so the argument that they thought these changes would pass doesn't make sense
---
Should just balance it by making the spec cost 50% and 100% chance to hit a 0
---
It's a pain in my asshole to get the requirements for this quest on my ironman. All that content locked away for sweaty stat buyers to play :(
---
They do have bots that rag in f2p. They just eat up hard in full rune and will run/tele if they’re out of food.
---
This was the first thing I thought of
---
Konar is also used every 10th task for best points
---
I just threw this together in paint. I wanted it to look like a regular chat box but....well I suck at editing as you can see hahaha

Ya but with ultracompost your guaranteed at minimum 6 herbs per patch which covers the cost of the seed anything after is profit

And then 2 weeks after that he'll be burned out with 10m

More like Neetbook pro
---
Ash doesn't like firemaking? Ironic.
---
If you lost a tbow on an iron it would have to be one of your none protected items. That just doesn't happen.
---
It's on Ape Atoll. You make 2 birds attack you so that you get hit every other tick. Auto retaliate (made ineffective by wielding a bow with no ammo) initiates a 2 tick cycle that you complete by clicking on the tree. Then clicking on the ground the same tick that you get the log resets your cycle allowing auto retaliate to work again. You just end up clicking the tree one tick, and either the ground or dropping logs the next tick. It's very easy.
---
I mean yeah but raggers still do that if they're human too
---
I do 5 herb runs a day and that's more than enough to pay for a bond every 2 weeks
---
Have you been slaying hydras for 2.3k kills without a slayer helm?
---
is that standard tho? feels like a waste of dev time to implement changes that are still in the polling process. Not trying to say you’re wrong just wondering
---
you seem to have made a deal with the devil
---
Depends. If one reads the quest dialogue, its actually quite entertaining :)
---
Diares are exactly that, check the wiki
---
Tbf if you complete the quest you let the orcs take over Zanaris bc part 3 isn’t in osrs yet
---
Gotta respect the 1 runecrafting
---
Mother lode gives iron??
---
How far does the game broadcast boss loot? I'd hate to tell the world that I just got a good drop killing a wildy boss.
---
and exactly what evidence or precedent are you basing this crackpot theory on?
---
Much better. Cannon + tbow in arma.
---
Another alternate is elite void and claw spec with melee helm.
---
Not high level. Highest was like 26 theiving. 12 combat. But I'm just doing regular iron man at this point
---
people don't play chess because they think they'll eventually surpass Magnus lmao...
---
nah was fucking shit to buy quest items
---
GE is one of the main reasons I came back to the game after a break.
---
Almost certainly.
---
Is dragon Slayer considered beating the game?  It just for f2p?
---
oh fuck off
---
Where's the best place to train in f2p
---
If your internet is that unstable I'm surprised you'd want to do bandos at all. I've played for 2.5 years and only died to a single DC. If DC's were that big of an issue then there would be no high level hardcore's.
---
Looks like those oil injections
---
People don’t unskull pk in deep wild lol and people don’t skill trick in BH.
---
960 kills and I'm still missing blowpipe, I know the feeling man.
---
Speak for yourself I pay 11.99 a month specifically just to smith cannonballs. 
---
Cannonball making is truly the pinnacle of gaming in 2019.
---
 Nothing beats the exhilaration, thrill, and rush of turning a huge load of bulky heavy bars into perfect round balls for hours on end.
---
Seren can only receive a maximum hit of 24 so it's pretty much scaled down, magic accuracy can help a little but it's not that important.
---
I did it for a friend and used Ibans with mystics and other cheap mage gear, was a cake walk. Takes a few rotations so make sure you bring plenty of brews and you're good.
---
Give it to me
---
LOL the dude got so angwy, you’ve made him delete all his comments.  Excellent work comrade
---
If it’s his loot it’ll prob just show up after the minute
---
It has a lower max hit, but attacks nearly twice as often.
---
Just get 200mil xp, and you'll increase the pet drop chance!
---
I only plan on posting these for 2 more days, a week in total. 
---
I will still be reporting all these bots everyday and to avoid spamming the sub-reddit, i'll post a weeks review in 9 days (about next week).
---
Nice helm.
---
Kinda depressing that mining 100k iron ore only nets 8.5m
---
Hey man I'm getting the same issue! Jagex please fix...this never happened before!!!!!
---
Man what if we're all just kings and queens living out our lives within the quantum universe of a deck of cards?
---
Agreed. When I started out I was wearing d hide and getting like 1 kill every trip. Now I'm up to all BIS gear with 5-6 kills a trip because of the money I've accumulated from all the kills.
---
I really just want the pet though. Vorki is one of the only ones I really like or even care about getting.
---
The Feds own the paper dollar bill but it’s still my money.
---
Bad logic is bad

I'd say her higher points for the milestone tasks and her area-based tasks are enough of an incentive. If you don't want to do area restricted slayer, it is annoying to be forced to use her to get that one boss task.

why doesnt oldskool f2p have ads?

---
its under 900k already
---
pretty shit rng to not get any gemstones.
---
When I completing all the quests to get the cape for the lumbridge diary, I was wondering "Man I wonder how long this quest will take" since everyone memed about never finishing it.
---
And then I went "That's it?" after finishing it in like 15-20 minutes
---
Bruh...
---
Isn't there just some sort of console where they filter out common phrases by these bots? This way they can have someone inspect the accounts and ban them.
---
You cannot ignore the difference between pre-GE in *actual 2007* and pre-GE in OSRS.
---
Surely, 12 years ago, people were doing all kinds of random skilling all /hanging out all over the place. Efficient? No, but it didn't have to be. When OSRS launched, however, but before GE was implemented, players *were* efficient, and definitely only in places where it made sense to be situated. 
---
Like I said, people still do not only skill in the vicinity of GE (although, more so because, yet again, it is efficient), right about every 1-click bank has players fletching or training herblore. 
---
Anyway, romanticizing about the inefficiency that we once had is fairly ignorant. You know as well as I do, that people back then either didn't know any better or simply didn't care. And people most certainly both know and care today.
---

Would you prefer “Oops, will be fixed last week!” ? ‘Cause I don’t think that’s an option.

Someone probably forgot. As you said, it took weeks for anyone to notice.
---
Yes they do, congrats champ. I'm not saying they have no reason to play, im saying the situation is different than his example.
---
the same sickness that drives them past 99
---
People who are saying these aren't rigged and are fixed 45/55 here or in the GE are either naive enough to fall for them or own these bots themselves.  
---
Seen so many bot owners but of course I couldn't 100% prove these actually own them, except for two:  
---
First bot owner, some random low level account kept "winning" so many times in a row. I kept saying "Of course you're winning because you own these bots" and he kept denying it. Low and behold he disappeared after the bot was muted, I added the guy, he had public on so I hopped to his world and what a surprise: I caught him red-handed trading those royal items you get from clue items (before for some reason or another they stopped giving those royal items).  
---
Another one was a guy who was in the same cc as I was in (cc is based on certain account builds) and I found him in the GE, next to the gambling bot, same world as I was in. He was pretty ambiguous with his words but he was trying to make me gamble. I just kept saying I don't gamble and I know they are rigged. Then he made a slip-up and he autotyped a line those gambling bots use on his account on accident. He just said "lol" quickly and tried to spew random sentences together to hide his mistake.  
---
On top of that I've seen screenshots of how these bots work. They are rigged. Even one person on a certain site known for RWT warns of rigged dice clans, how easy it is to rig them.
---
UIM here, if I do something risky and get burnt for it, then it's my fault. The Wildy is a dangerous place, and I fully expect at any moment to lose everything.
---
youtube this question there’s good guides
---
Congrats yes it is, was just pointing out the flawed analogy.
---
I’d skip on over to Zalcano, you can thank me later. PSA: Zalcano is chill as fuck, easy to learn, ~1m p/h, and the pet is gangster AF
---
Grats on the blade! I think I got 15 or so KC and my friend convinced me to try ‘Cano and I haven’t been back. So frustrating having a perfect gear run to misclick in the bossfight and have it all become worthless. If you die at Zalcano and keep a tele crystal with you, at least you can get back and still get KC
---
Almost sounds like our good friend dovydas
---
She's not dead content. Her niche is not Hydra. Her niche is being a more profitable Slayer monster for mid level players. Players who are level 100 and 95 Slayer should not have to use a mid level Slayer monster that assigns awful tasks to kill Hydras.
---
More people, more competition, less hits per phase from you = bigger effect from randomness of pickaxes' passives. 
---
Also, people in bigger groups tend to rush more with less tephra. If half of players will do so, you can end up not destroying the shield and then just waiting there doing nothing when somebody runs for second time mining it, heating it, imbuing.
---
With less players, experienced Zolcano players cba to bother with doing more runs than necessarily, so, everyone usually takes their time to mine more tephra than needed. And noone seems to bother if someone did it faster or later than them.
---
But, I guess, it is personal preference too. With 3-5 group yesterday I got 190k+ 9 drops in a row not being the mvp.
---
Two players is possible and very chill, but too damn slow. 3 is fine if you all have good enough movements/pace and required pickaxes/luck to do 333 or more damage per phase, but it is too much relaying on the luck. So, 4 is best option in my opinion. Everyone has opportunity to deal good chunks of damage and it goes pretty fast.
---
Ar-down or ard-oin?
---
I'm loving these posts, need moar
---
I almost forgot about this. Thanks
---
I thought Hydra gp/hr was balanced around requiring 95 Slayer lol. Most people who want to do Hydras just skip until they get the task.
---
Not in the slightest. You're not replying to the correct person here i think bud. I don't give a shit why people play, i was just pointing out how his example is different.
---
Replacing it with an A10 Warthog two years ago was a better suggest cause BRRRRRRT
---
I mean, it is on them for going into a PvP Area. But at the same time, it is a bit mean to specifically hunt them down. Also, if it is the video I am thinking of, the dislikes might have something to do with him refuses to censor the HCIM's name, which led to them getting a bunch of harassment and such.
---
I remember freaking out and calling my friends when I got my first white cash stack.
---
Grey? We are pure evil, slaughtering gnome children for sport and massacring city guards on the off chance one of them has a treasure map.
---
Main thing is that im collecting brimstone keys. Hydras dont really drop anything that I want now. Also they are most common thing you can get, so it makes some other tasks more common to get. For example, i would like to get lots of krakens.
---
You would get about $500 which is a weeks worth of work for me. Also with $500 you’re getting not so much cocaine or some cheap whores. Rather keep my in game wealth it’s taken years to accumulate ( obviously he’s not a stalker)

Thanks for the info, I didn't know that. Still confused though why the guy in this pic decided to buy those at that time. Was he just like "what should I do hmmm... Oh I know! I'm going to buy some infinity gloves at 69 gp and 1 gp!" Lol I wanna have those instincts too.
---
Splashing would've been better use of one's time at that point
---
Iv won 2/3.
---
It's not really flawed if you don't take it 100% literally. There will always be someone better at you at something and there will be nothing you can do about it, skill based or not.

Can someone explain to me what’s happening
---
Fuck
---
I always thought the 200m max xp was related to the maximum integer value being 2.147b, but I guess there is a factor of 10 somewhere in there thats missing so I dunno.
---
Same. I just bought a dwh yesterday with the money I've been making, and hopefully by the end of the weekend I'll have enough for a zammy spear so my buddy and I can go to raids. Can't wait.

Does Jagex still spawn rare items in-game to flood the game with them and keep the price low as promised? Haven't heard of such events for years.

My bad.  At work and not looking through links carefully.

You obviously prefer the results of an esteemed wiki over a total stranger on the internet.  So continue your thing man, use the tools that seem most reliable to you.
---
All I've been trying to tell you is that in my personal experience (particularly during the fluctuations surrounding the release of the farming guild), ranarr/torstol/snaps were not always the most profitable at the yields that I was getting.  If you experienced something different, then that's fine but no amount of linking to that calculator is going to change my past yields.

If it means anything mine may have been lower because I didn't know about the spell to regenerate crops?  The point I was making was just that in my past experience it's best to not just rely on ranarrs always being best, which you obviously don't do if you're using all of these tools available to you.  
---
Anyways have a good day man.  I need to get back to work.
---
Kick them out from the team/switch world.

Smoked fish making levels?
---
I think having a cap is a good idea, it gives people a goal, I don't think as many people would go for that amount if there wasnt a cap.
---
I guess people just like to see an end in sight.
---
Not sure exactly what the limits are for that stuff, but I know there is a hidden decimal in RS2/OSRS so 200M exp is really 2B and they likely capped it there to avoid hitting the normal cap. They might be able to change it now, like they can with item names, but there isn't much of a demand to change it.
---
That's a lot of money pyramid. When did you start? I went there at 59 on my iron and was kind of annoyed by the fail rate.
---
Wildy better xp boii

*Change UI for smithing and crafting*

Its anecdotal but the world I was in randomly got bigger and we had about 9, maybe 10 people in the arena... and I got two 27k drops and a 35k drop before leaving. This is after getting pretty much only 75k-130k drops in the 6 kc before that when it was just 6 people. I always thought loot was based on relative participation points but it turns out it's true that loot is based on total contribution, not relative to others... too many people means everyone is getting 30k drops and not 70k+ drops!
---
Thats why i chill all alone at b2p altar

This is what originally sparked the 🦀crab🦀 meme afaik,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDU_Txk06tM
---
It's also a "humorous" way to show that you're displeased, by protesting.
---
Example;
---
🦀stop doing that🦀
---
Yeah that does make sense. Him being apologetic really seemed fake and out of place
---
Excluding those too. Sorry I wasn't thinking too much into it. Idea just popped in my head lol. I think treasure trails and pets should have their own cape of completion.
---
Fuck, ya got me. 😂
---
This flavorless meme's still alive?
---
Having a great time with your mom ;)
---
Good luck on the jar of darkness

Every holiday event gives you a bunch of the items.

Just finish it lol it's a super short quest

This is the most runescape reply I have ever seen.
---
Why is rune picks a no-no zone?
---
If you’re talking margins you’re correct, not if you’re just talking profit
---
You just want to kill the boss as quickly as possible to mitigate damage. You could also use manta rays since they heal 2 more than sharks. Getting your mage and range up and upgrading gear will increase your kill speeds by a good amount. Tormented bracelet would be a big upgrade when you can afford it (worth selling anguish for probably), or upgrade to trident of the swamp. Eventually, sang staff will help as it can heal you, so you don't need to eat for the start of another kill, but it is extremely expensive.
---
Glad to hear! She's been under a lot of stress lately so she deserves some time off :)
---
Big twitch streamers do this as well. Annually, I think. I've seen MMORPG do it multiple times.
---
Not a maintainer my man. Aircraft refueller in the RAF.

When smelting addy bars in blast furnace, is it better to do one coal bag of coal+12 coal in inv to make 13 addy bars per inventory, or one coal bag+one inventory of coal in furnace, then  running back to get another coal bag and full inv of addy ore to make a full inventory of addy bars?
---
Did you read the title of the post? He's F2P
---
didn't dice used to actually be in the game?
---
that isnt true, that was their oldest backup not the last backup they made
---
Didnt know about the harrassment part. That's really fucked up, but also it shouldn't be a thing to censor people's name because we know they'll get harrassed, the community just shouldn't harass people in general lmao. But he should have censored it probably
---
I got my quest cape and I wanna see more quests come out haha. It’s actually like the only thing I like about RS3, there’s so much content it’s insane
---
I lowered it's defence with BGS specs before I started bolting it, still took like 10 minutes to kill though.
---
'tis not in my experience
---
Could always skip a few seconds thats usually what i end up doing cause lately ive been in the same waiting for his next move situation but written guides just throw me off and usually arent specific enough for me
---
Lol a margin is the same as profit dumbass. If an item is bought/produced at 100gp and sold at 200gp the margin is 100gp. And hey guess what! The profit would also be 100gp per item!
---
$5 grandfathered rate means I’ll never cancel my sub.
---
I think this crooked and subversive mutation of iconic quests in the Elf series deserves an entry in the fuck-ups of the month calendar.

I nominate it.

I know. Thats the point.
---
It only flies to Al Kharid. They have oil.
---
Oooo ark
---
yes i did that ingame, problem is after 1k kills it resets and doesnt save, didnt know if you went to their website if it had it listed or not, i also dont have an actual runelite account.
---
just tell us how much gp the legend gave u
---
Thank you, holy fuck. The second I saw this my first thought was why are we celebrating obvious mental illness, and I had to scroll all the way to the bottom to find anyone not part of the circle jerk.
---
When the outcome of your "focus and commitment" could literally be achieved by a trained chimp, it's not something to be proud of. Literally any person could quit their job, move back in with mommy and go for #1 on RS. Jagex should honestly change the XP cap to whatever 99 is for the sake of these lost souls. Imagine playing this game more than you do anything else in your life, including sleep. Holy fuck.
---
No ones romanticizing anything. If you take away the GE there isn’t a central location for people to stand. 
---
It’s not rocket science. Other parts of the map would be less dead.
---
You people know so much more about collection log than I do. Lol I guess I just was hoping that their could be future unique cape rewards for very serious and difficult long time goals other than max cape.
---
Spirit trees, high level contracts in farming guild, herbs
---
Not in Lumbridge.
---
Yea, have some respect for the ferret
---
People could be found all over the map. You are very focused on the trade hubs.
---
that doesn't change that he is known for the pitch of his voice, not the quality of product that he releases, because lets be real here, anyone can slap together a video like him.
---
You can be only 3 players and all get below 100k drops. You can check my profile for last post of solo Zolcano.
---
Everyone does how they want it to be done. Most of the times I rather stay for good company rather than be based purely on what pickaxes people have and how they perform
---
Which npc?
---
I know it’s a while away, but Jagex should do this as an April fools...
---
I hope one day I will see something moving in my loot pile as well. 
---
3k kc btw
---
Doesn't take a lot of talent to get a 99, but it does take a lot of hard work...
---
Runescape is a video game dude... this is too realistic for a fantasy game like RS
---
yeah, i agree. it would be cool if they added something to collect as well like marks of grace
---
AMA was 3 years ago. He has a second account with a dickton of XP(might even be 200m) but several accounts with over 20m
---
Ar-doggy-reee
---
Probably intentional on your part but that's literally what happens ingame. Theres 2 rooms in the pass, one with the alive unicorn, one dead, and after pushing boulder you get teleported to the dead unicorn room.
---
&gt; I don't understand why I would want to kill 150 hellhounds if I could use my time killing blue dragons instead   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; because it's helpful to have high slayer for better monsters
---
Note that these two quotes are literally from the same exact sentence
---
Reminds me of back when they allowed loaning items in rs2. I bought d claws for the sole purpose of renting them out to poor players. Was good cash.
---
yeah the reason I started 5 minute strugglellefs is terrible miniboss rng reset after reset, since then i've gone back to trying to get a sub 5 minute regular gauntlet.  
---
seriously, i have a screenshot folder of all the back to back miniboss layouts i've run into
---
The Wildy isn't dead... it's just that there is no point to look around places that aren't hotspots (Rev caves, wildy bosses, Chaos temple, black chins, etc)
---
Excactly, you can bring salad robes, water stick, unholy book, nezzy, glory, climbing/mystic boots, rune gloves, black dhide, rcb, dds. It's like 250k risk. Once you learn how to not get smited bring an ags, tsod, claws, acb, dcb, or tent.
---
Generally speaking, investing into overpriced gear won't cut into your profits because once you're done camping whatever it is you're camping you sell your loot Tab and then you can sell the gear to get back all the money you spent on it in the first place. A lot of people are buying and selling a decent chunk of their Banks total value on a daily basis so that they can always use the best in slot stuff for whatever they happen to be fighting
---
gratz pls
---
Yep, and on top of everything this grind is extremely lonely. I could use a buddy to keep me motivated along the way!
---
Explain?
---
I love Underground Pass because it's such a unique quest, but I also hate it because holy fuck you fail way too much.
---
I love you both
---
RS needs more dark and gritty quests. Not cutesy horror quests like Misthalin Mystery. Gimme another Underground Pass, Creature of Fenkenstrain, or A Soul's Bane for those sweet, sweet, tortured souls.
---
gratz plz
---
My dumbass 8 year old self used to call it Awd-drew-deen

Unless you live in Antarctica I refuse to believe that you managed all of that "last night".

Pshhh everyone knows rannarrs are the dankest of all grimy herbs!

I disliked it because he was obviously faking it when he said he felt bad. I'm not sure what kind of reaction he was trying to get, but I typically don't enjoy fake reactions.
---
Jesus christ someone at Jagex must be dyslexic, the amount of spelling mistakes in their new content is insane
---
What if a new skill comes out?
---
Depends on if you do FFA or Splits, I was using split rates because that puts it closer to Saeldor's rate, just to play devil's advocate, but if you do FFA raids then yes, it's closer to around 200 hrs, or more since FFAs are less efficient.
---
For the Blade rate, I'm unsure if it's actually 1/500 for corrupted. I'm based off the Wiki rate where it says 175k/chest excluding uniques, 576k/chest including uniques. I took off like 200k gp/hr from the difference of chest prices to account for the Crystal Armour seed, then divided Saeldor's price by the remaining 2.6m gp/hr difference between the non-unique and unique chest rates to get an estimate of how long it'd take to get based on that. However something I noticed is that the Wiki's rates are extremely unreliable and should not be trusted due to the inflation of Crystal Shards. When I did my own calcs, the rates were way different, putting it closer to around 80 hours.
---
No I mean profit percentage. (Profit/cost)x100. I agree, the highest gp/hr is the one with the highest margin, hence my correction that I didn’t mean margin. And yes, you’re agreeing with me with your latter argument.
---
I did the puzzle on the day it came out and was following the wiki guide and I thought that I was almost done but then it just turned out that I was waiting for the guide to update and I had lots more to do
---

where can i find that emoji looking ass with the thumbs up
---
i need it for personal reasons
---
1. Are they *only* targeting HCIMs? If they see a normal account, or anything else, will they target them as well?
---
2. How are they targeting known HCIMs? Is there some sort of plugin on a client that just highlights them or something?
---
Glad we could figure this out, cheers
---
Gz! All at motherlode?

It includes everything on the Totus completionist sheet which is a comprehensive spreadsheet that includes every single completionist/collectionist task that has been discovered to date in the game, with a large group of players dedicating time to finding as many more as possible (though at this point basically everything beyond obscure tasks have been found). Collection log is the only thing not included on this sheet that falls under the “completionist” or “collectionist” standard that has been used in Runescape for many years. The only reason collection log is not included is because it would take longer than a human lifetime to complete. (It is however a side task that can be tracked). I have heard from many that Jase will likely be joining Totus and working on finishing this task list. The only considerably long tasks are : 200m all, all pets insured, 2k cm+tob capes, mutagens, all castle wars armour. Everything else on the list is relatively tame to achieve and can be done within 1-7 days or done passively
---
Because it is a Passage dingus
---
I bet he voted no to warding.
---
lmao I remember using this safespot on my main, but I got impatient, ran into Glough and died for full Guthix Dhide
---
Please by all means, change my mind about the presentation and how it's not imitative of freemium games.
---
I don’t think you get it.
---
I don't think jagex ever expects anyone to actually complete the collection log. Getting every pet alone requires such an absurd amount of time, let alone the clue tab.
---
I would get helm, superiors, and ring first. Superiors are obviously a bonus and then I use the ring every day as it’s the quickest TP to a fairy ring (there might be closer like in your house and stuff but it’s pretty close)
---
They should honestly release a comp cape. It should be purely cosmetical though, in order to avoid RS3's mistakes
---
Stay strong
---
Use this: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs
---
I check it every week or so to keep up with price fluctuations.
---
yeah, it's pretty isolating. i can join you in a few hours!
---
This is fun for them, who says they’re hurting themselves? Why do you feel the need to judge them? You’re not gonna win anything by saying “oh that guy is stupid for playing a game he so obviously enjoys”. You live your life how you want let them live theirs how they want and get on with your life lol. If anything spending time calling others dumb and criticizing strangers over their decisions is mental illness and should not be encouraged.
---
2012 gave us SOF, ugh. I prefer 2011

Members makes everything better. If you like the game, you're likely to be subbed for many many months so might aswell just have fun than work on a bucket list of f2p tasks.
---
If you're looking to sustain game time with bonds, you should know it takes a good while until you can do it without significant effort. When I became a member I tried doing blast furnace at \~500-600k gp/hr and hated having to grind even 5 hours every 2 weeks (not to mention the money I accumulated would just be gone, insetad of put towards buying items or training skills)
---
Because botting has gone way up from the twitch partnership benefits
---
Yeah. I was hoping for this.
---
I've heard those words for the last 15 years and it was only true once. We both got new coaches last year and well... you know how that game went.

I used melee and got it on the first try.

"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over until the number gets too big."

Its rng, I think the odds are 1/50 for each and then 1/100 for Dragon.
---
I got some in just a few kills and others took a lot.  I had to get like 250 kills for my Dragon Defender.
---
2nd btw
---
Least with slayer you make alot of gp, train combat stats and unlock better tasks
---
Underrated comment
---
A PVP thread. Oh boy, let me grab my popcorn. I will love to read the debate of pkrs vs normal players.
---
There are more types of efficiency than max xp/hour in one specific skill.  
---
Unless the account you're levelling is a non-iron man alt and you're willing to keep it drowning in Stamina Potions from your main, hitting Canifis and level 40 Agility and working towards the Graceful set asap is one of the most efficient things you can do, because that armor will be saving you time and money throughout your account's entire life.
---
I know, right? What an absolute ledged.
---
Train at ammonite/rock crabs
---
&gt;Also did you just try to chirp this dude for having a stable job? Man this community is weird.
---
who needs a stable job and good mental health when you can have 200m RC xp.
---
I am an adult and I have a job. I’d rather work less than an hour in real life and pay $11 for a month than spend hours and hours trying to grind for 200k/hr in f2p on my time off from work. I’d rather spend that time doing what I want in game.
---
What kind of stats and gear did you start with and what do you think the biggest upgrade for your vorkath kills?
---
Also by when we're you achieving consistent kills? So not dying much anymore
---
Just got my first aviansie task. Are you doing it solo? If so are you chinning? I feel like chins are too expensive
---
Necro post but whatever. I stopped playing for about 1.5 years and I was sure this place was the hub for ToB. Started playing again about 2 weeks ago and I was so disapointed to not even go there when doing the ToB intro quest. One year later and it seems like that place is totally unused.
---
I did it with a trident on my pure. You have to hit them multiple times sometimes for them to aggro onto you. When they lose aggressiveness, be ready to attack them again.
---
Thats a nice way of saying you spent time on your knees
---
Noo i mine iron til bout 50k left in level and then do motherload
---
Everyone in this comment needs to understand that the odds offered in chat and the odds actually given are controlled separately. The scripts they use can be made to say whatever you tell it to and to offer whatever odds you tell it to. I’m fairly certain that most dicers actually do keep their odds in line with what they advertise because they still make big profit doing that and they can maintain some reputation, but certainly there are scammers who are lying about their odds. 
---
Don’t use dicing anyway. If you want to gamble, go to the duel arena. It’s not against the rules and you can’t be scammed if you know what you’re doing.
---
I don’t have an herb sack, so when I tick fish I use my extra dirty herbs as place holders to make it faster to drop the fish because it’s closer to where I am clicking when I get my fish in inventory.

Lmao im talking about the blast furnace shop where ores get sold for 1/10 ge price 15 squares from a bank
---
Ah you're an iron, makes sense
---
Don't worry mate you dont need zammy spear for raids at all, go for it!
---
oof got me good? sorry for spreading info about the game? lol
---
I was not aware the ending oss/ose were regional accent things as well. TILx2
---
&gt;Also by when we're you achieving consistent kills? So not dying much anymore
---
Not the guy you replied to, but you stop dying when you start paying attention lol
---
going to be a lot of coins.  1.3bill to max!
---
Yeah it was wild seeing how many people fell for it. Much nicer player now, recently started playing again and basically play solo lol since all the old friends have quit or continue playing rs3
---
Lol whats the harm?
---
haha, it's how I borrowed gear from my brothers account when he wasnt home.  It was easier than remembering to log in again and give it back

Runelite's "WASD Camera" plugin
---
I think many ironmen who have killed demonic gorillas have noticed this. You get loads of rune and dragon javelin heads, so you check the alch prices and fletching xp and discover you lose gp if you make them into javelins.

I’m not actually. Getting 99 wc anyway, so I’m keeping the yews to alch cus why not? Need the mage exp . Instead of selling them I’ll do this and get money and xp.

yep that's a lotta bones

You right. Every percent counts eh?

Love it
---
Do kinda slayer. I just had a task of fire giants which usually sucks but I got a key and guess what? That key had 2 dragonfruit seeds aka 400k
---
Konar isn’t he fastest XP but it’s more fun IMO and potential for dope rewards
---
Gotcha ill keep that in mind. Also just noticed this drop is from one of the bodyguards not kree, thats crazy!
---
I love this whole thread.
---
Why does somebody have the name Andrew Wiggins 😂😂
---
I've actually come across worlds where no bot was present in the past few days. Which is incredible. My biggest gripe with them is that they clutter the chat around the GE making it harder to talk to people and keep track of their messages in the chat.
---
I just found this more rewarding!
---
Ya but why is it that the only issues found afterwards are several instances of making the game easier? All done in a very low-key manner with no other mistakes? I understand how easy it is for stuff to get janky in programming but the types of mistakes made are all in the exact same fashion.
---
Crazy that in just 20 spots is 1.2b xp
---
Got mine at 7kc lol
---
1/16k haha
---
pretty sure its like 40k xp, gotta remember you also have no other offensive bonuses at all except for a str ammy
---
That's a penis.
---
20k gph
---
I don't agree with your reasoning at all and your example generalizes as if everyone who grinds a 200m is like that. You don't know the person, you have never met or spoken to them yet here you are online judging them as if their life is sad. How are you able to conclude all these things?
---
Not trying to get my account stolen. No thanks. Keep your app. Nice work though

jagex to busy hiring kids straight outta nappies
---
Are you still going to? I bounced back&amp;forth between reg and corrupt and felt the same kind of burnout. 250 reg 135 corrupt roughly. Sunken cost is a mfer. I've taken to either not playing or afking stuff in the last couple days wondering if I should waste more time lol.
---
The meaning is enjoying the time you spend, what I said is not nihilistic, you're just mad because other people don't want to live your normie lifestyle and enjoy something you don't.
---
Yea I got it from a guard first task on my btw
---
I am level 53 in all of the attack stats, what should I be?
---
🤷🏿‍♀️ I hate agility, wasn't using a guide or anything, and needed cash. just did what I felt like doing at the time

It took me over a year to finish legends quest after I got barrows gloves.

dropping iron is 0 time if you drop the previous one as you mine the next. Banking it is way less effort tho

---
I’ve always paid real cash for my membership, but when I was moving I used bonds for 2 months across my 3 accounts to stop the wallet from bleeding anymore than it already was.
---
other guy just got fuckin smited
---
Where's the math come from?
---
More bosses means more points. You can turn them all on or just turn a few annoying ones off (like daganoth mother and anything that stuns you). Dream mentor bosses give a boat load of points but you need to turn on recipe for disaster bosses also for a good amount of points.
---
Laziest holy grail reference there is tbh.
---
Just pay for it. 11$ is nothing for a fun game. Then later once you can make easier money buy bonds
---
Thanks, reworded some stuff
---
If you never log on again, just will just think you've moved house
---
How are you supposed to lure it? I had to get 1 kc on arma for the fremmy elite diaries and I tried doing it using chins but the boss wouldn't stand in the right spot so I had to just range it with my acb. I took a while to kill solo but not that much longer than it took to get a single kc on all the other gwd bosses.
---
Im pretty sure its still like that to stop bots
---
It could happen on any 3 stage plants if you get lucky (or planned in advance) around the global growth cycles.
---
Ok
---
U act like 68 to 70 is forever rofl.
---
I'm interested as to whether you were actually hosting anything copyrighted or if they are just abusing the system?
---
Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time
---
I do have to agree that when I see these kinds of things, in the back of my mind im thinking about what a waste of life it is
---
It took me a very long time to finish rfd after I got dragon gloves because I was short a ton of quest points
---
So then it should be pronounced Ard Owen?
---
Get 7 quest points. Cook's Assistant, Sheep Sheerer, and Goblin Diplomacy or Romeo and Juliet will do it.
---
You don't need to use Bind spell on obor ?
---
Why would you even unlock the second floor? By the time you get 75 you should have enough for prospectors and gem and coal bags, and then you're 75 you should be going to blast mine and never use motherlode again
---
Aren’t you under drop rate for everything ?
---
Basically arma tries to melee you if you’re not focusing it, so you get it in corner by not hitting it at all. Then when you get it to corner you chin the melee minion and after each auto you click on Kree to make it think your focusing it, then immediately back to melee minion to continue the chin throwing and repeat. If that makes much sense lol
---
I make it a point never to tip anymore, I just treat it as free XP. So many of these shitty hosts are some of the most pretentious, self-entitled, and narcissistic RuneScapers I've ever seen.
---
Like dude come on, if you're going to give me shit and convince other people to rag on me for asking why your single wardrobe is locked in a bedroom with no door and no stairs, why would I ever give you (or anyone you seem friendly towards) anything? I just wanted to change my wrist guards you fucking prick. Stop having your bots advertise a complete house outside.
---
Yeah but you could calculate what somebody with a quest cape could get if they were tick perfect each time.
---
Bots that have membership wouldn't mine iron though, would they? Iron is a F2P botted item. There are better moneymakers in member for bots.
---
running to wintertodt
---
You don't come off as concerned, you come off as a classic judgmental annoying person. Even jumping to conclusions about my life because I told you to pipe down with the same boring comment that gets re-posted on literally every good achievement thread lmao. The guy is aware of what he's doing and he clearly enjoys it and even said he works full time. 
---
I'll tell you one thing, your comment is not going to change how anyone plays this game or does anything in their life. Futile walls of text. If they feel like they have a problem they'll talk to an expert, not a reddit couch psychiatrist.
---
Ay congrats, got one around 540 kc myself
---
Unfortunately I don't know how blending the legality of a will and your account will go, since you do not actually own your account, jagex does. If you are simply leaving the login details behind it will be just fine.

Nothing. The trick he's talking about (infinite free air talismans) doesn't work once you've finished the quest Rune Mysteries, and you can't mine rune essence until you've done that quest.

Because it’s a ratshit analogy? Dying in game, which changes the color of some pixels next to your name, vs potentially gettin shot and dying in real life? You’re so fucking brain dead it’s depressing
---
What makes you say that?  I was, years ago, when I was playing thousands of hours of games to numb myself to the problems in life I didn't want to address.  
---
These days, I work towards goals that feel meaningful to me IRL, and when I complete them, it gives me the leisure to enjoy games healthily.  It's not that the game is inherently bad, but that, like alcohol, it can be misused.  
---
So, no, I'm pretty happy.  But I worry when I see people in a situation similar to when I used Leeague in a numbing matter back in the day.  I hurt for them like I hurt for past me that didn't know better at the time.
---
Speak for yourself. There was no RS2 when I started playing.
---
Dh str scales on the amount of HP you don’t have. Dps calculators show the damage (and therefore the xp) is greater with obby when your hp level is less than 92ish
---
Yeah, barraging maniacal monkeys showed me a 7k kc I think.
---
Woah
---
no thats wrong, bp bronze darts beat rapier, but scythe only gets beat by dragon darts
---
I don't know the majority of the 4B people but if you're asking me if they are dependent and if they're suicidal you're asking me to judge someone without knowing anything about them. So my answer is, I'm not going to draw any conclusions. I know one person who has very high XP (above 2b) who works, isn't suicidal and got most of his gains while studying. Runescape lends itself to be a game to train like that. 
---
Streaming is also an occupation now. If someone is able to do those things, make an income, pay taxes and be happy then your argument is moot because you're generalizing it. 
---
I still do not agree with your generalizations.
---
Also to add some people rather just take a couple extra seconds to click less which helps a lot
---
I think the 30% Accuracy should remain, but the damage could be higher. I'd also love to see the bow get a special attack, but probably won't because of ragging, silly as that may be.
---
However, I don't think it is a good idea to make it work on the Halberd. The Halberd is a bad primary weapon, but it is already a good spec weapon. All this change would do is make a strong spec stronger without making it a more viable weapon. And you can't expect the same bonuses to the Bow, a primary weapon, to apply to a Halberd, a spec weapon; either you give a heft buff to make the Bow good and the Halberd OP or you give a smaller buff for Hally and the Bow doesn't get enough. The priority for the armor should be buffing the Crystal Bow so it is worthwhile; losing 10% Attack for 5% Damage is not doing a great job of that.

He was a damn child prodigy competing with grandmasters at like age 12, you're insane if you think that's mostly about his practice time and not that he's a 1 in a billion genius. He was born a genius, his brain operates differently, just like Einstein was and no matter how much people try they will likely never be on that level despite practice.
---
&gt;And I love how you assume I'm average lmao. You know nothing about me
---
Of course I'll assume you're average and not on the level of a genius, there's a 1 in a few million chance I'm wrong. Guess which odds I'll take? That's some below average response, I know that much though.
---
"I'm ardougne with this shit"
---
That's how i pronounce it.
---
Scythe is tied with rune darts, but you take a fuck ton more damage in melee gear due to magic attacks.
---
I bet you eat food
---
lots of people that play this game are likely on the spectrum. not talking shit, its just the nature of the game. people on the spectrum really prefer rigidity and sometimes very minor changes can cause irrational reactions.

I used super combats the whole time, much more afk but less consistent exp. was always around 95-100k tho

Any other noobs with sub 90 stats get hit with that existential dread when you realize how long it took you to hit 70s and that 70 is just a drop in the bucket in the scheme of things?  That you can play this game for years and still not reach end game?  
---
Yeah me neither
---
Huh, i had forgotten about these people :p it occasionally happened to me when i used to spend a lot of time messing about with new weapons/equipment in white portal. There was one guy who went out of his way to try to rag me every time he saw me on that world because i D claw rushed him once. When i went to do something else he would pm me saying things like 'lo0o0l had enough? did i make you quit white portal? i'll be waiting for you xoxox' ect. Strange guy but it always made me laugh.
---
How are you dying? This made me legit sad man, all the best ♥️
---
It's the loneliness for me. I just came back to OSRS after about 5 years. I'm having a lot of fun getting back into things, but the game is like 99.9999999999999999999999999999% less social than even a couple of years ago.
---
I almost never run into someone who will strike up a conversation with me. I add **MAYBE** 1 person to my friend's list a week. The only people I regularly communicate with are the ones that helped me out when I was still lvl 3 last week, and people who have been on my friend's list for like 10 years.
---
I just wish I could run into or meet other random players and have fun like I used to. Nobody seems to care about any of that kind of stuff anymore. Which I find incredibly hard to comprehend. What are you even working towards if you're not an Iron Man, don't talk to anyone who walks up to you, and never just hang out and have fun? What ever happened to group questing? Iron Man is a little different, that's supposed to be mostly single-player.
---
Plz jagex
---
Make an ironman and stand alone. there, problem solved.
---
His account has 9.6k EHP on f2p
---
I agree with your points there, but it also depends on what kind of effort the person puts into it. Don't consider it to be that bad if one does it as a side project when doing something else irl, e.g. reading books, learning new skills or whatnot.

You in lemoore? F-35's took over the very end hangar next to our squadron and all the canopy spots where we used to park our jets. Funny thing is that the F-35's APU blows out the top, so they could only park them halfway under. Hahaha

Not on this post. Checkmate atheists.

Bots that mine it on F2P have the worlds to themselves and don't have to compete for it. It's not the best but when memberships is literally free and you can make thousands of bots, its always profit
---
&gt; Also, im pretty sure no one gives a shit about people getting harassed in runescape.
---
Pretty sure someone being harrassed would disagree. But if it is the case I am thinking of, the video maker was asked to censor the name and declined to do so and following the video, the player mentioned lots of messages, crashing, and the like.
---
If you have an itchy trigger finger and are ready to member up then go ahead, but if you still have stuff you want to do in F2P then watch the Bond tracker on the official grand exchange website and put in a buy request in the low 4 millions so that next time it dips you can get a cheap bond.

Nice, seems you have put some effort in this guide.

Hey /u/Netbook_Pro , do you only do f2p or do you have another account which is members where you can do the rest of the content in the game as well?
---
Just curious what’s your fletching level? You could cut redwoods and fletch into shields then alch those if you really wanted to.
---
It's especially hilarious that you didn't actually need to avoid them, your character just did it.  I have played since 2005 or so and never even knew there was bubbles lol.
---
Gamebreaking changes though
---
For everyone here, keep in mind that they aren’t even on the account. Rag bots do exist and should be instantly ip banned. No reason why raggers should exist in the game, they just grief everyone else.
---
After I got the 10k gp from SoS I did a bit of wildly looting to get some starter GP, I got gassed over a few strength amulets let alone 1 mill in loot lmao.
---
I've always gone with my-wreck
---
It’s about to be 75. So I’m assuming I don’t have the level for that. (Without consulting any info) but that’s good to know.
---
Not
---
Tbh you don't need to grind any stats in f2p since the methods in p2p are way faster and less packed, but if you want to take it slowly I would advise getting some base stats and doing quests. Once in p2p aim for barrows gloves and completing diaries.
---
I went from 82-93 range doing this grind so it wasn't all for nothing.
---
Hope this becomes a new meme format.
---
WOOOW
---
Depends on how you look at things. $11 takes no time at all to make irl. 4mil also take no time at all to make in game. I value my irl money more than in game money hands down. even if thats 4mil off my next gear upgrade im in absolutely no rush to get the best things in game. Im just tryna enjoy the game as a nice distraction when im bored.
---
That )11 even tho its not much can go to something else more useful irl
---
These are vague platitudes.  Yes, I get it, it's wrong to assume that someone spending (tens of?) thousands of hours on a completely hollow grind with zero utility for himself or anyone else was doing so in an unhealthy way.  Maybe he was brimming with excitement the entire time.  
---
But maybe defaulting to, "We can't discuss bad habits because someone will get angry and call you judgmental," isn't a good place for a discussion forum to start from.
---
Do I 100 percent need slave? I have normal one now atm

I can understand why they dont want a 3rd party app asking for peoples login. I never used the app and maybe it was legit and really good but i can understand why they dont want a 3rd party app taking peoples login info when so many people are constantly complaining about account security
---
"Source: I did it one time recently and failed less, 20x easier confirmed."
---
I meant that pets would have a separate cape reward and treasure trails too.
---
Yeah I’m not planning to heavily grind out too many stats in f2p, but I also don’t want to be held back by being too low a level and therefore not being able to do barrows etc, what attack/strength/def stats would you recommend I get in f2p before I switch to membership?
---
You wot
---
😭😭
---
sometimes I just wish skills stopped at 99. This is pointless af
---
I think they are 6-7 now
---
It's not worth it until you have morty hard done anyways.
---
I agree, but - well, how long does it take to get 200million hitpoints experience as F2P  Remember not only is it at F2P combat rates, but hitpoints is - what was it, 1/4th?  Of the experience for standard combat abilities.  How can you get 200million xp in 4 combat skills worth of experience while also maintaining a healthy life outside of work?
---
Tbh I always said it as ardrougne
---
Because that's what I thought it was back when I was a kid. I didn't realize until I grew up and played osrs that I imagined that extra r. I can't stop calling it that though
---
I just started it yesterday. 65kc at the moment with 6 mvp drops and 8mil total in loot with no uniques.. Could def have had better loot since at least 10 of the kills were 20k loot. Groups of 4-6 seem to be the sweet spot for me, any less and kills take too long and anymore it seems my average loot per kill drops to ~60k.
---
So I'd say it's still pretty decent.
---
Its apparently i-li-zhen. ive heard 0 people say it that way.
---
Absolute mad lad
---
LOL I actually did this on my main 2 years ago
---
How did you do it?  It seems like it must've taken thousands of hours at a minimum.

\[Hmm\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHC1230OpOg&amp;ab\_channel=JoelTodd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHC1230OpOg&amp;ab_channel=JoelTodd))
---
the kid isn't relevant and he shouldn't have been in the wilderness if he didn't want to die. I'd be both of my nuts and my first born child that it doesn't have dislikes because of  some idiot ass hcim asking for his name to be censored.
---
Yeah it’s 90+ I believe. Oh well
---
What's the difference between this, and doing anything else in OSRS?   
---
Note, I do agree going for 200m is a complete waste of time.
---
Soft femboys are cool and chill 😎
---
92 is more like 50% of the way to 99
---
Gz can honesty say for ironmen this drop isn’t worth chasing.
---
Realized later now that it should be a static bronze pickaxe instead. Either way its nice and fitting visually as well.
---
Also vorkath with dchb is the best moneymaker in the game behind solo raids 1( maybe flipping /merching but I don't count those as money makers) and itsnt too hard to learn.
---
Do you prefer staff or halberd, or do you do 5-1 to constantly range?
---
No... but added to the time those quests take it is a long time.  
---
I know you could have figured this one out on your own, you can do it.
---
Shit, really?
---
Shit.
---
I think so yeah, cause I remember someone posting something like this

---
Yes.
---
Playing/afking consistently for 4 years.
---
Why wouldnt you need ovl with obby? And shouldn’t you click anyway to lower hp and absorption dmg?
---
Yes it did? It's been on the map since 2004.
---
Of looking for motivation to do other skills to better your farming, there are all the quests that give you more farming patches / disease free patches . Like my arms big adventure and making friends with my arm . And roving elves for the extra tree spot . Both the elf and troll questline gives you some farming rewards and it will give you an goal that will benefit you farming level while also giving you an excuse to train other skills.
---
If you get the reward from the elite lumbridge diary then you don't need the d-staff. Instead you can just use the rings. Neat!
---
I’ve left it at 350 today, but I think I’ll keep going. Will probably just reduce the frequency/number of runs per day.
---
Well the system doesnt know that the boost is from a regular potion. What it does know is to reset your stat back to base when the timer runs up. Seems intended to me
---
You mean I shouldn’t look up quick guides and hold spacebar through the whole thing?
---
Always hally bow for me, before the nerf I would take either staff or hally depending on which I found first, but now I always have enough time to find the hally.
---
Yarrr, it were the guides indeed. 
---
They be spoilin the game and yer grammarrrrr
---
really ?
---
Grats, I’ve been grinding medium clues for a while now trying to get rangers to bankroll a build I wanna do. But, no luck
---
Way back in the day I was trying to grind out 99 magic through high alch. I was wearing Sara's white Cape, and the. Blessed dhide. Back then each peice was around a mill or more. I was standing on a popular world that was the pvp hotspot. I was standing a tile behind the start of the wilderness (this was before they made the trench or anyway to stop accidentally going into wildy) just alching my thousands of yew bows. 
---
I'm enjoying watching the players fight and talking to other alchers. A guy trades me. I accept and suddenly my character is walking backwards into lvl 1 or 2 wildly. Instantly frozen and massacred since I wasnt there to fight. Apparently there was a way to make players walk backwards past the line when they tried to move to the trader. I lost so much money and supplies. But I was more pissed I lost that outfit!
---
Tele-alching, I tele-alched Camelot to 75 mage in my first weeks of playing and it was pretty fast all things considered.
---
Dude sold a bunch of elys in one ge slot, exceeding the 2,1B cap. The last one sold to the only offer that could fit in the remaining space of the cashstack
---
\&gt;INB4 Jagex actually does it
---
Yea its a method, never said it was gud lul
---
I'm just waiting on the hopeful chance that the Zaros halo makes it in when then new LMS stuff gets polled.
---
Could be the very next one :) Gl !
---
300 runs and i still havent gotten barrows gloves😞
---
Was just thinking about that the other day, would be ideal. Halos are so nice
---
I hate this sentiment, because the way you wrote it implies that playing efficiently cannot be fun.
---
Efficiency is a slider. You aren't either efficient or you're not - you're 70% efficient, for instance. You do the most efficient method, that you still personally think is fun.
---
no one plays this game and thinks oh shucks I hate efficiency let me go kill black dragons with bronze arrows to stick it to the man. as long as being more efficient isn't significantly more effort people will generally do it.
---
Can someone add a botched prayer flick on top of this and a 73 hitsplat when the punch connects? I'd love to but I suck at animation :(
---
You seems to know a lot about these sheep, what attempt was this?
---
Thanks i guess it was a glitch that they fixed
---
Happens in real life too mate :/
---
It's like the twitch plays Pokemon ledge
---
&gt; spending every single second
---
Ardoug is what i always said.
---
actually i do pronounce those Bs really subtly
---
They nerfed the hell out of them.
---
In my anecdotal experience, the previous actual rate was way higher than what the wiki suggested, and the current actual rates are lower than the already nerfed lower rates that are on the wiki.
---
I get roughly the same amount of nests with yews that I did with willows. Wiki says average 8 per run and I think that's way high for yews.
---
It doesn't really come off that way in the video a lot, it's hard to tell whether he was joking or not. He has "felt bad" for people in the past and often compensated for whatever it was he did that made him feel that way.

Farming Timer Rework &amp; Skilling QoL

15 February 2018
---
Farming Timer Rework &amp; Skilling QoL 
---
This week sees the release of the highly-anticipated Farming Timer Rework! Alongside that, many of the "QoL Month Week 2: Skilling" suggestions that passed the most recent in-game poll are also being released.
---
Farming Timer Rework
---
Keen farmers will have known that crop growth timer system in RuneScape has some irregularities, dating back to the original launch of the skill. Depending on when a player chose to log in &amp; out, or hop worlds, they could wind up causing growth ticks to not happen, slowing down the patch potentially by hours or days. As Old School RuneScape players make such heavy use of the world-hopper, this could be very annoying. 
---
Aside from growth ticks sometimes failing to run, the legacy system - first programmed in 2005 - was remarkably complex, making it quite unfeasible to identify specific problems inside it. Sometimes those were advantageous for players, such as the Gnome Stronghold fruit tree patch tending to grow faster than other fruit trees. However, they were more often drawbacks, especially where hardwood patches could be delayed for days. 
---
In this update, we've deleted the entire timer system and written a new one. 
---
Before describing the new system, it's worth taking a moment to say what a growth tick actually is. Imagine the game has clocks that tick every 5 minutes, every 10 minutes, every 20 minutes, every 40 minutes, and so on. 
---
- The fastest crops grow whenever a 5-minute tick occurs. This mostly applies to weeds and flowers. 
---
- Slightly slower crops grow whenever a 10-minute tick occurs. This applies to crops grown in allotments. 
---
- Slower crops grow whenever a 20-minute tick occurs. This applies to herbs and bushes. 
---
- Even slower crops grow whenever a 40-minute tick occurs. This applies primarily to tree patches. 
---
- Other crops grow on 80-minute ticks (belladonna), 160-minute ticks (fruit trees), 320-minute ticks (spirit trees) and 640-minute ticks (hardwood). 
---
For example, onions grow on the 10-minute tick. If you've got your seed planted before a 10-minute tick occurs, it'll grow when the tick happens. If you missed it, you'll have to wait for the next 10-minute tick to come around - it won't piggyback on the next 5-minute tick. 
---
The main problem with the old system was that by logging in and out at unfortunate intervals, including world-hopping, you could make a tick never happen at all. That would make your crop take longer to grow - substantially longer, in the case of slow ticks. 
---
The new system aims to solve that problem. Logging in and out should no longer stop a tick from happening to you. This means that once your seed is in the ground, you'll know roughly how long it'll take to get from its first growth tick to its fully-grown state. 
---
You do still have to wait for the relevant ticks for your crop, though. The system should handle logouts and world-hopping far better than it has over the last decade, but we can't offer individual timers for each patch to let their growth start at the exact moment when you plant your seed. 
---
As you can imagine, rewriting the entire growth timer system has been a very large job, with the potential to impact just about all the Farming code. We've given it a considerable amount of testing, but your patience would be very much appreciated if you run into problems. You can report bugs by right-clicking the 'Report' button in the game - it opens a bug report form that gathers extra info about your account's state to help the testers work out what's going on for you. 
---
For a start, please don't be alarmed if your crop durations are disrupted by a few minutes as the system transitions from the old version to the new one. 
---

Go to heck
---
Decorative pickaxes are so ugly I can’t believe people use them xD
---
&gt;Edit: being logged out when the global tick happens will cause you to miss the plant growth
---
no it will not. since the rework i have not missed a single growth tick, and I had spreadsheets to track that
---
To prove that they have more time then most people.

Fucked up. But my kind of humor.

I'd say 70 range or flat 70 melee stats to do it effectively, but melee preferrably

Maybe they have high defense and HP because it feels like it takes a long time. I also just hate how it seems like you can't stay in one spot to fight them, partially because they aren't aggressive and partially because of the way they move. Basically when I do it (task-only area always) I'm going: (1) click wyrm to run over and shoot it; (2) click wyrm again because for some reason it fucking changes form and you aren't attacking it anymore; (3) make sure you didn't run too close and get in melee distance, so maybe click again to back up; (4) run over to grab drops that go 2 tiles away from where it seemed the wyrm was actually standing; (5) suddenly no wyrms are nearby because they slithered away with that stupid animation, so run over and click another one to start over.

Even if they were super weak the process is kind of annoying compared to almost anything else. It's like, think about how annoying it is when you're afking a particular monster and then they lose aggression so you have to look up and trigger it every time. It's that, but always, and you also have to trigger twice.
