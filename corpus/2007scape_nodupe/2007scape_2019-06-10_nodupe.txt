:( how much u got
---
They do it for super small stuff, knowing that it will get circlejerked in this sub for some good points with the community, but as soon as some real complaints or comments appear they absolutely ignore it.
---

---
I'm of the idea that people should be responsible for their own account safety, and that jagex already has the tools in place for each of us to secure our accounts, but pvp, the lack of gold sinks, duel arena impacting people's real lifes, etc, are all legitimate concerns that jagex continue to ignore.
---
So are jmods, why are they able to act the exact same way on twitter?
---
That fakie tre was so clean
---
Most people go for the noted dk bones with 77 rc
---
If your getting 77 and stopping it's for dk bones
---
If you plan to keep rcing it's for the bloods.

All these comments say it's for bloods, but most pvmers r going for notes dk bones with 77 rc

Good that Osrs has embraced raid culture from Vanilla WoW

The surprising part is he's made it this far in the game and still hasn't killed one, or done the diary.

Yeah man, I get it and I believe you. Just naturally thought it may have been a bought account.

I've always used the wiki for quests :P

Pegs are only like +5 ranged bonus  over blessed and Ward is only like 20 ranged bonus

Ranged bonus is just accuarcy, while rigour has a damage boost aspect to it as well.

Correct, why not protect the stupid though?

This is awesome. Makes me dizzy too lol. Never learned how to skate :P

 7 . 3. will be ignored cause it doesn't fit the 'jagex bad, grr' rhetoric.

Pretty sure that’s “unmodly” behavior which basically means yes you can’t speak out against them.

Is there some context missing with this tweet? Why is everyone acting like Orion, someone completely unrelated to the conversation and not even on the support staff, is the devil because he told a guy to get a life after the guy called him a clown?

Your dad doesn't seem to mind.

Hey this deserves big respect forever and always, congrats my friend

Wait how was a temporary event a long lasting negative impactor on the game?
---
That’s some nice luck lol
---
Between yesterday and today, did about 7 or 8 Jad attempts. Still no cape. :(
---
Last attempt went pretty decent in regard to prayer flicking (only one or two missed ones) but I ended up dying to the healers.
---
Pretty frustrated at all the wasted time/money on this damn cape. Don't know why I'm having such a hard time with it.
---
the p mod stood up for the person getting fucked by customer support
---
Agreed, I see people actually trying to defend this sort of abuse. If all she wanted to do was highlight the different skill sets involved, she could’ve said “there are many employees at Jagex that don’t directly deal with or have knowledge of x, y, z”. Instead she took a very rude and downright demeaning route and attached a role with a lower income. It’s downright disgusting.
---
try contacting police that someone is tryin to get your user info from your bank account it is a theft under the criminal law... but let me see hmm almost as it is nearly impossible to do anything about it

A good pmod should speak out and get purged. If you’re complacent you’re not a good pmod imo. What will they do? Remove all pmods?
---
It’s like with not hiding pill results. Jagex made such a god damn fuss about it. They changed it when they believed it would help their suggested content pass. They are just lazy. They don’t have any keen insights preventing them from making this decision.

I never disagreed with the logic of the examine text. I was saying what was described in the previous comment wasn’t describing the worse of the gem by cutting but it’s usefulness as an item.

part of it is the crude wording and the other part is that it basically shows 'in-fighting'. Why the fuck would a company tolerate it's staff/volunteers talking trash about it ***publically***. That's why there's a public forum and a private one.
---
That's not to say p-mods can never publically disagree, but maybe word it less aggressively. Do you think this incident would be treated differently anywhere else (second offensive to boot)
---
He was warned once, due to using Ring of Coins to trick noobs.

Somehow this is "unprofessional" but jmods doing smackdowns on reddit it totally ok or something. I really don't get this sub sometimes. Jagex has always been unprofessional.

Seed vault though

Her point was that she has nothing to do with account security, so while it is horrible that Jagex as a company is bad with customer support, complaining to developers who have nothing to do with it is counter intuitive.

HAHAHAHA this thread is golden. Such a good dev team yet they always manage to destroy their PR in the dumbest fuckin ways. Good ole Jagex luv u guys
---
Pretty much everywhere else I use 2fa I have to contact support and wait 1-2+ weeks for it to be removed.  Some require me to call them too, or give identifying info.  Jagex is lazy as fuck, sorry.  This has been a huge complaint, and like all of the other big problems they have done nothing useful.
---
How is that a fuck up tho? Nothing happened in game and it doesn't affect it
---
Almost at 100 qp... All mobile.. All slayermusiq1... And getting all my skills up to 40 that arent combat..

Seriously though I’ve been playing this game since I was seven back in 2005 if you even halfway take care to not click on sketchy links or anything and have proper passwords and Authenticators and a bank pin the chances of getting hacked and losing everything is very slim
---
B-b-but they’re just drawings like you said.

Ghouls are incredibly easy. 1k kills/hr easily w a cannon at the graveyard spot

Way longer than its worth to be honest, especially if you have no prior experience with the game.

The games been out for too long to not have basic account security. If they had cared, it would have been taken care of a long time ago.

Yes

It's a moral fuckup. Jogglebox is stooping down to the level of the British government and condemning wrongthink.

Phew, I was worried we were gonna have another dramaless month.

My condolences to you atleast youd not alone my friend is around 50m xp without one as well

Only time I've ever had any account of any type hacked was osrs. Community downvoted me to hell and said to not give out passwords...
---
yes for any patch you can pay for, it wont get diseased(if you pay)
---
Still waiting.
---
Same, that and the day I got noted pots from a hard clue
---
There are still 2^n case permutations, and I do have passwords that aren’t just variations in case too. It’s not worth the effort of trying to brute force every permutation on the off chance that somebody does use a case variation of a known password, especially because I keep unique passwords for the things that actually matter. 
---
Of course me admitting I do so is a security risk, but I’ll delete these comments in a couple days.

Crafting is a decent F2P moneymaker. You buy gold bars and a gem and craft it into rings/etc and it gets you some money and xp.

Q
---
Exactly. Now you can play the game.
---
Damn bro gl
---
Crabs are such a bland a lame training method. So useless outside of xp
---
Well that’s very unlike the expected behavior of a Jmod. Wonder if they’ll take her crown... 🤔
---
Alright, make the one of the stun spells also prevent teleportation and then raise it's level requirement to 85, nobody uses those anyway. Or if you want a less hyperbolic example consider that Jagex could just make f2p teleport spells impossible to cast while in pvp combat.
---
There is no simple demarcation between "altering content" and "introducing content." This is why I have gone to such great lengths to explain how narrow a change f2p teleblock is. It's a change akin to the void nerf, not adding zeah, raids, or the blowpipe.
---

Many online systems have a system set up where if you login from a new location you have to verify through email, mobile phone, authenticator etc., it's not the end of the fucking world people appreciate the added security.
---
Probably the most fun boss fight I’ve ever done
---
Was watching a Pmod stream and someone was spamming the N word right next to them. Didn't even look at the chat once or do anything about it. Lmao.
---
They want him to take a dick up the ass and have the courtesy to lube up before he takes it.
---
this is very sexual
---
Yeah, I don't disagree with you at all there. The problem is that the fight itself was designed fine, all that needs to happen is a tweak to make them be a viable option for either GP or XP. The dude above is just shitting on the bosses as a whole and that's not really fair.
---
waterfall quest is a nice one to get done early, also the ones that give you transport options (tree gnome village, grand tree, lost city/fairy tale etc)
---
&gt; Alright, make the one of the stun spells also prevent teleportation and then raise it's level requirement to 85, nobody uses those anyway. Or if you want a less hyperbolic example consider that Jagex could just make f2p teleport spells impossible to cast while in pvp combat.
---
?? Alright, change one of the bolt spells to be sara strike instead. 
---
&gt; There is no simple demarcation between "altering content" and "introducing content."
---
Its very simple, if you use logic like me. "Introducing content" doesnt exist. "Alterint content" is changing content that already exists so its balanced. It doesnt get any more simple than that. Adding blue dhide chaps to f2p is a smaller change than teleblock. That doesnt make it game integrity.
---
you have to go to watson's house to toggle mimic's on, they're off by default. then when you go to open your elite/master casket, it will inform you if you have a mimic or not. if you have one you have to go to watson's house to fight it. you cannot just go to watson's house to get a mimic on every clue, it's pretty rare.
---
What do you do after you have enough gp to buy everything you want?
---
It works
---
Read the rest of the sentence.
---
Technically sapphires, but buying one per world is terrible. Onyx is good. The osrs wiki has gp per tokkul rates for each shop, make sure you're checking the karamja gloves tab tho
---
Per the wiki it looks like obby platebody/legs &gt; obby sword/helmer&gt; uncut onyx &gt; obby cape

I'm not saying that I'm surprised or anything, just saying take a bit of a load of the hate off [Mod Maz](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/byk9ij/maz_walked_right_into_this_one_lol/) and direct a little his way

I have a new account that is 10 hp. I want to do wintertodt on it early since that is so easy with 10 hp. Can I bank all the crates and then open them when my other skills are higher so that I can get better rewards?

These j mods really don't understand that when shit goes down on Reddit they should keep their silly comments to themselves.

Shouldn't corner trick with lag.
---
Thanks for this positivity, sir. The RS community legitimately needs more people like you. There's so much toxicity in some RS posts, and it's discouraging. Glad to come upon this comment.

Hey, being maxed is when you can finally bankstand without feeling bad. Load up on poison chalices and gnome balls and start wandering around.

I've got a bad anal herpes outbreak atm. Ex gf gave it to me whenever she pegged me a while back.

They're volunteers: **they do not exist on the company ladder at all**. They are members of the public, and in this instance, __also customers__.

Quite frankly: If both your customers and the people who do *free work* for you, are both screaming at you that you're showing extreme negligence and disdain toward them, you're probably not *just* a blameless victim of circumstance.

if you have a main why are you going to gimp yourself/your team and do it on an account with objectively worse stats

Unfortunately that claim is sourceless, however if you ever see someone get the Phoenix (broadcast in the chat) as Wintertodt dies, that means they got it off of the boss kill. I'll look for a video of it happening, but no guarantees.

This why you only grind like a level or two a month for the skills you hate. Tolerate the grind for an hour and leave if you think it sucks.

Spotted Cow is a unit of a beer. Absolute unit. Anyone outside Wisconsin is seriously missing out.

I always use a RoW, a Slayer Ring, a House Tab, or a Cammy Tab. Depends on the situation.
---
I mean, what would the cops do? Stake outside your house for hours to see if the guy comes back while theres other things going on that requires immediate attention? It sucks that you got your house broken into, it really does. But it really isnt something they can prevent unless they get a call about it while it's in progress.
---
The ice place that you go to during st maybe

That one was already taken.

What is the trick?
---
My favorite fuck up from Jagex’s security team is being able to roll back the game several hours to fix a bug, but not be able to check my account’s items within the same time frame to resolve a hacking issue. Someone stole all my money and rune armor once and basically the support message was a big fucking middle finger.
---
Looks like he reverted so its indeed a fakie
---
Got the pet at 400KC 😚 sorry buddy
---
I’m down to boss for sure add rsn “xkm” could get in discord together too

Through other leaks. When I checked my email it turns out that like 7 different sites that I used it on got leaked. On top of that one of my friend’s bank info was leaked by a university he applied to. There’s tons of situations (not necessarily directly linked to RuneScape) that gets your info leaked
---
Oh shit ain’t that a double set

Okay, so I’ve been doing a fair bit of training at NMZ lately, and I always see people saying DO NOT use DH until like 92 HP. 
---
However, testing max hit on a combat dummy I’m able to hit a max of 43 with 1 HP and full Dharok’s, and a max hit of only 28 with full obsidian, along with the sword and necklace. 
---
Stats are 70 attack and defense, 75 strength and 74 HP. Can someone clear up why Dharok’s would not be the best equipment to use? Thanks :)

Great job, J-mod team. You've not only managed to somehow keep your community desperately hoping to fix things, you've even got them brown nosing you guys, coming to the aid of rescue.   
---
The thing is, your security issues have been going on well before OSRS, or RS3. It would take days at a time to get a response, if that. Was it manually done? Sure. But it's been horrendous for well over a decade, and to have a p-mod, who was sick of all the talk, and no action, de-modded due to one outburst about your horrendous will to act on helping someone apart of your very own community. Will I get flak for stating my opinion? Probably. Is the code spaghetti and horrible? Sure. But you've had YEARS to fix it, and now that it's escalated into a public fray, you've decided to start doing something about it? Sorry, but that's just pathetic. 
---
Your lack of action when it comes to security detail is appalling. Hell, I spent hours on end, trying to find the right thing I needed to contact a customer support that, shockingly, doesn't exist. News flash. Not all problems relate to a simple 10 items. There maybe many others that people need to contact you about, and yet, there is no contact to be found. Even Steam, which is notoriously bad, is much better than this shocking state.  
---
Not only that, but you have a bot banning system that DOESN'T WORK. Yet, weirdly, for quite a lot of other games, they've been right on top of it since the beginning. Even WoW ensured any issues were unheard of. There were either very few bots, or a ban wave had just happened. My point being, you need to stop talking, and actually start acting for gods sake. Actions speak louder than words. We've heard tall tales of promises in the past, with near all of them not coming through. Start acting, and actually fix your shit, before taking it out on a P-mod who was sick and tired of having the flaws they point out, shoved aside as nothing more than ramblings.
---
Why does this not have 2k+ upvotes
---
the entire argument is about players messaging a twitter account for cyber investigations into hacking
---
stay on topic
---
Currently trying to rebuild a chill PVM/skilling clan, hit us up in game The07grindz and we will add ya to the Discord !
---
this is the only argument to make

jagex twitter isn't the FBI cyber crimes unit
---
Lol where tf are you getting these values? People will *attempt* to sell accounts for insane amounts but no one is actually paying that much...
---
Buy an extra window next time and you shouldn’t get robbed again
---
Price of gp had been steadily declining since the launch of osrs, it never remained at 1:1 ratio for very long. 
---
With that being said, the release of the DA tax actually increased the value of gp for the first time. Inflation has never been so well under control as it is right now.
---
Just make an account.  Buying accounts is  against the rules.
---
Make an account then and play the game.
---
An actual PMod should be using the methods they have at their disposal that a regular player does not to address game issues. This was an unacceptable, unprovoked, and poorly addressed attack on a game that they are required by their own actions to support. Fuck thanks and absolutely everything he stands for
---
Op
---
Bookmarked. This thread has some good security info.
---
Thanks for your input. We do have battery savings but that’s toggled as well. However, we also have the option to allow background data refresh on MOST apps. It has to be built in by the developer. Jagex has not enabled it for iPhone users....
---
Yeah I have both, no one ever says initiate armor. Everyone says the proselyte because it’s also easy to get yet much better.
---
2. 2. Authenticator must be active at all times
---
Because that helps
---
That is the current step I’m on
---
How do you take a bad quality screen shot? Honestly just confused on that. It was done through the computer and not a cell phone?
---
Even if the engine makes this tricky Id absolutely love to see this in game. The current interface actively gives me anxiety
---
Yep you can. I have a friend who has done it, he's got untrimmed and trimmed prayer cape, trimmed range and magic. It's been a bit over a year since he did it so I just had to make sure it still works after a couple OSRS updates but it seems it does.
---
just max lol
---
Ge price volatility is way too high to be able to claim that it's a result of deflation, I'd bet something else is definitely at play. But with that being said, the staking tax has brought inflation under control and the black market value of gp actually did increase somewhat recently (not sure how it's been for the last couple months though) so yeah, we're probably in a deflationary economy right now.

How many buckets do I have?

They need to allow special characters as part of passwords. afaik, you're limited to numbers and letters, and that's just such horseshit.
---
Laughs in turoths and kurasks
---
&gt; You really don’t understand that attraction to certain features don’t have to be “real?” Are you really that dense. That’s why they make those cartoon characters with huge tits because you losers love that shit. It’s not real but you’re still attracted to it.
---
literally anime is real the post
---
&gt;If you’re attracted to prepubescent girls “real” or not you are a categorically a pedophile. You are indulging and attracted to something that isn’t normal.
---
good things it's a cartoon.
---
&gt;You pedophiles will never win this argument. The first step to going to rehab is accepting you have a problem. Something people who love Lolis will never admit. And there will always be one to act out on those urges.
---
I don't like loli's, I just don't think it's a good idea to promote government censorship, of anykind, on cartoons. It's also ignoring the fact that there are actual major pedophilia rings actually in the UK parliament ([ex 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal) [ex 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_paedophile_dossier) and [ex 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_in_the_United_Kingdom#Notable_incidents) and they use this as diversion to show like they're actually doing something when they aren't.
---
But again, it's easier to reply to retards like you with "cartoons" because you aren't looking at actual facts. You're arguing on emotion.
---
I'm not trynna be at PC all day for  a few hundred points

&gt; It is a matter of politicizing - because you did. As for it being hypothetical, yes it was hypothetical; because at the point in time that you hypothesized; it was not known to be true

“It’s that way because I deem it so!” yawn
---
&gt; As for your stereotyping of a massive group of people 
---
Double yawn

&gt; full blown political debate.

Racial discourse isn’t inherently political, especially when it’s intersected with gaming discourse in this context. Sure must be fun to railroad and ignore context though. Let’s do this again sometime!

what's wrong with wyverns, though? they're a pretty decent task and most of the time quick and doable in one inventory for me. (not that it really matters because i never see anybody in the task only caves lol)

Since you want to talk about facts so much although you haven’t presented any I’ll give you some.
---
It’s a fact that during therapy if you allow pedophiles to consume child pornography their willingness to act on those urges lessen. Does this mean we make child pornography legal? No of course not.
---
Drawn depictions of sex give the same allure as real videos is also a fact. If it wasn’t then there wouldn’t be billions of dollars in the market of pornography. There’s even erotic stories that people get off too.
---
So here’s you another fact. Not everyone who enjoys lolicon porn is a pedophile but every pedophile is attracted to lolicon porn.
---
So what do we do about sexual depictions of minors then? Our focus shouldn’t be on that, we should look at helping people with these urges towards minors and helping lessen the stigma against people like this. Treat it as a mental illness. Help them rehabilitate. But to say that it’s not an issue at all is disingenuous and incredibly naïve.
---
You’re the one talking about having government  censorship. You’re the one talking about emotions. You’re the one talking about facts without giving any. And why? Because you’re too worried about being labeled a pedophile.

Right? All this has shown is that I can never trust a pmod on any sensitive topic.

Fossil Island Wyverns are unique because they don't need to take a block spot, so it's just a one time block for 500 pts so it's definitely worth getting.

I definitely don't have 4b, but would trading 200m to an alt be smart? Like even if you do get hacked, you still have 200m to build with?

Yep. Completely agree. Which is exactly why instead of hiring more artists, a company should hire more capable coders to fix their spaghetti! And kick the people bashing customers and employees and actually get people who are doing their job instead.

My point is based on the fact that it seems like good business practice to hear criticism when working on a forward moving project to be at least more transparent about these topics. Preferably more than transparent and actually actionable.

A delay would be good, but why not have a requirement to enter an authenticator code to confirm authenticator deletion?

I wish there was a way to find them. I mean this is literal cybercrime, no sugar to coat that. Anything we put work into has value so he's robbing someone of thousands of dollars of work.

And to add onto your comment about it taking a huge time investment, for perspective the original HD update to RS was not solely done on Jagex's part. As they brought in a 3rd party to assist with it as the whole update in and of itself was so massive that Jagex if they attempted to do it by themselves, it would have most likely not have come out or taken way longer than it did with the help of a 3rd party.

How much faster does Runecrafting get at lvl 77? I’m currently doing Lava Runes, with my tele to bank being my fishing cape so I’m a bit slower @ 36-39k xp/hr. Halfway to lvl 73 after being at lvl 70 on Friday

Nah he's still kicking around in the community. A few months back there was a whole shit show between him and his girlfriend on a stream of his. People said it was staged yada yada yada. No idea if it was or not, don't care really if it was. Then someone recently posted on the sub that A Friend was going to start posting videos again.

He's died on 3 or so HCIM by now. He even attempted to start an area locked account, because he wanted to hop on that bandwagon. No idea what came of the account.

Its faux though they wont ban him or make an example of him(even if his tone wasnt proper), or do we forget jagex changed konars original drop table soley on his twitter bitching? Fuck faux, fuck streamer/influencer favoritism and fuck you for supporting him

Nah, but they should make it a 6x6 double set in a QOL update or at least give it a wicked handrail
---
I can’t say there is a way to reliably get them.. some days I get lucky and some days I go the whole day without a task, I started the grind at 9k points and went to under 100 till I hit a 3k tasks boost.. and even those are slowly fading away.

Watched a tutorial on youtube, jad for idiots. Did it the first try, only used 3 brews and lots of rest left. Had guthans and sgs.

The 07 Scape Reddit community is insanely toxic.

it was a bot. no human mines runite.

---
Not replying would have everyone here flaming it anyway with "Mods won't reply to this" and shit about them hiding from the problem. She tried to help, and believed someone may have not been aware. This fault is entirely on the baiter's for trying to get anything to go "look, jagex bad!"

I love this idea, yes please!!!

At least it’s at the end of a line so you can just shop it in

You don't need super antifire and it's probably just an alt. I do bbd on my main when I play on my iron just because it's afk as fuck.
---
It was used as an example to explain something she already said that the tweeter ignored with extremely poor logic.
---
"Do you expect the person who cleans the office to check the balance sheets each week?" Its simply comparing positions and saying people have different roles.
---
No where did she belittle a position, so no it wasn't pretentious to use an example to further explain something to baiting tweets.
---
Looks a lot like the favour system in Menaphos on RS3 and the favour system on Zeah. I hate both with a passion.
---
You're welcome!
---
i'd be perfectly happy with dumb cunts that let themselves get phished having no way of getting their account back.
---
And people are shitting on game developers because of some niche security feature that people with poor overall security claim will be the saving holy grail for account hacking.
---
Thats not their role, yet people are boiling it down to being their fault despite them having nothing to do with it.
---
So no i don't think explaining why thats unfair with a comparison thats easier to understand, like "people cleaning the toilets" is rude or a poor choice of words.

This is all of Canada too sadly

That p mod was an absolute ass and never should have been a p mod to begin with. 
---
As a p mod, he also had ways to contact Jagex that the average player doesn’t, and he should have used those rather than attempting to publicly flame jagex like he did. His behavior was neither becoming of a respectful player nor a P mod
---
Can ya'll stop baiting developers into saying non-rude things that you then jump on as if she was racist or something? She used an example, thats all. To explain to brainlets trying to bait her, while also insulting her and saying she should fix problems that aren't her job.
---
Did she sub-tweet that at a jagex janitor and say "go on poop cleaner boy, fix the authenticator". Because thats seriously how you're acting.
---
You think Jagex is really going to do anything if RL maintainers decided to go rogue? Their stance is already to use RL at your own risk.

You have all these lines of communication yet your word doesn't matter, none of ours does. Do you really think that your little line of communication will get anything actually worthwhile fixed?You can have all the little meetings you want at the end of the day you're a glorified player with little to no power.
---
If your meetings meant anything at all we wouldn't even be having this discussion because Jagex would be doing the right thing, which they've failed to do for YEARS. Thanks could've did it the right way and it all would've just been swept under the rug because that's all Jagex knows how to do when it comes to serious issues. Its not like this is the first uproar about security and nothing has been done.
---
please don't spread disparaging info about players who are just better at the game than you are. ehp is not hard or that unrealistic to maintain.

&gt;Its not the players fault that everyone who gets 1b+ bank has to legit ask themselves

Humans will *always* be the weakest link in a security system. But that isn't an excuse to not have a better one. Even a three day time limit to remove an auth would be a huge step in the right direction.

You're telling me you never sat around 1 computer with your mates playing the same game?

Daily grinding is a great idea? I don't mean to be rude but people have on numerous occasions said they *don't* want a bunch of daily tasks. 
---
If the rewards from this are useful it will be an annoying grind that people don't want to do, and if the rewards are bad it will just be an annoyance for completionists.
---
Zeah favor is not considered good content, RS3's menaphos/sophanem similar sucks, and a ton of people complain about WoW nowadays because it's increasingly just a bunch of monotonous daily task grindings.

It looks flashy and maybe on paper is interesting, but I don't think anyone would actually enjoy this content.

That's actually nutty. Does mage do half damage to Corp?

I kind of see both sides of it. RuneScape is a grindy game no matter how you look at it. Can you play casually and still enjoy yourself? Absolutely. But if you want to seriously pursue any end game content, such as bossing, raids, achievement diaries, etc., you’re going to reach a point where you’re playing for hours and hours grinding out a single level. And that kind of play time eventually adds up to hundreds or even thousands of hours that could have been put towards something else.
---
Although I consider myself to be a relatively casual player (110 cb 1800 total), it’s still taken me years of playing on and off to reach this point. And while runescape doesn’t negatively impact my work or social life, I do find myself wondering “what if” I had put those hours towards a hobby, like learning a musical instrument, or towards a real-life skill that could help further my career.
---
Runescape is pretty addicting but it’s all about finding the balance between it and the rest of your life.
---
I think I saw you at ankous today.  The time checks out.
---
Ah good there’s two of them
---
My account uses authenticator, the login email has 2FA, the recovery email for that email has 2FA. Kind of dumb that I have all this security in place but in the unlikely event someone gets a hold of my password they can circumvent all that security just by disabling the authenticator from the RS website. Just requiring that a verification email be sent to disable the authenticator would stop any hack attempt right away. Google requires a pin sent over SMS for any device not registered and requires another pin be sent to disable 2FA. But nope! If someone knows my password to my RS account they get to hop on right away after disabling the authenticator.
---
Very unmodly of him
---
Your at the karamja dock?

I'd like to invest in this pasta please.
---
I took out two pots from bank and thought they were different pots just same colour until i realised they were both absorption
---
Toodles! 
---
1. Most casuals don’t have a 20 character password so having a 12 char password in only alpha numerics really will screw them over
---
2. It’s just bad practice, I had to make a shitter password than I’m normally used to to play rs ...
---
3. It’s not a big project at all, you put a 1 big flag in the DB to distinguish the type, a monkey with a typewriter (or you with guidance) could do it in an afternoon ... and you force people to upgrade to the new system on login 
---
4. And yeah the 2FA problem is dumb but I don’t see anyone defending it like the password stuff, Jagex need to just upgrade their systems as a whole so we got an old school game with proper support systems
---
From someone who trains the people who works on the things ... and has implemented the thing before, granted not in an archaic language that Jagex are working with, but whatever.com

Because ever since the 1 hour death update they literally risk nothing in the rest of this EZscape game, and so dying for items is actually offensive to them.

But wait, someone's going to call me out for how you can lose a whopping 100K while using 300M in gear to kill a boss that drops on average 100K per kill.

First you'll want to try it to see if it even works, you don't want to pay for a month and then have it be useless. You shouldn't go with a free one either though because they're most likely selling your data.
---
So ideally you want a paid VPN that also offers a trial period, or money back after a time.
---
If I recall, NordVpn and private internet access are reputable, but I'm not sure they offer trials.
---
There's also a subreddit with VPN recommendations, I think its /r/VPN or something like that.
---
Has anyone done any mobile gaming before? Every single mobile game I’ve played is a money grab. All these new age games are pay to play/pay to win. RuneScape isn’t anywhere close to that. And people complain about 11$. There are money makers that will make you a bond within an hour or two and you can literally pay with in game currency. I paid for 2 months of memebership and haven’t looked back. That’s 22$ spend in 60 days. I know mobile games that charge $20 for 1 skin and $10 to buy a character.  
---
People need to to take some things upon themselves if their really worried about their own account security though. Secure their email, set up a bank pin, set up authenticator, get educated on scams and phishing. This game didn’t get released yesterday these things have gone on for 10+ years. I’m not taking jagexs side, things do need to be improved, but there’s a lot of adult who’s play this game and should be able to realize they need to take their own I initiative toward their accounts safety and not rely on jagex to hold their hand.
---
In future just wear dhide or even nothing at all.
---
I'm sure of it, if I were to come back it would probably be to pk or something along those lines, you know a bond every now and then
---
&gt;Long passwords are the only thing that matters.
---
Length is important, but it's far from the only thing that matters. Only having 36 characters available is an absolute joke compared to the 94 typically available.
---
No problem!

/r/piracy also has some internet security resources

I've played the game since actual 07 and quit in 2012 when EoC was released, I was still a noob having fun after 5 years of playing, then OSRS came out! But I couldn't enjoy it the same way I enjoyed pre-EoC, and I wanted an achievement for the amount of time spent on the game y'know? Now I got something to show for all the time put into the game! Also I can do all the content in the game now and THAT feels good 8)
---
I bet the mods are tired as fuck of getting called out when 95% of “hacks” are you sold your account and tried to recover it/you clicked a double xp boaty quitting stream/you bought an inferno or firecape.  Stop asking for authenticator removal delay for RuneScape if you don’t even have a PIN or two-step authenticator on your own email address.
---
Osrs deviated significantly from the path rs2 went on, and Zezima was number 1 before 2007 when osrs' first version takes place. They're very different games.

---
&gt;We know that elements of the community hold strong views regarding account security and recovery, including concerns involving an ‘authenticator delay’. Please be assured we are not ignoring this – these issues will be discussed in the next blog. 
---
Basically: not yet.
---
The Jagex attitude in the past has been that authenticator delay doesn't solve much if you've been phished, because if your info has been leaked to the extent that it can phish your runescape account, you probably have way bigger issues to deal with than runescape. One could argue that if a player has issues like that to deal with, it is a point in favour of adding an authenticator delay because it allows them more time to deal with the important things without worrying about their runescape account, since it would be protected by the auth delay.
---
The reason Jagex doesn't want to add a delay is because if a genuine returning player wants to access their account but lacks access to the authenticator (maybe they lost their phone or something) then that returning player won't be able to play the game immediately, and therefore is much less likely to maintain their urge to stay and pay for more membership.

Pet hunt, PK, make alt accounts (IM/HCIM/UIM/PK accounts), hunt mutagens, finish quest/diary/music/raids/champion capes, go for 200m in one or more skills, tons of stuff to do still :P
---
Working on maxing my main rn, got a ton of stuff planned out for post max (Zuk/Olmlet/Dust hunt, mutagen hunts, quest cape, diary cape, etc.)
---
The flower and herb patch are both protected in the hosidius town.
---
Wc lvls?
---
Not sure how untradeables work in instances but in most deaths it will stay in your inventory, minus stuff like Zulrah or Vorkath where you only keep 3 items and rest goes into chest.
---
Yes. That along with Trollweis and Trollheim are the only protected herb patches.
---
I mean basic sites probably have better security. And runescape security is actually very important as people invest 1000s of hours into this game.
---
Well kinda newly it was added in the clue expansion before last expansion along with 3rd age axe.
---
You know you could just drop trade (or place it on the table of a POH) to cash in on the pick.
---
You actually only need to get a hit in, an NCP can still finish them off. As long as you registered a hit the drop is yours.
---
Maxing an account before quest and diary cape wtf?
---
Thanks for letting me know it happens to both genders. That implies there are only 2 in 2019 mmm 🤔

It also didn't have anywhere near as serious a competitive scene. Zezima was impressive because he was a trailblazer, in terms of sheer ludicrous grinding the modern scene in both games leaves him in the dust.

Kieran isnt the only overweight dude working on osrs is ash there for free snacks too?
---
And how big is the tank?
---
What is this post?
---
How do you know the tank isn't 2.25 barrels big?
---
I did, just checked and that is the top hit on google and the one that is purple. I am just gonna chalk it up as a freak occurrence and now with a new pass and an auth I will have to earn my gp honestly.

Jagex how did you know about my other online alias, "inject smack"???

yeah this thing doesnt drop the claw

No way to speak about mod ash

Scim, claws, dwh as standard. Just delay your dwh spec to be 1 tick after a main hits to mitigate your accuracy here.

Fair enough. There are clan chats available for that.

Which thanks knows full well and yet still chose to blame the j mods
---
The core issue still exists, people are unhappy about the poor customer support they get, they are unhappy about the way customer support representatives interact with people. You have untrained staff, and your system is quite flawed. Some time ago, there was an AMA with Cassia Curran where she insisted that she'll look into the matter and improve customer support. It seems that she did try but the changes were insignificant as they fail to address the core issue, lack of sufficient one on one interaction, lack of satisfactory responses from staff, and the amount of false bans. For example, one of my noob alt account got banned for absolutely nothing and the person who handled my ban appeal, Mod Noodles, failed to give me a proper reason and turned down my appeal. Now my account is permanently banned. It is ironic as much as it is sad, because I am one of those players that keep reporting bots and keeps sending tipoffs to Jagex. I've lost faith in the customer support, and I haven't seen any improvements so far to change my mind otherwise.
---
I know you are sent to firefight but this issue has been going on for so long that people are not willing to listen to anything that you say until you address the issue of bad support.

Elite void for learning raids, eventually you will need fighter torso which is easy to get and free. You also need tentacle whip, staff of the swamp, and blowpipe. Spend your money on those if you don't have already. If you have those, you can start raiding now with learner groups.
---
Jamflex bad
---
Swamp man good
---
there are gear upgrade order lists on the we do raids discord
---
with full void you should be ok for raids 1. imbue your salve amulet. grab a dragon pickaxe, heavy ballista, and dragon sword at minimum for that. youll also need a tentacle whip, blowpipe, and toxic trident
---
"to which you agreed to"
---
Really?
---
Uncomfortably accurate
---
Been doing this since around 2005
---
didnt you hear? u cant get hacked on osrs, the security system is flawless
---
Genuine question: do you not have a computer or something? Or are you just limiting yourself for the challenge like swamp boy? I tried mobile and it's not really my thing if I'm being honest. But you do you :)
---
I was late to the party lol. Might make a yellow text black background suggestion sometime soon, unless someone else wants to, in which case feel free.
---
I’ve been telling my irl friend to stop using his videos. Written guides are so much better and gets straight to the point. 
---
I personally use RuneHQ.
---
&gt;You will feel much happier about maxing or playing osrs.
---
Lol not everyone wants to be happy
---
exactly. It does affect gaming experience depends how you look at it.
---
Grats!
---
I appreciate that but they didn’t release legacy mode until a while after. Had it been I introduced on release a lot of players might have stayed.
---
Any recommendations for AFK crafting while I'm at work? I'm currently level 63 aiming for 70 for MM2. AFK prioritizes over efficiency /gp.

Oh cool I found the one other person who unlocked that. Now if I'd just remember to start picking up bones

Man's literally married lmao
---
My thoughts exactly, cost me 26m alone just to get to 83 construction
---
Try 'recovering' your account, and add notes to explain what has happened.
---
I find video guides are for when I don't want to think at all and just want to follow somebody else's steps. Quick guides if I actually want to focus on questing.
---
Wildy slayer is still longer than just point boosting with turael, or just skipping with turael in general.

Is there any feasible way for me to kill Ancient Wyverns? I love them for some reason and have gotten a few lucky drops from them and want to keep killing them. I'm 99 range and mid 80's melee stats. 83 slayer.
---
The pipes are described in barrels/hour. Then the final question asks about a tank, which is different than a barrel, without giving any info on the size of the tank.
---
Which makes it shitty, who the fuck is paying 800m for a cosmetic DPick?
---
You can just put the video guides on 1.25x or 1.5x speed. For tougher quests that need safespotting or are difficult enough that you need to see the process in-action, video guides are better there too. Really no downsides I can see.
---
Gotcha. Never even noticed. Probably just a typo that's overlooked.
---
The photo was taken in the 60s.
---
Yes I know that and they can't fix that part of the code so I would just give a point for each slot it fills out.
---
The rate of the pipes is how fast they can fill a **barrel**. They're asking how long to fill a **tank**
---
A smaller versoin of sarachnis looks pretty dope tho
---
Yeah someone else pointed it out. I overlooked that, and I'm sure that the devs did too. Just a typo
---
No, she said cleans the toilet. I was using a different example to illustrate the same point her example made.
---
The Office
---
Lol that face
---
Its OP
---
She didn't call them a toilet cleaner. Check again. She asked whether the "people who clean the toilets" are expected to make changes to account security to show the fault in the tweeters horrible logic and bait.
---
I did it with a kitten. Seriously put something on youtube, make a smoke and it really aint that bad.
---
It's a pretty common guideline everywhere in the world..  
---
You don't get hired then walk around going "This place is so shit, my bosses are twats" to every customer you see...
---
What's double worse is hes also using internet ex.. I mean Microsoft edge.
---
I can't believe there's so many people with near maxed accounts that get hacked. If you have a secure password, use an authenticator and don't put your info into stupid places like a 3rd party client then you will not get hacked. The lack of auth delay is a weakness but isn't enough for anyone to lose a properly secured account.
---
When would that limit come into effect though?
---
That's not an unpopular opinion. Wiki quick guides are miles better
---
And he would be fired for doing so. Which is again, the point
---
Time to neuter this cat
---
You replied to people, i replied to people. Sorry that you happened to be the one spreading the most idiocy.
---
She never even referred to janitors... she used an example of a job role to illustrate the point that a game dev isnt in charge of security. She was trying to help a brainlet tweeting her with bait, instead of just ignoring the idiot.
---
I'm not some sort of shill, you're some sort of e-troll or something. Latching onto weak excuses for a point and thinking you're standing up for the little guy or something. Are you a janitor? Did it personally offend you that she used part of your job role to illustrate how you aren't expected to do another job entirely?
---
And thats why we are supposed to stand up for him now, because what he did was good.
---
That’s the most pedantic reply I’ve ever seen. You’re really hurting your already awful argument here.
---
This isn't an opinion, it's a fact lol. Any video guide will be slower than a quick wiki guide. I tried Slayermusiq once to see why people were hyping it up and he explained literally every detail of an easy tier quest. It's good for noobs, bad/slow for more experienced players.
---
Was me lol, i was like what now and then i quited lol
---
i mean after 10+ years of data and statistics there has to be some sort of giveaway. 
---
in the end, it is not possible to play 100% like a normal player. maybe you get as close as to 99% but it will never be the same.
---
Are you unable to replant as you harvest with this method?
---
I wondered for YEARS how people could make time for OSRS and progress so much in a year, turns out those who make time for OSRS are serving time too..
---
My world has opened! Thanks for the laughs and solving one of my life mysteries!
---
Isnt anything you want to achieve an accomplishment? Like if I want a bronze dagger and I get one, boom. Achievement. Sorry my untrimmed HP cape forsnt live up to your standards of what an accomplishment is haha
---
I don't see how someone else screwing up justifies this pmods behavior?
---
How do you get your spellbook like that bro????!!!! This is game changing.. Lol
---
TLDR on the situation someone??
---
they do use their melee attack and will quickly wreck any account that stands in front of them...
---
I feel this
---
Lmao which subgroup did that?
---
Where did I disagree with what he was saying?
---
Haha! Apparently you cant get banned for being a cunt so doing this was the next best thing
---
Welcome to RuneScape &lt;3 ... yeah osrs has a big bot problem but i believe Jagex are doing their best because they remove a couple of thousands bots every single day ( you can find on the news page what the exact numbers are ) and since you're only 2 months a part of our family hold on tight, there are so many things broken / flawed ... to me this is one of the best games ever, thousands and thousands of hours of fun, adventuring, making friends ... just remember this on your travel adventurer, if it sounds to good to be true, it is, so many dickholes ... but way more amazing people &lt;3
---
Answer is 11
---
All games eventually lead to this unless the devs put in stupid hard or long challenges where they were never intended to be completed.

Mysteries of life can not be explained to a human mind without the capability to comprehend such information.

Congrats you beat my 16 kill count vorki. I'm over 500 kill count now trying to strengthen the bank

I just said I don't? What a stupid comment.

My pets are roaming around together in my poh garden. Guess that's better than storing them in the bank for eternity... Like all my old pokemon.

You can lock the screen :) but it was posted as a joke :)

It's lame they can't even alert you through email that someone else is trying to recover or get in your account. I've gotten an alert from my Guild Wars email that someone halfway of the entire planet in the Netherlands someone was trying to recover my account. Haven't touched that in almost 8 years and the game came out in 2005.

I only use slayermusiq for like mm2 and ds2. Wiki is more convenient for 85% of the quests in the game.

This comment sums it up perfectly

&gt;Wow. That was devastating. All those hours spent on the game-- wasted.

&gt;Just like all those hours and money you spent on him.
---
&gt;Fair.
---
&gt;I hope he cries for a month.
---
Don't have to be perfect, just have to stay few weeks without being detected, or suicide your acc, or just bot sometimes and different things. You can be 100% safe if you want to, don't bot every day and be smart. Sometimes I do some skill 3 weeks a row few hours here and there. Do that with bot which takes some breaks and isn't max efficient, you can't tell which one is me and which one is bot
---
a bot will never completely resemble a human player. never. there have to be clear giveaways and jagex should have collected enough data in the past 10 years to distinguish normal players from bots. its a joke that bots can straight up rush to zulrah, kill zulrah for 15m+ magic exp and still stay undetected. 
---
combatting bots in a game with a player-driven economy is a must. it would otherwise invalidate the effort you put in.
---
Petition to let me eat Mr. Mordauts ass

Yeah I guess it makes sense. Don’t wanna be doing RC for any longer than I have to.

It's not awful. Lavas are fast. Runecrafting is just a garbage skill, but it's one of the best money making skills at the same time.

Trying for 99 prayer? Gotta train RC for that sweet, sweet gp.

What does it mean that the name I want is supposedly "taken", but when I look it up on the hiscores it says the player doesn't exist? Banned account?

it's a joke
---
There are Nintendogs and Pokémon that will never see their beloved owners again, decaying day by day in a plastic cartridge. What once was their home is now their prison.

Lol alright. It's always been my dream to get 99 mining, so I'm gonna bot it. What an accomplishment.

I cant tell whats more sad. The fact she put up with this so long. Or the fact the guy was getting a free ride and being spoiled and was dumb enough to fuck it up.

I really like this. For some reason, I genuinely just do not like more “late game” content in OSRS. It’s not that it’s bad, I just don’t personally like how the experience feels. I love mid level content like this, where you can play a little suboptimally and do a bunch of stuff at once and just have fun and adventure. That’s the “old school spirit” that I love and miss.

---
Quick guides only work if you’ve done the quest once or twice because it says “talk to ___” without clues or sayin where that certain npc is etc
---
I'm sorry, but this comment makes it all the more obvious that you're unfamiliar with bots and how they work.
---
[From April 29th - May 5th Jagex banned over 175,000 botting accounts.](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360001564458-29th-April-5th-May-Player-Support-Stats)
---
That's from one week alone. Jagex does combat the problem pretty aggressively, but they don't make a big show of it, and because you don't see it so you assume that no resources are being put into it. That simply isn't true. Jagex literally bans hundreds of thousands of bots a week. 
---
The few that you see constantly are those that either slip under the Radar, or have already been tagged and are going to be banned in the next wave.
---
Its a good staff if you wanna manual cast spells. That staff cannot auto-cast ancient magics so it sucks for bursting but is good for PVP where you dont mind manually casting the spells.
---
You can use it to autocast normal spells but those are not used outside of PvP tbh.
---
Next up, mage training arena!
---
Yes!
---
Wiki is only better if you've done the quest before. GL doing Darkness of Hallowale with the wiki

Fighter Torso is kinda overrated. The argument is that it has the best DPS and DPS is king. Void Melee has better DPS; a higher max hit than anything short of the perfect Strength set as well as an Accuracy boost which effectively makes it the best DPS set. "But Torso has better Defense". Yeah and Granite Platebody has a higher Defense than Torso. So where would you draw the line between Defense being important and DPS being important?
---
You can argue Torso is the best for Slayer as Void doesn't give you any benefits with the head slot taken and a Strength set is superior with Slayer Helmet; but I'd take a better Defense over such a minor improvement in damage any day. Just wear Guthans (which the body gives about double the Defense a Fighter Torso does) for passive heals with a Slayer Helmet and Whip/Defender switch for DPS.
---
My point is that in most situations an alternative to Fighter Torso can be just as valid if not potentially better than anything the Fighter Torso can bring to the table. It kinda irks me that anything that isn't the Efficiencyscaper's ideal setup is labeled as being nothing more than "Cute Noobs" these days. Just let people wear what they want. This guy is just fine rocking that Granite Platebody for now; put your priorities elsewhere.
---
Happy cake day
---
Great melee XP and decent cash and decently afk, unless you're maxed melee I don't see why you would block them.
---
I didn't mean to insinuate that you yourself are doing it, but half these replies are. I don't see how Orion is in the wrong for telling off a troll, but I still especially don't see what 'Thanks' did wrong.

&gt;Honestly seeing that reaction, I have literally 0 respect for Orion now, and honestly the "mature" act that most of the Jmods put out. How pathetic.

jesus lad gz on pet, how much sigils you get along the way?

Will do! The one that springs to mind, and I might be wrong in assuming it's not required, the waterfall quest quick guide has a step like
---
&gt; Left-click Read Book on Baxtorian and close the book again, or the key won't be in the box.
---
It's been some time since I've done the quest so I was very confused about the key part, wondering if there was something I was supposed to do but it was in reference to a key later in the quest. It might just be that I read too much into it though.
---
Man im on 9k kc no pet

“Free miney” more like free hiney 😏😏

yeah i can appreciate that as well but from their standpoint it was about pure progression from old to new combat system

He actually has lore in RS3
---
He was created by infusing a Fairy Dragon egg with an egg from a Queen Black Dragon
---
He was considered a failure because he didnt want to hurt or kill anyone, also he cannot breath fire. Because of this he just wanted too learn and teach.

He also does not eat any meat, he only eat cheese and cheese based products.

Is when all thats posted everyday is people getting 1 on their first chest or 4 in 1 chest, literally just after some tank legs.

No idea what being annoyed at crap loot rates has to do with being an ironman either
---
I wonder if he was able to RWT all of it before getting banned. Imagine only selling a bill or two and losing ur acc for it
---
wth, i cant enter pin using runelite, only pw. only one?

its almost like this game has designed around trading with other people or something.

example? i havnt found a single one and i recently got quest cape on my btw

interesting inputs, but some issues. I did the test a few more times since (didn't make a post since the original one didnt get much traction.) But I've never seen less than 15 teleports, and sometimes the number goes as high as 20. I didn't factor in the cost of emblems because while killing your target you can BOTH upgrade your emblem and get new ones, in fact now that you mention it you are correct I need to factor those in. But on the other side, because in 9 upgrade kills id imagine they get atleast 2 new emblems meaning another 170k needs to be added per 9 kills. Plus the stated number was done with alcheables, I only did the first calculation so that a min/max could be factored in. The time of day doesnt matter either, because the bots are all the same level, and they auto skip if they get anyone as a target that isnt in their list. Considering the levels of the bots the chances of getting a actual player as a target is minimal as well.
---
Haha where is this lore from. Its great
---
What did you lose my dude?

You walk away with nothing if you get hacked, it's not that odd. Jagex doesn't care for shit

Not sure if still the case but most of them are locked.

---
It's a real scam.

banning without warning is the JAGEX M.O. because it requires LESS EFFORT

Less effort is good from a business perspective cause it means you don't need to employ as many costly humans which are going to take away from the share holders profit margins.

It doesn't matter how good the lock is when people leave their key out in the open.

Because a game is fun, but doesn't really compare to like 5 thousand+ dollars irl when you're a working adult struggling to pay for things. 
---
We all look down upon people who RWT but i think a lot of us if we had that type on in game wealth would do it depending on circumstances.
---
And the KBD lever? That's actually surprising considering how much that is used as a tactic to get away from pkers (and a legitimate tactic imo)
---
Don't be that dude..

There was a shot of a boot (or whatever shoe that is) in the latest episode of AoT that looked shockingly similar (the exact same angle and everything) to a shot Settled had in his latest Swampletics episode that came a couple of days earlier where he said what the subtitles say
---
Definitely agree with incentivizing CW across all worlds. There's no reason we should have dead content with the size of our player base. Hopefully we can see changes in line with lms
---
There are ways. They can detect AHK already. It’s mostly secret so the bots don’t catch on. But clicking hyper-accurately (down to the pixel) and typing faster than the human hand, etc. are some of the signs a non-human is playing.
---
This happened back before 2007 as well. It made sense considering all you had to do was open a browser.
---
can you explain this?
---
oof, his other account 'Ros' got banned too now.
---
riceroni, i wonder what happened..
---
This dude mad annoying
---
I actually prefer Imsikovit's video guides better, majority of them are RS3 but they translate pretty well and he's actually done some OSRS ones now as well, very blunt and straight to the point and easy to follow.
---
Lol. I actually have some ideas to revamp combat without going the way of eoc
---
EOC update. not like rs3, but just assign things to hotkeys. Special, food, spells, prayers. things like that. Not changing anything about the game play, just how it flows.
---
My junk email box is full of these. Never click the links in the email.
---
Yes, they either buy it with bonds or get money from their main or friends or something.
---
Either bonds or they buy gp from gold sellers etc.
---
No other distractions lmao
---
Why does Jagex also ban his second account ''Ros'' because he tweeted he'll be playing from that account? KempQ also got banned for RWT, but all his other accs remained untouched (his ironmemes etc, and he plays a new regular account now too).
---
I've been doing blast furnace for the past few days and one thing I noticed is if you click on the thing with ice gloves, but don't collect, then switch to gold gloves, you can collect. I haven't seen it just work without switching to ice gloves at all, though. Maybe you already had an inventory in the collection thing, and was just collecting the gold you put in before that run?
---
(Or it is a genuine bug :P )
---
Phishing level?
---
Wouldn’t it be considered stealing if she sold the gold and kept the money?
---
i understand the perm for his main but since when did rwt become a ip ban?
---
he's right you know?
---
Both first and second time getting a QC i used wiki. But i think videos is better for new players.
---
I put slayermusiq’s videos at .75 speed and almost never have to pause his videos.
---
Yea I bet it’s even better now tho using a shitty android and having osrs installed. Shitt that would make doing 5 years easyyy just skilling 24/7
---
Like, between when the update is supposed to occur and when you can login again? Just a few minutes.
---
Hey that's just like my mom
---
How embarrassing for a high ranking member of Oblivion do such a thing. It's like seeing KempQ 2.0 with the additional thing of getting his alt banned by mentioning it on his tweet LUL. 
---
[All the pets he has on the account, gone to waste](https://imgur.com/a/zzqCOId)
---
I could get down with hotkeys. Most major MMOs use them, and we already have fkey binds for menu swaps. Attack styles granting more significant bonuses could raise the skill ceiling especially if you can swap via hotkeys
---
@a.runescape is the legit email for runescape account support. That said, this email is a scam because Jagex \[doesn't send you emails to cancel an email change according to Mod Weath\]([https://twitter.com/JagexWeath/status/1126166864034447361](https://twitter.com/JagexWeath/status/1126166864034447361)). 
---
When Jagex sends you account support emails, they will always include your RSN in the email. If it doesn't, it's a scam.
---
I play maybe a couple hours maybe a day or two every bond period, and am always able to upkeep the bond without directly trying to. At the stage I’m in in this game I’m only doing XoC and other profitable content so it kinda works out.
---
hahahaha store it in 1 of the 10 coin coffers in the game ahahahah
---
It allows perfect knowledge of steps and the numbers you need to hit for every conversation.
---
Hi, did you end up using this?
---
I'm also bored of counting to 3 so i was wondering if you found anything about this?
---
BTW LUCK
---
sounds like a good excuse to cover up the fact you broke the rules, then again most the game rwt's
---
Out of all rules I can’t demonize RWT. If I had 20Bil there’s no question I would take a quick $18,000. That’s life changing money if you know what to do with it and runescape is RuneScape
---
:(
---
I’ve fucked up on Jad a few times, he isn’t hard imo despite saying that.
---
The slog to get to him make it really unejoyable and the healers are literally the only thing that makes it difficult for new players and my own nerves get in my way if I’m honest.
---
No. Diary passives in general do not require you to be wearing the item. There are some exceptions, namely varrock armor for the double mining but generally no
---
Fact.
---
that's a bit demotivating. But I guess quests and diaries are much more rewording, cause you can't buy it, but it still sucks.
---
 I'm just fking jealous ;D
---
Bitch sent this little fuckin manchild to the shadow realm. What kind of a pissbaby lives off of their long-distance girlfriend then gets pissed when she suggests he gets a job so he can do something other than beat his dick and play runescape all day? Then he fuckin decided to cheat on her lmfao.
---
I love how she ended it by getting his defense to 6, I always joke to my friend that if he pisses me off I'll hack his skiller and punch chickens in lumbridge for 10 minutes, this girl actually did it.
---
This manchild deserved every little bit of what befell him and I hope it gets worse.
---
Sure if you needs a guide for cooks assistant after that many times its like wtf. But I'd love to see you go and do rfd and all the quest req without a guide....oh wait you can't.
---
Ignore list kiddo. Look into it.
---
BFRocket is an ironman streamer that had 3 t bows, he went to zulrah off stream with 3 t bows just to "flex" and he got 'hacked' while he had all 3 in his inventory.
---
This content feels very oldschool, i like it.
---
The only thing i find a bit weird is the random human NPC standing there.
---
Streamer 'Hard Rocket' had got his third tbow, then got "hacked" for them all. people think he rwt'd them
---
I mean some of them probably have mains too.
---
Seriously. Any time I use a wiki guide I have to end up googling where someone is located if the guide says "Speak to X". For someone questing for the first time, it's really helpful to have videos that show where you need to go.
---
I totally get it if you're just using a quick guide to remind you how to do a quest, but for quests people have never done before it can be a challenge.
---
Could you safely RWT by staking but intentionally throwing the stake? Like "accidently" bringing a worse weapon for letting the opponenet get free hits in?
---
Nah he talked and said “oh I thought you didn’t have any ammo”
---
She has four friends, Katya (3 years old), Gwyn and Alola (about a year old) and her sister who doesn't have a name yet :)
---
Basically wiki for easy quests, video for challenging ones
---
So that's why we aren't getting many sustained new players... they're being sucked into the black we call bots/hacks/scams.
---
Yes, ganking someone and killing them in under 10 seconds is great fun.
---
Recently finished off 70s melee stats and 75 range. Current gear is D Boots, D Legs, Rune Plate Body, Berserker Helm, Whip/D Scim, D defender, Glory, Combat Bracelet, legends cape/obby cape, and teleporting rings for melee. and God dhide with Magic shortbow (i)/rune crossbow for range. What is the best gear I should get now for general slayer fun. I'm closing in on Barrows gloves and think I should be able to handle a fire cape soon.
---
But... no...
---
The main point of using a fight torso, is it’s only a chest slot, instead of a full setup like void. I agree that void is better than the fighter torso, but it also depends on what you are doing.
---
This is exactly what it is.
---
Talk to Thurgo makes no fucking sense for someone new as well as someone who hasn’t done the quest multiple times. Let alone more complex locations and characters, complex puzzles and mazes, complex quests in general.
---
It took me 2 quest capes and years to memorize where everything is and to this day I still have to look npc’s up. A new player has ti figure out a multitude of things, where the npc is, where that area is, and how to get to that area. 
---
Or you just listen to, “tp to camelot, head north and go to the building parallel to the bank, talk to “x”.
---
This wiki anti slayer musiq circle jerk is pretty pathetic lol, yes wiki’s are better if you already know where everything is, no shit.
---
It has never taken me more than 20 minutes to do this part..
---
Get a fighter torso as well.
---
Ok good talk — don’t expect much from someone with a sexual position as their username lmao
---
He's talking about the standard spells
---
The story albeit very well written is almost certainly false. Too many things dont add up.
---
&gt;Even items I couldn't normally trade away, I used a spell to convert the items into coins which I then gave away as well.
---
Untradeables alch for basically nothing with only a few exceptions eg max cape, so this is suspicious.
---
&gt;I had four stacks of coins totalling over 8.5 billion.
---
2 of these would need to be in the GE(1 in bank, 1 in inventory), given the other detail I'm suprised the methods in which todo this were omitted.
---
&gt;The first thing I bought were 100 bonds.
---
Ok, buying them all one at a time really thats going to take 30minutes, why not just trade the cash? Seems suspicious.
---
&gt;He still had about an extra billion, so I spent it on the supplies I needed to level up an expensive skill of mine.
---
Are there any skills you can get close to spending 1b given the ge trade limits? Seems suspicious.
---
&gt;I spent a majority of his coins on extremely nice armor and weapons.
---
Majority of 8b is more than 4b, unless you start buying duplicates you cant spend 4b on armour and weapons. Seems suspicious.
---
C: I've got two chunky boys. Finn and Jake
---
It's completely possible though?
---
They are. One of my old-ass alt accounts got banned after being hijacked and now the name is back in circulation.
---
&lt;3 perfect
---
TF2 has exact same problem as OSRS, people have made bots that go around ruining games for everyone...  
---
  
---
Sadly, that doesn't help your excuse of an "argument", because TF2 at least provides tools to allow everyone to have fun in literally 10 seconds as long as everyone cooperates, so go suck a dick and shut the fuck up.
---
I came here to say that. You’re basically required to retain that 1kc now.
---
I’ve been putting all exp into agility and it’s still slow
---
Rip boaty friend 6
---
To flex on the hackers obviously
---
how doesn't it make sense from his perspective? He gets free $2k and keep his account unbanned lmao.
---
It's a good car that'll last you a decade, It's half a year's worth of food, it's two months of utilities, a few weeks of fun, and in poorer places? 
---
Five thousand dollars can get you whatever you want, if you aren't killed for it of course.
---
Lol y'all salty poor noobs
---
So I haven’t played RS since it got updated and all I know if OSRS. I used to be a member (back when it was $5) but I’m not looking to spend money now. Is this even worth playing without being a member? How gated is it these days?
---
You need a tinderbox
---
Traded with clan members, mains, skilled for it, ranged vork, bought bonds, RWT, etc. there are plenty of ways to get the cash for BIS melee DPS without maxing your combat. I think I was around CB100 when I had max melee gear. Sold it for DHCB to camp vork soon after though.
---
Eh it's being the bait that's fun. All of that loot is from baiting singles PKers into multi.
---
Thanks!
---
250iq play by the guy in Dharoks, only he’s not contributing to the game in anyway
---
I was afraid of that...
---
It might be offense based then, one of mine has been banned away since 2012 (rwt)
---
Monk tends to fast forward through most of the walking, while slayer just skips the dialog.
---
Make the tabs go green and the entry names go green as well when they're complete.
---
Made this suggestion on the Q&amp;A months ago, they were in favour but nothing was actually done. As usual.
---
Is joke
---
Damn, that’s an impressive amount of hours. Do you ever think what else could have been done with that time?
---
For example I have 3K hours in CS:GO. Sometimes I think if I had spent time earning money, even just minimum wage, ends up being 20k in money that could have been potentially earned.
---
25k hours.....that’s enough time to pay off a home
---
Bro now I'm going to feel like shit at vorkath
---
Worst fear. Did you die because you were taking the screenshot?
---
To be fair, he was streaming earlier, he had got his 3rd tbow drop as an Ironman and was doing raids earlier that day with 3 tbows to flex. I'm not saying it wasn't rwt though.
---
We do raids discord may let you leech, otherwise you could try asking around the CoX world and someone might let you leech, since you provide them extra points (and difficulty) by just being in the raid
---
You're completely wrong. There is no other game with a bot issue like OSRS.

i wonder is this is 8b rs3 gp or osrs gp.... Im thinking its rs3 lul

Not for the clue
---
Lol 9 attack levels isn't 150% in accuarcy boost
---
Bgs wins out m8 even if you were 75 attack and str. The godswords special attack has insane multipliers while dwh doesn't get anything but a damage boost
---
You still have to walk all the way around the city which takes forever. Pretty sure you have to go through the forest from the elf camp, I think the north side is only accessible from arandar
---
It was an ironman account and a lot of gear to rebuild (gear/supplies that would've been annoying to reaquire as a btw) was left on it as well. Coincidentally of course.

That’s just a skiller bro.
---
it's dead give away when he got hacked and still kept his hardcore iron man status, everyone on osrs knows what that is. they will make it sure to lose that status but 'so called hacker' didn't. so alot of ppl including assume he rwt'd and it's easy to do it that way without getting banned.

It's easy to tell when the writing flows a certain way and completely unnecessary details are included in bulk. It reads as legit, because we're used to that style of writing in our books, but it shouldn't and doesn't exist in online nonfictional recounts of events.  If you look for it, you'll notice it.
---
If you’re not watching his quest guides at x1.5 speed you’re doing it wrong

I can't even understand his accent half the fucking time.

How is that a shame, a hacker could do everything you are doing to recover someone's account and claim the same as you, power of info without the email. Don't have old email, okay sir let us just slap on a random email no problem sir.

I mean, if its something you ENJOY doing, then I would weigh that in at your own discretion. The Garg boss also has a nice pet. 
---
Personally, I would unblock wyrms (skip task), spirit creatures (skip task), kalphites (fast/KQ), and then allocate those to things that are shitty and assigned at a higher rate.
---
Everyone knows the true financial status of a man peacocking about being rich, bud. When’s the last time you had a meal? You seem cranky.
---
If you’re 100% going to use mlm a bunch, then it’s probably more efficient to unlock the top first (once you’re 72 mining). Otherwise, I’d just get the outfit, do the diary step, then sell it back.
---
I think kril and his guards are worth it and if you have *hot stuff* that would be a great task for the good obsidian drops or more pet chance at Jad

Ayiza worked for Jagex for a while so they must have had atleast ONE conversation about the issues regarding account security. Is he feigning ignorance or did Jagex literally did not talk about it at all while Ayiza worked for them months ago? 
---
Authenticator delay has been a suggestion for years, its the most low level criticism the playerbase has had for Jagex. This surely wouldn't be a tweet that someone who used to work for Jagex would say unless they literally never talked about the issue.
---
Just like factory farmed animals.

Heads up, selling gold is a common topic when talking to high end pvmers. You make so much gp raiding efficiently, and it sells so good that you can make a helpful amount of real life money by just chilling and playibg your favourite game. Helps people pay rent, tuition etc
---
Not saying its ok or anything, but its just so common. Its not even a secret, people talk openly about it in disc servers
---
It sure reads like it, like they spent time typing it into a word document and carefully edited it to make it sound perfect.
---
Is the bank a proper home?

Sorry our military was better.

I was doing a clue near my bed time. I did a clue step in the abyss, and next step was lvl 50 wildy. I went to the mage bank after i finished that step and some guy in there said i was a beast. Then i figured what he ment. I had full graceful, blowpipe(fully charged), and what he didnt see was my runepouch  and 400k~ gp in my inv.
---
That woke me up quick.
---
Also killing demons and the likes.
---
I mean 70 ranged minimum I'd say, blessed dhide and a dragon crossbow with diamond and Ruby dragon bolts (e) for the final boss  Other than that, the rest is cake goodluck
---
At least it’s still done :D
---
It’s banked, I don’t have the mage level for it.
---
Probably rs3 gold (14 year old account?), so maybe not quite worth as much.
---
Just buy an obby platebody, has like one less strength bonus than the torso. That’s what I did, cause fuck that mini game.
---
gotta hit that 10 minute mark somehow mate.
---
Yeah an hour or 2 a day should be easy to make bonds if you prioritize doing herb runs and birdhouses
---
They usually say where the NPC is the first time.
---
I don't think you can have multiple stacks of the same item. You need to convert to Plat or keep it on ge offers
---
I think you have to talk to Oziach to get those
---
If it's a quest-relevant NPC it has the map location. If it is a minor character it has the location at least written in there.
---
TOB?
---
That actually sounds cool, hope they decide to poll that back to osrs someday, I’m sure the players would vote for it
---
for the 10k upvotes this got noone acctualy gives a fuck and is willing to do anything. im completly unsubscribing. the fact that THIS is the support is pathetic
---
dumbass
---
Why would you ever do quests more than twice?

Nothing like running around in unnecessary risk to get the heart pumping. The worst part is I had this really strange feeling in my gut but I just assumed that was some random general anxiety I get... But then boom. PKd for 5 mil.

Don't fool yourself that any of those big time stakers aren't lowkey RWTing. Every once in awhile, lose a stake (read: slightly misclick/lag your own internet a bit/etc) at the ol sand casino for a few bill to the RWTer, who appears as a completely normal staker, and they send you a cash. Done properly (i.e. don't do it against the same accounts, don't do it often, don't make it obvious that you threw the fight, which isn't hard at all), it's undetectable by JaGeX. 
---
Just keep the frequency to maybe two to three times a month and you're good. Get an extra $5k through that on top of streaming and you're laughing.
---
Hire botting kingpin, make him run the shady part while detecting and banning the competition. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
He wasn't making 100k a year if you even saw his stream numbers.  He probably made more off rwt than if he streamed an entire year at his current rate.
---
Poor guy.
---
But after you enable it, can you get the mimic fight when you have the chest, or do you need to bring it somewhere to activate it?
---
Lmao I got banned long time ago because I wasn't a incel. What a pathetic dude lurking in my post history 10 month back LFMAO Hope you like it my Cities Skylines screenshots
---
First time seeing this posted for the 5th time.
---
I guess you could call living with your parents financially stable.
---
&gt;keep it on ge offers
---
bingo
---
Is it worth it on PC?
---
He had a bank pin, ofc they didn’t take anything in his bank, just on his person. 
---
Literally all you’re doing is speculating, insane how quick you are to judge without any real evidence.
---
When you're too poor for guthans and have to settle for bones to peaches :(
---
Next they will give him a #name018272628191 name and he wont be able to type without changing it.
---
As everyone else said, consider your 5th+ items disposable and it should be fine. Big tip: Turn your player attack options (Joystick button in the settings menu) to 'right click only', that'll save you some heartache from the inevitable skulltrick.
---
Alright nvm
---
Probably more like 99%
---
Can impling jars be made more available/accessible for ironmen? Maybe a Jar Generator tweak or the manual process be made easier? Currently making your own impling jars manually is completely dead content.
---
Classix wasn't making a living from streaming though, no way he could with his viewer count unless he was living with his parents still.
---
A few months ago? Yeah
---
Not to mention all the quests involved lol.
---
It was posted on a completely unrelated subreddit so it makes sense for her to be explaining things about the game.
---
Woodcutting is deforestation, Firemaking is polluting, etc
---
Very slow, a couple days ago got from 50 to 55 and the difference is noticeable, I'd say 3 times slower. 
---
But it's very click intensive so yeah
---
aww I'm sorry the ents in lord of the rings gave you nightmares hope you're well now
---
You can do tob with some pretty pleb gear.
---
oooh thanks.
---
I used those quick guides for many years now (even got qp cape on rs3 thanks to them (380+ freaking quest points!)) and there wasn't a single time where the quick guide failed me. The people who make them are the hero we need and don't deserve o&gt;.
---
Higher fishing doesn’t make it easier does it?

Rune Axe
---
Not favouritism, at worst it's just inconcistency.
---
Also watch [this](https://youtu.be/Z2Dcg5ug-Mk)  and you can see how many ppl here have phones in prison lol it’s mad
---
I watch slayer musiqs guides on 1.25 - 1.5 speed so they're perfect. But yeah if you are familiar with the quest wiki is enough.
---
Absolute minimum is priest in peril completed, what are your stats and we'll see what you might need to improve. 
---
Underground pass is really useful for Iban's blast for example
---
It's 2019 dude the rules for aggression have changed

no idea how people like this guy

"Lag" and miss a special attack or something?
---
Subtle flex I started my rs3 account December 2005 pre-eoc is my era too. You're not wrong from an objective point of view, and I admire your ability to think so objectively. You would get exactly what you want, but later on, should you decide to try any form of PVP, you would have your options to choose from. My philosophy regarding skill expansions is this: it should create new content that everyone can find benefit in. You want soul split for bandos? You get soul split for bandos? You want more depth with respect to gameplay when using prayer? Cool you get that too. Ancient curses were really cool back in rs, but it was single-flavor endgame content. Every maxed main was praying soulsplit or deflects and nothing else. This is the reason for splitting everything up.

😂😂😂😂 okay now investigate the whole clan
---
No 80%. [Here's](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Prospector_Percy%27s_Nugget_Shop) the list.
---
I got the outfit for the diary, and sold 2 pieces back for the coal bag (had some extra nuggets from mining).
---
Just the axe
---
I've had my account for over 12 years and I play OSRS. I dont get what you are trying to say. OP said they played RS3 before, and switched to OSRS as soon as it came out, transferring their wealth over. It's the same account, just 2 characters.
---
So basically, for pking its good but wb for bossing and other things in osrs, like the adventuring aspect?
---
And here i was thinking i had bad rng when i needed 4 hours for the full set.
---
The solution is to make creating an account more difficult.
---
I like my prims 😊
---
You get very slightly higher yields at high level but just start now anyway, difference is not significant really
---
pepeLaugh he doesn’t know
---
Imagine not playing his videos at x1,25-x1,5 speed so you never really catch him, no time waste
---
Your fuckin crazy
---
Unless you have 93+ defense or 90+ mage, lance sucks at solo KBD because of how hard he hits.
---
Thank god someone said it. Cant stand slayermusiq and even more so when he makes a mistake only to correct it 15 min later.
---
I mean obviously higher defence lets you wear better gear and get hit less often. That's better for bossing and general pvm. Pures exist for pking
---
&gt;They are pretty afk though, and they have the same hp as ammo crabs.
---
But they're not aggressive and are multiple tiles apart which means that if you kill an experiment in 20 seconds, you gotta click every 20 seconds. If I park myself at ammo crabs or sand crabs, I can physically leave my room for 10 minutes at a time and not have to worry about it.
---
&gt;People are just lazy as fuck
---
Literally why would the average player want to put in more effort and pay more attention to be doing essentially the same thing and reach the same end? Experiments aren't relevant anymore because they're significantly inferior to the alternative.
---
So yeah, if you define "not wanting to exert unnecessary effort when better, easier alternatives exist" as lazy, then hell yeah there's a lot of lazy people. We're not all trying to be Swampletics.
---
&gt;  and then complain when they get crashed by other lazy retards with &lt;1k total lmfao. 
---
Every community, virtal or otherwise has rules of courtesy, if you break those cultural norms, of course people are going to complain lmfao
---
Never share your password.
---
y i k e s
---
Ah, okay ty. Are main acc usually affliated with pking or do ppl create different acc for the sole purpose of pking?
---
How does splitting work in PvM? Is there some kind of mechanic that allows you to dedicate an even % of the profits to teammates, or do you just have to wait until the item gets sold, do the math, and manually trade people their share?
---
Easier ways than that. Another thing to consider is they could just play the odds, and RWT whatever the amount goes to. Start with 1b stake, if you win then stake 2b, ideally they win and then they get their 1b they wanted and pay you for it (as long as they know you're good and will keep going till they win and get their's).
---
My thoughts exactly, no one brings stamina in and what is the point of this suggestion even? If ironmen want to limit themselves then they won’t use tob chests for stamina, if they do then...who cares?
---
I want "a friend" loll
---
/r/likeus
---
But you pray melee anyways for both range and melee at kbd, unless you tbow with super antifire.
---
It was osrs
---
"Just drop your items..." 
---
Yeah, just stop right there.
---
I usually follow slayermusic1's guides at 1.5x.. i can't imagine it being too much slower than reading
---
Not certain about dogs, but once kittens can feed themselves, momma cats tell them to gtfo and the kittens naturally forget their moms scent, so it's not unheard of!
---
Calling WoW prevalent lol. Is this 2008?
---
I did not remember to do this and did the entire thing with a kitten — thankfully 2 of the spices only required one dose, but my god I spent 50-60 minutes trying to get fucking orange.
---
And the kitten turned into a hell kitten, which looked a lot like the hell rats, so I kept clicking that by accident. Feels bad.
---
Plant them in the Hosidius and trollheim patch, those are disease free. Others, do just toadflax or something low risk. The difference isn't that big
---
Rs and jre podcast is life
---
Also doesn’t she say that the account is 14 years old and then later mentions that it’s an osrs account? I’m very confused why people are believing this.
---
Fake as fuck lol
---
Best security method is to be poor.
---
Everybody should give it a try.
---
...My Runescape account that I use to play OSRS was created in 2007. You do realize that you can use accounts that are older than OSRS to play OSRS, right?
---
WHO IS MAN IS THIS
---
Good. I hope he quits. I hope he never truly recovers. Cheaters are worth less than nothing.
---
Fact of the matter is a huge portion of the high end community participate in gold buying/selling. Who cares. Game is  infested with bots and etc anyways and looking at jagex over the last few months I don't personally see that ever changing.
---
Well this isn't right.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution
---
Fake as hell.
---
your IT guys will know instantly. the question will be how much they care more than how stealthy you are around your boss.
---
So if everyone has access to staminas except ironmen and then then the ironmen decides to utilize this method, who does it hurt? The spirit of Ironman is related to how the player wants to play it. If they want to “unrestrict” themselves and abuse TOB for staminas then go for it. You’re acting like this is tarnishing your ironman status or something.
---
Atleast there’s ppl that buy bonds I guess
---
Dumb question, but how does ranging max hit work exactly?  I tried reading the wiki but it just isn’t clicking with me.  Is it more dependent on your ammo or on your weapon?  Like say I use broad bolts, would a dragon chow hit harder than rune?  Or just more accurate?
---
seed contracts.
---
“She” probably does play osrs. She also said she majored in Law in high school which is really weird because I’ve never heard of any high school offering a major.
---
How is it an "original host" if he's the #8171? I would say #0 or #1 would be original.
---
Yeah i saw that when i looked for tele

8 hours isn't even bad dude I took 4-5 per piece
---
Good idea, to the people that don't want to do daily stuff. So be it. Just bankstand then.
---
If story is 100% true, guy was a childish idiot and deserved everything he got. But it IS Reddit so it’s likely that little to none of this is actually true.
---
Yeah I got that entirely wrong there I’m sorry, but still they made the decision to not ban the accounts. I’m guessing because the Ironmen didn’t have much, if anything, to do with him rwting.
---
Dude. Just wanted to hop in and thank you, I don’t care much for this ornate stuff but that previous one, the clue hunter gear? That is just beautiful. Thanks so much for bringing this to my attention.
---
You forgot the lame ass "iron, fe, ferrous, btw" tag in the name as bait to be crashed in any mult-icombat area.
---
I feel you man, few weeks ago I got all amped up to use my dragon bones at the wildy altar, instead of withdrawing just enough coins for unnoting , I pulled out 5mil and didn’t realize.  Got jerked by a team and lost all my bones plus 5 mil, like 60% of all I have.  Big Oof.  Money-making is starting to get a bit quicker now, but still not even halfway recovered that.
---
That’s a lot different than selling gp
---
Crate and fishing potions help a ton too
---
100% worth the read: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/byvigq/boyfriend\_of\_5\_years\_cheated\_on\_me\_so\_i\_ruined/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/byvigq/boyfriend_of_5_years_cheated_on_me_so_i_ruined/) 
---
Assuming the OP wasn't exaggerating due to hysterics of the situation, he definitely deserved it.
---
No but armor 4 works as a prospector top, so extra exp applies
---
Once you hit like 70attack for a whip, there are few unlocks you receive for going further. Training attack specifically only raises your hit chance roll. If you're hitting harder, you're getting xp faster, which is why it's better to train strength primarily.
---
1) the actual rate of increase.
---
Are you ignoring the fact that I literally said this can be scaled for balance? The mechanic is adding prayer stacking. The balance is to scale the final bonus so it wouldn't be game-breaking
---
For prayer drain, again, you're not understanding the concept of changing variables to balance mechanics. These prayers, especially when stacked could cause an immense amount of prayer drain when not using prayer armor.
---
Prayer bonus affects drain rate for activated prayers. The base drain rate can be high enough so that these prayers are not game breaking when used in conjunction with Max prayer bonus.
---
first bosses I did were skotizo and gargoyles w/ 80 str 75 atk/def 80 range.
---
Ah ok, thanks man
---
Why did people do this?
---
Better than MM2?
---
I've been hacked through authenticator with no outside access to my email. I have never once been hacked outside of Runescape where it has happened twice. Account security on RS is simply flawed and the only reason it doesn't get fixed is because people like you consistently perpetuate the idea that people who got hacked "have themselves to blame".
---
I feel your pain, but try the Q&amp;A thread
---
Damn this looks awesome!!
---
Gonna snipe "Mod Jed" the second this happens
---
Do blast furnace. I went from 41 smithing to 70 in the space of a bond and made enough to make my next bond plus a decent cash stack (few mil).
---
Addy bars are like 600-700k gp/hr and about 90k smithing xp at the same time. Mith is more like 400-500 which is still really good. It means 8 hours to a bond while also skilling pretty hard.
---
They're paying engine well but the rest badly, and treating employees badly (apparently) which skews the Glassdoor reviews when you look at them.
---
But again, another developer or 10 wouldn't be able to do much because it's all heuristic approach and analysis to catch botters.
---
On a work trip in sweden, browsing osrs reddit for the laughs.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
For the helm and gloves? If you're only looking to "try" pking those aren't going to make a big enough difference. He hasn't tried it yet, wanting to wait until he has a max setup. I get that venge takes a while to get but if you dont know how to use it properly, it's not going to matter either. 
---
I should've clarified when I said leveling a zerker I meant just getting 60 attack, 40 def, 70+ str/range, dscim, smite, torso, and defender. I don't pvp myself but that's what I see as the minimum.
---
Love the style, like another poster said it feels like he’s got a mr incredible thing going on but that’s not a negative imo.
---
You don't.
---
Messaged the OP. Ill treat her way better while she supports my runescape career
---
Yeah i just read the titel
---
Yeah so far my money making isn't picking up lol. But I've made like 3.5mil on nats but losing that DFS really offset that.... Lol
---
This is to do while waiting for contracts to grow.
---
So I don't think it's true either, but devils advocate, surely someone who was making it up and creatively writing it would be more aware of getting stuff like that right than someone legitimately writing it from memory?
---
good luck on your future journey, hopefully he reads this.
---
Just think about worse dry streaks like Curtis going 15k Shaman dry for DWH. Makes your dry streak not feel so horrible.
---
Any chance you could help me afford a dhcb?
---
like the first rule of runescape is to not account share...
---
I asked a simple question asking you to compare the two things and not only did you not answer but you instead decide to be needlessly defensive with a weak ass swipe at me. 
---
Nice. 
---
Also, what’s a “perceived person?”
---
If you evaluated her actions independently of the situations and removed / swapped genders over would that still be fine with you?
---
If they do another name release Cocksmoker14 is mine
---
He livestreams himself playing on 6 account somewhat frequently, I've seen it a few times and know he's not a bot farm
---
Yeah, no, fuck that, he absolutely had it coming.
---
Yah, that's not a bot farm - that's one guy juggling accounts like a champ :D 
---
Sorry, but this is technically legit gameplay...? I think. 
---
Does Jagex have anything in their TOS about multiple accounts logged in at once? 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
---
lol this is me and im not a bot.

good luck and have fun
---
That would have been hilarious lmao. Maybe he'll train his Defense now and actually be good at the game, hmm...
---
No questions from me, just here to letting you know: well done, he deserves it
---
Just be sure to take a break once in a while before getting burned out. (In my late 20s so this might not apply to all)
---
Don't know about this specific game, but is it possible that he can claim a hacked account and get a rollback? Or are shared accounts against the TOS, so that he can't rely on help from support? Would kinda suck.
---
Thanks girl!! :D
---
I want to believe the story so badly. Is there anyway to prove it?
---
Oh same. Runs fine on mobile, lags like shit on RL unless i zoom in really far lol
---
Rune drags are only good becuase of how afk they are. Many bosses are better. Venenatis, dks, bandos, arma, Sara, revs, demonic gorillas, CoX, and ToB are all better
---
Edit: also the 2 methods you're choosing not to do (vorkath and zulrah) are much better than rune drags
---
Looks like a cluster fuck to me.
---
I always wondered how the hell Castle Wars is a F2P game when it's balls-deep in the members area. 
---
Mystery solved. 
---
Teleport. Figures. XD
---
I didn't count but I was getting like 1 mark every 3 laps ish.
---
Whoaw... There's more humans living outside of wall no one knew about .. whoopty doo. And maybe there's someone trying to control everything in the wall... Oh my gosh the plot is crazy.. how could I have missed it... 
---
The real spooky mystery of a Titan comes from your parents basement. Xdddddd g1
---
I was curious which items you bought for your main? Did you get a twisted bow? 3rd age?
---
I know what you said. I’m saying you’re wrong.
---
A noob, at that. Op didn't even know truthful details about the game smh.
---
Is stealing his osrs gp not illegal? It’s worth thousands of dollars
---
You probably switched weapons lol
---
I don't agree, but I do think the wiki guides give more information about diary and music unlocks.
---
Sure, but it's pretty hard to make account creation so difficult that it can't be automated without making it too difficult for new players to bother making one. P2p bots are a bigger problem imo because if you pay to play the game you shouldn't be seeing bots everywhere. F2p bots are a harder problem to solve while being less relevant or urgent to the main game that people pay for.
---
A lot. He sent me several pictures of his gross face slobbering and crying, which I don't know what he was trying to prove. Possibly guilt tripping me? Who knows...
---
Emblem farmer bots
---
prove you wrong about what? you didn't even say what's wrong I'm literally just doing guess work.
---
guess im supposed to read your mind. you didn't even say "X is wrong, because of Z, leading to Y" nope just "you're wrong".
---
you start off bro, I was just saying an example and you just insult me without saying what I did wrong. 
---
insane. and for that, im not even reading this shit anymore. waste of time. INSANE
---
Couple basic points:
---
The game's graphics are basically modeled after how they were when Runescape 2 launched in the early 2000s, I think it was 2001 or 2002.
---
The game's engine is proprietary which means that the graphical limitations are likely due to the fact that it was basically made by a few dudes with a very small budget and built on from that.
---
Since Jagex allegedly has historically had this hardon for using inhouse software as opposed to utilizing a third party engine like Unreal, it was likely initially a barrier that manifested itself in these graphical limitations, among other things.
---
And I suppose the rest is history.
---
Really both the same in answer to your earlier question. The person who feels more aggrieved. I made that swipe because you excuse her actions because she felt wronged and nothing more than that.
---
I mean I see his name as a euphemism for “I’m an ass, but I haven’t committed genocide and other war crimes,” but I guess I was overruled...
---
no its alowed, and its not multiboxing its multilogging
---
everyone uses alts those days
---
Buy 100 blue party hats for 2147m. That offer will never go through. Repeat for the other slots.
---
RS2 development started in 2002 and they targeted computers that were considered low end even back then. Another limitation they had was that Java didn't support GPUs until later so the rendering algorithm had to be fast enough on late 90's processors.
---
Looking after my nephews this afternoon, next time I hop on RS I'll take some screenshots
---
Nice
---
Why... :'(
---
Is it against the rules to use an alt to buy items from the ge for you, with the intent of doubling buy limits? I play with two accounts and I'm trying to buy up alchables for my main that are limited to 70/4hr
---
wc level?
---
Any normal person would just move on from the game. Did he pk at all? You said in the long post you’d do farm runs for him, did he have a higher total too like good skills? Guess he can just go for Max now that his pure is shit and he probably won’t quit
---
Oh? ... What's the difference between multiboxing and multilogging? (Honestly don't know... Never heard multiboxing before)
---
You can get 1 month free membership until the end of June if you have a Twitch Prime account.  If you don't have Twitch Prime, you can get a free trial of Amazon Prime to get a free trial of Twitch Prime, get your free month of OSRS, then cancel the Amazon and Twitch subscriptions.  
---
You can also get 1 week of free membership if you go to sign up for membership on mobile.  You will get 1 week free of members and then just cancel the subscription so you don't have to pay.

i wanna say i ended up with 4k + 2 sets of white colored graceful

Came here after reading that spectacularly well played revenge...
---
Firstly... proof?
---
Secondly,
---
Aren't you worried about repercussions? He does have nudes of you and with shared social media friends etc. He does sound like some psycho douche bag that just might revenge you back
---
then you're defense didnt go up so you're good
---
I didn’t speculate shit, I asked, I never claimed that’s what happened. 
---
He still did RWT 3 tbows, so me calling Jagex stupid because they got fucked is completely valid and that’s what I based my opinion of Jagex off of. There’s no debate to that being an obvious RWT when you look at all the details.
---
I said I wasn’t sure about the resources and I asked about the rune darts, nothing wrong with asking and it being wrong.
---
Noooo😂😂😂
---
Jagex wants to fix retention rates for new players. Start here. Perfect example of a new player who might never play again because of inaction on stopping scammers.
---
I think he was pointing out that most people would clear the orb before taking a screenshot.
---
I think it used to be about the same distance before they put the shortcut there. I always banked at fally lol.
---
OOF!  Thanks
---
Oops sorry man! My bad will tune in to ur stream sometime :)
---
Well, fingers crossed because it's annoying as hell. 
---
Might be something to do with how the mushrooms are stored server-side... Most of them are entities instead of simple objects... But I don't remember it being this bad
---
CoX or ToB.
---
CoX is solo-able, and you can easily make 5m+/h once you get decent at it (I think peak efficiency 2+2's with dps alts caps out around 9m/h?)
---
ToB is the best moneymaker in game at the moment, making in the range of 8-15m+/h depending on team size and efficiency.
---
Rune Dragons... Are something good to AFK on an alt, but not really something you should be actively doing on your main account.
---
Holy crap. Just read your entire story and you seem like an absolute catch! I cant believe some kid would play you like that for so long and I wish i could smash his face in for you for all he’s done. A majority of my childhood was spent playing this amazing game and now that I’ve just graduated college, all I can think about is finding a girl that would sit and play or at least understand my love for the game. You seem like a total 15/10 and that boy will never understand what he’s missing. If you are still on wandering the world of rs, I sure hope to meet you one day!
---
I guess if you’re looking for questions to answer, when did you originally start playing the wonderful game of osrs?
---
Assuming you guys are using rl gpu renderer?
---
Yes ? This allows more of the environment to load giving you view distance, fossil island has so many npcs and a very thicc environment which can cause some ‘lag’ or loss frames on some gpu.
---
That is why when you zoom in fully you have less of the environment loading and less frame drop.
---
Multiboxing is where one movement is done on all instances at one time. You hit w to type w, it types it into each different instance of the game. Multilogging is where each input is put into each instance on its own, meaning 5 accounts, 5 clicks for 5 actions.
---
Oh boy that's a fucking network if i've ever seen one.
---
I didn’t do that at all. I asked you to evaluate who did who worse and you decided that hurt your feelings.
---
You’re trippin, dude.
---
Mr "engine work" , basically.
---
??? Then take out a loan.
---
Abby specs.  Kurasks mostly drop herbs, while spectre's drop more seeds.
---
I would just do Slayer though, stuff like dagonoths and nechs will drop seeds as well.  With contracts seeds are much more plentiful and there shouldn't be a need to hunt them specifically.  Also mole is a good alternative for herb seeds.
---
thats literally disgusting from the "number 1 clan" this is what they dont show u (puke)
---
Ok but what about 30 in game days?
---
Fucking virgin pedophiles, fucking disgusting
---
What's wrong with liking people who aren't 18+ yet? Age is just a number, nice propaganda trick. There's nothing wrong with liking young kids.
---
Worst tournament worlds ever, no teles. Just when I wanted to learn Vorkath and Galvek fml
---
I do have decently good gear and 88str, 85atk, 85def, 99 ranged, and 88 magic. It seems as though rex sometimes spawns while I'm killing supreme and supreme sometimes spawns when I'm killing prime.
---
People would defend their flag and bring it to this wall so the alchers could watch the game while alching
---
My bad, I was thinking of the half I had taken from our joint account. I benefited from the items I bought using his gold. Thank you for pointing that out.
---
Full rigs a bit extream
---
I got lucky with my DD specs. I didn’t hit below a 35 on both specs. DD has helped my time so much.
---
Is that a runelite plugin that shows you the loaded area on the ground?
---
Awesome! Sounds like fun
---
Hmmm ok I almost have base 90s, I think you might be right on that one
---
Also bounty Hunter kill trading with an alt.
---
Can you do an update in a few years? See if this guy is the meme "40 yo virgin living in his parents basement" or if he smartens up and gets a life
---
Hmmm maybe zenyte swaps is the factor, I was using a fury.
---

Not instantly, He might have still had a day or two before he got permad, Might have been even sweeter if he bought some gold to rebuild then got permad.
---
Lmao
---
Lol you can check if his username is cheaterboi or whatever
---
Dusk &amp; Dawn is good for practicing some boss mechanics but it's pretty shit GP/hr compared to the effort you need. Still around Barrows-tier though so not too bad I guess, although I'd assume that by 75 Slayer you'd have access to better moneymakers.
---
Overall, it's not really worth doing unless you're exclusively hunting for the pet with no other goal.
---
Devastating blow
---
I absolutely love my hcim. I have made no real progress tbh but I have 10x the fun then on my normie acc.
---
thats just how they want to pk
---
Its okay to have opinions that are wrong.
---
Kidding, honestly both are great and some people are able to follow videos easier than text or vice verse.
---
He sent me a very hateful and powerful message, along with pictures of his crying face. I wouldn't want to post it here, that's a bit too far.
---
I’ve killed 120 mithril dragons today and around 80 on previous slayer tasks. Am I just unlucky getting my first chewed bones or do I need to speak to someone to “unlock” the drop?
---
OSRS, sorry.
---
Damn called him shit at the game haha, I'm waiting for him to post on osrs sub
---
I am sad again
---
Buying Runescape girlfriend 6B

Nothing is real

Lol I actually went to high school in ga (ssi in pic) with the guy in that meme. He had like 3-4 shirts he wore all 4 years. Each diff wolf theme. Good ol wolfie. He would literally run around campus “howling”..he wasn’t super popular amongst people lol
---
Bruh come on we talk about this shit daily in ts how is this suppose to be a leak
---
????
---
J1mmy recently started one called Procrastinators, and he has another one called Bankstandin'.
---
It was fun to alch while watching something going on and knowing there'd be others alching to talk to. The walkways above the duel arena used to be the same and now they're super dead even though sand casino is as popular as ever.

These are just my ordering of relative difficulty from the ones I’ve done:

Happy to answer questions about why I ordered them how I did.
---
Yes. There was an incident years back when hundreds of people got all their accounts banned because they were using a VPN that was also used by a big bot farm for RWTing. 
---
Since then they don't really do IP bans, they have to manually assure each account belong to the same person.
---
Rollback omegalul
---
That’s way too long lol
---
Xbox?
---
we do it to hide our shame of scaping. but it also makes me realize how lazy everybody else is... i scape SOO much but i'm still fit.. what's your excuse?
---
Someone stacks banks full of burnt food?
---
Your external IP will be the same, but the router will assign separate internal IPs to every individual device 
---
Internal IPs typically look something like 192.168.0.1 then 192.168.0.2 then 192.168.0.3 and so on while public IP addresses are unique to for every connection to your ISP. For example, 5.172.123.456 or 25.123.456.52
---
yea, thats what i did.
---
Using those 4 specs with some good rng you will get better times

yes ive read this. I am not receiving the hats that I have the kills for. Only one

Brilliant

tried it. not sure whats going on :/

Nothing wrong with liking 12 year olds? You’re actually fucked you filthy piece of shit
---
I have a main with almost base 70s, but I have a hcim too. Been thinking of switching to it. I just don't have fun anymore. I accomplished everything I wanted to. All skilling sets, quest cape, all hard diaries.. You've inspired me to transition somehow lmao. Feel free to add me!

Username - "Eddie Murphy"

They can check if the account belongs to him
---
You clearly haven’t seen soup’s guides
---
what happened Dec 2016
---
Disgusting pigs. Bunch of nazi fucking incels
---
Holy shit. that is actually disgusting behaviour. "12 is fine but 8 is too young" - ROT leaders.
---
also the part where they said "dont say this infront of everyone we'll talk about it later just the \*boys\*"
---
meaning that they clearly dont even see what's wrong with it? this must be due to some sort of mental illness or something. someone please report these disgusting weirdos, personally i have a 12 year old sister and if their are no consequences for this disgusting behaviour then i am truly embarassed to be apart of this world. these are the type of people that talk about it alot and seriously consider it before one day they actually go and do it. sick fucks i hope they get life in jail and banned from their favourite game
---
Well i never would have imagined that being a real subreddit....
---
You need to be on task for it.
---
More things to sell, more attracted buyers, more motivated sellers.
---
At every step people promote that economy, not just the purchasing one

I want an illuminati quest with Hans. He's been here since the beginning and I bet he knows things.

Did u talk to oziach yet?
---
ok

Dragons are known to sleep with their hoard

Is there a reason why you chose 6 defence specifically? Fucking hilarious, 10x worse than 2 defence or even 5 defence. Not low enough to not matter, and not high enough for it to be beneficial for any gear
---
*RUFF*
---
You’ve got to understand as incredible as your story is as far as any of us are aware it’s just a story, creative writing almost. 
---
We need some sort of proof
---
Actually it's more around 8-10$/h assuming 15m/h at TOB. Plus theres always the element of luck. One streamer for example got 2 scythes in 2 days recently, technically making him up to $1600 in just 2 days of "working".
---
Move the WC guild into here
---
beyond disgusting, jagex needs to take action!
---
&gt;uses the word 'incel' unironically
---
...ok.

you can only retaliate in self defense, since you have to wake up vorkath he’s off limits

The Dharoker loses aggro first by fighting them normally, and then switches gear.

no one:

Maybe stiff competition and high rent has caused these demons to build societies outside of hell but we keep messing things up!

intermediate is a shit show unless there’s not enough people for vet and the high levels spill over
---
Currently, bots aren't using bonds because you can get a free week of membership with the still-running mobile promotion and you can buy an edu email address for like $0.25 that gives you access to twitch prime and one month of runescape membership.
---
The reason everyone has been seeing bots so much more in the last few months is because of these promos. I'd be fine dealing with a few bots in game if I knew they were the ones indirectly supporting jagex by removing bonds from the game, but currently that isn't the case.
---
He used to sell fire capes
---
jesus you're fuckin lame
---
A Pmod, I believe named "Thanks", was banned because they verbally attacked the company they represented. Despite knowing that the Pmod program have internal channels where they can raise these issues, they decided to make his criticism public.
---
However, since the criticism is related to Jagex's terrible Support, the community is saying the verbal attack was justified and that Jagex shouldn't have banned said Pmod.
---
Is your total spread out over different bows? I believe it has to be one bow, like the comp ogre bow. Right click &gt; check kills.
---
Also I feel like her acc would be 100% banned from rwt’ing. 100 bonds? No way it wouldn’t be flagged
---
you're incredible well done
---
I wonder how much he sold and how much he got for it
---
You go girl lmfao
---
I can't fucking wait to look like that
---

I'm in my early twenties and make (a lot) more than $18,000 in a year. I know exactly what that money can and can't do. If you know how to handle it yes it's a nice sum that can become something much nicer down the line, but it's not changing anyone's life overnight. You will still need to go to work (you wouldn't even be able to move to part time because of $18,000), you aren't paying off a brand new house, you aren't moving to a better area, and your life hasn't substantially changed.  
---
 The best thing you could do with it, if you don't have any immediate high interest debt or things that need to be taken care of, is invest it wisely and let it grow. But having a slightly better nest egg isn't some life changing miracle, it's just a nice bonus.
---
Way back in the day a guy demanded I give him my moth scimmy or he’d delete my account and get me banned but atleast I swindled him out of his steel scimmy so it wasn’t a complete loss.
---
I wonder what that mofo is doing nowadays.
---
You don't really lose access to it all, I mean look at KempQ, he rwt'd and only got banned on 1 account, still has a streaming/YT career and no one gave a shit.  Sure it makes it harder since you won't be getting those jagex shout outs / going to their events, but it doesn't ruin your career.
---
Skill Spec's girlfriend owns a gold selling site and he gets invited to events lol
---
Hell, look even at Sparc Mac, if you want a more extreme example.   Jagex doesn't even like him. He sold tons of gold back in the day, got perm banned and is one of the top streamers/youtubers for osrs by far.
---
True AF . you wont see me wit no Fat Bitch
---
I got the pet pretty early, I’m just so invested that I don’t wanna stop till I get a claw. It’ll make my gp an hour go up by like 1.2m at this point.
---
I understand what you’re saying but you shouldn’t ban an Ironman account for rwt’ing on a main when gp from the Ironman wasn’t sold
---
i do not know where the other 3 went but there were 100 opened
---
Use a dhcb maybe
---
Does mage bank lever still work?
---
Found it. Cheers
---
He is die
---
Jagex tried to close Runelite because they were laundering money through osbuddy. Selling RS gold is the best way for jagex employees to supplement their shitty income. Mod MatK left to take one for the team since jagex had to tone it down on the amount of cash flowing through osbuddy since it's decline in userbase.
---
Jagex doesn't fix the native client because if people aren't using it, there's a chance they start using osbuddy. This makes it easier to cook the books.
---
Personally I like it because I am an ironman so I pickpocket master farmer for seeds. I pick pocket in farming guild on the herb side and get to see it skip stages and replant. It skips more often than I thought it would, but I definitely see your point.
---
well yeah but dwh  or bgs? void or other armor ? salve ei still ?
---
That's your personal bias and opinion though, some people don't care about their accounts after a certain point.  Look at all the hardcore ironman leaving their accounts to rot and restarting as soon as they die.  We're talking about accounts that are nearly maxed, and these guys don't even think twice and do it voluntarily.  Look at it as having fun along the way rather than the destination.  Ever heard of Oziris?  He's remade hardcore ironmen whenever he dies even though he has multiple maxed accounts now.
---
Well u havent seen what OP looks like yet
---
Dude nice text meme bro!
---
I do play the female, just think its less ugly. But think what you want.
---
The accounts need to exist.  Even if they never log in, there's an opportunity to match IP's to other banned accounts or similar.
---
Many sites / games use similar features to prevent people from making too many accounts.  Whether or not Jagex acts on it is a different story but it's a lie thinking it couldn't help.
---
I don't play the game buddy so wouldn't know if he did, calm down buddy for all i know shes not in Florida and can be a coincidence. Best regards comrade.
---
The guy is a dick, but the sad thing is you probably helped him. Now he might quit and focus on reality. The real prorevenge might have been to just leave him, 5 years later he would still be living in his parents house playing RS all day.
---
Yikes.
---
iphone? could be some game center fuckery
---
There is also a free 7 day trial through mobile - enough time to buy another bond with members money
---
Honestly I realized and then i had already left the thread so I kept it
---
I’ll PM you my setup. It’s a maxed setup but I’ll include relevant downgrades.

fake as fk
---
Who the fuck ran all the way to fally? Draynor is right there.
---
Man when I did that I profited 1m from 6h of work. :/
---
the idea that runescape's bots are burner accounts is, frankly, wrong. Sir Pugger finds bots that are millions of xp deep in skills, with some of the bots he has found being ranked in top 150 Highscores in skills....and that's just ones he randomly comes across...those aren't burner accounts lol using promotions.   
---
and botting has been bad in osrs since the start, it's not the last few months.
---
Test
---
fuck him
---
She also said she treated herself to armour and weapons and buyable skills
---
Sellers have much more effect on the market.
---
This is amazing haha, great concept. Never looked at it like this
---
It doesn't do the job good enough to me.
---
dhcb, no bgs, elite void/salve ei, don't use slayer helm
---
Arma slay helm anguish or void and salve. Dont spec
---
dont need dwh or bgs with dhcb, use void and salve ei
---
dont go around telling people your life story thinking they care you might feel good having a convo while skilling and dude is trying to get answers to all the security questions
---
Yeah you'd have to organize that with your clan, or just have items on hand to sell and re-buy.
---
I used to hustle rune sets buy in peices for 130-160k and sell sets 170-180k ea behind west bank near the staff shop
---
I added you :)
---
I’m always happy to chat in game, whether about rs or just whatever’s on your mind.
---
we do raids is the main "learner raids" discord, they have workshops every saturday around noon/1 eastern as well as sporadically throughout the week. if you're max combat with 90+ range/mage and meet their minimum gear requirements then you can go with them.
---
We do raids discord
---
i fished for a bit, then i would just buy inventories of lobsters from people for cheap and go and cook and sell
---
People are honestly stupid. There is no evidence and there are things that the individual says that are fishy. Like mentioning she was drunk when she wrote it, yet the whole post was in near-perfect formatting. Also, the reddit account being 0 days old is odd as well. I do not understand how there is no skepticism about this, but I shouldn't be suprised when there were other post similiar to this...
---
those guys offering to buy rainbow fish for a lot of money are scamming right? Figure they dumped all their rainbow fish and once you buy it they just log out leaving you with the fish
---
Don't worry, just did 200 and didn't profit. Now I know where my Ranger boots went
---
I mean its not like the current viewers are all the viewers who ever watch him.  The man gets like 4-5k subs a month on twitch, it's no secret or news that he does and that's definitely at the very least 15k.  Not to mention if you keep track of his donations for an hour or two you'll realize hes easily doubling it if not more in donations alone.  That's without even counting sponsorships/youtube
---
We do raids, google it
---
What are  the minimum gear requirements
---
&gt;Are you going to drop trade and hope the other person doesn't DC or fake DCing to try and get their money back? 
---
Yes.  They either pick up the items or they don't.  They can't fake anything
---
I remember when the Christmas Tree Hat came out (about 1 year before I quit RS3) people were selling them on world 1 for 40m, and buying on world 2 for 42 or 43m. The price fluctuated so much so quickly that prices were not consistent across all worlds. Made a very easy 20m, but then I made the mistake of having one of these hats in my inventory overnight and when I woke up it was down to 28m. Still made like 6m over 20min of work.
---
Congratulations on winning Analogy of the Week ! 
---
Meet at Edgeville Bank PvP world for your prize.
---
Not really viable. They can't pay back in gp because their account is banned, and paying back to Jagex in dollars means they accept gp has real world value (which is something they have been denying for a while)
---
I think that's spot on. Lose the account, keep the money. Alt accounts should only be banned if they are involved in the rule breaking in any way (received money from it, were botted on, etc)
---
If he just has an iron account that never had anything fishy going on, I don't really see why ban it
---
When they try to take them they have access to information that no one else should such as precious account names or account age
---
Just wondering why a max player would be at redwoods. Just BC of how afk?
---
sick zombie walk
---
Good point but for 5 grand I'll figure it out
---
Rip that username too
---
I mean, I don't agree with the way he said it, but he probably just means that people who alch would rather do it while agility or something to be more efficient
---
But did he rwt the money he made with that?
---
Absolutely, I just (incorrectly) assumed after defeating Jad, it was over. I didn't realize you had to kill the healers too.
---
Well luckily my account name isnt visable and the age is literally the only info they could know.
---
ur my favourite person tbh
---
I used to cook the lobsters I fished and take them into the volcano to fight lesser demons. Lesser demons didn't even drop anything remotely good, I just thought it was what you were supposed to do when you got decent stats. No joke probably would have been better off clicking on cows all day instead.
---
He sold firecapes but it was for rsgp so i dont think thats rwt, he did admit to rwting in the past though, first time he rwted he bought a bgs with the cash lol.
---
... selling for gp. lmao he charged like ~500m for the rhino cape back in the day when the Kiln came out iirc. I remember because a of mine bought one from him and I was jelly.
---
That’s fine I was just assuming you’d post more on reddit. Just trying to help
---
I like that there are comments saying it's fake because she gets too into detail about the game and others saying it's fake because she clearly doesn't know much about the game.
---
Hitpoints and Strength are two of the most common. Prayer is definitely the coolest untrimmed out of the ones you listed
---
How did you have 4 stacks of gold?
---
People post these items for super high and the other person buys them for that price. It's a way of trying to mask the real world trading for gold, instead of trading it directly for example
---
Cool you did a thing. Why are you posting here now karma whore?
---
Lol
---
There is no evidence of that no.
---
Nah I appreciate it though! I probably will but even though my account is so old, the username linked to my account isnt even the same my the current name
---
Ah, the comments severly confused me.
---
835 kc no drops
---
“He” is not real and this is a karma troll lmao
---
How does this apply to a max cape? Your argument for removing staminas is weak and for some reason seems very personal.
---
Bro we're all scared of your main. Please stop bringing him up, we're trying to have a good time. 
---
There are children here!
---
Add a tbow spawn too.
---
His reply was obviously a joke lmao
---
Why because they brought the prices down purposefully. I mean I’m just being realistic. Those prices don’t drop so sudden. Most accounts who’ve wanted to play for end game content started a long time ago. Most of those people if they do still play aren’t buying and selling their items like a dragon axe all the time. Tell me how that item could be farmed fast enough to increase over 10%.? Also explain the herb situation. The prices here aren’t real. I never mentioned seeds but the other guy already knew that seeds were being farmed incredibly. Why is that? The bots that were farming the master farmer were trying to bring down the price of seeds and all those accounts started rushing birdhouses to also bring down the price of seeds. That’s crazy.
---
Except it's not. Someone made illegal money off of someone else's content. It's against the law and people have been sued for illegal goldfarming before.
---
Imp Catcher II
---
No one uses roast beast meat, if you look at the trade volume 50 traded in one day is an extremely busy day.
---
Since there aren't actual people buying them normally, you can buy gold by listing 1000 beast meat for 300k each and the person you're buying gold from just buys them and voila, you just got 300M without having to directly interact with them.
---
Just got my blessing, just waiting for the new poll to go through where we’re all locked in the Trawler minigame forever.
---
S
---
Nah I know that didn't happen. I got control back from it before it was banned. It's currently known as 'No displayname set' on the website.
---
You can put toppings on pizzas at the GE
---
florida man plays runescape :O
---
its more for nostalgia. rs isnt really for everyone. you either played it back in the day or its just a boring repetitive clicking simulator. sorry
---
For an accurate hitbox I assume. Probably more useful in mobs that arnt these ones
---
But it's the person doing the illegal activity in real life. It's not the account just simply abusing a glitch or something. It's the actual human being behind the account. Therefore, ban the person.
---
What about when those big steamer / youtubers put their pooled banks up at the duel arena for a competition?
---
when i go to buy it gives me " **One or more of the items could not be added to your basket, this may be because you already own the item or it is unavailable at this time.** " is this because i already have membership or just a bug?
---
So uhh, castle wars date tonight?
---
That’s a dirty dirty move you pulled
---
But he pulled the ultimate dirty, and I’m glad you did what you did.
---
I’m sorry you dated a scumbag for as long as you did, I hope you find yourself a man who isn’t a piece of shit
---
Which method would y’all recommend for getting the angler’s outfit? Aerial fishing or the trawler?
---
"Nope, don't see it. Nope, don't see it. Nope, don't see it. Hey, who's that guy that just happened to wander in here? What... He got it! You're going to give me my money back, or I'll do a chargeback."
---
Then he goes back onto his other account who was that "random guy" who happened to wander in, and trades the gold over to his main.
---
It's totally unnecessary bullshit. There's no reason to do it. No one would ever do it.
---
What's xD levels of hilariousness to me is that you're on season 3 of a show you think is bullshit.
---
This picture makes me really uncomfortable. I can't even read your text
---
Honestly I think they should do it after he gets it. Cause it actually does make sense to add it. They could even add an examine text in memory of swampy boi
---
How do I break this vicious cycle, I want to do other things but I can't help but to do max gp/hr stuff. Everything else feels like a waste of time.
---
I've never rwted but I thought the rwter would log in to both accounts to do it anyway?
---
You can put toppings on a pizza outside the GE.
---
It's def been posted for him lol
---
This post is probably fake but situations like this do exist according to a few women I've dated lol I think I'd like being in the leech's shoes, but I'd feel way too guilty relying on someone supporting me. Hell I've gone through 2-3 month patches of unemployment while in a relationship and my girl buying me mcdonald's made me feel awful and useless.
---
Perhaps I would've upvoted if I knew what this was about
---
Damn I got the whole set in like 20 games.
---
Plenty of people traded their RS3 banks over to OSRS.
---
Yeah but Buyers have an alternative, buying bonds. Yet they intentionally do it illegally instead. IMO they're more at fault. Maybe an unpopular opinion.
---
Well this is silly. What if Ash thinks that there should be a spinning wheel in Morytania because it fits thematically with the clothing store and taxidermist? Now were not adding this into the game because of content creators...
---
Wtf is an offline website?
---
&gt;shit 90% of the players have participated at some point in RWT
---
That's a big claim. Got any evidence besides your own speculation?
---
True but stealing some virtual currancy which btw all value is based off of black markets which is illegal in itself pales in comparison to sharing somebody's nudes
---
Fuck the haters messaging you.
---
You can put toppings on a pizza outside the GE. I don't understand why everyone is picking this mundane thing out as the killer plot hole.
