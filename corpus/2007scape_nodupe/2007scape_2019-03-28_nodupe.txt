3800 dry i hate you.

The clan fights are 99% of the tournament, 1v1 is a small portion of it.
---

---
Clan fights decides who gets in and being in a clan makes it a lot easier to get in. 
---
Also didn't they get rot a statue and not an individual player? 
---
Yeah I was thinking this the other day. I wish they’d stop giving out the tradeable rares, because like you said was just an aura about the old ones. 
---
Now that’s the oldschool i love
---
Don’t do meth, kids.
---
You really arguing that GoT isn't more complex than any of those second rate drama's and soap operas? That's how I know you're just arguing nonsense.
---
It's incredibly easy to create magical and fantasy worlds man. Pick up any number of fantasy books and you'll find a fantasy world.
---
Also, if that were the determining quality of why Harry Potter became successful, why is it that the massive amount of books and movies with unique and fleshed out fantasy worlds didn't become just as successful?
---
Making a fantasy world is easy. Let's not pretend Harry Potter's is unique either, it's basically just taking regular high magic world, in a contemporary setting, and adding a slight twist that the wizarding world is a secret to the mundane world.
---
Literally the most "unique" part about it is the fact the wizarding world is secret, and that's one of the most commonly used tropes in fantasy.
---
You want to know the problem?
---
You LIKE Harry Potter, so because I've insulted it, you've taken it personally. Except, you can't rationally explain WHY you like it, you can only cite details about it, except none of those details are particularly special. 
---
You just think they are because you're predisposed to liking Harry Potter. Why? Because you liked it when you were a kid, because you were told it was good by someone and you enjoyed it when you watched it and left it at that.
---
&gt;It's your opinion versus over a billion who disagree with you. It takes an incredible amount of arrogance and a stubborn commitment to being a contrarian to think you're right and everyone else is wrong.
---
This basically sums up why you're wrong. You're using public opinion as a way of strengthening your own beliefs. It's how the vast majority of people decide on their opinions.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum

Here you go, a link showing you that it's a logical fallacy. The vast majority of people who think like you do are thinking fallaciously. 
---
I'll only vote yes if he kisses my dad too.
---
&gt;And runescape did go offline when runescape 3 was launched
---
No. RuneScape (2) transformed into RuneScape 3. Stats/items/etc. carried over.
---
to add to that he got a pet and didn't notice. I think a player might have taken a second or two to right click/examine it, maybe rotate the camera a bit to check it out?
---
Farming pet as in Treebeard

Says the guy who plays video games all day
---
Teaming at its core *isn't bad*.  When teams have the ability to use alts to bully down choke points to quests 20 versus 1, it's a toxic.
---
1. Get rid of alting entirely.  One real person, one account.
---
2. Jagex needs to have the users sign an agreement and then assign a jmod to vet any top 16 players (e.g., anyone eligible for a prize).  Anyone who logged into 2 accounts is disqualified. Yes this would be done after already playing the tournament, but the potential punishment itself should hopefully deter clans, especially clans who funnel resources.
---
3. Remove PVP multi lines across the majority of the game.  There are some places where they make sense and it would be *actually cool* to see actual clan wars occur over key training areas (Catacombs of Kourend, for example).  Right now there are so many areas to bully out/choke hold, clans don't care to fight each other.  One clan gets Shilo Village, one clan gets DS2, one clan gets GWD, one clan gets Catas, and nobody cares to fight each other over the other resource.  Scarcity will make things actually interesting for clans and will force them to also waste resources fighting each other instead of solo players.
---
Same! Can she sleep in my room tonight btw? You've been hogging her all week.

Test cricket lasts 5 days
---
Do you lose rune pouch on death?
---
The PVP people would never go for a mechanic change that affects PVP like that.
---
Do you guys have a notification set up for whenever wiki is mentioned on reddit? It amazes me how quick you guys answer some times &lt;3
---
there is one if you dont disable it the first time you go in
---
if rushing and tbing is not a problem why are you so afraid of leaving your RSN.
---
Man I wish there were more update videos from clans or a reporter able to talk about different clans goals and such during the tourney. Especially with Torvesta out that content would be welcome instead of these type of fight videos with not much context to their lead up.
---
Do the players gain an advantage by not sleeping the entire period?
---
He pay
---
Hejfixiakm,djejan zuxiiahznnfdiwj 
---
This has made my entire week. Thank you reddit and op.
---
Anyone else having some weird graphical glitch in runelite for the past couple days? A lot of weird artifacting or something, I think.
---
We do on our Discord server.
---
Got him.
---
See, I agree with what you're saying more than any psuedo argument anyone else has made. You've gotten to the crux of it. We like these things because they're a part of us. Their quality doesn't matter to us. We enjoy them unconditionally.
---
I love Dragon Ball Z, yet I can admit it's pretty badly written. I love Harry Potter, yet I can admit it's not deserving of it's hype. I love osrs, and i'd actually argue that osrs has some amazing features that other games should defintely try out.
---
Just being critical and analytical of something doesn't mean you don't enjoy it. I think people often forget that and especially with things we've made "ours" like nostalgia, we get defensive quickly.
---
Yep- I read somewhere a 3rd was stolen. Jagex is trying to tell me it is because of Runelite. I did use it for the very first time yesterday, but I researched it first and everything I saw on it said it was trusted. I really do not think that is it. I do have an rs authenticator- so, how? They just do not seem to want to take the time to fix this situation. All these OG names that are being hacked or whatever you want to call it and they can not seem to see that it is possibly something wrong within their system.
---
Should understand what gatekeeping means

Start with the fucking dicing bots

Yeah but I was the superior spawns from them lol, idc dark bow

I’ve done 200 kills on my Ironman just catching the charter ship from Catherby and running down. Paying the 1600g. 
---
Had 80 teleport scrolls drop in those kills as well. You don’t need agi for Zulrah. 
---
I just have lunars and catherby teleport in my house, decent amount of kills and hour. 
---
Congrats

If only there was some minigame where two giant clans could compete against eachother in a massive war.......

&gt; Even I who read more than I would say anyone else in my graduating class of 445 (and I know this because I read about a book ever week or two through high school) failed at recognizing the quality of some books, and over estimated the quality of other books. Not even because of a lack of reading experience, but rather as a lack of a historical cultural, social and political knowledge.
---
You do not need to be well versed in those things to understand the quality of a book. Social and political knowledge in youth has increased a substantial amount in recent years, but a book does not need to rely on deep messages and political undertones to be quality literature. However, there's a reason they teach books such as Farenheit 451, Death of a Salesman, and 1984 in highschools. Teenagers aren't stupid. They're aware of the world around them and are capable of complex thought. Are they perfect? No. Will there opinions on important matters change over time? Most likely. However, they are still capable of determining quality in the media they consume independent of what others tell them.
---
Yea, a 12 year old won't enjoy or fully understand To Kill a Mockingbird but the quality of a book isn't completely determine by its message. 
---
&gt; Also, the circle of people you're around vastly influences your opinion on that. If you're studying English literature in college, you're going to think everyone reads a book a month.
---
The average amount of books read by an American every year is 12. And yes, I'm aware that the number is inflated by people who read way above the average. However, the most common number reported by the Pew Research Center is still 4. People still read books and can determine quality. Yes, those who read less then others will often turn to reviews to choose a new book. However, they aren't braindead sheep consuming whatever is put in front of them. They won't like a book just because critics said it was good. Millions of kids, adults, and children all loved Harry Potter and thought it was quality literature. Are they all wrong? Are they all just parroting what critics say because they can't think for themselves?
---
Nothin wrong with ragging yo. Sure it's annoying but honestly it's simple a tactic.
---
Thats because the game That’s hated round here (from now on known as ‘the game that must not be named’) has up to like tier 9 weapons or more, and so has the scope to devalue runeite etc. 
---
BiS gear, Buyable skills
---
God DMM was so fun when it just released and nobody really knew wtf they were doing, now it’s an orchestrated cesspool that no casual player will ever go near 
---
It is worth a try. I have tried everything else. The ones that have responded seem content with blaming it on runelite. I really do not think so. I dl ed the proper client. OSB is supposed to be a 3rd party client too, but I do believe a former jmod made it or something? Even if a 3rd party got my info somehow thru runelite, how could they bypass my rs authenticator? I am a computer geek, but not a hacker and I just do not understand how this can happen to people and it be disregarded as if we are all noobs!
---
Engine work unfortunately.
---
However Runelite currently has a plugin that does this. You'll even find yourself right clicking the bankers after you enable it out of sheer muscle memory.
---
I disabled it, that's why I'm asking if Jagex can toggle the warning again
---
Torvesta is a pretty big osrs youtuber in the Pk community, and during the recent Deadman mode tournament he was banned for using an Alt account for merching to gain more money. His defense is that how is what he did different when whole clans funnel resources into a few individuals or lock down valuable training areas.
---
when I rejoined osrs about 2 months back i was at cwars bankstanding in the middle of doing some rc and all of sudden theres just loot showing up underneath, I wonder if this is what happened.
---
Is your philosophy degree going to get you out of jail when you "only killed a kid for a small amount of time"? lmao.
---
What happens next?
---
People would just work with friends. Make it so that everyone has to join a team and that mechanics make other teams you ally with physically not able to backstab yah until the final day.
---
You talk to the doomsayer in lumbridge to enable it again buddy. 
---
There's plenty of warning for dangerous locations as it is. 
---
I'm not trying to sound holier than thou or like an armchair psychologist but this really reaffirms my belief that anonymity reveals a person's true colors. 
---
You have so many 20 something year old men that feel inadequate and take out their frustrations from behind a screen and being outright scum under the guise of anonymity. It makes me wonder how the average Twitch/OSRS/Reddit flamer would react if someone IRL saw their actions behind the screen.
---
*karambwan stops*
---
Thats great to know, Ill check around runelite rn, thanks. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But wait, if runelite can do it, why cant jagex ?
---
Sounds more like you think something is bad because you don't like it, and when your exact logic for why it's bad is applied to something you DO like, you get defensive about it.
---
  
---
Case in point, you're now calling Harry Potter, Law &amp; Order and Grey's Anatomy bad, despite being 3 highly praised cultural successes of last decade. 
---
It's okay to say "I don't like Harry Potter" and nobody would care. You saying J K Rowling is untalented and Harry Potter is cliche is the issue here. You don't have any proof of these two things, just your own opinion. See I'm allowed to like both Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, but one is not better than the other.
---
Only deaths in the wilderness
---
The teams people play in already exist though. The clans know their clanmates, they split the prize money IRL etc.
---
So what happens when you kill players from the other faction? Do you get their loot? If not, you've ruined DMM as a PvP gamemode. If so, you've not stopped clanmates transferring items to one another.
---
Just broke 100 guys- keep the upvotes coming please- thank you so much!
---
So born an asshole but recently flaunting it. Ty for the honesty.
---
I agree.  Its basically just a mass of people being blocked out by overhead prayers and skulls
---
I mean he was muling.
---
Jagex lives on Earth, why don't they fight terrorism too?
---
Try to figure out what’s causing the issue and post on the github for it. Or post here and someone can post it as an issue on the github.

Can't wait to watch the finals with 2 guys in full addy.

Thanks for the reply!
---
you must have not played runescape in the past LUL
---
Yup you can die anywhere. And if it’s not a specific safe mini game or area, then you’ll lose HC status. No where does it ever say a bank is a safe zone.
---
Indeed
---
Dang bro got any of those bonds to send my way I’m trying to save $3.50+$7.50 👀👀👀

Mod Archie still laughing at Ash's goofs many years later.
---
I loved that dig at Torvesta
---
Is that reddit staus in your name now just a normal iron, was it red before you died im asking.
---
&gt;you can either choose to take no damage from them but a guaranteed 50k loss if you die
---
can you explain this point further? what is the 50k you are referring to.
---
3727 liker? Hmm that seems sus 
---
No I have a regular ironman account, I made this to see how far I could get as a hcim skiller
---
Theres no money on the lvl 3 mate. He will sell it for cash, or for rsgp which he’ll sell for cash. 
---
Is it possible to do end game content without much skilling? If someone created an account and essentially just did combat skills, what things would they be missing out on? 
---
I feel like skills are important as my friends and I progress to end game but they are focusing just on combat and I'm trying to complete quests along the way. Will we reach a point where they need to skill/quest to progress further?
---
Fuck is paying 11¥ to give us.
---
Play the seasonal then. It isn't clan dominated at all and it's very hard to die as a solo player.
---
I would just like to know why the game mechanic exists that a monster that isn't aggrod to you can suddenly be turned aggro by another player, why is that a thing that exists? It's a genuine question
---
Those socks must be so sweaty after walking around all day haha imagine if she gagged you with them and walked all over you haha

You show manners, upvote!

When you use a VPN, you mask your ip address. You don't change your MAC Address, your HDDid, your OS info nor other 200 things an app can use to identify your computer.
---
Unless the person doing the deed knows every single thing Jagex logs and is spoofing everything, they are identifiable. VPNs don't hide **who** you are, they hide **where** you are.
---
Really? Any other significant numbers in there?
---
You use a ballista in a raid with me and I’m kicking you ASAP. It’s dps is worse than an addy or rune crossbow, can’t remember which one.
---
You wouldn’t happen to take Reddit orders, would you?
---
Did you fall for the twitch scam?
---
Imagine entering the wilderness thinking its a safe-space, the whole idea of entering the wild is that its a dangerous activity, and runs the risk of being killed. 
---
People sell names and there is extreme potential for abusing Jagex returning names where accounts are "seemingly" hacked which would exponentially create more work for Jagex to benefit scammers. Due to this I don't think Jagex should help you which sucks if you've legitimately been hacked however you should secure your account better in the future and be careful what you download and run.
---
Who actually uses the phrase beta or alpha males outside of the internet 
---
Because clans are scum. They make everyone hate the wilderness and PKing.
---
I know Lumbridge is supposed to be a parallel to Cambridge. Pretty much everything east of River Salve is heavily influenced by Eastern Europe. The desert areas are obviously influenced by Egypt and Arabia. Karamja is supposed to be like Pacific Islanders I think.
---
Nvm then. I’ve never done raids myself but I’ve seen people bring ballista
---
do you have proof of that. disease should not take an extra cycle. if your plant is still diseased at the start of the next growth cycle it dies. if it isn't it grows.
---
Depends what you're looking for, man! Wasn't the intention of my post hahaha, but shoot me a message!
---
I’m just commenting because I know this anime lmao. 
---
because no one likes when a good story is retconned, especially when its meaningless retcon with its only purpose being to pander to weirdos 
---
No, I did not fall for anything. I am not the only person this has happened to :-( I really think Jagex has been compromised somehow.
---
All these comments are so bitter. Congratulations man! Don't let the haters get you
---
Ok, got ya! lol  I found out from Jagex support the person who stole my rsn has been banned though. So, that is good news!
---
Yeah it’s pretty garb, especially since you have to bring 2 extra items to use it. I guess it could be used in place of a crossbow if you’re completely new and don’t know better tho
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out :) .
---
This why literally every pker I know doesn’t go near DMM, shits not pking it’s organised ragging 
---
Do the DMM winners even get to keep their loot?
---
Youre right. This sub is a terrible place for RS discussion. Its not a serious board at all, yet, JageX treats it as one.
---
&gt;The place where torvesta's alt spent all of his time, the grand exchange
---
lmaooo oooooof
---
Idk why you quitting when the ge came out makes my argument moot. If anything it makes your argument moot because you don't even play the game anymore so why should your opinion matter. Js bb
---
At this rate - they will
---
Same happening to me. I made a post about his a few days ago. Idk what’s happened. If it’s a security thing, I get it but there was no dev blog about it so I assume it’s a bug
---
More than a majority uses runelite as their client. Jagex can’t use that as an excuse now...
---
&gt; And before you say it, feeding a few select players =/= muling. 
---
Isn't it though? When all of that gear given to the "select player" has been sitting on safe-zone accounts for 99% of DMM and transferred to them right at the very end.
---
Oh that's good! Hope you got that name back! 
---
What this guy says is true, I have a friend who worked for another game company on the same science park who ofcourse made friends with a few jiggleflix employees by being so close to their HQ.
---
Train hunter, catch magpies and ninjas at puro puro (dragon if you want to get all the way to that lvl). Alch drops
---
!ThesaurizeThis
---
Orange hair man bad
---
They are trying to though. lol Just sad really.
---
Why didn’t they make everyone on dmm an iron man? The way it’s going with the increased drop rates of everything they may as well 
---
I have 85 range and want to get it above 90. I’m doing nmz with a magic short bow (i) and rune arrows with void and such. I don’t want to spend a whole bunch of money to lvl it up, and I want it to be afk since I’m busy with work for the majority of the day. Should I stick to this or is there a better afk way?
---
HOLY SHIT BOYS
---
Take a big shot for this retarded DMM idea 
---
Divide that by 10 and that's still an upper bound
---
Serious question: what parts of osrs require any skill at all, let alone high skill?
---
Fucking incinerated 
---
Oh whoa thats amazing
---
Big ‘differance’
---
Those are no mere dragon boots, the are blinged out d boots!
---
IIRC F2P ironmen mine silver, make symbols and sell them to the store for cash. If you were to go members, look into Agility Pyramid or HAM Chests for early cash.
---
Also, if you haven't yet, do the Stronghold of Security for an easy 10k

holy shit ur so alpha dude can i suck ur dick???
---
for the shilo content skip to [8:48](https://youtu.be/85c-kIOBM78?t=528)
---
Shut the fuck up lol
---
I have my main on an account that has an actual username log in, that I've never shown anywhere. I've always been curious if that really helps security of the account 
---
86 runecrafting might be worth it  😩
---
Imagine making a mistake that you can learn from
---
40m from 250 hours of running in circles with a click every 3 seconds is not a good reward. 
---
It would make sense to have more progressive run energy scaling with agility levels so high agility players don't need so many stamina potions.
---
The proposed resting idea doesn't fix anything that is necessarily broken, but it can make a certain annoying part of the game less annoying. I don't know why people want the game to be annoying.
---
You can swap DMM and OSRS gold. It's against the rules but JMods don't seem to enforce it.
---
They do have stories that matter, you personally  just don't pay attention to them. The whole elf quest line is pretty interesting to me at least ( although I admit that I only looked up the story stuff after I finished them)
---
Also, rs quests are different to all the other mmorpg bullshit that consists of killing 10 monsters or an escort mission. That's why I like them as well
---
Tbh, I just hit 252 QP and only have 7 quests left to do and I still feel like a bitch for not having them done. Especially the 3 that I have the requirements for..
---
I don't know if people know this but people sell names like these on a certain fourm and make big profit off it you could of just been targetted.
---
Even more classic reddit is op missing the point.
---
a) he has asked jagex if it was ok to do what he was doing in previous tournaments and they gave him the all clear, but have now 180'd
---
b) he only had to do what he was doing to stand a chance against rampant dodgy clans dominating the tournament, bending sometimes flat out breaking rules, and funnelling supplies/gear from many clan members to few leaders, giving them huge unfair advantage against solo players and yet they go unpunished, often winning
---
c) players have been displeased with dmm as a whole since it began and it's still fucked and instead of fixing the problem they punish people trying to compete with it, torvesta is just a high profile figurehead bringing attention to an old problem
---
d) jagex gave a vague response without properly addressing peoples concerns, not helping their side of the argument
---
e) crab meme
---
More info please, stats? 
---
have you heard of the mining and smithing rework?
---
My rsn was stolen awhile ago as well and I would love to have it back. I’m curious about this reserved feature. If my name wasn’t changed again on the account it might still be “reserved” even after the 30 days and it doesn’t show the name changed anymore? I can’t find the account on the high scores but I can add the account on my friends list.
---
Meanwhile I have 0 unique drops at 378kc on my ironwoman...
---
Would it be better xp an hour than doing it in your poh? If it isn’t than it would be dead content unfortunately :(
---
Awesome idea though 
---
OP, what's the name of the song? That is an absolute banger
---
It's different for the people being pk'd compared to PKers because a PKer can PK multiple people and they have to keep hopping to find people, who might've already been killed by someone else.
---
Tax evasion is also illegal, but if you utilize certain loopholes you can avoid paying without *breaking the law*. Just because someone is funneled gear doesn't mean they broke the current rules to do so, however you can also accomplish it by breaking the rules.
---
I even gave you the example above - if I get 5 of my friends to play DMM and at the end of the season they all give me their gear, that's 100% within the rules. However, if I am the one who owns and operates those 5 accounts, intending to store gear risk-free from my main, it's 100% bannable.
---
I really don't understand how this logic isn't sitting with you, but w/e. 
---
what are your statisticals?
---
Regardless, quest cape is a good starter goal, will get you lots of important unlocks, lvls, experience with game etc.
---
the bracelet of etherium ? or whatever it’s called 
---
Yea, someone else just told me that. Isn't that crazy though? What is the purpose of using all this stuff to protect your account if they can just log in to your account and steal your rsn?
---
GZ
---
It could offer rewards that would make it cheaper (but still slower).
---
Makes sense for the regular game but for seasonal there is money to be won ofc you wanna be max efficiency.
---
Efficiencyscape ruined runescape
---
Wtf is going on with all the hacked accounts?? Jagex do something wtf is this shitty site Where people can hack you Even if you have everything secured. It just means no one is safe. And if this has something to do with runelite or osbuddy They need to come out and say something. Because there has been alot of post lately of people getting hacked and thinking there is a breach in a 3rd party software!
---
Appletards unable to portrait OSRS mobile lmao. Yall are jokes.
---
That is exactly what I think tbh :-(  
---
Nope, it's perfectly allowed since it's basically an operating system function in mousekeys.
---
What was it before?
---
Some give them some aloe
---
Compared to back in the day - it is much less active

good luck! let us know the outcome once it's clear 
---
Expanding pvp is fine, expanding pvm to the wilderness is not.
---
cant hes not a retard
---
Well, he was disqualified for muling gear, and his response was weak and manipulative; “Muling is when you swap cash between accounts”.
---
Well... he did do just that. It’s the same fucking thing.
---
What the issue is, is how he was singled out, out of the hundreds of others doing the EXACT SAME THING
---
Just don’t use any type of auto clicking/auto typing software and you’re golden
---
I guess that would be mod ash?
---
Only a retard would think that
---
Fuckin' noice, don't have to suffer bone cancer anymore
---
Hey man I said it wasnt well thought out, no need to be toxic xx
---
If someone already has it , then you can not. I think it is 35 days on reserve unless you change it a 2nd time (poor security feature imo- but, better than what we had before which was nothing!). If someone else has your account, then you have to wait until they drop it and it has been over 35 days (do not quote me on the exact days please). Keep checking for it &lt;3 I hope you get yours back too!
---
I understand that but the style and everything is the same blocky
---
A
---
Oh I see, sorry revs is content I haven't really touched yet. 
---
Perhaps they're referring to the number of new pkers coming into the wild and how it is very low, or even negative so that there are less and less pkers as time goes on. This has to do with the toxicity of singles and multi clans that drive people away and take over the image of pking, so it doesn't become attractive to new players.
---
Look at the good doggy 
---
You’re right, that’s what I meant anyway
---
I think it all looks good. 
---
Imagine being an Ironman. Doing 1000 chests and still no Torag’s helm
---
I did blast furnace for a bit but it's way too click intensive. I did make a bond through it, but I'm not going to do that again.
---
I'm currently at hunter 51 and I've been hunting eclectic imps to resell (which actually made me a bond in a very relaxing 5 or so hours).
---
Save time....

To flex on free to plays 
---
The death page on osrs wiki says this, emphasis partly mine:
---
&gt; If a player dies in cases of player killing, in the Wilderness, or PvP worlds, the loot is only visible for one minute to the player who dealt the most damage before becoming visible to all players. Items lost on death in this scenario will disappear *if not picked up after two minutes.*
---
&gt;I’m sure you’ll get plenty of that new pvp content you people keep bitching about if you keep it up.
---
Actually, Jagex has addressed the fact that non-PvPers like you who vote no to every and any PvP update are an issue and will be addressing PvP polling soon. https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/1098660359706238981?s=20
---
Are u retarded 
---
That is what a lot of people are saying. It is very scary!! I really think they need to do some work on the rs authenticator and reserve name features. They have come a long way in osrs, but are security needs some attention. This crap needs to stop!!

&gt; Other big topic I see being discussed a lot at the minute is PVP. We know there are multiple problems:
---
&gt; - polling for pvp doesn't work well
---
&gt; - pvp isnt being served well, due to that, poor comms, etc.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Whilst we work on pvp polling... tell us what do you want fixed in PVP?

Ironmans 😂😂
---
Right. Head over back to 4chan. Your internet friends are waiting.
---
Lol 
---
Thats just muling with extra steps.
---
lmao 
---
Ok
---
$11
---
OP means desired. My rsn was Tracym which is currently banned. I however, am not. So, pray that they give me my rsn back and do not be so assumptive. 
---
The issue in DMM is that the solo experience is different than the clan experience. Some people want to play themselves as opposed to feeding a clan and hoping for a $20 cut
---
This is honestly really wholesome, I wish more people were inviting like you to the PKing world :D
---
Could get it through afk splashing for sure
---
lol- what does that mean?
---
I've seen farming was supposed to be good money but it's kinda daunting with all the different items and tools and seeds. Do you know of any guides?
---
Same for the birdhouses, I think they're on fossil island but I'm not sure how they make money.
---
I guess I'll start slayer tomorrow! I wanted to up my combat stats anyway. Thank you
---
You're reported.🤷‍♂️
---
&lt;3 
---
At this point, we need 3 factor authentication...
---
Inb4 jagex makes the xp terrible, the rewards shit, and wonders why it becomes dead content.
---
Not a fan of blackjacking myself, but neither are the thugs tbh.
---
Haha shit xD you're unlucky ^^'
---
They’ll fix pvp polling so that only pvpers can vote in them, but they still won’t hide poll results. Sounds like favoritism to me, but what’s the point in complaining about that? Joggleplex will never change.
---
Nice
---
i had to dig way too far for a comment about getting muted
---
you couldn’t say shit without getting muted back in the day
---
I know that I watched his video, I concur.
---
Are you cheesetoaste?
---
Congrats man! 
---
Half the entertainment if watching this salt train lmao.
---
Get mad, it wont change anything.
---
OP means overpowered, typically. “This gun is way OP. Plz nerf”
---
Or in Reddit context original poster. “OPs RSN was Tracy, but then got hacked.”
---
read down like 4 comments cmon man
---
I was told it would not be unless it is a technicality. Imo it is. I really think they need to work on improving the rs authenticator so it is needed to log in to the site too. I also am very glad they have the \*name reserve\* feature. I just found out about this when this mess happened to me. It needs to be changed though so the rsn does not disappear with 2 name changes :-( We have come a long way, but we need to bring security in OSRS to the now :-( 
---
safespot the zammy warriors, they are the best hands down
---
Op?
---
because I like to play many parts of the game that are literally useless on ezscape normie mode. I like to afk fish, woodcut, etc, why would I ever do that on a normie? Why would I ever do anything besides tob/cox repeatedly until max gear, then what do I do, get easy 99 buyables that literally do nothing for my account? Then what? Go for 200m all or do some from scratch challenge cuz there’s literally nothing to do but earn gp. Most ironmen have high level mains too and simply don’t play them anymore cuz it’s a trash game mode. You made this post to try and inflate your sensitive ego that feels inferior to ironmen. Yikes
---
Crab rave meme, saddly i doubt Jagex will respond to this :(
---
You gave me autism
---
r/natureismetal
---
oh no now it's going to get hacked
---
You never knew the pain. 
---
If it makes you feel any better, at least you can’t get mass reported and temp banned in OSRS for having a name someone else wants like you can be in WoW. I’ve been banned many times so someone can take my name.
---
Prior to stamina pots, the reward was nothing. With an update like this it would be 10-20mill. Makes no sense, to ruin the one this that made it better.
---
Agility already scales with your run energy.
---
What's so annoying about clicking a potion every 2 minutes? I agree some things are pretty annoying, but if clicking a potion is really that bad, we should just add a second spec bar that boosts all your stats for free. 
---
Go back to rs3 before your support ruins this game too 
---
I sure will, because by responding to it you’re giving me exactly what I want too. Thanks for all the upvotes guys!

I dont pvp, but i understand why they do it. If youre roaming deep wildy checking every hotspot, when you find someone would you be like nah, this guy doesnt seem to have more than x ammount of value. Of course they jump anything they see.
---
On the other side its really annoying because you gear up to only lose time pretty much. So its annoying to get pked for nothing, and losing out on all the time with regearing and a sudden end to your trip or what ever and increases your time grinding a boss by quiet a lot if it happends too often.
---
Its not that we dont expect pkers or know the risk. Its just annoying to die for nothing. You have nothing to offer, just wants the pet/unique from this monster and ur done meanwhile these people roll up on you seemingly only to ruin your experience. But its all fair game in the end

[Suggestion] new potion that makes u invincible from everything and new wep to 1 hit everything

Six toes on her left foot. Aside from that, this might as well be the Mona Lisa 
---
Who?
---
&lt;&lt;&lt; 15-yr vet. I would never compromise my account like that. I know all those tricks\~ No, I am positive. Someone is trying to tell me I have been spoofed. I believe they are going to pass this off on the runelite client. I pray I get my rsn back. The noob who stole it is banned- along with MY rsn. Ugh\~
---
But the fact is, 96-99 slayer is totally useless, where prayer and agility, however small, still has an effect past their final unlocks. 
---
He means the review, not the screen shot.
---
can they make a statue for me too, and then one for torvesta's haircut?
---
not sure if this is meant as as a /s post or not.
---
Like every other dragon. That’s all people do is safespot them or have their bots use crude melee. Dunno why you think it’s a terrible suggestion, it’s not like it’s zulrah or some shit
---
Eclectic imps sre a good way to make money, they just arent great xp. But really you just need to get by untill you can get combat level up to start doing some high level slayer for money. 
---
I love how wildly fluctuating the upvote/downvote ratio is
---
first of all, zulrah is a mid-tier boss which you can start doing fairly efficiently at 80 mage and range. meaning that it's quite accessible to a large base of the community
---
old zulrah drop table defined what it means by "devaluing skilling through pvm" through relatively common drops of resources like mahogany planks, magic logs, sharks; was even dubbed the "Grand Exchange for Ironmen" at some point.
---
more drama came as they nerfed the zul-andra tp scroll drop rate from 20 to 1, causing their prices to skyrocket - people who had taken a break from osrs and had stockpiled quite a number of teleports now had over 200m in their bank
---
they did eventually nerf the drop table, but not without ironmen complaining about being at a disadvantage to others who managed to farm the fuck out of snek pre-nerf
---
this is not to mention the blowpipe, one of the worst instances of power creep the game has seen. why use an acb, a karils xbow or an msb (i)? the blowpipe outclasses all these older weapons by a long shot, as well as being fairly affordable, thus deeply changing the ranged meta. it's been hard to design new ranged weapons since then. i guess we've got the t bow and dhcb, which are both quite up there in price and fairly situational in where they are used at.
---
haHAA
---
🦀 $11 🦀
---
We’ve all been there
---
See, that was what I read too. I am so confused at this point. I know my account was secure. I know people are getting targeted for their OP rsns. They are saying I was spoofed. I know I did not click on anything. I keep everything updated and secured. Whoever did this is dangerous... 
---
He was also a big fan of the pride event.
---
that sounds fucking horrible, clans could just troll solo pvpers  my piling them with mule like accounts while they get fcd by geared mages
---
Slayer is longer.
---
Congrats. Ive been trying to get that pet on my way to 99 by doing seaweed and hops. 
---
Yeah why does OP think he’s 14? He is nowhere close lmfao
---
I can explain it to your stupid fucking ass if you want. 
---
“Muling” is an enormous gray area. Alts are okay if they’re risking/playing the game. Okay. How do you define that. How much do you have to risk? How often? Jagex has zero guidelines whatsoever. 
---
Meanwhile we know what botting is. It’s botting. There is some gray area but only in clients and apk which is way further off
---
Moto g nibbas: flashlight turns on
---
Jagex support sucks stop wasting your time hoping it will change. 
---
Wait is your rsn "OP" or "tracy"
---
Let me guess, blowpipe/slayer?
---
Stfu
---
don't really get it this should be super easy to trace if there is any sort of auditing enabled in the game.
---
*farts on your post*
---
ISP is the least convincing piece of info.
---
Knowing just the paypal name isn't enough, they ask you for the item purchase number.
---
If people aren't using an anonymous email strictly for RS (something they sinks thousands of hours into) they're terrible at account security and are the type of brainlets to get hacked.
---
No, I wouldn't leak that info to anyone because I'm not a moron who leaks fucking credit card/paypal/email info. No one but me has business knowing that, that's how you keep secure, you don't take any chances. You actually have to be autistic to not keep those things secure. 
---
It's not banned, well, at least not permabanned. It's on the [hiscores](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/hiscorepersonal.ws) still.
---
Not really, but they could do more to help bridge the gap.
---
if it ain't slayer it ain't worth it.
---
Won't it be more appealing to them to resteal it now that they know it's worth 200 mil to u?
---
The reason why they don't give back names anymore was due to the massive amount of scamming going on with selling names, pretending they got hacked and then getting Jagex to give it back. I used to be in the name trading scene and was there when they stopped manually setting names back. My point is, you will never see that name again, even with the community behind you.
---
Only 1k more upvotes till customer support OP, almost there!
---
what do this mean? what does it mean to be spoofed?
---
I quit due to this. Why put all the time in of it can instantly be gone with 0 support.
---
&gt;bode
---
You had one fucking job.
---
&gt;I literally have explained above that people are upset that it is allowed
---
I not only understand that, I've said in 4 posts now that I *agree* with why you and other people are upset. My only point has been that no rules are being broken by clans, but rules were broken by torvesta. You can make up theoretical rules or explain that the same thing was accomplished, but by written rule and JMod decision, clans aren't breaking any rules by sharing wealth.
---
It's ironic that you claim I can't read while still ignoring the difference between friends/clan mates trading items and a single player abusing safe zones on an alt, but that's cool dude, keep pretending to be ignorant to that fact. :) 
---
Thanks boss
---
Imagine not being able to construct a counter-argument so you have to shitpost like a 30 IQ brainlet. 
---
You mean to tell me that there's more to the game than max-efficiency farming Zulrah and Vorkath?
---
fuck outta here
---
isn’t most of the player base part of that generation?
---
I am positive I dl ed the correct copy of runelite. That is what a person who I guess helps Jagex in osrs is telling me. I researched it. I am a 15-yr veteran of this game and am technologically sound. 
---
My pass on my rs acc is not used anywhere else and I have 2-step verification enabled on my emails. I can assure you that I took every security measure available to me.
---
I am very concerned that Jagex has been compromised in some way so these hackers can target people with rsns they can sell in some way. It is scary, but I have learned a lot today! :-( Someone said my rsn is for sell on scythe right now. Jagex support said that my rsn is banned- which means the noob who stole it is banned. The problem is, the noob does not care. He probably has 20 other accounts he keeps stolen names on until they can be sold. The only person here who is getting hurt, is me. I think the rs authenticator needs to be tweaked so it is needed when we log in on the site to our accounts. I also am glad they added the name reserve feature (just found out about this today), but I also believe it needs to be tweaked so that the scammers can not just change our name twice and our original rsn is released. It is very weak security.
---
You have to enter your bank pin to open up the name change menu though I do believe...so...
---
no u
---
Here's my reply before you deleted your idiotic post: 
---
&gt;I mean, imagine going out of your way to remember someone's paypal info, that's just autistic and fucking weird/sketchy to do. I'd go out of my way to not look at friend's personal info such as that, it's almost like staring at someone typing a password. 
---
But no, just don't show your paypal info and Hans to people you know who play RS lmao. Also, even those 3 things are not enough, you'd need to know previous passwords and a few other details.
---
DMM is just a cheap advertisement that is VERY EFFECTIVE that just so happens to be fun for some players. it isn't an esports, it won't be an esports, no one is trying to make it an esports. It's just a runescape event, and it excels damn well at being one. 
---
Lmao mental gymnastics much?
---
Thank you\~
---
yea it 100% sucks that I don't even care about the gp i lost but that my account is deemed useless almost
---
Then you of all people should understand. \~ :-(
---
osb is an ex botting client, no jmod made it
---
hearthstone, poker, pokemon, and Magic the Gathering would like a word with you. 
---
You can change name via the website, don’t even need 2FA to log in.
---
Haven't bought a bond off the GE, just curious as to why its 10% extra?
---
Are people still on this?...
---
Don't forget we pay them. This isn't a f2p. No customer support is ridiculous 
---
1k to go. Take my upvote stranger.
---
Anyone saying the bug was fixed and that you're fucked is retarded. Half of the pure bug was the fact that all attack styles reset to attack.
---
You should be able to go to the osrs website and there should be a devblog within the last few weeks that talks about pures getting unwanted exp. It will link to a forum post where you can submit information about the exp you gained and you'll be put in a line to get fixed. 
---
The deadline for submitting to get fixed is closing soon, so do it quickly 
---
I used to be in the Name trading scene and was there when they stopped giving back old display names. The reason they stopped was due to people trading names then flooding Jagex support with claims of getting hijacked and asking to get their names back. So Jagex stopped. It's sad when legit players lose their names, but rest assured, even with the community behind you, you will never get that display name back.
---
It's a java game from 2007, wtf are we meant to upload? A video of us fishing?
---
Best one yet, A+
---
found a clan memeber
---
Pretty sure that's something you're already born with 😒, this is boring. enjoy your trolling, clearly that's what gives you your sense of purpose
---
Most likely so people can't merch them
---
At 99 slayer you get the cape perk which is far more useful than agility or prayer. Prayer doesn't even give you an extra +1 from a pot from 96-99 and no one uses the cape. 
---
You have to be a literal brick in the head to think "this is fine" during a lure. People are so fucking greedy AND stupid.
---
I hardly go onto the website I didn't even think about that, lmao oops.
---
What if you die trying to pick then back up? Still there or gone?
---
just a bad meme
---
This has actually already happened.
---
Merchant is tactical gameplay however hiding all of your risk is against the spirit of the game. Don’t try to deny that. Player kills are so much less rewarding if mains have a large percentage of their wealth on a marching alt. I know others get away with it, but it doesn’t mean it’s a practice everyone should do.
---
How does Jagex have these issues after a game is 12 years old? Same thing happened to me, but instead my account was hacked, no name change. I have 2 step, email, changed my password all the time, and still got hacked. They basically told me there was no way that is possible and never responded again. I lost 2 bill and the will to play anymore. I sit and wait for the day they release the ability to revert your shit back to a day before. THEY COULD EASILY TRACK ALL THESE HACKERS AND SO ON, YET THEY FUCKING DON'T! They simply just don't. Good luck getting your name back. You won't though. This company is a fucking joke.
---
I agree. I have preached account security for years. That is why I am so angry this happened. I really do not see how runelite could be the culprit, but it really seems like they are pointing fingers to them. I know I dl ed the correct runelite. I am really just so angry. I just want my rsn back. I am glad they got nothing else- but yea, I seriously cried. I know that sounds silly coming from a grandma like me, but I have had this account for 15 years and my irl name since name release- that has been what...5 or 6 years now? Not sure lol. It is my name. It is banned right now and for sell on scythe someone said. This mess is just crazy!
---
thats not the bug.
---
the bug was that after selecting your style (outside of wildy) your style in the wildy was reverted. 
---
Its a sid idea atm. Final hour reverts players to normal players.
---
Grats
---
Swampletics? Settled's vids have been insanely popular and they're definitly game content.
---
No, I don't understand because I've kept my account secure and in turn didn't get hacked. If I had gotten hacked in the past decade with actual proper security then I'd believe it wasn't your fault.
---
There's a 0.1% chance it's not your fault (very rarely is it actually Jagex) which is why I'm more inclined to think that it is.
---
seriously, all it takes is thinking about it logically and you can see this is a terrible idea that fixes non of the current problems
---
im guessing its a joke, because he even took it a step further and said uim instead of regular iron?
---
Gz, i'm 98 and no pet yet 
---
I put a "/s" on the next line. 
---
Just make everyone ironmen... except now if you get a kill you can’t pick it up... -SO THEN JUST MAKE IT ABLE TO PICK UP.... except if you do that, u can just “fight” a clan member and funnel gold to one account.
---
Lol- not going to comment on that one. I guess, keep it under your hat\~ 
---
How do you reserve names? I thought they stopped doing this in like 2010.
---
well they let solo mission do the quest as evident by his last vid
---
Maybe I'm just annoyed easily because the only reason people are whining so much about dmm being sooooooooooo brooooooooken is cause torvesta got DQ'd...
---
I am not stupid. I had every security measure possible. This mess is very scary\~
---
I don't need to argue with a bitter assclown unironically saying things like "30 IQ brainlet".  You're being a pathetic cunt, so I called you a pathetic cunt.
---
You do you though 
---
So castle wars with a shayzien skin?
---
I think we have enough copycat content on zeah.
---
Why did you bring it into the wildy?
---
Sure, merching is useful, and being able to level and trade at the same time is great. It doesn’t change the fact his wealth is hidden from other players for the entire time. This is the part that is unfair, and why it should not be allowed in the game imo 
---
???? What
---
too bad jagex support is literally a bot. 
---
Oooooooooooo
---
You realize #2 can literally happen in any fucking online game ever, right? Yet they don't have rampant hacking issues like OSRS does because they have actual security features and a real customer support team?
---
Didn't Ashs wife or something get hacked awhile back and the dude showed it off on Twitter? Sorry I don't remember the exact details... 
---
Thanks! Good luck with the quest grind 
---
Fastest method for your level, which will be expensive and click intensive, is cannoning dagganoths in the lighthouse after that quest, I forget which one tbh lol, something below or some shit, anyway, gotta keep refilling cannon, bring ranged gear, pray melee, and bring p pots and food and if ur low level ull need to bank for food as they use ranged and melee.
---
Tbh, I could clear 200k range xp n hour going hard there, would probably cost like 3-4k cannonballs an hour easily. 
---
What's your new goal? 
---
Is toadflax a good herb to farm for both profit/xp right now?
---
stereotype bingo cards thats gonna be a yikes from me dawg.
---
Then it is the real runelite, and I honestly do not see how that is possible. However, I am not a hacker. Basically they are saying I got spoofed. I still think it is coming from Jagex end, not mine. People with rsns like mine are being targeted. Hackers will find a way to make their money. Something is wrong somewhere. 
---
pretty sure this is a troll acount, look at the reddit name
---
And you're being a retarded 5 year old who can't argue with someone who clearly has more knowledge than him on the subject and has to resort to shitposting. This subreddit is getting spammed with customer support bullshit posts daily, I'll respond with facts, your literal irrelevant opinion and shitposts aren't needed, thanks.
---
This post reeks of phishing. It sounds like you downloaded a false version of Runelite from your other comments. 
---
It's just the truth. It's usually one of those two things that cause people to get hacked...but you're also right, Jagex doesn't have appropriate security measures in place to stop it from being so easy.
---
this happened to me before i watched porn :(
---
p.s.: happy cake day!
---
You should delete your comment now
---
To the top!
---
I very much agree with you. I can assure you that I am that 1/1000. Thanks for your support!
---
Oof
---
bitch ass
---
Got QPC today, does that mean I'm not a bitch or a bitch until the next quest comes out? 
---
Me too...it is definitely a struggle. Almost time for me to go to sleep though. I am trying to keep up with everyone's questions. I hope that helps too! Definitely appreciate the support!!
---
The thread is gone, I went to the tweet and the QF code doesn't work anymore :(
---
Unique names arent op tho they are og. We are aware of what op means in the context of a video game and this aint it
---
Wtf are yku doing he's scamming you
---
/r/iamverysmart

Yeah. Give us that link so we can try it out.

like 2-3 weeks the clue scrolls slowed me down also got masters from some elites, was just chilling streaming it and stuff. Next is 15k eclectic implings maybe 20k no idea. 
---
That is a good suggestion :-)
---
jeepers creepers stole her peepers
---
Holy fuck lol
---
No it can't happen if you have a unique email that you only use for RS and nothing else and if you're careful with your personal/account information.......... And hacking in this game is much more prevalent because of the real world value RSGP holds. RS account are some of the most valuable gaming accounts which is why the Twitch section is plagued with phishing emails unlike any other game. 
---
There's a reason people who play for 10+ years never get hacked.
---
This mans gets it
---
IMAGINE USING A MAC LOOOOOL
---
ima go edit my woodcutting montage for ya and post it here, we need more real gameplay content
---
Thanks\~ It was cool of you to pop in and show your support\~
---
Maybe someone can help me with this then. I had some dude PM me saying that I took his RSN. I dont remember if i had it from the start or did a name change once to it but i thought he was scamming me. I told him theres no way the name can be his because I put it on my account without any problems. He said that it was an idle account that hadn't been logged in in quite some time so we figured maybe jagex just released names after some time? He said once he logged into the acc it asked him to make a new rsn so idk. Any info would be great for my peace of mind and for this other guys as well.
---
td;lr people are angry about a lot of things and the crab meme hit this place like a storm the same way those things are getting memed to death.
---
You could say they are crabby.
---
lol
---
Just secure your account damn
---
shouldnt of been banned in the first fucking place, its not his fault jagex made safe zones actual fucking safe zones. Bring pvp back everywhere and u wont have lvl 3 ge flippers anymore
---
Who are you again? Oh, the guy who got BTFO
---
The Dutch and their forwardness. I like it. 
---
literally the only thing about rs3 that preserves the charm
---
nice switch
---
Ah fuck you got me
---
Was your account secure? This is some scary stuff. Mine was as secure as it gets and then this happens and I am like..wow!
---
I'm glad I stopped playing on my 3 accounts. Even when I played the final year I only bought membership through bonds to not fund this shit show. Greedy greedy company who doesn't care about their player base but rather feign their sympathy and help .1% of people who need support.
---
A lot of people get hacked not because they are computer illiterate but because of unrelated data breaches that have not gone public yet - so even if your password in OSRS is unique they can change it from a hacked email.
---
Counter argued every single point to idiots who don't know jack shit about account security and you're saying BTFO because you disagree with me and hate that I'm right lmao. Grow up kid.
---
Would be neat to have seeing anyone can change your RSN providing they have your login and password. Some of the OG RSNs go for hundred of millions or even a billion+ on THAT site. Kinda wish there were limits on name change, always found people who change name often annoying + it encourages scamming.
---
oh god, i went thru my mute history from 2006-2008, and it was so fucking funny
---
the one i got muted for tellin someone to suck my ballz and that theyre a masterb8r.
---
any type of trying to get around the censor was hit with an instant mute. then you had to play with that quickchat shit(atleast after awhile u did, not sure when it was added, but i def had some mutes with it and somewithout it.)
---
If we remove the stats on it entirely, same for drag harpoon, i dont see it being game breaking.
---
Otherwise 61 WC becomes meta for obby pures
---
Yeah fully secure

I understand many other things are happening, but I was hoping this would've come out with the other post-kebos patches/updates.
---
I am sorry you lost all your stuff. They said it is too hard to do rollbacks. I know nothing about what they might have to do to enforce that. I am glad you are able to rebuild and you got your rsn back :-) Mine means so much for me :-( They banned the noob who took it along with my RSN. Hopefully it is not gone forever now :/

I'm simply waiting for someone to take legal action against the players in question. I know there have been cases in the past in some countries where this actually happened with people who were scammed and the courts awarded the victim. I won't be surprised if eventually someone takes that same route to take action against the offenders ruining the game in its entirety for DMM and other aspects.
---
Oh by the way quick sell out, I stream stupid pointless grinds at  [https://www.twitch.tv/aradazs](https://www.twitch.tv/aradazs) . 15k or 20k ecletic grind for meduims and masters next, drop a follow if you wana watch scuffed streamer.
---
Yeah fully secure told them it was stolen and they said they can’t give it back to me 
---
M8 they just announced today it’s coming tomorrow
---
Hmm, I guess I read that wrong about osb. I always used the runescape client anyway. They have made a lot of changes to it and I really like it. I do not mind looking up coordinates and stuff for clues, except when I am in wildy lol. Anyway, a player told me to install runelite when I was looking for books in Kourend. I logged out and researched it. I know I dl ed the proper one. My security measures are in place, and this happens. I do not see how runelite has anything to do with it and I know it is not coming from my side, so I am very confused. 
---
Super dismissive. Its a solid idea. 
---
Sadly I'm in a similar situation - My name was removed 3 months ago and all I want to know is what was so offensive that led to that action, but for 3 months the only responses I receive are either silence or "Your name was removed, you'll have to choose a new one". I thought things would be looking up once they said they're dedicated to improving their customer support, but the support ticket I submitted a week ago still doesn't have a reply. If I hadn't bought Gold Premiere Club a few weeks before it happened, I probably wouldn't still be playing right now after the treatment I've received from Jagex and it's sad because I know it's losing them a lot of players. You're blissfully unaware of how terrible their systems are until something happens and suddenly you're up shit creek and nobody wants to come help you because of the stench

the easiest money maker in f2p is ogress warriors in corsair cove dungeon. there's safespots at most of their spawns, and they drop alchables/runes pretty commonly. id say i earned 70k/hr there when i was grinding for my first bond and that was with ~50 range using iron arrows and no alchs(so add bank time). with 71 range and alchs you should be able to earn way more than that easily with some decent rng
---
Explain. I will tear down everything you say.
---
Duradel is chill, Konar every 10th task. 
---
Youll make way more doing Barrows, Zulrah soon, or Vorkath after DS2 then you would doing Slayer trying to afford Chinning/bursting to 90. 
---
Is there like a vid of that arm twisting
---
U didnt do digging i posted this an hour ago idiot 
---
I did fire giants because you can safespot them easily and get to them fast.
---
this literally kills dmm unless you still get items from pking players, then it fixes absolutely nothing.
---
a big part of dmm is the economy and grinding balance
---
one of the big problems is that pure clans have tons of players not competing and grinding/flipping to give one player an advantage. you'd have to literally make it so that you get 0 items from killing someone, which just doesnt work in this pvp gamemode.
---
i have yet to see a valid argument for it, but im always game to see one.

No idea, but a lot of people are saying my rsn and OP rsns like mine are being targeted by these farmers. Someone told me my rsn is for sale right now on scythe. Also, Jagex support said it is banned. Sad thing is- I hope this does not mean my irl name and MY rsn are lost forever...
---
i'd be exited if TORVESTA WASN'T BANNED
---
Hearthstone isn't based on luck?

??
---
that just brought the regular players in on the situation, any semi-serious dmm player/watcher has been complaining about the clan situation since season 1.
---
its just its at the front page of the subreddit rn, thats the only difference.
---
It's not but ok. 
---
Thanks for answering that for me. I am trying to respond to everyone\~
---
Lmao you can suck me but I laughed so have an upvote 
---
Maybe just maybe, the person who hacked it is trying to sell the name, or does that seem impossible to you?
---
It's on the ground for 1 hr unless you drop it from your inventory for untradeables below 20 wilderness. No matter how many times you die.

Abyss crafting only risks a glory. Anyways barely anybody pks abyss crafters since it's almost always a net loss. Watch a guide on youtube
---
You sure the acc got banned and they didnt just move the name to a different account?
---
so that's why rev caves were so empty last night
---
yeah im not sure, runelite is safe for the most part. unless there was a runelite leak?
---
where'd you go for the runelite dl link?
---
Still there for the remaining hour. A pker would have to camp your grave for an hour to stop you getting it, and as long as you have high-healing food like brews or sharks in your bank and protection spells, you're guaranteed to get the set back. 
---
&gt;"You're a pathetic cunt because ~~I don't like that you're right and speaking facts about spam customer support posts REEEEEE~~ you've spent the last hour of your life being a pathetic cunt to anyone who calls out your pathetic cunt attitude

Ftfy. but you're right though, you're definitely not smart lol.  Have a good one though bro, I hope one day you can stop being such a cunt, because until Jagex gets customer support you're gonna keep seeing these posts.

I’ve been using my osrs account since the start of osrs. Never had a problem with he security. All my shit has two step authentication. 
---
I just do not want to believe that it is the culprit. I researched it thoroughly. Surely if there was an issue like this, people would be talking about it. Another person in here said they saw nothing in their forums about this. 
---
Very much appreciated!
---
how does the no trading even work?
---
this means you dont get pk drops? which means theres 0 benefit for killing others
---
you just effectively turned dmm from a pvp torny into a grinding torny
---
Nah, if that was the case then Jagex could see that the account has changed names before &gt; making her whole claim invalid. 
---
Hmm... I wish they would somehow beef up security more :-/
---
Because on a main I'd rather just farm zulrah for easy money. I have a fixation on gear. So I go for the fastest method. That's zulrah or vork or the duel arena.
---
On an ironman I've found parts of the game I find fun but wouldn't have done on my main. My total level is higher and I've experience more the game has to offer.
---
Certain grinds are harder sure, but I dont do anything I dont want to.
---
My herblore is decent and my farming is low. Sue me I hate farming. Iron or not.
---
I don't know alot about hearthstone, but it's still a card game
---
and if it's not and it's fully based on luck somehow, that doesn't make RS an e-sport...just makes them both not.  
---

---
Just saw a post about once your account has been recovered once it’s a dead account because it can be stolen again easily essentially why I’m thinking bout stopping a game I love.
---
The basis of what your saying one of the most paraphrased statements in history. Look up a plethora of historical figures touting the same.
---
Socrates ~400BC
---
&gt;The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.
---
Peter the Hermit ~1700AD
---
&gt;The world is passing through troubling times. The young people of today think of nothing but themselves. They have no reverence for parents or old age. They are impatient of all restraint. They talk as if they knew everything, and what passes for wisdom with us is foolishness with them. As for the girls, they are forward, immodest and unladylike in speech, behavior and dress.

hey at least u tried

It's a good introduction for noob pkers before they get more confident with real pking.
---
Also most of them are bots and its fun, and you can occasionally get som1 doing wildy slayer downstairs too.
---
I completely agree. I know a lot of people spanning my 15-year time off an on on rs that have lost their accounts from clicking on stupid stuff and putting crap on their computers. I am very sure it is not from my end. I just do not understand how it can be from runelite like they are inferring.

I get that but I look at OSRS as a split from the timeline. Nex is too far past that split where it starts to blur the line with RS3. Didn't curses come out around the same time? I think all of that stuff really changes the unique identity that OSRS has built for itself by shifting it back in the direction of RS3, while instead they could be creating unique content like Raids, slayer bosses and etc. Cool art though.
---
Please. Only reason I came back after eoc. And maybe devs can try to make it successful this time...

ohh ok, that makes sense

I would not have let it go :-( I am sorry this happened to you\~

I dunno who runs it now, but the former Jmod who was known for being a former botmaker (Jacmob) was the one who created rsbuddy, which if I'm remembering correctly is where OSbuddy comes from

When you put in hundreds of hours of time for it all to be taken in a matter of minutes, would you really want to do it again? Especially if you knew there's really no way to 100% prevent it from happening again? It's not that regaining a large bank is impossible, but for most the time investment can't be justified again.
---
no, this is exactly how u transfer names from accounts you own.

&gt;Still pretty new to p2p, and thus I'm not sure on lots of things.
---
Ah the fun part where you get to explore the game. Embrace not knowing anything and finding it out. OSRS isn't a game you need to suddenly learn all at once.
---
Regarding your stats, to be honest they are all a little low to be PVM-ing or killing monsters for drops/cash.  You'll want to prioritise getting 43 prayer which unlocks protection prayers which will make your life much easier with bosses / tasks.
---
You could try [Salarin the Twisted](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Salarin_the_twisted)? Hill Giants for a chance to take on Obor? Ankous have decent drops in Stronghold of Security. Most of Katacombs of Kourend have tons of good monsters too.
---
While you have noted you're tired of slayer, I actually think this might be the solution. Most of the mid+ monsters have decent drop tables for early to mid game players. Which master are you using? It might be time to go to a harder one.

Rules made in response to things you don't like are fine.  Punishing someone for them is stupid.

Just one less reason to keep me playing. Even though it has gotten a lot better since I stopped playing like ‘10 it’s still something I only want to play in passing.

---
I think some people here are confused about what you’re saying... basically what I got from this is:
---
A hacker logged into your account and changed YOUR RSN from Tracy and changed the RSN on THEIR 1 def pure to Tracy?
---
However, your account was not recovered because the 2 factor authenticator was not removed and your login details remained the same. Am I getting this right? Nothing else was done to your account apart from the name change?
---
Your story isn’t adding up. Sounds like you got scammed into changing your name and now you’re crying for customer support because you thought you could reserve the name Tracy but in reality you got tricked and fucked up. 
---
 
---
Rigour is very big
---
The hacker could be selling it tbh 
---
Bahahahahhaha eat shit kid.  Serves you right.  Just so everyone knows, this asshole tried to wipe my cc's discord a few weeks ago.  Nice name.
---
Yeah mostly doing barrows for cash (mainly because I enjoy it) when I can play on the PC and doing a bit of flipping otherwise, so you reckon stick with this until I can afford the 90 range/mage before getting stuck into slayer?
---
Probably because it has been around almost as long as Runescape and was a popular account/gold selling website. It’s also an item in game. 
---
That is pretty funny tbh...
---
I don't get how you can say there is a small difference.
---
He was holding wealth on an account that was only in a safezone. Regardless of if he was intending to flip or purchase items, it had the effect of muling for his main.
---
or benefit of the doubt, the name was stolen, put on an account for holding and is now being sold.
---
Pretty sure they'd prioritize protecting names over people selling/transferring names. Although could also have the delay be toggleable so that you can turn it off for when you do wanna transfer names
---
Go to account recovery suppory page.. gl.

a whole match can be decided 100% on luck.
---
 extreme example:
---
if your opponent in poker is down to just the ante, and you draw a royal flush on the first 3 cards, what can your opponent do to win? You haven't been able to influence anything yet and you already lost. It wouldn't matter if I was in your position or a pro poker player was, the opponent is winning no matter what. please tell me how that is skill based. Poker is luck based where you're skill can influence the outcome of the game. Key word "can." Basketball is a game where I have total control of the fucking game. I can put the ball in the basket or block my opponent. There is nothing in the game that is random.

I have no problem using data for osrs but i would like to use wifi to watch youtube or netflix while im fishing or doing something afk. Is there any way to get it to work on the wifi, or if not, any way to keep wifi on but make osrs run off data?

---
Female? Scaper? Not Emily? 
---
Hit up MMK, he needs some diversity.
---
I'm not saying it's not a big deal, but one is against the rules and one isn't, because one is muling and the other is just trading. Trading isn't against the rules; muling is.
---
The people selling their whole bank for one item and then giving it to another player aren't muling because they're not doing that to keep their items safe. They aren't using another account for storage of THEIR items, they're trading those items to someone else.
---
You develop a deck with the probability bot a card being drawn as a major consideration. I would assume that the same applies for RS mechanics but I’m just a casual player and haven’t had much experience in pvp/pvm.

no you misunderstand, most people want to hold onto the name across multiple accounts.

like ive had the name rsn for a long time now, but ive had multiple accounts(1 for rs2 1 for osrs release etc)

Just an fyi training ranged in nmz isn’t that much less xp/hr than chinning until you get to about 90 ranged. So unless you have a ton of money chinning may not be worth it to you

I've been playing BA for many years and far from suck. Attackers with low melee stats are a drag on the team and those with low def require significantly more healing.  Those with low def and hp are even worse. If you add weak def armor to the mix it compounds the issue.
---
i love this so much!

Lmao

If you has a DFS I'd say abby dagger. Without DFS I'd say rune crossbow

theres literally no such thing as outrage culture;

I've been using the guy beside moss giants in the caves. Apparently he's good but I spent four hours in the lumbridge dark caves today I'd had enough. Think name is Vanak or something. The list of what he gives looked fun, giants, dragons, things that aren't boring. But I've gotten nothing but low level slimes/bugs/etc.   
---
Ended up walking all the way from Camelot to the relleka dungeon to do the most recent slayer bugs cuz I didn't want to sit in the dark anymore.

I wanna go to the next one but the wiki says combat 70, and I'm only 63 :(

I've killed obor, was pretty intense without overheads haha. Definitely am trying to level prayer up. Slow grind but it's getting there :D

Ankous were good I thought till ogress came out. I'm at ogress now and [this is the kind of stuff they drop](https://i.imgur.com/Kpec0Ju.png). It isn't paying for a bond anytime soon but it's *something* to high alch. Was just wondering if there was something *like this* that I could be on or not hehe.      
---
Really slayer was going great til I had to go into the dark, over and over. 
---
Alright this applies for games like hearthstone.
---
But also the "probability" is just luck, you're just giving yourself more of a chance to get lucky, at the end of the day it's still luck.  
---
How is playing poker not luck based, sure you can argue if you pull a good "poker face" that you can win more often, but the cards you draw are completely luck based, without hiding behind social engineering you can't say it's not luck.
---
I've already tried everything on the support page. I even recovered the account. The only way I'll be able to disable authenticator is if I have access to the gmail account I made the OSRS account under. I didn't have to worry about logging into the email because before my phone broke I could just get on the authenticator app and the 6 digit pin would pop up. well since I got a new phone nothing is showing up, so I have to login to my gmail account and set up the authenticator again and I can't do that because I don't have access to it. 
---
nope just my maxed 60 attack pure, wbu
---
Unfortunately, authenticator does nothing to stop someone from stealing your RSN. The website doesn't have the same security features that the game has. A hacker only needs to know your password in order to change your display name through the website.
---
As someone with a short, single word username I wish the website could have extra security for changing display names. Authenticator or email confirmation would be ideal.

Q

By far
---
Protip: spend less time on the subreddit. Reading about other people's complaints 24/7 does not make the game more enjoyable.

I did like 630. Missed ahrim hood,bottoms, torag legs and hammers and verac helm. Never going back.

They push updates using git. Stuff like that can't just slip through since you see all the files and code getting added. Very easy to spot anything that isn't supposed to be added.

I'd just grind/use elite void. Will be worth it in the long run - doubt you'll notice any significant DPS increase w/ dhide.

Search optimal quest guide on google. Also do achievment diaries
---
What? That seems like a pretty massive generalization.  “Outrage culture” isn’t even specifically about racism. It has to do with people consistently searching for reasons to be offended over a myriad of subjects and it’s certainly very widespread now because of the internet and social media. It’s always been a thing it’s just much more pronounced now because people are constantly in contact with each other (lots of times anonymously) through the internet.

Why do people think having a “RARE” name is cool? Lmao make a funny name and move the fuck on.

&gt;You develop a deck with the probability that a card being drawn as a major consideration. 
---
So the gameplan is based on chance. aka what people refer to as luck. 
---
Though yes, RS is the same. You do your best to always get the best chances and minimize the good chances your opponent has. 
---
This sub already does that bwana.

Try it

sure, doesnt make me want to spend time ever doing it though.

No lol

Ur behind the scenes too. It's all connected bro

and the gear that you got was from you or you and your friends/clan pooling your gear to one guy

I love how he stopped for a second lol 
---
It's pretty niche since it's only worth its salt at dragons, certain bosses, and when running a tanky mage/range build like at Barrows or DKs
---
Yeah, this isn’t proof you moron. The hacker could have easily posted the sale. 
---
thanks
---
gonna be getting rigour first then
---
Dang, maybe once I get a little more rich I may invest in one and see if it improves my kills per trip. Thanks for your advice mate, cheers!

Awks, my friend got caught smithing with ghostmouse... yet i used it to clean about 800k herbs... I cleaned about 1k herbs  every 10mins or so
---
That's why you bring in 50 other people to fight them. Or are you seriously suggesting that a single person should be able to take on everyone else in a multi PVP zone? If that's your rub, go play Last Man Standing instead.
---
You can't take out someone in a safe zone even if you had 50 other people with you.
---
And guess what? It's a good lesson for how things work in the real world as well. A single entrepreneur can rarely take on a massive corporation and usually has to raise money from investors and hire partners and employees to help out. That's the power behind teamwork and collaboration. If you don't have those skills, don't bitch about those other groups that have them and know how to make it work.
---
It's literally posted fucking today. GTFO lmao.

I learned what the N word was because of this game when I was 11.

Guys my account zezima was stolen by an internet hacker jmods plz help 
---
For me it was using wifi at my girlfriend's restaurant. It had a password, but was public enough that datasniffers caught it and planted rootkitted malware on my laptop through the unsecured connection. I have all security measures and it still happened. Now I use a VPN so that can't happen again.
---
Sadly doesn't work like that. Boosting levels never lets you equip gear outside of your level range, only do actions outside of it 
---
See? This guy gets it.
---
If it's been recovered once it can always be recovered for the rest of the accounts life.
---
You'd never feel or be secure. 
---
The game was more mature back in 2005 because JamFlex would ban you at the drop of a hat. When I was 12 or so I got permanently muted for saying that I wanted to have sex with Pikachu while fishing in Catherby. Nowadays JaGex just has given up on moderating language once they realized their whole userbase are full of 20ish/30ish autists who have never matured.
---
i had no idea this was a thing, just logged into my account without using caps in the password when there are meant to be... this is really messed up
---
lol are you shitting me it was a trillion times worse back then
---
clans rarely risk anything when fighting individual players
---
clans risk everything when fighting another clan to the death
---
strength in numbers will always beat individual players, that's how it works in normal non-DMM PvP as well

The majority of reddit is EXTREMELY toxic and for some reason people seem to ignore that fact. Certainly most of us are guilty of being assholes online.

Even on task, void is better than slayer helm at Vork, so there's that. It's also useful if you don't have max gear for raids one, and can help with learning Zulrah if you're not super confident with switches.

I enjoy the community a lot tbh
---
You only need someone's password to steal their username because the website doesn't have any extra security. 
---
Even if your account had authenticator, pin, 2-step email... it wouldn't do anything to stop the hacker.
---
They *write source code* via git but that doesn’t mean that releases (compiled Java) is necessarily derived from the source. An attacker could upload their own executable with a backdoor. If the devs were malicious they could even upload it to GitHub.
---
If you want to be absolutely certain the client has no malware, you have to clone the repo, inspect the code, and build it yourself.
---
I never said my actions were a community issue. I was acting like the big fish in a little pond and it went to my head. I'm not sure if I'm going back because although I liked the danger, it was being the big fish that I really enjoyed. I like the wildy and like how dangerous it is but that doesn't mean I should seek pleasure from hurting others (calling people names or camping them, not killing them which is fair game and what makes the wildy fun).
---
I do have teleblock so I'll give that a try. Dragons weren't bad for tele's because they'd run south and de-aggro the dragon they were fighting, giving me an opening to teleblock. I also liked how I could seed pod away if a fight with another PvPer went poorly.
---
So for those phishing streams on twitch, is it enough to just open a stream for my account to be at risk?  Or would i need to click some kind of link?

seriously, he uploaded video evidence of himself transferring money to his GE safezone mule and himself later dying on the main account, without that money lost

and people just expect jagex to look the other way when the evidence is so blatantly clear and out there

Sure, clans v clans is absolutely fair. I think clans playing DMM have a valid style of gameplay, just that it’s unreasonable to be able to expect solo players to compete with clans when solo players have more actual restrictions applied to them. Yes the rules are the same for everyone but enforcement is arbitrary and loopholes are left open so what the rules say on paper ultimately means jack shit.
---
All I want to see is clans and solo players segregated into different modes of DMM so that clans can only fight with clans. The only people who would argue against this are clan members who just want easy wins because they know they couldn’t compete solo.

Posts like this make me scared about RuneLite. The one and only time I got hacked in ~13 years of playing was within 24 hours of downloading OSBuddy. At the time everyone was certain it was safe. Like someone else in this thread mentioned, all it would take is hacking a few lucrative accounts to stay under the radar.
---
Jagex needs to update their security. It’s absolutely ludicrous that a game players pour hundreds/thousands of hours into has such a huge problem with hacking. The day I get hacked again is the day I quit runescape and never look back.

 Sure there are some great aspects about it and I'm not saying do away with it. That'd support gold sellers too much.

Torvesta should've been smarter about it and use the legal methods like soliciting DMM donations instead

why would they post to reddit claiming the name was stolen if they haven't managed to sell the name yet? If Jagex took action ASAP (which never happens sure, but what if) then they'd risk the name without potentially selling it first.

Reddit won't function as a website without making an Article 13 non-compliant section for the rest of the world. They'd actually lose the site as competitors in North American, Australian, and other markets ate their shares there if they just banned 99% of posts

Loading the stream doesn't hurt you. They generally have links below the stream that trick you into entering your account info on a page designed to look like an official Runescape site.

How much was the most you've lost for checking the margin of an item on GE?

My cash stack isn't big, so sometimes I don't dare to margin check on most items. But if I don't margin check those items and stick to shitty items, shit margins. I'm stuck in flipping hell. I need gp
---
Can’t believe so many people are taking this bait 
---
&gt;What do you want, Jagex to put out a list of all the people that they ban?
---
I wouldn't mind a Wall Of Shame tbh. Just in general, not even only for DMM. It could just be a long list of names in a giant thread on the forum, or a Twitter bot that shouts out the names just like that one HCIM Death Bot and i would be satisfied. 
---
Apparently in DMMT they don't lose XP
---
Do you have link to the numbers that DMM tourney brings in? I’ve always been curious 
---
&gt; All I want to see is clans and solo players segregated
---
solo players can go play Last Man Standing or Edgeville 1v1
---
DMM isn't meant to be content catered towards solo players anyways, it's an open world PvP concept that reflects a truth from the real world: teamwork and strength and numbers will beat individuals going it alone almost all the time

These people arent horrific racists. theyre just searching for attention with shock humor. Im a hispanic man, when i was in HS i used to do the same shit. Yes it was immature. But im not nor have i ever been a racist. Its immaturity at best.

are bastion pots worth at vork? Also what about manta rays? I am pretty sure I could stay for 4 kill trips confidently if I switch out 1 food for an extra pray pot and take manta rays. With just 2 pray pots and sharks I could OCCASIONALLY stay for 4 kills depending on the blue ball rng, but i’ve really been improving my efficiency and I take minimal damage that can be avoided.

I get 3 kills trips no matter what with the current setup, it’s just rng if I can stay for 4

I agree with you with the wage slaves but being younger had much more free time. I remember fishing lobsters for like 9 hours straight one Saturday in catherby, and I also remember being f2p and mining rune essance and making my first 10k lol ahhh the young days. I feel as if the game was more fun to me when I was younger than it is now, but it's more relaxing now than when I was younger i guess.
---
And the reason people do it so much is for the "outrage culture" reaction. If no one reacted triggered they wouldnt do it

yes i would be so happy to meet him and personally thank him and im sure everyone who uses his videos would to. im really impressed at how smoothly his quest guides go despite the small hiccups here and there, because with a quest you only get 1 shot at making the guide start to finish the way he does, otherwise he would have to make a new account and start over (which he is doing!) the man is a legend. he will go down in rs history as a great content creator.

Day 1 it's about 1:20 (20m osrs gets you 1m sdmm) but then it drops as the season progresses, as fewer players partake and the servers gets closer to being deleted

---
At the end of the day either the hacker loses nothing or gains money. There is no losing scenario for the hacker and many winning scenarios unless hacker is a retard too. Hacker either gets money and/or loses a level 3 acc. 
---
Banning him is a step in the right direction rather than something to be mad about. And many people have been banned for muling recently not just Torvesta.
---
No you're right, nearly no skill has the same META that it does now as there was back then and there's a lot more training methods and discoveries/information. 
---
This version of runescape has insane skill gains comparatively.
---
Unless they spoofed the sender, that is a legitimate runescape email address. (See https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/205846842-Not-receiving-emails)
---
It could be that you had an alt that you stopped caring about that still uses your old email address as the contact. I got confused by a very similar situation until I realized that it was actually for some level 3 alt I used ages ago that I had a really shitty password.
---
It's a pretty grey area. How soon after starting do you need to start doing content for it to not be considered muling? I dunno.
---
My mom's name is Tracy should I buy it for her
---
im starting agility from level 3 so i wont have access to kand hard, do i still do seers until ardy? 
---
Sad
---
I agree to part of the general point you're making: Torv was definitely muling in the sense that he was transferring wealth he made on his main and ergo was no longer risking it because his alt just sat in safe zones. Whether you call it flipping or whatever, the bottom line is that it's still protected cash that he isn't risking, which is obviously against the high-risk nature of dmm.
---
That being said, I think what draws in the anger/confusion is that Torv asked a jmod if the way he was using his account was bannable. By telling him that it wasn't (either bc of youtuber favoritism or because they're clueless/change their mind), it really makes the definition of things such as muling/swapping more murky, so there's no clear ruleset. That's a huge point of frustration for obvious reasons. 
---
You say like they can't bot on other accounts while playing on their main. The whole point of botting is you can do other things while it's going.
---
You're delusional if you think fucking runescape has more luck than poker lmao. What are you even trying to argue? If runescape is "based on RNG because you can be amazing, do everything right and still get dominated cause you're hitting 30+ 0s" Then poker is "based on RNG because you can play amazing, do everything right and still get dominated cause you're card dead." 
---
In the Q+A, Jagex said Torvesta's alt did absolutely zero content of any kind (quests, skilling, etc.) and just sat in the safe zone for 100% of its time in game.

Underated comment
---
They do it like that so Jagex can't just write a script that automatically bans all usernames up for trade when they shift IP's
---
Something like "** = a common acronym for compact disc" means they're selling the account with the name CD, you and I can determine that easily, but there's no way a bot can learn to decrypt this for every possible definition, and Jagex isn't gonna spend all day looking at people with "rare account names".
---
I believe 1v1 was only added in the last few tourneys, to slow down the pace of the final fights so jagex could have the casters commentate each fight
---
final 1v1's are still mostly full of FOOLs and other clan members anyways, just fighting among themselves

Thats always been sketchy, I'm not sure if its still a thing but back during RS2 days when rare names were traded/sold, there used to be bots and scripts that would run 24/7 to snipe names if they were changed. This might be what happened to you.

I had ”Xws” as rsn since i started osrs in 03, got stolen a year back and the account that has it is banned.  Sucks when ive had this name in literally all forums ive used for 16 years.

Real talk, if you have 85 magic you can farm these bots like crazy. They are mostly in the 60-90 combat range in level 20 wildy. Once you TB, they don't know what to do so they don't run south. Free kills. You can fill up an entire looting bag + inventory of d'hides and bones in about 5 minutes give or take, usually amounting to between 40k-60k.
---
If you don't have TB, it gets harder. You need to pray that your dragonstone (e) bolts can hit big on the bots, as you usually can get off 3-6 hits before they tele. 
---
Either way makes for fun easy PKing. 
---
The difference between caps and no caps is negligible to a brute forcing program. If you really want to make a brute force program fail make a long password. Each extra character makes it magnitudes more difficult whereas caps only makes it take a little longer. 
---
You don’t need to skill much. To unlock almost all the content in the game would only take about 50 hours of questing, and 50 hours of skilling. With that 100 hour time commitment (less than the time to get one melee 99) you could easily have all your non combat stats in the mid 60s or 70s, which is all you really need for quests and bosses. The only reason you would have to start doing some serious skilling is if you’re going to complete elite diaries, and those just speed up or extend boss trips at best.

Playing ironman there's always a new goal to work towards. I haven't felt like I didn't know what to do since the early game and it's really fun
---
The same shit happened to me a couple years ago. Not the name but hacked with all of the same securities in place. It was BS. I stopped playing for quite a while after that. Somehow they by passed the authenticator and changed the phone number it was under without me ever getting an email. I can't figure out how to change that even with full access to all accounts needed. They didn't even change the email address attached to the account or disable the authenticator. What the fuck is the point to all of it if it doesn't matter?
---
Maybe the poster who was “hacked” tried selling the name at first, got scammed, realized her fuck up and is now trying to get her name back.
---
Except there's studies to back up what i'm saying
---
and you're just spewing...words

Eh why you lying? You tried selling vegeta on sythe and it got sniped.
---
Because when you were younger you had no stress, you had fun doing anything. Runescape may have been a bit of an escape but I think as we get older playing it brings back memories of being a carefree kid. Even progressing in runescape makes that little kid in you happy. I read its good mental health to be able to tell the kid you that you are proud of yourself since a lot of times parents and teachers can be hard on you. This game is a great break from reality when you need it.

Gz on the 61m lol

I can see why your getting destroyed. if you've seriously got a 1 attack, 50 strength 1 defense account in free to play, im really sorry but im not sure what your account it trying to do. If your willing to go Pay-to-play, your account would be optimal for an obby mauler. Otherwise, yes get 40 attack for the rune 2h, and train your ranged as high as you can without raising your combat level.
---
Memes aside, if its fun for you in random moments, it would be more fun with access to members content. Just saying.

Alright, then ban everyone else.

Well I mean outrage culture kinda did create a lot of racists. Disenfranchised young men wondering why there seems to be huge double standards with who its okay to openly mock in the media and society in general, and how criticism of white men seems to be the main thing allowed turns people into racists. For example pointing out the majority of schoolshooters are white males is fine and allowed. Pointing out in the US blacks make up 13% of the population but 53% of violent crime is evil and racist. Or how about Joe Biden saying that rape culture is "white mans culture" despite whites being one of the most underrepresented groups in rape crimes. How do you think it would go if someone said it was "black mans culture" (which would actually be more true as they are very overrepresented in rape statistics) 
---
You keep criticizing one group and then getting them fired/outcasting them when they criticize yours back then yeah theyre going to hate you. 
---
Source: Im racist and know a lot of racists. I see racism as natural. 
---
Why are they easily hacked?
---
Thank you so much! Was actually going to use some of that for a giveaway in the next video! :D
---
i think what it really boils down to is we hate retards like you so go fuck yourself
---
This has to be one of the dumbest comparisons yet.
---
Justicar armour is in the OSRS game, but not because it's oldschool. It was released last year dude. Torva was released 7 years before Justicar. 
---
How can you get that animation
---
Hmm, i wonder if there's any chance they would bring back Nex?
---
Blame Jagex for that, bud. They do a shit job with account security and customer service.
---
Oof.
---
Jagex customer service and account security is a fking joke
---
"After I spoke with the level 126 guy, I proceeded to waste the time and troll all 3 of the players involved in this lure for about 2 hours while watching netflix until they got frustrated, started flaming me and gave up." This is like those people who waste the time of nigerian scammers on youtube, nice.
---
Haha, probably not. Though the problem is usually that people reuse an old email address or password, which can be found in leaked databases.

While I think the books are great, I also think time travelling is the one bad thing that shouldn't have been added.

What's the gp/h?

Every fuckin time.

Every time I see this episode I gotta tell someone in all seriousness that this is how jagex works

"A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. "
---
I didn't bring up Hearthstone, poker, or anything other than RS.
---
Thank you very much. My goal is to get obby maul but forgot it was a member weapon lol. I guess I’ll train my attack to 40 and use rune. Also the highest i can get my range without affected level will be 45. Should I do that? 
---
Most of the time when JMods investigate, the account is usually bought and OP's would desperately try to regain access to it via Reddit. They usually don't have the security that they claim.
---
If you want to protect your account do all of the following:
---
1. Use a bank PIN and 2 factor authentication for your RuneScape account.
---
2. Do not go to Twitch streams that have you login to a "Jagex" website, these include Twitch stream titles like "Double XP weekend on OSRS, Woox is quitting OSRS". Also, don't go to links that you see spammed at the Grand Exchange, things like "YouTube 5bil giveaway", they will also ask you to login to a phishing website for your account info.
---
3. Keep your RuneScape password and RuneScape email password different.
---
4. Setup 2 factor authentication for your email.
---
5. Make sure your computer has antivirus.
---
After completing Troll romance quest
---
Dc @ shamans that’s rough
---
I’m perfectly aware of what a straw man fallacy is. Hearthstone is considered an esport and is definitely very RNG based and therefore provides an example of a game that is RNG based and an esport. 
---
What happend to torvesta ?
---
Say the same thing on all of these posts: go quest! It’ll teach you a lot and take you around, along with getting you progress towards barrows gloves. 
---
Big F. Incredible account even without hc status!
---
Oh you rascal!
---
Can sy tell me where this crab meme comes from?
---
A little off topic but my friend actually bought the name CD a couple years ago, then sold it again about 6 months later. 6 months after that he recovered my friends ironman that had a fresh tbow and we never heard from him again. 
---
Shitty guy.
---
She only said Dumbledore is gay when someone asked directly like 10 years ago. Also, that's VERY relevant to the story, as this was the big reason he didnt confront Grindelwald in time, even though he was the only one who could do it and he knew Grindelwald was up to no good.
---
Now the films about this era are being made and people say this is not relevant?
---
Also, this is the only non-straight relationship ever mentioned in the entire 7-book series and the world-building afterwards, so it's hardly like she's turning everyone gay or trans or bi. Come the fuck on.
---
Depending on what service you use, you can always see the actual email it comes from, on gmail you press the down arrow which shows more details, like who it's been mailed by and who it's been signed by.
---
That would be a good start, it should also work for accounts that have had their pw recently changed (so you can recover a hacked account)
---
They don't disqualify people, they disqualify accounts.
---
TLDR 
---
Well obviously, since us South Americans are playing on 150+ ping because Jagex doesn't give a fuck about us.
---
shut up grandpa the future is here
---
/u/JagexAcorn /u/Jagex_Weath Surely there's something to this

She’s can take a shit while wearing her clothes. Worth the $11

Replying to this comment since I'm not really sure where else to put this.
---
I have 2FA and a bank pin, I've been hacked in the midst of changing authentication devices, but just a few days ago I logged in (2fa hadn't been touched in weeks) and my bank pin was set to expire. I have no clue how it happened and I never talk to bankers so it's not like I did it on accident.
---
Nice i wish i had someone to play this game with :(
---
And Voldemort was definitely a mage Pker. The kind who get easily lured by low level.
---
I mean the problem is weak recovery answers, you don't want the answer of what was your first pet to be the actually name of ur first pet... you should make it a regular password like hunter2
---
Two characters in the entire wizarding world are gay, that's wayy less than what actual percentage of homosexuals in the world is. How does mentioning one gay relationship in the entire wizarding world make an autor full psychotic? 
---
As long as you don't click links and your login details are unique on your email &amp; rs account(with 2FA on osrs and email), you'll be fine.
---
Well I guess sorry then, your opinion isn’t really valid then because there are RNG based games that have esports events. That’s a perfectly valid argument you can’t deny just because you “don’t have knowledge” of them, things don’t work like that. 
---
Perfect for my Clothed Female Nude Male + poop porn site. 
---
The OP of the original post told me that the account that stole the name was banned, so hopefully he gets the name back sometime soon
---
I guess you could say it's somewhat paranoia, but it's basically cause my main account probably has some weird shit in my comment history, so I made this account to use at work. Then I realised I still comment some weird shit, so I just delete my comments so if anybody at work was to see this username they aren't gonna see any weird shit lol
---
And just since we’re throwing definitions around, if you really wanna be technical the definition of an esport is, “a multiplayer video game played competitively for spectators, typically by professional gamers.” Which just entirely invalidates everything you’ve said. 
---
is there any real way around a bank pin? 
---
Who the hell hasn’t heard of that site lol
---
Looks like a rwt
---
Gimme an add if you want ingame just DM me ur ingsme. Can give advice every know and then alwyas love heloing a FNG
---
IKR he literally said he trades his wealth off his main account to his mule lol
---
No, thats just the reddit circlejerk. 95% of these posts have user fault to blame. Its happened maybe a few times in the last 5 years that someone made a post like this and it turned out to be a automatic system error (normally false bans) or a rogue Jmod. 
---
So no, secure your bloody account, put a pin and auth on it, have a unique password, with an email that is also uniquely passworded and 2fa'd, and you **will not get hacked**. Don't go onto a site other than the RS client and type your info in... and if you have to change mobiles or something, merge the auth immediately, don't delay it.
---
Source: maxed account with "billions of gp" that easily could have been targeted by the "ease of hacking it" plenty of times.
---
It’s a shame recovery questions can’t be changed now but they still use them in their account recovery form..
---
And I dont think it is 35k xp more like 20k. Barb fishing as semi afk gives more than 35k
---
Not as true as the post before but still true.
---
It doesn't need any publicity, everyone knows about it, it doesn't matter.
---
Fine, here's 6000. 
---
Please help.
---
Have you used any runescape-related forums or sites relating to runescape where you needed to log in?
---
I won't do that publicly. Ill message the guy and get him to talk to me, that's all that matters 
---
Fuck I wish my grandma was cool enough to play osrs.
---
I'm out of the loop, been a while since I played, what's this whole torvesta and $11 thing?
---
Glienor is flat
---
On the osrs wiki re. Redwood trees - it mentions that if you chop it down, it will regrow. Would you receive farming experience if it grows back to full health? 
---
You can regret playing a game with 0 customer support. There's nothing we can do but upvote you.
---
Dude come on lmao.
---
DS2 for sure. Died four times on Galvek, whereas in MM2 you could semi-safespot Glough.
---
I do on nights and weekends. Managed to AFK my way to 99 mage on mobile at work. 
---
&gt; a lot less edgy and a lot less racist now.
---
Fixed that for ya
---
Yep
---
Nice. I wanted to try Wintertodt at work but it's not that afk
---
its SYTHE
---
No mate, I know about that stuff and this email is only ever logged into runescape client and website nothing elce.
---
My range and magic is prob too low to safespot I mostly melee things
---
shit attempt tbh
---
&gt; That issue goes deep. It even got revealed that one of the employees at Jagex leaked IP addresses to a clan called RoT (He's now fired, and got reported to the police)
---
This baffles me, why does a regular JMod have access to IPs of users? In any normal company that shit would be protected and only be allowed to be requested under specific situations
---
You eat the meat.
---
1. Because exp doesn't end after 99. 
---
2. People like to compete for highscores / status. 
---
3. People actually just enjoy skilling and playing the game. 
---
Whatever helps you sleep mad boy
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much. You should only really be margin checking things you can afford at least 3 of anyway, but if you do take a huge loss checking the margin, then you've found an item with huge profit potential. If anything it's a good thing.
---
Ego issue, or full nerd mode
---
Well, if they spoofed then your IP address must have been compromised. A public IP address is of course shared all the time across the internet, but the hackers need to connect your account to a IP.
---
   
---
I think it's most likely either through a rougue application on your computer, you visiting a website they own or the information came straight from Jagex.
---
It's currently morning, 9AM, in England so maybe you'll get your answer soon. I just woke up and scrolled through some posts before I came to this, so it's pretty high up at least. I hope you get help from Jagex!
---
But OG stands for Original Gangster. 
---
People seem to be using it wrong quite often.
---
It’s hilarious you called it op not og and good luck hope you get it back
---
Whip first IMO, 100% will do them at some point I just don't fancy maging 1000's of metal dragons low level :p
---
Its so annoying needing to post on reddit to get a actual response...
---
A RAT can't access the authenticator app on your phone, unless you have a RAT on your phone as well which is highly unlikely without having a rooted/jailbroken phone. 
---
nice
---
Think there is a black dragon in one of the guys quest and the final boss I read you can use prayer so I prob would be 1 shot 
---
I went 1.7k gargoyle kills without a maul, and yesterday got 5 in one task lmao. I'm 1 level from Abby demons and hope my luck carries over
---
Don't get me wrong, not having authenticator is dumb as shit, but even if you have it, if you get recovered, it's instantly disabled, so it doesn't save you from that.
---
Have you not seen the absolute peak of humanity on display over at /r/beholdthemasterrace? Truly the future for the human race....
---
And still couple days left of March. Update the calendar boys!
---
Its already fixed you just havent gotten the update yet
---
From what I understand the old-school wizards are for segregation and Harry and the Weasley's would prefer it if they joined. As far as we know the future wizarding world will join the muggles. I also don't understand your beaty is good point since our main characters are never described as beautiful and the dementors are supposed tk be hideous monsters so of course they're ugly.
---
That's true, but if it's not against the rules why would they waste their time with it? 
---
ayy scooter boyy
---
Yes lol
---
this is cute
---
Memes? 
---
You think it's going to stop at *Memes?*
---
Think bigger. There is nothing new under the sun.
---
Everything we know and enjoy today is a reproduction of old folklore.
---
Copyright "protects" creativity the same way **castration** might "protect" your genetic legacy.
---
When nobody can create because everything is already owned by the same SIX media conglomerates, no society held back by these rules will be able to compete on the market anymore.
---
But that's fine, I suppose... A society that strangles itself practically *deserves* to choke. It's just a shame it'll take so many people with it when it self destructs...
---
That's not muling you literal fucking baby brained retard.

nigga what

---
Just don’t buy names and let the seller onto your account.
---
Alternatively, use 2fa authentication on both your email and RS account with unique passwords.
---
Matter of the fact is that retards like to pin stuff on Jagex rather than to follow common sense when it comes to account security.
---
there is another path, you are just missing it.  
---
Sounds like grounds for a November 5th scenario...
---
Only if you wear your sisters pants I will add you 🤣

Lmfaoo

lol, so many questions, so few anwsers

Got myself one on ironman a couple days ago, first rare drop too. I thought it was 1:10k but naw, just 1:2k while on a slayer task so not that rare.

---
DMM isn’t boring to me as a spectator. Hence why 2000 people qualify each tourney, and hence why Jagex are flying people how to Cambridge to discuss future changes. 
---
Whether you like it or not, the tournament getting streamed, and recorded on YouTube nets a lot of new players to the game. Otherwise why would Jagex invest so much into it? 
---
Even if I didn’t particularly like DMMT, I’d still support it because I want the best for the games health and longevity.
---
I'll be on after work. Don't have to much fun without me in the Slayer dungeons 
---
Like Jmod Smackdowns have been 100% accurate.
---
3rd age. Best I could afford

Reserve name feature ?

Rag and bone man II is fucking easy and people need to get over it like holy shit. Ftfy

Other way around.

I did quit for over a year, only recently started again. Main reason being so many irl friends are playing atm they make it worth.
---
Provide one log in code per unique sperm sample sent in
---
To be fair its only weath that is always wrong
---
I love the Dutch, they have good bants
---
Other outrage is because jagex is treating far more toxic strategies as acceptable. (Funelling, locking down quests, ragging bots)
---
However I'm going to refute the claim that all of his wealth is safe.
---
What's the goal of the flipping alt? 
---
To get high level gear.
---
What's his main doing with it's GE?
---
The same exact thing.
---
What happens when he gets the gear? It goes straight onto the main.
---
The nature of the alt isn't an mule with malicious uses, it's flipping to funnel himself. His risk on his main would be even HIGHER because he's taking much more expensive gear out into non safe zones.
---
Based on what disclosed to the community of his strategy, the intent was never to hide his wealth on an alt, only to increase his own wealth faster.
---
And finally... some JMOD had previously told him what he was doing is okay. Now instead he gets banned while toxic clans get away for free. It's disgusting.
---
dying on a hardcore is easily the most demotivating thing in the entire game, my guy probably invested 3.5k+ hours into this one account, most people would be a bit depressed after that
---
if you can't see the difference between two humans playing two accounts and one human playing two accounts, I don't think you understand the rules. have a good one.
---
2 tick swords are 120k xp, 3 ticking barb fish 110k and afk barb 60k. Other fishing methods are really not worth considering
---
you have to right click- guzzle to get 1 hp, eating wont get it that low 
---
Where's your proof that they're not banning everyone that they catch hoarding wealth on accounts that never leave safe zones?
---
And it doesn't matter if it accomplishes the same thing.. it's the way in which players are going about accomplishing that goal which is different. 
---
One way is against the rules because there is literally ZERO percent chance they will lose items on a mule.
---
The other way is not against the rules because the accounts farming wealth can still be killed for bank.
---
I don't know how to make this any clearer, you're being willfully ignorant because you hate clans.
---
Considering millennials are born from 1981-1998, all of us are born in that generation. Unless you're 40+. 
---
What the fuck lol theres a reason why some people can literally win a card game in 1 move and it isnt because of skill. 
---
Now I'll give you the fact that hearthstone has a sort of protection with mana increasing each turn, but the game still has a shit ton of elements based on luck.
---
If you are drawing cards, you rely on the luck of the cards. Shit, even twisted fate knows that lol.
---
&gt; Game of thrones is about complex, deep, and realistic characters being given hard moral choices and seeing how those choices impact them, and the world.
---
to be fair, you need a very high IQ to understand Game of Thrones
---
One requires organisation and strategy with peers who can still be killed for items the other is just a cheese way to keep all of your wealth out of reach and gives you a ZERO percent chance of ever losing those items.
---
I have been streaming for the last 3 years and have never been hacked. 
---
Well it’s zammy legs and I switched to zammy boots, but idk. I just kinda compared the stats and went with what I thought had the best. Karils coif was better than zammy coif. I never know what to do when it comes to combat lol even after playing for 15 years.
---
Playtime 
---
Emily got hacked?
---
Yeah how much?
---
time to see if jagex can manage that
---
Who is serene
---
Ah, yes, racism doesn't exist, it's just people being edgy for attention/humour.
---
How do names open up? I renamed my main a couple months ago and can't get the name on my alt. Is it likely taken? 
---
How would that have helped here... They can DC too (probably more often) and once you DC you have to wait to be out of combat 
---
So what's preventing jagex from changing the client?
---
Nice man!
---
You can't make a game based on rng an e sport.
---
I smell a new mod Jed is around... 
---
Hunter2
---
You're truely cringe and downvoted.
---
I miss annihalating everyone with storm of armadyl in full virtus + divine with soulsplit.
---
I well aware this is what ultimately ruined the game but it's the most fun i ever had.
---
where the tits is the pic
---
Started playing 10 years ago. Never heard of that site.
---
Lmao, about time 
---
I think IF jagex helps OP out, they'll transfer the name manually resulting in it being unsnipable.
---
A big problem is that the recovery system is flawed
---
They’re not doing the same exact thing and if they are they’re getting caught too.
---
You'd have to know which country to use first time , so maybe that's leaked or the website doesn't lock accounts as it has no 2fa either.
---
Soooo ultimate ironman,abusing zulrah suicides?

KQ was the first rs2 boss, and the first npc to be higher level than KBD
---
Are you thinking of RS3?
---
All card games carry inherent rng. In poker you evaluate the probabilities to make the best decision, meanwhile in those other two you usually use your deckbuilding skills to minimize the bad rng of draws. Also in mtg or hs tournaments they don't do bo1s, it's usually bo3 or bo5 format, which again allows the card draw rng determined victories be somewhat reduced. None of this applies to dmm or runescape at all
---
Not an argument. Why are you defending an RWTer? Still waiting for that.
---
Rwt jagex $11 to get a t-bow spawn in your poh
---
I'm so glad they did change that message... the pressure was overwhelming sometimes.
---
I only enjoy pve, but I’m not going to screw someone over and vote no pvp lol 
---
The fk??
---
Yeah the line is really not clear. Too vague to be something jagex is so decisive on, they need to really define the line between muling and alting.
---
Even with today’s gear she is still a cunt to kill. Lord have mercy for the poor suckers on release

It was only meant to save bank space. It's fine as it is.

So Heathstone isn't an E-Sport?

MM2 is just extremely frustrating and long whereas DS2 has decently hard mechanics

D hasta is worse dps dude. D sword has higher dps then hasta. Hasta is literally useless.

Our upvotes have been accepted by the gods and our prayers answered

I’m already 50 so good to know

phew

They are case sensitive tho
---
Just a tad subtle, I like it.
---
Stealing virtual currency is also illegal in some countries. 
---
So how long before we start a task force of buying RSN's off the site, charging-back the seller and returning the names to original owners?
---
Idk if I feel safe giving Google my runescape details. They could steal my gp
---
They aren't I promise. I can type my password all lower case, all upper case, a mix and it accepts it regardless

She did go above and beyond here to bring it to you guys and deserves praise for sure!

my account is worth more than my child, and im not autistic wtf are you talking about.

 *According to the lead programmer (Andrew Gower), they had been working on it for 2 years before launching it in January 2001.* ***Possible bias with the clans****. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong though* 
---
Quests the only content that doesn't respawn...
---
guys how do I filter out "xd look what I got" posts asking for a friend
---
Yeah but it is true that clans/teams have HELPED make the wildy dead in combination with BH. No one goes deep wildy anymore with any sort of risk at all now unless they have a clan/team with them because if you even bring a staff risk a clan/team will be waiting there to hit you so most people just dont even go brid deep wildy as much anymore and bring mystics and standard gear at best. Part of that reason is due to the clans really have nothing else to do though so they just sit there waiting to log in and fall in on someone all day even if they arent really in much risk(I mean people will get falled in on for a blessed spirit shield and occult even). That and theres really no good reason to go in the wildy on a regular world compared to BH(also no PJ timer on other worlds) because its much more profitable to do BH and everyone is on the BH world, pkers really only go into the wilderness on non BH most of the time to farm PvMers because theres nothing else to do which is pathetic that theres FAR more reason for a PvMer to be in the wilderness than a Pker tbh.
---
Dang this is sad but I guess most hcim who make it that far end up losing status to dc. Shame really. I also owned a hcim. But I died afking to a blue wizard at combat lvl 19 so now I can play without fear. Unique death poggers. 
---
Two ways the vault can be improved:
---
* allow us to add saplings to the vault
---
* make our current farming contract appear in the favorites page automatically
---
Runelite is open source and you can literally look at the code. Even if you’re not a programmer you can be sure there are plenty in the RS community and they’d make sure something like this would blow up all over the front page.   
---
That said, someone giving out a modified / malicious version is possible which is why everyone on this thread is saying make sure you only download the official version or compile it yourself.
---
Mithrilman mode
---
Ironman man mode, but you also hate yourself
---
While youre at it jagex I'd like my Lord Capulet name back. Had it since I was a kid :(
---
I vote no for the 30 man groups that go around killing people in multi for less than $10k loot
---
They said you can’t add quest seeds in the vault. 
---
Jagex does something positive and you feel the need to make a backhanded compliment? Why?
---
I think I’ll just go for 75 than, just to be safe
---
pog CHAMPPPPP

Out of every possible problem in the world, you are worrying about a silly video game username? Come on. My first ever username was Engineer, then Cyber, and then IT, but I always change names. Sure, when I saw Cyber taken, it was unfortunate, but I just changed it to another name instead. 
---
Well considering were halfway through the season, another 10 episodes is basically the end. So they'll probably tone it down after next weeks ep and climax again at the end. I doubt they'll let it get too boring considering how they've paced it so far.
---
Zmi altar runners
---
Sounds like you sold all your stuff and are trying to come up with whatever backstory that will stick.
---
Doable but will be long, took me about 2 hours with these stats a rune crossbow and addy or mith bolts. If you’re loaded on cash just get 75 and a pipe
---
Nope, there has never been a pvp area near clan wars
---
wtf..
---
Well, make sure to update me on whether it was on your or Jagex's end then when it's all over.
---
You should be proud! My account isn’t that nice and I’m not even a iron man 
---
Lol someone is salty their rapier got sniped
---
Huh, you have vorki, but the hcim firsts page doesn't have anyone for first vorki pet. Guess Jagex stopped caring about that page a long time ago.

Cant wait,only 4 Years!

I posted the exact same hours ago lmao

Pray melee and piety (or rigour/eagle eye if you are ranging) and attack it. As the little green and blue demon spawns, run away a bit until they unaggro you. Run back and attack the nechryarch and once it spawns those things again, just run away and unaggro. Repeat until its dead.

Snowflake suck ass
---
Ya mums ironic ya fuckin flog go bat off to more cartoons weeb boi
---
Apparently. Like it's any different than watching a movie and doing a skill lol
---
No. 
---
Is that how odds work? because they're two seperate rolls aren't they just 1/16000 and 1/(whatever it is off graador). dunno exactly hope someone can enlighten me
---
Slowly working towards it myself. It's definitely top 3 favourite pets for me. So envious.
---
probably one of jagex'es children stealing parents access and having fun. Its funny too cuz i realistically cant see a way acc just gets stolen out of the blue unless your pc is ratted or you reused your details on a number of sites and got social engineered your identity from multiple sources and that was enough to recover your acc.
---
Your characters are still around, just in RuneScape 3. (Not Old School). Regardless of your recovery attempts you will be starting fresh in this game.
---
It's cool, I got a Skilla pass from my friend 
---
You must have a lot of friends 
---
good luck charging back your bitcoin
---
11 buckaroos a month for F tier support
---
yo did you mention that you are on mobile?
---
You think there is any bot in this game that would make it 40+ days let alone 24 hours of game play with out getting banned and you're actually retarded 
---
In a weightlifting competition where you have to move heavy objects from point A to point B,
---
Having a 2nd backpack is an unfair advantage
---
But having 10 friends help you carry the weights then hand them to you at the last second isn't an unfair advantage
---
You're completely clueless about fair rules of competition if you actually think like this
---
Ya you’re getting hack now.. 
---
You're still hoping to get the name back huh? I guess there's always hope. Shame yall tweeted it I really liked that name. I sniped it from chad btw
---
Thanks for reminding me! It’s mobile only!
---
If it is your first time getting a fire cape, then I would suggest you just go for it. You will probably fail a few times and you get your ranged level up in there anyways. I started with 70 range and ended up killing jad with 73
---
It's weird but this genuinely reads like not a joke and that's worrying to me lmfao
---
While bursting/barraging you can freeze it, move behind a nechryael *that has also moved* and use it as a safespot. You have to move the nechryael so that it is not trampled and blocks the superior.
---
It's because some phones have a wider aspect ratio than normal, because manufacturers decided to make displays longer to make them bigger, instead of keeping the ratio which would increase the width
---
you probably got runelite from bad source.
---
Thanks for the work on the Seed Vault! Much appreciated. Cheers
---
Authy is the one I use too.
---
Imagine pretending PvP doesn't have a whole gamemode constantly sucking up devtime then blaming pvmers for your small group of players not getting updates.
---
Yes ty for saying it
---
what are some good money makers for the following stats?
---
80 Mage, 80 Range, 80 Strength, 70 Attack, 70 Defence, 60 Slayer?
---
Not true 😂
---
its like 5m for a blowpipe i don't think you need to be "loaded" on cash to have a 6m set up
---
I have all of my account logins saved in a text file on my drive account. Stupid of me I know. 
---
Organizing my bank again after the seed vault update opened a lot more space.
---
Turn your rage meter down bot, you’re hurting me by calling me retarded.
---
Cultural trend. More females are named Tracy than men are, which dictates its' inherent femininity to society.
---
I liked my name. I had it for about 8 years. I got hacked and the hacker got my account permabanned to release the name and steal it.  My account remains permabanned. Obviously it's not the biggest deal in the world but it is upsetting.  
---
We don't know what the conversation was.  
---
Torvesta's video was him stating he muled for a couple of seconds, then went onto how main game pvp is broke. Yeah he said he asked a jmod who said it seemed allowed, but showed no evidence. For all we know, he could of said "is it ok if i play on 2 accounts", without mentioning him muling.  
---
Fact that he changed the topic of him muling pretty fast indicates he's lying about something, probably the conversation.  
---
Please withdraw any jury duties you're offered, because holy fuck.. "Torv said jmod said this, so torv is 100% correct".  
---
Jagex is a business. Yes, banning Torv would cause damage to DMM, so you think the'd ban him for no reason?
---
wrong wiki
---
Please do make a new post with what they said and how they won't return your name, will skyrocket on this sub.
---
I had the same thought, but seems a bit too OP. Inventory space comes at a premium price while doing slayer or almost anything, which is why the seed box is in existence allowing you to pick up most of, if not all of, the seed drops.
---
I think more in line with current game mechanics would be an option to send seeds directly from your bank to the seed vault however - or perhaps a lunar spell to send seeds to vault.
---
Yeah its hard to actually prove his housemate did it, that's the actual problem if true, hes facing.. 100% doubt he will get unbanned, rip if it is true lol...
---
I trust you pu22ydestroya, I'll go get that quest cape. (156 points in)

Well at least you know your fav streamer isn't quitting and there's no double xp this weekend. 
---
Ohhhh, was this supposed to be funny???
---
How is nmz at work all day and then playing all night. It no lifing lol? You realize how actually impossible it would be to bot that  right ? Like, u literally cannot 
---
Yes...I understand this because I can read and read the post.
---
However that doesnt answer the question of how have there been significant problems and issues with PvP (and im not talking about just a complete lack of content updates here, I mean fixing some of the current problems not introducing new things necessarily) that have lasted so long that still havent been fixed? The excuse of time and resources is a completely invalid one when there have been issues that have had years to fix. Why is there no mod taking their personal time to fix PvP issues? Because it seems like there isnt even ANY regular company time being spent on it to begin with.
---
What a dreadful response from Jagex… basically saying yeah we can see your name was stolen but we ain't giving it you back
---
Is this on mobile?
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀 🦀JMODS WON'T RESPOND TO THIS 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Yh ig I phrased it wrong but by his stats I was under the assumption that unless bought, 5m gp wouldn’t be readily available to him. No disrespect to op but the account seems fairly new 
---
Well not really 0, $11/ mo amirite?
---
So I'm trying to link my google account because for some reason I've been getting constantly logged out on android and I don't actually know my password (password manager) so that's been a pain in the ass.
---
But I went to the linked accounts page, tried to link my google account, and keep getting a 404 error.  Any suggestions?
---
downvoted for wasting my time :D
---
Only! Lol
---
I think it may have been intended as such...
---
you don't need authenticator to get access to place where you change names, thats why hacker didn't ruin his status, because he didn't get in the account at the game.
---
share pls
---
I mean they have no way or proving it was you or your "roommate" considering it is the same ip and you expect them to just take you at face value and believe you when so many people lie all the time over same thing. 
---
You are changing your name, therefore when you change it, it gets released after 35 days. If this name is so "valuable" to you, then why are you changing it in the first place?
---
Am I missing something here?
---
Freeze it instantly and farcast, don't let those fuckers spawn in the first place. 
---
Shit white people do haha 
---
I mean reddit is kinda proof. Just google : osrs first hcim to max, and you'll see it's Guile.

If you're capable of open minded thought, consider the following:
---
A generation of kids can grow up in a time of war, and their children could grow up in a time of peace. The older generation would be completely different in mannerisms, culture, and experiences.
---
It's not that as you get older, new things seem dumber to you. Culture and society actually change, believe it or not. And this is a back and forth change that will constantly happen throughout history because for every progressive idea, there's going to be a negative feedback loop to equalize it.
---
Being addicted to the Internet was very, very rare in the 90s. Reflect how many kids grow up playing video games, watching youtube, and going through social media/forums nowadays.
---
It's a pvp tournament which is open till the point of 1v1s...

Every season people bitch that any clan member won. There's nothing you can do to stop making it clan mode, unless everyone was an ironman....

They were literally currency for people who had max cash stacks. Platinum wasnt a thing back in old runescape and you could only have about 7 max cash stacks (6 in your g.e. and 1 in your inventory) 
---
Blue hats specifically at the time were worth more than max cash so people were using then as currency placeholders.
---
How is the authenticator relevant to this scenario? It isn't used to log in to the site to change your name.
---
It shows you're considerate enough to censor it.It.s not so deep
---
hmm. im on the fence on this one.   
---
On one hand, yeah it was your fault for not having the right security, although i know of cases where people were hacked who had all the security possible anyways.  
---
On the other hand, i think jagex, having clearly seen evidence that you are not the one who changed your name, should seek to return your name to you.
---
its funny i guess you just had a really bad day today lol
---
How does that even make sense? Jamflex really is meme tier customer support. 
---
us whities gotta be careful nowadays smh
---
very nice :D
---
Best of luck mate!
---
peg asians first ye ;)
---
Because OP didn't get support the way it should work, he basically got ignored everywhere else including their email.  Someone shouldn't need to go to reddit to get support.
---
You didn’t have an Authenticator on ? 
---
How so? They don't return gold when people get phished. If your account gets breached, that's on you.
---
Aren't their stats in defense lower than D legs? Currently going for 60def. Or is it for a full set to train strength?
---
If as an iron your knowingly abusing something like using cannon balls to lure you should be de-ironed. As your doing it to speed up your single player and get around the tedious process of making all the cballs
---
That honestly sounds like a great plan
---
His scenario is so bizare, it's 2019 who the hell shares his computer with a roommate...

It would still be bandos drop rate * minion drop rate because that's the sequence that happened so it's insanely rare to get drop from bandos then minion idk rates but find then and multiply and there you go

Agreed

---
Hate to brake it to ya bud but darklordd5 is a pretty shitty name to.

They give a +1 strength bonus. That's pretty much it. Better for training as you wont really need to tank anything.
---
It isn't required to get in to the name change section of the site, so that doesn't really matter.
---
That’s why I am not playing, I don’t want to start again, I want my characters back and I will pay membership again. But I don’t want to start again. I had 102, 89, 120 level characters and just want to start where I left off. But I guess what you are saying that is not possible? If so I guess runescape really is dead for me.

what are some good money makers i could do with [these stats](https://i.imgur.com/DBdkFH5.png)?
---
I'm pretty sure the "virtual currency" youre talking about or cryptocurrency that is protected by law is something like Bitcoin, etherum and so on. They hold legimate value compared to USD and can be used to purchase stuff. Some companies around the world even accept direct Bitcoin payments to pay for their services\goods. While Rs gp holds no real life value. You can't buy a house, car or a meal with rs gp. Only things you can buy with rsgp are in game items. So rsgp is actually totally useless as a currency
---
I would post them but on discord ot says they are deleted. My replies to him were just me giving him the info be would ask for. No rude comments to him at all.

They will usually delay the person anyway, but thats a good idea.

Just use a karil's xbow, don't listen to people who ask you to use blowpipe.

I mean sure, it makes it faster but it doesn't help if you don't know what you're doing and it's much easier to fuck up with blowpipe since the range is so short, especially when you're learning to safespot.

Depends how long he’s staying at nmz, b gloves are only +6 strength over a cb brace

I think you’re the one that needs to withdraw from jury duty with critical thinking skills like this.

Jagex obviously is okay with alts with how rampant they are with streamers. We know this regardless of torvestas video. This is not hard.

Died twice before I figured it out. Freeze than run around abit until you get a neck between you and superior. Then you should be able to kill it no problem

I think you basically want: superior garden, achievement gallery, and portal nexus as close to your entrance as you can. You could have a gilded alter but it's more efficient to have the pool for restoring prayer and the wilderness alter for training. I think for a minimalist house that's all you really need. I'm sure more experienced peeps would say otherwise tho

Yeah this is what I meant with the last part of my comment, (I'm not 100% Dutch, moved to NL 20 years ago when I was 8) but I figured "pure" Dutch people might absolutely not even notice 'midget' in midget golf as a word with meaning

That's all reasonable. I have to ask thougb, if you have all the security measures in place does that mean you could expect to get a hacked name back? Or are stolen names gone forever regardless?

---
No, everyone getting caught with proof of botting should be banned, as they are. Also jmod shouldn't go around telling people that it's okay to do something people might consider botting, for example using a mechanical machine that in real life clicks for you, as they don't. 
---
Do you think that if jagex said botting was allowed people who then started botting should get punished? I guess here you might argue that the written rules are more meaningful, but why exactly is that? What if there were no written rules and the only info you could get was from a person, who then gave you false information. Should that lead to punishment as you weren't breaking rules intentionally? 
---
Tbf blizzard support is just that, blizzard. It goes for every one of their games, jagex’s only successful game is RS.

Depends how long he wants to stay at nmz. It’s unlikely b gloves would be a big enough upgrade to save him time by getting them first, ie getting 30 qp and then doing all of rfd, before starting nmz

A few years ago when trying to transfer ‘61’ to an Ironman it was sniped by a script, taken in 1 second. I spent like 50 quid on bonds and got the name myself from the name cleanup back in like 2014. Lo and behold no response from jägex.

I get it, were all addicted to this game, but why in the hell do we allow them to get away with trash customer support? The only way to send a message is to stop paying for them to take our stuff and sell it on the black market. WoW Classic can't come soon enough for me...
---
its probably hosted in some obscure place they cant touch legally
---
Sorry to hear that.  This game is absolutely fantastic right now.  You will be missing out on quite a lot.  
---
Everyone had to start fresh, not just you.  
---
Yeah, but if he does rfd, gets the +6 strength bonus for higher dps, and then does NMZ, it will take longer than going to NMZ, getting his stats up with lower dps, and THEN going and doing rfd. The time to do both will be lower doing it first, however doing it after the time to get his stats up may be faster, but the time to do both will definitely be slower.
---
It all depends on if he plans on getting b gloves soon after nmz, and if so, he should do it first for the training bonus, cause he’s going to do it regardless
---
Reeeee, you don't understand the mechanics and complain on Reddit
---
so he lost his hardcore status? I'm so sorry. 
---
In all seriousness, RIP.  that was an awesome achievement and he will go down in osrs history.

There was a train of people running between the bank and the vault at the farmers guild

---
Not gonna lie that's fucked up considering how easy it is to bypass the authenticator. People make mistakes he learned from it, you punishing him even more is extremely messed up. Blizzard would have given his name back and an apology immediately. Unacceptable.
---
Awful shitpost to be honest
---
LOL this company. "Yes somebody stole your username, we won't give it back as you didn't use auth"
---
i dont get it
---
lmao true I guess it doesn't... I just hate being PK'd and potentially losing graceful.  the thought of that scares me so much lol.  I had a pker once who tried camping my graceful but eventually fucked off
---
Looks like you could do Zulrah
---
Wow this is HORRIBLE customer service. Also authenticator has nothing to do with it since you can bypass it via osrs website.
---
What is muling? 
---
Throw away reddit account for this ? 
---
It does he was hacked you can only use the name change section once a month. He was hacked someone logged into his account and used 2 binds to change the name so it was unreserved. Then being said it's still fucked up.
---
r/BlackPeopleTwitter
---
People who talk like this ought to be hanged or shot. Then I look at his flag and suddenly it all makes sense.

Can you order seeds by level automatically rather than seemingly random when thrown in at once with deposit all 
---
if they help you that’s bullshit 
---
Currently 50 barrows chests dry on my hcim. Just want any sort of tank item for a fire cape so I guess that sums it up pretty much
---
I won't play a team with a melee attacker. They get out dps'd by a scrub with level 60 range and a yew shortbow. Range or GTFO.

'If you're an existing player who already has and Old School account and a Google account' oopsie

Holy fuck this is hilarious

I believe you could change your mains name to the one it currently has, though it has to be done through the website and not in game

---
Literally zero difficulty and I know that. Have it on my previous characters.  Just takes time and not in a questing mood this week.  
---
save bank space. there are 70 different seeds you can store in your bank, excluding quest seeds. and sure you don't need to keep all your seeds but with farming contracts its good to have a pretty decent range of seeds available. it might be good to keep your most commonly farmed seeds in your bank for faster farm runs but now there's no reason not to keep all those extra willow seeds that you never use, it all adds up and in a month you might have 1m in willow seeds.
---
It is when the security offered is piss easy to bypass.
---
you fucken shit cunt hope feel empowered by doing shitty things like this to paying customers you piece of shit 
---
thanks for the tips, do you know any afk methods to do till i can afford this gear?
---
Appreciate the suggestion ;) Couldn't let you down!
---
Yeah but the point of UIM is no banking. A bank generally contains a vault, ergo, can’t use a vault because it’s a bank. 
---
Because you could make false hijackings and scam people (and that's not always Sythe, you can easily fool nornal people on eBay or Discord if Jagex returned names) or duplicate gold into the economy. An authenticator is very simple, and provides a 30 day session. Fair enough, bank pin is annoying and constantly asks, but no excuse for no authenticator and then coming to Reddit to complain or appeal when it's your fault. They either fell for phishing or leaks and didn't practice good account security when they're claiming they have a "rare" name, doesn't make sense. 
---
Jagex has been known to help whenever they fucked up.
---
My point is more about how with most skills there’s an unlock every 5 levels let’s say, which is usually a bit pointless on the lower end since leveling is exponential.  But with the way skilling culture is, generally a lot of people just gravitate towards highest XP rates or most afk. Giving a more options and unlocked methods at the upper ends could give room to not being do the same exact method for most of the time spent skilling. 
---
I just did Barrows🤷🏼‍♂️ piss easy and pretty good money with Morty Hards
---
I already know I'm not getting it back. It's just fucked how I took the thread down, it got stolen, sniped, and deleted. The Jmods said since it was used for RWT after it got snatched that they deleted it and it wouldn't be given back since it counts as lost items. My only chance is maybe going to Runefest.
---
Ah, silly pures. You give us entertainment everyday 💁‍♂️

There are so many ways you can be hacked now. Be it from leaked databases, bad links which made it to the top of your search page because of ad-words, someone you know personally, they are designed to trick you. So when your made a fool of by them should you then have to be made a fool of here to? That is if they are legit 
---
Maybe a re thinking of the bank all together? I would like an auto tab function where it automatically groups all items from each skill into different tabs. or something like that where there isnt as much work involved on the players and a kind of one size fits all approach.

The Swedish dude is speaking English, On an American Social Media Platform about a British game and you are concerned about his choice of the "slang" in his speech. Clearly its a mimicry of a popular "black southern complaining" way of speech that's basically a meme.

Continue questing and training for a g mauler.  You can probably do obby fights fine but the risk of a g mauler is generally speaking a lot less.

Isn’t this literally how runescape originally died with free trade? Because there are a few abusers, we’re gonna cut free trade and punish absolutely everybody for it. What happened then? The game died...
---
using ultracompost?
---
me, myself and irene

I think it would be better if names remain reserved for 30 days after name change (and this feature cannot be turned off). Additional name changes would not remove this reservation. This reservation would only apply to names that have been in use for at least 30 days straight. This would also quite efficiently kill name trading, which is why some people steal names in the first place.

He's right though, jagex have every right to all the accounts as they own the game, they could delete every account if they wanted to. There's nothing anyone would be able to do about it. 
---
*pulls out meat sceptre*
---
You’re a fucking moron
---
Cursed pilot 
---
have fun getting you account info leaked
---
Jagex does keep extended logs tho! Even if Sythe doesn't cooperate, their own PC will prove fencing.
---
Yeah too bad your “security measures” are shit and even worse is your customer support
---
Hang on a second there. There are 5 developers and 2 trainee developers. 3 of those developers are working on long term projects, 1 is a just out of training dev, and i'm training the other one. So... effectively 1 developer available for weekly updates.
---
This must be a godsend for ultimate ironmen, but I don't see the added value for regular players. 
---
You still need to bank for all your teleports, doesn't having to go to the seed vault too just add an extra step in your farm run, making it longer and more click intensive?
---
No, Jagex didn't say that at all. 
---
Mod Weath said the following:
---
&gt; [Just to clarify, we have a policy of not returning names to accounts where the player has been hijacked through their own doing. This is to prevent people from faking hijackings in order to sell names and then recover them at a later date.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b6i9ak/jagex_admits_name_was_taken_wont_return/ejkj3rk/?context=0)
---
As you can see it was a general statement and he was not specifically accusing this individual of selling their name.
---
You're even worse than the hacker.
---
Most HCIM that make it this far are only gonna die to ToB or a D/C. If Inferno and CoX weren't safe deaths we'd see a ton lose status those places as well.
---
like you really tried buying it for 300m... the lie you said was as bad as mine and I wanted to point that out
---
Wrong. Open source is not the finally solution. The code has never been audited to check for vulnerabilities. Man in the middle attacks are certainly possible with open source software. In addition, rogue updates can compromise your software EVEN if it is open source if you are downloading an already compiled program! Unless you compiled the code yourself, you are putting yourself at risk.
---
But if you can't sell the name there wont be any reason for the hacker to change it, besides being maleficent

the issue isn't locking down areas in general, its locking down areas that have a shitty broken delay when you enter them left over from rsclassic that make the area almost impossible to breach

---
Yeah, initiate has yellow trim, proselyte has more of an orangish gold trim.

Lmao Tracy you dumb
---
Auditing code does nothing if they release already compiled executables. Rogue updates can compromise your download. In addition, do you compile runelite yourself or do you downloaded an exe already compiled for it?
---
I came here for the drama, stayed for the smackdown
---
Haven't seen much on it but how do you use the seeds? Would I have to start my farm runs at the farming guild or can you access it from anywhere like a second bank but for seeds?
---
Runelite has a bank tag function -- is that similar to what you're suggesting?
---
All I ever see from Mod Wealth is excuses to NOT do his job. Just like this thread.

And when actual jmods hack people lmao. People really out here trying to say dumb shit like this.

We are talking about jagex’ spaghetti code over here.

I understand your frustration and what you're going through is difficult but you've gotta understand what kinda of precedent this sets for Jagex employees if they just take your word for it.
---
Imagine if every single person that got banned did this, it would just mean that the rule even existing in the first place would be completely redundant. 
---
It's a tricky situation for sure, especially when there's no evidence but you really need to take a look at their side too. There are some real assholes out there that would do the exact same thing you're doing but with malicious intentions.

Unpopular opinion: I think they should remove any name from circulation if it's found to be bought or stolen. So hopefully people will figure it's not worth the risk.
---
This would be relevant if people were talking about suing the company.
---
In regards to false hijackings why would that matter? We are talking about returning a name to an account, there is no duplications in this process. Once again Jagex does not support name trading, so if you are trading names this is done so at your own risk. The person who is selling the name will always be at an advantage and have the ability to reclaim the name, this is part of the risk you take.
---
I cannot make an excuse for anyone not having an Authenticator, but customer support is there to help players whether Jagex made the mistake or not. Just because someone makes a mistake and gets phished/scammed/hacked does not mean they ‘deserved it’ and that they should be punished for doing so, that’s just absurd.
---
... Nice.
---
3 months, he's late smh
---
It’s hilarious, worth the watch. 
---
Agree, the downside is that there will always be a market for these things, and just because there is doesnt mean jagex shouldnt help those that got hacked, or ban those that buy names permanently.
---
Just search crab rave
---
50% what? 
---
Have you not visited your poh? You can bank hundreds of items there. Or hidey holes you can bank hundreds of items there. Even the master scroll book has a storable aspect that 100% locks scrolls to your account, and is tossable any anygiven moment
---
Account name change system is recurring income for jagex. It is not favourable for time to put this system in place as it will cost them money 
---
Didn't even wait for PvP drama smh amateurs

This is very callous and shows your disdain for your own playerbase :/

I'm 81 and they hardly die with ultracompost. I also use an Iasor a lot of the time. To be fair though, they do die more than herbs do but I wouldn't say anywhere near 75%. For me it's 10-20%
---
You clicked untrustworthy links? This seems like your own fault
---
Ok don't click on trap links in the future. Case closed
---
This meme is just a fucking train wreck, go away
---
This would just be a workaround fix instead of addressing the actual underlying problem which is other people getting access to your account in the first place. Adding the authenticator to the website login would be a much better fix since then people can't get access to your account at all, provided you also have properly secured your email account and your login details are not leaked somewhere else.
---
I Still cant my name i want for my account after years of playing. I don't even know who has it, since my rs3 name isn't that and my osrs accnt isnt that name. I'v checked both high scores and the name doesn't seem to be taken :(
---
If anyone knows how to track down a name any info would be appreciated.
---
You see what you want to see to maneuvre yourself into the victim role. 
---
by the time that happens you probably couldve made way more then 3m

Never said I agreed with stashes. The POH stores mainly cosmetics, and you have to have the whole set for them anyway so it’s not the most useful. Really you’re just throwing a bunch of irrelevant points out my dude.

- Fashionscape wowee!

**Cons:**
---
- Please don't imply there are any cons that'd make me sad.
---
- What happens if I hold them in the wrong hands?
---
- I just realised the fish is dead. Oh goodness.

I just tried this. This is incorrect

well did you bring your clan wars pass?

This isn't how assumptions work. We have reason to believe that Weath is providing reliable evidence.

This is a presumption.

If your house was robbed irl and the police said well we know it was stolen but it turns out you left a window unlocked so its not really our fault or problem... Have a nice day sorry for your trouble is that ok?

99 slayer grind continues 88/99
---
I have them on 3 accounts lol
---
Why are you quoting this?
---
1.) Also a solution: Put a delay on authenticator removal.
---
Or, to nake your solution much better, let me copy and paste my password into the client so that I can use a password manager like I use for EVERYTHING ELSE. Also make passwords case-sensitive and abme to use symbols to make passwords more secure.
---
3.) They dont need your password. They can recover your account with info any aquantance could know.
---
4.) Everyone who streams DOES have a much higher chance of being hacked. Its ridiculous how high of a rate they get hacked when they're not one of Jagex's golden boys.
---
Looks rectified. Hope they take down your entire account for attempting to scam the system.
---
They always play the G-card when they're in trouble...
---
This game has the best RNG fucks lol XD, Ive tanked thousands of bandos kills and every now and then even if you do literally everything right, he just combos with the minions and clears all of  your food in seconds. 
---
How is this evidence? Anyone could have written that
---
People also do it because there are bots that snatch up names like that, which is why there were people getting banned for hoarding rare names on burner accounts.

---
Don't buy names from sketchy sites.
---
My brain says it should not allow them to enter the portal. Is this incorrect?
---
There's 2 options:
---
1. Get rid of name changes.
---
2. Allow there to be a market for names.
---
So long as name changing is available, there will always be demand for names.
---
The logs even use the same shitty smiley faces you use in your responses. Ok smollett. Relax.
---
I love how they claim that's not them but they use the same emoji style that you rarely see used on reddit and the logs XD
---
why must you rub it in. :( 
---
They won't return it because it'll just be removed again.
---
-Craft silver ware for around 30k starting cash + crafting lvl for amulet of magic
---
- buy runes and staff + hat (port sarim)
---
- safespot zammy monks / wizard for robes for bis mage gear
---
- kill ogress warriors for their rune drops (even starting from lvl 1 magic you will be able to profit / sustain your runes
---
They will also drop lots of law runes, which can be used for crafting/smithing grind later on
---
Don’t be so quick to assume other people aren’t bothered by it lmao. Just because some may be doesn’t mean all, or even most, are. 
---
This is my feel about it all. Back then it was fandom sites and forum chatter. These days information comes from YouTube tutorials which go in-depth and are easier to follow rather than reading instructions.
---
As you can see he handed 300m to a hacker to get that name, and you still think its fine?
---
Are you suggesting a jmod faked logs to dunk on a player that got scammed? 
---
Fuck that. Even if you had the authenticator active they probably still would've got in. Mod Weath just saw the out and took it I reckon...
---
yeah, especially the account owner who in her reddit posts, show a similarity in typing in those chat logs.
---
habits don't change lul :-)
---
I learned today people actually 'buy' names. Kinda dumb tbh.
---
In my situation (playing on mobile and walking out of WiFi range and phone data plan kicks in) 
---
I've had it work like this, and I've also had it kick me out, and when I try to relog it tells me my account is still logged in. Idk how reliable this is?

How would you do the odds of getting two from one room? Cool

You can chin without prayer, so if he has money(solid bet looking at his armor) 99 range wouldn’t even take a week of on/off training

The Jmod message implies a lack of account security, but not active misconduct. Given the current shitshow, something tells me they'll be keeping a close eye on the account anyway. 
---
I like that you give your opinion without answering his question lol

good idea.
---
(but why)
---
She's the best because she bakes really good snickerdoodle cookies

Nope. it's particular to the seed vault.

Nah ego
---
Wait. So did he try to sell it then claim it as stolen? 
---
thank u for ur service
---
This.
---
Rofl Weath wouldn’t have posted it if he didn’t know for sure it was you. You’re full of shit.
---
how about you dont make an easy enough email and password for someone else to guess... this is not equivalent to any IRL crime because its a fucking mmorpg and a display name...
---
&gt;3.) They dont need your password. They can recover your account with info any aquantance could know.
---
How? Are you using real answers for the recovery questions?
---
If you are, you shouldn't treat them like a second password.
---
The price wont change much its been at a stable price for almost 3 months now.

I totally recommend going to 77 straight away, lum elite is one of the best. and it only gets harder the more quests they release.

If you look closely at the way she types in the thread it matches up.  Specifically all of the smiley faces she uses in like every single post appears multiple times in the chatbox.  It looks legit, if she just types a bit more properly here on the internet.  Idk why she's trying to hard to scam the community.
---
We're not 100% but that seems to be the case yeah

Or any company

What are the next planned big updates?
---
good luck with that one my friend. 
---
*obligatory "hates runecraft" hive mind comments*
---
10m to fuck up a pure is a worthwhile investment
---
Some people do this thing where they "sell" the name to someone, get the money and then claim the person stole their name so Jagex gives it back to them. So they end up keeping the cash and name, maybe that's what they think happened.
---
Not sure how you can convince them you didn't do this. 
---
I let you order them as you see fit, rather than imposing an order on them. 
---
I totally thought it was tranny and considered buying...

Then I saw the comment saying stacy and felt dumb.

If you're in a hurry, mole skins and claws is the best way to do it. Over a good amount of time, birdhouse runs are pretty effective.

It's not rapier's fault that bp is too op. It only crashed as a reaction to every cox/rune dragon acc selling it to buy the lance. The fact that it was only being used at cox/rune drags shows you that it's bp that needs to be adjusted, but of course that's the long sincere route that isn't guaranteed to get you your 50m back because it won't have the speculative hype that a direct rapier buff would.

I mean that’s kind of a thing, I once had a debit card stolen and my bank reversed most of the fraudulent charges apart from the ones that were made by chip and pin, because they said the thief must have known my PIN and in that case their policy was not to refund. 
---
Personally I think it’s pretty fucked, obviously they knew my card really was stolen since they reversed the non-PIN charges. Luckily the charges they wouldn’t reverse were only a small part of what the thief took before I cancelled my card.

It's ridiculously easy to track... 
---
Anyone who changes name twice in a row and then sees their old name get picked  by a second account almost instantly most likely just sold their name. This can be disproven easily (in case of someone re-attributing one of their account names to another one of their accounts) by proving you own both and eliminates the chance of false positive.
---
If you don't want to investigate people doing that, then at least do it when the exact same thing happens, but from an unrecognized IP. It's really not rocket science...
---
Why does it seem like the word ''definitely'' is the most butchered word ever? It seems like there's atleast 10 different ways people manage to fuck it up. Truly fascinating.

This is it.

You're actually a moron if you play an UIM and you have this mindset. Literally every single self respecting, non completely retarded UIM would never want the seed vault accessible to them.

That's the best thing you can have in this game and you're worried about your luck for the rest of the year? I hereby sentence you to flax picking for the rest of your bad RNG.

And The Plague isnt real, king Lathas made it up. OP making wild guesses and doesn't know the lore.

Although some people might advise me to just buy a lot, I prefer to buy my snapdragons to be just enough for each of my farm runs (so in my case it's 8 seeds). After a run, I buy in the G.E. the seeds for my next run and store it in the seed vault. I then withdraw all of the seeds for the run when I'm ready which consequently removes the "favorite" placeholder. So my plan for now would be to buy 9 seeds instead so I can just do a withdraw-all-but-one and leave the 1 snapdragon seed as the placeholder.
---
oh my god I have so much bank space now
---
Explain?
---
Cuz he is 40+..
---
Why not just remove the name change feature as it wasn't a thing back in 2007. 
---
It is getting abused with real world trading and double name changing to get away with scamming and not sharing loot in agreed in raids there really is no need to change your account name.

I lost my original account name due to being hacked years ago not that I'm salty as I didn't try to get the name recovered it's only a name but I understand that it might effect others differently.

&gt; Jagex have started a limited trial of returning items to players who have been hijacked, and had their items stolen. We’ve not spoken publicly about this and have been rolling it out very slowly. As we saw with the Archer Rings last night, these systems are quite complex and have some teething issues.
---
&gt; This resulted in a single account being erroneously given several million Archer Rings. Unfortunately, the player in question chose to profit from this clear mistake, rather than take the responsible route and admit what had happened. Our teams noticed this mistake very quickly, and began taking immediate steps to remove the items.
---
&gt; The good news is that we have recovered almost all the Rings which entered the game.

The hidden link thing you remember was Runescape Classic ("Runescape 1"). Runescape as it was in 2007 ("Runescape 2") evolved into what we now call Runescape 3. Runescape Classic was closed and for awhile, Runescape 3 was the only version available. Then, they created Old School Runescape ("OSRS") which was created from a backup of Runescape 2 from 2007 and then developed independently and separate from current Runescape 3.  
---
All the characters from that video exist now only in Runescape 3. You can log in to OSRS using those accounts, but they will be fresh level 3 accounts. This happened to everyone and it's actually not that bad! You can go find your RS3 accounts if you want, liquidate their items, and trust-trade the wealth to OSRS if you feel like it.

youre allowed to sell names per jagex rules. why wouldnt you be able to? you want people to get banned for something thats been legal for a decade?

Any progress from the main/original runescape server (i.e. before 2013) is still there on that server, but it is a separate server from Old School and progress/items are not transferable.  
---
What about clans like hexis where you get kicked if you're not in the top 500 for ehp
---
House tele, spirit tree to farming guild... Not exactly out the way is it 
---
What does that entail? Any news post explaining their plans?
---
Of course it would be the big old USA to agree racial slurs are okay. What a surprise.
---
Well I for one think they do quite a fucking lot with weekly Q&amp;A , posts, reactions here on reddit, poll system (where people are crying about aswell). They get slammed down everywhere. I think they deserve alot more recognition. Your startup is also alot different from a company that size with a fanbase that outspoken.
---
Yeah I've never done that. Never even tried doing that.
---
Why does ur chatbox say green dragon hide 
---
Makes tier6 shayzien the only difference being a +1/2 offensive accuracy bonus 
---
That's not the greatest way to develop a game. 99% of us don't even know the implications of what we want. The court of public opinion is easily swayed.
---
Rofl u/anastasia700 👵
---
I'm not tying him to this... at what point have I said that? you've done 2+2 and come up with 45...
---
That was an example, you stated no accounts had been hacked with 2FA active, I gave you an example. By the way, we still don't actually no the full story to this day, for all we know he may have been a scapegoat.
---
Can you please either end this here or come up with some valid points?
---
also, as someone whos played for longer than 15 years i can guarentee you the name Tracy was not available when he started 15 years ago lol.
---
I completely agree that it should be bannable but I don't think it's realistic to invest resources into each individual case.
---
People could sell their own account names and this wouldn't be traceable. I could message you on a different platform and then change my name, accept your money via PayPal and then you could have the name. How would Jagex trace that?
---
Tfw ironmen think they’re the only ones that use the games content 
---
Which retard gave me gold for stealing someone’s tweet
---
Yeah the clickbait title is really what bothered me. 
---
No it’s not a few people sold their names and got scammed recently and are coming to reddit because they think the reddit hivemind will be on their side.
---
Scapegoat hahaha.
---
There's zero way to know for sure if anything Jagex says is true or not. This company has done nothing over the years to deserve our trust
---
this is one of the most honest ones in the post. 
---
It was a joke bud. If you didnt have an authenticator and bank pin then you've massively decreased the safety of your account 
---
OMFG WHY CAN'T HE SAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT???
---
that is what he is suggesting. 
---
That's actually how banks often work.
---
I'm sorry, do you have proof of that?
---
Why does reddit fall for these people every single time? Literally every single time someone come here to complain about their account it ends up being their fault
---
Please leave.
---
You claim a MAJORITY of people are being hacked thru their 2fa and authenticator. Literally if they wouldn't click phishy links or download fake runelite clients this wouldn't be an issue.
---
Very very very VERY few people get truly hacked 
---
You still cant store saplings and payments so you still have to go to bank to get them. So whats the point of leaving these seeds for contracts in the vault. Dude the vault doesnt help with contracts at all... It only helps ironmen.
---
well I think that it should be bannable, if Jagex doesn't then fine.
---
Stress from quitting rs
---

---
There's two kinds of UIM, it seems.
---
Those who want to take a limitation and break it to the maximum with all given resources possible to minimize the adversity
---
Those who want to embrace the difficulty and savor the additional level of challenge.
---
I remember the first time I tried cocaine. 
---
They hated Jesus because he told the truth. 
---
👌😁
---
I mean theres nothing secret to reveal, their system showed the hacker logged in with the password OP had, rather than recovering the account, as shown by the IPs the account logged in with. I doubt any company is going to leak the ip address of 2 players just to prove a point, probably some legal issues with that.
---
exactly why i'll never play this shitty game mode
---
imagine grinding for thousands of hours just to die to a disconnection
---
g.e. tele is a decent alternative to craft cape and you already have fire/air/runes covered $0.02
---
also, apparently steam runes are the new hot shit for profit. (17m for 50-77) someoen posted recently, but i imagine that as that becomes more popular the profit will drop. 
---
Now we gotta get this second post up to 3k upvotes, round 2 fellas.
---
*initiates slow clap
---
Perm ban this mofo for wasting jmod time. 
---
Nice smackdown
---
In many cases it's worse. The notion that you can decide for others what does and does not have value is absurd.
---
If my car got stolen I would be way less upset about the theft than if my account and all of its items got stolen.  
---
Why, because I value this account more than my car.   
---
The analogies are very accurate, Jagex assures to combat hacking (ie. theft) and cheating and all sorts of destructive behaviour, but when the perpetrator is known, they refuse to act.
---
This wouldn't be a problem if they instead put it honestly  and boldly: we won't do anything if you don't have all the possible security measures. Obviously they wouldn't do this, because this brutal honesty makes them look bad. Instead they can play the after-the-fact game of relieving themselves from any responsibility because ackhthuallyyy we don't do that specific thing.
---
The reddit account associated with the OG post claimed to have a "new and never changing rsn" of Tracy about 4 years ago.  Yet the OG post claimed to have owned the name for the past 15 years.  I think its fair to say the poster is full of shit, and tried to force a name return to later sell the name again.  Not to mention the emojis used in the in-game chat are distinctive and are the same used by the Reddit user (i.e. :-D. =-p, =-/)
---
Hahah dumb cow
---
Seeds
---
Why would I ever give my information for my account let alone a HCIM? I’m also General in my iron CC so you think I would give that responsibility of kicking to someone? This is not true 
---
I agree seed vault is OP for UIM, but can we at least make the seed box lighter? An empty seed box weighs 8kg - the same as my proselyte pl8. :(
---
Best favour would be letting us place our seed box in the vault, but simply making it a reasonable weight would be a huge help. 
---
Just saying I appreciate the work yall do on Reddit. The grand vast majority of "hacks" are from idiots own doing. I've never had pin or 2fa and have never been hacked. Not that hard to use unique password and never give it away.
---
It's still fairly AFK once you've stacked them. NMZ isn't super AFK either unless you're just spamming a bunch of absorbs and not doing anything (rather than the 1HP prayer flicking way).
---
For the best XP, it's always better to do Chins over NMZ Blowpipe (unless you specifically need the points for ring/mask upgrades).
---
I made a HCIM the other day.  Tried to do Waterfall quest and, well, RIP Ice Thrice, 3/26/19-3/27/19, the 2 day old dead HCIM I used a bond on.
---
Decided to make another.  Started walking up to Varrock to train my Attack on the dummies.  Looked down at my phone and must have been seen by a dark wizard.  RIP Oak to 99, 3/27/19 - 3/27/19
---
I’m not sure if this is a troll or not? 
---
It just feels so real! 
---
Thats rather correct.
---
Its not so much as exploiting the mechanic itself. But rather using an alt to change the results.
---
The same way how you’re allowed to have your clan fight in a minigame and you’re freely allowed to win with your clan. But if you use alts to rig the result, you’re breaking rules.
---
With the track record Jagex has. Yeah I do.

Took 15 minutes
---
? Are you really surprised that people do that after all the shitshows they’ve experienced the past few months (years)? Personally I trust employees with inside info more so than some redditor too, but I honestly can’t blame people for being doubtful about Jagex’ ways lol
---
But that’s because thieves get rid of stolen property as quickly as possible if they catch the thieves with your stuff it will be returned. Someone clearly has the username it’s not gone it should be returned.
---
Fuckin Yikes.
---
This guy tried to fuck up a clans whole discord so it's kinda karma lol
---
outstanding
---
Probably one of the people who uses alts to rig DMM.
---
2-ticking tweaks and typing in cc I wanna see that
---
So your reasoning is this: so you think he gave his account name and pass to someone to fake a hijacking so he could sell his name and then have a small chance of getting it back through Jagex customer service? This seems pretty dumb, especially considering how little it would matter if that were the actual case. How do you not see this as an easy win. Give the dude his name back. Hiding behind the fact that he didn’t take advantage of optional services is the icing on the cake. It looks as though the customer service issue is not going away any time soon.
---
How do i get Radimus notes back after I've finished legends quest? NPC i talk to in legends guild doesn't have an option for me to get the notes back so I can't complete it again for RFD subquest help D: 
---
This is something I'm considering. However I can't make any promises at this stage.
---
Let's poll it
---
Thank you.
---
I save them all too!
---
Sad reacts only amirite
---
Welcome, you're part of the problem now :D
---
It gives it 20,000 charges intead of 2,500 charges. Nothing else.
---
I have an S9+ and my interface does not look like this
---
Those who want to embrace the difficulty and *restrict themselves more to* savor the additional level of challenge.
---
I believe that has been there preference since the beginning of runescape, just not as well noticed until the legalization of 3rd party clients. 
---
You dropped these 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Makes me wish I could transfer my username account from 2004 to the account I'm playing now. Stupid decision making a new one before trying to login to the old one.
---
fuck yeah Auron is a beast, ffx my favorite game ever :)
---
Only if we use the twisted bow as a new seed for the twisted bush...

More like every few days

---
I like how I always get the crab song abd some blurry visual effects in my mind when I see crabs emojis and all caps
---
Were you hoping weath would just take a screenshot showing the different IP addresses the account logged into using the same credentials before and after name change? Its not like weath can show is the users password to confirm it's the same between log ins, and giving out ips is a bad idea, just what were you hoping for?
---
It did not come from Jagex, google.
---
Yeah playing bondie scape is a lot more sane
---
&gt;if you use alts to rig the result, you’re breaking rules.
---
...By playing against yourself and winning/losing to yourself. Not by having them on your team.
---
Bringing multiple accounts into Cox/spec transferring yourself/venge-othering yourself aren't exploiting game mechanics despite giving a clear advantage.
---
You've hurt my feelings grammy
---
I am not advocating that saplings should be allowed to be stored in the seed vault, I'm just saying that there are plenty of reasons to not put it in, and "It breaks immersion" is not one of them.
---
Jagex admits OP is a brainlet who has the security mindset of a 5 year old and because of that won't return a name to insecure account*
---
Fuck
---
Largest stack?  Mine is about 400 irit seeds.
---
Most logical way would be: you downloaded a keylogger, then hacker sent you an email with simillar email adress as jagex’s, and you didnt notice it- changed all the info and vuola he has your info.
---
Have a nice day, you
---
You can't double name-change on the website (the hacker would need to wait 30+ days) so they did get access to his account.
---
Just any form of evidence
---
if you've completed legends quest you don't need the notes to be able to enter the kharazi jungle.
---
Offtopic but on topic of my account being hacked, I was a victim of an unfortunate virus, my account got hacked and the person botted on it aswell as changed its name to “NECK MORON” if you would be so kind looking into it, Ive been trying to contact for the past 3 months
---
hahahaha you fucking imbecile just delete your account
---
If you don’t play you can’t win 
---
\#FuckRoTFreeTorvesta
---
Of course. It's not exactly the best wording from Weath's side though. If you get keylogged, it happens. Does that mean you should immediately be stripped from any potential help from customer support?
---
I’ll take it
---
Like using bh points you boosted for on alchs or gp gainz instead of just looting bags and rune pouch. Nothing wrong with boosting bh points also for a cosmetic whip upgrade or  50% spec on msb though.  Big grey area 
---
Yeah I agree, definitely made merching more interesting.
---
Wich is wholesome nowadays
---
hahahahahahahha

yeah 11$ the membership should be 100$ to filter out idiots

Could you please stay professional instead of keeping up this childish show for the toxic community? This is not a private server. You are a real organization handling the data of millions.

Pvp bots are cakled stormtroopers?

In case you are not aware, you can change your bank pin settings so that it doesn’t ask you every time you log out/hop worlds (within 5 min I think). I know it’s not exactly what you’re looking for, but it’ll decrease the tediousness a bit.

Nice...yet here you are on a Runescape topic so it matters to you quite a bit ....
---
The name change system is recurrent I come for jagex, why would they choose to narrow that? 
---
Can’t wait to see the thread titled “hacker permanently changed my name for me”. 
---
Here are 2 reason why I don’t like that idea 
---
This is why jagex needs customer support. If what weath is saying about this guy is true you wouldn't have to deal or comment about the decisions you made. You guys made reddit your customer support and now you have backlash because instead of proving to one person why you choose that decision. You have to prove it to the community and comment about the decision you made. Great game, trash customer support. Jagex deserves the backlash on this.
---
99 Firemaking np gg hf
---
But the guy literally said he's not going for barrows gloves yet?
---
So did the player die or the account? 
---
🐙 I can't find that emoji 🐙
---
According to this policy, I may be able to get my name back as I believe my account was hijacked without my own doing. I would like further assistance please.
---
Maybe my case can give the people of reddit hopes 
---
Love your username!:D
---
🦀🦀JAGEX WONT RESPOND🦀🦀
---
Yeah people who disagree with me are just hivemind sheeple right?
---
Really? What if his email was hacked, the guy got his password from that through whatever means. And then OP had the same password for his account then his email address??? 
---
I'd be ok if they remade the video with octopus instead of crabs.
---
Everything is a 50/50 chance. It either happens or it doesn’t 
---
It's the same stance Jagex have on banks being taken when hacked, they don't return that either. Just fucking secure your account people it's not hard
---
I don’t even remember the last time I lost on the veteran boat. 
---
Pretty fucking stupid and unintelligent meme tbh.
---
Yes, but that information is not normally considered sensitive. I mean I don't feel I should have to hide information such as how long I've been playing the game or when I first got membership, that's a common in-game discussion. Also, country of origin isn't exactly sensitive either. Even moving information may be mentioned in passing to clan mates. 
---
Honestly I'm not aware with any other system that uses this kind of information for recovering accounts, and I think that's with good reason. 
---
What exactly caused Jagex to abondon recovery questions anyway?
---
Yea, sorry that was intended. 
---
First time trying to make video memes. Was it anything specific in the video? After re-listening, it definitely sounds like the tele-block noise was a bit loud. 
---
Mod Weath more like Mod Wrath
---
Getting hacked disqualifies support for lapses in security except when a rogue jmod delivers the smack down to your bank.
---
+1
---
Not specifically for runescape but I like the artstyle 
---
at this point id be more disappointed if everything went according to plan
---
IQ?
---
the fact that we cant get a decent, hard to get off hand fashion item is actually something that bothers me on a regular basis :( 
---
No he didn’t, he said he was going to use that account to try and pvm, that’s not against the rules at all... 
---
You aren't. My mistake. J-mod replied to this thread tho, and still seems sketchy.
---
I was kinda happy seed vault isn't allowed for uim. Not because I'm spiteful or anything like that (I have a uim myself), but because I think seed box is a really neat item and concept and it'd be a shame for it to be completely dead content with uim tossing it.
---
The email you got was actually the phishing link itself. Did you change your pass through the link in that email? F
---
Good thing I can see the results before I vote! 
---
&gt; 4.) Everyone who streams DOES have a much higher chance of being hacked. **Its ridiculous how high of a rate they get hacked when they're not one of Jagex's golden boys.**
---
Can I have a source on the claim in this second sentence please
---
This is NOT me !!! I SWEAR on my LIFE !!!
---
Doing routine scans for malware is an easy way to make sure your computer is free of key-loggers, spyware, rootkits, etc..
---
Just having your account secured with 2FA, bank pin, and strong passwords is essentially useless without using something like MalwareBytes to run these scans.
---
Wait should you not have your RSN as your flair?
---
Imagine this type of response in another scenario ;
---
I can see that you've had some security issues recently and this has resulted in your house being broken into and all of your belongings taken. However, it also looks as though these issues were 
---
The result of you not taking proper security measures and having a posted, armed guard at your residence as well as trained guard dogs. 
---
So we won't be persuing this issue any further. 
---
Yep thats the one
---
You also need to provide the bank PIN to buy or redeem bonds (and OP said his PIN was set up in yesterday's post), so it seems like his PIN is compromised as well.
---
Thank you, this was extremely satisfying to read and my day is saved.
---
Mostly made for ironmen. It is a constant struggle with bank space because of all the shit you have to keep in stock. Seed vault freed up about 30 slots for me. I was already at the limit and im a mid level ironman.
---
&gt; If they can track the items they SHOULD return them.
---
No they shouldn't because thousands of dumb kids get scammed/hacked every day. It's not feasible to expect them to return everyones items. They also shouldn't pick and choose what they return, it's much better for them to just have a no returns policy except extreme rare cases, like Jedgate
---
Ha ha ha ha ha oWHAOW

Most players aren't going to get 99 in a skill. Early unlocks being fast is important because to your average OSRS player, 60-70 agility takes "forever". Most people who care enough to max/get 99 don't care about doing one method from say 80/90-99. 
---
When 1-92 and 92-99 require the same amount of experience, there's only so much you can add.
---
Kind of like growing up IRL ya know? When you're a kid you have a ton of "unlocks". Elementary school graduation, then middle school, then high school and then college. Hell, every year is like completely different in terms of what classes and shit you take. Drivers license at 16, smoke/military at 18, drink at 21(if US), and then it kind of tops off and you stop getting fast, easy "unlocks".

What? When did I ever hint at a JMod being the one stealing it? I simply stated it's a really harsh accusation to say OP gave out his info.
---
a maxed pure costs more than 10m so that doesnt make sense
---
this is great
---
Can I buy your name?
---
Sooo many PVM and Ironman downvoting you. Take my upvotes. Your posts are well thought out and not just a word vomit. I wish Jagex would listen to us pvpers
---
It does cost them in man hours. If they have a "yes we will return your scammed/hacked items policy" how many requests do you think they are going to get every day? Then they have to go through them all and decide legit or not legit. It's just not feasible.
---
Meh, just read your J-Mod smack down, but yeah, massive sucurity breach :') 
---
Hey what's up guys, devil's advocate here
---
Imagine you're Jagex in a situation where somebody is on Reddit asking for upvotes in order for their very specific, definitely legit issue that Jagex hasn't gotten to yet.
---
You have 2 options
---
A. Respond to the post and give the ticket priority because of the popularity, then get accused of using social media as your customer support (Even if you would have gotten to them eventually without social media)
---
B. Neglect to respond to the post and don't give anybody's issues priority due to their popularity, causing the community to simply deem customer support worthless since they didn't address an issue that was highly upvoted, even if you do eventually get to their issue through your customer support process.
---
There is no winning moves here. Look, I know we have a lot to shit on Jagex about, but there's seriously no good way for them to respond to these types of posts, especially considering the comments always seem to assume the poster is 100% innocent and not at fault, despite historical precedence.
---
Honestly both r/whitepeopletwitter and r/blackpeopletwitter are essentially "best of twitter" weirdly split based on the account's profile picture.
---
Im sure if you sorted by new theres a bunch of racism, but the front page is just funny shit said by someone who happens to be black
---
Or Ironmen. Ironman btw.
---
Just saying, this post's OP and the post you linked are 2 different persons. There was atleast 3 different threads of name stealing yesterday.
---
I 100% agree with UIM not getting access to the vault. Part of the game mode is the harshness of it due to lack of space - making more and more things storable (read; STASH units) is not something the game-mode needs.
---
mericRat
---
your game shouldnt force players to use the GE to acquire things because it's too clunky to store them or easily reacquire them.
---
Grats man, now onto ds2!
---
The original post she said she had the name for 5 years. She changed it on RS3, then when Hardcore Ironman came out for OSRS, made an account on there. She's a lying idiot, but this screenshot has nothing to do with that. 
---
anti-d shield only gives partial protection...i've hit 40s on them.
---
Fuck, good thing you put the /s. 
---
I love the idea... I for one know there is a 0% change I will ever change my rsn. I'd love to lock it to my account. I'd actually pay to do it for security to be honest.
---
That’s amazin
---
Devalues my left click only ironman
---
why wouldn't you check the margins before buying so many of an item?
---
[Suggestion] Use runelite 
---
Yeah this proves the PVM mentality. Who cares about clanmanmode? We want our main game fixed not some fake esport attempt. 
---
How can they say it's a myth if there literally is no options to contact jagex on the website and the customer support links you to FAQs
---
So what you're saying is he allowed his computer to be compromised with some sort of malware or he was a victim of a database leak where someone put 2 and 2 together to ONLY log into his RS account and ONLY change the name of his ingame character? Sounds like it's either COMPLETELY OP's fault or someone just shot the moon with some seriously farfetched shit.
---
You can almost entirely cut out the database leak part, it just makes zero sense that a name change on Runescape would be the endgame for the person with his info.

---
On some level yes, but if you have been in internet for +20 years, there is trace of you and because of Jagexs pretty half assed recovery system people can datamine you out.
---
Sure, If I was born today I would be safe if I dedicated my life to be secure in runescape, I can't be 100% sure at this point of age of 26.. or 24.. or maybe I am actually 28, so now this info can't be used against me.

Almost 5k mole kills. That’s the real impressive part. 
---
not saying I don't believe Mod Weath, but how is OP typing in capslock on Runescape?
---
Same person. 
---
If Seeds are added to the 'Favourite' Section, can they also be found under their original section? /u/JagexMaz /u/JagexGambit
---
A search feature would also be handy.
---
But they requested proof....? So he posted proof. Its not like hes just throwing out information for the community's approval. He is responding to the shithead who's trying to pull one over on us
---
Even if they have your password, they should not be able to get access that quickly. Autheticator is a joke. It fills no purpose at the moment.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but, you can't steal a name through the website, if you change your name it gets held for 30 days so you get time to change back, to actually steal a name you need to nameswap twice which requires you to use a bond on the account.
---
Not to pile onto the shit you're dealing with already, but I certainly hope that's not a possibility (plaintext passwords).
---
Runescape hijacks rarely happen trought rats, they are mostly recovered with information about the account owner. How many people know where you live and your name? Year of your account created? Can they guess or even know your ISP (teamspeak, forums). You're age? When did you move last time (you have mentioned about your new school to someone haven't you).
---
Imagine how much your next door neighbour might know about you.
---
People can put things like this together if they really have motive to do so.

Sounds like xp waste

No, I'm not going to downvote or disagree with you. Why? Because you came in with a logical argument and expressed it in a respectable fashion. The other guy was just a dick.  
---
Moving on, yes, I did have some useless seeds like tomato, sweetcorn and all but one of the hop seeds. Had push come to shove, and I needed those bank spaces, I would have gotten rid of them without hesitation.  
---
That being said, the point of this post was about the satisfaction about moving all your seeds (whether you deem the useful or not) over to the seed vault. But, leave it to reddit to nit-pick things that aren't there and make conflict where there shouldn't be any.

You've lost me. Is this not the OP's original post from yesterday that's linked up at the top? He says here the name was the only thing he lost and that he did have a bank PIN set.

What kind of plane is that? Some kind of biz jet I’m guessing?

Yes, but if you already "have been pwned" that info isn't going to help you personally. Unless you are going to reborn and not make same mistakes like.. I don't know using your name.

Yeah and he is trying to pin the blame on the victim and remove any responsibility from himself to do anything. Occasionally this shit happens and customer support is supposed to help you. That's why it's called **Customer Support**. Not returning items is somewhat understandable mostly because Jagex's tools are limited but a name should be very easy to return.
---
&gt;Have better security and it wont happen. 
---
In an ideal world yes everyone should be less retarded and games shouldn't have any kind of bugs, etc. but shit happens and occasionally you need help, this is what customer support is for, when shit happens, because shit does happen. Other games usually have no problem returning items or names in these cases which is why Jagex gets a bad rap because their customer service is sub-par in the industry.

Actually if you read it carefully she claimed she has played for 15 years and owned the name for many years

I'm aware
---
It does exist. You can argue that it sucks but it does exist and should be used before turning to reddit.
---
Because it helps me relax. It's got this elusive, therapeutic quality to it that you can't find anywhere else.
---
Jagex's piss poor password hashing, lack of web 2fa, and no authenticator delay are root issues they refuse to fix and then continue to blame the community and offer little to no support. If you can be regularly DDoS'd by a group of incels who do nothing but play runescape then the security issue is clearly company ended.

Yes but 2004 was 15 years ago and covers the entire scope of time this person could have been referring to.
---
thats not how it works at all
---
This would definitely devalue the seedbox. Maybe make it so the imp has to be combined with the box in some way? Also another pro is that it gives low level seeds more uses. Maybe have the imp switch tastes every once in a while (50 cabbage seeds before he wants strawberry seeds or something)
---
She actually specifically said 5 years for the name once, and that's within reason of 4 years.
---
Tracy definitely got rightfully smackdowned and is in the wrong, but the whole 5 year thing isn't damning at all and goes along with the true parts of what she had been saying.
---
lol kinda reminds me of bill gates paying $500 for a coffee because he didn't want to get up
---
in this case you could possibly consider "rarity" to be demand vs supply, sure there is only one each of tracy and tracy3784782, but the demand for tracy is a lot higher
---

---
I honestly know Tracy/Anastasia700 from swiftirc and she did quit quite a long while ago. I found the post scrolling through the front page of reddit and got really excited thinking she was going to come back..
---
Idk the details of what's going on or how true anything is other than the fact she really is a grandmother. Her son was having a child with someone shortly before she quit logging into irc.
---
I've never had any problems with her stretching the truth or anything similar, so I personally believe what she says. She does not type like the general user you'll encounter, that's true. But it honestly is a she, and she really is a grandmother.
---
Because I use a secure password that I use nowhere else and I don't fall for phishing scams. With all the world hopping I do to buy runes n shit (Ironman btw), the pin would be super annoying especially since the numbers bounce around.
---
With those combat stats, yeah Augury is a definite upgrade. It was one of the first unlocks I got during Zulrah and it saves easily 10 seconds on average each kill.

I’m supposed to complain as a pilot, but thanks and always do!

I mean South America servers are probably the next servers that will be released.  Keep in mind its not as easy as just flipping a switch as they have to lock down server racks that are physically in the area, which could take time.  Wouldn't expect any South American servers for a while; however, as I could see granting better servers for all the Venezuelan Gold Farmers being a huge problem for this game.

it's simple, just buy a red sharpie and draw on your screen where the icon is

bp would be busted in pvp if it's attack speed wasnt nerfed in pvp. upon release it was completely broken. could do the same for SoA? I never actually played then so I dont actually know it's power. but mage could use some love for sure haha

You know I got downvoted into oblivion for calling someone out on that?? Went through this dude's history, talks amazing perfect english everywhere **except** when he is in BPT. And he just said basically that's what everyone does in this sub. That what he was doing wasn't racist, it's just ebonics. Told me to fuck off. Everyone upvoted him.

This is a really funny and great idea, I don't see anything wrong with that
---
They should find a way to deal with their demographic without falling to their level. Can't have a large organization act like a 9-year-old.
---
Anyways, I think the subreddit should be moderated to block threads that belong to the customer support. At least until things cool down. The threads are mostly fake and always consist of throwing shit into one direction or the other. Jagex is at blame until they come along and prove the user wrong.
---
It is sad that the best shot players have for proper support are these threads (if proper support is what you want to call this shitshow). However, all these threads do is increase toxicity and make Jagex fall to our level.

Another player made a post the other day, don't remember where. But they said they waited about 5 minutes between each lap which force spawned a mark every lap.  Do some research on it, you may be able to boost the marks/hr rate if you pay attention to this feature.

They have that sollution, they use Google Authenticator. Doesn't help if they have access to your e-mail tho.

Thank you for appreciating my post and well, even reading it. I tend to assume most people just see a huge paragraph and skip past it lol.
---
It really sucks to see you having to deal with that tbh. It ties into what I was talking about when I said that there's a distinct lack of sympathy over the net. No one has any idea what the person on the other end feels like. There's no facial expressions, no tone in voice, no eye contact. It's almost (and not inherently the same) as if we're talking to an object that has consciousness. 
---
I think if I was to give you some advice to help with your situation, it would be not to quit. If this is something that frustrates you, you'll need to try and overcome it(as cliché as it sounds). There's going to be plenty of people that are dicks in real life and being able to tolerate it on the internet will help prepare for that. After all, their objective is to literally just anger you, right?
---
If I was to make a guess, a lot of people would come out of a situation like this with thicker skin. There are going to be plenty of people that are going to want to shut you down (even more prevalent in certain careers) and being able to deal with these people is a great life skill. 
---
Second part looks like PM's to a friend

Ooo sorry bud, Facebook actually has the most theft and fraud of any site on the internet. Suppose we should shut it down?

First off, Jagex isn't gonna reset his defence to 1. 0% chance. It has never been done before (outside of bugs; not this case).
---
Secondly, if he's been hacked multiple times and continues to get hacked, it means his PC isn't clean. Virus scanners are far from perfect. The only way to ensure it's clean is to reformat the entire system. Delete everything and reinstall.
---
This is pathetic.

---
You don't even need to maintain a separate email account, in my opinion.
---
Just utilize common account security practices... unique passwords, 2 factor authentication, establish a recovery options like an active phone number and/or a separate gmail account that isn't used for anything but recovery, don't be an idiot.
---
&gt; reddit is so disabled they think 2FA has nothing to do with it.
---
If the second dude had 2fa, he wouldn't of lost him name to another account. Either OP bought bonds and changed his name himself, or someone with his password did. In both situations it was OP's responsibility for his account security.
---
People saying that 2fa can by bypassed if you do an account recovery, again, it's your responsibility not to share personal information about your account with people. Having a delay for 2fa doesn't really solve the core issue of poor account security practices with players.
---

I never used OG in my comment. Trust me, I didn't grow up using OG either. 
---
So, turns out I was right and you were lying all along. I like how some of my comments got downvoted before because the idiotic reddit circlejerk/hivemind unironically thinks it's more likely to be Jagex's fault than the player being stupid. 
---
That would actually be amazing. I love the idea of being able to store tree seeds and deposit some money, something like nmz, and have the lady turn the seeds into saplings using up the money that you deposit before hand.  Don't think it will happen tho.

Well since the post asks for feedback, here it is:  
---
The vault is only really useful for ironmen or mains that do herb runs. The two main patches people actually use are trees and fruit trees, and I don't know a single non-ironman that makes their own saplings. The vault really needs to be able to store saplings.
---
DINDU NUFFIN
---
It tells you how many bananas you get for the bones in your inventory, so you don't have to fill up your inventory, sometimes you just get 4 bones and deposit
---
Yeah I cringed pretty hard at that.
---
That wold take over a month for you to do 2 changes..
---
Hahahaha, WAOW
---
There was no personally identifiable information in the logs so what's the big deal? If you cause a big fuss and deliberately waste their time and resources for a bs claim, you deserve what's coming to you.
---
I understand that's your policy, but that seems a rather silly policy. If I get pickpocketed and someone uses my credit card to buy a new computer, I'm not on the hook for that, that's fraud. I get that money back assuming I follow the correct reporting steps. Even if I had my wallet half sticking out of my pocket on the train.
---
they made ironmen because they wanted to be like b0aty, now they are making uim accounts to be like settled
---
You can't, it's parented
---
I think you choose to limit yourself and should accept the inherit risk of those limits
---
Never even knew alting existed, honestly.

Now I understand why the guys in the cc keep asking for +1s. I've got all the stats for that, so I'll do that with them.

I actually really like this.  I play on a normal account and ALWAYS bank all my items before logging out, in fear of someone hacking me and not needing my bank PIN to trade my stuff off the account. 
---
When I was a mod there, we used to perm ban anyone who was confirmed white and using racial slurs. Usually our users would report, but if it was overt, and they had posted selfies of themselves somewhere else on reddit, it was a perm ban. /r/blackpeopletwitter is a medium to showcase black comedians, NOT a medium for middle class white boys to say the n word. Do that shit on the lacrosse field with the other closet racists.

Only .01% of players have ‘desirable names’

Only in the sense that there hasn't been a jagex database leak where there have been email leaks.

I know, you know but clearly the 200+ idiots downvoting that comment dont, every other week theres a shitpost on this reddit about doing shitty google surveys selling all your data for a couple pennies just keep your shit to yourself and have different passwords on your Email and 2FA on there and you wont get hacked.
---
Source? I have a ton of friends with 3,4 and unique names which I bet they want to keep no matter what.
---
We ban for that. Should have reported him

Have I just not noticed it before? I tend to only stick to a few games , and then a few streamers in particular, but this is crazy to me

Yup. https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b6akl1/my_rsn_was_stolen/ejkoeys/
---
Oh, you actually have no idea what you're talking about. Cool. I'll enlighten you. 2fa isn't linked to your phone number. Its just linked to the app on your phone. Two different things, and 2fa can get disabled if they have your rs password. So, if you have your number linked, then you get a text to confirm your changes to your account, not an email. Since email passwords dont apply here, its much more secure. People cant hack access to your phone (or if they can, it would be much harder than getting email access).

I wonder if locking the inventory behind your bank pin when you log in will help prevent hackers from dropping your stuff. Like when you log in, the first time you click inventory you have to enter the pin and then for the rest of the time you're logged in it'll stay unlocked. The interface can be the same as the bank pin

That’s a free 50k loot.  It’s not like they came there to kill you. They came to kill people with more loot, you were just free.
---
It doesn't make any difference. Well, assuming your registered email is different than your login email.
---
What matters is that you keep your login details secret. You shouldn't use them elsewhere. Doing so they can't be leaked and if they don't know your login name/email they won't be able to do anything whatsoever.

Sure, but Jagex stated that they wouldn't return names on compromised accounts since it would be extremely easy for players to just sell their rsn and just recover it.  So regardless, it wouldn't matter for the hacker to spoof the ip then make up a conversation that happens to fall in line with that OP's conversation style.  But you're free to look at the chat log weath posted and make a decision yourself.

* You have a small knit community. Go look at small community's and they all share the things you discuss.
---
* Runescape has fans stretching over 20 years that are now all kinds of ages, at any point this subreddit can have upwards of 85k concurrent viewers. I very much doubt your entire subreddit has 40k total subscribers period.
---
* When you are a moderator and/or Developer for such a large product you have to have a thick skin. You think its bad around here go hang out around Hearthstone, Black Ops IV, or League of Legends Subreddits. They arguably all do triple A content and by the state of those subreddits you'd think the game isn't viable yet each one hosts large prize cash tournaments.
---
* Most of the popular complaints aren't bullshit. Jmod corruption, lack of customer support, Phishing streams, Bad state of DMM, Jmod smackdowns that are inaccurate or wrong, no authenticator delay, poll results still public, ect.
---
* No matter how much the community asks for a response Jagex blows smoke up their asses. Go look at the recent "acknowledging the community" post where the only one that came across as understanding what the community wanted was Mod Ash. The other Jmods go "we don't think we have enough data to support such a change" even though Mod Ash clearly laid it out and they agreed with his explanation.
---
So it's like this Mr. Developer whose got no balls and hides while shit talking to this community in a passive aggressive manner, put yourself in the communities shoes. Jagex make promises that they don't keep. The players ask them straight up questions and they bait and dodge them. When they are forced in a corner you give shady responses like "we need to figure it out, maybe we can run a strawpoll to see how the community feels", even though the straw poll is only polling 10k or so viewers who aren't even Redditors or their website. It's literally just viewers on Twitch, the most small chunk possible of their player base. They use the argument that Reddit doesn't speak for their whole playerbase yet apparently a strawpoll of half of the current twitch viewership counts for a bigger percentage then the entirety of Reddit.
---
If you did all the things Jagex does on a daily basis your subreddit would also have similar issues, but you likely answer things straight up. This is the benefit of being a homebrew developer who doesn't respond to a parent company(Jmods have to answer to Jagex, Jagex =/= Jmods) is that you can be genuine and correct things on the fly. Think about what would happen if you promised 10 signed posters for people who helped support your game via raffle, you do the raffle, then 2 years later never send out the prizes.
---
Or you have 5% of your community being whales and 18 months after product release you start changing things specifically for the whales(Clans), hire developers who specifically make undocumented changes for these whales, and anyone who complains gets ousted from the community because the whales are public enough the community enjoys them.(Likely because they stream if applicable)
---
It's just that you have no spine or backbone and are putting yourself in Jmod/Jagex shoes. They lie and don't deliver on promises consistently. If you ever actually become a big enough game developer to not make throwaways on random gaming subreddits you'll understand that failure to deliver will get the same toxic community you are so proudly bragging about not having.
---
TL;DR: You're delusional and having a bad day personally. You are putting yourself in the shoes of JMODS unnecessarily when you should be putting this anger and effort towards the people who support your lifestyle and focus on your game. Stop being a passive aggressive baby and acting like the Jmods feelings are hurt. The communities feelings are hurt from the consistent lies and propaganda from Jagex.
---
Players just want honesty and a delivery of promises made, both of which Jagex are very bad at delivering at.
---
That is weird, i just got membership for that price, maybe some countries only?

This might seem an irrelevant question, but what made you come back?

You mean some sort of breach or bug within 2fa and such? Doubt. In few days that ive been active in this subreddit 95% of the hack posts were memes. And even the legitimate looking stuff like hack for rsn  ( tracy ) was fabricated and fake. To be frank i havent really seen someone legit get hacked who has all the security stuff active and isnt clicking on random links, thats why i think its unlikely.
---
HAHAHA both of them got the jmod smack down. Piece of shits. 
---
It's because it was a girl. 
---
yea, the drops and subsequently keys were implemented because Konar gives you a specific *location* for your tasks.  This removes your ability to fight stronger versions of that monster (think mutated bloodvelds), and you also lose access to their better drop tables.  so the drops/keys were intended to close the gap between Konar and other slayer masters in terms of rewards.
---
It sounds like you fell for a phishing link. By doing so you give hackers your login details, authenticator and bankpin. They also have your IP address and will force you offline by DDoSing you.
---
PSA: "Double XP" and "streamer quitting" are fake. Those streams will link to phishing links. Same goes for any Facebook ads and what else they're using nowadays.
---
this is extremely weird, i bought the membership on my phone, there it was that price. On my computer it says the basic 9,49
---
Has it never done that in OSRS? Damn. I haven't played RS3 since like 2011. Just took a 6 month hiatus from OSRS and I guess my memory was corrupted. 
---
After posting this for the 5th time I’ve come to this concrete conclusion - 
---
Staking bad, Slayer good 
---
&gt;You're delusional and having a bad day personally.
---
LOL this sounds like projection. 
---
alright what is this meme, i've seen it quite a few times now.
---
This was honestly a way too long way of saying Jagex's game, Jagex's choice. 
---
Ah, naturally 😊 Will likely be once a month or raw footage in a while :P
---
First
---
It was for effect... obviously I removed the placeholders.
---
Konar gives lower level slayer players the ability to make gp at much lower levels than other slayer masters. Having hydra locked to her does nothing other than limit players over 95 who want to do hydra to use her exclusively which is a punishment, not a reward
---
I'm just going to assume that they were gilded after the smackdown and whoever did it laughed their ass off and accidentally clicked on the "give award" button.
---
Thank you :)
---
That’s not what I said though
---
The good move would be to have an actual customer support system rather than just Reddit and twitter ffs
---
Had to take it down because I was in danger of getting a copyright strike. Trying to recoup all the views I lost :/
---
Yours wasnt funny tho
---
Only just recently got rigour for my Vorkath dhcb setup and man. I cannot stress this enough, if you have enough for rigour, get it. Rigour makes Vorkath WAY quicker and i have been getting 4 kill trips consistently ever since
---
You only think that this is the only customer service because its all you see. You are blind to all of the cases that do get resolved through real customer service because they aren't posted to reddit with the frequency of these posts. Most of which end up being lying shitheads using reddit as their last resort.
---
You shouldn't believe what you read on here, it's often the case that people are lying or not providing the full story. So this throwaway email, did you use it for sites other than RS? Seems to me like that may be the source of the breach, especially if you didn't have 2fa on it. Might want to check on haveibeenpwned to see if the email has been compromised.
---
This. Also because one day I *MIGHT* use them.
---
There was just one posted this week
---
Just got a damn nam flashback to my first time getting tb’d and barraged in the wildy LOL
---
The jmods haven't been dishing out smackdowns like except with Tracy and Cigar, but it's hard to discern which ones are legit (except for the obvious like "my account zezima got hacked pl0x halp") but I don't know I feel like something weird is going on. This a weird influx of stuff happening, at the very least.
---
Back to the original question which you still can't answer. Why?
---
The reason buying gold/accs is bannable is because that's rwt.
---
Katakuri approves 
---
There are two possible outcomes from staking. 
---
Lose everything right away.
---
Win some and then lose everything.
---
So that's what happened to Mod Anna/Woof.
---
You and the "other person" both make smileys like this :-P :-(
---
NOBODY ELSE DOES THAT STOP LYING.
---
How did you set a custom flair?
---
I mean this as a joke of course, and commend you for putting in the extra effort 😊
---
:-P
---
This is why I made an Ironman. Nothing was fun when it was just a number to add to my bank value
---
did you use google play credit when purchasing bonds? if you even have a penny in credit it will default to use first, then charge the rest to the payment method you selected. i had this happen and was very confused, i eventually concluded that was the cause.
---
yeah you know what i may have, im looking back and i did look into a streamer quitting... but my authenticator? i didnt put that in cause i was like meeeh this is suspect...
---
Yea i know but my other ones always get banned for posting memes about the NZ shooting lmao. Pretty ironic that reddit is the one crying about pretty much everything. Just for example ROT lives rent free in your heads. Lmao
---
Time to give it up TRACY
---
I just wanted to try the new shit out! it looked so fun... im full on quitting now lol
---
You know you don't need to have a Twitter to read a tweet.. right?
---
The recovery questions are obsolite now. The authenticator replaced them so as far as I know you can't change them and they aren't used in recovering your account
---
You forgot the link m8
---
Tfw when there actually was no collusion 
---
Ehhhhhhheh come on man. If you're implying Jagex has another rat, then sure you can compare to the two scenarios. Based off what we know, Jagex doesn't have a rat, and OP is just another brainlet posting on Reddit to generate a massive circlejerk against Jagex. I would second that most of these posts are OP's fault, and Reddit users blindly agree and blame Jagex. Just secure BOTH your EMAIL and RS ACCOUNT with 2FA and don't be stupid. Source: I'm secure, and not a brainlet.

Apparently you care, you brought it up:

---
imagine typing this out and thinking, "heh got him"
---
I watch a lot of those scam baiting phone call vids and she types just like those Indian scammers talk. I suspect some sus shit is going on here. 
---
😂😂😂😂😂

Those two don’t have the wonders of teleportation 
---
hi yes i am in this mans clan he is tell truth 
---
How can you even deny the rest, as if jagex didn’t have two massively game breaking bugs in the past year alone as well as one of their own employees go AWOL and start hacking paying customers. After all the bullshit that has happened this year it really baffles me how people continue to defend jagex. 
---
" now that people have caught the fact i use emojis, i'm going to make the claim i use DIFFERENT emojis to prove my innocence!!!!! "
---
Jagex has already made their judgement, you're not in talks with them. 
---

Actually, sim swapping makes it pretty easy to recover accounts that use text as a recovery method. A little bit of social engineering and you're in.
---
I fell for a phishing site cause I'm dumb as fuck. Just was logging in to what I thought was the normal rs site. I typed in my email and password and realized it was fake when it asked for my bank PIN.
---
The next day my account was locked by jagex because they said they suspected the account to be compromised.
---
I went into my account settings and changed my password, verified through email and everything. Logged back in through my authenticator and new password and it worked.
---
Seemed to work out. I've had no problems since (been a week). Should I be worried about potential future account compromises due to this? 
---
Cardi B rules for this
---
Shut up grandma. 
---
Your point being that your head canon is the determining factor in runescape banking mechanics?
---
Shit like this makes me feel like the playerbase is a bunch of children and Jagex mods are the immature teenagers baby sitting them.
---
I don’t think the Jmod would have posted that before making sure the ip matches the owner of the account. 
---
Normally I'd agree, but when you submit a ticket they say they'll reply in 48 hours and it's been a wee bit longer than that now.
---
Yeah, but the reasons so far have been "She tried to sell her name and got scammed" and "He didn't have 2fa and may have given out his own info". At the very least, they've had jmod replies giving them a definitive answer, which is far more than I've managed in the past 3 months. All I want to know is what was offensive so I can set a new name and avoid whatever got me done in - If they review my account and decide "Hey maybe that's not actually offensive" (Like what happened with Ma Shnibbla), then it'd be great to get the name back. I've definitely been toxic when people have crashed me, but I would've thought that would lead to a mute and not just a removal of my name. 
---
Honestly I played maybe 10 minutes of it. I was 10 or 11 and a friend showed me the game. It didn’t interest me much. A year or so later the same friend showed me rsc and I was hooked. Go figure. 
---
There's an old image of someone saying, "If you type your password it shows up as stars! *****" and a noob responding "hunter2"

I work at a bank and that is my department. Visa tells us if they use the chip, and the pin, no refunds can be given to protect the merchant. We process probably close to 50,000 claims a day ranging from 0.00 to beyond. There is a good chance a larger bank will refund you anyways, but if you continue to make 'suspicious claims' we send a message to all financial institutions to disallow debit cards and credit cards using VISA.

This is the first time since this meme took off that I’ve seen it actually follow the original format. At least something positive came out of this thanks Tracy 
---
Yeah if everyone stopped playing I'm sure they'd hire a customer support team and not just gut the game with MTX to squeeze out the last of its worth. 
---
That wouldn't be a QOL, that's just speeding up the rate in which you can do a farm fun.

Streamer favoritism

It was not stolen. It was removed because you were inactive for several years. 
---
Its likely taken since then, if not you should be able to re-set your name to your old one. If it doesn't work try capitalizing a random letter, I believe that will trick the system in to believing you're changing your name.

I’d like to point out any rs gold website either sells information or phishes you.
---
I’ve never fell for phishing attempts but I only registered that Email with rs &amp; gold sites. And I get 10-20 phishing attempts from “rs changed pass/banned emails lol”. I’m convinced bogla is the culprit as that’s pretty much the only one.
---
Just a PSA.
---
I even told the customer support to F off and stop attempting to spam me. I even click on the links and type “fuidiotfortryingtophish me” on user /pass .
---
Never been phished ever and won’t ever be, jagex doesn’t email you #1. #2 I never log into sites on phone, use pc and manually log into whatever site rather then through email.
---
Add authenticator to your email
---
I doubt it. 
---
Check your account's security regardless.
---
Are you asking a question? Because the answer is no, that's not the only reason. They know all the cards in the game as well as which cards work well together. They know how to build as much consistency into their decks as possible and how to play should they get sub-optimal hands and draws. Amount of games played certainly plays a part in their rank but it would be foolish to assume they are consistently in the top tiers of ranks simply because of time invested.
---
I think there's a section on the site about changing emails that you no longer have access too, I can't grab you the link right now though.
---
If it's her email and she owns the email then it's her account. 
---
Intellectual property and physical property are not the same. The TOS states you are borrowing IP and own nothing at the discretion of the company. A car you very much own.

DeviousMUD is a way better name than Runescape!

I think you may have other things to worry about like your daughter

Nah but the devs of Runescape sound dope :)

Who cares about those people? Buying names is against the rules, so why should we give those people protections?
---
I won't, I stopped playing once I realised I didn't want to grind before I could do anything that wasn't boring.

Barrage him and step away 
---
I think it would be beneficial if they were actually faking hijackings and recover them though? Wouldn't that just completely destroy the market for trading names? But that isn't in the interest of jegpix
---
Uh I wonder if anyone else submitted bug report for the ghost disciple change - but it definitely feels like that I have now contributed to the game :D

lesson learned: don't be toxic with in-game chat, it draws attention to other things (your name( that they might have just ignored if you were a nice player.

Please mate if you could

Changed pass, got authenticator on email and acc, and pin set. Not sure what else I can do.
---
Suggestion.. Make bp only ranged weapon. Derp
---
Seriously. It was well thought out. They pulled alot of different appeals to current emotions and topics on the subreddit.  
---
For example: 
---
1. Claimed to be a grandma to get sympathy.  
---
2. Claimed to have used Runelite for the first time the day before. This is a common debate topic over if runelite is safe or not. 
---
3. Claimed that the name was stolen by a 1 def pure. This sort of appeals to this subs hatred for pvp.
---
4. Claimed they thought the name was "OP" and liked it alot. This is the most clever. By continuously using this they really make you think it's legit. 
---
5. Claimed Jagex was doing nothing and that appealed to Reddits agenda again.
---
I'm already Tracy
---
So you give them the 10m and they still pk, thats kinda stoopid
---
Because they put more effort into trying to maximize their luck than everyone else. You can build a deck as best as you can, but you can still lose because of unlucky draws
---
Everything is in hand with my daughter with things going my way,

Is there a way to do the Earth Warrior slayer task without going to the Edgeville dungeon wilderness? I know it’s not very deep wilderness, but it’s still wildly nevertheless, and I’ve had people try to kill me every time I do this task, which I get from Vannaka (currently cl66 w/ 49 slayer). I don’t even have great loot or anything beyond rune plate armor + rune scimmy, but people target me every time I get this task. 
---
Well deserved. My grandma loves this game she uses mobile every morning while reading the paper
---
Yes, they have an interest in protecting their customers(assets), which they do.. WITH AUTHENTICATOR.
---
Of course it's victim blaming. But I wouldn't blame the victim of a robbery because 'well you took the job in the supermarket!', because that is just retarded. I don't think you actually believe that a victim can never be blamed, you're probably just virtue signaling.
---
If phising is running rampant, you don't try to reverse phising cases, you try to fix it from the source. Meaning you have to make less people fall for phising, and then you can start looking into reversing it. The number of phished accounts would plummet if jagex forced every account to have authenticator as well. 
---
Maybe you just wanna create work out of thin air, and waste resources for everyone?
---
It wasn't removed for inactivity, I haven't even had the account long enough for it to have been part of that purge. I was playing on the account actively up until the day it was removed and the name has now been completely taken out of the game

&gt; My email password is also the same as my runescape password but luckily I didn't have 2fa so the hacker couldn't disable my authenticator. 
---
Checkmate, hackers.
---
That could be considered, but I'd rather focus on the posts themselves more than the users. The rules tend to be impartial to whether someone is right or wrong; like even if someone is fair to call someone out on wrongdoing, it will likely still be removed for breaking the rule whether we agree with it or not.
---
So having something be allowed or bannable based on an outcome we can't control is iffy. And we have seen a few cases were someone makes a post, a J Mod says they are lying/wrong, and then later they make another post where it was resolved and it seems they were right. So I'd rather move that whole back and forth off of this subreddit than just making smackdown result in a ban from the subreddit. But it is possible such posts could fall under existing spam or trolling rules depending on how the users go about it...
---
Seems suspect

Are you bipolar or something? You talk differently every hour or so. 
---
You've got it completely backwards my friend. TCGs are not about maximizing your luck; rather they are about minimizing the amount of rng you are forced to rely on in favor of consistency.
---
Generally we don't need to parse kills individually and can just count the total number of battlestaff drops, dust rune drops and ashes drops and compare the total numbers.
---
For more complicated drop table this isn't the case and we'd have to handle the data differently though.
---
Hope that makes sense

They should perm ban the account. It's RWT.

I enjoyed the video about the BAFTA award, nice one.

The dhcb is lower dps. Thats expected. Using bp to woox walk on the acid phase is the only real big thing that can speed up kc. YOu shouldnt avg 3mins with 99 range and rigour even without woox walk
---
I’m at like 103 cb and like 42 qps. Fight my no fire cape nor barrows glove havin ass, bitch
---
Toure absolutely right but I got barrows gloves and can't be bothered to continue questing. I'll probably go for the 5th block spot when I continue slayer 
---
It would be nice of jagex had that stance on it instead of it being a “gray area” 
---
Shut up Tracy 
---
Reddit still hasn't hidden upvotes
---
Empty threats, people are bored and need something to entertain themselves.
---
1-90m with 99 slayer &amp; 99 prayer, 90-150m at pest control med boat, 150m-165m at twisted banshees, 165m-175m at gargoyles and 175m-200m at ammonite crabs. 1.3 million broad bolts used from 1-175m range and I used bone bolts for the rest. There has been no chinning on this account. I have 80 hunter.
---
All we need is Settled and a J Mod to appear and we have the Holy Trinity.

IF you are going to casually afk melee slayer you might as well use konar... thats fine

1) turn attack options off

Maybe because back in the day you would get banned or muted for practically anything? I was muted for talking about youtube, banned for “cutting gems”? Now people can talk about pornhub and “double money” and face no consequence. There’s your real answer.
---
This community is trash. Just look at the amount of people willing to be slimy just for pixels. 
---
🤔
---
Because I need 3 crafting levels and like 5 hunter levels to be able to do MM2, which I don't want to do at all but heavy balista would be nice for pking.
---
Torvesta getting DQ’d is always brought up in those discussions however. In Alkan’s new video he says that’s one of his main talking points. I agree there’s way bigger issues in DMM, but the community seemed to really react specifically to the Torvesta ban more than everything else. In my post I even said that I’m glad they’re overhauling DMM because it’s so broken. I completely agree we should switch our focus off of the Torvesta thing because we don’t even know what happened
---
WAIT? so the guy that stole the name gets to keep it becuz you fucked up by not securing your account? thats like saying the bank robber gets to keep the money cuz the bank didnt have armed guards to protect it.
---
I don't doubt that they probably did at some point, but I really doubt that they still would. Like you said, the password is probably just normalized (converted to lowercase or whatever) before being hashed. Though, this is still really insecure as it would reduce the keyspace massively.
---
I mean, it's tagged as humour, his rsn is delusionaltwat and he's pretty much broken every safety measure available lol. Idk man seems pretty authentic to me.
---
If they cannot locate it, they won’t. If they find it, they will 100% return your property. If it’s already been sold, you or your insurance sues the thief for payment. If they catch the thief with your property, of course they’re going to return it..
---
Holy shit lmao
---
Molly might help.. the random event i mean
---
Only 86 range and no rigour. Def gonna try walking with bp instead of dhcb. I guess the biggest advantage for dhcb is kills per trip then from praying range instead of mage right?
---
what makes you think it's stored in plaintext instead of being converted to lowercase before hashing?
---
Exactly.
---
I'm making a second version of this one right now that's a few seconds longer. Unfortunately, I wouldn't really call myself a professional meme'r yet as I don't use always use top end applications; however, hoping this next one turns out just as good as I've tried adjusting the volume settings on it quite a bit.

yes it won't, with the attitude you currently have

ok one question: what was the name they removed?
---
Most of the big emails throw it in your face. Gmail and outlook are the two email services I use and you'd have to make it an effort to avoid setting up 2fa.

No idea lol, convince Settled for his next series, no quests that include deities and no prayer leveling xD 
---
I know a girl on rs with the same situation. She told me her ex was recovering her other acc over and over. 
---
Why though, logging in to a changed setting is a bug. Thats something that never has happened to me in over a decade of playing on a pure. When you get 60 attack your setting never changes again. So I was a perfect candidate for their mistake because I afk, so I don't deserve a roll back? I'm trying to understand the log but I really can't.
---
You do know you can toggle that off, right? 
---
Then they wouldn't have your password.
---
Problem solved.
---
Grats! How hard was the fight at your combat stats? I'm slightly under you but I thoought I'd have to train to base 75's at least
---
This would be way funnier if it weren't so true.
---
You can also dhcb wooxwalk, it just takes a little more finesse than bp wooxwalk imo. 
---
Jmods posted the chat transcript of the tracy "grandma" who was getting offers for over 200m for the name. Sad everyone jumped on jagex for that one.
---
Then you made a mistake, the guy had a great point 
---
Irrespective of it all, a Jmod smack down is entertaining, I don’t mind 
---
Hmmm, don't know
---
LOL
---
these troll posts are so lame
---
No, but jagex TOS does say they can terminate an account at any time with no reason. I vote for the ban.
---
I think the same idiot tried something on me and I wasted their time too. I remember the name send packets 
---
This pleases me! 
---
How ironic, so this is how you loss your rsn. 
---
its the last tournament they’re doing this way, so I don’t see the issue of them issuing a warning
---
Then why did you type it that way?

I feel bad because even if you prove it you won't get it back

Yeah. You take substantially less damage which means more kills per hour and more relaxing vork kills generally.
---
Its for people who do a lot of contracts. You need a lot of random seeds for them. So you can just store the seeds for contracts in the vault. Keep your tree saplings/herb seeds you plant in the bank still. Unless you start your herb run from the guild, then go ahead and leave the herb seeds in the vault too. 
---
Nice, silver lining!

my older brother and his friends played in like 2003, I was 6 years old, saw them play once, and the rest is history baha
---
Nice hp
---
Im well aware, just rare is not the right word
---
Further confirming my belief that 90% of all these posts on here about how "i was hacked pls help" are bullshit. Yet you all fall for it everytime. 
---
Why do you need to withdraw every single one of your seeds to begin with? 
---
I hate women so much ughh
---
Why are you referring to yourself in the third person? If your name is in fact Tracy? That's fuckin weird bro
---
Opening twitter from reddit on my phone always fails first time and I have to close the tweet and reopen it. Idk might be the same for you

You're absolutely right I didn't think to critically about the proper words at the time of the post

Would a right click option "Add to seed vault" be able to be given to seeds that are in your bank? Would prevent future back and forths between bank and vault as you obtain seeds.
---
For 2m gp, yes
---
yeah, I know. BUT if I was botting those three times, why did my perma ban get reversed twice? :P
---
It'd still be unimpressive, lol.  Equivalent of maxing an Ironman.
---
HCIM Drops &gt; HCIM Total Level, any day of the week.
---
A HCIM with all Wildy achievement diaries done is far more impressive than any 2277 HCIM.
---
Ah yep they definitely do try and push their own auth app. Maybe it's the web version I was using at the time but I got prompted to add phone based 2fa every time I logged in.
---
Either way, the point I want to make is you should always go looking for and setup 2fa on anything of importance. And emails are always one of the "recovery" methods, so you definitely wanna secure them.
---
If for some reason you're using a dated email that doesn't provide a good 2fa service.. change it. Gmail and outlook are both free and provide them, and there is free password managing apps like LastPass that can help you have unique and complex passwords without much hassle at all.
---
I've seen enough of these threads to realise some people think it's Jagex' responsibility entirely for them to secure their online identity.
---
&gt; chat logs weren't posted though, a reddit comment was posted, if they can show the comments, why can't they screenshot the ACTUAL chatlog
---
Because you can make that shit to your liking in fucking paint and it wouldn't add anything at all over what has already been said. Fucking think next time before you post.
---
If you want to reach a broader audience and be taken seriously, you have to offer some type of respect to the reader, even if you don't think they deserve said respect. People will never be interested in how accurate your point is if they feel like they're being vilified or attacked.
---
I think what happened is that while your point is true, a lot of people enjoy Settled's content, so reading something that they might also agree is true but don't want to believe, is often off-putting to the reader and will turn them away from your message. Keep your head up friend.

Nah, Jagex deserves pitchforks and torches everytime.

Jagex - 2019
---
That doesnt prove anything though, it's basically one word vs the other. This isn't blatantly Jagex's fault man. Read it without bias. I'm not a jagex ass eater but they always own up to their fuck ups, even if it takes longer than we like.
---
What were the price differences? Don't really play dmm

Fuck you

Yeah that's why it's only a minor issue for me

Sounds way better than my method, definitely going to do it differently, but as I said, I haven't been to rev caves much at all so I didn't know
---
It’s being worked on - hopefully it’ll be fixed before the week is out 
---
Most of the upvotes were before jmod  gave us the info, so i think it didnt make much of an impact, especially when everybody started to meme about it and make posts. It is a meme and it was made for comedic purpose, but it raised awareness aswell. :) 
---
For gold on an iron man see skill: Slayer. 
---
How about your irl life? Can you say its decent? LMFAO.
---
Of course it doesn't.  But Tassies on a HCIM?  Very cool.  Very impressive.  HCIM rocking rune platelegs and fighter torso to Max?  Snore.
---
My brother and his friends played it way back, and I got hooked. Took a really long break and then came back when I found out how great mobile is. (afk at work yeaaah!)

Yeah its like going to the doctor and saying " doctor, im sick" and getting replied with " oh just stop being sick" (just adds salt to the wound is what im trying to say)

Just for you ;)
---
I bet half the dudes in there new exactly where that song came from 
---
Long term, really. Might just go for 87/87/87 and start farming them. I'll probs be using justiciar (minus the helm). Bandos is an option aswell
---
No, next Friday. 
---
Lol ur stupid. Learn to sell names it’s not hard. 
---
fucking christ how dumb is (s)he 
---
There is content put in the live game that you can tell was not tested thoroughly, if at all. I'm not a software developer or test engineer but I work with them, there is no way remotely competent testing would let things into the game that jagex does.
---
Don’t die

There were about 10 jed posts with the tbow stache after the farming guild grow your own tbow update
---
We never know if they're actually telling the truth.
---
My original account got banned simply because I logged in my friends wifi after his account got banned for goldfarming (the ban on his account got quashed 3 years later but they're adamant I'm a goldfarmer). 
---
Probably time to make a new account, people can already associate this one with stupidity
---
No you don't, i have neither and have changed my name on mobile... gf me about to get hacked

People have been asking for better account security for fucking ever. I honestly can't think of anything with a higher priority yet they continue to not give a fuck. 
---
Not really, you're paying for a service, that service being protection from pkers. It's not as if they go out of their way to target you if you don't pay them.
---
They wont admit they were lying because how could they possibly admit that they fucked up. Tracy was wrong? No no thats impossible.
---

---
Bank your items
---
The full justiciar set is used for the damage reducing effect, without the full set Bandos would be better for higher DPS. Also you could try them at 87/87/87 but without lance there are better alternatives for money. 
---
wut about dust devils!!!!
---
There were some instances probably like 3-4 years ago where people would get wrongly perma banned and they we're only able to get their account back by posting here.
---
Since then, a lot of people think they can just pretend to be hacked to cover their tracks for something else and those people should be despised because they know full well that they are just wasting everyone's time including the Jmods.
---
Morytania
---
You aren’t even over drop rate yet lol quit crying
---
&gt; You still need to bank for all your teleports
---
There is a bank 3 steps from the seed vault, why would you need to bank mid farm run for anything?
---
Does anyone have updated info on the mechanics of deadman?  I played the first few seasons but hear a lot has changed, like teleport mechanics and a universal drop table with PvP weapons?  Anything else significant I should keep in mind when I play the new season?
---
Yeah JMods would definitely make up fake messages and provide them as if they are real.
---
Which retard censored the word we still all see?

When I was a kid I was playing Mario kart on my game cube and my dad came in and said I play pussy games and made me mine for 5 hours on his runscape account

Thanks! What would you recommend?
---
Can we also ban the idiots from this sub when they do crap like this?
---
Exactly, every single one of these "i got hacked and got x stolen" threads turns out to be some asshole or idiot or idiot ashole who either doesn't have any account security or a brain and wants to borrow an army of reddit children to brigade against jagex. They literally got people here to believe authenticator is useless within the last few days.
---
Let's not forget that you can sign into the website without the authenticator, so that's also an issue. 
---
They are normally pretty helpful about this.
---

Its not a blog post, it was the game update post IE, it got released lol

His post is superior, yours is old and forgotten, sorry.
---
That's only if you have desert hard done
---
Without that, I found it best to make all unf first; less thought required.
---
Wow you sure told me big boy xD!!!
---
Good question
---
Did you make an account just for this
---
Yeet
---
The runescape birthday sword? 
---
I think it casts slower on auto cast, so might be a disadvantage for the people who use it? 
---
Its definitely not plain text. 
---
If you ever coded a runescape private server you’ll know that passwords in the char files are almost always hashed and letter case doesn’t matter. So my assumption is that there is definitely got to be a conversion of sorts happening before the hashing. Obviously this is all speculation, but thats the best we got until a mod leaks that info (which they wont)
---
Key thing to remember here is that this was a children’s game back in the day. So there wouldn’t have been a demand for crazy security measures as well as a need to simplify things. Because 10 year old us would have never considered case sensitivity. 
---
Yea, you're right, just maxing an ironman, nothing impressive. 
---
Please upvote this.
---
&gt; Imagine thinking PvPers actually like deadman.
---
Classic strawman right there folks
---
Wow i've been not getting the drop the whole time, why didn't i try this???

I will buy for 5m

I'll sell the name HCIM DID 911 for 10m of anyone wants it.
---
Thank you for your response man, I didn't take into account ironmen in the making of the thread but I will try and give you a proper response.
---
I do believe that the prices are high but still, ~100k for ironmen isn't completely unobtainable either. Also, combat bracelet wouldn't be useless because they also have an attack bonus and teleports.
---
Climbing boot nerfs would'nt really affect ironmen that much. +1 strength bonus isn't a lot and it also gives them +1 attack bonus.
---
Maybe nerf hunter's crossbow too? I do think it's strong too atm for pvp.
---
I wish all content creators were this transparent :/
---
I really like this

Smackdowns seem pretty unprofessional, but honestly I don't blame the Jmods given the amount of shit they get whenever some scumbag makes one of those threads.
---
Is it possible to drop trade fully repair barrows gear? 
---
Did you ignore the *no quest seeds* part of the update.
---
Trading names isn't against the rules. It's an at your own risk aka trust trade.
---
have you tried messing around within castle wars, or clan wars? it is full of people hybridding, pking each other, getting piled by enemy clans.
---
i know pvp can be daunting, but there are 'safer' options, literally. i only ever pk within castle wars because i am scared of going in the wilderness, but i am quite good in terms of how good you can from within practising in that environment.
---
Yeah, it's wonderful
---
i concur, forever doing it on mobile. would be a brilliant QoL update.
---
You don't. My point is that banking and then doing your farm run is less work than banking, going into your seed vault and then doing your run. 
---
Also it forces you to start your run at the guild bank which can be inconvenient. 
---
&gt; It is an OP/ rare rsn
---
&gt;OP
---
WHY DO YOU KEEP MISUSING THAT?
---
emojis and way of talking are identical/ very similar
---
Oh I did, you word things extremely poorly if you already tried downloading and using the official app from the app store. If you are bent on not updating your iPad or just not using the official app, use TeamViewer or another generic service. That kind of work around is basically unplayable for anything other than easy skilling, especially without tap to drop
---
Im not even sure at this point. Its sad that you even have to make a post like this for fear of being hacked
---
I remember when I walked in on a housemate drawing explicit my little pony scenes in Photoshop, he was also wearing a latex horse mask with his shirt off while skyping someone that looked underage (under 16 here in the UK).
---
I stopped reading after "every single"
---
No, just like the mafia they will "protect" you for as long as they think they can continue to leech money off of you. When you are no longer paying for "protection" they will kill you. Which is why its extortion and not just a bodyguard service, the people they're protecting you from is really themselves and not other players. 
---
Because why pk for money when you can just threaten someone and achieve the same result? 
---
Yo settled start a patreon you sick beauty.

I'd say that is like 90% chance against the rules except modmatk exists.

Tbh regular upload schedules are boring af and usually produce worse content.
---
can we get a /u/Zuhaar piece of this
---
what the fuck do you know about any of this lmao
---
This so much. When he said at some point I think in the last episode it was 80 hours worth of content I was a bit horrified. Not that someone would spend 80 hours in a week playing RuneScape (I mean, that's definitely not healthy, but not gonna tell someone how to live their life)... But that he probably felt forced to play that much to keep up the pace people were expecting. 
---
On rs3 you need your pin for any dangerous content including entering the wilderness, staking, or dropping items. I'd love a similar system here. It's optional there too so it could be a toggle. 
---
I saw this post earlier is this a reposti or are you the same guy?
---
Revyew only UIM btw
---
GoT and those shows both do the same thing. The difference is how they do it. That how is what puts GoT above the others on a nearly unimaginable scale. GoT’s first 4 seasons on their own would easily be one of the top 5 tv shows in the last 20 years. Anyone can see the difference in quality. If you can’t then that just complete discredits you in any conversation about determining quality.
---
I’m not going to explain what’s self evident simply because you’re choosing to deny it.
---
It’s not about innovation. There’s no real such thing as innovation in any media. The fact you think that’s relevant just shows your lack of knowledge. It’s about execution. There’s been 1,000’s of fantasy novels. Most of them are basically the same thing. What changes is how they execute those same things.
---
Harry Potter doesn’t execute them well. It’s not unique either. It’s not well written. 
---
Serves you right.  Shoulda sui'd ur hc status too.  Oh well, at least we got your Discord account banned.
---
Fuck man I literally just scrolled through mad comments to find this. Good looking out for everyone else
---
are you calling me sad or calling account security for runescape sad?
---
Can confirm, rocking the name of my girlfriend
---
No. People assumed jagex fucked up like they always assume despite most of these huge threads eventually being proven that the OP is a shit head. 
---
Omg amazing

I guess they won't return it as a form of punishment? In life there's no redo button my friend. Better secure up or get f*cked XD

Fucking LOL
---
if you want to do barrows i'd suggest doing underground pass for the iban's staff. fire blast is a pretty weak spell.  
---
if you don't want to do the quest if you 55 slayer, magic dart is also an option.  
---
it's still doable with fire blast but your runs will be slower because of the lower damage of the spell.  
---
your stats are fine, as magic is the main combat style in barrows and you only need 50 to use iban blast which is the typical budget option.  
---
you'll be using magic against 5 of the brothers and ranged vs the 6th, for him you'll be fine with a magic shortbow (imbued) and rune arrows. bring a ranging potion because it'll save you prayer from killing the brother faster.
---
rune armour is fine because melee armour is only needed for tanking the monsters in the tunnel, and they don't hit that hard anyway.
---
Don’t do this to us. We’re like raccoons, Settled. Give us a taste of cat food and soon we’ll be back for the whole cat
---
Nooo, its sad that account security is lacking and people fear being hacked so much that posts like this even exist
---
Lel 
---
Okay I'll bite.
---
How exactly will you get access to his account?
---
You don't seem to have any important information like passwords. Therefore you're unable to login to his registered email, let alone recover the account through the recovery form.
---
Not to mention that Jagex is not responsible for keeping your friend's information safe. That's entirely on your friend. If he chooses to give out his information and compromise it, that's his problem. 
---
So please explain how Jagex's recovery system is shit. 
---
#WHAT?#
---
So it's one rule for some and another rule for others when these streamers are meant to be the ambassadors of the game and She is just allowed to gain 10s of subs a day from this? 
---
Is there any way to report it?
---
Moonlight uh

People make cannonballs and other things to help maintain membership.

In all fairness that could easily be the hacker typing that shit so if it’s looked into it just looks like it was sold but probably not likely
---
They’ve said they are working on it still and it takes a while because other more pressing issues, but they plan on fixing this kind of thing when the other stuff is settled, iirc.
---
turns out I got hijacked and they bought a bunch of bonds 😭
---
Neither I just checked to see the new episode when I got to work but I saw it wasnt up so I googled his Twitter to see if anything was up 
---
You gotta remember that for a long time runescape only 'allowed' you to have one account. This was relaxed a little and you were allowed multiple account so long as you didn't log in at the same time or trade (or something like this). 
---
Of course the above weren't really enforced, but that makes the membership structure make a bit more sense. 
---
Multiple Alts: At one point had 8 alts and my main all members at the same time. Paid the membership cost and only really did that during times when I had annual leave or a work schedule that allowed me to play a lot (and in which case I'd AFK money-make on most of them or half and train the rest). 
---
Perhaps if you break down the cost on a per hour played or total enjoyment it would be much easier to justify that $22. Also remembering that if you're playing more than a few hours a week your alt should be able to make some money on the side to either help fund itself or to funnel GP back to your main (essentially to get the best value for money).

It's the nature of reddit karma. Most people you see commenting enjoy getting positive karma. They see other people using words, it reminds them of something; a reference. References are funny, cue laughs, upvote. Follow suit. A cog in the karma mill.
---
Same. Was fine until the update where they said the bug was fixed 😂

Surely what is ultimate proof is if they show that her IP was the one that said that chat..
---
But then there's the issue of whether her computer was hacked, had spyware which allowed the attacker to act like her and then plan this crap all out. 
---
The latter option seems faaar to sophisticated for an account name steal tho 
---
Thank you for your kind words and good feedback!
---
I'll try to include that a bit more and see how it goes next week (especially since it can kinda change the context and each Jmod does have their own opinions). 
---
Only thing is like with real life discussions they tend to build and add onto the answer with back-and-forths and it's nearly as if they've all said it.
