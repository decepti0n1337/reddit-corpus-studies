Are you okay, guy? You keep acting like I'm trying to censor people on this subreddit, whereas I've now repeatedly said my gripe is with using a tournament as a means to virtue signal. A gaming tournament is no place for that topic.
---

---
Like, I get that you're trying to strawman the shit out of me, but usually you strawman someone by exaggerating what they say. Not by making up random shit nobody ever said, and then continuing to insist they said that when you're called out for your bullshit.
---
---
---
Grow up
---
It's pointless trying to argue with an idiot, You'll never win, Brother.
---
Did you skim over the part where I said his 30 hour figure was wrong? Let's just say I see my error and agree with this logic. Lvl 99 is 13,034,431 xp, minus lvl 90 xp, which is 5,346,332, that's 7,688,099 xp. 7,688,099/38000 is 202 hours for bloods, 7,688,099/48000 is 160 hours, for souls. So that 75 is not div8ded by 30, it's divided by 42, which is only 1.7m an hour. So yea, you end up with SIGNIFICANTLY MORE money by doing souls + vork for 202 hours than just bloods. The 42 hours is 126m+ at vork. He has nothing to say when he cant even calculate how much time is saved.
---
ah ye tob fair enough.
---
For Shauny his choice was family based, a lot of people seem to often overlook he is a relative new father and kids after a few years pretty much change your life direction and priorities completely.
---
Oh man tell me about it. Once I hit one 99, a bunch will follow. I‚Äôve set my account up nicely for rapid 99‚Äôs. All the foundational stuff is in place, now it‚Äôs just Endgame stuff. Plus that Vork money is finally flowing in so I can purchase some 99‚Äôs too. 
---
Now the tricky part is actually doing it. I keep telling myself 99‚Äôs will be easy, but I burn out after like 1m exp gained in one skill and don‚Äôt touch that skill forever.
---
Do some barrows for a couple hours, chill af and decent profit. At your stats all you really need is a black salamander and some harra tar

pretty sure jagex is americna owned now

Business works very differently when it‚Äôs privately owned vs something floating on the share market.

u got a gas leak in your house or some shit brother?
---
Do you have 2fa enabled?
---
Wow. You have a lot of patience.
---
Nice
---
How many years did this take?
---
&gt; the second part is a terrible way to approach the game
---
It was terrible game design, but it's still a part of the game.
---
At this point, I really consider 70s to be mid level with how easy it is to get there. It's a little over a week at sand crabs, and past that point, it's much faster.
---
I agree, the nmz xp is an issue, but until it's addressed, it needs to be considered in game balance. Just because it shouldn't exist, doesn't mean we can ignore it when balancing. Max melee is so easily attainable, that the midgame in terms of combat stats exists for such a short period. This should definitely be considered when designing content for the game, and considering the implications of farmability.
---
Bro it has to be happening to other people not just me, and yea I‚Äôm high suck meüòÇ
---
did it really take this long for people to realize china is a dictatorship and that we shouldnt bend over for them anymore? commies arent people
---
No idea man, sorry. Didn't want to leave you hanging though
---
Really surprises me these plugins had that big of an effect on people. It changed literally nothing about con, and thieving was already a skill you could turn your monitor off and spam click for 200k+ xp/hr
---
Have you tried changing your password and do you have Authenticator? Sounds like someone else is on the account, maybe taking smaller things hoping you wouldn‚Äôt notice.

If it‚Äôs a glitch it‚Äôs a weird one.

You keep bringing up a tournament as if that's all should be talked about. No one knows what the fuck you're talking about.
---
Imma lmfao when we find out ‚Äúlogout‚Äù refers to closing the app and he thinks he can just ‚Äúlogout‚Äù aka close the app, while in combat.
---
But have they banned any pro HK people yet?
---
I'm worried specifically because the team doesn't actually seem to understand what the flaws with their PvP polls and designs are. They keep polling new items for the sake of adding "content" for PvPers without considering that these new items will be used against punching bags do, hence things constantly failing. 
---
Almost nobody who does wilderness bosses is going to want Steve854832 to have a VLS. Nobody who does Wildy clues is going to want things like better normal spellbook. The design of the Wilderness as a whole works against the concept of adding new things that make killing people even easier than it already is, hence things constantly failing. Maybe if it was balanced by adding new survival items... but instead we just get forced nerfs to the tank items we already have.
---
You died. When Barrows gear gets damaged it becomes untradable , so you keep it on death. 
---
Fury would be kept as it‚Äôs one of your 3 keys on death that isn‚Äôt untradable due to its wealth. 
---
This isn‚Äôt a glitch at all
---
Chambers of xeric.
---
Yea i agree with you. The magic sets from warding like the blood/soulbark would have been nice imo, something with a little def bonus and slightly better than mystics. Though they basically had the same def bonus as black d'hide, which is one of my biggest complaint about deep wildy is that black d'hide is way too cost effective. 
---
Having a new curses/buff type spell book would be sweet as hell. I think a rework on the way heal other and share potion works could be cool too. Osrs doesn't have a way to play the "priest", idk how to balance it though. 
---
As for spec weapon, a magic based one could be pretty cool. But if they made one of those it would likely be really expensive. I feel like melee has the best spec weapons already. Claws and Ags are super good for deep wildy. They're just expensive.
---
I don‚Äôt have the authentication on I‚Äôll have to set it up to really see but I have a pin and I have changed my pass recently 
---
I swear I‚Äôll post a picture of what it looks like
---
It‚Äôs stacked
---
&gt; all you gotta do is know that the game works on squares
---
This is drastic oversimplifcation. The part I'm talking about is when you're moving 2 squares in one direction (like North) and 1 square in another (like West). Do you move diagonally first, then straight? Or straight then diagonally? Understanding how pathing works in OSRS makes it much easier to understand when you'll do which, and that can save a lot of time
---
&gt; everyone tries to cut the corner at zalcano cuz it looks like a circle, but theyre really just big square stamps 
---
Important point. Can't get greedy like that

There was a post recently here, I think it was a, screenshot of a player moderator saying, 'watch the bot strip for me', and under that was another screenshot with the bot in view, and it had taken off those fancy clothes.
---
&gt; Did you skim over the part where I said his 30 hour figure was wrong?
---
No, that's why I said 
---
&gt;(ignore the accuracy of the example I don't actually know how long this shit takes)
---
Anyway, according to this quote:
---
&gt;75 is not div8ded by 30, it's divided by 42, which is only 1.7m an hour
---
You understand the logic of my proof, and you understand the logic of the OP, so now your only avenue is 
---
&gt;So yea, you end up with SIGNIFICANTLY MORE money by doing souls + vork for 202 hours than just bloods
---
Which is not actually countering anything that anyone said, if anything it's further supporting my proof and OP's math. 
---
Further, 
---
&gt;but if someone only cares about.money, bloods are NOT the way to go
---
Just shows that you still really don't understand the very first point OP made, either that or you're just arguing nonsense because you don't want to admit you didn't understand what OP was saying.
---
Except he is right, 3 tick fishing is very quick to learn and no need for game sounds or songs at all. If it were 3 tick mining I would agree with you however.
---
Okay?
---
Levels aren't everything. I mean, crafting a trident only requires 43 fletching.
---
Most people drop clues they aren't able to do; deep wilderness steps for HCs, high skill req. masters, duel arena steps for anti-socials in an MMORPG. Just part of the game, y'know?
---
But yeah, I'm okay. Thanks for asking.
---
No dude I‚Äôm not that clueless 
---
But I was telling myself that I was 
---
Like I mm trying to explain to you I have brushed this off 5 times maybe in the last month or two? And this time I‚Äôm 200% sure there is no way I died or anything, my items are stacked like I died, nothing is damaged , my charges are all there, I‚Äôm wearing clothes every single time
---
Are you "logging out" by simply closing the app? That won't log you out and if you're near aggressive mobs they've killed you.
---
Only other potential is someone is accessing your account. A brother or sister on your phone, or being hijacked due to not having authenticator. (Seriously get authenticator)
---
Anything like this will just get abused.
---
porn is bad for you

Imagine farm runs, birdhouse runs, ending any skill, etc.  I mean if you enjoy skilling it‚Äôs the most useful cape for any other skill aside from maybe con cape

Sarachnis is actually a good piece of mid game content

Wtf.

50/50 man nice

No, it's just you that doesn't know what I'm talking about. You can't even figure out how to use the fucking edit button, I'm not surprised you don't have the faintest clue what's going on in this "conversation" lmao.
---
PVP is not the end-all content of this game. The wilderness already has so much content. People just don't roam the wilderness like they used to.
---
If you stand between two chairs, you can get extra kills with range while the cannon does the heavy lifting. Saved myself 45 minutes and ~500 cannon balls.

Mud runes are 38k xp/hour and 1.1m gp/hour.

Niice! W00t!
---
The official client isn‚Äôt as good as runelite but it‚Äôs not asking much of the player base to use it if they end up having to ban 3p clients.
---
Do it, ban me, I'll quit. Runelite has stated they are in communications with jagex and have not received a red light to remove the plugin yet. They already removed the gorilla plugin.
---
Addy darts are the commonly used ones that are best bang for your buck. To go up to rune or dragon is a significant cost increase and is only really worth it for max geared players
---
Oh lawd we got hippies...

Great way to circumvent this is playing on a windows vps. Most hosting services have built in VNC over html.

Would it be more more efficient or viable to use purple sweets at wintertodt if you had 10 hp?
---
I like it because the quests are fun, the sense of progression is satisfying, and bossing for pets/collection log is nice for a challenge.
---
There are some things I dislike such as a lack of afk (mobile friendly) training methods for certain skills (thieving comes to mind), but overall it's decent.
---
I suppose most combat isn't as good on mobile as it is on pc with the long-as-fuck right click delay and lack of third-party client features such as ground items, but as far as mobile MMOs go it's great. At least you have the ability to use a pc when you get to doing combat, while if you had a problem with the platform limitations of another mobile MMO you wouldn't have that flexibility.
---
Glitches exist, of course they do. So do human mistakes. So does lying.
---
I don't believe some hidden glitch that keeps your account active and somehow suicides it in a non dangerous area exists. If it does it would impact a LOT of people and be a widespread issue. It wouldn't be happening to just you.
---
How come this year items weren‚Äôt added to osrs opposed to previous years? Lots of people went to Runefest that only play osrs.
---
Funny how you got downvoted but still came out with the convincing answer.
---
That‚Äôs the point lol. That‚Äôs good that they are doing it

I cant believe you went with zulrahvap instead of toxicsuckpipe.

It's taught at every CPR class ever as the go-to 100 bpm song...

Yes a new kitten will need to be made a hell kitty again. You can wait till it's a cat to do this however, if that's your goal 
---
Kittens run away if you don't interact with them as well as feed them
---
try the black smith helmet.
---
You're basing your "fun" on third party modifications, maybe osrs as is just isn't for you. or you can keep being a 6 iq player and vote for changes that make the game more like those third party modifications so you can have fun with your passive experience.
---
 hot take: white kids pretending to care about hong kong is fucking cringy
---
Is that mclovin?
---
If your cat gets lonely you have to stroke it, not feed it. Unfortunately you will have get another kitten and fight more hellrats if you want another hellkitten.
---
Oh, I'm so jealous. I'm at 90 runecrafting (no pet by the way) and I want that cape so bad. Congrats!
---
No, you made it pretty clear. You only want to see things about a tournament and some crazy how this post has impeded that. You even went as far as to say you hope you don't see more like it as you *really* don't care. Cool, that's a selfishly centered view and it's going to really get you far in life.
---
And look, you don't have to care about other people, that's cool, but you also don't need to be a bitch about it. You're not worth anyone's time so enjoy your tournament. Cheers.
---
Sorry for being late, but Reddit didn't gave poor advice this time. We told him to buy a Torture first, then prims on his first post, but then OP ignored that info. Dude flat out ignored the gear progression advice like torso, b gloves, etc.and went straight for tassets...
---
TL;DR OP went full retard and ignored our advice, making us look bad.
---
They confirmed jaw drop rate?
---
And by your logic that would make you just as corrupt.
---
That's true, it's a trade-off. Being able to have multiple may be worth the few extra seconds wasted per trip. It depends how much you are dying.

maybe in a rush to run through my comments after i said something bad about your post, you misinterpreted my point.

he says hype is bad, yet uses hyperbole

Rune is worth it if you can afford it, dragon is nearly never worth it.
---
I swear I‚Äôm actually a responsible pet owner. My heart aches for him :( thank you for the reply I‚Äôm gonna post some flyers if anyone sees a rouge hell kitten I‚Äôll be at the Ge.
---
No. Purple sweets are hella expensive. They'd be more viable at 10 hp than at at 99 hp, but you'd still be better off using wines or sacks of potatoes since they're so much cheaper.

Got to wiki durable page. Adjust the potential task list by weight. And block the highest weighting monsters you won‚Äôt kill.

What's the best teleport method for fishing karambwans? I have a fairy ring in my house if that matters and an ornate jewel box.

That's some next level gaming

Thank you :(

Every other president we‚Äôve had just thinks ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only here for 4-8 years, China isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù

Wouldn't save you anything. You have the ability to bank inbetween kills without wasting any time due to respawn timer. So you can bring in small amounts of food (I personally brought 4 cakes). Afk there until you finish a game when low on food. Run to the bank, restock and bank your crates. And then continue on.
---
Sweets wouldn't do anything for you except taking up only 1 inventory. But that won't change much during actual kills. And if you care to optimise you could do the same with 1 cake (or brew if you aren't an iron by the sounds of it) and then bank each kill to bank the crate and restock the brew or cake. Same amount of inventory as sweets, but far cheaper and more effective healing.
---
You didn‚Äôt cross out your name in every spot man it says your name when showing the item in chat
---
Wow I was gonna say ‚ÄúGZ! Go cook you a (blank)‚Äù but 48 doesn‚Äôt unlock anything new. Then I figured I‚Äôd check quest requirements and still nothing. I can‚Äôt tell you how upsetting this is.
---
it comes out to around 1700 cballs per hour including buying ore + smelting bars + making cballs (that's ignoring the gp cost entirely). 17k slayer xp/hr isn't great, even early game when that xprate might seem ok it would be a drain on your cash stack. Another thing to consider is cannon only gives half the range xp and no hp xp so you'll be getting less combat xp overall too.
---
Definitely the fairy ring. It takes you straight to the karambwan fishing spot.
---
Code DKP
---
K, lets not give BiS items to midgame content, so lets see... Dragon defender, whip, slayer helm/black mask, proslyte gear, the previous BiS helm nez, blowpipe...
---
Yeah lets take ALL THAT and move it to endgame content, its not like it was JUST STATED that theres a ton of endgame content already, and barely anything for midgame players, because everytime new content is introduced max plaeyrs ruin it.

what‚Äôs that?

No release date. Engine work isn't completed. They've said next year with a release schedule of Morytania &gt; Clans &gt; Group Ironman. The same background work is required for clans and group ironman.

Think "bit" is a typo of "big", here! Nice transcript otherwise; TY :)
---
Farming because it's AFK and I can do it every hour or two at work. EZ 1m/day for basically no effort. Throw in herb boxes and you're cooking with gas mate.

Yanillian hops and Birdhouses, hard farming contracts.

Can you be any more simplistic with your views? They didn't even have a model for the boss. It was literally just words. Other than a video with Ash in it, they could have quite literally come up with it that morning.
---
Looks gay af.
---
You can't. Ironmen have separate shops
---
Is their a comprehensive list of every jmod ever, known time with Jagex, and known contributions to the game? Like a credits page for RuneScape?
---
Yeh you can definitely still do that. Wait till Jad attacks, pray, run under him and flick to melee pray so if he decides to smack you on the other side you're safe. Then react to his attack and continue attacking with all the healers trapped on the other side.
---
Saradomin sword vs dragon scim for str training?
---
I recently hit 70 combat stats so I want to start training str again. I bought a whip a few days ago and I love its stats, but the dscim is a fair amount of a downgrade, but I need something to train str. I can't afford an abyssal dagger or staff of the dead, so my only option would be a saradomin sword. It's got -9 slash but +10 str compared to the dscim.
---
Would the 950k be a worthwhile investment?
---
Why would you ever think having a kid when you make minimum wage was a good idea?
---
Incredible work! Thank you very much.
---
Sure I'd be down to throw some in for a mansion. That sounds so fun! Where would we all live?
---
Just like thoughts and prayers could?
---
Planning. I enjoy trying to figure out which path takes me to my desired goal the fastest.
---
Most MMOs these days have an obvious and often forced progression system. Everyone follows the same path, and you just gotta grind it out.
---
Runescape lets me choose between several options to achieve any tasks. I get to put some thought into which is the most efficient, and if I don't like a particular task, I can usually find an alternative.
---
Setting a goal, figuring out how to achieve it, and then completing it feels more rewarding than just completing a checklist because the game told me to.
---
And darts, or occasionally bolts.
---
Even if someone told the truth here, who would do what about it ? Protestors are a vessel for the true issue at hand. Paid extras, and the ones that aren‚Äôt paid , are lost souls.
---
Hong Kong holds criminals that committed treason against mainland China and its government. 
---
The flow of money is being squeezed and all you see in the media is just one of the reactions to one facet of the whole problem.
---
Probably A ghost because it was the previous pet of someone else that got pk‚Äôed hunting chins and was left abandoned and died out in the wildy.
---
Nobody is saying you're bad if you want item overlays. What we are saying is if removing item overlays is enough to make you no longer enjoy playing the game, then maybe this isn't the game for you after all. 
---
Like I've said before, If I had half as many complaints about this game as the average person on this sub, I'd have quit a long time ago. It's a fucking game. Who gives a shit if you have to read some item names and actually find your drops occasionally. 
---
Unless you're cannoning, all you gotta do is look right where you just got a kill. If you are cannoning, well I guess having to think for 15 seconds is a fair trade off for being able to kill a shitload of things at once. 
---
If a bunch of 12 year olds figured it out 15 years ago, you can figure it out now. 
---
Yes, those updates would be nice to have on vanilla. But if overlays are literally the one thing that is standing between you and quitting this game, just fucking quit. I can't imagine you're a fun person to be around or play the game with.
---
Probably for the best
---
When fighting a multi combat way boss what determines who gets the KC message? Is it based on the most damage dealt? And how does it work for GWD? Do I need to deal the most damage to both the boss and its 3 minions to get the KC message?
---
I wouldn't expect a 1200 total level with stats ranging from 9-70 to really understand.
---
I mean it did do what they wanted and that wss to keep jaw expensive
---
Its settling around 25m when people were saying it was gunna be 5m by now
---
&gt; You won't last 6 hours on hard
---
If so, call a doctor
---
Is it still happening?
---
I have to see this.
---
Blast furnace steel bars is solid and really low requirement. Look into it :) about 400-600k gp/hr with a 30 smithing requirement and starting the quest to get to keldagrim (The Giant Dwarf I think)
---
Rune armor takes 90+ smithing
---
I knew this comment was coming but I didn‚Äôt bot. It wasn‚Äôt me the account was stolen
---
The dream mentor bosses are pretty big. They give the most points and are easy enough to kill. I find the demons bosses (legends, monkey madness, gnome tree) are really good as they aren't very tanky like some (scarab, desert treasure bosses) but still give high points. Bouncer, skeletal hound and khazard warlord are solid ones for some points when you're starting out
---
[The wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Nightmare_Zone/Strategies/Optimal_points) gives a decent idea of what to block and what not - basically bock things that require some special tactic to kill or are very low points compared to HP
---
It's not for everyone. I know a lot of people that are interested in getting back into the game to play it.
---
I always had the ags
---
Ouch
---
You can also use glory for edgeville bank, drakan's medallion if you're an iron and want unlimited no charge teleports.
---
love the portfolio
---
How many ores can the sac hold?
---
quality input
---
Oh jeez I thought that was someone using the wildy altar and him imbued hearting and using runes to start barrage the dude
---
Hence the "gl" after it
---
well only do it if you need money. Don't do it for the mining exp if mining is your main goal. But making 200-300m from 85-91 mining was worth it.

In the tweet you referenced, it most definitely isn‚Äôt open to interpretation as the banned user admits to AHKing lavas and is a staunch opponent of using 3rd party clients. 
---
Honestly you should edit your original comment as you‚Äôre fear mongering and blatantly lying about the situation.
---
I tried pyramid plunder but I didn't like it.
---
Why are the AU servers garbage? Never thought I'd die to Hespori but here we are.
---
If you're failing that many corrupted you really shouldn't be doing it honestly.
---
Idk hoe you're failing that much with 100 kc tho
---
Corrupted only worth it if you're completinfg it consistently.
---
Every time I play it feels like I'm making a small investment towards something that'll be a real achievement someday.

Nothing happened at Falador Square on June 6th, 2006.
---
&gt; What's a typical session
---
Benefit of RS over a game like WoW, is that any time you have is time that you can use. Skilling is just an act of repeating the same thing over and over (think grinding Mobs in wow). So any time you can put into it can be done at the rate possible, and then you can logout.
---
&gt; In app purchases
---
The only in game purchases that exist are Bonds. Similar to WoW Tokens you can buy these for real life $ directly from Jagex, and redeem them for 14 days of membership or sell them in game for ~5m gp these days. Same in reverse, if you have 5m gp you can buy a bond from another player and use it to subscribe to the game, essentially playing for free if you earn enough GP in 14 days to afford a bond.
---
&gt; Where to start
---
Make a free account. And make it your goal to complete the newcomer task system they've implemented. From there head to doing all the free to play quests (dragon slayer is the biggest one with the most requirements and a true boss fight that will require you to level your stats). If at any time during this you feel like you love the game I'd suggest instantly subscribing to get access to members content and you can work on quests in the members area to help accelerate your accounts progression. (Waterfall, The Grand Tree, Tree Gnome Village and Fight Arena are common ones to get your combat stats into the 30s and 40s really quickly).

Its free to check it out, so if you don't like it and find the game boring or not for you. No money lost :) If you do get into it though, just google around for some guides. This game has heaps of content creators making YouTube guides and the wiki is a wealth of information. Don't be afraid to refer to a wiki guide or slayermusiq1 on YouTube for your quests, but I'd also suggest using the ingame quest log and trying to solve them yourself :)
---
Watch the new southpark!
---
ok so it has no use, thansk for clarifying
---
That's just poor planning. Way back when Runescape was new the rune platebody was a god tier item.
---
Over the years the game has changed, but Oldschool still hasn't changed that level requirement.
---
Try to make your own with a group of friends. Don't allow too many other people into it. 
---
But, if you join big clans you'll probably get lost in the shuffle and end up leaving unless you're really active in cc and participate in a lot of events. You have to remember, every clan these days does this same shit and come across as very mundane. But if you find a clan that gets really creative, and does fun shit like: everyone wears full obsidian with maul and goes to sara gwd while hopping worlds and crashing everyone then you know you've found the right group of people. A lot of clans aren't creative and don't try to be, which is how a lot of them die out, despite them being "big".
---
Thank you, sir. Much appreciated!
---
You said that. Out loud. As if it was actually a good point....
---
nobody deserves to see impact font memes in 2019
---
Playing on them right now perfectly fine with 40 ping at my office (which normally has worse ping due to firewalls and poor routing).
---
Haven't had any dramas at home. Possibly you're own network having issues or your ISP poorly routing you? What's your ping?
---
Most damage. 
---
Minions have a separate tracker for each
---
Nope they just killed their own people in concentration camps and harvest their organs
---
It is given to most damage dealt correct. And no the minions in gwd are separate monsters and thus decide their loot separately.
---
Like any game studio Jagex probably makes art assets last, and it doesn't make sense to design any large portion of the content without seeing what the player base has to say.
---
4 inventories worth without upgrading it. 7 or 8 with it upgraded from memory.
---
Do you have two factor authentication?
---
Fair enough

Lol did you miss the mod ash tweet where he said "@Im_A_Youtuber There certainly was a level 3 with boss pets"
---
This is not worth the time, but it‚Äôs also not against the rules
---
Dude....
---
What you said makes no sense. If they hired a bunch of experienced game devs you'd say that they are hiring all of these people who will influence the game in a bad direction. You are literally over analyzing every aspect of the company. 
---
People leave and people get hired. Its about finding passionate devs who care about the game. You can never know right off of th bat of someone will be a good influence on the game or not. And at the same time, your idea of a "good influence" is probably different than the next guy. Mod Kieren was a fresh dev and hes contributed more to the game than almost anyone.
---
And with the new devs they also hired the super experience EP guy, who seems to have been able to get the company to switch gears and focus on account security and client issues.
---
TLDR:
---
Nothing crazy is going on, but if you really want drama and tinfoil hats, you can find it anywhere.
---
If they didn't have jaws they'd have a better normal drop table and be used like Spectres, Nechs etc for better xp/hr.
---

---
Was polled at level 60 slayer.
---
You're sidestepping everything lmao. Who cares about any of that? Hong Kong is suffering because of Chinese authoritarianism. 
---
Dispute that or not, I don't care. 
---
Wait, you can dispute it!
---
I think it‚Äôs way worth the time considering hopping worlds to sell a few is more time consuming then selling one buying one while multi logging in. Imo.
---
Real talk.  Is mahogany the best way to get to 99? 
---
I'm at 61 right now
---
I almost exclusively play mobile, so that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. With only 10 minutes there are a few things you can do, mostly farming related. Farm runs, birdhouse runs, tree runs, etc. Most of the game can be enjoyed in longer sessions. I typically play a few hours a day, ranging from 1-3 hours and that is plenty of time to train skills. 
---
In app purchases are only for membership, which allows you do get the most content out of the game. There is plenty to do without membership but a good majority of content is locked behind that. Once you get your account going though you can purchase membership with in game gold called bonds.
---
In terms of advice for new players, I would definitely recommend questing. This can get your skills trained quickly and help set you up for other skills and aspects of the game. There isn‚Äôt a whole lot in game tutorials aside from the very beginning, so researching on the wiki and the subreddit can be very helpful.
---
Depending on job prospects and the locla industry, it can lookbetter on your resume being in different roles
---
I mean, they gave the location, theme, and general idea about how it'll go as far as trips out to it and vague mechanics (similar to Corp,  will be more difficult to access etc.). I'm sure they've many more specific ideas that they didn't want to go into before a blog/poll etc. Not really sure what your gripe is about. .
---
Why do I need to name one? A lot of cigarette companies have gone under.
---
Early Farming is really fast. I hope you're using Trees. 
---
Don't focus on bossing right now since they're more "do-able" at +75 and preferably +85 combat stats. I would say if you're lost, just try and complete your diaries since they unlock a lot of useful perks.
---
only 2 day ban? yikes
---
&gt; i would be much more happy without these classes and my money not wasted.
---
You aren't going to college to learn, you're going to college to prove you're qualified. If you going to a useless class is what it takes then oh well.
---
Also you are still learning shit if you're listening to a lecture and memorizing a slide. It's just boring.
---
The data of 1 anti pk isn't enough to justify your point. In the long run the pvmer will do more money because 99% of the time the pkers are risking salad robes, 300 blood runes and maybe a granite maul. That shitty gear is not worth risking a skull
---
Why did the price of big bones drop so much over the last month or two?
---
I've been buying them for around 206 and selling for 216-220 for the past few months. Recently the price really crashed. What's up with that?
---
Don't forget the endless scout bots that have a team logging in under you for your plus 1
---
Making no body want to risk anything in the wild. Its not high risk higbreward. Its high risk get fucked by scout bots.
---
Soul wars was pretty great for a few months, and then people figured out how easy it was to abuse.  Once 90% of the players in a match are AFKing, it becomes completely unplayable for the remaining 10%. 
---
Most of the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù mini games haven‚Äôt come back for a reason. If there‚Äôs no rewards, mini games become deeply unpopular and it becomes hard to get a game started -&gt; dead content. Or the mini game has rewards and then people abuse it so hard that actually playing the game becomes impossible. I don‚Äôt believe there can be a middle ground for soul wars as it was originally designed.
---
Do you think the people who 3 tick to 99 fishing don't have RSI?
---
Thank you!
---
The helm is also like 720,000,000gp cheaper, so thees that. Also, 25% damage reduction is garbage, ok.
---
The only guild that allows you in at lvl 1
---
Wow staff of air on 4th clue!!! What a legend.
---
shh this is cuter
---
Lava drags are way more safe and you can kill 3 at a time no worries. They're my favorite way to farm elites bc of how easy and not stressful they are
---
almost everyone is endgame by your definition chief, takes like 6 months to become ‚Äúend game‚Äù maybe learn
---
Osbuddy only accounts for people using osbuddy so its very inaccurate IMO.
---
Are you asking why it is considered BiS? It gives +6 strength which is the highest of ant helmet slot item.
---
How did this get downvoted lol?
---
And? Spread the word
---
No, why do we have such a lack of helmet choices that a nezzy helm upgrade is bis
---
What fucking game are you playing dude? Cause its def not os.
---
I said ‚Äúfor knowing‚Äù. I remember it happening.
---
Congrats!
---
What gear did you use for those kills?
---
Remind me never to piss off 12 year old you
---
this is one thing I am pretty sure we will never see in osrs
---
I said ‚Äúfor knowing‚Äù.
---
I remember when it happened.
---
Did you not watch the qA today...
---
There aren't enough things left to achieve in the games to make a higher tier
---
I am excited for the pvm diaries they have been talking about, they should open to the door to some new types of challenges!
---
no
---
Well the other option is another one bites the dust so..
---
Get ur fkn gay ass promotion bullshit outta here
---
Are there any beginner lms groups/clans? I have a mate and we're looking to get into it but aren't learning too much from getting slaughtered in less than 10 seconds
---
Good amount of deaths are crafted here.
---
Well Jesse did you get your heart?
---
Great addition to the game imo. Fun way to get spider eggs
---
I still did awnser the hypothetical. I just dragged in my soap box too.
---
To further expand, I think there needs to me more clear useful distinction between "light armors" and "heavy armors" so back in the day often rune chain was preferred over rune plate in classic.
---
I'll be honest I'm sure sure how deep I was into classic but I remember seeing lots of rune chains, d meds, and a dragon battle axe. Often people used 2h's a bit more back then too as a main weapon in pvp, or long swords so for stabbing through that rune chain. But chain was preferred to combat dbattle axe and it's crush attacks.
---
What might be a interesting thought is maybe a three armor tier system. Light armors like dragon hides would remain about the same. They're technically melee armor too, and the defence skill governs all combat stats so I think it's fair to bunch them in with melee. Medium armors like rune chain, or skeletal, or splitbark would need more exaggerated stats to block out a specific style a little bit more, while leaving itself open for a specific attack style.
---
Heavy armors like barrows equiptment bandos need to be weaker to crush slightly more than it is now.
---
I know melee isn't supposed to be weak to melee, but the hope is there would be a type of armor out there for you that would be good to counter the slash bonus of X weapon and then try to force them to rely more on something else.
---
I dunno any kind of massive change like that is going to fuck up the whole enviorment around it for a while and usually people aren't on board with that. But if we ever had to retroactively fix power creep probably the least invasive way to fix it would be through just min maxing stat bonuses to counter every single over powered thing you made.
---
Then every one still gets their ags specs and blowpipes, just maybe with a better stat rebalance you could pheasably add more content that's better, and won't three hit you in under 10 game ticks.
---
Ye. As soon as I picked it up everything else disappeared
---
I dont think that MTA will ever be adjusted as it's been locked in as a hard diary requirement. :( I just did it and I hated every minute of it.
---
It certainly could use some love.
---
Bro it's just qol bro. Bet u just want everyone else to go about the same pointless grinds you did. It's just qol and you're afraid of change, you sweaty nerd.
---
140% of the players would quit yesterday if they banned these qol features. If you don't like them, don't use them, you pker. I'm voting no to all PvP updates just because of your comment.
---
Are you okay
---
Was it ever called a medium tier monster by anyone at Jagex or was it just the 1500 total level Redditors who called it that?
---
its intended to make them more productive lol
---
Is it a restaurant?
---
Thanks! Its taken a few months but I feel really good I finally hit it :)
---
I take it you've never heard of world 330?
---
Same thing happened to my old account when I tried to come back after years of not playing.
---
Apparently my account was hijacked and used to macro??
---
I submitted an appeal and it was denied.
---
I submitted another and this time put tons of info even if I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure of it... for example, they ask you ISP at time of creation and date of creation. I practically guessed since it was literally 15 years ago and I didn‚Äôt pay the fking bills or choose our Internet Provider lol.
---
I also wrote in my message that I was trying to come back and play with my cousin &amp; relive the glory days, and that in the past I was a POS but definitely did not macro last year when I didn‚Äôt even play.
---
Got the ban overturned and logged in to a fresh account with maybe a few stats over lvl 5 lol.
---
Ended up creating a new account and currently at 1860 total and crushing it!
---
Some of us have the capacity to care about more than one issue at a time.
---
Is this something people don't know about?
---
You are going ham right now lol nice work!
---
bond prices would rise to 19m ea, u would be as fucked
---
I mean isn‚Äôt the meta to let the sack fill up from four inventories and then bank them all at once?
---
Lmao my cousin was the blonde kid at the end of this scene! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing my part too!‚Äù LOL
---
Ah ye fair point
---
It's more of how absurdly expensive it gets tbh
---
This is a Facebook tier meme
---
the people that hired her just thought she was hot and forgot to ask anything about rs. You‚Äôre hired! Lmao
---
1776 WILL COMMENCE AGAIN!
---
If you got a message when a bot got banned/muted that you reported I think a lot more people would do it. Positively reinforcing our incredibly flexible brains would go a lot farther than creating a program that coders could find loopholes around in hours.
---
The problem in your argument is that your'e saying it like a team actually "fully geared" just for you to take down the 3 iteming guy when the truth is that they just happened to be there and for example right now, people doing wildy slayer are getting slayer keys from naked people doing slayer and back like few months ago wildy pvmers were getting emblems which were about 200k that time, regardless even if your'e not doing slayer and you have even 1 item which you will risk if you skull up and get smited/forget to protect item then its reasonable to try and skull trick you and if you don't fall for it then they  will leave you or kill you if your'e easy cause obvsly none of the sides like each other too much so why not
---
Yeah if you play 8 hours a day..
---
Awesome!
---
Now remember that Stockholm‚Äôs syndrome is a thing, blink once if your not okay and need rescuing.
---
Smith platebodys if your gathering resources yourself iron is faster to 99 than anything else
---
Damn, could you maybe draw one where shes naked and grinding on graadors massive green cock?
---
35 KC with all notable drops achieved! Gz man
---
Ur fault
---
I'll be there
---
Thank you! And thank you for the video. I've gotten pretty comfortable with glove switch and have already started to (attempt) pick up the bars without stopping. I'm guessing the drive-by-furnace thing is whats referred to as 0 ticking it?
---
r/die
---
Might not be able to make it but grats on the big achievement! Is this your first 99?
---
China read is as Free HongKong, its free real estate.
---
OSRS PD 69
---
Nah they're not useless you're obviously not providing enough info. Source: recovered accounts with recoveries many times over years
---
For example $11
---
No, this is what happens when a city tries to tackle a national problem. It's an American problem, which can be solved if all America works together. Has the country fallen so far that it cannot solve any problems? Make America great again, irony.
---
PvP isn't PvP if the other person isn't fighting back.
---
You can argue that it's always been like that in RS since the Wilderness was introduced, but it doesn't mean it's a good system.
---
Killing PvMers in the wild to get whatever drops they had from camping a boss for a few kills is the most boring sort of PvP and should be ignored (but not removed unless they nerf the wilderness xp rates and drop tables).
---
Wilderness should be made more difficult to traverse with things like high level revenants and focus PvP into actual fights and minigames.
---
Daily reminder that it wasn't Wilderness removal that killed the game originally but Free Trade removal, so don't bother replying that PvP is the lifeblood of the game and will die without it.
---
asd
---
yeah, fairly sure you can make it easier as well with tile markers letting you know when you can click toward the bank, but I personally never got this method down
---
regardless, the preloading method with glove switching is always faster exp even if you stop at the dispenser for one or two ticks
---
Sir Amik Varze has invited you to Taverly Lake.
---
Hey thanks anyways! Yes first 99 ever! Even going back to original RuneScape!
---
Why doesnt everybody understand this?
---
love the mods, always a pleasure. hope to see gambit back on the couch soon, hosting or otherwise
---
There is no such as quitting, just extended breaks that may be even few years
---
Best is using 2 alts to lure market guards then running in a circle on the Draynor market stalls.
---
I think Pyramid Plunder is 2nd best chance if you're 91+ and rush golden chests, which also gives a good chance to profit with the Pharaoh's Sceptre.
---
reason? it gives a wealth that does nothing.
---
Then i am clueless
---
Cause they just did a mass perm ban of all the names with hk lol
---
Whips would still be used since they would be a fraction of the cost of the Tent Whip so it would just be another stepping stone in the progression chain.
---
jagex also doesnt host multinational tournaments with players mainly from countries with harsh dictatorships like china. but im sure if they did have teams from said country participating in dmm theyd put a 'no political discussion on air' in their contract. it causes unnecessary drama like this. it was a tournament for a video game not a political rally, he wasnt preaching to armed revolutionaries he was talking to fat sweaty nerds who foam at the mouth over digital trading cards. video games are meant to take your mind away from reality and away from the problems, theyre supposed to be about joy and fun, not a soapbox for a major political crisis. blizzard is on the losing side even if they allowed him to send his message without repercussion as theyd have to deal with the chinese gov possibly wanting even stricter binds on blizzard ips for allowing this to happen. money runs this world we live in, blizzard knows that a vast majority of their players are chinese and would take a massive blow if the chinese government suddenly cut off blizzard from china
---
if u have 82 con, why dont u have a fairy ring at home?
---
play the game for fun :)
---
Yeah it is, when you do that for 300 hours.
---
It's just a game, relax.
---
I want to have a good account. I quested for 2 weeks to get Barrows gloves, including skilling to unlock quests.
---
I did barbarian assault so many times to get those points and ended up getting 2kc on the queen even though I hated it.
---
I got all my shit imbued. 
---
I just can‚Äôt fucking get the only good melee cape until inferno which I‚Äôm literally never going to get.
---
Starting to feel like fire cape is the same way
---
I understand what you mean. I hope you still have a nice osrs experience :)
---
Late stage capitalism baby, now with cancer!
---
get 99 range
---
anytime i step into the wilderness i accept the dangers.
---
that said i vote no on most content because it either seems hamfisted or poorly implemented.
---
there was a time when items just came into the game mostly as rewards for content, and people took those items and built the pvp meta around it, now pvp'ers want content catered directly to their gameplay style and cry like babies when it gets denied even though the majority of the population (i assume) vote for roughly the same reasons i do. poor balance, specific catering and a lack of content for everyone else.
---
imagine "mini-gamers" as a minority, asking for buffs to mini-games that provide specific niche use items (sometimes BIS) for their gameplay that doesn't benefit anyone else besides them.
---
design things for the broad majority, if they happen to benefit or create new metas that aren't unbalanced for niche parts of the community, it's a win.
---
oh and all the shit stirring though fun doesn't help.
---
Not sure if you're joking or not but when a name gets banned, they release after 4-5 years. Sometimes even more.
---
its 8.33%. 1/11.
---
maybe u can get a 28 in 1h if u had a willy cat but anything else its not happening. the fucking rat takes longer than vorkath to kill. its less than 20/h with a hellcat.
---
You're brain dead kid. I know that I logged myself out. you're retarded ass can pretend their isnt glitches in this game yet there was a tbow spawn that almost crashed the in game economy. you idiot.
---
Bye, ty for the post
---
All I want in rs is an untadeable.
---
Can‚Äôt buy it with gp I earn. Can‚Äôt just grind for hours and slowly obtain it.
---
I have to do an annoying horde system into a boss which feels impossible considering he just one shot me at 70...one fuck up.
---
Even when I did good one time and got to healer phase my game froze.
---
I already have depression why u do my like this rs
---
Yes but now it‚Äôs edgy to support Hong Kong
---
then it must be an issue with the client. Because i legit logged off. 2m isnt shit, just annoying. I know for a fact that i logged off.
---
How does that help at all?
---
There is no protest in Falador.
---
Imagine outing yourself like that publicly
---
Caddy?
---
d
---
its very cheap to train construction with oak dungeon doors. the expensive part is building the altar/portal nexus.
---
It is possible to buy it....  
---
a twisted bow can 3 hit jad.
---
Oh thank you! I'd always used the right click-&gt;trade option so I hadn't seen it
---
Corrupt gauntlet is really good for elites
---
i believe you can do it man, practice with f keys, long range jad come healers, use brews&amp;restores, take some deep breaths on wave 62. ik you can do it!
---
Fake news ?
---
50/50
---
My bad on the misinformation there. 
---
But let's play your game. Basilisk knights stay mid game, and they have their 1/800 drop rate for the jaw. Everyone can do them, they're easy to do, while still remaining a fairly slow task with bad xp/hr. How much do you think the jaw would be in a month? It would more than likely be under 5m. 
---
So what happens to basilisk knights? Another cave horror task. Nothing special about them, wouldn't even be considered as content as they're just afk, and everyone moves on, since it becomes just another task. 
---
Not saying that there should be less mid game content, but anything that is mid game is just gonna be poor. There's plenty of things mid game players can do, but there is NEVER gonna be something like raids for you guys. Any money maker for mid game is just going to be abused since the majority of the player base can do it, so mid game money making will never be efficient.
---
All in all it just doesn't make sense to me why you want more mid game content that are just an afk monster. You'd probably be better off wanting something like a minigame that can be enjoyed while still giving exp/items or something like that, even if the rates are slower just to ease your way into the late game.
---
Don't worry about either if you have a dhcb
---
This is so low effort, it's not even funny.
---
Nvm
---
The thing is, it‚Äôs not because gaged would rather ban these bots, but due to the fact that they are way more recognizable
---
yeah but vegetas hairline is receding tho
---
They disguise it...
---
There's gonna be a whole lot of people I missed, but here are some off the top of my head.
---
* Tedious has a few series (Zeah only, mage only as well as GenerateTask). 
---
* LemonyApple has a desert only and a fremmy only. 
---
* Caveman Only is probably the OG snowflake video maker, but is pretty much just streaming now.
---
* Karamja Only (normal ironman) has a few imgur progress logs that you may want to look up. 
---
* Yungsos' No Quest ironman is probably one of my favourites, and also streams.
---
* UIMSlayOnly has some good imgur progress logs, and also streams.
---
* SoChocobo ^((sp?)^) is doing task stuff on a HCIM, I haven't seen a whole lot of his stuff but the production value is ridiculous.
---
It's to allow different ports to use subdomains
---
Could be this, or it could be that if you get kc on another pc(not logged into your runelite) then that kc wouldn't show up from your end unless you either update the log with opening that section in the collection log, or using the ring of wealth(idk if infernal is in either).
---
So if you were to do your first kc at mole on mobile, then go back to your pc, and do !kc mole, then I dont think it would show unless you either 1. go do another mole kill or 2. check your col log/ring of wealth log.
---
it cost me 2.8 b somehow
---
&gt;design things for the broad majority, if they happen to benefit or create new metas that aren't unbalanced for niche parts of the community, it's a win.
---
I didn't think of this one, thanks for noticing me. It's a really strong point of how things always have been.
---
Just have a friend do it for you. Jagex will never know.
---
Ping is what I normally get, it's just choppy, like it will lag out every now and then.
---
There was a post a few weeks ago, it seemed to be resolved but I suspect the issue still remains.
---
Don‚Äôt know what you want us to tell you bud. But if your only options are osrs or drinking, at this point I‚Äôd say go stock up bud.
---
Done replying, gl
---
I cant understand how badly you would have to do it for it to take 4-
---
If your in Aus pm me and can do it for free via teamviewer, should only take ~40 mins off task.
---
Hk legit has some of the most expensive corporate real estate in the world. I don‚Äôt know what this neckbeard is going on about.
---
Idk I‚Äôm just a pleb venting who hates life
---
Thanks anyway
---
You may aswell.
---
I believe this is the last boostable task for you
---
Might be worth getting higher slayer though, could always try 1-3 kills just for the chance though.
---
In fact, his hair grows the stronger he is.  
---
Have u seen SSJ3?
---
If you're in Aus I'd happily do the cape for free
---
I grinded out 10 or 12 boots at the start of my account for some easy mage xp and starter cash.. 
---
Definately would not do that again but at the time it was actually not that bad
---
Hmmm, i never killed had killed jad on rs2 times, only in rs3. Have like 2 fight caves and 4 fight kilns in there. And i did it on the first try. Had 6 pray pots and 4 mantas left. I think practicing it in rs3 helped alot.
---
You shouldn't give a hoot what other players say online. Im 99 cmb with 93 range and i still dont have the fire cape..doesnt stop me from melee though. Although i do have a few skilling 99s and my mining cape gets respect. Shoot i get ppl trolling me about gear all the time. Learn to troll back, or ignore them, and just enjoy the game, you'll get it eventually. Odd tip, but most people ive known or met who have beat jad almost like 90% of them did it while tipsy or high, but couldn't do it when sober. Most reasons was the stress and anxiety, and when they loosened up.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they got it done. Best luck tho brother. I probably wont attempt it for another couple range lvs lol, and ive jad more than good enough gear. Worst case scenario knock out a super fast 99 for a skillcape üòâ pretty decent stats.
---
You‚Äôre right üòÖ
---
Marb does not own juul you twat
---
I hate that I sold all my jaw drops for 20/21m. Wish I waited
---
I get that they want more bond membership and I understand as a greedy buisness they want more money. I'm okay with it in a sense because it's not microtransactions. It's more related to this weird viewership economy and twtich community stuff and despite how much I dislike parts of it, I can at least get behind more then microtransactions.
---
Pretty much jagex's whole existence this time on osrs has been making content for the twitch live streamers. That's their source of advertisement and it's just become a whole thing now. They don't want to give us multipul accounts they want us to have this alt scape life style and rack up the money that way. That in itself is its whole own issue though, and many things bleed out of it like dead man mode, leagues, and group Ironman/Ironman mode.
---
And as a person who has a level 106 main I gave up on fully around zulrah release to play on my Ironman who is around 116 cmb nearing 2k total with almost all of gwd bosses I would start again on a new Ironman with the right group of people.

Throughout my whole life making more accounts and pures has been part of it. I tend to get bored when most of the content is a endless grind for a few more bonuses over the baseline tier 70 weapons that this games combat system is essentially based around. I really don't have any aspiration to do raids or get like 88 runecrafting to do so for the sake of doing it. The economy is stale unless you're constantly staying with the meta so things like group Ironman or leagues start to appeal to me again. I've had other redditors share a similar sentiment but that's no indication of anything.
---
I never once felt the need to bot, or auto click. I just stop playing or make a new account. I feel if someone feels the need to bot on their account it's not because jagex isn't doing enough, but more so the end user doesn't know how to stop playing when they're not enjoying themselves anymore. At some point you have to ask yourself if you're still playing if you are having fun or if it's because you've played it for 15+ years of your life and it's hard to let go?
---
We can always make stuff better so you shouldn't have to feel like you'l have to bot it like we did with the sandstone update. The point I was making is I think you have to be at a certian mindset to start macroing seriously instead of playing.

Don't worry, I *feel like* most people understand that, but they're the ones who're probably too busy enjoying themselves to come on here and make snide comments.

You aren't alone, bud. All my penny-pinching early and mid-game led to me having a very comfortable bank by the time I started reaching the end of mid-game.

And they are killable for mid-high level players right now, just not as viable as they once were. Harder mechanics will still punish mid level players, and not all high level/maxed players hunt all pets or do clues.

It's runescape players that are also redditors.  What did you expect?

Damn bro you sound mad. thats funny. your probably the racist p mod.

Im saying both are good, but realistically Portal Nexus saves you a second of load time a day and just having a cleaner looking house, costing millions and is considered great by many(maybe he also thinks the portal is unnecessary for all I know, so not a great argument) so its fair to say no, its not really necessary but its still worth it when its only one level away from the 100% needed 83 for the pool.

Even if this wasn't photoshopped, it can be easily added to your own runelite as a fake task, the thing is that only those who add it in can see it.

There is a website that allows you to practice prayer switching on jad. Also playing with sound on helped me a ton. When the healers come around, take your time with them. Always check/restore prayer points first, then let jad attack, then attack one healer, then go back to jad. If you dont want to worry about lining up the healers then bring a verac skirt for some def bonus. 
---
I used to glide right through the fight caves in rs3 but had a hell of a time getting it on osrs. The first 2 times I died during the healers because I gave them all my focus. The third time I tried I picked the wrong prayer and got hit with a 60 something but kept my cool, tanked the healers, and finished the caves.
---
Good luck to you, let me know if i can offer advice on anything else. If you still cant get it dont get beat up about it, it's just a game and nobody really cares if you have an obby cape or fire cape as much as you do. This is coming from a level 102 with a combat bracelet. Quests are easy but I say fuck questing for barrows gloves.

I wouldn't mind voting yes to a pvp poll aslong as it's well balanced, not something ridiculous that well make wilderness more dangerous than it is. I don't mind pkers in wildy trying to kill me, Infact I'm learning how to anti-pk which would give the game (Cat and mouse game) more thrilling to kill the pker that doesn't expects me to ags him right away. There are things that SHOULD be fixed in opinion so that some people might give a chance to the pvp community.
---
1. Banning the scout bots. I don't mind getting spotted by a normal player or 2/3 people. But a scout bot would INSTANTLY inform an ENTIRE clan of 10 people about your location, gear, world and level. It's very bad and hurts the wildy. And encourages people to abandoned it.
---
2.  Adding pvp weapons that are balanced and well-obtained(how to get em). I would COMPLETELY Disagree adding the current OP VLS when I've seen on stream hitting 75 on spec with 25%. That's really retarded and should be all bit nerfed to become acceptable.
---
3. Small understandable cooperation between pkers and rest of community. From what I know so far, there has been always SPITE vote to pvpers because of the people pkers kill clue hunters and pvmers is a no vote to the poll. Yes they should be AWARE of the warning. It's just probably that there not prepared / geared fighting another pker. All I say learn to pvp in lms or whatever minigame has this feature to learn how to anti-pk. To make the game more interesting,
---
Those are state level trade talks. Private chinese companies buying other companies is very different.

---
Define vanilla for me? Do you mean exactly as it was 2007 or before a specific update?
---
Nobody says rapier shouldn't be in the game LOL wtf are you smoking
---
Yeah, the way I was told it is that Def makes enemies hits connect less often and Attack makes yours connect more often. Basically attack is accuracy and Defence is evasion.
---
and are you sure zammy book is better than bandos book for training at crabs with abyssal dagger?
---
I only takes a few hours but its boring as hell
---
The tier doesn't really matter; it is the stats that would be the issue. If you add a better version of Bandos that doesn't require Bandos, that would be concerning to some players.
---
Honestly, I don't know how I'd go about trying to rebalance those armors, but even if you rebalance them the expectation issue persists. If a poll says "Should we add Torva as proposed in the Poll Blog?", a lot of players will just think RS2 Torva, one of the interactions of it, and might vote based on that.
---
It's very different in os. I can do a kiln in 25mins but had took me an hour with 75 range and a blow pipe. You splash a ridiculous amount and when you do hit it's like a 13. Think the jad fight took 3-5 mins lol
---
yup, the extra max hit from bandos is quite useless
---
You can do nmz on your phone or afk when you watch a movie or something.
---
Its ~60k/h xp and you only need to click every 15-20 minutes,
---
Runescape is a time time intensive game and if you dont have the time just ignore the cape it doesnt give you 20 maxhits and people making fun about you are gone with 2 clicks. 
---
Gl onwards buddy

It's hardly a niche lmao serp outclasses it in like one piece of content

People make the argument that Jagex is luring them like the pvm content in the wilderness didn't have to pass a poll first.
---
&gt; but getting there is just so tedious and micromanage-y with run energy if youre doing ZMI
---
Do you not do herb runs? You don't even need one whole basic energy potion to do a lap at ZMI.

Purge all xenos.
---
I mean not really, although there is a problem with the knights I feel like this is just something to put the blame on, it‚Äôs like saying once you‚Äôre maxed you shouldn‚Äôt ever go things mid levels are able to do example being less intense bosses like wildy bosses
---
Dharok's requires 70 in your melee stars so you're still a bit from there.
---
I mean, GWD still has that open slot for Zaros. Nex is not a bad boss by design at all, it's actually a very fun fight. It'd arguably take less time to develop Nex than it would be to create a new Zaros Champion too. Show Nex some love
---
That doesn't even seem worth it, cammy tele and running to catherby takes almost no time at all
---
i tought i could run past fence in level 48 eastern wild and get into members area, but i saw lesser demons, got scared because i thought they would instantly kill me so i had a plan to train so i could get past them.
---
It could be something along the lines of similar stats to bandos but with a slight def increase (maybe to all styles or just mage ect)
---
It's a shame it wasnt perm, every few weeks screenshots of him appear on reddit being a complete prick

stacking downstairs bad. stacking upstairs good.
---
It would involve two pkers if you brought anti-pk gear. That's the whole point, now you're not defenseless. Though even if you choose to run away you're still in a fight. You consent to pvp as soon as you cross the ditch, it doesn't matter if you are looking to kill people or not. 
---
You could argue that the pvm content makes it difficult to bring anti-pk gear and you would be right. That's because of those wildy NPC weapons (craws bow). And the skull mechanics, though you don't have to bring +3. Some people do enjoy killing bosses in the wildy believe it or not. There's plenty of videos on youtube of people doing anti-pking and having fun. You could try that instead of running away.
---
I've actually been wanting to learn to duo bandos if you're down my rsn is tokindabs
---
Regardless of China‚Äôs appeal Runescape still exists and is very strong on it‚Äôs own. Perhaps it‚Äôs a benefit for Jagex not being well known. Too much spotlight makes you arrogant and do stupid shit like fire employees for supporting one of their top players for voicing an opinion against Hong Kong... and taking winning money back. 
---
Blizzard was a much bigger company even long before signing with Activision and they‚Äôve become a lot more media hungry than Jagex/Runescape ever will. And perhaps that‚Äôs not really a bad thing.
---
Classic asshole not minding there own business..

Ely is bis at arma, inferno, bandos and zammy. Neitz is definitely more useful than that, especially considering bandos and zammy are just pet content

This is black knight propaganda, delete this.

I personally LOVE Sarachnis. I‚Äôm pretty new to bossing and PvM and Sarachnis is great for learners! As a high level it‚Äôs pretty difficult to get stacked out and KO‚Äôd while there, and even if you die it‚Äôs very easy to get back and recover your items, so it feels like a safe place to learn. 
---
The fight mechanics are fantastic for those new to bossing:
---
It requires prayer switching and management of minions with different combat styles. 
---
The freezing mechanic is good because it gives the fight a basic rhythm that you can learn, which a lot of more challenging bosses will have. 
---
You get penalized, if you make mistakes, but it won‚Äôt cause an outright failure. 
---
Also the drops are good enough that you do feel rewarded after a kill.
---
Nah, allows you to keep items on death. I'd buy it for my rune dragon alt.
---
I was going to say either dungeoneering or clan citadels, but I like this better. I miss HD.
---
You don‚Äôt really understand why the high level community didn‚Äôt like it. Their big issue was that a best in slot shouldn‚Äôt come from a mid level slayer monster with no mechanics.
---
average looking dude's pics and bio have to be on point my friend
---
Rock the legends cape instead of the obby cape. It's a lot more respectable
---
What do you mean plenty of mid/low level players would have killed knights
---
People who say you get rsi from tick manip don't do tick manip
---
So this is what max players do
---
Because in the poll they don't talk about monster level or difficulty. Most assumed they would be hard with interesting mechanics.

It literally doesn't matter at all when you do it so you might as well do it early on

Nice.
---
Theres over 400million fully semiautomatic extreme capacity dragon assault daggers in gilinor, more then the total population. I'd like to see them try to take them.
---
Imagine thinking things that came from pre osrs that had no balance matter. Also prossy isn't used for anything other than afk slayer, black mask isn't bis for anything other than slayer, dragon defender isn't bis, nez hasn't been bis since zulrah, and the blow pipe comes from a harder quest and a boss fight not afk pray mage monsters.
---
It was made with stolen assets from private servers. After it got loads of attention, the dude making it was basically put in a position with two options.
---
- Relinquish the code to Jagex, which would have probably gotten him sued.
---
- Take it down and go back into the shadows.
---
Maybe if he had given the code to Jagex, they would have just built on the solid foundation he had made and we would have a HD toggle by now.

I don't even PK so not sure what your point is?
---
keep her
---
Yeah if they removed the Wilderness back then but not free trade the PKers would have screeched for a few weeks and then literally no one would care, and it would have had little to no effect on the game. Vast majority of players don't give a remote shit about the Wilderness, so anything negative update there has little to no effect on anything else.
---
And these people who dislike the Wilderness and wouldn't give a shit if it kicked the bucket have other options for PVP if they get that itch. PVP worlds, BH, LMS, Sand Casino, POH Combat Ring even. Those who aren't PKing aren't losing out on any real content with removals.
---
Not for a while, we have a new boss coming already and osrs has no need for much more.
---
Ironic that Blizzard is an American company and jagex is pretty much 100% owned by China. This current debacle is quite interesting.
---
I mean yeah the requirements say mid level but did you see /u/Gregbuckingham kill one? Maxed and took over two minutes.
---
It's all just relative.  The mixer is just for how you want the sound categories to compare.  Putting them all at 1 is essentially the same function as putting them all at 4; it just depends where you put the game volume on your computer.

Do you think that kurasks bering released in 2005 might have any correlation with that at all? Do you think that maybe, just maybe in their day, kurasks were infact tougher then their next up counterparts dust devils?
---
Those minus chaos altar are the only updates pvp has gotten since 2013

So if basilisk knights are midgame content why do they beat the piss out of maxed players in end game gear?

If she came out in 03 that would mean she's 16, legal in Canada and quite a few EU countries
---
I personally prefer amethyst mining with varrock armor 4 and expert mining gloves. Very low effort and good money. I also kind of want the mining pet over the fishing pet.
---
Infernal eels are about the same gp/hr in my experience, and you don't have to run around to bank. I don't have experience with sacred eels, but I think they're pretty similar.
---
Most old content is mechanically easier, yeah. Sort of defeats the point of comparing Knights to other content thats relatively older, doesnt it? The level requirement is pretty much arbitrary.
---
Most EDM is still around 100 BPM
---
Like Michael Jackson would have
---
The Wilderness bosses and Wilderness Slayer weren't designed with anti-PKing in mind. You feel like you have Down syndrome trying to fight any of those NPCs with gear meant to be effective against players, because it doesn't line up with what you use against NPCs.
---
So PVMers are unofficially expected to risk their PVM setup, additional anti-PKing gear, and any drops they might have already gotten? That's painfully one-sided when you have brainlets running up to you in salad gear. 
---
Jagex literally plopped these updates into the Wilderness to give something to PKers and make them shut up for a second and give them easy targets.
---
And you people wonder why almost every PVP poll is deflected now.
---
I leveled to 85 because I failed the +5 39/40 times. The one time I hit the +5, it went to +4 before building my ornate box, and I about lost it. Ratcatchers not done btw

trout cursor is the best cursor hands down!

Dart tips you'll usually just break even, so its not great for money.

Eels are awesome, very AFK. 
---
Hunter for XP you can do the monkeys in the MM2 tunnels. Also definitely do birds nest runs. Thieving sucks for AFK, unless you wanna use mousekeys for pickpocketing knights.
---
I think they kill other players because its fun
---
Fair enough. I don't normally recommend skillcapes in this thread though. Not too many people with 99 Con asking about Karambwans.
---
If you have enough gold, ~5m you could just buy a bond! But thanks, hope you make it!
---
So if a player supports the Chinese government instead of the protestors, would they also get banned as well?
---
Just no.
---
That‚Äôs awesome gz man
---
&gt;according to the wiki page it's defensive stats aren't that impressive (30 defensive stats is puny considering even white knights have like 70)
---
If you ignore the base defense sure, calculating bonus and the base defense stat, White knights have 51.1 defense vs crush, basilisk knights have 186 vs crush.
---
Because on the off chance that someone does make an account with one of those names, they're screwing an innocent player. On top of that, it'd be really easy for the owners of the bot farms to pick up on it, and just change the fucking names of his bots.
---

---
Just stay up til 10:30am, problem solved!
---
Well yes, ever had a valid argument man?
---
The so-called "victims" of the falador massacre were all paid actors by the pmod puppet government to sway public opinion against pking and it direcly led to the banning of player on player violence in the wilderness!
---
The real reason pvmers vote no to pk updates is because when the wilderness becomes healthy enough to be pker vs pker, pvm and skilling areas won‚Äôt have a reason to be in the wilderness anymore so they‚Äôll all be removed
---

I have paid attention to the news. You are telling me info that I already knew but I did not tell you I know, so you assumed I did not know it. 
---
Jagex can tell what they want 3rd party client devs to have, but they cannot make sure players themselves are using acceptable clients with acceptable plug-ins, so there is no enforcement in the perspective of the players, especially with new clients that Jagex has not issued cease and desist orders to yet. Until they can detect which clients and plug-ins each player is using, game integrity is still threated by 3rd part clients.

1023 kg seems a little underrated

Yeah, I don't understand what people expect. Taiwan's only independent because it's an island; Hong Kong wouldn't last 24 hours.

The falador square comment? Definitely parody. Give it a listen when you get a chance. Good song

Honestly, I'd just go without the pickaxe and shield. Those bits look ass.q

They plan to have a shared bank if it is possible. You‚Äôll also have your own personal bank
---
i revise my statement to DWH spec
---
Come back to it once you can afford supplies.
---
Also it's a game it doesn't matter if you suck at it. You won't get better at anything by complaining about it.
---
Underrated comment

Which is funny because their voter base is mostly overweight old people only living because of government aid.

was fashionscape the reason why they were there
---
Sir this is Wendy's.
---
Are you saying that a monster with hard mechanics would raise the price of the drop because the content takes longer? Or that because they are afk the price goes up?
---
So I'm using the "vanilla" client?
---
Personally I like eels, sacred eels might be better money now but scales can easily change. I like infernal better becuase their value is pretty static. Whichever one you prefer though.
---
i love it. I also use one of the old UI interfaces with fixed mode on. As long as I have stretched option on its great.
---
So to be clear: the reason there can be more sells than buys on the graph is because for some reason everyone is insta-selling and not many people are insta-buying?  Wouldn't that mean there's a shortage, and prices would naturally rise to equilibrate?  Yet the disparity has been around forever with the item in the graph.

You can in WoW as well. Their issue is over reacting to a situation that could have been dealt with by a simple corporate statement of "The views and opinions of those in this show do not represent those of Activision Blizzard or affiliates." 
---
If you get a job there, then yeah fuck your opinion.
---
I have been downvoted enough for my opinion here so idk what ur saying.
---
Wave3:weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Quick break even or slight profit skillcapes are fletching and cooking. Theiving is actually relatively fast, but it isn't afk at all. Do NOT auto click. It is against the rules and you will be banned.
---
They just got a bunch of cash together and communicated their price fixing outside of the game. Every day they'd buy all the ess in the game and then they dumped it all.
---
Wow killed osrs
---
they're Jeremy Scott adidas
---
Most people use it. There are many small QOL changes that completely change the accessibility and ease of use of the game. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd continue playing if it was banned honestly. 
---
Things as simple as WASD camera, enter to chat, ground item text, and bank tags just make the game so much more enjoyable without changing the game at all.
---
Or they know that nothing will ever pass a poll and are pushing the design and then they are going to rework the polling system for Bh specific polls so we can finally have an update. Since ya know it‚Äôs been 4 fucking years since a meaningful update.
---
I use it, QoL features like having item names appear for dropped items (so you don't have to right click every loot pile) as well as giving GE and HA prices on hover are super useful.
---
Most people use some sort of client, yes. Runelite is the most popular atm.
---
Make that booty way bigger smh
---
Giving them 2 banks would be OP unless they get same ammount of spaces such as each bank has half the slots
---
that's a very cool shield, 80def req
---
Super checks out
---
Uh.. Ahrims or Ancestral? There isn't really one.
---
actually that makes sense but if it was 1 day for like 300k gp rather than 14 days. just make it so you can split a bond to 14 shards.
---
Implying anyone here has a girl.

Good idea!

Is it free to download? And can I get banned for using it?

---
Not even regen brace? lol
---
Define shit
---
Being owned by the Chinese and having a huge chunk of your market be Chinese are very different. Jagex has a vested interest in appealing only to westerners as our game apparently doesn't appeal to many Asian cultures, while Blizzard has about half their consumer base there. So while Blizzard is not Chinese, or majority owned by Chinese, they still have more of a vested interest in appealing to Them than Jagex would IMO.
---
I could definitely see Winnie the Pooh, or Tiananmen square jokes going poorly for both companies though.
---
amethyst bolts are pretty high tier but i agree amethyst should have some other uses
---
They mentioned on the QA that this is a possibility. It would be a much smaller bank though that is used to share items and each acc would maintain their own bank as well if they decided to do a shared bank
---
What about the 3rd client fiasco you guys are having atm?
---
Isn‚Äôt that ds2 or something?

You stop lol

Don't worry they'll tell you.

Yes but their only going to 1.5 if you dont account for minning

You give a mediocre mid level noob hope!

How many days did it take you? 75 hours?

---
For most peoples actual play style, runecrafting really isn't as slow as the memesters like to pretend. The way that people *actually* slay for example, Runecraft is quicker than Slayer.
---
Ya well a steel 2h is two handed but Vannaka be out here like "ya so?"
---
That would benefit bot farms too much for jermflux to green light
---
That would lower the price of bonds, not increase it
---
It's free, make sure you get it off runelite.net not some random website. And no you will not get banned for using it
---
o fair point prob a bad idea then
---
Astrals are really chill
---
It's in their best interest to be as vague as possible so no one can point to the poll when they make changes.
---
Using diamond dragon bolts in this example, other bolts might net you a hefty loss.
---
This has never caused an issue yet and Jagex has not bowed to them in the past unless you have examples
---
Jagex is owned by chineses lmao , so not a good move in this case ;P
---
[deleted]
---
I was starting to hate theiving training which was sad for me as it was one of my highest skills back when I played rs3. This has made me much more interested again. I might even go for it being my first 99 :D
---
Yeah it's free, and no you won't get banned using the official runelite distro. There are some up in the air questions about the menu entry swapper plugin, so avoid that one for now, but all other default plugins are fine.
---
In my opinion, cerb is a task not worth boosting.
---
The crystals are great, but it will use a lot of your supplies.
---
Why don't you get the slayer level, get the boost in combat and then take it on?
---
Getting one of those crystals early won't help you as much as having the permanent levels and killing cerb without worrying about your boosts.
---
Saves you bothering with the pies too.
---
Lucky fuck
---
Well fuck me, and here I am alching
---
The anti-graceful set
---
I really don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want to do that lol.
---
It‚Äôs going to be a lot of runs. And after my last run I realized the extra pray on nezzy helm is better than god coif so I‚Äôm wondering what else I could swap
---
There's no reason to have a high level anything except combat so that's a moot point.
---
How so? As far as im concerned amethyst bolts are nearly dead content.
---
They are participating, they are just choosing to not fight back. If you walk into a boss room, don‚Äôt attack it and it kills you, you‚Äôre still PVMing you‚Äôre just bad at it
---
I did not know that I could just carry it
---
having a separate shared bank would be nice, i'm not going to be happy to have someone go and take all of the group's gp and die with it doing a clue scroll in the wildy
---
The only reason the BH2 rewards failed the poll is bacause of anti-pk voters (like we have seen numerous times in the past)
---
Thanks dude!
---
Making cannonballs is totally not worth it from an efficiency standpoint. That being said I still make a ton of cballs on my iron because it's incredibly AFK and I can do it while paying 99% attention to something else
---
Once you get scammed that first time, you learn to never trust anyone. Very important indeed.
---
Con consist of rebuilding the same item in a boring ass room at least most other skills you can move around or change what bank your standing in.
---
Of course! You can hop in the in game cc chat for further info
---
The "over half" statistic was true about the Warcraft movie and I believe the Hearthstone app. Mobile gaming is the goldmine in China because regular videogames lower your social credit score the more you play. A low social credit score in China can get people fired, ban them from public transportation, or even get them imprisoned.
---
Alright! Fair point.
---
Also why are you buying bonds off the site to sustain your membership? It‚Äôs more expensive than a subscription.
---
3 brews to 1 resto?!?!
---
I barely take damage! I need all the restos I can hold
---
Lasa√±a
---
Feel free to join our PvM/bossing cc ‚ÄúLegacy PvM‚Äù :)
---
Yeah, that would be my question back to someone if they said "no" to the idea. In this case, range/mage pots would be sunk out of the game into these items, and the potions would still be useful as they would have no delay on use.
---
Basically advanced 3D cookie clicker. It's not "fun" but damn is it addicting and DAMN does it feel good to hit important milestones. You feel like a monster when you first get barrows gloves.
---
I think farming all the mats to 99 and then having everyone use them to max the house would still take longer than a solo player buying and getting 99 themselves.
---
I can't imagine both would be useful though, unless they create some mansion specific things to use that are very helpful. 
---
Unless they make it clan citadel-esque where you can train skills super efficiently there once a week for a certain amount of xp. 
---
You'd likely just stick to one or the other.
---
and also saying giving to the beggars is not helping anyone, they will hop again and ask for more.
---
i think they should go one step further and literally remove the wilderness, just make it a giant gaping hole on the map.
---
All the bankers would be shouting streamer names lol.

That's what people don't get. If it's mid game content, then it shouldn't be end game gear. Hell, other than untradables, every other end game gear comes from end game content. Zulrah, raids, vorkath, GWD, demoic gorillas, etc etc.
---
You have the reaction time of a brick
---
Bro amethyst bolts are far from dead content. They are cheap and strong. Blowpipe is too popular though which makes me glad that basilisks require shield usage.
---
Pest control... 
---
Fix barricades and put the xp on hp...
---
It's also 101 bpm.
---
W
---
This comparison doesn't really make sense, because the point was that Knights were too easy for the money you could make from them. Buffing them made them more dead content for everyone, not just mid-level players.
---
which is supporting HK
---
poger, sell it and buy pegs now
---
yep, so if you take lots of damage you should take 3 brew doses and then take 1 restore. that's really good though.if your only problem is jad then you got this, you just have to be in a chill state of mind.
---
I did not, tried getting one but rng wasn't kind. Hence my rc is staying at 20.
---
Is the cc team paradox
---
They don't own virtually everything. They just have it spread out well. It doesn't matter if Chinese own 10% of 100% of a company, either way that company now will make a conscious effort to not piss them off.
---

---
big boned you mean
---
U can buy them ingame on a desktop
---
Honestly people probably downvoted me because of the meme that runecrafting is bad or whatever. Probably just jealous that they can't blood RC :)
---
Didn't think that was the case anymore
---
Some small updates won't do any harm imo, support.
---
Hes doing it for gp. Doesnt ever say hes doi g it for members
---
Scamming, luring, buying gold, and even botting are all allowed and perfectly fine as long as you don't get caught. This is the freedom osrs gives us.

HAHAHAAHAAHHAHAHA

Did you miss the part where they‚Äôre both owned by the same parent company?

And actually they have a 33% MAJORITY stake ‚Äî which is why the new ceo? You guessed it, is a Marlboro lobbyist.

Lodestones for suuure
---
its actually pretty decent
---
I feel like sarachnis is mostly dead content for end game players. And that's exactly how it should be. The only people there are pet farming. A mass majority of worlds are empty there. Not sure why you'd want to make it annoying to farm when it's already rather empty.
---
Fastest way to train rc? Ive gotten to lv 68 using lamps and Tears of Guthix 98% of the same, havent actually trained it since about lv 56. I was thinking of doing Ourania Altar or doing steam runes...I have 80 mage that I can boost to use Magic Imbue, but im confused how that works without talismans
---
\&gt;PKing in wildy is fine to me, but forcing BiS items out there then calling it a positive update is laughable. 
---
What are these BiS items you absolutely NEED to go to wilderness for?
---
\&gt;Make PvP actually involve two PKers. 
---
Wilderness is a dangerous where anyone is free to attack anyone. You're acting like the PKers prey on innocent PVMers with no risk whatsoever. That's not true. They get hit with other PKers and teams, who then are at a risk of facing even bigger teams. 
---
I'm fine with bosses being safe spotted since the difficulty balances out by being in a PVP area. Otherwise it would be just laughable.
---
swamp man good
---
Quickest and easiest way is just to bank at zanaris tbh, don't even go through your house.
---
I need to learn the way of enlightenment or some shit. Weed isn‚Äôt cutting it lol

Easy untrimmed HP
---
I tried wow classic and idk I was super underwhelmed. I learned some rotations on hunter and I felt like it was just pressing the same buttons over and over until either we wiped or cleared the dungeon. The game play loop is kinda boring tbh but maybe I didn‚Äôt get to a high enough level.

You put the wrong logo over cooler Daniel, it should be the EverQuest logo

yeah slayer is slow when ppl max combat in nmz
---
If you're 75-78 magic ibans blast with tome of fire is just as good so whatever you want to do. If you're 79+ it's pretty good yeah. A lot cheaper than using a trident.
---
Explaining it is xp waste
---
I had the exact same thought, bought pegs :D
---
OH!
---
Blizzard is probably interested in the potential market I'm guessing.
---
That's how I first originally came up with the idea but instead of suggesting it, I was going to tell somebody to make a bot client that just stands at the GE and does it instead.
---
Could you imagine a useful bot?
---
I think if they put a banking character by those areas they would spring back to life. Most of those areas are too far from a bank to make it profitable.
---
Doing it for membership:)
---
And all the other new singleplayer triple-a games with artificial "progression" that have double exp weeks.
---
That's how I got baited when I was a noob. Just got back into rs and saw a double exp stream (one where the QA team is talking). Heard of double exp weekends in RS3 so figured they were doing it for oldschool aswell.
---
Got cleaned for something like 5 mil back then. Today I have a 700m+ bank, so who's laughing now?!! (They still? I guess?)

You do need a whole bunch of food for Dream Mentor, why not get rich and cool while you're at it

Cheers.
---
Hi there. Actually, if you watch the video, I click within 0.5-0.6 seconds of the first frame the ball is on the screen. Since RuneScape operates on a tick system of 0.6 seconds, this should be fast enough. Have a good day.
---
Dude then ur dumb, buy membership with cash, noy bonds
---
Honestly if it‚Äôs alchables and an average pker can profit 300-500k an hour it won‚Äôt be.
---
If a really great top tier pker can average like zulrah money per hour then it won‚Äôt be. 
---
If bad pkers can break even while learning and having fun then it won‚Äôt be.
---
If it‚Äôs balanced well then honestly it can revive the wilderness
---
But the click was almost 1 second to slow. Thats like playing on 1000 ping.
---
I gotta say, its a very social game and if you dont have buds/guildmates playing with or at your level its gunna be pretty lame. Im almost 60 but im ready for some of the endgame material before heading back to the proper mmo
---
Whats up with the idea of being able to make 1-2m/h from jagex when PKing anyway? Back in my day we used to PK for fun and what we made depended on how well we did and what our opponents risked
---
plugin is banned, get over it
---
Blizzard punished the guy for saying something that most likely violated his contract and fired the casters that allowed him to do it. The punishment they gave to the guy might have been too harsh but i think their decision was justified. The same thing could probably have happen if some guy told everyone to vote for Trump in 2020 but instead of everyone getting outraged, people would just call him an idiot.
---
I go for it everyday lol, TheStoner001
---
tick clearly doesnt start the exact frame you see the red ball 
---
amazing how you have no idea how ticks work
---
Lmao I can picture someone here making the argument that since a rainbow's in the game, white hoods should now be pointy for representation
---
How would that make it dead content? Black mask is under a mil from a much weaker npc and relevant
---
You know what, I'm just gonna say it. I still like WoW Classic
---
Wow is a game that actually requires you attention.
---
Am I in bizarro world? Is the fact that a game requires engagement and cant be half-assed while watching TV an actual criticism?
---
I thought exactly the same thing at first glance
---
I thought they were just recently purchased by a US Venture Capitalist firm?
---
Dude, it's a white fucking hood. Stop overreacting.
---
Exactly, being so receptive is a double-edged sword. It gives a great platform to receive constructive criticism, but an equal platform to threats etc.
---
This is amazing lmao it could only have been improved if the guy got away
---
Hi there. I understand how ticks work - this comment was addressing the [parent comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dg02nl/its_nearly_impossible_to_react_to_the_basilisk/f37d1qq/) stating that I was wrong that I clicked within 0.6 seconds. 
---
I understand you can click anywhere within a tick cycle and your next tick can start 0.1 second or 0.5 seconds after you click. It appears for Basilisks you must click on the same tick cycle to actually dodge the attack, which even if doubled would be rather steep.
---
Wait what? Haha
---
Use Ana in a barrel -&gt; Me (hard)
---
I have fiber optic internet so it's pretty good.
---
I always thought it was a bit harsh from the gif, but imo looks very doable. Other people here say you can just afk it anyway. So this isnt the only option.
---
Even if the "3 to 1 positions" was true, this could simply mean they are hiring an external company to do this now, and don't need that many internal people working on it.
---
Yes, it is subjective. But just because something is subjective doesn't mean that there isn't a general consensus. And the general consensus is that BfA is a bad expansion.
---
To make quality posts that add to the discussion more visible than low quality shit that has no relevance.  Upvotes and downvotes don't exist to create an echo chamber for the majority.
---
Yo shithead say who you think you're being. Talk like you are better. Sit the f\*\*\* down
---
oh come on, they're both great games! Let's not start this.
---
Downvoted because im jealous
---
I feel like people say all these "criticisms" and don't realize they apply to osrs as well.
---
Its perfectly fine to prefer one over the other. But you don't have be so one-sided
---
yeah jagex is cool and locally owned and operated, not like those *checks notes* chinese overlords?
---
My thoughts exactly. They can't seem to do anything right in the eyes of edgy redditors. If I'm so shit at my job, might as well quit and let the leet programmers of Reddit take my job.

---
Like... what's the harm in limiting the things we consume somewhat? I definitely  could be doing more by not buying Nestle  and meat products but that doesn't mean I should do less lol
---
I personally see an issue with the vagueness because many plugins can be considered to result in "using fewer clicks than you would when using our client." I will list some examples to give an idea of how broad this can be interpreted (this isn't me saying I want the plugins removed):
---
1. Ground items: Ground items literally bypass the necessity to right click a stack of items to see the list of contents.
---
2. Ammo: shows current ammo and quantity a player has equipped, bypassing the need to open equipment tab to see.
---
3. Default world: Even something as seemingly harmless as this can eliminate the clicks needed to select a desired world when first logging in
---
4. Item charges: bypassing the right click check interaction
---
5. Login screen: can enable ctrl-v pasting, bypassing typing in your username
---
I could easily give 10's of examples. I'd say about half of the plugins technically can be interpreted as a function falling under the banned description. I don't know what the final solution could be, but the right thing to do now is to make an official statement that no action will be taken against accounts using current plugins unless the plugin was specifically listed on the banned list (also meaning no new plugins should be added/used for now). 
---
Ultimately, I think the community and devs need more time to converse about which features/plugins are acceptable before any action is taken against the community. If there is anything the devs should be stern about, it's that fact.
---
I have that as well. I get under 20 ping on all other games.
---
Getting downvoted because people think I said you were wrong üòî
---
Nah.. Jagex is just as shit. At least I can still log into my blizzard account because it hasn't been hacked.
---
Ticks operate on 0.6 second cycles. So you can click at the 0.5 second mark and then move the next 0.1 second, or click at the start of a tick (0.0s) and wait another 0.6 seconds for your action to register. 
---
It seems for basilisks you have to move within the first tick of the attack, and the animation for the attack starts before the red ball appears. So by the time you click it's often too late to actually move since you'll be hit before your movement registers. You can avoid this by moving around them every attack so you're never in the same tile for more than 0.6 seconds but that seems pretty click intensive. My recommendation is to slow the attack by a tick or two so that players can be rewarded (i.e. not frozen) for paying attention, and actually have time to react.
---
2k dry is why people hate them
---
The level range in pvp worlds allows for extremely imbalanced matchups. 
---
Example: a "prodded" level 63 (example stats: 50 att/99 str/60 hp) can attack a level 50 (example stats: 50 att/62 str/55 hp). It's obvious why many people don't like pvp worlds, especially with the large amount of rushers camping the GE.
---
BH isn't perfect either, because if you fight someone who isn't your target there's a risk of either person's target interfering in the fight.
---
&gt; bind "1" to a key of your choosing
---
so... like... just press 1 on your keyboard? why would you rebind it?

I love how you think you're correct yet every single person is saying you're wrong üòÇ
---
Same thing can be said about jellies, or any other slayer content that people decide not to block/skip. Never have I seen anyone say cave horrors or jellies are good money, excluding the people saying that because of the recent basilisk knight buff... Some actual good mid game money slayer tasks would probably be gargoyles or kurasks, right? Now those are weak and relevant.
---
L0l u ok..

---
Not sure I agree - it's a lot easier to make money as a member. A couple of farm runs a day could cover the bonds if you do them every day. I guess it boils down to how active you're planning to be.

What is your point? I feel like we are on the same page here unless im severely misreading your comment.

Yeah bro. Despite me forced to be completely focused on wow I still couldn‚Äôt get engaged. Different strokes I guess. That‚Äôs why I stopped playing it.

Please make this into a sticker.  I'll be your first purchase.
---
Never said it did - The animation for the freeze attack starts before the ball is on screen. I'm saying the travel speed for the ball should be lowered by a tick or two so that you can visually react to this attack.

It costs about 1.2m an hour to run a Scythe assuming you're not missing any hits vs 1.9m for a blowpipe with dragon darts. No one complains about the Scythe because it costs a shit load of money to operate and the Rapier exists. It's still 1m an hour with rune and 500k for adamant. 
---
The twisted bow is strong, but outside that and Blowpipe Range is pretty shit besides some Black chin's which are also debatable as to how good they are. We have the DhCB which was amazing once it got buffed. Then they introduced the lance and now melee is better again. 
---
Range has 2 weapons that are good, ACB and Diamond Dragon bolts are nice but they're no rapier. 
---
Range should be **SLIGHTLY** better dps than melee unless there is a degrade cost involved. You don't operate a Blowpipe for free neither is a Scythe free to operate. 
---
Nex, needs to be so god damn hard that the items she drops are used to kill her. I think people forget that as we creep the monster's we ourselves need to be creeped. While that does make shit like slayer easier whatever, it wasn't hard to afk with a cannon to begin with. 
---
I think power creep is fine as long as it's not like Vorkath, Hydra, and Zulrah where they shit out alchables at 4-5m an hour. If it's 15m an hour the first month because the new items are 4b like with ToB. Sure fine, lets go. It won't be 15m an hour forever and will settle down to a normal stable money maker.
---
Lucky u
---
I'm so confused at this post. you got tbow by your 65th raid, then at 93 you got another bow and olmet? Is that right or am i just being retarded right now.
---
If thats the case your duo must have been happy with that dupe drop to him.
---
gzzz
---
Wtf man, that's sick
---
Could just be where you live relative to the servers I guess?
---
Am I really missing out/making the game harder for myself if I don‚Äôt get full void? I never have had void even when I played 10 years ago. I see void recommended on like tons of boss guides and I just want to know if it‚Äôs really worth it.
---
Thicc
---
Im sure it does, you think amethyst bolts are good.
---
You should see the statement the Chinese Blizzard sites gave regarding what happened, they don't even mention the tournament rules.
---
I'm just agreeing with you, don't mind me
---
Nah probably not
---
just means ill never get a good drop bossing
---
Just finished the 82 grind last night! Now I have to  let my kitten grow up......
---
newpipe for mobile
---
LMAO didn't they ban people for having negative opinions on the pride event??
---
Yeah this is brought up a lot when talking about an only hitpoints training method, but sadly the lowest boat requires 40 combat level to join.
---
I wish this were possible though, I really do.
---
You would pretty much have to make the game easier imo most people aint down with spendig hundreds of hours to get into some content.
---
Here‚Äôs a tip, emerald bolts make profit even if you have to buy the cut gem(cheaper than uncut) and the bolts. Plus it‚Äôs a lot cheaper to start off with too
---
Oh for fucks sake kid, if you care that much go download the client. Its a free open source fork of runelite anyway.
---
Yea I got my first item at 65 kc, which was a tbow. 69 kc I got ancestral bottoms, and 93 kc I got tbow + olmlet pet
---
Stealing creation, Summoning, Chaotic Long Sword, Soul split
---
back in 2010-2011 I pked 20m+ a day... Pking use to be the most profitable method to gain money outside of nex or duel/dicing.
---
OwO
---
I might be missing something. But dragon bolts are 951, gems are 494, and emerald dragon bolts (e) are 1036. That's excluding rune costs, how are you profiting from it?
---
If I die (not in the wildy) with my dragon defender, do I keep it? I saw that if you die below level 20 in wildy you just have to pay 40k to fix it. Is this also true in the rest of the world? I just got my first dragon defender after 1,200 kills and do not want to lose it lmao thanks
---
Just the chinese
---
Those threads are full of blatant misinformation amidst the kicking and screaming.
---
If you die with it above level 20 wilderness, you lose it
---
That is, unless you use a [trouver parchment](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Trouver_parchment) on each piece
---
Just my two cents here, the Jmods are torn on what to do. There are people like you who make these claims. Then there are people on twitter who scream if anything becomes easier. So their literally stuck. If they make it easier people will literally harass them. If they don't people will literally harass them. Its a bad situation. On top of it, there is pressure at the top to make more money.  So it makes a bad situation even worse.
---
Dude we're on Reddit, a platform that has avidly silenced its critics in the past in multiple affairs. There's nothing we can do about it without petitioning the government in which the company resides. I agree with your opinion (to an extent), but saying it doesn't change anything. I still think everything Blizzard has done in reaction to this event is ridiculously overblown, but (in minuscule way) understandable.
---
Companies are not a self recognizing entity. There has to be a built up morale of ethics to get genuinely good things done for consumers, or profitable inventive. These gaming companies are now just tiers of thousands of people answering to their superior, and all of them will do what gets them closer to a raise, or promotion. I hate the way the world works sometimes too, but I won't apologize for explaining it.
---
Can we please have this in game? like lvl 60-70 tier gear this would be so epic!
---
I was, very grateful! I said ‚Äúthanks for being an iron man X‚ÄôD‚Äù then the champion  said I would of gave it to you anyways.
---
Do you know how many cannonballs you used, and how did you make the bars? And did you drop the cape on f2p or p2p worlds? I'm also trying to get that cape, and would love to know how long I'm going to have to spend at blast furnace. Currently getting ~2300 bars/hour I think.
---
Seems like there's only a 50 coin difference now
---
Lava runes
---
You know there‚Äôs someone harassing Jmods for the OFFICIAL stance from jagex on HK protests right now. I welcome the WoW refugees but I hope Jagex remains silent. No need to get involved.
---
Geomancy is solidly useful I use it all the time even as a maxed main.
---
I say do farm runs same time every day if your play schedule fits it. But it's also why I suggest doing a run before logging out (I do herbs), doing that run again as you log in the next day / session at a patch. And then from that first run heading straight into trees, fruit trees etc. Then play as normal the rest of the day/session. Ending with a farm run again as long as it was a 1+ hr session.
---
Make that a habit. And farming becomes easy gp making each week and you get 99 before you even realise. It catches all your skills.. then your higher skills... Then your combats... And then it's 99 and you're still farming having to break the habit of doing trees and fruit trees (if you don't care for pet or post 99 XP)
---
I mean, if you‚Äôre going to do all the quests anyway, might as well do it this way.
---
I think their activity is limited to rev cave racketeering these days. And scamming people in the process from what I hear.
---
Companies have a right to do what they want. and we have a right as consumers to say "we don't like your stance and we'll take our business elsewhere" we also have the right to try and convince others to side with us.
---
Whether or not Blizzard was allowed to do what they did is not really the issue. their rules could have explicitly stated "no supporting the Hong Kong Protests or we can ban you for life." people can still boycott them because they don't agree with that rule and we want to show that we won't support a company that holds that stance.
---
Lmao same thought
---
Because they cheated and used a JMod to cheat
---
No, it‚Äôs not their fault. If they want to artificially inflate the time to do something it‚Äôs THEIR game to do so with. 
---
You neets not liking something does not give you the right to rage against someone with daily temper tantrums.
---
I fucking hate these people saying don't politicize. Oh yes we'll ignore the genocide then sorry about that. Let's all just pretend this is okay.
---
hey its the guy that did the thing
---
Full arma, but I used a blowpipe
---
They're not owned by the same parent company though. The new exec is in there now because the previous exec left due to controversy. I suggest you Google majority shareholder, as it is by definition not would you just wrote. Like you said, it's okay to be wrong about something you nothing about
---
I'd buy this actually
---
Ok, is that running to the actual altar or doing the magic imbue?
---
Bliz wants to focus on mobile gaming. Which is huge in china. Its not about current profit but screwing up future potential.
---
it's not like google is bound by jagex's rules
---
You do have a point about reducing the need to afk, not to mention new players wouldn't necessarily know the best way to make money anyway. Personally I just afk'd something like mud runes (280 each, 13 rc) for an hour or two each day while doing something else, so maintaining a bond was easy enough pretty much from day one.
---
When you enchant bolts a window in the chatbox opens that lets you choose which bolts you would like to enchant. Since you should only have one viable bolt in your inventory you should only have one option available. Pressing the corresponding number key (in this case 1) will choose that bolt. Keeping it pressed down means that every time you click on the spell to enchant it will immediately choose the bolt type to be enchanted, increasing the cast speed significantly.
---

---
My thoughts exactly. I do like pvp but I just really don't feel like doing raids and dungeons just to get gear to pvp. Osrs just feels way more rewarding imo specially if you're playing an ironman.
---
You‚Äôre seeing it a lot because it is a big deal. You can never put what they‚Äôre going through into perspective so I don‚Äôt expect you to sympathize. In fact, I don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre going through either but if sharing an image is all I can do then at least I can show some form of compassion. 
---
We all face hardship but we hope that we never have to fight for our own freedom. And if that day came for you or me then wouldn‚Äôt you wish more people were educated about what‚Äôs going on?
---
That being said, I hope you have a good rest of your day.
---
Even if they‚Äôre buyables, no casual does that. So you either bought a ton of bonds to max some skills, have a maxed main to fund you which seems unlikely since you would have mentioned it devaluing that too, or you‚Äôre sweaty and just don‚Äôt want to admit it.
---
This is the reasonable opinion I want to see, versus down votes because people don't like how the world works. It's a company, and you vote with your wallet. 
---
We can't force Blizzard to oppose the Hong Kong protests, only incentivize them with more profit than they gain by allying with China. I will not be playing their games because of their actions.
---
I'm downvoting you because your comment does not contribute to the discussion.
---
‚ÄúGonna cut myself with a DDS‚Äù üî•üî•üî•
---
Where‚Äôs the lie
---
What's a divine potion?
---
they almost were but Fukong never finished the deal
---
Yeah so this is beautiful af. Only change I'd make is to maybe make the blue colour a little darker.
---
That's fair. But I think it raises public awareness of the issue and pushes Jagex to need to work on it or else risk further perception that they don't care about the integrity of the game, which at this point they ostensibly do.
---
Alright, so where's your video on RuneScape corruption?
---
You got me
---
I'm pressing x to doubt.
---
I'm sure this will get downvoted to shit, but I would love to see a revamp to RC experience rates and RC methods.
---
It can still be hard and grindy, but I would like to see it balanced where it doesn't require your sanity just to get to level 77.
---
I know, I know. A change would devalue those who have already maxed RC. But whatever. At the end of the day, this is a GAME, not a full-time job. Goals need to be challenging, not impossible to attain.
---
RS Classic went through major QOL Skilling changes and everyone survived.
---
I *really* doubt that Jagex are the most frequently or harshly criticized. JMods are highly interactive with the player-base, which leads to more direct channels of feedback (positive or negative).
---
For every internet-connected game I have ever played, you can hear players crying "Why [developer]? You have no idea how we play your game. Out of touch! Etc."
---
So where's your video about it then?
---
I would absolutely love a revival of these quest lines. Not so sure about the specifics but I support the concept
---
That's Japanese.
---
Barrows
---
What would jagec have done in Blizzard's shoes?
---
Chopping yews before work   
---
  
---
Call that morning wood
---
Just add Warding as a integrity change, tbh.
---
Weird that they didn't consider the quality of the future BFA release when they were criticizing Wotlk back in 2009.
---
Also woltk did introduce seeverla mechanics which would later contribute to bringing the game to its current shitty state.
---
My point is that Jagex cannot punish players from using unacceptable clients or plug-ins unless it involves botting. Right now, Jagex is only punishing the 3rd party client devs, not the players abusing the OP 3rd party clients or plug-ins. Both should be punished and the only way to do so is to ban all 3rd party clients and move the acceptable plug-ins to the main client.
---
&gt;you're the asshole assuming that I'm trying to cheat.
---
Oh wow. I never made any assumptions about this to you specifically. I just said some plug-ins are easyscape. I have no info about whether you only use the QoL plug-ins or the more OP ones as well so I never explicitly call you a cheater while you are explicitly disrespectful and called me an asshole and asked me if I was retarded.
---
&gt;And if you can't accept that, you can fuck right off back to 2007. You don't deserve any of the updates since then. No raids. No Great Kourend. No new content. Nothing.
---
What does opposing 3rd party clients have to do with opposing updates to the game in general? Both are not mutually exclusive. I personally want a better UI for the official client, no only the QoL plug-ins but also the ability use an action bar and keybind more things like RS3 has. If there was a 3rd party client of plug-in in existing 3rd party clients that allowed me to do this and I used it, would this be a game integrity issue or should this be allowed?
---
Please tell me English isn't your first language.
---
Running to the altar
---
I'm just gonna use my main account. I don't care about exp/time wasted and if I don't find it fun I can just jump back to the main and not spend any extra money/bonds.
---
yes
---
Maybe I actually am able to play on their tier, never considered that to be entirely honest. I've got a full-time job, functioning social life and have 3 dogs to take care of. I didn't think maxed sweatys (present or future) managed that either. Figured they were mostly NEETs and outcasts.
---
It's my fault for taking "maxed sweaty" literally and not realizing it was only a meme for people who play a lot.
---
I apologize.
---
Probably reduce jiggleflex profits too much tbh. I wouldn't buy membership anymore I would just do this because I don't play everyday. I think a lot of people would fall into this category.
---
wow's graphics aren't tooo far off from osrs lol
---
PERHAPS WHO ARE YOU
---
Taking a break to play wow, but definitely will be my go-to during slow times.  Still so much that I haven't reached yet in osrs.  I just like grindy games, so it's perfect.
---
nah somebody still has to buy the bonds
---
How can jagex even detect the plugin?
---
That's why you're the one who made a video about it, I suppose.
---
I've done dozens of ma2 capes and ran into pkers maybe 4 times
---
boring vs boring. Who wins?
---
I would bet you my account there isn‚Äôt a single other game where a significant portion of the player base can name the entire dev team. I‚Äôd bet most wow players can‚Äôt even name one. 
---
This community is without a doubt the largest single group of players that daily harasses its devs.
---
Nah man speed it up
---
Nice info! I got my outfit in about 7 completions so not too bad
---
He's not affiliated with Blizzard and had every right to express his political views. That's like saying that actors shouldn't tweet about politics and "stick to acting." They're people, they have opinions, and they have every right to express them.
---
I sure could use one for my inferno attempts lol.
---
Didnt this get posted literally yesterday?
---
I've got one, how do I join the gang itself
---
Maybe he likes fashion
---
You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Jagex has set up lines of communications with tons of pkers specifically, and gotten a lot of in depth new content ideas and a huge list of things that need to be fixed and have done fuck all with the information. So yeah, after years of doing nothing people are rightfully pissed off.
---
Still worse dps than obby
---
He‚Äôs a very inspirational rapper. Reminding people it‚Äôs less about talent and more about who you know to make it into Hollywood
---
Jamjocks please just this one thing...
---
I hate these type of people in the cc.
---
Literally nobody cares
---
:-(
---
Idk how you got a bludgeon out of that guy telling you to wear full obsidian for better dps.
---
You're actually fucking dumb lmao
---
New boss Dagannoth Queen (whose lair lies under the King‚Äôs) drops a ‚ÄúDagannoth spike‚Äù that attaches to the Seercull. Just a thought.
---
Well a cop shot a protester with a live round, so clearly the 17 year-old was violent and deserved it /s
---
Ah, you‚Äôre right. Forgot about that bug
---
Hard to do anything without Jed feeding them IPs
---
You could probably do normal with 80-85 stats.
---
Corrupted it more about rng of the room layout but might be a bit of a push. You'd probably want 90+
---
Damn....its ***almost*** like that would fall into the second part of my original comment. almost.
---
i don't play retail at the moment because they completely nerfed the only spec and playstyle i really enjoy ^grrr 
---
what can i say? i joined WoW in the middle of MoP, fell in love with it and i'm optimistic for another expansion that feels like MoP. i agree BFA is absolute fart though, i've hardly touched any of the war campaign stuff, i just do BGs and arena when i play
---
fuck no blizzard better than jagex anyday of the week
---
Classic is here for you bby. Give it a whirl
---
He's a moderator of this subreddit.
---
Seeing as I based this on a post from around the time of Alchemical Hydra's release but I can't find it, I have no idea what it does, just that you'd use a Hydra tail on a Seercull and that'd somehow make both items worth something ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I've known about him for years. His best stuff was before his absence.
---
And yet you took the effort writing this, just so i would know?
---
Twitch chat is not a reliable measure of player feedback. Every game developer with a public-facing twitter gets messages like this.
---
My point is not that players are excused from behavior of this kind, or that it's any form of acceptable. It *is* industry standard.
---
10 Dragon bolts ca. 9200gp  
---
10 Diamond tips ca. 1700gp  
---
2 law runes ca. 356gp  
---
1 cosmic ca. 154gp  
---
Total cost: ca. 11410gp  
---
10 Dragon diamond bolts (e): ca. 12450gp
---
Am I missing something? I think you think that 1 bolt requires 1 cast, not 10.
---
\#gainz
---
Yeah wtf, abby demons have been top tier since the day they came out
---
They'd have to just add a new item, I can guarantee some players have been hoarding seerculls.
---
WoWs graphics are insanely better. I don't think graphics make a good game, but this is just dumb.
---
sorry for loss, always check for vouches on forums
---
Mod West is one of the best mods we've ever had. Seen Hosidius and Forthos? Everyone loved those.
---
You wrote an incomplete sentence with an improper comma, an improper apostrophe, an improper question mark, a misspelling, and an improper conjunction. It's impressive to fit so many errors in such a small comment.
---
I alched the 5 skeletal pieces and got plenty unnoted talisman drops. Also got a torstol seed. reeee
---
Not really. Now that there's even more competition, some of the more greedy hosts need a way to distinguish themselves to stand out so people pick their name from the board.  
---
Their loss though. Costs them 5m every 2 weeks for each alt.  
---
I don't think it will last too much longer tbh.
---
OSBuddy and RuneLite are both safe to use. RuneLite is generally preferred because it is community-driven and free, not run by a company like OSBuddy is. It has more users, and all of the paid plugins that OSBuddy has. I know RuneLite has removed some of the offending plugins that Jagex stated were against the rules.
---
Both are acceptable.
---
Yep, 
---

---
Get an epic mount then tell me you don‚Äôt feel fulfilled
---

---
Nothing in the rules about this though? Your entire argument is based on something that, as far as I can tell, you just made up.
---
I have a feeling we're most likely going to be forced to play private servers in 20 years for our nostalgia.
---
However, if OSRS does happen to go down, I would love to see an offline version available for purchase, added NPCs to help with group activities, so you could play Ironman and still have access to content like pest control, BA, and wouldn't have to solo TOB or Raids.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
......what
---
Private servers have always been a thing, they are bad for the game in a sense that they give members items with no real membership, but once the game is gone Jagex would be dumb not to sell it as a whole downloadable game with the ability to play with chosen friends over the internet. It's just a way to create capital over a property that is no longer profitable in the same way it was in the past.
---
I play both :)
---
That's quite a stretch you're making, all Blizzard did was ban a person for making a controversial statement. I believe that companies should have the right to make such rules if they see fit, even though I may not agree with the rules themselves.
---
I can give you a seers üòÄ/s

Just no

Because and see if this sticks with you the third time I'm saying it -- I do what they do against MY OWN government. I've been arrested, I've been tased and tear gas, had guns pointed at my by police officers and I promise you if the rest of the US ever wakes up like the people of HK have I'l be on the front lines here too. 
---
I know its hard for you guys to consider that not everyone is a coward like you are, but not everyone is meek.

I mean I'd get violent if the government came in and said everything I've worked for my entire life is being taken from me

Partnerships and elf quest line changes came from upper management, tbf. Also, a lot of the new updates have beautiful graphics, Prifddinas being one, Hosidius rework another.
---
Look into obby armor, it's great for crabs and nmz, almost exclusively alt armor. Full obby + berserker necklace is great for low defence monsters

Imagine putting so much work into Warding but not being able to implement it because players don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúhave to level another 99‚Äù (Aka, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want new content because then I‚Äôd have to play it‚Äù).
---
I‚Äôm not saying everyone who voted ‚Äúno‚Äù is like that, but those voices mattered enough with how close the poll was.  
---
The community itself is what will kill this game as long as voting remains the same.
---
wow, imagen being so nitpicky on reddit D: 
---
Seeing the replies, people could clearly understand it.
---
Edit: It's impressive you care so much about grammer, even when it is such a sall commennt.
---
Kinda looks like Ironman :(
---
PvP gear restricted to only PVP worlds or PVP areas would have been great. Revamped rewards from BH, rank systems, unique rewards for ‚Äòchallenges‚Äô (this was proposed a while ago).
---
Mostly I want to be rewarded for killing another person that is also engaging in PvP content. And similar ways to add more variety to the engagement.
---
I mean don't pretend these two things are the same. There's no drama about it surrounding OSRS. Jagex isn't in the spotlight for it, they're a much smaller company and their game is less popular, etc. 
---
I'm not saying Blizzard is in the right; they're not. But saying Jagex is owned by the Chinese is perfectly valid, because if they were in the same situation as Blizzard you bet your ass they'd be pulling the same shit. 
---
The point of bringing up ownership is to show how far-reaching China's influence is, and how many companies could have the same thing happen to them.
---
make it a rare spawn clue step that gives an equitable item related to the jmod in the picture.
---
for example the one fof mod ash could be "Ashy Tea cup handle" which is a ring makes your character stand in the alpha male wide power stance while idle
---
another version could be a necklace like the ham logo but it says JAG
---
Don't do it on your main. You don't want your main to be banned in case they'll decide to do so. And auto chat is considered botting so if you'd get banned it'd be for botting, it won't prove anything either way.
---
Uh I think something got lost in translation for you, but I would say I don‚Äôt think the terrible feedback routine is limited to the neets or the no changes crowd. I think it‚Äôs a pretty even spread problem with the osrs community
---
I wont suggest osrs to anyone till they fix the bot problem and stop worrying about a few op plugins
---
I'm sure this is the case. You can't have a Twitter presence for this game that's enforced by company rules then expect every message you get on there to be nice.
---
I think the only reason it doesn't bother Ash because he started working for customer support during like the early days around classic-rs2. He probably learned really quick not to take anything seriously.
---
I get how it works, and I do believe the public outcry will make them reconsider their business structure in the region. I still don't believe being born there, growing up and getting a job means that you "support" your oppressive government, but none the less they do finance it so I'm wrong.
---
Just remember unless they entirely withdraw from the market they will probably always have employees there for regionalizing the game.
---
What? I was talking about the original comment (now deleted, big surprise) - not you.
---
I agree with your original sentiment.
---
If someone could do a Tim Tbow photoshop I would exhale through my nose quickly

They‚Äôre violent, buts it‚Äôs the cops shooting people and launching tear gas that are being violent.

So explain to me why the amount of pvpers has significantly dropped since say 2009-2010. Look up some videos if you don't know.
---
Do you know how packed the original BH and PvP worlds were? More importantly why?
---
I'll tell you why. Incentives. If there's not enough incentives then it's not worth doing.
---
Blizzard made one mistake mean while y'all are up in arm every other week if not more.
---
This post made by the anti-chainbody gang
---
Should have a set bonus
---
I like how this is obviously a joke but RS3 has an item that literally one-shots most monsters.
---
Try jad with 42 range :P doable with 90 def but easier to just wait till I get 75 range lol.
---
I honestly dont know the current issue with PvP or BH so somebody please enlighten me.  Most of my friends do pvp and they dont really complain about much.
---
This is the mentality of most of PvPers begging for updates. Pile a solo guy with risk but also bring a team because why should you have to risk as much as he does?
---
Absolutely pathetic...
---
I think it's too hard to generalize like that. There's fucking a infinite amount of genders why is it so hard to imagine that there's potentially more then two types of RuneScape players.
---
Pvpers vs pvmers, casuals vs neckbeards, nolstagic boomers, vs EOC scape zoomers.
---
Like there's some fucking complexity to the word if you look hard enough.
---
You're mean
---
D scim at 60 atk. granite hammer at 50. Brine sabre at 40. Use obby set with obby sword when u can afford at 60 atk 60 def
---
I appreciate this. Should definitely add more sound effects like Tele and other stuff.
---
Dragon armor should only Drop from Dragon Dragon
---
But should we solely rely on the devs to balance it? I mean we would not have this faceguard drama if they told use more about it or even beta test it.
---
Add EOC as an integrity change. It's time.
---
Not very often at all. In fact, I almost always got away. I think I was pked around four times, and I risked 40k each death. I flinched the boss with a God sword and world hopped after ever kill to be safe. I'd recommend having your world switch open at all times. And thank you for the grats. :D
---
BRO NIHILISM BRO
---
If you count the bots maybe
---
Love how you you think you know what everyone on reddit is thinking and feeling.
---
It‚Äôs mainly because this is the norm for the tech industry. Build your resume, move on to a higher paid job
---
Well I think that is just the natural result of free market profit-seeking news. In order to sell yourself the best and get the most views, you need to brand yourself as either comedy or outrage, neither of which are effective of bridging gaps and understanding different perspectives.
---
upvoted to put it at 169
---
My point is that one side of the community gets all the updates that ignore any type of integrity.  Like tbow and scythe. We have more melee damage output then 2012 with a chaotic rapier and turmoil. While range is so overpowered in pvm it‚Äôs retarded.
---
Then all of the sudden when something for another part of the game that they don‚Äôt participate in they all of the sudden start worrying about integrity of the updates. Fuck outta here 
---
Shits ridiculously hypocritical and is a massive part of the reason why pvp is dying. 
---
All I want is fairness in updates.
---
Nice.  Mind sharing what your gear setup/Inv looked was?
---
Swing and a misssss
---
Take my upvote and get out
---
put it in a pvp poll so it can fail and be pushed through as integrity later, outstanding move
---
The whole debate is whether China should give up control over it's own territory, that can be argued multiple ways and Blizzard is fully in it's own right to not take a stance on the issue.
---
How fucking dense are you to think wow classic is fairly similar to rs3?
---
Why do you think i brought up triple 90s? U can just do it with melee in 40mins. Range with 45 range would take multiple hours.
---
You're right I'll definitely add more osrs sound effects next time
---
Even under state ran full sponsered media you get similar tactics. I would agree the free market is to blame still though, just the path to the end result came a bit more naturally over time rather then enforced from the start.
---
Hell yea!
---
Facts
---
Wow, that was an interesting read.
---
No
---
My fire Cape was not a risk. Even without +1, fire is safe with my gear setup
---
Warframe. EVERYONE knows the devs.
---
haha dude weed number and sex number, NICE am i right fellow redditors?
---
I remember getting WotLK for Christmas and not being able to play any of the content because Dalaran would legit crash my entire pc LMFAO.
---
Surprised ur able to put in all the hours for this series.
---
What does the 13:37 stand for?
---
I thought it passed 7 billion and was like 7,1 or something
---
It sounds like you're just frustrated because you staked away your bank? Some people, who aren't real-world-traders, do make money at the duel arena. I also find more accomplishment in my skills than my bank.
---
If you use Gmail you can just add a "+1" at the end your email account. Eg "email+1@gmail.com"
---
It's the kind of pvp update that doesn't really give any new content to actual player vs player, and just causes pvmers to get more upset. There's enough pvm/skilling content in the wildy already.
---
I've been hacked by Chinese (ironic) goldfarmers 5+ times and have gotten the bans appealed and my account recovered within the hour every time. Not sure if their customer support changed recently (probably did with the mass layoffs), but customer support has been amazing for me every time I've had to deal with them.
---
But they did take a stance by an overly harsh punishment
---
I‚Äôll play till the nostalgia runs out then, I guess. :)
---
&gt; Then we will stop killing 3 item pvmers
---
Be honest with yourself, we all know pvpers will pick the helpless pvmer who isn't properly geared to fight back over the other pvper who has all the gear and knowhow necessary to send you to lumbridge.
---
lulz

Poll Warding as an expansion to slayer and as an unlock from a grandmaster quest. It'll pass with 97% yes votes.

This reminded me of the Tim Allen Doom mod. It is both majestic and the worst thing ever made.

I'd love to see the removal of pvp worlds. Itll do what the pvpers and jagex wants and revitalize the wilderness
---
&gt;Why even pretend you care lmao
---
Cause its proving lately how much control China has over what U.S. companies do? And that's kind of scary?
---
That is the coolest bandos tassets have ever looked!

for the love of god, yes

Hello Games received worse harassment after the scuffed initial release of NMS 3 years ago
---
Use at your own risk implies there is a chance you could get banned using it. There have been no bans and Jagex has stated that there won't be. There is no risk involved.
---
Congratulations, I've read at least a few hundred "look at this insane rng lmao" posts on this sub over the years and this is the first one that's actually enraged me.  You deserve for your first step out of bed to be directly onto a lego every day for the next 10 years in exchange for this.
---
Black chins and revs. Name another good money making method in the wild? Besides, bringing more players to the wild, regardless of the intent, will ultimately bring more pkers to engage in pvp
---
better than... *this* though, isn‚Äôt it?
---
How do i get a girlfriend?
---
It is still part of China tho? They are just like Hk.
---
Yea, I know not everyone is rwt, but dude you saw duel? how many ppl staking bills there..? And yea Im frustrated ofc, dont lie but why always win same ppl ? Yea I care bout my bank than skills since I maxed RS3 I do not want to get same pain here skilling so I decided to PvM+Stake
---
It‚Äôs sad that this account can make more GP/hr than 99 in any non-combat skill. 
---
Not to diss you OP
---
Ogre bellowwws
---
yea and chinas pretty much a pvp clan so
---
That‚Äôs English.

In my experience you get tinder swipe right on anyone slightly obese or chubby and start matching. Tell all of them you match with you haven‚Äôt slept with anyone for years saving yourself for the right person. Act shy but ‚Äúaccidentally drop I love you‚Äù as you end a phone call try to deny it. Claim it slipped out because your feeling are so strong. Bang and live happily ever after.

I originally started playing WoW back in middle school during WotLK thanks to my cousin and uncle buying me the game and the expacs on discs. Got all the way up to 80 and played for about a week. Then my family‚Äôs PC crashed and had to do a total reset, which meant my wow downloads were gone. Turns out those discs were one time use and my parents wouldn‚Äôt buy them back to redownload. I never got to play again until right before BfA came out lol
---
I loved that weapon. I was a huge pleb back then and struggled so much to get to qbd‚Äôs final phase to brandish it before I could finally use it.
---
Yeah people buying a shit ton of resources to grind out for the pet sounds awful for the game and it‚Äôs economy
---
Other guys aren't brief enough.
---
China's spending money on companies in US. Honk Kong is protesting against mainland China (sorta). Blizzard (and other companies) are getting money from China (basically). Blizzard is banning people who support the protests in China. 
---
So people say Blizzard is choosing Chinese money over American freedom of speech.
---
I‚Äôm definitely the only uim who got one from a crawling hand
---
It‚Äôs not even a fiasco, people are stupid. It‚Äôs blatantly stated in the TOS that anyone that draws attention in a potentially negative way risks what happened. No one bothers to read though. It‚Äôs a multinational business with a massive following in China. They were right to do what they did. Freedom of speech doesn‚Äôt mean shit when you sign a contract that says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt start shit or we will drop you from your job‚Äù.
---
Thankfully I don't have this problem.  My wife reminds me every Wednesday that it's Tears of Guthix Day
---
By killing people in unhealthy ways. When it takes multiple people to kill 1 person who isn't even able to fight back that's when you know the pk scene is dying. Most pkers would rather go for the for sure loot (pvmers) than actually nut up and fight other pkers, because at least there's a chance at dying then.
---
Not necessarily considering they both have the same exact impact\
---
I'm just not circle jerking to virtue signal and stroke my own ego, no?
---
Blizzard is a branch of Activision
---
If you're going to boycott, it's pointless to boycott one small part but not the whole company

It's like saying you're going to boycott Nestle by avoiding their bottled water, then go down the store aisle and grab some nesquik powder to make chocolate milk at home
---
I know but I dont get the reference OP... :(
---
I don't really need the seeds, I'm 99 farming already (IM btw), but I would like this issue to be fixed

Just started playing ret and it feels like osrs combat

I NEARLY left that cave unscathed, see i didn'nt even attempt Underground pass until 65 agility, so i actually managed to complete the entire quest without failing once, however when i went back through for Regicide, what should have been 2 ez trips became 9 and a half horrendous journeys. I fell probably 8 times throughout regicide, 4 of which were on the ropeswing, and i only brought 1 rope each time so i had to go back so many times.
---
If i ever do Undergound pass or regicide again, i'm brining 4 ropes and 12 stam pots

81 defence, 99 ranged, regular void, 70 prayer, 88 mage, 99 hp, 35M gp to blow on supplies.

I'm too stupid to get a zulrah kill, what's the most braindead "anybody can do it" method that there is? I've tried like 50 times and can't do it

That's venezuelan finger painting

Wow what‚Äôs this seercull item is it some kind of fan made bow? /s
---
Infinite special attack
---
Not that I own either , but  what is better at zulrah, using just a tbow or using just a Sanguinesti staff?
---
Make the slayer helmet block all pvp damage
---
It does matter. People are threatening them over something that is well beyond their control. 
---
If they were to let everyone post the pro-Hong Kong freely, China will block it. There would be no more Blizzard. 
---
They can‚Äôt afford to lose so many people. They aren‚Äôt Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.
---
I think I‚Äôm coming back
---
With all their pollution I'd say they're more geared towards PvE
---
Just have tbow degrade and need seerculls to recharge.
---
You made the same point that I said you could make about the gear, and I agree. That's the fault of Jagex not designing the bosses correctly. They also polled to add these wildy npc weapons which make the line between pvp and pvm gear even larger. I think those weapons were a mistake honestly. 
---
Jagex didn't plop them into the wilderness to make people shut up. They were all polled and passed. I don't think the majority opinion on Reddit is reflected in game in this case, people have historically voted yes for pvm content in the wildy. Most people do not have a problem with pvm being in the wilderness as reflected by poll results.
---
This recent poll had 80% yes votes for dagon hai robes, robes that would give a reward for larran's chest (also passed). Content that you say is only meant to lure easy targets is passing. Why? Did you vote yes for this content?
---
Can you please explain this reference? I just came back to this game after like 4 years away haha
---
90+ Magic

90+ Ranged

---
The higher your farming the better, and 78 herblore is very helpful too. Depending on your team you can obviously get a few CoX clears earlier than that, and you can probably start learning while a little lower than that, but if you really wanna be a helpful member of the team and raid consistently then shoot for those numbers.
---
I payed for a sub to classic wow like 4 days before the controversy, and man I wish I didn't.
---
Incredible! Mod Wolf will be missed, he really did care about the game.
---
I don't even know what's going on here, tell my family I loved them.
---
If you so much as mention increased runecraft rates people growth at the mouth lol dude
---
Remove freezing.
---
In return, have attacks that remove run energy instead and buff teleblocking.
---
Or make lava eels remove freezing or something.
---
"You disagree with me. You're just not experienced enough."
---
Ah, the mark of a reasonable and we'll adjusted person.
---
Just Range, Mage, Farming and herblore to grind then haha
---
Pretty sure the PRC can be classified as capitalist now
---
Yep, and pkers have provided actual feedback to jagex praise for literally years now like I‚Äôve said like 5x.
---
Nobody cares about convincing you to change your mind because you‚Äôre a random person who thinks they know what they‚Äôre taking about and doesn‚Äôt want to be convinced otherwise. I‚Äôm just replying so anyone who reads this thread doesn‚Äôt take your ‚ÄúnO oNe iS sUgGeStInG cHaNgEs‚Äù BS at face value.
---
Learn just 1 rotation and reset until you get the one you want if it's not that rotation
---
Thanks, I will take you up on that!
---
No, if it crosses the ditch it's an automatic 'no' vote without even considering the pros and cons.
---
with pray bonus: robe top +6,  skirt +5 are already in game
---
hood +2 would be completely reasonable addition to game for 1-def pures to play with (not devalueing cw halos still giving +3)
---
Yikes. Google that shit, lol. How you've avoided seeing it is beyond me but you should read up
---
How would you recommend finding a clan? Using the forums? Sorry haha, it's been a long while!

Absolutely not

Of course it is

You calling other people neets while you encompass ever quality of a neet, just imagining you sweating profusely while aggressively typing is hilarious to me

I don‚Äôt live in Hong Kong, seems irrelevant to me

I don‚Äôt have 30 points to cancel it with.
---
And an ~8% reduction in cost of Bstaves.
---
I've been found a few times when I've done hard clues but i'm pedantic about only bringing 3 items, so I even protect my spade. 
---
One time I was feeling really daring and bought my seed pod as a fourth item, which I didn't get smited for.
---
I probably risk more in combo food then I do in the black dhide and rune crossbow and 50 broad bolts I bring when doing wildy masters.
---
Yes, I don't get out into the wilderness much.
---
they used to have these https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bot_world

Abyssal Sire. Been getting pleeeeenty of talismans, seeds and herbs -- all rarer than unsired. I want to die. I've done 62 kills in the 6 hours I've been home with a handful of breaks to keep my sanity but holy shit this boss sucks shit. No wonder the Bludgeon is expensive, because I am straight up not having a good time. But hey I got a dagger from the one unsired I have managed to get yesterday so silver lining. Gp/Hr is still incredibly shit for the requirements and effort.
---
I consider a month worth of fun to be worth way above 11$ and its beyond me why rs players are complaining about that membership fees. Hell if I wanna go bowling its fucking 30$ for 2 hours...
---
I imagine this being like, really dramatic, moody lighting, all that just like an assasins Creed game trailer, and then it just cuts to a clip of a guy failing the varrock agility wall and then black screen
---
No blizzard is choosing Chinese money over human rights issues, not American freedom of speech.
---
Should've been had a magic boost from release during classic tbh
---
My kids are coming back. Wasn't even that long
---
Neither does blizzard
---
buy a shoulder parrot for a sixth
---
Solid arguement
---
Nah, classic WoW is better but fuck Blizzard for doing what they did.
---
:( gonna merch to make my ~8m back... was rematching that guy for 13m a million times but nobody was dying plus it was late so i went to bed... hopefully hes on tnt so i can get what's mine back !
---
Imagine thinking slayer is the game
---
Well yeah, rs3 can get fucked

I honestly think that meme is older than 4 years

It just seems Chinese as fuck to ban you for 1000 years

Excellent post. Thanks for sharing.

Especially  since the pvp worlds dont gain reward potential like they used to. I'd say remove pvp worlds or add the old system to make say woodchopping with risk work it in pvp worlds

They wanted the extradition bill killed and they eventually ended up getting it but at this point its too little too late so the protests continue.

Nice! I've never had a 99 in 15 years of this game lol. But I'm going for 99 farming as well. 2 weeks left!

It isn‚Äôt hard. Tears goes toward your lowest skill, which is slayer for me. You don‚Äôt get slayer points doing tears of Guthix. So I don‚Äôt have the points to cancel this task because I only level it through tears.
---
Like shit you act like people using tears for slayer or runecraft is unheard of.
---
hk police are bridders
---
I‚Äôm not sure who you‚Äôre preaching to though. What I‚Äôm saying is people are aware of this and people don‚Äôt care. People buy Chinese goods everyday knowingly. The blizzard outrage doesn‚Äôt have to do with them simply being affiliated with China. It has to do with them using virtue signaling for browny points and also attacking players based on political opinion to protect a nationalistic perspective. Most Chinese owned companies or companies selling Chinese goods aren‚Äôt so outrageous as to attack other people publicly and apologize to China for those people.

And you expect this to help you with slayer how?
---
good god I wish I had 100k+ views on those, they peaked around 25k views per episode, a ton more came in after By Release
---
13%
---
At 7k ea it should be 483k, 420k is 86.9% of that
---
he he he he
---
well if you think about it, circle jerking to virtue signal and stroke your own ego is exactly what you‚Äôre doing. it‚Äôs just that your circle isn‚Äôt the same circle as his circle.

Actually I wasn't training slayer, I was training mining, and since I hate mining, I also set up a cannon and high-alched between rocks. I've trained slayer to 80 and then realized that Brutal Black Dragons were unlocked at 77 and said "woops no point in any more slayer lol"

He's trying to call you a nazi or kkk member. He's assuming you wanted him gone because you're a "homophobe" or w/e.
---
Bold of you to assume we assume you can have a girlfriend when RC is on the table
---
He never mentioned the numbers of quests, so I'm not sure what the data you reference is in reply to.  He mentioned that the Zeah quests are so minor most people barely count them; you're correct that that's subjective.  However, I assume one of the 11 you're counting is the Halloween event that they pointlessly converted into a quest with a corny clone of Draynor Manor?
---
I know you'll say it's subjective, and I suppose it is, but come on.  Those 5 sequels happen to be the only 5 major quests OSRS has gotten. 50% of all quests (excluding the halloween event) and 100% of all major quests in OSRS have been sequels.  There's a reason everyone here is disagreeing with your assertion that all they do is add new stories.  It's just not true.  I would vote yes on Elemental Workshop 3, by the way.  It's a fine suggestion, but it doesn't do you any favors to build it on false pretenses.
---
I play retail WoW and OSRS they're great combinations.
---
WoW gets the blood pumping and when you're sick of losing you can go and relax on osrs.
---
It's soooo nice.

Then she knows the same technique that Vannika knows to wield a steel 2h (2 handed sword) and a dragon square (q handed shield). An yes, it is a technique you learn how to do it in an rs3 quest

By all intents and purposes, China is the product of implementing Communism. Deny it all you like, doesn't change the facts.
---
Had I realized you were a Chapo beforehand I would have not engaged in a discussion with you. I certainly will not continue it.
---
Only thing I suggest is that you read some more books. Have a good one.
---
Extremely brief summary is that China wants their laws to apply in Hong Kong, and they want to be able to extradite citizens to China and punish them there. 
---
They actually dont want Hong Kong to have it's own government, just be governed by china and chinese law. But have settled for the extradition language.
---
Monk hood is sick yes pls
---
Oh well I was a lazy cunt and would just follow someone for maximum afk
---
That and the graceful cape
---
This makes no sense. Of course you could reinstall the game, the codes were only for activating your account.
---
Thats fair. Once i settled into eso i realized its the mmo ive been waiting for. I find it rewarding for any level of play, insane amounts of content,  replayability, great rp. I think more people would love it if they gave it more of a chance. As a dnd player it really is the best mmo of the era in my eyes. But i understand its not for everyone.
---
Of those 6, you have a Halloween event, and several quests teaching people how to find their way around Zeah.  The title of your post says "instead of making new questlines all the time."  Give me one time in OSRS history where they've created a new questline, and I'll go away.

Yes, any untradables with you are kept without being broken and they don't count for the 3 items kept. The only exceptions are Ring of Charos, Lunar staff and Chronicle, which are all destroyed if they're not one of the three items.

It doesn't matter a whole lot since your items are on the ground for an hour, so you have plenty of time to get back to it and loot it regardless of where you died. Except if you die on an instance, then items dropped are lost, but you keep everything on you (including untradables)

I was reading out loud in like 6th grade and I pronounced formaldehyde as formal d'hide because I'd never seen that word before but immediately thought of RuneScape haha this was like 04-05.
---
It‚Äôs nothing you have done. 
---
It‚Äôs a random and annoying ongoing issue.
---
but won't he just attack me with his ranged attack if he's snared?
---
weapons can't titanforge. literally just talking out of your ass.
---
Now I gotta weigh starting over vs going back to classic
---
Mordaut, Nieve, Kree'arra, Zilyana, Konar
---
cuba has internet lmao
---
Graduate job? Near about average where I am. But I live on my own, I don't have a second income, I don't live off my parents. To be honest I'm not surprised that there would be people in the RuneScape community that would render it unfathomable to actually pay their way in life, as they grind osrs all day and have their mom put frozen pizzas in the oven for them. It may have been two years but I certainly remember and don't miss the sweaty nerds.
---
Ah okay cheers!
---
Monkey from MM2 feels left out :(
---
way back in the day they release capes for how long youve been in game and my account was created in 04 so i have... duhn duhn dunnnn the 15 year cape ive log over 420 days ingame
---
You are the true bwana.
---
i think meta is to reroll until you get one xD
---
You still need to run to altar with magic imbue mate.
---
VOSRS, osrs on release (with making con work, fixing launch bugs etc.)
---
Whenever I talk about OSRS to friends and such I just describe it as an advanced version of Cookie Clicker
---
Drop a pet rock too
---
Ah I wasnt aware of that, thanks!
---
I might start classic lol
---
There's a skip option for content they're not familiar with. Their opinion on early game content is just as valuable as any veteran.
---
Can I? I didn‚Äôt see an option and just thought it was a flat perma ban.
---
There is an equipment tab as well under the attack skill guide, where they really should be located.
---
I liked the idea of warding and the rewards were good but I still voted no. Runecrafting is the most hated skill in the game and fills the void warding would've. 
---
None of my friends voted yes for the same reason. None of them are maxed. 
---
The community is toxic because we can't voice our opinion if you're a minority. You're either a neck beard or a brainlet who hasn't read the blog.
---
Do some low end quest. Most of the free to play ones you can do with combat stats in the high 20s low 30s
---
more wilderness bosses
---
OSRS players love passing things that are bad for the game too.
---
The general population doesn't care about the game's health. They'll just pass any content that makes skilling easier, reject anything that might devalue their current gear, and fucking decimate anything that might benefit someone that likes PvP.
---
I got a key yesterday but haven‚Äôt gotten around to using it. It‚Äôs my first one and I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre even for besides unlocking his chest in 50 wild? 
---
And then you sprint for your life to 30 and tele?
---
Goliath Gloves confirmed
---
Yes get 99/99/99/99/99/99 and go to deep wild
---
I‚Äôm not paying for those
---
It‚Äôs a solid game for sure, I just got a new job so now it‚Äôs stopped me from being able to play at the same time as my friends. Which is why I tried to log in today to OSRS
---
You need to have at least 100 tokens to get in is what he meant, it doesn‚Äôt take them on entry.
---
So sad that range already has a ton of content. This is such a cool looking concept. I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing it in game.
---
Fuck that butt burgler tim allen cock muncher
---
Your range and mage levels are good. Pretty sure you use blow pipe and trident at zulrah
---
One of your pets is beating the shit out of you
---
Nieve and any of her sisters/cousins, Konar, Anyone from lunar isle, Any elven girl, queen Ellamaria, Vyrewatch, Zilyana, ect. Also why didn't anyone draw Nieve getting gangbanged by gnomes yet?
---
If you have 40 Prayer you can protect from range to take 0 damage
---
üòç
---
gzz
---
I played runescape because my computer was too shit to run WoW.
---
I finally got a PC upgrade with WoW BC when it first came out in like 2006 and honestly, I enjoyed wow, but when my subscription ran out I just chose not to renew it, and went back to Runescape instead. I was simply more hooked on Runescape.
---
2006 to me was the absolute peak of my fun on RS, as in 2006 I was still pretty new, and still had a lot to learn and new places to see. 2007 was still great up until trade/wildy removal but like any MMO I just found it less fun as I neared end game content. 
---
Being a noob is the best thing when playing an MMO, once you actually know what you're doing that's when it starts to suck.
---
Hmm not sure how to feel about this...
---
Ohhh okay yea, do all defenders have the same drop chance?
---
All apart from the dragon.
---
Draynor has a fire right next to the bank. It‚Äôs a fireplace.
---
u get muted for anything in wow, got a 24 hour ban for having the name 'peepee'
---
You can't even have pets out while your doing con
---
Good stuff. Not quite as cool as buddy kits though
---
I regret asking.
---
Lesser demon butler
---
Oh alrighty, thank you
---
I too remember when all the WoW classic players voted in the T bow and blowpipe. Fuck those guys.
