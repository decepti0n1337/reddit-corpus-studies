That's not the point.

---
He added something to the game that only Ironmen would ever have need for.  
---
It doesn't matter how few people use it, it should have never been added in the first place.
---
---
---
Or how about just buffing the Arcane so it isn't complete shit and the tomb wouldn't be a straight upgrade? You also don't know how long on average the tomb would take to get so saying it would have been quicker/easier to get is complete speculation.
---
Do it with melee. It’s easy enough.
---
Yeah, personally I’m against the tome. I’m also against the way some of us behave.
---
That kid more manly than 80% of new york
---
The idea of the grubby chest was that if you get a key drop, you can get the supplies and use them on the spot. What's more likely, that the intention they quite literally told us they had for the chest is... Well, that, or that they used the chest as a backdoor for something that no ironman ever will use?
---
Gonna bwuk you up.
---
the signature is a nice touch. i especially like the framing on this work.
---
But why not open a new client to log in?
---
Just ignore him and hop.
---
I tried that
---
Tough luck? but they changed lock picks.. saradomin wizards.. ploughs.. competitive environment my ass.. They decide what they want to change based on how many people cry about it.
---
That’s the twitter nonsense, I don’t have links for anything there though.
---
It's a meme. The first time Rendi did the Lev 18 FC a couple Kemp Q fans were like "I saw it in his discord it's Kemp Q". They were just talking out of their ass, and they said the same thing when Rendi's record was beat.
---
I think you missed the investment
---
Agree
---
I def. clicked the jad one,I was gettin exp all the way till jad cause I was watching waiting for 91 to hit. The task ended right as I killed jad an if I did click the other one I still didn’t get my 100th task points. I didn’t gain any points at all.

Saylor by any chance?

and that's why no one remembers your name
---
^or mine
---
Ummm. Maybe 3rd party clients. Fake email. Fake runescape website. Your friends. There's your answer
---
It is easy, but probably not for noobs? I never really saw a need to try it but I know how if I wanted to.
---
Might wanna turn your private chat onto "friends" or just off, that way "people" like this won't waste their time simply ruining your day.
---
Simply put, sand crabs are not the place to look for friendly interactions with other players lol
---
this is kinda sad
---
There's a clues roll step at the volcano as well if that counts.
---
Higher than this
---
A lot of people.  They're not gunna phase out Bandos any time soon, so why would they completely destroy anything to do with Corp?
---
&gt; Sorry dun wanna waste time arguing with you
---
Yeah me neither. Given the way you type, I wouldn't be surprised if you even understand what I'm saying. If you can't see how extracting a raw resource and selling it takes more time than extracting a resource, creating a finished product and then selling it, then it's hopeless to continue further.
---
Later.
---
I highly doubt that was the idea at all.
---
If it were then there wouldn't be a roll for stuff like noted Herbs and Runes.
---
Never had that happen. People have been reporting a lot of bugs after the cold fix.
---
yeah sandcrabs is major aids.
---
id highly recommend trying to knock out quests for fossil island. or at least turning your private chat off and being ready to hop if you run into someone being petty.
---
I meleed jad on rs3 before I realized you didnt have to... After getting the cape. It still sucks prayer switching for jad three way
---
This wouldn’t be the best content. You clearly haven’t ever been to the blast furnace.
---
Lol saltyyyyy
---
Nah. I mean why dun you just open a new client before you are blocked? Coz I play two account at the same time and often logout automatically because of sometimes need to focus on one account. And never got any log in problems.
---
What’s the real price atm?
---
RSPS's back then: "Wow! This server even has a working AGS spec!"
---
RSPS's now: "ToB was released a week ago, why don't we have it yet??"
---
Stop it. This is my new favorite anime.
---
Someone had 10 mage books lol
---
You're probably just bummed your mage book merch went awry
---
/s
---
But honestly, did you read the blog for their reasoning? It's valid. Items like this are purely power creep, rather than redistributing power, as they should be doing.
---
And here I am struggling with Galvek and Kruk at 92 combat
---
That's great!
---
&gt; It's next best to Ely
---
Ely &gt; Crystal shield &gt;&gt;&gt; arcane
---
&gt; people doing ToB
---
would use the tome instead(not that we know the price it would end up on), but the point people are making is that the new tome would make the arcane pretty trash, and I have to agree with that and so did Jagex.
---
I’m confused why mage book is dropping when it is now still BIS for mage?
---
Massive bot farm in 50 wilderness?
---
No....This is RuneScape!
---
I totally agree with you. But can't we just have one God Wars styled boss where mage is optimal and profitable? Like how we use a tank for graardor. Or Kree'arra you have to range. These bosses are as simple as they come, but require multiple people to be done efficiently. It'd be awesome if Zilyana was susceptible to magic imo, because then people would ice barrage her and such.  
---
  
---
Current enemies you mage include:  
---
Barrows, Dagannoth Rex, Lava Dragons, Kraken, Zulrah, and some raids bosses. I've heard KQ blood barrage can be decent way of speeding up kph by healing, but even regular KQ is terrible gp/hr. It'd be pretty easy to design a boss that is optinal to mage, but benefits from range and melee def.
---
Used to use OSB way back, runelite now. Never shared credentials with anyone personally. :/
---
What’s not true about it
---
I gathered aha!
---
If they polled 'should we make the Tbow 10x more common' it would pass a fucking poll mate. That's because we're players, not game developers. We vote on whether we like the proposed content, but 99.9% dont know shit about game design. So quit your bitching and quit making 3 posts to drive your point.
---
Wear ring of wealth, might get a shield half instead next time (:
---
IDK what that is my brother.
---
Xact or something was 16
---
Wait what happened?
---
My professor for thermo, he smoked us too
---
I agree it's absolutely disgusting. I also find think it's a strange coincidence MMK left shortly after the reddit memes about him, after he had the courage to stream on twitch. For all we know he could have been sitting on job offers and that could have been the straw the broke the camels back.
---
Lol usually I might merch for updates but I've been away from the game for a while, been looking forward to this update to bring my interest back to the game.
---
Get a few hunter levels and start doing bird houses, you'll be at 1070 total in a week for barely any work
---
Watching somebody perform like this hurts my heart. 
---
Don’t get me wrong... It takes talent to make music that people will enjoy. Be it a dj making songs on their computer or a band getting together and writing/recording songs. 
---
But this is not performing. I feel like attending a show like this is just so you can listen to the artists music on the house sound system with a room full of people. Very little in the way of showmanship. You’d get the same experience if the artist wasn’t even attending.
---
While I agree that the Nightmare still has plenty of drops, ignoring the community seems pretty stupid to me. If they thought all of the potential rewards passing would be too many, then they shouldn't have polled all of them at once. Maybe poll the armor and the mace, or the tome, staff, and orbs, and if all of whichever set of rewards they polled passed, then they could be done with it, if they failed then they could try again with different possible rewards.
---
But that's not how they did it, so they shouldn't go back after the fact and say "this is too many rewards so we're not going to put one of the drops you voted for in anyway."
---
Same thing is happening to me, I need two zenytes but keep getting the rarer drops instead, including celastrus seeds etc.
---
tob was a mistake
---
That’s a super tiny part of it man.
---
Look around this sub and posts from like 2-3 days ago there’s so many brain dead idiots who literally think it’s rendi’s fault mobile and the severs were down.
---
At the end of the day it all comes down to the counter circle jerk though. Reddit is retarded and predictable. Rendi was in the spotlight for too long so now all the idiots here have decided to hate him so they can hold their precious “unpopular” opinion and feel special and different again.
---
stop posting then
---
Checked OSRS website too on 4G, site can't be reached. Works on my work LAN but our network routes through Singapore.
---
Damn you guys are bad at rhyming, you really set the bar low
---
Jesus man
---
The idea is good, but this game is all about dps. The cost of charging time of fire is still worth more, imo at least. I like the concept though, and it definitely makes more sense given it’s a sea creatures object
---
Nobody  
---
C\_Engineer \*puts 1 billion gold bounty on himself  
---
Everybody \*tries to kill him  
---
also C\_Engineer :O
---
Can I equip goblin mail?
---
Oof that’d be hilarious
---
He said that after his 18cb, and then did it on 17cb. I don’t think Rendi is keen on being beaten
---
all the maggots downvoting better know why btw
---
Siren's tome would have a higher value than tome of fire, so it would have a bigger up-front cost but using it would be cheaper in the long term.
---
Similarly blowpipe used to be expensive on release but it was cheap to use because zulrah scales were quite cheap due to how unbalanced the drop table was. Eventually scales went up in value as Zulrah's drop table was rebalanced multiple times and other factors. 
---
So in parallel this is similar.
---
You mean the rare &amp; difficult to get in any meaningful supply brews and restores? Who the hell cares?
---
just wait till nmz mate. don't bother with any type of crabs lol, it's always shitty.
---
"the n-word = bad" is a far left talking point now?
---
You don’t need a website for this, wherever the first 45 spawns on wave 3 that’s where the orange 360 and jad will spawn
---
Voting has only ever given us veto power and this decision doesn't change that.
---
Nah would make iron man mode to easy, denied because fuck the game and how it’s suppose to be played.
---
This is an almost correct response to the situation, I think rather than completely removing it they should've offered to balance the stats on the tome. I'm sure many people would like to see the tome, but with different stats.
---
Why do you have so many downvotes on this???   One guy said to take the l in stride but that's what it looks like you're doing?  
---
I don't know why this is bothering me so much but I'm confused as shit about it.
---
fake news
---
Burnt pages are very expensive and the upkeep cost is what makes using fire tome quite expensive for the average player (basically a newb trying to use fire spells to train magic)
---
Oh I thought magic was only used is part of the olm fight and not much else? But still, magic combat only being useful in two late / end game activities is pretty unexciting. I Still need to get my range up and grind void for zulrah but thank you for the suggestions also.
---
Oh no no just wait for RC lvl 90s oh no no
---
Shows I don't really know ironmeta, I guess. I do actually brew stuff but I think I'm in a small minority of players that do; I haven't gone to Trouble Brewing though simply because nobody *actually plays it.* The couple times I've been there, everyone's just spam-filling buckets or whatever. 
---
I don't understand your point about Sacred Oil from Shades of Mort'ton as its only use I know of is within the whole minigame-loop for burning shades. 
---
I get that there's a few Fashionscape items locked behind minigames too but I think that's a minority of players that're interested, and it doesn't really excuse the games for being lousy. Unless one values the item in direct proportion to how shit it is to obtain. Stuff like they Chompy Pet &amp; hats or the gnome scarf just don't interest me at all.
---
Lmfao what a reach, the levels of salt are out this world.
---
I'm a bit out of the loop here, what happened this time?
---
I purposely hand in, got tired of people hopping in and ruining shit so if my game is ruined at least theirs is too if they hop into 409.
---
Try to think of a Jmod Reddit hasn’t hated for at least a little bit besides ash and maybe Kieran.
---
It’s impossible. I feel like we shit on all them equally.
---
Yeah, I find it ironic how the people who complain about toxic streamers are the ones that are toxic and trying to instigate conflict themselves
---
Who knows. They should definitely balance out the gap between the elemental spells. It's not very consistent having all of the other elemental spells suddenly get obliterated.
---
Air and earth tomes would be a solution to make them all somewhat comparable.
---
Again, this game is about dps cost aside.
---
Towards specific mods or towards Jagex? Cause Jagex as a company don't need people standing up for their feelings. I almost never see hate towards specific mods, off the top of my head I can only think of 3 times, including this one.
---
What game is this
---
tbh 6 BIS rewards from a team boss is not a very OSRS thing to do
---
pls veto the rest of the items too and give us some solo content :)
---
The bulkiness kinda reminds me of the knights of order in the shivering isles.
---
This is literally the only update I have ever wanted

Go ahead and flame me but it seems like posts in this thread that mention profit are getting downvoted.  Am I missing something or are people being jealous little bitches???
---
Use [this website](https://runeapps.org/jadsim_app) to help practice Jad prayer flicks. It's 2010scape models, but the animations are the same. You just want to focus on the jump animation.
---
What did I just watch
---
I WANT THIS
---
Drop nukes on em.
---
Which one is you?
---
would love a purple santa hat
---
Yes. 
---
This is why green zulrah is weak to magic, despite having a magic level of 300.
---
They, quite literally, don't have a commitment to anything. They are the game developers and own the right to do what they want with their game. The polling system was implemented to ensure that any updates that would potentially cause 50% of the playerbase to ragequit  would be screened out by the players.
---
oh no siren time op and devaluing arcane, rip corp. Oh no they fixed what everyone complained about but i invested in mage books so now i want it cjanged back to original! you guys simply cant make up your minds, i think if thats the case let jagex decide, and thats what they did
---
Boi getting a firecape is a cakewalk compared to zuk
---
Waiting for the next "lower the better".
---
For solo chambers theyre used for energy mostly
---
It's twitter. Just assume someone said "anything" and someone got butthurt. Twitter: the only bigger echo chamber of cancer than reddit. It truly is impressive how shit it really is.
---
That’s awesome!! I’m glad I could help! Yeah I have about 1100 bracelets that I need to alch still to get my money back haha. Probably will do it during agility as well!
---
I don't think stupid ideas should be enacted just because more people want to do it.
---
Jagex has a right to do it and I’m not disputing that; I’m merely pointing out that these micro transactions constitute real world trading and in principle Jagex has been against it.
---
I think the initial problem lies with Jagex though. It’s their game and they reserve the right to do what they want but the fact is if they weren’t sure it shouldn’t of even been polled in the first place. The way they have handled it makes their poll system look like a complete joke. 
---
Regardless of if tbow being 10x more common was polled it would pass this is a non issue because it wouldn’t even be polled in the first place. 
---
I agree with their decision but don’t agree with how they have handled it.
---
I've killed Jad plenty of times now but still get nervous. I can only imagine how nerve-wracking the final Inferno waves must be.
---
Yeah but you really shouldn’t be buying arcane at 400m bank. It’s like the last upgrade you want.
---
 Anyone wanna explain the significance of this?  Just a mere f2p pleb.
---
Because it's a useless bis. Mage book just gives accuracy, which doesn't matter pretty much anywhere mage is used.
---
Arcane gives accuracy, solid defense, and prayer bonus
---
"Hop out of the car real quick, just across this ditch"
---
Imagine calling the king "Chestbruh" and not "Chestbrah"
---

---
The industry standard?  What other comparable jobs pay?  Exactly what I've already mentioned several times but for some reason you've ignored
---
Chew gum. Helped me relax during my first cape
---
I wouldnt even say you need a good processor, it's an old game, it could probably run well on a Core 2 Duo, Definitely dont need 16GB, you really dont even need 8, SSDs arent necessary either, however if you were to spend a lil bit extra money on it, I would definitely say the best value would come from an SSD, it will not be faster like you said(aside from boot up times), but it will definitely be a lot snappier.
---
Making big hits being able (maybe not guaranteed?) to hit through prayer and having defense thresholds decrease the max possible hit might work if they could figure out the numbers. ex: A mob can hit from 0 - 70, every hit above (I dunno 50?) might pierce prayer, but for every X  amount of defense it has -1 max hit, those numbers are just an example but the idea is that you're increasing your survival rate in exchange of some dps
---
icons too strong
---
I'm mainly bummed I saw the sentiment around it, considered that it was gonna pass, and sold my arcane at a 15m loss from its 140-145m price before poll.
---
If I had of just stayed in leagues and been uninformed I'd be none the wiser and not be 15m down ahaha
---
a red spirit shield would look awesome similar colour to the ankou with white spine on it imagine that with a slayer cape
---
I had an ex who tried it for 2 reasons:
---
1. I tried it with her (fair play)
---
2. Her dad was apparently into it and had his own dildo.  Her mom apparently said that "the day you stick your thumb up a man's ass, he'll go crazy for it" and she thought guys were generally into it
---
Yeah basically every pvp revival idea is "add more non pking content to the wildy so I can easily hunt down people in non pking gear"
---
What happened to edgeville pking people who actually want to and know how to pk
---
Okay so I'm confused with the gem stall in the Twisted League. The wiki states it replenishes stock every minute 40 yet I can't for the life of me find an emerald (I was mega small brain and forgot I'd need one rod for my jewelry box)
---
So you admit to being a troll.
---
Potential: if passes, will continue to review if makes sense to add. If fails, no.
---
BOOOOOO!
---
That’s true, but for some reason yours is negative...
---
Not really worth bringing a spec wep if you have dhcb.
---
As long as they have been, since it's been like this already all along. Odd, right?
---
Yep I'm still waiting for a raid style in OSRS with a traditional tank role. Even gwd had this kind of setup where the boss aggros one person, so having someone decked out in tank gear is actually benefitial. Why they don't design more group content like that, I have no idea.
---
Literally this.
---
bank standing is a job change my mind
---
This is the controversial tweet. Further context in his other replies.
---
https://twitter.com/JagexHusky/status/1199464722116030464?s=20
---
Oh no! This book has been tangle by tangleroot! I can’t read what’s inside the book.
---
And that's why gwd still has tank roles because of its non-ease of access. Make a raid with similar mechanical design and suddenly we might actually have group composition with a tank role in this mmorpg..
---
Fair enough. I live in the woods and having to take public transit aounds like complete shit way to live. I drive 3 minutes to work
---
If it passed a poll it is too late. If a significant majority of the community wanted it, and it passed the poll, then it should have been added to the game. It got a higher percentage of "Yes" votes than all of the three orbs but it was rejected anyway. It devalues the polling system when anything that is voted in to the game can be rejected by Jagex for any reason.
---
you got me &gt;:(
---
Yeah I thought that was odd since he has been part of previous years and you have his outfit already.
---
Sorry for the garbage MS Paint tier post boys.

---
&gt; Xzact last time had the name "Rendi sucks"
---
Completely untrue. If anyone but rendi had that account name, then yes you could say they were flaming him. but that was rendi who had that name. There was definitely beef between kempq and rendi, which made for fun drama, but thats long gone and now ppl are looking to get there dose of fun drama here as well except there actually isn't any. Just go to xzact videos and u can see comments how "xzact is flexing on rendi and calling him out on it" "rendi on suicide watch" Same with the xzact reddit post. Why can't people just appreciate the achievement for what it is. Weaponized autism has united and done the impossible.
---
Rendi?
---
Get off the game and stop crying. You chose to play it.
---
We needed this gold sink
---
I disagree with killing healers. The golden rule for newcomers at jad is the "one game action at a time" rule. I.e; drink one dose of brew - go back to focusing on jad and watch for next prayer switch. Drink a sip of restore, go back to watching jad and prepare next prayer. Attack one healer, go back to jad and etc etc. Most people end up making a mistake because they panic and try to do too much at once and arent ready for jads next attack. As long as you have 40+ def you're fine tanking the healers. If youre using blowpipe ans off task you should be in tank legs/blessed or karils top/tank helm anyway. The extra defense is extremely helpful when first going about it, def recommend using it!
---
Bgs really speeds up the kill if you land I use melee void helm/ and piety then switch to rigour/ dhcb for kill
---
If you eat the same time you take damage, you get hit, your hp drops to 0, and then you heal up and live.  The 15hp is a detriment to a lot of these guys, if they could be permanently at 1hp it would save them time lowering their HP.
---
BGS is more popular when using blowpipe, since the passive effect of DHCB (which the blowpipe lacks) makes up for the benefit of the BGS spec.
---
Sick Nerd and Mod Ash’s baby
---
I knew you played runescape! I was right lol one of your comments said “buying gf” lol. I love your comments!
---
They already are phasing out bandos with the inquisitor set though... there are more places the new armor will be better than bandos than places where bandos will be better (assuming you’re using the mace vs rapier or bludgeon vs whip)
---
Are you mentally handicapped
---
Eek
---
That’s usually how it ends.
---
I've read a loooot of fantasy. It's usually sword, staff, wand, random magical enhancement item, etc. Yes, they might consult tomes or research them, but very rarely in fantasy books are wizards or magic users actually holding books in combat lol.
---
The idea that they would have a fucking book in their hand is more preposterous than the idea they would have a shield for protection.
---
It would not be that hard to patch tick eating, they have already made it so you cannot tick eat in PvP. They have just decided that it's a high skill mechanic that they don't want to remove.

what in the cinnamon toast fuck are you on
---
A negative saying that this is a friendly community and nobody is trying to take anything from you without giving it back, All dice bots are legit af, and if anybody asks him to go to a site so he can figure out how to win mills he should go in a heartbeat.
---
It'd have to be pvp-free or no loot on kill, otherwise it's still just DMM. Even with no loot on kill we'd still get clans controlling territory.
---
Polls are for content that the players would like to have, it tells the staff that the playerbase enjoys the idea. Deciding what is best for the future of the game shouldn't be in the hands of the player, it should be in the hands of professional game developers.

The ingame value would adjust yes, but it wouldnt adjust AS MUCH, most people would be buying single bonds, so the price would still cling pretty closely to a single bond price

---
Do Ancient Shards have any use in Twisted League?
---
I think removing the tome was a good call, fuck the entitled whiners. Some people will just vote for any new content, balance be damned.
---
Maybe in the future, content should be polled with only a few rewards, then if none pass, repoll with more rewards. Or, even better, a ranked system where the only top 3-4 (or however many) rewards enter the game. That way you avoid introducing 7 new items in one update and slow down the inevitable power creep that comes with that.

making cannonballs and yet edgeville not quest lock so ud think it is a bot being secluded

This is how we create addicts but I approve.

Fair point

PvM pures holla!

My little guys just starting

They are Hardy Gout Tubers that are only for the quest though which can't be used to get the medium Karamja Diary done. Sure wish it could though :)

You said you never saw mention of xzact/rendi beef, but my comment that u replied to, was itself replying to one that is falsely instigating xzact/rendi beef by saying that xzact named an account "Rendi sucks" which never happened

You can use them on the altar in the middle of the catacombs to teleport to 4 locations within the catacombs.

I just spent freaking forever climbing up this stupid pyrimid with my mid 30s agility. Second time.
---
There's no gold thing up top this time? Can I only get the 10k item once??
---
My bad, I got the names mixed up. I didn't intend to imply there was any beef between them either (I thought it was just friendly banter), but I can see how people would take that from my comment. I've edited my previous one.
---
Ummm desktop picture link plzzzzzz
---
Using the official client you're 100% correct. With third party clients gpu is utilized. Plus mobile. If I remember correctly, mobile is optimized for 60fps. While the other clients cap at 50. It's possible to increase the limit with your own client, the game looks awful/stutters. You can do some interesting things with the runelite GPU/Animation smoothing plugins. Java is easy to scoop up.
---
Xzact kind of showed how to achieve that in his video although didn't spend much time explaining

My irl 99 str skill cape that my mom knitted keeps me from procreating

I understand that, and was being hyperbolic to make a point. I don't think you've addressed/responded to my point.

And I'm just over here afking sacred eels while I work on finals...

The fact you bothered to dig through someone's comment history to find dirt says a lot more about you, tbh.

Hey mate, I’m out of the loop, can you give me the 10 second summary of what new boss this is? Or at least the name so I can have a look myself? Thanks

TIL the GE is a gold sink.
---
Nah fam, clean that shit before you smoke it.
---
Yes but there's no "z" in "exact". If you're vaguely remembering it as "exact" without the "e", you'd probably type "xact", exactly as u/Sow_Love did.  
---
You're right, but saying it's just like "exact" isn't necessarily gonna help is all I'm saying lol.

Graardor's ranged attack has a minimum hit of 15, for those who want a tangible example of what this idea might feel like. Think about how accurate that fucker feels. Great suggestion, OP.

Getting caught buying gold is only a 2 week ban??? Thought it was perma.
---
carry on then beast my apologies

You know I be burnin that Marrentill all day tho. POH stays hotboxed.
---
This is how it begins, eventually you start selling items to stake to male the cash back. Then you go on a monsterous losing streak and your to far in so you think you might as well stake the rest. 
---
I lost a 70m stake doing this and I had enough will power to say enough is enough and walked away.. I haven’t been back in two weeks and before that I was there every day.
---
Stop posting this and take it to the duel arena already god damn
---
Just make the min hit 0. 0-20 averages out at 10, 0-10 averages out at 5.
---
Yea definitely not worth it, better to just invest those points and do every 10th task at konar

We're already doing that by paying them $11 a month

My friend had an addiction. He did 2 things 
---
1. Told me to change his password(real life friend btw) and everytime he wants to login on the account he has to buy me a beer.
---
2. Play on an ironman, you can't stake
---
He made a video on this
---
CHEST BRUH
---
I love this thread; we're getting a lot of great ideas to explore. More items similar to scythe (in terms of hit, not necessarily the &gt;1x1 requirement) are definitely have a lot of under-explored potential.
---
ok ironman
---
That's where all the good flavor is though. It's part of why carpet dabs are so good
---
Almost all of these teleports are not point-to-point, making the lines either useless or misleading
---
how do i get a tree like that in my house?
---
I personally don’t like how RS2 eventually got protection prayers to universally be 50% instead of 100%, however I welcome enemies that can beat around it via being multi cb styles, having prayer disabling attacks, or can hit through it partially or fully. I feel like we need more enemies with those kinds of properties.
---
Wishful thinking.
---
A level 14 fc is far, far more difficult than a regular inferno run
---
Cant multibox on mobile =(
---
Max this account or riot
---
I mean if you're theorizing absolutely minimal xp you can assume you'll be 1 tick flicking virtually all prayer as well.
---
What happened?
---
You can tell before that. When he lifts up if the bottoms of his feet are facing forward range if they're facing the ground mage. You can tell almost instantly after he lifts up.

Lol you're projecting sooo hard here dude

Stop confusing being a total douchebag with aspergers. They have nothing in common.

Ah I see, thank you.

I bet he was brought back for the Lamar Jackson narrative

This is the same community that I saw laughing about the fact jagex even brought up the community being toxic. Kinda pathetic people would actively harass someone over a computer game.

Losing pray constantly down there

Most of the people i run into are friendly. Except for sand crabs, fuck everyone at sand crabs.

Kinda like the chaos alter. I have never been myself but is it a fairly common place to train?

Task completed.

For us regular joes we need to make reddit posts.

Have only tasted one in my life, but I thought about it frequently for months afterwards.

I mean negative criticism is also important. People just need to find a way to express it in a constructive manner. Being rude doesn't accomplish anything.

Selling gold is a transaction

Yes because civ 5 is a very unknown game.

were you listening to me or were you looking at the mole in the red dress

They only respawn if they get Jad all the way back to full health, in which case your ranged level/gear isn't high enough, pulling all 4 with a couple pieces of tank gear would be the best way to go imo.

Wouldn't be a twisted league then, now would it?

I think the drop despawns if no one is around. I’m not sure though

Game theory is mathematics, its formal logic.

You can feel whatever you want about stuff, its important to first archieve accuracy else you'll behave like a bitch or a kid.

Lol I feel you, had some crazy shakes my first few times. Guess you just get over it, don't know what else to say other than it's not that big a deal, at least you tried again and got some of that sweet tokkul. Could always pause somewhere close to Jad and just take a minute to breath.

Read the Wiki a bit and watch a YouTube guide on how to do the fight, most people don't even attempt it unless they have Ranged at 75+ and Prayer 43+ and that's just the bare minimum, a lot of people struggle even with much better stats.
---
Seeing a level 14 with a fire cape is like seeing Stuart little wearing the heavyweight title belt because he just KO'd the defending champ. It's extremely difficult and time consuming, requires an insane amount of dedication and perseverance.
---
I showed my gf osrs at the end of summer. I showed her the ropes. Where to train, how to make money, quests etc. Only a few months later she is now 92 combat, almost comoleted recipe for disaster and 16m bank. Back when I played in 2008. It took me 4 years to get 82 combat and 7M bank and dragon slayer being the hardest quest I completed.
---
Unfortunately it is target ads, but it'll be targeted at visitors of our subreddit and not necessarily always people who are buying gold. 
---
We've tried to contact reddit staff in the past to be able to block certain accounts from getting promoted space in our community, but I don't think anything came of it, best to just report these ads to the best of your ability.
---
I’m talking about this sub, also a single person is responsible for a good chunk of those capes. Don’t believe me? Check his vouches
---
It is strong, but it's twice as expensive to use and has significantly lower dps literally everywhere.
---
I’m not opposed to dark humor but fuck Micheal Vick.
---
This. Developers have no obligation to interact with the community, and if you need some more confirmation on this, look at 99% of games in existence. Companies hire people to handle interaction, the OSRS team as a whole generally interacting is something they can rightfully stop if the community makes that a consistently bad experience almost every time.
---
Can you play OSRS on an Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet?
---
I wanted to get something cheap to relax in bed and play with, but phones are a bit too small for me.

Sounds like you’re a little softy
---
I'm not an expert on xlogging but I imagine it's not a guarantee and he would have had to waste his brews anyway. Also the venom might have killed him if he wasn't blood baragging and using redemption.
---
So for example using OSBuddy mouse keys to drop is bannable?
---
Probably half of them, this sub is completely clueless when it comes to the inferno market.  It’s probably for the better tbh or people wouldn’t ever shut up.
---
Naw I just dogs man. The dude drowned and electrocuted over 200 dogs to death. Eat my ass douchebag
---
All the discord messages, his close friends being involved, etc. 
---
At the very least he told them *how* to do the dupe.
---
yes- detectable maybe not. but shift click to drop basically made it irrelevant
---
It would really just screw any single pkers like the guy in the video since a clan or even just a small group could rag his main.
---
arcane would rise to 220m similar to dhcbow buff, could be more, even at 260m corp wouldn't be too  profitable gp/h wise
---
depending on how many alts you run rune dragons is a easy place, and you can pay for rev cave protection which equals out to about 9m-11m a hour.

You know what? I’m just gonna say it

Cool project, man. I didn't know I wanted a case opening simulator for OSRS

Power move.  Dude probably did most of it at work then celebrates it at work with a cake displaying how much Runescape he played at work.

Any suggestions on where to find RSPSs?

You can deiron lol
---
Lets say tome comes from other update then yes arcanes better be upgradable
---
Lets wait a week and see ;)
---
The overall recorded sample size is probably very small, so it’s probably only every happened a handful of times and hasn’t been recorded.
---
That being said now everyone knows it’s possible thanks to you!
---
Yes it does

The whole point of ironman is getting irrelevant with this updates

Selling is perm, buying you get a slap on the wrist

thats broken af, zammy flames lower up to 5 lvls. capped to -5lvl debuff total not per hit

I would love this to put cats in this as it will be a long time until I get a group of  other pets.
---
Yeah, same. The required amount of upvotes for customer support has gone down from 5k to 2k.
---
What's the actual possible lowest level after accounting for xp gained?
---
You need to realize people hate jagex because its stems  from their constant bullshit that dates all the way back from 2007 when they took at free trade , wilderness and to top the cake off EOC after everyone had told them no and now we have osrs which they plan on fucking up, because you have people who have not even been working for the company for a year have the ability to make big changes to the game. The main issue in general is the higher ups who's business model  is to hire people for a introduction job level at a low pay rate for osrs and then fire them a year or two later so they can never advance in the company and this never having to pay them a decent living wage.
---
Dam bruh
---
10hp pure obviously
---
This also gives the freedom to Jagex to throw out and test ideas instead of only being able to poll final products.
---
Same issue with Warding, too many people shot it down for not being a complete product, although it's absurd to ask Jagex to put in that many hours into a skill that can be scrapped in one poll.
---
Me!! I hoped they would, but im surprised they actuaøly had the balls to do it
---
Absolutely. That guy.
---
So osrs.
---
There are two types of OSRS communities, one is all of the players who either use discord and barely chat in game and the other is just a bunch of depressed and sad players who take their anger out on the mods or any player in game because they arent in a positive place in their lives and they feel better when they put others down. 
---
However it is a bit naive of them to make this post when ModHusky is one of those people who is so easily disliked and sets himself and Jagex up for this shit on social media. 
---
Mod Ash is a saint though, I could never get mad at him.
---
Yeah with thick Scottish or Nordic hair not blonde bleached ratty dreads
---
Lived in Florida for a long time (born there) and the majority of white folk with dreads don’t rock em imo
---
why wouldnt u use bp as dps at bandos, its strictly better than anything melee
---
at least he has 10 gp left to get out of al kharid
---
Excuzez-moi fool
---
i paid somebody 3m to get mine for me
---
And that's why even weaker armor sets have uses over barrows even if barrows is strictly better. Just decided to swap from dharocks to obsidian armor for NMZ due cost.
---
That last sentence is what happened when I pulled out of your moms ass
---
Just do it and find it out... :)
---
Delete your account &amp; start over...
---
You'd probably burn yourself out and quit osrs before you get 99. My guess only,  no personal experience.
---
You should probably put aside some of that time and buy ur friend a beer. :)
---
He’s getting really strong 😳
---
Pretty sure it's a joke you greater demon brained fuck
---
If for whatever reason you're doing any wyvern tasks, its worth using while meleeing since its the only item in the game that prevents you getting frozen from the icy wyvern breath.
---
The fact that you can teleport directly to corp is strange to me.. compared to bosses like dagganoth kings and kq where you have to run a gauntlet to get to them. Also the fact that its on the games necklace is also weird, since all the other teleports there are teleports to minigames.. is that how corp fits into the runescape lore? its just a game that the citizens of gielinor go to kill time and relax?
---
I'd vote yes to wieldable knives hammers and spades
---
Runecrafting only UIM
---
A cool raid idea is for everyone in a group to have a large limitation of their choosing, with the idea of organizing your team's weaknesses to cover each other. A few examples of these limitations could include the inability to attack, 50% less healing from food and potions, not being able to use prayer, having 25% of your damage dealt reflected to you, etc. This forces players to strategize differently and hold serious consideration for defense stats, damage reduction and healing.
---
Because it devalues my barrock general store hammer
---
Such a good call on Jagexs' part.
---
Check out youtube channel "25 buttholes". A OSRS vidmaker who basically talks via google reader and has notorious phrases like "slap with the quickness" or "wow". Saying it like a robot only adds to the fun.

---
He's been at Fox sports for like 4 years
---
I think he was making a joke
---
This is false information.
---
This is literally the exact thing I commented on a previous thread and I got downvoted for it heavily. The reason why they didn't reply with any info on the server issues during that span of days was largely due to this - if they replied without anything concrete or just an "update" then the amount of flame they'd have gotten for it is a bit ridiculous. 
---
I get it that there is a lot of rightful criticism to go around, especially for the lack of a "support" team. However if you guys took a second to think about the position they're probably in I'm sure it would change some of your minds'. The biggest thing is that as far as support goes, I am POSITIVE the jmod crew for osrs wants to hire more, and do more etc. There's always more going on behind closed doors is what I'm saying, and the constant bigotry and backlash isn't going to make them come out and speak MORE to us about it.

It would be nice if it was changed. So that it's not just if an attack will hit or not. But that it make could potentially lessen the amount of dmg recieved by a small amount.  
---
That way it doesn't become too OP or changed it too much. could be something like 100 armour of a certain type would take 5% of the dmg recieved. (just and exsample)

esports/competitive department @ jagex ya
---
You can technically tick eat melee but it involves stackable stalls. Rendi uses it fairly often for his lower the better series. The barrows one specifically heavily uses it.
---
Why would you give it back? Lol
---
The suggestion wouldn't really make them meta. You get a boost to your smithing level and that's that. There's not a lot of need for the boosted level. It'd be the niche. Maybe an ironman gets his dragonfire shield a bit earlier, though they probably spend the money instead. It's not giving an exp boost so who is going to the wildy to use it. So people are at most going to use it for the one time boost to get their DFS or something like that. Which they're going to be able to do absolutely risk free.
---
That's sort of why I like this update. It doesn't really do anything to force you into the wildy, just add some very niche content which is cool that it's there.
---
Idk but I like he idea of a 2H WC ACS coming I to the game. Maybe if it’s even with the same stats, just for the new animation
---
That's the trick - you'll keep citing this conspiracy theory no matter how accurate or inaccurate it is, so when you say this we're better off ignoring you.
---
No he will not
---
This also happened to me at zulrah with a magic fang.  Why that priestess can get my gear and not my loot is beyond me.  Magic fang in the collection log, fuck all in my loot tab.
---
another issue i notice is this.
---
Depending on the monster, either their accuracy is so low that defense bonus doesn't matter so you go for DPS, or their accuracy is so high that tank gear isn't even work well enough.
---
Look at Kril for instance, a 340 attack level with +120 attack bonus means every hit will probably have over 70% chance of hitting even through justiciar + bulwark.
---
Or look at Inferno, the rangers/blobs/meleers are so accurate that it will probably hit 50% of the time minimum.
---
In tweaking out AaaaH
---
Since you are basicly to be able to carry everything in your hands irl, why not make the barrel of naphtha equippable as well? I mean... your character can carry the gold helmet on his head alone, which weighs 31.7 kilograms which is only 300 grams less than the barrel. And about the two handed axe thingy: if you would be able to equip a hammer, it would be nice, to make it two handed. I mean youre smithing cold metal bars. They are hard as shit, so you would need a lot of force to form them. Now as I'm thinking of it... you should get some strength xp from that as well. /s
---
that's too bad, i prefer tanking and afk as that gives value to high level defensive gear. players who want mechanics that require moving away should play EoC.
---
Aaty has the sweet stack

No it is 82 are u stupid?
---
I’m pretty sure they polled having a g/e option in every bank window but everyone was against it at the time.

True, but you can also tell by the 45 in wave 3, so you don’t have to go through the entire fight cave to know where your jad is gonna spawn.

In places such as Sarachnis and Kril when meleeing, why is karils recommended over Armadyl grear? Is the +13 bonus to attack just better than the defence and +2 prayer bonus?

Is there any reason the Hellhounds have such a poor drop table? I mean, for hard clues they're okay, but that's it. I get that not every slayer monster can be super profitable, but I feel like Hellhounds are especially bad.

How are you getting 550k/h, and how are you doing 200k + 70k crafting with 300k profit?

no goblin boys allowed past the lvl 50 wildy line

Did you get 6 hour logged or dced? You may have not logged out actually. Thats the only way. Or you were poisoned or something and died the same game tick as clicking logout.

How is it unhealthy? Genuine question

There is a site where you can practice jad. I also used private rs clients to practice. if you prayer switch correctly you will never die. Keep your attention at the switching, learn the rythm. Don't get destracted by the healers.

Keep the reward in your mind, you'll want to CRUSH Jad

No there isn't lmao

wtf bro not cool
---
I love you too, Dad &lt;3

I would.
---
This comment needs to be higher. How toxic and disgusting some players can be whenever they’re not happy about something is eventually going to shut down communication with the mods.

Get runelite. The original client is complete trash

You could do Cerberus instead of them but yes on their own they are pretty meh.

Didn't Viper make a OSRS track not too long ago?

Yeah.. we aren’t forced by jagex to go in it with diaries and clues for example. Thats is not PVP but PVRunningPlayerWithASpade

Rex, raids 1 and 2, thermo barrage method, scorpia, sire blood barrage on minions no food method, il count inferno, you can mage bandos, sang kq, maging minions at Zammy, Arma, kraken, woody mage cape bosses, and heavily used in PvP.

He does a series on YouTube for Tedious Collection Log spreadsheet so he probably had a task to get a unique or something from there so he was doing it to complete the task
---
I absolutely love this idea. Saving the staffs for Raids 3 is something I'm a big fan of and I love the idea of revitalising Corp with new additions to the current spirit shields.
---
My idea would be making the shield's lose defensive stats in return for extra damage.
---
Cant you just use those keys to get in ?
---
Maybe try reading before next time I guess.
---
 I they polled MTX.
---
I don’t get it.. seems like membership but with extra steps
---
Beste osrs series out there, for sure.
---
I think You guys misunderstood the meme  you can vote through acct management tab rather than polling booth.... this is nothing to do with tome
---
Barrows
---
the idea is that you can buy this extra to the membership but you get access to new content sooner than it will be released. Its what happened to rs3 the next step to microtransactions in the game
---
Do you actually talk to any high level pvmers? Everyone I know was against the tome. Obviously our echo chamber friendship groups aren't representative of everyone.
---
99 slayer will be a hell of an episode
---
No you are buying a service/ability to play the game. Just like Netflix Spotify Xbox live etc,
---
That doesn't mean you own anything of the game. And yes of course we can say something about costumer service etc while paying. But that aside
---
We got polls, a team that at least communicaties with its players. A lot of gaming companies wont do that. And even then,paying money still doesn't give you the right to act like that.
---
I understand people getting angry with soms updates, and that's perfectly normal. And with good arguments and explaining your side of the story you can actually make a difference  But you still should be reasonable, since you are not the only paying player in this game

I wanna see all the freshly spawned level 3s duking it out.

This subreddit has the sheepiest downvoting habits

Quitting means he will be back in roughly 16 days
---
Agree 100%. I would love to see weapons that are amazing based around their accuracy and reliability (minimum hits), or maybe some weapons that are specifically good for tank setups (maybe they get a damage/accuracy boost for each successive 0 that the opponent hits on you).
---
I think that some different ideas would be healthy for the game, rather than everything revolving around strength bonus. Currently everything is about devaluing current top tier items and the meta. Well instead of making things to beat the current top tier items within the meta, what if they make items designed to change the meta and make more setups viable?
---
Every MMORPG is overwhelming at first because you have so much to figure out.
---
Indeed. If the Guthan's was damaged, it should have been kept on death unless there was another death storage mechanic.

I know that, I want to hear him say it.

To put into perspective, the **Dark Crystal Bow** is equivalent to a Shortbow speed crystal bow. 
---
On Rapid it fires at 6 speed but since it's 2 arrows per shot that makes it 3.
---
The idea is to address how under-powered the current crystal bow is as well as provide a item sink for the Dark Bow.
---
Lore: Dark Beasts are created by Seren (dark lord) and this is a weapon fashioned behind that theme.

Sure thing, Tom Brady.

Next time, I'd recommend the Windows feature, "Snipping tool".
---
There’s no way to know unless it were in game. In which case as I just said they could adjust it and nerf it accordingly. The fact is that the poll was asking if the item should be added, and it passed.
---
Interact with others in the game, they have a really good idea of what they want and their end goal. 
---
Do you want be dominate other in combat or show that you are skilled at the mechanics of the game via killing bosses, or be a social lord, or show how good you are at merching and making money, legit or scamming others. 
---
The main part of it is that you have the freedom to do a whole lot and the game feels a bit like a blank canvas that you can imprint your own personality onto, though your account.
---
Yup, runelite would still be superior but official client wouldn't be as bad as it is now.
---
Depends.

It's a meme.

The gauntlet has zero risk or requirement any rare drop from it would crash to worthless anyway.  Not everything new needs to drop BiS gear.

If you had been using your Guthan's, it should have been damaged, and therefore untradeable. And you should keep all untradeables on death in the slayer cave. Very strange indeed...

There are updates and then there's pandering to the elitists that play the game like it's RS3. This is pandering to them. RS3 is all about Tier level weapons and Armor and OSRS really is not there yet but it is slowly getting There! There is no reason to make these shields even more powerful... None. The game is quickly out pacing it's newbies by allowing extremely OP things like this to be easily obtainable.
---
This guy fucks!
---
Shit i scratched my car.
---
The rivet in my pants, there are cool pants too. Fuck it.

Why on earth would i do that?

I said I'm looking for friendly players, fool.. Not hacks. Lol
---
I didn't really like the ending honestly. Felt really rushed.. really bummed it's over though. One of my all time favorite shows.
---
It’s the circle of life.
---
Yes it does. The wiki says pretty clearly that the box can roll off the Rare Drop Table and everyone knows the shield left half is from there. Read better.
---
all this would do is remove some rng
---
I only started playing OSRS a week ago but im using an account thats super old and has been hacked to oblivion which means it has a "bot" name. I hope the majority of people aren't like you and report people for having "bot" names.
---
Certified hood classiv
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks, I didn't know this as I didn't play RS at the time corp came out. :)
---
Hey man, you're just a big bully.
---
My first thought also
---
The only more elaborate quests that it matters for are when there's puzzles that are unique to each account. So if there's a spell that incantation is yours. Or a puzzle thats path is different for each player
---
Um wouldn't this make them even cheaper if you can craft more
---
Bis gear requires most quests. Ferocious assembler, also inferno cant be bought from ge

Is mobile fucked again? OSRS website won’t load on my phone, tried Chrome and Safari, and the app is giving me that connection error message

I got somewhat lucky (but at the same time did not).

Hopped to avoid a broodoo victim. Next world had a guy doing cleanup, and I see he had found a strange plant (gout tuber) but had not harvested it. I immediately asked him to dig it up with a spade (that I gave him) and offered to buy it for 1m, which he did. He didn't know what they were and when he did dig it up and saw the ge valued em at \~900k, he was floored.
---
I clinched my ass cheeks so bad I can’t unclinch!

Or 1m to have him be your canoe making slave indefinitely?

Swap the red and green. Ely should turn green, and Arcane should turn red.
---
Kemp would have to get good at something other than RWT'ing first to accomplish this
---
Because that is fucking boring, is the short answer. The game should reward you for playing well and punish you for playing badly, not just punish you cuz why not.
---
This makes too much sense
---
Wth 😥
---
Well Im sure woox is going to solo it after a week, but its definitely going to have more mechanics than corp
---
My bwanna
---
For real, it has 60m, 130m, and 800m drops with decent standard loot.
---
Not every boss is going to be or needs to be consistent 6m/hr
---
My GE sweeper noticed an unusual large influx of poisoned iron ranged weaponry recently, might definately be involved.
---
mmhmm
---
Plus even if it didn’t who wants to lose out on one of the best items in the game even if he already has one
---
Does the number of charges affect the rate?  Or is it just anything above (0)?
---
Noice, i also wanna do nightshifts cuz sleep schedule is fked but there's nothing closeby.
---
No...the opposite. Players who want tanking to be a thing should go play eoc, where tanking is a thing via abilities. Movement and prayer are the fundamental mechanics of osrs combat.  You've got it backwards because you're just seeing what you want to see.
---
Thats not bad though i have a buddy with QPC hes just bad a tears caps at 165
---
same i dont get the joke
---
This is why I'm an ironman. You're a loser.
---
RIP MTA gp/hr.
---
Yeah this whole last season was kinda meh (especially when compared to previous seasons). The whole Guart (Quwart?) Jared story was just not that funny.
---
&gt; if these are more common than Corp Sigils you're just going to have another Pegasian Crystal
---
In the case of Pegasian boots it kind of made sense. It was a failed idea to begin with the way it was implemented, but the problem was relying on a rare Clue Scroll reward.
---
If the crystal was rarer we'd have 50-75m Pegasian boots, and that just seems a little out of line to me considering the upgrade from Ranger boots isn't really worth the price of another pair of Ranger boots.
---
If you ever find yourself wondering something like "The fuck is a grimy toadflax?" then [the official Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/) is your friend.
---
100 hours of gameplay?? do they just do it a round at a time?
---
Just shut down the computer for a couple of hours. Such little exp waste for such large life gain lol
---
If you have to be tick perfect for 100 hours, it’s not humanly possible
---
Lol are you legitimately saying PVP has priority over PVM. Gtfo here. PvP updates aren’t forced either, they’re voted on. Unless you’re talking about bulwark and g maul nerf? 
---
Regardless, PVP content gets downvoted to shit by everyone and their mother and this community has admitted to hating PvP. So it’s not surprising they have decided to only allow PKers to vote. Sorry if you’re a spiteful pvmer. 
---
Secondly, pvm updates get blindly voted into the game with no care for anything. Look at all content polls for new PVM stuff. It’s all 80 percent and higher. The only time things fail is when they’re extremely broken. People press Yes for new stuff and who cares what happens. So Jagex simply wanted to avoid putting a broken item into the game, since it was the subject of much debate.
---
All amulets are more overpowered than armor. Take anguish and torture, compare it to arma and bandos.
---
So that’s what it is. Shit was driving me insane.
---
don't forget the lowered mage accuracy nightmare staff gives and the need of having tome of fire to make it viable. DPS increase on nightmare staff is around 11-12%, you lose the ability to use ancients(so useless in tob), venges(useless in tob and compared to zulrah if you account for venge procing), in cox sang staff hits 48's while new staff hits 49(not a massive diff considering you lose the heals). Compare that to scythe vs whip lets say where diff is 20-25%.  
---
What they ment to make with this staff is powercreep mage weapon for pvm. Which imo it's not close to being powercreep.
---
Woof
---
Dude I was just asking if there was a better teak tree place. If the answer is no that's fine. I'm not looking for pitty.

Ya and it's already climbing back up rapidly. It will be 140m at the end of thia weekend since pvmers are buying theirs back.
---
Nightmare of Ashihama
---
I don't pity you but I was just saying that stuff like that kinda just leads itself it the game mode you chose. Fossil island with the agility shortcut is best for banking Teak's.
---
Yo don't put wood in your stomach dude that's no good
---
I’m hoping now that the show is ending, mike judge will revive king of the hill like he teased a couple of years ago

🦀🦀🦀Jamflex won’t respond🦀🦀🦀
---
I assumed all the cheat client PVPers (who already have this feature right now) voted against it en masse to keep an unfair advantage since Jagex banned the plugin on the two big clients.
---
I think it's significantly easier to do blood runes for 400 hours than doing lavas for 200 hours for example.
---
I voted yes because the Arcane is shit. It's only BIS due to lack of other options. It's the least stinky option from a pile of turds.
---
Imagine reading fantasy and thinking the LOTR books are bad
---
This isn’t too prevent griefing,this is to prevent mistakes such as when people leave auto retaliate on it when an NPC spawns and both players click immediately.
---
You have to start somewhere.
---
Mining is the only thing that affects it, but really i was getting probably about 2m/hr depending on MVP and rune ore/bar drops
---
Good old quiting boss, got you for a little bit
---
Or just the print screen button on your keyboard
---
Many people don’t know this but there is a strategy to getting high tears numbers. 
---
1. Find a world with a good rotation. This means watch the wells. You want a world where all 3 of the blue wells move sequentially. Takes some hopping and resets on Thursdays with game updates so you have to find a new world every week. 
---
2. Always go for the blue well that rotated first. The gives you the best opportunity to get one of the other two wells to go where the first one was so be patient and dont move as soon as your wells timer is up. You can get lucky and get at most 3 wells without moving your character. 
---
3. If not use runelite or osb as having the timers on the wells is super helpful. 
---
4. Just pay attention. Watch the rotation and hope that RNGesus is on your side. 
---
I usually get 195-210 with qpc. But i have seen 220+.

Don't you think it takes more dedication to do lavas to 99 even though it takes a shorter amount of time?
---

---
If youre ranging youre probably going with a team, diamond e work well but if you can a blowpipe works very well if your team hits a spec or 2.
---
Very little uses? wdym, ely arcane and even spectral are BIS items for their respective fields..
---
Dude.
---
People bot and buy runners with rwt money 
---
Zeah is the most balanced update in the game basically and everyone likes it
---
&gt;The problem with Runecrafting is that nobody wants to spend so much time having little fun with their butt on the computer, i wouldn't mind a method of training RC that gave more experience the better you got at it.
---
so lava rc?
---
Well, every gp made was lost by someone else. 
---
I didn't get in this shit for the precise reason that I would end up just losing hundreds of mills because by the time I learn about it the people with really big go have already made what's there to be made and I'll end up buying the dump.
---
This was also an extremely volatile situation where you could be doing everything right but your timezone could fuck you based on when jagex announced changes.
---
This was not on the event calendar
---
https://youtu.be/_ilhYJ-aOMQ
---
I'm duo with my friend so yea ranging. But the diamond dragon bolts e have the fire breath effect, would the fire hurt bandos for a higher max hit or no?
---
First it's one hell of a stretch to apply chekovs gun to a game like this without any storyline.
---
Second something has been done with it, its nex's prison, which in lore isn't due to be opened in this stage of history. 
---
Third, osrs is about to get its equivalent of nex, why revisit/remake old content instead of something fresh? They shouldn't put anything different there because it just trashes established lore.
---
All you had to do was count to 7. Walk/cast a spell. Count to 7 repeat. Gratz on such an easy task I guess
---
Can't do that if you're using blood barrage on the minions though.
---
Kraken
---
It actually has most of the best tunes as well. As good as Sea Shanty 2 is, I'd have Barbarianism on loop. That's a track that slaps.
---
I have QPC and average around 175. My highest was 183 i believe.
---
No, with lavas you can reach upto 200k (240k) with 4 runners at 8-10m/hour, whereas bloods are 38.5k and souls 47k.
---
I mean if you can afford the hefty cost of lavas then you save alot of time. However, the majority of those with 99 rc trained at either ZMI or Zeah and the cape symbolizes 300+ of soul grinding hours on a single skill.
---

---
Not everyone is an incel that survives on neetbucks lol.
---
No. In sub-max mage set ups the new staff is a max hit or two ahead of the Trident of the Swamp. Eventually the Trident outpaces it in maxed gear because it has a higher base damage. It's also a ton of switches for TOB so it's probably only going to be used at CoX and maybe Zulrah. 
---
It's not really comparable to the Tbow, Blowpipe, or Scythe as far as DPS upgrades, but it is kind of comparable to the Rapier of the tent whip. The problem is that the new staff will have higher operational costs than the trident.
---
Lol avid fantasy readers definitely dont consider LOTR to be shit.
---

You’re really struggling with this one aren’t ya?

Filling jugs with water. On PVP worlds there's a bank chest at the spawn point in Lumbridge. Filling vials with water used to be a big moneymaking method for f2p noobs way back in the day, but OSRS solved it by adding 100-packs of water filled vials to shops.
---
 Jugs of water are used for making wine, for cooking training. Since empty jugs can be bought in packs from stores, but filled jugs cannot, there's about a 30 gp profit per jug filled.
---
Sounds legit to me,
---
I understand why, I do. However this means you should pay more attention to your ideas Jagex before releasing them for polls. Now there is no point to polls if you're going to make the decision anyway. Dont tell people they have power to vote if you're going to ignore it at the end because you guys are trying to save content. Most of the stuff released these days turns into dead content anyway.
---
Fossil Island has patches you can grow teak, if you have the shortcut through the hill its pretty close to the bank
---
lesser items like combat bracelet are obby cape are fine when you're building up, but if you have a bandos tasset and chestplate and still haven't earned the free BIS stuff, then you probably didn't earn that 50mil the hard way.
---
Wtf b2b?
---
Dentist
---
Apparently yeah, I’m missing something that everyone else knows. Could you explain please because I’m really in the dark here.
---
Oh man, I remember those days. I used to fill vials for money back in like 2007.
---
Blowpipe didn't make any existing content irrelevant as there wasn't any 75 ranged weapon
---
Getting to 86 with regular RC was not doable for me. I got so so burnt out on the Abyss by level 75.
---
Bibs da man
---
Yeah, it's 10% so around 500K
---
On the other hand, because of the steady stream of Pegs, Ranger Boots have retained their value for a really long time. If Ashihama is worthwhile without the Arcane upgrade, it would basically keep both Corp and Ashihama profitable (in fact, potentially making Corp more profitable). 
---
But people don't tend to do Corp regardless because it's an outrageous grind for relatively useless items on an ironman and it requires a group to do in a non-cancer way on a main, at which point you should be at CoX.
---
If you're going the crossbow route you want to use ruby dragon bolts until he's at 33% hp then switch to diamond dragons.  The ruby's do %health damage
---
Nah lol just give a new group boss bis armour, melee weapon and mage weapon.
---
Btw guys we can't make any bosses we have said we want to cos we have no rewards that fit.
---
I wish they would do something similar with the Rooftops too, sometimes I get really lost on mobile lol.
---
Sorry the nightmare doesn't make sense from corp? It literally comes from a spirit realm and enters gielinor... If that's not nightmare related wtf is?
---
It meme frient
---
This man said that Corp doesn't need to be consistent 6m/hr, not that it is.
---
well that would be a flex for sure
---
 Between 1-10000000000 Id wager, probably around 700m first week though
---
I think you need to be autistic to understand this joke. I think the main point is that when a noob (like these commenters) see someone in game with better gear than them that they had to use “their mom’s cc” to buy bonds/gold excuse to fee better lol.
---
Test it, id expect you keep it
---
You might literally be the first person to go into the wildy with tokkul on purpose

Sure, but then you have to paste it into an image manipulation program (read: MS paint) and crop it. Snipping tool lets you select an area of the screen to grab.

To each their own. I work on a PC all day so its not relaxing to play on a PC after work. Mobile is a lot better than most people give it credit for, but using a worse phone or tablet makes it feel pretty bad. I’m on an iphone 11 and it runs better than my PC
---
Buffing a top tier item to be its replacement is better than making a new item thats just better and ruins the old. And the buffs could be really small.
---
Like if new arcane is just a arcane with 2% damage boost, arcane will hold its value. If new book is a better arcane thats 30m arcane is dead content.
---
&gt; On the other hand if you do that quest just for the quest points it sure is tedious, but if there is a new quest that doesn't give too much of a reward then you won't lose anything if you don't do it.
---
Well you'd lose quest cape teleport
---
That's where I do my prayer training.  I like it because it's not the bore of just burying bones, nor the monotony of Ectofuntus, nor the hassle of shades.  It's just a nice boost that gets your heart pumping a little as you do it.  To me, that's an exciting and interesting addition to the game.
---
Would make PvP a nightmare not knowing what's about to happen
---
You'll eventually find vorkath so easy you'll start looking away from the screen and he'll always fireball at that exact moment.
---
That's very descriptive, I commend you for that

 well said.

They're both gambling and likely driven by greed. Not all that different imo

Really Jagex and not twitch? Twitch is doing this to creators who make a living off streaming. (Granted im assuming you use twitch)
---
Yw
---
I mean... that's basically everything voted on by a public community ever. There's no requirement for being informed on the decision you're making. If you're going to invalidate the results by saying people are morons (not disagreeing with you there) and can't make an informed decision, why even bother to hold a poll at all? Just make game decisions based on focus group discussion.
---
A lot more people need to understand this.
---
considering the requirements for it i think thats pretty neat
---
Because doing lavas for 400 hours is super fun and impressive, people stood up and clapped when I did it! /s
---
If you don't like it don't do it, dude, but I'm not gonna spend 3 digits of hours suffering through a skill instead of having fun and/or relaxing with it
---
I'd say it is a bit late for this. The staff already passed so scrapping it and offering an entirely different reward in its place would be very questionable; especially when there isn't anything that wrong with the staff and you're just suggesting to add it somewhere else later. It is pretty clear from the other rewards that the Nightmare is intended to be on par with a Raid, so there no reason to hold off on the staff for Raids 3 and we could just as well save a Spirit Shield upgrade for a Raids 3 instead.
---
Nah at the end of the day those that achieved it in a way of more of a grind have a higher satisfaction this also provides Ironman with a nice supply of blood runes: even when Jagex said updates will not be caterd towards ironmans it’s inevitable that the updates actually will in some way. And the xp rates are lower then methods like lava runes so it’s a fair trade off shall a main regular player decide to camp these to 99
---
Idk I just can’t get over how it takes 10x longer to do anything in mobile compared to an mouse.

Then quit by removing your time investment. Do not regret or feel bad about it

This happened to me too, my friend has been really jealous of my luck

Are your margins so big that you can afford those 500k and still turn a profit?

I don't think anyone here has mentioned it yet but make sure to use the runelite client from runelite.net. it has tons of incredibly useful features - like to answer your weapon question, just hover over the item in you inventory with runelite and it will show you the weapons stats. Have fun!

No offense but people don't watch him because he's nice, they watch him because he (well, maybe not anymore, but used to) has/had good content.

Know your pain I’ve recently acquired an extra day off due to losing a few hours. Silver lining. Before that 5 years of BS 6 day weeks.
---
Eh, I dunno. In my experience it's more fun for me if all parties involved are into it. If someone feels pressured into it, or have been paid to do it, their lack of enthusiasm will rub off on you. They'll just sit there, looking around for a distraction till you finish. It can also get physically exhausting if you're the only one putting in work. And don't even get me started on how long it takes to get off if they don't really want to help!

Thank you for those tips. I will try that today. Actually that is how i defeated him during the quest. Im going to have my salve ammy today so ill have to give that a go. Thanks again for that tip because i was already thinking it seemed easier when i used that setup. I know the quest version of vorkath is easier tho but that might be my solution to all the damage im taking

For masters, can we see if we roll/get the pet? It's technically not a "drop", or "reward" but you know what I mean.
---
Did you use range?
---
How long does one rotation take?
---
no armor. holy fuck.
---

One click of the lumbridge button on my AGS and you’ll quickly find yourself on a one-way flight to the land of gold sellers, beggars, and clowns. Watching Home Improvement reruns on your in-flight entertainment system.
---
Wow
---
Are we supposed to clap or call for help?  
---
Fellow human, you spent almost a THIRD of your whole year on this game.  
---
Of the 8765 or so hours available, you've put 2705 into runescape, with a self reported \~1000 hours (40 days) played while riding the train. Safe to call it an addiction?
---
Just did like a few hundred masters, landed on the gilded table like 8 times and ultra rare table once.., 6 gilded items, x15 potions x1, 3x cabbages x1, and x1 3a robe top. Rng is correct.
---
WOW REALLY?
---
I mean tedious in the sense that it IS a group boss. So you have to get an actual group. And if it IS soloable, it'll most likely end up as annoying or more annoying than corp in its own way as a result. Though whether or not it can be soloed is unknown. Someone like Woox will probably try once the instances die down. Players tend to find creative ways to solo all bosses.
---
Now we need a clue counter, how many clues you clicked.
---
And then somehow get a price point for all the items too! So we can see a total amount for each clue
---
Hey it would also be good if it’s mobile friendly :(
---
hahahah this is the best episode of the season so far
---
Check your local Craigslist or Facebook marketplace for old optiplex computers I usually see them for 50-80$ they usually have a quad core and 8 gigs and could easily run osrs
---
Not even good enough for Rutgers...Yikes
---
Nice.
---
Thats why Jagex added water filled vial packs to herb shops. Really this just shows that there needs to be jug of water packs as well.
---
It’s also on in the menagerie :)
---
Just amazing.
---
"I don't do this boss so nobody does"
---
fuck off
---
and no 30+ minutes of overediting &amp; forced memes required, while at it
---
Beg for what? And much obliged! Best answer yet.
---
So many people don’t understand the difference between impeachment and removal lol
---
I miss being able to grab a group of friends, running into a room and piling a boss. Everything is a 20 minute to an hour long raid or a solo/slayer boss nowadays. Corp is one of the best bosses in the game, just because you think its boring doesn't mean everyone else does.
---
Not worse than lumbridge?
---
"You nerds figure it out" LMAOOO
---
Another win for PikeySquad
---
And somehow I still can’t get a Firecape with a lvl 95 after 4 attempts.
---
I'm interested to see what it will be like when it returns. It is a shame it has been away for so long for those who did enjoy it, but at the same time a lot of players were getting sick to the repetitive formula and after complaining about rushed content all the time, it is ironic to complain when they don't rush a DMM rework. It would have been nice if they got a concept of the new DMM out before announcing and starting Leagues though to show that Leagues isn't replacing DMM.
---
Woox disagrees.
---
Yeah agility suuuuucks and I’m not even bothering with runecrafting. I wish they made agility 20x xp rate to make it tolerable
---
Lit season finale
---
have you thought that maybe they shouldn't be?
---
Obviously items that have more uses would be more money regardless of the drop rate. Arcane/Tome is not comparable to the staff, nor is Justiciar's very niche use. You're not going to be using Justiciar every where when you're meleeing like you'd be using Avernic in most situations. 
---
And all of this doesn't matter when the game advances in life-span and the death mechanics aren't punishing, people can max every boss because there's no risk, et cetera.
---
For those of you pushing for impeachment- you must not go outside your RS bubble a whole lot. Do you realize just what would happen?
---
Are you not paying attention to what's going on in the states right now? VA is telling it's political leaders to go fuck themselves. Those same leaders have threatened military action AGAINST the people. And people are RESPONDING.
---
Impeaching trump wouldn't solve any of that, but act as an accelerator. If you're NOT from the U.S., shits boiling, and that's okay, high time really.
---
But if you're wishing impeachment because you dont like trump- you're an idiot. If you wish impeachment due to the way he's handled the presidency- okay then, fair enough.
---
I'm almost positive the falling rocks in the motherload mine have party hats now too lol
---
Yeah and a lot of people don't listen when the information is right in front of them.
---
wow
---
It's twisted league so I guess its not insane luck.. But congrats
---
Wow never would have guessed
---
Aww dude you're the best. Will do.
---
Yeah, higher stakes made it more exciting.
---
First of all, I’m sorry but the staff looks stupid af.
---
Secondly, I like the Kodai Wand being Bis right now.  Granted you can buy the pieces but there’s something about having to work your way up in the mage training arena to get it as an Ironman that makes me love that weapon.
---
We also have the diary teleport letting us get right there. I dunno if this is needed, I think it should go somewhere else bc I like the idea of a hot air balloon in zeah but like the other guy said there’s like 4 teles near it.
---
What about Ape Atoll with that Arceuss Teleport? I recall that was pretty quick, but those trees tend to be popular.
---
if you get bloodhound, it'll show up as a regular item in the reward ,with the inventory icon image
---
i just put a new update which should hopefully make it better, how is it now?
---
I expect it will be soloable just like ToB can be soloed. Not sure how it will work for Ironmen though.
---
You're amazing man. The editing was very pleasant too, no hour long autobiographic documentary.
---
Ooh that’s cool. Also a simple add would be the # of clues opened next to each tier. But this is sooooo fun I’ve had two gilded pieces already. Will never see a 3a item in my life lmao

---
Not necessarily. At gorillas, assuming you do them properly, you should take very minimal hits off prayer (which fully negates damage) and their accuracy is already so high to where the defense bonuses don’t make much a difference (not nearly as much as your actual defense level). In terms of your accuracy, arclight already gets a 70% accuracy increase on demonics so the -slash accuracy is almost entirely moot. If you’re *not* using an arclight (out of charges), inquisitor + mace would be the next BIS.
---
just boost ur points imo
---
I don't think were talking about trees anymore
---
I got pet on second master, i wish this was the real game lul
---
Sure we'll just need about 10m to initiate the transfer.
---
What? It isn't irrelevant, can you explain why you think that?
---
As I've said it has a very specific use, which is providing a tiny convenience to Tree farm runs. Besides that it would just be a generally helpful teleportation method. Just because it doesn't cater to the min/max playstyle directly doesn't mean plenty of people wouldn't find use.
---
Also it's not like its a new feature that needs to be developed. It'd be low resource to implement, and has 0 negative repercussions.
---
Hot air balloon over the ocean, ur gna have a bad time
---
They did assume that not all rewards would pass, they said that they were surprised by it in the last Q&amp;A. If you actually read the blog post this is the reason they gave for why they cancelled it “The tome faced one main source of contention - its introduction to the game would devalue the existing best-in-slot item, the Arcane spirit shield”. This is what I disagree with. I said I was hoping that the real reason was that there were too many rewards. But if it devalues the arcane now, it would still devalue it in a later update. And I also don’t like setting the precedent of Jagex vetoing poll results, especially ones that pass handily since they have never vetoed a passed reward before. You should try to be better informed before commenting in the future.
---
Ah, I didn't know that was a thing, thanks!

Best pk bracket was between 2005-2010 in the Wilderness.

---
I just did about 50 elites worth &lt;150k. 100% correct.
---
I just challenged myself to get it on my 59 cb pure which isn’t that impressive but I did learn a few things:
---
One: use long rock instead of Italy... shits so much easier 
---
Two: take jad very slow, say the prayers out loud to not fuck up. When the healers come take them one attack at a time. Pray, click healer, focus jad, switch pray, click next healer, repeat. Once you have all four on you just walk in a straight line either left or right and you’ll have them line up so only one attacks you. Mains can deal with the damage, pures cannot. 
---
To heal during jad do the same thing as the healers, one pray click at a time
---
I experience it randomly. Sometimes it loads the app no problem though. Us
---
I pmed you my rsn
---
It’s pretty fucking crazy
---
yeah, I did the book favor way before client of kourend was released.
---
Are you running out of healing supplies before Jad?  If not, then defense isn't the issue so I wouldn't worry too much (though more couldn't hurt, of course).
---
I beat him handily with 75 Range and Defense, but that was with a Blowpipe which you said is a no-go.  80s with a Crystal Bow should do it.  Since you're Iron I can't just give you supplies, but if there's something I can do to help feel free to ask!
---
Sauce?

Im not too sure about the dragonfire effect on any of the gwd bosses. Although usually ruby (e) and diamond (e) work well enough, you can always try though.

I'm a dude and I have a hard time more than 7 inches.

Not really, I'd say a large portion of rsps players play osrs too. Even the biggest servers only have as many players as a mildly populated world (600-900 players these days). And that's the top 2 or 3. Beyond that the number drops hard and quick. All of this while having players that play osrs and multiple rspses at once.
---
They didn't ignore the input though. They received positive and negative input. They clearly listened to the negative input, thank God.
---
Right so youre trolling got it
---
I mean, don’t you have a hard time regardless? 😉
---
10% price to make bond tradeable
---
Ayyyy
---
Not sure what you mean? I'm explaining myself, I don't think that's a 'Flame war'. 
---
No one has provided anything close to a reasonable counterpoint except that they themselves wouldn't use it, and I assume most only wouldn't because they are already maxxed. Which is like, the tradition of this sub. Any suggestion that comes from someone who isn't already maxxed just gets shat on constantly. 
---
People keep saying its irrelevant even after I describe very specific situations it's useful in. I just don't get it? I'm sorry everyone can't play the game for themselves without strictly following max efficiency guides. 
---
This suggestion would be nice and harmless. I don't see why not?
---
this is not a plugin, and therefore is not bannable

As if he’s not making big bands off those videos

---
Lmao. You totally did.
---
Ugh oh what do you mean‽
---
Sorry, I don't understand  what you mean :/ What makes you think I'm trolling? I'm sorry I don't play the game the exact way to do. I'm honestly not trying to offend you or anything by not already having a maxxed account.

Rendi BTFO. How will he ever recover?

It wasn't that bad. You run into people and cooperate through pm

It's reasonable to say that unless he's really close to being 13 combat, that his rng across a whole cave will probably not vary enough to save a level.

not watching porn =/= not masturbating. I do that less often but I gave up watching porn for 3 reasons: 1. I used it as a way to procrastinate on things that stressed me rather than addressing those stressors directly. Still working on that one. 2. I don't like the industry and I think it's harms (to the women who are degraded in it, the women who are pushed into it, and the literal kids who base their whole understanding of sexual intimacy off of it) are clear. 3. It was a a habit of looking at women primarily of sexual objects in a way that started to undermine my everyday interactions. 
---
Beyond those three, I don't note any particularly improvements. The 'benefits' of not watching porn/nofap are mostly 'bro science'. There are good reasons to give up porn and masturbate less.
---
Tell us your suggestion to fix botting then. Go ahead. Realistically you can only address botting reactively. You would have a very difficult time eliminating all of the bots.
---
AWAKEN MY MASTERS!!!
---
On monsters that have 0 mage defense using augory doesn't increase DPS at all
---
“No one has provided anything close to a reasonable counterpoint” 
---
Yes we have what the fuck is wrong with you. Is telling you there’s 5 other teleports in this screenshot alone not reasonable enough? What about the fact that ALL 5 teleports are easier to access than the hot air balloon if you have them unlocked? You literally cannot wrap your head around any of the counterpoints, thats why you think that.
---
EvErYOn’es WRoNG But ME
---
Good ideas +1
---
Sorry buddy. The truth hurts
---
Honestly don't think he would risk anything just lock in the 14cb already amazing enough
---
Whats the name of the brush you use mate
---
It did pass though
---
Solutions exist, just not ones Jagex could implement
---
&gt;you're getting an item... another player will buy it from you
---
Okay, so the value goes to the person who bought the bond. It's worth 5m, the person who spent $7 ultimately gets 5m. Now that guy buys a blowpipe. What happens to the price of blowpipes?
---
Millennials invented the jump cut on YouTube. It feeds into basic human psychology. The average age of Runescape players is 20+ with the average account being 8 years old, according to Jagex. Little kids aren’t the ones you see playing Runescape.
---
A solution that Jagex can't implement is not a solution lol.
---
This was the obvious answer to anyone with more than 12 brain cells. Xzact didn't even try to break the record last time. Obviously he was going to smash it on a real attempt.
---
It's ok. I've been playing since 2001, have gotten 99 Farming twice, 96 Farming currently on this account. I only found out a few weeks ago that the Tool Leprechaun will note your harvests for you. I always just banked when my inventory filled up lmao.
---
Like I said in my longer comment I just did my fire cape on my 43 pray 75 range 59 cb pure and thought that was tough... till I saw this lmao. Teach me your ways
---
Yeah and bots will be a problem for as long as the game exists, welcome to osrs
---
I know. That's what I'm saying. So why not keep the people running the bots constantly working to create new money making methods...

I hope they would ban all 3rd party clients so cheaters like you don't get everything so easy
---
Originally, the prayer scrolls that unlocked the 3 new prayers from Chambers of Xeric were only one item that allowed a unlock choice for any of the 3 prayers.
---
Because Rigour was the most effective prayer, the prayer scroll's original price was extremely expensive tied to Rigour, meaning you would need to spend a fortune to unlock Preserve or Augury (basically spending enough to unlock rigour 3 times).
---
Regardless of how effective the spirit shields may be, if there's only one item for multiple upgrades, the price will likely be tied to the most useful of the items.
---
Are you just.. not reading my responses or something? I have said repeatedly that getting TO this spot is much less relevant than getting FROM this spot. Literally Taverly and Grand Tree are both useful spots for farming.
---
Also if you are standing by a balloon, then that balloon is going to be faster than going anywhere else. It's really not very complicated. 
---
&gt; Listen to everyone else in the comments. 
---
Literally no one has even begun to provide a decent reason as to why this shouldn't be a thing. It 100% has a use, I have stated that very plainly multiple times. Even if there are some limited faster options out there I don't see why providing a middle ground teleport is 'useless'? That just makes 0 sense.
---
The sound is after the visual animation and is a good way to get yourself killed. Mute the sound and practice watching the feet jump.
---
I was in the same position about a week ago. I finally found the right combination of gear for me. I use elite void, salve ei, pegs, anguish, archers ring (i), and blowpipe. I take shark+karam, 1 antifire, 1 super def pot, 1 anti venom, and 1 range pot. I’m only at 8kc so far but I am able to do 2 kills per trip and turn off prayer during special attacks to save prayer (seems like a small thing but I was excited about being able to do it).  I got vork head on first kc as well. Gl!
---
# HYAHYAHYAHYAHYAHAHAHAW0W

Not having 99 con could also just do scroll of redirect + house tab = taverly portal tele

It’s a lot easier with 70 defense and Barrows armor because you can tank thinks like the healers.

I think the golden thing is just your client maybe? If I'm guessing right, it just signifies which spots are closest to you so they only take 2 ticks to fish.
---
There's some delay on cutting the fish, you'll notice it if you click fast enough, but there's no delay on dropping.
---
How can I contact them if both of my accounts are bared from even logging in?
---
Say the prayer switches out loud
---
Well, it is alchable.
---
Walking around the GE getting mad people saying "DUDE WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?"
---
And slap as many adds in as possible for future episode funding.
---
He used to do it a lot. But i think now these accounts are specifically targeting him, not scouting an area. So when he teles they have no reason to stay.
---
That would also work, it's funny how library this big doesn't have multiple copies of books...
---
Its arguably twice as good as a gilded altar, and it negates the 70 con grind on ironmen. It gives you the same XP for half the bones, and it's not like anyone actually risks anything there. Being that much better then other methods should not be a thing, black chins is a good example of risk/reward, altar is a horrible one.
---
&gt; Yes we have what the fuck is wrong with you. 
---
Show me?
---
&gt; Is telling you there’s 5 other teleports in this screenshot alone not reasonable enough? 
---
Such a dumb point. If how many tps are in the screenshot is a problem then just pretend I posted a slightly zoomed in picture.
---
&gt; What about the fact that ALL 5 teleports are easier to access than the hot air balloon if you have them unlocked? 
---
Ok? And I assume out of those 5 four of them are easier to access than the 5th. So lets remove that 5th one then? Then out of those 4 three of them would then be easier to access, so lets cut off that 4th one as well. 
---
See how stupid that logic is?
---
Also "If you have them unlocked". This communities unflinching assumption that everyone in the game is maxxed is truly one of the most bizarre parts of this sub.
---
Also, again, none of that applies to the reason I suggested this. This is to get to Grand Tree or Taverly, no other methods do that currently.
---
&gt; EvErYOn’es WRoNG But ME

I mean obviously not everyone. Just most of you.

Yeah day one was an exaggeration but once the main RS community got here instead of just the small group it was before, it turned into a cesspool and hasn't really changed much since.

I remember anybody suggesting the tiniest QoL changes (like being able to search in your bank) getting screeched at and told to go back to EoC/RS3

This looks dope I want one

I’m assuming you downloaded the official OSRS client then. Hmm, put your account email into haveibeenpwned.com and change your passwords is my suggestion. Maybe try and reach out to mods on twitter?

The lack of info presented in bans is frustrating for sure :/

---
50/50
---
Yeah, you’re totally right. Somebody could probably do the math to calculate how much xp you would get by figuring out the total amount of damage you would need to deal (total sum of all enemy hit points) and figure out the final levels you’d have... But that’s not going to be me
---
I use to bring my damn herb sack lmao
---
Of course it's good it got patched, dude is either misinformed or being deliberately disingenuous. Rendi made it seem like he was the righteous hero in his video, going where nobody else would to save the OSRS economy when everyone else was too scared to act. 
---
Then almost immediately that entire narrative was proven to be bullshit and tons of people knew about it besides him. Furthermore, it was a calculated decision to not release the info (like he so irresponsibly did) to help make sure as few people knew about it as possible until a fix could be implemented. 
---
He tried to be the noble whistleblower and instead he just made everything worse while trying to appear that way.
---
I had insurance that covered the cost of my car. The new car was on me though. I got a pretty good job, so it really isn't a problem anyway.

No offense but why did you think this would be faster than training Con

---
It could suggest so, but not imply.
---
Doing it on my low level pure was one of the most satisfying achievements in my time playing RS.
---
wtf lmao
---
Very cool good luck with your future financial endeavors. You seem to be a promising young businessman.
---
Literally all you do is say shit like "wow you're 2200 total! How cool I've never seen that wow thanks for posting on Reddit for me to see!"
---
You're just a dick
---
You take sweets when you are pushing sub 17 so you can run the entire time through the levels and still have a full stam when you get there, and you can regen run energy between olm phases. It allows you to only use two slots for run regen (1 stam, 1 stack of sweets) and still be in a full sprint the whole time.
---
What's your problem?

Not saying I'm a God for memorizing patterns. It's just how the intended gameplay.

Came here to say this, I just got my 2nd jar out of 4 unsireds at exactly 400 kc

Alright, you're better versed on economics than the first guy. We can shift the discussion a bit, but let me say first that I 100% assure you these bonds cause inflation. 
---
Let's do a thought experiment. I assert that bonds cause inflation. You disagree. How would you feel if Jagex one day decided to issue every player in the game a free bond, but for some reason you got left out? What if it were 100 bonds?

People at sand crabs are PvPers that's why we vote no

It clearly exists, if it didn't exist, then how could I have that problem? A balloon there would be great for going to Grand Tree or Taverly for tree runs, as well as a way back from these locations. Particularly going from Grand Tree to here would be really useful.
---
This suggestion without a doubt would be helpful to just about anyone. It's not quite as effective as the Skil Necklace or Spirit Tree, and is a reasonable alternative to the Fairy Ring. Seems like the perfect middle ground suggestion here. 
---
Again, I'm far more considering this for leaving the guild rather than getting there. And like I keep saying unless this would be exploitable or make something else irrelevant I don't see the harm in suggesting it? I really don't see why this community gets so easily offended by suggestions like this. No it's not exciting new content or game changing in anyway, but it sure would be nice to have. There's far more players than just me who would find this useful.

what do you mean covered the cost of your car? Shouldn’t it be like this:
---
Total your car
---
Insurance sends you a check for your car minus the deductible
---
Buy car of similar value to your old one with that check, maybe a few thousand more.
---
Where does the huge finance come in? :O
---
That was a fun video, buddy. Gratz on your accomplishments and good luck in your future.
---
He also might have a torture as def bonus is nice for someone learning solos
---
I’d argue that being expected to remember patterns with that many variables is bad gameplay. 
---
You said it so nonchalantly as if it wasn’t unreasonable, but I think that you’d find yourself in the minority with that point of view.
---
Something something customer support blah blah
---
legend has it, that he is still at the varrock museum trying to get 75 hp
---
Wow thanks man :)! Glad you enjoyed!! &lt;333
---
Daggers give bonuses to your assassin stat
---
A Very Nice Achievement, Congratulations My Guy
---
He doesn't play as safely as he could, but he might now
---
you try dealing with a player base of 200k+ with a small development team. They’ve said they want to be better, and are striving to make the changes necessary.
---
It’ll catch up to you probably, good luck
---
Welcome to runescape where breaks from the game are punished....
---
Lol sad. Your argument must be very weak if you need to resort to name calling and to be desperate  enough to check peoples history LOL
---
The idea of separating votes by total level is like separating presidential votes by income.
---
"The main issue this election is tax law, and poor people dont have enough experience for it to matter, so they cant vote."
---
Yea, by spamming sorry under every comment, even those that were on his side. Passive aggressive prick
---
I haven't made a canoe since I did all the hard diaries.
---
Every combat level matters in pvp
---
You will most likely have better luck getting access to the old email account.
---
Should have a combat bracelet to be more genuine

Tf
---
how long did it take?
---
Boy I would totally use them if they added that.
---
Paid script?
---
if a highly sarcastic and snide remark is "stopping" someone from having fun then I don't know what to tell you
---
Dude if anything it's more impressive he got b2b pets at level 55 in the league cause that would be much lower in the normal game. The drop rate is still the same so why does the fact that it's not the normal game have anything to do with it
---
I think this will also give iron men a greater incentive to play bounty hunter as they can use loot from kills to buy bonds in addition to gathering points for the shop.
---
The video where he showed the community how to dupe stuff and presented himself as a savior soured his image for some people.
---
Also the Golden Gnomes reaction was uhh unflattering.
---
I tried. It’s with AOL. I didn’t know when I made it that those email accounts go inactive after 95 days without use. So when I try to log into it, it says it doesn’t exist on AOLs site. I tried to remake the account with the exact same email too, but it tells me “this email is not available for sign up, try something else.” I’m lost and I honestly feel like I’m never gonna get to play on that account again
---
They're saying [not stonks] = [stinks]
---
C
---
The construction grind literally took 20 mins to get the moulds lmao
---
Well for the first several kills, I completely forgot about being able to get it with construction, but at that point I was like fuck it I'll get it soon I'm sure. It got to a point where I would have saved more time doing construction, but I wanted to see just how dry I was going to be on it and kept killing them. The great barbarian slaughter. Meanwhile, my fiance got his on his 15th KC. Reeee
---
This would be the most irrational rush I ever got in my life
---
What?
---
Make a twitter and tweet at all the mods. Someone will likely respond
---
it's ingame stuff for real money so rwt. the difference is just buying bonds is allowed
---
I wish I knew how to code better, cause I would definitely help, but it's definitely not my background, and I have zero experience in this type of thing
---
Would it be a better weapon as well? Id love it if it was just a reskin
---
OSRS reddit defending Jagex? Must be the first time
---
He meant strength bonus, probably
---
Make a twitter and tweet at the mods. Its the only customer support that works
---
Needless to say, the Manningtons were distraught when Manny didn't respawn that night.
---
Based on the true story of the senseless slaughter I keep committing while AFK fishing
---
For those who may wish to peruse them, an archive of all the previous comics can be read [here.](https://imgur.com/a/C41ma) It contains a mix of both OSRS and RS3 comics, but most of them have been written in such a way to try and appeal to both communities
---
They both do have strength bonus too
---
Because I just don't? That makes 0 sense to me. That completely upturns dozens of TP options and is just a ridiculous suggestion.
---
Like I mentioned I wasn't suggesting this with the intent of making anything dramatically easier. I could use other TP methods to get to a tree patch even quicker but again, the Balloon would just be a nice option to have. I don't have any problem with access to any other patches around the world. 
---
Honestly the balloon is the ONLY tp suggestion I could imagine for that location. It's a decently limited mode of transportation so it's not going to break anything, or cause any other TP mode to become irrelevant. It has a niche use of helping you get to a Tree patch a little faster and then would just be a nice general option to have available.
---
Ok no worries, you keep on doing what your doing and report whenever you can. It people like you that clean up our community! Thank you for your service.
---
Can we get an F in the chat for all the innocent fallen men, women, and especially Gnome Stronghold gnome children
---
“Shield of Arab”
---
Yeah, for a while I forgot about the construction method too lmao but then I figured I'd get it soon enough, and didn't bother to go do construction. Got to a point I just wanted to see how dry I would be once I got one lol That feels bad though
---
I personally play currently because of twiated league. I find it really fun and not super tedious considering i dont have alot if time to play rs.
---
Ahh Mr.Entitled. Hello! 
---
Literally just posting, nothing more, nothing less my dude.
---
Keep doing you x
---
Yeah when it’s a massive achievement like this it deserves a bit of editing and showmanship
---
You are a tank
---
Okay ironman
---
The weak deserve to die so that the strong may flourish, this is the creed of Zamorak
---
Like?
---
You're putting the horse before the carriage. This method doesn't make other tp's irrelevant but rather other tp's make your suggestion already irrelevant, and in turn not worth implementing.
---
Fair enough. I apologize for seeming like I was just trying to get karma by stating it as unpopular. I just don't spend a huge amount of time on the subreddit.
---
Because game rules and real world rules are different.
---
If Jagex tried to stop bots they would not decrease their anti-bot team from 2 fulltime to 1 part-time earlier this year.
---
Uhh my buddy makes 10-20mil a day pking on a med..
---
Jagex actually owns your account (it's in the user agreement) so they are free to hold your account ransom
---
I have done this before when the service is interrupted by server issues that go beyond the acceptable duration. Jagex may not be happy, but as a business, they have to accept that profits will drop when they aren’t providing what is paid for, simple. Personally I see people like you as part of the problem, having for a company to do what they want and you just take it.
---
I couldn’t recommend any name brands unfortunately. I most of my glass from smoke shops. Most are no name.
---
I’m heartbroken and I’m sorry for all the misclicks, Manny. :(
---
Sorry about your account but could i get a small loan of 100m?
---
This is like one of those random thoughts you get while stoned off ur ass playing osrs lmfao
---
As an Ironman he can’t flip anything.
---
Not if you are a gold farmer.
---
There's already a TP methods from Farming Guild to Taverly, Grand Tree, Castle Wars, AND Entrana?! Wow that's amazing, IDK how I didn't know this. Yeah then my suggestion is completely irrelevant since all these things I've specifically been saying it would be used for must already exist!
---
Beast mode activated
---
Is way lower combat not theoretically possible?
---
With super lucky spawns, and rock cake + sweets to tick eat every single hit, and just skipping getting 40 prayer?
---
On a Ipad with the apple pencil and the amazing Procreate app!
---
Other People with the same question might not be an Ironman
---
&gt;Hypothetical, speculation, irrelevant. Requires (almost) no new graphics or programming.
---
You yourself stated that dev's are gonna have to retcon lines of new lines of dialogue into an existing, age-old quest line to explain how the balloon can magically travel this unrealistic distance. That's already effort on writers and dev's, all for a pointless update. That's in addition to having to edit an existing area and modify the assets already in place there.
---
&gt;Irrelevant?
---
Judhing by how many others in your post oppose your idea, it clearly isnt irrelevant. Plenty of players, myself included, would rather maintain the simplicity of an area over chocking it with an obstructive, unnecessary eyesore that brings nothing new to the game.
---
&gt;I already have my house elsewhere though? Why would I do that?? Again, not really a relevant suggestion in the slightest. Along with "Just use the spirit tree" and "Just build a jewelry box"
---
Guess what? Part of the game is deciding how you want to utilize your resources. Your house in tav will speed up those tree runs but it will make other parts of the game slower, no doubt. Making those choices and determining your own priorities has been part of the game since the beginning. Dont wanna move your house? Get a construction cape. No one said it was gonna be easy.
---
You don't need anything fancy to max it out draw distance + 50fps. I did it with an rx580. Honestly, anything brand new can do it probably.
---
What ur describing is very similar to the loot share system in rs3, that failed miserably. Basically, if more than 1 person killed a boss on a lootshare world, the item would be split into shard, and the shards are tradable, but it didnt work
---
You can poison on a zero. There are two different types of zeroes: miss and hit. A miss can’t poison, but if you land a hit and roll a zero, you can still poison the enemy.
---
really tho i don't get why you just keep talking yourself in a loop here. It isn't irrelevant lol. I don't know what to tell you buddy. I have stated a very specific use case, as well as additional benefits that come with it. There's literally no methods that do anything similar so idk what you are getting at?
---
Feelsbadman.jpg
---
Even the duck is casting shame hahahaha
---
Yes they are, they key here is that there must be a justifiable reason. If I reclaim money I paid for 30 days membership when I only received 25, there is no legitimate reason for them to take any negative action. 
---
If you don’t want your money back, that’s cool, but perhaps you could open your mind enough to realise the player base is entirely made up of spineless people.
---
It's been 5 hours.  Where the calculation
---
&gt;not a private server
---
&gt;20x exp 
---
Pick one
---
Down vote my comments even though I explain how not to burn food lol ight
---
Ah yes, how fortunate of me and everyone else that this is no longer the 1950s. Where societally speaking, no race is looked down upon anymore. (Thankfully) 
---
But, nah, let’s just give the minority group who still hate people because they have the “wrong” skin color, an easily accessible term that makes people go into attack mode. REAL big brain thinking there.
---
13 when?
---
True! I considered putting all exp into defense for this run, but decided against it because going through the entire cave at 1 attack (and like you said, without ranged) sounds like big cba.  If you don't get lucky poisons mage/Jad might also regen hp too fast, haven't done the calc on that one though.
---
Dude the other guy is right. They will lock the account if you do a chargeback. Your advice is straight up wrong
---
Just got Rangers on my first try. Not the luck I was looking for honestly.
---
If I've said it once I've said it a million times. Move your house to tav.
---
I think [green dragonhide vambraces](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Green_d%27hide_vamb) are the best F2P gloves for both melee and ranged. So I'd recommend picking up a pair from the G.E. or the Champions's guild if you can afford them. Unless I'm colourblind, and you're already wearing them. It just looks like leather to me.
---
I liked Baywatch Zac Efron more
---
What if it is?
---
on the other hand, i've never played civ and know of the glitch because it's commonly memed
---
I'm already stroking my pet cock
---
Like u/Rattyp00ned said, Runelite(:
---
When you think she’s trying to give you a tug but  really she’s just trying to log into your account and drop trade your GP you’ve worked your whole existence for:/
---
Can I get a link if this available to the public?
---
It's ok, i bought 8 of them at 115m or so - so profited nicely ;)
---
Bib the rib dib libber sib kib
---
Make sure it was from runelite.net and not .net.jp or whatever, Google ads are often of fake versions at the top
---
How
---
Fucking hell...
---
wheres the link?
---
what application are you going to use this for?
---
im assuming it's for like a company
---
You cba until someone ties your record
---
Nice lul
---
Lumbridge isn't far from a bank there's one basically below you
---
I hope this is for something super niche. Otherwise someone’s wasting a lot of money lol
---
You just ignoring the fact that Rendi himself said in his own video that he figured out the glitch and told them...
---
We dont need discord logs to be 'faked' to prove rendi was the badguy lol.
---
it was inside you this whole time champ
---
but it's not stupid a bullshit grind, mining essence doesn't take more than a couple of hours, even piscarilius takes longer. Back when runelite didn't have the library plugin people would just use an excel sheet or even MS paint like I did, it really wasn't THAT bad, books are always in the same places
---
TIL trees have leaves
---
I think what really gets me about this is that this was all technically possible in 2007.  If I am correct nothing this guy uses is based on any changes Jagex has made to the game in OSRS
---
He's probably just abanonded his cart and only made this for the meme
---
I sold my 900$ gaming laptop last month that had a mobile i7 8th gen, 16gb ram, Gtx 1650 mobile and I got 20 fps on fossil island......
---
guess that's why you don't need any other type of bait when fishing for sharks with a harpoon
---
Agreed
---
Which is factually incorrect. It's okay to be wrong, everyone makes mistakes.
---
&gt;Precisely. Seemingly everyone else has been capable of doing their farming runs without a balloon there for this far since the introduction of the farming guild. 
---
Not sure what you are getting at here? Of course people do farming runs without a balloon there... because there isn't a balloon there...? And if the balloon was added, people would continue to do farm runs. What's your point?
---
&gt;What does this even mean lol
---
Was that not your exact logic? You said that because you can move your house to Taverly to do this, another solution is irrelevant? 
---
&gt;and you are simply asking for ways with lower reqs, fewer clicks, etc. You are literally just asking for the game to be made easier.
---
What? No I'm not? Pretty sure Redwood trees are a higher skill req than moving your house to taverly lol. Also probably more clicks?? 
---
&gt;Theres no issue with suggesting mid level gameplay. There is an issue with suggesting mid level game play that eclipses higher level gameplay.
---
I'd agree, but wait does my suggestion eclipse higher gameplay, or get eclipsed by higher gameplay? You've said both now.
---
&gt;You clearly do. If getting to taverley is such a tedious endeavor for you, then skip that patch instead of asking for the game to be made easier for you. You'll take a decent hit to your xp, but so what? You dont care about efficient play, right?
---
What? If I cared about efficiency I'd just move my house to Taverly. That'd be much faster than taking a balloon, wouldn't it? Like I said, it's not about making anything easier. This suggestion wouldn't increase xp rates by very much at all, and even still it wouldn't be the most efficient method. 
---
And also as I've been mentioning getting to taverly is just a part of it. Teleportation to and from Grand Tree would also be beneficial. It would also help for like mid-run breaks. Forgot seeds or saplings? The balloon would make a great cheap way to pop over to the Farming guild to grab them and get back.
---
He legit said in the video he was gonna do it lol
---
That is a well rounded comment.
---
oof
---
2.5m?!  How did it cost that much?
---

Yews back in the day were 400+ lol

You can tick eat my attack anytime u want bb

I know :(   And axes were called hatchets at one point.
---
Did you just call his comment fat?
---
You can do barrows with these stats
---
I miss those days lol
---
I posted it as a general comment.

The answer (if you're too lazy to search for it) is 6.4, so 6.
