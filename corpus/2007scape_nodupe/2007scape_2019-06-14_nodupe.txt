killing low level pvp one update at a time

Lol you must be poor as fuck
---
Whats the show?
---
Nah lol

---
That response confirms you have really been trying the whole time, damn that’s sad.

I do have one started actually, havent used it in ages, think i got to like 75 fm at wintertodt and my membership ran out, and havent been navk since haha
---
500 total is extremely shitty for people who just want to make quick pures (and remake them once they exit their combat bracket.)
---
This sub cannot stomach the idea that forcing everyone to play every part of the game just because you enjoy it is not good game design.  I have no interest in skilling -- I have a tentative interest in Pking.  With a 500 total requirement, it's just not worth bothering.  
---
And I'd never be able to convince my friends to get into it with me.  Friends who get excited seeing PvP combat until you tell them it'll take a work week's worth of staring at trees/spam clicking logs etc. just to access the content.
---
But any time this is brought up, the community floods with downvotes and laughs, spitefully, at how they're harming the pking community.  It's just a bunch of mains throwing alternative playstyle players to the wolves in exchange for feeling slightly more secure from bots.
---
300 is tolerable.  You get close with a standard pure setup.  500 would be high enough to kill any growth because pking is already hard enough to get into.  Adding an arbitrary grind requirement as well just ensures no one new bothers with it
---
I'm down with this. Someone screenshot this and send it to mod ash. I dont have a twitter lol
---
I'm kinda close but not at the same time, can I join the discord tho so when Im ready I can learn
---
Theres no way swampletics got someone who doesnt play the game into the game.
---
Thing is that most people doing FFA CoX and ToB are shit so you're better off just splitting

We all agree that pvp burns more money per time played but since there are so many more pvmers the amount of resources being burned by all of pvm is way higher than the resources burned by all of pvp. Not taking sides just clarifying his statement

Just do FFA

Yeah I don’t think he realizes how badly a noob can be lured, especially if they are young and this is their first MMORPG. Heck, I look back at my teenage self and think about how I got lured and scammed in the ways the ways that I did. My first death was literally at barb village when I had just started playing was low level, a person told me to attack a barbarian and that he would help me kill it, there I am, 12 year old in my first mmo, having teamed up with a person for the first time ever, or so I thought. As I was getting hacked by 0s and 1s and 3s and slowIy killing myself, I realized the situation but I was so taken by adrenaline that I literally forgot that I can just click and walk away from the fight. I was instead typing “Please help!” Over and over. As I died, he typed “noob” and I didn’t even know the meaning of it at the time. That’s how gullible and hotheaded a 12 year old kid who is new to  mmos can be. 
---
Nowadays, some of the lures and scams are so elaborate that a vet might never ever see it coming. Or try to 200iq the scammer and still get outsmarted. That’s why if I’m sitting at GE and I hear “hey you wanna earn -“ 
---
“Fuck off.”

What is the fastest farming XP on a budget at lower levels? I don't know much about the skill, only level 17 from a quest. I was thinking fruit trees, but I'm not sure how the payment to the gardeners work, and if this would be too expensive to maintain even with cheap seeds. Thanks for your time
---
There is no 1:1 rule. 
---
Quote by Mod mat K:
---
&gt;The answer to AHK is that if you use it you run the risk of being banned. Although in the past you have heard people quote an 1:1 rule, this is not nor has ever been true. It is a myth that many people (including Jmods) believed and as such was propagated as fact. It is not a fact.
---
&gt;The only answer we will give is that if you use it you run the risk of being banned.
---
&gt;Our approach to AHK has not changed so if you have been using it for a long time and have not been banned you are probably safe to assume what you are doing is okay. The reason we won't be more specific is those that want to cheat will push any guidelines we set out to the max and when they get banned they will complain that they thought what they were doing were in the guidelines."
---
They don’t understand, I wouldn’t worry.
---
The only people that this total level inconveniences is legitimate players that want to  pvp. Emblem farmers are just going to bot the levels like they bot everything else.
---
This whole subreddit would have an aneurysm if they added 10 bh kills before you could start doing slayer.
---
this is amazing
---
That's really not true at all. You can suicide bot for says straight and not get banned. If you bother to use/write a private script ban rates are hilariously low, especially if the account has an older creation date. Getting banned from botting is mostly pure RNG or someone reporting you. Jagex likes to say things like this to underplay the problem, but it's really not all that true.
---
whats whack is that the chinese people i meet (as part of a thing i do), most of them dont know about it
---
If you watched the 'botting to max' series a while ago, I saw someone doing AHK to max. Only watched a few minutes of the first episode, but it's different. Otherwise I am a big fan of the bot hunting videos and the playing runescape properly series.
---
It’s weird that someone who knows about OSRS, and is close enough to know that they are posted on the subreddit, somehow doesn’t have a Reddit account. Especially since they have a Twitter account too. People try to fake being other people for karma/clout all the time, so most of the time when someone says “hey this is me” with a freshly made Reddit account, chances are it’s not actually them.

Correction:  “How to revive mass luring from g.e”
---
&gt;-New music soundtracks only obtainable through playing DMM (some entry level, such as making an account, getting your first kill, and some high level, such as your first GWD/Raid on DMM, and your first kill against a player for a loot/bank value of over 10M). 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;​
---
&gt;-Cosmetics only obtainable through bloodmoney (and add limitations to how often you can kill the same player for bloodmoney to prevent abuse.) 
---
&gt;-Add the ability to transfer XP to OSRS (at a 1:20 ratio)
---
&gt;-Add Vesta, Statius, Morrigan, and Zuriel weaponry to OSRS - but only obtainable through DMM. Make the DMM drop rate 1/20th of what it was in the seasonals.
---
Just.. No.
---
i cant even remember what my original point was lol  :)  
---
but i want a gate to the wilderness at G.E thats all i know 
---
hahahhahaa
---
My computer would catch fire if I even tried to load 2 rs clients
---
In a way I agree with you, but I cant remember if this also came with those ridiculous Disney-esque chatheads and goofy running animations. Those need to be banished from the game for eternity and beyond
---
Set your block list to exclude all highest weighted non-hydra tasks
---
Sounds like forced content for osrs players that don’t want to play DMM but would because of music cape/easier money making/stats. 
---
It wouldn’t be lasting playerbase tbh.
---
i'm pretty sure that doesnt change the value of the rewards
---
It doesnt make sense lore wise.  A big marketplace should be walled off from a lawless warzone.
---
The death of the game when it was removed is a fairly good indicator, in all fairness it was also coupled with the removal of free trade which was huge but it's pretty disingenuous to pretend that pvp wasn't an absolutely massive part of the game back then, hell it was basically end game for a lot of high level players unless you enjoy running kq over and over. But aside from that pvp orientated players burn through food/runes/brews/restores faster than anyone, not to mention pvp players bring in a huge chunk of revenue for Jagex with all of their alt builds.
---
Chaotic good

What? Someone probably told her "yo your tinder is on reddit lol" so she made an account just to comment. Happens all the time. Having a twitter account and a reddit account isn't related at all.

There's one charging outlet in the entire gate area?

As someone who play in this era and not in 07, I say hell yeah.
---
From my perspective people are upset about a lack of new bosses like gwd that just exist on the map. 
---
Maybe a new boss area appears in the desert akin to gwd :(
---
510 kc.. 1x peg.. thats it

You shifted the goalpost again. I bet you already went and looked and saw that I was right and you can't admit you're wrong.

That's why you've shifted the goal post twice now.

Thanks for explaining.

---
It’s not the worst thing honestly
---
IIRC it's: "Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction"
---
I’d start with something like mort more fungus or if you have the hunter, chins. Then after a bit of gp an easy boss like barrows
---
its only a choice once
---
You could seriously just trade over a bunch of fletching, cooking, firemaking supplies and be halfway there in a couple of hours
---
If these changes are not enough, I'd like to suggest adding 7 days as a member as a requirement. This way the free trial wont be able to be abused for botting.
---
bank standing bots are about to get a lot more common
---
I'm so jealous that you get to discover all of this game brand new. I wish that I had the joy of discovery with osrs again.
---
They hated Jesus because he spoke the truth
---
Basic supplies such as food, super sets, ppots, stam pots, best combat gear you can get for all styles, and runes for teleports
---
Its like an extra gp per xp not an extra mil an hour... If you have a large bank value with low bank space its not worth imo.
---

76. I still got 2-3 kill trips but that's about as good as you'll get till you get dhcb.  With dhcb i always get at least 3. You using archers ring I? Blessed dhide boots? I assume you're praying eagle eye too.
---
Indeed
---
Couldn't agree anymore my guy. Take this upvote man. Lmao
---
Again, you're demonstrating what I mean.  You consider anyone who doesn't want to waste time the way you do to be a 'crybaby'.  Random skilling to hit 500 total would procure zero benefit for these PvP accounts.  It's strictly a waste of time.  This is rarely a matter of laziness -- I, and many of my peers, can't justify wasting time grinding several work days worth of boring, soul-sucking low-level, unrewarding, monotonous grinding just so that we can *begin* to try Bounty Hunter.  I can hardly justify putting a few days or weeks aside to do that on one account, let alone repeatedly each time a PvP account out-levels its designed PvP bracket.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But, we're just going in circles now.  You have time to waste.  You don't mind wasting it.  So you call anyone who doesn't want to waste it a "baby."  
---
It can't be helped; you're not arguing against my point about the self-absorbed, unempathetic nature of the main population of this sub towards alternative playstyles.  You're literally *a demonstration of my point.*
---
When you see a cute noob picture and have absolutely no idea what's wrong

Yes all of that im getting 1-2 kills with cbow. Ill try bp again tomorrow. I had way less gear and no salve last time. Thanks!
---
Yeah. This is true. But you're not stopping me from running to 30 and 1 click TPing out unless you tele block me, which stops the imp box anyway.
---
I was trying, badly to imply that imp boxes working like this don't matter in the slightest.

Like I mentioned above, there's tons of options for capes. Others have also pointed it out, but if OP is mostly a combat account, farming the Obby Cape will probably be in his best interest.
---
I'd personally shoot for a Skillcape of some sort, but that takes a large amount of time. Obby will at least provide a substantial bonus until a Skill Cape/Fire Cape can be obtained, and farming one will probably be easier than buying one at OP's level (Assuming he's midrange and doesn't have a whole lot of income options).

Dipthong is a combination of vowels that's been shortened so that the sound of one vowel flows into the next
---
In Korean this concept is pretty prominent, such as when you combine 오 (pronounced "oh" sorta like in "goal") and 아 (pronounced like the a in "awe"), you get "oh-a." However when said quickly, it sounds more like "wah" and has overtime become the norm

Para se fazer prayer flicking, só é necessário uma conexão continua e a prática do método em si. 
---
O tamanho do Ping somente influência na primeira sequência do flicking, depois ele continua indiferente do Ping aderido.
---
Acontece bugs de que os prayers estão até sendo mostrados desativados no prayer book, mas continuam ativos em overheads e em damage boost, por exemplo.
---
Fiz um theory crafting quando fui pegar a infernal cape e notei esse tipo de assunto.
---
Dude, I have played since 2007 and I still don't have a fire cape on any account. Some people are just not interested in PvM at all, and never get good at it.

TBH, I haven't runecrafted since 30 runecrafting. 69 comes from lamping exclusively. Gonna have to do the 70-77 hustle soon for Fremnick elites, which is next on the chopping block. Maybe I'll try to do that for profit! Diaries have always been my goal but it's just so slow now.. Skilling has never been my forte, but its definitely a good suggestion to grab a profitable 99... Thanks!

I was just thinking about this recently with the "first achievement" route memes.  It was a break from the battle.  The crew would follow each other, stop to pray, have a bathroom break or whatever.  You’d come back to a couple teammates that didn’t need to bank who had things to fill you in with..

I’m sure it’s me just me being too distracted and stoned though tbh
---
might as well go play RS3 if you are bringing back HD graphics. 07 graphics are more fitting and superior for the current oldschool runescape game.

This is actually pretty cool

Just because a person damns you, it doesn’t justify your pain to punish a whole population of players.

I've never done the boss before but I'm sure if he's doing it with 13 prayer it can't eat up too many prayer pots considering the prayers he has access to are next to useless.
---
Is that a troll? The wilderness is made to attack other players. Some won’t give mercy because of that fact. It doesn’t mean the whole population will do that to you. Some will let you go and some may even help you. It’s not cool to damn the whole population.

Suddenly 1500 total with barrows on a clean account.
---
She looks goofy and weird. Badass is vannaka using 2h and a shield or duradel with the rune claws
---
careful
---
&gt;If you actually end up doing less damage, nobody gets the loot at all.
---
The last sentence in my post lol. Still doesn't change the fact that you get all the loot, either you get loot or nobody does.
---
I was at 2.1k total on my main. I swapped to iron and completed gwd. Then I dropped my whole ironman bank and been having fun on my main again. Ironman is fun until you killed all the bosses and you are done xd.
---
oh okay.. thanks a lot for the info!
---
Fireballs come so fast D:
---
I allocated 2m cash stack to buying back my items. Guides are cool but I only learn by doing bosses. It made it so much easier for me to have the peace of mind to die as many times as I needed. I forget how many times I died maybe 6 total? 2 at Vorkath and 4 at Galv? I'd rather have a little worse gear but plenty of space for mistakes so I don't get stressed.
---
One time at Galv I forgot to buy my items back, did something dumb, and lost void. Very painful. Don't forget about that part :P
---
I beat Galv with something silly like 10hp and no food. Very lucky. No better way then just doing it :)

&gt;As for my experience with "established" clans every time I see or hear someone say "I was with \[Insert Name\]" They're generally the most braindead fucking people I've ever met. As in they long south revs, run passed a skulled craws bow and call out some bolt ragger. They're generally Multi-bots.
---
Damn dude, sounds like you're an expert and know a lot about clanning. I'll leave you to it.

I completed my ironman (all except raids 1 and 2) and now I regret playing ironman... I woulda been maxed on my main.
---
If you’re a high level account, stay in singles and can afford a Bulwark it’s really hard to get pk’d, I’ll give that to you.  Kind of a straw man argument though because it doesn’t really address my main point that pking as a whole simply isn’t fun for the person being pk’d if they’re grossly outclassed and that pvp should be competitive, not predatory.  We can agree to disagree though, Pkers get enough hate in the community already and I don’t like being toxic and adding on to it.  None of these suggestions will make it into the game anyway though (except maybe the dark spirit tree—that’s actually a decent idea.  I always thought there were way too few useful places to plant spirit trees)

The issue with your idea is the fact that if they were to design a grandmaster quest that required 90 defense. Or 2 defense. Or some requirement like that, pures would be up in arms. Pures can't complete ds2, mm2, so why should they be able to, or want to complete another grandmaster quest? Grandmaster quests should require an even balance of stats, high and low. Pures do not have that. In my eyes, an account that is purposely gimping itself shouldn't be the reason quest requirements are changed.

and as the game (including bossing) gets easier for your ironman, the importance of ironman bossing achievements approaches the importance of bossing on a regular account. that is to say that your currently impressive bossing achievements become less impressive/worth mentioning as the devs make bossing easier for you. sucks, man.

there's no question here btw. Also highly doubt you being on your phone is going to get you killed or hurt, or even fired if your job is worth having. ByeBye, gonna block you now aristotle.
---
I tried changing the wiki he price of unstrung unholy emblems (94 gp per emblem instead of 294) but I’m stupid. I made like 5k of them. I took a 300k loss on it.
---
Get prayer up
---
ITT: OP is a crazy angst monster turn back while you still can.
---
I'm Canadian.
---
My condolences
---
imnot saying the cape is good or suggesting him to buy it, i am saying that farming it is 500% not worth it.
---
i don't like the idea of free teleports. i think the home teleport to lumbridge is nice primarily as a "i found a glitch spot and can't move" failsafe but not because i actually principally think any free teleports should exist.
---
minigame teleports are pseudo-lodestones we already have and that's way more than enough imo.
---
Well if you make content have more reward then they risk their reward.  The gp risk doesn't necessarily have to all come from their gear and inventory.
---
I’m a semi poor boy. The only real expensive thing I have banked is an eternal glory. After that it’s combat gear. A whip and full dragon. Med helm ofc.
---
Thanks :D

With sang i can do 80-85 kills per hour and 100+  trip. Id assume around 70-75 with trident. I prefer this 100000x over claw/POH method
---
when discussing trident use the right answer is virtually always mage levels. the other 2 are just kinda convenient, mage levels will actually really expedite your kills/h. you can circumvent the need for the pool/suffering by using someone else's house/equipping recoils
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
I'd say around 15k/hr from your current levels. I'd nearly suggest putting slayer off until like 70 combat  (training combat focused via crabs or NMZ or something) as early slayer is tedious and means you spend a lot of time fighting mobs that are annoying or far off. 
---
At those higher levels you are assigned better tasks, can kill them faster with better gear and get better drops.
---
I would recommend getting Obsidian platelegs. That with Fighter Torso from Barbarian Assault would be your BiS for a while until you can afford to upgrade to Bandos.
---
He scapes cuz depressed, and depressed cuz scapes. Why would he need to go anywhere to solve this? it seems like he knows the solution, a 3rd party saying 'hey, maybe don't play' doesn't seem effective.
---
I moved out this year for that reason. If you have someone else to stay with, consider asking for help.
---
This looks bad lol
---
So should i stop waiting for dust tasks to burst and just go ahead and burst anyways?
---
first of all, before you even attempt to boost you should build the lower tiers of the pool/jewelry box first. it is an upgrade system, you don't just make the high level one outright. 
---
you could also throw in an occult altar if you'd like to, but it's not super necessary especially if you get 99 magic for the cape.
---
I got 99 firemaking exclusively from the motor pool.
---
Lmao sick burn
---
That’s some sham level 99 shit too lol.
---
Buy full obsidian strength bonus is king
---
Welp, now it’s ruined for me.
---
Ge tracker isn’t perfect but it’s still good enough to be useful. Especially on items not traded at the actual Ge value.
---
This really is sad... I don't know why you people can't manage other things. Go to the damn gym, you can't spare 45 minutes of slaying dragons? go to bars go outside damn.. atleast read jordan petersons video on how to get over depression. This ancient java game should not be your way out... jesus.
---
You said it, man.
---
You could get a bond if gold isn't too scarce for you too!
---
Don't worry, OP didn't even play DeviousMUD. He's a newscaper and is just insecure about it.
---
That’s just the difference between knowing your shit and knowing you’re shit.
---
It’s a 2head questions. The dude could just go die in lumbridge and run back and pick up his stuff to see what he kept? But did he no, he asked for advice and when he was given the correct advice, he still argued, just like you are. The screen isn’t wrong, it shows you what 3 items you’re gonna keep and what items you might possibly lose. That screen will never be fixed because of how barrow and other items work like that. It’s too much work for such a stupid update. So yes you can sit here and cry and complain about a screen, or you can come here ask for advice, and then leave with knowledge instead of trying to tell the people who’s trying to help y’all, you’re wrong . But whatever man, you do you
---
Yeah bro once you get the Fighter Torso + Dragon defender you're gonna feel like such a Chad. I know I did
---
Gmaul is retarded
---
You can not access the bank as a pure. Your best best is to either home teleport to an alter in your house (if you have prayer) then Varrock Tele to spirit tree in the ge then gnome strong hold and go back to daero, waydar, then Lumbo and repeat.
---
That CoX mass is going to be wild in terms of finding your partner when teleports pop up
---
If you compare it to other higher tier armor, its pretty dull, bland.
---
not realy most people just avoid tradeing outside of the ge. 
---
it also helps to not be greedy and avoid clearly fishy things.
---
Considering a gmaul requires 50 attack, I don't think so
---
Maybe they neck themselves because they come to the obvious realization that chopping their dicks off and turning them inside-out doesn’t turn them into the sexy femme fatalé they want to be. I feel for these individuals, but they are sick in the same way that anybody with a warped view of their own bodily reality is. They need counseling and (if necessary) antidepressants/stabilizers. They should not be told that their own warped and inaccurate view of themselves is stunning and beautiful; they will not pass as an attractive member of their preferred gender and they will only cost taxpayers/their insurance thousands of dollars in a pursuit of vanity.
---
As someone who is experienced at the boss, points 1, 3, 4, and 5 are wrong. 6 is sust a consequence of lag at any content that requires any precise timing whatsoever, not really a problem with the design of cerberus.
---
Do those stack???
---
Funny, I commented the exact same thing over an hour prior and only got downvoted.
---
Why are on earth are you being downvoted lol
---
Hard pass if it takes any time away from literally any other update
---
Also the magic xp ;)
---
No, "literally everyone" didn't. I would **never** play osrs if it had any type "HD" graphics.
---
I’m just gonna post here incase someone offers you a clan. I just left mine so I’m pretty much on my own aswell, hahaha.
---
Feel free to add me, though.
---
Get ready to have your mind blown:
---
You can alch noted items. Now go and alch forever, friend.
---
Yikes
---
*WHEEZE*
---
I did a lot of barrows starting around your level and this info helped me a lot. With your stats you probably want to use Iban's blast against all the brothers except Ahrim, for Ahrim I'd recommend a magic shortbow (i). Wear your best defensive armor, all the melee brothers have 0 mage defense so your mage attack bonus doesn't matter. Karil has very low mage defense, so it's helpful to have at least +1 magic attack bonus vs him, you can take off some armor while fighting him if you want.
---
You only actually need to use prayer vs Dharok, Ahrim, and Kharil, so kill those first in whatever order works for you. Depending on how fast your kills are, you can probably get through those with 1-2 doses of prayer. The other brothers are innacurate so you can get by just eating food whenever you get too hurt, you can eat like 7 monkfish for the cost of one prayer dose so it's much cheaper.
---
In the tunnels don't get above 88% reward potential - this prevents getting cheap bolt racks as a reward and you still have max chance for barrows items. Good combinations of monster to kill are two skeletons and a bloodworm, or 1 skeleton, 1 rat, and 2 bloodworms. 
---
Lastly unless you have high construction use a dueling ring in between runs to go to clan wars, use the FFA portal to refresh your stats and bank if needed.
---
I believe it too. As. HCIM a lot of people tell me they want to see me die. I don't get the hate for an account I'm just challenging myself on.
---
What the 🦆
---
What the literal fuck. I’m so angry right now. 😂😂 I never knew this.
---
I vote no to pk updates because the majority of pvp players voted no to spellbook icon resizing. That would of been huge for PVM but pkers were like NOPE nobody's gonna make clicking barrage icon easier on my watch. No fuck pvp updates y'all can rot
---
On the bright side, my magic is only 60. So I haven’t wasted a lot of time yet lol
---
At what point does PKing become griefing?
---
*Former* Mod Mat K
---
Limit tier upgrades by level.
---
Go figure it out you're a big boy now.
---
Buying gf
---
I don't like it = No one else should have it
---
I'm over it tbh, everything you do is literally just a go/hr method. Want to go kill vorkath? You're just printing gold, want to do barrows? More gold, but less efficient. Raids? Yeah that's fun but still for what goal, just to get drops to sell to buy other items. Meh.
---
I said “my” history. And that one you’re talking aboot is with item lending I believe, something that as you know doesn’t exist in osrs. I just refuse to believe there is a trade scam in where gold doesn’t exist. Given how many players fall for even just the double exp I find it way more likely that he fell for a non bug scam.
---
Deadman coming out and people getting ready to swap over is my guess.
---
Big Mouth Billy Batts.
---
Ummm you forgot Wildy slayer bro!
---
How did you farm your clues?
---
Plug your damn phone in ):

To whom I can reach at Jagex, MY ACCOUNT WAS BANNED  FOR SOMETHING I TRULY DID NOT  DO!  - Scatzie420- 
---
The night of 6/4 - 6/5/19 my Oldschool Runescape account was hacked. I AFK’d from my desktop to head upstairs to bed thinking my runescape account would time out. I then grab my iPad to play the game further upstairs in bed, realizing my account hadn’t been logged out yet.  I was still unable to log in at this time, not thinking much of it I passed out.  In the morning 6/5/2019 I still couldn’t log into  my account from the iPad. 
---
Then I realized that my account had been compromised. I quickly rushed downstairs to the desktop, logged on the Runescape website. Changed my password, set up an authenticator. I had a bank pin pending on my account but that takes 7 days. I was on day 3 of the bank pin process. Why didn’t I have an authenticator?  I didn’t use one growing up when I was 13 years old,  I didn’t think I'd  need one at 28. REKTED! 
---
After changing my password, and setting an authenticator. I proceed to log on to my account. My pending bank pin was canceled.My bank was heavily looted, almost everything in my bank of GP value was sold overnight on the Grand Exchange. 
---
In 2019 I became the dumbass who got hacked.  How do I know I was hacked?? The hacker overnight  picked over 8.6k flax.. BRUH ! I'd never have the patience to pick that much flax.  On top of that I think I had lvl 44 crafting, I was cutting gems. I had no need for flax.
---
After being hacked, I read the terms and policies on Jagex  item returns/restorations. I came to the conclusion that I’d never receive my in-game items back. I can bounce back. What I cannot bounce back from is my account being banned for something I truly didn't  do and/or capable of doing. I was able to play the game for about an hour or so that morning, after changing my password and setting up an authenticator  before my account was shut down for “macroing major”. I didn't even know what this was until I did research.(Botting for short)
---

---
To Jagex and the OSRS Community!
---
I started my online gaming career with OSRS in 2004 on Ghettoboy30. That was  over 15 Years ago! Despite being hacked in 2019! I truly enjoy the community of OSRS and wouldn’t jeopardize the community for cheating! I wouldn't ruin any game by choosing to cheat my way to success! Even though my account  was new and was less than a month old, It's the simple fact that my account banned wrongfully. Yes, I NOW understand that the 2-step security process is set in stone to help players keep a secure account. When you’re reliving your first childhood  MMORPG in 2019, you tend to get lost in the awesome sauce. I was the dumbass who got lost in the awesome sauce and hacked. You might say make a new account. My pride and my wife won’t allow me to grind another account out because I know deep down that I did nothing wrong. Before I truly give up on OSRS I want to make a final attempt on recovering my account.
---
PLEASE HELP ME OBTAIN MY HONEST OSRS ACCOUNT BACK

5 fps
---
Am I the only person who doesn’t have a problem with ironman?
---
Ur slower to agree with me dawg
---
The designs and updates past 6 years is a proven formula to get people addicted and hooked to private server designs. The osrs since 2013 encourage unhealthy addictions, no change at all, instead of focus on wellbeing and proper game designs that discourage unhealthy addiction 
---
It does not look appealing to me. It will never be appealing to me anymore.
---
so how many lobs you getting per hour?
---
300 hours? Tf were u doing in menaphos?
---
FPS auto drops when a window isn’t in focus. The window in focus tends to run anywhere from 15-30 FPS depending on what’s going on.
---
🍞🦀🍞
---
Undercover vennies not gonna fool me
---
Unbalanced content and pvm-scape has already make this game appear as an addiction.
---
Not to include having alts to help you, 3rd party clients as well. These are prominent points that encourage unhealthy addiction
---
But why you doing this to yourself?
---
That's false. Don't say stupid stuff like that. Depression is a serious mental health issue.
---
Pvmers will never pvm in pvp worlds. You cant use cannon in pvp worls, you cant bring your bis slot gear making things slower, you now also got the risk of being pked. It only has cons hence why it wont happen.
---
And you think not exercising and sitting inside all day will help? Lmao.
---
He means fake n gay
---
Started in 04 and used spend all my hours off school on countless mage pures as well. I was there too.
---
Surely, this update would have been nice back in the day - I'm not saying I enjoyed the walk - but that's not what this thread is about. Convenient or not, my point is that this update still does little to nothing to draw people into the Wilderness. I think mindlessly "wasting" time in Wildy on temporary accounts is unfortunately long gone in efficiencyscape. 
---
This thread aside, have you ever heard *anyone* say they would multi-PK in Varrock more if the walking distance was shorter? I think not to be honest.
---
Im literally on prozac you dolt.
---
How many bones/ hour is gilded altar, with letting it go automaticly ?
---
Yea I'm sure his teammates love him
---
Living this way, how do you think your story ends?
---
I dont get it
---
I know exactly what an incel is, and I was describing their pattern of thinking.
---
looks like a blast!  Ty for the service sir.
---
can't tickeat the big bomb though, and with scythe you may not have the dps to sustain your supplies
---
What happened to going to the gym?
---
Just use extended antis and dfire shield
---
Admire my empty bank at GE.
---
I plan on playing it but honestly i will play rs and wow at the same time.  One nice thing about being an adult now is being able to afford my own shit, so my 3 screen set up will finally be put to good use i guess.
---
Ive found something of a balance for myself on my main.  Instead of grinding vorkath and zulrah nonstop for my end game gear (although I've done a few hundred kc), I wait until i have the requirements and get them myself.  I learned sire for my blugeon, waited until my prim crystal drop for my boots, and Im only 1 lv away from being able to do Hydra for my lance. I feel that this way, I'm still exploring content that might not be "optimal", but i get the feeling of accomplishment for having earned it like and ironman without needing to waste tons of time gathering supplies.
---
That's why his "depression" was in quotes. He's not saying those things about actual clinical depression - chill your tits and read his post again.
---
"Just stop being depressed lol"
---
Can confirm that exercise is a really good ‘cure’ for depression.
---
had to get 256kc for that btw hahahaha
---
We are not doing “get help” it’s so embarrassing.
---
I used the depression to destroy the depression.
---
People thing it will cause an increase in lures
---
Probably not. Ppl will hop on classic wow and afk skill on rs at the same time.
---
Lol yet.
---
Yet.
---
Or actually try and make an effort. If you can jerk your penis 3x a day you can go outside for 15 mins a day
---
You’re probably right, but if we suffer because of the bots isn’t that, in a way, letting the bots win?
---
If x is one then yes
---
No correlation, exercise lowers depression this is a proven clinical study, hence go to the gym. Very simple.
---
Oof, don't think anyone should be taking advice from a fucking dolt like JBP.
---
Thats kind of the point. Arent we all depressed?
---
That's so weird to me because Osrs to me will always be "ugly" but I have never seen that as a bad thing. All hd graphics in osrs to me just seems like polishing a turd.
---
This can be implemented but is most likely due to state saving: whenever an app is pushed to the background it tries to limit ram usage. While some data remains in RAM - the rest of it is pushed to the storage of the phone (way slower) and code cannot be executed. It ‘freezes’ the app. This happens after some time (it’s an algorythm that decides this). On android you have options to disable this but if you do, remember: your battery will drain very - very quick.
---
Im sure the vnz gov will let a private company have a branch for a few dozens underpaid graphic designers lmao, and ofc the community will all think its normal that theyre paid 10 cents an hour, its such a ridiculous suggestion sorry
---
You don’t start a complete rewrite by throwing away the existing codebase.  The graphics engine for the client is a reasonable initial target because it lends itself to modularity naturally.
---
The place to get test coverage is around the integration touch points, not necessarily all the code to be rewritten, but it’s also easier to verify correctness by porting unit tests before implementations.
---
I was dreading doing it because I just knew that with my RNG it would take me 256 kills and it was the last task needed to complete the diary
---
I need some people like this to get me back at it in my game too! That’s great they helped you out like that though
---
This was literally me today even doing vorkath lmaooo
---
I wouldn't call 3x 85 a nearly maxed pure.
---
Shame
---
Time locked iron man account
---
You honestly don't even know how happy I am right now. I had like total shit equipment and was training in a really bad place, really lost, but this group just came in randomly doing this for me! Dw man, you will eventually find a group like that!
---
Congrats man you read the loot tracker!
---
Where is this?
---
The earlier torso and legs looked good, just the helm needed change. This just looks all around awful.
---
Bruh...... this post is bad and you should feel bad.......
---
Number of benefits the delay will give: Zero.
---
It doesn't solve the underlining issue. It just delays the inevitable. Your account remains vulnerable, as your account's details remain compromised.

OSRS runs using java and uses a specialized version of Javascript called RuneScript to write code in a similar manner to C++.
---
RS3 is using NXT which replaced HTML5 which in turn replaced the Java based engine in 2012.

Yea Dark seas is dead but it’s because all of the players moved over to the Emerald server (one of the original servers). All things like blockades, Sea Monster Hunts and pillages are constantly going on, especially during weekends

Jagex should add ray tracing to runescape, that way I can see the grooves of the trees I chop in clear definition

If this logic stood up, we would have group Iron man mode

That would certainly slow them down but it's about finding restrictions that don't screw normal players

I think he was just being sarcastic. I would like to see the games room revitalized as well, and i agree cosmetic rewards are probably the way to go.
---
Rshd was amazing, it is truly a shame we will never see it implemented in osrs.
---
You and I have different understandings of the word "hard". You equate long and complex to hard. I don't. I think fast click speeds and reaction times like those necrssary for high-level bridding are hard. The only difficulty in the inferno once you've got a tbow is the time commitment. After that, it's just a matter of perseverance. And no, rote learning through sheer repetition isn't the definition of good gaming, especially in a game like this where reaction times and APM are restricted to the game's low-frequency clock. 
---
Again, if the inferno didn't have tons of trash waves leading up to the big challenges, most players who could defeat jad (who you admit is easy) would have the infernal cape within a day.
---
There's only one person acting like a "stupid and annoying" child in this conversation haha
---
Item management is one of the most important aspects of a RPG like RuneScape. Forgetting items is part of the game, otherwise you might as well remove the items entirely.
---
No thanks. Imagine doubling the dev time for every single content update because you need to make two of each model. BTW osrs HD looked absolutely disgusting and if you think otherwise you are a weak  ass beta shitter.
---
Bank your items!
---
Yes because jagex is aware of every single scam committed in runescape history and are actively ignoring them to jerk off with your 11 dollars.
---
Tbh this would be too massive of a change. There are too many things where 27 extra slots would be a huge buff. Sure it is a little risky to hop, but not enough to make up for a change like that.
---
About 1-3m per hour, avg about 2m.
---
Even in 2004, Burthorpe Games Room was hands down the lamest content I ever tried in the game. Not only are they time consuming games to begin with, but you win nothing at all and you're stuck hoping the person you randomly challenged is interesting to talk to during the game. 
---
They can't really give rewards because people can just take a dive super fast for their friend to rack up points/tickets. It might take 30 turns for a normal game of checkers, but half that if they wanted a specific person to win.
---
And why on earth would essentially board games require an entire fancy facility, regardless of location? Why not just a couple chess tables in falador park, or tables next to the GE where everybody is hanging out not doing anything anyways? Especially if you don't win anything anyways.
---
Just say what you want dude, there's no need to hide behind HAhHaHaHAh ImAgINE.

Youre right they probably wouldn't hold on to them that long.

How in the hell is anyone going to do a HD runescape without using the models from that era?
---
I understand how you feel. So there are two things you can do, just train slayer or aim for elite diaries. Elite diaries will keep you busy for some time, and let u train different skills.
---
I would say do slayer and try to do boss if possible. If you cant, then dont. But if you can, do it. Aim to upgrade your gear slowly, and do clue scrolls after every task. You dont have to grind solo boss like zulrah or vorkath(i didnt), just do them if u get that slayer task.
---
It's a meme but it's also not a meme play at your own risk
---
"take this upvote" as if upvoting is special and you can't do it to every post. Redditors are fuckin weird man...
---
You received 100% of the loot that dropped, correct. If we're counting theoretical loot that never dropped then I've missed out on millions of uniques.
---
Most of the new bosses are for slayer, which is solo.
---
Also Cerberus and Sire, demonic gorillas aren’t instanced.
---
What new bosses that aren’t slayer are instanced?
---
Hespori, moss giant and hill giant boss?
---
Vorkath and zulrah are, and zulrah is 5 years old and vorkath 18 months
---
Cox, tob, corp, wildy bosses and demonic gorillas can all be done with mates
---
They knew his account details and IP to DDoS, and that's why he was lured from the GE at random to the trade screen?
---
Just fucking kick him offline and log in, no problem. The trading shit just wastes time.
---
Do people not think about the chain of events and just accept whatever nonsense others say and jam it into the one story?
---
Haven’t seen his guide yet, but I will most likely will be following it through
---
The issue with OSRS group fights is trusting that team mates will give you a split of a good drop. In RS2 we had lootshare/coinshare which made FFA/teams much less of a trust issue.
---
Skull tricking is not a scam. In a literal sense if you clicked on a player you did this to yourself. Any death in the wilderness that results in the loss of items is a result, first and foremost, of being in the wilderness. Whatever else contributed to your loss wouldn’t have contributed to your loss at the Grand Exchange, only being in the wilderness made it possible. Even the skull trick where someone pretends to box you but is boxing someone under you, while malicious in intent, is still using in-game mechanics. Yes you’re being mislead but that’s the nature of PvP.
---
To be fair its not exactly a hard game to monitor, they would be making a shit tonne of money off us and they still allow shitty bugs, armies of bots and absolute god awful account security and customer support. They have no reason to deny us all of these when we are paying subscription.
---
Kolonizeer die bende
---
Yeah, that sounds reasonable, pretty much what I had on my mind, just wanna Make sure I’m not missing or looking over anything, thanks!
---
Next to Vorkath.
---
So of those aren’t a boss as I’ve already stated and the others are hardly rewarding or worth doing in teams besides Corp for faster kills. That’s the problem. Even group bosses currently in the game are efficient enough for soloing.
---
The only elite diary pures can do is wildy.  In fact the only mediums we can do is karamja and desert.  Everything else can only be done up to easy (kebos included) or not at all (fremenik, morytania)
---
Trimmed comp, the quest requirement does not take anywhere near 300 hours. More like 5-6 if you do obelisks.
---
Sure, but we already have that problem with Twisted bows and Scythes. It’s not like this would be anything new or exclusive to Nex. While I am an advocate of LS or an equivalent automated splitting system, I don’t think the lack of such a system means Nex cannot exist.
---
Random events cannot occur at the ge
---
I was talking about the slay xp so I must say I completely disagree with you. That probably is due to a difference in stats and gear though, I get 40k/hr without too much focus, max combat with tent whip and rune darts
---
&gt; i dont know why it would be so hard if fanmade projects like runelite, konduit, lyzrdlite or even osbuddy can do it. 
---
Fanmade projects could potentially have thousands of contributors developing in their free time. They don't require wages either, unlike employees. Companies aren't benevolent entities that exist to make the world a better place, they exist to make profit. If the benefits of such a project do not outweigh the costs of (hiring) assigning an employee, tough luck, they won't do it.
---
THANKS FOR CLARIFYING
---
Stop playing the game then, why are you telling me these things?
---
Same, i recently redid the quest and enjoyed it much more.
---
Yes i did controlled
---
I probs still would
---
Hey Dwight
---
No, sorry. I completely agree adding a boss like nex would be great fun!
---
But with raids you always get a drop, and at least you have a chance at a good drop based on your performance even if it isn't the best. Currently with things like corp/gwd bosses, if you don't do the most damage you're not going to get the drop.
---
So if Jagex are going to introduce another group boss, they need a way that everyone can get a drop, with a higher chance at getting the best drop based on performance.
---
Sounds destructive
---
Shit you serious? Was that updated like a week after?
---
I think he got it 3 months earlier because he just played a fuck ton, which gave time for those random events lol
---
Do me a favor then, programmer with better credentials than "terrible curry programmers" (I won't bother with that one, just another indicator here).  Instead of simply insinuating you know better and shit posting on reddit:  
---
**step the fuck up**
---
i believe having a (safe) client that the majority of your game uses is of the utmost interest of any gaming company.
---
runescape is probably the only game out there with this huge security issue - hence, me believing that putting some resources there makes sense.
---
you could still capitalize those 1000s of contributors, if they are passionate they will still help. all you need is someone in your company to take oversight.
---
this is also talking in ifs and whens. nobody has concrete numbers on the amount of people leaving due to being "hacked" for using unsecure clients. for clicking on the wrong runelite link etc. is it their fault? yes. did they quite the game? yes, some did. who does it hurt? jagex.
---
Press F to show respect.
---
Throw a bunch of different teleports in my inventory then just zip around the map. Maybe stop and rake some weeds in the middle.
---
It's not anecdotal. Look at the reviews on the the play store and the app store. A TON of younger players are rating it 1 star saying "these graphics are terrible, this game looks 10 years old" not realizing that it IS over ten years old. I'm not talking about people who have played in the past, or people who are reading this sub. If you're subbed here, yeah chances are you DO play the game. But the mobile app has terrible retention for new players. That's not because the game is bad, but because of the nature of mobile apps. It's being downloaded by mostly children who have no idea what the game is and just want to check it out. Most don't return. But obviously 99% of people on this subreddit like the game and like the old school nature of it. You can't look at the people commenting here and assume we are the majority.
---
I've been waiting for this exact argument to come up the "you're upset because it happened to you". Actually, no, it hasn't. And if you had read the post you would see Jagex actively defines scamming as "Misleading other players for your own personal gain" which is exactly what skull tricking is. I also haven't given up on my argument at all. I stated to the previous comment that the wildnerness should not be given a free pass for deceptive behaviour because "ITS THE WILDERNESS". Thats a stupid argument. 
---
Anyways, if you'd like me to continue on from the previous argument which you never responded to. The idea that PVM has to skip content because they cant play the game based on the 3 item policy and being deceived into losing those items is ludacris.
---
Alright calm down
---
If 3 hours a day of rs was making you depressed, it's not the game it's you.
---
You're absolutely right. You have to enjoy the grind to enjoy the game for the most part. But you can't say a game source from 2007 ISN'T dated also. I personally like it for the nostalgia. But a 12 year old will probably think it's just some shitty old game at first glance.
---
That is not a reasonable analogy and you know it is not.
---
No. It gets better when you do something to make a change. Wallowing in misery and maintaining the status quo does nothing. Worst case scenario you get worse and more isolated.
---
t. retard who does nothing to change his situation.
---
As someone who was in a similar situation.....
---
Get a new hobby and play rs less
---
Im sure they didn't, but I also don't know how they could fix it, at least not without backlash from the pvp community. The story of runescape is full of the unintended consequences of things jagex has done and the measures taken(or not taken) to rectify it. 
---
I would like if something could be done without making a large adjustment to game mechanics. Do you have any ideas? Even if it were determined to be scamming, we know how often scams go unpunished. Without video evidence for a reddit/twitter post people will blow up over, victims have a hell of a time getting any justice.
---
That's great but I feel like if you're just starting out a lot of the fun is earning it!
---
That's funny I actually live in Salisbury around 2 miles from Stonehenge :)
---
Awesome! And for it to be untrimmed is really cool.
---
Thats not an issue though, defence should be levelled lmao
---
???? Crab rave meme was already dead on most subs before /r/2007scape started using it lmfao
---
The only thing I can currently think of is adding the pj timer from bounty hunter to all of the wilderness. Allow a certain period of time that the player can’t be targeted. I’m sure that has its downsides but again that’s the first thing I thought of
---
Seems unreasonable but it's happened more times than it hasn't raiding with wdr lmao
---
People don't complain about their successes on social media. If people try to assess the Jagex customer suppot success rate from Reddit stories, they're using a biased sample.
---
You wouldn't think there would be a bug where entering a certain alt code character into chat would disconnect everyone who saw it but it happened A while back.
---
Obviously I don't work for Jagex any more, but I can give some insight.
---
In order to do this properly Jagex would need to remake a whole load of assets, last time they did this it took a team of artists and developers 12 months plus to do it. Having this toggleable would also mean there would be an increase in the amount of work needed for each update (eg making sure everything works in both options) which will slow down how quickly updates will be delivered.
---
Of course, if there is a technological solution (ie something clever that just makes it work) then I am sure Jagex will snap it up. However every attempt to improve the graphics with this method has hit one of two problems, firstly the z-buffering issue (the graphics processor deciding which parts of a model appears in front or on top of another part of the model) is not professional enough to be used as a commercial product and/or the amount of processing power needed to be used requires a super high end PC.
---
From a commercial point of view, I cannot see this being a massive driver in new players coming in, or a great improvement in retention (although I am sure there are some people who will come back or continue playing because of an update like this). So from a cost point of view, I cannot see this happening unless a technological solution is viable.
---
Of course, this may have changed since.
---
Unlucky dude. You will be feeling horrible right now, but you can rebuild, and enjoy the rebuild too. Thanks for sharing the story to help other people.
---
Yeh but using any rnage weapon on defensive reduces dps drastically so you are wrong there
---
At least you get it. I commented about how the new players coming from mobile have terrible retention, and I got people telling me I'm wrong because they started on mobile and still play. Well no shit if you're subbed here you probably play and enjoy the game. That doesn't make you the majority.
---
Earth warriors, assigned by vanakka at a low level like 50cb and only found in the wilderness part of edge dungeon, got it a couple times on my alt though didn't mind as i knew what i was doing. But it stands that aside from wildy slayer there are tasks solely done in the wild and at such a low level a skip may not be available, i got them at a point when i couldn't skip so i know it's a possibility.
---
Alchemy yo ass
---
&gt; **These players went into the wilderness with 3 items as they KNOW how it works**. Attacking a player and then getting killed because of it isn't abusing or **deceiving but deliberately logging in to get them to skull on you IS**.  
---
They clearly do not know about hiding attack options if it was due to him logging in under them. They made a mistake and they can learn from it.  
---
&gt;The problem here is that if it is not addressed soon everyone that views that video will think its fine to do.  
---
It is fine to do, it is also easily preventable by hiding attack options.
---
This is terrifying, if true. I wonder if this is an old bug, that's just sat undiscovered for 2 decades? Insane.
---
You can also avoid gold doublers by not clicking accept so therefore that’s not a scam
---

if you look at average player stats then I highly doubt that "vast majority of players are addicted" lmao

almost the entire "cutenoobs" sub is just people posting pics of high levelled characters and non-noobs as a thinly veiled attempt to humblebrag about how much of a virgin they are lol
---
I guess we can agree to disagree.
---
For me grandmaster quests have to fit a thematic purpose at the peak. 90+ stats and lore connected. Im against arbitrary requirements that do not fit the quest only for the sake of excluding a part of the community.
---
Im very skeptical towards your approach. Excluding someone for the sole reason of their PK build seems a bit immature to me. I hope Jagex continues with their thematic quest approach rather than quest approaches that specifically excludes a part of the community.
---
This is very true! Doesn't make me feel any better though ;)
---
Upvoted!

If you fail your shortcuts I feel bad for you son,

I got 99 agility and... I still fail wtf

They barely have a team of people working on the game, there's a big difference between grinding for a main and grinding multiple accounts for different builds you want

---
I suppose in a way it is, but it really is a bit like QBD from RS3 and to be fair, the droptable is like it as well apart from the uniques.
---
I'm a geology student and it was quite funny to hear how these formed.
---
&gt;I don't understand what your argument is outside of, get scammed then learn from it.  
---
Okay, let me break down why I think you don't understand it.
---
&gt;Citing a 3rd party website that everyone should be aware of is not feasible.  
---
Firstly I did not state **everyone should be aware** of a 3rd party website, so you are misinterpreting what is written. Secondly you should re-read what I said within that context.  
---
&gt;So we either experience it, make a mistake and have an opportunity to learn why it happened - **or** we get educated by other people, **or** by a resource, like the warning when entering the wilderness which states you shouldn't bring ANYTHING that you aren't prepared to lose, **or** the wikipedia that gives detailed explanations of the wilderness mechanics and how player attack options can be disabled.   
---
I have put the **or**'s in bold to help indicate the separations between the opportunities for the players to learn from, if you choose to focus on one of them whilst ignoring the others and adding your own speculation..  
---
&gt;everyone should be aware of  
---
..then it's going to be very hard for you to understand the other points.  
---
The wikipedia is an option, if they are aware of the concept of googling to find out answers to questions, which is a great resource for learning about anything in life - it is not required, it is an option.  
---
&gt;The problem is these people are going into the wilderness taking 3 items and then being deceived to skull.  
---
That's not what deceived means. To be deceived it means to cause someone to believe something untrue, usually with an ulterior motive in mind. The sign warns them when entering the wilderness that they should not bring ANY items they are not expected to lose.  
---
Your points would be true if Torvesta said to them, "attack me, even if you skull you will keep your 3 items!!"  
---
That's one way to learn from being scammed, the other three options are written in the paragraph above, separated by the **or**'s in bold. If you have a solution to implement a way to educate players of every mechanic, every possible scam and every way to avoid them without giving into greed and believing people when they get socially manipulated, then share it with me.  
---
..but one issue is that I am explaining this to you in as much detail as possible, but you aren't understanding me. Do you think that even if you found a way to explain everything in great detail to every player, that they still might not understand? I know you have good intentions, as do I, but you need to understand it from a different perspective to see that your approach is not going to benefit anyone.
---
The real questions is how hard will the new FFXIV expqc hit OSRS.
---
Looks awful.
---
Soft glass? Or boro? Either way beautiful work!
---
It already exists lol... look it up dummy
---
Get jesus to play 1st base
---
Use combat pots if you aren't already, rock cake and absorb instead of praying. Your xp will increase as your stats do, right now 40k might be as good as you can get. 
---
The gear you should be using is full obsidian with a berserker neck and obby sword, obby shield until you can get dragon defender.
---
I'm sure they're open to suggestions if you have any. Happy cake day btw
---
Before you level each 99 after your first, just before you level you can drop the cape, gain that level then telegrab the cape and it stays untrimmed.

The formula never changes, so it just depends on the accuracy you're looking for

Just because it sounds reproducible doesn't mean a random outside spectator can tell you how to reproduce it. The fact that there's apparently people walking around abusing it should be proof enough that it is reproducible somehow.

Has the favour system changed so that you can now gain favour in all houses at the same time? I. E. 20% in all of them or do you still have to get to 100% and then lock?

Ahh cool, gotcha

This is the PRIME example of a non-reproduceable bug that you hear about all the time from users. 
---
"My computer did *thing that isnt actually possible* HELP PLEASE"
---
"What did you do to cause this?"
---
"I dont know its the computer's fault"
---
The fact you are siding with the user in this case despite this being at best a rare and difficult to reproduce bug shows me you have no actual experience working as a coder. 
---
Dont worry, your sophomore and junior year weed out classes will straighten you out quick :')

Ok

title is clickbait.

most skulltricks are obvious (clan logs in and one guy says "box me bro) or in worst cases the people skull up themselves

Now if only Jagex would add a Korea/Japan server. :( My connection is fine in Japan, but I'm in Korea for a while and I can barely stay connected I want to die.

vanilla was garbage, so probably not.

do yourself a favor and play an actually good expansion like wotlk. almost everything in vanilla was so god awful. pretty sure most people won't even reach level 20-30 in vanilla LMFAO.

This is an unpopular opinion and probably very untrue. I’m sure many people would restart for this feature.

Sorry for any bamboozlement, it's not a gif, my mate sent me a screencap of what I assume was a gif to begin with, and I immediately thought it looked like a Christmas elf so I found a pic and edited the colours to match their armour

It's changed. You don't have to lock it anymore.
---
If someone made a fresh account claiming to be zezima, are you gonna believe them without any proof?
---
Sorry haha once I got the thought in my head that it looked like a Christmas elf, I couldn't un-see it lol I had to do an edit of an actual Christmas elf with the right colours

Thanks!

Even before the GE was added to OSRS, most people did their trading using other websites so it was basically like having the GE but with more steps
---
Changing your password and cancel the request to deactivate your authenticator. Then inform Jagex someone has falsely recovered your account and see what they say. EVEN IF they don't do anythinf to help you, you will never be hacked if you just quickly check every day to see if your authenticator is pending to be cancelled again.
---
It's a bandage on a wound that if kept on, will never make you bleed out, even if the medics (Jagex) refuse to help you.
---
I want this, I would buy the attack one
---
Better than any PVP suggestions I've seen coming from Jagex, would love to see all of this
---
No, its great. I play for like 30-60 minutes a day
---
If your goal is points I’d first recommend doing Hard instead of Normal.
---
Overloads &amp; Absorbs will be more useful and cheaper than PPots.
---
Lastly, Dream Mentor &amp; Desert Treasure bosses add a HUGE multiplier to the points you’ll be getting.

Nah endorphins

I did the same thing but used the regular antifire shield instead of dfs and was fine!

Teaks somewhere where you don’t have to move will be faster xp. But banking them will definitely slow your xp down a lot.

Happened to me as well a few days back. Only difference is when the trade got accepted I got DC’ed. But also I checked the trade window and all the money was there but after the second accept I didn’t receive any money.

Agreed.

Now I can become trans and tell people that ITS MA'AM

I don't know man, im not support. I work in a team with other engineers. The product owner deals with end users.
---
Vorkath is a bit less click intensive and more GP/hr but higher stat requirements and gear requirements. (Elite Void, Salve ei, Archer’s Ring &amp; BP + BGS or Dragon Hunter Crossbow)  
---
I’d say Zulrah is a bit easier to access in terms of gear/stat requirements but is harder to learn due to memorizing 4 different phases.
---
Personally, I really like Zulrah if you aren’t playing a second account since it’s more engaging and seeing uniques every once in a while feels great. Vorkath is great if you want to afk on a second account though. Sometimes I can sneak in a few drops of fish while I sit there shooting away.
---
Similar boat. I grinded to 2k total just to have that achievement. Not I just do a farm run, couple bird house runs, and maybe train slayer when I'm watching streamers or movies.

"difficult to reproduce bug" does not equal no bug. You don't seem to know what you're talking about either my man.

I agree, and this guy may be lying but I feel like it's always better to investigate especially if the potential exploit is game breaking enough to make trading impossible, and has several people complaining about it in the past few days with none before that.

Props to u/el_oh_el_at_you for the suggestion.

Drew this one entirely on the PC with a fkin mouse. 4/10 probs wont reccomend. Really enjoyed drawing it, and hope you enjoy it too. This community is the best when it comes to motovation &lt;3

Printing, signing, gathering postal information, sending. It may not be a lot for one player but Jagex would have to print, sign and gather info of postal adress and send this information for about 4 players each day. Lets say this takes about 30 minutes. If this had been the case from day 1 Jagex would've spend 913 hours so far in sending/making this certicate in the past 5 years. Its simply not feasible for a company in long term to this.
---
You have it right. Except you can do this up to 4 times total using the axe spec 4 times with 4 axes.
---
With this, you get 3 hits every 5 ticks. 2 Dbow and 1 Dtaxe.
---
Interested, why Jagex is still shooting in their knee by not releasing it?
---
No one's upset lil guy. Just trying to see where all this satly dislike coming from. But I understand.. You never worked so you wouldn't get and you probably never got upvoted on a post you done. It's okay lil guy, you'll get to the top one day. Have blessed day/night.

Wait on second trade screen for a minute

Cannon. Every. Task. (that you can) it involves alot of neive/steve. Be careful about nechs, they give too much hp xp. Dont worry about cannonball prices, either because you make a net profit (my bank is sitting at 300~m and it paid for con and all my other buyable skills) getting the crafting for slayer rings is a huge boost in productivity to have teles to neive (tele option hold 1 key)

Find out what quests are hidden requirements for certain monsters, for example elemental workshop is a requirement to unlock wyvern tasks. I put a measly beginner quest off until I had my DHL. Theres probably.more im leaving out if you need specifics

I thought the people with names like #543534563 couldn't trade or type, so perhaps this is some sort of glitch at the moment where they are able to trade, but because they are picked up as not being a player, their side of the trade doesn't go through or something?
---
I fail to see how. They're slightly similar in the sense that they do multiple consecutive hits but that's about it. The spec's timing and mechanics are totally different.
---
Ah it must be nice to have these safe spaces where honest opinions literally get nuked so you don't have to see them.
---
It's shit, perspective is all off, shading doesn't make sense (where is the lightsource), style is that of a 12 year old (flat head on perspective), if that is plate armour along his arms and not bare arms that's unbelievable because getting into and out of that would suck a fat one, if that is a bare torso what are the cape pins sticking into?
---
All that said, the best thing about a creative artform is that you can learn if you listen and, with time and practice get better. Potential is marred by a lackadaisical mindset, especially in art. Try looking at reference material as you work, especially for things like heavy metal armours (how they're created to fit a user, where the light plays), watch live-action material for whatever you're working on to get a better understanding how, whatever it is, works in real life (especially great for things like armours) - I prefer bing images, as it's less censored for images than google and overall just better. (use safe search, as well... Almost any search, however innocent will lead to porn)

Couldn't agree more. I'm not going to stop playing my normal iron just because this came out. I have a group of 5 friends who all want to do this but even they are worried the others will burn out. It seems like they could have just put all this effort and time towards churning out more ironman-friendly content instead.
---
Got the slayer rings. Gona have my quest cape soon. I've been told that duradel is faster xp. I'm using npc contact to contact him instead of running to him or getting karamja gloves. By nechs giving too much xp you mean through bursting?
---
It's actually not though.  Think about it in terms of time to dev vs hours of play generated.  Most updates are like here is 2 - 200 hours of content per player.  This update is here's 4 years of content per player (that decides to play).  
---
Also creating things that not many people use but that are fun to watch on twitch (See hardcore ironman) is totally good for osrs, the streaming community has helped osrs grow and retain members very effectively.
---
Hi guys, I need to get to 53 Thieving from 41. Is the fruit stall method still viable since the changes to Hosidius or should I look at alternative methods? Thanks.
---
Group Ironman is even seen as a viable gamemode because of streaming potential. Other than that, dead gamemode.

Also, the man in the pink skirt is trying to get me to pay  for a sookage by the yew trees behind Varrock castle ...

Just rock cake down initially and then flick your rapid restore if you're not afk training. (I assume you're talking about remaining at 1 hp, not the actual time it takes to get down to 1? The difference is seconds lol) 
---
If you're trying to afk for 15 mins at a time just do a normal rumble and don't worry about being 1hp.
---
Lol?
---
No one cares about your bum ass

&gt; Replicating client side problem
---
Sorry but item exchange is a server side problem, or does the client directly interact with the osrs db?
---
&gt; based on biased hearsay
---
I already said this point is fair enough, if it's not real you can't reproduce it. I didn't think that needed to be said because that's obvious. Assuming OP is telling the truth it's not magic and you can try to reproduce it. 
---
&gt; So no, ACTUAL software engineers should be aware this is not actionable.
---
Mate you just posed the equivalent of calling editing the HTML on a live webpage with developer tools 'hacking' lmao.

I love when people try to crash me at kbd. I see a lot of pure accounts come in with BiS dhcb, pegs, etc. trying to crash me. But 99 range + rigour + slayer task wins out even with budget gear and rcb. They're just helping me out for a couple kills :)
---
Well i'm bored of my regular iron and main, not even playing the game atm. I would definitely play group ironman with my girlfriend, so thats 2 memberships already. I'm sure others are in the same boat, so if it makes money, its worth their time.
---
Y'know I hadn't thought about this but I think you're right. A group mode would necessarily require multiple people who roughly as actively as each other- how many people does the average user know that plays the game with them? It seems like, on this sub anyway, everyone plays almost solo, and close to no one has IRL friends who still play.
---
So yeah there would be a handful of clans or streamers that would play it for a bit, but the novelty would wear off soon for the huge majority of players.
---
Well to be fair, accepting a trade where the second trade window displays the correct amount of gp agreed upon, isn’t ‘the noobiest scams ever’. 
---
This ‘scam’ (more likely bug abuse) is probably the most forgivable to fall for, because if you aren’t very active on reddit, you’d never know this is happening.
---
And don't forget to whine about forced diversity on the internet
---
Yes bro same! The fuckin memes and vid format sucked me in. I started back in 05, quit after eoc and never even made an account back when it was 2007scape. I barely started back up in March and it's been a fucking blast.

I still miss my polypore staff though :/

As a hardcore WoW player myself (the only other mmorpg that I've ever gotten into), I can say something I love about osrs vs WoW is how OSRS never feels "beaten" There are SO many grinds and accomplishments in this game that there is always some goal to aim for.  You can kind of argue similar things for wow I suppose like mount farming etc etc, but for me once I've full cleared the raid it feels like it's over until the next one comes out. OSRS is literally the only game I can hop on solo and enjoy it. I can't stand solo player games and I never play any other mmos unless friends of mine are playing. OSRS just fills that void for me.

Honestly, I’m not a fan of the hd graphics. I understand that other people would like it and a toggle option would be fine with me but with what’s going on osrs right now I think we could focus on some more important updates before the team puts a lot of hours into making hd a thing. Seems like a waste of time imo.

I just want them to update some of the older parts of the map. Like look at the path fron Varrock to Morytania. Yikes.
---
Maybe I can help somebody actually having this problem even though it's a maymay:
---
- Stop after wave 60 or 61. 
---
- Take a break for about 15 minutes
---
- At the start of your break do a plank for about 15 seconds
---
- Then do some deep breathing exercises, in through your nose out through your mouth. 
---
- Hydrate yourself
---
- Before you come back do another 15 second plank
---
If you want to take a longer break or you're still anxious:
---
- Take a Warm shower (not hot or cold)
---
- Keep your hands and feet warm but make sure you're not sweaty or hot
---
- Make sure your core (chest) isn't hot
---
- Try and be in a room that's not too hot or cold
---
Then come back to it calm and relaxed. I'd also recommend correcting your posture as much as possible and maybe revising the fight once more.
---

Trust me, majority of the suggestions or even “popular” suggestion post/repost isn’t actually genuinely in the interest of the game. They are speaking about their wants and since it’s the internet, people can speak freely without being responsible for their words
---
Even if it is a bug, I don't get why people fall for stuff like this RIGHT NEXT TO THE GE. It just doesn't make sense.
---
The only way you can even come close to rates pre DS2 is if you spec transfer with alts and bulwark spec with a scythe.. the amount of effort you need to put in is significantly harder than it was before.

Nice for grinding KQ for desert elite
---
I think it is worth the time just to provide a game mode that promotes playing with others. We have raids and we have pking but for the every day runescape experience there is basically no motivation to work with others.
---
I agree it is a niche game mode that will probably die out pretty quickly but I Think its a worthy thing to pursuit.

I think it’s funny how you think the IN-GAME trade mechanic (because third party clients don’t influence or facilitate the direct trade function between players that has existed since RSClassic) is somehow a client side problem.

&gt; Are you kidding? If he had a fake version of runelite (for example) installed it could easily show that his opponent is trading 150m in the trade screen without there actually being anything there.

If OP has a fake version of runelite installed that could happen I guess. Then there's nothing they can do except fight off fakes. Has OP said he was using a tampered client?

I support Group Ironman mode but this is a very stupid argument lol. Jagex has had lots of big updates flop. In my opinion even Zeah is mostly a flop lol.

Even Fortnite lol

Ironman here.  I just got a medium clue that I need a blue dragonhide body for, so I’m starting a crafting grind 58-70.  I’ve decided to do jewelry and battlestaves for a good amount of it, and have a couple hundred gems banked.  Battlestaves will obviously be daily, but what’s the best way to get silver and gold bars?  I was thinking temple trekking (for silver) and maybe the crafting guild to Falador for gold.  I can also buy gold ore, but I’m pretty sure I’d be in the red if I chose to buy, and I need 1 more mining level for a quest requirement.
---
Maybe it's because we experienced these petty scams when we were younger, when the damage was like 10k and pretty detained. Makes you real wary and easily figure out odd situations. Is it stupid? Yes, but you can't blame peoplefor not having the same experiences I suppose.
---
I just noticed that as well

Thankfully, Mash is ecstatic.

Get fucking downvoted pleb lolol

In NMZ, Absorption potions work like a "secondary HP", which gets hit first.
---
You use a combination of Overloads (which drop you 50hp) and a Rock Cake/Locator Orb to go down to 1 HP. You then use the Absorps to tank the damage and the monsters hitting you can only do 1HP max each time.
---
Absorptions can stack infinitely (to max of 28 potion in your inventory), but it's best to only use a few at a time in case you DC or miss re-potting for Overloads (and take too much damage).
---
I think they have their accounts and just want to bypass the pin.
---
Farming works on a "lives" system. Everytime you pick one, you roll a % chance to consume a life. Once you're out of lives, the patch is fully harvested. So, technically there's no limit. Compost grants extra lives and magic secateurs decrease the chance you use up a life.
---

try void and blowpipe. the increased damage with void added to the blowpipe speed will increase you time to around 2minutes per kill if using bgs. withou i usually get 2:30-2:45
---
i dont get how he could get ddosed, what jagex shares your ip with other clients?
---
&gt;Well, they aren't doing the engine work for Group Ironman specifically; they are doing it for the benefit of the game.
---
Right, and if they do other smaller updates which require steps be taken in the direction of group ironman being possible, then I have no problem with group ironman eventually coming. Ash said they can now do different colored hitsplats cuz of an engine update and that is a step towards group ironman. I'm fine with that. What I'm not fine with is a direct and lengthy process of updates expressly for the purpose of group ironman.
---

Well thats how proof works mate. One random in the sea of a million liars is hardly cause for belief. Its also hard to believe because this scam would be so so so good if its how it appears. Like i would have expected 500 stories on reddit alone by now. I would be buy dhcbs for 500m each and getting 50 people per hour if this worked as claimed. Surely one person has shadowplay or gyazo or records.
---

I highly recommend using the Arceuus spellbook and teleporting to Barrows if you have the magic level. Use Barrows tabs if not
---
Do you mean swamp trident? I'm 78 mage now, should I just stick with ibans until I can comfortably afford a trident? Or is the difference big enough that I should get one now?
---
So the dozens of times I've been pked while clue hunting has been the same person? You understand the whole population is the problem right? It's not just one or two people doing it.
---
Good point, kinda kills my already poor theory.
---
It's just a much better situation than trading being completely broken and unsafe. I imagine that would be a difficult bug to track down.
---
There have been some other stories like this popping up, so maybe all hell is about to break loose.
---

I think the majority of ppl in third game excluding f2p has more than one acc because each acc has a different kind of game play to it so group ironman for them is a whole new journey they wanna try especially with friends or clan members. They want the challenge of a group beating other groups.
---
Actually the Facebook shop stole this from a Reddit post

The only reason to think this is if you don't have friends

no, i live in a nice city and i have plenty of friends who arent depressed and have plenty of future prospects. of course i know people that make negativity and depression their only personality traits but those are the guys we never invite out anymore. If you truly believe that everyone is depressed then maybe thats just your environment and you are willfully ignorant of the alternatives

I feel like it’s a bit of a stretch to consider TOB as truly soloable content as only a handful of players can execute that. I know you will rely “well people have solo’d it so it can be solo’d obviously” but locking a hoard of BIS gear behind content only the absolute top top players can solo, and then demanding a portion of your player base solo it is poor game design. Game developers don’t hold a bias against Ironman / pures like reddit does and won’t specifically stack the game against them.
---
I like these. Would be nice to if there was a variet of the hoodie.  Maybe with the Skilling icon being smaller and in the upper right(or left?) corner.  Kinda like those shirts with the pocket
---
nah i liked rc tbh especially nats
---
Imbue for autocast abilities haha
---
Yeah, my bet is it's a huge bug that people are exploiting. You can literally target wealthy players. Once they make enough money, they'll start stealing tbows.
---
IIRC there was one in the official RL release, but Jagex asked them to remove it. So if it's one that you're adding in, potentially detectable and surely bannable.
---
You  suggested an idea that makes no sense and wouldn't work.
---
You asked why it doesn't make sense, People then told you why it would not work and why it doesn't make sense. then you tell them "All I hear is excuses"
---
So are BH and Chill and other emblem selling CCs essentially dead?
---
Fucking hell it's a video game, chill the fuck out
---
Instanced bosses definitely do cater towards iron men. Bosses dropping load of Skilling mats help out ironmen a lot. Etc jagex isn’t going to tell you when they are thinking about ironmen in an update because that causes controversy.
---
But the opposite of that is true

82/83 is the end game for houses and is highly suggested (82 for Ornate Pool, 83 for Ornate Jewelry Box).
---
Only useful things before 82/83 is Altar, Mounted Glory, Portal Room (albeit less useful if you're going to make a portal nexus) and Repair Stand (Barrows). Other rooms either have minimal or 1 time uses.

---
I think attraction is influenced by a lot of factors, and not just personality, or the shirt you wear. 
---
I think we can all agree the hoodies above will likely not raise your level of attraction with the average girl.
---
I think you're on the wrong end of the stick. The people who are going to play this are in-game friends, cc buddies or IRL friends and it would be great fun. And it would also encourage more players to join the game. Many people who have played in the early days could now decide to all go at it once again, and people who are currently playing might invite their old friends to play group ironman together.
---
I see great potential and lot's of banter and fun in this gamemode. Also, early-game ''me and the boys'' memes incoming.
---
The difference probably won't be that noticeable to be honest. When you use a trident, you're paying more to have faster runs. This generally means that you'll on average use less prayer pot doses as well as get loot faster.   
---
I personally preferred to use Iban's until I hit 80.
---
Maybe if you smuggled your mum some karamja rum every once in awhile things might turn up.
---
It's already happening unofficially, though. One with LinksOcarina and Rargh, and another similar one as 5 boys 5 bil. There's only a slight difference in that they could be cheating.
---
A lot of good content comes out of people limiting themselves without Jagex's intervention.
---
Is blowpipe that much better? I have one just didnt realize it would speed up kills that much. And do you use addy darts or is the cost worth rune/dragon? And thanks for the response
---
I unironically rock gbody, dlegs, obby shield, dlong, rune boots and a glory. fite me.
---
Do you have a job? If not then get one. If you do then work more hours and get the hell out of that environment, live with a roommate, coworker, or gf and help pay the rent. Not trying to be offensive I genuinely mean well with this comment

I did a customer support thing on reddit in a new thread last week, the guy couldn't choose a display name so I asked for a screencap and it showed that he didn't press the 'enter' key to move the name into the box, it kinda surprised me but it doesn't tell you to press 'enter' before setting the name or looking up the name so anyone who hasn't experienced that type of concept before might get stuck, anyway I feel part of the team now. :\^)

if you skip low xp tasks it doesn't make a difference. arguably, the xp rates of slayer can only go up because people who want xp will always skip new low xp tasks and do new high xp tasks.

But he said the same thing as this, they completed the trade and the money wasn't in his inventory. It was after that that he was logged out.

Ironman made me come back and I'm about to hit 2k total and I am still enjoying every single bit of it.
---
How amazing would it be to team up with some friends and play this mode, made for real goals and accomplishments, together, and not just compare these goals by sending screenshots and flexing in game but actually share all of this and go through the experience together.
---
Idk, rambling on a bit rn, but I would love to be self sufficient and reach all these goals with some friends together.
---
Isn’t that the point of Ironman though? You need to go obtain shit yourself instead of buying it on the GE?

I dont hate pures, or pkers at all for that matter really. What i hate it the hate towards ironmen and then thinking changes like this arent catering to someone else. All i wanted to point out is that ironmen arent the only ones catered to.

I actually wouldn't doubt it. Some people are scary dedicated to the merch, like the Thammaron Scepter guy who posts in every Q&amp;A thread.
---
Im half black so I can wear strength. Where you're white privilege NOW REDDIT
---
A potential update to the dark bow, I can get behind that!
---
Fucking no idea what this means
---
you're so cute :)
---
Yep, you'd keep the recurring sub. You will keep your current price as long as your membership doesn't lapse for a certain period (I think it's 14 days).
---
Who tf actually wears these? Sweaty af having runescape hoodies irl...
---
Lack of interesting examine text is why I don't go to Zeah

Free teleports to any house portal. Convenience of always having access to occult altar, ornate pool, and essentially every teleport system in the game without having to switch worlds.

Thanks for being the test subject!

Its actually really fun, one of my favourite things to do at the moment, but by god do I not know what im doing

Thise control rods jumping up and down was insane

Group Ironman = normal ironman with alts
---
Lmao look at all my downvotes from neckbeards that didnt read your username 😂😂
---
I've upboated both of your comments!
---
Excellent, thanks for the quick and helpful response! :)
---
That was actually exactly what I was going for ;)
---
Hopefully that one isn’t vaccinated 😈
---
I3 is a weird way to spell dwm
---
I just don't want instance bosses.
---
Who would wear these in public?
---
The skill specs rage clips and the killshot noises he uses.
---
Make me laugh every time.
---
Bosses dropping loads of skilling mats was more to devalue easily bottable activities (WCing, flax picking etc)
---
No technically it's 10.  Unless you purchase a T1 you need to kill someone for a T1 then kill 9 more people for a T10.
---
I don't think there's much use speculating what actually happened to get the trade, fact is that **TWO** of these cases have popped up within the past week, both being strikingly similar and both ending with the same result. 
---
This could very well mean there is a major trade bug discovered and only now are scammers starting to use it more and more stupidly. 
---
As a note, Runescape's major game-breaking bugs are discovered by exploiting groups and kept under tight wraps,  if there's anything that this past week has told me it's that the exploiters got sloppy/greedy or that the info to do the exploit got leaked to other players who aren't that smart in using it.

Reminds me of Chessy018 “merch cc” back pre-EOC.

The scent of Bullshit is strong here.
---
Yeah I tried it made me feel like ass
---
youre absolutely clueless about this sort of thing dude. to have 10k certificates made up - even relatively nice looking ones - isnt gonna be more than $1/ea. shipping is about the same, its not like they need next day delivery.
---
even on the high end, youre look at 30, made 40 thousand. nowhere near 150k lmao. of course this is in USD, even cheaper if youre talking pound sterling.

&gt;Group Ironman mode is only going to be played by the hardcore minority that plays 8-14 hours a day
---
Well that's bullshit. My irl mates are really interested in doing a group iron man mode, and only 1 of them even plays osrs, and even he only plays for a few hours a day mostly doing afk stuff.
---
Clue scrolls are about the journey, not the destination.
---
Ah fair. I dont mind a couple, but its getting silly now, and especially as someone whos favourite thing is duo/group bossing its pretty disappointing
---
Ugh so annoying
---
Umm.. it's just an ongoing meme because reddit is jagex's "customer support" and they only pay attention to ones that get a certain number of upvotes... but... nice.
---
Sure, but the more tasks you add the more you have to skip. Therefore losing points. It’s currently impossible to maintain like it was pre DS2
---
If they post information about a bug, it is likely more people will try to abuse it. It is better from Jagexs' perspective simply to say they fixed the bug and not elaborate on details due to similar exploitation possibilities.
---
they're lunar dollars

Quest cape, farm and slayer and runecraftingare dope

You already have so many options for gaining the extra points that are needed now, look into barraging abyssals, velds or tzhaar.

The highest maintainable rate is as high as ever, we dont need any more slayer buffs.

Whatever you're on, I want some.

Can you fight him in NMZ after that quest?

Stop trying to maintain the purity of a fucking gaming community you absolute weirdo.
---
My name does happen to be HeyZeus
---
So let me go over what you're saying and see if im understanding correctly. You "cant wait" for group IM mode to be added because you think it would be very fun and a great addition to the game. A mode where all the "fun" comes from having to get your own supplies and equipment, and then you say you cant just run it with friends on normal accounts because you would instantly cheat by transferring gear and supplies from other accounts.
---
Well gee... Maybe this super awesome mode isn't all that fun? Or maybe its not actually something you would find interesting. Either way i dont think its worth the engine dev time when theres other things that could be done instead.
---
Except I'm 10 def, my food heals only 16, and Verac hits up to 23 without protection prayers. I was at 12hp when he died then I ate back up because the skeleton was attacking me 😂

Streamers only play Ironman and that’s what they think is popular and what people want updated
---
Why buy gf when you can become gf

I think it also opens up more opportunities for lurers and unsuspecting noobs getting lured. I'd vote yes to like a level 50 agi shortcut there.

Why did you blur your skills out lol

No problem bud, you asked 🤷‍♂️

Hmm new bis weapon pre-whip for ironmen it looks like. I like it.
---
Uppa hoods!
---
Thank you friend!
---
The average player cant/won’t ever do the all the content that is already in the game. Having dev time allotted for group ironman won’t hurt the average player at all.
---
And if you were wondering, this is what irony is.
---
You know I have always seen everyone doing it I just felt obligated to do it on my first 2007scape post. :p
---
Thank you kind sir! Im endlessly searching!

I didn't ask. I was skeptical of RuneScape applying these
---
Thank you(:

Gamer bucket not in sight, 4/10

Stunning and brave

Since it's a "middle" level boss, maybe add the robes from the Undead Mage as a very rare drop too? (for zerkers). They could have the same offensive stats as infinity robes but have the defensive stats of Lunar robes (lunar robes req 40 def). Require 45 defence and 65 Magic to wear, and let it have a set effect of like 20-30% more dmg and accuracy on undead monster?
---
What'd ya fall for?

How do people even sit down while wearing jeans? Most uncomfortable pants ever.

You should probably buy a rune pouch using Tier 1s rather than a tier 10.

That’s actually just a marketing technique. Basically your experience earning capabilities go down from 100% until eventually you reach 0%. They say it’s to combat video game addiction (which is an actual problem) but you can just pay a dollar or two and your experience rates go back to normal. It’s a scummy tactic that plays off the country’s video game addiction to profit more from video games.
---
I got my dagger from a rich guy quitting lol and my bandos is from Slayer/Wc/Fletch, also I made around 10-12M doing WT from like 50ish to 99 fm .

Jagex has proved to us before they don't either in some aspects. Removing polling would be removing a huge aspect of what makes Osrs, Osrs

I think GIM is just a by-product of the huge clan reworks they're working on (something something engine work). 
---
Granted, making GIM still takes *some* dev time, but we're getting something much bigger and better with the new clan rework.
---
make the wandering woodworker a headless zombie like the dude from Frankenstein castle
---
Exactly, that's why I asked him to release an update that they fixed it but that I wasn't expecting any details about how the bug was performed...
---
If that works for you that's great and you should continue to use that method, but I've found that getting ahead of one's self and overthinking during the switches is usually what does people in. Potentially tripling the amount of clicks one does per switch leaves a lot more room for error, Imo.

Until your ironman gets hacked.

basically went lucky to average on the easy scrolls, and most tedious ones I went the most dry on.
---
Block the slayer monsters with the highest task weight. It's important that you block Wyrms and Drakes especially if you want to get Hydras. They have the highest task weights of 10 for Konar's table.
---
Fair enough. Continue
---
Okay
---
Or b gloves
---
Yeah and I’ve watched a couple of them too. They’re entertaining :)
---
The place where you are killing mobs can often have several other players doing their thing, too. People running around killing things, leaving shit on the ground can make looting very confusing (I've experienced this before ironman became official). 
---
This is mostly what I was talking about. And yes, picking someone else's bone drop can indeed ruin the experience.

I always preferred fishing when I was f2p.

I believe so not at home, its static red I cant change the colors of the keys

Boo was hoping you had some crazy secret I could use to get rich quick. Back to the drawing board
---
Holy shit. Reminds me of multiboxing eve online.
---
Some constructive criticism: you really need to stop playing so legato, and stop using the pedal so heavily. A sea shanty is supposed to be bouncy, not smooth. Pay particular attention to when you release each note, and be pretty strict about it. You actually started the tune doing this (the beginning flue solo part), but then stopped once the bass part joined in. Just do what you did in the beginning for the entire piece and you'll have it.
---
Other than that, nice aqpw.
---
Only if talking to him triggers a Mini-quest in which you have to retrieve it called "Giving Head"
---
Just put the server in South Korea or Japan or something then.
---
Are you implying that the fact that runelite removed a plugin after Jagex requested them to do so makes runelite a cheat client?
---
He only Said he pressad accept not that he completed the trade
---
My friends literally are gonna start playing again with me for the opportunity to make a group Ironman together, this is just wrong.
---
Wisdom
---
&gt;Farming (timers) overhaul comes to mind and few others. But a large scale code base rewrite is not planned (publicly).
---
/u/wannabeisraeli is talking specifically about rewriting the client code base. Very obviously they're not going to start rewriting the game engine in a different language. 
---
Rewriting the client is very doable. Rs3 even drafted a full rewrite of the client in html5, but it was scratched.
---
At first I thought this was a shitpost and you were referring to the stray dog in front of you being your first pet. Then I saw raccoon. Gz!
---
dont forget your CB bracelet!!
---
I, too, was today years old when I figured that out all on my own.
---
zulrah at 1def is way scary my friend
---
I have three problems with it:
---
1. It was hypothesized when some of the gathering grinds were so aids that you wanted to have a team to help spread the pain. These have largely been fixed already with sand mining, contract farming, etc.
---
2.  The game mode is literally just an easier Ironman mode. Content creators already reach endgame on their normal ironmen accounts in 4-5 months.  This only speeds it up. 
---
3. The endgame is usually pretty standard with or without being in a group.  You grind raids (which is doable in a group just without sharing potions or rewards), you grind bosses (the majority are most efficient solo anyway), and you grind 99s (no skilling methods benefit from group mode anymore).
---
4. It's going to just be abused by efficiency scrapers. Not that this is something to even avoid, but many rank hunters are just going to "group up" with 3 alts that they use to make cannonballs, gather food and resources, etc.
---
I mean it’s honestly whatever toots your horn. I’ve never been interested in pking or dmm so I’ve never really bothered to watch either. If you don’t care for group ♿️ content you don’t gotta watch it lol
---
Instead of sound for an action, like fishing net cast, be able toggle a soft vibration. Instead of a chopping noise on wood, a soft vibration. Hmmm perfect for afk watching tv on the couch.
---
My friends and I would do it. My friends who don't play osrs said they might actually start if we do group Ironman. I reaaallly want the game mode lol it sounds so cool! Like you're part of a small village or something and everyone has a role
---
Petition to make 3,000 coins from every transaction go to changing your account to the opposite gender. 
---
Pros - GP sink, fits with new lore, and makes the game harder for new players with 3,000 gp minimum
---
Cons - devalues my gender fluid Ironman
---
And then everyone will ask you if its a Harry Potter sweater.
---
Why? I like understanding why things work, instead of just Y/N. If you don't give a shit, you're free to ignore any info you don't care about.
---
This reminds me of a video I watched of a guy checking the loot from 125 lucky imps. The last item received? None other than a rune crossbow.
---
Nope unfortunately I do not , look at my stats lol , but yeah this is all I’ve got unfortunately and like 6-7M rn , blew a decent amount of money going 60-70 herb and construction and 70-81 pray
---
I am not hating at all but like, you dont have 10 dollars to just buy a membership? The ingame GP is much more valuable when you have a limited amount..
---
do I have to be the one to tell you that I'm far too fucking STUPID to remember where something was on wave 3
---
(cool tip actually didn't know, will look into)
---
The main game had a South Korean server which was apparently closed due to it costing them too much. Thats why I mentioned India. Perhaps its a cheaper alternative. Regardless I would actually like them to look at other asian countries and see what is suitable for them.
---
Its sad how there isn't even one asian server and that is what most of us are asking for, just give us one asian servers so we can play on low ping too.

---
Thank you. Not much of a PVE guy I guess so far, cause I’ve never had a powerful account.
---
No, I dont think that. Clearly you take things very literally so I will explain. Obviously there isnt an infinite amount of gp. When a player has only 1 mil, and it seems to have taken them awhile to make that 1 mil, it will take much longer for that player to earn gp than say a player who has billions. What this means is that a player who has billions can afford to just throw away 3 mil cause there are many ways for that player to make it back fairly quickly. When a player has only a 3.5 million for a bond and spends it all to have membership for 14 days, then was it really worth it? Most membership activities require money to make it back, so I'm not sure saving up as a low level player is really worth it. Does that break it down for you my guy?
---
I love that this is a joke.
---
Just so everyone knows I dont bot I was curious how many clients I could open and have full vision of
---
You’re right! I guess I just needed someone super smart like you to explain it.
---
Probably going to at least start Desert Treasure today. I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish it today. I likely won't even use ancients too much for a while but it'll be nice to just have it available when I do need it.

Yea let’s add servers to legitimize Asian gold farms so they can compete with the venezulans
---
Why's that?
---
&gt;Group Ironman mode is only going to be played by the hardcore minority that plays 8-14 hours a day.
---
no
---
&gt;The average player isn’t going to abandon their regular iron account

also no
---
&gt;it’ll be short lived until their teammates lose interest or bail
---
only thing in this post that makes a little sense

It says it's 80x40 cm.

Yeah, I like slayer sometimes, but other times I don't. Still trying to learn how to love slayer and find the tasks I actually love doing. Just going so slow now D:
---
I'm like 45m down in a long term merch I'm doing right now. Praying to my God Ash statue every day for a price rise
---
Gotta flip stuff that has a use. 
---
I flip BiS items and make 100-300M a day.  Never lose money.
---
People can already play group ironmen. Just make new accounts and set your own rules. People did that with ironman mode, they can do it with group ironman too.
---
Hey, if you don't want the extra, I'll take it.
---
Lol clearly you did otherwise you wouldn't have replied I guess. Using the word limited seems to be commonly understood so I was very surprised to see your question. I am happy to explain remedial concepts to ignorant people, just helps the work day go by faster :). Have a nice day.
---
thanks man, ill check some guides out on em (:
---
Doesn't work on my phone :/
---
Definitely, but definitely not /r/stocks, that's for sure.
---
Thanks! Wanna meet up in game? Just gimme your username and pw and I’ll bring you into my house for you to login to.
---
Some tasks are shit and boring. To be honest, some bosses are the only reason why slayer are fun. Go out of the box and learn to do bosses. High risk high reward. 
---
If you become stagnant then the game gets boring because you can never improve
---
I'll just never fucking understand this mentality, you say you want to do something, hell you say you really want to do something, but you only want to do it if you can show it off to other people, cause that's literally the only difference between their being a sanctioned mode and you just doing it yourself. 
---
Like, if that's the case I get it, but it's mechanically identical if you just do it with mains, and if you truly are interested in the concept and think it would be fun you'd just do it.
---
The world would be better off without a child groomer though.
---
Maybe yall need better Internet, 200-300 ping is not bad at all. For shits and gigs I tried an Aussie world the other day which had 270ish ping and didn't notice a single difference, PVMed and PKed like on a 50 ping.
---
Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but stealing creation and fist of guthix aren’t in the game, are they?
---
You have to juggle the clues, you wont get a clue drop if you have one in your inventory.
---
Yeah and the Facebook shop ripped them off from a redditor
---
Oh I specifically was suggesting it for pvp, currently you can hit 47-47 with a dds using only 25%spec and a 49-49 Gmaul both of which have no delay between hits unlike dbow. It made sense in the past when void was much stronger. But now I don't see a reason why dbow is the only weapon with a damage cap in pvp
---
harmonys record just above it is also just 30 hours of gameplay done after konar and ds2 release, he profited points from both that and the #1 slayer week record he did after his day

Why is it about women being the center of your life man. Stop putting the pussy on the pedestal.

How is it tiny? Isnt the asian gaming market primarily mobile at this point? At least in China? OSRS is easily the best mobile game.

Great reply, ty

See, I just prayed mage and waited to see if he stomped, then flick range and back to mage. Almost completely the same, almost completely opposite lol

Probably because even though he was right about how to minimize the rng he's still wrong saying that there's no luck to it.
---
To be fair we do play osrs
---
Runelite tile marker
---
I might be alone in this but.. Since I seen jagex talk about the potential release of the mode, I've lost a lot of the drive to play knowing the modes coming eventually and the ironman account i have now gets so dull when it becomes this midgame grind fest. New accounts are so fun to play and can even imagine with friends even funner
---
No Runescape for a week? How would you survive?
---
I think you’re wrong about that there’s tons of pures who play that as their main account and do things besides pk
---
I'm agreeing with you at the absurdity of it, friend.
---
Holy shit that dude got me for like 30m recently. Tried to help someone who I thought was in the same boat as me. And now I'm broke again :(
---
Realistically I had thoughts of doing just f2p things like mining or woodcutting for mats for my main no botting here just peak efficiency I figure I can get almost 2k mats an hour
---
So nobody will ever attack me unless I set up a fight on discord, right?
---
Can't get passed the weird hand
---
I think seercull and t hammers could use some love.  Wouldn't bad mad in the slightest if some people made bils over it, who cares.  It wouldn't add any gold into the game anyways.
---
Nah he can be a rune pure or piety pure (med lvl) or range tank. He's just fucked if he wanted to be a zerk or pure
---
Are you claiming we’re leaking because of the title? Crabs, a meme across most of Reddit that started not on our sub? Hella funny leak man. Thanks for sharing. I totally loled
---
How could anyone wear them in public
---
Well unless your level 112+ or have some sort of risk other than mystics, also I highly reccommend joining a clan. There's plenty to choose from in the DMM discord, want me to link it to you in messages?
---
Damn. This is crazy if true, hope Jagex looks into it
---
You're right centaur. An example would be crystals at olm. On a higher ping its so easy to miss a tick. Like I see the crystals on the floor, click away and still get rekt cause I missed the tick for it to register if you get what I mean. Honestly if you have done pvm on a higher ping, you know how bad it is.
---
So I went on a well know gold selling website and at their current rates $10m would get you 14.286T gp
---
Is their that much gp in the game?
---
Your problem is that you won't adapt to the changing meta. You can still easy get old slayer rates without scythe or spec transfer, you just have to do tasks like tzhaar/abby/veld barraging. The slayer meta has always been changing and whining that you can't hit the old rate without changing your task list is fruitless. Also slayer rates have never been higher. Ehp should probably be 100-105k now.
---
Those games arent rigged
---
&gt;Im half black so I can wear ~~strength~~.

Thieving
---
Fellow Indian here, would kill for Asian servers, hopefully something like Singapore.
---
Yeah I always do if I'm on discord with people I don't know very well.  If its in the ffa world I usually don't type to anyone because I'm usually talking to people irl or on discord, but it's the ffa world.  I'd hope everyone there assumes its ffa and have had 0 problems so far.
---
Does it really take that much dev work? I don't know much about coding but making accounts assignable to a group and being able to trade doesn't sound that difficult. Not easy, but not crazy hard.
---
Oh sweet sweet child. 
---
Do ANYTHING else for money. Lol

1. The email compromised was was not the current email linked to the osrs account, it was a past email that got hacked and the guy lost.

---
Lol you've pissed off all the depressed people here who don't like to hear that they can actually do something about it, such as getting off of RS &amp; Reddit and spending some time doing something more productive.
---
his friend's username is in the image as well as a bot which is spamming in the chat, that's the world located, narrowing down a specific account that gained 7k thieving xp in that world at that time isn't rocket science
---
They should also add in a plug in that immediately gives you maxed skills and a max cash stack, and we'll I mean if you don't like then simply don't use it.
---
I’ve been watching LinksOcarina and Rargh’s new duo-Ironmen series lately. I think they’re only 3-4 episodes in but it’s been a lot of fun to watch. Their PVP challenge series is great too, if you’re not familiar with them.
---
Also something worth mentioning, Skilling is profitable aswell, fishing for example. Anglerfish go for 4k ea and with the 1:1.5 swap rates that's approximately 7k osrs per fish
---
Or even runecrafting make 108 bloods per inventory and sell that inventory for 50k or 85k osrs
---
This is why i would be 100% for artisan if it is how ive read it to be. Correct me if im wrong but it was polled as: Npc tells you how much of something to do for skills just as slayer is for combat. Example go chop me 500 maple logs, go mine me 250 coal etc and get big xp drops at the end as well
---
They r worth 1k ea u can turn them back to coins by using it on a bank
---
Well if it had no cap maybe uses would pop up!
---
To be honest, i think stuff like this should be allowed. 
---
First reason -  all these plugins are available to everyone with no additional charge
---
Second reason - its still manually clicking (auto clicking should be bannable)
---
Third reason - it saves your hands!
---
Stay away from hard drugs guys.
---
Japan have beef with Korea, excusable, no?
---
Somewhat agree, but I can't help but see that the whole point of ironman is getting things yourself and doing them alone, otherwise you'd be able to do bosses with other players and get the drop if you did the most damage.  It would be cool if there was a type of ironman that could do all activities - even participate in mass events, just not trade.  But I think it does somewhat devalue the game mode for people who set out to get everything by themselves.
---
D bow can launch its spec from really, really far away giving you generally less time to react. With DDS/Gmaul you have to be in melee range so it's much harder to pop out of a safe zone for a moment and 1 hit someone.
---
Am i the only one getting the Battlefront II quote as the title? if so FeelsBadMan

You can show where the aggro reset border is if you turn on the runelite npc agression timer.

If you wanna know more how it works watch the first 80 seconds of [this video](https://youtu.be/nA734SmJd5Y) where it's explained

what are you laughing at bro? rwt is not a laughing matter kid...rwt helps fund bin laden u idiot kid bet u dont evan have a 10 million coin bank (i have 1.2b just so u know)? What does "Make America Great Again" mean? Some people think this means getting rid of gay rights, bringing back segregation, taking away women's voting rights, ect. How about none of these things? Maybe getting rid of Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instragram, ect. would be a catalyst for making America great again. Working class adults were able to function just fine without social media in the past. If we are less distracted, we have more time to focus on the economy and improving America. Social media is not a part of our every day lives. We don't have an urge to 'check in' every 5 minutes or check on everyone else's status. We don’t give two shits about if you like our post or not. Social media is a rolodex to us.

I was kind of hoping for a heartwarming story of you two becoming good friends from it lmao.

You can safe spot it with range or magic. What is your range/magic level?

The group mechanic isn't just for ironmen though, its for clans and all sorts.

Y'all remember when jed was hacking accounts and ppl would just bash on these kind of posts because ppl thought they were made up? How about we give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for a jmod (hopefully) to respond
---
No u
---
this belongs on WSB my guy
---
I’m not a smart man
---
Now I’m worried because this almost happened to me.
---
Pestilent added me and told me to come help him because someone was trying to telegrab lure him on a pvp world at pest control.
---
He had me log in under where the guy was dropping the items to try and snag them, then once I got them, he told me to hop worlds and meet him at the GE.
---
Thankfully I’m just starting a rebuild so I yoinked the 140m instead like the greedy fuck I am. And cause I was still suspicious I was being scammed.
---
You do realize I don't know who the hell you are so why would I intrinsically know a single thing about you or what you've done or do?
---
I can't see anything reviving the player base tbf. It's a niche game mode that will only appeal to a small part of the OSRS player base.
---
It's almost like it's own game within a game if that makes sense? So it doesn't really get advertised for the game mode that it is, and it will only get seen by the already existing OSRS playerbase. The problem with that is the vast majority of players prefer PvM so already a PvP oriented mode isn't going to appeal to a large chunk of said playerbase.
---
I enjoy PvP but to me this server seems like it would only be any fun at max level. Anytime before that you're going to have a huge disadvantage to any of the veteran players. Honestly, the only thing that's tempted me to play it is the opportunity to make gp for 07.
---
I love watching Jarvis' videos. He sprinkles in some low key Runescape memes in a lot of his episodes.
---
Seeing as some people are disconnecting, I'm starting to think this has to do with network packet spoofing.
---
Unless you're a kid with no way to make money and literally nothing better to do with your time, do yourself a favor and just buy the membership. It's an hour of minimum wage work vs 40 hours of grinding in game.

There is literally a butterfly net IN GAME and this meme uses a Blurite sword. 1/10 would not meme again

Go kill 50 Russian mobsters or would you like to change this task to a mob boss?

Learning to run away from Sara is fairly easy. I’ve been starting to learn solo Sara. I only have a like 15kc so far but I’m starting to avoid most if not all of the unnecessary melee damage. First couple try’s were 1 or 2 kill trips max and now I’m getting more consistent trips of at least 3-4. (I know that’s not great but my gear is fairly sub par for the moment) going to upgrade some gear as well cause I’m definitely wearing the best set up but I didn’t wanna buy a bunch gear and then realize I’m not a fan of that boss and don’t need it or whatever. But I’m 92 range, dragon bow and god dhide so he could definitely manage, but it certainly wouldn’t be ideal. But I completely agree about Bandos, and I haven’t done Arma myself but have been advised against it with the same arguments you made. So maybe Bandos or Sara would be decent starts. To give him a melee and range option. One thing about Sara that took me a few try’s to realize and I struggled to find guides that mentioned it, was that there’s not really a trick to killing the minions, you kinda just gotta tank and DPS cause the faster they die the less hits you take (maybe there is some trick but I couldn’t find any or figure any out)
---
I'm starting to suspect network packet spoofing. Your client can literally think there's 150m in there when it's really just 1 or 2 coins as long as they can remotely control what data comes in.
---
Yeah, /u/meritboi, I'm just fucking with ya. Honestly just get out of the tutorial and just do anything. Kill some cows and goblins, tan some leather, mine some ore, talk to NPCs; just start discovering and you'll be hooked.
---
I think he means it did that after they accepted? Scammers will use an extra bond to double name change.
---
thanks for showing your compass direction. My account now

Is that an unimbued Archer ring? Yeah being a prostitute in Japan definitely sucks then...

I bought like 15k toadflax seeds.

Then they released farming contracts.

I think I'm like 90% down.
---
Thank you for responding. Please post an update on this. It's pretty scary to see possible evidence of people hacking the second trade screen.
---
We've been taught since day one that the second trade screen was the ultimate and trustworthy authority, and now that's starting to fall apart.
---
Seconded
---
Gratz!! I'm 13 or so quests off the cape! Tomorrow night it will be mine :)
---
He could keep the name on a desperate account
---
Jad is a literal joke lol, what are you even talking about
---
Yeah and HCIM make up probably less than 5% of the total player base.
---
sounds like a very successful plan, you should implement that irl bruh
---
America made trump president = Instant loss
---
Quality &gt; Quantity
---
That's how it feels on world 330/302, etc, I would legit quit if I had to play like that
---
If you provide open source tools it really shouldnt surprise you if people use them lol
---
I don't know about you guys, but I don't want OSRS to be overpopulated with Indian and Chinese players. Gold farming will explode, the economy will implode and the game will feel like Heathrow Airport.
---
We had German servers back then for the real osrs. Which we still have on rs3. BUT: the player base decreased so much within the years, so I don’t know how it would turn out to make Indian Server, on the other hand, Asia has a lot of potential players, including India. Maybe we can’t compare india to Germany, but maybe we can. Instead it would be good to have worldwide 4 servers. Europe. Asia and nort / South America. Those servers could have individual worlds like it is currently. But the game should be kept in English imo to not make too much work for jagex. They struggle with the easiest things lel.
---
Also check out the rswiki and look up the pets to get a better idea of what they're like. Some aren't all that great, others are pretty damn neat.
---
I have actually heard this story multiple times. I heard this has also happened on rs3 with party hats. There might be a major bug going on with trading that only a handful of people know about.
---
lol dude if progress on your main is slow and grindy then the last thing you want to do is make a skiller. if you're looking for something to do while you do shit on your main, look into making a f2p pk account or a f2p hc/uim. both are restrictive without being annoying (though not particularly profitable) and will definitely change the way you play the game.
---
ye but in order to efficiently do the afk crabs you need a berserker aura and in order to afford that you had to have been a member for about 2 years OR need to buy silver VIP membership which costs like 40 bucks cause those are the only two way to get Loyalty Points, used to buy auras
---
I see. Well I wish you luck. Honestly the best method is to just kill the healers one at a time. Just click the healer, and focus on prayer switching until he dies. Then get the next one. 
---
Or use mom's credit card and get a tbow and nuke jad without caring about healers haha (Not srs)
---
I'm not disputing that. But like i said i think trying to fix the problems that lead to the addiction will help a lot more than just saying "just find another hobby"
---
This but unironically.
---
I asked you a question.
---
Its not the same as a normal ironman. You're versing other group ironmen in scores.
---
Now answer me. What do you gain?
---
But how is that relevant? OP never referred to Ash once.
---
What is this?
---
It does not work for desktop sessions though. They are getting DDOS'ed, they likely got phished for their account info and doing so also gave away their IP.
---
Damn, It was meant to be a reply to my other comment. I just fked up replying. My bad.
---
This is definitely the most likely scenario, but in the comments OP has stated security measures that would eliminate the possibility of any sort of phishing or other social engineering.
---
The above scenario is only possible assuming everything he's said so far is true.
---
Lmfao emblem farm at that cmb bracket? Right..
---
It's got a 1/142 drop rate. Could be any of em.
---
Thanks so much for the help!
---
Whenever there’s a pvm update scales shoot up, load up now and wait for song of elves
---
I haven’t seen this tournament have I missed something ? Or if it was just mock finals how was gear obtained ?
---
There have been similar threads though, and a j mod commented on one asking for the person's details.  Kind of scary tbh, hopefully a mod comes out and speaks about it soon
---
Ash, aka mod ash is a jagex moderator, I’ve been playing since my childhood, saw many mistakes by jagex, BUT mod ash is really one if not the best moderator ever. 
---
And for wow: well, the current expansion was a desaster.. heard the next big patch should be good, but idk... really disappointed by whole xpac. On the other hand: legion was lit. Whish we could go back to legion.
---
And i don’t think that i Will Play vanilla, osrs is enough vanilla for me.
---
There's something big going on here, there's at least 4 or 5 people in this very post saying they've been approached for the same thing by the same people.
---
This scam only makes sense if they already had your password, but they seem to be approaching everybody. Do they have everybodies passwords?
---
There is also a huge population of gold farming real world traders in Asia. Would help them with their business. There are so many of them from Indonesia/Taiwan/China at green dragons, brutal black dragons, revs, and other popular spots.
---
For context, the cudgel is (basically) the same accuracy and strength of a rune 2h using slash, but 3 ticks faster. I dig it. No mention of 1h or 2h, though?
---
For beginners like me??? People who are trying to learn &amp; people who are suiciding, we need alot more then 5
---
Was there a warning saying as an ironman you can’t retrieve what you put in?
---
Because if not adding that warning is probably the only update it should get.
---
Dopamine
---
Well that kinda defeats the purpose imo lol
---
Lol it's k
---
Yes the clans will help you with everything you need to know once you find the team for you! Best of luck, i'll message you the link to the server
---
You have a really good point.  It could potentially earn a poll, but that is if Jagex is willing to do so.
---
Yes because it makes sense. If you go through the trouble of hacking someone you want to be rewarded with items and gp. How do you do this? Find them in game and ensure they have the items not in their bank before executing the actual hack. 
---
It’s a pretty low effort way of ensuring your hack is profitable. Nothing special here.
---
Welp not safe to trade people any more i suppose
---
Like how could a player get the info of another player after a trade? It seems a little random, like some dude offers an extravagant price for an item to make them withdraw it and then they get kicked and robbed?
---
Unless the scammers some how find the player they already have the info of? Pretty spooky
---
Have to love how everyone downvotes posts detailing how the boss won’t be instanced. I don’t get why every update has to cater to ironmen? Can’t we just get a nice group based boss like gwd that isn’t thrown in an instanced? Really takes away from the spirit of what an mmo and the competition for resources.
---
Is elite range void better at zulrah than blessed d hide and arma helmet? 99 range
---
No clue.  Some sort of PvP minigame that's focused on pure 1v1 bridding would be amazing.
---
Yeah Indian servers so Bar10der can play without bad ping.
---
Just fucked up commenting on other comments too. Yeah. Idk what to say xd
---
well yeah but if you do that you'll anger all the EHP nerds, they get stomach aches imagining 3k xp/hour less than possible even if they're already getting 3m/hour
---
This thread is ran by players, not by anyone working at jagex.
---
I used to play with my dad and brother before eoc. I would definitely try to rope them into playing. we enjoy doing different things in rs (my dad got 99 mining because he's a psychopath) so we could all do different things and it would balance out. I played osrs for like 6 months, got the quest cape and quit, but group Ironman would bring me back
---
You clearly watched the video so you know a little about me, but don’t make assumptions if you don’t understand the context. If you want to pk as a level 90 DMM is not for you.
---
How would they know which world he was on and where he would be? I’m assuming OP’s pm was set to ‘Friends’, so there’s be no way for Sell to know where he would be.
---
Free trade needs to go. Would stop a ton of problems.
---
I did it first try on RS3. Is really that hard on OSRS? What makes it?
---
It's already been explained to you, the logic would just be repeating itself. Judging by your other replies you're far too tense to interact with, you've been told the advantages. Blocked.
---
Also PLEASE a south american world. Playing with huge amounts of ping is horrible, even if I'm used to it after 14 years.
---
Argentina bois
---
I agree, but as a viewer it is nice to not see five episodes of fire striking quest bosses and camping wintertodt for once on an ironman series.
---
I don't even think there is a way to spend too much on supplies at Zulrah.
---
Grats! Well deserved! Also, what hellcat is that? A lazy hellcat?
---
Oh no, A neet who cant get a job so they rely on a universal income blocked me
---
How do people make stats realistic like that?
---
Keanu Reeves would never wish death on a creature!
---
The cigs explain a lot
---
DHL also replaced it for solo Olm, but I guess it's still a budget option for Tekton if no bludgeon
---
Your entire comment history revolves around whose accomplishment is best and trying to one-up people. Seems exhausting.
---
Sadly I don’t think so, there is a runelite plug-in for the old menus though (like inventory, prayer etc.)
---
Lol I remember a Big Bicep video where he posted he was starting a collection of AGSes and other assorted PK memorabilia. Then the *very next* PK video he puts out, you can see in the chat box randomly

---
Playing Ironman and small chest is no problem. Deposit your gear and your 28 inv spaces is way more then you need to make pots. Tired of people playing Ironman then complaining about “inconvenient” stuff.
---
im 83, and even with 60 spaces, its not enough like i said, especially if you're a beginner learning raids like me
---
Apparently you haven't done bounty hunter.  When you get a target and you kill them they have a chance at dropping an Emblem.  If they happen to have an emblem they are trying to level up they will drop that emblem plus an additional chance at dropping an additional one for being your target.
---
I'm a pleb and can't memorize rotations for shit so i skipped zulrah and am now ~300kc at vorkath. It's the easiest money I've ever made, I easily grind out at least 2m/hr with dhcb, significantly more if I get lucky.
---
I'm aware but everything is jusy way too unlikely. Lets assume his private was set to public and the guy was able to find OPs world. The culprit then has to find where OP is located unless lets hypothetically say he was waiting for OP at the ge the whole time. OP then arrives and the culprit begins trading him. How did the culprit know OP has anything valuable on him especially the sycthe when he states, "I log back in after half an hour and everything in my inventory is gone including scythe." So he's insinuating that the sycthe was in his inventory, not equipped and never states that he displays his inventory in the trade window. All of these posts have way too many holes in them and are resulting in loads of theories with no credibility. 3 similar posts have been made and not a single one has been properly detailed in regards to what occurred
---
Why not both
---
I think that is where my friend got the idea, i will check it out. Thanks :)
---
I mean Aussie servers are still 200+ ping there so maybe somewhere in Central Asia like Taiwan or Hong Kong would be ideal
---
I was not lucky. Im highley waiting for this Zeranua person to finally add me or show up online so i can ask her. She seems to be one of the only hopes.
---
Also Bludgeon sound effect
---
Sounds about right. But slower arrows per second but +20 Accuracy and +5 Strength if you use Dragon Arrows. Also, Shortbows are 7 attack range normally, 8 longrange, while Dark Bow is always 10 like the Crystal Bow.
---
Perhaps it might be better in some places, but at least it would be a more decent weapon. I remember back in the day I was using a Dark Bow at Taverley Black Dragons (it was a different time, okay?) and it attacked so slowly that someone stole my dragon as I was firing... At least noobs like that would be better off =P
---
Fair enough, Iv only done raids for fun on a non iron so idk but I seem to remember having a decent amount of invent space and not having to grab too many brews (although ngl I tended to get 1hit mostly haha )
---
I'd smoke too at that much ehp.
---
As someone who just recently got regular void to camp vorkath for some extra $$, is there a HUGE difference between getting elite or not? I’m like 87 range atm, and am in dire need of a cash boost to progress further.
---
Probably enabled by exmod jed
---
Ur nan
---
By the dictionary definition of the word, $ is not universal. It is widely used though.
---
Okay, I'll prioritize the following checks with my script:
---
- Strik0r01 to Strik0r099 (100 names)
---
- Strik3r1 to Strik3r999 (1000 names)
---
- Strik3r01 to Strik3r099 (100 names)
---
- Strik0r 1 to Strik0r 999 (1000 names)
---
- Strik3r 1 to Strik3r 999 (1000 names)
---
I'm not sure how long this will take, but for me it's just "press run and leave it to do its thing" so I don't mind trying out the combos as and when I can.
---
Perhaps W330 players are a better bet (unless you are able to pinpoint the base name spelling)
---
My first DK kill too! I was ecstatic
---
Isn’t even worth wearing a mask if you’re killing an imp
---
“TURN OFF THE SOUND!”
---
Literally the only advice that helped me beat jad^^^^
---
On the q and a where it was first proposed it seemed like the critique was rather more about not being able to do it with a group and that having it instanced would make the area look dead. By husky saying it's no longer an instanced boss he might just mean it isn't _just_ instanced because they wanted to add the group element to it. But that's just me speculating. 
---
Instancing isn't really catering to any game mode in specific because no matter what you play getting crashed isn't fun regardless. If this thing is popular enough that problem is abundent any mode will suffer from it.
---
I'll watch a video on it right now to get the jist of it
---
So there is no possibility that 15 year old code is broken?
---
What an original and thrilling idea
---
Cause a rouge J-mod has never abused his power before.
---
Idk spending 1 hour being mediocre at the game Vs 1 hour getting more done seems like you’re the one wasting time and effort
---
When’s the update coming where we can short items and leverage our gps.
---
&gt;change the word completely and i'm right
---
If any mid levels are looking forward to this boss but can't afford a hasta/bludgeon

The people who make lots of money from stealing from rs accounts target people. There are bots hopping at cox and tob and the ge constantly that note down names of people in expensive gear. 
---
They then use this info (usernames) to search for associated social media accounts, and from there they have a lot of info to search data leaks for reused passwords, possible emails linked to runescape accounts and so on.
---
The last part- finding him at the GE (the most central spot in the game) - is by FAR the easiest part.
---
They got him for 3.5b, even at shit bulk prices thats 1800 USD, they could spend 100 hours looking for info. Thats a lot of money.
---
r/woooosh
---
No, grand exchange is needed and having to use auto typers to trade people and half of them being scammers, nahh. Stop about your back in the days half the items you use are from new content.
---
I know it's not the most original thing, but my idea right now is to add skits through the episodes to change it up a bit, tried it for the first part of the video and will continue to try more to attempt to be unique.
---
Maybe you should play ironman then? I played back then too and like the current state of osrs over way back when. Not sure what youre complaining about if you dont like the game quit playing it
---
Every goddamn time
---
&gt; After I log back in I get pms from 'Sell', 'Merrikare' and 'Pestilent' saying ez 3.5b thx for bank.
---
He wouldn't get PMs from these people if his private wasn't set to public so they knew which world he was on.

Unless you're aiming for rankings/RWT it doesn't matter as long as you enjoy it.

I'll try [in the order I mention here](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c0i76w/looking_for_a_friend_named_strik0r/er6hop0/), probably tomorrow because it is quite late now for me. Or I'll re-edit my code to set up all the checks and let it run overnight. My original run is up past 500, and so far I'm confirming your findings. This feels like a needle in a haystack kind of search with the name permutations lol

I've had some dude called "zik or olm" do the same thing on me.

All friendly and shit, then suddenly starts talking about how he antiscammed a rapier.  
---
I just put him on ignore, I couldn't be bothered.
---
That is actually good new for you. When your appeal takes a few hours it means its being reviewed by an actual human employee, which means you are very close. Instead of getting automatically rejected by Jagex's automated system that filters out bad appeals.
---
Look at the feedback you're receiving to improve on the areas it mentions. Try different combinations. Eventually you'll get accepted.
---
When I'm slaying and some jackass puts up a cannon instead of finding his own world.

Only if the fight mechanic has something to do with it:
---
Lets say a boss has 3 "shrines" that you could kill to make the fight easier.
---
Each shrine killed would prevent you from getting one respective unique.
---
I had this happen to me too, quit the game shortly after as why would I bother playing if someone else has done the grinding for me
---
If this was true than anyone who required yiu to be following for a giveaway would be banned as well. Unfortunately this isn't true.
---
how you gonna make /r/greyhair then not post anything
---
RS3 is in fact for casuals, yes.
---
Whole new meaning to BBC (big black chef)
---
  #6 would be waaaaaay too overpowered, a 13.2% chance for Dragonstone bolts to proc would guarantee at least 1 proc in most fights and would essentially require that people use antifire protection at all times.
---
I had an opposite experience. It took me like 160 kills to get my bronze. then probly another 160 for up to rune. then got dragon defender at 7kc
---
I actually just recently quit rs due to the high ping. PVM content is too frustrating and prayer flicking is impossible.
---
lol. you can easily fit twice the amount on a single 4k monitor. if youre doing afk shit like crabs or nmz turn scaling down and profit.
---
thank you so much for the help. iv'e been wandering world 300 since i built this account. no luck he did say he was going to train at rock crabs so i may post post up there for a while

I didn’t say anything about jad being hard. I just tagged r/woooosh because you guys can’t comprehend simple English
---
I’m interested in alternate uses but theyre not useless considering you can use it on a few bosses and if you need more slayer points it’s nice to speed up the cannon task a bit
---
That's your decision.  Not ours
---
How is this having fun?? Looks like work to me
---
Yeah I found the limit here https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/57ah3w/ip_blocked_from_hiscores_due_to_excessive_use/
---
&gt; The ddos protection will only allow a maximum of 15 requests per minute on average, or up to 100 instantaneous requests so long as you haven't made any requests in the last 5-10 minutes. With the api you won't get ip banned for spamming but if you try to go over the 15/min limit they will severely throttle you to the point where you'll average about 1 successful request per minute.
---
&gt; 
---
Not sure how I didn't get blocked sooner
---
That would still require them to have used up 7 days membership, which is more than enough time to get chain-banned.
---
Clearly you should go for 200m Mining EXP

If youre not a psychopath its always range and mage

At 500k xp and have to take a nap, i don't think i'll make it this time but I will try again

This is a stupid idea.. sorry

Also with xp/drop bugs you do it on as many accs as possible and mule the loot.
---
No you're supposed to point out one of the million flaws in the game, not make up one. I suppose that's too difficult for you though.
---
About to pass 6700 so yeah, no luck yet ! Haha

Or you could watch a backlog of shows, read a book, or even play other games at the same time. I will never understand people who feel the need to have multiple characters being trained.. just go do bossing one of the skills that actively require attention. Different strokes for different folks I suppose.
---
Not when they add the course in mogre camp
---
i just hit 1850 no claw, shits starting to get depressing. hit the unique table 18 times and couldn't roll a 1/10 any of those times.
---
Not trying to sound like too much of an asshole here, but why would you perform such a high-profile bug on such low-profile items?
---
Get def
---
Oof hopefully you get it soon!
---
How exactly will it be decided which unique gets added to the game?
---
Diamond bolts can hit 53s at 99 range, potted with rigour. I would call that pretty high.
---
How about you answer the dude's question instead of trying to deflect with an irrelevant question, eh?
---
I'd reccomend starting by doing all f2p quests and leveling up your combat skills to 40ish. Then get members and start doing some members quests. Set goals for yourself like monkey madness or something and start working on them. This game is all about setting goals imo.
---
Although they are known for gold farming/a meme. It’s still pretty racist that every time there’s a price drop we have people like you blaming them for it.
---
Upvotes for charity.
---
Getting hacked &gt; Slight inconvenience imo
---
Hey! You can go play quests, level up skills, join a clan, or generally do whatever you want. Achievement diary completion is a fun way to sample the various areas and skills if you're new.
---
If you get stuck on a specific piece, there's virtually always a youtube guide.
---
Just make sure to avoid the wiki with "fandom" in the url as a subdomain; it's an advertisement-riddled mess that's increasingly outdated.
---
Cooking &amp; fishing cause I'm basic
---
Your first was untrimmed huh?
---
My first run I had a friend on discord watch me with screen-share and he'd tell me when I had low health because I was so focused on not fucking up the prayer switches, it was the only way I could do it.
---
The empty hand not holding a defender
---
I woulda called him a noob, but I'm a noob too.
---
Because "just being in the same world" doesn't make it the same or better.
---
yea that is some awful luck on a 1 in 300. Still at least it is thermy which is a quick boss. Though if you were not using Tureal skipping you probably got rather high slayer going for that.
---
I don't think it's going to get any better I'm now 2k+ no claw I see my mates get 2 + let before 1.3k
---
Oh snap. That’s a good question... Didn’t really think about that, but I also had no idea that this was going on at the time.
---
I just figured it was an attempted lure, and I wasn’t going to let them get me. Made sure I banked everything first and didn’t trade them anything.
---
I guess I just got lucky they tried a different method with me and it’s unfortunate that there’s so many people coming forward in recent days with some very poor experiences from the same people.
---
... They can die in rs? How?
---
Think of it this way, you can change your pants now, and instatly change em back with the mime legs
---
Ds2 with 70 range must have been a nightmare
---
You can not relatively safely with the correct programs that move the mouse and camera in angles so often, mimicking how a player would ect. Any in game trigger that auto bans wouldn't be able to tell the difference and so on.
---
yup ppl just dumb af sadly
---
Every trash CC every
---
HCIM and IM are the same thing pretty much.
---
And UIM is pretty much dead, even though death mechanics completely changed it.
---
End of the day, how does it negatively affect you? 
---
Because it doesn't seem to have any negative effects on the game at all, except the argument of "wasted dev time".
---
Meanwhile they're going to make a bunch of money from new accounts getting members which will pump up their revenue and their metrics directly. 
---
Also the free content advertising they're going to get second hand via content creators who are going to use this mode.
---
It's not like OSRS is struggling for players, so I don't see a problem with it.
---
Yes, so it's even more rare getting all no armor/weapons. That's the point.
---
Why was this removed tho
---
Still no response?
---
&gt;I don’t think someone would be stupid enough to
---
Any time you say some version of this, some shining headlamp of humanity will show up to carry the ring to Mordor.
---
Fair enough but still
---
Need to do your runecrafting
---
Sign me up.
---
You could turn it into a range tank or maybe a piety build. If you really want to get into PKing I'd start over with a pure or a zerker though.
---
When normal plebs are faced with daily ironmen challenges. Boo fucking hoo, go buy some herbs or something.
---
I found the bot farm
---
Moon is sick
---
Can someone answer why this was removed? Jmod please, we need info if this is a bug, glitch or everyones gotten phished?
---
Only upvoted bc grape whistle cause I’m tired of getting graped in the mouth. Then again I’m kinda asking for it with my purple graceful
---
this made me laugh out loud, tysm! &lt;3 :Ddddddddddddddd
---
yessssssssssss
---
Ds2 was the longest for me and most annoying was for sure mm2 just because of the platform part.
---
I remember cutting maple trees and burning the logs one day with my public off. There were two other guys there but I had my public off so I didn’t really care. Well, after I finished I turned my public on and the whole chat is literally calling me a bot and to mass report me lmao just because I never responded to him. Damn, fuck me for not wanting to have a conversation about how much you love weed and getting drunk.
---
I think you'd need to take some pretty big logical leaps to interpret what I said as fearmongering.
---
That’s a shit build all around obv a zerker wouldn’t work..tribrid if you get all ur stats up inc range and 42 prayer idk I’d personally use it as a skulking alt or slayer alt while you make a good pure
---
You're allowed to play more than 1 account at a time. You can make a new account and play the current account via 2 separate clients.
---
Oh it was I died 12 times but my homie let me borrow his dhcb there's no way I could have done it without it.
---
haha, alluding to racism is funny
---
What is the hardest untrim flex? Slayer?
---
Said everybody when you explain to them how training in runescape works. 
---
But honestly though, it's fun when you can do 18 hours worth of money making in 1 hour, then transfer it all over to your main. Not that I'm saying it's possible to maintain (because you'd need one hell of an efficient cycle method, even if they're all doing an AFK money maker) but still..
---
That guy is a chef at the white house. His name is Andre Rush and he went on record stating his arms are 24" around. He cooked in the army as well and part of his workout is 2222 pushups every weekday (I'm not kidding lol).
---
Or when I show up to the slayer task and bring a defender instead of a shield to wyverns 😤
---
Its almost like words can change definition by its most common use
---
but guess you just want to act superior :) good job
---
What
---
Thanks, I'll check him out
---
UIM Verf’s karamja only uim
---
They'd rather want you to sign up for a recurring mempership on your credit/debit card, instead of you actively having to get another bond per month.
---
The recurring model happens no matter if you play the game or not for a few months, if you forget to turn it off.
---
tell her I've got another meat hammer she can see...
---
I died 3 times cause of miss clicks with that part so I know your struggle.
---
Thanks homie!
---
I remember this but not really. Have a link for context?
---
Alch it.
---
I’m Tyrone! Fuck that tick cooking shit!
---
its like 1% chance each time you get a nest
---
You really think people are merching 25 ags
---
this dude boofed a super strength pot
---
its a stupid concept
---
If it revitalises the game for people then why not. Like I said, regular Ironman doesn’t appeal to me and I’m  sure many others due to the skilling/supply aspect.
---
He also says he'll smite you
---
So is your mom.
---
People enjoy them. Therefore, not pointless.
---
Thank you, I'll check it out
---
I'd say his cookings good even without me having to try it...
---
They keep people playing post max which is money for Jagex. Your statement is irrelevant
---
Honestly I would rather do sharks to 99 make some mad profit but depending on your intensity and attention you’re looking at I’d say around 6 hours
---
Me yesterday.
---
&gt;  Why would they lure people whose passwords they don't have?
---
Go do your due diligence and look up what a lure is
---
I just feel like too much bis content in this game is buyable. I want to unlock weapons rather than just buy them.
---
He's spending the tokkul
---
Frogs dream of the Moon
---
Isn't the infrastructure in India pretty poor for this? My last company worked with WiPro and it was like pressing my balls into a belt sander whenever there was an issue on their end.

Trying to get 87 con so I can get portal nexus ornate pool and other goodies
