Yea it's just so much money I'm worried it's gonna make some automatic alarm.. Only maxing or tbow grind left for me so I rather play with friends on a normal acc and have fun than flex and bankstand.

Jagex should learn from CipSoft. Tibia bot problem went from rampant and pretty much mandatory for warring guilds to minimal/unnoticeable

I use it for PKing...

Man do it. The pool and the occult altar are literally the most amazing awesome things lol. Saves So much time. Also the ornate jewellery box gets a ton of usage too - I used to go through a fuckton of rings of wealth. Also doing clue scrolls its awesome.

I just got an elite from demonic gorilla and its funny i didnt realize it was an elite until my 2nd step. I was like wait..wtf? Got black chaps (g) so a nice little 1.2m.

Ah yeah that's right. And i get what youre saying its not a big req at all, 50 slayer. Overall though im just saying even if it helped by 5-10% then thats a plus. Tho i suppose revs are high risk high reward since they're such good loot.

learn how to merc, get yourself into the penny markets as a beginner. I would suggest you start off with seeds for herbs. Watch a merc guide on youtube and understand how to determine buying/selling and margin price. Even if your only making a couple gp per seed up to 5-12gp profit its still free gp. Seeds are a very easy way to learn how to merc. Flax is also easy penny market money along with cheap runes.

* What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo*

Metadata is data about the data. That's the context in which people mean it's self referential. I agree with your point that calling it self referential isn't quite right either, but at that point its splitting hairs.

RuneLite question, when using the look up/hi score thing, what does the symbol next to clue count above the green skull represent?

I don't particularly miss being a noob, seeing as I got scammed multiple times and everything took a lot longer than now when I have tons more game knowledge than back then.

What's sad is there are no repercussions for lurers and scammers so it is a good way to make gp if you already have some to get started
---
I used to think 1k gp was actually just 1 gp. For some reason I was convinced that k = gp, so I went around trying to hire people to do work for me (like getting me pots of flour by using wheat in the lumbridge mill). I was telling people I'd pay 300k for it, and was met with lots of people saying "bullshit you dont have that much, show me". I had like 5000 gp at the time and proudly put it up in the trade window, only to be called a noob which offended and confused me a lot
---
Back then calling someone a noob was pretty much saying the N word...
---
Does asking for an easier task change anything?
---
How many hours?
---
Yes man
---
My suggestion is shut the fuck up you cant stop it nor can jagex. Only thing worse than bots are the ones who complain.
---
You cant stop them but if everyone would stop buying gold like lazy fucks there would be no reason to bot (as much) probably cut it down by 80%

You are making some weird shit about it and insulting me and saying it’s not enough when 90% of people would just ignore you.

You’re actively seeking negative attention and I hope you don’t find yourself hated for it. Because it’s really hard not to view somebody doing that negatively.

Unless you're an Ironman, it does affect you. If people could do this casually then more people would be able to do zulrah with almost no effort and would absolutely crash the prices of zulrah drops

Not true. The knowledge of PVP and lack of proper updates from Jagex is what killed pvp... If Jagex did some updates for pvp(not bullshit to get people into the wild) then things would turn out better.
---
That sounds ridiculously inefficient
---
Ooooh I get it now

I’m watching soup do it with a trident and non-bis mage gear and he’s doing fine. Catching every freeze and only taking damage because he’s too lazy to flick minions. I can only imagine how nuts it would be with sang self heal and full anc+arcane

or, maybe its a joke?

Well... since you lose hcim when you die I dont think many people having problems with at least some hcim trying to do tob.

Yeah if something sounds too good to be true it probably is. Sure it shouldn’t be a thing but the fact is that someone you don’t know is willing to trade you and lose 5.7m rather than throwing it in the ge should’ve been your first clue that something is up.
---
Question. What type of bear is best?
---
Yes the timer does always run. And thats the point, you should be guaranteed a full minute. 
---
And this is true about the mage potion or whatever to reset the decay, which is why I said it may be code related as to why they don't do this because it would have to be separate for each boosted skill being on a different timer. 
---
However to combat making all of them a different timer they could just make it that it only resets if you drink the same potion/apply the same boost. That would be easier I believe. 
---
If anything tho adding the option to be able to reset your stats from an ornate pool shouldn't be to hard. Again, going in and out of clan wars does this. So there is coding in place to do it. Oe there should be at least

I’d say I die once every 3 or 4 raids. Most if not all of my deaths are from when I first started trying to get early kc when everyone is still learning.
---
Farming contracts are insane, man. You can re-roll twice with no consequences and if you're stuck on a task that is expensive/hard, there is still a good chance you have the required seed from opening previous seed packs.

You botting? Else it’s a pretty cancer grind.

"Activities" is a very vague thing. But 90% of the time you can't go wrong by shooting for barrows gloves and a quest cape.

how is it even profitable to train construction?

Don’t like it’s color? Shoo it away lol
---
Toadflax is decently high profit and also safe since you don't lose 40k per dead patch. Do the quests that reward farming xp to get pretty close to the level needed to plant (fairytale 1, my arm's big adventure, garden of tranquility etc.)
---
I don't think I got scammed often but one time at pest control I sold my granite shield to someone for 90k and for whatever reason counting the 0s I counted it as like 900k or 9m or something (I had never seen a 100k cash stack and didn't know it turned white) so I acceptes and in the second trade screen I re counted the 0s and again somehow I counted it to be like 900k but then when I accepted again I realized it was only 9k.  Idk how I miscounted that but I was so excited cuz I thought I made so much money on it but I ended up getting scammed 81k.
---
The only other time I bought a gadder hammer for 10k cuz someone told me it was worth 1m lmfao

Its because they have untradables on them such as void, fcape, defender, torso, assembler.

When you die in below 30 wilderness or in PvP worlds these item’s break and require a fee paid to an NPC to fix them. The person who kills them gets the same amount of GP as the fee to repair (or maybe slightly less I can’t remember)

Nvidia GPU software has Shadowplay which allows you to capture the past 5 minutes or so of whatever was on screen
---
You can't boost for kraken tasks, and agility potions are +3 not +5. And it's also not a 20% boost in xp. It would be a few very specific landmarks that would be affected for at most a few hundred thousand xp and you can already boost for them anyway. All this being said I don't give a shit about boosts to artisan skills. Like I said initially, I was thinking this was a suggestion to gathering skills and I still think it's a good suggestion for them. Combat has had so many buffs to DPS and kills/hr with various updates (new bis gear, rejuv pool, closer teleports, etc) but gathering methods have stayed pretty much at the same rates for ages.

Update! I got around to it today, karils top and bottom, armadyl helm, bandos boots, blowpipe with rune darts. Borrowed a bgs with the swap you recommended (d boots, firecape, b ring, BGS). I’ve gotten 10 kills so far, and was lucky enough to get the Vorkath head on 3KC! So now I have Ava’s assembler!

It's universally agreed that south stairs are best stairs in lumbridge castle.

If you look directly at the castle, it's the left set of stairs.

Man, that looks like the *really* early days. Is this from the runescape 2 beta test? Late 2003-early 2004 or so?

Its even green like morytania
---
If you get any of those seeds, just sell em. Farming has become so shit money wise. 99 farming, magic secateurs, I normally make my money back per seed.
---
What if item stacks are capped until real ID is verified to jagex on non-ironman accs, and the cap scales with quest points exponentially. 
---
New bots would be unable to farm long, without ability to stack more than for example 50k gp or 50 iron ores.
---
Legit players won't really notice this cap in early game and if they do, easy fix. Verify national ID.
---
That's because your English friends aren't from that part of England but there are many people that sound like Torvesta lol.

You can only take as much damage as you have hitpoints left.

Damn beat me I had them in 118
---
why the fuck are people downvoting this. Core mechanics shouldn't change by crossing the ditch
---
They're a fuckload more trustworthy than you are mate. They've actually got something significant to lose if they bullshit.
---
I always read it as Yamalo Shit Cardio
---
M O R E   P O I N T S
---
Of course, I would have died a lot if ranged didn't exist
---
sand crabs u can afk at 10mins at at time though.
---
I feel chaos druids has its place tho. especially when u can use vig mace and pray ultimate str for 100k-150k str xp/h when compared to sand crabs its like 50k-70k.
---
That's a horrible excuse. You buff it with an add on that's risked in pvp problem solved
---
then you accept that you lose 5k and tele back up within 1minute and continue the grind lol.
---
Got no devils advocate for that even my dude. I'm just not arguin w op gear that benefits my rangin ass lmao
---
Its hard to judge , depends on what tasks you are getting etc and how efficient you are, whether or not you are using a cannon and what not
---
If you are that passionate about being creative and understanding the mechanics of old school then you should be willing to put the time and effort into it within the live game, or you can wait patiently for the unrestricted worlds to become available, or you can use a private server.  
---
The core reason why they aren't open all the time is because it does not encourage growth for the players, it also doesn't let players earn their stats/gear and experience all of the content that is available, therefore there is no satisfaction or reason for players to return to the game in that sense.  
---
Of course some people don't want to experience all of the content, or earn their gear or train stats and that's why they open them sometimes, they cater for both groups without ruining the overall experience.
---
Don't need the clerk's, just click the desk
---
Yep as a goal oriented player I'm enjoying the hell out of my iron. Left my main around 2050 total since its just grinding the same god damn thing for money now.
---
Again, it depends what kind of activities you like doing. Personally I'm more of a skiller than pvmer so I prioritised qol and travel things more, if you like slayer/bossing more then you'll want to get the equipment a bit earlier. 
---
Personal order:
---
83 con/max house, rune pouch, whip, 70 pray, bp, with the bucket somewhere in there depending on how often you do farm runs. 
---
Fury is mostly a defensive upgrade over glory so it can wait a while, dfs and guthans are kinda nice to have but I would probably prioritise zenytes over them (never actually used either tho so I can't speak for their usefulness)
---
tfw you're precisely 87 agil as well, top timing
---
You do realise that you can kill multiple bosses on slayer tasks without being assigned them as the actually task right?
---
From the start of time, flame allowed man to flourish. And even now, he devices new fiery arts.
---
But... His reason makes him doubt flame.
---
And so we waver... And falter...
---
wintertodt is never worth playing
---
Yeah, I know.
---
Tbh, they should just turn void back to 15% and give the new OP arm 20%, and then up to 35% while wearing slayer helm + task only.
---
I feel bad for Aitan, he is not mighty, fierce or strong. Melee OP.
---
I’m pretty sure I also saw this guy at the GE today, he was “selling a tbow” for whatever you could offer and it ended up being a cup of tea + a shortbow. Pretty nice guy
---
That's not sustainable, and the $reward irl won't be that high. Plus it's extremely dishonorable.
---
It is for firemaking? Crazy xp for free and you make money 👌
---
Questcape and achievement diaries while bossing
---
Exactly. Sharing a low level course isn't very, errr, approving. And sharing end-game course doesn't make sense because where are the mid-courses?
---
Crystal Armor - Very pointless in it's current form. If Crystal armor offered more of a defense over range strength boost, like a slightly weaker/range version of Justiciar that would be interesting and offer something different to the mix.
---
Quest Requirements - I'm not a fan of the 70 construction or better yet the 70 for all the stat requirements. I feels like they added a pay wall to the quest with the cost of Construction. The amount of content this quest is supposed to open up (with a diary) and the people who have these skill requires compared to the rewards we would get. Just doesn't really add up in my head right. Agility will make sense considering this region and quests leading up to it were very Agility oriented. Everything else feels a bit tacked on just to make high requirements. 
---
Enhancement Seeds - It's fine. But the Crystal Gear need a buff outside the armor buff. 
---
Blade of Saeldor - So a degradable but very pitiful and ever so slightly tentacle whip? I mean, I feel like we are just trading one degradable weapon money sink for another one that will be just as bad cost-wise or hell even worse for the first few years until I dies into obscurity.
---
Prifddinas Agility Course - The rates are too low despite the high requirements to use the course compared to similar level courses. The course should drop both the Crystal's AND Grace if they keep the experience the same. Or they should just buff the exp amount.
---
Iorwerth's Dungeon - What's the point of doing Mourning End PT 2 again? To do this new quest? Oh and Death Runes I guess? How about making it less of a pain in the ass to reach Dark Beasts that are currently there.
---
Crystal Tree - It's an okay update. Although I'd request specific tree spots for it specifically and being more of a high reward, only a few at a time thing. But that's just me.
---
Enhanced Crystal Chest - The crystal shard thing is being taken too far here. I like the idea of dragonstones being used to upgrade the chest like someone else suggested. I want more shards from a chest as a reward, not another sink for them.
---
Infinite Teleport Crystal - Its nice I guess? On par with Monkey Madness 2. But having to kill for it and making it tradable seems like a mistake. Either give it as a quest reward, or let people who kill for them trade it and let other people use it without the quest requirement, but teleport only outside the gates if they complete Regicide. It becomes valuable for people doing quests or having to kill Elves in that region. After completing Song of the Elves should you be allowed to configure it and teleport inside the city as originally intended. Adding a teleport to the other elf village would be a nice added bonus .
---
Divine Potions - Sounds interesting. But I'm not sure if a longer more consistent damage upgrade with -10 HP is the best idea. I'm willing to see where it goes.
---
Crystal Implings - I'm s little bored with implings. Unless these things can be consistently caught, they really don't offer much to the community at a level 80 hunting requirement. Change them to a level 70 hunting requirement just like the quest. 
---
Prifddinas Achievement Diary - A 2.5k lamp quest reward for tier 1, when the entire region is locked away behind a ton of mid tier quests, most players are around 40-50 in most stats by then. Not to mention by time you have the stats required to completely the other tasks those lamps are even more meaningless exp. But hey more Runecrafting exp I guess? The rewards are also terrible. The necklace I can see somewhat useful, but by time you attain it there is very little reason to use it.
---
Overall just a lot of decisions I don't care about. This area has some of the highest quest requirements with a lot of content. Just that the content just doesn't offer much compared to existing content. The content here should be helping to fast track skilling, offer diverse gear that's better for some forms of end-game content, and overall be a solution to adding quality of life changes to existing content. Not content that's success is tied to the implementation of Crystal Shards.
---
what a stuck up cunt, almost went permanantly blind rolling my eyeballs when he started listing the age of his kids. nobody fuckin cares.
---
Its only $11 lets be real, i paid less than that for a great burger today.
---
Give it a shot, id say get members right away.
---
If you dont like it, buy a burger with your next $11  and unsubscribe from osrs.
---
And yeah, if you get hooked you will be grinding till they shut her down, along with the rest of us.
---
Okay thank you for the info! Should I prioritize getting rigour over upgrading higher end gear?
---
Yes they all pick up arrows, unless you have metal armour on.
---
Its easier to do 10 accounts of mining than 1 account of zulrah

I was certain that this is fake and the last barbarian will be something like "Dick, no need to explain what he eats for dinner"

Whys he getting downvoted, am i missing something?

Imagine a game over real life

You can work on mining.

Its not worth having a f2p money making alt if it isnt for flipping

No, prob not.

Best alts to grind f2p may be ogres alts think theyr like 100k per hour?
---
This can be done for a long time, you have to create an email account for it (or use an email without Osrs account yet), add the email to your account through profile page and you are able to login from email on computer and game center on mobile! 
---
Im doing this since Januari this year and working flawlessly :-)
---
He’s wearing 3 pieces of a barrows set (out of 4) that gives a set bonus of bonus damage for missing hp. He’s also wearing a slayer helmet. It’s really inefficient because he’s not capitalizing on the strengths of either.
---
Going around with fe, iron and btw in your username is the rs equivalent of being vegan
---
wrong thread, this is for asking questions to other players. requests are for the q&amp;a thread posted weekly by a jmod
---
Thanks! :D This will keep me motivated in both ways: Agility in game and in real life. :)
---
if ur gunna skull up wit it yeah. 
---
just to be sure, u are skulling right? msb with salve ammy ei is better gp/h than blowpipe+salve+pegs+archersi unskulled by a decent bit, but pretty sure bp no salve is still better dps than msb and salve.
---
Nice, subbed.  
---
This is the first RS video that has made me smile and laugh in weeks (or months to be honest) and coincidentally it's also the first video that hasn't been dragged out to 10 minutes with mumbling and filler clips. I have been un-subscribing from a lot of content creators recently because it has felt like a waste of time watching their videos, but from seeing this and looking at the other videos on your channel I can tell you genuinely enjoy sharing your unique ideas, which is the best part.
---
Yup. You can look up "Quest experience rewards" and find ones with high exp and no to low requirements. You could also look up something like "Quest order". I usually do Tourist Trap for 1-26 agility and then grand tree to skip the slow agility levels. You can even quest up to like level 45.
---
Who's the jmod who thought this was a good and well designed idea? He's the real 4Head here.
---
I thought you were talking about a radio station. "85 FM The Todt."
---
No. Don't increase runecrafting xp at all.
---
That'd be stupid. Don't be disingenuous
---
People getting savage with these beggar bots, I like it

Not so evil after all

Best android emulator for playing OSRS on PC?

I think the discouragement of the casual botter has greater potential. The fact that these mass-bot farm owners depend on it makes them far more motivated to keep going than the usual botter. Tackle what you can, the bot farms are a lost battle if we're being honest.
---
I'm only arguing against the original statement, im not making any personal judgements

Really nice to hear! Thanks!

The post wasn't removed intentionally. It was listing reasons other posts got filtered, which in turn caused it to be filtered as well. It was in the mod queue for review and I've approved it.
---
So you are going to be crafting bulk magic armor, at a loss, for 20k xp an hour, just because you don’t want a brilliant new magic smithing production skill where it would fit perfectly?
---
Non elite void :sick:
---
*Commences one mean ass tug into shirt*
---
Yeah idk what's wrong with all those noobs but contracts are just pure garbage for anyone but ironmen.
---
By arguing against it, you are making a personal judgment, because otherwise you can only argue against the likelihood of the point of view I described, which is one that is very likely for one that acts as the meme says, in which case you are strictly arguing against the morality of the action described, not the likelihood of the action being a reasonable course of action as stated in the meme.
---
What if darkness has turned me into a ghost that doesn't care about random adventurers
---
jagex wont reply to this thread
---
Amen.
---
Bpipe being meta literally everywhere is bad for the game.
---
Depends on who I was raiding with. People I barely know? They'd do the same to me, so yeah, I'd probably run off with the tbow. My friends? No game is worth that, doesn't matter how much money you throw at me.

Sounds like covering your ass for acc sharing

Just a simple interface stall, follow a person and then open skills menu or poh settings etc

This, going after the "dealers" in this game does nothing because there's unlimited bots waiting to take it's place and new accounts to sell it from. Start coming own heavy as fuck for buying ANY amount of gold. Announce it's gonna be a perm from now on an dedicate lots of resources the first few weeks trying to catch all the accounts buying gold as you can.
---
I'd say if the game were being played normally sure, but when everyone is there for 100 points and no brewing is happening, it's basically griefing.
---
Have had much more, but doesnt it feel so good to get that many

To clarify a few things, if a user is banned by us they will get a message informing them that they were banned. Sometimes a reason isn't given to the user with that message, but we will usually provide it if asked in Mod Mail. The only times a reply won't be given is if it is blatantly obvious what the user did, if the user didn't even try to appeal (e.g. just spouting insults or such), or if we're busy or if the message should be reviewed by a different mod for reasons like bias or expertise. We cannot shadowban users, but we can filter users using Auto Mod. However, this is done extremely rarely and it is near always for something like spammers. Sometimes the filter does hit the wrong users due to similar names or keywords, but Auto Mod was recently tided up and if we are aware of any mistakes or false positives, we will address them.
---
There is also a comment and post filter; two kinds actually. One that automatically removes the post with the keyword and put in Mod Queue for review and another that reports the post for the keyword so it shows up in Mod Queue. Most of it would be stuff you'd expect; stuff like racism is auto removed while stuff like "retard" is reported so we can review the context. Depending on the number of reports and who is about, the Mod Queue can get backed up, which can delay some posts from showing (like this one), especially since we don't have mods checking it 24/7. When posts are removed, whether by Auto Mod or manually, the user isn't altered unless we also send a message through Mod Mail. For the majority of removed posts, it would be more trouble than it is worth to provide a reason with our current system since the posts were obviously rule-breaking and in some cases informing the user could just lead to more spam. In other cases, it would help to give a reason but we can usually provide one if asked in Mod Mail or even restore the post if there was a mistake, like with the above filters.
---
As for the specific examples, I'm not really in the loop with the whole "honk" thing but apparently, there is some association with white nationalists and clowns now. The "locked a few posts and banned literally everyone in the comments" isn't very specific, not that it happens often. If I had to guess, you're talking about Olympus. They got banned for intentionally reposting old posts and the comments of those old posts multiple times, which broke the content policy's [vote manipulation](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or) rule. They were informed of this and told they could have the bans reduced to temp bans if appealed. Also, you never need to make an alt account to ask about that ban; you can still send a Mod Mail even if banned.
---
Anyway, users never get banned for no reason. There isn't a perfectly consistent scale of what earns a ban or temp ban, but there is usually one or more rules broken, often in excess. Posts are removed more easily for minor violations but that is not the same as banning. Often, removed posts don't even lead to a warning since it isn't a long term problem. As for political posts,  it may vary mod to mod but I don't believe they would be grounds to remove a post unless it gets way off topic (rule 1) or starts to get offensive. If you think someone was banned for saying something innocent, chances are there are other posts you are not seeing that earned a ban; just the other day someone deleted their rule breaking post after they were ban and tried to appeal like it was a mistake as if we didn't have logs to confirm these things...

Gratz but u mustve only done like 20 chests

I wonder if you could smuggle illegal stuff to entrana in a looting bag and suiciding there
---
Freddo I love your content.

Jed
---
Those stats should be good enough, although not for fast kills but still definitely doable. I found I took a lot of damage in void and switched to ahrims/dhide.
---
Posts that show a username with an accusation are removed as soon as we notice. But sometimes if they aren't reported timely we can miss them for a few hours.
---
And unfortunately, the ban appeals that make the front page are ones that aren't rule breaking. The rule is "No macroing ban appeals" not "No ban appeals"; it is something I've been wanting to address for a while but until it is properly updated I won't remove non-macroing ban appeals.

Sadly, this is probably it

Gz
---
What happened here is he hit his G.E buy limit and you helped him by bass it. He gave you money for runes you buy runes from G.E and trade them back to him. 
---
Don't think it's "illegal" activity but I'm not 100% on that.
---
You're very naive to be suggesting this
---
:c
---
Depends certain items like feathers for fletching you can only buy 13k every 4 hours so if you need more you ask players to buy them for you and you give them a little extra for helping you out so if a feather is 3gp they will give you 5gp per feather for example.
---
Nobody gonna rag with this set lol
---
Right i almost feel wrong doing it. Even though it just feels like we both helped eachother out
---
Hmm this seems a bit strange to me as well. There are ge limits on certain items. But I dont think runes are one of them. I’ve always taken these players doing this as scammers and not interacted with them but I could be wrong. 
---
Im interested in the answer too. 
---
Thanks,
---
Another problem is that your stats aren't too low for Zulrah. They're too low for void. Void sucks at lower levels.
---
Definitely would like the sword to be a longsword instead of a regular sword, similar to how we had rapier and then cls pre-eoc.
---
Has to get that shit done dude, first signs of a developing addiction
---
I like this idea more than warding
---
you must be missing lots of hits, void with those stats/gear is definitely good enough, but kills will be like 3 mins each, or even longer.
---
Im not really sure on g.e. Limits as i didnt know about them till i got barbarian fishing unlocked yesterday and bought feathers(: so im at a loss about it compared to runes too
---
then theres no point in using humidify tbh
---
I used to naively think that all gold that came into the game was generated by sales to npcs. I also believed that something like 80% of that was from new players selling bronze sq shields to the lumby general store
---
Using WASD camera controls? Gf account
---
I found this again http://imgur.com/a/ajVIw/all
---
Yea see thats how i took it. Is like he paid me for helping him get them quickly. But 5 mil seems like a lot but maybe it adds up due to it being runes i guess. I just am really confused if i did something wrong here
---
But what if your pal is your buddy?
---
IIRC even if you change your name twice, you keep the same row position on friend lists of those who has added you. You then track scammers by storing infromation about your tracking account which has the scammer added as a friend and a number at which row in the list is he.
---
finkle is einhorn!

Lmfao how do u not have 1b already it’s 2k19

Way better than warding anyway

Gatekeeping being born in the 90’s?

Which boss are you having trouble with?
---
This guy knows what's up!
---
I wouldn’t do this with any uncommon items that dont sell quickly and in high quantities. Typically these people saying they hit the buy limit dont give you any cash upfront to buy the item they want. And anyone could tell you they hit their limit what the truth is they did not. They you buy the items and when you go to trade them for a profit they low ball you and your stuck because you cant sell the items back on the ge for what you bought them for. So thats the only caution.
---
Yea runes go up in price quick as they are worth more slightly bigger margin nut be careful some people will ask you to buy them a item for a crazy high price you buy it go to sell them the item and they log off because you have just brought a worthless item on the ge that they have put that sell offer on the ge if that makes sense
---
It’s not complicated to walk to a bank and click two buttons.
---
Minarch seems like a bro, wouldn’t mind tossing a few back with him sometime.
---
combat without slayer is extremely short term if you ask me
---
why do people use food for slayer lol
---
guthans/sgs/flick
---
at 90 defence and full bandos you shouldn't really ever really be taking that much damage anyway
---
It's hilarious because bp came out back when this community was very very much "anti power creep" to the point where people would absolutely screech at the site of an op suggestion.  
---
Yet back when we were barely breaking through the t75 progression, jagex releases what is basically a fucking t85 weapon and *barely anyone gave a fuck at all*.  Even after it was nerfed it was still op.  Dart speed weapon that does massive damage AND can do venom?? Lul come on
---
This community is honestly breathtaking sometimes haha.
---
Oh wow. Ok then he was just a decent dude(: he paid up front each time.
---
Already over :(
---
Normally for new quests and achievement diary content but a priff achievement diary is a poor idea. Doesn't make sense to have such a small area have a diary, especially when thematically it overlaps massively with western provinces. You also couldn't expand the diary to tirannwn (or however it's spelt) for the same reason.
---
If you want it to contain diary content, rework the western provinces diary and potentially make it the first diary with master tier. The 93 slayer requirement would already fit nicely into a higher tier and maybe you could add a requirement to complete chompy bird hunting (4000 kills).
---
If you're going to give anywhere a diary, rework the fossil island task list and give that place a diary, far bigger area, far more diary content accessibility for lower levels.
---
It's impossible to go after gold buyers since they'd just use increasingly hard to track trade methods, like imbalanced pvp fights,  low volume GE trades, or other odd methods
---
Me n my buddy do the same thing, we found just following solo guides is good enough (alot of good information is scattered, kind of annoying to find a good source).  We skip vanguard's since it seemed annoying as duo.  We have yet to learn vespula also so we spend a extra few minutes scouting.
---
Einhorn is Finkle!
---
I use the other side so I don't have to see an endless amount of players when I right click the bankers.
---
void sux at lower levels. you could skip blue phase to reduce damage look at youtube how to skip blue phase.
---
than to impose their will on other people based on the things that personally pissed them off?
---
no, they dont. this is their favorite shit to do.
---
You probably just don’t know how tbow works if you think it’s worthless haha
---
Your friend is not your buddy, pal!

Completely unrelated 🤔

Originality. I like it.

You wanted an argument.

These brainlets vote in your polls

It’s the guy!

Pray Mage + Dfw + Super antifire = 4

Strange that they can't optimise the code in a way that it should be checking the level of the requirement and the one you got before so you actually get a lower level farming contract.

I’m out of the loop what’s the joke?

For real what's up with the rest of the pussy shit in this thread these people have no sense of their priorities in life

“A scratcher, basically, is someone who taught him/herself the art of tattooing without the benefit of an apprenticeship under a professional artist. ... Many times, they are new to trade themselves, and are using "apprenticeships" as a way to create revenue, rather than as a way to create future masters of the trade.”

Yeah but once you've shown the rune gloves to Lorelai you unlock the barrows gloves for good and don't need to keep the rune anymore.

He's fighting the Giant Sea Snake from Royal Trouble, not Zulrah

To be fair crafting is very much a different beast to what it was on Ironman first years. Seaweed and Sandstone make a huge difference.

Herblore is a real grind for sure, early levels Chaos Druids offer decent prayer (Ensouled heads) / herblore XP per hour utilising a looting bag in edgeville.

If you die beyond 20 they turn into gp

Keep in mind, if you switch to buckler -&gt; protect from mage means you are tanking range hits as well from vorkath-&gt; more eating -&gt; less dps overall

It's 1 ticket per minute if you never miss one which is 4 hours and 10 minutes. But there'll be times you fail and can't get to the next one. Expect around 4 and a half hours.

The right banker is bis for you too

Sure...
---
Same. My friend and I used to make bronze armour, iron armour, and silver jewelry to sell to the varrock general store.
---
Nice! I'm glad it's working out for you! I got the head within 10kc as well lol the assembler is excellent. Also since we last spoke I learned how to woox walk pretty reliably and it actually makes a pretty big difference in kill times so once you can consistently kill him without dying I'd reccomend checking out some videos and giving it a try.
---
I love everything about what this represents lol
---
I dont see why not. If you dont know how to make it, then youre clueless as to whats actually involved in creating it, clueless to how difficult it can be to make detection that doesnt set off false flags all the time, and clueless to how fruitless it can be when you spend so much time creating detection thats literally just made useless as soon as botters realize a way to sneak under the detection once again. 
---
Its literally the same as when people say "just code it lol" but have zero dev experience. 
---
If it were so easy to make "better bot detectiom" that reddit cries over, are you people really so ignorant AND cynical to think that jagex wouldnt make it?
---
"no alternative suggestion, no nothing" oh my god this is so true.. Warding suffers so hard from this, people keep saying "no we don't like it" without being specific about what they don't like.
---
I've split a scythe when it was worth 3.3b with people I barely knew, it's just the right thing to do.

Honestly if you're just trying to get the diary kill, if the blue phase pops up first (after the initial spawn phase) log out. It will reset you at the dock and you can go back in. The other 3 rotations are a lot easier to learn as you aren't switching gear every phase for the beginning and take a lot less unavoidable damage from range attack rng.

You just go a tbow with a random group you've been raiding with for the day.
---
Do you share it?
---
Fucking called it
---
Love it
---
Seriously so awesome! Zuhaar, your work is incredible
---
A RuneScape wedding cake. Uh what
---
you were using the wrong weapon. Craw's bow is more powerful than tbow at chaos elemental, chainmace is more powerful than tbow at vet'ion
---
Too true and sad :( I got a rune bando's platebody from a clue scroll and I was excited for 2 seconds until I realised it was worth more to HA it.... 
---
Since I've been doing some higher level slayer tasks I've been High alching drops 15 year old me would go crazy about.
---
I think magic has a really good place as PVP and processing skill, whereas range has none of this, it's only used as attack
---
Imagine real life gaming
---
Where?
---
Well you are a sad selfish shit
---
I think you can account share it just cannot benefit you gp wise at all.
---
Best one I’ve seen on here so far. Shit still has me laughing, writing this
---
I miss playing this game when i had no idea what was going on , now everythings about ehp
---
No, bots function by hacking the game data to know what’s loaded on your game  chunk and where (trees, doors, farming patches - everything), what’s in your inventory etc. runelite uses the exact same methods to get data as bots do. The only difference is runelite doesn’t generate clicks by default or come with scripts to do so.
---
This is fucking hilarious, going to jail for thinking you're edgy
---
If they nerf blowpipe by reducing it by 1 tick, crossbows will always be better.
---
10 mining clients is definitely more effort than 1 zulrah and you probably couldn't do that on any PC. 
---
If you're talking about the stats, well 85 mining is slow as shit it'd probably take you around the same time it takes getting 75 range/mage and the questing done.
---
Why hasn’t RS3 implemented a poll system? Is it something the community doesn’t want or the developers?
---
it looks like clay to me
---
Stronghold of Security told us not too.
---
Bless this high quality meme.
---
"What don't you like about it?"
---
"NO."
---
How about let's just delete osrs and bring back the actual peak the game was in, which is 2011?
---
Sad, but true. PVP updates are just simply spite votes no. It’s frustrating.
---
I didnt really see his comment as offensive. 
---
The "relax" seemed to be a genuine "dont worry, we aren't going to see astronomical changes to its price any time soon".
---
Buy all normal logs
---
The same rewards as they were in 2011, obviously.
---
Is Jagex getting kickbacks in order not to ban gold farmers?
---
You’ll get it eventually! I believe in you. :D
---
Sorry about your husband lol
---
Mithril crossbow is called like a mith crossbow or something on the ge, its there its just like a weird spelling
---
It’s just compensating for the state of rs3 pvm - you use ranged at probably like 2 bosses and magic can be used just about everywhere.
---
It came out in rs2 and was one of the reasons the game, even in f2p, was at it's peak.
---
My alternative would be introduce Fist of Guthix. But with an extra room for non combat players and pures so they can low/high alching cheap items for reward points and not gold. ( Fist of Guthix gives you free runes to use). Warding was never about being fun it was being gold sink bring back value to items this is both.
---
I was actually excited when they lowered General Graardors magic level (so that tbow wasn't BiS there), and then magic was a viable method to kill it. Unfortunately that didn't last very long when they added high magic defense to counteract that.
---
What are those curved grey things in your inventory?
---
not if they're two trees..
---
Wow I forgot about swift kit man the good old days.
---
These are the quality memes I've come to expect from this sub.
---
Could definitely be.
---
Yep but they are like 1/1k drop rate.
---
Oh wow I never really thought about it this way. What a weird feedback loop.
---
I imagine its not thaaat hard because its usually like 10-100mil for free, and one player is doing this multiple times.
---
Is lowering magic level really that important? Seems like lowering defence would be more noticable, in which case there is claws of guthix.
---
What’s a die-dum
---
If we want 2 years of no content so they can work on it.
---
Goodbye.
---
''This doesn't feel Old School...''
---
Keep it moving shithead
---
1/1k per item slot so the effective drop rate is 1/250 or 1/333. So I'm well over the double drop rate either way youbloon at it...
---
Warding bad
---
Slayer good
---
You need to drop then telegrab an untrimmed cape to keep it untrimmed.
---
"Tingz" we'd love to have you, very chill, always talkative and friendly, helpful people, always looking to do group activities. Hope to see you there. I'm "K0tov", wont be on til later though so if you want I'll let you know when I'll be on.

Just 20 bucks? We gotta get some of that European health care.
---
I read it 3 times before I realised what was wrong. I think I am going to go to bed now.
---
you can safespot them. it's gonna suck but unless you wanna skip you dont really have any options. at least you dont get assigned a huge amount
---
I think there would be more use if the game boards were incorporated into PoHs as a piece of usable furniture. World 30 houses are already higher traffic than Burthrope and it'd makes sense thematically to include them in the PoH games room as another hotspot.
---
Bloody brilliant.
---
This is amazing dude
---
Sure 10m for each of the other guys. No way in hell are some randoms getting full split. Fuck i wouldnt even expect that much from a random
---
love this lmao
---
You can go to burthope slayer master and do a task with him which ends your current one, but it resets your point streak.
---
Not really the point tho is it?
---
Gotta be inclusive, apparently.
---
You are correct. But most people bought the flax, since it was more cash/h to just spin than flax &amp; spin
---
I said *if* you don't have anguish, torture, and rigour, then *at least* bring a boot switch to increase DPS.
---
I'm suggesting a bunch of downgrade that still work, apparently I didn't make that clear enough.
---
Again, I'm perfectly aware that camping prims and switching the neck is the best way to go. *If you don't have a neck switch,* then switch boots instead if you are using void because you're poor or an iron or something.
---
This has got to be a deliberate suicide, right? His inventory is completely devoid of supplies??
---
Right there with you
---
Well the list of what type of new skill players really want is running thin. (unless you're keeping suggestions from us?)
---
I guess we'll both disagree on each other no matter what, but at least you can't tell me that Wintertodtmaking is a good skill, and this would be a sweet solution?
---
Also wouldn't the lamps be a cool addition as an offensive magic item? Should Warding not pass polls I think those at least would be a cool addition.
---
Thematically it makes sense that the Burthrope games room would have games
---
Agreeed just did regicide and DT for the first times recently. DT was a breeze compared to regicide. Fuck regicide
---
99 Str 99 mag
---
Honestly never knew they were light on the buyers. I feel like that would help, but lots of people would still do it on new accounts where there's very little risk. If an account with little time invested gets banned, that person won't care that much (I imagine they don't care that much about their IRL money either).
---
I feel like people with a lot of time invested in the game aren't gonna buy gold, but who knows.
---
Desert goat horns. I collect them to buy kebabs and beer.
---
In next update let's make sure that we have alchemy autoalch all noted items in inventory, and let's make it so if you click on a certain type of a rock, your character will always target that type of rock and mine automatically while you do absolutely nothing.  
---
  
---
While we're at it, let's publicly announce that botting is alright because this game is just too hard.
---
Just blood you can easily safespot him and just trident/blood barrage for health. Personally before I started my huge slayer grind I rushed out fremmy elites for guaranteed profit on dks tasks. I think it was worth it but it is a long grind.
---
36m hunter xp. no chin pet
---
Didnt they remove the crystal armour for melee and put it in for range? What kind of shit was that
---
All clans are cancer
---
this would've been a bopper meme in 2013 though back when runecrafting made you minted
---
&gt;your magic level counts for 70% of your magic defence
---
The same discord that did zmi does lavas and strals now
---
most bosses are actually relatively guaranteed. vorkath, zulrah, etc all have consistent gp per kill. only applies to older content where they were more strict with that balance like gwd
---
is there an original picture to this?
---
not sure if you're sarcastic or not
---
The log out after the dude gave you veng runes had me dying
---
Yea true. Voting no to all pvp updates and new skills really made this game amazing.
---
I never did pvp in my life but its a nuisance to get killled in pvp.
---
Alching can easily be profitable if you buy the right items
---
Why do you care so much about pixels? That sounds equally pathetic
---
Comes from rs3 where magic is bis for endgame bosses. I was expecting 2011scape where meleescape was at the top my face when I found out the dps of the blow pipe 🤷‍♂️
---
Has anyone else had managing miscellania on runelite glitch where you can't allocate the full 10 workers to a task? It seems to think I've done royal trouble and 67% of my workers is the most I can assign to one resource but I haven't and it's not showing the extra ~3 workers  that are Idle because of this.
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
Nah, the polling system just makes it so the lowest brow content gets passed way easier while interesting but controversial content never passes. But controversial content includes quests, minigames, anything not slayer and slayer bosses.
---
That's why OSRS has kept pace with RS3 PvM wise and is somewhere in the 2012-2014 era of 
---
#EOC
---
When it's supposed to be oldschool runescape. Because players are braindead and will vote yes to whatever PvM or slayer or slayer boss that's put in front of them. Literally anything. Meanwhile no other area of the game gets even half of that "success".
---
&gt; I love Dung, probably more than most.
---
Hey man, you do you. Whatever makes you happy.
---
Anyone who says burthorpe games room is dead content has no friends who like playing board games
---
T bow?
---
Give up. But people are too stupid to see, and think they are in control of the game because of the polling system lmao. They don't realize Jagex is the safety net, not the players voting.
---
Why
---
rune dragon alt is pretty much the primary way to generate gold. it's a pretty steady 1.6-1.9m/hr and reasonably afk. combat experience is actually relatively worthless, you are better off to abuse 20 min afk nmz while not playing the game for all of your melees and prioritize slayer exp through barraging and spec transfer etc. if you are doing slayer and prioritizing slayer tasks that give good melee experience you'll probably take 3-5x longer to achieve the same amount of slayer exp it's pretty terrible in the current meta.
---
now we need more of these
---
I'm not saying every single argument he presents is perfect, but I want to point out that there's more to the discussion than "new skills bad." 
---
Also I think it's a bit of a reach to say that herblore, runecrafting, and construction would fit into crafting as simply as warding could fit into crafting and runecrafting, or that hunter with fishing or slayer with "combat" would work. 
---
Also, wouldn't something simple like a name change prove that alternatives are wanted by the community, and it's not just a blind no vote to every new skill?
---
The idea that no one will vote for an update to runecrafting that increases xp gains is covered in the post as well. It says in that section: Making magical robes and armour could offer pitifully low xp and instead be about the process of actually acquiring the robes themselves. The unique aspect is the reward, not an alternative training method." Is this not a reasonable compromise?
---
Dhcb does less dps at vorkath too though
---
Q
---
Yeah I've been having the same problem the last few weeks.
---
Screw the negativity my guy wicked cake wicked wife have a good life 👍
---
My policy is I give half back. The half I keep is my reward, and their lesson to be more careful.
---
They can go and goldfarm on other games. PoE is less strict on it and if youre smart you can make way more money
---
wake up the next morning w a new name wearing some whack fashionscape logged on a f2p world
---
Okay I got a good laugh out of that thank you, I’ve been seeing the crab thing for awhile now and it became funny just from seeing it so much but now I get it, thanks!
---
It should be a skill, minigames dies way too fast.
---
Great video, I’ll be sure to try out astrals again
---
Reason why parks and rec is awesome.
---
Wat?
---
Raids 3 = Dungeoneering? Ice theme?
---
Temple trek book.
---
Ive heard that before but where is this information from?
---
Any status update after that?
---
Definetely. One month JaGex nerf birdhouses because they crash the price of brews. Next month, they give Konar a 2500 brew drop? How is that even a question?
---
it does all of them
---
Finally a use for firemaking.
---
The old world selector is so nostalgic. wow
---
World 29 &lt;3
---
The same thing I do every day u/Pops_rustafied: grind runecrafting.
---
You most likely have to use a proxy to mask your location as a longterm solution. 
---
False bans are very common when playing in CN/Vene, especially if you play in heavily botted areas or F2P.
---
That's not what I meant.
---
With slayer, you're often forced through mediocre tasks like fire giants and hellhounds (until 91)
---
 You most likely have to use a proxy to mask your location as a longterm solution.
---
blind ignorance from the masses triggers the fuck out of me, yup
---
Just like its misleading polling the attack range of weapons! They should poll it on longrange!! HURR FUCKING DURR
---
Magic is meta at Vorkath you need crumble undead /s
---
oh dear
---
Gt Mustang? May be an iron woman.
---
S
---
wrong hands!!
---
Your fault for not being an ironman :p
---
I’m not reading this entire thing and you weren’t even responding to me but Jagex has released 6? 5? quests (including this grandmaster) already this year.
---
An idiot who bank stands all day and brags. Seen many people post about him being a dick lick.
---
Magic is still viable at graardor. Best method on graardor is still ACB though.
---
To be fair as many posts there are that are constructive there are still a decent amount that are just “NO WARDING BAD”. I literally had someone tell me to go play another game just because I said I’d be excited for new content (referring to warding) without saying any reason as to why it isn’t a good thing. 
---
And of course that’s a few people, not the whole community, but those people influence more people and make people feel less inclined to share their own opinion.
---
We’re not ignorant though (or most of us aren’t). We know it’s hard to create good bot detection, but that doesn’t mean we can’t criticize it.
---
Rune or amethyst arrows with msb I already kind of fill that niche though and darts are just a cheaper lower exp option
---
Just focus solely on slayer, if you do it properly should net you around. 300m to 85/90. You’ll train all your combat stats as well. Sure you can make 400k ph now but save it for later and make 3mp/h at Vork. That’s 7 hours saved per hour technically as opposed to doing low level content like green dragons. Get barrows gloves, reqs for mm2 and ds2, just train slayer. Vork through blue dragons demonics through demons. You’ll get to sire, thermy, hydra with super high stats and be able to do every piece of pvm with ease and a large bank. 
---
If you’re making 400kp/h killing dragons and vork is 3mp/h, it’ll take you 7.5 hour to make what you’d make in 1 hour at vork. 7.5 hours is insane. 99 slayer atm over 2k total, quest cape, etc. Don’t even know how big my bank is atm, probably 2-4b atm, all slaying.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Actually my bank is more like 1m tyvm
---
“GL on your adventures” tucking lmao
---
Lmfao this is great. Nice tracking on the frisbees too lol
---
This wouldnt happen at Vetion or Callisto? You're a moron lol
---
Because runecrafting turns into an exercise in mining a rock that never depletes
---
thank you so much.
---
Surprised how everyone has read over it all this time.
---
Yup
---
Bp is dirt cheap and bis at 90+% of all pvm content. You can literally get a bp on average in under 20 hours of low effort, easy pvm. T bow is insane at certain places, but those places are far, far more limited than they are for bp. Not only that, but if you're doing 30 minute, 35k point solo raids, t bow is on average a 500 hour grind, ignoring gear time and scouting. If you're doing 3 man or 4 raids, that time can easily go up to 800+ hours. That's 20 hours of a boss you can learn in an hour vs 500 hours minimum of a boss that takes hundreds of hours to learn (if you're soloing).
---
Slayer does seem like a great long term money maker. I just have to take the plunge
---
You would also make the monster significantly less likely to hit you. How about  no
---
Hmmm interesting. That’s a good way to think about it. Currently I got about 20m laying around so I can’t quite get there  but I also know my attacking the monsters while cannoning  will drastically affect your calculations... I might just throw 10m in cballs and see where that gets me
---
All you need are some new unreadable cosmetics or supplies as rewards and you can make it a popular again I’m sure of it. There’s just no reason to right now.
---
Huh. I always thought the lumberyard came with construction
---
Wow lol
---
A low mid level raid is a stupid concept. CoX is already pretty accessible and a lower level raid would probably end up not being worth the time as it's gonna be outshined by the two higher raids and just will be smashed by high levels anyways. If you want to do high level pvm like raids you just gotta get the stats.
---
And if we take ironmemes into consideration? Not that the game should be balanced/ favoured for their needs, but Rune- and amethyst arrows are quite high level content without the use of a GE
---
🦀🦀🦀 LolAnti doesn't hide poll results🦀🦀🦀
---
Even though it's underlined in red lol. Maybe an extra arrow and a circle would help
---
was it freetorvesta?
---
so offer valid criticism, not "its bad and they should throw more money/people at it".
---
Thats not criticism. thats just complaining.
---
what do you recommend my hitpoints to stay at
---
No luck? How?
---
blacking out the N on the compass made me lose my shit lmao
---
Wait that's illegal
---
Things aren't balanced around price, price is balanced around the item. T bow and scythe should be the best weapons in the game, and for what they work on they are. Bp, on the other hand, shouldn't be nearly as good as it is.
---
Clicking the clerk is more efficient. You can bank one tile further with the clerk, but you have to be next to the desk.
---
Best scene adaptation I’ve seen yet. Love it.
---
I meant in the game itself, but people don't seem to notice in the post either.
---
I responded to you with quotations and in sections. But how would you know you didn't even read the whole thing which is reasonable. I don't expect the average OSRS player to be able to read a 2 minute reply. But my points are there for whoever will.
---
And yes. There is a questing turnaround. 3 quests so far this year (2019) with a fourth announced. It's better than the 0 we got from 2013-2016 (pre monkey madness 2).
---
you could. There is a guy who has a firecape with 18 combat. obviously that's an outlier, but you can def do it with your stats. if you have bp it'll be even easier.
---
Only noticed it myself on my third task. Kind of interesting how the brain subconsciously skips over duplicate words like that
---
Ty, why don’t you do the math on three 1/512 drops in 38 kills...douche
---
This has been me in Motherlode Mine all week.  Its actually impressive.  And no, I don't have high enough to go up stairs yet.
---
While I think range IS over-represented in the game's meta in terms of its usefulness, I don't think Song of the Elves is the place to make that change.
---
The elves are most well known for their ranged abilities (with a bit of melee). I think forcing magic in there would be a bad choice from a lore perspective.
---
Again, I think there needs to be a change, but I don't think Song of the Elves is the place to do it.
---
Corp. Kbd, kq, Vetion, callisto, venenatis. Scorpia. CoX. All gwd bosses. Giant mole
---
You really need more?????
---
You can pay the first time what you scammed to be taken off. Most clans will privately keep a list of scammers to avoid this. If you scam a second time its permanent I think. As for blackmailing im not sure but you do need evidence to submit a case so...
---
I just am not interested in the rest of the information. Just saw the quests and figured I’d make a point about how they’re doing better with it now.
---
dude you're also here playing this game stfu
---
Something about having another skill is just so triggering to people
---
Settled killed ~20k shamans no war hammer.
---
No, I’m not 10. I’ve just never gotten anything like this before
---
I've done the task quite a few times as well, but never noticed it either. Then again, I don't really read the game chat that often.
---
Haha. Yoy thought you could fool me but I, like the extremely intelligent being I obviously am, instantly noticed that it says 'Giant sea snake' in the top left corner! 
---
Nobody gets past my sharp senses.
---
&gt; MSG AAF MA
---
Good to see rs spreading the word against the evils of msg
---
Fire strike in salad robes w/ combat bracelet.
---
MINE?!
---
Yeah true i meant the utility/processing part
---
Chaotic rapier didn't cost 3k a shot to reach that DPS tho...
---
Some people just want to keep training rather than wait 4 hours to continue. The only time you should be skeptical is if they are trying to make you buy a lot of really specific, useless items like steel dagger (p+), they could log out and you are left with an item that wont sell unless you put it for like 5gp each even though you might have bought it for 2k each, for example.
---
Am I aloud to get this as a tattoo? Serious
---
Unless i zoned out for all 4000 kills with trident/pipe, then trident does the majority of the damage
---
Interesting, I did not know that. Haven't seen the DPS calcs since that update. Thanks for letting me know!
---
memed
---
I aint gonna wish you luck coz mine clearly sucks
---
Were you around to experience first-hand the events of 2007 and the effect it had on the playerbase? If so, I'm sure you can appreciate players being apprehensive towards updates.
---
I’m pretty sure I was right behind you at this point lol was blown away with that one..
---
\#TRU
---
ToB is boring and the gp/hr isn't 4x worse. it's like 7-9m/hr at CoX compared to like 12-14m/hr at ToB
---
I used Mouse Recorder. Alch in a place where you wont get reported and dont do it for insane amounts of time straight and you should be good
---
Wouldn't it make more sense to make the magic rebalance a low to mid level content piece? I don't see why you'd want it locked in the endgame.
---
Also, the logic of "if they don't put the rebalance in the VERY NEXT update, then they shouldn't have made it the next update" is absurd.
---
You dont need to hunt to see reposts, there was a post like this yesterday
---
Not made enough gp from green dragons? Straight to jail
---
That's a good point.  Venge could hit a 59+, if you get hit by one single attack that does 76+.  In pvp, thats p much only possible with ags, though I could be missing something since Im a pvmfag.  Even then, they'd have to ags spec your venge, and you're probably close to dead if not dead.
---
God I hope this makes front page. This is to good. Good job.
---
Good luck, let us know how you get on!
---
Not to get his hits in for poison. The point stands
---
What do you mean? I initially thought it was the the plurality but I still don't get it
---
So then disregard that reply? You're so autistic. You're mad that you jumped into the middle of a conversation and expected me to completely ignore the context of the entire conversation to only evaluate you're one elevated point "but der r quests now". "HOW DARE YOU TAKE THE ENTIRE CONTEXT OF THE CONVERSATION INTO YOUR REPLY I JUST REPLIED TO YOU!!!"
---
"I literally only wanted to bring up that quests have been added to the game at a much better rate this year and you want to turn it into a whole ass argument."
---
Yes, and I replied to this statement, which you still haven't replied to btw.
---
&gt;Nah buddy just go be mad on another thread or something.
---
Cya hick
---
I’m sure there are several reasons but one is that prices fluctuate pretty regularly throughout the year getting highest in the summer and around Christmas because more people are playing
---
Maybe like a month or 5 weeks, I didnt always play every day though
---
I
---
Too similar to RS3? Fail
---
*doubt*
---
Warding is built on shaky foundations, variations of it aren’t going to make it any less rickety.
---
Dungeoneering was peak scape for me. Before they did RS3 I was having a blast bc it would involve all skills
---
Hell yea brother
---
Kudos to you OP, this was brilliant.
---
Thanks
---
True but it can all be negated with a tbow which was sorta OP’s point
---
Yes please
---
You can still hit above an opponents max hp. It will only show the actual damage done though. Nothing about chances to hit is affected by your opponents hp
---
Just a weird sequence of events for me...
---
Going dry on Berserker at Rex so decided to finish task in catacombs.
---
Did hard clue from Rex before finishing task and got Sara d’hide boots. First god d’hide boots, so finally replaced the snakeskins in the bank. 
---
Got medium from catacombs. Took maximum steps to complete. Sara boots immediately replaced by rangers I guess...
---
Oh and the drunken dwarf came along right after so I had a beer to celebrate.
---
calling it "lego" may not be the best idea
---
You replied to my quest point by saying “There has been a questing turnaround” soooo... why are you still trying to argue? 
---
You’re replying to me with these long bricks of text like this is a debate or something. I just wanted to bring up/ correct your point about the lack of quests and what they’re doing to fix it and you’re acting like I have to read every other point in your original essay and reply to all of them.
---
The problem isn't in the fact that blowpipe costs alot to use. 
---
The problem is blowpipe fucking exists in its current broken state
---
Somebody pointed out that, despite having very high requirements, it is still viable to mage after the update.
---
Scythe is definitely also on my list of OP weapons that have no business being in the game.
---
more of this pls
---
back in the day when i first got membs, i thought the prayer "smite" looked cool, so i invested all my money to get 60 prayer, then renamed my account "wow 60 pray". i would walk around membs world with it on to show off to the noobs lol. good times, good times
---
I love how farming contracts are literally the proposal for Artisan and are universally beloved yet Artisan itself failed. Some people *really* just don't want to have to train another skill even if they like and would use everything in it.
---
Insert Admiral Ackbar Quote
---
&gt;The absolute length and animosity in all of your replies so far tells me exactly what kind of player you are. “Jagex updates are bad ree! Quests are lazy!! But doric’s quest and imp catcher fine because nostalgia!” &gt;:(
---
That's me.
---
&gt;You weren’t even responding to me in the first place. I just wanted to correct your assertion that they’re basically ignoring quests when this year they’ve turned that around.
---
Wrong. Completely acknowledge em.
---
&gt;While you think the quests are “lazy” their goal is to bring more players in the game and they don’t get there by releasing 10 master-grandmaster quests a year. New players need that content to get them to stay.

This thinking is completely obtuse. I can't explain why though because then it wouldn't be normal if I explained myself, so I'll keep it short. every quest no need to be grandmaster. every quest no need to be big quest. small quest fun. small quest build world. small thing add make game feel big. quest create memory. grind grind grind make grug bored.
---
&gt;These “lazy” quests are the most fun. Let’s me explore a new area and learn about it while not being completely fucking annoying like Underground Pass and MM2.
---
Me agree with former, latter not so much. Let both exist but more of former like old days.
---
Does anyone else think that wrath rune xp is underwhelming? they give less xp per hour than bloods and require a significantly higher RC level, as well as being far more focus intensive.
---
Was the original drop table even polled?

Surprised he didn't get charged with assault with a deadly weapon for nearly cutting the Officer with all his edge!

Is is worth the inventory slot to bring a blowpipe to spec for heal at vorkath if you are using dhcb?
---
C'mon bruh you know we don't use official clients around here
---
Can we please put less focus on ~~Ranging in~~ PvM content?
---
Thanks for the constructive feedback
---
And also that the OSRS devs have a pretty good grasp on what people want and don’t want. I think part of the reason polls have such a high passing percentage is because the devs aren’t going to put a poll up on something they know people won’t want.
---
hello everybody, some of you might have seen my previous post where I got a dragon pickaxe on kc 468 while going for the tyrannical ring. well, 612 kills further into the grind we finally got it. At kc 1019 my first HCIM dieed to fools, after this I decided to make a new HCIM and grind it to be callisto ready. 61 kills into the new HCIM I got the ring. As far as I know this should be the first tyrannical ring out there.

idk but you'll also need a fire cape if you don't already know
---
People compare it to rs3s daily system. In rs3 you get dailies that are active for 5 days. You get xp and sometimes even a supply drop.
---
I believe artisan could have been amazing. The dailies make me do random "dead content" for some extra xp. Have you ever made curry in rs? I have now because I had to make 150 curry for a daily. It also gave me like ~30-40k extra xp But that bit could be revamped for artisan
---
Joel moved to discord dude.
---
If you would do the "evil daves bug day out" quest in rs3 you would know that she is very overprotective and horrible. You can read the quest guide from wiki TL;DR you swap bodies with evil dave in that quest.
---
Make them into keychains! My Lego Gandalf keychain just lost his last limb last week. So time for something new!

Yes, that is the official RuneLite site, you are safe to download from there.

Spoken like someone who’s never had a tbow - it’s just the beginning.

I got this today :/
---
I love the idea of having randomly generated dungeons to explore with a boss/loot throughout the level, but I don't think dungeoneering should be it.
---
I think instead there should be a collection of areas, each in a unique area of the game, that would be quest-locked or miniquest-locked. This would be similar to how Ratcatchers works. And each area would have unique rewards and challenges. Examples being, a dense forest area in the elven lands that has obstacles and monsters that require decent woodcutting, firemaking, fletching, herblore, agility and maybe crafting levels to navigate. A cavernous rocky area in Keldagrim that requires mining, smithing, construction, strength to get through with a special importance placed on firemaking to keep a light going.
---
hilarious vid, loved it. Some constructive criticism: get to the action within the first 15 seconds of the video
---
What gear did you use for Cerb?  I am almost 91 slayer and plan on attempting him.
---
yes
---
I just wish the extremely major changes to how everyone will play the game at all levels (like the GE) were implemented differently, or looked at more closely when the votes are close. I know some people prefer the game with the GE (and that's fine), but that was actually my RuneScape killer. IronMan is alright, but I wish I could play in an economy that doesn't include the feature, and I don't have adrenaline coursing through my veins when I do anything (DMM).
---
Most games get around systems being completely OP like this by adding a fee per transaction, a penalty for using such a powerful service. RS just doesn't though, and it makes the game incredibly boring for me.
---
To me RS is about exploration and diversity, the GE shreds that to bits as almost everything is accessible in one spot. The most profit I can make for a massive chunk of my player's life will be in the GE. This also crushes player interaction while looking for certain things. Just feels so pointless to me. Not saying I hate OSRS, I do consider it significantly better than EOC (miles ahead of it), but I don't enjoy anything other than DMM or IronMan in its current state.
---
Funny meme though (and well made), even though I feel the vast majority of players will vote in content that makes the game vastly easier, and seems to be the exact same direction we headed pre-EOC anyways. Games should caiter to quality, and that's usually the core audience if they want a high quality game. The current voting system caiters to everyone, and casual players who just want to quickly grab content are the most common players on planet Earth, which will certainly make JaGex quite a lot of money, usually for quite a while too. Just my $0.02.
---
Good thing this is OSRS and not RS3 then eh mate?
---
i love underpass because it stands out from the rest as a very dark and morbid quest which reflects in both lore and gameplay. 
---
dangerous dungeon from start to finish with traps and other elements that give the vibe as if the game is trying to fuck with you; the story and gameplay reflect and reinforce eachother.
---
How have I never seen this, is it the extended edition??
---
Por que no los dos
---
you have 75 ranged, blowpipe makes it significantly faster
---
Ghrazi rapier is 89 strength, Chaotic is 101 strength.  Basically Chaotic gives 3 extra max hits but comes with a repair cause while Ghrazi does not.
---
awesome, thank you!
---
You're a fool, you could have been dyeing black robe tops with purple dye for faster cash
---
Wraths are good for gp, I think they’re fine
---
they were supposed to be a money making method not an xp method but the community voted to put them on pvm drop tables so now its bad for both.
---
yeah, seemed worthy
---
Dunno if OS will have continuity for evil dave. Wouls be nice to see where it heads
---
Like I said, the way you reply tells me exactly what kind of player you are and honestly what kind of person. You could shorten all of your normal posts by 2/3 if you just didn’t include so many unnecessary sentences. You elaborate on things that don’t need to be elaborated on. 
---
Regardless, the quests they’ve released this year have been small, medium, and soon large with the new elf quest (regarding length). 
---
Edit: Short, medium, long*
---
I’m not sure what you’re getting at because you seem to be unable to type out a reply that’s a reasonable length without being a child
---
Introduce all previous backups as ironman style private servers. For the low low cost of 80€ (price can be what ever jagex makes it). This would include possibly your favorite year what ever it is. Hardest part for jagex would be to optimize them, and fit them to singleplayer offline version.
---
Lol no
---
Even worse
---
Who the fuck has a 1:49 pb at 3kc what the fuck.
---
To be fair, that could work just like how you level up your roles in Barb Assault.
---
I feel like alternating is the best bet? One pulls the other up faster that way, like level attack until you get a new weap, then switch to str until its matched with attack, then switch back and repeat.
---
newer quests definitely tend more towards being convenient and streamlined, while the older sacrifice that for more a more 'immersive' because it makes you interact (point and click) more.
---
can't say which one i like more
---
I more meant a BIS weapon. Rapier was the holy grail for a time.
---
maybe new prayers range/mage tank armour its hard 2 think of somethign that would actually be comparable 2 power creap weapons from rs3 which would serve a niche but not be a powercreap
---
Chatosrs or RS Generals are new clanchats I hop around in. In game name is vMarlon
---
Gold farming isn't whats against the rules right?
---
It's the fact that they're rwt the gold they farm. Which is a lot harder to catch.
---
It's not like they're botting the gold. They're legit players up untill the point they trade the gold for real money. Which is where they break the rules technically
---
The wiki states that the Chaos Elemental has no weaknesses at all. The fact that using Craw's Bow was once again the "best" option just proves the very thing this post is getting at. How about the 3 weapons that were SPECIFICALLY designed to be exceptionally powerful only in the Wilderness be more powerful than the Tbow in the Wilderness?

Even though, doesnt this still kind of skip some of his progress in the game? I feel like if he earned the gear himself, it would feel a lot more rewarding
---
Is it just me or does it should Mike three rs3 prif with the supreme potions, agility shortcuts and the slayer dung, not to mention the crystal trees and armours
---
Pretty easy is an opinion. A decent amount of people still don't have the time to put towards the game to even get base 60 really. Something that requires skills of like 50 even would be great for the game just to give lower leveled people more options to enjoy this great game. Fun shouldn't always be locked behind hours and hours of grinding.
---
&gt;t’s the fact that you can get one of the best weapons in the game (blowpipe) very easily with little cost. Whereas crystal bow is locked behind a shit ton of quests and is much worse then blowpipe
---
??
---
&gt;By the time you are gonna be able do content that has been balanced as end game content you have already spend so much time on your account that getting another quest is pretty much nothing in comparism.
---
For endgame content blowpipe is locked behind high cost to use and crystal bow is a free item from a quest that you already have anyways.
---
The requirements are simply meaningless if you are at a state where you care about high end pvm, because either you already completed them for other things or the time needed to complete the quests would be irrelevant compared to the time you already put into your account.
---
The real mvp
---
I think raids 3 and desert treasure 2 will give mage some love, raids 3 will prob give a mage weapon similar to the levels of tbow and scythe.
---
Yes you can, you need to create it via some snail stuff. Wiki it
---
Different game meta shifts, though, substantially. Contracts being an alternate way to train one skill is not the same thing as Artisan being the meta for training every skill.
---
Well no, asking someone to give you high ticket items is begging. It would be a question if phrased as; “Would someone give me advice on how to get a dexterous prayer scroll?”
---
Ooh didn’t hide your compass direction. Thnx for acc m8. (Gz on pet)
---
Wasn't that supposed to be Mage Arena 2 where they could only be damaged by God Spells? And then they just made Tbow work there anyway because fuck all combat styles that aren't ranged?
---
Lol
---
Indeed! I haven’t looked as to why that is though.
---
tbow is only bis for sara tho

Guantlet.
---
I recently started rs3 just to play dungeoneering and it's a lot of fun. If it was added as a skill I honestly wouldn't mind. It's a cool concept, but the rewards are a bit overpowered.
---
But as OP says, you don't log in with the account email for old accounts? Or can you do both? My acc has an old username and I never tried using the e-mail. Does that work?
---
Yeah but on the other side, if you want a Lance you need the 80M up front which means you need to make that amount of money and then also have that money locked up in to a single item while you're using it and still have the capital to support the rest of your gear setup. In the case of the Blowpipe you can start using it with a small initial investment and then spread the actual cost of it over a long period of time over which you can do activities that earn you a lot more money than the expense And the entire time you're using it, you only have like 5m locked up in to the actual Blowpipe itself meaning that most midlevel accounts will have lots of capital left over to still have an actual bank. The same logic behind buying houses and cars using mortgages/loans versus paying for them entirely in cash.
---
Why???
---
The money snake 💸
---
It's not about balancing them persay it's just to give them some small neich, and the game has few options for crush weapons options but yes there are things like the dwh to consider.
---
Yeah why TF would people play this game outside of Tob. Just a big ole waste of time...
---
Like what's fun right? That's not a thing haha
---
If you get the Xerics Honour item from raids, does the tp unlock for that specific talisman? Or is it unlocked for every talisman thereafter (including POH)?
---
I laughed too hard
---
&gt; The wilderness has always been about the highest risk versus the highest reward
---
Right there, that's the issue. 
---
The wilderness WAS about PVP. About people who wanted to kill other people, attacking each other. Those days are nearly dead.
---
Now most "PVP" in the wilderness is killing naked people for spades, or chin hunters hoping they're afk and don't release their chins, or people killing revs in &lt;50k worth of gear, or 3+1 item flinching chaos ely, etc.
---
The wilderness has changed. Edge PVP is waaaay smaller now than it used to be. Mage bank PVP is dead. Wildy clan PVP is dead. 
---
People **are not** complaining about the risk, because there's already virtually no risk. People are complaining about the annoyance that Jagex only adds content to the wilderness to try and lure in people who have no interest in actually fighting another player, as fodder for others entertainment.
---
If you want to rejuvenate the wilderness, stop changing what it's about.
---
Why do people like you refute everything somebody says just to look superior? It's really obnoxious. Refute the points you seriously disagree with, but you don't have to shit on 100% of what someone says for the sake of it.
---
I mean maybe if if they didnt have you added and didnt care to know who you are but in that case were they even your friends?
---
Lmao what, OSRS ia in the best state it's ever been in. The game right now is amazing.
---
68-92 is pretty huge, you should probably get pots and an ammy
---
Even just a sit-until-you-move emote would be nice, I feel. It's not like they need to make new animations - just steal the home tele one!
---
They are. There is no wilderness boss where tbow is bis, but chainmace is only bis against some of them
---
You're also gettting mad that a weapon specifically designed to do high damage against high magic bosses is dealing high damage against a high damage monster
---
Devalues my unsymmetrical location only ironman
---
What brainlet uses accurate at sara
---
I hope so. It would be interesting if doing Desert Treasure 2 would be required to even start Raids 3. Magic should play a HUGE role in raids 3. Let Raids 3 please be seperate from Raids 1 and 2 in the sense that not having a Tbow and scythe is okay to actually do the raid. And let Raids 3 have a pyramid setting!
---
Anyone know which episode this was?
---
This scene never fails to make me laugh out loud. Love it!
---
Isn’t tbow better than arclight anyways
---
raising prayer costs money, and I dont like spending money
---
"wc lvl?"
---
I had a feeling that you were the same person who made the Swamplet(h)ics gif! I decided to start watching Swampletics after you posted that.
---
I think the best money fishing is sacred eels, infernal eals, and angler fish in that order. But I could be forgetting something. Nmz is really good AFK combat xp. Bursting/chinning in monkey madness 2 cave is faster xp but costs a lot. Pretty sure nmz is still best for melee.
---
Is marriage like a 99, where the fireworks pop up when you say I do?
---
Your example is about an item that could never be justified no matter what requirements you gave to using or acquiring that item. Sure upfront cost can't make that item balanced, but neither can stat requirements, so by your logic stat requirements also bear very little on balancing, so we can just make all equipment require level 1.
---
Clearly you haven't shown that the upfront cost of an item has very little bearing on balancing, and in fact most people would say it does, after all most people would agree an item you can buy from a shop for 30k shouldn't be as good as the abyssal whip. A large part of the game is acquiring rare and valuable items from monsters, and the rare and more valuable an item is, the more powerful it can be to a reasonable extent (it can't justify god-level items that would hit 99s every time, but it can certainly justify getting more powerful stuff like the abyssal whip over dragon scimitar/dragon longsword).
---
Not sure about the crafting guild tp, but I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DPohmID52w) comparing lunar (no diary) vs CW (with diary) not too long ago. Might want to check it out? I dunno.
---
Hmm, that really sucks. Have you appealed it?
---
Only other thing I could say is try doing some quests making some in game friends and not doing things that bots tend to do (long play sessions just mining or green dragons).
---
It might be a long shot but you could try tweeting mod ash etc.
---
The VPN you used, was it by any chance a free one? Maybe it’s well recognised by jagex? 
---
Either way, hope you get there
---
he eat ur mum lol
---
I use same exact cursor on RuneLite, its a classic
---
Fake. No spade
---
Cox is already an improved version of dungeoneering..
---
Best range tank gear imo, dragonhide could be Bandos
---
It literally saves you 1 or MAYBE 2 game ticks at best. Not worth it imo.
---
Would this be a team that possibly works?
---
Amen. People say range is OP, but is the content that is imbalanced to  benefit range.
---
When we are discussing what is BiS, yes you are correct stat requirements don't enter the discussion at all.
---
Ive been switching to veracs helm if i have to tank any melee or ranged attacks

You know it! I still play on the same account too, got around 14 99’s before i quit rs3 a year ago, and now almost 2000 total on osrs. -Deermaster

Possibly, they state on the customer support that items are only returned when game issues are the cause
---
Ya
---
They aren't going to do much about it without video evidence. you can keep trying to get them to look into it.. but unless you're a popular content creator, have good evidence or create a social media shitstorm, you aren't going to get much results for glitches you can't recreate.

You'd have to literally provide screenshots for every xp

Good point. If youre good at wow you can probably boost people in rakds for like 8 usd an hour which is astronomical for venezuelans today

I agree. If you’re 25 and playing rs, there are 150 other people your age watching 1000’s of hours of Netflix. Enjoy it as long as you can

wow 43 is like so close to 50 and 50 is like halfway to level 100!!

yes i do, considering this is their second chance at this game.

Use the in game bug report...

Right click the report button and click bug report

Awesome, much appreciated! is it efficient to get the eels with 87 fishing or should i go higher?
---
Every talisman

Yeah, they updated it in the most recent Clue Scroll update, so if you get a clue and complete it up until you get the casket, you can get another clue after that and the caskets are now all stackable.
---
I think Runescape in 2011 was a great game. And we got there without any polls. I personally do not enjoy OSRS as much as I thought I would, and I pin the most blame on the polling system. I just do not think the mob mentality of hte players can "design" a great game, and the results speak for themselves. OSRS has a pretty decent playerbase, but it's altscape and botscape inflating the numbers. Since getting the boost with mobile, the player count is declining month to month. For fuck sake, OSRS saw its greatest jump in players with the grand exchange was released. NOTHING about the GE is "old school" lmao. OSRS is deeply flawed. 
---
Anyways, what's your point exactly? What is your criteria for a great game? You have yet to provide any sort of counter example, and all your responses boils down to EoC and MTX, the two things that I addressed in the very first part of my first comment. I never claimed any game was flawless. Hell, I don't even consider 2011scape flawless, but it sure was a hell of a lot better than this abomination of a game that OSRS is.

What if i can show these screenshots? 
---
Got banned while I was grinding strenght, can show from start to 85ish when I got banned
---
Lol if it took that big of a dev team to generate piss-easy bosses with no mechanics, simplistic puzzle rooms, and overpowered gear then I support them having a smaller dev team. Ever Vespula in CoX has more mechanics than every boss in dungeoneering. Just about every boss before EoC in the main game was a joke apart from Nex (QBD wasn't great but definitely a huge step in the right direction).
---
One thing that pisses me the hell off is this misconception that scouting exists because of clients. Woox has a fucking guide soloing Raids which show you how to fucking scout Raids. It's not a thing with 3PC as much as I'd love to see them all banned but rather a thing with CoX as a whole. For the purposes of this debate, this point I'm bringing up helps your side but that's something I wanted to make clear. Personally, I think them only letting you see the scout after you start the raid would help since it'd ruin prescouting alts. You can only start the Raid once the entire party is in.
---
How is a variety of bosses supposed to be "fun" or "exciting"? ToB is arguably the best piece of content they've ever released. Quality of content comes from how tough of a challenge it poses and how much room you have for high-quality plays such as the Inferno. Most of us can barely do an Inferno run in 85 minutes yet Kelvino nails sub-50s. OSRS is a repetitive game. It's supposed to have a rhythm. By that logic, the Inferno could be seen as boring content since the waves don't change and the spawn locations remain the same.
---
cant offer you much advice other than contacting customer support, thats fucked up though my dude, im sorry that happened to you, id be livid.

---
fun?
---
Couldn't really give you an estimate, sorry. Been doing it for a week straight, aimed to get between 5-15 or 20 clues per day. Depends on how lucky you get with the RNG, some clues took me under 10 kills to get and others took me over 300, but in the end it almost evened out to the expected drop rate with the imbued ring of wealth which is 1/64 for Green Dragons i believe.
---
I recently got my cape on my second try after panicking and failing prays at healers the first time around. So what I did was I just tried reducing the number of things I'd do during Jad, so no switches aside from prayer. Always kept my blowpipe on long range and that way I'd just have to change pray &gt; tag healer &gt; repeat until Jad dies.
---
Aparently you are the absolute unit here that has no idea what a range tank is lmao
---
That doesn't prove you didn't use a bot though
---
That just proves you trained for the level up
---
They also ban mains if you bot on an alt or something. Also autoclickers and autotypers will get you banned.
---
Anything 3rd partt that does inputs will cause a ban
---
I'm guessing you thought you could get away with an autoclicker or something in nmz and got perma'd for your first offense. Of they perm'd you, you were botting m8
---
Well see I thought you were literal, in that you thought maybe it was the double"the" or as you said, the "the plurality", but wasnt certain. But it being a joke makes much more sense lmao.

This is why I always suggested going crafting route for first glory. It's waaay easier now days too with giant sea weed and stuff.

This is a dank meme and I love it butnyeah I agree with you. I like that the community is picky. It helps that I don’t play as much as others so I’m literally at no risk of ever completeing all the currently available content tho haha

Never
---
Probably wouldn't be particularly useful?  Usually high alch is used either on a bunch of random things you got as loot, or on one stackable noted item.  It's not normally used on a whole inventory of the same unnoted item.
---
But I didn't see it so clearly it's new :\^)
---
And maybe find a very expensive purchase from the GE sitting in your bank
---
nope sadly, I got like 100 kc trio got like some dex arcane scrolls (not me my mate) was before collection log but I started solo when collection log game.

Well you're wrong with there being no mid level pvm content. DKS, Mole, KBD and Barrows are all great intros to PvM with low requirements. A little bit of those will also allow you to move up to GWD and stuff like KQ and Wildy Bosses. There's a nice progression curve for PvM and I personally don't think we need more content in the mid tier. Especially not stuff with a lot of dev time needed like raids.
---
awesome thanks

And since the guy said they prove I trained that level legit, what if I got screenshots of every level?
---
Glad to see it worked out.

If you're not ok with the item having level 1 requirements, that means that level requirements are not an irrelevant qualifier if you think they need to be a certain level for BiS gear. If it were irrelevant then it wouldn't matter whether it's a level 1 requirement or a level 80 requirement.
---
That is literally the argument what killed wow. Games should be made for neckbeards not casuals. Casual games are not good for hc players. And you can play 2h/day with a job and family no problem. You will access content just slower. I want everything now attitude kills games.

yea that would totally stop it!!!
---
Twist. OP took a picture of himself for the memes
---
Can't wait to see how they'll handle underground pass and all the soulless
---
Goes to show yet again how OP blowpipe is lol
---
It gives a reward for completing content... only a low percentage of players are probably going to grind enough to do the prif course so they should be rewarded. It gives people a reason to do the new content and makes people want to train agility above 76 or whatever
---
The dps calculator looks at dps with an average amount of specs activating, it even applies the kandarin hard diary 10% boost for bolt specs to be more accurate.
---
#blacks0
---
Then their main damage source would be something other than magic for this exact reason..
---
I just pissed my pants😂
---
the start button is broken it just zooms in and out

Atleast lvl 3

Now you can use Protect from Needles duh
---
If you're all about efficiency sure. There's like no minigames that are alive that are as fun as soul wars or stealing creation.
---
This is great
---
Still down &gt;.&gt;

That’s intellectual property that was redistributed for public use. Ok yeah your joke was a knee slapper
---
How much did you spend in total using the cannon?

Series 2, Episode 5: “Sister City”
---
I've gotten 2 total holy sandals and 2 sets of wizard boots. 1 of which was a double drop casket with Holy sandals + Wizard boots.  I'm at 413 KC.
---
I feel your pain.
---
Unreal post! Mods should be sending you your reward shortly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Netflix.
---
Zuhaar my man you are going ham on these artworks recently, mad props
---
That’s not the point he was making though, is it? He called it RS3 trash and I simply said it is not from RS3. Whether it belongs in OSRS or not wasn’t even being debated.
---
It is far more OSRS-esque than warding, zeah, NMZ, etc.
---
No, bars are almost always worth more than ore.
---
Haha
---
i think theres a high chance of it happening at some point especially seen as osrs is going down the pre-eoc route. id love a more slow, community based pre-ge game
---
It seems to really be bothering you. Want to talk about it for a few more hours?
---
🦀🦀 Vote no to aesthetic polls  🦀🦀

Construction only takes place in one location.  Do you have a problem with construction too?

This

something tells me allah would like to throw a couple hard ones at you for being such an alcohol drinking infidel.

BP is much more OP than tbow. Has practical use everywhere, cheap but can rival/outperform tbow dps for some bosses with ddarts (maiden) and outperforms even max melee at bandos. BP changed the meta to rangedscape, not tbow which is locked behind a hefty price and can't be used everywhere.
---
well i mean with all the brews we have in the game it might be time to switch to that method
---
+3 accuracy for 30+m
---
Jesus that time tho
---
Put yourself if Jagex’s shoes for a second. 
---
•Unveil new content and new proposed armor. 
---
•Have the community shit all over the armor for being ridiculously overpowered. 
---
•Make changes to it so it isn’t massively overpowered and much more reasonable. 
---
•Have the community shit on it for being dead content. 
---
Honestly, I give them mad props for even bothering to look through Reddit because it gives me a headache and I don’t even have to deal with it. 😂
---
he got 32 relics though, which seem to be like 1/10
---
Thanks very much! Appreciate it !
---
Did you even read what I said?? It’s the same reason people don’t use bp with rune darts, it’s a waste of money. Besides, with an assembler you’re saving 80% of darts anyways so it’s significantly cheaper than the scythe. The comparison to people using tbow vs scythe is massive. It’s a waste of money to use scythe anywhere besides ToB. Tbow has beyond cheap usage and is more applicable than scythe is at almost every boss. Scythes exclusive usage is at ToB where people use it to farm more Sycthes. How can you even commit to such a trash argument? I trade my tbow for a scythe only at tob, you’re losing a shit ton of money bossing with it unless you’re pet grinding certain melee bosses.
---
haha ya
---
Ahh! I did remember correctly then, just wasn’t up to date.
---
Not much OC anymore. Was a refresher.
---
Well fuck us then, guess there's no solution and we're just gonna have to deal with hateful speech
---
It's not OP's job to come up with a solution, it's Jagex's. He's just bringing light to a problem and a specific account/person
---
i like how your name looks like a dress shirt with two arms
---
Lol what dumbass would believe this shit?? "My lil bro was on my acc, we acc share, he took it not me" dude you sound like ur 13
---
Anyone seeing this?
---
Asymmetrical
---
Amen
---
I have a pretty solid graphics card, I think it might be the GPU plugin. I know that can be pretty heavy...
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat.
---
Grug no like RS3 &gt;:(
---
Most chinning in MM2 caves. Some NMZ here and there.
---
Go work for like 1 day then buy bonds and buy it
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
Could have a minimum cap as well, e.g. you can't lower the NPCs magic level below 40% of its original level using this weapon only.
---
Yuukiiiii
---
PVM in general was easy back then idk why you're complaining about Dg bosses.  Dg came before Nex and I think the hardest bosses were Corp and GWD.  Point is that DG was actually fun and had variety.  It wasn't the same thing over and over.
---
I was thinking thurgo but that works as well
---
Once removes the venom, once more removes the poison. But you're almost instantly venomed again anyway so I read the best thing was to just click it once and reset the poison/venom to 6 damage. Might have to start clicking twice though if its gonna poison me for 10 and 9s
---
Haram its ramadan🙃
---
The gloves are the rarest piece. No need to shit on him, he could be 3000 dry for all we know
---
Honest question, where?
---
I mean I don’t think it’s too much of a difference. Maybe with infernal cape it’s more significant. Obviously bp with dragon darts is way more expensive. Tbow is pretty good as well
---
Oh not bashin this at all this is a great thing to do. I like your attitude.
---
Just making a joke because I hate agility and I’m a lazy bastard who doesn’t like exercise right now lol
---
If I had to guess, it's mobile bringing more people back into the game. I personally started playing f2p casually when it first came out, got membership in January and now I'm starting raids for money. It doesn't take too long to progress to end-game if you play efficiently
---
depends on how many kills it takes to get 2 serp helms
---
Smaller hitboxes would be a pain in the ass.
---
I want to split a T bow? and I have lol it's a great feeling you should try it sometime.
---
Yo get over it joke wasn't that funny
---
Tbf if they can’t overcome 96 herblore they probably can’t do the end game PVM content which it would be useful for. You wouldn’t need overloads for kbd anyway.
---
people vote no for those, because those that have "suffered" through the grind will go to hell and back to make sure others suffer as well. Nobody is allowed to get it easier.
---
I'm not saying blowpipe isn't op, I'm in a thread directly comparing the opness of blowpipe and chaotic rapier.
---
The rapier emphasized the opness of curses and summoning and multiplied them basically. Blowpipe is by itself atleast and costs money to use.
---
Cant you cast snare on the imps to make it easy?
---
If the rewards are going to be shit, the requirements shouldn't also be shit. I would be more pissed if I had to grind out a long skill to get a shit reward.
---
Falador is super useful for inferno, kandarian is teleports to sherlock which saves a fair bit of time clue hunting, and the bolt spec on the hard diary is REALLY nice there isnt anything like that in any of the tiers. Western hard is elite void, it just feels dead on arrival.
---
Wait, have you been out of the loop for years?
---
I did this when rapier was released. It gave me a huge nostolgia rush to have a rapier in osrs (reminded me of chaotic rapier). At the time it was like 90% of my bank and it fell in price by almost 300m, but I still don't care. It was fun and worth it to me and money starts to come pretty easy once you do pvm. I'd say just do whatever seems fun to you. U can always resell it if you get bored.
---
People are going to have a meltdown if they suddenly are forced to work further on content that they've previously completed. Specifically because the western diaries deals with things like elite void, there's tons of people (including myself) that aren't going to want to come back and work on content that we've already completed just so we can raid/pvm in our elite void sets. It makes more sense just to implement the suggestion I saw on here a few days ago with "the outlands" diary or whatever that guy called it, where diaries for places like fossil island, prif, and other areas are combined into a new full length diary.
---
Not everyone with an opinion is a "brick wall". If you're gonna react that way if someone doesn't change his opinion after 2 comments there's no point in even starting an argument.
---
I’m just gonna add to the blowpipe comments, that thing is broken af. It’s crazy.
---
And this above method covers cost of cballs and pulls 1m and hour ?
---
Yeah exactly that’s why I didn’t include raids lol
---
if i buy membership today, will the next ones get cheaper? i used to play a lot but they fucking made it twice the price so its very expensive now to pay, is there even a better way to get better prices? mind that im not one of those players that have thousand of bots in my control and also dont make 9999 billion per second like some people do so i just cant keep buying membership throught those membership-giving thingy
---
If you’re making super attack pots you’re doing it wrong bud. Super str is almost always cheaper, and I’m 100% positive there’s other better ways.
---
Is it just me or is GingerBeardie the pinnacle of exaggerating every minor emotion and situation for comedic effect
---
What? Are you saying blowpipe and t bow are OP inside inferno?
---
I dont see how BoB's were devastating to the economy at all, all it did was allow extended PVE sessions without having to back out.
---
Brainlets on reddit call switching prayers for Jad "flicking" lmfao
---
Aren't  the dark relic and torn scroll both 1/10?
---
Just sell 13 trout at the ge while dressed as a cute noob. Earns you 1 - 2 mil/hr as a f2p
---
Looks like a surprised guy haha!
---
Love the rings, great job!
---
After a month or 2 of buying membership it should be easy to sustain with bonds. It’s more expensive per month than it was back in the day, but now you have the option of not paying at all.
---
What's actually excessive is leaving two comments lol
---
better effort than most osrs streamers. sitting in here and really having a good laugh.
---
No, as in if they nerf BP and TBow they could potentially add in a condition for the weapons to keep their original stats inside the Inferno.
---
Ye i also like him, i just find the whole twitch vibe super artificial.
---
bounds where always too expensive for me to buy in game, and its the same price or even more expensive if im not wrong when buying with real money
---
What was the req they took out?
---
Unrelated but I think at those stats you would be the same level if you got 99 range
---
how do you like him but find it artificial ?
---
Oh ok, misunderstood, my bad. 
---
On another note, I don't see why a weapon that costs 1.15b and is bis at a handful of bosses needs a nerf.
---
Oh god was this from begging? Or looting bsale drops?
---
Will you be continuing the Pokémon for each skill drawings? I really enjoyed the last one and looking forward to the next!
---
Bud stop using the bold test so much lmao. People aren’t as dumb as you think, we get the idea that eight level 70’s is a lot, and and that the armor being degradable is bad.
---
That’s what I’m saying. If you pay for membership for ~2 months on a brand new account you can easily get to the point where bonds aren’t too expensive and maintainable with gp. You just need to spend your time wisely
---
If something is rare it’s ok to be op omegalul
