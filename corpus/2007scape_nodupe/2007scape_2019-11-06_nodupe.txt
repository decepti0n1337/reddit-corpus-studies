Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Gz lad!!

There are more quests than that.
---
or just go train str any other way. any of the crabs are super easy to afk and do zero damage

Cume?
---
Mudkip is my favorite.
---
I was hoping you actually had a shot or something mixed in there. Slightly disappointed, but looks great nonetheless
---
Slaying doesn't mean he only has to kill slayer creatures or be on slayer task. He just has to be slaying monsters.
---
Went back and double checked: max 75 attack zerk 99 cb, maxed 60 attack zerk 94 cb, maxed 60 attack with rigour is 103. So you are definitely in med range if you max out. You get so much stuff with a med though, you have to factor in not only 70 defense but the 25% defense boost rigour and piety give, as well as the offensive boost they give. This isnt even to mention gear like barrows crystal shield etc(pking wise) pvm wise you got access to a ton.
---
Don‚Äôt focus on making gold right now. Quest and work on diaries, progress your skills as needed and wait until you start making money doing things you enjoy.
---
So basically "we won't ban you, but don't cry to us if you get scammed" right?
---
yes i can afford to buy a dhcb, what bolts should i use?
---
Die
---
Pretty sure chassies is not a word. I believe koy6 misspelled chassis.
---
They‚Äôd be much too small for that purpose. You‚Äôd get one extremely tiny drop at a time, at best. If I ever buy bigger vials, that will be the first thing I‚Äôm using them for! Limoncello would make a great looking brew.

Ruby dragon bolts e with a swap to diamond dragon once hes below like 35%

idk man looks like a completely normal human to me
---
Ive heard about Clinton and Epstein for 15 years now and the news never mentioned it...only when they can put Trumps name in the picture did we start hearing about this horrible man
---
Jagex can take down any site they want to trying to sell their property.
---
One of the most afk things I can think of thats pretty profitable is dark crab fishing on a 2200 world with the wilderness elite diary. \~350k an hour and roughly 40k xp/hr
---
Wow, why don't you just get his SSN while you're at it
---
OSRS wiki has the answer to anything and everything on the site. Want to know how to train a skill just google it and type osrs after it and look at the wiki. You can do this for everything and anything in the game from quest, to items, to monsters, etc
---
What previous Halloween things do we get access, the purple looking cosmetic addition to out POH'S ???

worst is rag and bone man 2 and in search of knowledge best is dragon slayer 2

I did another raid after this to try out the bow. I did, indeed, die.
---
I mean at least elite is barely better than regular void, which you can knock out in a few hours on the high level boat
---
Gl getting the arrows to use thing homie back to mlm for u
---
Wouldn't this mean the prices go down? The supply of high value items is staying the same but the demand is going down (due to less people buying gold to buy them). I mean nothing at all will happen due to them being a small fraction of gold sellers but theoretically if it changed the economy.
---
Yeah this is more of a meme tbh, unless you have fairly identifying information in your reddit post history that could lead to someone figuring out who you are irl and social engineering your recovery details. 
---
Otherwise hackers would just hang out at ToB/CoX looking for whale usernames all day if hacking was that easy lol.
---
??? Jagex is earning WAY more money than they need to be profitable.

Hmm if that's the case I just need to stop being a lazy bastard and just get it done. Thanks for the encouragement ha
---
Ya, but you can still 1 click thieve people without talk options, like Ardy knights and master farmers.
---
Yeah, I upgraded it last. I went for Pegasus boot first then that. Have fun slaying vorkath!
---
\&gt;it worked for me so it works for [you](https://i.imgur.com/UjVXAGM.png)

Do you guys extend cannon tasks because they‚Äôre good xp, or leave them unextended to spend more time on bursting tasks ?
---
I'm on attempt 14 now. I will get it one day
---
They are able to enjoy whatever they like, without worrying about what others think about them, therefore they aren‚Äôt held back.
---
y u heff to be mad, is just game!
---
15 rc? I agree. That mustve taken forever.
---
Check out f.lux if you haven't automatically removes a good portion of blueshade from your monitor during later hours, I keep mine on most the time.
---
Nice
---
Huh?
---
Some people get a super focus when they are high and become less distracted which allows them to do the tedious grind that osrs is
---
Wasn't this already polled at some point?
---
Yeah I have a feeling that it's going to be.
---
Well it is made out of fire
---
Yeet!
---
Sounds like runescape isn‚Äôt your game my dude
---
Sweet thanks
---
I probably would've done the same. Recently been training slayer and it takes me like 20 minutes to hear up and remember where i'm going.  Also J.E. didnt kill himself
---
Yeah but not sure if it's OK to post it here due to reddit rules of targeting a specific person... you'll find it quickly if you search this sub for "shut up" lol.
---
No idea on what happened to the guy, I think he got banned or just stopped one day and maybe the mods started banning or warning people that told him to shut up (for basically contributing to the spam/harassment)?
---
Assuming I get 99 attack / 99 strength / 90 defence, but don't have the best gear (I'll use zamorakian hasta), is vorkath still decent money? I make 2m+ an hour at zalcano. Will vorkath just be variety instead of a better moneymaker. 
---
I have a max house and qpc, but do not have fremmy elite done.
---
Yeah true. It‚Äôs silly tho cuz ya gotta do a ‚Äúmaster‚Äù level quest to get to zulrah whereas you can just walk into skotizo after a few slayer tasks. W.E haha we‚Äôre on the same page
---
oh shit
---
big brain tactics

Stompy legs ranged, dangly legs mage

Saying yikes is yikes
---
You should check out small exp lamps f2p to main series he is able to keep a bond consistently and make extra money would be very helpful to you
---
Agreed or have 99 fletching banked at 95 have the hacker finish it off and banned -.- should've 2 factored my account
---
Ahh.. well there you go
---
Like the skill fire Cape or the one from that uber hard boss?
---
Never said it was acceptable or okay I just said it was functional.
---
At least he has something to do still on the account.
---
I like that idea but goes against my moral code
---
How about smith rune at 40, since that's when you can wield it.
---
Woah, LSD + OSRS now on my agenda.
---
fkin bitches bro
---
Zulrah
---
If you have 2 factor auth, are bank pins pointless?
---
Fact. They're competing with daddy Jagex's gold farm. Luckily Jagex takes a fat cut so it's fairly easy to beat them.
---
tbh id train smithing as much as possible, then when u get to membs, do blast furnace a day or two and ull be making 1m an hour
---
woosh
---
Sweet fucking Christ, I feel this fury to my bones from this.
---
Damn, shroud is a gamer
---
You're good bro! Keep it up.
---
No
---
Doesnt matter. I was going to boot camp with the military and as soon as I got out, I tried to log into my main of 10 years. It was permanent banned due to someone hacking and botting for a week (my friend saw my account on for a week straight and was confused)
---
I tried appeal and even talking/contacting to multiple mods to show proof and got no help. Jagex is disgustingly negligent to the problem.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this every time I spec.
---
I can only imagine what some little bitch who can't come clean about shitposting to devalue someone's achievement looks like.
---
Couldn't you just get it yourself at the point then?
---
Bonds are a scourge on the osrs economy.
---
Me a new player is

it's the only way to play thru
---
He‚Äôs not gonna have sex with you
---
You just acknowledged that them problem exist, and that its a big problem, then go on to say "make it worse".
---
Theres literally thousands of people dying to cancer on every country, does killing an extra 1-2 make a difference?
---
Answer: Yes
---
I think its a plot from twitter to make you download the app out of frustration because it never loads the first time!
---
Cause i have it also, don't have the app
---
How would we go about staggering the minions? Is there a video or do u mind explaining?
---
Fair enough
---
If you can afford the 11$ I would def just bite the bullet and buy the membership, that \~6m for a bond will go to a lot better use if you can actually use it to level instead of maintaining membership. It is much easier to maintain membership through bonds after playing for a couple months.
---
I‚Äôm lost haha can you explain this to me
---
I don't give a shit about that Kpop neckbeard, I'm making fun of YOU at this moment because you're even worse, that's the state of your life
---
I dont think many people are willing to restart a ridiculously grindy game with someone they have never met before.   Im not gonna restart with you, but you can add me if you want or join a CC.  Goodluck finding someone!
---
Just leave your rsn if you want to add me in game.
---
Looks like you get made fun of in every thread you‚Äôre in so that doesn‚Äôt hurt don‚Äôt worry
---
mental illness in no exp waste form.
---
Honey, your bank is going to be worth a shitload more now. They've done you a service.
---
Hello, you've reached the Jagex customer support network.
---
We will be with you after 1k upvotes.
---
Why do all these high functioning EHP nerds always seem to have Kpop girls as their photos. Look at half of Omnia (the pant shitters clan) on twitter, they all have some Korean girl as their profile picture doing faces like a 6 year old.
---
hahahaha, what do you expect from some virgin that maxed every skill to 200m, big yikes from me but at the same time expected.
---
Lmao, go back to posting Barrows threads in 2019 and keeping track of which Runescape player is using AHK, sperglord
---
That spreads them apart, like op's buttcheeks now that he needs a new way to support his habit.
---
ur poor
---
Not at the rate yer mum goes through em
---
The glasses, the camera angle, his beard and his new haircut definitely helps aswell.
---
Not as poor as some shitter proud of his 5m loot :D
---
Sorry I can‚Äôt hear you through my AirPod pros
---
It's too real ‚òπÔ∏è
---
You'll get there eventually :)
---
what are divots?
---
Its sad that jagex mods browse this sub daily but none will ever actually comment/do something about serious complaints like this. I only ever see them responding to memes. I KNOW they will see this post, they'll just ignore it.
---
I think that only makes you appear offline to others so they cannot message you, not the other way around
---
92 is half of 99
---
Yeah it is! I saw him in the background of one of his videos and had to pause and do a double-take.

---
Lederhosen was first outfit that made me love the osrs, i was always like, where is the damn chicken and forrester to get that outfit, and i would wait, simply wait.
---
This is me sober LOL
---
It is legit probably less time to just blast furnace 70-75 with gold ore
---
i dont understand the whole old school against mtx meme. its literally already in the game. and most people buy their gold off 3rd party sites
---
Id still just go med TBH its only 5 less cb's, still in med bracket for everything but BH, where the bracket was only 5 levels and im not sure if bh is even staying a 5 level bracket. You could always try 60 attack zerk then go med like another guy reccomended.
---
Many people do every day! I am just here to make the trip a little bit easier.
---
What if I plan on going to mith dart tip route? I'm not a huge fan of the blast furnace grind and I don't really have to money for it either.
---
O
---
Unless you plan on going for Elite diaries or 99 smithing in the future, +5 boost is worth it. As it stands, smithing is one of the most worthless skills to train in game, giving no real valuable rewards besides the aforementioned in doing so
---
The mind state is still great. I could act/function perfectly normal when I still smoked, but I would always be happy / be in a great state of mind.
---
Buying xp is bad, not sure how people can‚Äôt see that
---
Don't really see the point. I mean even if the time of walking annoys you, you will still probably be there before you manage to contact the taxi service, and ask OP to walk you somewhere.  Sounds pretty dumb
---
Nah dude. If you‚Äôre two months away from being dead ass broke then it really doesn‚Äôt matter what job you‚Äôre doing. Minimum wage jobs have massive turnover anyways. They don‚Äôt give a fuck.
---
nah staking is cancer and stream stakers are retarded
---
Alright guys here we have a few jobs to do.
---
1) shut down gold selling sites
---
Yeah thats no problemo Mark on it
---
2) up our customer service
---
WOaH wE dOnt SaY ThAt HeRE
---
I've been high alching a bunch of the stuff in my bank and everytime I get scared they will flag me for botting because I try to keep a solid rythym. It's kind of ridiculous to think that I should be scared of getting banned for just playing the game normally
---
there's a direct correlation between buying money and buying xp. buying gold buys u faster xp rates
---
Yes but being able to functional normally while high is not the same as needing to be high to feel normal.
---
Wtf I swear he was 50m xp away like 4 days ago
---
Where I come from we call dat shit green dragon
---
yo dude, same happened to me. I was at army Basic training, got to my unit and tried to log into my account, and boom. Banned. Like yeah Jamflex, im sure my BCT cadre were letting me run my 2$ fishing bot  before i left for my 12 mile ruck  march.
---
Yes which makes trident more accurate meaning you get quicker kills.
---
There's a reason everyone uses trident over SOTD for PVM  outside of barrage tasks where you'd still be better off using something that can auto cast ancients
---
Is there a reason you shouldn't?
---
ROFL. Did that like 2 times first few times using RL lol. #WaxHasMeFaded #dank #FeugoGas
---
Lol in what universe is cannoning green drags anywhere near 1m/hr
---
Ima start to just make these posts in photoshop and piss you all off
---
&gt;Goodluck you think if player auctions could get hit they wouldn't of already been hit by bigger studios.
---
only thing its missing is a comma after goodluck, other than that i can read it just fine, what part confuses you?
---
Honestly I'm not sure. I used around $7 worth of materials per set of 4 for this batch, but a decent portion of the resin was wasted because I mixed too large of a batch at once and it gelled before I could get it into the bottles (lesson learned for next time!). That's not including whatever amount of time I spent on it - I wasn't actually keeping track so it's hard to put a value on the time without doing a whole new batch. Unfortunately I need to buy more vials before I can even attempt new batches.
---
Anyone got burnt food. Need pls
---
Mines 48 combat 50 attack 60 str with 70 range haha we should fight lol
---
Bp first and foremost. I guess if you don‚Äôt that have that you don‚Äôt have archer ring either. Bp &gt; archer ring &gt; blessed boots &gt; bgs (make sure you bring a few melee switches) &gt; dhcb &gt; rigour &gt; pegs &gt; dfw
---
BP should be your first upgrade
---
Lol, my roommate and I had a dream of making a massive runescape taxi service a few years ago :D
---
Even your comparison isn't that bad.  People make accounts for their hobbies to separate them from their personal accounts. I have a Twitter just for speed running shit because that community doesn't give two shits about anything else I do, nor do I want to share my whole life with that community. You're the weird one here.

Nice job just get that sexy backpack. What are the stats on your ranger too and hat vs black d‚Äôhide? 
---
Yea someone pkd him
---
I‚Äôm convinced if you ever play on mobile the chances of you getting flagged as a bot skyrocket
---
I'm not trying to argue anything here really, I was speaking half in jest, half in truth. I know what you're saying.
---
Not surprised tbh. It wasn‚Äôt really meant for mobile.
---
how'd that go?
---
until it was shut down last year, you could see friends on Runescape 1 and Funorb too.
---
But buying bonds gives somebody else membership, so it's good for the game
---
Buying xp is only good for you, that's why people don't like it, it doesn't have a good macro thing
---
Idk tax rate but when I make 12 an HR my check averages it to under 10 an hr
---
Back when I smoked a would join public servers on DCS World (a combat flight sim) Fire up my A-10 Warthog and just fly around an airbase bombing and strafing players trying to take off. Then when people would call me out over come I would play dumb and act like I don't understand them . Eventually a bunch of strangers would wing up and come shoot me down from another air Base. Man I was an asshole.
---
Ouch
---
He isn't wrong...
---
Wtf is a random mod suppose to do? Throw an entire team under the bus? It‚Äôs a lot of work to fix this, nobody has an easy answer.
---
you guys could try out runescape private servers like IKOV.
---
You absolute mad man
---
You've taught me more than the American public school system ever did.
---
The consensus is that runelite is ok. They‚Äôve been in talks with Jagex, and removed all banned plugins immediately
---
Just like the corp instance would be lovely.
---
Not getting crashed and don't have to play on a 400+ ping server cause all your worlds are full.
---
Oh sheet someone just gave me a bond hahahaha i don't  even, holy guthixs may you never die (again)
---
Yes this is true. I got banned for accidentally leaving the menu entry swapper on and clicking the banker for 1-click banking. I was really intending to click the bank booth for 1-click banking and did not, by any means, attempt to intentionally bypass the Official Client functionality of forcing an extra click to bank with bankers compared with banking with a bank booth, which are both right next to each other but Jagex intended to happen because "grind". Pls unban Jagex.
---
Again you mad man. You are truly a gift upon my humble life.
---
He‚Äôs my favorite pvp content maker
---
Yeh for peeps with clan connections for sure. Us normies don't wanna deal with constant pking ;P
---
&gt;got automatically banned 
---
It was later confirmed it was another JMOD who banned him
---
So $1.75/per. Minus waste maybe $1.25. I can't imagine it would take forever to do besides waiting, so $3-5 seems fair, would bring in purchases and good reviews. If you spent that time having fun rather than watching tv or doing nothing else I'd say time well spent and wouldn't factor it in until you get a ton of orders
---
yo thats really cool, ive been looking into cutting something similar on a laser cutter
---
That reminds me, do we have ex Jmods commenting on posts like these?
---
I fully agree with you. But how would you feel if it extended to BIS items as well. What if you were guaranteed a full bandos set withing 400 kills, and a full godsword within 800? What if you were guaranteed a dwh on shaman kill #5000
---
39% points in trio?? Earned if you ask me
---
Fuck, you guys made it all the way to jad?
---
In every past situation they have always seen what we say on Reddit, gather about it in private, and then address it once they have a solution or have prepared a statement about it. It would literally do them, and Jagex, 0 good to reply to these posts without being prepared other than ‚ÄúHey uh just letting you all know we hear your complaints!‚Äù
---
They make enough money to have a dedicated support team like EVERY other big game out there. There's definitely a fix to this issue
---
You see those cracks on the dam? Those are bonds. While the dam may be leaking the cracks release pressure in other areas of the dam.

I'm just saying you **can** write scripts that cannot be detected. It's not impossible and there are many people who do it.
---
Plotinyou where are u man? U said I were gonna start playing again
---
I've had both. Either pick a 60 attack zerk, or a 75 attack piety.
---
I personally would pick 75 attack/ 70 def piety any day because its (IMO) the most versatile build you can have and is very well optimised. 75 attack obviously gives you access to all weapons, 70 def gives you just about everything except very niche items like prims/ justiciar/ sigiled spirit shields. All of which give negligible bonuses/ perks when pking.
---
I now have a 75 atk zerk and a 75 atk/ 70 def piety. I'm trash at pking but i find it easier to get kills with the 75 atk/ 70 def build.
---
Is...is that an Ironman luck joke or are you just fucked in the head. It's 2019, I apologize for literally having to ask for the clarity.
---
They did early on in RS3, but they reverted it. It's back to the standard 138 max combat
---
If you're talking about S3rene, he abandoned his original account and made a new account a few months ago but stopped posting on that account as well at least in this sub

Disable authenticator then download on the new phone and set it back up
---
Sorry man lol I just grinded out 83 construction and wanted a laid back afk method to relax a bit before going back to a grind intensive skill
---
Is that not purple?
---
and it happens soo often. I've seen people get thousands of upvotes after gallivanting about how innocent they are, until a jmod shows up.
---
I don't gamble/haven't downloaded a gambling app and got it in related apps still. They might take into account history, but the way that it works is more of a "other people have also downloaded this"
---
It's almost the same price. If you were betting itd probably be much cheaper to get the ~5m together for a bond
---
Why would you use a mouse recorder? It's so damn easy to detect lol
---
Innocent until proven guilty I guess lmao? Or rather innocent until a Jmod shows up and smacks them down.
---
apparently end of 2020
---
JuSt SeNd An ApPeAl LoL iTs So SiMpLe

No dude you dont get it, despite all these posts claiming that they got wrongfully banned and cant appeal it, my sisters uncles cousins dads granddaughters parrakeet got unbanned once!

Lol kid "unnegotiable" and "unappealable" are different!
---
Waiting for JMods to come and say "you actually RWTed 100 times L0L botting nerd."
---
 - to all the people who say anything of the above, eat ultracompost and die.
---
We've achieved maximum intelligence.
---
Doubt it. A bunch of new players showed up when it came out on mobile, leveled to mid-game states, and gave up because it's too much of a time sink for them.
---
Woah arcus gold is huge as far as I know it's pretty much the only gold site ive heard of so my sample size isn't that great lol
---
you do realize just how big a waste of time this is right? all youre doing is splitting off and adding revenue to other sellers
---
I play every aspect of Runescape. On my main I own an infernal max cape, have 20 pets, do post 99 skilling, pvm and do completionist content. I used to PK, but Jagex have mismanaged pvp so badly I've play other games to scratch that itch. Don't pretend to understand anything about me you flog. The point of this post was that rev weapons need rebalancing, no matter how badly you and bot friends dislike that notion. It's another aspect of this game that's going to shit from a team of Jmods that don't actually play their game/understand the impacts of their cherry-picked updates. Go back to wintertodt you flog.
---
Its called INTEREST...
---
Smh shaking my mh head smh head.
---
But plenty of people get membership via GP. Less bonds purchased, bond prices skyrocket. Then people who can't irl afford membership ($11/mo) can't be members. I feel that would hurt the game more than having bonds.
---
You‚Äôre kidding. I‚Äôve put like 500 hours into this thing
---
i agree

Cool guy

Slightly. It‚Äôll be a pain, but you‚Äôll get your account back

2018.. so last year lol. You'd have to have 8 years between temp bans for it not to be perm. That's such a tiny amount of time but you act like it was 2005 or something lol
---
Seems it's pretty clear cut in saying "no menu entry swapping" tbh.
---
Best bet is to contact your bank and get them to halt the payments. Won't help with  your rs account, but it's better than losing money for nothing.

That's the thing. I only gamble in one game with friends. Google ads are based off history. Yours is full of gambling, mine is not. You don't have to admit it, this is an anonymous board and noones judging you.

Straight up.  Had an account I made to play on the side with the username UnbanPlugins (yeah, I wonder why it got banned).  Grinded the fuck out of wintertodt, got a ban 6 days into the account.  Unappealable.  Fuck that.  I'm appealing it every day, clicking that shitty check box saying: \[  \] Can you confirm this is your first time attempting to appeal this ban?  
---
Fuck them.  I hope it floods their shit support team.
---
How?
---
Why do you want an account back from before 2013. I stopped reading after that. They advise you to make a new account after getting banned

This doesn't actually make a difference. It is used to make brute force attacks more difficult, but login attempts are rate-limited anyway so this isn't a viable method of attack. 
---
&gt;there's no authentication delay

This has literally been a meme suggestion from day one. No other company actually implements this.

Barring the Jed incident, people are just clueless about their online security and don't even know it, so they assign blame to whoever they can.

80 percent of this game is grinding money, the fact that you can just buy it from Jagex ruined the game.  It's why I quit.  Extremely demotivating.
---
You mean plummet... cos they're free
---
I'm pretty sure its owned by a company that also owns a large chinese mining company.  Can someone fact check me on that?
---
Yeah I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend slayer until at least lvl 75 combat, but it can be a nice change of pace from questing. You do want at least enough to be able to do Animal Magnetism, as having Ava‚Äôs device is pretty much a necessity for any range training
---
I don't like recolors for things. It effects the game look. Sorry

And killing a goblin what a chad

I don't gamble, I don't know how to prove it to you but at least my phone apps is 2 pages and with the exception of RS/OSRS I don't even have games on my phone though I don't particularly want to share the apps I have downloaded online.
---
It's actually a little more nuanced than that, it's also based off what your friends like, and what people around your location like - it's also based off of the likely purchases from other people that have downloaded the app - which makes sense given the prevalence of gambling centric mtx in RS3. It might be purely because you actually have a history of downloading games on your phone, wheras I do not, so they can personalise it a little more for you.

I remember grinding there as a kid. People would hangout in bank buying ess and I would never have the patience to wait more than like 250 banked to go and sell it and then run back to that shitty mine. Good times bots good times. Always thought it was super weird how pure ess was 90-100 forever and rune ess was 25. Now it's worthless. I would guess due to coming from monster drops now?
---
I appreciate you using a ¬£1 coin for the UK peeps
---
If people can buy wealth and they don't have to grind for it then that devalues wealth in itself, a game that's economy is very important being devalued is definitely not good for the game. You're looking at it very surface level lol.

Read the part above it.

That list is referring specifically to boss fights

Goodluck on the rebuild mate, it's a common cycle.

Its amazing how people dont realize that whether Jagex wants it or not, streamer favoritism is a thing.

Well its not really favoritism, id call it privilege.

Streamers publicly broadcast the game screen, mods can see that EV was wrongfully banned. Normal players dont broadcast and mods CANT see the game screen.

I will say that Jase is probably one of the most outspoken persons in the high ranks. I‚Äôve talked to Jase a few times on his alts; he is just really approachable, willing to spark up a conversation and at least feign enjoyment in the convo.

Would not doubt that Jase just was talking to a Jmod one day and the Jmod really just wanted to give Jase the nice award.

Still gratz to this man but Jase was just born a salesman and used it on OSRS.

Repost
---
oooooooooof
---
what bot do you use
---
AFK-ness for me is a combination of 3 factors: 
---
1. How much attention you have to pay
---
2. How often you have to interact
---
3. How long you have to interact for
---
Out of the three options: 
---
Karambwans are low on the first, medium on the second, high on the third (banking and teleporting back).  
---
Infernal eels are medium, low, low.  
---
Sacred eels are medium, low, medium. 
---
Karambwans are about in the middle of the three for both xp and money, sometimes best for money depending on prices. This isn't factoring in bait catching time, but that's probably 1% of the total time or less tbh. ~600 catches per hour for 300k gp and 30k xp/hr.
---
Infernal eels are somewhere between 28k and 35k xp/hr iirc. Used to be outright better than sacred eels, but now with the low onyx price they're like 200-250k gp/hr. Fishing spots are close to each other, so moving between them is easy. 
---
Sacred eels are 20-24k xp/hr, with high scale prices they're something like 300-350k gp/hr at 96+ cooking. Spots are far apart though, and hard to see on mobile. 
---
Remember to use rada's blessing for the chance to catch an extra fish.
---
Sounds awesome! I have little to no pvm experience besides like Kbd. I have a good account just never learned if that‚Äôs okay. My username is Fire Iv5 if you‚Äôd like to look up my stats
---
Zulrah with mystics
---
I had no idea they were real fish. . Wtf lol
---
I'd suggest asking in the runelite discord
---
I‚Äôll use a condom before I battle tha snek in mystics
---
I tried it out of curiosity because of this post, it definitely brought back some nostalgia and I'd love to finish what i started 15 years ago... if only the game wasnt dying and i wasnt focusing on maxing on osrs. Maybe if I get truly bored or post osrs max I'd finally finish it lol.
---
He did get one

This is only in reference to bosses. Read the underlined portion above what you quoted.

You're just arguing semantics. People ignorantly interchange squeel and mtx, and the terms don't really matter.

Literally thought about this guy yesterday because of my ISP right now. They have the exclusive capability of providing cable internet (idk if there's a better word) in my town and they're being a pain on the ass. We could've upped our internet half a year ago, they literally would've had to come and check some shit and be done, since we have everything physically set up, but nooo, they're installing the stuff physically for other people first and then doing a second lap around to activate it.
---
And the best part is that there's no use in complaining because they have no need to do shit.
---
Thank you all for the love! Still can‚Äôt believe I got it!!
---
True but jagex may not have the resources to parse between overlay ‚Äúdarkmodes‚Äù and overlays that they deem too gamebreaking.  The guy was saying in the case of a blanket ban, you might get caught up in the ban net.
---
you are overgeared for jad, dont worry
---
Not sure if mene or not
---
Lol!
---
No meme, just a clueless guy whose never done Jad on any account before. My irons already far far better in terms of stats and gear than my main was.
---
Armadyl Gloves + 1 ranged over barrows negative melee stats
---
I hope so man, I‚Äôm tired of rocking the obby cape, though it was a flex getting it at like 20kc, made the low levels nice
---
Jagex sucks
---
&gt; Depends, if they're doing work that's equals a net positive, then yea maybe self-imposed sleep deprivation is justifiable.
---
? Its still unhealthy. So no, that doesnt justify it.  
---
&gt; Kinda like justifying spinning flax instead of killing zulrah for money, you can't. Because killing zulrah is faster money and net faster crafting xp in the long run.
---
Play the game for fun you elitist loser. If someone enjoys picking flax let him, not everyone cares about max efficiency u autistic freak.
---
Found the Jebrim boomer. Get off reddit, its unhealthy for you.

---
Kind of off topic but I think there should be a decent way to get pure essence that isn't killing zulrah or temple trekking. There should be some essence mine extension that allows you to get a decent amount/hr
---
I feel like nobody else noticed the epstein comment
---
Gear wise ur fine, on wave before jad kill the orange mager last and stay where u killed it as that's where jad will spawn and u can't miss first prayer.
---
got fire cape on my 3rd try.
---
Sorry dude but this guide isn‚Äôt good.
---
I started playing again because of the mobile beta. No way I would be able to of kept playing without it. 2054 total.
---
I showed the game to my cousin and let him play 5 minutes just for woodcutting. My 14 year dumbass me announced it in the cc that I will not be afk for 5min and I got banned for Accountsharing.
---
Makes sense this game is not a game for normies even tho the majority of players are normies. If that makes sense
---
Search "high alch calculator". Lots of them out there. You usually price check nature runes, insert the price and it'll give you a good estimate of go/hr assuming max efficiency. So subtract a bit if you prone to get distracted or doing something else like agility as well.
---
They don‚Äôt really make too much sense or are boring alone I guess
---
Don‚Äôt know what your range lvl is but I found the fight impossible without a bp. Tried and failed twice with a rcb. Also failed twice with a bp too :P. Doing it on task with a bp though was actually quite easy and finally got me the cape. Finished with like 4+ brews, 4+ super restores and a prayer pot or two.
---
However I did it only range. You are going a different route with the magic so idk. The 360‚Äôs are what made the rcb so hard. They just took too long to kill that I would always run out of supplies.
---
If you're for updates because it makes things easier for yourself, you're for it for the wrong reason.

"Ads"

No way :D

How the fuck do you not get banned wtf

---
In my opinion the game is dying. The playerbase will continue to drop as Jagex looks to alternative modes (esports bringing in other modes, ironman, group ironman etc.) 
---
  
---
I honestly do not know if they care to even fix the game at this point I mean time and time again suggestions are made and dismissed or "added to a list" never to be implemented. 
---
Drop table rework, and game integrity changes are two of the biggest things that can have such a positive effect on this game. Please don't forget that a fucking 4M Blowpipe obtained from killing a boss that has mediocre requirements is one of the best items in this game. Don't forget that a boss gives less gp AND xp per hour than its variant. 
---
Also, BOT! Ohh my god this game has more bots than any other MMO I've ever played. We've heard for so long now they don't make it far and the system usually catches them well but I call bullshit on that one. Same bots months later..
---
My game time has cut down by 70% in the past 6 months. This game is just not worth my time anymore. Sorry guys but best of luck to you!
---
Okay my rant is over.
---
tl;dr yes, case sensitive passwords are easier to guess.  
---
But the "easier" is millions compared to billions of years, so in practice it doesn't make a difference here.
---
Yo what time will that be UK time? 99 woodcutter here wanting to support another fellow woodcutter on his achievements! Always welcome to make a new osrs friend!
---
That should be fine yeah, you would probably be fine just using a whip tho i think? Also berserker ring (i) instead of brimstone.
---
Gilded d hide chaps, gilded d hide body, gilded d hide vam's, Amulet of power t, gilded scimitar, gilded kiteshield, gilded boots, gilded coif, cape of skulls, ring of coins. Thats around 100m to flex right there.
---
good luck, my account got locked, and no matter how many times i tried to recover inputting payment details, ispn's, etc, they all got declined by a bot within minutes.
---
r.i.p my main,
---
thats when i quit.
---
tried contacting jagex elsewhere but we all know they have no customer support, so nothing i can do.
---
hopefully it goes better for you.
---
Bwana is just Swahili for Boss

Like a lot of things, practice. The more you play on the platform the more you'll get used to the quirks. Like the other comment said, vorkath is pretty easy on mobile, tho a dhcb isn't necessary. I've done bgs + bp and bp only kills on mobile just fine. I assume you know Vork attacks on a pattern: 6 normal attacks, special, 6 normal, special; alternating between freezing and acid/"rapid fire," so just keep a count running in your mind.

Nrsman, I‚Äôll always cherish those bits of iron armour you gave me before you quit. We met at lvl 3 and killed goblins outside Lumbridge castle, just talking and becoming friends. It was the first time I‚Äôd played RuneScape, fresh off tutorial island, so long ago now. We played together every night for maybe a week before you decided it wasn‚Äôt for you, but that week of goblin kills and casual conversation was what got me to play for so long.
---
I‚Äôll never forget you my friend

Galaxy is an OSRS clan that caters towards people new to raids/pvm and wanna learn how to complete more high level pvm challenges such as raids 1/2. We have many mentors experienced in high level pvm that can get you through your first few kills! We also run trips/masses to easier bosses such as godwars and there's a fair few of us that enjoy the occasional pk trip.  We have a few requirements that we consider the very minimum gear to be able to get into high level pvm (Cost of reqs is under 200m including Rigour. If you do not meet them, you can stay in the clan as a smiley).  If you have any questions feel free to shoot me a message on here or on discord at Pieflavour#0094

I got to use it against dark beasts and it was lovely but I imagined if I had a rapier I would *always* choose that over the blade because it doesn‚Äôt degrade. I was thinking a +1 prayer bonus might make me consider the blade for a task where I have to pray overhead to help me finish it in 1 trip.

Now we just need some leg runes, and we'll be all set

I read it as when literally everyone runs away from you as you try to pk them its an ego boost since they're "scared" to fight back.   I dont think someone kill you in the wildy is an ego boost, but if everytime I attack someone they run away in fear it could be a nice feeling if your into that sort of pking.
---
No, most of my stats were level 1. I just opened the crates after every round ends.
---
I dont care if people think I'm full of shit wuote frankly, I just want someone who can see the code to atleast check. Anyone that has done 1000+ kills and gets MVP frequently would no I'm not full of shit anyway. People telling me I am have quite clearly never really killed zalcano.

I will tell you why it‚Äôs dropping. 
---
The endgame for people in high level is so fucking bad unless you are a iron man. Pets are fun to go for but there isn‚Äôt a threshold system so it‚Äôs literally rng the early game fucking sick. Run energy is fucking shit and there is only so much running you can take before you get bored
---
(Almost) Nobody brute forces on a live system with limits. Brute forces are generally performed by comparing it against leaked data from a security breach until it matches.
---
Not aware of any data breaches but many companies who should have top-notch security have had breaches so you‚Äôre just trusting Jagex not to. And considering they give zero fucks about customer support and only focus on profit that may mean the data isn‚Äôt as secure as it could be and if the worst did happen the systems aren‚Äôt in place to protect people.

With Jagex not setting up a half decent customer service, I'm glad we have mods like you who take the time out of of their day to listen and solve our complaints. Thank you
---
Your own freeze timers are fine it's when you can see your opponents freeze timer it become bannable. Also in case you have any other questions about other plugins, the current version of Runelite has removed everything bannable.
---
Since osrs is around 7 years old you never played it.
---
Sure have my guy. They never made case sensitive matter, or at least they haven't until years later now if it's changed.
---
Actually, the best protection we have is not using the same password on everything. But I guess asking y'all to just use adequate account security measures, is just too darn much.
---
For someone who never played, what‚Äôs there to do after level 60 besides raid? A 200 hour grind to level 60 isn‚Äôt much for most experienced RS players.
---
Your way of thinking is very unhealthy and kind of backwards mate
---
Youre not making any sense.
---
FBI: We‚Äôd like to offer you to be head of the company

Underated comment
---
You're wrong. Bonds directly translate to XP or items unless you're an ironman. 
---
You can skip the grind of getting gold by legally real world trading to get the best gear in the game - it's literally pay to win. 
---
Think of a free to play game, any free to play game that would catch your attention. Now think about a review that says you can skip the majority of the games content by paying real money. What's the first thing that's gonna come to mind? 
---
The whole MTX scare is pretty bullshit , OSRS has had MTX in the form of bonds for awhile that directly affect the flow of the game. A few cosmetics wouldn't matter LUL.
---
No they released the old school servers as a separate game in 2013, you have to make a new account to play on them. 
---
However you could still play on that account on RS3 no problem - if you _really_ want to
---
Someone needs to make a YouTube compilation video of all these mod matk memes.

Brother you may wake up from your slumber, for a Jmod has spoken.

If you don't turn the camera crooked you get the Indian symbol of peace. It's a shame Nazis ruined it though by making it crooked.
---
Lots of hate for the mobile version going around. Personally my friends and I love it. Sure, the game is wildly better when using 3rd party plug ins. Like a lot better. But mobile makes it a lot more accessible for my busy lifestyle. I can play for 10 mins or a half hour at a time without needing to go to a computer. For a total min maxer, it may not be great. You don‚Äôt get max xp gains, there‚Äôs definitely some content I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing, prayer flicking and rapid prayer changing is pretty tough. But if you stay away from the difficult combat and focus more on skilling or grinding normal monsters, it‚Äôs a pretty dope experience.
---
According to the recent rs3 Q&amp;A, the MTX revenue indirectly funds the devs on osrs. Its only a matter of time. 
---
That or get ready for the $15 btw memes in the future
---
It looks to me like it's a perfect 3:1 ratio all the way through. There are four (slightly crooked) columns and four rows, and one is super restore.
---
what is unclear
---
I am aware of that, is it supposed to somehow make me feel better? 
---
96% of their net income is given as paid dividends to the holding company. They are leaving very little money to be reinvested back into the game. 
---
5% of that $40 million dollars is an extra $2 million leftover that could be used to, idk DEVELOP A FUCKING SUPPORT TEAM that's worth a damn.
---
cmon bruh
---
No it isnt.
---
idk where the fucking bar is to not be considered casual but i would think that maxing is well past it.
---
Same thing happened to me but first spectral and then arcane. Also it was like 10 kills apart
---
Well yes, that‚Äôs a given. However even unique passwords need to be independently secure.
---
It‚Äôs no good having unique passwords if they‚Äôre all simple to force/guess.
---
And while it‚Äôs on that topic, 2FA on your email is always one of the safest ways to keep things safe, as often losing access to your email account it how they recover all your other passwords.
---
thank you good sir.

Actually, it's an [**Agility cape**](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ds72ab/me_just_killing_blue_dragons_on_my_500_total/) and that is me.
---
Just got my fire cape a few days ago after 7 attempts. If you're making it to Jad then you're doing great to start. When you're on the wave before Jad, pay attention to where the orange lv360 spawns because that's where Jad will spawn.
---
Your set up should work fine. If you have a few hundred K to spend, I switched to dragon darts when I was fighting the last lv360 before Jad so my hits were more effective. Brought in 150 dragon darts for Jad and finished with 47 left.
---
The most important thing to remember when fighting Jad is that praying is your top priority. If your health is getting low, pray--&gt;drink brews, then pray--&gt;attack. If you're quick, you can pray--&gt;drink brews--&gt;attack--&gt;pray, but it's risky if you misclick. No matter what, praying comes first. Otherwise Jad will knock you down.
---
53 days play time with 1573 days since i arrived in osrs
---
Wat
---
No kidding, I am a HCIM noob with 549 total level. But at least I have Agility cape.
---
I'm sure you're right. I have no interest in playing again after this, however. I had such a good time rediscovering this game and all my joy is now gone.
---
Damn son..
---
All buyables and nearly all gear, so that's most of the game right there. Buying endgame gear outright instead of grinding for a thousand hours is massive.
---
Other guy is wrong, the answer is yes you can do that.  People use this technique for multi-alt scales so their alts can leave and start prescouting for the next raid immediately.
---
Hello Viva Chopper,
---
Nice.
---
Same as it does on Ironman. Nothing stopping you guys from raiding or chatting together
---
This might be a dumb question but how do you have a stack of necklaces
---
Last time I checked the calc was when I was upgrading and I think it wanted pegs first. Could be wrong though. They‚Äôre both pretty small upgrades and are around the same cost and FPS increase.
---
Lmao ok
---
I don't have anything to comment anymore because you hit on every single point I could have brought up. SotE was a huge update, but if you can't/won't do Mourning's End Part 37 where you have to moonwalk through Underground Pass six times blindfolded while on fire, then you didn't get anything from the update. I don't PvP and I'm not an ironman, so I haven't really enjoyed an update since Kebos.
---
This is incorrect. Being in for start and then leaving is exactly how you do larger alted scales (4+3, 3+2 whatever) so the other alts besides the prep alt can go start prescouting immediately.
---
Bruh, you rolled the 3A table.
---
Deserved, I wish you were banned for this kind of language.
---
Yes
---
What? I was talking about how this guy claims he never trains any same skill for more than 1 hour at a time.
---
H
---
That's runelite showing how many charges are on the necklace
---
its a plugin that shows the number of teleports left
---
I personally use black chins for the healers - takes some pressure off.
---
Keep deleting your comments and acting like you still think you're right pls
---
*Piques*
---
that's literally the point.
---
Bring an occult instead ahrims for healing
---
add Avada Kedavra to the game
---
Can‚Äôt teleport inside a raid but ok
---
Ones arcus gold but that's shut down too
---
Thanks I have been considering Chins. The AOE should hit all the healers or is there certain ones I should aim at?
---
Wtf...
---
The directors decide whether there is a dividend paid, I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre the main shareholders, they have large cash reserves though can still afford a support team.
---
They are my BiS robes which I have an access on my HCIM. I don't have enough Magic to enter Wizard's guild for Mystics. =u=
---
Do you think I should invest in the prospector's gear, or go straight for the coal bag?
---
With these strict policies... I wonder how anyone was NOT muted in 2008.
---
You are 100% not getting your items back. That much is certain. Tough pill to swallow, but that's what it is. Account security is up to you to maintain- do you have authenticator on your account and email address? Unique passwords for that account and email? Bank pin? If no to any of the above then get them. That's all you can really do at this point, prevent the next one from happening.
---
Lol? Who hurt you
---
Use Spicy Stew
---
I believe he is one of the owners of one of the bot sites that gold sellers sell on.
---
&gt; with mobile coming and the expansions planned for next year
---
they cancel or massively delay every other planned update in rs3, wouldn‚Äôt count on that
---
I think the M4 wouldn't be so popular if it wasn't for the fact you unlocked it so early, compared to stuff like the scar/ak47 you unlock pretty much when you're near max level.
---
Games also very focused on gun attachments, so its hard to go from one you have 50+ attachments unlocked to one with none.
---
How can you complain about lack of content when you haven't even tried half of it?
---
Some time's I don't know if it's my screen or I just have sensitive eyes (lots of surgery on these bad boys), but I literally keep f.lux running almost all the time unless I'm doing some work that requires colors.  
---
And yes if it crashes (I think mines has only done this twice) it HURTS.
---
Which begs the question: is it worse to forget to put it on, or to forget to take it off?
---
Lmao
---
Sounds reasonable, I'm not sure on when they swapped the requirement from username to email account for the login though.
---
The we do raids inferno text guide is quite good, as is xzact's waves and zuk guide.
---
so start an ironman. or bye.
---
We have game modes that let you opt out of the economy altogether. Removing an opportunity for less financially fortunate players to have membership and contribute to the perpetuity of the game all for the sake of YOU and YOUR money feeling devalued is petty. If that's all it took for you to quit, I suspect you were already looking for a reason to.
---
It should at least hit most, which will make it easier to get the rest. Also if it‚Äôs a safe spot, use Italy rock to give yourself a breather from jad while you kill the healers
---
Yeah but then you dont know whats up either
---
5437
---
As stated before the game came out in 2013 so your account from 2004 or 2005 is not an osrs account it is a runescape account. 2 seperate games. Unless you started back at tutorial island after 2013 you have never played osrs
---
what does this mean
---
I conceed, I just don't remember then ever have 6 steps, could be I've just been lucky up until now.
---
Isn't there an f2p castlewars tele in the duel arena? Maybe that will do and the minigames list isn't needed at all
---
Damn. Some nice work to commemorate some nice work
---
It was a mistake on our end on the wiki that showed extended antifires. I have corrected it already since I double checked the doc.
---
That's tough - even though I don't make a habit of it, there are plenty of people who *do*, and I don't think that there's anything that can be done to make them all go away anytime soon.
---
In fact, the Twitch Prime promotion might result in an even greater influx of... well, the sorts of players you would typically find in F2P.
---
It do be like that.
---
shit, who was 2nd?
---
Not sure if this "swampman good" thing is a meme. I finally finished watching his series and don't get me wrong, it's entertaining, but it's nowhere near the amount of hype this sub seems to make it out to be. 
---
Swampman overrated more like it
---
It's been corrected on our end. It was a clerical error when the page was made with the doc information.
---
Shit game
---
k
---
I think I‚Äôm gonna go for this, thanks!
---
I do zulrah/vorkath/Tob for a couple hours and can afford another month of membership for gp
---
One thing i love about this sub is that when ever its a normal post about osrs, the Jmods don't hesitate to interact with the people but the moment we start talking about their flaws there isn't a single one in the comments. They are obviously pretty active in the subreddit, how come they're just ignoring all of the complaints?
---
Hope you guys enjoy,

There is a lot that is wrong with this video in terms of the animations, composition, etc. I created this as a part of my [newest progress log]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adpJkyeYw_s) (shameless plug) which should have been released about 8 months ago now and during that time I switched rendering engines, switched back, and even completely ditched this concept altogether a few times.  This was my first time working with human models, and I greatly underestimated the difficulty of animation a rig and keeping the movements realistic.  I decided to go ahead and post this because I have already spent so long tinkering with it that I just needed to get it off my plate so I can move on.  With that said, I did learn a lot and I hope to keep improving in quality as I continue my series, and I have also started a few other projects that I‚Äôll be using to flesh out my YouTube channel while I dedicate the higher quality animations and edits to my Minigame Only series.
---
I'm thinking about picking it up on Black Friday. Is it still fun? I enjoyed WWII for a while but I'm tired of the whole prestige thing so is there much locked behind prestiges?
---
Hey just so you know, one of the questions for account recovery asks when your account was made. If someone was using social engineering to collect data, they could theoretically use this and other information to steal your account.
---
Rs3 is pretty dead the numbers speak for themselves 17-20k daily users down tons over the last two years. Mobile might help it out but at this point the constant stream of mtx with no meaningful updates in almost a year is laughable.
---
Nah not mad just sheer dumb luck like my 3kc pet lol

Strange why did osrs grow beyond the rs3 playerbase so quickly then?
---
Rune pouch
---
Prospector's outfit isn't useful for moneymaking, straight to coal bag
---
Called in a drone strike on your ass 'Merica üòé
---
Piscatoris is also quite nice
---
I bought a Santa hat for like 150k once, I quit when they got up to like 6m (not sure what year that was), forgot about it for years until I found out about old school runescape like a year or two ago and sold it for a ridiculous amount of cash. My account wasn‚Äôt even that high stats either so can confirm that he may have a lot of wealth on it
---
He wasn‚Äôt able to.
---
Mate you can buy a rune pouch from slayer masters
---
He ded
---
Jagex hasn't released anything really exciting or anything with a lasting impact in the last year. I feel the updates past year and their runefest plans for the following year to be extremely underwhelming. Expect player count to continue falling
---
I'm very excited, it'll be something new and different. Might make an alt just for it
---
Are you a black woman?
---
It was easy to miss; just a brief mention in a list of a bunch of things. I tried to summarize most of that stuff in my [stickied comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ddr9fp/osrs_reveals_morytania_expansion_clans_and_group/f2w9zfy/) on the reveal thread. For the Diary, this is what I have noted: "PvM Achievement Diaries is a different kind of completionist content for killing monsters, some with time threshold and combat restrictions."
---
&gt; any further inquiries would be ignored
---
You sure?
---
Do some slayer, finish clue scrolls, and dont focus super hard on BiS gear.. the higher your combat stats and slayer the more money makers you will access to be able to sustain. and every day do like an hour of a mid level money maker (green drags, zammy wines, certain processing skills) that will help as well
---
60k daily users for a clicker game.  Such a bad number wow.
---
This is what happens when you decide to publicly trade your company.
---
It‚Äôs probably the best place to go dry since it relies so little on uniques for profit
---
People who just happen to like kpop don't base their entire Twitter identity on that and a 17,000 hour RuneScape grind though.
---
Have barely watched the series, honestly. It's just really interesting how much time Settled puts into tiny goals, and he seems like a cool person in general.
---
Hmm
---
&gt; Lol liking kpop doesn't make you a koreaboo though.
---
Basing your entire Twitter presence on it does though.
---
Is it still worth it to train NMZ over ammonite crabs if you have a low cash stack?
---
Wilderness slayer
---
Luckily he's hidden his runecrafting lvl so he should be safe.
---
This changes all my gp/hr calcs smh they're not worth doing anymore
---
ditch the mage gear and runes, bring +4 extra food +1 range pot, swap out the wrench for +1 pray pot (1 extra ppot is more pray restore than +16 extra pray u have rn by having it in inv)
---
if ur panicky then get tankier legs for high waves
---
I got muted back in the day for encouraging hacking when someone asked me how I got snowballs and I said it was a secret only I knew

I googled it and tried to find the plural for Chassis, the google search came back with chassies.  I don't know I generally just say the word never had to type it before or its plural form.
---
Blowpipe with at least addy darts, verac helm, blessed dhide body, verac skirt, blessed dhide boots, fury, whatever blessing, bgloves, accumulator, archer ring (i). I did 16 restores 9 brews and 3 range pots for inventory
---
Jagex, could you please poll some of these things already?
---
I was very excited until I learned you needed a membership/couldn't play on your main at the same time. It's a great concept and you have to get creative to be successful
---
this answer is false
---
!remind me 1 month
---
Base 85s as others have suggested is recommended to start. Fury is okay to start with, anguish is the most important zenytes with the tormented bracelet and torture amulet being roughly tied after that. 
---
It's good that you have a torso, you'll use that at Cox until you have just about max gear as it's actually best in slot - BCP provides no advantages over the torso in team raids (or the vast majority of osrs content tbh).
---
Similarly d boots are absolutely fine to raid with. Primordials are 30m for +1 str bonus, which won't even add a max hit in many cases. 
---
A decent welfare Cox setup looks like this: https://imgur.com/J1xOSXQ.jpg. Should be in the ballpark of ~35m.
---
Rigour is an extremely good upgrade, probably the best 55m you'll ever spend in the game. It would be a good idea to grind vork until you can afford it, but it's not absolutely necessary. Just use your first bit of split money on it ;). I know when I started Cox, zulrah and vork immediately became super boring to me and I really don't have much interest in them anymore.
---
This is a pretty good upgrade guide to follow: https://imgur.com/wChZBCJ.jpg 
---
The "core" items at the top are basically the absolute best value upgrades after the minimum setup. If you're into Cox, you'll never sell these. The bottom section is grouped in columns, with the best value upgrades being on the leftmost column and the less important upgrades to the rightmost column. These upgrades are far more minor than the "core" upgrades. 
---
I know that chart can be a bit confusing so lmk if you have any questions. You can also check out the "we do raids" discord for more info about Cox and to find mentors and raid teams.
---
Took me 15 years to realize. It's hard to have clarity when you think you're actually getting accomplishments when all you're doing is playing some stupid browser game. I don't regret my time played but I'll never recommend it to anyone and I'll actively push anyone away from it. A game shouldn't require this much time from a person for such little entertainment value.
---
Jagex, could you please poll some of these changes already?
---
if it's a joke: haha ikr
---
if it's not a joke: you know that doesn't matter right
---
I value my life sir
---
of course I tried it
---
I seek an answer
---
I haven't played in a while honestly. Just didn't like a lot of the newer updates, game just doesn't feel like it's for me much anymore.
---
Literally got the same thing near the same kc lol.  Gz!
---
Some kpop NEET who got a temp botting ban and still kept going for 200m all even though he already invalidated the achievement.
---
just checked that wikipedia article out of curiosity, I believe that's referring to a procedure who's only purpose is to call another. the 'api's I was talking about earlier are just sets of functions/methods (depending on php or java etc) that are a bunch of behaviours that are abstracted to make easy to type and read. I could be wrong but I don't think that's what the wrapper function article is referring to. 
---
either way its bad practice to think about everything as a wrapper, its an abstraction that hides the innards, its not actually calling another procedure to memory, thats done by the compiler/interpreter.
---
What is this swampman meme?
---
Yh well I played back in devious mud goml /s
---
Depends how you measure "failure" what is the success criteria here. 
---
&gt; It could be a case where without mobile instead of the playerbase being 60k regular players right now, it may be 40k.
---
Yes yes I agree with this. We dont know where the game wouldve been without mobile. But we also dont know if the game wouldve been even better without mobile players, because so much catering was done to them. Remember, player count doesnt equate to a better game, not always at least. 
---
Although, when this game was at its peak (2005-2006) the game was also in its best and healthiest state ever, a state it can never return to. Thats obviously my opinnion, that 2005-2007 was best, it also happened to have the highest player count, but I dont believe its best just because it had the most activity.
---
People here saying it‚Äôs because of Classic WoW when it‚Äôs literally been a downward slope the whole year lmao
---
Then you should learn to read
---
Along with everything else said it's partly because of the amount of time and effort that's put into it, like 1000s of hours,
---
And then also, the fact that it's so different from what people normally know or do, it's a completely different meta
---
This comment confuses me. You are paying more money for membership by paying for bonds instead of just straight up buying a membership.
---
Holy recommend
---
There‚Äôs no arguing with you.  This is the most neckbeard mentality I‚Äôve ever heard
---
Potential TIL here, care to elaborate?
---
what does the first half of your sentence have to do with the other half ?

Cannot believe the Swampletics hype is still going after almost a year. Getting old!
---
Boooo
---
They want economist's to help with scripts? So they can create better flipping bots wtf is this shit? Explain now or I'm taking em down.
---
Thats mostly true, though. No1 sits on a phone for 10 hours when you could be playing on a PC or a console doing the same (unless youre stuck somewhere with only your phone available in which case youre probably jumping between activities to kill time anyway) mobile is usually something u whip out for 10-15 minutes then leave alone, maybe u jump to the next game or return to it.

Rats#5866 on discord bro

I literally said morytania

ehh.. not that funny tbh.

If you have unlimited funds and an alt with 80 slayer. So that doesn't really count.

Mentioned this in the mines a few weeks ago, thanks for producing another dank meme
---
Legit, kurzgesagt is such a good channel. Amazing content
---
People who are online a lot tend to develop.. deep interests in Asian cultures since Asian culture is a lot more prevalent online than in person to almost everyone in North America and Europe. People who are online also tend to be single/alone more. Keeping up with qt pop idol Asian girls (which is a pretty large part of Korean/Japanese Culture) kind of naturally translates to that lifestyle.
---
I didn't mean to sound insensitive and I'm sorry about that. I understand that it is hard to lose your items in this game, as it is often a long grind to get where many people are. However, Jagex is not the one to blame here. Hope your day gets better man
---
This is how I got all my essence on my Ironman for a while. Then I got three wyrm tasks and a gargoyles task and now have like 10k ess banked
---
Keep in mind max melee means infernal cape, if you have a fire cape then serp is better.
---
&gt; I've said since the beginning having blowpipe and other zulrah gear so early was going to be a big problem for OSRS in the future. I even recommended just outright removing it. Look where we are now. Nothing can be added without breaking the game.
---
Im glad you have said this, and its still a problem.
---
&gt; Third party clients carried this game the past 5 years. If this still isn't obvious then I don't know what to say to help you. You can't just ban 3P clients. There is no replacement to scalable UI on the default client. There is no text over items. There is no coloring for that non existent text. There are no xp orbs to keep track of progress easier. There are no tooltips that let you know how many more actions you need. There is nothing that keeps track of xp/hr. There are no action tooltips. There are still a lot of menu entries that need to be swapped in the vanilla game that the clients let you automatically swap (eg. bankers). There are no action tooltips, no bag tag tabs, no bank value indicator for those that want that.
---
Thanks for mentioning things that arent in the default client. Newsflash: 13 years ago (when this game peaked) we didnt have that either, was that a predicament? A problem? No, of course not, its just that you have been spoiled so much you now feel like its a necessity to play. Its not.
---
&gt; I don't know how you can stand by the opinion that third party clients should be removed while believing that the game should be the best it can be. It's not a consistent opinion.
---
Its easy to hold this position. 3rd party clients dont better the game, they ruin it.
---
Who would have guessed that things change over time? Its truely mindblowing.
---
‚ÄúMy job is a poker in rev caves‚Äù
---
No lie tho, this man probably supports his family by pking in rev caves. Clans pay Venezuelans to PK for them and protect the PVMers who pay for protection.
---
He botted.
---
/r/coaxedintoasnafu
---
People fail to realise any information Jagex give about their detection methods, which would be easily figured out if they gave out the evidence, would be exploited by the botters. Within a day of that evidence being released, every script on every bot client would be updated to avoid that detection method. Which just ends with more bots in the game for longer periods until other detection methods flag the accounts.
---
&gt;Thats mostly true, though. No1 sits on a phone for 10 hours when you could be playing on a PC or a console doing the same
---
This simply isn't true. People do sit on their phones for many many hours "gaming". Probably mainly kids.
---
&gt;mobile is usually something u whip out for 10-15 minutes then leave alone, maybe u jump to the next game or return to it.
---
For you, sure. This isn't true in the grand scheme of things.
---
did you read my second sentence man

I'm not arguing at all. I was merely stating a fact. You can buy gold in this game. I also think Jagex keeps it because they want in on the gold farmers market. If they don't have it, then all the people are gonna use gold farmers. So they need to provide an alternative imo.
---
My statement is (to my understanding) not one of false equivalence. Yeah of course a life is not equal to lag in a video game, its an analogy, and i believe its correct, and serves its purpose to refute the statement of "X is bad, but adding a bit more of X is okay"
---
Faster methods should require more effort or more requirements and similar effort. Faster methods w/ less intensity are bad.

Why don‚Äôt you go read the wiki it has everything in there
---
Remember when they did that for like a year ~2010 You could pay like 110 dollars to get unbanned buy your account would be flagged to be highly watched by the bot system. Wish they'd bring that shit back
---
You mean from slayer helm? Whole time.
---
&gt; A very reasonable assertion. Would the time have been better spent on developing content bolstering the playerbase rather than grabbing new players. I don't think that getting the mobile population was an inherently good move, I think deductively it was a good move given the options. The game will need new players and it's better to start to get them sooner rather than later. The longer you wait the less attractive the game looks to prospective new players. Pleasing active players with raids 4000 is good until it's only 10 people waiting for that next raid and the server costs far outweigh developing them content.
---
What I dont like about mobile is that it appeals to players who most likely wont enjoy RS for what it is, mobile players are so used to MTX being part of the game to speed up progression, RS is everything that a mobile game isnt and shouldnt be. But at least its not directly injecting bad updates into the game, although, that happened to be the byproduct of mobile to get mobile players to like the game more, that I very much disagree with.
---
&gt; I wouldn't say NEVER. It's just so unlikely that it might as well be never. But I'm very picky with my words, I don't necessarily disagree with you here. And I agree with the idea that just because it was the peak of activity it was the best game. I disagree with the opinion though, it was definitely the best era of the game to me as someone who joined in 2004. 2006-2008 was the best the game has ever been and probably will be, in my opinion. And as far as economic success goes, it was probably the best period for Jagex too.
---
I dont even think so. U have to remember in last years report OSRS and RS3 made about break-even in terms of money despite OSRS being many times more popular. Its very very hard to compete with MTX. So did MTX and EOC and the updates leading up to EOC kill RS? Yes. Absolutely. It didnt kill JageXs wallet though. And I always divide RS into 2 eras: Pre and post 2008. In pre 2008 its impossible to imagine MTX going down very well. The updates in post 2008 enabled MTX.

delicious Finally some good fucking /r/linkiscute
---
That's fair.

8449 is an astronimically high number. If the game hadnt changed SO MUCH we would have seen max counts like 1000% lower. You are not talking a few % or 20% youre talking like 1000-1500% difference to what the actual number would be.
---
&gt;But no, they decide to focus on that instead of the fact that every skill other than combat is completely useless in this game, legitimately every skill is firemaking now.

Every time I want to come back I see a comment like this and I'm like. Yeah, why should I bother?

At first, I thought this was an asshole. Seeing it comment a couple times on every single comment suggests this is a bot.

I'm not excited for Twisted League because I cannot play on my main and play in the Twisted league at the same time. That means I can't progress my main account for potentially months. After I get my Inferno cape, I'll be working towards max and participating in the Twisted League will only add more time till I'm Maxed out. Great in concept but definitely not for me.

Yeah so what, I can dispute tos? "you may have a right of appeal" What the fuck does that even mean? So when do I have a right and when do I not? There's no further explanation of this, can definitely at least try to dispute this because it's not clear enough (¬ß6/3 KschG). The whole tos even reads differently in German eg "Falls wir einen begr√ºndeten Verdacht durch konkrete objektive von Ihnen nicht widerlegte Anhaltspunkte haben f√ºr " - "If we have reasoned suspicion by concrete and objective evidence not disproven by you". This literally means that they have to give customers the chance to disprove that they haven't done anything banworthy. None of all of this is even visually highlighted which is required for anything disadvantegeous and unexpected and one can definitely argue that it's unexpected that bans can occur without evidence and chance for appeal. Section 12 even implies, at least in German, that the customer definitely has a chance for appeal.

Hi Mod Weath
---
My main was banned almost two years ago. I was going through some tough times IRL and as a result took on some self destructive behavior, (including breaking the rules in RS for a few days) resulting in the ban. It was the only time I have ever broken the rules in the many years I played RS and is the thing that I‚Äôve regretted most in my life.
---
I appealed immediately and was denied. But I have always held onto the hope maybe one day it can be unbanned. Nearly two years later now - my life has turned around, I have learned my lesson and will never put something I care about so much at risk again. It still makes me sad that I‚Äôve lost something so dear to me due to my own actions.
---
Has it been long enough for my account to be unbanned? If not, how long do you think I‚Äôll have to wait before I can successfully be unbanned (if ever)?

Okay Mr. International Lawyer, good luck in court. They own your account, they own everything on your account, they can ban your account whenever they want. End of story. Take it to court if you want, doesn't change the fact that it would never make it before a judge.

For some people, money doesn't come easily. I lost my job and spent three months unemployed. I sold many of my possessions to afford rent and a groceries. I kept my computer because gaming was my only release as I sat on my depressed fat ass waiting on the 100+ applications I submitted for a call back. $11 was more than I could afford, that sounds dumb to many but it was true. Paying for membership with in game gold was a lifesaver and kept me playing the game. Just my two cents. (Now I make that in an hour of work so I see both sides).
---
But osrs isn't a mobile game lol and people shouldn't play it primarily as one. Mobile is just a luxury to be able to scape when you don't have access to a PC
---
if you need to know, about 2500 people have arrived at this subreddit since this was last posted.

We can‚Äôt see runecrafting, slayer, or farming. We can see that OP has a total of 16 levels in non combat skills, and then 13 99s bringing the total level of skills we can see to 1303. We can obviously see OP‚Äôs total level is 1560, which means they a has a total of 257 levels between runecrafting, slayer, and farming.
---
Further, we can see the bottom of their slayer level clearly is two different numbers, which would make sense since no level 3 skiller even has a slayer level in the 90s. 
---
If OP had 99 runecrafting and farming, their slayer level would be 77, which also doesn‚Äôt look like what the bottom of their slayer level looks like.

So yeah idk I‚Äôm stumped.

Not everything has to be for the sake of progression on a single account. I see the enjoyment in taking a break from the normal game to play with super fast xp rates, insanely powerful relics in custom challenging/wacky modes
---
Runescape players seem to forget that video games can be pointless fun, and don‚Äôt have to have an end goal or always be productive
---
I think they should put OSRS on Steam, I said this in 2012 and people got really upset at me. It really gave Realm of the Mad God a huuuuge boom in players permanently, I don't know if it'd do the same with OSRS but that game is wayyy more hardcore and niche than Runescape so it'd be a curious experiment. I found RS2 through Miniclip back in the day, having third party exposure is important.

Just realize that you might fail. I can't tell you how many times I've raged after I died. It helps to just realize you might have to do it again.

This is normal for a company. A company director will normally receive a director's wage which is about 8k a year. The rest of his wage is allowed to be paid as a dividend of the companies profit, this is a tax efficient way of receiving a wage from the company. They are retaining 4% of the profits within the company instead of removing 100% of profits which they are completely able to do.

It's a supply thing iirc. You only get rune essence in f2p and while under 30 mining in members.

I don't know why anyone would buy it, though. Considering f2p can use pure essence.

The two other GE-prices is the two profit margins you are 95% sure to lie between per day. These however are still skeewed a little since the calculation here assumes that you have 0% chance of getting maple, yew or magic seeds, which other people state they have gotten

So wtf is on a wrath rune

How would this work without bonds? Jagex just takes your GP and deletes it and gives you free membership while losing profit?

No way that would ever happen.

The M&amp;S rework on RS3 has a plethora of its own issues. The only reason things didn't become worse for the RS3 economy is because of the Invention buffer which added a separate outlet for items not tied to alch value. Furthermore, the M&amp;S rework actually failed to accomplish all of the goals Jagex outlined. As of right now, a large majority of items introduced with the M&amp;S rework have reached their high alch value, which means they have reached their price floor and demand is lower than supply.
---
Lowering the amount of money given adds another problem in that items currently circulating within the economy are immediately devalued. This has immediate short term effects similar to stock market crashes where the total assets individuals have instantly loses value. Likewise, we would face the Runescape equivalent of unemployment where accounts that camp rune dragons or any other monster that frequently drops rune alchables would be less worth killing. These players and accounts would thus move onto other activities due to the opportunity cost of other moneymakers becoming more worthwhile in comparison to rune dragons, causing more items to then lose value as more are pumped into the game economy.
---
The truth is no such thing as an isolated economy. The moment you try to solve one problem, two more problems will always rise up.
---
I'm against this particular update because it's not going to work out like everyone else thinks it will. Smithing will still remain a relatively useless skill. It would be better if other features were added to the smithing skill, thus expanding it rather than half-assedly reducing level requirements with no real thought for consequences.
---
Apparently I‚Äôve got 2 new channels to look through, because I‚Äôve never heard of either of these dudes.

Probably going to have to use account recovery service to do this. Click on the "Can't login?" button on the OSRS client on the login screen and put in a recovery request. I believe they'll let you change email once you do a successful recovery.
---
Just recover your own account. It will let you change your email that way. It will be easy because you already know the password.
---
I'm generally the opposite, I'm slow at pvm but I've gotten through the ratcatcher courtyard without getting clapped back to the entrance. I also never got caught on mm2's stealth section.

I also accidentally spaghetti'd preparing to run through iban's tornado funhouse after failing the agility checks just before him for an hour. I forgot to turn on my run and just straight-up walked to the altar and instagibbed him.
---
Meanwhile it took a good 8 tries or so to kill jad, vork (quest), galvek, and zulrah.
---
This was an unexpected to go about it but I am digging this new format
---
The account you described is some variation of a med level, normally a 75 atk/def, 77 prayer, and otherwise maxed combat acc. the only reason i can think of to shave off levels is to get into a lower bracket with maxed zerks at around 100 combat in both BH and PvP worlds. in deep wild mains will always be supreme, however, your account unlike mains will be able to hit maxed 1def pures. and vice versa of course. That could be a good or bad thing depending on what you want to do. personally i advise getting 77 prayer, its an insane power spike. also, if you plan on doing pvm content not having 75 attack is a nasty limitation. its great for pvp as well. Unless you plan on living in PvP/BH worlds I advise making a normal med/go full main. on the other hand, it doesn't hurt to try out making a build with lower stats and then train them up if you don't like the build you made.
---
I'm excited for it, don't have a maxed account though I am \~merely months away\~ (2200+), plenty of endgame stuff I haven't done. I'm still also planning to play group iron man, i just appreciate leagues being one more way of spending time on the game in a new context, hopefully it ends up being fun.
---
I understand the frustrations with not being able to multilog on one account between game modes, but I'm not particularly upset about it myself.
---
Actually it's a teardrop, because Runecrafting makes us cry.
---
Oh wait nvm, you can't change the login email. I didn't read the entire post sorry
---
It's lizardmen shamans. It's a 1/5000 drop rate
---
This meme is 3 years old and we overdid it.
---
I‚Äôm interested as well. I‚Äôm the Ron Swanson of Osrs. I love free things.
---
It's like the other guy said. There's a lot of items in this game that have been added that should be a much higher level than what they are currently considering how powerful they are. It's both the communities and Jagex's fault tbh. No way in hell would the blowpipe or even things like the twisted bow or ghrazi rapier would pass a poll if their required levels were 85-90 because many people would just see it as power creep. If it's kept at a low level, it has a much higher chance of passing a poll because it's not seen as power creep.
---
I mean yeah, at some point I read that even Jagex was aware that around 50% of their playerbase has been involved in RWT at one point or another, it's not worth them losing 6-7 million dollars in subscription/bond revenue to ban someone who bought GP to continue playing the game. 
---
Sure the whales buy GP to stake and lose it and then they buy more and more until they're up a lot and cash out, but i'd say &gt;90% of gp buying transactions are between 5-100m and are from players who would rather get the gear needed to do content they want rather than grind for 50 hours. Those are players that will continue to play the game, but would be put off if they had to actually grind for gp. 
---
Jagex is between a rock and a hard place, and because of that buying GP is inexplicably safe, compared to any of the other bannable rule breaking offenses.
---
Or it let's them see all the fun stuff near the end and will make them want to grind to get to the end
---
Why does everyone hate runespan?
---
It isn't dropping at any significant rate concurrent users means little. It is also the time of year people quit en mass for uni, summers over, we've been seeing that decline included in people getting bored because of no new content and mobile users giving up. New players are 100% gaining, concurrent users isn't a great indicator of playerbase as it is only tracks users logged in at the same time instead of total unique users.

alternatively a guthix shield could be an ultra rare drop from all gwd generals. that could be neat lore wise, especially considering guthix dies sometime between rs2 and rs3

As a rs3 play this is why osrs didn‚Äôt make sense for me. It‚Äôs grindyscape vs manageablly-grindy-scape. I don‚Äôt need to prove to myself that I can runecraft for 1000 hours straight
---
There's a issue with that which is that steam takes a cut of the sales meaning our membership prices will either increase or they add more microtransactions so it's not a good idea whatsoever.
---
Also ''Realm of the mad god'' only hits 1k players at peak its quite a dead game compared to OSRS.
---
Yes, it will add the membership to your current membership amount.
---
Your game related apps are based on the types of game searches you do. If you don't do gambling related app searches, you won't see any that are related. This post is just a garbage circle jerk as all the OP had to do was look up gambling gaming apps prior, then look up RS3 mobile. 
---
Ex: I look up a lot of tower mobile app games and over time, my related game suggestions are some kind of tower mobile game or something similar.
---
Tweet at jagex support every day and hope you get a response
---
It surely does. It just adds 14 days to your membership. If you're a monthly membership subscriber then you'll find that you get rebilled a bit later too (72 hours before your membership runs out).

I support loadouts/presets/whatever they'd be called, as long as we prevent them from being used for skilling. Whether that's by adding a cooldown, restricting the items that are allowed (no unfinished potions etc.), or something else.
---
Holy heck Geraldine

which is not a good reason to want higher tier content

&gt; But he's getting information from Twitter???
---
Asking for qualified individuals to weigh in isn't quite the same thing.
---
These days, their videos are very well sourced, and they've even gone back and removed/redone videos that they no longer believe stand up to their new standards. 
---
Good channel, imo.
---
It happened to me and it got unbanned, they work fast
---
Kinda ironic to call someone thick when you just got hacked
---
Sure, but you don't think it's worrying that the rate at which it's dropping hasn't really gotten lower? Prior to mobile, OSRS population was pretty steady and even rising. It's only dropping now with no apparent slowing down.
---
It's not dead until someone says mist runes symbolise the fact they mist their chance to post a rune meme
---
My OG account is from 2004. 5239 days

So does that mean it's just a normal rope that signifies nothing but a lie?

Shift click &gt; mark object. Mark each one as it glows. It won't work if they aren't glowing when you mark them. It's one of the indicator plugins on RL.

they're looking for people in Twitter with credentials

I understand, however the form is the same whether it's for OSRS or RS3 is it not?

lol, "HD" is 699MB, "Full HD" 1.6GB and "Ultra HD" 14GB for Iron Man 2. Definitely hits the target audience but I still want an Eric Andre version of this and am 100% sure the atmosphere will be spot on. It would‚Äôve triggered his next lengthy, pre-prepared speech on how the world has stuff like this happened before social media too so it wasn't a fart it was a lot closer to water than air is. compartments filled with booze would still cause the boat to get to bergusia forge is (shows how much he made on that last panel makes it a women's costume but omg this is so bad, not for being a good jedi
---
Very slowly, so that by the time you finish the energy pot you are out of run anyways.
---
Give better information. I‚Äôve been loads of appeals some I got the account back some I didn‚Äôt. But essentially it‚Äôs all about info and your info isn‚Äôt good enough. Plus are you sure you are recovering the right account? You mention you remember your name, was that your character name cos it may not be the accounts name.
---
What kind of spell u cast with this?
---
I think a lot of people wanted to try osrs for the first time. Maybe thinking it was like other mobile games where you cna pick it up and get instant gratification for 30 minutes of play time; but the game isn't designed for that.
---
Also If you look at Oct. 2013 until present day, the player base has steadily gone up, doubling in size. That's an impressive fact I didn't know about.
---
Hell yeah man! Cox is waaaaaay more fun than most other repetitive money makers. I will note that learner/casual Cox is calculated to be *slightly* less gp/hr than efficient Vorkath, but since Cox money comes in the form of rarer, bigger drops as opposed to a steady stream of small drops it's harder to calculate a reliable gp/hr.
---
Another thing I'd add is that a dragon pickaxe, while not being in the minimum gear pic (anymore), should be an early upgrade as it significantly speeds up the guardian room.
---
yeah i don't really get the added value of this..  
---
if i have to click a button to open the interface for wearing gear and then after equipping to open bank again, just closing bank, equipping, and opening bank basically already accomplishes the same thing. seems like a circlejerk feature that has no real use.

I gave them everything, and have instantly been denied, surely they are not able to process my request under 30 seconds?
---
12 years ago? That account is on rs3. Even if you got that account back, it would be brand new on osrs and you'd still need to start over. Just ditch it and make a new account unless you're REALLY REALLY REALLY attached to that username.
---
oh i am aware, there is just something about the feeling of having membership "stored" on my account for future use
---
I know but the form for recovery is the same fkr RS3 and OSRS.
---
You should only invoke his name in a holy manner.
---
Or possibly they've exhausted the ways they normally use and will vet whoever talks to them? You're drawing really weird conclusions here.
---
Back then you logged in via character name, so it was the account name.
---
We need another Winter 2017
---
They aren't, and basically it seems inactive accounts that got recovered are easily appealable whereas a hijacked account or one in use is not (because that person is paying)
---
thanks mate Im using Snap rslauncher.  
---
Was easy enough to install
---
The weirdest conclusion is suggesting there's no other way to make contact with economists besides Tweet replies.
---
Yes based on the older game RuneScape 2, welcome to the sub I guess?
---
Nice blade of sailing
---
It‚Äôs sounds like you got an automated response. You‚Äôll need to contact them. I‚Äôd go through forgotten login. Only contact button I can find.
---
IIRC you have to tag it with something or the automod gets pissy
---
Former MMK said 3-5 years
---
They've already run polls with only stuff that nearly passed before, so I guess you can expect them to do it again
---
I guess I really should show my log and ask for some reddit luck. The nice thing is, I‚Äôm not an ironman and I do zulrah for hopes at mutagen/pet and not for the uniques.
---
Yep! Defensive cast if you aren't 99 defense already.
---
nah it's just general vorkath tips. Try to only eat during frozen/acid phase (if you don't woox walk(I don't)), that way you keep your dps up when you can do damage. if you waste any time eating that can severely shorten your trip.

Shut up

More endgame raids content is a dumb idea. Yes, endgame players need something new BUT mid tier group content is seriously lacking. Dungeoneering was amazing because it involved all combat and skill levels. CoX and ToB are all endgame content for near maxed accounts.

For all bankstanding skilling it'd probably significantly reduce effort and increase speed, which is why he mentions it'd be alright if it was only equipment.

I loved classic so much :( all my school mates went over to rs2 and i stayed back on classic for another year or two :( was lonely
---
Yeah I haven't been playing at all since around March/April this year, which was after 3 years of steadily playing, which was after 2 years of time off, which was after playing steadily after OSRS release. I know I'll be back, it's just a matter of when not if.
---
Well get them reports sent in. Too bad it's the only way to deal with them. I'm a pmod and that's about all I can do too
---
It changes the argument. Saying that adding a tiny amount of lag to an already far larger amount of lag is okay is far more reasonable then saying that two more deaths is okay. By going to the extreme you devalue the discussion and your own argument IMO. The base argument you have is good, but now we are discussing this instead of the contents of the discussion.
---
It's already out, we've seen people play it in theatre mode already.
---
Thing is theatre mode sucks ass, and I'm not impressed. I also want vr runescape but I promise you nothing will ever come of it. Barely anyone has vr as of currently so it's not like anyone is in a rush to develop for it (at least not until half life 3 comes out on vr). If someone ever makes something that's even close to a convincing vr experience for old school runescape it's going to be more like those "relaxing beach" experiences where you can only look around. And they'll use the video maker orb that only YouTubers have access to. That's the best you'll ever get if it ever happens.
---
"I had to click inside of the bank interface 3 times for my bank standing skills, so you should have to too" - people obsessed with ehp thinking that literally anyone would recognize them for it anywhere in their lives outside of their forum alts

Never done mimic. Is it that easy? Or really lucky with hits
---
Can you include a screenshot of that? 
---
I mean either way you're fucked unfortunately, but it'd shut up the doubters.
---
How did you do it?
---
Never raid with randos. Never do anything with randos..
---
daddy thanos cummies
---
I just dont see how people think someone getting a ffa tbow would ghost and double name change
---
I think I got really lucky with hits? No one in my pvm clan has seen any better time.
---
no way, forgetting to put on way worse. such a loss of dps in mysts
---
What are you even saying..? Im saying, if a clan of 20 is on you, even at MB when you are full tbed and no chance of escaping, you can just freeze the guy on you and dd and log out, thats a dumb af mechanic lol, even for solo players.
---
Edit: now i know what you mean, the only who can logout is the one who got the last hit, not the other way around. Go to a pvp world and try, so the one entangling you and dding on you without hitting you will be able to log, not you and a hybrid will hop on you. (This also happened in 2009-2011 pvp worlds when they fucked up the pj timer)

Twitter is the safespace where all of the 2006 purists go to whine and circlejerk about their "achievements being devalued"
---
Nah people will still go even big clan events don't stop people. Pro tip to not getting pked there. Don't bring craw bow, or chain mace.
---
When a group of pkers log in they're all making split second decisions on who has the most loot. So if you come in with no gear besides a blow pipe you are somewhere on the bottom of that list, right next to the looting bots who you are trying to look like. You're still going to get killed, the idea is you won't be attacked right away like you would if you looked like you had something worth while. Just that alone should give you enough time to run 2 levels south and telly.
---
Holy cow, April 2002. That's a great account

Ya just hoping i could shine some light on this possible issue i've reported them as i see them and screenshot their stats

Oh ok gotcha

I appreciate the joke, but like I said, only trying to play while we are laying out on the beach and she's reading and I'm just sitting there hahah.
---
Ah, I see now.
---
50 rubles have been deposited into your account.
---
I suppose I could see that happening with things that require multiple different types of mats needed. But even then, I don't see it being anywhere near game changing.
---
Yet it requires like a million times more runecrafting xp to make. Makes no sense.
---
Bonds cost too much right now to make it worth playing casually. The new game mode on Zeah looks like fun though, I‚Äôm going to check it out.
---
don't raid with random kids problem solved lol. literally what obligation does he have to give you the tbow? none.  always expect very valuable items like that to be scammed.
---
They did give a bad release date of 2018, but they did say they couldn't work on it until they were happy with osrs mobile.  
---
So it did delay them a bit.  
---
On top of that, they then needed to wait for the rs3 bank rework to be done to get that same team to work on mobile.
---
Guys did we do this last year?
---
Thought I was in /r/bitcoin for a moment.

I tested it out, 100% on farming, 50% on hard wood (maho), comes out with a total loot of 1.25m (435k ish for wood + nest). 
---
Notable seeds: 6x snapdragon, 2x ranarr, 2x yew, 2x maple, 24x snapgrass, maybe 50k worth of some other random seed (willows, kwuarm, limp, ..) rest were mostly worthless seeds. 
---
29k profit per day. That sound pretty average if you ask me.. that's around what I usually get from 100% hardwood maho + 50% coal.
---
Then again, it all depend of what you're aiming for, and if you are or not an ironman. I'm holding on the mahogany logs to turn them into plank later on (for magic exp/construction) and the coal for blast furnace, and in all honesty, I think that's a better investment as an ironman than seeds. Keep in mind that I've no ironman and my knownledge on them is very limited so I might be wrong.
---
I dunno why you keep replying to me I'm not the OP

Loving what im seeing so far. Bring on the rest of season 2 already. Can hardly contain the excitement!
---
They kind of already did. Just chin at Forthos Dungeon spiders assuming you have overheads.
---
It‚Äôs 100% normal, if not expected in companies that are not expected to grow significantly in the mid-long term.  I assume that after the release of mobile, Jagex no longer sees significant growth potential and is now enjoying the payout of its previous investments.
---
it's not patronization if what I'm identifying is backed up with evidence, just like my claims were. you lack any sense of rocognition that how you present yourself puts off that youre supremely right, immediately. sorry that calling you out has upset you, I hope you can figure out why it upsets you with time.

Never underestimate the power and volume of NEET sweatys that play this game. If they had to suffer and do it the hard way, so do you, never mind that it would literally benefit everyone and would change almost nothing other than adding some convenience.

No, literally scum for deliberately putting your own happiness over someone else's and being a selfish greedy cunt, keeping a reward all to yourself when you easily could have shared it with the people who helped you earn it, and who only helped you earn it because they expected that everyone would share the fruits of their collective efforts
---
C'mon dude they reach you this shit in elementary school. If you're claiming it's okay to just keep something that people work hundreds of hours to obtain, using people who only helped you get it because there was an understanding that you'd share with tnem beforehand, you're being deliberately dense. You know this isn't anywhere close to one kid not letting another play with the ball for a while, it's a group of people working hours and hours towards a rare and exciting opportunity and one member of that group irreparably ruining it for the other people out of greed

Been doing raids with randoms for Wedoraids for a while now and handed out 20-30mil splits on more than one occasion because the drop was in my name the last 3 uniques in a row, let myself get fooled into forgetting I'm in a community comprised 95% of assholes who wouldn't bother to return the favor, never raiding with any of y'all again lmao

You don't even understand what I'm telling you yet you're talking about plugging ears lmao. I said intelligence is ONE factor, the other huge factor is motivation, which most people lack for these things.
---
It's INFINITELY easier and most importantly more FUN to play video games or go outside and do whatever you feel like doing than putting in thousands of hours into a study or craft which by many people is regarded as boring. This is why only a tiny amount of people are very successful while the rest are putting all their spare time into video games or going out while having average jobs.
---
"Just go put 20k hours into being a painter or scientist lmao". The fact that you're comparing shit like that to playing video games is hilarious. You're comparing apples to oranges, 10k hours doing what you find fun isn't equivalent to 10k hours studying, most people hate the latter.
---
Pmod material tbh

What does TIL stand for?
---
I disagree that it ruins the experience unless you spend like $100-200 on bonds TBH.

And they could buy money anyway, I don‚Äôt think Jagex has a big enough team to catch everyone buying small amounts of gold

That shit doesn't fly on Reddit. That's a YouTube thing. While it *can* be funny, it's so disgustingly overused and is the lowest hanging fruit on the 'humor tree' so to speak.

Guy: ok. Where do I pay you?

Me: give me money first.  
---
Guy: why would you want the money on this account? I'm buying this account...

Me: YOU HAVE SEEN THROUGH MY TRAP YUGI BOI. BUT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS ONE!!!! TRIMMING ARMOR 5K.  
---
I pretty much tried to "sell" my account to someone but I was going to try to scam them by having them pay the account I was selling.... I'm fucking stupid. And no I didnt get smarter.

Why does jagex invoke the occult into their game with a satanic star on his chest, they use pentagrams also. The game is also hell bent on flashing 666 to its players, makes you wonder what religion the pro gamers and designers are apart of

I definitely made some mistakes so I wouldn‚Äôt be entirely surprised. Lesson learned though and it has been quite some time!

Why would you comment the first thing you said? People, mostly, aren't even against things because they want others to go through the same thing but people do want things easier for themselves. Idk how you can bring up 1 side and say it's wrong when the other side is far more wrong. It's how you end up with AFK methods for every skill that give the best xp rates. Looking at RS3.
---
Correct. I dont see that as a personalised message same as quest dialogue is not personalised for me purely because it says my username.
---
For example Lynx and Hey Jase didn't both get a beer chat dialogue popup when hitting it. So those are different entirely custom personalised messages.
---
I am all for a chatbox saying "Congratulations (username) on reaching 200m in every skill! Truly amazing!" Etc.

Just like how right now the chatbox says congratulations you are now level 73 woodcutting.

I can see how one could make that connection, there's definitely overlap between the two in certain arguments, but they're both their own things. An analogy is a fallacy if it's a false equivalency, and I don't think comparing instanced boss rooms to people dying of cancer was an apt comparison.

You're implying it by basically saying that if you can sit on your ass playing video games that you can also become a genius in an actual useful study which is just beyond idiotic. It's mind boggling to me how someone can even compare these 2 things and unironically keep defending this terrible argument.

And you know who controls that? The management, and their job is to maximize profit. If you want to play a game where the developers are treated decently at all or have control over the content, only buy indie. No big studio treats its employees better than livestock.

Youre right, but still.

here is my advice. when you start your slayer grind do 9 tasks with Turael in Burthorpe and do your 10 task at Konar. Use the points in the following order:
---
Block List/extensions
---
Superiors
---
Ring Bling
---
Slayer helm
---
Rune Pouch
---
you can get upwards of 1k points in a few hours so this should be a very easy grind. Also if you cant do Konar slayer dont use this method. Vannaka is not worth using lol

$11
