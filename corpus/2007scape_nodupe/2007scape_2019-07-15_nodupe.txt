Pvm or boss pet hunting is what is fun for me, some people enjoy skilling, others deal with it to get the benefits
---
Taking your own path is what makes it fun, nothing is mandatory but obviously benefits come from certain skills quests etc
---
I feel like he was fighting me.
---
This a tip how to break up with my girlfriend? My wife would probably appreciate it.
---
i don't know why more people don't complain about this quest. it's very one small favouresque
---
Well damn. Mind sharing your endless wisdom as to how you completed it without going back through the underground path?
---
I'd rather eat chalk than do this quest again
---
Yeah, I found this quest after I got a master clue scroll from easy hunting. Ironically I need to do quests to get the bard some barrows gloves  so I did it
---
It teleports with you.
---
Might actually go do this. Found a guide that I would opt to use:

I don't have a problem with it other than that there are plenty of rats and seagulls to splash elsewhere, but he chooses to splash hill giants out of spite since it was removed from Lumbridge.
---
Quick fix would be to just add a dummy somewhere (wizard tower?) that can be splashed on and ban this sort of behavior since it kind of is disruptive.
---
I like the idea of the superiors, it would make it a bit more challenging and fun without changing too much.
---
Add superiors at a random amount, and for every 1 killed maybe the whole team comes out with another point. IDK
---
Isnt there a subreddit for this kind of fuck up?
---
Genuinely curious about this.
---
2 hours of failing and haven't been back since
---
No because you should be thieving for cakes at level 5
---
I think people who play like this enjoy that setup because either TV alone or OSRS alone isn’t enough stimulation. Osrs helps through the commercials and tv through the afk parts of training
---
The two are so intertwined it's not even worth saying something like this.
---
I understand what you are saying. However, I see this game as being quite liked by its players. Maybe it's not liked, but it certainly is played a lot.
---
That sort of brings up a question of why they should change it? After all, from a purely economic point of view, this product has demand. If they change it, would it still have the same demand?
---
The sort of extreme through process is this: are players simply addicted and not enjoying the game? Should the game just be deleted then?
---
However, I think that people either enjoy the grind or enjoy the late game content after the grind.
---
Yeah then you get bored as shit cause you’re killing monsters to level slayer and gaining xp in skills that don’t matter
---
Wait...am I not supposed to be flat packing my mahogany tables?
---
Nice
---
Teleports genius
---
To be fair, you never said SOME either. You just said pkers. The implication is all from that statement, not some.
---
Umm id say just go for monkey madness as a good first big goal so you can get your D Scim for combat training.
---
200M only net you 4 pets? that kinda sucks
---
Lol😂
---
Reddit Sync!!
---
It's one of the better ones. If you haven't done desert treasure yet you will enjoy that too.
---
Browsing this reddit is just as addicting as playing.. I shouldn’t even be posting/browsing while I’m trying to take a break from it 😂
---
Well honestly if you played runescape for a long time.. it's a really fun and rewarding experience.. it's really refreshing
---
I remember wheb they released runrspan actually made runecrafting enjoyable
---
I’m on a path to get that so I can do hard varrock for more staffs
---
Just bear in mind when people say it takes 30 mins they are assuming you have moritania legs
---
The dream police are all inside of my head
---
brother people like this 99% of the time just give away their info on fake phishing streams/emails/forum links/discord links etc. nobody gets brute forced in 2019.
---
At what agility level is this reasonable to do?
---
Made this suggestion 2 weeks before your original post aswell, hopefully one of us gets noticed soon.

Got in an argument with someone in the CC I'm in about this. He's a nearly maxed player that says he enjoys osrs over any other mmo he has ever played. 
---
Someone in the CC was complaining about doing mm2. The nearly maxed player says something along the lines "well at least it's better than go kill X amount of creature quests in other MMOs"
---
I asked him if he likes slayer. "Oh yeah that's my favorite skill by far" do you prefer slayer or questing? "Slayer, I like quests but slayer is more enjoyable" but slayer is just the go kill X amount of creature quests in other games "no they're completely different" 
---
After going back and forth he just told me I have no idea what I'm talking about.

When collector steps forward to load, equip the mind shield and use your hotkey to switch to prayers tab. Click the prayer your mouse is on 2-3 times, then switch back to your inventory using hotkey. Click mind shield again, hotkey back to prayers and click only 1 prayer this time. Tab back to inventory and click mind shield for the last time. Finally, spam click the ground as queen is taking damage to break any extra prayer interfaces and end the wave. When you become familiar with force-ending wave 10 with mind shields, you can make minor adjustments. If queen is close to cannon, you might do only 2 mind shield loops or stack less prayers. If queen is far away, you might do an extra loop. The method explained above may lose you a couple ticks sometimes, but is generally a safe way to get most of the possible time save.
---
Usually it's not worth it for profit solely, the people who recommend it haven't done the math or don't care about money (pet hunters).
---
Well it just disappeared for me.
---
I used to play rs3 and i got ptsd
---
Work towards the fairy ring teleport system! Then the grand tree. You’ll be getting around in no time. 
---
Other than that buy teleport tabs or stamina potions.
---
easiest 8m i ever made LOL
---
Simple. Don't be a nerd that plays like 10 accounts and you're safe.
---
This is probably the best answer with the email being a random string of letters, I'm about to do the same for my rs account.
---
according to https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Crafting_soul_runes even soul runes is still 45m profit if you did it for 9m xp
---
I would agree. The content in this post is about how it takes forever to get to where slayer is profitable and references a skill lvl of at least 60 but the thing is it takes almost no time to get to 60 slayer. If getting slayer up to make money isn’t reasonable, I wouldn’t know what else to recommend. To get money out of a skill you have to put time in to level it first..
---
I find it a very ableist title.
---
Obby legs if you have money to throw around. If not then I don’t think it’s a big deal but it probably will help a little bit over the dragon legs. Other than that I can’t think of any use outside of NMZ.
---
Fruit and Tree seeds are expensive though, at 96 farming sounds accurate with all the dragonfruit/magic trees, 45 mill isn't a lot if applied to other skills.
---
I just did all the sub quests for rfd and I can't figure out what to do for these next 30qps I need. I feel quested out now.
---
my advice would be dont worry about money too much and work on untradeables/free goals and your stats money will come as you play, i see a lot of new players want 500m banks and all bis gears but imo working towards stuff like nezzy, barrows gloves, void, torso, diary rewards etc will put you at a better place than camping blue dragon for weeks to afford an abbyssal dagger (i did this btw)

Can we stop upvoting these like i ha e 2k cerb kills in my log w/o a single drop, and guess what, all those kills are pre drop log, meaning only the kills are recorded
---
Never heard that example outside of in relation to questing.
---
Other MMOs idea of quests 99% of the time is a fetch or kill quest. "Go here and collect / kill this". You go there, do 5 quests at a time, run back to your hub. Rinse and repeat until the next hub. The story quests riddled in the mix are mainly just lore with a few good quests with bosses or cutscenes every hour or so, especially in newer / higher level content. 
---
Whereas RS quests are actually stories every time. While some still definitely are just "go talk to this guy and then he'll tell you to talk to this monkey". There's only a few quests that are just that.
---
But when it comes to the overall game, the selling point of RS to me is not being locked into anything. There's no profession choosing, no class creation. It gives you the whole game and you can pick and choose what you want to do.
---
You could fish. or mine
---
Iirc, invisible boosts like the Guild don't work, but visible ones like the dragon axe do.
---
Was talking about the green dhide chaps, but thanks

(YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPPEND)

Technically it's possible to kill five thousand chickens and not get a single feather drop.

It's just really unlucky, tbh.

I didn't know there was a 10th circle of hell.

Very fun unless someone makes opinions i dont like. Then is makes me angry.
---
410 Chests, im good on my strategy lol but thank-you
---
Not true. Killing all brothers gives a better chance at an item, though.
---
Agreed
---
I think your kind of missing the point of why people love this game:
---
----
---
Runescape for the most part is an afk grinding game that you can relax and play. The whole charm is that it isn't engaging you can play the game and do literally anything else. 
---
Then when your feeling like you want to get now involved we've got PvM challenges,  Quests, PVP, and more. Making it feel like their was a point to everything you were doing. 
---
That's what makes runescape, runescape. People like it this way and it's never changing.
---
If you average this drop and that guthans body drop in your invent youre doing far above average
---
I'm suwpwised dis is an eastew egg not many know about. dis was a huge ding back in de day to gain effigies.

clue stashes for one
---
You can start working on achievement diaries! These can give some pretty good perks. I recommend the Ardougne and Lumbridge diaries to start.
---
How would anything else be better? The bottleneck is where the data is coming from. The data is coming from OSBuddy since OSBuddy tracks the trades of its users and they have their api publicly available for anyone to use.
---
OSBuddy can't track the trades of runelite/official client users, because, well, they aren't using their client... And the other clients don't track the trades or make the data public.
---
There is nothing that can be done to fix it or make it better, except getting more people to use OSBuddy so that they have more data.
---
No skill is exciting in this game. Period. And at that same time no skill comes close to slayer in terms of variety and freedom. 
---
Go train woodcutting. You either cut this tree... Or you cut that tree. The only difference being one is more XP and one is more afk and gp. That's that whole skill. Every buyable aside from con and pray is just sit at a bank and do it.
---
Slayer you can choose which master you want, block things you don't enjoy, go bossing while training the skill.
---
And the most important thing that most people seem to miss, is it's an entertaining and varied way to train **6 other skills.** Magic, ranged, attack, strength, defence and hit points are all trained through slayer. Your alternatives there? Go afk 5 quest bosses over and over, or go burst/chin in tunnels for hours spending lots of gp. 
---
Training slayer is more than just the slayer XP/hr. It's a variety mixed bag of whatever kind of playstyle you want (bossing, high XP, good profit etc.) With some mix-ups like wildy slayer or even Konar. All the while maxing your combat skills in an actually engaging way 
---
Seriously it's fine to not like combat in this game, it's hardly exciting..but to say slayer isn't a league above the rest of the skills in this game is a bit short sighted.
---
High Alch and rings of recoil are good. You can just afk and make some reasonable bank. Also don't be scared of killing green dragons in the wilderness. I've been doing it for months and haven't been PK'd because you can just tele out.
---
That's not how Runescape works
---
Last entity.
---
This might require it's own thread, but I am looking to get one of my best friends a 3d-printed figurine of his Runescape character with no gear and a tentacle whip for his birthday coming up since he has a problem with staking. He got me back into Runescape and has been my gaming buddy for a little over a decade now, would anyone know if there is a way for me to extract a model character or of any place I can pay to have it modeled.  
---
I assume it would be relatively easy but I'm not too knowledgable in this area.
---
Lol same argument but for pc? Or even mobile?
---
If you’re new to OSRS just aim for quest cape it’ll show you all the new areas and give you decent base stats. Raids etc is end game content for the most part and not really worth doing until 110+ combat
---
Good on you mate
---
the fireworks is enough to keep me going
---
I am in the process of getting the hard diary.  I forgot that my agility is 70, with plans to obviously getting to 71.  I really have no idea where to start with farming.  I want to try to do ranarr runs since I have a ton of seeds from hoarding drops but I really haven't looked into where to begin with it.  
---
I have not done mm2 yet.
---
If you ask for 2 min in the boss room it kicks you outside
---
read that big orange box
---
Side note: It bothers me when someone says the RS3 economy is trash. How do you define trash?
---
There is liquidity and there are reasonable margins for most items. This is the same as OSRS. 
---
Bandos is not worth anything on RS3 GE? Well yeah, its mid game gear there, maybe late game due to invention.
---
Supplies are cheaper in terms of terms of OSRS GP? Sure, the game has been around for longer and there are more pvm sources. More supply, less demand.
---
RS3 Bonds are cheaper for membership than OSRS bonds? That just speaks to the fact that OSRS is more popular than RS3 since the exchange is the only thing that determines this difference. 
---
They are cheaper now than two weeks ago? OSRS bonds also go through cycles over short periods. There was also a summer promo recently that increased demand.
---
I wholeheartedly agree that OSRS is better than RS3 and at times I will agree that RS3 is trash (it certainly an mtx ruined game). However, I'm not sure why the economy is trash.
---
You based it over a small sample size, it's rng.
---
Cya at the top.
---
It's just that this game is very easy and unengaging, even high level PvM doesn't really involve or need teamwork, it's just a bunch of people whacking the same NPC while running around.
---
Barrows is all rng. You could make 3m an hour if u get the right drops.
---
when he alt tabs between clients its functionally no different to the client to seeing the mouse jump.
---
in an example with only 2 clients, lets say the mouse is at (X,Y) on client A, then he alt tabs to client B and moves the mouse to position (W,Z) then alt tabs back to client A
---
From jagex perspective monitoring client A, since it wasnt getting mouse inputs while minimized behind client B all they see is the mouse jump from (X,Y) to (W,Z)
---
It's no different than when skillers used ahk to jump down a certain number of pixels to the withdraw-x option or the use/drop options on items. Except instead of always jumping 37/54/72 pixels its a bunch of seemingly random jumps. I dont know if the jumps being more random seeming makes it more or less likely for him to be detected.
---
Jagex decided all these jumps both his seemingly random ones and the skiller pixel jumps should be considered against the rules in January 2017
---
ok
---
I have the Void Range helm, I need to get the Melee and mage helms, few more hours in PC will help. Yeah Rigor was a hasty buy, I could have done DS2 with just eagle eye, but it's done.
---
Stats? Gear? Hard diaries? 
---
I’m 75/75 range and magic with pretty budget gear and hard diaries done and make anywhere from 500k-1m an hour depending on whether or not I get a piece. Also can do anywhere from 9-12 chests an hour.
---
Its 1m per hour u just suck
---
That you have to peace together similarly to slug menace (I think that's the one to get through the door to the prince? It's been a while)
---
A stable internet connection is 10/10 internet?  Are you in a third world country? lol
---
You use PVM items to pvm???
---
Sounds like a personal problem Ive played for over 10 years and if i feel like im getting bored of the grind i just... Logout until i feel like grinding again...
---
Why tf would you ever have to do that?
---
on reddit it seems like skillers jumping to withdraw-x/drop is still attacked as cheating and should be rightfully banned, but this is widely praised and theres mostly outrage about his ban
---
if anything hes automating a lot more than the average skiller ever did, if what most skillers were doing should be banned then he absolutely should be, but if you accept what skillers do as ok, then his script is debatable
---
Well said !
---
Prayer and 90 herb are done :)
---
Why con just curious
---
I think a single player skyrim esque game set in gilenor with the grind toned back could be a fantastic game. Separate from 07scape because there is an avid and loyal playerbase but still holding many of the hallmarks of the original.
---
Questing. By the end of it (getting all the requirements) you'll have decent stats. Same with achievement diaries. 
---
Once you get the hard diaries done, you're (almost) at end game. That in itself will take months for a new/casual player. It's a great goal to have and will give you the tools and information needed to go further
---
Adding to this, wiki assumes 16 chests per hour with 1.165m profit. Given that you get 7 chests, you should expect about 509K per hour. 
---
You can improve the quality of your runs and should expect better RNG on average in order to see more profits.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Barrows
---
Now I'm gonna say something that's hard to believe but what if I told you that the bank on top of lumbridge castle is faster to bank at than the rfd chest?
---
Why’re you fumin mate? Are you just that guy’s alt account or smth?
---
Considering 99% of the time they talk back and say "Oh yeah that sounds smart" i'm gonna go with no, they probably aren't most of the time.
---
Seems like an issue with the game stop and not Jagex. do you have pictures of the front of it as if it was just bought? or did you purely go off what the guy said. because it seems like you were mis-lead.
---
Against sub rules
---
Best I can get mine to do it move the camera so I don't log...

---
I felt the sarcasm was obvious but apparently it wasn't.
---
invade area 51(#gnomechild)
---
he has not chopped it once, at all, did not move or reply or nothing. No logs on ground, no teleport, nothing.
---
There's only 8 (I think) instances of the boss in every world and to prevent people from clogging up those instances while afk they added a timer. If you don't start the next fight (ring a bell at the top of the tower) with in 2 minutes of finishing your last kill it kicks you out. 
---
It's particularly annoying with this boss because it drops anywhere from 3 to 10+ items on a kill so there's a big pile of loot on the ground for almost your whole trip there. So if literally anything comes up in the middle of your trip you need to scrap the trip, drop your food, and pick up your loot, or risk losing all your loot.
---
Like if you open another window, or go to the bathroom,then any extra food on the floor is gone.
---
Thanks. Have to do more quests
---
I'm not gonna not cannon suqahs or dagannoths lol
---
i dont know why youre showing the other people alting, the issue is the legality of using a script to alt tab between clients because its functionally no different to scripting mouse jumps
---
Okay?
---
I think it’s one of if not the most useful capes in the game.
---
Most/all skills have an option for a much faster method that requires more focus/clicks. Use those training methods. I enjoy the game and occasionally enjoy watching a movie on the side. That doesn't mean I dislike "the grind"
---
GwUPS* ahh uwu bewwe dewphine I wuvies uw bad wutas now in gonna die because uw soap isn't edibwe xux uwu  
---
Same types of pkers who 5v1 clue hunters and tell them to sit and kill themselves, did the last guy log lmfao?
---
I feel this comment. Feel like I gotta max OSRS since I never did RS3 lol.
---
Kinda sad no custom max cape. So guess I’ll be reppin the max saradomin cape if I ever manage to lol.
---
Love ur cosplay genuinely made me smile
---
I only did regicide so I wouldn’t have to go through the underground pass for hard clues but even then it’s still a pain in the ass.
---
This should not be an argument. It is completely unacceptable that Jagex has such grey areas within their rules and bans players when they please and without real reason
---
Ha. It was nerfed. There's a update on it on the osrs page. 
---
But basically areas around lumbridge the nerf happened.
---
It's just not logical for the boss to be worse than the regulars.  You can afk gargs and make more money than GGs
---
I'd like them to buff granite cballs or add more various non tradable slayer awards to make them a useful grind
---
I use virustotal as a website I’m not sure if they do full scans though
---
The issue is that mod tyran has already said that the method is not in violation of the rules.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Unless they want to amend that statement, and create a rule stating that stacking clients and using alt tab/alt escape/etc to navigate between clients is against the rules? 
---
things are getting unfairly arbitrary at this point, I think, but maybe not.
---
Is it quest locked? Where exactly is it?
---
Why is training slayer suggested as such a good money maker? You might as well just suggest "combat" as a money making skill. Actively training slayer (aside from task only bosses, but those are noway near low level) will never be as profitable as just killing what makes good money. The new undead druids, locust riders, shamans, brutal red dragons can be killed without a slayer level and give good money. Barrows, godwars dungeon, and almost all the bosses don't need a slayer level. You can also train slayer up to a profitable milestone and just kill those monsters off task, like dust devils or kurasks. Doing 1 profitable task and then 2 shitty ones won't earn you money faster than just camping a profitable monster.
---
Just do barrows and train slayer
---
Why make it inappropriate in the first place. 
---
And no
---
Who is he and what did he do?
---
when u roll a hit there is still a 0 as an option for the damage dealt
---
Alright, both games are not pay to win at all. You can even make money trading prime items from Warframe and PvP are not the main focus of both games.
---
humor
---
Switch it to hard custom, stick to obby till you have 93 health, then go to DH
---
Like someone else said, mith darts are great at whatever crabs and certain slayer tasks
---
Pretty weird for someone to post this and not have played for a year. Or is that code for I play everyday but I don’t admit it cause my accounts fucking trash
---
i guess i don't understand why there is a "when opposite" wouldnt ur hit chance be 0 by default?
---
You can clearly see that he has 11 hp though, he fucking lied to us!
---
I like the bottom warning in the bottom lol
---
You sure it wasn't the snapchat filter?
---
Thanks!
---
Because it's a fucking useless comment? Use brain.
---
Well i was just piping in because he doesn't pk he may not have realized it was a thing.  I got the impression since he said you can pot without interrupting attacks he may have thought it wouldn't impact the fight besides prayer management.
---
Not everything in OSRS needs to be about achieving the best gp/h or the most efficient xp/h. Godwars dungeon is a perfect example at how bosses can still be fun without dropping 30-100k worth of alchables each kill. I'm still wondering why Zulrah drops an uncut onyx, but we've moved way past that.
---
I didn't start playing RuneScape 13 years ago to make money, I played it to have fun. I don't want to fight the Guardians for money, I want to fight them for variance in killing over 100 gargoyles.
---
Whoosh again holy fuck. What is wrong with peoples brains today. There was ZERO talk about how useful the skill is. It’s useful. Everyone wants to argue when there is no argument here.
---
We were talking about everyday usefulness and how much it’s unlike other skills in its training and use. It’s like if you fished for fishing, but you had to throw the fish back. Or you fletched, but then the bow disappeared and you couldn’t sell it. Or if you trained up thieving, but after you stole from someone you gave the money back and stole it again. 
---
Once you build all your rooms and pool and teleports once, skill done. Weird huh? That’s what this whole thing was about. But Reddit, so people have to keep pushing up their glasses going “well, actually...” even when they’re so wrong it hurts. It was a simple observation. Holy god.

No I couldn't think of anything. Run energy was the first thing that came to mind but I didn't bring it up, cus like you said, you want something that helps close a gap and that doesnt really do it. It's a tough one.

Sorry I forgot to mention I’m doing this max afk, so I’m full hp and not rocking down to 1 hp, I’m just max health, drink a ton of absorbs and then pot combat every 5-10 mins

hes not remapping 1 key to another key though, hes remapping 1 key to a windows action, theres no 1 key that does that action
---
Yeah this may be true, and the Gmail already comes from gargs. The pvp aspect about the weapon would be the spec, which would only make sense to allow it to be a pking incentive.
---
Damn is that nearly 4 hours?? 
---
I’m pretty close to starting raids and really looking forward to it but holy hell I didn’t know its that long.
---
Are there any bosses that have very few/no quest requirements, are easily soloable with stats under 80, and make over 1m+ gp/hr?
---
I'm at 73 hp, 72 atk/str, 65 def, 76 range, 70 mage. 80 prayer but don't have the strong prayers. Any bosses that are considered easy?
---
Which would decrease the farming of gargs but it would create an incentive for the boss. The amount of alchs from gargs get decreased and the amount of alchs from boss get increased by around 70-75%
---
no one knows except testers who are behind an NDA
---
I'm curious what the method is but not curious enough to click a video link. Provide me text pls

Sick!

It looks like the poors are trying to be big wallet niggas again
---
So ask for the rewards to be put into the LMS shop? Locked behind competitive mode, which iirc costs money to enter and tribridding is one of the only things bots can't do in this game... Yet \*dramatic music\*

Adding an elo system would work well too. You'd just go up against people as good as you.

You mean 1-6 ropes

I think that's rickets...

Your friend is dreaming. There's no way it's that much difference, and you shouldn't be using DH at your level anyway.

Check the DPS calc to see what the actual difference would be:

They follow you for long enough, it disappeared because you weren’t paying attention- they will literally teleport to you.
---
You don’t know that ;) i could explain but basically playing in class isn’t bad at the place i go im on a gap year of sorts. Thank you for your concern though
---
In the world of runescape this probably pretty accurate the scientists in this game are constantly up to irresponsible hijinx
---
It’s not that long after like your third one.  Need to scout easier ones.

"Pk man bad" - r/2007scape
---
From what I've heard about Xbox and PS4, getting updates out for games is a nightmare. I know some PC titles have their updates pushed back because the company wants to keep all platforms on the same timeline. I'm not sure if Nintendo is the same way but I wouldn't be surprised if they were. That alone is reason enough to never touch consoles with osrs in my opinion. Still a cool idea though, I must admit.
---
I wonder if it only monitors mouse input when the cursor is within the game window. Your theory still makes a lot of sense. I see where you're comin from. I'm picking up what you're putting down.
---
I agree
---
&gt;hes not remapping 1 key to another key though, hes remapping 1 key to a windows action, theres no 1 key that does that action
---
That part of his script actually does 0 actions. It doesn't interact with the game at all.
---
Your logic implies that this script would be against the rules:
---
I have the game open and press a hotkey that does 'Press Win+R, type "notepad," press Enter'
---
Thank you! Unfortunately I already sent this, but I will keep your feedback in mind for the next contests.
---
It's basically newscape island. 
---
What is newscape? Imagine if all the fruits from wow and fortnite got together and rubbed minecraft on their genitals while watching pew pew dye. That's newscape.
---
It took me nearly 4 hours, but I just looked up how the raid was during the raid, i didnt prepare beforehand other than some gear. Also I can't even kill jad, so 2 of these hours went on olm x)
---
True. Maybe jagex would have a way to do so but I don’t know. And ya it’s tough.
---
I upvoted you btw because I totally agree that this isn’t proper gear for inexperienced/low defense jad attempts. 
---
At the same time some people do it in void elite so... idk haha.
---
Hey, I just unlocked the cave (72 Hunter) whats the best spot to set up my traps? I've heard the far end from the entrance is the best spot, but it seems kinda finnicky.

check sharkbew forums, there might be. over the weekend Saturday is usually f2p pking only, sunday is p2p.
---
Nope.
---
I found my people!
---
Warframe is definitely P2W, timegating is a scummy mechanic
---
:(
---
Ok :)
---
Im in a similar position. Add me in game man! Steeno94
---
Eh I never seen a difference on where.
---
&gt; the old school players would hate it but eventually get used to it and the game would be 10x the size it is now.
---
OSRS is too far from mainstream to ever get that big. If they added MTX, Jagex would shut down within a few years.
---
I went a bit over 300 to get the head when I did desert elite.
---
I'm glad that they added the 256 guaranteed drop though. Grinding all that KQ was starting to get demotivating. It wouldn't be so bad if the KQ shortcut was granted from the hard diary rather than the elite. My only complaint is that I could have used the head I eventually got for a slayer helm instead of mounting it in my POH.
---
Still obby, it's better than max str, even rapier/infernal/ferocious gloves.
---
Ruby bolts (e) can knock massive chunks of HP off of a boss, saving a significant amount of time. Additionally, the blowpipe is an extremely powerful weapon, out damaging all but the strongest and most expensive weapons.
---
Also ma1 cape, ammy of defence instead of glory if you have mm2 done
---
PC cost me roughly $1200 and I only play League and OSRS on it.

---
While we are reworking the GGs, they need to just go ahead and get rid of the purple and orange light phases. They add no difficulty and therefore pointlessly inflate the time it takes to kill the bosses.
---
I was hesitant to get torso at first too, but after a few videos and a couple games I really enjoyed barb assault. I now play it every now and then just for fun/high level gambles.
---
And having a torso saves you from buying a bcp haha.
---
Barrows will do that if you have the hard diary done
---
Zulrah used to be up to 4m/hr, not sure what prices are like rn tho. Requires much more skill and gear, but only has 2 proper quests as reqs (underground pass and a bit of regicide, also starting fairy tale 2 if you want the fairy ring)
---
I think this is exactly what will happen.
---
He should get a 4k 40inch screen then he wouldn’t need to alt tab

Yeah, my question is how would that *ever* be preferable

I think this is a konduit thing but im probably totally wrong
---
the f2p model is too strong honestly for it to have failed on runescape.
---
making everything f2p increases the potential audience to its maximum.
---
adding micro transactions brings in more money than subscriptions which is why jagex wants it.
---
if jagex had not argued that they would never bring mtx to the game they could have easily used the f2p model that literally every other massive game is using.
---
All my combat skills are in the 40-50s.
---
My slayer is level 1.

Should I start training it now or wait a bit till I have higher combat skills so I can fly through the early levels?
---
Also what's the best guide on how to even start slayer?
---
Wiki has a gp/XP  and XP/hour table with the answers you're looking for. I settled on super energy pots as a method from 60-70 that offered a good combination of lower gp and decent xp

Is your account being recovered everytime by whoever hacks it? If so it could be someone from that discord, as they know your ign while also knowing you pretty well I assume. There's a chance that could have gotten your recovery question answers from you over time without you ever knowing.
---
You said this is the "3rd time" it happened so clearly soemone somewhere has your info because of what you did online or sharing acc or whatever
---
Pure clanning most fun I had on rs
---
Damn a lot of dedication is needed. But its also one more reason to give you motivation to achieve those stats. Good luck to you pal. :)
---
Rodger Dodger Bruh 👉🦀👈
---
TBH 95% of tasks you aren't bursting, blowpipe is by far the fastest.
---
I want to know how this changes things at all profit wise? gmaul is worth nothing, how does it being nerfed effect profit? Sure you cant ko people as easily, but that goes both ways since pking in lower brackets is usually gmaul v gmaul. Bh profit comes mostly from emblems in under 70 cb brackets anyway, dds instead of a gmaul drop doesnt change much at all.
---
I always buy a rope, use it for a quest, and then drop it only to have to buy another rope for another quest later
---
What I do to focus on the jad prayers is ALWAYS pray mage, and then when jad stomps seitch to range until you see his range attack hit a 0 and then switch back to magic. Makes it much easier if you’re just watching for the obvious range attacks than watching for both. Also means when he’s not stomping you can worry about your supplies and the healers. I killed jad on my 2nd try, first death was because I stupidly forgot to watch my prayer level and it ran out
---
Use we do raids discord. Lots of people In there teach new raiders just for fun
---
well, now that ive checked my emails and sorted looking only for jagex emails, yes
---
it is being recovered everytime.
---
fuck man, ive never thought things i talk like friends to these guys would be used against me like that
---
Drubk asf goy rejected 2/3 shots i took
---
Blowpipe is what the whip used to be, cheap, versatile, and bis for over half the game. I love my little dart shooter TBH.
---
And merching
---
I literally have no idea, they just keep on saying it is shut down
---
Best thing to do is wait until about 85 combat. The tasks you get a assigned at lower levels sucks and it’s very slow
---
Yeah no. If they did do anything with the "quality" I'd rather then do something along the lines of what Runelite's GPU plug in does which is increase the render distance (optional) and anti- aliasing. No massive overhaul of the graphics etc.
---
Your RNG is dummy thicc, boi.
---
The pathing was what made made. It sucks in this game.
---
GZ on 2 WC bro
---
Lol sooooo dead bro.
---
This,
---
screen is bigger than my phone, less cramped and shit.
---
You should also look into doing Barb assault for a fighters torso. It's a pretty fun minigame and only takes 3-5 hours to get a torso, which will be your bis until you get max melee gear essentially.
---
Because higher level brackets like 90+ are super dead already so there wasn’t much profit to be had these before. And yes good players who used g maul will make way less at low levels because you just can’t get as many kills per hour without it.
---
And both these games make fucking way more money.
---
i bet you don't even djent
---
It’s true lol. The kids bank their max sets and return in double hide rags
---
True only thing worse than KQ is Sire
---
I wouldnt click on any links of theirs in prevention of receiving a nice keylogger my man.
---
Additionally, when your account is accessed by a radically different ip adress (e.g. youre American and the ip logged in is Indian) the account may be booted off and locked. If this hacker has no access to your e-mail at this account that means your account would just have been saved as unlocking it is a simple verification via email.
---
Now if you visit his site you give him your IP.
---
Give them as little info as possible to minimise the chance.
---
Ah yeah sorry, I've never been to the dungeon but I thought that might be the case after I commented.
---
&gt;	and when I mention why is didn’t hate yours you get this upset?
---
I didn’t know saying “I don’t care” counts as “being upset”. I mainly hate it due to little 9 year old Yavanna looking at it as a walking simulator. Yeah, I know this time it’ll probably be quicker (even though I’ll still have to take the underground pass), but the absolute loathing I have seared into my soul of that quest for whatever reason is pretty intense. 
---
Also, it’s a sequel to Waterfall, which is also one of my least favourite quests after someone told little 8 year old yavanna “Hey that’ll give you some sick XP” on an Internet forum. Thanks for that, I totally didn’t die multiple times. 
---
Basically, the reason I hate that quest is because my experience playing it the first time was so unpleasant and tedious that I vowed never to do it again. 
---

If your stats are high enough you can just "flinch" it without using prayer at all. Here's a guide on that if you have like 80 something HP and no firecape still somehow [https://youtu.be/Zgoc8pfumf8?t=886](https://youtu.be/Zgoc8pfumf8?t=886)
---
Once your past 55 it gets allot better then past 72 you start making bank.
---
I dont think hes implying that at all
---
Hes just saying that the mtx available in fortnite and league of legends arent harmful to *their* games, which Id agree with
---
Ah man I'm so sorry to hear that:/ losing a pet is one of the hardest things in life, I hope you're doing good.

I mean, if I'm in need of a leg for Dr. Fenkenstrain's creature than ya. Though the pair in the back come with cloth around them which means cleaner transport...

At least get 83 so you can boost for max pool and jewelry box. Amazing qol
---
Best ways to get the chompy tasks done for western provinces diary?
---
Good catch - maybe report a bug?
---
Depends on your stats honestly, I was a range pure when I was really low level so I had an easy time using dhide and crossbows / magic shortbow if it was something really easy. Look for cake tasks like spiders, scorpions, skeletons etc. Try not to risk too much because it's obviously the wildy.
---
Down the line consider blocking fire Giants they're deeeep in the wildy (and they're a really common block for high level players also because they have high task chance and take years with no loot)
---
I mean bigger and badder and Slayer helm first maybe? Idk what meta is, follow your heart
---
Yea big pass myself, I love the graphics of OSRS
---
To be honest, for some reason I thought I read a f you in your first reply, not sure as to why that is but I genuinely thought it was there, even after reading it twice. Not sure if it’s because I just read a lot of Reddit this hour before bed but — it did drastically effect how I responded to your comment. With that being said, the first time around was quite horrible. With my knowledge of the game now being more extensive, I just find it to be a nice “break” in the tediousness of the elven quests. Regardless Everyone is entitled to the or like whichever part of rs they please. I just for some reason added more to your first response in my head than you actually wrote down.
---
The early tasks will suck but if you dont care about efficiency, it's always good to do slayer when training combat stats.
---
Didn’t trolls used to drop gmaul back in the day?
---
Decent setup. What I would change is glory &gt; Phoenix necklace and add seed pod as tele. Less risk, better survivability and easier tele. Take an extra necklace too.
---
Xp is definitely better compared to abyssal sire which takes almost as long and gives only 450 per kill. The general drop table for grotesques is not that bad, but the fact that ifyou want to be efficient you are pretty much forced to use dragon darts to skip the heal and it cuts into profits a lot. 
---
The boss also has a lot more mechanics than rest of the slayer bosses which makes the effort required much bigger than the rest of the slayer bosses and reward for that effort should be greater.
---
Still, I think that putting the attachment to bh store is better option, because balancing the price of the item is much easier and I think they are looking it to be and stay in that 4-5m ball park. Just giving a new 5m unique to grotesque guardians would not really fix the problems with that boss.
---
Tbow is actually less dps than blowpipe.
---
I understand, but I’d rather pay the 100 than risk that slippery slope. I’m terrified of where it could end. 
---
I love MTX on league, but seeing what extent it’s gone to on rs3 makes any form of mtx sound scary, I already know where they’d pool their ideas from
---
&gt;To be honest, for some reason I thought I read a f you in your first reply, not sure as to why that is but I genuinely thought it was there, even after reading it twice.

In your defense, I am a bitch. 
---

I hope I find it that way this time around, but I still feel such a sense of dread.

You fucked up somewhere, you just don't know where.
---
"I never got to use use vls in lms" and he never will xD good job /u/WesthamRs it shows how bad they were and how good you were!
---
I think they took the legends req off of the dragon spear like 10 years ago
---
This is true,  if you use it to send clicks or mouse moves or general input to the game
---
Or a whole new boss with an ice wrath cape same stats just blue then you can be cool by showing youve done both
---
You won't be making money at 60 either. 70+ is when it starts making profit. Earlier than that you're just losing money on resources and cannonballs.
---
You guys are braindead, he is actually making a joke 7 layers of irony deep

Have to literally beat some of these guys to death with accurate info before they get it.
---
I would literally go out and buy a switch RN. Like this would be a “partnership” I would be down for like buy a switch and it comes with osrs and 6 months of membership or some shit
---
A boss that's fun like Sarachnis maybe a bjt stronger but with nice mechanics like it has, and have it drop an item that lets us do the recolor, super rare and could even be untradeable.
---
Do yourself  a favor and run! Run as far away from Osrs as you can. All that time and investment you put in are gone and you have nothing to show for. Find something new! Jagez doesn’t care and neither should you!
---
It's still a medium-risk item that sometimes has to be taken into multi. Atleast it will give a sense of anxiety to the Dinh user when a solo pker logs out without attacking them - they could be scouting for a clan.
---
Having that sense of risk is what the wilderness is all about. Today, you just put on your shield and go about your day.. you know you're not gonna die and even if you do, you risk nothing.
---
Grats dude

One of the Gowers said in the runescape documentary that free trade removal was the worst decision they ever made to the game. It's also why the grand exchange is garbage, it was invented to solve a problem that no longer exists

It's SINGLES, these areas aren't made for teams. If I can't expect to fight back in SINGLES, then fuck it I'll just camp a bulwark everywhere. If having a team is a fair abvantage in singles then so is having a bulwark. Honestly people cry about bulwark, but I'd just camp range pray after tb with ely/sotd/suffering/serp/hides. In that setup you truly have 0 chance of killing someone in singles.
---
People use forums still?

---
...? His entire argument wasn’t based off of that shortcut at all, it was just another piece of supporting evidence. And the poll was for after Underground Pass.
---
The only methods to get into Tirannwn are:
---
Elf camp teleport, requires Regicide
---
Port Tyras, requires regicide
---
Teleport crystal, requires starting mep1
---
Zul-andra teleport, requires regicide
---
BJS fairy ring, requires regicide
---
Arandar, requires regicide
---
And finally, the underground pass. Unless you’ve got some secret teleport into Tirannwn that you’re keeping secret, the only way in before completing Regicide is via the underground pass.
---
Punishing everyone for the mistakes of random teammates will make Pest Control a pretty toxic place. I agree it's a boring minigame, but trying to get 25 random people to be on the same page will be a nightmare, and people will just end up getting angry at each other. 
---
&gt;This means that good teams who work together will get a lot of points while bots who do nothing but to stand around and constantly die will be awarded little to no points.
---
1 player in 25 really has minimal impact on the outcome of a game. There's no pre-determined roles in PC, and the game never gives you any way to coordinate, often you're too far apart to even interact with another group on your team. If everyone on your team thinks it's someone elses job to do something such that that job goes neglected, you lose, and that job often is too big for one or even two people to adequately fill. 
---
I don't think you can force teamwork amongst a large group of random people and have it end well, or reward people individually for their performance in said large, random group.
---
What client is that?
---
This isn't going to make people risk anything lol. It might mean less players in the wilderness. If you aren't risking anything with a dinhs you're definitely going to start risking anything after this
---
Lmao wtf 
---
I dont like fortnite but the majority of the playerbase is f2p, and most people who do spend money just get the battle pass which is $10 and lasts multiple months. And after you are done with the battle pass, it gives $10 worth of v-bucks and you can either spend that on cosmetics or the next battle pass.  
---
You're in a bubble, nobody should be forced to pay over $100 a year to play a game.
---
Stop is not a real safe word.
---
Why the rush? 
---
It's not even that important. Having a complex password only protects against bruteforcing, which Jagex already prevents by limiting the login attempts.
---
Everyone gets hijacked because their (previous) password is visible in plaintext. At that point the complexity of a password doesn't really matter anymore.
---
True, but the majority of the time a method for best xp/hr is restrictive in its own right, like mining iron or 3t fishing, but i get where you're coming from with doing a task you like or wasting points skipping tasks
---
yeah thats what I thought its the same exp as the abyss if you had 99 agility and mining right?
---
go play fortnite then lol
---
I would call it annoying for new players, not scummy. 
---
If you treat warframes platinum currency same as coins in Runescape you can actually see that both games are really similar in their monetization models.
---
You can buy bonds and sell them for coins and you can buy platinum and use it to buy almost anything that you want. 
---
But actually maxing your account or reaching true endgame using this way is extremely expensive, inefficient and takes away the entire point of the game because you are essentially paying to skip "grind" but grinding in both of these games is the actual content. 
---
Also warframes are more like heroes in league or hero shooters, just because you have them doesn't mean you can properly use them. It takes time to learn the mechanics, interactions and properly modding them with end game mods is the entire point of the game. And if you would try to skip everything by spending cash you would waste thousands of dollars to buy and rank up all the mods. It would be as "efficient" as buying twisted bow by selling bonds and thinking that you can now beat the game without having quests, diaries and your skills leveled up.
---
It’s another layer. More security is good security.
---
Not that you would know, but there were 100% other companies running subscription based services at the time.  So how were they able to fight these things off and be fine but yet Jagex wasnt?  Was it because how big RS was?  Did Jagex not do enough to properly address it?  I'm pretty clueless on the subject, but it seems like they needed to fix a problem and instead just fucked the game instead of directly addressing it.
---
Other poster is incorrect. Multi logging is very explicitly allowed in the rules. 
---
"You are free to create as many accounts as you like and you are welcome to trade between your accounts just as you would with any other legitimate player."
---
From https://www.runescape.com/game-guide/rules
---
It basically makes player to player trade obsolete. No one has any reason to go anywhere but the GE to trade. There's no bargaining, up-selling, trading in random banks, player made trading zones, etc. Things that people kind of miss from the original game. One of the biggest things OSRS lacks is player to player interaction, and the GE is a big part of that.
---
&gt;Its one of the most important things in osrs now.
---
Well, it's the easiest way to trade. This doesn't mean it's good for the game. If they made a new weapon that costs 50k and had twice the DPS of the whip, it would be "one of the most important things in OSRS", because everyone would be using it. That wouldn't make it a good item, though.
---
Deep wildy pking is literally the only reason I still play this game. Every other aspect of the game is repetitive and boring as hell and that includes high lvl pvm. If you're bored wit skilling/pvming try out some pking.
---
I'm super ADHD and I have trouble focusing on one thing. Certain grinds are just rhytmic and helps me flow through daily tasks/work. If I'm playing RuneScape I'm basically not ADHD which may sound weird but idk. I like it.
---
Firstly the rs doco explains some of it pretty well. And i think rs was unique at the time. No other game had the same economy and trade like rs at the time. If i can cba later after work ill do some digging and ping you some info. Its actually a really intresting thing. 
---
Eoc on the otherhand. Smh
---
Started demonics today and got my zenyte at 6 kc
---
You arent wrong I have a near 4b bank and nearly maxed except for the more tedious skills.  I quit 6-8 months ago and all i think about is how I wasted my time playing this game, i gained almost nothing substantial except a few friends who I keep in touch with. Even the money I could get from RWT doesnt make me feel like rs was worth it.  I still occasionally log in to see whats updated or changed but I can't bring myself to grind it out like I used to.
---
Or try this, practice proper account security and never get hacked and have no need for a pin anyways.
---
Also that exp goes to 27k/hr at 75 runecrafting right?
---
It's as predatory as paying 300$ for a regular shirt which you can buy for 20$ but people still buy overpriced shit all the time. 
---
Fortnite is so fair, that you can buy your battlepass once and you get free skins and challenges for the entire season and you get about 1500 vbucks in return where as battlepass only costs 950. 
---
People who feel the need to buy every single skin are the ones that have problems with league or fortnite pumping out skins every day.
---
a player owned house?
---
Ipad
---
Free accounts get a spin ticket, so it's like he gets 2500 free keys per day.

you're delusional

&gt;If you treat warframes platinum currency same as coins in Runescape you can actually see that both games are really similar in their monetization models.
---
I don't agree for various reasons and I think it's hard to compare them since OSRS is a subscription based game.   
---
Bonds can be used to get the currency but they aren't the currency, so buying platinum injects more money into the economy.  
---
Weapon/Warframe slots are really useful and you can't get more without usage of platinum.  
---
You can buy XP and droprate boosts with platinum.  
---
Players who don't buy platinum are timegated by the crafting system.

In OSRS, bonds were there to combat botters to lower their impact on the game, such that people who don't interact with bonds in any way would still feel the impact of bonds through less bots, less inflation, and higher resource costs since botters aren't injecting as much into the game. What does platinum add for players who don't interact with platinum?

Are you seizing

6000+ combined on all of my accounts. have gotten 5 penance pets ;)

I don’t want people peering in and jerking off to my fight cave attempt. What kind of sick voyueristic fantasy is this, op?
---
8 minutes of excrutiating text to speech content. 
---
If THIS is the bar for acceptable osrs content, why the fuck am I not making money off you idiots yet? lmfao
---
If I could use gp to buy Mage Arena 2 cape for example, I would. You could just buy the G maul upgrade and not have to do pvm at all.

The jar of stone, core, and pet should be enough of incentive to go to that boss.

Are/were you wasted beyond recognition when you posted or is this just your personality?

Lol my bank account was frozen after attempting to subscribe for membership. XD. I have my bank account linked to PayPal via a debit card and after 2 issues PayPal blacklisted my checking account. Got that reversed after a few hours then contacted my bank, ended up confirming that I wanted to send Jagex money because I play their game, then got it linked back up and ead able to pay. No other game I ever had issues but sending Jagex froze shit up.
---
Dat one is good
---
Traditionally yes, but hasn't there been a huge push to separate the two recently, especially on this sub? I feel like this decision is in line with that design principle.
---
Factual but lacking relevance
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
what if they add more?
---
it'll take quite a few clues until you built all the stashes, since there's 104 total
---
I still ned to play mournings end p1/p2 and 7m kinda hooked to do it now :b
---
Here's me thinking its 3 skeletons
---
Ya well if the blessed kid'd put deir hahckey stuff in the garage I might get some cooking done around here
---
The system is definitely fair. You see what you get and the battle pass returning V bucks is a great step towards retaining f2p players. As far as MTX goes, it's pretty straightforward.
---
I still think the prices themselves are somewhat predatory in nature. 15-20$ each? That is insane. I mean I look at those skins and think $5 is asking a lot. 
---
The level of detail for the skins means they can just pump these things out. Pay an artist for a couple days of work, sell it to 100,000 kids at $20 a pop.
---
*Carpal tunnel specialists love it! - You won't believe what it is!*
---
That's why I play osrs, if I wana concentrate I'll play something more engaging. Osrs is the 2nd activity. Not the TV show or w.e else your doing. That's the main thing your doing.
---
Same, I started exercising 2 years 5 months ago and I feel anxiety if I don't exercise after a while (over 2 days). I don't wanna stay put anymore, especially how I have changed during that time.
---
I simply find exercising more valuable than spending dozens of hours a week to videogames which in the end means nothing. Like my RS3 account: 13.000 hours put into it and now the account is literally worth nothing.
---
From my testing Rune Darts skip the heal like 75% of the time
---
I've had the displeasure of experiencing not having the ge in runescape twice now.
---
Having to spend 30 minutes to buy shit when it could take 15 seconds is dumb as hell. Don't forget about the scamming and the bots that spam saying they are selling something for a much lower price than it's actually going for and they never trade anyone, they just try to artificially lower the price. Don't forget about 100 people standing on one tile and the chat screen going by insanely fast so it's impossible to trade a specific person.
---
What even is your point? All you say is that it killed player trading, so? You can trade on the ge. What does it matter that it's done in a slow as trade window compared to the instant ge?
---
"One of the biggest things OSRS lacks is player to player interaction, and the GE is a big part of that."
---
The ge is where like 90% of player interaction occurs.
---
" If they made a new weapon that costs 50k and had twice the DPS of a whip, it would be "one of the most important things in OSRS", because everyone would be using it. That wouldn't make it a good item, though."
---
That is a dreadful strawman, even by reddit standards.
---
Why
---
Alching + Agility still is click intensive, especially if you alch while you run - if you alch just after the obstacle, you lose 1 tick per obstacle.
---
Ps: this method would be way more efficient in Rellekka Agility Course. Just set the cannon middle of the market and refill it on your each drive-by when you run past it.
---
Are you supposed to level everything using bots? For example, when mining coal in the barbarian village, I see all these level 3 acclunts snatching the coal from me and then there are these people who are fishing or cutting wood for hours.
---
Because they have 100 million monthly players, compared to OSRS with 100 times smaller audience
---
Why not have a blowpipe with you and take out the darts? (In some cases that's even the scam the pull on you)
---
Are you still stuck in the last decade?
---
Sometimes free isn't good.
---
*Then* you unlock the route around the underground pass but you need high agility levels to take the shortcuts that speed it up and it feels sort of pointless to use anyway (pre necklace of passage) so by then you probably have amassed a good amount of crystal seeds to teleport to Lletya and/or Elf Camp teleport scrolls (obv released only in OSRS) and end up never using the underground pass bypass anyway.
---
Sadly its only about making gold now :/ i missing doing castle wars back in 2006 and seeing my friend in full arma/karils and a gs
---
I wouldn't mind a global buff to low level slayer profit tbh. I did slayer from the very start of my acc in 2013 and the unique drops were decent money for my levels and usually paid for all my gear upgrades, food and potions. Now that the uniques aren't worth that much anymore I see no problem with adding a few more alchables to lower level monsters. Some rune daggers here, an addy full helm there, that kinda stuff.
---
The more you raid, the faster and more efficient you become. ;)
---
Keep it up, and you'll start doing them within an hour or two! ;D
---
Congrats man
---
Brave of you to assume I'm using more than one account, or even subscribed at all
---
I would say wait until you have 60 att, str,def,mage and range. That should be good enough to do every task.

I mean. If they dont have the combat for it and are grinding out the support skills before they start is a pretty good reason.

I can't see this happening unless it's very easy to port it to Switch. At the end of the day, the Switch has a shelf life - how many people still use a Sony PSP or it's successors?
---
Only so many people own one and how many people are really going to go out and buy one just for OSRS?  Whereas most people have a phone or tablet for playing mobile and they can continue to play on their next phone.
---
Seems like a waste of developer resources to benefit a small percentage of the player base.
---
So we’re not going to use this elven expansion to update the crystal bow? Not that we really NEED another range weapon. But if there was ever a time to balance the crystal bow this would be it.  I mean come on the crystal bow is expensive to use and it’s just flat out bad in most cases. Please Jamflocks
---
I can't see it

Or just speed up the transitions to and from those phases.

Exactly

Have pray range on and hover over pray mage.

I like this idea, and I would personally prefer to get an item as a PvM drop as opposed to a PvP reward because of how I spend my time playing.
---
However, the granite maul is a pvp-focused weapon and this update is meant to impact pvp gameplay. Many players interested in using the granite maul will have weird builds that make PvM fights like GG’s unappealing. For this reason, it makes more sense to me for the granite maul grip to come from pvp than to come from pvm.
---
I got 1kc for hard diary and then went to get the head for the elite on friday - got the head on 2kc. So happy :D I will enjoy the shortcut for my third kill

But why would you pay for a full year of membership using one bond at a time for 14 days when you can do either the special offers or actual yearly or even monthly subscriptions...

It’s been flagging legitimate players for years mate. My first main was falsely banned for selling cooked and burnt lobsters to the karamjan general store next to the banana plantation. Nevermind that that was the best f2p fishing exp I could find that at least gave me something in return. Ban was permanent and unappealable because apparently nobody ever uses that store except for bots. Completely infallible logic, have never touched that place since
---
Yeah with scythe

Imagine paying for a free service 😂

This post just reads “I got a tanzanite mutagen and I demand cosmetic changes to the most prestigious pvm reward, cos fashionscape. K thx”

I think if there’s gonna be a new cape colour / cape it should come from its own challenge and reward. There’s plenty of scope for a frost boss in the future that rewards a blue cape.

Because it sounds better than "last non binary individual life being standing"

SO, it turned out that I had to simply just wait for a digsite worker to be next to the pit. It allowed me to dig then :P

Trained at Crandor moss giants with a friend and banked in Draynor LOL! Even when I had membership I didn't know about the 'push' wall underneath Crandor going into Karamja dungeon and full on WTF'd when I found it (thought it was a glitch). The good ol' days...

Agree, go to mining guild and stand by 2 iron rocks and by the time you’ve mined both rocks and dropped the ore, the ore has respawned.

I like it, sometimes I like to go onto f2p with my members account and play around with the f2p PVP mechanics. I do this to help myself pk better without losing tons of money.

i didnt said they hacked me 100% through my recovery questions, i just said they are probably the ones who did it cause they knew my email and personal stuff, and my ign (which happens to be my login since my account is legacy from 2006/07)

How did you train hp?!?

You don’t need anything but coins to buy the gear/runes/food.

What are your other stats?

I get my membership through twitch prime (Because with amazon prime, You get twitch prime). So I redeem my month of membership from twitch (I have connected my osrs account to twitch). So technically, I only pay for amazon prime and I never pay for a osrs membership.

so i tried to do what you suggested ,for some reason today the mail got recognized but ( an email with a code has been sent to my email((the one i cant login to)) please confirm it ), no idea mate thanks though

I remember when I was like 8 years old and I did DS on my account, the fight with Elvarg was so stressful to me that I started crying and my brother had to finish her for me. My brother made fun of me for weeks after that.

---
Well you said they recovered you account. Having your recovery questions makes for a very strong appeal. And they talked to you specifically asking for answers to those recovery questions. So, yeah.  It was most likely them.

What are you talking about? The biggest red spider's eggs resource in the game got removed, this is purely a normie update.

So you mean the T1 which has popped back up in price less then 5% after dropping to 30% its previous price is only going up from blog speculation? That’s hilariously stupid. Or the T10 which was literally *just* made tradeable and has an extremely volatile back and forth price trend? Which is *also* at a low point right now and not even at a price peak.
---
How exactly is the alch value of a T1 10k when the literal high alch price of the emblem is 30k and it trades to the store for more value than that in alchables?
---
OP got these rates from 69-74 range.

Definitly died on my first try because i popped the anti fire potion, the protect magic prayer, but forgot to equip the shield (mage problems) and got OHKO'd by the first flame attack. Real stressful 15 minutes of buying more planks and nails trying to get back to my gear

It's just like player stats. It's as if you're fighting someone who has 90 defence and 205 magic and their armor gives them 80 melee and 85 range defence. 
---
Another thing is magic defense is different where it takes your magic level into account. So even though it has 0 magic defense it's 205 magic level basically makes it immune to magic.
---
How do you know it isn't just someone who made a page? If there is a way to know for sure that it's the people who run it I'll prob spare a few dollars

You’re about 2 months too late from being a Osrs millionaire when the parrot was at 1.3m

Damn $425 a month? That’s nearly competitive with the Jagex dev salary
---
Just did this quest yesterday on my new p2p account. Haven’t played OSRS in years but I’m havin so much damn fun. Exploring the world.
---
You're literally the only person I've ever heard say that.
---
Just did this quest last night. Still spooked me 13 yrs since the first time I did it
---
I remember a long time back when you got a rune scim drop from a fire giant and for me it was considered 'Bank Loot'. Was like 30K at the time. Get a couple of those in a trip and a rune med or two and you're basically rich.
---
OSBuddy is NOT BANNED by Jagex, I'm not sure where you even got that from. They specifically stated use all 3rd party clients at your own risk. Menu-entry swapper for things like banks is still on RuneLite so maybe do a little more digging before spreading misinformation.
---
DS2 is the only quest I’ve actually enjoyed in runescape
---
Why is this? Could you give me some examples please?
---
i ugly laughed at this while in public, thanks
---
I don’t think people overrate how much you make from normal gargoyles. One task of 200, which is really only an hour and a half or so, nets about 1mil value of drops between ore and alches. Along with being super AFK, not using many supplies, and superiors. For a mid level slayer monster that is easy to kill, there’s nothing overrated about it
---
Support but only if we can craft wards to ward off partnerships.
---
This is actually the right answer. Since price update in 2018 the same amount is now worth less days.
---
Mate if you don’t enjoy winter frog why are you there?
---
there's literally no way that each possible combination is currently hard-coded. Jagex is known for their spaghetti code, but that would be some next level shit.
---
All they would need to do is have the game count how many pieces of graceful you have on, and if that number &gt;= 6 then the set bonus applies. May or may not be an easy job depending on what they have now, but combinations really shouldn't be a factor
---
Oh, thank you very much for the information :)
---
Gonna try it as soon as i can \^\^
---
It's on the Runelite homepage
---
I’ll just let the comments stack up on my way to work and read them when I get there. This’ll be fun
---
Would the effect of the Thammaron’s sceptre stack with the effects from the Thammaron’s robe set?
---
Crandor? I've been calling her Crandall.
---
Ill see myself out.
---
Honestly, I like the idea of a new skill, and warding seems like a good idea, 
---
but it just seems so extra...
---
its only slightly pay 2 win because the champs arent free.
---
dota 2 is truly not p2w.
---
Glad to see BattleWards removed; it was entirely unfitting for the skill and game as a whole.
---
Aah makes sense, I thought this was a donation page or something
---
Things that exist?
---
Well when the game locks certain endgame rewards behind 90+ slayer and provides a 15% dps boost for being on task, it's tough not to
---
I guess im just new here. But whats this? Is this fan art or an actual thing?
---
I really love the idea of a new skill just so I can feel what’s its like to stumble through the game again like I did back all that time ago. I hope we the community and the dev team can work together to make this content work for the game.
---
Maybe ~18m
---
I definitely experience this especially during times of high internet traffic or i'm streaming netflix... sometimes it starts out as a slight lagg then snowballs into 200-600ms delay between inputs and action... very annoying
---
The underlying issue with warding is still there for me.
---
The skill simply doesn't have a clear cut and straightforward focus and identity. 
---
There is close to nothing here that doesn't fit into any other skill. 
---
Why isn't making the robes in crafting? Making dhide and splitbark are already in crafting, etc etc
---
I didn't know this! I thought you had to take the def exp in order to finish as once it has finished you couldn't go back without taking it?
---
Or is that the point, finish it and don't go back - do MM2 caves instead?
---
For real. I'm doing it with 96 range with rigour and blowpipe, and I **still** fail to out-DPS orb phase like half the time. This boss is aids.
---
I kinda do agree. It is too op in solving puzzles and skipping game mechanics.
---
Just do it at maniacal monkeys, it's less tedious to get them stacked
---
"Runecrafting XP will be minimal and no more than 5k an hour"
---
Because it is more pointless grind. This is what makes me not want Warding, it's just another skill that leaves no room for actual skill to be involved, even the minigame seems to be designed like Slayer and leaves no room for someone to get better at it.
---
It's always based around time investment rather than the player's own ability dictating the amount of XP/HR and GP/HR.
---
**Give me content that makes me want to be engaged with the game** rather than making me look away from it because everything is just a long and dull grind.
---
As I recall, they did end up getting rid of TAPP
---
Why nmz with your stats? And why do you have a slayer helm?
---
I don't get why they acknowledge they messed up with the initial idea and implementation of Sailing, but now choose a new skill instead of reworking sailing.
---
Maybe I really am the only one (of 68% per the last poll) but Sailing really is an iconic 'skill' to RuneScape. We have seen some pretty amazing suggestions for the skill as well from various members of the community (such as GentleTractor, among others, sorry that name is just the largest and easiest to remember). I still think it deserves a chance to be designed by both the community and the Dev team together.
---
The game doesn't need another skill. Doesn't feel like anything is missing
---
hey bro what combat stats and raid relevant skilling stats do you have? i just hit 115 combat i probably should try a raid too!
---
I can't bare to try deep pking again. Let me rephrase that, I did try it but I got in; spent 500k in gear to go to a Solo zone and got clanned and pjed. Had a team of 5 tag me and pj me. Thought it was a one time thing, repeated this 3 times till I said it wasn't worth it.
---
Pkers voting no to Spellbook icon resizing didn't help either.
---
Not going there untill they fix those 2 things.
---
Got tired of bounty hunter pking, I've made a shit ton of account builds and have pked a ton! I just wanted to try deep wilderness pking but it seems it's too toxic for me.
---
I did regi and underground with bare minimum stats and only failed one time total 
---
Same with mm2
---
Would it tho? The Karulum things seem to basically be TzHaar, and I don't imagine they're gonna add Green and Purple versions.
---
So exp though mate, it's around 35-50k exp an hour cannoning! I wanna be reaching 190-260k exp rates! Thanks though :)
---
To be fair, most of them do it as a hobby. They do it because they love the game. But I agree, donations are always a good idea to help these guys out for giving us an amazing client.
---
The hydra thing yeah, but otherwise it's correct?
---
No they would match. Its the entire point of the new wildy robes
---
Out of genuine curiosity, what things seemed a little OP?
---
Start MM1 and you'll have access to the best training spot for range (chinning). Just train your range to 99 before finishing the quest. Also, did you know you can get 45 prayer without gaining a combat level?
---
I picked so much flax to supplement my income. That and rune essence
---
Makes me think about the GoT actors that were mad people didn't like the last season because "They put a lot of hard work into it".
---
Good luck reaching a 5 task streak with wildy slayer at a low lvl. You're lucky if you get any points at all.
---
What else new does it add? An item sink that won't work like invention as there will just be alch value items that get used as sinks for the resources.
---
Armour that can be added in any other way just like all armour updates.
---
Moving existing content into a skill. Hell even now backing away from taking it out of the problem area. This could move into runecrafting and magic just like you know.. infusing.. imbuing.. enchanting...
---
There's nothing new here. There's a convoluted gathering method that's just an afk method, there's a poorly designed item sink that will barely touch the economy of valued items due to not having the structural thought of invention resources, and there's armour crafting that could fit anywhere in existing skills.
---
What new stuff is this adding besides buffing existing content and using a skill as a reason for it?
---
Did you not even read the blog? Warding will provide an alternative method of imbuing ring? You'll still be able to imbue via NMZ.
---
"Add nontradeables"
---
I'm not saying stack them up, but again the boss is worse than the regular version.
---
Oh yeah I forgot you need a rope here just run back and grab one
---
Im maxed melee, 79 mage, 85 range. I think before doing it again I should approach 90/90 for those as I missed a lot. I'm 70 pray wich seems fine and 55 farm + 78 herb to be able to make brews + restore
---
Funny how you finally giving magic the buff it needed for years and trying to lock it behind voting yes to a new skill lmao
---
Kieren needs some sleep 👀
---
If jagex weren't trying to shoehorn a new skill into the game would anyone have ever suggested a mage Robe crafting skill? 
---
Pkers get next to nothing from the average kill anyway, now add in a couple thousand bots making the robes tank in prices and you're left with scraps. 
---
If there was some kind of problem with the way magic items came into the game, and warding was the solution it would make sense for it to go into the game, but currently I don't see a need for it. 
---
In conclusion, it feel more like 'let's add something big to the game so we can advertise it on every platform possible'  rather than 'here's the solution to a major problem'
---
There are already a lot, at this point I just want to able to match, calm down man.
---
Figured I can swing $1 a month.
---
I don’t like it conceptually, I would prefer to see expansion to RC/Magic/Crafting for the proposed content and a new skill around something else entirely.
---
I also think there’s plenty in the game at the moment that can be improved before adding a new skill becomes the thing to focus on.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
We can. This would definitely work for 1 def pures who have completed mm and can’t return to ape atoll
---
Vote No to warding.
---
Solution: never click on a bank or teleport in the few seconds before the 5 minute intervals since you’ve logged in :)
---
Random events only have a chance of spawning every 5 minutes after you’ve clicked the login button, if my first statement didn’t make sense
---
How do you browse the internet without an ad blocker in this day and age?
---
Absolutely barbaric.
---
I can appreciate the effort put in by the OS team, but I’ll be voting no. The idea that something that hasn’t passed a poll before is getting such an incredible amount of dev time is kinda odd. I’d much rather see the dev time put into fixing the game as is before tackling a whole skill that’s been voted no before on multiple occasions.
---
You mean the blog post that details splashing for resource gathering, or bank standing to dissolve items and create wards to make armours..?
---
That is the whole skill.. you know this right?
---
Actually looks much better than what I read on the April blog, really liking most of the new concepts.
---
🦀🦀$22🦀🦀
---
That's like saying polling EOC and MTX is stupid because it will be impossible to add it. Polling is almost never a bad thing. It just means a majority of the players wants the update, that's a good thing.
---
Chill bro he's got a family
---
I would love that. Id start wearing ring of wealth at every slayer task

It still beats "Windy pages"

Yeah, you play however you like man. There’s no shortage of people that will tell you to play how they want.
---
How about we fix content and not just add new content? Zeah was released 7th january 2016 and it's still not even close to being finished. How can anyone trust jagex to make a good skill is mindblowing.
---
I know, but I'm getting sick of them.
---
Pure assumption on your part. People can disagree with your opinion and not be immediately wrong or lazy for doing so.
---
I actually think this skill would be good for the game. Despite all the hate Jagex gets, they have handled this whole process very well and are communicating clearly while listening and sitting to what we say/want. 
---
I wish the community had an open mind like Jagex.
---
10 points to this chump for his super original and well thought out argument. /s
---
as a yes voter, there are some valid points about not voting to this, but deciding not to vote because Warding seems like a "grind" really baffles me, this game is made of GRINDS, why the hell are you playing OSRS?
---
and i've already seen people stating that they will vote no because they don't want to lose their comp cape, like really...
---
I think adding these things among RC/magic/crafting is way more appealing than adding a new skill when there is so much in the game in need of love.
---
New players don't cannon tasks.
---
You should read some self help books and try to improve your social skills. It might be intimidating at first, but once you start to understand people, the world becomes a pretty cool place for interpersonal communication.
---
This actually looks really good, i for one will be voting yes to this.
---
Imo the prayer armor to say the least
---
Almost literally nothing in the game makes any sense.  
---
Why do I only get the Runecraft cape when I hit 99 instead of 95 when I've learned to craft it all?
---
That seems like a lot of work.. will have to set up a timer of some sort.
---
Get Ublock Origin like the rest of us?
---
I'm only seeing this shit because you posted it here.
---
Nah the post says, I understand and see rainbow children running around and would like it if people could look good when wearing their best gear. I don't have any mutagens actually.
---
We can make magic armour right now in crafting. It's just the only new pieces that were added in low-medium tier. Back in 2006 magic armour was not craftable, but now it is but we think we need a new skill to justify it
---
So spend 50 bucks on a tablet if you dont want to play osrs on a phone lol.
---
What are you talking about? I'm saying that its almost impossible to add a skill in OSRS with the polling system, which is why I think it its stupid to poll it.
---
I don’t want to get hacked by entering my password through third party software
---
Please make bloodbark 50 def not 55. 55 is just an awkward number, theres other things in the game that are 50. Otherwise blog looks pretty good.
---
I'm not implying cosmetics are good for osrs. Cosmetics mtx are an amazing monetization model for games like Fortnite and LoL though, and that's really the only point of the comment, not that it applies to osrs.
---
Construction isnt really much different than most other skills. Make the same potion 10K times, Cast the same spell 10K times, Kill the same monster 10K times, Mine the same 3 rocks 10K times, etc etc
---
Armours that will either be overpowered or not good enough to see any use outside of whatever dumb little niche they have.  
---
We could do with some item sinks but not at the cost of Crafting 1.2.
---
Do you know which one is correct? Or can you at least tell me how to spot a fake?
---
Same thing was said for artisan and sailing. Sailing got a better reception than artisan and I expect this to see an equally better reception.
---
Even if it doesn't pass, they should take that as maybe their concept isn't great and that people are after a skill that excites them. Not just a reshuffling of content in a "tidy and makes sense" way
---
InTeGrItY cHaNgE
---
I appreciate all the efforts the Jmods are putting into these blogs. I'll be blindly voting no on all my accounts without reading any of them.
---
Wait, so they got rid of battlewards, but they did get rid of that awful summoning mechanic too? I didn’t see anything about removing it in this post, but I also didn’t see anything about it at all.
---
Big no from me dawg
---
Im an adult living the bottom pane.
---
I play OSRS to get away from the stresses of life. 
---
Been a blast so far, sure I play efficiency scape a lot, but I try to always to have fun with it. As soon as this game is a chore for me I’m taking a break.
---
You must have missed the survey sent to every player. But yep your opinion &gt; actual data from playerbase.
---
&gt; I will vote no because I want other content instead
---
That’s.. a perfectly good excuse for voting no though
---
The only reason warding was brought to the table was because jagex did a feedback survey and adding a new skill was something players wanted to see in the future was a popular selection. 
---
Instead of working with the community to see what kind of skill they wanted they got hung up on warding and are now trying to continually rework it to make it into something the community wants instead of working ground up with us to figure out the type of skill we want in the first place.  When the first talks of warding were brought up the community complete hated the thought of it and instead called for skills such as artisan, dungeoneering and sailing. Instead of listening to that kind of feedback they stayed hung up on warding.
---
It will fail the poll again and once again be a complete waste of dev time that could have been used on improving other aspects of the game.
---
It's better than a rune full helm
---
I like agility mate I have it as 99 lol
---
But implying that you can't complain a new skill doesn't look fun because there are already unfun skills in the game is silly.
---
Where do you actually use 4 runes though? Im sure it could be benefitial, but where would it be broken?
---
I guess one more slot in ToB as everyone can bring soul runes, and now you can blood barrage at any time
---
For osrs (or generally, mmorpgs) yes. But for League and Fortnite? Great monetization models.
---
I never said, nor implied, mtx was good for osrs. It modt definitely isn't, but noone said it was either.
---
He literally has to mention he's not on that project and yet you're still playing it off as though it was his time put into it.
---
"Let the content sink or swim based on its own merits"....He's telling people to give the blog post a read, so that's *literally* telling people to actually understand the content instead of being against it for some shitty meme
---
Eh tbh artisan felt weirder than slayer. Slayer you are learning the fine arts of killing unique beasts and creatures from masters of doing so 
---
Artisan you're doing chores in different skills and levelling a skill for it 
---
It would be like if farming contracts was its own skill.
---
The proposed idea does make sense actually and would have a tie to lore. The best melee helm in the game, bis melee capes are the f and infernal capes. Tanz looks like shit with f cape, also an ice whip looks odd... so why os it okay to have those items but our damn cape has to stay orange/ red.
---
It is certainly enough to change my stance from a solid No towards a maybe, i will have to read more about it first and give it more thought before i can make a decision.
---
Issues: 
---
* R2h is post 99 content for smithing, and its PROFITABLE, not a money loss
---
* Your using near tick-perfect rates for gold ore, but not for the r2hs?
---
* Cutting sapphires is common now for crafting training? in what world lmao
---
Hello Max, yeah I have started it and done up until you travel to Ape Atoll to give me access! I have already chinned at the MM1 caves from 75-83 - I am just curious if there is any faster ways? And I don't think it is possible **not** to gain any combat levels with prayer, no matter what level you are.  I think I gained around 4 combat levels going from 1-44 prayer, so it's not that bad.
---
As a skiller, the ability to repair rune pouches via warding is in incredibly enticing.
---
St. Peter when OP dies:
---
"Lmfao you didnt even finish Dragon Slayer!!"
---
Just turn on game sounds
---
Did I miss a poll?
---
So am I in the minority now when I say I don't want Warding? It has been polled and failed, I can see how the devs have already put a lot of time into it and don't want it to go to waste. But at this point it's being crammed down our throats. Was there ever any intention to respect the poll result and move on to other ideas/skills? Or is this just being reworked over and over until enough people stop caring and it magically passes 75%+? Why are other ideas completely abandoned when they fail a poll by a couple percent but this Warding skill has like 5 extra lifelines? It really feels to me like this is something the people who worked on it don't want to go to waste. But if it's not working, it's not working.
---
I love osrs, but some members of this community can be very obtuse and bullheaded. The guy you replied to as an example lol
---
They won't be super easy to obtain and there definitely won't be millions of sets coming in. Any armour that is in a similar power level to ahrim/ancestral will definitely take as long to get, there's no reason to assume otherwise
---
&gt;stack it so it passes
---
They're trying to make the best version of the skill that players want, do you really have a problem with them trying to satisfy the playerbase?
---
200k for full rune outside varrock bank world 1.
---
Not sure they are "making an argument" here I think they are making a point that different people who play the game want different things? It's all a matter of opinion... maybe some feel more strongly about it than others but I would strike this guy down for making a valid point because he's mentioned 2 skills that you wouldn't like to see?
---
Agree, this is a pivotal poll as far as the future of the game goes. If it gets added, it will undoubtedly be iterated on and added to (and new quests, too!), as well as set the standard for how future skill proposals may or may not fit into the game.
---
That'll be a yes from me, I think they've done an outstanding job incorporating feedback and designing a truly new "oldschool" skill that can bring a lot of great content into the game.
---
Warding has never been polled before.
---
no its not, crafting battlestaves is the same gp/xp but like 3x faster, nobody does sapphires to 99
---
I do Todt with game sounds. But notifications are a nice guarantee because you aren't interrupted on all actions, and also by the time you hear the noise you've missed the starting light.
---
That and I find the game sounds quite intrusive for Todt. Makes doing other things a bit less enjoyable
---
Yes because raids are old school? Blowpipe is old school? Zulrah is old school? This game will be dead in a couple years with this mentality.
---
This guy must have 99 slayer, because he just KILLED IT
---
but it does.....
---
Exactly. It's a max cape. Comp cape is an entirely different beast that isn't in OSRS (yet)
---
I thought I recognised your style of typing from yesterday, we get it you don’t wanna play Osrs you wanna play a fast paced first person shooter or somthing
---
Lmao
---
It means that imbues from NMZ (in particular ring imbues) are also obtainable through warding.
---
07 irons
---
Please join rs3, bye!
---
It's tier 80 mage armour
---
Way more than clicking once every 15 seconds on cannon tasks...
---
I don't mind Warding, I think I need to see someone actually do it before I can give an opinion though - maybe West or one of the other people working on it can show us something on a stream one day
---
Other skill ideas though? I don't know, but I've thought about it a bit and I think I like this most:
---
**Alchemy** - transmutation of items from one tier or type to another - this was poorly executed in RS3 but I think it's a great idea and a decent item 'sink' if people are looking for certain skilling materials - it would also stabilize prices within tiers for (for example) logs
---
Obviously I have no idea what would happen to Low/High Level Alchemy since moving them from Magic would probably have disastrous results, maybe training alchemy could boost the effectiveness (coins) of LLA/HLA - but then you have a gold sinking issue so I'm not sure lol
---
And other maxed players will combat that and tell people they can vote what they want to vote.
---
I swear I’ve seen the miner deplete ores on the ground but it could have been a player underneath.
---
This happens on most really crowed worlds like 416 tob, it annyoing
---
I'm sure you will need to make atleast 300 sets till 99
---
And when people don't want sailing they will vote no cus they want another skill instead.  warding is basically osrs last chance to get a new skill.  If it doesn't pass there's no point to even ask for another because people in the community wont compromise.  Is this this skill you want the most, maybe not.  But maybe if this passes the next skill will be.  If it goes well people will be more open minded to the skill you may want in the future.
---
They are designed to be at alch value, like every other mass produced buyable product. Having dagonhai robes be at alch value (150k-200k a set) is healthy for the pvp scene and is a much better solution than nerfing black dhide.
---
Incel
---
My stance is still the same, i will vote no because it seems like more boring busywork based on time spent in front of the computer rather than me getting better at the game.
---
Yup RFD is on the list to knock out. Just got 65/65 so I can go grab a defender first.
---
half the game isn't 'oldschool' anymore
---
I kinda feel this way as well, but it's fun to think up some ideas of where the game could go and how to make it interesting
---
I missed out on an RC level because the genie popped up the second i tele'd. It actually got me upset lmao
---
Why did the tree icon have a cancel icon on it ? Is it closed ?
---
What happened to the idea of gathering a small amount of vis via runecraft. It only seems logical that the skill used to create create magical runes would allow you to channel vis as well. It would really make runecraft more profitable like it used to be!
---
&gt; 3.8 darts per kill  
---
You shot your blowpipe ~20 times per kill? You rocking max mage and max range as well or what
---
It is ehp rates man.
---
Because that's too far on the other scale of things. That feeds the addiction further. You MUST keep grinding because otherwise that dude is still stronger than you 
---
It would also entirely change how player combat level works, changing npc interactions because bosses would need to scale, but how?
---
You're changing the entire game purely so you can feel marginal sense of achievement passed a 100 hour grind that you can do for 22 other skills..
---
Bad example.  Skill capes are given to those who demonstrate mastery in a skill, not just someone who can do all the parts of it.  Otherwise everyone would get an attack cape at 80.  
---
Some things are there to serve the gameplay, but there largely is a thematic logic behind the game.  Even if it only makes a little sense there's still some connection.
---
Which of the current 23 skills functions that way?
---
My point is that it'll be similar to magic or redwood trees in farming - hard to obtain as a solo player, and expensive to buy if you want to farm them. Sure, if you have a bil lying around you can finish the skill in 30-40 hours as they say, but by far most players won't even make one set of the top tier robes
---
I don't want to play Warframe i just used it as an example that a grindy game can be fun to play.
---
I'd personally vote yes to everything.
---
I always default to pray ranged on had, and switch to magic based on the sound affect.
---
But I die anyway because I'm shook and misclick ayylmao
---
Does anyone actually want a new skill?
---
So, for the rune essence pouches, does that mean after I make an infused rune essence pouch, I can go get the large medium and small back and use those as well? If so, holy RC buff.
---
Tons of people will vote out of spite. I understand there are legitimate reasons to vote no against Warding, and some people just don't want a new skill at all. However, a lot of people voting no are voting no because it's not the skill they want. This is such a flawed argument because Jagex is going to be more likely to introduce new skills if Warding passes, it's not like Warding has to be the only skill we ever see. Jagex really has taken the time to get Warding right, and it's been incredibly improved since it was first announced. It fits into the game, seems simple enough to train, and will bring a lot of useful rewards assuming most of them pass the polls. Unfortunately, I think it will fail anyways though.
---
Do you eat paint chips? That was the whole conversation. For the last. Fucking.  Time. Construction is good. It gives us good things. We were talking about how “it’s funny that you build one house and your skill is done lol weird”. That’s it. 
---
You came in with an argument nobody was having. That’s the only reason why you can’t win it, because nobody was arguing with you. It’s like “what if you leveled up, fished one shark, then hung up your harpoon forever?”  That was the observation. You’re trying so hard to win an argument that you can’t win, because it was never an argument. Someone made a silly observation.
---
Is it just me or does mod Kieren look really tired in that video?
---
For sure! I also felt like a king when I first got membership and graduated from selling at Varry West to selling in Cammy bank. You knew when you made the big time back then.
---
Yeah, I'm with you in that respect a little, I like the skill now but some of the rewards are still questionable, so I'm voting yes to the overall skill but no to a few sets of robes and maybe the gathering rings
---
Interesting, I've always wanted to try better than adamant darts, but always been too cheap. Do you find the extra gp spent was worth or not?
---
Yeah and the release of any buyable skill will have an effect to every other buyable skill that they simply cannot take into account when trying to calculate prices.
---
If you vote no, odds are they are going to take it back to the drawing board as they have before. If anything sailing will only be released after warding gets released and that's only IF it gets released. If no one wants this new skill, I doubt they're going to try another one.
---
&gt; its a loophole around getting directly paid for the runelite client
---
So we make the skill even more useless?  No thanks.
---
I'm seriously 99% sure this will absolutely not pass because of the "If you want updates go play RS3 retards" *kills Zulrah in elite void with a blowpipe* crowd. I want nothing more than this skill to pass
---
Except it’s not a loophole in any capacity.
---
Play it at the end of Q&amp;A?
---
Almost all of them, what you are doing at high levels is incredibly similar to what you were doing at the early ones, even Slayer with all it's bosses it's just basic *"go kill X amount of Y monsters"* type missions over and over again.
---
No warding
---
Not really. Gold ore is what people do for smithing and its xp rates are correct. They should only be looking at the fastest sustainable methods for their rates. Sapphires and R2hs are irrelevant.
---
Go to Ward (anvil) with channeling lamp (hammer) with vis and fabric (bars) unless I'm missing something. Vis obtained from dissolving items. Not too bad
---
&gt;pvp
---
&gt;castle wars
---
i hope you're not serious
---
Boundaries are good for children tho. Being on the computer all day is disastrous for your social life too. Did you develop other interests later in life? 
---
When I was still able to go to school I did very well compared to my peers, even though I spent little time learning it before I started my IT study. Every (soft) skill you develop in life is beneficial, I think having broad experience is more important than being a one-trick pony.
---
Gotcha. Yeah that's basically the main reason I play as an ironman (the other reason is that this is how I basically used to play during the 2005-2007 pre-GE era, since I didn't know many people in-game, so this was my nostalgia).
---
Remember to vote no to this cancerous monstrosity.
---
time to make an ironman
---
Im not really a fan of the new armors. How expensive are they gunna be? 
---
Dagonhai is t30 and a straight upgrade from 3a mage. It shoupd be like 60 or 70 def since its better gear than ahrims for dps and probably non degradeable. 
---
Bloodbark stats alone are pretty good for pking. Is it gunna be more expensive than mystic or are we just upgrading with no drawbacks?
---
This happened to me 5 times this weekend alone. 2 dunces &amp; 3 genies right as soon as I click to teleport. It pisses me off for a solid half hour every time it happens.
---
The bossing mechanics are very minimal and don't do much.
---
&gt;using ancestral, karils and serp helm max combat
---
Well no arma but pretty mutch.
---
Personanly i only do like 5 or 6 addy darts per kill  so its not that big difference.
---
Why are you getting so aggressive over comments that weren't negatively aimed at you? Also, what boss mechanics does runelite help you with? The only one i can think of off the top of my head are demonic gorillas.
---
Yoink
---
Pretty sure ironmen also skew the stats. Battlestaves are pretty much dead content, you do glass blowing most of the time. Gemshop is a good alternative. As a main it really doesn't matter what you do as long as it's fast xp because you'll cover the money lost with zulrah or vorkath
---
&gt;sense of accomplishment 
---
lmao
---
The armour crafting already exists in crafting with xerician.
---
Imbues would make more sense in runecrafting and magic than warding. They are purely shoehorned to get out of nmz.
---
Currently you use runecrafting and magic to infuse a crystal with boots to make bis boots. You use magic to cast "magic imbue" which lets you combine runes, and to enchant jewellery making bis jewellery.
---
It is hardly elegant to make a new skill to do one new thing in this regard, rather than expand on the existing structure.
---
Also you misunderstood my alching comment. The only items people will use for dissolving will be items at alch values already. Because they are extremely plentiful. Think things like steel plate bodies etc.
---
They don't have a developed and fleshed out invention mechanic that will bolster clue rewards etc. It's far too simplified and will just result in gp value raising. Which other sinks already do and isn't really a "good" thing to infinitely do. As it pushes new players away a bit as gear becomes more and more expensive.
---
Honestly that's my biggest problem with it, that it isn't game altering at all. 
---
BIS mage gear is basically the same, most of the mid leveled gear will just get dissolved again for extra xp and supplies, it's literally just another 100 hour grind for another buyable skillcape that will literally not affect the game at all. Most of the new items look like garbage. It's literally as pointless as crafting and smithing are now.
---
The biggest problem with magic is the retarded way they make most monsters immune to it or so weak to it that you don't need magic gear. Zulrah and COX are great steps to making magic gear actually matter, but again, warding doesn't change the gear people use there. 
---
Arguably the biggest impact it will have is separating imbued items from nmz, but that doesn't really justify a new skill when that could easily have been in magic or runecrafting.
---
The main reason they're doing this is so they don't remove existing imbues from the game. This would cause a lot of people to vote no just so they don't lose their imbues. It's a smart move on Jagex's part imo, even though I do agree they should only come from Warding.
---
Free for the full game.
---
You could literally just get runelite and turn off every single plugin and it would be a better experience than the official client.
---
Theres so many things that don't even relate to combat or making things easier that are worth having the client for, GPU rendering being one of the best by far
---
You ever seen that Timmy Turner gif where the parents are taking Timmy to some “roller coaster” rides?
---
But they’re actually just going up an elevator when Timmy says “where’s the ride?”
---
And then the parents say “this is the ride! Yippee!”
---
That’s Runescape in all of its glory. 
---
Skilling ain’t fun. The fun part are the actual addiction to experience gains. Nothing else.
---
Like I said, dumb. Do you know what the difference between acting high and mighty and sarcasm is?
---
Yeah but even if there's only a 45% vote you know it's going to come eventually
---
Except it is, why would a company let you charge for something they offer for free? that just asking to get it, especially when they own the IP on it
---
Combat has and will always be able to be simply afk'd. Before nmz people did it at bandits or gorillas. it changed nothing but the place people did it at and the speed.
---
i read the whole thing and looks very polished to me. Support from me
---
Haha Jed
---
It was way more complicated the first time they suggested this skill, they have made it easier or similar to the other armour crafting skills.
---
I hate strawberries for no reason. Just do.
---
What are the alch values for all of the new robes? These will all be alch value in a week.  
---
Are we okay with the amount of botting around thieving/hunter/wc thats going to be introduced to obtain silk and vls? These all sound like highly afk activities that are going to be reasonably profitable.
---
Why can I carry 2,1 billion cannonballs, it makes no sense.

When I heard about the gmaul nerf I got 60 att and started to go to 44s a lot more and honestly have loved it, I’m a shit nher but it has been a blast. A little scary bringing claws tho lol
---
yeah, it’s big brain time
---
Yikes. Risk means “if you accidentally login to the wrong world you should lose your items.” To you?
---
Big y i k e s
---
I am not against the content being proposed but I don't believe it needs to come from a new skill. I will be voting no to Q1, but will vote yes and no to the other questions depending on my preferences - ie, yes to the Tomes, no to the Skilling Rings.
---
The fact that he works 20hr a week on it and questions working on it every day goes to show how demotivating it is for him(especially now compared to back when he “enjoyed” doing it)
---
I remember training on hill giants for a long time. Always focused on picking up the limp roots because someone told me they were good to sell. I got up to 111 of them and asked a higher level player if he wanted them. He was like "uhh yeah sure" and offered me 111k. I couldn't fucking believe it, I felt incredibly rich.
---
We pay we gay i say nay to warding
---
Sad! It's like seeing a bunch of seniors all wrapped up in a pyramid scheme, but in this case, it's "adults" eagerly telling everyone else that the college education they purchased really has value. The emperor doesn't have clothes just because you think he does, buddy.
---
I trust you OP
---
Just because you want a different skill doesn't mean you should vote no to Warding. It's not like if Warding passes they'll never offer a new skill again. Saying you think "well players want a skill that excites them" you mean Sailing? Literally the most adventurous skill ever offered and it failed. That's not the case, the problem is there is no catch all skill. Some will love Warding, others will hate it, just as withe very other skill. You can try to appease as many as you can, but no matter how hard you try you can't please everyone.
---
Blood runes
---
Do you want to be told go kill 43 cows then come back here. Now go kill 130 jellys?
---
"You'll also notice that all of the poll questions (such as armours, other items, and other content) require the core skill to pass as they tie into Warding in some way. Therefore, should the core skill of Warding not pass, the other questions will be considered to have failed this poll too."
---
Why? I love some of the content, but not the skill as a whole.
---
I actually really enjoyed MMII and DSII and would happily do them again.
---
Thank you assholes_and_weed.
---
&gt;
---
I know they aren't, jagex could argue they are infringing on their ip, its as simple as that.
---
Jagex tried to argue that, they had no legal ground to stand on - Adam removed the decompiler and any other infringing assets. RuneLite is not copyright infringement, it's just free and open-source software.
---
LOL you feel embarrassed for the entirety of OSRS players because of a number on a Patreon page that pretty much none of them knew about prior to today?
---
Unless jamflex doesn’t MTX like they did to rs2-rs3. 
---
That got me off rs for good till I saw this sub and found osrs.
---
Edgeville(5m cost) &gt; camelot(quest locked) &gt; lumbridge basement(quest locked) &gt; falador (?) &gt; lumbridge

Why would they? Runelite already exists, I don’t think there’s anything to be gained from the very bare bones default client.
---
Doing what? you'll get at least 26k/hr doing Astrals.
---
Thanks for posting, been looking for a good mobile training method that's not nmz lol
---
their back end data probably shows a lot of sapphires being cut, they are intepreting the data wrong though
---
So it's their client that is shitty and not your keyboard?
---
Runelite also has RuneWater, if you're into that.
---
I think the earth tome would be a good fit for the skilling boss coming with SotE.

Read the blog before you

As someone who is complete garbage at pking the clicks are everything. Missing a freeze or spec can cost you a KO easily, and allows for free dps. I would say yes if it was something like non-combat spells or maybe keep the ancient spellbook locked as it is.
---
It's an old meme referring to players thinking you need to talk to Oziach (the NPC from Dragon Slayer quest) in order to be eligible to get a draconic visage to drop.
---
The minigame is members only, afaik.
---
July 25th
---
osrs twitter has some real cancer
---
Some parts of some skills are though, like efficient tithe farm
---
Because it saves them from having to do it themselves. I mean even if you use RuneLite or OSBuddy, your subscription money still goes to Jagex. So why not let an unsanctioned 3rd party client do all the work? And if something eventually goes wrong, they can just say "Well we never supported them so it's on you guys."
---
I'm just talking about stuns, not piling in general.
---
Why would it not? Jagex employees and other streamers all use it on stream lol.
---
Cause it is a DONATION. Aka people do it cause they want to SUPPORT something. If people really wanted to donate the money to Jagex instead, they could just buy bonds and not use them. There is no argument for them cutting into JAGEXs profits at all.
---
There is a warning, you have a choice to disable it.
---
IIRC this is because they had put a significant amount of work into much of it already, and when it didn't pass the poll they wanted to still make use of many of them.
---
This still doesn't mean other things can not be added. Also not all new additions from skills need to be items, transport methods are another option as well, though not the only one.
---
They already did that and the game developed so many game breaking bugs they were forced to turn off the servers permanently.
---
nice
---
July 25th i keep hearing
---
We don’t need crafting 2.0 or another bank stander
---
Reading through the comments i think most of the people stil didnt become man yet :(
---
I dont know bout you people.. but the first time i entered that cave i did not find anny dragons or other monsters like you people are talking about.
---
But it was sure warm with a high humidity...
---
No Problem i like this a lot for training on Mobile
---
On a side note, does this Tea taste funny to you?
---
It's closer to hundreds of individual contributors, and it took a long time and lots of dedication.
---
Jagex will likely opt to use a modified version of Runelite as their official client within a year or 2.
---
What members quests do you recommend for a level 34?
---
I just don't think you should be insulting people for no reason, especially since i never insulted you, what good does insult me do? i don't even want to talk to you anymore because all you're going to do is insult me without actually saying anything. Jagex has to protect their IP, they could say this is profiting off their IP, simple as thats, it doesn't matter how successful their relationship is, jagex might not care that they are getting money through patreon, they also might care.
---
 
---
It's a lot of what if's but if jagex suddenly asks them to stop, i would not be surprised, they might never ask because they might  not care but my point is they could make an argument that they are profiting off their IP and ask them stop.  
---
What exactly did i say that made me come off with "an air of superiority"  ?
---
I gotta disagree with you. Quite a few of the new released items and areas fit in with the style nicely.
---
There's definitely been some flops, but overall a lot of the new content has stuck to the old school feel in my opinion.
---
Look at the averages. Everything jagex polls gets 90% yes now regardless of what kind of garbage it is. Exception being if the content gets huge backlash. We obviously don't have polls for warding yet but I'm seeing a lot of negativity about it and I think a lot of people are just opposed a new skill in general.
---
No use. Hackers can skull your char and suicide it in wild.
---
Well I know in a Q&amp;A they mentioned probably doing it with two rings (since most gem rings are "non-combat" related. I do think earrings would be a neat add-on in future, since most MMOs have a slot for that.
---
It was, but it was also polled as a potential skill to be added, it failed with 68%.
---
I did vote yes to it at the time, but I also agree that it is maybe best that it did not pass as the idea was not entirely well fleshed out or perfected, not nearly as indepth as they are currently with warding.
---
Out of the loop on this one
---
&gt; cooking essentially gives you 2 more food items if you're willing to take the time 
---
yes I know, that's why it is exceptionally overpowered. In PvP situations 2 extra food is a hilariously large advantage. In most PvM situations where healing/inventory space is a concern, brews are used anyway, but it would still be ridiculous in any situation where it WAS useful. It also would be unconscionably strong for ironmen.
---
&gt; defense is meant to be a tank cape 
---
yes, but as I said in another comment... "Best tank cape in the game is infernal cape, with +12 to everything, but its also only obtained from the most difficult PvM challenge in the game, and even though the fire cape is significantly easier and only 1 less def in each stat, its still a much greater thing to risk than 99k. Maaaaybe +15 to each def stat, but even that is pushing it."
---
&gt; Attack offers no strength so I also disagree it's OP 
---
again to copy from another of my comments: "Mythical cape is used in a lot of places where crush bonus is important (think Vetion, etc), and is only +6. Ardy Cape is very useful where you need stab bonus, and is only +6, and is locked behind an elite achievement diary. Infernal is best for slash and is only +4". 
---
Those capes are very effective when used, and +10 to any would be very very strong, +10 to all in one cape would be very overpowered. Something like +6 slash could make it a best in slot, although a very niche one, and would keep it in line with the other BIS attack bonus capes.
---
&gt; My last post had strength cape at +6 and I got a LOT of comments that it was better than the fire cape. Now it would only be slightly worse since it has not attack or defense bonuses. 
---
I actually wouldn't hate having it at like +5 or +6 with no other bonuses. That way it has its drawbacks, but is still certainly useful. I don't think it would be awful to have something be stronger than the fire cape that is harder to obtain, although people love the fire cape so I can see why it would be controversial.
---
Sounds like the rate is for $7.99 per month if you only got 200 days credit.
---
They're putting time into it because they want to make the skill good though. If they put no time into it the skill would still be ass. They've taken a lot of feedback and made proper changes to the skill that have really improved it a lot since it was introduced. Read the blog fully and vote no if you don't like Warding. Don't vote no because you think the game is broken, that's not even true.
---
So i sound like a cunt because its a donation? Jagex could argue they are profiting off their IP.
---
OP: I'm proud of my accomplishment!
---
Everyone in the comments: Let's shit on OP
---
They cant design the game around puzzles anymore. Runelite would just add a plugin to solve it for you.
---
One that comes to mind (I think) was the dragon platebody.
---
But that was also part of the issue with the original sailing skill idea, the rewards from it were... out of place.
---
I agree that we need an answer on this. Rune pouch is the best purchase of my life and if they rob me of it regardless of how fond I am of the perks to this skill, I'll be salty.   
---
I'm hoping they mean they'll replace all future rune pouches in the Bounty Hunter store with that version and let us keep the old one/upgrade it to a 4 rune pouch.
---
This wouldn't be possible for many reasons. Things like macro and other things that are against the rules would be far more plausible due to not being able to track your movements and clicks from being offline.
---
I don’t think the game should remain in its 2007 state forever, and as you’ve mentioned it’s already very different. That said, I don’t think warding is a good idea as a skill, and it really feels like they’re forcing it. There are lots of people who are voting no not because they’re resistant to change, but because they just don’t like the idea.
---
It was supposed to be 12 months and I have no idea how 12 months is 200 days. Shit’s so annoying because Jagex has no way to contact them it seems and this post isn’t going to get upvoted. So annoying dude.
---
But hard clues are fun
---
I agree, we need two new skills
---
I totally agree. Although parts of the mage arena can be very frustrating, it's a really unique area. I'd hate to see it become obsolete
---
No that’s unintelligent
---
I also like that the re-iterated the fact that there is a continuity error in terms of where these magic items come from.
---
No battle pets/anything related to summoning, no location specific requirements, and I’ll be fine with it.
---
A lot of my classmates and friends were gamers too. We were perfectly social in school, and then we’d usually all go home and scape, which turned into Xbox Live parties in high school. Good times.
---
Should also be noted that you also gain some extra xp/h from the dust which makes some of your other tasks slightly faster
---
what bluetooth mouse do you have? something I may try out, I use mobile a lot
---
Just download a private server script.
---
Group fishing boss when?
---
Maybe this can bring an end to my hunt for the Magma Mutagen, just to match my helmet to cape....
---
Your choice on Assembler/Trimmed, Dragon Diamond, Ely &gt; Ward &gt; Spectral or DFS, Yes B gloves, I'd personally use Suffering and Kodai as you can't use Guthans
---
This amazing idea got brought up when M.Karrulm was first coming out. one of the Jmods excitedly mentioned it to the other jmods on the couch. Then that fat disgusting fuck Mod Kieran instantly shot it down as not oldschool enough.
---
4 accounts with a no from me. No new skills in this game. Period.
---
If you buy memberships through the website and not bonds its $8-11 a month per account.
---
***Attack 2 starts playing***
---
But he still complied, which would say otherwise, that jagex does have a legal leg to stand on? 
---
It's not longer just a point of copyright infringement, but profiting off their IP
---
I already have a 75 attack one, so probably stay 50 for a while to risk fight or rush, then go 60.
---
This update sucks because gmaul has been the same for what 14 years.
---
So if someone wants to donate money to them, they should not accept it, even though they are doing tons of work for free? Makes no sense dude...
---
Gamer Girl Bath Water
---
For so many reasons
---
ive done about 500ish solos and ive definitely had raids where ive been doing everything correctly and being incredibly frustrated wondering why everything wasnt registering at olm, ive always just assumed it had something to do with my max25fps that i pull or it spawning as a 'scuffed olm' which is does 25% of the time
---
hard to tell however ive just gotten used to it over time as my pcs not brill
---
Sadly these fools have as much say as us and will ruin the game.
---
it must be sad not knowing how to read. I know it might be tough for you, but you should really give it a shot one day
---
That sounds like an absolute win.
---
yes
---
It sure as fuck matters what the upfront bias is supposed to be because thats the lens through which we view 'freedom of expression'.
---
Oh, and false dichotomy much? You gotta be a real dunce to think that last bit means a damn thing, fuck you and your opinions.
---
I remember my uncle and I (he was about 4 years older) and he told me he found a guy who would buy a thousand iron ore for 100k. I did that deal so many times as a kid
---
Not if they had access to your email too.
---
The google docs post seems to say that Combat Rings will be created via warding. There is ambiguity:  
---
"Combat rings already exist in-game as rewards from the Nightmare Zone. These will be creatable via skilling as well."  
---
The antipoison lantern doesn't seem to be useful at all as an offhand. When would you use it?
---
Yeah the boss is trash.
---
My guess is that it's not used as a gender descriptive word? Possibly used how "man"kind is used?
---
I see that it was the latter.
---
If you're praying to block all incoming damage then there's like a +11 prayer bonus increase tho right?
---
With no questing required.
---
My only gripe is the method for training. Everybody hates runecrafting but nobody is saying anything about how the new skill trains the exact way. Arrive at bank, sip stamina, withdraw seconds,teleport/run to warding place, craft your seconds into xp, go back to bank and repeat.
---
I like most of it, do have some critiques though:
---
For Pado's set: 25% extra mage damage seems too high for a tier 30 equipment, even against a niche (although "demons" is a pretty big niche). Especially with god tier prayer bonus. This would be insane for people barraging demonic gorillas.
---
Thaumaturge seems very cool, although I would be worried about the balancing, especially since it is a relatively low tier set.
---
I'm all about the Bloodbark armor. I love mage armor that trades def bonus. However, I think maybe it should have some negative offensive bonuses for range and/or melee. Also maybe tier 60? 55 just seems awkward since I don't think any other gear in the game is unlocked at 55.
---
The Astral set makes sense for lore, but its DOA as far as usability. Maybe give us an Astral staff too, to replace the lunar staff so we can use it instead of draman? 
---
Again the Soulbark is awesome except it seems OP to have rune armor def with no offensive ranged penalty, even if it is tier 70.
---
The levels for the combat ring imbues seem like they start a little low, but I understand they really want to funnel people away from NMZ, so that's not a huge issue.
---
I definitely don't like the skilling rings, it just doesn't ***feel*** OldSchool. While its good when skills interact with each other, I don't enjoy when you feel like you are explicitly missing out in training one skill because you haven't done another.
---
I like the other elemental tomes, but I don't like being able to create the pages. Its nice that right now the burnt pages and tome of fire come from the same place, and they make sense together. Like "Oh I've killed this Hill Giant boss and gotten a tome of air, but now I need to go train an unrelated skill to use it?"
---
The magic incantations seem a little OP. Like currently you use a blessing in the ammo slot if you're not using ammo, and its a +1 prayer bonus (+2 if you've got elite diary done), which is basically nothing. I like the idea, but maybe have fewer of them and make the best one like +3 att, +2 def or something?
---
The anti-poison lamp is very cool! However I think this is one that would make sense to have multiple tiers of, where the highest tier could hold every type, the second highest tier could hold every time except the strongest anti, etc.
---
I'm split on the Large Rune Pouch. It seems weird to have to rune pouch still be buyable only from slayer/BH store, but have its upgrade be in a completely unrelated skill. I like the other two pouches though.
---
Scrolls of redirection I'm fine with, as long as they stay untradeable.
---
The fused essence pouch is cool, although I think I'd certainly rather it degraded after a specific amount of uses, rather than a chance roll every time. I could see that being very frustrating.
---
Gosh that was long, I can't imagine anyone will read this wall of text. Oh well :)
---
Osbuddy has a shit gpu renderer
---
Why isn't it obtainable?
---
The same way you're training in NMZ you can train in cyclops...
---
You heard right
---
Pm me ur ign and I can hook you up with my clan, we have guys there who live at bandos and we raid often.
---
Some cool set effect ideas, and I myself have suggested the effect of lowering Standard Spellbook combat spells by 1 tick a few times, via a new ring.
---
The problem I have here with these set effects, is they all require a damn helmet, that means no Slayer and no Castle Wars. Where would we use these set effects? The Thaumaturge effect is something I have wanted in the game forever, but not bound to an entire armor set.
---
And we aren't taking Pado's set to go fight K'ril or Cerberus...
---
If I can't see any use for any of the new items that Warding brings to the game then I'd have to vote no.
---
I don't think Warding should stop at creating Magical armors, we should be able to improve certain Magical staves and other items.
---
-Using Warding we should be able to upgrade the Thammarons Scepter giving it a BUILT-IN spell using the same animation as the Undead Druids in Forthos Dungeon (or a new unique animation).
---
-Using Warding we should be able to merge the Void Knight Mace and the Staff of the Dead to create the Staff of Balance, giving it the same stats as Staff of Light except with the ability to auto-cast Claws of Guthix.
---
-Using Warding we should be able to upgrade our Imbued God Cape giving it a "Charge" effect so we don't need to recast the spell every 6 minutes.
---
-Using Warding we should be able to upgrade the Seers Ring giving it a special effect, the Thaumaturge effect. This could bring the Seers ring up in power/value to make it more on the level of the Berserker Ring and Archers Ring.
---
Wow this is so much more improved than before. I was on the seat before, but now this truly feels like it can fill the magic-crafting gap that exists in osrs today. Support
---
&gt; The minigame is just another grind
---
This entire game is a grind, what's your point?
---
Gielinor is a different planet, so the days and months would probably be different lengths.
---
came down here for this.
---
Play fixed mode then 😋
---
There's no such thing as pvp or pvm weapons. There's just weapons. What you choose to use it for is a choice that you make and not something that is intrinsic to the weapon.
---
No warding... change death mechanic, put auth delay and rework the old dead content...
---
Got to account for donos and bits and sponsors. B0atman had 10k subs for a while too.
---
Yeah that would be a problem, just take the armadyl route and give it negative melee bonus.
---
I'm not saying I fear afk methods or splashing as it is. I am saying there is no reason to buff splashing and incentivise it with this new skill. It seems unnecessary and we would be better off having more items leave the game for vis than having people splash magic for it.
---
Get that Fremmy helm bro.
---
I wish there was mobile version of Runelite then I could always use Runelite.
---
Its not a glitch he probably had an identical character with a very similar name
---
they should really add ads on their man, rl is complete free of use and it should generate some revenue for them.
---
That's a lot of fun, of course! I'm going to avoid sounding pretentious by telling a story about my highs and lows, but I don't see this as one of the better phases of my life. You just can't let gaming define who you are. See, being a gamer is fun, but it's not the best way to gain life experience and live a fulfilling life. Staring at a screen day in day out means losing out on a lot of fun experiences. It's a very safe way to live, but it's not great if you want to develop.
---
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to see a crackhead/heroin addicted 50 something year old girlfriend of mine while I'm back in my study town for the day anyway.
---
It’s alright.
---
To tell me
---
What you think
---
About me
---
Imagine unironically using a dragonbone necklace.
---
V
---
I loved the level design of the floors, I never did make it to warped floors but the art style looked sweet.
---
funny cos none of u acc know him :))
---
&gt;warding is quality content
---
hahahahahaha
---
14 + 56 != 70
---
W A T E R S K I N
---
Why?
---
I feel like if this doesn't pass, we'll never see new skills in OSRS. Which is a bit sad, since it would be some new content which we haven't seen for a long time.
---
I SeE iT wAS tHe LaTteR
---
bro, it literally explains it in the new wiki magic section page... https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Magic
---
Imp ditching the farming tie in is a shame and a mistake, but its a yes from me
---
Haha, I get it, because it has a crab!
---
Long grinds? In my Runescape? As an Ironman? Unexpected.
---
Sweet, thanks man!
---
I like the idea of getting vis from Runecrafting as well, actually. Seems to fit with the whole magical side of the skill, as long as it's not the best way and only small quantities. Like a by-product :)  
---
Presumably it'd be added to your inventory at the same time as the runes? (Can't think of any other time it would appear, but maybe you have!)
---
This is how I explain it to my friends. I have ADHD and simply sitting and watching something is extremely difficult for me but being able to play something simple while doing it makes it much more relaxing and enticing for me.
---
&gt;everyone voting no is spite voting
---
hmmm
---
The big haha funny
---
Just out of curiosity. Does Jagex ban all associated accounts or do they just ban/mute the accounts doing the actual scamming?
---
They literally can't get into the warriors guild at their stats. STR+ATT&lt;130
---
Those stats are definitely good enough, so morytania hard for increased profit.
---
43 prayer and Ibans blast is all you need to be able to do it. You can do it with a lower level spell than that, but it'll be quite a bit slower, and obviously the better your stats/gear are, the easier it'll be.
---
Yo, if you could acknowledge that your conclusion here is incorrect and edit to communicate that, it would be very helpful
---
I mean I understand it gets boring but honestly that’s just because of how much he’s achieved on his iron. He’s going for all PVM drops which means he’s gonna hit some really nasty grinds. Corp took forever, ancient wyverns took a long ass time. I like to check in once every few days just to check if he’s gotten anymore uniques knocks off.
---
Yes! New quest about Dagon'hai would be great. And if this armour is quest locked it won't kill Ahrim's completely
---
I love you.
---
I hope you have a great day, kind soul.
---
Nah. Rune scims were always 25-30k back in 06. I remember on Fridays I used to always fish 100 lobbies, then stand around the south-east end of Varrock big bank and sell them for 250 gp ea, then buy a rune scim with my newly gathered 25k. 
---
I also remember full rune always hovering around 175-200k. Buying that first full rune set... what a feeling. Except not equipping the plate until a guy finally went to Crandor to fk the game up.
---
I think a new grandmaster quest in this quest-line would be cool with a new post quest boss (like Vorkath) that could drop these or goldsink attachments for current weapons.
---
1 kill trips are normal for blowpipe, and you should tele out if you don't get a good bgs spec and try again. Otherwise grind for a dhcb or lance (I prefer lance cause I like melee more than range)
---
&gt;•I dont want splashing buffed as a way to get vis. An alternative could be that you get small amounts of vis from runecrafting?
---
Splsahing have always been a thing in game and will always be, might as well give it a legit reason to happen, and also, according to the blog you could  get vis from RuneCrafting.
---
Allow us to kill tzhaar champion for red champs cape or gnome champion for green champs cape (currently these champs exist but are impossible to fight)
---
I dont know if anything happens to them
---
then why would people do the minigame, its less xp...
---
I don't believe you. This is the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen.
---
Just be patient and corner trick them (guide on wiki), it's much easier than actually hiding in safe-spots.
---
Dont go into a PvP world no matter how safe you feel. Its not that tough and I’m done arguing with some bitch boy who’s gonna quit the game anyway
---
200k aint shit buster brown
---
It was just so satisfying compared to mining regular ores since you'd get a fair constant stream of essence relative to spending 45 seconds watching your character struggle to pick out 1 coal ore.
---
Uninspired
---
Wait, hold on. Do you mean to tell me the best magic armor you can ward only requires level 80? Also, LMS beta just came out and it's all about hybridding, a big part of hybridding is catching people wearing robes and speccing them out. The SoulBark armor is literally rune armor but you never splash. I don't know about that one chief.
---
Then you're definitely going to have a better experience
---
He’d make so much just charging a 2$ one time fee for a download. It’s ridiculous how much effort he puts into this.
---
I don't think there is any harm in asking. The good thing about how these questions are laid out is that 12 has no impact on 10 and 11. If they were all bundled into one question, however, then the last part would bring the whole lot down.
---
that because reddit has a upvote system, check out /vg/
---
It was the only goal I really had on the account
---
I loved the look of it, the concept of having a super agile/ near unlimited run character, the emote and the rarity. Training it was done on World 46 with the ape atoll clan chat with like dozens of other players.
---
I committed to it mainly cause my friend's friend who was way better at the game didn't think I'd be able to do it, cause at the time I was like 68 combat and haven't even gotten barrows gloves. (I was like 13/14)
---
So to me it felt like a lot
---
After the update the cc for ape atoll that was always full slowly started getting less and less players flowing in and chatting. Game was changing rapidly and the time I right about quit altogether was squeal of fortune. I didn't really feel like doing anything else in runescape cause its combat didn't interest me, since I liked shooters and action games a lot more.
---
That's just my own personal story. Runescape started doing the same to many other skills (Runespan and ivy come to mind) so it kind of felt like "what's the point in playing if in a year the skill becomes 3x faster and more afk"
---
I've paid the ultimate price
---
Slayer 2 would definitely pass. =P
---
place looks like a sad thumb print
---
STILL
---
Dragon Slayer II felt like a short quest and I believe I spent as long on the MM2 docks as I did on the entirety of DS2
---
make sure to turn your accept aid off or they will use heal other on you to counter this counter
---
I hated Kruk's dungeon, I think the single design goal was to be even worse than Zooknok's cave, but the airship docks were rather fun and visually unique.
---
Where should I go what should I do
---
I love this because one of the things I have been disappointed in since I started all those years ago is the lack of mage "stuff."
---
Sounds like somebody needs some osrs friends and some goals!
---
Would rather see a real pk vid than just someone in a mini game. No risk, no excitement. We are just watching you get rng
---
Fair
---
Yea MEP2 only took me like an hour. Super easy with a guide. Only annoying part was shade attacks interrupting the rotate interface and falling off the handholds 7-8 times.
---
Unlock aviansies as a task and use slayer helm
---
Pretty nice for early btw rc levels since that is only a little less than you'd get from running cosmics the cancer way and no gathering pure ess.
---
You literally just told yourself what to do..
---
I don't like the Skilling/Resource Gathering Rings. They feel very out of place.
---
The minigame is up there with corp beast for being one of the most private-server things in OSRS
---
They were fun until you failed late into them and had to basically start all the way over. Then they became super unfun very quickly.
---
Really slow shotgun. YOU CAN DO BETTER I BELIEVE.
---
Why would they give any proof though? So not makers can improve their anti-detection system?
---
I'm not saying you were botting but just pointing out that you haven't actually provided proof that you weren't botting.
---
Do false bans happen? Yes and it's absolutely unfair to the player. Hopefully they overturn your ban if you weren't botting.
---
Yeah not like we have recolors for anything else like slayer helms and weps this would set a dangerous precedent
---
It's because of rs3
---
No from me, doubt this would ever pass
---
elite void pegs anguish etc.
---
normal diamond bolts e
---
eagle eye
---
rigour I calculated to not really be worth it and it makes it less afk because prayer drains faster.
---
Lmao this is now the 2nd botched shotgun attempt I've seen on here in as many weeks. We really are dweebs aren't we?
---
I've got to say, this skill is really starting to blossom. I hope the community reads this blog instead of immediately shooting it down
---
That being said, I'd like to overview some likes/dislikes and minor suggestions I have:
---
• Robe making looks solid, and I like all of the new robe sets besides the Bark sets. Instead of making the defensive stats in-line with metal armor, balance it more effectively through the 3 styles. It is made of wood, not metal, so the melee defence should be slightly worse while offering magic and range bonus
---
• Incantations should degrade and disappear, seeing as they are cheap to make and provide a much needed sink for talismans. Could possibly offer more Incantations that offer prayer bonus as well, requiring a Blessing to make
---
• My understanding of the rune pouch scenario may be off, but from my understanding you would be rendering the rune pouch everyome already has as wilderness only? And then lock new rune pouches, which hold 2 types (65 warding) and 4 types (83 warding) of runes? 
---
If this is the case, my biggest gripe for the skill falls here, which in the grand scheme isn't bad at all as I seriously doubt players would vote this portion through
---
All in all, great work taking all the harsh feedback and putting it towards a positive use
---
I've been on the break for about a year now. I got the itch the other day. Logged in and stood there for a bit and logged back out. I'm sure I'll come back eventually. I usually take about a year or so break at a time every 6ish months of playing. It just doesn't have the magic it used to because it's devolved into nothing but numbers and how to make those numbers go up as fast as possible. I know it's always been this way, but it's just not masked anymore with the way the community has shifted and my limited time forcing me to be the same way if I ever want to accomplish anything.
---
Why would you need defense to wear an incantation?
---
magic or prayer id understand, but defense???
---
\-&gt; i personally feel like defense should be related to the clothes/ armor you wear. weapons, capes, ammunition, rings and necklaces should not be based on defense. however, id welcome if there were other requirements. like agility, hunter or runecrafting to equip items in the ammunition slot.
---
Not voting no out of spite.  I still think the whole concept of warding is unnecessary and not needed in the game at all.
---
It's worth it if it's not stopping you from buying other items, but only if you have the money spare whilst having all the other gear you need.
---
I need to get a99 so I can do this
---
If you have Amazon prime, then you get twitch prime. With twitch prime you have the option to unlock various loot from different games. Jagex offers 1 month of membership, it's kinda like a partnership deal.

Stand 1 square away from dawn, flick the prays and move 1 step in if dawn is low. 90%+ success rate in my 2.6k kills
---
Why couldn't this just be a part of crafting but with a magic level requirement?
---
It does need a new skill to keep people engaged and continue to grow the game.
---
The only thing I worry about are the skilling ring imbues. I saw that the items to imbue them would be non-tradeable. I assume it would also make the rings untradeable? 
---
If so, I love it. This is such a better version of warding that I'm actually really excited about. The xp rates I'm a little skeptic of, but I'm sure that'll be more refined as things get worked out
---
Something something children something something class a drugs something.
---
After a certain period of inactivity your account will lose is name. That way another current player can take it. It sucks but that appears to be what happened to you
---
i shall counter it by not reading it and voting yes
---
I understand where you're coming from. As i stated, i'll give them proof if needed. I understand why they would think i am, i was on for nearly 12hrs a day for the last 2 weeks.
---
Got some pretty sweet suggestions tho.
---
The next grandmaster quest they'd work on would be in the desert they said so only zeah would be remaining.
---
Could be cool, I remember them mentioning they didn’t want to make normal spell book more powerful than ancients so might be a problem? Idk
---
Can't even count how many breaks I've taken from this game anymore. Always come back. I don't even cancel my subscription anymore
---
Warding bad
---
Neither is MEP2. I did it in about 50 minutes while following along Slayermusiq's guide.
---

---
If you’re going to make broad generalizations about the community and the wants if specific parts of it thereof, there’s no conversation to be had with you.
---
Rune mace?!?!?!? Heretic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RUNE SCIMMY IS THE ONLY RUNE WEAPON YOU SHOULD BE USING!
---
Nah, he knows it wont pass
---
I used to spam buying whip 1711k then swap it to 1171k in the trade window, I'd probably make 3m an hour and wouldnt get banned for about a week but by then I'd just get another account, membership was only a fiver back then and I could make well over 40m before I got banned.
---
Made about 300m over the summer holidays, good times.
---
No it's up u dumbass

Because of having drugs in it they removed it

People around me keep talking about "having a social life" yet they all seem to be miserable. 
---
I think my decision on not having social interactions is working out well for me.
---
no
---
what confounds my hooplehead is that I was able to play with the name for three days before being stripped of it
---
Yeah bruh might want to do a second take before you post the worst shotgun ever recorded.
---
These effects are much better and more balanced than the last iteration of this suggestion. I like it a lot, and I can especially see the earth tome being a switch for normal spellbook pkers with tome of fire.
---
Nieve thicc dayum
---
i cameback 4 years later like a week ago. so what are the 'other items' u are talking about
---
You will keep existing imbues, but all future imbues would be done through warding instead of nmz, if we choose to go that path. The way is is currently worded is, keep current imbues and future imbues will be through nmz or warding. Jmods think if they remove future imbues from nmz right now warding might fail because of it, but if it passes first they can get rid of imbueing through nmz later
---
About 250k/hr, which isn't great by most standards. Nats make around 500k-1m an hour depending on level. Bloods are about 600k/hr.
---
At 77 you would have a choice of bloods at 600k gp, 38k xp, or the minigame at 48k xp.
---
At 91, you could do nats at 1m gp 24k xp, souls at 250k gp, 48k xp.
---
I feel like it'd be a pretty fair alternative.
---
Jus get gud. Nah seriously just practice and you'll get it. Start with just using void, trident and rcb
---
I figured since you said you’re in IT that you wouldn’t fall for something like that but every couple days there’s a “Someone hacked me after I clicked on a ‘Woox is quitting’ stream” post
---
Q
---
What does flicking have to do with it? :l
---
bro! you're capping bro
---
What in the hell was that, was that beer hot?
---
To summarize: Fk warding. Let's vote no to any new skills.
---
&lt;3 It's allllll good lol, have a great day!
---
Slowest shotgun ever -10/10
---
I know it may not be the best advice but I just did this last weekend and now have 60kc.
---
I didn’t try the one rotation method. I had the helper tool open on my second monitor and just made sure to be in the right spot. Each time I died I made sure to learn from specifically what I did wrong, whether is was not clicking back in game first, not moving to my next position or what and improving next time. I know it might feel like you’re not making a lot of progress early on, but you’ll get it. 
---
Another bit of advice when looking at the helper tool, always look at where you need to be AND where you are going next. 
---
It can be helpful to move to where you need to be, then activate the correct prayer before updating your tool.
---
In the blue phase be more careful with your health because he likes to randomly throw out a bunch of ranged attacks too.
---
Leading into a jad phase top your health and prayer then focus exclusively on the prayer switches, this is actually the easiest part of the fight most of the time, and where you can really get a ton of damage in.
---
Don’t panic!
---
Me and my friend did it around 88-90 but having mid 90s would be ideal. Especially Range otherwise Olm takes 2 hours.
---
Aim for 90s (except prayer). I'd say no less than 80s
---
True. That is one goal I'm working on. But I'm having that feeling burnt out on bs slayer tasks issues. Theres only so many kelphite and black demons tasks I can do before going crazy. Skipping doesnt help mich either cause konar is a greedy bitch when it comes to nice profitable tasks
---
What is the use of a second pool? Am I missing something or is it literally to save a few seconds if you need to go in the other direction?
---
I just have my pool right next to my house portal, can't see any need to ever have a second one anywhere in the house, regardless of my layout.
---
&gt; it for illegitimate reasons
---
What "illegitimate reasons"? There's lots of valid reason to oppose a new skill to OSRS. So many negative implications and unexpected outcomes
---
effort?
---
That’s the thing, the Ammo slot isn’t really a consistent thing with blessings and the new incantations (if they pass). I’d be in favor of renaming the slot itself to like the backpack slot but that might ‘break nostalgia’ or some shit like that, but what I don’t like is the ammo slot being a catch-all for equipabbles that don’t fit in the rest of the slot. 
---
Inb4 people say it’s a slippery slope to auras
---
He didn't poke a big enough hole in the side
---
No
---
Well then someone may have been a little too sensitive and reported it. Unfortunate :/
---
you have both fang items nooooo
---
~550 and no fang...
---
whatcha gonna do with the mutagen
---
The dissolving thing worries me. I'd rather the new materials introduced another way. I dislike the fact that people hoarding tonnes of worthless items where items have been leaked could make billions.
---
Close to bis melee, range and mage sets, such as bandos, armadyl, ahrims/ansestrial and weapons to go along with them such as blowpipe, armadyl cbow, kodai or master wand, just basic pvm items for whatever you enjoy doing.
---
Some people use Melee for Ahrim, but I always used Ranged. You will be using Magic for the other 5 brothers, as they all have very low magic defense ratings. 
---
For your equipment, you might think this means you need to wear magic armor to increase your magic attack, but actually you are better off wearing more tanky gear, platelegs or d'hide legs, fighter torso, nezzy helm, etc. This will decrease your magic attack but due to how low the magic defense of the brothers is, it wont make much of a difference, if any.
---
Gz u beast. What’s next
---
Do you watch a show or YouTube while you play? RuneScape can be very afk’able. Find a long show on Netflix and just strap in and grind.
---
Oh wow didn't know you posted on a public forum known for criticizing stupid ideas. Thanks for the validation!
---
Back to fortnite with you!
---
Some people are simply fully against any implementation of a new skill which impacts the gameplay and jeopardizes the culture. I hope that it isn't pass a poll, honestly. 
---
Props for putting in effort and work, but as historical precedents shows, focusing on a new skill isn't ideal.
---
Definitely understand. I hate questing myself, but love the rewards. I'd pretty much not do a single quest for months and then just grind out like 10 in a day once I built up the motivation to do them. Just remember that it is just a game, you don't have to be doing stuff that you don't enjoy.
---
Yes I know, that's why I did that instead of clicking the link lmao
---
Gotcha. Thank you.
---
450Mish, mad it in half a year😎
---
How tf does the ge work? Doesn’t this mean no one had a single buy offer greater than 1gp in for the tome? I find that hard to believe
---
What if we want it tho lol
---
It wasn't so bad if you corner trick the whole way through. I shudder to think of what it would be like if you need to safespot your way through it.
---
Any reason why?
---
That crossbow is sexy as fuck.
---
shut the fuck up
---
You need the quest in order to receive it as a drop from the og 2006 monsters but to wield it there’s no req
---
I love dungeoneering, not as a skill though, just a minigame.
---
Or just leave things the way they are
---
That would be a good edit. Rune scim, mith dagger (p), rune 2h would be a pretty fun switch
---
Try out Slayer so you're not rocking sand crabs all the time. Even at low levels you can make better money than the whopping nothing from crabs.
---
You can quest a fair amount of Agility xp, or Barbarian fish for minute Agility xp. If you Barb fish to 99 Fishing, you'd be at 74 Agility. Full Graceful from rooftops should definitely be a goal, though.
---
Vary what you want to do in game. If you're tired of something, you can do something else.
---
RuneScape should just veto stealth sections forever. The game ticks make it impossible to feel good
---
no, this is called riging polls and that is not allowed.
---
It’s just a game, man. I don’t lose sleep over it. I just wanted to see if anyone else did this too. At least I’m not teaming up on people in wildy and flinging racist or homophobic insults at them when they can’t fight back.
---
I don't look forward to another buyable, but I do look forward to a new skill. However you don't HAVE to buy this one...if you want it to take the same time as RC haha. 
---
I love training skills and wavered back and forth on warding ever since it was first talked about. After reading that recent huge document and now this I can say I'll be voting yes.
---
Just to mention an example, as an ironman, i need to get 93 crafting to boost to 98 in order to make all zenyte jewelry which is bis offensive jewelry. It would take and inmense amount of hours to get that level so i have to settle for glory or fury, etc.
---
Well that’s just rude lol
---
Only noobs use nails when training construction.
---
Is this invention re skinned
---
screw warding will be voting no on 13 accounts
---
Vote whatever you feel is best on Warding.
---
I like that they’re untraceable because when noobs see my cballs they’re like: *what are thoooose*
---
“As a woman I have to question why it’s called last man standi-“ BEGONE THOT
---
best comment on this sub of the day.
---
Care to explain why you are voting no for Warding? Like actual reason.
---
No, polls need 75% support to pass, it barely fell short.
---
I think warding is great content and will be voting yes to everything, except maybe the skilling rings.
---
If you wanna raid then buy a lance for half that and it's twice as good lol
---
It's in the "advanced options" iirc, where you toggle roofs and shit
---
Sure, enjoy the proposed Tomes in the Warding Blog that do the same exact thing as the Tome of Fire but for weaker spells.
---
Judging by exactly what they said in the blog, it seems they are introducing the three new rune pouches, and we will still keep the current rune pouch (making 4 different types total).  The BH shop will change from the regular rune pouch to the wilderness pouch, so your current pouch will stay the same.
---
Why cant u guys just move on and come up with new content? It's obvious after 7 warding blogs most people don't want warding, so scrap the fucking idea and focus on something people actually want. Wasted $11 dev time
---
Precisely! Later in life you get to make your own mistakes, but as a child you need to learn why it *is* in fact a mistake.
---
holes too small
---
You should be fine as long as you didn’t click on any links in the stream or enter any information about your account.  Don’t know how you’d get hacked from just entering the steam
---
And 4 bonds
---
Take a break from the game if you don’t like 0s man.
---
that is super unfortunate lmfao
---
I've never played RS3. I played RS2 until eoc then quit.
---
Start an ironman?
---
Is this about change?
---
i cant watch a movie :( i always get sucked in to the plot and lose xp/h as a result
---
maybe im just not good at aerial fishing but it felt like you could speed it up by a lot if you went for the closest spawns. had to do like 1-2 clicks every second. stark contrast to woodcutting or barbarian fishing
---
I've been on break for almost a year.  The game is unplayable to me because I just dont have the same time, and my time is wasted because grinding like that just isnt enjoyable anymore.
---
H
---
Bought 100 thinking the same thing, I'm somehow down to 20 in my bank. I have absolutely no idea where I've used that many.
---
Y'know what I'm glad they removed it but it'd kinda be cool to see what they would be like in-game. I want to see it, but I don't want it ever being added to the game permanetly. because that shit sounded broken.
---
What are your thoughts on a low lvl ranged pure ( 65 ranged , like real low ) using rune knives into Ballista and d throwing axe spec?
---
After an hour or so you start to see the patterns. Fuck that quest.
---
Playing with fire 2
---
LMS has been an awful experience for me. This sub has praised it for being an into into PvP, but it's not when 90% of the people playing are PKers. Of course I have no chance, can't even learn what to do. Just get stacked by someone who only plays PvP.
---
I'm sure it's great for PvPers, but its definitely not a jumping off point for noobs.
---
Just to make it easier to see
---
Solution: never use the bank
---
Is it ?
---
Normal Spellbook has entangle, but Ancients has Ice Barrage which is the literal center of the Magic meta. The lack of Teleblock is never an issue already for people who use Ancients to PK.
---
None of the spells I've proposed are stronger than a Fire Spell under Tome of Fire, in terms of DPS. None of them. They just have different utilities, like faster switch speed, piercing (only 25% chance), etc.
---
But we're talking about long quests here, not ones that take 20 minutes.
---
Yeah i agree. Dominion Tower's climber mode was actually interesting with all the handicaps rolling in. NMZ endurance is nothing compared to that mode. NMZ is just absoption potion simulator, no skill is needed
---
Dungeoneering was awesome would rather have it as a minigame than a skill tho.
---
I’d rather see it reworked into our existing dead content skills that’s only purpose is to serve as a max requirement
---
Im not sure, i dont usually wear a sara cloak, but the rest of the stuff looks like mine
---
C
---
I’ll do this when I get on this afternoon, thank you!
---
he's saying gold ore at BF is &gt;300k/hr
---
Love this! Does anyone know where to read the whole quest storyline in one go? The wiki only provides a list of the quest line and the dialogue, I thought it would be nice to read the whole story in one go.
---
sora is about to unlock that keyhole in the crossbow
---
Warding is still a walmart version of disenchanting from World of Warcraft. The Enchants/rewards don't seem worth it imo. I actually like how disenchanting/enchanting works in wow but this just seems like a watered down version of it.
---
I went from 41-60 smithing yesterday w/ gauntlets and averaged probably 270-280k an hour. And thats including having to stop to pay the foreman every 10 mins and while watching Netflix. So its not super try hard to 250k+
---
Normally irrelevant for ironmen, anyway. Ironmen are sometimes gold-limited, :P.
---
idd say about 24 now that the calulatios based off havent done anything concreate in turms of kills per hour but ive noticed the averge time has droped slightly thats just me looking at the times at the end think ive only reached jad phase once using them when there would be 2 or 3 times ish when not take that with a grain of salt thou
---
Its not about sympathy or the 67m loss its about disconnecting while trying to PVP
---
We’ll never get a new skill with the vote needing 75%
---
facts
---
warding gay
---
once again. max efficiency x rates do not consider gp made.
---
You don't enjoy DS1?
---
Do I need to buy extra pants for this?
---
my guy your kc is so low for how filled your log is, you could go 500kc dry of boots and it’d be okay.
---
I just connected with Bell in Toronto.
---
hate speech isnt real
---
doesnt have a barrage timer
---
Just came back from a 3 month break and feel super refreshed!
---
But you can’t even reach it. 
---
Maybe they liked the look and just reused the ones used for traversing through the forest?
---
Replied to the wrong comment there?
---
Yes only time i will i get sooooo annoyed seeing hop in chat box before i can even see the game like shut up and kill your crap
---
just like dont stake....
---
 all jokes aside, take everyone elses advice and make an ironman.
---
I always felt like i was cheating using quest guides back then. Good times.
---
I just think easily accessible +10% DPS increase from slayer helm is a little much coming from lvl 30 warding equipment. I'm hoping mage robes use an ingredient that's rarely dropped from some mid-high level mob which is used in warding to create robes
---
Ash should be living in wealth, the things he have done for our childhood game, and ultimately for our childhood is awesome! He's an artist! different kind of, the 21st century artist, a game developer! infact all of the devs should get a raise!
---
super annoying...
---
That's such a poor interpretation of what he's saying.  He is asking, since they put effort into this, for people to keep an open mind and just read the blog instead of simply saying " no, me no want new skill, me no care what you say".  And there have been dozens of people on Reddit and Twitter who have that exact stance.
---
All the client addons are also super private servery and yet they are very popular.
---
&gt; Utterly bizarre they were pitched
---

&gt; very sadly out of touch

&gt; Can't remember exactly what they are [. . .]

:thinking:
---
The nostalgia of this game ends after 2 months of playing it. The release of osrs proves that when the game was literally dying after the first few months of release because there was no new/end game content.
---
Wish I had known when I was pickpocketing to do Death to the Dorgeshuun last night! Will be good in future for easy clues tho
---
Its cool its a theme people not seeing the level 99 :)
---
St0nks
---
No. Its 4m because its 2 of two crossbows that has a spec bar, its rare enough, and its one of 3 bow that can fire dragon type bolts. If it lost any of those 3 traits, it would be 500k.
---
yeah bro, the account is trashed, gotta get 99 cooking again
---
Thanks for informing me respectfully about a 4 year old post regarding something that even jmods believed. I’ll be sure not to spread my misinformation in the future
---
Interesting ideas, although the power levels would need some fine tuning
---
You mean you don’t drink from the hole you make? Where do you drink from??
---
&lt;3
---
True love
---
Ahhhh fuck luckily I’m f2p
---
Guess they just used it as decoration
---
It's understandable, they have a runecraft flair
---
Lawlzzz😁
---
I remember I used to be terrified of doing any quests which required me to kill enemies that were a higher level than me lol.
---
... man who hurt you?
---
Enhanced gameplay
---
Legfs
---
You say that like it's a bad thing.
---
well ever since i returned to osrs i mentioned to clan mates that there should be smithing but for magic gear. that was almost 2 years ago and im sure im not the only one.
---
also they listened to the players when they voted no to each of your examples.
---
 Have timers up for minion spawns.
---
Idk, I’m new to tribriding and I’m doing relatively well
---
It looks like they will be removing the normal Rune Pouch from the Bounty Hunter store and adding a new pouch to the store in its place.
---
Have it be a reward for opening the brimstone chest 150 times or something, after that point Konar is like "yo dip your pizza into the vent"
---
When only one hard to kill monster drops it I can see it’s price being huge like the dragon warhammer and dragon full helm.
---
Not a chance.
---
Pkers absolutely do not want the shield to pass as ely and dinhs are the cancer of pvp. The main reason it didnt pass was because its more powerful than ely tho honestly in 07 pvm meta, its worse.
---
yea, I have been lurking for even longer but now that warding is so close i cant help but join the conversation.
---
Lmao suqah nutty xp, dust devils are 120k slay xph, nechryaels 125k, smoke devils 180k+
---
thats why I stopped :/
---
I did not say they were "good" money. Though after looking in to it they are less than I initially though about commenting that. Apparently they'er 200k/hr which I believe is worse than the boss already. So everything's "fit" I suppose.
---
My mistake on overestimating their value.
---
Congrats you win the autist of the day award
---
Well if you just explained it that way from the beginning I'm sure all of us would be shotgun experts
---
he loves shittalking people and the jmods, so now hes sucking weath's cock so hard for a shorter punishment
---
actually stupid
---
holy fuck that truly is a smackdown
---
Yeah it would drop to 500k if it didn’t have a spec bar 😂 coz every1 who buys the dcb does it to 1t spec weapons
---
I would say maybe switch out the Warrior's ring for either a brimstone ring, archer's ring (i) or berserker ring (i).
---
gear I used was blessed dhide, fury, granite ring, toxic blowpipe (makes a huge diff in time to kill).. 4 range pots, 8 saras, 16 supers, still had a few pots left.. 
---
it's all practice. The higher your range the better, I had 87-88 this weekend and the ranger mobs got melted as soon as they appeared. Just takes some practice, like the title says... 8 attempts haha
---
Aren't you in framed CC a lot?
---
Yeah Ned makes his by hand, highly recommend Draynor.
---
Now reliving these days with my Ultimate Ironman, and I must to say that I feel just as nervous as back then!
---
Grays!
---
Kq cave?
---
Why does mod archie look like a 30 year old man who smokes .2g spliffs and drinks sparx all day?
---
Because the handholds are rng. My friend spent 1 hour and 45mins on it alone while i spent 5mins. Its not fun failing an agility obstacle for an hour.
---
the beard
---
I simply don’t want new skills, it’s a no from me.
---
smart thinking, yeah I'm 61 slayer right now.. got tired of ranging everything and now it's melee time!
---
Can't you see the serious in my eyes boy?
---
You could balance a God damn wine glass on dat ass
---
Crossbow: ~3h
---
Shield: 1h 20min
---
Boots: 2h~  
---
  
---
Mind you that this factors in all the long stretches of head scratching and staring at the screen looking at WIPs before I went "not feeling it, how about scrapping half the model and turning it into something completely different".
---
It has to be, who gets 120k per 1 and a half hours lol.
---
so you want a korasi but changed to be not like the original korasi so why not ask for a new weapon that isnt a korasi and has a new game model? and please dont weasel the bulwark into your arguement like the two other fellas that left their opinions in the comments.
---
Yeah man I love nostalgic content like Zulrah, ToB, Cerberus, Kebos Lowlands, and Dragon Slayer II.
---
Not trying to be an ass but the point is that a lot of BiS gear, high-level content, popular quests, and enjoyable activities come from new “non-nostalgic” updates. Most of these in some way have largely impacted economy and gameplay and I’d consider adding new tiers and BiS items are a “large change.”
---
I’m not saying to blindly support warding, but to preemptively decide that any new skill is automatically bad because it’s not OG OSRS isn’t productive. Now, if you hate all of the aforementioned content, that’s fair and you’re entitled to that opinion.
---
TL;DR you don’t have to blindly support new updates but new content =/= bad content
---
If you are worried about maxed accounts voting no, maxed accounts make up an extremely small amount of players, and only a small amount of those players probably feel this way.
---
Doesn't matter. People who want to pvm can pvm. Lot of people just leveling up.account. join and see if you like the cc.
---
Go read the stickied thread. Way more support than not. Did you read reactions when it was first proposed and nothing since then?
---
It doesn't matter that you don't use it? Runelite is just better at it.
---
Why did you hold the can sideways? Do you have arthritis from clicking those sharks?
---
Yea go back to PVM you trash
---
Yeah I was gonna say, that botting ban was probably for the botting that he did.
---
No, we don't need anything else from rs3.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blast_Furnace

Gold is 5700-6000 bars/hour at a "casual" rate. Can still go significantly higher than that though. I have no idea where you pulled 4500/hour from.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Voting yes because of the armor and rewards it could add to the game makes no sense. All of those things could be put into the game via a quest or minigame.
---
They don't need to add a skill to fix these problems they just need to refine what's there.
---
The skill should be approved based off the gameplay it would provide. Something they aren't talking much about because it's just another smithing-esque creation skill that won't be unique and will just be a different aesthetic on another skill.
---
How come? The main differences compared to Barrows gloves are:
---
* The prayer bonus (which IMO is offset by the much lower offensive bonuses);
---
* The crystal effect (which IMO is offset by the requirements).
---
The buff to crystal halberd makes it a better "pure DPS" spec weapon than dragon claws, which is more than normal considering the hard diaries + grandmaster quest + glove slot requirement. The buff to crystal bow makes it relevant again, while remaining weaker than a blowpipe in every scenario except PvP. The buff to the crystal shield is significant, but considering its negative offensive bonuses, I don't see it used *that often* - when is extremely high ranged defense useful, apart from fights with the Kalphite Queen or General Graardor?
---
i remember when i got 99 strength i went into the wild and asked random people if i could get the level on them. several told me no, but one guy said yes and even had a Flash2:Grats on 99! ready. i’ll never forget that moment.
---
Ooh! What about some enhance jewelry chants that give certain bonuses to pieces of jewelry? Or a chant that lets you deal damage to slayer monsters called Mystic Needle - it would require holding a weapon called the Slayer Stick to perform it correctly.
---
That is a fair argument about the underground pass and I appreciate the "to each his own" mindset.
---
I'm down for them making RC more interesting. Heck, make it the same xp/hr as current methods but more fun. Though it will be a low amount the minigame they'er offering with warding sounds great.
---
Didn't think of it this way, never really looked at mage gear tbh. But it makes sence.
---
I know man, I just noticed someone else posting about their WT kc and I felt like sharing. Just a lil joke I know I've been extremely lucky. Probably the RNG for the whole account :P
---
There's no question about that, the concern is whether or not they'll be replacing the functionality of the rune pouches that players already own with the one that goes into the bounty hunter store. It'd be pretty unfair, but this is the same Jagex that rolls back the entire server because some people picked up a really questionable spawn in the middle of nowhere but didn't roll back a damn thing after the Fally Massacre, so "fair" is something of a nebulous term.
---
Those don't make you a jack of all trades. Those are just concepts of society.
---
Impressive. May I ask where you got the reference character? Is it ripped from the game or is it something you made yourself? Been looking for a character file myself in order to make custom stuff for fun.
---
Where did i say that? It doesnt matter if everyone buys it for that reason. If 5% use it for that, and it got removed tomorrow,  it will have a dramatic affect on supply/demand and the crossbow would be 500k.
---
i dont understand how some people think this skill doesnt fit but simultaneously want something as preposterous as “sailing”
---
Sailing is cool and all but in a game like runescape?? Sounds like itd be a clunky mess that would hardly even pass as a fun mini game.
---
Warding doesnt sound super exciting but it fills a gap and opens new doors. At worst its a smithing/crafting clone but i dont see anything really wrong with that.
---
omg when i ordered this i got some sign language poster instead and then followed the most grueling three weeks of waiting my little 3rd grade self did have
---
Legit picked and spun flax for days on end to make my money. 
---
I remember one day though a guy died from poison after teleporting to canny from the wildy. Dies, loses his bandos gods word and I looted it up! This was back when they were 50m or so. Went from spinning flax to selling a bgs and having 50m , never ever ever forget that! 
---
Then I it lucky once and got a draconian visage off either a iron dragon, sold it for about 25m oh those were the Days!!
---
&gt;Question: I am confused with how to melee set. So i can only do it WHEN olm special + facing mage side? I cant do it when olm face mage side ?
---
If olm attacks the melee side and then does a special attack immediately after, it is melee set. That means it is the melee guy's job to evacuate his side after the attack to skip the special. 
---
If olm attacks the mage side and then does a special attack immediately after, it is mage set. That means it is the mage guy's job to evacuate his side after the attack to skip the special.
---
He actually thought he got a free pass to bot again because his macroing ban from a year ago expired (not quashed). Glad scummy people like that are being caught especially botting for exp compared to trying to get stats to pk or whatever
---
Now you just need to fix the coif
---
And it was as easy as a homemade meal
---
Why would you not put gold in the coffer to not have to pay the foreman?
---
Time to cash out on those Splitbark Tops I've been collecting
---
Yes. Also, it's often more worthwhile to invest your money in stats or permanent upgrades (e.g. POH. Even though you need quite a bit of money until you get the REALLY good stuff in your POH) rather than invest in gear. You'll make the money back more quickly that way.
---
Specific number lol
---
This guy is ahead of his time
---
Nice, I'm gonna try it myself tonight for the first time, maybe I'll have it by next week? We'll see!
---
Oh okay, all the new skills in animescape are fantastic and totally fit the original game that was actually successful in its first and second run a decade apart. Right. Thats why the player count didnt get absolutely buttfucked after 2007, right?
---
And someone fucking lame enough to max is going to "care" about needing to level 1 more skill?
---
Why did I upvote this.
---
With a hook, yes. A harpoon is used to stab the fish.
---
Absolute tunes!
---
Gonna post this here for mods to see later
---
Smithing:
---
fast and expensive- gold
---
half as fast and half as expensive- platebodies
---
medium and profit - blast furnance bars
---
slow and afk- cannonballs/darts
---
level 99 afk and profit - rune 2h
---
Crafting:
---
fast and expensive - black d'hide bodies
---
2/3rd fast and half as expensive - air battlestaffs
---
afk and profit/break even - glassblowing
---
The shotguns in these 99 vids are terrible. If only I were good enough at the game to get 99
---
Prif will become available with song of elves. Next grandmaster quest will have to do with menaphos
---
Be rank 10 Ironman
---
Bot
---
Get banned
---
Profit?
---
I thought he said attack. But if my max hit calculator is right. He could only max a 6 with 1 strength with a rapier so he clearly would do strength first.
---
Highly impressed with the first 99, however I’m highly disappointed with the effort of that shotgun. But either either way, gratz guy
---
How far along are you?
---
On my way. Meet lummy?
---
Chaotics took a weekend to get. As you said it had retarded xp rates. It’s probably the best skill out there because it’s the only one that required *skill*. You were probably just a lazy 12 year old when it was released.
---
Bring back the sailing poll. No way this skill will pass 75%
---
No stacked items, unless your talking about skilling/pvm drops. But currently I got 99 crafting banked at 45K battle staffs
---
Those twitter replies are also the definition of echo chamber... And if you spend any time on twitter you will recognize many of those names as people who cry about every update.
---
Me too lmao, if you broke a hole in the side and tried to pop the top and drink out of it then you'd spill it all over yourself/the floor.

---
dungeoneering is great though and would be amazing in OSRS. summoning is a great skill idea that if implemented differently could also be great in OSRS. both those skills existed before what we consider RS3.
---
free rank bois
---
I was wrong, i thought using the rapier and such allowed you to hit 12s and 13s much faster. Which is better xp.
---
Apparently 1 strength with a rapier is like 4 damage so it would not be faster at all i was wrong
---
&gt; Those twitter replies are also the definition of echo chamber
---
How do you think this?
---
He can use stats after they are 99.. So once he got 99 range and mage he can use them to train defence
---
Nobody did that. You’d post up at the obelisk for as long as you had charms. It was like 700k xo per hour doing that.
---
Probably was not his first offense, who knows how much he bottled to arrive at rank 10
---
I'll have to remember this. I've got 5 slayer levels before I can do MM2, and the quest just looks awful. I'll take anything I can to make it easier.
---
Just that one and DS2 (and SOTE) and I've got my first ever cape of accomplishment.
---
It’s certainly not a good thing. This game will eventually die out one day because of the community and not jagex at this rate.
---
There's a limited amount of resources Jagex has to work on OSRS. If resources are going to Warding, they aren't going elsewhere.
---
🤔
---
Did you realize you posted this 4 times?

Thank you hydra! Very cool!

It’s a beer warmed up in the oven for the 99 cooking tho... warm beers are so hard to chug
---
*insert spider man pointing at himself*
---
Use a torso and god dhide chaps for melee. Bring a god dhide body to switch to for range. Probably worth it to use your best offensive prayers for each style if you can handle doing gear and prayer switches. Spend your cash on an anguish and torture if possible. They are massive upgrades for all range and melee setups in the game

Many of them are literally the same thing "no one wants this" or "it is time to stop"... Isn't it also the definition of "circlejerk" when it is always the same people that you see at the top calling new updates bad?
---
This is mostly a ridiculous post but the one thing I want to comment on is that the price graphs are always wrong. This has always frustrated me to no end. The estimates in game are wrong, the official ge page is wrong, OS buddy is wrong, and the ge tracker application is wrong. The only way to get an accurate reading is to check margins yourself, but these are also in constant flux so there's no way to know based on today's data what prices will be like later this week.

That's the only reason it might pass

60 attack piety is hella fun. You’re still at the zerker bracket and claws are op.
---
How so, do you mean the cut scenes or other on-boat related instances? The most engaged sailing part of any quest i can think of is  Cabin Fever.
---
The whole point of this game is that it's classic RS, I don't want any fundamental changes to the base game.
---
Your sister is four years old?
---
Sometimes, you just have to know when to cut your losses. In this case, at -99.99%

I suppose it could be a way to introduce like t80 or t85 weapons but would have to be expensive or maybe degradable at a high cost to repair otherwise it would kill t bow rapier scythe prices

Does anyone have a mostly PvM clan I can join. I have decent stats, but am still working on them. Currently Level  117
---
Of all beers to celebrate a 99.. and you choose a Miller Banquet.. Gratz on the 99 tho lol
---
Obviously they could limit where it goes. Corp for example would eat any summons and heal off of it. Inferno doesn’t allow sweets probably not summoning either as familiars weren’t allowed in fight caves either. The game has to progress and that’s what happened. Every update after summoning was balanced around summoning e.g. fight kiln. Gl doing nex on release without a familiar. Summoning was also a massive gp and item sink.
---
Then it's viable. :) GP has higher value in f2p.
---
I hope it's going to be as fun and hopefully social as the divination update on rs3, else this is gonna be just another time-sink added to the game.
---
You're buying the mats from other players/ bots though, the gold doesn't disappear

Stop pretending like skills are voluntary. They are compulsory.

It sounds like someone might've breached your email account. Do you have 2FA on your email as well?

Any untradable item you keep with you on death
---
if its tradable and not the 3 most expensive items you have, then they fall to the floor in that world only and you get 1 hour to pick them up.
---
After the 1 hour is up they disappear forever.
---
Can't wait to get 90 so I can make a Wroth Incantation
---
I really liked it as a skill even though it was a traditional skill in any sense. idk, I just liked it being part of the other skills. I wish they could alter the skill to be a skill more than alter it to make it a better mini game.
---
Autoalchemy is an epidemic.
---
Vorkath + Raids + Zulrah + new quests all changed the game more than a new skill would.
---
thats because you dont just stab the side of the can while its horizontal, you hold it upside down and tilt it at an 75/80 so the air pocket is in the corner. Then when you puncture the can nothing comes out but air

i remember the days of obby cape/black cape switching. the sad thing is people still fall for these phishing scams

I've always thought true multi-class armors would be neat. Something weaker than other similar tier gear, but not having the normal negative bonuses.
---
* Melee + Magic
---
* Magic + Range
---
* Range + Melee
---
These could be useful for people who are bad at switches or for saving inventory space.
---
Sounds like you have VPN going on.
---
Because it will give something else to buy with emblems which benefits PvP. I still think the gargoyle boss def needs something.
---
Discussing warding is a lost cause since actual feedback is downvoted into oblivion for more or less no reason at all and twitter isn't conductive for anything other than shitposting.
---
I understand that. I personally think 2011 was past the point of return for runescape. But I started in classic so my favorite time of runescape was 2004-2009.

Oh no

Warding isnt old school so it can GTFOH
---
Tbh I don’t even use them I just know they are good for training until you can burst/barrage
---
If they wanna funnel some of their 12m/h ToB cash my way for gathering materials I'm all about it
---
That is how every update works. If ToB Failed and the Rapier passed, they wouldn't just slap the Rapier ingame; it is dependent on the main content. That said, many reward ideas from failed updates, especailly skills, found their way into other updates later on like Redwood, Zenyte, and such. So even if Warding fails, I doubt all those new robes and such will be dropped completely; they are just not offering them right away as standalone content.
---
Glad you own up to it at least.
---
Can you tell me if you did goldfarming on it? I think its likely that it will warrant a perm ban on first offence if you did that. And when I say goldfarming I mean anything that makes money really.
---
Honestly this is what I love about osrs bossing, a lot of bosses force you to learn the mechanics behind the scenes to be proficient. I.e. Jad has like a 7tick prayer change with 100% negated by having the correct prayer on, so it teaches you the benefit of correctly praying at the right time. The inferno teaches you how to flick between prayers in a much tighter cycle and how to prioritize mobs. Chambers teaches you how to follow a boss cycle and react accordingly, and ToB teaches you pathing among other things. That's why you get that feeling that you've really done something special once you complete/become proficient at bossing. You've just learned a little bit more about the games mechanics.

They should update that section into, replacing "minigames" into more realistic descriptions.

Have you been using an acb or tbow? I dont have any advice but I've been making attempts with the acb and it just seems too slow. I can make it to zuk with ample supplies but I feel like the fight is just taking too long. I'm thinking that I might have to just wait until I get a tbow to go back.

Expired bans affect other bans, quashed bans don't.

It does hit the spot on both games though, got to give you that

How do you think he got max in the first place? A shit ton of botting

Possible if there is no in others offers inbetween yeah. The item is getting sold/bought like 120 p/day so kinda unlikely. But could still happen.

I hope OP flipped the item for some good profit before he uploaded the photo.

2019 has already been the year of the pedophile, I don't want people to start calling this the Pedo Robes.

You mentioned you stoppee after EoC... are you sure you are in the right sub. OSRS isnt the same game
---
I dont believe this is necessarily true, we need statistics before we call for gold sinks, sinks for sinks sake isn’t healthy, we need a strong balance between gold entering and gold leaving.
---
Equally, item sinks probably would not result in inflation, since those items are being deconstructed and not alched, it would actually lead more likely to currency deflation as items are more in demand and less currency around.
---
I really feel we need to avoid default assuming gp sinks are good, when a healthy economy requires stability
---
he "liked" playing Runescape. he has disappeared off the face of the planed ever since maxing. he also made it clear to other people that he was tired, and the only thing keeping him going was since he had already invested so much time into his account.
---
A band-aid fix, but I'll take it.
---
They said there will be at least 1 beta available to all players.
---
Well it's not really fair that Magic is supposed to be strong against Melee on the combat triangle but hardly ever has any melee defence bonuses. Besides, notice the +0 ranged defence bonus.
---
I want this to pass so bad.
---
Jagex, even if this doesn't, a lot of us still really appreciate the effort you put into this game. It's a shame a few stalwarts will probably ruin the fun.
---
I believe they came to the conclusion that around 6-month bans are the most effective.
---
i doubt they are going to unban him or even make a statement on the situation and everyone will forget about it in a week.
---
Man... I got banned for catching shrimps. I did that because when osrs started you couldn't trade before 24 hours playtime. I only started playing because a friend of mine wanted to give me some starters cash and I cba playing 24h on a fresh lvl 3 from scratch. That lvl 3 that got banned after like 800shrimps was a maxed acc on RS3. Man... that was harsh... JaGeX got me into botting... I didn't want to. Kinda Left me no choice.

Pushing body parts through razor thin aluminum while drinking sounds like a good way to get stitches.

Ya man same could said for like rune dragons.

They look nice, but the crossbow makes 0 sense\~ as the bolt sits in the middle of the crossbow, the O part needs adjusting- as that actually blocks the bolt at the moment (this is me being nitpicky), if the bolt sat in the middle of the O, it wouldn't align with the back part of the crossbow- the boots look great, i love them (finally a pair of boots without wings on them!)- the shield is, although matching the set, looks HELLA ugly, i feel like you could have done a lot more with it, without making it over-complicated\~ but as a whole, the outfit actually looks great.
---
Zul’rah is way harder than Vorkath

i botted some dung in like 2010 on RS3

I wish I could get my name back though :/

Yeah they can look at the ip and see the proxy or vpn you used just fine

It has been months, certainly all the lasagna since then has recharged his resolve.

Is this poll going to go live in 20 hours just like the MTX poll?
---
Find a PVM clan and join it.  You can find clan applications on the RS forums.  Most PVM clans are happy to help teach players new bosses / raids.

This. The wildy isnt that dangerous for UIM, just suicide and you have an hour to mess around risk free.

I was this but a couple months before mobile came out... then mobile came out, now the true 99 grinds happen daily.

Open source means you can see the source code and compile it yourself if you wanted to.
---
there is no malicious code in RL+, but there are some plugins that seem OP.
---
I would stay away, or try it, it's your call.
---
I would like to use the granite hammer but I don’t have enough gp. Do you have any recommendations on how to make money?
---
Because the Warding release is basically a "who can get 200m exp without dying from sleep deprivation" contest.
---
yeah names get removed after a long time of inactivity. maybe the person who got the name got banned. since banned accounts dont get their names released. also to be sure did you check the rs3 highscores? or were you searching ingame?
---
I'll have to give a hard no for at least two reasons.
---
1. That wouldn't be inline with the others
---
2. Would be too random, and doesn't make sense.
---
I feel like Warding would be able to allow for the strengthening of the Magic skill overall, bringing it more in line with Range since Range is so overpowered at the moment?
---
Oh I'm sorry, I forgot that the new skill needs to cater to your specific brand of playing. Sometimes it's nice to bank stand. I guarantee there are people that are excited for this skill. As for it being boring, I dont remember anything about beta testing Warding, so I'm impressed that you've already gotten bored with a skill you've never done.
---
You mean the skill trained exclusively through a minigame played every 8 hours?
---
Honestly I feel like in this case if the vote for warding is close to passing but not quite, it should be passed anyways. People voting no out of spite or on principle of not wanting the game to change are just harming the game for everyone else, where as if it passes they can just not participate.
---
Not for awhile. There hasnt been much word in terms of development
---
How much warding exp/hr is correcting a shitpost?
---
99 dating? I doubt it bro, don't lie.
---
More like level 9.
---
Imagine being a pathetic little man who cares how other people enjoy the game
---
They just won't add it instantly and add it elsewhere. No point wasting a good idea.
---
That was the plan for partnerships, also. They wanted a backlog of shit to add, so throwing away perfectly well received content to add to the game when they constantly say they lack rewards is a pretty silly plan.
---
did you read the new blog, because the changes are actually quite good imo.
---
What gloves?
---
It goes straight from what you have to bandos. Primordial boots, serp helm, ferocious gloves.
---
They devalued my 4 hour grind for all imbues grrrrr &gt;:(
---
Yeah when I made a few alt accounts I found a few things way easier which I might have disagreed with if polled but passed and really liked. I now feel keeping things hard is stupid but there are exceptions. For example I dislike how nmz is the best melee combat xp in the game.
---
Yeah they've said more bank space requires engine work.
---
Seriously, you call yourself a professional company? You charge people $100 a year to play and you cannot even implement basic password security! People should be required to have special characters in their passwords not forbid them.
---
I really hope your encryption is up to standards, because with the whole mod Jeb debacle I really fear it is running on old technology like md5, or worse, plaintext.

Guess hunter2 it is for now.

expressing a non-reddit hivemind approved™️ opinion? bold move.
---
Updated blog good! Swampman still better
---
Bandos is not end game armor. It is a good nondegradeable armor along with armadyl. I would reccomend those.
---
I’d recommend herb runs, it’s super easy and you can focus on other things while you wait for the herbs to grow
---
Sure I can. I’m just worried that the thing that I don’t want to happen will in fact happen.
---
I will start weaving the cape, I await your return
---
They started perma banning for first offense because people would think this way
---
You'll see it all the time "I though first offense was supposed to be 2 weeks" - people who thought they'd just auto click 99 magic and stop.
---
Hey congrats on the 99!! Sorry everyones being a flaming dickhead about your achievement. Keep goin and keep shotgunnin those beers bruther
---
Gz beast
---
A lot of people in my clan chat are against it as well and I still haven't seen a good argument against it. The best I hear is "they could just add it to runecrafting instead". Well yea they could, and they have in the past. But it's just shoehorned in and doesn't actually belong. We can't keep doing that forever.
---
You mean the new warding minigame?
---
Most likely not, only thing to do is restart another account and take account security seriously. Did stronghold of security teach you nothing?
---
Always add 2fa and bank pin right away
---
Thieving is hard because he's got to steal the beer
---
That's not how gold sinks work
---
I’ll never understand the “this isn’t old school” argument trotted out in a game that has so much new content, if you want to play true legacy cool, but most people don’t.
---
Fuck. I dont want to vote yes, but for the good of the game i have yo. Damn you jagex
---
So?
---
Yeah, his bot is great
---
Every element of warding can fit perfectly well in existing skills.
---
The skill offers absolutely nothing to the game other than a barrier of entry to new content that Jagex will strong arm people into voting Yes.
---
Im glad Wow Classic will kill this game
---
Hmm wonder what you’ll do for 99 herblore
---
You need to secure your account first. Then make an appeal. If you get it unbanned they will just bot it again. 
---
Put on 2FA
---
Bank pin ASAP
---
PUT 2FA ON YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT
---
Change all related passwords.
---
I agree with you in general, although I think your Smithing example isn't a great one; it's another skill that could use some updates. Maxing Smithing gets you.... the ability to make T40 gear that is just alch fodder?  
---
High Crafting lets you make top-tier rings/amulets/etc. High Herblore gets very useful potions. High Fletching lets you make the game's best ammo. 
---
There's definitely existing skills in the game that could use some improvements, and I'm not 100% convinced that these improvements shouldn't be tacked onto Runecrafting, alongside some gear rebalancing.
---
You know hunter meta is get to 27 asap, then red salamanders, and chins and imps for money or continue red for xp. Sure we have a lot to hunt but we all hunt a small portion of what we can.
---
yeah, it sucks. I didn't do it and will continue to have not done it while I use better equipment.
---
Lamo yeah go to a debate with that strategy and see how far you get, retard
---
Get good??????????????
---
Super idea, but not what happens, which is why first time soft bans aren’t punishing and many players choose to do this
---
Adamant, but working towards barrows.
---
I am playing OSRS, my account is the same though. I love 2007 runescape compared to the MTX trash,
---
Literally just map the shoulder buttons and face buttons to open specific menus (maybe remappable?) and make the left joystick control the camera. 
---
Everything else can be touch screen.
---
And all the asshats on this sub will upvote it and call Jagex out for wrongfully banning him... bunch of dumbasses on here
---
Name checks out lol
---
The problem with Reddit is anything outside of the circlejerk gets downvoted into Oblivion
---
On Twitter anyone can say anything and it won't get filtered out(unless it's something really bad)
---
Sure mob mentality is still a thing, but atleast you have a chance to say your mind there. On Reddit most people are just going to judge how the threads going and comment based on what will get them upvotes.
---
You can be mass downvoted in one thread then move to another thread in the same sub and be upvoted like crazy. Neither Twitter nor Reddit foster healthy discussion at all
---
Sweet. Not very familiar with either but good stuff.
---
You’re looking really good for your current stats — and holy shit 40m cash too? What do you do? I’m 106 combat and have 2m cash. 
---
Your gear is pretty much at its peak. There are a few pieces you could buy but it would be just about your whole cash stack. Although you didn’t mention a ring so berserkers ring and archers ring could be purchased
---
Is Conjuring still apart of the skill, if so that's a No.
---
im voting yes on it, just because its going to open up a lot more quests for pures and will be able to do some super cool new builds !
---
Does your fiancé know about your low IQ?
---
Uhh, dont see how but okay.
---
Type ::renderself in the chat and you will disappear on your screen so you can see if anyone logs in underneath you. Also, if you use Runelite, enable usernames to show up for player on screen and on minimal so it’s obvious when someone logs in too.
---
Get vis, use on material, train skill.
---
Not overwhelming
---
Yea... As an ex-RS3 player I can just say 1 thing. It took them 6 YEARS to do the mining and smithing rework on RS3. So you can double that time with OSRS seeing it wikl never pass polling
---
For the steroid thing, there are very specific tests in every bodybuilding competition for illegal substances. Anything not on that list, including most anabolic steroids, is allowed. What's not allowed are even more dangerous substances like diuretics to reduce water weight to get a more ripped look. While anabolic steroids are dangerous because it massively increases your risk of heart diseases, abusing diuretics is much more dangerous, which is why it's banned.
---
A similar thing happens in strongman competitions. There is drug testing, but not for anabolic steroids. Instead, they test for other substances, like stimulants.
---
It's part of the sports. Everybody is competing on a level playing field because all the competitors use steroids. If they suddenly was banned, you'd have to be incredibly accurate in detecting the steroids. Otherwise, you'd get a much less even playing field between the athletes who would take the risk and the rest who don't. It would ruin the sport if not done properly.
---
Is Conjuring Still apart of the Skill, please say no.
---
Like when goku tells ssj2 teen gohan that he wasnt “half as strong at his age”
---
Lol naaah. I’m not like these virgins who get their account haxed because they use the same email and username on everything.
---
The gmaul is still 50 atk with the attachment bro. Ur acc is set up to use ahrims and karils and arcane. An extra 1-4m risk isnt gunna be the breaking point. 
---
Also u wrecked pures because ur 10 levels higher than them. Literally any balanced account at 99 would wreck pures.
---
RS3 Mobile.
---
Also theres 3 engine devs for both rs3 and osrs, their backlog of work is like 2-3years lol.
---
Considering there isn’t a policy for shorter bans for first offense macroing major, it doesn’t really matter if it was a first offense or not.
---
So what if he considers only max efficiency? That doesn't stop me for telling my thoughts what makes Temple Spiders better. If you don't give a damn about gaining cash back and see a comment like mine, just stay shut and move along.
---
I'm sure it's going t be. Another grind like slayer...
---
Nah that's why you're getting this message. It can't be redeemed right now, but until it's redeemed you'll keep getting that.
---
Oh God that was so bad
---
Melee:

Berserker ring (i)

Abyssal Bludgeon / Dagger (for strength training)

Ranged:

Archers ring (i)
---
Blessed d'hide (prayer bonus)
---
Blessed boots
---
Ava's assembler
---
What an idiot why would you risk your max account
---
Lava dragons, low mage requirement but requires paying attention since it's in the wilderness.
---
There's a difference between new content and growth, in my opinion. 
---
A big quest, (example, song of the elves) will add more content, that's locked behind a Grandmaster quest. Which is a great update, (and I'm super excited for it) but a new skill opens up so much potential, be it new quests, new areas, new NPCs, lore, etc. and it doesn't all have to be for someone who has the stats/skills to do a Grandmaster quest. It grows the game, because it's accessible to all.
---
I don't think that new content targeted mid/high level players is going to grow the game, it'll just keep us playing it a little bit longer.
---
Yeah, it was after the 2nd lap that i realized how to do it correctly. I've never done the Rellekka course, but I can imagine that it would be better Ranged exp with all those lvl 48 guards. But I bet most people at that level wouldn't have a Bonecrusher, so no pray. But thanks for your comments.
---
It just keeps popping up I click yes and nothing happens
---
Biblical
---
We got an entire new continent and several big expansions like Fossil Island and Corsair Cove which didn't interrupt anything. RS2 had Summoning, Construction, Hunter, and Dungeoneering all released when the playerbase was booming too and it didn't kill the playerbase
---
It's not spite voting, it's just petty
---
Get IBAN staff and you're good to go. Get it thought , really especially AT low levels.
---
Kill Green dragons for some money or blue on range it's really fast to get that starting cash to sustain iban
---
Favorite 3a set, I love this
---
Most people use the crush ring to get their specs off
---
Str bonus will always be king in dps, nothing's going to change this.
---
Attack bonus rings are nice for niche specs like dwh(where it doesn't matter what you hit if you hit anything). Esp with mythical cape
---
thats wor sando.
---
Do wildy slayer with rag gear. Youll make money off the larran keys and some off emblems.
---
Hit too close to home
---
Gaslighting is never anything
---
Daaaamn i used to have one if those. Gettin me all nostalgic.
---
Until you get hacked
---
Using this with goldsmith and ice gauntlets for blast furnace would probably be the only activity I'd consider using it
---
Yeah cause the RS servers are down to redeem it. But Google Play hasn't gotten confirmation yet from the RS servers that you got it, so they'll keep giving you that message.
---
Twitter is even more toxic than reddit. Amazingly
---
He knows AHK is bannable yet u do it, so i dont see anything wrong here on jagex their behalf
---
I think that speaks for such a small portion of the player base though. A majority of players dont have over 80 crafting/runecrafting. The underground pass and its questline are very accessible. There is a line that can be drawn for keeping things difficult. And we dont want to create ezscape. But when there is a skill that is **fundamentally** trained by most through an xp granting minigame, something is wrong. Crafting these armors dont have to be op training methods, but I see an issue with them being added to a new skill that will quickly become buyable, when they could flesh out a skill that deserves some love.
---
Isn’t slayer super popular, though? Saying “there’s already so much to do” sounds like “don’t add anymore content this game is complete”, and I dont know many people who want no more changes ever.
---
For what it's worth, they did say in the blog that the Warding Guild would have a 'cupboard' like the Seed Vault in the Farming Guild that will let you store all the different types of silks etc.
---
Looks great, excited to see it in game in the future. Battlewards were a bit much and the simplification of the lamps and vis seems good.
---
IMO, I think the crates feel more indicative of a battle royale, which is essentially the game mode anyway. Now if they had the implings possibly in addition to the dogs (just dropping food n such) that would be an interesting mechanic!
---
But don't you think that mentality dooms the future of the game?
---
Numbers will tell. We shall see if it was worth the adding when 20% playerbase is lost and yes I said 20%
---
I considered something like that, but with stats like those he already passed 1500 total threshold by 12 levels. And what I can tell from those stats, he cannot reach 1750 total without increasing his combat level, which, is a viable possibility.
---
Alright, the death runes cost I can afford, its just the prayer pots I need :(
---
This is the dumbest thing I have ever read. Everyone knows Runescape gets updates. Nobody will be overwhelmed.
---
My IQ is low just cause I got hacked once on runescape? i'll be sure to let her know.
---
Maybe ill try it again, got pked a lot last time
---
Right? The only one who can flex is that Ironman with 99 prayer no other combat. I forgot his name but he buried bones from boneyard atwildy altar lol
---
See that would be an awesome use case
---
Warding will probably be 20-40 hour skill
---
Lmfao the cigarette. This is now my favorite brainlet meme
---
LUL dont bot ~~if you dont even know how the system works~~
---
But only after getting 99 thieving
---
If jagex would take time to listen to their players they would know by now that over half the playerbase doesnt want this trash skill, a small minority whom probably still plays rs3 want to see this added in osrs. Disgusting
---
lmao i gotta wonder if this guy is serious. you get passed the trade restrictions after 2 quests that take about a minute each
---
A well thought out, and valid point. +1
---
Yeah but the rs3 team doesn't effect the osrs team
---
I know the team is small, but what are they working on now? It's been awhile since we've gotten any engine work outside of mobile. 
---
The "engine work" excuse is getting a little old coming from a billion dollar company.
---
&gt;2.  The game HAS to grow, if there's no new content, the game will go stale and players will quit. A lot of arguments against it is that it's changing the original game. I understand there's a nostalgia aspect to the game and a lot of people play it for that reason, but most exciting part of the game WAS new content - new skills in particular. If you want that magic to stay alive, to have to remember why you felt it in the first place. Discovering new places you haven't been, fighting new monsters, seeing new gear that looks awesome and working your sweet booty off to get that gear. 
---
I mean, it's been growing just fine without another skill. Growth is maintained through big updates in general.
---
The straws... you’re grasping at them.
---
Agree. It finally seems solidly it's own skill.
---
I thought the point of old school was to keep it old school... keep new skills in rs3
---
Yo Id be so keen for a mechanic-based boss as the middle part of fishing trawler instead of just plugging holes the whole time
---
This is quite literally one of those "take my money" moments.
---
&gt;Idk if someone from the 1400s would think that, and why does it matter?
---
I brought it up because you (essentially) said that cybernetics is too far fetched for us to discuss their potential impact on sports, and my argument is that at one point in time steroids would have been too far fetched to discuss their impact on sports.  And yet here we are, discussing steroids impact on sports.
---
&gt;Yeah they cant just officially "yeah rock on homies inject as much as you want" so officially its just No to steroids, but everyone accepts it as part of the sport as an unwritten rule.
---
So using steroids is officially against the rules, which in my mind means that no one should use them.  Just because there is rampant rule breaking now does not mean that rampant rule breaking should continue.
---
&gt;No, because botting isnt part of being competitive in our game, it automates it. Also, JageX governs and enforcse the rules so if the high level players decided they didnt want to follow those rules then they would simply be overtaken by legitimate players because they would be the last left. Thats not true for bodybuilding. 
---
And steroids isn't a part of competitive bodybuilding, it's an augment to it (and in my mind, and unfair one).
---
Also, I think you missed my point.  Let's say Jagex officially states that botting is against the rules, but unofficially supports limited use of bots and/or only high profile players to bot.  Would you be accepting of botting since it would then be "just a part of the culture that everyone accepts"?
---
&gt;I say officially because you are not allowed, officially, to take steroids. Everyone does it, everyone accepts it, because thats how the sport is.
---
So it's not officially allowed and everyone breaks the rules anyway.  I believe that if the rules prohibit it, then everyone who breaks those rules should be punished, regardless of how widespread the rule breaking is. 
---
&gt;RuneScape where botting is allowed cannot exist, before they would ever consider allowing it they would just automate content. Like Right-click to do X laps of ardougne course automatically.
---
I'm making the same argument for steroids in sports: sports, as a healthy competition of natural talent, cannot exist when steroids are used.  Steroids corrupt the integrity of the competition, no matter how widespread their use is.
---
A childish username I came up with back when Breaking Bad was popular...
---
Judging from a couple reddit posts though you aren't doing much better than a methhead though.
---
Fyi, steroids don’t increase your muscle mass by just using them, they speed up recovery time and  allow you to train harder and longer. Someone who just injects steroids but doesn’t workout a lot or eats healthy won’t see much of a difference. You still have to put in the work, it just decreases your limits. However, if you workout nonstop and eat as healthy as possible, you’ll only go so far, and will never be able to reach the truly huge bodybuilder status. So it’s completely different from botting. That’s why it’s secretly accepted in bodybuilding but not in other sports. Because bodybuilding is not about your natural ability like say running,  but how hard you can work and push yourself to look as big as possible. It’s just that to achieve that goal you need help from steroids.
---
I have not insured it. It's just sitting in my bank all safe and sound. And I appreciate the offer but I'm an Ironman so I'll have to respectfully decline.
---
How did they not catch that they’re using a method that requires 99 smithing in their calculation for xp and time needed for 99 smithing? That doesn’t many any sense...
---
&gt;There are barrows teleport tabs nowadays that I think a lot of people don't know about.
---
Oh ya, I've been using those. Definitely a godsend. We don't have those in RS3, the only Barrows teleport over there is a reward from a relatively high level quest, so just being able to buy the teletabs with no reqs is a huge convenience.
---
&gt; if you want to imbue them at nightmare zone
---
So I actually tried NMZ a week or so ago and consistently got bopped like 3-4 bosses in and barely got any points. And imbueing stuff takes like 800k-1.2m it seems kind of outside my reach at the moment. I know you can afk there for 6 hours with the right setup, I just don't have that setup.
---
&gt;Occult necklace boosts mage damage by 10% and only costs ~1mil these days, I would say thats nearly a must for doing barrows.
---
Oo, I've been using a glory so yeah, definitely seems like a good upgrade.
---
I gotta say, getting XP and levels isn’t fun in the first place. Grinding is just monotonous work. Obviously botting is against the rules, but who in their right mind actually wants to get 200M XP in a skill “legit?”
---
Idk. This is just me griping about how the game works and how people focus on maxing etc.
---
But if you drop the items, other players can pick them up immediately (or after X seconds, scales with level)
---
And juggling should be just as hard in game as irl
---
Also you can do tricks to dazzle enemies and impress friends
---
When you get a high level in juggling NPCs treat you like the geek you are
---
OK so smiting makes melee armor and crafting makes ranging armor. Doesn't it make sense to also have a skill for making mage armor then?
---
Lots of people want osrs to change, heck its even necessary for the game to stay alive. But does that mean we have to accept every trash skill suggestion for the sake of adding new content? fuck no, id rather see something nice added into the game not something trash like this.
---
Minecraft has multiple lives, Terraria has multiple lives, etc. I just feel that if you die, you get a TON of experience taken off your skills. I'd go so far as to say 25% of your current experience in each skill, so it feels big
---
lol
---
Fire away, assistant
---
Turns out ice barrage is AoE spell, so yes in fact they can
---
I will be voting no for any buyable skill. They’re not fun and don’t add anything to the game.
---
It was just recent wasnt it? Molch island and the farming guild with new slayermaster and monsters and boss?? I myself just barely completed molch island content and have yet to touch slayer area yet and just recently learned benefits of farm guild. Keep in mind I'm 122 cblvl and find that I barely done half of osrs at this point. If they add in warding what is that. Something I'm going to have to do if I want to be meta if I cant keep up with new gear if any of it is bis
---
The Gower brothers lost every right to talk about osrs when they let it turn into rs3
---
👏S👏A👏R👏C👏A👏S👏M👏
---
Twitter was a mistake anyway
---
Am i honestly the only one who couldnt care less if the mtx was cosmetic only?
---
That is not at all what a gold sink is, this skill is an item sink. It will remove current items from the game through disassembling. Unless there is a key component that feeds gold to shops, 0 gold will be removed from the game.
---
The dance of champions
---
Why are you so insistent on adding a skill to the game? We don’t need it and there is plenty of existing content that needs attention. Forcing continuous game changing updates is the quickest way to ruin the game again, one would think you guys learn.
---
&gt; What do you mean would I accept steroid use? I obviously wouldn't. I likely wouldn't bodybuild if steroids were allowed. It's common sense really.
---
I wouldnt accept football boots for football. It allows players to stand more firmly on the ground. Thats not natural at all!
---
&gt; If everyone uses bots, everyone is competing and playing on the same playing field. Doesn't mean that it's good logic to defend botting with.
---
Yes but when youre botting youre literally doing nothing yourself. Thats not a very interesting grounds for a competition. With bodybuilding you have to be working hard as fuck and shape your whole life after it. Its a 24/7 job. Even when you sleep "youre at work".
---
Every update is useful for Ironman. Jagex practically runs the game around them.
---
lul means dick in dutch..
---
So ye..
---
LUL dont bot
---
I love ds1 and desert treasure. Underground pass would be really cool without all the agility bs.
---
I was legit on a farm run this week and i got a genie right before i teleported to the farming guild... ffs thats 700 rc xp i dont have

This ain't the movies. Gotta hold it so you puncture the air pocket. Then twist a bit to open the hole more than a slit.

This is one of my issues with warding. People drawing wards all over could pretty drastically change the environments of key locations. Personally I’d be happy with fixed locations where you can ward.

Are you in Argentina by any chance?

I see Audi. I upvote.

Idk man people are pretty unanimously for the ban.  You might be referring to the threads where the guy is clearly fucking innocent.  Sorry that those threads bother you I guess, but I feel like it's completely understandable those get upvoted.
---
Go pk your wife
---
Fuck yeah I do! And I might even like warding I know almost nothing about it but the whole concept of a new skill doesn’t feel old school to me
---
Do you have any tips on how to model like this? What tools do you use?
---
Nintendo caters to the gamer community well actually, they are a gamer focused company and do very well with updates, of course some glitches happened on Switch's launch day with controllers malfunctioning, but I think they fixed that.   
---
Honestly I trust Nintendo more than Jagex....
---
That's a fair point about cannoning slayer to to get to 90. I've cannoned slayer up til now which is where the 87 ranged came from. 85 slayer. Might just stick it out to 90 to save the money.
---
never botted, and crystalmathlabs (xp tracking website) shows that I only did mining for 5 hours which Mod Weath claims is the reason that I got perm banned
---
The fucks this cancer of a post
---
You clearly have no idea how rs3 changed and how hard its getting pumped for money. I enjoyed that game, but seeing first hand as an active rs3 player it go down the path it currently went is heartbreaking. I'm glad they got to be wealthy and pocket money, but the way Jagex is getting run and being pumped by an outside company for money is not something you want to be happening. I don't remember the Gower brothers selling the company due to financial reasons either. If they sold to pocket money while they were ahead and to leave the fruits of their labor in someone else's hands then their option doesn't matter, especially if it impacted their company and game negatively.
---
Personally, mage is my favorite combat skill and I think it desperately needs some love in the armor department.  I think the skill fits perfectly into the artisanal combat triangle. I dont think its perfect yet but I think it fills a big hole in the game and it's lore.
---
I dont think everything about it is great but at least the general concept I think is something the game needs so I'm curious why you're so avidly against it? I hope you give jagex your constructive feedback and give the skill a shot
---
&gt;swow
---
Fucking lol this things the best
---
If you've already got enough free time for a max cape, then paying for and training a mid-speed production skill isn't going to be much of an issue for you.

Sorry to crush your hopes

Serene bad!

that's also pretty weird, means she's not interested in your hobbys at all :(
---
r/ISmokeWeed
---
Ironic flair tag you have there.
---
There were more interesting and op armour sets with more interesting effects (applying poison or reflecting damage) but they were removed due to really poor feedback. People also spoke out to lower the stats of the armour proposed in the current blog
---
Amazing post, much agreed.
---
And this is runescape because..?
---
This.
---
It’s going to have a weird feeling surrounding it for a while but will become normal like everything else eventually
---
Ive considered chinning before but it honestly just isnt worth it. Its not enjoyable and people forget how fast cannoning is anyway due to the high xp rates promised by chinning making people forget that 100k ranged xp/hour is already  very fast
---
Jagex knows what you did last summer hahahahhahaha 
---
PS suck shit botter
---
I mean it's not about devaluing at that point. It's about literally removing something you have.
---
imagine crying about toxicity on the interwebs
---
Never thought I'd make it to the top of Controversial on a post about RuneScape, but here I am. Lol
---
and Thank you 🙏

When you still on tutorial island learning to shotgun

---
Most likely a trojan virus, what is interesting though is if you havent tried downloading anything runescape related (such as a bot) makes me think you have  downloaded something random and the owner of the virus plays runescape.
---
Everyone caught botting: bUt It WaS mY FiRsT TiMe i SwEaR"
---
No, depending on whether or not the skill and the specific question passes
---
I've heard about that. I don't think that's enough. The way they portrayed the skill in their recent video was that the community designed the skill, which while they have accepted feedback and made changes, the core skill design has remained unchanged since their first blog post. 
---
If they really wanted to show they would take feedback, they would open a content suggestion github for the skill where players could suggest changes. The beta is just one part of it. An offical place just for warding feedback would show to me they're committed. This has been on a Q&amp;A before https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/a5mjk8/old_school_developer_qa_transcript_12122018/
---
Right now, jagex doesn't have the trust of some players to deliver a 'good-enough' quality for a skill design.
---
Exactly! It would make it so much more engaging
---
The quest or the karma from the repost
---
To me warding feels like the result of two specific issues:
---
 * Jagex wanting to control the economy by introducing another buyable skill and an item sink
---
 * High level runecrafters not wanting to lose the prestige of their accomplishment in a slow skill
---
Neither of these feel like valid reasons to introduce an entirely new skill. Every piece could be included in a different skill. I agree with you, a skill with more potential like sailing or dungeoneering would be more deserving of the spot.
---
I'm confused. Warding isnt in rs3?
---
Corp beast is private server esque? What?
---
How is a minigame where you re-fight quest bosses at all out of the picture...it's quite literally using lore from lunars to explain it. As you are simply honing your skills in a dream..
---
That's the argument, but ranged armor has zero penalties for melee. Protect from Magic also shortens freezes on the standard spellbook. So it's not like melee is helpless here. Mages are generally gonna have shit-tier dps on dragonhide.
---
They left the fucking company in 2010. rs3 didnt happen till 2013.
---
not really. Blowpipe &gt; chaotic rapier. SCythe &gt; Chaotic rapier. Sang staff &gt; Chaotic staff. Blowpipe/Tbow &gt; Chaotic Crossbow. Chatoic Shields are completely useless too. Scythe &gt; Chaotic maul.
---
I mean don't get me wrong there are a couple good ones but they filled most spots with tank armor. Nothing pvp game changing really. And for a skill designed to support magic I figured it would be not game changing but at least have a little more bang
---
Its combat... You could *always* afk all combat skills to 99. That has never changed.
---
This is hella fax zulrah was the beginning of the end

I'm probably only going to have Dagon'Hai myself and it'll just replace the slots I currently have my Ahrims in. I'm sure they can let the cupboard store vis etc as well.

Why would being in the dark hurt you?
---
There is nothing good on Netflix
---
They left well before Jagex was sold to a Chinese company
---
I understand your frustrations, but if you want the actual story there's a documentary on YouTube that's actually a pretty good watch
---
&gt; Youd also have to make your own armor and equipment.
---
nobody did this lol. You get armor from the boss drops one time and then you're set forever.
---
I definitely do agree that splitting questions is a good way to get good stuff in while weeding out the bad. 
---
But I also think they would never ask such a question because it's very anti-player to go "hey that thing you've had for years... Yoink"
---
rune sword has decent dps against stuff with low def
---
Somebody pls make one if not
---
Are you in Israel by any chance?
---
Yeah but its ferda so it is worth it
---
nah this is aids
---
Scythe is stronger  than Chaotic Rapier/Maul, Blowpipe/Tbow is stronger than Chaotic Crossbow, Sang staff is stronger than Chaotic Staff. So yeah, Dung wouldn't even be a powercreep anymroe,.
---
You’re the reason trump is in office.
---
Right.. because it's newer and better. And if there was another method nmz likely wouldn't be touched. That's the nature of training any skill.
---
So im trying to follow your logic. The people who made the hayday of runescape the creme de la creme. Quit. And the game goes to shit. And now they say an update looks good. and you say they have no input. That makes 0 sense.
---
Actually no it doesn’t, because there’s no need in doing it if you already have it imbued from nmz, which most people do.
---
All of your points are hypothetical and you haven't given a single concrete reason why anyone would want warding to be added to the game. "Because I think so" or "it has potential" is not very convincing.
---
I can depending on what I’m watching
---
A fresh economy would be sooo hype. If they didn’t re-introduce the GE this time around I probably wouldn’t feel the need to play Ironman.
---
Looking at the dislikes on the warding video they posted, this definitely won’t pass without Jagex rigging it
---
As someone who does not currently play as a result of burnout, I feel that warding could be what brings me back. I just wish more players would give it a chance.
---
Not in game i mean. Id rather enjoy the day then stand in a f2p world and spam need 3m lol. Thanks tho
---
That would still be the low/no cost method of training.
---
Like others have said. 60 attack piety is only 103 combat even with 77 magic for augury. They're absolute pure smiters in deep wild and claws actually lets you take on max mains and are great for standard honor PKing as well. Even DDS shreds with all the untradeables. Plus, at 103 combat you can still bully max pures (88 combat) in PVP worlds. You'll also have access to anchor as a good 2H weapon for once spec is used.
---
Its bigger than it used be right now, by a mile, it doesnt need a new skill. They should think about changing the name of the game by now, its supposed to be Old school runescape, the reddit is even called 2007scape. Your all caps rage is not enforcing your point either. I agree that things you state could be good for the game, but this still is osrs. I stick to my point that a new skill like this is too alienating for a game like this.
---
He’s a loser irl so he has to compensate in a virtual world which will end one day. He’s probably on suicidewatch now.
---
They polled what people wanted the devs to focus on and a new skill was the most voted for
---
HOLY CHEESE, these are amazing, absolutely loved the dhide boots overall, the shield and cbow look dope aswell, but some variants could also be cool
---
Ok so slayer staff e. I’m reading to use to enchantment on a regular slayer staff to give it 2,500 charges. Does it replace magic dart? As in with a built in spell? So slayer staff e = no fines needed? The enchantment seems super cheap for this to be the case
---
Pretty certain you can only kill it once.
---
I would do it if I could afford 99 herblore
---
Did you have to open the authenticator app to get in aswell?
---
Ali Morrisane always managing to sell you junk has got to be one of the funnier jokes in the game
---
Also, a medieval game like this that is still around with such a huge playerbase is doing something right.. Dont fix it if it aint broken
---
From what I’ve seen whip will out Dps cudgel but it’s still far from BIS. I’ve been using hasta after testing bludgeon, leaf blades battle axe and cudgel.
---
YES
---
There's no reason why they couldn't extend it to other warding related items.
---
Pray augury to help not being barraged. Not getting frozen should be a priority.
---
Strength corresponds to max hit, specific attack bonuses (slash, crush) corresponds to accuracy. So the cudgel would hit more often, but whip would do higher damage per hit. How exactly that translates into DPS isn’t as clear.
---
they slipped my mind but all of them are usually killed with trident which carries a 1 item risk, and as for scorpia, people only bring around 30-50k worth of barrages/blitz. with the thammorans set it could potentially bring up the usage of the normal spellbook depending on how good it is, so im not totally against it.
---
Will the elemental and large pouches be usable along side with the wildy rune pouch when in wildy?
---
I think warding is a stupid skill. It doesn't matter how interesting, or flushed out it is. It isn't something we as a player base want added because there are other things they could add before this.
---
I don't think it shouldn't be put into the game, but for the first skill they release since hunter? No. They can do better.
---
Give us something that won't be just another grind. Make the game more engaging, by adding skills that will be fun and engaging rather than oh look at this new grind we made for you, but it's got good rewards for grinding it out!
---
I'm ded
---
Probably because of the concentration camps for children.
---
Did he say ‘baby’, is he talking to his girlfriend? 
---
If thats the case im jealous as fuck.
---
I dont even tell my girlfriend I play runescape
---
The only lvl 99 rate they cited is rune pl8legs and thats worse exp than addy pl8bodies.
---
Gold smithing is the same from 50-99. (Appart from cape perk saving you some ticks I guess). 
---
Crafting should be bstaves vs black dhide. 
---
But tbh the rates are in the correct bullpark.
---
Saved the best till last
---
I generally have been camping it unless I get confident. it definitely helps a lot I need to just keep that shit on lmao
---
But how would we know if he's gaining xp still?
---
Pretty much, but it's Jagex so their rules are fairly inconsistent. Suicide botting for example will always get you permed as far as I'm aware, but I've never botted so take what I say with a grain of salt
---
Ya, I’d say that’s a fair rough estimate once you minus the bots, the casuals who won’t care and the new generation of kids who play. (Don’t actually know if that last one exists but for the sake of the argument I threw it in)
---
Great thanks, i dont give a fuck
---
Yeah I mean I get that in the long run on average it would be the same as if they just gave it 310 charges. It’s just the edge cases that are going to be frustrating. But I still think it would be less frustrating to go into it knowing exactly how long you have until you need to replace the charges. And maybe that’s okay seeing as how closely tied to RNG every aspect of this game is, like it’s just another instance of that. But my gut reaction says I would rather have something predictable in this case.
---
Get 99 firemaking and do a vid of starting a giant forest fire
---
Only a Sith deals in absolutes, my friend. I can't give concrete evidence because it would be arrogant of me to act like I have it. All I have is my opinion on the matter, which is of no more value than yours.
---
awesome stuff! go fuck yourself!
---
There are plenty of people who share my opinion. I believe the game as a whole would be better without it. It’s a perfectly fine use of language, next.
---
Jagex doesn't give a shit about anything but money. FYI. 15 years down the drain.
---
I wouldn't play w/o a GE. Even back in 06 I thought that trading was annoying, tedious, and slow.
---
I need that second bank for the random quest junk I hoard for no reason
---
Sorry, I don’t want this added to OldSchool.
---
I will be voting no on my main and 4 alts.
---
Thanks man!
---
🎣
---
You'll be back. Don't worry, ya always come back.
---
Smithing could use a whole rework but I don't even know how you would begin doing that.
---
I remember my first beer.
---
Stop thinking of OSRS as a time capsule and think of it as an alternative timeline. Some fuckwitted concept of nostalgia shouldn't hold the game back from growing.
---
that's a gamer moment if I ever see one
---
Yea
---
Rockmake monster kill good
---
when hard clue loot 20k
---
Well end of the day if people don’t want a new skill they don’t want a new skill, no real discussion needed.  You don’t need to review what’s been changed because it still remains a new skill which is what they are against.
---
Thats the most nerdy and amazing fact I’ve heard in a while. Thanks
---
&gt; How is this going to grow the game?
---
To casuals like me it'll give us a new way to make money, and hopefully semi-AFK-able.  I'm really looking forward to it.
---
&gt;Will returning players come back for a new smithing? 
---
That's probably a valid criticism, but I don't see why every update has to be super splashy.
---
&gt;Will non rs players see this and be amazed?
---
I think the better question to ask would be "will this update actively drive new players away?"  I think the answer to that is no, so it's ok that it won't necessarily be super splashy and attract large crowds.
---
&gt;You might say dont let them come, but then the game will die. The company already has money problems.
---
I don't think anyone is arguing that we should keep new players out.
---
&gt;I think copying warframes business model and releases would be the best thing for the osrs community. Somtimes things are added that dont exactlt fit, but they are exciting and new and so long as not gamebreaking they should be embraced. That is what runescape of old did with slayer, with dungeoneering, with hunter, with construction. They didnt add a new smithing or crafting.
---
Hunter is just fishing but for land animals.  Construction is just crafting/smithing but for houses and furniture.  Saying warding is just magical crafting is disingenuous.
---
&gt;Unleas the gameplay of this skill has some unique catch, its going to be a flop and waste of resources (in my opinion**)
---
Sure, maybe, but with the proposed minigames I don't think you'll have to worry about the unique catch.

What would you consider non sub-par equipment? Around cb 107
---
Here’s the thing about deep wildy pking. When you start out those sorts of things do happen.  I can promise you everyone that started had teams kill them and died several times before they got decent. It’s how you learn. Pking isn’t just about getting kills, you have to learn to tank as well. You said you’re near max so gp shouldn’t be an issue but if 500k is too much to lose you can lower your risk. The spell book is t getting changed anytime soon. Every other pker is dealing with it fine so I’m not sure why it bothers you. As dumb as it sound switching gear and accurately casting barrage is part of the skill. Osrs is a point and click game after all. Trust me on this, if the barrage icon became large tribriding would be incredibly easier. You can also pk with friends in singles or even multi. You have options. Gl dude
