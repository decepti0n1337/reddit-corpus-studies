Buying r2h!

---
Hii I‚Äôm 42! üôÉare you on EUW for league¬ø
---
It's not "dominated" by men, women are just less interested in tech jobs lmao
---
What else would it be ?
---
Base 40's, 50 firemaking, 27 runecrafting and 28 ranged. Also do all f2p quests.
---
Someone's leaving that on now
---
Or.. I continue doing what I‚Äôm doing and save my precious time to do important things on my main while keeping my cannonballs stocked up. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Not really, because you can skip a lot of early levels by completing the quests
---
Can you stop spamming 1000 questions. Other people have questions too.
---
[removed]
---
What's your CC?
---
It likely is and that's why he made 3 pairs of pants, I don't think that was intentional
---
Ahhh yeah I bet. That was the price from a couple weeks ago on the last time I looked em up. I saw and was like damn lol. But hopefully you‚Äôll get lucky soon enough too! 
---
Why do you suggest 50 fm? I feel like fm is slightly useless, unless it is needed in a minigame or quest?
---
Wintertodt minigame
---
What do you think about ironman accounts paying protection clans to farm revs? The ironmen have to use another account to trade the protection money, and the benefit is massive, due to the supplies and cash dropped by revs. It seems against the spirit of the game mode.
---
Ahh gotcha thank you
---
You seem to think a cball alt is more valuable simply because you need cballs. It's still no more valuable than 200-300k per hour. You can easily get 2-3x that from a pvm alt. The only advantage to a cball alt is how easy it is to start up
---
It is against the rules. And the exchange rates are set up loosely based on the bond GE values, but you lose gp trading between either game, of course, which is where the ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù sites make their money (because the RWT that ‚Äúprofit‚Äù for actual profit).
---
Ridiculous rng lol 
---
Brine sabre due to its speed.
---
Another 25 Year old Josh Reporting for dooty.

Spooky
---
if you search osrs -item-, it's first when you search osrs wiki
---
I feel for you
---
Thanks! I was aiming for about 40+ in everything... only have Crafting, Smithing, and FMing to go.
---
ya done good kid, ya done good. \*slow clap\*
---
T. 1200 total shitkid
---
But a whole baked potato with butter, corn, and fish? That's a whole plate minimized to one thing 
---
More respectable than a bought skill (crafting/fletching/cooking/smithing) but I dont think most people care. Mining isnt an extremely useful cape either as its 5% chance on bonus ore up to adamantite. So maybe some people will but if you enjoy mining then make it your first 99 dont let how respectable it is stop you, unless you wanna make it cooking then it should stop you.
---
Bro... whips are 70 atk. Tentacles need 75, but abyss is the one ppl use for slyer training.
---
how? you literally can't afk at all while remaining effecient so youre just right click, left click, 2 , right click, left click, 6  repeat for hours .....i can't stand it personally.
---
Brutal black dragons have both of those items on their regular drop table. It's not very rare at all
---
Is that not fireworks? I thought you got fireworks every level
---
It didn't pass the poll.
---
Thank you
---
&gt; Lots of dumbasses starting to vape just to vape
---

---
tbf, the same can be said about smoking
---
Quiet! You're giving away my money  making secrets boii
---
Barb assault was very fun for me, but I understand your point. 
---
I know its a small change but find a way to calculate the farming cape perk into the numbers?
---
Someone‚Äôs been doing the western diaries. Literally did this yesterday and made blurberry specials
---
Needs more skin
---
Wow, a literal idiot. 
---
Considering if thats a whole fish, thatd be more than a whole plate anyways. The other way around, have you never heard of a ‚Äúloaded‚Äù baked potato?
---
Wow bud you're such a cool guy wow wow
---
Swan song
---
Goals
---
Which coincidentally, is the two numbers after 24 in the value of your chest.
---
Happy right, you‚Äôre holy cake day shit
---
I would say its respectable. But I think the most visually appealing untrimmed capes are untrimmed slayer and untrimmed hp
---
This should be Achievements too lol
---
Lol well it was good gp in f2p and it became my highest skill. And now im at 88 and figure might as well finish it out . 
---
Why does the cactus patch, when checking its health, plays some weird flute audio? What is the purpose of it? Why is it there? What does it mean?
---
OMG SALS REALM!!!!!@#!@!

Wtf that shit looks like a 12yo blind kid did those tats

Selling r2h 100k iron certs 1k each hit 777
---
As a fellow maxed player, I think the problem might be that he does it too much.
---
Didn't you use to play rs3 on the clan sprapple? 
---
Took me a while but I found [this](https://gyazo.com/a782c61b02f025f77bb73ad7b5751214) chatlog in rs3 where we met I guess hah

I knew this episode was existed, but didn‚Äôt know it generated the fist meme
---
I lost a lost - sucks, but shit happens.
---
My question is why? This was suggested and polled, new area requiring new equipment that isn't the boring old Prims, Pegs, Eternal. 
---
And then...... lets completely undo that two days before? Wtf are people going to be using Boots of Brimestone for?
---
The reason this happens is because of a function call in the .cpp that throttles the gpu only on Linux because of a hypervisor in in the actual Linux kernel. No reason to work around it since a simple line in the console fixes it, also a fix will just cause more bugs. I also made that all up.
---
fuck doing slayer until like 75 combat for the fairy slayer master at LEAST. the low level slayer masters make slayer so aids lmao. As boring as it is, I'd 100% recommend cranking quests. you'll get xp alot faster in some skills than you would actually training them.
---
It looks cool and Mod Rys already did the work for it. What's the point  in not having it?
---
Theres also torture and abby dagger
---
&gt;I just realized that the Tuna Potato is a whole fish resting on top of a potato
---
Is that not how we make tuna in real life have I been doing it wrong?
---
Who hurt you?

Cool that they updated the graphics on those items, I love the new look of ahrims skirt

---
The Number 23, 24 is the sequel starting Keifer Sutherland
---
Did they showcase the regular hydras looks yet? I am curious how they are gonna look like
---
My PC cost less than their Iphone kek
---
which is a pretty bad method for regular accs
---
Why do people always want to make pets something more than a cosmetic? It‚Äôs the only reason they made it into the game in the first place. 
---
Nice
---
I thought there was only one. Are you trolling me? If not is it worth watching? 
---
Now go do xeric. 2.4bil in loot guaranteed.
---
You don't. os.rs.wiki tab will make chrome search within the domain os.rs.wiki 
---
Range is overpowered as it is, so no. I think this was discussed at some point and even polled for tob
---
you're so funny!
---
commit toaster-bath

Super annoying

Put this bot down please.

Unlucky m8

Perhaps I should do some more KBD, my kc‚Äôs only in the low twenties
---
Old wiki redirects everything to Nieve 
---
https://osrs.wiki works too
---
Yup! I've been playing for a little over a month now.. 60 Cb and most of my skills are 30+ 
---
Does it have to be fully charged or just have atleast 1 charge on it for doubling the gem speed?
---
Q
---
At 15 prayer you're going to be stuck with tiny minuscule risks since you can't protect item which is no fun
---
I actually pasted a picture but it doesn't show for some reason.
---
This is great and amazing and I like and respect it a lot. 
---
Spellbook and inventory are on opposite sides of the screen on mobile, so definitely not afk.
---
Mr Mammal would hate you lol. Hey well gz on your ironman luck :) I have a normal acc so I can't really complain. In my 350kc I just sold my normal loot for a magic fang and gear upgrades. My only ironman is on RS3 (reeeee) and I get plenty of ironman luck on that.
---
Don't be adinine or it will make an as out of i and nine
---
Not bad, then thats pretty good start. Look into money making methods if you plan to bond it out
---
Jesus Christ I was going to check Entrana but that's membership so I didn't
---
I believe 1 charge will work as well
---
Dat scorpion tho
---
Gotcha, didnt know
---
Added, thanks man
---
Added
---
once you get to redwoods you can just afk on mobile all day. I do it at work all day just to keep up the leveling and I'm now on my way to 96 wc
---
Could still rush if you're into that. High mage also means you get railed less by magic (ie. from SoTD pures)
---
Nah, you can't train em without both positive and negative reinforcement.
---
Yeah why is he getting upvoted for going off topic. Especially since it's him of all people.
---
Also in Trailer Park Boys, Bubbles uses it 
---
no
---
Gold pouches are so dumb from thieving 
---
As far as I know, they would just be used to get to zanaris via shed, which isn't really necessary
---
You're an American Psycho.
---
Yeah but they are useless. in my opinion. But if you havent noticed this post is dieing. so my suggestion is not valid anymore.
---
Max account and tent whip, otherwise make sure you're staking someone with absolute same stats and same weapon
---
And there‚Äôs only 24 days left in January wtf?!?
---
There is no obstacle that god ash cannot conquer 
---
Paid like $90 for my phone, can do this lol
---
Fuck is he actually white? Ewwwwwwwwwwwwww
---
nah you just need to turn off dx9. the rendering is super poorly optimized
---
8pm
---
which, even if you are being accurate (given that you are intentionally trying to mislead what your statistics refer to that's a big doubt), doesn't actually prove all that much. an actual good metric would have been pre vs post transition. you are clearly aware of this which is why you tried to misrepresent your very epic evidence to fit your agenda. again, there's a reason why the scientific and medical consensus is arguing something very different than what you are trying to argue. you just make yourself look like an idiot by the way.. you aren't going to convince anyone that wasn't already convinced.

One of my in-game friends offered to train some skills for me on my account for my birthday. I was hesitant but I gave them my info. I had to go out so I was anxious about my account being stolen the whole time. Once I got home I logged in to find they actually did train my account up a bit and didn't take anything. Incredibly stupid move but thank god or else I would've had an emo phase.
---
Yep. And anything u find profitable to alch. Will most likely only be profitable for a few days or even just a few hours. I wouldn‚Äôt ask on here. Just go to the ge and check the price of an item, then check the high alch price. If it more profit than the value of a nature rune at the moment, then you‚Äôll profit
---
You can do it with barbarian fishing and it levels agility

Two suggestions I saw before that I thought were nice QOL / buffs that the team like and approved of were
---
1. Rune throwing axe spec being able to hit all Kraken tentacles 
---
2. Master Scroll Book being broken down into teleports to Watson
---
Any update on them? Were they just forgotten or are they still coming?
---
RemindMe! 1430 minutes

Hey man, if you believe the quacks who tell you that a man can be a woman and vice versa, be my guest.

Planked

Its there so they can ban account sellers. Regular players just sharing with their friends don't get banned.
---
I base my assertion on the fact that almost every popular streamer account shares publicly
---
Real pain when on mobile
---
24 is my favorite number, gratz :)
---
Some pkers also only play to play with there friends and have fun, keep that in mind too.  I basically only log into my main if I'm going pking with some friends.
---
Used to do singles when I played more but I just play to dick around now.
---
You should have caught a hint at "bring your most valuable items skulled"

You can try using [this](https://youtu.be/xn0X0PettxU). That‚Äôs what I used.

% chance at double resources in puzzle rooms? What‚Äôs so wrong with that?

did mith capes to 70, fuck cons, buying mahogany planks to 83 idgaf
---
pretty sure they‚Äôll give you a freebie similar to letting you get 1 thermy kc without having him as a task don‚Äôt worry 
---
Well the account is a side project, but I think it's illogical that it takes an additional 1500 hours to max a skill because you did a quest. 
---
Is there a section of the high scores that lists pking stats like "most kills" and whatnot?
---
NSA: don't fuckin move, kiddo.

Downvoted back to 24

Green D'hide Bodies were pretty good last time I checked.

No you can‚Äôt

For clarification, the ONLY allowed use of AHK is strictly remapping keys (e.g. you can use it to remap your numpad buttons to the letter keys so you can use different keys for MouseKeys). You can't e.g. move your mouse with AHK.
---
&gt;fast paced
---
lol
---
I wouldn't be surprised at all. I think the average age of people who play runescape directly overlaps with the age range of people who grew up watching spongebob.
---
Pardon?
---
5pm pst is 8pm est
---
you do it by going away from it

I also found it funny you fished a bunch of lobsters. Terrible go and terrible xp.

Do you know who was rank 1 overall by the time you quit OSRS?

Had the same happened to me, the only difference was i got it after burning the chewed bones, mine is a 1/10500, yours is a 1/32768
---
Actually had one before I ran into some financial issues lol
---
Yeah, they viewbot those streams. As a general rule, just don't follow links and sign into then. It wasn't actually a link to [secure.runescape.com](http://imgur.com/gallery/iWKad22) it was a hyperlink just as I've done here. It leads to a fake copy that will steal your pw
---
What's the official website?
---
That said, it is worth noting that the Elite requires you to grow one of the new crops, the Battlestaff tree. So even if you can get the new seed quickly, there will be a timegate of like 16~ hours. So if you're going for day 1 stuff in the new dungeon, you'll still need boots.
---
Are you... are you fucking retarded?
---
Ring of Italy 
---
lmfao zuhaar dude come on 
---
I agree with you the whole point of me posting this is not for the rewards it‚Äôs for the team aspect of the minigame. Nowhere else is there a minigame where each class can support each other to beat the other team. It was amazing and fun to have such a game. Not saying they should bring back SC directly but maybe come up with a minigame that involves the same aspects. I want this to be motivation to merge skulking and pvp in something at least. 
---
I fucking love it how he just falls rather than using any strength left in those beautiful legs.
---
It will work just as well with farming guild as it just adds 4th disease free patch unless I'm mistaken?
---
I know, it's just that I got all the other uniques before the spear.
---
For real. We need it like 5% of the time and it misses its mark.
---
Meanwhile it‚Äôs spamming the hell out of some thread where everyone is talking about the new wiki anyways. 
---
Are you somehow gatekeeping smoking‚Äôs retarded cousin?

Too ‚Äúop‚Äù (rs3). Meanwhile blowpipe is stronger than chaotics with max gear overloads and turmoil.

whats your point
---
Even if I die on my HC, I can still play a normie Btw
---
give this man an oscar
---
&gt;sounds unfactual but ok
---
Mmmm sorry but if you spent any time there you could join the groups chats and find out for yourself how many people are dedicated to updating it after the previous administrators left in an egotistical rage and denounced it on this sub in such a manner that cause morons like yourself to come and vandalize it. 
---
&gt;wikia is a garbage platform.
---
It's served this community indelibly for many years and will continue to do so. 
---
&gt;the old wiki is only kept alive because wikia (as in, the company) profits off ad revenue and selling content and data created on its platform
---
And? I'd rather that than them charging a membership fee. 
---
&gt;with limited customization options and no real way to offer more modern wiki software features, or improvements like the new wiki's quest lines checkboxes.
---
It's features are more than adequate. I find it hilarious that checkboxes are the major advancement you bring up. Fucking hold on to your hats boys!
---
&gt;unless you're literally working for wikia i don't even see why you feel the need to defend it
---
I am loyal, I have edited the wikia for 6 years. Why should I turn my back on it because of some loser admins fell out with wikia staff? I guarantee the wiki will end in tears when Jagex begin to exercise their power over it, this is the only reason they decided to host it. 
---
Rewards could be on par with a dragon harpoon or pickaxes as these were new and best in slot for skilling but haven‚Äôt effected the economy drastically. Or maybe T50 pickaxes and others 
---
Would appreciate my bank doubled xoxo
---
You need to understand that you don't know everything either, I've been around people who recovered accounts since 2008 or so and you really need to rethink what is possible.  You used mod ash's wife as an example, you can't compare that to the average player because the ease of finding her information when she is linked to someone so much in the public eye is far easier than a random player posting their name on a reddit screenshot.  The fact people take the meme of blacking out half of the screen to stop themself getting hacked seriously is comical.  
---
  
---
Yes the recovery system can be abused but you are by far over estimating how simply it can be abused.
---
How do you know it was runelight?
---
Take a seat, dear
---
My money making method was inviting random players to my (shit) house and cooking them scrambled egg which they would pay for, then offering them the chance to buy a toy soldier
---
Genius
---
You can drop all your keys and talk to the guy again he‚Äôll give you a bunch 
---
No it didn't.
---
I was more so talking about the anema patch providing a global increased yield for all patches in the game. Don't think they've confirmed how strong that will be yet
---
Use Alch mate. 
---
A
---
&amp;#x200B;

It will be a long way off for you now but you can get a max house for 20-30m, it's definitely a worthwhile investment.

No duh. Will still have it in 2 weeks
---
**GIVE ME MY FU\*KING GP BACK!**
---
\**screams at Make-over Mage\** 
---
Unfortunate but nothing you do will get you your gold back. Highly doubt it was runelite
---
Light bali, fury, tunic, archer ring. No rangers doe
---
Is it gatekeeping if saying starting to vape with nicotine for no reason isn't the best idea?
---
sounds like you're ratted, turn internet off and do a virus scan
---
I'm not sure what MTX is, but I'd assume rs3 is a more appealing and fun game for most people who've never played runescape before.  Action bar and all that junk is a little more engaging and the graphics are nicer.  Plus it seems a lot of stuff is cheaper on there so it's a bit easier to get going.  Whip is like 82k on rs3 
---
Coward, you are all piss and vinegar 
---
Was not runelite. Not sure what your wealth would have been, but I can safely assume there‚Äôs tens of thousands of accounts that run runelite that make your bank look minuscule. Mine included, I‚Äôm not rich either, but runelite doesn‚Äôt do that. Runelite is a real business.
---
I wish they would move zulrah to elite :(
---
I wonder if you can recreate this
---
Listen I just wanted to call vaping smoking‚Äôs retarded cousin. 
---
I don‚Äôt actually care.
---
Nobody cares about your nostalgia.  Yes the prices on RS3 are laughable, but nostalgia isn't a reason to never update.
---
Yeah idfk. My first post was a little aggressive, I added an edit to address that. Probably just not presenting my stance in an approachable way.
---
Yeah, true. Inhalers and things such as that aren't bad for you, they're medicine. Was being a bit black and white there.
---
As far as I remember the shamans should need 100% favour which wasnt stated but what was stated is that if you arent on task you will get 5 times less the drop rate on uniques as the usual drop rate.
---
Yeah that's exactly how I started when I was 12 and I regret the shit out of it. 
---
i loled but then i realized there isnt. theres only 12 numbers on a clock
---
Doesnt jagex specifically tell you not to put your password into anything that isnt the official runescape site. Your fault sad but true
---
Agreed. The important thing here is the fact that EVERYTHING would need to be polled. Just like warding. People are overreacting to it but forget it has a good chance of never being put into the game 
---
Meta
---
Thanks!
---
No runelite didn't hack your account, your dumbass probably signed up for a fake giveaway or double xp stream 
---
Next month
---
I have 24 normals omg
---
Stop posting garbage.
---
Worst update to Oldschool Runescape, sure.
---
I still argue that Skill Capes are what inherently ruined this game in the first place.
---
* 2006 Skill Capes introduced.
---
* 2007 Botting and gold buying goes insane.
---
* 10th Dec 2007/1st Jan 2008 Free Trade &amp; Wilderness removal.
---
Game is now all about 'efficiency' and getting 99s in useless garbage like Firemaking and Cooking.
---
I had someone the other day say nice untrimmed wc cape to me
---
Yeah that does sound pretty cool too
---
If I have to use the home tele I'll always walk to where no one can see me.
---
If it's at all an option to pay for membership via IRL methods, consider that. 
---
At your levels you'd likely need to invest some decent playtime to grinding something out to maintain your next bond. Time that could be better spent exploring the game (during which you'll gain stats that will allow you to make GP more efficiently) rather than running back and forth tanning hides or making planks all day every time you play.
---
That said, if you're really keen to not play IRL cash then you might check the following threads, this question comes up a lot and the answers are usually the same.

There‚Äôs a quest that requires lvl 50 btw. Guess you better save a few lamps.

Buffaloo soljaa, in thee heart of Falador

yeah fuck group ironman get this fixed asap
---
I have only once had somebody tb me first. But I still got away with a Tele. I'm typically very aware when I'm doing abyss running. So I check pkers levels when I see them and I just Tele if they are in range. I don't wait.
---
99% of them just snare or barrage or shoot me with a crossbow for some reason. Easy out. But this guy started with a Tele block at the same moment I teled. I had the tb message when I arrived back in edge lol.
---
Even still, I'm 90% sure I could have made it to the abyss before a snare anyway. Unless tb also blocks npc teleporting. Which, if I doubt it does. Because if it did, everybody would be tbing instead of nobody. 
---
Not sure how to react 
---
What's that hippo doing there
---
Farming ranarrs. Only takes 32 farming to get started
---
What if he's a Nigerian general who wants to put 30 million gp into my bank account?
---
Well, if they dont exist, our rev loot worth will drop, its just part of osrs life. 
---
Wettest man in Cambridge
---
Instantly, xp rates are faster in members with more places to train. There's no reason to wait. You will have much more fun on members worlds, f2p areas are always full of bots. 
---
I know its a joke, but Black Robe skirt for AH and black Plate Skirt for Verac - people actually use to scam like that back the day (before GE). They would be selling the set, but it would be a couple hundred K too cheap, so someone would click accept in a hurry and they sold 3 barrow items for the price of 4. 
---
mate, ur "loyal" and unreasonably attached to a wiki that:
---
a) is objectively outdated, even if you think its features are "adequate" -- let's keep using old shit even if new shit is better, even if only marginally.
---
b) is objectively inferior: you're supporting a morally ambiguous company that has no qualms about using the content YOU create for profit with intrusive, full screen, animated, and body-text ads. you also give up custom software solutions. checkboxes were just an example, but you're deluding yourself if you don't think it's a net improvement over the old wiki... and idk where u got a membership fee from, the new wiki is free LOL
---
c) brings you no return. you're not breaking up with your wife of 6 years, it's a website
---
anyway, i have no particular attachment to the old or new wiki, i just made this post to help ppl who've been complaining about half their pages being nieve lol
---
Needs a factorio version
---
the only ones i can sorta see being ok were the nmz and splashing nerfs. looking back being able to get xp for 6 straight hours without any user input was stupidly broken. the void and zulrah nerfs were meth while the recent bot integrity updates were downright stupid.
---
Why would they? The new RuneScape is way different than the one were playing. Changes on that game won't affect this one.
---
I'm happy for you, friend! I'm almost there myself. 
---
Get rid of most of it...
---
Those are acid eyes
---
Farming. Herb runs can be done every 50 minutes and can make 200k if you're a bit lucky. You do need to do a good amount of quests to unlock the herb patches though.
---
Hunter is decent money once you can do Chins.
---
Runecrafting is good money with nats
---
Smithing at Blast furnace is good if you unlock the coal bag from Motherlode mine.
---
Honestly, at low levels it's better to just buy membership. The 3m can be put to better use elsewhere, especially because it will take you 5+ hrs to make it back.
---
agreed on all counts. I actually wish there was a legacy server that was pre zulrah/void nerf
---
You're older.
---
I started at age 12 in 2003.  I didn't know how to change my attack style for two weeks, so I had 24 attack, 1 strength, 1 defense, and 18 prayer.  All I did was kill goblins, cut logs, light fires, and cook shrimp.  Walked to Draynor, fished a full invent of shrimp, cooked them, walked to lumby gobs, killed them until I ran out of food, walked back to Draynor bank and put all my loot there.  Rinse and repeat.  Then a friend took me to Varrock, bought me a Mithril Longsword and full iron.  He showed me how to change attack styles and took me to Varrock sewers.
---
In that time the second time around (started OSRS in May 2018), I'd hit 700 total, beat all f2p quests, and was starting to get some small time cash together.
---
Many more resources today for such an endeavor: youtubers, subreddits, guides, etc.
---
Just enjoy your two weeks of membership! Do some quests (Waterfall, Witches House,Grand Tree, Fight Arena) are some good ones to start with. Low levels cant really maintain a bond every two weeks without grinding hard multiple hours every day or spending most of your time making money(No XP) for the next two weeks where your stats will suffer.
---
Depending on the gear you can wear it does. 
---
So much salt lol go dude

Yeah, we acquired it the domain about a month ago.
---
Take a seat dear
---
We're now really past "dungeoneering" level of powercreep though.
---
I wonder how anyone can say a straight face that powercreep is "managed better" and then use a blowpipe + twisted bow in game.

I always wondered why my aunt was my uncle. It all makes sense now

Try runelite, silly man. 
---
Rather than creating multiple skill halls for different stuffed head trophies in POHs, could we see the head trophy display changed so that we can add multiple heads to the trophy space and configure which head we want to be shown? 
---
This would operate in a similar way to the boss lair display in the achievement gallery, which has a configure option.
---
Hey it's okay man you can talk to us 
---
Why didn‚Äôt you tele kbd?

Ouch, that hurts.

I'm honestly still a little annoyed that we have the G.E., though, so maybe I'm an extremist?

Pure essence used to be like 150ea and my sister mined it from level 1 (rune essence first) to something like level 65 exclusively. Made millions and had a maxed out friends list because of all the other people doing the same

Unfortunately college is a bitch and I wont be able to attend such a rare feat. However i wish to congradulate you beforehand on achieving something i am light-years from achieving. Congratulations and good luck with your future endeavors. Make us proud!
---
Now do it again.
---
Exactly so if the everyone times out they can just void any HCIM deaths that happened during that time. I'm sure somewhere on a Jagex server they have a console that says "request timed out 23:31" or something like that with a timestamp
---
Yup. But if you are someone who wants to rush Hydra boss day 1, you'd probably be the type to care about +3 Strength. Also, to do the Diary you'll need to do 2 new quests plus the diary itself, which would cut into Hydra time. Pretty much try to get and plant seed, then go to Hydra until it is grown instead of expecting to complete Diary to bring Prims to Hydra.
---
That's not an ahrim's skirt! That's an addy bed!
---
The Rise of the red axe quest line is also incomplete, but in my opinion it has a much more depressing cliffhanger. The last thing we see our character had his memory wiped after witnessing the creation of chaos dwarves, and then he is made the laughingstock of keldagrim. For all we know the bad guys got away with it and it made me die a little inside when I completed it. There isnt much for gear, but its still a quest line Id like to see completed.
---
No, they are 36m. 
---
btw

I see it‚Äôs from boss but they drop the same vissy -_-

I hardly think a few questions constitutes "spamming" a thousand questions. Nothing I am doing is preventing people from asking their own questions.

Thank you for your feedback!

That‚Äôs a bug? Thank god I thought I was alone and the absolute worst at clicking it. Jagex pls help us

Make 10k nats every day for a week and youll have enough for a few bonds
---
Totally buy a bond, you'll have a lot more content to explore and of course better ways to make money to sustain membership. 
---
What should you do? Questing is a good start as it'll force you to explore new areas. You'll get some useful xp as well as unlock areas for new monsters or skilling. 
---
Some ideas for money making can be found in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9jrfpe/money_making_rates_guide/). Prices may no longer be accurate, but it'l lgive you some ideas of what you can do. Blast Furnace is a popular method as it's relatively low requirements for the amount of money you can make per hour. 
---
Good luck!
---
can confirm, just used his guide for that yesterday. absolutely painless thanks to him
---
but....why would you have to do this? 
---
I suppose that gives me an excuse to do lunar diplomacy as well
---
from what ive seen explained in multiple threads the same people running the new wiki no longer have access to the old one, and the people running the old one right now get ad revenue so thats prob why it doesnt go down.
---
I can count to 24, dear mother of god.

I‚Äôve been clean for about a year but the call is still there. I‚Äôve played since 2003. 
---
I don't see the upside, its a lot more intensive, lower kph, and less profitable than camping, even if you facetank.
---
Germans the worst for me.... eastern seaboard. :(
---
no its because the guard rotation has no real logic to it, there are many situations where it's impossible to continue.
---
I'd say its easier due to the massive QoL happening naturally. You can find any information you want easily now. 10 year old me didn't know the best places to level or how to boss effectively. The GE helped a lot as well since I ducked at merching.
---
It's also easier because I'm older and have two monitors. Netflix and osrs.
---
If you have the option of semi-AFKing, I high alch for money/mage exp.
---
First I earned a few mil by playing the game (making and selling cannon balls, running dragon bones for people praying, buying and selling death runes, etc. Stuff that takes effort and is slow).
---
Then I invested that in black d'hide bodies and nature runes. So now I often buy 500 dhide bodies and nature runes at a time, put them in my inventory (noted) at the same spot the high alch spell is, equip a fire staff, and then just click the screen in that one spot over and over while I do other stuff (watch tv, eat food with my other hand, I work from home so that too, etc.) I get like 100k every 30min maybe? Plus a shit ton of mage exp. 
---
Only issue the GE buy limit for black d'hide bodies is 70 (you can buy 70 every four hours). So to get enough for a bond would take several days to acquire. But honestly I just combine several different money making methods to keep life interesting.
---
2-3 hours a day isn't that bad I think.
---
Is the flax method afk as well? Or just the cannonballs? (And also, if it's that afk could I just leave my game on all day while I'm at work or something while I make them?)
---
How many times did you appeal the same account ? 
---
I didn't mean to come across as condescending. It's hard to put tone into my posts, and I'm sure I could of worded it better to not have you feel that way, so I apologize. Overall my point is that if you are literally comparing two things and the only thing that makes them different is they are free, take the free option. Obviously I don't mean pirating.
---
Runelite also has more features then OSbuddy as well as a better GPU plugin, last time I used OSbuddy OpenGL it was laggy and didn't work very well. Runelite's GPU plugin day one worked insanely well.
---
Can we PLEASE get some more AU servers, their always crowded
---
Hate to say this but you must not have checked the world you died in. It would have been there for an hour
---
Don't break the rules homo
---
Why are the karamja gloves 3 the only piece of the hard diary set that aren't the same color scheme?
---
lol? its more profitable because you dont use food? and a hole lot easier to double claw spec it then finish it with whip tele heal repeat. Most people dont like flinching it 
---
I love how everyone that plays has Reddit... I was helping out a noob and the next day I log on and some dude recognizes me
---
also because there is a shit ton of magic xp to be had while getting quest cape 
---
Don't give Torvesta any ideas.
---
Pls don't make me lose 50m for this :(
---
Glassblowing, really chill and reasonable exp (without having to muck around with selling to the GE/alching). 
---
I just made the best thing at whatever level all the way to 99.

---

---
I suggest you delete this post and deal with Jagex. You're gonna get bullied here.
---
Because rs3 sucks
---
Your other post says "[removed]" so it's probably hidden as it breaks the subreddit rules about crying over a ban.
---
But given the title and this thread I assume you were banned for botting.
---
Feeding an addiction aint healthy. I‚Äôll voice my disapproval over it (and other addictions) as the whole point of society is to help our race live as long as possible
---
Things like stealing creation, FOG, Summoning, dungeoneering, w/e won't be added to the game, as of the backup date that was used to create osrs none of this exists in the code, Mod Ash has stated this before as well as saying that they would need to be polled as well as made from scratch which would require an insane amount of work, they have a heavy work load (mobile, kelos, hydra etc) the time and effort it would require to add this type of content would be wasted on things they could do to better the game (new content and fixes).
---
tl;dr RS3 has a fixed screen legacy mode for a reason.
---
Fletching guild is Seers/Yanille bank tyvm.
---
To clarify, we don't have our old admin tools which allow us to quickly undo vandalism. These tools were removed from us by Wikia staff due to "inactivity".
---
The paid Wikia STAFF (not admins, there's a difference), who still make tons of ad revenue off the corpse of our years of hard work there, don't care about the actual content, as long as it's not being vandalised, as you've witnessed the moment we left the old site and yesterday with the whole Nieve shenanigans.
---
rip 6m
---
Better start over. It‚Äôs xp waste to complain on reddit. 
---
I switch from blackjacking to ardy knights at 96 thieving and (although I didn't do the math) thought knights were more gp/hr. This could be because at 95 you stop failing knights but still fail blackjacking. 
---
What is the best way to take advantage of the free week of membership (mobile)?
---
I was wondering if I should use the week to find a good money making method to buy a bond. 
---
Moral of the story, dont account share
---
Are you 24 irl
---
eh, not really. most people don't know that your weight affects the chance of falling at the end. With 48 agility and summer pies you can very easily do the quest in less than 40 minutes. I've done it like 6 or 7 times at that level, never once has it taken me longer than that.
---
This just happened to me as well! Congrats brother
---
Sorry for your lose
---
he's quit but still needs people to know he was  "#7 mOsT eFfIcIeNt tO mAx". Which being #7 in is kind of irrelevant anyway.
---
Thanks for your kind words, ya son of a gun
---
It really do be like that though.

He‚Äôs already PMing his mates to get this set up
---
So flax has you run from lumbridge castle bank down one floor to the spinning wheel. Then you get like 60-70 seconds of afk time as it makes all 28 at once, then you run up deposit the inventory and repeat. 
---
If you have 1 agility and don't want to get 30 you'll just need a regular energy potion every like 6 runs to make sure you can still run, so that inventory will only be 27 flax. A regular energy potion is about 700gp for a 4 dose so it won't cut into your profit by much, 1000 flax maybe needs 3 of them tops at 1 agility. 
---
Any agility above 1 is amazing, so knocking out 30 the first chance you get is a good plan. Agility scales very well early on so much so that the first 30 levels are way stronger then 60-90. You also keep this agility bonus in F2P if you ever get de-bonded for a while.
---
To overall answer your question as long as you can check your phone every 60 seconds you can do flax. Cannonballs is every 3 minutes. So you could do flax at home and Cannonballs once you earn 300k. 500 steel bars is more then enough to start out. You will sell that 300k of steel bars for 420k and be able to buy 750, ect. repeat
---
So instead of 60 times an hour you interact 20 times an hour. Probably better for work.
---
I'll also link a post I made on my other reddit account last month
---
I'm sure it has been said but I'll make it nice and formatted:
---
* Birdhouse Run's a few times a week. Do as many as comfortable
---
* Slayer Tasks. 60-80 Is a lot of fun on Slayer because you unlock some of the juiciest tasks.
---
* Farming. You're only a few levels off some good herbs. Do Fairy Tale Pt. 1 for the Magic Secateurs if you haven't. Cacti &amp; Bushes are consistent money makers not often talked about.*Also Seaweed*
---
* Agility, those crystals are like 13k or so a pop rn and you can easily make 1-300k an hour just getting some levels.(76 is a good level to shoot for future content aka Zulrah)
---
* Nature Rune Crafting. Tried and true, up to you if you enjoy it or not.
---
* Wintertodt. Your fire making level is low and getting even to 90 will make some okay money to do other stuff.
---
* Just high alch stuff with good returns. Slayer is an easy way to amass a lot of alchables without dealing with the constant need to check ratio's on ge-tracker.
---
E: I forgot the more braindead option(s). Those are Achievement Diaries. So Pure Essence from Ardy and Battlestaves from Varrock.
---
Then you have the minigame NMZ which for 150k points a day is roughly around 150k in herbs, sometimes way more, sometimes slightly less.
---
And Quest rewards, so off the top of my head you have Bert who gives buckets of sand everyday.
---
All this adds up so that over the 14 days of a bond you will get the bond back with just daily content and like an hour of cannonballs every day your bond is active.
---
lmao
---
One of them defense pures 
---
what is this post holy. bring it to support bud. 
---
&gt;  He made all accounts because back then 
---
It's not your account, it's his. 
---
Make a new one that is yours and start over. 
---
But you already knew that. You're just in denial and desperate because of the time you put into the account. 
---
You need to get over it an move on. 
---
It was macroing, but I was using RuneLite, was talking to people, and responding to messages, so idk.
---
You do realise these pip up all the time even if you ban one 4 more will appear 
---
I think ive seen this same thread every day for the last 3 weeks. Why do people feel the need to post everytime they do low tier content smh.
---
Fuck 330, by far the laggiest world on OSRS. 
---
You very well could have paid close to 600k for one, but they‚Äôve never been close to valued at that. Definitely not within the past few days anyway
---
Literally just open Netflix or YouTube then hit the home button. Should window it like that. Then just launch the osrs app
---
Could Runelite fix this?
---
the anatomy on this is FUCKED LOL
---
BEGONE BOT 
---
no lol you have it confused with some other item. you have always been able to buy a granite body from BA for 95k so it would never go above that
---
http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/Granite_body/viewitem?obj=10564
---
Are you sure? Looks like it peaked around 115k, I doubt it would go up to 600k since you can buy one for 95k
---
I never said he was, but dumping an item then buying the dip to dump again is price manipulation. The robber barons used to do this back in the early 20th century 
---
The old macintosh (in the 68k days, so the 80s/early 90s) had something like that where in a courtroom they could pull up a screen saying something like "this is a stolen copy of mac OS."
---
Well you see runelite have open gpu thingy pretty much uses ur g card, makes things plus 60 fps and you can see the world with little no lag

Great meme cause true lmfao

I remember back when this didn't exist, it was such a pain in the ass lol
---
That 5 times lower rate that they talked about on the q&amp;a stream was about the slayer monsters in the karuulm dungeon. They said nothing about the dragon warhammer being rarer off-task for the molch shamans.
---
Yeah I dunno how I feel about the update. They did a good job with it, but it doesn't feel like runescape. Runescape skills, in my mind, should be something really straight forward. The fact that they need any introduction whatsoever on the new smithing interface makes me dislike it. I mean, it's not complicated, it's just not stupid obvious.
---
Also, I am really disappointed that this update took them as long as it did.
---
Absolutely get 82 construction, ornate pool and fairy ring in your house, and 76 agility. Will undoubtedly result in a bigger increase in kills/hour as opposed to the imbued heart. Lumbridge elite diary lets you use fairy rings without a dramen staff but that's not totally necessary. 
---
I hate it. 
---
lmfao the glory adds a nice touch
---
O kurwa
---
1 week is a real stretch for a new player (or someone that dosen't play 10 hours a day) to get a bond. 
---
This thread has some answers and I posted a comment with a lot of links to other threads that you can check out: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/adpe17/how_to_maintain_a_bond_as_an_inexperienced_player/

You can look up blast furnace for a fairly easy req for a petty good moneymaker.

Get to 28 (I think) range and get the Dorgeshuun xbow. Cheap ammo and works well until level 61 range.

How will dropping items lead to bring scammed?

Alch yourself.

They asked Runelite to remove a deobfuscator from the repo, as that could be used to view the game's code in a reader way.
---
There should be a public chat filter to not display autochat text. It‚Äôs rarely used for anything legit outside of the sand casino 
---
Bro that's a ahrims bed.
---
MSB spec on Karil? Is it recommended to range him?
---
Ideal shirt of the year 
---
Alch yourself
---
Third party clients are a game changer.
---
That‚Äôs actually... a perfect solution. 
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
its managed better because whips and d boots arent down to alch price. sure blow pipe just blows everything else put of the water, but tbow isnt bis for everything, and so a super rare reward from high tier pvm, I think its justified. the game would be extremely boring if all the bis items were 200k and easily accessible within the early game
---
You can make you're banking more efficient even without spending money on your own POH. 
---
You're effectively banking twice every run when you don't need to and choosing to use a very slow fairy ring spot. 
---
You should be doing something like 
---
* Start at clan wars
---
* enter portal
---
* Teleport to fairy ring
---
* Use Fairy ring
---
* Pie up and cross shortcut
---
* Kill Zulrah (until out of supplies)
---
* Teleport back to clan wars
---
There's no need to bank your pie or staff, the time it takes isn't worth the inventory space saved. 
---
And as for fairy rings you can teleport to, here are some options
---
* [Salve graveyard](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Salve_graveyard_teleport)
---
* Slayer ring to Rellekka caves
---
* Quest cape
---
* POH, either your own or a host in 330 rimmington
---
---------------
---
&gt; Tormented bracelet (no switch)
---
&gt; Occult Necklace (no switch)
---
Change this. You are currently switching out blessed d'hide boots which only give +7 range attack. 
---
If you were switching the glove slot you would get +12 from barrows gloves. And switching the necklace slot would give you +10 from either a glory or a fury. 
---
Lol, I mean if you're planning to max it's more efficient to get 99 con out of the way early

It's based of the pre-eoc corporeal beast / pvm clan 'of the gods'. It logo was a divine sigil. John C also introduced a npc named 'sigilseeker' at the 2014 runefest event where players could test out their skills on corp. the npc would hand out gear / supplies needed to fight it.

Your character can get stuck behind a door or something, they could throw a gnomeball or other thing to you. You could get kicked out of an instance (if you're hosted at a house, if you're in a corp room?), they can drop a bunch of bullshit on-top of your items so you can't pick them up. They could DDOS your computer or the game-world? Items could appear instantly like in the wilderness.

A lot of those are parts of scams that involve a few steps and tricks.

Wait, it counts when you open but don‚Äôt search.

---
ya id do mage training stock the pts for bones to peachs and infinity boots things like that to purchase down the line when u need them
---
that has actually happened once to me way badck then not gonna lie 
---
I highly recommend doing as many quests as possible as early as possible. If theres any magic EXP quests you can do, get those done first. Inventory restrictions will make them harder later.
---
Otherwise, Magic training arena isn't the most efficient XP an hour, but you'll need to do it eventually to get Bones to Peaches, and Infinity Boots(if your willing to give up that space). Worth doing just for that.

I'll do it. Ops joke wasn't even a fucking pun

1) Can we some day perhaps get Great Orb Project in OSRS? Or perhaps another Runecrafting minigame?
---
2) Would you consider giving Sailing or Artisan another shot in the future? The OSRS team and the community have both changed since those polls.
---
Is it even finished in RS3 like Fairy Tale is? 
---
Actually came here to say this. Got tricked into what I thought was sparc Mac stream and lost 150m bank just tonight due to being hacked. GG scammers (mainly my fault for being an idiot). Be so very cautious on the links you click, and make sure you know what Jagex will and will not ask you for (2fa/bank pin, etc).

Cycles? Probably. That would just be some sort of in-game clock; it wouldn't even need to persist over updates. Visually there would likely be more of an issue... You wouldn't really see the sky change since black void and all. Perhaps it could automatically move your brightness slider if you opt into it, but that would be pretty lackluster for such an update.
---
Gameplay wise it would be problematic. It would depend on the length of the cycles, but either way, it just limits content. If a shop only opens at night, you're stuck waiting for it to open and it may not open when you play. Or if a creature takes more damage at night, you'd likely find players would avoid killing it during the day since it would be harder than if they waited. Still, it is a neat idea, but it is tricky finding a design that is worth the effort.

I've seen this question before and the answer was a hard no. Having basically a limitless source of HP stackable in one item is problematic and they are only really OK with it because it is such a high cost.

i was at the GE trying to make the most of like the 150 iron ore I mined when I heard some guy begging for cash.   I told him that doesn't work when all of the sudden some guy gave me 50k, his rune pickaxe, and showed me the iron ore location under falador.  That's when I was level 3.

At what point should I unlock "Like A Boss" boss slayer? I'm quite comfortable doing bosses like Zulrah, Vorkath, KQ, Guardians, ... and I enjoy doing them, but I'm unsure about some of the wildy bosses and GWD for slayer tasks. Should I just go for it?
---
Stats: att/def 83, str 90, pray 71, ranged 89, magic 85, hp 91.
---
Im 50 con right now and saving up for 83. It‚Äôs about 20m in oak planks for the larders. No idea how much the demon butler will cost for the grind but i‚Äôm guessing around another 2m. So around 22m and i think about 10-15 hours and you‚Äôll be done. Nice milestone to slowly grind to overtime.

I doubt that's a 1 year ban

I'd like a re-work. By the time I reach 90+ smithing, I'm probably going to have way better gear available beyond Rune; even more significant with Ironmen.

No, but setting the loot filter notification to 1gp shows (most) everything.

Thats night in Europe, something like 4pm or 5 pm est would mean more people can join, since theres more players from western Europe than from the Middle East

You're speaking with emotions instead of your brain. Calm down, recollect, and realize that your emotions are clouding your judgement.

Are them iron legs or granite? I suppose granite would make sense and he hasn't completed dragon slayer but can't afford the granite body. If it's iron legs and adamant plate, well he's truly wiser then he seems, I imagine it helps him use less food while doing agility.

I'd drop it in Fally party room and post to Reddit and OSRS forums before doing it.

There's probably way more than 11 people here who are asking for a whip.

Hey everyone! I'm interested in OSRS but I'd like to know what exactly people like about this game? I'd love to get multiple view points to see if it's a game I think I'd enjoy. Really looking for a solid MMO with both good PvE and PvP, and even though I never expected OSRS to have fun PvP I have heard good things! So tell me, why do you enjoy the game?

Is that the dude from we‚Äôre the millers

My suggestion, get level 99 morphine addiction

So is a good practice to get basically main skills to 50 or so before actually getting into membership?

The mobile data is pretty low amount used, as for membs its the same situation alot more to do than F2P

You indeed remember correctly. Home teleport was released on September 27, 2006.

Amazing that really makes me happy !!

The game isn‚Äôt really worth it long term without membership and it uses barely any mobile data. Not sure of the exact figures but it‚Äôs less than 5mb/hour

I would recommend doing alot of the f2p skills and getting (skilling skills) anywhere from 40-50+, i say this as someone who fished to 68 in karamja before heading to the fishing guild, I was able to obtain bond money within the 14 day period and actually expand in content. definitely try and get some high combat stats too, it will make a lot of the membership quests easier. I would highly recommend at least attempting to do most of the free to play quests as well. Some of them are requirements to other members quests. In the end the playstyle is up to you. I like doing what i can and mostly afk skilling and funding more membership time so i can play in my downtime when im not working.

Being able to efficiently train agility at seers requires :

70 fletching

70 fishing

70 defense

---
75 Smithing
---
In addition to DT (and all prereqs), King's Ransom (and all prereqs), and Fairy Tale part 2 (up to rings)
---
Sure, you can plan an account around these obstacles and get these prereqs before even training the skill, but that's an unreasonable assumption IMO. 99% of player are not going to do that, even if they plan on maxing the account some day.  If you're gonna assume people have enough cash to run lavas at 23 RC, or they'll get serious about fishing and smithing before agility, one of the most useful skills in game, you're crazy.

Its value is artificial though, propped up by alch value. The fact that RS3 solves it by replacing item drops with junk that alches for the same amount shows it.

Im always changing the price per item up and down to try and buy a stack of items using all the gold in my inventory, it could be a lot easier if we could adjust the total price when buying multiple items instead of just changing the price per item,   the total price could round down or up from the number u enter if it does not  add up with the amount of items you're trying to buy and the price per item.

Can we poll Ancient multi combat spells to be 50% weaker on single combat areas, this would include barrages and bursts. This would only allow brids to use blitz on single combat areas while forcing the strongest spells to be used only at multi areas.

There's quite a bit of buyable skills that are hard to Max without loads of cash, plus a lot of new players joining who aren't just greedy beggars so I'd have to disagree. But if a total world was used at least choose 1250 or 1500  to at least give newer people a chance

i remember seeing this meme on zybez many many years ago, before osrs or even rs had a subreddit, there would be loads of edits like this hidden away on rs fansite forums, lots of "signature" edits as well that people used to have below each one of their posts - i think people used to buy the images for rsgp and they would have a lot of drawings, custom pixel art or animations in them

Ok√© so while i don't exactly know the mechanics i do know the no dupe mechanic was introduced for outfits similar to pyromancer to prevent people from getting 500 tops before obtaining a bottom. The first outfit that got this treatment (the lumberjack outfit) just gave you a piece you missed instead. 
---
So i'm pretty sure pyromancer would work the same. I guess you're just getting unlucky

This is legit funny. It's the next day ahaha

What's this on CoX you mentioned?

I don't feel any sense of happiness or accomplishment doing anything in this game anymore...

Keep them. Once you have 3 then any more rolls for that item are changed to a more useful item (I want to say magic seeds for gloves but I really am not 100% sure off hand).

Is it possible to boost for an essence pouch from the abyss? Wiki doesn't mention yes or no that i have seen. Thanks

I hope that was a typo and you‚Äôre referring to myth cape, not legends for construction; otherwise you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time
---
That doesnt change my statement in the slightest but ok
---
Thanks! I didn't think it was. But I was still gonna get it eventually. Just didn't know if it was better to grab at the beginning of the grind. :)
---
Why are you doing the task there though? :/ It's probly much easier to get to Nieve's sex dungeon and do them there.
---
Keep going; it took me a lot of tries, too. You can do it!
---
So a couple of things, with the mining and smithing rework, it didn‚Äôt just end with rune being t40, in addition to that, the following stuff also happened. 3 new ores were added, each being able to make all the items from daggers to platebodies, rune item drop rates and alch value were changed (these were announced ahead of time), they were dropped more commonly, and their stats were changed to reflect their new position as a tier 40 item. 
---
One issue I see with adding new ores without changing levels is that the levels for smithing are saturated, if you add an ore that‚Äôs worse than adamant around levels 70-85 it‚Äôll be DOA while if it‚Äôs better than adamant it‚Äôll just kick adamant out. 
---
The rework wasn‚Äôt just a couple of changes here and there, they essentially rewrote the skills and a lot of drop tables from scratch. I would be cautious but not opposed to that given the smithing skill guide is written towards a time when rune platebodies were second BiS

Are you playing a regular account or an ironman? In my case I was playing regular and taking several month breaks at a time because I was burnt out. 
---
It wasn't until I made and progressed an ironman that I really got into the game. I havent felt burnt out and have been playing consistently with essentially no long term breaks for a couple of years now. I find it more relaxed to play ironman because hunting drops and gear becomes more goal oriented, wheras on regular accounts it's just how much money you can make you quickly and repeat and having to constantly worry about GE values and other nonsense. 
---
Not sure if it'll apply to you but figured I'd share.
---
Bots already sit there in w18 because it is unlikely that someone actually teles down.  Most of the time someone teles down is when they are doing slayer or losing aggro on the earth warriors as earth warrior pkers are less likely to check that world.

I have a normal account I must admit all I‚Äôve been doing is focussing on my cash stack for the longest time. Maybe time to ditch the regular and jump on the Ironman cause I feel the exact same way as you‚Äôve described it! 
---
Sorry, I never move, and won't start. I just watch runelites hp bars.
---
As someone who‚Äôs never attempted nor read up on the whole thing, can you stop before Jad appears?
---
Tbh he is right, I mean RealScape has survived 18 years and going strong, just be a waste when the people who know how to keybind, go to TrueScape and this game dies out.
---
Leave the new skills to MainScape.

10k upvotes? Was this supposed to be funny..

I bring a super combat, b ring, fire cape, and void melee helm just for the bgs spec. You should definitely tab if you don't hit high with the bgs (64) because it makes an insane difference to the fight. Also don't forget to turn on piety for it too. 
---
For the fight itself, my best recommendation is to try to avoid eating until he is doing a special attack. If your health is over the max hit (35 range, 30 mage) you should be attacking. Once you get frozen or are walking off the fireballs you will have plenty of time to heal up to full or restore your prayer

I‚Äôm grinding zulrah on my zerker(only acc) and I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out what the most efficient gear swaps are. I have basically max gear but no 3a or tbow.  I‚Äôve done two setups the first being full void with (trident of swamp, mages book, occult) to (bp, occult). The second setup full infinity (with tos, occult, and mages book) with tormented and doing a 6 way swap which is ancient d hide top and bottom,  anguish, Ava‚Äôs, bp, and barrows gloves. So far I prefer the second setup, but I‚Äôm wondering if there is a more efficient way to run this boss. If anyone has put a lot of zulrah time in and has some suggestions I would love to hear them. Also, my bank is only about 300m total so I don‚Äôt think 3a is an option unless I sell off other gear.
---
I love this lol
---
Even the creator of the old wiki has requested people to move to the new one so it would quicker start to show up in Google searches as the first result

---
Can we have the option to attach hoods to skillcapes? 
---
Classic hahah. I had the same issue.
---
I'm pretty sure the whole point of Konar is to somewhat prevent original methods like demonic gorillas. It helps balance the tasks since you have chance at extra loot and a lot of slayer points.
---
Give it a try! I hope it works out for you! If it helps I was crazy against the idea of even starting an ironman for the longest time, and the start of it can be a tad slow and grindy, but once you get to mid level content and eventually to bossing it's super fun and rewarding. I haven't played my regular account in a while and now the iron has kinda become the main for me, and I'm really enjoying the game more than I ever have. 
---
Dumb skill. Games gonna turn into rs3, become pay to win, and be fucking dumb again. If you want progressiveness go to fucking rs3. 
---
Why does it seem more fitting to RS3?
---
Not much more information so not much to sway my view. Though seeing the Gowers support it was somewhat notable.
---
Or it could be 15 hours or longer. And at this current point in time I don't want to grind that

Vanilla competitive servers was where it's at. No random crits, no random spread on shotguns and no bullshit new weapons

this is as far as i get, everything before is completed as well
---
Cons: Spade spawns get botted
---
I don't see how warding is connected to pay to win elements. If the devs didn't implement new things game will be dead. Else everyone would be playing runescape classic. Could you elaborate?
---
Could we please see an instance for the thermonuclear smoke devil similar to other bosses? Currently 99 slayer and going for the pet, and the amount of times I'm being crashed either by someone just d claw rushing, or during a bank is pretty absurd. We could pay Breive 100k outside of the cave 100k for our items back..
---
That's going to be my goal when I max in a few months. I just need to raid and farm Vorkath to make enough money for better gear. No chance I'm going to try it without T bow. With my lack of skills, it would just be supplies down the drain.
---
How do you plan to do it?
---
Which release are we talking about...? 
---
lol no. stop being so lazy and decant them on the herb guy
---
There‚Äôs nothing else there? Like everything is crossed out? Even the top? That‚Äôs very weird. You might‚Äôve forgot to talk to someone. Make sure you talk to everyone, the locked up gnomes, the one hiding outside, and the leader near the monkey king.
---
I am a casual. I like to play runescape because it is a fun video game. New content sounds like it adds more fun to be had. I like fun. I'm in support of new skills if they are fun.

If you are in combat, it doesn't work in the Wilderness, even if it was PvM combat. It took like 20 Anglers at Venenatis the other day to remember this...

When i die in pvm i try to hit the ??? As fast as posible, followed with "sorry lagg"
---
I know it's not going to happen, I just brought it up because it definitely had an effect on mining and smithing. Like the best way to get adamant and mithril gear was to buy it off of someone who can smith it. Now it's to buy it from the GE from someone who acquired it as a monster drop. So as a result, there is no profit for the people who level up smithing to those levels. And so he smithing skill becomes kinda useless to casuals and obv its connected to mining so that does as well.
---
All I said was the GE had an impact on the smithing skill.
---
!RemindMe 24 hours

Im sorry i probably should have put /s at the end of my post, this man is painfully unfunny
---
It‚Äôs ok
---
But loads of things can oneshot you in real life. Runescape is comparatively very safe, when you can simply heal up from damage with no long term effects. Jad might be the scariest thing in runescape, in the real world jad wouldnt be scarier than a carcrash, lightning strike, a bullet to the head or hundreds of other things.
---

Nah I only use void elite for melee and that's still only at Corp. Void is good for people who can't afford Arma or don't want that defence level. 
---
Oh for sure it's me lol I just might get better stats and gear to compensate
---
It seems as if everything that gets added to the game is community driven which is a great aspect of osrs today, I just feel like there's an element of surprise missing in terms of not knowing if a new boss, for example drops a new rare, high tier weapon without the community even knowing what it is? Will this always be the case? ( Returning player, not sure if this is the case but haven't seen it in the last 5 months) 
---
Sorry Corp and Raids but still.

It is likely being merched. Rich clans are hoarding it to hike up the price. This has happened before with the blowpipe.
---
Eh, they've had fuck-all in terms of decent updates for a while. 
---
Can't blame them for latching onto the first decent update they've had in ages.
---
So because it‚Äôs op and used everywhere it jumped in price by a mil after having a steady price for at least the last month? That‚Äôs a horrible explanation. It has something to do with the new content I‚Äôm just wondering what
---
Quest point cape.
---
Going for one gets all your stats to a really good baseline. Going for a quest point cape basically turns osrs into a single player game for like 100 hours, and beating it unlocks the multi player version of the game.
---
At least that's how I felt.

Oh damn really? I thought it was only pvp. I must‚Äôve been attacked by one of the green dragons on my way in. Thanks

Can the Library runecrafting method be addressed? It is significantly more xp/h than any other runecrafting method (basically making the entire skill obsolete), is made a bunch easier with additional plugins/add-ons to clients and doesn't involve actually crafting any runes.

But.. why..

Follow the same advice. Op's kc is not 830

What are xp rates there at different levels?
---
I didn't know that was a thing! I can't imagine the frustration of that on Jad. At least Zulrah is only a few mins of time, as opposed to 40mins ish build up to the boss 
---
Aside from the obvious addition of Kebos, the font size for locations changed. Also, the Kourend Houses are no longer called Houses. There are some new terrain details by the Shayzien Catacomb entrance, possibly existing barricades, and the Tower of Magic now has a floor. Also some changes by the old Kebos area like a new hunting spot, probably swamp lizards.

It isn't really that hard to break that XP/hour. Nearly every skill has EHP above that. All the buyables, Crafting/Construction/Herblore/Smithing/Fletching/Farming range from 350k to 2m xp an hour, things like Cooking/Firemaking/Thieving are 250k-350k, etc. If you're actively playing the game, XP comes pretty easily.

you should do knights sword and get that smithing skill up first son!

I don't have a problem with helping people, and would love to see these people dealt with, but it's not as easy as you make it out to be. If someone won't listen to the multiple sources of good advice readily available to them, and they won't take the steps to secure their account, then they aren't going to be swayed by a news post.
---
As i understand it, 2fa on your account prevents someone from gaining access to your stuff, and 2fa on your email prevents someone from removing that protection. It's a slight inconvenience to set up, but it's a very effective method of keeping people off of your account. Again, if someone won't use these freely available  security measures, what makes you think that a news post will help them?

The granite dust is what makes it worth it imo. And the pet is the sickest one in the game.
---
Have you completed death to the dorgeshhun so you can use tbe bone crossbow spec?
---
What option did you enable to show you had an untradeable drop? Also gratz! Have 3 totems so far, too afraid to try him 
---
Why?
---
lmao it's so weird how this comment is upvoted but OP's is downvoted. OP never claimed it was OC and only said they didn't know whether it had been on this sub before.
---
741 checking in, congrats on your loot and better name!
---
4Head wow you‚Äôre probably right! 
---
Shut up pussy.

Back in about mid summer i only had around 1.65b which was not enough to buy everything I wanted. I was also not really playing much due to having so much but not enough so i said fuck everything and yolo chucked 1.65b and decided if i lost i would quit (was hoping that would happen tbh .__.). But that didn‚Äôt happen and i walked away with 3300k in plat tokens, 3.3b. Since then i bought all the buyable 99s and the gear I wanted. Keep in mind back in like February i built all the way to 1.2b and then staked 4-5 times and lost all of it so i guess this time i got extremely lucky and got back what i lost plus more
---
&gt;You literally gain nothing but ranks that the average person doesn't care about 
---
You can end your sentence here. The average person has never played runescape and couldn't care less about anything in the game at all. Keep it in perspective though- we're on the runescape sub and we're all rs players. 
---
If you have prayers

But don't forget about Mermaid storage unit, which only lasted two weeks!

---

---
i agree its a very useful skill i just personally find it the worst to train.
---
OSRS he cant believe you said that OSRS
---
Finishing the Inferno, shit was difficult.
---
Same as you just outlined. Tbow is a must. Once that is acquired then I will be studying "how to inferno guides" and making attempts to learn inferno mechanics. I dare say it will take me over 250 attempts but who knows, probably more lol. 
---
As much as you guys love to bash on RS3, I really recommend listening to the RS3 soundtrack. It's actually really good.
---
Still would vote no cuz the current state of warding looks like trash
---
I guess so
---
Talk to garkor again, make sure you COMPLETE the conversation with him without clicking out anywhere, he is the one that instructs you to visit zuccnucc so if you don‚Äôt complete the conversation with him the quest can‚Äôt continue.
---
It gives +4 strength. That‚Äôs straight up +1 max hit.
---
Damage is almost always better. Warrior has some extremely niche uses but that‚Äôs about it.
---
Hey man i struggled like you before. Im guessing your problem is jad not the waves before it because there is plenty of guide on how to avoid damage in almost every wave. Anyways if your problem is jad i suggest you to try killing it on a private server that doesnt have waves but had jad directly. It is a good practice for prayers switches and healers and it doesnt take time and doesnt cost you gp on supplies and other stuff. 
---
A few hours after I whacked it yeah it was devastating to the towels on the rack, luckily it wasn't my towel tho
---
Nieve
---
Bruises do that.
---
How often do you kill any of those monsters though? And literally every skill besides combat ones have nothing to do with champ scrolls?
---
I think it's pretty conceptual stage still. There should be updates on it very soon
---
Nice work mate and thank you. Keep on grinding!
---
yeah honestly thats fair af. I do like that aspect too, I would say that fishing is my least favorite skill just because its afk but soooo slow, so i can see where hes coming from.
---
how would people know? magic?
---
the only proof youre gonna be able to see is him admitting his dishonesty.
---
probably wont happen
---
Cheers!
---
Did you make the unfinished potion first or are you just using red spiders eggs on a restore?
---
DS2 is more boss fight focused. There are some puzzles, but they generally aren't too bad, at least with a guide. The hardest one is a literal puzzle so if you don't know what it is supposed to look like it is pretty rough but there is no rush to it. The Boss Fights in DS2 are some of the toughest in the game, at least for quest bosses.
---
MM2, on the other hand, is more about puzzles if you'd call them that. Stuff like running through a maze of mobs or sneaking around avoiding detection. Guides will only help so much, especially for the stealth part, so you could say that makes it harder than DS2. The fights can be pretty taxing, but they have safespots and they aren't very challenging.
---
The My Arm quests have some the most deadpan humor of them all.
---
Yes dad :)
---
I think +15 for a staff with as low requirements as a mystic staff is a bit much. Of all staves with +15 or more magic attack, the ancient staff is arguably the most accessible.
---
How about giving the BATTLEstaff improved melee stats, and mystic staves +12 magic attack?
---
Your joke doesn't make any sense
---
Yea I seen it. Dunno where it is though.
---
No worries, I thought I had been missing a trick and was about to facepalm.
---
VM is like 85k and MLM is like 50-55k. Dont know about each level.
---
Lmao My favourite one :p
---
84 agil for rev south jump
---
agreed, top 3 pets imo for sure. 
---
For me doing ds2  boss was a pain for my zerk acc. But the mm2 took me 4-6hr that top puzzle part f me over 
---
I‚Äôve heard the you need the talisman to get the tablet but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true or not. I also have a friend who went over 50 dry so he may just be unlucky 
---
Now now, the videos kinda depends on your ad profile, so if you search for that stuff usually or visit sites like those, you get those.
---
use rubellite, make a bank tag for all (4) potions and food and use that instead. you'll still have a messy default potions tab, but just decent all your pots whenever you're at the GE and for the most part your rubellite tab will be clean and neat.
---
Sparc mac is trash, rest of those are great suggestions
---
Triggered bot ^ 
---
Lmao, thank you for the welcome bro!
---
Runecrafting cosmics will make you some alright GP, otherwise do some wildy slayer until 55 Slayer(you'll make more GP than reg Slaying at those levels) then get 43 Prayer and take Slayer Dart to Barrows until you make banks.
---
I'm not even sure tbh but I changed it on desktop when I started my account. I wouldn't be afraid, he's one of the easiest bosses in the game. You could always just pray against mage and use a blowpipe/cb the whole fight
---
Maybe mole? 
---
I just logout and do something IRL instead of walking 
---
I'll stay in the world to anti crash you and neither of us will get the loot (:
---
That's what I was thinking but a few trusty randoms at the GE said no way

My friends all are veterans and have told me get base 80 combat stats and I‚Äôm good to do about everything, even raids 1. 
---
With the alchemical hydra supposedly having loot comparable to Vork and Zulrah, is the 07 team continuing to strive toward improving resource gathering from skilling vs. PvM? I ask because SlayerScape is unhealthy for the game, and updates like the birds nest rebalance could benefit other materials like logs/ore.
---
Speaking of, is Jagex at all researching the possibility of removing say logs from all drop tables, and increasing the gathering rate for things like magic logs? (Even with doubled gather rates the xp. Gain won't be meta)

Really if you have torso/nezzy/d legs and a d scim you could probably do it, though a duo would be better.

What about prayer? Its a must have

Alright tyty :)

I'm wanting to start a HCIM. I've found a few guides but are there any in particular I should avoid or that you rate extremely highly?

To be fair, anything anyone ever does for fun is a waste that won't mean anything when they die. 
---
Playing osrs, or going to the beach, or playing football won't really mean much when you die. It's still fun. No need to try and ruin other people's fun. It sounds like you are depressed.

Assuming Mole Nests give the new seeds because they are a different type of nest from the standard Birds Nests...

Shut up worse-than-serene

Bud, im level 102 amd still havent done it. I got 80+ attack and 70 pray. Anything more than pest control is too much
---
That's what I'm doing right now and I feel like it's a mistake but I've already got 100k blood runes so I'm in too deep
---
Okay 85k is a lot. But 50k at mlm sounds too high... I might be wrong, and Im not 99 mining yet, but I thought it maxed at 40k. If its 55k I agree it's too much.

Yew birdhouses give 1020 hunter xp each. 
---
Every 50min your 4 birdhouses will give you 4080 xp. 
---
If you assume a run takes about 2 minutes, then your exp/hr is around 120k xp/hr.
---
Mostly keep grinding. It will be worth it to start bossing with 70 range. You could do KBD with a friend or two now though.
---

Is using the sulliuscep world faster for xp than using another world for wc xp?
---
From what I've read, they basically told the admins to fuck off and won't do anything about vandalism on pages on the site. So the admins of the wikia have created the new wiki
---
All high tier seeds are usually obtainable from mole part bird nests.
---
Don't give up keep trying! If you keep getting further and further stick with your strat, if it's not comfortable try another! You got this. 
---
wtf
---
Same as you just outlined. 
---
Tbow is a must. Once that is acquired then I will be studying "how to inferno guides" and making attempts to learn inferno mechanics. 
---
With new items like the sanguinesti staff it might make inferno that bit easier but for somebody that is still learning inferno the difference might be minimal. 
---
None the less I will acquire all BIS gear and then start making attempts. 
---
Wyverns, maybe? Just till you have enough to do Zulrah and whatnot.
---
I would de-iron though.
---
Can guardian boots work alongside granite boots for the new slayer area? 
---
The problem with Enchanting as a name is that enchanting jewelry is already under Magic, which would be confusing.
---
Good Riddance 
---
If they were tradeable I'd give you as much as you want. I've got hundreds. 
---
Drop-trade possible I wonder? 
---
Molten glass or cut emeralds/rubies/diamonds.
---
Oldschool Runescape.
---
Would eventual profits be worth me cannoning to 70? Or should i take the slow route for less money
---
Yep, almost everything in this game is duoable.
---
So say you want to do the diary that requires you to kill thermonuclear smokedevil (western province elite iirc, could be wrong idk)
---
In order to kill the boss normally you have to be assigned a slayer task telling you to do so, either the boss itself under boss task or a smokedevil task. However, for the sake of completing the diary, jagex lets you kill it one time without being assigned a task. For example, my task could be dagonnoths, i run in and kill thermy once, the task unlocks, and then i‚Äôm unable to kill it a second time because i don‚Äôt have the smoke devil task
---
I think they‚Äôre going to do something similar and not require a totem for one kill, but then every kill
---
thereafter will require it 
---
What's the story here?
---
as man who had the weekend to grind - 100% waking up - brewing a coffee, rolling a nice blunt - and going fishing. Then when you can - barbarian fishing for sweet str and agi XP my dude.  
---
happy Toking from a fellow Ent
---
Test it with range pray melee bring a few prayer pots , bring a teleport just in case 
---
I mean theres like two choices that are wrong...
---
Everything else works fine
---
It was just a though. But you can enchant other things that jewelry. 
---
Yes please.
---
Okay i got mine without tally. So then hes just unlucky then. Was looking for something along those lines of someone went 50+ dry.
---
I'd recommend just doing Slayer and get your levels through that. Cannon any Slayer tasks worth cannoning (look up which ones)
---
Not my fault you can't figure it out
---
I second this. I wish to know the lad's name.
---
"Boo! No new content. I want to be done with this game!"

I only have mobile atm - as my PC is out of commission - 10/10 love playing it in bed for an hour a night :)
---
Normal antidragon shield is better.  Dhcb&gt;bp&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything else

pretty sure the vandalism happened after the admins launched the new wiki, and staff removed their admin rights out of spite right before it happened
---
Ironman BTW the way
---
???? I did not ask you, I asked OP. Who tf are you
---
I believe West said that after Hosidius, he wants to do Arceuus and Lovakengj, but doesn't have big rework plans for Shayzien and Piscarillius.

You can but then you lose out on +3 strength bonus and defense bonuses. It all comes down to whether spending that extra cash is worth it or not for granite boots.

‚ÄúCome back‚Äù from ‚Äúthis‚Äù? What‚Äôs ‚Äúthis‚Äù? Where‚Äôve you gone? Don‚Äôt let randoms dictate value to you‚Äî you have no reason to believe that they‚Äôre anything but inbred sheep until they‚Äôve proven themselves to be otherwise.

If you want to make a bit of profit and get some magic xp you could superglass make.
---
If you want more xp, make the glass you make into orbs. Won‚Äôt profit though.

If you want even more xp, charge the orbs and put them on battestaves. I think you‚Äôll profit then.
---
93 mining w/o varrock top
---
Ew
---
guess we will see you in a few months then again
---
The thing is, even naked people can have dragon bones on them so it can make sense to take the 10 seconds to kill them for potential loot 
---
&gt; It was like a .01% chance of it taking that long
---
Not in line of what's accepted. The decisive probability of receiving any outcome in the game is 50/50.
---
Of course it does, want to share these statistics of RealScape having more bits than LeechScape?
---
your statement is true but only because OP already admitted to it, so I don't really see why it was relevent. not totally having a go at you either, just thought it was more weird OP was downvoted.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they announced bird house nests and mole nests do not give new seeds
---
Yep.
---
I believe it is halberds and spears that do full damage. Or are you referring to something other than those?
---
Air battle staves are about 5gp/xp and a little over 300k xp an hour.

---
I'm not near my pc to check right now, but I will let you know. 
---
I just got him yesterday on try #4. Use the fight cave rotation guide on the wiki and watch a video of prayer flicking against jad. 
---
There's a couple long videos out there where the guy just flicks for like 15 minutes. Watch it and call out which prayer you need to use. Stand next to an altar and flick along. Getting to jad isn't that bad and once you get the flicks down it's just killing the healers.
---
Yew get some logs
---
Ad infinitum 
---
&gt;  and any information on there could be (very) wrong.
---
Valid examples? Never noticed any false information on there in the past. This seems to for the most part be made up.
---
Yeah, the salary consists of 14 tendies and a gallon of mnt. Dew a day
---
Shut up

Could you send me the github link to Jad plugin for Runelite? Assuming you still have it, of course. It would be greatly appreciated.

---
Air orbs
---
Can we add a check uses for Achievement Diary items? The only way to currently see how many you have left is use the item, and while it appears in chat, if you log out that number is lost.
---
You'll get em rather quickly if you can get into raids. Other than that just farming shamans is your best bet. Don't forget you can dismantle spare talismans for more fangs
---
Yes something hidden, apparently hasn't been discovered according to devs. 
---
Chucked 300m before raids 1 to afford arma and dwh. Lost of course and I just recently built back up to a 300m bank again.

Hey man, trust me. I‚Äôm pretty decent stats for Jad, I think I‚Äôm at least base 75 for all of my combat stats except for prayer and I couldn‚Äôt even get to Jad in 3 attempts lol
---

man i'd work for that!! SIGN ME THE FUCK UP!
---
&gt;can't play without yellow squares
---
maybe actually enjoy the game along the way???????
---
&gt; in the past.
---
Exactly.
---
Your stance here is just asinine. the only trend OSRS is following that RS3 did is making updates to enrich the content in the game. OSRS is just way more tactful in doing so by polling and avoiding MTX. A new skill in this game isn't going to lead to EOC and MTX, it leads to content so this game doesn't become stale and irrelevant. Its an 18 year old game that still has incredible numbers compared to other games it's age. You can dislike Warding all you want, but to say its pre EOC is dumb as shit.
---
You can actually do this with an external app that lets you rotate your phone orientation completely freely like Rotation Control, and it looks pretty nice, though it's a little unwieldy
---
https://imgur.com/a/ldJbTeS
---
They‚Äôre making it more like WOW though by focusing on end game content like raids theater of blood and inferno 
---
It was confirmed that saved nests before the patch will not give the new seeds. A for effort tho
---
And now you've gone and ruined it.
---
i got banned exactly like you bro, but i loan a whip. My friend never gave my whip back, he got banned and like 2 hours later i got banned as well tbh im not sure if he did RWT(probably he did) Banning me its ok? Should i never loan an item again?
---
Well my account is several months old so don‚Äôt you think they would‚Äôve caught me earlier if I had been botting?

I have a few hidden around newer content.

Do quests for ez xp and grind a bit more, farm runs on the side and bird house runs too for money. realistically time you spend grinding something for money at this point will be better spent getting stats. Which in turn will result in easier faster phat lewts. Cheers.
---
Thankfully it's not an ironman. Hm, well I changed it and it didn't fix it... Maybe I'm lucky and it's a bug with mobile sessions and not hacking. I think my phone died in the middle of being logged on last night. 
---
No, that isn‚Äôt true!
---
Skills are the foundation of the game, right?
---
Changing that has much more of an effect on the game than adding a new boss or continent or anything like that.
---
It used to be a requirement for pure clans back in the day to quickly get back to fights around Mossies. 
---
Still voting no for the new skill
---
!remind me 24 hours
---
Yeah I definitely forget to switch back to standard spells after getting tasks too. But I made like 400 house tabs a few days ago so hasn't been a big problem. If you kill Nechs for Slayer, you end up with a bunch of soft clay so I just made them all into house tabs.

What a stupid idea lol, no need to be salty.  Just as you said, nobody uses multi combat spells in single combat areas in pvm, nobody uses freeze spells on NPC's except in extremely rare instances, so it goes both ways.
---
those are still going on?? i got tricked back when i had no idea what twitch was and folks told me to go watch boaty... boaty is quitting and all that...

Well shit. I thought I recalled that runelite put a GE price on them. TIL

You came up with an idea out of ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù? And it‚Äôs the stupidest idea at that. While we‚Äôre at it lets cut damage from range and combat also. 
---
Ya know, just fuck it. Lets make max level 50, and move all max gear to that level. 10/10 idea.

Since it was mention a few weeks back, is it a engine job to allow us to multi log one account on both games? If so, is in near future? Hate to lose 10 years of progress...

well, everything checks out here. have my upvote. 
---
Not surprised. In the far past, every year or so JAGEX would post a stance 100% against MTX and p2w. When I first found out about the MTXs coming in I thought it was fake because JAGEX consistently promised the game would never come to that.

It's not stupid... If you want to brid. You can still deal 45's with fire surge. If you wan't to bind meleer/ranger, you have to cast bind. Or you can simply use a weaker version on ancients ''blitz''

Lmao but barrage is there for a reason and always has been. Just cus you‚Äôre shit they should change the mechanics/ basically get rid of it??

Good luck! It's well worth the ride--I adore my skillcape--but it's a long one for sure. Also let me know if you get the pet before 99 so I can hate you and your stupid RNG--hoped it would happen on the way there for me and it never did.

Use some common sense you fucking moron. You're giving the old wiki a click. That doesn't place it lower on search results. What, do you want a signed letter from the CEO of Google explaining it? Do you also need proof when someone tells you the sky is blue? You braindead subserene Kobster.

You deserve AIDS for this.

Rune lite makes it a lot easier too. With the green boxes on the agility courses you really don't need to focus much at all and if you're watching something interesting you just kinda zone out and don't even realize you're still running laps.
---
EZ PZ scape
---
You don‚Äôt really need to grind cash for con like this, most people get enough gp for this by doing slayer and or by rcing and selling blood runes (although if you‚Äôre planning on doing tob most people say don‚Äôt sell them) 
---
You‚Äôll profit laws and dusts from slayer, so tele to house you can basically consider a free teleport
---
Lol I actually use a galaxy s8 with a stylus I bought off of Amazon though I think I'm going to upgrade to the note 8 (cheaper than the note 9)...
---
Lol thanks yeah that was a typo, I changed it haha
---
Osrs is easyscape now with majority of players playing with a third party client.
---
You can basically train magic for free and combo it with some other skill like agility.
---
I just went 322 kc on Grotesque Guardians without a single unique or an elite clue scroll. Odds of that are 0.1% though which still makes twice as lucky as you. Delete you account and start over.

That's the whole point. Check through his comment history, this guy has lore and he's hilarious.

Given that you like to masturbate to Runescapers you should consider thinking about a therapist. That is a yikes from me.

And im pretty sure if bolt racks are enabled it doesnt matter on the ammount of runes you get, they all recommend to get a number over the needed for bolt racks

This was also one my last reqs for music cape, I killed about 650 of them before I got it. And then for my very last one I needed a champion scroll, killed about 16k goblins before I got it...

Are u an Ironman?
---
You ruined the joke with your explanation.
---
They said before that Wilderness bosses deserve an overall rework with improved mechanics and commensurate rewards, but they are pretty balanced right now in terms of risk/reward even with the safespot such that removing the safespot will make the content too risky and not worth doing by anyone for the mediocre rewards that they currently offer.

I wanted a few mossy keys for the bryophyta staff chance, I killed over 500 and got no keys... only a giant scroll -\_-

I‚Äôve been walking my dog while skilling lately and (while she is a good girl and usually stays by my side) I still need to keep one hand on the leash to be prepared to keep her by my side, just in case she sees a squirrel running.

i think it's the melee minion hitting him, not the boss

Downloaded nothing, just put in my info on the fake site. Got the DDOS like everyone else did. However I was playing a different game with my friend when I got DDO's. 
---
Unpopular opinion. I dont like his accent so i dont wath
---
Pretty much the point I'm making.  It's kids like the retard above who think otherwise.
---
That worked! Thanks homie!
---
I played a lot from 2010-13, and then quit for 5 1/2 years before the mobile launch. That's what brought me back to the game, as I really can't play from work and don't get much PC time at home, so I play on iPad. 
---
I haven't played another game since downloading OSRS. Definitely worth membership (I just bought a yearly premier club to save money over monthly purchases), and it's just about as easy to play on a tablet as on the PC. I spent a while in F2P just relearning things, and working on free quests and some skills. This is a great port of the game.

I've found it to be efficient since I also have a rejuvenation pool to restore run energy as well as a lunar altar to fix pouches.

I've found it to be as fast as the abyss (if not faster), but this is safer and eliminates the inconsistencies of of the abyss.

most of the people with maxed total on w45 dmm don't ever pk lmao.

friendly reminder that the runescape community is and always has been more toxic than league of legends

Lol no

Wear magic defense, pray mage. No way to fully get around it.

On stream they said all nests currently in the game or ones stored in your bank (ex. birdhouse nests) are pointless to stock up on since the nests will be "old" nests and won't have the potential for new seeds to release from them

I‚Äôve always thought that my eyes were playing with me but earlier today, I was looking at some screenshots and found that the brightness of the minimap changes randomly within the screenshots(no I didn‚Äôt mess with the brightness) Is there a purpose or a reason as to why this happens ?
---
It's a shame these skillers are so racist towards us pkers! They expect a compromise but then behave like this? No real pker would be getting max total on a dead server!

That's a huge shot

How do you sell them?

Pretty sure he has a glory and combat braclet in this pic.. also home tele would be max 30 min wait right?

Usually for me its one and then another two that form one big stream

Can you sell marks of grace?
---
OMFG IF THIS AINT FACTS
---
I know that feel. Was so glad and yet I within 5 minutes of getting the 99 I missed doing rc. Felt weird having to come up with something to do
---
Well, hear me out:
---
1. *New stuff is not guaranteed to be better*,not by a long shot. In fact, historically there are a LOT of mistakes that were made in implementing new content. A lot of the content is great, and polling helps that. 
---
2. It DOES matter how many skills are involved. One way or another, they‚Äôll need to be trained for any real main account. I very much dislike this argument because a new skill will *always* affect quests, both requirements and the cape, meaning any main account is all but FORCED to take part in that content.
---
As I‚Äôbe said before, skills are the foundation of the game; not something that should be altered. Especially for returning players who want that familiarity. If I left RS3 after the dungeoneering/divination/invention crap, I‚Äôd be VERY wary of any new skills in OSRS; it wouldn‚Äôt seem like the same game, and as such, it‚Äôs not really what I want to return to
---
‚ÄúBut there is Zulrah and Vorkath and other new content! People love that!‚Äù
---
I agree; there is a lot of great new content. I do not agree that the skills should be part of this new content.
---
Please let me know if I can clarify anything.
---
subtract about 3725 of those tokens and you've got my loot from level 1-30
---
Back in 2013 i had 7 on my main but decided 7 was enough and used the pts on gambles lol
---
Buy crystal packs from Grace and sell them
---
DHCB is a 300k/hr operating cost and the BP with addy darts is a 600k/hr operating cost. Without the Dragonfire ward the additional speed of the BP makes it better despite the higher operating cost.
---
Ok so i should go arround 80
---
Doing kandarin hard before my 66-70 push was well worth it; almost 20 MoG/hr with the 15% increase and a decent increase in xp/hr

Q: when in the bank interface can holding shift count as "deposit all" option to deposit items quicker. 
---
Yes! Thanks mate, I tried searching in the top posts category but it would not show up, going to save it now so it never disappears again.
---
You go to Grace in the Rouge's Den and she will sell you Amylase packs for 10 marks of Grace each.
---
Each pack has 100 Amylase crystals in and I sold the crystals for 1,280 each
---
I think OP has also had the same weird videos popping up on his recommended from YouTube. Type in ‚ÄúAnts Canada‚Äù and have a watch 
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not bad without the teleport. Coincidentally I did 62-71 without it. Around 65 I almost never needed a super energy and kept going. I recommend the camera zoom (?) options so you can set the camera to look straight down and zoom out enough to just see the bank wall from the drop down spot.

I already had the surgery after 99 thieving, so my hands were good this time around.

"skills are the foundation of the game". I've seen every skill release that came out in the RuneScape 2 period and the foundations of the game didn't shake until summoning. Sailing and warding aren't going to ruin cutting willows and fishing lobsters for Johnny wagecuck.
---
I heard the main game gets a rework. Why you ask?
---
Something I've always wanted to ask - why is this always set up with an A? Doesn't all the magic happen with the q p? Couldn't you do S q p and it would be the same?

In five years we'll be making insignia of West Rome

That cape seller is so fuckin maxed he just stuffs the cape in his backpack. That backpack must be OP as fuck, that fucking backpack has to be BiS for everything.

I bet it makes your inventory larger, gives you +15 to all stats and lets you wield 2 godswords at once

I don't get it what's the big deal about your username getting change? also what kind of rookie doesn't afk osrs while playing league?

---
You mean that thing that happens to people all the time in literally every game, not just runescape, and that is actually really really prevalent in league compared to every single other game that exists within its own self-contained executable? 
---
Or were you referring to the prevalence in runescape simply due to the fact that osbuddy was the major 3rd party client for ages, but also was previously a bot client, still run by some of the same people, and was one of the most prevalent causes of people getting ddosed and doxed even after it "legitimized" itself as a 3rd party assistant client? Because that's not really the community, so much as something the community actively shuns now.
---
Even better, is osrs having one of the most positive and open lines of communication between players and devs, falling short only to the best of the best, like digital extremes/warframe. Need I remind you that the ex community manager of osrs still has a happy and positive relationship with the community via his livestream, after leaving the company, while many community managers for any other game would have a panic attack at the idea of having to interact with their userbase ever again?
---
Or after all that, maybe you're just not actually that friendly, and your reminder is personal opinion before any fact?
---

Yeh I need magic Xp to go from 70-75 magic for trident. So I figured why not get agility and magic. Only need to get firemaking and fletching to finish diaries along with workshop2. Before I knock out the diary planning to try and finish that up today. On the limproots I need to pick what‚Äôs the grow time?

Blowpipe cost is tied to the #of scales generated. Scales tanked a few weeks ago from 230 down to 140 and are starting to recover and are around 187 atm. Also unless range isn't meta for the hydra boss blowpipe will go up a bit more on release.
---
haha no you're fine man, but honestly I was intimidated by those quests at first but they actually were kinda fun. I even did the evil Dave RFD component with a kitten - got so lucky it took only 25 mins with the shit catch rate of a kitten! Point is that you just gotta rip the bandaid off and enjoy it. 
---
Could you possibly add packs of death runes to baba yagas shop? Figured there might be a reason death rune packs werent in the game at all already, so maybe locking them behind lunar diplomacy would work. 
---
yeah good luck
---
Not really, doesn‚Äôt matter what my name is, this is my alt. I‚Äôm just having a good time haha
---
Love you

I love you both

easier to just kill 3 skellies

gee I wonder why you can make 500k-2m an hour begging in the ge in a members world. Also why is it that charities do so well when brought to the community. Your pessimistic view of the community is an insult to good people.

I spent like an hour killing moss giant near Ardougne the other day and my only rare drop was a spinach roll.
---
If you're on android, download an app called Rotation Control Pro (don't know if there's a free version or not but there probably is) and lock your phone to vertical. If osrs is already running you'll have to close it and reopen it otherwise it just stretches the default aspect ratio to be vertical. Thank me later boys.
---
Haha this is what I feel is going to happen to my alt. Having maxed once now, I feel like it's inevitable. 
---
Fuck all ironmen
---
I've never played ranked for siege. I don't want to be the sole reason we lose 8 games in a row. I have league for that already.
---
Man, this actually was genuinely hilarious the first, maybe even second time I saw it. 
---
Why‚Äôd you have to ruin it? :(
---
I did this. I thought I would hate the grind but it was so unbelievably worth it. I swear if I ever make another account, the first thing I‚Äôm doing is 99 fishing for those free fishing/strength levels. Having high agility makes such a difference in quality of life for this game.
---
What do virgins have in common with playing runescape in your phone? Man the f#ck up, ignore the haters and just do your thing, do you and be yourself! 
---
I remember being like this back in the days. I rarely told people that I played Runescape. At school people laughed at me and I got very uncomfortable. Nowadays, i dont give a rats ass if people see me playing Runescape. Don't compare this game with being a Virgin since it has nothing to do with that, even though a lot of you are joking. I had a lot of insecurity problems during my younger years. I fell in love with Bodybuilding, RS, weed and acid. Weird combo huh? 
---
Ive been training for almost 9 years now and I consider myself having a great physique. I'm 189 cm, 122 kilos and running around with 7-8% body fat. 
---
I combine my training with weed and at the end of each month i go on an acid trip, do get a reset because of our current society fucking us over.
---
I game on my phone a lot, and when someone asks me what it is i straight up tell them, but i dont give a damn about what they think of me.
---
So please, do what you love and screw the haters. We're all people with flesh and bones, we're all the same when it comes down to materia.
---
Thank you.

This is not Quality of life, this is EZScape, unironically. It wont boost xp-rates, but it‚Äôll make top rates a lot easier to obtain and maintain. It‚Äôs fine to say it should still be implemented, but it is NOT QoL imo
---
Ace is asexual. It's the lack of sexual *attraction* not lack of libido or a lack of deriving pleasure from sex. Also ace and aro are both spectrums, I'm also arospec. I want a romantic relationship, but I  just have so few people hm romantically interested in (I average a little under 1 a year) that it's really difficult.
---
But yeah, it's very similar to being trans feeling-wise. I figured both out around the same time, and there was definitely an i replay between the two, especially since society teaches men to be aggressive and hypersexual. But being told "i wish i was ace" feels a lot like when I get told I'm lucky to not have a period.
---
If it makes you feel better, I got 3 from my last 1150 kills. But then one trip (100 kill) I got four. Got a stack of about 15 sat in my bank. 
---
Yeah, even with the lance coming out DHCB will still remain the best and have the longest trips.

Welcome to the era of RS4.

Having the name "blkshinh8er" says nothing about your views lol. It's not even necessarily racist. Black skin is not the same as black people. Maybe he doesn't like how black skin looks on a person? I know I don't. I also don't like how tattoos look on a person. Doesn't mean I hate black people or people with tattoos.

I mean it's a simple as having half a brain. You see a white dot while in combat with the dragon tele, box it if you can, or log.  It's not even a wilderness task so your comment is pointless.

Dude call me crazy...I kinda like agility. I don‚Äôt mind the grind. I‚Äôm getting 84 for the rev cave escape and it‚Äôs so nice to watch some shows and get this shunned stat to higher level than most players ever will. Like hell yeah I did it. Agility club

Mid diamond I would agree. I've watched plenty of D5 games to know there are plenty of people who consider themselves "gatekeepers." Also until recently D5 had a massive range of play levels.

Now that we can grow redwoods, can I plant one in my POH and hollow it out and make it a tree house, you may not like this idea but..would be a lot cooler if you did.

When the clan I am in was around 40 cb we would go with like 7 people and bang out level 70 pkers with overs and stuff.  Possibly some of the most fun I've in a while. We would get pretty big loots too just hoppin and kill rev killers.  We all basically used rcb and rune scimis.

Well shit, guess it's time to go jump into river lum

Definitely not lol. Gold players think that gold is good so they are cocky and always blaming everyone else for their mistakes etc. Same with plat really.

The chillest rank is Diamond 5. All the toxic people trying to get master are usually hardstuck D3 or so. Most of the people in D5 realise they have peaked and are chill as a result.

Well, you don't really need to go to each individual streamer's page. You can just go to the Old School Runescape section on Twitch and sort by [top clips in the past 24h](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Old%20School%20RuneScape/clips?range=24hr). You can also sort this by [top weekly](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Old%20School%20RuneScape/clips?range=7d) and [top monthly](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Old%20School%20RuneScape/clips?range=30d). Admittedly, this is still more work than just playing one Youtube video, but it's an alternative.

 wilderness treasure trails, rranging reqs from easy, to master. emote clues would include pking, or performing certin attacks on players. puzzle boxes included, and kkey drops from bosses. they would be dropped by players in wild, and give moderate pk supplies/gear. some uniques could be , golden spade(for risk clue hunting), and maybe some wildy specific gear like a blessing that alows deep teles. it would promote the wilderness, and get pkers to clue hunt, and clue hunters to pk!

i know runecraft has been a huge meme of the game pretty much since its conception, but has there ever been any real discussion on taking a second look at the skill? im experiencing rc for the first time and its really making me want to just stop playing the game, since it will eventually bottleneck the whole experience with diaries and stuff locked behind it. im not advocating directly for runespan, but after having played a decent amount of the early game of rs3 and a decent amount of early/mid game of osrs, rs3 does runecrafting significantly better in every single way

You've read all the anecdotes and instances where individuals like yourself who appear to have nothing have something.  A pker can't know that you literally have nothing until you've died.
---
Agreed. I was expecting a mute or bam on rs
---
I've seen the opposite. Hearing from friends and watching streams of D5 I see that as hyper toxic because of people who think they're better or want to "gatekeep" plat players. D5 was also a competitively large division mmr wise though.

yeah it still works fine in other programs. I've actually been using it for ages and took a break from OSRS for a while and now that im back the middle mouse wont pan the camera anymore.... i thought maybe it was just an interference from OSBuddy or something. but i have no idea why i cant use it.

For someone who has never done raids this comment won't help, so to say it in simpler terms:
---
You can ask people to let you "alt" in their raid. Its pretty important that the average combat level of the group is 115 or above.
---
It would also be super helpful to have 50 construction, 78 herblore, and high farming. 
---
Your main task is to support the raiders with potions. You do this by killing scavengers for supplies like Juice, Mushroom and Cicely(aswell as 4 planks for a chest). Once you have around 12x juice, 5x mushroom and 2x cicely (where x is amount of raiders), then you plant and farm 15x buchu. Seeds are dropped from some of the bosses the raiders fight, or you could rake them.
---
Thats more or less it, if you are 78 herblore you can also make them into potions, where juice makes brews, mushrooms makes restores, and cicely makes prayer enhance. Leave 1 juice/mushroom/cicely per person in the chest so they can make overload potion with it.

Very impressive! Tempted to try this out. Do you know at all if the initial spawning of K‚Äôril affects the cycle at all, or is every spawn able to be used as long as you time your first hit correctly? I ask comparing it to the Venenatis safespot where if she spawns awkwardly, it throws the whole kill off if you don‚Äôt reset.

So what part of left clicking an item instead of right clicking makes the game easy?

Pvp worlds are cool imo. Fighting anywhere in the world is awesome and I wish they could expand on it. Your view on this is weird... You dont enjoy pvp worlds so we should remove them to force other players to populate the areas you want?

BTW here. I'd rather make 10k tabs (enough for two years) then spend ten times the time on cash &amp; 99 construction.

You'll passively get enough soft clay from nechs if you just occasionally do Slayer.

Unless you actually enjoy construction don't waste the time and mental capacity on a useless 99.

Bastion potion (80 herblore) &gt; Super Energy (52 herblore) &gt; Prayer Potion (38 herblore) 
---
https://imgur.com/a/vG3TyCe - The above potions are lowest on GP/xp, while Super Energy costs more, its also faster and with the time saved you can make up the cost even if you only make 100k/hr. The total price and hour estimate is for around 100k xp. 
---
Prayer will give you 183.750 xp / hour, costing 5.98 gp/hr it will be around 1.1m gp/hr. 
---
However your next goal is 52 herblore, which is 93k xp. That will take you about 30ish minutes costing you around 550k. 
---
Then you want 78 herblore (for raids, look into bastion potions if you want to go higher). Which is another 1.5m xp, taking you 6 hours and 6 minutes. Costing you around 9.5m.
---
Herblore isn't cheap.
---
Agreed, shit community tho so no good changes will ever happen
---
That‚Äôs a problem with any multiplayer competitive platform.eother the meta stagnates and people coalesce around a couple of the best strategies, or it becomes some complex, high APM shit where people continue to outdo each other with greater and greater efficiency.
---
Sadly the only way to return to that simpler feeling of combat is to join a game that just launched and ride that wave of exploration and innovation, etc.  with the rate of information sharing the speed in meta development is almost entirely unavoidable unless you have developer that are gods at both balance and mechanical design.

No one knows for sure, but I think the general consensus is that the items that have skyrocketed will eventually decrease in price. It‚Äôs hard to say for certain, though.

You know, looking bad at what happened back then, the event somewhat was a success... I mean, it clearly showed there still is a lot wrong with many people. By spamming this sub with hate for weeks, I think they opened a few eyes, realizing that homophobia still is a problem. The majority doesn't want to be represented by the loud minority. These days, most players here probably look at it shaking their heads.

It would be capable of replicating and organising the items in a simulated version of the bank that you could copy in-game manually.

Right, ok, didn't realise your argument was that you had to identify the fucking icon on the skillcape icon to know which cape is which. That's just beyond retarded. Not like a shark looks like a fucking IRL shark either, but you still know what it is.

Nah that is a classic drug addict homeless phone.  Probably young with a fucked up phone that was probably stolen.  I see it all the time where I live.

You have a whole tab for keys and books? There is a key ring which will consolidate some of those for you, and the wise old man will help delete quest items that you will never use again.

I've found the best way to casually get levels up is to plant herbs for farming and use those to make potions. You make a profit with prayer pots, which you can start doing at exactly your level.

It's about every seven levels the xp required doubles, same thing, but easier to do in your head I think.

106 = 26m xp (about)

I'm not sure you are aware but usually people censor their own user names not the other users. This is mostly a meme but you might accidently have leaked personal recovery information. The point is to not link your runescape account with your reddit account. Other users have no such risk.
