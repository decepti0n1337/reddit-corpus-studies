yeah but, how much is that worht
---
I actually asked about it years ago when I was doing black salamanders and the answer was no because engine work. I'm sure they've streamlined things a bit since then but yeah that's probably it

Plz no warding.

All of those phrases "Jagex is powerless against X", "Contest winners never get their rewards", "No authenticator delay", etc are common complaints that this subreddit has had over the years that eventually just became meme phrases used to express disapproval of Jagex.

The crab stuff came along with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/a56l9h/had_a_go_at_animating_one_of_zuhaars_more_sfw/?st=jubv6spf&amp;sh=26164cae) that blew up and made it to the top of /r/all.

---
Tbh in a perfect world all warding content would just be an extension to runecraft.
---
I mean objectively runecraft is a terribly broken skill and lore wise would work perfectly as magic‚Äôs fletching / smithing.
---
But that will never happen because of masochist players + nostalgia.
---
1. Starts
---
  *  Bruno, Wolf, Tide, Sween, Gambit.
---
2.  Announcements.
---
  *  New Clue steps and rewards coming this week, easter coming soon, Deadman re-run coming and being looked at! Check respective blogs/announcements.
---
3.  Thank you for voting and supporting us winning the BAFTA EE mobile game of the year!
---
  *  Cheers!
---
4. Hiding poll results?
---
  *  Yeah, done. See the update newspost. Polls will be closed temporarily tomorrow (webpage will also be invisible until after poll closes). Aiming for Friday for the first poll with hidden results. The issues that players bringing up are being addressed! Player support are looking to release a blog toward the end of the month, we're looking at Toxicity, DMM is being paused until we're happy with it, we're having players in the office discussing PVP and issues there. 
---
5. The range and melee ghosts at Cerberus look similar, could you update then to be a bit more different?
---
  *  Yeah we can do that, we did something for that in the past but would hope to make it so that people can tell the difference.
---
6. Could we get a Peace Treaty as a reward for completing Song of the Elves? You could show it to your slayer master to get them to stop assigning elves as a slayer task. It doesn't make much sense to be a friend of the elves yet still slaughter them by the hundreds. Or just make it an unlockable perk with slayer points upon completion of the quest.
---
  *  Maybe? Would rather make it so that there's like a duel or something where you don't end up slaughtering the elves but you still have to engage in combat. Perhaps there could be a different tier of Elves. Not keen to simply remove from the task list.
---
7. Will the mimic fight's mechanics be looked at to better represent the concept of a mimic thematically? As it was previewed, it is opt in and has the player choose to enter the fight. Traditionally, mimics catch greedy adventurers off guard, but are easily distinguished from regular cheats if you're attentive enough. Perhaps it could have an examine text or slightly different icon than regular caskets. Master clues have dangerous ambushes anyways and with a way to tell them apart, it falls on the player to not get caught by one. This fits the fantasy of a movie perfectly.
---
  *  We did investigate this but felt that forcing this upon players that might not be higher level could be a bit unfair or seem unfair - and nerfing the clues/boss wouldn't be fair to the nature of Elite/Master clues. The second (and bigger) reason is that we weren't comfortable adding a teleport of this nature into the game - teleporting from anywhere and then to reappear somewhere else and this is tied in with instances and the mimic's mechanics of losing a reward if you teleport or leave the fight. This could just add a lot of complexity for no real gain. 
---
8. In the Hosidius rework, the bank seems to have moved away quite a bit from the catacombs exit, making it a considerable nerf to gp/hr of the dust devils down there. Could you maybe add a deposit box by the entrance so we can at least bank our loot?
---
  *  No we're going to change it, Dust Devils are already quite good slayer/magic AND gp which isn't completely intended. We're going to change it and if a few 100k drop/hour then that's how it'll be.
---
9. Back in 2008 or so, a feature was added to RS that after a level up would let you click the skill guide of a skill to see what you unlocked with the new level. This was very useful when training combat or doing other activities where you'd miss the lvl up message in the chat box. Could we get this in osrs?
---
  *  Don't mind it yeah, that would be nice. Would require a full rewrite of our level up system, ED started working on it but essentially it would be a big job for little payoff. Perhaps a good update for new mobile players. Maybe could have a message in chat box? It's being held off for now.
---
10. Since the moss giant boss is one of two f2p bosses it seems strange that it does not drop any f2p items. It logically doesn't make sense for a f2p boss to not drop a unique item in f2p. Are there any plans to make an update to it's drop table to fulfill the consistent boss theme that bosses drop uniques?
---
  *  It was polled but not entirely sure why it failed. If anyone has any suggestions then we're happy to investigate! West: As both bosses are weak to mage maybe it could drop something that ties into warding to make some unique armour? 
---
11. Any expansions or update to Zogres in the future?
---
  *  Maybe? We're always happy to look at questlines and content but a lot of players want other things. We're currently finishing Elves but would like to ask players down the line to see what people want quest we want to look into. West: Would love to add a few new undead bosses that could tie into Warding too! Zogre undead? Things to use crumble undead on too!? 
---
12. Can cutting fish from Barbarian fishing be automated like it is from Aerial fishing?
---
  *  It could be but players don't get a lot from it anyway? Not sure if this is one of the things that we're looking to automate. 
---
13. There was a post a month or two ago about a middle ground item between the anti-dragon shield and the dragonfire shield. Are you still interested in implementing this item?
---
  *  Maybe? Just not sure where it would fit in... F2P can't kill dragons and it doesn't seem to have an exact use? Open to hearing why and how this would be used.
---
14. Can you please allow skillcapes on Entrana, would be nice to use the Farming perk.
---
  *  Don't really want to sorry. 
---
15. Can we get a little icon that indicates when a friend or clan chat user is on mobile?
---
  *  It requires work from people that aren't on the content team. Don't know if it would allow people to get exploited in some way? Could be a bit better to improve the chat function if it's not working for players.
---
16. Can the shades in the last level of the stronghold of security, give normal EXP rates?
---
  *  We could make it have regular EXP, this is because they used to be random events. Easily possible if the players want it. West: Could also buff Gadderhammer to make it better DPS than some other things against shades.
---
17. Could the dragon hasta be buffed for use against dragons? Currently the leaf-bladed sword is a better choice if you don't have a Zamorakian Spear or Abyssal Dagger.
---
  *  Does it need to be better? Not everything is made to be useful. It may be that leaf-bladed sword is strong for it's level rather than the hasta being weak? 
---
18. Will you add a toggle to rotate the screen on mobile?
---
  *  We wanted to make one interface that works well and is designed properly. Players seem to use their own software to rotate things like that so should we? It would also require a lot of redesign in interfaces etc, probably a lot of work for a minority gain. 
---
19. Will OSRS mobile be made compatible with a normal computer mouse?
---
  *  Probably not, we can't do that content-side. Aside from this perhaps another device like a laptop or tablet could work better?
---
20. Can you give demonic gorillas a PJ timer of sorts? It seems like every time one goes off me for a second when it goes to melee and gets stuck behind something another one attacks me and I lose my kill.
---
  *  Perhaps more so the pathing rather than PJ timer. Sween positions his character so that it can melee if that happens. Wolf: Think it has some sort of mechanic like that built in anyway, will look into that one.
---
[Continued below!]

Disclaimer: This will literally auto-ignore any message that contains the word "doubling", starts with the word "Player" or even contains "&lt;number&gt; usd" (I think this one has the wrong regex), and some others. So you might not see a message from a mate or something. Use with care.
---
21. When can we expect a Bounty Hunter rework as promised back in late 2018? So far, BH received some QoL changes but seems to have been placed far back in the backlog.
---
  *  We are keen to get the design ready and shown off and get it in game. We are currently revisiting the way that PVP content gets introduced and how/when things should be changed. Until we know HOW we can change the way things are introduced we aren't able to offer the BH changes as they'll probably not make it into game.
---
22. Spiritual Creature slayer assignments are unlocked after completing Death Plateau which doesn't make sense since you can't get into the GWD after Death Plateau. Can this be changed to partial completion of Troll Stronghold? Maybe after defeating Dad, Since that's what you need to do to get into the GWD.
---
  *  Wolf: Sure you can actually access it after Death Plateau. It's not as easy as after Troll Stronghold but definitely possible. Not looking to change this sorry. We'll look into that after the stream!
---
23. What are the chances of having moss giants given an extension for slayer tasks. And also having other slayer masters assign them? I understand they are not technically slayer monsters but I enjoyed getting them as tasks so I could get mossy keys and even at a high slayer level I wish I could do them as a task.
---
 * Bruno: You might enjoy them but most others probably won't so wouldn't be keen to add them to the task list. --- Sween: What about as a general Giant extension? That could be a nice middle-ground.
---
24. Is Mod West intending to slowly rework the general layout of all the Zeah houses after the Hosidius rework is released? I think Shayzien and Piscarilius needs some attention in terms of layout and identity.
---
  *  Definitely with Shayzien. The tents are huge, lots of graves etc and there's a table upstairs? Maybe if we were going to look into that area we could look at other mechanics like the thieving thing that was a bug earlier. West: Have a plan already for Lovakin and Arceuus - would like to look at the others too! Please send through any suggestions to West on twitter :) 
---
25. If we move a room downstairs in our POH, can the rooms between be filled in inbetween? 
---
  *  Don't know, it's not hugely easy. Bit of a question for Ash sorry.
---
26. On the collection log for the clues can you make gilded and 3rd age into a separate category as it's essentially impossible to complete hard, elite, master section because of this. 
---
  *  It could be done but not really looking to change that no. We did mention at the start that the collection log was never designed as a completionist log. Though if it's a small change that would improve the game for a niche group of players then why not? Would be nice to ask Mod Lenny to see his thoughts.
---
27. When you do the Hosidius house rework, will you also take a look at the Mess hall? As it is right now there's lots of room for improvement. You can only take out 1, 5, 10 or 50 items, or take X. You have to manually change X to 14 if you're making stews. Why not have the game either remember what value you had X be, like banks do?
---
  *  That's NOT currently in the Hosidius rework. But it's a small enough change that we could look at offering this as a generic change separately. 
---
28. Stats to Champions cape?
---
  *  No it was only added as a cosmetic cape, not looking to give it stats or make a Max version. 
---
29. Use for extra spirit tree seeds? Useless after 99 farming, potentially to skip contracts in the farming guild? 
---
  *  It feels bad to have an item that becomes useless at a certain point. Could consider it after we rework farming contracts anyway.
---
30. Can you allow Duradel to assign Hydra tasks?
---
  *  Not keen, Kieren previously mentioned something on this. Seems to be a Konar specific thing, not really looking to take away from Konar in that way.
---
31. Fix Thammarons Sceptre?
---
  *  You say fix it but doing so could make it pretty Overpowered.
---
32. Mythic Max cape an option?
---
  *  There's a case for it, would like to see it.
---
33. Theatre of Blood Metamorphosis?
---
  *  Would have to look at how many people have the pet before doing it, to see if it's justified spending time making.
---
34. Hydra tail?
---
  *  We left that one, were looking at an alternative reward like Bone Whip but didn't go ahead. Open to making the bonecrusher necklace better in some way. 
---
35. Jar drop rate at Skotizo?
---
  *  Up to the players but open to changing it.
---
36. Group Ironmen?
---
  *  No updates at this stage sorry. Needs more work, engine, content focus etc.
---
37. The best in slot necklace, Torture comes from Demonic Gorillas which is easier to obtain rather than Bonecrusher so why shouldn't it be changed or updated?
---
  *  Wolf: Not a fan of changing it. Like the dragon Hasta, not everything needs to be Best in Slot. It has a niche and is fine to not be the best and have it's own spot.
---
38. Firelighters on Phoenix pet?
---
  *  Like the idea (no real discussion further).
---
Sadly people might unironically say this next year
---
Hopefully Zammy will protect them from their 29% interest.

Apologies it's quite long this week, I try to avoid walls of text and to summarise questions but some questions just can't be cut down without losing a lot of context (same with answers). 
---
Plus we got through a good number of questions this week with lots of discussion 38 questions/answers!.
---
No. They try to complete the trade and hope you don't realize you didn't take out your items. So they offer stuff worth less than 60m (here's your prize, a fury!), or tell you their friend in falador has the items and put up a fally teletab
---
If you're in a hurry you might just accept and give them the 60m.
---
Mobile power üì±ü§ô
---
Lol they could fabricate either way
---
Giving us capes in Barb Assault would be cool.
---
But there's other things that would be better:
---
- Let us 4man barbarian assault. This would help combat leavers without penalizing people whose internet disconnects. For some, this could also be a fun challenge.
---
- Give the healer a right click or left click heal option on teammates. It's such a crucial role to be able to do well, especially in latter waves. Level 1 healing at late waves is really messy when you have to use the vial on teammates constantly. Shouldn't be something hindered by interface clicking. Would help facilitate 4man runs.
---
- Make "multi-killing" runners as defender consistent... as far as I know, whether or not the saw can actually multi-kill runners is RNG or based on some weird tick mechanic that nobody knows.
---
- More importantly, it'd be nice if runners felt more responsive to dropped food. It often feels like they pause for way too long before noticing food, or run away from food and seem like they didn't notice it, before turning around for it again after you thought it had gone way out of range, and sometimes it just notices the right food immediately. Runners should favor most recently dropped food.
---
Still no authenticator delay.
---
No other device?
---
This is factually false. Google uses a 3-5 day delay (try this for yourself if you do not believe me) when accessing a Google account without the authenticator. An email gets sent to the backup email with a link to click if the person had not tried to access the account.
---
Please update yourself on this one.
---
In a similar fashion to the plank make question, could super heat ore also work like that?
---
Wtih?
---
Probably an RS3 player. Chevy Camaros are P2W.
---
So it's like a circlejerk thing?
---
It‚Äôs more about a meme about increasing the price while decreasing the quality of service. 
---
Plus alts are basically necessary to play and enjoy the game.
---
Although I agree 11$ is more than worth it to play rs, still Jagex is making record profits and still pays their staff shit, doesn‚Äôt have adequate QA or customer support, and manages to break the game once a month. Therefore a price increase seems unfair.
---
We already have numbers.  Accounts that are hacked aren‚Äôt by brute forcing a password.

Personally there are many polls that I would have voted in but decided against because there was a clear winner anyway. People are more likely to read the polls and vote on their own decision on whether it should be in the game or not rather than just popularity.
---
This game was so damm fun

When THE FUCK did onyx hit 2.9m

Tried it. Kept hitting zeros so figured it wasn‚Äôt for me

I don't pk but from what I've heard 1t barrage is one of the most difficult things to do while bridding. Making it easier would just lower the skill gap

Authenticator delay doesnt fix the underlying issues with the system. Its still flawed lmao. Youre just a part of the hivemind screaming for an authenticator delay without actually knowing anything about it.

As a waiter I connect with this on a spiritual level.

Polling hiding poll results was extremely stupid decision to begin with. It should have just been added as an integrity change to begin with.
---
I didn't say there was, though. Was just stating the circumstances of my situation based on the misinformation of the other comment
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä we wont see that until next week ü¶Äü¶Ä

---
polls being hidden was polled and failed, yet 5 year olds cried on here that they couldnt vote because they could see what they wanted was failing...
---
&gt;Make it so the first person to leave (log out, change teams, reset wave, or leave the area) for more than a minute gets penalized heavily UNLESS they come back
---
Lol, how about no. So I should be penalized for leaving a shit team? No thanks.
---
It's a fly

the waves always spawn on the west side so if you're on the eastern side of the ship you have quite a large reaction window

 "we don‚Äôt know what will happen when poll results are hidden. We've tried to adopt a scientific approach to testing and predicting the impact, but ultimately we have concluded that the only way we can test this is by actually hiding poll results in the live game" 
---
uhm.....there have been many studies on this, in real world polling. And many case studies too. It's laughable that they think this is new or different. Literally google: "hiding poll results, study".
---
no
---
I'll vote yes to everything then both votes are nullified
---
there are many, many people saying "we should revive dead content" but if it was as simple as just snapping your fingers, they would do it. content needs to be revived with compelling rewards or people won't go to it. rewards drive content. it's 2019, nobody plays minigames just for fun anymore lol.
---
Wow actually shout out to the OSRS team for listening. We really appreciate it and hope this trend of listening to the community continues for the remainder of the games life span. Cheers OSRS Team!

---
Since its a 2 day ban you were prob auto clicking. Stop trying to waste our already limited customer service when you already know what you did.
---
Especially amenity lol. That guy's switches are smooth as hell.
---
"I got lucky on RNG, so obviously everyone must have experienced the same"
---
Do you think everyone in this thread is lying?  I Did with 60 agility and failed a frustating amount of times.
---
Auto clicking what ? I got my magic up by splashing. ‚ÄúLimited costumer service.‚Äù So you mean to tell me I should just accept it even though I did nothing wrong ?
---
They banned you for botting and it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre trying to deny it so fuck your evidence.  ‚ÄúTell me how you caught me, so I know how to cheat better next time.‚Äù Obviously I agree that other bots deserved to be banned as well, but it‚Äôs a poor argument that you should be able to break the rules because other people are breaking the rules as well. You‚Äôre lucky to only have a temporary ban.
---
Sorting by new.
---
How would the invisible barrier work?
---
Easy for tubby
---
Slowly,  i use mine alot and by the time mine degrades i already made enough for 2 more whips.
---
Ah, I see! Sorry!
---
In that case:
---
* Zeah is a thing. Includes several bosses and guilds, including the new farming guild, Lizardmen shaman, and wintertodt (skilling boss - efficient fm exp), tithe farm (active farming exp) 
---
* Fossil island - good wc exp through Silliusceps, you can get afk hunter exp through birdhouses, similar to the farming skill, hardwood tree farming
---
* Raids - high-level PvM, Chambers of Xeric on Zeah and Thearte of Blood in Morytania
---
* The Inferno, basically a much harder fight caves
---
* Dragon Slayer 2 and Monkey Madness 2
---
* New Gargoyle slayer boss
---
* Vorkath - basically a better money snek
---
I might have missed stuff, so have a read through [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Game_updates) if you like
---
You should accept that you cheated and are lucky to only have a temporary ban for cheating, yes.
---
Cuz its double xp weekend? I got the 2xp code, just need details on your end.
---
She‚Äôs a beauty. Well done!
---
I swear rs community is so toxic please tell me where I wasn‚Äôt trying to deny it by clearly saying I wasn‚Äôt bottling ..
---
You can just safespot it, have your main kill it for your lvl 3, or hop to a world without it. There is nothing to devalue here.
---
Wasted all your luck man.
---
99% of the time they do deliver these types of punishments, its usually correct. They dont just ban willy nilly.Many like you before have claimed to have done nothing wrong only to get smacked down by a jmod. 
---
*Btw magic isnt the only thing to autoclick
---
So even though I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong I should accept it ?
---
Read your original post, you didn‚Äôt deny it...
---
Did you bot?
---
Thanks man, i know the feeling i did 99 fm from wintertodt with 600 kills and never got the pheonix, im very lucky
---
You shouldn't insult people when they're giving criticism or if you're having a discussion with them; they won't want to try anything like it again if you do.
---
Anyway, if it's instanced multi and people loot kills, then this would mean that people would spawn with the same gear and stats. Experienced clans with excellent synergy would dominate everybody playing, especially new pvpers who don't even have a team to play with, and would win all of the loot for themselves. Since all gear is spawned, this would increase the amount of those items in the game immensely, which is not good. Having a safe portal wouldn't increase the amount of pvpers as clan wars has existed for the past many years and has not helped significantly.
---
The majority of people, objectively, will not want to lose their items in some arena, certainly without any sort of incentive or reward. You might not, but most people do. I said it that way because while I'd be for it for the money I'd get from farming it (I'm a good pker, but the majority of people are not), the majority of people do not get that opportunity.
---
$11
---
But they didn't poll about hiding poll results
---
nah probably not lol
---
For what?
---
All the other skilling outfits provide 2.5% bonus xp, so there‚Äôs no reason this should be any different. Also graceful isn‚Äôt even that powerful. 
---
So those two things aren‚Äôt gonna happen. The rest sounds for the most part decent ideas.
---
Very nice. I got a 2kc ranger boot on my uim last week as well! Came with a blue headband to lol
---
What do you mean, you openly admitted to playing rs3. You‚Äôre lucky it‚Äôs not a permaban.

Our cc wants to start a cc house on our home world. We are planning on using the cc owner account. Our only concern is that the account gets banned for being  6 hour logged and then one of the mods online just sign it back in. 
---
We also are running into concerns about keeping the account online for those entire 6 hours without being babysat. Has anyone done this before? If you have pm me and let me know how you did it, or respond here.
---
I'd jizz in my pants if they added this

As a Ford employee, Mustang should definitely be Saradomin.

If I want to pk I'll brid, if I want to do slayer I'll do slayer. Bringing claws and venge hoping for a Rambo  spec is boring. Rather bring a better +1 to speed up my kills

If anything konar cleared this area out a bit as there are other locations she assigns. 99% of other slayer masters people would just go here

nah youre just salty
---
I think it was more of a fact of changing a requirement of an item that has been around for so long feeling wrong.
---
Just make it to where there is a removal delay for x days after recovering your account. This way people cant recover and remove your authenticator right away.
---
I dont think 9 belongs at all but I expect it to pass regardless
---
Not really recently.
---
Pretty sure it used to be 48hrs before too.
---
Meh i think the profile should be able to port to both server. As for the bots....i don't really give a shit about them tbh. Same with splashers. How do they affect your gameplay anyway?

did everyone from ROT clan get banned due to illegal activities as well?

Nope, you're blocked from teleporting in every way.

No

Damn that's unfortunate

I know it sounds really dumb, but it's the most likely cause of the mute because I can't see any other reasons and your chat log resembles that of other people who have been unjustly muted for the automated child protection ban. Sorry to hear that you have been muted in any case, I hope it works out for you.
---
You are the chosen one
---
I just figure you would tank most of the kill get tellyed and have your friend finish the kill . It be an awesome set up.
---
Lol its an online mmorpg. The POINT is to be in a world with others. And again, ill say it louder so you hear me this time. MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ONLINE. Its just dumb kid
---
That‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôd give everybody ever a world to boss on or money make on this causing a drastic fluctuation in GE prices. Just my prediction.

lol auto correct

I got mine at the exact same spot you‚Äôre standing with almost the same level üëçüèΩ
---
Prepare to learn at least quadruple the amount you thought you knew from back in the day lol. It‚Äôll make this play through great for you!
---
Points are almost never useless unless literally your only intent of doing Slayer is to get 99 and never touch it again. Post 99 it's useful to kill bosses faster on task, and you need a large chunk of them for all the helmets. but everything else is correct
---
You just gave away your account creation date.. GG account. idk if you're aware but Jagex currently lets people recover accounts using very generic information such as account creation date. It wouldn't be too big of a deal if they simply put a delay on removing authenticator but they haven't. Probs too late for your account anyway, but welcome back!
---
Lets be honest just give us summoning, dungeoning or sailing instead
---
Please

but disconnecting at places like fight caves or inferno will no longer happen. I see promising future for this.

also all weapons are set to attack by default now so daggers set to atk, u set em to def, but equip a sword? that sword is on attack. got to set all weapon types.

Honestly you should know never to click any random links, or if you didnt you should know now and practice not falling for it. None of these streamers (or anyone period) will ever be telling you to log in through a link they provide or even if they say they're quitting and give a name/pass, dont log in because they're just wanting your IP address.

I'm an iron as well and honestly I like the aspect of being able to be crashed as an iron. It's definitely pissed me off before and it sucks sometimes, but honestly it makes the rewards that much more worth it to me. I'd rather have to do tedious bs to get a specific item versus being able to play more so like a normal account, but i guess thats the fun part about an iron to me. I do get where you're coming from though

I had no clue this was happening daily, its so fucking sad what they are doing.
---
Not really, at this point all you can do really is maximize exp gain by upgrading items. Also, do you use potions to increase strength? If you're using Dragon scim, super combat potions, berserker ring and berserker helm, you just gotta get items which maximize STR even more. If you are not using these items then you should try to get at least these things first.

You know level 3 pures are a thing right? Or that some people decide to pick a few non combat skills to level up first?

Defense makes your combat level skyrocket, your dmg to pures Will be so bad you're not gonna kill them, and since they have accounts specifically made to pk they are most likely to win, if you want to pk check out other builds, zerker or max melee build, but no you won't be able to pk for a long while

It's just flawed logic to say "they could already be manipulating polls so it doesn't matter that they're making it easier for them to manipulate polls." That makes zero sense. Being able to see what the results are as the votes come in isn‚Äôt much, but it‚Äôs better than nothing. Why should we be happy to give what little power we have over poll integrity away?
---
You're also just simply stating there's no downside to hiding them and no reason to be shown. I don't understand why people think like this and say so without any reasoning behind their statements. If the polls are visible, it's less likely that Jagex would risk manipulating them, because someone could catch on to it. If they're hidden, Jagex can do whatever they want behind the scenes and present us with whatever polling data they feel is appropriate. 
---
It wouldn't be ironic to vote on hiding poll results without hiding that polls results. It would be following the same procedures they've used to implement or deny every other change they've made to this game. This ought to be treated like a major change, and people should have the right to vote on it. The last time a poll was taken on this topic was before the game was released on mobile, and tons of people have joined since then, so why aren‚Äôt those people allowed to voice their opinion on this? 
---
Jagex claims the majority of the community supports this *overwhelmingly* so they should be confident that such a poll would pass. In light of that, what good reason do they have for not hosting a poll?
---
And your point is?
---
They don't collect data currently. They *may* do it in the future, but that's not now, nor planned in any foreseeable future. So what's the problem with using it now?
---
This is the type of zany, creative shit I love to see from OSRS people
---
Why can't I wear a ring on each finger, and one on my cock?
---
Wait what was the point of his response then. The original comment was rhetorical. You think they were literally asking "who's to say they aren't doing that already"? Their point is if Jagex was interested in manipulating polls they could have already started to do so. Yes they would have been caught. Yes they would still be caught. So either his comment was irrelevant or he's stating it would have been obvious for 3rd parties to notice now, but not after they are hidden.

Yup. The wilderness level you're in is how much of a difference your combat levels can be. If you're in level 10 wilderness you can only attack people within 10 combat levels of you. Further north you go, the higher the level. I think the max is 55. Pvp worlds I think are within 15 combat levels.

I‚Äôm sure if he posts something as pointless as making a new account that he‚Äôll post something with his username in the future, then it‚Äôs GG.
---
I agree with you completely, I think warding has huge potential and im very excited to see what it will become in the future when it comes close to polling. Maybe some of the people who're against it are forgetting the only information we've been giving about warding was presented at runefest and was still a very undeveloped idea at that point. I personally don't see point in having a 'no' opinion because we simply don't even know yet what the skill might bring to the game once fully developed and fleshed out with loads of new ideas and community input.

Looks like your latter questions have been answered but I would recommend getting info from multiple quest guides!

Better idea. We can all stand at the dock typeing, "halt" "stop" "who goes there" hopefully  that turns them away, and who even takes fish passed the kara borders? I sell them to the island shop and hop when i start making 5gp less per fish.
---
Might be op but the ability to unnote things such as watermelons from the leprechaun would be helpful. Also why can't cave nightshade from beladonna seeds be noted at the leprechaun?
---
Not ASCII, but Unicode. I know what you mean tho, that the crabs are just like any other character.
---
Just FYI, ASCII can only encode a very few (128) characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols like +, \_, ? and other non-visible like delete. Unicode, on the other hand, can encode many, many more, like emojis and chinese characters. This encode can follow different formats such as UTF-8 (which is the most popular).

I hope this helps you :)

Well you are playing the 07 version of the game, hunter was released 06 naturally it's not fleshed out much in this version. There was 12 years worth of hunter integration but it's all in RS3 where 15 quests requires 76 hunter at its highest for Lord of Vampyrium as well as 77 hunter + 88 magic to crystallize a grenwall for an elite Tira task. You need 90 hunter for the hunter ports adventurer to appear. 
---
Doubt you're ever gonna see this level of integration of hunter in OSRS.
---
Your ingame items are worth hard cash. To people living in countries with shit economies that means food on the table. 
---
Never got hacked, only recently got an authenticator because jagex in their infinite wisdom decided it'd be a great idea to lock crucial content behind one. 
---
Sorry to be that guy but 95% of hacks are due to the account owner enterting their info on dodgey websites, clicking phishing links or having an infected computer. 
---
Don't give up man, get an authenticator and start that rebuild. You'll be back on top in no time. They can't take your levels or game knowledge.

---
If I recall correctly Jagex decided that 48-hour mutes were too harsh for most offences.

Unfortunately, it has been reduced to 1-hour making it completely ineffective against spambots. I've met several Player Moderators that publicly stated that they refuse to report and mute spambots nowadays. :\

Nex is 2011 content bro. Those Prims you wear (if you‚Äôre even rich enough for those) are literally 2011‚Äôs Steadfast boots. You‚Äôve been playing a game with a lot of 2011 content bud. RS2 never had anything even close to as broken as the blowpipe or Twisted bow. We were using Rune crossbows at Dag Kings. Learn the very game you play. All your OSRS-exclusive content is either re-skinned late-RS2 content or powercrept exclusive content like the Tbow and blowpipe.

godwars, tree gnome village, lizardmen area on zeah

Oof lmfao
---
Out of curiosity, do you download and install a lot of APK via install unknown apps option on your iPhone which you use to play OSRS Mobile?
---
Or torrent a lot of gaming software?
---
(1-p)\^x
---
where p is the chance of the drop and x is the number of kills.
---
So if you have a 1/10 drop, and you kill 20 monsters, you would have \[ (1-0.1)\^20 = 0.12 \] or a 12% chance that I haven't got the drop yet

What software would someone use to screenshot a fly.

Context: Josh is part of the best worldwide guild in World of Warcraft, but recently started playing OSRS because he was banned for a week for abusing a leveling glitch and because ‚ÄúWoW is shit right now‚Äù as he says. 
---
He‚Äôs made an effort to not look anything up in OSRS and learn everything himself, AND he‚Äôs playing an Ironman account (can‚Äôt trade with anyone, much more knowledge and effort required). He made a bet that he could beat fire caves (arguably the first real challenging piece of content you face in OSRS) before the new raid comes out in WoW in 5 days, but he leaves for twitch con in about a day so he has to beat it before then because he won‚Äôt have time to after, and if he loses the bet he loses $4,500. 
---
He spent all day today preparing for fire caves but didn‚Äôt make it to the final boss. What we see here is Josh getting absolutely fucked the first time he reached him and basically losing 4.5k

If you like protecting networks/ systems instead you could try sans but it's a bit pricey.

Great change (albeit late) but reading the first couple paragraphs had me screaming JUST CHANGE IT!!! Especially where they say "we don't know what will happen" well the only way you can do that is to just DO IT. Shia Lebouf people.
---
With that said, great change, I'd like to see some old popular content repolled with the new system (skills in particular). If they pass, awesome! We know the system worked/players realized they wanted the content after the fact. If they fail, well you already have the content created so you're not losing anything.
---
I see. Thanks
---
Is the 3rd age ring tradeable and what are its stats/functions?
---
It's today
---
FYI Updates only come on Thursdays
---
A combination of the height of the model/animation (It's very tall as it also sinks into the ground) and amount of polys.
---
It was an extremely inefficient spot anim for something as simple as a blood trail.
---
Trimming the polys and slightly lowering the height of it stopped the issue occurring. Only reason it was in this build was because it happened to the mimic too which helped determine the cause.
---
Because the fact that it requires a brain makes teaming stupid, but them they go b and make it the best method.
---
And no skill should require teaming to train.
---
I totally get what you are saying. I hope the next boss isn‚Äôt a solo boss like Zulrah, Vorkath, ... etc. 
---
There should be a boss that‚Äôs extremely hard to kill with a team, and truly impossible for solo players (yes, that includes ironman, sorry)
---
I‚Äôm an ironman myself, and Jagex should stick with their statement that they won‚Äôt adjust/tweak future content to make it ironman-friendly, even if it locks out the entire IM playerbase of BiS items... we (as ironman) choose to limit ourselves. Regular accounts shouldn‚Äôt be affected by another game mode. 
---
This might be an unpopular opinion sorry fellow ironman.
---
check the wiki for herblore training, it lists the xp rates and also gp per xp for the main methods
---
&gt; Personally I'm against warding but only because I think OSRS needs to focus on old updates being fixed first
---
adding new features = / = fixing old updates
---
From which implings can beginner clues be obtained?
---
I agree. I have seen enough posts like these where the OP doesn't show the full log or has edited the HTML in a vain attempt to get their account unmuted.
---
What about the watson teleport?
---
Why delete your post when ppl disagree with you. Man up

I‚Äôm have an ironman account as well, and Jagex should stick with their statement that they won‚Äôt adjust/tweak future content to make it ironman-friendly, even if it locks out the entire IM playerbase of BiS items... we (as ironman) choose to limit ourselves. Updates for regular accounts shouldn‚Äôt be affected by another game mode.

I feel like Ironman are the reason for so much solo content but for community-based PvM content it‚Äôs kept us very limiting. There‚Äôs just a crazy aura around getting 10 guys in discord to go fight something extremely difficult like Nex and I miss that feeling. Raids is closer to a mini game or dungeoneering than is a team boss so I don‚Äôt count raids nor do I get the same feeling for raids.

He plays WoW for world first raiding. There is currently no world first raiding going on. Consider it "the offseason." Has nothing to do with the game being in a bad state or anything like you made it seem originally.

---
Make one of the dumb students train rc for you by making them believe its a mental challenge.
---
He literally says in his live streams that WoW is in a bad state. Please listen to that before you speak haha
---
I think the reason that happens is to prevent you or the dragon from leaving combat while you run to avoid the electricity (since it's dodgable).
---
Before that change it was sometimes possible for another rune dragon to pj you while running, or another players to pj your dragon while you were running.
---
\ you dropped this
---
I believe the bird nest ID setting did not allow new bird nests to stack on top of old bird nests in the bank. However, an old casket in my inventory stacked on top of a new a casket I just obtained, leading me to believe old caskets can roll on the new table.

Tree west of the Champions guild &amp; southwest of the mine. it's an older easy clue map
---
Just got mole slippers, instasold for 5.1m haha
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this refers to be having up to 3 of the same type of clue through clue nests, clue bottles, and the regular clue scroll. Juggling requires the clues to be on the ground which means its not really in your possession.
---
sell it
---
Just one of their members.
---
what clue level?
---
Exactly that‚Äôs my point.. like why do people vote against pvp updates when they avoid pvp at all costs  anyway lol
---
Maybe because the system thought that you "knock up" your "15-years old" account.
---
Gertrude thanks
---
was this a beginner clue?

Okay, the one good thing to come out of failed pvp polls I‚Äôll admit lol

&gt; It's just weird to me this idea about polling integrity like, we have next to nothing, so let's do away with the tiny bit that we do have. That's just a strange argument on it's face.

Not really, the small amount of "integrity" we have is irrelevant and causing far more harm than good

---
Type: Hard clue
---
Solution: Inside Wildy agil course
---
(Died with the clue (another no vote to pvp polls) so don't have the scroll itself)
---
Uhh, did you submit an appeal? or did you go straight to reddit like a brainlet?
---
Btw?

it be funnier if we were tethered in with a harness, and when we fall you see us dangling by a rope or something...

In the walled off pen with those rock monument things north of falador (east of the north gate), the line at the bottom of the map is falador wall

That's kinda quirky

The fact that you dont even need to confirm you‚Äôre the actual company behind osrs just proves how fucking loose the laws are around stuff like that
---
I'm going to be honest, I have no idea how difficult it would be. I'm all for new game modes but there are too many issues with current modes, mini games.
---
And iirc he cant use his mage attack from very far away

This was it, really appreciate it!

Primula in Myths' Guild
---
How's the fight work? At work so can't check anything else zz
---
Theiving worst
---
Rangers already are 33m and theyre old content, which means new boots with same item use would be way more expensive obviously
---
not sure, maybe they want to add the clue solver details for the new clues before updating?
---
Time to whip out the sextant, chart, and watch
---
That's pretty poor given how rare the fight is damn
---
A little while back, my unfinished zerker account was hacked, and trained all the way up to 80 Attack.
---
I have no "main" on OSRS; would most of you recommend I just turn the account into my main at this point? If so, what are some important things I should do right away?
---
For reference, my stats are 80 att, 92 str, 45 def, 87 range, 79 magic, 88 HP and 52 prayer.
---
Thanks for any advice!
---
thanks guys :)

I‚Äôll buy it OP

no that takes way longer. Runelite will be up before all new clue steps are added in
---
With this update maybe longer then normal. Just use the normal client if you can play without easyscape
---
get that sextant boy.. good ol' days!
---
He still has 24ish hours to kill Jad so he hasn't lost 4.5k yet.

Its a foolproof tactic if you have prot range and listen for the mage attack.

We did it boys! Only ‚Ç¨11

Wait didnt i see you there yesterday?

You can also mine them and have them noted by the female NPC troll upstairs, meaning you can go back down and mine more until you're happy with the amount you have!

What was your strategy for the fight?
---
I got 3 clues and total of 200coins worth of rewards so fuck all that
---
I don‚Äôt understand why the jester cape is a beginner reward. There is literally no way for a F2P player to obtain the rest of the set since its from a members quest.
---
It literally only exists to confuse people.
---
\+a
---
It appears the loot is predetermined, only reason they would act like that, think of old herbs even though they said unidentified they would stack so u knew what they were same idea here.
---
Goblins drop m
---
i highly enjoy the self-aware crab edit.
---
I disagree, I do it with my FM cape even though it looks shit either way because I can.
---
Added
---
Jeez. That's stupid haha I give it 3 days and it's gonna be 5 mil tops lol
---
Which one
---
Honestly not too bad if you do raids since elites are pretty common. Hell, any wild boss with row even will yield quick results
---
You enabled the chance to fight a mimic. 1/15 from a master and 1/35 for an elite.
---
Ok, I agree.  But how could YouTube know?  Because a random commenter tells them it's a scam?  They would only take it down if Jagex informs them it's a scam.
---
Already have a few episodes about the elves!
---
Why would we ship water 2500 miles across an ocean? Waste of fuel
---
Runelites working again
---
You could also search the mini games tab for shield of Arrav and select join to be put into a cc of likeminded individuals. I recently used it for heroes quest so it was very useful.
---
Yeah, I spectated Woox on the first ever completion.
---
I would say the hardest track to unlock is to get to the Olm room, and considering many people can do that solo just goes to show how easy the Music cape is to get.
---
The longest track to get used to be the one that requires a champion scroll, but I'd say this new Mimic track will take you a hell of a lot longer.

A 2k total account really doesn't take that long and he would've had years to do it. Not saying he does just saying it's a shit argument

Should be less likely yes, unless they adjusted the rate to hit the mega rare table
---
Construction is alright for ironman/ uim, but it's kind of a straight out money sink for mains.
---
Let‚Äôs be real, the game is great.

And useless cosmetic things are great too, as long as you‚Äôre not forced to buy them with real money/they‚Äôre not ridiculously expensive lol.

Beginner clue: reldo hot/cold: dig on top of ice mountain (in the centre)
---
A lot of items are ranger boots rarity and are still incredibely cheap. The only reason ranger boots are so expensive is because they are bis for pures and mains. All cosmetic items pretty much drop to almost nothing.

what level clue was this? do you remember?

Found it, it's regular basalt

Will beginner clues be obtainable from geodes and clue bottles?

for hot and cold i got the clue

But voting makes me feel good

Yeah I've never seen why that's so impressive. Just hit 98 on your other combat stats and never use that style again.
---
Honestly didn't try using lance at all but considering woox said and showed its slower then dhcb I don't think so.
---
My fastest kill time is 0:44 and that's using DHCB and blowpipe while he does the poision phase
---
Is the item actually called "giant boot"?
---
I'm trying to find the wiki page for it. It probably doesn't exist yet, though.
---
I dont get why it is tradeble. It would be a very cool item for your poh if it was untradable. Now it is just sad.
---
&gt; You are aware that literally one of the quests that were last added use Hunter
---
Yes, that would be why I said "four" instead of "three". Also, if you think that that is complaining, then you should get your head checked. That is a well-considered evaluation of the status of the skill
---
Thanks bud

My clue was 17 degrees 58 minutes north, 37 degrees 37 minutes west. Logged off an hour ago and logged back in and it has changed to the one I just posted üòÇ

holy shit ure clue luck

Alched for science or oopsie?

Yeh it‚Äôs really common now, I got mine like 2 years ago when no one really cared about I trimmed but I‚Äôve just always kept it.
---
Lol
---
back to pest control, don't ragequit next time
---
Yea to solo gwd you're better off with base 90s, but you can duo for sure, my melee stats are far worse then yours and I've duod and trio'd effectively. You'll want at least one member of your team to tank that has 90+ defense with a good set up though. Justicar is best
---
Also literally involves knocking out with blackjacking
---
Sounds like a really lucky bug
---
But... what are we gonna complain about then?
---
Think of the memes, why won't anyone think of the memes?!
---
It's pretty funny all the people saying zerks and pures are going to want to play with them, sure some will but I'd rather an AGS/Claws over +1 str, they will be pricy due to training but that's about it.

I‚Äôm still enjoying hydra, I find it a very fun boss and I like solo play more.
---
At 1100+kc though and still no claw. Got everything else but the jar and throw axes. Also have had 4 tails lol....  But on my third ring so can‚Äôt complain
---
Rune could be the rangers of beginner clues. Having a non-members way to get a rune scimmy outside of getting 90 smithing would be nice.
---
nah lol i rather quit
---
Someone else in this thread apparently went in game and said the same phrases as him and was also muted. So my money is this guy is telling the truth.
---
What I really care about is a comprehensive list of monsters that drop these clues. 
---
Mass murdering goblins just isn‚Äôt very fun, honestly. üòÇ
---
And the roof directly above it! Just the bits below were off a bit.
---
Have fun! Remember if you want a trimmed Music cape you also need the holiday tracks, so go do the easter if you haven't yet.
---
I done a fucky wucky unfortunately
---
Considering you can buy deaths from a shop 250  a world takes what 30 seconds for 750
---
Don't even need to do that, base 90 combats is plenty
---
Most the devs are around the average player base age.
---
ok but whats so hard to understand about "pray range cause hes gonna screw you up before you hear it"
---
Fight is quite easy, he throws projectile sweets a bit like the hydra poison attack &amp; he spawns three Third-age Mage, melee, ranger i think at 50% health?

Top 10 us. So top 500 world? As an American I feel the pain.
---
guys please read the whole post, theres no way i died after that
---
Have they upped the clue scroll chance? I've got a beginner, easy and medium clue from fishing in 3 hours
---
Got Mole Slippers. Nice and easy 500k.
---
Something about the way you write reminds me of Trump
---
why in the world does this have any downvotes at all
---
jeez some people r haters
---
Wouldn't it be more along the lines of accusing jagex of skewing the final poll results?
---
That‚Äôs so cute :) :crab:
---
Well, aside from me actually adding it and you editing it 15 minutes later, because it was in all caps

(Which is weird, since there is no consistency on having capital letters there or not, you should check it out)

Looks more engaging than I would have guessed. Cool

Wrongfully muted? What are you talking about? Talking like that sure deserves a mute if you ask me.

Good old jmod trolling, they‚Äôve done this from time to time lol

Did someone said GOBLINS?

Oh, after reading your well constructed post, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that you indeed didn‚Äôt die afterwards.

Is there any semi-recent source of gp/hr of pvming? Specifically curious about midgame bosses to do before zulrah or vork. 
---
Also, what are current gp/hr rates of wyverns and gargoyles at a mid level? 
---
Like 80s combat stats, working on my slayer alt and want to start bringing in gp rather than sinking it

Awesome. I'll use this later. :)

If you don't hear the mage sound it's range. Woox hears sound in .6 second ticks so he can make the judgement for either one.
---
'grey area' is a compliment to the current state of wow.
---
I get what you're saying, it's the same thing me and my mate was talking about, Nerfing dmg then may make it impossible to kill people, But being able to be 100-&gt;0 by most weapons is just stupid right now, I don't know how they could fix it which is the purpose of this thread but yeah.  
---
They could also change how combo food works if that's the issue afterwards, honestly i'm not sure but being able to hit high 70s regularly is silly, you are forced to sit max hp.  
---
I think the g maul being able to combo is what it's known for but doing 120 damage or whatever with the spec bar is not right, not all 3 hits in 1 tick and adding a item to make a nerfed g maul as strong as it currently is will not fix anything, You're just delaying the inevitable.  
---
If people want fights where you do not camp 90 hp or more then a change to weapon damage is a must. How much the nerf is by i'm not sure, 30% was a random number to begin with but the nerf would only work if people no longer sit at 90 hp because as you said killing people will be harder.  
---
If people want pvp changed, you can't have the mindset of current pking where you sit at 90 hp, if it's only d hide people want nerfed then it will not bring more players into the wild, it might even remove more players from the wild due to the skillers being farmed more than they currently are.

I got a beginner from one of the bigger spiders around the H.A.M. entance

The wiki has not been updated with the new drop tables, and likely will not be for some time. Stop giving outdated advice.

On wiki already, dig between the three gold rocks in Resource Area in Wilderness.

People: Fuck "buyable money sink" skills with fast xp gains, we don't need anymore of those
---
Also those people: Fuck RCing, the "slow xp, high money" gains skill 
---
(not directed at you) Fucking christ, we get you don't like it but some of us don't care for an easy way to do everything because there can be profit in doing something other than killing 24/7. Some people just want the easy way for everything, this game is meant to take forever to do and 99's are supposed to feel like an accomplishment.
---
No they haven't, you still get kicked out on world hop occasionally. The only thing they fixed was not being able to immediately rejoin.
---
IMO you're not even going in the right general direction. Rs already fundamentally depends on honor rules about only eating to a certain level and not using protection prayers. We don't need to make it *harder* to die, it is already borderline impossible if you're trying your hardest not to.
---
turn them into eggs for the easter event pls

It's already hotfixed. The clue has been changed.

The post on the update just says it will only be f2p items. Unless there's more info somewhere else that's all we know so far. I'm guessing it goes up to mithril, maybe addy items.

How is it powercreep? Some slight defensive and offensive buffs to tier 70 and 75 gear making it tier 80 and degradable at the same time is powercreep? Compared to blowpipe, scythe, and tbow? Lol okay bud. Also I'm not necessarily asking for Nex, just some high level boss above Corp. I don't really care what it is or what the rewards are. I know the OSRS team likes to be original so they'd probably spin the idea a different way but have similar mechanics and rewards.
---
So you‚Äôre telling me a monster can‚Äôt drop 2 versions of a clue? They could‚Äôve added beginner to the original tables of monsters. Glad you‚Äôre the wiki since you know all the rates as of right now. 
---
It‚Äôs not muggers, I said thugs genius. And pickpocketing ham members would be pretty accurate if op would have the thieving level. My answers aren‚Äôt wrong, y‚Äôall are just fucking retarded

I logged in to the runescape website, then they asked me to confirm my DoB, and I did correctly, then I checked my account history, and it said it was safe. I quickly thought that maybe there was an attempt at logging in my account (by a hacker, but my pw is stronger than steroids, so gl), so i figured they wanted to confirm it was me, I logged in and everything was fine. I was pissing my pants god dammit screw you hackers

Rage more that your shit tier answers are getting downvoted dude. 
---
OP asked about mob drops, not pick pockets. 
---
You are making the grand assumption that drop tables now reflect 2 clue scroll types, when they never have in the past, and have reached this grand conclusion only now after being informed that there was a change to begin with. 
---
Learn to give helpful and quality advice and you wont be downvoted as much. As is you are are not only wrong, but an asshole.

Its not really stupid, Jagex is extremely serious about it and the filter just needs tweaking. Your mute was probably automatically forwarded to be reviewed by their ICU team, but it hasn‚Äôt been reviewed. Was it recent?
---
Oh cool thanks. I didn't know that.
---
Also had a hard clue for her, but song was 'Complication' for me
---
The 6-digit code is generated from a *key* (a single very large number - it is created by Jagex and transferred to your phone by scanning a QR code) and the current time rounded to the nearest 30 seconds. When you enter the code generated by the authenticator app, the server generates another code using the same information and checks that the codes match.

Take those nats out of the bank, you know what to do.

The pet you get from regular raids is called the "Olmlet".  There is a more difficult form of raids called "Challenge Mode" where you have a chance of getting a an items that lets you transform your olmlet into another monster from raids like vanguards or mutadile.

I mean I wasn‚Äôt serious, I don‚Äôt think they fix polls. Was just memeing for the karma bro
---
Calm your bananas buddy. Wasn't aware of it.
---
It‚Äôs a meme. Certain users would post a video of a bot-looking osrs player put over the music video for Crab Rave by Noisestorm. He would then perform multiple Fortnite dances while the video listed grievances against Jagex and their decisions.
---
The appeal is that the thumbnail, title, etc never lets you know its coming. So people would post a misleading video that ultimately ends up roasting Jagex, unexpectedly, and it goes right to the front page.
---
Its a scroll not a clue
---
I have this same problem. Luckily my thumb sit pretty naturally where my ctrl key is so it‚Äôs not a huge problem. It is pretty easy to get hit by the kamakazie at vork if my dog or girlfriend decide to mess with my at the wrong time and I get stacked out pretty quick.

But if i was a content creator this would be content i would cover. (the whole clue update, not just slippers) And i mean there are a lot of rich content creators, so it couldve been a mix of both.

NEWS JUST IN
---
Christmas cancelled
---
I remember ages ago I sent in a suggestion for Heraldic platebodies and legs/skirts. Cool seeing them implemented, even though it's not the design I sent.
---
Looks neat, not too busy like the trim armors can look
---
That's a teleport though
---
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
What's wrong with having a single pot that gives *slightly* more xp? Otherwise it's an insta-drop unsellable item they just wasted time on? It's an extra 7xp per bone crushed, which if you only have one of these pots (remember, you can't even buy them) you'll have to run up and down over and over again to get the most xp out of it. Is it really going to be that big of a game breaker for you?
---
New update allows you to have multiple clue scrolls in your bank/invy, therefore this should no longer be an issue

I am also very excited about the recolor. I think the current version is pretty ugly, but the kbd one was pretty cool looking. There is no news on it though.

I got one last night?
---
Altscape won't go away either, though. Then we'll have mains with yaks AND alts with yaks lol.
---
So like 100m OSRS?
---
Still could have loads more you was impatient if you ask me
---
Yeah I got three last night but after the treasure trail update I've received none.
---
But could a pure beat obor? I'd be scared with no prayer protect and no melee stats
---
Hi in that case can you make it so I don‚Äôt have to pay for membership?

Why do you have a picture frame filled with photos of yourself

If you're eating frequently, yeah. I took 80 damage from 2 healers at like 74 Defense and had to heal
---
I've been talking about this literally every week. If this came out it would be the best update ever.
---
And I think they should poll the drop table and consider just releasing her with different drops and not necessarily Torva, Pernix, and Virtus. As much as I'd like them in the game they might be too op for players and I'd rather Nex got in with an alternative drop table than not be made at all. That being said I like your idea of crystals a lot.
---
Ill sell you mine for some burnt shrimp

---
Would rather get this than no boots at all tbh.
---
What is your range level?
---
Yeah me, know you know me, but no you not me.
---
Imagine the amount of defence experience pures will get when you suddenly swap these around. People are used to how it is now.
---
Oh I forgot the pure part oops, am gonna go with a no
---
What's strange is that the new rewards are separated by item, rather than by set. So Studded(g)/(t) still need to be stored as a set, but the new Leather(g) chaps and body can be stored separately.
---
Hopefully they implement that for older rewards.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
It was already very profitable and like I said I‚Äôm happy with what I got. Sounds like you‚Äôre envious. Don‚Äôt want to provide screens thanks, there‚Äôs already a video of me getting it on here.
---
Nice i will claim it right now. thank you my friend.
---
Drip.
---
"As a percentage,..."
---
I don't see why they would even put a timer on something that takes 19 seconds lol
---
No..fucking..way.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs 50/50. Either you get it or you don‚Äôt.
---
Let's do some math. Let's also say it's 20m an hour (5x 4m/h runners) to get that 200k/h. 
---
So 13m/200k= 65 hours spent training RC.
---
65 \* 20m = 1.3b paid out.
---
1.3b / 10m/h (Obtainable with casual 4 man ToB, more can be made with smaller team sizes or efficient runs) = 130 hours. 
---
195 hours all-included v.s. 450 hours doing Zeah. Still significantly faster, and most of the time is spent doing ToB rather than RC (which most players would consider more enjoyable content).
---
Compare that to Lava runes, let's say you do 65k/h in the long term so you'd be looking at 200 hours... Meaning ZMI + runners is still the way to go (assuming you can ToB) :P
---
Ya but I mean those would be the only tradable boots in f2p, besides leather

Now that I have your attention - can you please get in contact with me regarding the studio tour prize I won 5 years ago. 
---
You told me to email you directly 22nd may 2018 with the dates i would be able to attend as a follow up to being rewarded with said prize, then never responded to me via email, Twitter or Reddit. 
---
I was originally awarded the prize by Mod Neena who I'm aware does not work there anymore.
---
Thank you.
---
Solemates
---
That's a ‚Ç¨10 expense for you over thousands for Jagex :p
---
I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt work in a team that can help with that. Have you tried contacting a community manager?
---
Imagine mindlessly clicking on the same thing for hours on end and then everyone votes no when the company asks if people want less of that.
---
I think it's more worth it if you go to the GE, buy a glory ammy, teleport to Draynor Village ( a small village located between Falador and Lumbridge for all you "beginners" out there ) and think to yourself, why did I just teleport here.. then proceed to use your free home tele to Lumby. Then realized that you used that within the last 30mins and so you have to hike over there. On your way there you began being attacked by the prison guard person then chickened out so you go back to Draynor. However on your way up to Draynor you misclicked and went towards the willow trees where the Dark mage is at. Panicked you go inside the bank to grab some food then you head towards Fally. But wait. There are highwayman in the way, so you hurry down south from there towards Rimmington to sell your dagger at the general store there.
---
Wish i had known that skillcape drop trick sooner!

Seriously what the hell is the point of it?

Does it have an advantage over a normal spade? If you can‚Äôt equip it it just seems silly.

Of course. I lost track of how many Jmods I contacted regarding the situation and gave up.

The rarest pet in the game my friend
---
truly, nothing you said _actually_ pertains to professional development except the documentation comment. but on the same token, how is documentation bad again? 
---
that‚Äòs how it is obvious, as well as the not-so-casual my IQ is 160 (lol). i‚Äôm not particularly interested in automation in the context of games, but thanks for the offer. what is even arbitrary engine mechanic? 
---
botnets imply malicious, i agree, but honestly why write even write a bottling suite? all you need is a dataset of random click times to simulate human clicking, as well as offsetting time between clicks for humanization. clicking the exact same set of pixels is also a dead giveaway. honestly, i don‚Äôt understand where the challenge is in these things. couple python scripts to take care of some menial grinding and you‚Äôre good to go. unless you‚Äôre doing it for recognition, in which case, lol gl. oooh it would be really cool to train a machine-learning algorithm to play Runescape, just spin up an osrs server and let the thing go at it. imo there are much more interesting challenges out there, like breaking the usb driver in linux‚Äôs kernel, way more fun. (how you use the exploits you discover depends on the hat you wear, mine happens to be white. please don‚Äôt lump all hacky devs into just the ‚Äúmalicious intent‚Äù box :) plus if you discover a bad bug in corporate software, you might get a $$$ kickback for *safely* disclosing it.
---
I guess Guthix just likes Limpwurt
---
Torso is way easier on an Ironman though
---
Just go to RuneScape 3, they have all those features. Seriously, we don't need dumb cheaters on this game.
---
Thanks for being the first person to actually give reasons why it would be bad rather than just saying "bad" and downvoting, I appreciate that! 
---
My rebuttal is that the pot would be in very specialized circumstances - You'd have to bring it along with a bucket and bones to the Ecto and work your way through the bones individually, which would be slower than alternatives like bringing a mass amount of normal pots and running them all at once or even just using them on an altar. It's not just bankstanding and burying the bones for a 10% boost, which is what the needle would be implying. You'd be sacrificing time utilizing the pot here for the bonus.
---
Unless of course, you're just arguing using the slippery slope logical fallacy to which you could probably use that for every update that changes things.
---
I'm not trying to have anything more than a constructive conversation about it to understand if it really would be at all game breaking, as right now it's dead content right off the bat.
---
Not a very good post if I can be honest
---
Sorry
---
If you haven't sold Them yet, don't. Put them up for a very large sum or wait a bit. A lot of people have sold Them for 30m, but they are worth a lot more than that.
---
This is so fucking stupid and I love it. +1

Thanks bruh

Still got it untrimmed? You maxed?

What monsters are dropping beginner clues?

No ^D^__U__^**D**^E

Damn pet even has a 4% chance lmao gg heads and whips

What emote did you do?

I did a clue before the update that said ‚Äúbeware of double agents‚Äù and a double agent didnt spawn for me.

Don‚Äôt try that in a bounty hunter world. Emblems are sus

Dopamine overload

Oof.

---
No exp boosting items please. Sounds more inclined for rs3
---
I panicked
---
You can buy implings which have a chance of giving a clue
---
Its because you talked about rs3 man
---
It's roughly equal until level 70.  The major difference is that you get str and agility exp from Barb fishing as well.  F2p fishing is pretty solid for exp compared to p2p

You can buy Implings (Ninja, Dragon etc.) and there is chance you get clue depending which impling you buy.
---
Also I've had this scroll in my bank for some time so I'm assuming that has something to do with it
---
You can buy ecletic imps and loot them for med clues
---
What do you mean ‚Äúwork with‚Äù ?

Are you asking if they can both be equipped at the same time or?

Yeah it took some time but it sold for 5m on ge..

Why did you emote

No cause it's fake

Just turn public off if you‚Äôre that bothered by people just spewing nonsense lol

I personally pick farming
---
Didn't take me 3 months or 20+ attempts :) also bet I have more KC than you too :) actually speaking of which, by that many attempts I already had multiple capes and I definitely beat 100 minutes lmao even if you add 15% to account for task. Good try tho :)

It's also fake

Considering all the negative karma count you got in this thread I think a lot of people think the same way about you. Good "joke" bro.

Oh, I haven't really looked into the new rewards yet so I didn't know.

How can you look cool if you can't wield a spade?

Good bit. Bark

---
You are bot the only one who wanted ranger tights or pants. They didn't get the idea from you.
---
I agree with you. I don't understand how wintertodt became a place of unprovoked and random toxicity. I can't think of any other very populated area like it.
---
Okay so question, if you put it in for sale at 1m then why did it go for 50m? 
---
If someone has a buy order in for 50m before any items are in for sale and then you put in a sale for less than the buy the GE prioritizes the buy price?
---
Thanks for all the tips guys! Will for sure try them out.Also @captain swan I sent you a request on discord
---
I snagged a steel axe and nothing else. Doubled my bank shaking rn.
---
Immediately after I got 4,600 from a hard clue.
---
The previous clue was panic at Al Kharid mine
---
&gt;This place honestly feels like 4chan
---
Lmao. I don't think you've ever really been on 4chan
---
Depends what your goals are. If your goal is all pets, get clues passivity while hunting other pets. If you have the gp, buying implings is the fastest. Barrows, med clues, and lava dragons are all decent. Doing zulrah, Vorkath, or raids for clues and spending any profit on implings might be viable as well
---
wow no pet, I got that in 7 kc
---
It's average at best for a self proclaimed "god" player. 24 attempts is nothing extraordinary and it's below average among players I'd consider goos. yeah your time is better than avg for first capes but it's nothing special where you have to flex it in every fucking post retard. If you actually learn the waves a 100 min cape off task is literally below par.
---
The dude than runs past with the pink hair keeps going bald on top lol.
---
Gz though
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt even think about that. That‚Äôs makes a lot or sense.
---
They are easy to see at the moment!
---
Can't tell if everyone is coordinating ending their loot titles with LOL
---
I think you roughly break even if you do them efficiently (magpie jars and teleport scrolls). I did my 300 a while ago, so it could be slightly over or under now.
---
Can you use the ornament kit on a gilded rune scimmy I wonder...
---
You got lured irl
---
Idk I'm a cheap basterd will not spend that much on a rune scim lmao
---
I don't see your name in the credits.
---
Do you do the absorption method?
---
That could also explain it
---
It's not actually worth anything
---
Tbh I wouldn‚Äôt train range in nmz at that level but rather vorkath/slayer or even chins because cost/time. But if you‚Äôre gonna just afk then blessed d hide, msb (I), rune arrows, holy boots, b gloves, archer ring(I), mitre/blessed coif, anguish/fury, assembler. Then ovl and pray pots. You‚Äôll get around 70-80k do hr. Afking in nmz with bp and addy darts can get you 100k an hr but you‚Äôll burn through your gp. Just remember you use range so much at high level pvm that the exp will come on its own.
---
How much did it all sell for? lol lol
---
Okay whatever you say stalker
---
Stfu
---
Idk. Have one up for 3m and still no buy
---
Do you like killing wilderness bosses? If yes, get it. If not, don't
---
The poll results on my comments weren't hidden so everyone just downvoted with that guy.  Scroll further down and see multiple people took my side. So perhaps you think wrong.
---
That's different

I would hate that. I don't want to be fully geared every time I open a casket
---
Just use placeholders

Nice reference.
---
Do they really make large difference? I always thought because they have a low trigger chance and the large chance of diamond bolts meant there was little difference.
---
ehh whatever i trust jagex enough
---
If you think you can do a better job, then why not just do it, and 'prove the wiki wrong' in the meantime. Noone who's holding you back. BTW, there are hardly any 1/10k+ droprates that are determined by the wiki people, could you name a few? Those rates are often coming from the JMods, so I don't get what you're talking about.
---
Yuuup. Lol just about all of em
---
I'm the other half with just the fedora

try turning your game sounds on.

either you are losing the rhythm over time OR you arent quite clicking every .6 seconds, you can get very close and still successfully 1 tick for a few seconds.

This looks better to me than the Sara and Zammy variants.

You're right.  I did this by hand at work and accidentally cut off one digit more on the denominator than the numerator of (1 - 1/5000)^8 when rounding.  Did it again and caught my mistake.

It's relatively low (6%) but you hit for 100 and can get through phases real quick if you're lucky. Definitely worth it
---
I feel like the enjoyment of RS is working towards something so I need something to work toward

Getting this doesnt mean you will fight the boss. You have to altivate youre chance at a kill first in watsons house. This message is basicly asking you do you want to wait opening your casket untill you altivate the boss chance or do you want to open it now

Damn, that's well over 100M right there mate.
---
A man of culture I see lol!
---
R
---
Cook has flatly denied that the wiki drops come from sources such as JMODs analyzing the drop code (when properly cited), and aggregated drop data (even though that is literally what his "project" is). 
---
Check their post history. Its not a secret.
---
It doesn't track things before it was enabled. RuneLite has a save setting to sync settings every time you open and close it. It regularly deletes old entries.
---
50/50
---
I agree, lavas are faster if you don't 3 tick. But i prefer to do any skilling in the fastest way possible, so for me rc is worse than mining
---
My favorite part about this is that you were expecting it to sell for 1m. That‚Äôs a happy fuckin day. Congrats!
---
I imagine it can't be worth much due to not being able to flex on people with it... unless you stand around the fucking GE just digging in random places, no one will know you have it lol.  
---
So, pretty much worth as much as a normal spade.
---
F2p clue scrolls now?
---
Id prefer a jmod smackdown rather than getting no closure on this.
---
You got trucked then. I find that highly unlikely unless you were in there wearing mystics or some weird shit. 42 def w/ void and I tsnked two healers with no worries.

Tyvm!! What is ballpark though? I had no ring of wealth so 1/7k it is, luckily i got pet few kills after that

whats the easiest way to get these?

So there's no possible way of tracking 1000 boss kills over the course of 1 month for example?
---
price manipulating xd?

False
---
Nerf! I‚Äôve seen too many rare drops on reddit on release day has to be op! &gt;:( /s

I see it more as a boss pet, which you can only fight through clues.

Good thing you opened your cock holster about downvoting the post because if you didn't, literally no one would have noticed
---
Also requires agility to stay up there...

I'm not sure what this is but I enjoyed watching it. That first piece looked really cool.

Why prims before tassets? It's 30m+ for a +1 str bonus

You can use your home pc and google desktop in every 15-18 minutes to re absorption

Thats why its mostly in f2p they get banned to quit to go mem and the PvP cheats....i say make all add-ons banable love how kids try to roast me for never useing runelite
---
Average clue loot goes up 7.5k that is completely insignificant
---
mems was worse not one training player was legit
---
The seller listed it for 1M
---
Its crazy, the mods should instantly ban his accounts on stream.
---
You're thinking of rs3.
---
I would start leveling range and strength so that you get at least 50 range and higher str (the higher the better for both, but try not to get your hp too high) and then I'd go on and get mithril gloves and ava's accumulator (optional but recommended). For a basic msb gmaul pure, that's really all you need to be successful, but being good at it is the more difficult part.
---
If you want to create a higher cb pure such as a baby pure or a regular 60 attack pure, you should not train your stats the normal way until you map out every quest needed for the account. For example, if you complete waterfall, tree gnome village, vampire slayer, fight arena, or other quests that give attack xp, you will have to do those first. So, if you're getting 60 atk eventually, be sure to complete all of those quests before actually getting 60 atk.

You can save loot tracker on closing the client ftfy

This double chest is super sick for barrows enthusiasts like myself
---
I wonder if sending in a support ticket  to jagex would help?
---
Or just afk on mobile with chat hidden thats how I play 90% of the time lol
---
Doesn't the town of Slepe lack a quest?
---
Wrong version of the song, here.

I have a job, 50m please?
---
Cuz dhide shields are p2p
---
I gotta got 2 go?
---
I know one sold for 60m about 10 hours ago. Uncertain what value is currently though.
---
Nah it's annoying as fuck and got old after the first hour of its existence.
---
Ah yes, this is what uses up all your rng, as opposed to any other of the countless lucky things that have likely happened on the way to reaching Lv. 91 Slayer for Cerberus.
---
Plot twist - they're not TVs - they're posters
---
Underwater thieving gives you better than EHP rates combining both skills
---
If items are shared, they show across the log. So if you get a D Pick from anywhere, it shows for every boss that drops it. Not ideal, but it was how they went about it due to data storage or what not.
---
lol bet
---
Can you make a plug-in that randomizes the in game music? I love listening to the in game tracks but I hate having to randomly click one every few minutes.
---
Gg account
---
Yeah, remap some keys then, like the other guy said :) If you need help making an AHK script, let me know and I'll make you one when I'm awake ^^^in ^^^13 ^^^hours, ^^^fuck ^^^having ^^^a ^^^sleeping ^^^disorder
---
How'd your WPM turn out?
---
Heavy wheezing
---
That's not an opinion
---
A redwood shortbow at 95 Fletch and longbow at 98 Fletch that requires 70 range?
---
We aren‚Äôt scared in America
---
meant obby neck
---
checked your attack options, mate?
---
Nice. Was wondering why your personal best was 90 minutes with 99 range
---
Whatta ya mean drawing super generic and weirdly proportioned women and loosely attributing them to obscure Runescape characters isn‚Äôt art?
---
What does 'if you have stash units built' mean? (english isnt my first language)
---
Lmaooooooooo
---
Did they get paid tho
---
Still me at 90, bigger noob than lots of people half my level
---
Ninety-five thousand feathers
---
Damn you scraped the barrel here bro üòÇ
---
You probably can tbh, not with a name like Randall though.
---
Just spam dig on random gold bars when you're selling yourself as gf after a trip to the make-over mage!
---
Shout at the devil!
---
All I need is the ring and the blessing
---
dang, i had 2/3 in 40kc currently at 620 and still searching for the last piece. I've had 4 unsireds since the two pieces.
---
Wut
---
Nice 
---
Yeah i have no friends either
---
There's places near emote clues where you can store the items needed for that clue. Basically just reduces bank trips
---
Add me
---
No it's just very very low for the effort expended.
---
Loads of stuff is BIS but not obtainable for pures. So the fact that I said BIS for pures and mains isnt really all that weird considering the amount of pures there are in this game.
---
This image makes me want to start playing again.
---
Runelite said the actively traded price was 50,5k lol
---
u/title2imagebot
---
Not worth doing, lol. Why kill healers when you can just ignore them? That makes zero since. It's also not easy to tank it at 40def. You're just showing me you've never actually tried and are talking out of your ass.
---
Chocolate eclair?
---
I've done jad so many times it's ridiculous. There's no way you can tank two healers at 42 def wearing void, at the very least it's far from worth doing since there are much easier methods. You'll be getting hit 11 hp almost every attack. He didn't get trucked. You got lucky.
---
Lolol that‚Äôs exactly what I did!GZ
---
If you couldn‚Äôt spec someone out in one tick everyone would just tele and nobody would ever get a kill
---
They'll poll Authenticator Delay and only let Twitch viewers vote
---
But what was the meme
---
You just pray melee and blowpipe it with rigour/eagle eye, disregarding the minions. Do **NOT** run around like the wiki says to because it summons more candy bomb attacks (guaranteed 12-36+ damage). Just stand still and if it opens its mouth wide, then you can run.
---
Source: died to it one time listening to wiki then easily killed it after
---
Anyone flame this kid for advertising pservers yet?
---
Havent went back to his videos since
---
its a quote in a rs3 quest i think when u try to use an abyssal whip on a chained npc
---
Yeah those people at Ironside are all just irresponsible kids throwing their money at people. The whole marketing team is full of children. Amazing how they even got hired.
---
It‚Äôll also be listed under kbd, chaos elemental, callisto, and vennenatis. Drops that come from multiple sources are shared
---
ooh, i didn't know that. Thanks a ton for the info!
---
I would. I drop all my useless stuff to the main. Like elder chaos druid robes, or granite hammer. Extra barrows peices. Saradomin swords
---
Check my other comment for my rudimentary strategy
---
Brother, if you think people care more about 3rd age than rangers...
---
How does an ironman not realize the value of rangers?  I think you spent too much time at the Todt my friend
---
Didn‚Äôt black out your friends list from 04, RIP account bud.
---
Bye ;(
---
Ahh common mistake. Rangers come from medium clues, not masters. Good thing you uploaded before doing too many!! /s
---
Just remember that'd a a smaller crab. Their legspan can grow up to 12 feet (~4m)
