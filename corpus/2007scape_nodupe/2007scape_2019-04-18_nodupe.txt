If you make a skill too simple, it just becomes super boring and nobody would care to put time into it other than to get 99 or important milestones, warding changes that and makes the skill interactive and deeper than other skills where you just buy resource, click and wait for it to be created.
---
---
---
korasi wasn't even op. it maxed like 65. Double specing was pretty op though lol, but that took the rigour and some timing.
---
Just breathe
---
Feels good having no temptation to ever stake and get caught up in the vicious loop.
---
1. Make it unwieldable.
---

---
2. Make it a spade.
---
I had an offer in the GE for 20M on the first day, found out it was a fun weapon, and noped the fuck out. I want my bling to dig.
---
those are just band aids.
---
and i wasn't talking about combat anyway.
---

---
You could try tick eating with a bunch of purple sweets.
---
Oh cool, thanks
---
I know I'll get it eventually but I probably will post as well
---
Nowhere in that did I say liberals are easily-offended souls. I said the right uses edgy jokes to offend the left. Is that not true?
---
max cb \*\*\* afk nmz
---
Love the videos, you're sick
---
Because the majority of end-products are currently members items. 
---
Crossbows, bolts, wooden shields, ballista, half of the fletchable arrow types, all of the darts, and all of the Javelins. 
---
You'd be making an entire skill F2P just to gain access to creating 10 types of bows and 5 types of arrows. Or you'd be making a ton of combat gear F2P for ranging.
---
He won't get bullied. There is plenty of accounts identical to that build. Overheads are only necessary for brid pking.
---
OP, that's a fine build. You don't need to max either. Start off with 50 attack, 60 strength, and 70 range.
---
ah hell yeah with some Heinz ketchup
---
Pass crab boy.
---
First priority should be establishing your block list. Figure out what you hate slaying and block them. Since you already have slayer rings and helm, I‚Äôd say get bigger and badder for superior monster spawns, and then maybe a herb pouch.
---
Ahh I guess it was just timing. Guess I'll shelf the tinfoil hat
---
let me live vicariously through you
---
Well you can enjoy it alot without it, and do lots of things. but with all the quests and skills and areas that come with the membership its alot faster and wider. helps get through the early struggle.
---
I can't even prayer flick evn with all of runelite help
---
There's a different clan that runs the 1250, 1500, 1750 and 2000 worlds at Revs. Just ask some of the people defending the caves about joining.
---
We were all there once. Good memories haha, don't let him get scammed!
---
The way they use the term "ward" in Warding is inappropriate anyway. What are we trying to ward off with our wards? Nothing. It doesn't make sense. Runecrafting on the other hand could just as well mean drawing runes on armour, as well as rune stones. A rune, after all, is just a symbol.
---
It's the shitty millennial/zoomer culture where achieving something isn't enough of an award, they must post pictures of it on social media for validation of how amazing they are from their peers/strangers.
---
Hence why I said "potentially" but is also too vague for what I'm looking for. So, technically is the correct answer but not an end all be all.

---
Don't care anymore I'll prolly still play either way.
---
Rip. I saw the VoD this morning, shortly after it ended.
---
If you're going to train it bankstanding you'll just buy Vis, buy Wardstones and buy Cloth then level it like crafting anyway.
---
Bonds don't remove gp?

nice man! Post up when you got dragon slayer done :)

---
If you are a normal player, don‚Äôt waste slayer points on rune pouch. Buy a tier 7 from a pker and buy at bh store. Use a trusted cc like ‚Äúemblem area‚Äù and use a ranked middle man
---
This has to be on par with handing your sibling a crack pipe.
---
I'd agree with that as well. But it's not great to have to lose something we already have.
---
&gt; Nowhere in that did I say liberals are easily-offended souls
---
so you're saying that liberals aren't easily offended?
---
Or, "rune craft." You're using skill at drawing runes to both create runestones and apply runes to armour.
---
ü¶ÄI have no opinion unless it has 100+ upvotes and multiple reddit postsü¶Ä
---
You're probably right, I think we're both right - RuneScript is pretty shitty and they don't have enough QA.
---
we need less of you and more of OP in the game
---
Well pray flick is reflexes. Tick eating is all about timing.
---
It's not that we want to have our cake and eat it too. It's that we're a community that consists of thousands upon thousands of players, half of which are consistently in favor of having it, and the other half are consistently in favor eating it. And then there's those damn centrists who want to keep half and eat half...
---
Then it's not as complicated as you made it out to be
---
No

Swampletics is the runescape character name of the youtuber known as Settled. This account is an ultimate Ironman which is the runescape gamemode where the character can‚Äôt trade other players, use the grand exchange, or even use the bank. He had also self-locked himself to only playing in the area of the game known as Morytania. This means he has super limited access to game content and typically spends hundreds of hours grinding for gear that is his best in slot (but is typically considered really low tier gear for everyone else playing normally). Then takes on the highest level challenges for that area. This art depicts his battle against a quest boss that was quite the challenge considering his gear was inadequate due to his area lock and trade/bank restrictions. Check out his series on YouTube, it‚Äôs one of the most popular RuneScape series ever!
---
that's nutty.
---
When I see someone suggest to remove polling it makes me think they don't know how this game came to be
---
50/50
---
why is 99 crafting required for efficient bossing then?
---
True. Also tried the slayer helm as the poll itself, or someone in graceful. Didn't like though.
---
you fuck off, earn it.
---
Buy gold bars &gt; smith into gold jewelry
---
It's one of the best f2p money makers
---
No you where talking about qol, and I simply pointed out the qol in this update was magic.
---
And it's not just a bandaid.
---
Magic is complex and heavily gear reliant, while that gear also has to take in the big list of spells and magic attacks.
---
Totally true and not enough people realise this. Toast and cereals are processed by the body as pure glucose
---
Yea, I have a gmauler with 96 strength and no overheads. Have you been on PVP worlds? Lol
---
its a wake up call
---
You either get warding or you don't
---
But that's the point? Nobody wants the poll, so PvPers threatening to vote it in.
---
As a whole yes

End of OSRS if warding passes
---
Where's Slayer 2?
---
What's an ass mixtape?
---
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee4eeee
---
No idea bro :(
---
Sure, the Korsai didn't hit harder than an AGS, but the reason why it was so OP is because the special rolled as magic damage, which was super bullshit for bridding.
---
I wouldn't call it flexing when people consider starting in "06" to be veteran LUL
---
Two skills also failed polling, Sailing was only a close loss. Jagex dangling new BiS mage armour with the potential for meta breaking changes is not the way to poll for a new skill.
---
Hmm now that I think about it, stealing creation was a great minigame and I guess warding ties into that. As far as existing minigames go, ba can be revamped but I saw some new stuff. 
---
Castle wars is dead,
---
 , trouble brewing??, fight pit, fishing trawler
---
No I‚Äôm saying the game we are all clamouring to get back too, the game of everyone‚Äôs nostalgia is nothing like how people vote and what there hoping for today, they‚Äôre two separate ideas. The game change incredibly and the meta was never stable, everyone was learning everything from 2001-7. The amount of over thinking and insane desire for a ‚Äòperfectly balnce‚Äô stable meta game is crazy. The game we love was birthed out of chaos and crazy changes. Is warding perfect now? Possible not, but what people now a days expect and want for the game will ultimately kill it.
---
At one point im pretty sure you could have your bots squad up and do it together. I have no doubt in my mind that there are sophisticated teams of bots doing Raids right now. Probably making a lot of money too
---
It‚Äôs shit like this that makes me hate this community. They give and give. Yes they fuck up but damn you act like 2 ppl are doing anything
---
I just don't like the concept at all. I like most of what is proposed as warding, but battle wards look tedious and out of place.
---
So what you want is what RS3 has. Cosmetic overrides. Or if you want D-Full into PHat, a keepsake.
---
Ghrazi rapier has 12 less str bonus than chaotic rapier did. It's close, but chaotic wins out with a 3 higher max hit with super str, slayer helm, and piety. Still, for all the whining people have about dung rewards there's pretty much equivalents for the most OP ones already in the game, and then there's BP which blows all of them out of the water.
---
Wintertodt is Definitely a step in the right direction for firemaking imo
---
Poor guy.
---
Never in osrs hopefully
---
how about weenie
---
It's not the final process that's complicated, it's getting to that point. Unlike Smithing which uses a single resource, and Crafting which uses two although one comes from a vendor and is stackable, Warding as proposed uses at minimum 4 resources, and all of them are player sourced.
---
A statement like that can‚Äôt hardly be seen as a complaint, but yeah, meme away.
---
I agree with this sentiment. I have a maxed pure too and if the triangle becomes more balanced under a different build, I'm all for it. There's a big potential to fix PvP issues with warding.
---
like when you talk and do purple: or something like that
---
You might want to crop this

Was it that ironman that had like 130 something EHP in the first week?

Whine about literally everything that is only whined about by other people first. This sub is pretty toxic and bandwagon-y. It's cool to see fellow players achievements but that's about it. Stop crying about things and stop losing your accounts by trying to buy firecapes/gold/fighter torso and coming here saying "I dindu nuffin".

 But what items do i need. i know ill be using graceful for running alot but yea i know i need pots to plant and cash to pay the worker. what else? and like is there patches only for fruit tree and patches only for regular tree or what? i would like a more clear explanation. Can you like do a step by step 1,2,3... would be more clear thank you!

Just stop being poor

I got that same thing happen yesterday.
---
everyone's strategy will be slightly different 
---
you'll get better results taking five minutes to Google and read a guide and adjusting it to your stats/gear rather than asking to be hand-held on reddit especially with such basic questions
---
Reason being spaghetti code would make it hard for an item other than a normal spade to work with anything, and considering how many things you use the spade for, it's just too much work for a cosmetic item.
---
Power move
---
Thanks, the first step I would take is cancel warding.
---
Again, extremely hostile over a post about a video game. I'm here if you need to talk to someone man. We all are.

Hahaa oh no leaking BTW! Oh gee hhahaah here we go again!!

I agree with your comment, one of the problems is that the current player base were huge noobs pre eoc.  And they the masses now making discussions with little to no knowledge of how good 2011 was.

Thats a yikes from me, pal.

You need to be accepted first. Get back to me when you're a member of widely known game company! I'll gladly accept your opinion on the matter!
---
New skills always seem to go through an initial phase where they're disliked. Then a year or two later after they've received the ironing you mention, they're loved. Unfortunately that initial phase of dislike combined with the poll system will likely kill almost any skill they suggest.
---
Alright sounds good.
---
if you trap the giant scarab on the north pond in a special spot you can attack it as many times as you want and the helpers will never spawn. I use this method in my B gloves speedrun and it works without prayer and with tick eating.

---
Im hyped for warding, mainly becayse new skill= nee content and possibly new mini games in the future. I think itll be a nice change
---
Maxed rigor account is bar none the best range build period.  Do that.
---
Wtf, why are we fighting about warding when that‚Äôs more important.
---
Alternatuvely: a pet that is free to insure (So that you can flex while pking, and I'm sure that even though these players have way too much money already, they'll not pay for the insurance to pk with them), but costs max cash. If it gets polular enough, it basically markets itself.
---
I agree that Skilling should not be #1 best money maker because as you said, not much skill and it's almost always safe, but it does take dedication and time so I think there should be viable money to be made in skilling. I think something like 20-25% of all skills are combat related, I don't think those few skills should have like all of the top 15 money makers in the game. The bigger issue right now is bots imo.
---
do some nmz, rack up points for a few days. then just redeem the herb boxes. If you log in and collect herb boxes once a day for 14 days you can get around 2.1m, which helps reduce how much you need for the next bond significantly. it's basically free money for free xp
---
Nah nah working as intended. The gold trim just makes it so they aren't good for climbing obstacles.
---
you're right, completely looked over that.

Guess i'll leave this up in case anyone else overlooked it

Not true, somebody who wants to get laid but can't is involuntarily celibate. And if you've ever been on r9k for more than an 15 minutes you know there's more to it than misogynistic drivel, stop believing everything 2nd hand sources tell you.
---
You must not use runelite then. Consistent 50fps with almost no drops on PC, smooth as butter
---
Those are actually cool af. Where‚Äôd you find ‚Äòem
---
For me it was always that i just dont get how it works. I watched tutorials and it sounds like such a hassle so i dont see the point. I only really see myself picking it up when i want another 99, cause apparently it‚Äôs relatively quick to get. Im assuming a couple months?
---
Exactly. Having skills gets in the way of the riveting RuneScape combat system.
---
ü§ö
---
Maybe add a little firemaking in as well
---
The imbue would be tradable. Yeah the imbue would be worth more than the ring, if you wanted it to be a 1:1 drop rate then there's an argument for that.

Just got a dragonbone necklace from Vorkath. Is it useful to keep it, or should I just sell it? I don't have the 80 prayer to wear it yet (76 right now) but getting 85 for the desert elite diary is in the plans for the relatively near future. And if I should keep it, what are good situations to use it in?
---
I feel like this is the backup plan in case it fails the poll. A lot of it's elements can be added to skills like crafting/smithing while needing magic/runecrafting. 
---
Though I've seen opinions about some skills are already bloated as is, so a magic based assembly skill to categorize that stuff has some merit too.
---
I did this and highly recommend it, I think I went with a mod or whatever on the clan chat so I paid about 400k more but felt more secure
---
kinda? you're better off not training any defense with your melee since you'll burst it basically to 99, so controlled is kinda wasting 1/3 of your exp. best off using a bludgeon and training str probably.
---
You sure you aint pressing CTRL?

I really don't get how they think its a good prices in 2019, I got 3 months on xbox live for ¬£10 the other day which give me free games each month, I really don't understand it, I wanna buy membership, I'd probably play way more if I did, but I'm not paying ¬£7 a month for it, ¬£5 maybe.

Oh fuck you right, I don‚Äôt know what I want, Jagex does though. They know I want no wilderness, no free trade, MTX, dungeoneering, powercrept weapons, unnecessary meta advances, etc. Oh wait, I don‚Äôt. 
---
It‚Äôs not like we are boycotting the game and threatening to DDoS the servers, and of course no one knows what the skill is actually going to be, but I do know how I feel about the skill based off of the blogpost, and they are literally asking for criticism. Saying stuff like ‚ÄúSeems over complicated,‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want new BiS mage armor,‚Äù is literally what they are asking for, stop acting like reddit is a bunch of idiots because they are doing exactly what was asked of them.
---
I wish I could feel that happy about a trailer.
---
Cautious =\= unable to compromise
---
I see some people suggesting changes and removals, *but they still want the skill*.
---
Wintertodt rendered Firemaking a minigame. It‚Äôs not even really a skill anymore. That‚Äôs a good update, then? It improved the skill? Maybe.
---
Warding is a lot better of a skill than fucking woodcutting or firemaking. Not even wanting to try it is just close minded. Making the game better can coexist with adding skills.
---
Move warding stuff to runecrafting?
---
Reminder to vote no on all PvP polls
---
RS3 and OSRS have two different development teams.
---
Bro FUCK roaches
---
D
---
Go get hired and do their job, guy.
---
It's technically not efficient to do slayer until 90 combats.
---
To answer the question, no it isn't efficient to use controlled, because 1/3rd of the exp is going to defence, which is efficiently trained through chins or bursting. You should be doing \~5 strength levels with a bludgeon, then 5 attack levels with a whip until 99
---
So your logic is that it would take a thousand more hours to fully level 4 more skills, therefore it would take over half a year to level one skill. 
---
Ok....,
---
Lol!!
---
And PkMn to Prayer
---
A line of thinking about this is if you train strength and attack first you'll hit higher and more accurately, giving you faster xp, which can then be channelled to defence
---
Oh no, did you get your feelings hurt?
---
They all make a difference.
---
I agree. I‚Äôd love me some dungeoneering and chaotics. Vote no to permanent lvl 65 bis gear!
---
The thing that killed the game was EOC. The rip off WoW shitty combat system. All the updates prior may have killed a tiny player base however the game was flourishing and growing rapidly. This skill fits perfectly within the lore, explains a lot, stays true to OSRS, adds new things to OSRS to healthily grow the game. It‚Äôs the perfect skill if a skill were to be released, a skill that doesn‚Äôt drastically change the game, but adds so much new content while staying true to the game itself.
---
Development teams yes. But I'm assuming they share the same team for engine work. Or possibly the OSRS team that works on the engine got requested to assist with RS3's mobile. (Shrugs)
---
Yeah for sure jagex could have easily cheated on past polls if they wanted to. They could show whatever results they wanted on public polls
---
the max ive gotten from an easy clue is 200k, wtf
---
Before the farming guild, I only trained farming to make sure tears of guthix went on runecradting lol
---
Fuck me yeah i wouldnt spend on farming. 
---
Probably go the break-even route (trees apparently?) with the occasional herb runs for profit
---
Duradel and Nieve not Duradel and Steve
---
MacH did this on his 10hp ironman
---
I always loved dungeneering they should add stealing creation too
---
What's your construction level? A budget alternative to using an ornate pool would be to build a restoration pool (requires level 57 with a crystal saw and spicy stews) to restore your special attack energy, build an altar to restore your prayer, and eat a bunch of cheap food at a bank. Including the cost of adding those two rooms to your house, that'd cost you under 300k, not counting any training costs if you don't have level 57 already.
---
The runescape community needs fewer people like you.

NGL, tried playing rs3 a couple weeks ago. and the worst thing about that game is the interface. the content is actually pretty good and PvM might actually be more fun than osrs IMO. but the interface was ass and the bank system was shit. so im back to osrs

The drama is unreal what will happen next

way too far dude

The people saying they are older and have the better opinions, it‚Äôs no different than the elderly complaining 18 year olds or even 30 year olds get to vote.

What about the imbues from other stores, such as the emblem store?  Should that be moved too?
---
Dune movie?
---
Exactly? It just makes a massive gap in general game efficiency between people who do and dont have the skill maxed. One skill should not affect the training and usage of every other skill so strongly, it's already what makes agility an obnoxious aspect of the game. You're forced into training it because if you don't, you're left in the dust by people who do have it trained. Locking off something as broken as instant bank depositing and doubled inventory to lvl 96 just makes the rich get richer.
---
What do you mean.. its not like a pair of boots that gives only a single more strength costs 33m more....

Thanks lol

Hey that‚Äôs my line.

I bet you like slayer

Don‚Äôt do what? Get excited for a movie?

Microsoft = multi Million pound company that can afford to give out games and have thousands of revenue sources and is one of the biggest tech giants in the world 
---
Jagex = small company that makes their primary source of income from this one game, content costs a lot of money to make and as a community we have become very demanding, surprisingly  keeping up with this costs money. Running the company costs MONEY. ¬£7 is not a ridicules amount to pay. Running a mmorpg costs a lot and what we all seem to forget is that this is a business and at the end of the day they need to make money
---
If it stopped at 99 and didn‚Äôt go to 120 I‚Äôd be in
---
The force awakens was great, last Jedi was such a huge disappointment to so many people. The trailer looks sweet, but yeah no telling how the movie will turn out :/
---
Definitely interested in it!
---
Let‚Äôs assume that from 92 to 99 farming it requires exactly 6.5 million xp 
---
The run:
---
2 tree runs a day with x5 magic saplings 
---
1 fruit tree run a day with x5 dragonfruit 
---
1 calquat run a day with x1 calquat
---
1 celastras  run a day with x1 celastras 
---
In total, you‚Äôd get approx 255k xp a day. 
---
6.5 million total / 255k per day = 25.49 days 
---
So from 92 to 99 farming it takes 23.52 days. We can assume that 1-99 is going to take at least 51 days. I say at least because generally speaking, the initial farm runs are shit xp and you won‚Äôt be able to do calquat nor celastras
---
Booming social life, eh?

It‚Äôs wild. I‚Äôve played for 15+ years but my friends who have been for a year deserve the same amount of voting power.
---
That's basically reddit as a whole.
---
But where do you store your magic tablet trunks?
---
two things osrs doesn't have like most mmorpg games are mounts and different race characters, but we do have green,blue,pale,purple, and really dark skin. I am waiting for red,pink,yellow, and orange skin ect.
---
literally every guide says 85+ needed minimum 90+ recommended
---
You could tie in Crystal bow and shield imbues to priffidinas. Though the msb and row imbue from wildy shop are fine imo.
---
oh yeah that

All these unsure idiots. 20 or less = broken fire cape that cost 50k to repair. 21 or greater is bye bye cape
---
Read the latest blog post form OSRS website. They‚Äôre trying to introduce a new skill.
---
MAHOGAny
---
Anytime
---
I'm training it right now
---
OSRS has a better multiplayer/social aspect than most other games that label themselves as MMO's in my experience.
---
Imagine being
---
No vannaka
---
Personally I disagree, and I've been playing since classic. I never liked nor partook in PvP and wouldn't at all even think it was ever the primary focus. 
---
That said, it was always present and had its place, both in PKing and minigames. I wouldn't want it to get shut down or crippled.
---
EZ af to do on a main tho, buy imps and do that shit, whether it takes you 50 or 500, still so much faster than grinding it on an ironman. I got them on similar clue count to yours in the pic, but all from Varrock guards, no imps. Suck my tits.
---
Can you drop trade in iron man? Or use an alt?
---
Rees in Runespan
---
you were in the extreme minority if you really played in classic/early rs2 and didn't focus on the wild.
---
Just rake patches.
---
That's been known to happen in some shitty private servers, and one time range str was added onto melee str in the real RuneScape. It was called the julage glitch and led to some pretty epic hits.
---
Ty im just getting into the bossing range and am curious where to start.
---
Ava‚Äôs picks up 80% because you don‚Äôt have ds2 done. Also it‚Äôs a chance, each dart has a 80% chance of not breaking or dropping, each time it‚Äôs thrown. Like chaos altar but more percent
---
This is the best type of loot in game
---
Brings a whole new meaning to the term ghosted. RIP
---
Same my dude
---
Alt+f4 yourself

FOE, MM, TLP, and FI all allowed up to 20 or even 30 def and people definitely used to wear Mystic and Initiate during wars, I've literally seen it myself 12 or 13 years ago.

Well ok

Any suggestions to someone who liked Skyrim and osrs? I‚Äôm bored and need fun games
---
Ingredients: Chook shit, Cow shit, Horse shit, hay, assorted fruit and veg scraps
---
I propose a small rolling ball of coins
---
Whats that item?:o
---
As others said, salve (ei) and Elite void are necessary for Vorkath, but also do try to get your range up to at least 90 if you want to do consistent kills without it being too much of a pain.
---
My friends were the same. Quests were where it was at. When rs2 hit and they released runecrafting it was a Holy Shit moment of how amazing it was. Making your own runes! And music! 
---
If it was a minority opinion then we were a big enough minority to not feel like one, you know?
---
Imagine not knowing this reference on as her on the other end lol.  The million different ways to interpret this.
---
Seems pretty reasonable.
---
One additional thing I'd add is that they can rebalance the existing mage armors without warding.
---
Like changing the blue skirt into wizard robe bottoms without warding isn't going to shatter the game
---
Was his user name 'A Black Guy' or something? If so I used to see that dude everywhere
---
This is 2007scape.
---
This is what a lot of people have been thinking, I feel. Runecrafting has been getting a bad reputation for the longest time and so many opportunities to freshen it up, completely missed. 
---
I was hoping they'd put the rune pouch in runecrafting of all things, but nah, slayer shop didn't have enough rewards apparently. I would be all for runecrafting getting an expansion of sorts to include imbuing items, which is exactly what runecrafting deals with..
---
What's most impressive about that game to me is how stock looks so beautiful even with shit textures.
---
What's wrong with getting caught up in something I enjoy?
---
play game for like 2 hours and cash in for mad karma. Not bad
---
Hope you have that on an SSD or that you really like waiting
---
It's ok the wiki, dingle berry.
---
All I want is a pertinent example or three to prove the point. If you can't even think of one off the top of you head, they're probably not all that important.
---
Who downvoted this
---
Spaghetti code
---
Summoning or Conjuring would be something I would be excited about but at the same time idk
---
Yet they've failed every skill that's been offered? Honestly, I say let warding pass and good riddance to the few people who leave due to it. Guarantee it won't be that many.
---
God forbid he ask a question that he could figure out on his own even easier.
---
This guy fucks
---
We need more charity wells
---
Congrats dude

Pegs are shit? Hot take
---
Wow nostalgia flashback
---
Sulliusceps are fun too. I tried them out the other day to get some crafting pies to boost for a skills necklace and really enjoyed it.
---
Think it has more to do with the support of new players. This community supports helping new players because we have all learned so much from RuneScape and want to encourage others to learn the grind.
---
If they were to add a new minigame (specifically with the theme of magic), they could easily add imbues to that reward system and it make sense.
---
I fully support this besides the passive XP gain from being nearby your party. This has very high abuse potential.
---
I had this error to just restarted runelite and workt for me.
---
If they added something like this today this sub would complain that it's dead content or catering to Ironmen.
---
The GE will only change X amount each day. I think 5%. With new items, or old items that were changed in some significant way, it can take a while for the GE to show an accurate price. People were doing the same scam with dragon swords when they changed to drop from CoX to Wyrms. Price dropped from like 2m to 200k but the GE didn't show it for a couple weeks.
---
I agree, I feel they have a solid understanding of their current playerbase and understand what mistakes of the past they shouldn't make. I think giving the players all the power in directing the game was a good day to start but I think it's a trend that should die out. But I don't think it'll ever happen again.
---
Heyyyy! Me too, I was having so much trouble getting dumpstered by the frosty bois that I ground Defence on the muggers for a couple hours and got high enough that I could run past and escape.
---
Then why not just threaten to release eoc alongside it? Get your tinfoil hat on.
---
As much as I think that the idea of voting yes to removing a skill like farming just cause you don‚Äôt like it is dumb, you can‚Äôt really just ‚Äúnot do farming‚Äù if you plan to reach endgame content. It is literally essential for raiding.
---
No one plays Xbox thats why
---
I agree, that was the most ‚Äúreaching‚Äù part for me too.
---
So just shove all the rewards onto PvM? And we already got a boss that drops the best mage gear. We don't really need an upgrade in the high end; it is the low end where the problems are.
---
Anyway, you don't seem to have any answers to the small issue of training the skill. "We'll figure something out" is not an answer. Players have been trying to solve these sorts of problems for a decade and I think the closest we've came is [GentleTractor's Sailing](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4n61nb/the_sailing_skill_revisited/) pitch. But while that may be the best-realized version I've seen, it still doesn't solve all the issues.
---
Also, there is nothing saying we couldn't get Warding in 2019 and then Sailing in the future. But whether Warding passes or fails, they aren't going to offer Sailing anytime soon. It would take too long to get a design for Sailing and go through all the revisions based on feedback for it to make the release window and if Warding fails, they likely already have other options lined up. We may not always get the best ideas right now but that doesn't mean we should oppose the current ideas just because better ones exist.
---
Boo you stink
---
Real chads just tele to varrock g.e
---
This artwork and art style are really something else. I swear this sub has lately been just all about ranting and drama but this is truly something refreshing and top-notch quality.
---
OP I'd love to see more artwork and hopefully something in a format suitable as a wallpaper.
---
I like the idea of a skill giving value to otherwise basically useless items via dismantling, dissolving, whatever you call it. However most of the rest of it just seems completely broken, completely useless, or easily bundled into currently existing skills as new training options.
---
Anyone know when the Easter Event ends?
---
Then obviously you are wielding the zammy hasta.
---
have you seen the shit osrs shits out for its holiday events? XD its just as bad if not worse than rs3s overrides. at this point, you cant really make that argument anymore.
---
Like he didnt intent Bob to be an angry black guy? Or for women to be easier to pickpocket from then men?
---
He did address a point or two. You blind or just ignorant?
---
I do think that a lot of the aspects seem kinda poorly designed, but I would rather add the new skill with only the parts that I liked than just add it to runecrafting as many people have suggested. Adding a new skill is (in my eyes) the first step towards giving the osrs devs more creative freedom to break off from the maximum efficiency and late game content exclusively, which is what most of the reddit community is interested in.
---
Or maybe, you genuinely enjoyed the variety in combat that wasn't your guy splashing for 10 minutes to get 100 XP.
---
I'll do it for 49.
---
In that time you took to be an asshole you couldve simply typed out "North Fally"  
---
What a prick.
---
Fuck off you homophobe. The whole rs community exploded because we had a small pride event.
---
Defending the anti gay speech and actions on this sub is gross.
---
There is absolutely a gap in mage gear but these "veterans" don't give a shit since we've already got ancestral. I for one welcome these new additions, with revisions of course. Battle wards and conjuring are a bad idea, and it seems they've acknowledged it so I don't get why there's such a fuss. People in this subreddit just like to circlejerk.
---
People hate firemaking? Considering it basically goes hand in hand with woodcutting (easily the most favorite gathering skill) I thought people leveled it really fast.
---
He's not complaining about *people* complaining, he's complaining that *you're* complaining about people complaining.
---
Need someone that can hold a 2h in one hand.
---
I can tell you got that big dick energy
---
Lol keep thinking that
---
i might not do it though like i used to. maybe only if rewards are good enough, or maybe make dungeneering a minigame in which it is a viable way to train all gathering skills where u get low xp for many skills but the equivlanet of earning like 70/k per hour. similar to underwater agility/thieving idea but with alot more skills.
---
Have literally never heard this
---
Hell yeah, love me some Unlike Pluto
---
Where is the lie
---
I‚Äôm a little confused now.. what is it that you think people should be doing with their lives?
---
I'm doing what the previous guy mentioned. Tele to clan wars to bank/heal. Tele to relekka house to restore spec. Go fight Zulrah.
---
I'm averaging 1.5-2mil an hour (less than 100KC so not hugely accurate) whilst not being too sweaty about it. So still seams better of than say barrows.
---
The thing I find about Zulrah is the drops are very consistent - so it loses a bit of the excitement in getting rarer drops.
---
agility bad rc good
---
Their swag tho
---
Yikes. No they didn‚Äôt. You didn‚Äôt war then. Even if you had that defense level you weren‚Äôt allowed to wear that gear. If you did it was a DQ. You really shouldn‚Äôt comment if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
Is it more profitable than mlode? Never done it.
---
Actually there is 105 sharks in inventory, gf you
---
Group Ironman has been suggested many times. I am totally on board with it however this is not a new suggestion.
---
that's a really well thought out argument you've got there.
---
It's so perfect that you unlock the best method to train it at level 23. VERY cool!
---
Wowzers u sound like an intellectual powerhouse

Why waste the wood when you can fletch it.

Wheres the voter reform trudeau

Yeah agreed, its too bad there really isnt a lot of education surrounding pornography. High speed internet porn is a new domain. I guarantee internet porn is the first "sexual experience" for most boys/girls living in a modern country.
---
Do you know how far the conversation got,  or what some of the bigger roadblocks were?
---
go play rs3 then? Why are you here lmao
---
Well sure.That ship sailed with the zulrah drop table though, not vorkath. Now if it's high tier it has to compete in some fashion or whats really the point. Not a perfect logic, but it is the logic.
---
Found one lmao
---
Sorry waaaaaat
---
This is too real
---
The In Aid of the Myreque quest laid the groundwork for what I think could be a great use of Construction. 
---
Instead of being used solely in your POH, you could also help build up NPC settlements with Construction. With higher levels you could unlock things like furnaces, maybe even banks, and eventually things like barricades and towers and whatnot. This would add some variety to Construction training. 
---
Maybe the NPCs could help you build stuff too. I'm imagining an RTS-ish Construction-based system where you could direct NPCs to build certain facilities over X period of time. This would be a lot slower than the current Construction training meta (repeatedly build and then destroy the same kind of furniture).
---
Yellow+black actually looks very nice for a skillcape.
---
What about the RC requirement already needed for making boots with the crystals from Cerberus
---
Spotted the 4channer. There are more effective ways to get your point across than being abrasive.

So... why do people like Slayer?

Oh my bad, they where being racist and homophobic at the SAME time.

Man you gotta stop wasting your time with these morons. In my experience all people come to this page for is to complain and bitch like a 4 year old. And then when you call them out for it they won‚Äôt even respond or they say something around the 4 IQ comment of ‚ÄúNo u‚Äù.
---
The bit that ultimately made me quit are the countless hours ive poured into the game and still im nowhere near completing my ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùshort term‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù goals. Im 18, going through college, and when you take a step back and realize that all the time invested in the game is instantly lost when you grow past it, it just seems foolish to spend even more time in it. 
---
In the time it takes to get 99 firemaking (literally the easiest, least respected achievement you can get) you could finish the entire RDR2 story. 99 agility? Fuck me how many experiences youre missing out on so you can run laps and have a bit better run energy. 
---
I love runescape but it takes too big of a part in life
---
well yes, but compared to this skill it seems easy on paper.
---
Hi, I hate annoying people with this kind of topic but I am scared to lose my runescape account forever. I made a reddit account just so I could address this because this is the first time I have ever been accused of something that I haven't done. 
---
I tried to log onto my runescape account today 
---
IGN: Arena Vault
---
and saw that my account was banned due to an incidence that happened on April 4th, 2019 for macroing. I have never botted or macroed on my account and didn't even play on the day Jagex said the macroing incidence occured. I havent been on runescape for about a month and the one time I did log in on like March 2nd I played for like 10 minutes. I logged on today April 18th (today) and saw this shocking message. I filed an appeal but that was the only thing I was able to do, and I'm very sad that all my progress that I made throughout the years could potentially be gone. I had so many good memories with friends and a sick account (to me) that was like level 123 with decent stats and I worked on all of that myself. I just hope that Jagex can figure out how this happened because I did not play on April at all (the time the ban occured) and I have never macroed or botted which I am not sure how to do either. You can check my IP address as well, and also I havent paid for members this month either so it wouldn't even make sense to bot/macro right? Also, why would I macro and bot an account that was like 1800+ total level the risk would be entirely too high. I can be completely transparent about this but please I need help.
---
Thanks,

? He said this is the worst Star Wars has ever been, my point was the prequels were beyond fucking worse lol.
---
Volcanic mine is criminally underrated on this sub. It's extremely low effort for 90k/hr and I really enjoyed getting 99 mining that way.
---
Dungeoneering was fun because it just kept getting better. At no point did it slow down in rewards and exponential do gains until level 113. Up until then it was new unlocks (shadow hood, hex bow), increasing chaotic items (staff wasn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs first pick, but eventually you can buy it with fuck you tokens), and of course the ridiculous xp/hour of an efficient 100+ team. Man I miss that shit.
---
&gt; The fact you‚Äôre talking for the majority is ridiculous
---
Learn to read? A lot =/= majority
---
&gt;aerial fishing is the only piece of dead content released
---
Ironically one of the ones that a lot of people feel is better designed, at least at the higher ends of play, although there's still criticisms about the exact mechanics that make solo Aerial Fishing suboptimal.
---
&gt;treasure trails expansion speaks heaps just on reddit alone with all the posts
---
It was a lot of content all at once but a lot of it was legit useless in game. People won't care about the new stuff except Beginner Clues and Mimics in just a bit, unless they get one as a drop.
---
&gt;Konar is a huge slayer master
---
A bad one that remains undertuned and should be rebalanced because her task pool is ridiculously bad.
---
&gt;farming guild didn‚Äôt add anything to ‚Äúdailyscape‚Äù that wasn‚Äôt already there
---
It added more to it, which is what I said
---
&gt;you don‚Äôt have to farm at all
---
If you want to do content that requires Farming like learning Raids or have long-term goals like maxing, yes you do.
---
&gt;dailies are usually pieces of content that are essential to progression of the game
---
There's no other content in this game that's essential to progression like Farming is. Dailies are a symptom of predatory monetization schemes that developers use to keep a sub count going and should never be encouraged.
---
&gt;Farming contracts was a great plus that is massively used by the community
---
Not without a downside, it really messed up prices of herbs and seeds, also lowering the price of potions by a lot. Could be a good or bad thing depending on your views but the negative trend they had on the economy is clear.
---
&gt;Lance is not BiS at any dragon besides Rune/Steel/Mith
---
Incredibly strong at Olm, rivaling the Scythe in solos. Also tied with DHCB at Vorkath where DHCB is more kills/hr but cost of bolts makes the gp/hr about equal.
---
&gt;absolutely beyond popular is flourishing
---
I chose these pieces of content on purpose because they were recent and examples of content that had overwhelmingly positive feedback but still had negatives associated with them that cause a lot of players to dislike them.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs a insanely good slayer master for ironmen and med-high levels
---
IDC about ironmen bc they chose to play in that game mode so what's good for them doesn't really matter to me. For main accounts though it's insanely bad and Hydra being attached to Konar is pretty annoying since it's basically just Turael skipping simulator.
---
&gt;Feels as if you‚Äôve read a comment or two and have based your opinion on that.
---
I'm a maxed player and I make it my goal to engage in all the content in the game for at least a couple of days each because I like having game knowledge pertaining to every aspect of the game.
---
Lmfao this plus that ^^ has people looking at me in the subway
---
are you suggestion that everyone in favor of Warding is literally being paid or are you just using "shills" as a vague put-down?
---
Melee is in front of range?
---
If you can, get a Lunar Isle tele portal. You can bank and eat cheap food there, and if you speak to a non-banker NPC without the seal of passage then they'll kick you off the island, taking you to the middle of Relekka marketplace. Much closer to the boat for vork than running from house portal
---
What? Shaq made a total ass hat out of himself.
---
Uh excuse me.. but when referring to Him we capitalize the first letter.. you uncultured swine. Hope God Ash can forgive you..
---
Yes and aimbot lol
---
You'll lose them them regardless if warding passes of fails. They stated multiple times they want to move imbues away from NMZ and they will do that just as easily without warding. I'm expecting powerleveling RC if warding fails.
---
Coming winter 2017

Aren‚Äôt dragon hides member‚Äôs only content?
---
Between levels 80-99 there are 10 specific slayer monsters, 1 being a pure boss edition, i.e. cerberus. Therefore, there is more than a 10 million exp gap, between 9 pure slayer monsters. Implying that 10 million exp warrants only 9 monsters to train on is laughable. You've hit the nail on the head though, slayer is by far the most popular skill in the game, so why would further adding to that and expanding the variety/areas be negative? I also stated that these new areas add new methods of training other skills, perhaps a point you missed. Each island could carry a new way to train a specific skill. The objective of this was not to serve a brand new skill completely refined with all mechanics, in a step by step method ready to be baked by jagex, it was made for pure discussion reasons. However, I cannot agree that supplying 9 monsters from 80-99 slayer (10m xp+) is stating there is plenty of high end content, now that to me lags logic and demonstrates hypocrisy.
---
thinking of starting a pure in f2p pvp. Shld i ? Hear some ppl say its dead
---
I know it's a joke but they did say no quest related seeds.
---
I so wish this was true üòÇüòÇüòÇ still dry after 1-35  range

Get the book from the Varrock Library and then go speak to him while equipping the robes
---
TFW you‚Äôre so buttfuck retarded that you spout lore without knowing dick about it. Rune essence and pure essence are inherently magical, all you do at an altar is ‚Äútune‚Äù it. Tiaras don‚Äôt maintain any power when imbued, they just link with the altar to provide access, like a key card.
---
That's like 8 birdhouse runs. Bone Voyage is delicious.
---
Full obsidian with zerker neck and the sword and a dragon defender.

My bludgeon gear isn't even maxed out. Just using fighter torso and obby legs.
---
lol you think people would bother with slayer if it wasn't a skill?
---
Is lava runecrafting worth it without lunar spellbook? I want to level up my runecrafting but I don't have high enough magic lvl. every guide I read use lunar spell to NPC contract and magic imbue
---
You mean production skills
---
heck that just bring in the old summoning from 2008
---
Do you think slayer would fit as a minigame?
---
on god
---
Why didnt they do maintenance during the the early hours if its that important
---
I don‚Äôt think so, I used to wear green dhide as f2p, so if you can buy the armor I‚Äôd imagine you can buy the hides.
---
You mean 2FA?
---
People need to chill
---
&gt; If they wanted to rig the polls they could easily do so with the previous system as well.
---
The people who believe that now they can rig the polls more easily are idiots. End of story. There's no "sense" to be made of it at all. They are actual idiots who apparently lack the ability to think.
---
Solid 1% or do a marginal one similar to dual arena
---
Imagine getting even just those stats without fairy rings
---
Gz. Members is close.
---
Thats the Ezscape way mayne
---
This is why I voted no to Max cape and why I think it was one of the worst updates in the game
---
Needs more serpa design
---
Shhhhh people will find out

I mean eventually, probably not for many years but eventually
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being having right leaning beliefs, but assuming they live in the US and vote for the Republican Party, they‚Äôre voting for a party which has banning/repealing gay marriage part of its official platform. I can understand being angry with someone who‚Äôs voting to take away your rights.

In other countries there‚Äôs definitely better right or center-right party options though.

Remember how when we had no power Jagex just decided to change the combat system entirely, had a beta where they ignored all feedback and released it several months before it was in a working stage and years before it was mostly working besides many problems like the tick delay and whatever other problems plague EOC. 
---
That is just one example where Jagex really fucked up. We could easily list dozens of other examples. Thus that is why people are really critical of everything Jagex does as they don't really have a track record that inspires confidence.
---
I'm just looking forward to the content that comes out with this tbh
---
Brother, if you don't enjoy mining, you aren't a person
---
I mean Idk how to incorporate all the different stats like overloads, turmoil, and the unique combat stats from chaotics. And i‚Äôd rather hear their justification for which item was better.
---
Very well said....they ti pass this onto a dev
---
The skill changes less of the meta for the game then so many other updates
---
Fuckin love that idea. If you're f2p and you complete all that content. You should definitely get a reward like that. Not only let's you try members but I best a lot of people would sub after once the bond time ends.

Awesome, would love to taste your dookey potatoes 6 months from now.

I just don't want it to be another money sink. Like, construction is cool and it has a lot of benefits, but there's no way i'm getting gp back from it. I enjoy the skills I can level up and make some coin at while doing it. I'm not always looking for the fastest way.
---
Of course of course :)
---
Some of this should just be an expansion to runecrafting
---
solid counterpoint

I loved Dung, was training my other skills just to do better in there. Got my 99 str and att in there also.

Quit bitching about end game content that you lack the patience to obtain. They key word here is "end game" or aka 96 summoning, a player investing said amount of time should be able to reap the rewards. Now begone casual.
---
I have 0 motivation to go post 99 for any non combat skills and I miss winter daddy the most. I miss when dad seeps into my veins. People who hate are wrong, keep chat on, act like my special needs cousin Jeff and enjoy the best 99 that is firemaking. Also more communal activities like this would be great üëç
---
Welcome to the community, I'm sorry you got the initiation by paddling.
---
I think the claim that warding will help the economy by sinking items to be weak at best. 
---
The only reason invention functions in rs3 is that you can disassemble every item in the game, there's over 2 dozen different types of materials and components, and you can augment all gear over level 70. It's all degradable upgrades requiring many components to level up. Invention gives value to clue items and alch value boss drops because they are very rare components. 
---
But with warding you can literally splash to collect vis, presumably up to wrath vis. Dissolvable items are limited to mostly craftable items. The only vis you can get are in the types of the runes, from air to wrath. People aren't going to be dissolving seerculls or bandos boots or anything of real rarity or value, it's just going to be cheap stuff that bots collect or pvm drops. It's basically more of a gp sink than anything.
---
except all the people that would even know where to begin with engine work are rs3 devs that have been there working on the game for 20 years
---
Well nothing comes out perfect the first time. Having to balance and update content is a required part of developing and publishing new content. There is not a world in any game where the 1st version of something is the best version where no further changes need to be made. 
---
It's absurd to think that if Warding does pass, that you should expect it to be 100% balanced and fair. There will be patches to balance it either by buffing or nerfing or removing certain aspects of the skill. Not wanting new content because it won't be 100% perfect on release isn't a great reason to reject Warding. 
---
I don't know how many other games you play but literally every single online game I've played has released new content that is either broken or weak and then gets updated to fit into whatever meta exists in the game. 
---
Of course those other games don't rely on community polls so they can be bold about the content they release. I've been in multiple gaming communities and definitely get the vibe that the OSRS community is more entitled.

How is Phantom Menace relevant to what he said?

Tbh been playing since classic, the HD era was by far my favorite. Definitely the time I felt the most amount of content and wonder was in the game. I liked the hd look compared to standard honestly, the anti-aliasing looked awesome in its own way!
---
Living up to your name, it seems. Nice story, though.
---
Don‚Äôt trust bitches, they fake.
---
Reinstall windows
---
k?
---
Can u tell me wat is enjoyable about powermining pls?
---
Boooo
---
It is the only 99 I have!
---
Maybe you should be less simple
---
Nope. The con far outweigh the pros. Sorry.
---
I enjoy it on RS3 after the rework. Struggling to get 50 on OS lol
---
Meta will just become 1-2 actual accounts + an army of afk gathering accounts. The idea is good on paper but implementing it wont work well imo
---
Yummy tears from the casuals who were to lazy to easily train summoning with slayer. Summoning added a fresh of breath air, to a rather stale dynamic of other skills. It had its op points, yes, I can agree with you there. However if they re-released it now they would balance it for sure.
---
i mean you are playing the same game right? who are you to tell someone else how to have fun
---
You play wow the exact same way....
---
Runecrafting isn't fun (for most)
---
and if it's not fun then why bother?
---
When my local 'Cano erupts I'll be there, buckets in hand
---
Idk I understand the imbuing and crafting magical robes can fit under other skills, but I think it fits more thematically in OSRS to be it's own skill much like fletching and smithing. Yeah some of the other stuff like conjuring and battle wards is bleh but the core concept definitely makes sense as it's own skill with old school imo
---
He answer tons of people on twitter, he know the game in and out (people have asked on live streams if some obscure thing is possible, and he can answer right away because he is so knowledgeable of the games code). He fixes things the other mods cant, he (somewhat) stands up for the player base against Jagex administration, as far as he can. He is dedicated to keeping OSRS feel like OSRS.
---
TIL we just want a reworked summoning back into osrs. Not it removed entirely.
---
A good portion of people that play this game, and an even higher portion of users of this sub, are autistic. Of course change is inherently bad to them.
---
I assure you, they will be the best shit potatoes you've ever seen

imagine calling urself a video game veteran
---
The antics are too much. Have some fucking self respect to not CRY over a TRAILER.
---
Something about a ton of e-mails/passwords being dumped in the chat... You'll have to wait for the youtube upload most likely
---
Even if u dont wanna do it daily at least get fairy rings
---
But do they have brainlet memes
---
Was already posted before, ash said to report an in-game bug report, and I'd assume it gets fixed with today's update
---
Your last point is flawed because runecrafting crafts the runes you use to train magic, you cant say smithing and melee skills are the same bc you Smith the weapons used for melee
---
Well if you can point to me where I said 'This is funny and isn't bad at all' I'd love to see it and fix it.  I believe I said 'It's not funny, but they say it just to offend people, and by getting offended and taking it seriously you're just doing what they want you to do'

Welcome to the Runescape official customer support. Unfortunately your post doesn't have enough upvotes to be processed. Better luck next time!

I got banned in 2006 for trying that one
---
&gt;Multiple people got perm banned,

Like 7 or something lol. And I never said it didn't happen, lots of people were upset for various reasons, a few people took it too far by any measure. But the vast majority of people were just fucking around or acting out and you really should know to take what you read in images like the one above with a grain of salt, do you take every racist thing posted in twitch chat at face value as well?

How high your stats are and combat level determines your combat bracket. You can be a voider or a medium level range tank then slowly move to a higher combat bracket the higher your combat goes. The lower combat brackets are like gmaulers, ags, and other voiders. Then you have like zerkers and baby range tanks. Then max range tanks and DHers. Lastly mains at close to max combat is what you will fight. There are plenty of guides to check out on any combat brackets and builds for accounts. But you gotta decide what type of account you would like.
---
Tool, Just like the leprechaun
---
This explains the divide of warding entirely, there‚Äôs are two completely different communities in OSRS. Those who are a willing to grind in the game and achieve their skills with time invested, those who will buy their skills off the grand exchange. The people who love to grind skills will always want a new skill to have new things to do and have something else to do in their grind rotation. People who hate grinds will want the BiS to be buyable off the GE so they can use it with no time invested and never touch the skill.
---
Farming contracts aren't dailyscape though.
---
So what you're saying is you can hold the banner in which saves an invo space and teleports you closer to bank? NGL but if you can't spare a tab for varrock or camelot teleport you're doing somehting wrong. I persoanlly would never use banner as a banking teleport in 100 years, it's irritating and frankly unnecessary considering at that level (Western Elite) you'd have access to much better things. You could get Morytania elite done and use the bank in Burgh de Rott or whatever, at least it's static.

I just used wintertodt to hit 90 firemaking. Easiest skill to level, even before wintertodt.

You have to spend money on tabs.

‚Äúits amazing‚Äù ‚Äújust look at it‚Äù - lolol
---
I haven‚Äôt really played rs recently or used runelite, but runelite having more features than the official client seems more about how Jagex makes money. Whether the player is using runelite or the official client jagex still gets money from membership. They don‚Äôt really have an big incentive to compete with runelite because they make money in the end.
---
Tips for first time zulrah? Just want it for diary so no need for multiple trips. I have 82 mage, 80 range and about 10m for gear.
---
I actually liked the first 2018 iteration of warding. The recent proposal is way too extreme IMO though. Too much going on and too many radical changes to the game.
---
I've been known to tongue punch a fartbox or two in my day.

I'm not conceding shit, but I'm not going to guess what stupid thing your brain has come up with so go ahead and explain to me very clearly.
---
Yeah where is all this GP you speak of?
---
I wouldn't have a problem with them if they used the in game auto chat feature that you can hide. I hate having to ignore 5 accounts every time i enter GE.
---
Make sure not to force him to always do the most efficient ways to do stuff and follow optimal quest guides and all that crap. Dont wanna lose the next potential 'A Friend' cause the fun was sucked out the game when they started! All the best.
---
That or you‚Äôre special ops
---
Aren't the wards just a 3x3 area? 
---
In what place will that be useful besides bursting? How would they be game breaking?
---
Now tell him to sit.

what's your point?

Actually lost my shit at hungeyy...

Stop posting these screenshots

You choose what has value equal to your time every second of your conscious and unconscious life. 
---
I think osrs has tremendous value. Although not inherently productive, it can still be beneficial.
---
Lmao..
---
God this is the biggest waste of dev time...
---
&gt;The people who love to grind skills will always want a new skill to have new things to do and have something else to do in their grind rotation.
---
That's not even true. Most of the hlc don't want warding lol.
---
You could just wear barrows gear and in a lot of situations only lose 1 max hit, which really doesnt matter. 
---
If the best in slot isnt that much better than the alternatives then you just proved my point that they're expensive just because they're expensive.
---
Apparently there is a new bis if warding comes... so on that point alone... it affects everyone.
---
Bring back the pet that eats items and is named after the item it last ate

Have you seen all the stuff crafting makes currently? A bloated skill doesnt need fleshing out
---
Borderlands and Borderlands 2. It‚Äôs probably as close as you can get to the best of both worlds. Open world, fuckton of side quests, skill trees, and farming bosses/npcs for legendaries.
---
Can you find me a source to corroborate?
---
Didn't see anything in the Dev blog about that, what is it?
---
"We pay to pk
---
no pk no pay"
---
Well I do like the idea of warding but not a fan of it into the game(dont get me wrong) it kinda feels like a new game if it was implemented. Also I hate it as they want to remove my imbues :| that's my only regret. I'm not a super rich player or anything but warding was made as a gold sink so I assume it will be like construction
---
I feel you so much. I just finished mm2 on tuesday and i got a zenyte shard on kc 49, these harambes are such good money. Gratz btw!
---
I wouldn't consider 125k per hour with molten glass super slow unless you compare it to ranged. And it's only like 30-40m.
---
Vote yes for warding!
---
What the actual f**k
---
Anyone pumped for World of Warcraft *Classic*?
---
It guarantees another herb over supercompost tho. And since a single herb often costs more than what a dose of ultracompost costs, it is always worth it to use ultracompost. Besides that it also significantly reduces the chance of your herbs dying. Start using it, you'll notice the difference immediately.
---
Well everbody these days have to train the most efficient what alot of the times is not the most fun. There are ways to train each of these skills with more fun involved..
---
They are free to do that, I'm just saying don't think yourself skillful if you can killed an ungeared guy, and don't get pissed when people call you that.
---
Legit, if this passes I will quit the game.
---
Bold statement
---
Farming is way worse than RC, the only thing that saves it is that you can pay and forget
---
thanks bro
---
I dunno, I‚Äôve seen it on reddit a few times.
---
Cool.
---
Can we keep runecrafting please?
---
This is reddit, not a calculator. Would have been quicker to just do the math than make this post lol
---
What's wrong with herblore.
---
&gt;This might lead to us getting Dungeoneering and shit, too.
---
which is a bad thing
---
It would be cool to have multiple group iron men too, like trade only group iron men, or shared bank group iron men.
---
I faintly remember them saying that imbues wouldn't be removed or they'd be revoked and you would gain the new item used to imbue the rings. I get what you mean about feeling like a new game, I'm not a big fan of adding battle wards or anything although I did see a post about how it would be cool to have a magic version of a cannon or something. I think a lot of people are basing their opinions based on the perks and rewards of the skill rather than the skill itself. I think that there needs to be a better way of obtaining magical armour other than killing stuff and there also needs to be a wider range of magical armour for different uses such as a tank version or one that makes magic actually viable for some bosses cause at the moment it's pretty useless for anything other than pvp.
---
I feel old I remember this coming out
---
okay bud, ver awsu,
---
Have you checked your chat settings on the in-game "settings" tab?
---
Loool whaaaat the fuck
---
900k-1m if you're hitting 1100-1200 per hour
---
No. It's not just as easy.
---
This is the part that you have to use logic to figure out why. Because again, I've already explained it to you
---
?
---
or a new weapon entirely that 1 hits everything and everyone you fight with it no matter what.
---
Jagex could do this, but gambling addicts won't enable it. If they do, they'll just find a way around it.
---
Might be good idea to do barrows while training mage, not the highest lvl of bossing but still fun. Once you are 80+ ideally 85+ range and mage you can start with Zulrah and later with Vorkath.
---
I watched the live stream and really liked the concept behind the skill. I'd vote yes for it if I could play test it.
---
Thats why child labour is the correct way to go.
---
Go eat a corn dog king
---
What you on about, everyone loves firemaking and fletching. Wintertodt is lit af *sobs aggressively*
---
are those... **AIRPODS?**
---
No, it really is that easy, the only difference is with live poll results runtelite could catch them a couple days earlier, rather than waiting for the full results to be out. The end result is the same, however.
---
Wow that amazing, thanks a lot for the help, have a great day
---
I think theres a weaving section in crafting lol
---
Rip
---
Imagine paying for your membership lmao

I never said I disagreed with his whole argument, just pointed it out, hence why I ignored the rest
---
Requires engine work. It's not a real lobby but an overlay screen. When you see it, your character is already logged in and you can be attacked.
---
Stop pretending like you have a girlfriend :(
---
Good start... But, there's more.
---
Voting no to PvP content because you got killed in a PvP area is the height of immaturity
---
Sorry to hear man..
---
However...
---
Hypothetically speaking I'd be pretty salty if someone hacked me, and then just to be a dick, perm disabled staking for me.
---
combat 90s take no time at all? Wtf are you on about. Melee 90s would take about as long as 92 RC would take. Add Range and Magic into that and the time investment is 100% heavier in the pvm side. high slayer is also needed for some bossing, and that makes it much worse. When was the last time people needed 100m in gear for RCing
---
Yes, like runecrafting!  
---
Wait...
---
This is a complaint on a whole new level.
---
If you have problems with the duel arena and how it affects your real life. Maybe you should seek actual help instead of making a reddit post about it.
---
The real reason I dont want a new skill, is the fact a large chunk of players is not even close to maxing/all end game content to begin with. I feel this is just focussed on some of the maxed people that are bored. For reference I am 2190 total and I dont feel like i am close to end game at all.
---
Nice
---
wow u started him on re sizable you cruel bastard
---
Same. I loved mining coal outside of Seer's. There were so many rocks and coal was worth a bunch back then. Now compared to granite it seems pointless. I don't like powermining, I prefer to bank if possible, but granite has pretty much 0 use besides exp.
---
dude, youve already made yourself look like a tit for not understanding what "hiding poll results" actually mean, you sure you want to do it again? If so please, explain why you think its different, so far all youve said is something about being able to detect an anomaly, which is not an explanation, at least not a good enough one for what youre trying to argue. Explain, specifically, why live poll results are harder to fake.
---
They look expensive. all those $11 can contribute.
---
Hunter is fun
---
If you missed that you didn't read the Dev blog clearly enough to have an informed opinion on warding. It would create new bis all over the place
---
&gt; Warding is nowhere near as impactful to the game's integrity as what's already been added to the game.
---
Although I think you're right OSRS has already changed a lot from 2011, but man, warding is game changing for almost every other piece of content. From what I can see the suggested new content, items and wards will drastically change the meta for raids, magic, bossing, and even slayer.
---
Tithe farm is decent xp/h
---
BA has a (small) community of players who love the minigame and play it regularly. It's a really fun minigame once you reach level 5 in all roles, learn some of the metas and play with other people who know what they're doing.
---
I trained here when 2007 was first released and during the first deadman season. Made lots of money off the nature rune and axe drops they gave. Also a nice quiet place to chill in while I waited for my skull to go down. Shame when they updated the fairy rings to have a timer in later season as it wasn‚Äôt as easy to escape, especially with it being a multi zone
---
Agility is the most fun skill fight me
---
If you an Iron man, it is tons of items that you will waste time getting... If you a regular player, just put Max cash stack (7.5mln) or minimum 750k and try keep it above) and for me i put workers on mahogany trees and coal... Try to keep colecting items in that case if you really need money, because recourses will add up more if you dont collect longer... Its around additional 1m for Next  bond :)
---
Because, we can see them.

I understand that $11 is no small amount if you are still in school, but even if someone cannot afford $11 per month, that does not mean that $11 is an unreasonable monthly fee. 
---
$11 is not an unreasonable charge for the amount of content and updates that Old School provides. It's perfectly acceptable to not be able to afford something that exists to provide entertainment.
---
So the requirements for that are: blonde, white
---
Wow scary
---
The wiki and all the min max guides ruined the entire game for me.
---
Back then people where trying things out for themselves or hearing different methods from talking to people while fishing lobbies. 
---
People pked in rune because they didn't look at "best stats and gear to pk with" videos. Now everyone just focuses on efficiency. No longer a game of adventure or discovering things/new methods, talking to the community. 
---
Tbh all mmos/rpgs are like this now.
---
oh i know i did. i wasnt expecting to quit and had recently put all the cash it allows not sure if that's 5 or 7.5mil but i done that and like a week later i lost interest and just stopped playing lol.
---
Not for me. Runecrafting is to mage as fletching is to range (you make the ammo). Crafting is to range as warding is to mage (you make the armour).
---
 The OSRS wiki has a good calculator for what you should plant in each patch:
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs
---
nvm its 0 so it still works
---
That thing on his cheek looks malignant
---
I‚Äôm a pure as well and I did a lot of Slayer with trident / bursting tasks. Bursting jellies is good. I also did afk fire wave in NMZ, it‚Äôs about 90k/hr. Very easy, lots of NMZ points for imbues or herb boxes. 
---
Quick way is stun alch, enchanting bolts, or bursting any large group of monsters.
---
doesnt this go against the actual point of iron man mode?

There was a recent clip of MMORPG, in which he was attacked by a clan that stood below someone using the 3a ring effect, and they became untargetable

why is your character not unlocked yet?

Yeah lots of scummy stuff was possible back in the day that's not longer possible now. What's your point?

Not sure if tricking someone into accidentally clicking a rock is even remotely the same as making it look like a price of the rarest items in the entire game is laying on the floor
---
Free 1gp for everyone who votes yes!
---
How the fuck you getting 16 herbs from a single patch
---
Yeah. I kind of liked dungeoneering. It was weird as a skill but it was enjoyable to go through floors and defeat the bosses inside. I would still like it to be a skill but yh the op rewards can skipped
---
Prefer if you posted the video to reddit instead, love the content :) spoilers ree
---
Lets be completely honest with ourselves here. People only want it added to RC so that RC becomes easier.
---
Because it was posted by moleman himself
---
&gt;Also, Runecrafting IS what Fletching is to ranged and Smithing to melee. 
---
This just proves you're a moron and shows why it shouldnt be added to runecrafting.

You don't fletch your Dhides do you? You don't mine your platebodys either do you?

Holy shit imagine actually defending the removal of wildy and free trade.

I want a new skill as much as the next guy but your comment it's just stupid.
---
Also dung is only popular because it's a skill if it was a mini game it would be dead like every other minigame on rs3.
---
You didn't ask for anything you just stated something in which I disagree'd with. If you want an item to teleport with and you're willing to skill for it i'd personally go Morytania Legs 4 as the bank is static and within a similar distance to the bank at pisc or whatevr it is.
---
They wont ruin the pk metas for a skill that not many players want.
---
I just play that way now. Fuck efficiency i do as much as i can the way i did when i was 12 and its way more fun.
---
I‚Äôm in love with **CHESTBRAH** and I want everyone to know it
---
I see you're F2P, but with those skills you could make a lot of money in P2P.  If you havent already(and have a phone/mobile device), get OSRS on that and login and use the 1 week free trial.  You could easily be cutting magic logs or probably your best option, go to the blast furnace.  At your level its probably like 500k an hour or so.
---
yeah i suppose i can just continue doing slayer in general, just trying to get like 11 mil to get my construction up and get the pool. i wont be doing air orbs as that is annoying as hell. rather AFK magics and then alch them lol. thanks for your input :)
---
Hold on Sir, this is illegal.
---
Welp thanks!
---
I loaded it to like 20% at 75 ranged and was ok. Use rcbow to tag healers but then switch back to blowpipe for jad, DPS is much much better
---
i have a hard time believing smithing rework wouldn't pass a poll.
---
its so utterly useless it would be nearly impossible to mess it up.

Do you know what nature runes and fire runes do?

You would die in 1 hit - first one to hit wins. Just like in those fps shooters but with 1hit k0
---
I mean I wouldn't be too skeptical. Don't think "just because it's the reddit for osrs". Runescape has a history of players rioting and huge amounts of people quitting over updates. Many people wanted to come to this version of the game to keep it oldschool after a the changes to rs2/3 happened. It's VERY possible we'll see a huge decline in players with warding.
---
Ranarrs are the best per patch money maker, though the risk is if the herbs die(1/8) chance or something like that iirc.  I think another thread, a guy did the calculations, and it is always most profitable to grow ranarrs with UC and MS even with the chance of them dieing and losing that 40k per seed.

---
That's purely speculation, it doesn't specifically state anywhere that any of the new items will be a new best in slot item. Also this doesn't answer the question which makes me think you don't know either and are just making up reasons to dislike warding.
---
The fact is that we will be able to vote on the items that are added, everything in the new blog are just ideas and they will be polled separately. I'm only trying to say that there is no problem with adding the skill as a concept, I don't agree with some of the new items either but that's not a reason to dislike the skill.
---
Oh okay well yeah I don't know much about iron Man stuff but I would imagine gargoyles would be fine m good
---
I have, youve not explained, not remotely adequately. Again, saying the words "statistical anomaly" out of context with no explanation does not qualify.
---
Not if it isn't the best xp rates.
---
Addict's arnt consistently compelled to do something many often times want to stop but once they get the urge they can no longer fight it.  Most likely they will enable it. Just set a 3 day unlock for it. If it doesn't take too much dev time it hurts no one and may save a few. Also jagex could use it as an example of them taking active measures to combat gambling addictions and give players and parents more active control options. This is important because Jagex just recently spoke in a hearing on that very subject and their attempts to reduce the gambling nature of games were called into question.

I have every reason to believe that osrs has a massive number of alt right players. If you're actually willing to be a bit open minded I suggest you check out the profiles of some of the people that post here. I'm not talking about /r/the_Donald either, I'm talking about weird stormfront stuff. I have a few people in mind but, honestly, it's not hard to find. I'm not saying osrs is responsible for them, just that they seem to hang out here in disproportionately large numbers. I'm not fearmongering, I'm trying to sell you on social responsibility and being aware of your surroundings. I'm not trying to censor you or stop you behaving in a certain way, I'm pointing out that a lot of the people you think are memeing with you are more serious than you realise. Take a look around, it's pretty fascinating. The biggest tell (to me) was the list of suggested subreddits on the sidebar including /r/mgtow a while ago. Check it out if you haven't, it's a bunch of totally reasonable sane people gathering around to discuss how terrible women are.

Then there is literally zero reason crafting and fetching should be separate skills.

This is not 2007scape, this is oldschool runescape. We have long since moved on from 2007 era.

If that happens they'd redesign the content and repoll. Cause it's clear people want warding, but don't want it's current state
---
Each clue step has a separate item ID; so the stacked clues were ones with the same step.
---
If you have the resources, you can hi alch noted (maple longbows for example) while you do agility.
---
I actually messed up the calculation before - I included a dragon defender on the bludgeon setup. The true DPS is 6.97, which is quite a bit lower than the Only setup.
---
How long did you use each setup? And did you reset the XP trackers properly? It's possible you have a bit of confirmation bias as well (no judgement)
---
You've got a point there, Warding was revealed in late 2018 and now were only getting around to seeing what it's actually gonna be like in game going on May 2019 with a preview. A huge new skill should have months of thought and concept put into it but we only heard about warding early this year, gave a little bit of feedback, and then never heard of it again until now. That is not how the process should be for such massive content. Zeah had similiar communication habits from the devs on release. It was Concept pitch-----(months between)-------poll------(many more months)------development starts-----(development time creating the content\[more months\])-------release. During the entirety of that there was little communication at all and everyone didn't even go to Zeah because there was nothing to do.
---
ahh, that makes sense
---
ok add warding
---
I had slayer helm at like 50ish combat, I just did 10 wildy slayer tasks and it was enough points :)
---
Your nan
---
pretty sure they said that all current imbued rings will keep imbue. they talked about it yesterday on the q&amp;a
---
Lol pretty much. I see people in wildy using KARILS over Ahrims. Makes sense since no negatives from from karil, but still, if we‚Äôre using range armour for magic there‚Äôs something off.

What would be the recommended stats for MLM? Could I do it on my mid-level Ironman, or should it wait til I could tank more?
---
Warding won't pass with combat aspects/upgrades locked into it. So it probably won't matter anyways.
---
Solo was actually great
---
They fucked up the trilogy in so many ways: by not giving it all to one director, by not stopping Rian Johnson when he decided to be a mega edgelord and throw away the entire setup of the first one in the name of "subverting expectations," by taking character development time from the new characters so they could butcher the old characters before killing them off one by one as some perverse kind of fanservice, and by giving 2 of the films to JJ Abrams who, while extremely talented in a technical filmmaking sense, always ends up making some of the most milquetoast scifi I've ever seen. The 2010s were the best decade for scifi in a long long time, potentially ever. There is a wide breadth of talent they had to choose from. The whole thing just stinks of a lack of planning and gross corporate mismanagement.

If someone sells 3 tbows and the first 2 sell for 1'073'740'323, the 3rd one can be only sold for a maximum of 3001 to not get over max cash, so if nobody has a 3001 offer your one would fullfill.
---
This once happened when some idiot dumped 8 elys in one sell screen at the ge.
---
yes, they forge metals together.
---
Yep and warding is going to change magic and pvm/pvp to make it more powerful. How is that different? It's not. Regardless of how big the difference is, it's a power change, which changes the game. It's not different whether you want to accept that or not.
---
Nothing wrong with a black mask. It's identical to a Slayer helm in like 90% of situations.

The longer.time that passes the less people are ever gonna use it because the games life time is running out. Why start new accounts In 3 years if game gonna be dead like 3 yeara after that and all your Ironman progress lost?

Genius design right here. Jamflex please hire.
---
The idea behind collateral over buying and selling is you don't lose any money and it's often less of a hassle. Spicey stews are easy to do, but somewhat time consuming to get the spices. My recommendation if you want ease is just get one more mining level, then use a matured dwarven stout to boost your smithing by 2.
---
Old skill bad new complicated skill good
---
Nah just make it 50 years into the future and spend half of the screen time of the next movies killing off the current cast.
---
You will only really know the answer if you try it
---
The only good reason to dump all this content on runecrafting is so that people don't have to do traditional runecrafting.
---
While were at it let's make fletching and woodcutting the same skill.
---
Or maybe magic, runecrafting, and warding should all become the same skill.
---
/s
---
This is how I feel, I like the idea of crafting mage armor through warding and it feels like imbues should come from warding as well. Everything else is just hot garbage.
---
Ditch her for Steve
---
Just to make this obvious, to craft infinity robes you need infinity cloth, and I am 100% certain the only way to get that is to do the mage training arena. So basically it means that they will hold all their value since there is just a 1min step added to craft them but the time spent at mage training arena is Identical.

Please stop putting these poor women in the fuck zone

Dude, I can't tell if you're some elaborate troll. You didn't correct me. You said irregardless isn't a proper word and that's just wrong, it's just not the standard (I assume you know what standard means).
---
My argument is that you're wrong saying it isn't a proper word? What? What argument? I showed you proof it indeed is a proper word. You didn't invalidate it, you just said it isn't the standard which wasn't even my argument to begin with.
---
I didn't deflect anything to any reasoning. I corrected the OP with irregardless because of the reason I mentioned, with full knowledge that *ir* prefix is redundant. Why? Because OP said irrelevant so I assumed they meant to say irregardless.
---
You chimed in with absolute no actual ground to stand on.
---
&gt;Probably less upset than he is that he doesn't have actual points and has to rely on "duhhhhhh you're a brainlet" to attack people he disagrees with.
---
Boo hoo mean online trolled called mocked MY position.
---
I also articulated it more clearly to your last comment.
---
&gt;I mean yeah the mature thing was to not even give this post any attention but when I noticed (after originally posting) the usernames were the same and that this guy has a history of autism the irony was too good to skip out on.
---
Imagine checking through others post history to find dirt on them, pathetic.
---
Also calling someone autistic gotta be the most toothless insult there is.
---
Yeah its not an ironman if you're getting people to kill the bosses for you.
---
Do i need an Arma Crossbow after 99 range?
---
I'm keeping a blowpipe for bossing and intend to melee/cannon all slayer. Is there an obvious reason i need to keep a 30m crossbow around that i'm missing?
---
All good points. Though tbh this is how I feel about slayer most of the time
---
.... Never got why people like it so much because in my 10 years of off and on WoW, I've had plenty enough "go kill x of y" and don't want to grind it to high 80s/90s just to finally start making decent gp.
---
Though I so like boss tasks and bossable tasks (demonics for black demons, vork for blue drags etc) to

I just don‚Äôt want it. It‚Äôs as simple as that. There doesn‚Äôt have to be a reason.

Mostly Iron Ore, partly MLM.
---
worked for me 2 or 3 weeks ago make sure u didnt type it wrong or anything
---
Correct me if i'm wrong but they haven't made up their mind if it's gonna be group activity or soli
---
If you think you're up to it, i think it's pretty hard to argue at this point that ironman isn't a more interesting way to play the game, it's just a bit grindier. 
---
Achievements mean something as do uniques, not everything boils down to unlocking zulrah and grinding him until your eyes bleed.
---
8/10 would recommend again
---
Father Matthew is gonna have a tough time with this one
---
Every suggestion on the blog is just to give ideas and concepts, nothing is set in stone and they are open to scrap/chamge anything on the list.
---
So giving feedback is crucial :)
---
The website is broken and displays skips incorrectly, look at the poll results in game to see the real percentages
---
there aren't enough pvpers to influence polls
---
Yep, that‚Äôs why I made this post :&gt;
---
the snarky people in the comments saying OP is complaining as well are the reason we cant have anything nice
---
I saw this. Was waiting for someone to post it. Wow Reddit talks about rs quite frequently actually.
---
One of the best ones I've seen so far lol
---
They do specifically say ‚Äúwe're introducing a brand new solo PvM post-quest challenge‚Äù, but I do hope it becomes a group activity. We need more mid-tier group bosses.
---
new&gt;front page as front page is just full of circlejerk and overused shitty memes
---
Thank you! I found activity on it yesterday afternoon from Texas. I've changed the password and added a recovery e-mail. Still no idea how they got my information!
---
I played the game for fishing
---
Right, still every skill then?
---
Because they don't want new skill
---
Can anyone give some insight into why the change to the tomb of Rashiliyia?
---
they did say they wont remove the imbues immediately but you need to get the level soon to do it
---
I've been a loyal OSRS player since this morning and honestly I wish Jagex would focus on fixing the wearing goblin armour bug before adding new skills.
---
Well my opinion is more important when you can't even spell veteran correctly.
---
Pretty much lol
---
Do fairy rings require farming?
---
At that level I'd suggest cannoning DKs while attacking them with a arma c bow/BP. It should be cheaper, less hp exp and still 150k exp/h.
---
This will depend on if they are adding limitations for the size of the group. A max \~5 player group ironman group won't really have this issue
---
Joey bada$$
---
A glitch making someone untargetable is fair game?
---
The only situations where you'd pick a CB over BP is where range is important or where you need a shield.
---
Just scrap warding and bring back dungeoneering
---
Because it's meant to be played by a single player.
---
Proofreading goes a long way, my man.
---
They're everywhere in this sub. It's really sad sometimes that the kids who play this game think that behaviour is acceptable.
---
Battlestaffs are some for the best GP in the game and are 1gp/XP. That is CHEAP for a buyable.
---
Dude the people who come to this section downvote everything and all its comments, if i ever meet one in the wilderness...
---
I did play during I been playing since 03.
---
And it's not a myth pking died from free trade.
---
Then pretty much completly from eoc.
---
Player base went from 200kish to 80k. From free trade alone.
---
good catch, my bad
---
That's a very valid point! There was a ton of information in the blog which ended up becoming overwhelming for everyone. However, they do have a while to rethink the entire skill, the rewards and the balance before they make another post. Hopefully they take more time before releasing any more information about Warding.
---
I need to see this one üòØ
---
Nice strawman my dude.
---
How bro
---
Bug abuse, people were hiding under it and couldn't be targetted.
---
Probably already works for NASA or somethin
---
Joey the goat
---
So realistically rc should be part of warding, not the other way around. But they dont want people to be able to skip a lot of warding stuff and dont want to reset rc progress so it will be hard for it to pass.
---
I did but that wasn't the purpose.
---
He's Ash, not Jed
---
Silly OP. The devs aren't allowed to add anything new unless its tacked on power creep content. Changing anything about the core of the game might as well be EOC and MTX in most people's barely functioning brains.
---
Left side of screen above combat styles you tap on that thing and it lets you change it l
---
OP's YouTube
---
Are you trolling? I‚Äôm asking **why** its a single player activity instead of a group activity
---
bro what
---
I'm genuinely amazed people still trying to argue that these weren't OP lmao... I just cant even begin to understand how this is still an argument
---
Ghrazi is slightly toned down compared to chaotic, AND you could also use dungeoneering points to repair. Even if you did pay the 200k, that was pocket change in this time of the game and the damage alone added enough profit to make up for that.
---
It's like saying the TBP is perfectly balanced because you have to buy some scales to charge it. Any other arguments as to how these are somehow balanced lol?

Producing is a synonym for manufacturing. He wasn't wrong rofl
---
Anything to keep prostate cancer at bay, right?
---
New content is vital, just not the kind of content which butchered RS3 into oblivion. Of course people are wary of new bs being added twice, and warden is a bogus skill. The basics look fine, but the more you dive into it the more you come to recognise it has no place in OSRS as a completely new skill.
---
I believe it‚Äòs changed the click to ‚Äöright click only‚Äò

(Top left) above the ‚Äöcombat style tab‚Äò
---
Yeah playing a shitty version of wow is enjoyable.
---
Farming is restricted to a timer unless doing tithe farm ( hosidious ). The best farming xp in game is trees and fruit tree runs. If you wanted to get even more xp, then also do herb runs. 
---
First do all quests that give farming xp and even quests that give lamps regardless of skill level (personally wouldn‚Äôt since I use mine on rc ). Then also look into diaries, all diaries give lamps after completing a set of easy, medium, or hard. You‚Äôll be restricted to easy (medium?) since they all have skill limits. 
---
Finally, do your farming runs. This means once a day, you need to plant 5 willows and 5 apple saplings. Apple is going to take around 16 hours to grow, but your willow can grow in 4 hours 40 min. Now you can do another tree run near the end of the day or when you have time.
---
A majority of players do. Potions are normally used for every type of combat. Saying potions are worthless is like saying prayer is worthless

It makes me sad to see the rune essence mines empty, dead content
---
if you haven't drawn the sprites for RSC with Gower's mom, you are not a veteran player
---
"From what I can see" that's the problem, as they said on the stream this is not final product, they are asking for feedback on how to improve it
---
Sounds very much like it yeah
---
Okay lol
---
To be fair it could be insanely expensive to craft as well. We dont know the contents required to craft which is the issue. Its also botted to hell, no one does that shit for money.
---
That being said I dont think they should make it craftable either.
---
Nope.
---
You‚Äôre going to have to come up with the 6m, find someone willing to trust you, or get one more mining lv and use a dwarven stout(m).
---
My 93 mage thanks you immensely for your consideration of my services.

That‚Äôs how I got my fire cape in rs2 lol

The hole game is r n g

No thanks I'd rather be able to skip raggers, griefers, unskullers and people without tiers.
---
Yeah same like how was this not polled?
---
what? I am a pure bro not a main, they got different setups for gear
---
&gt;This "preserve everything while hating everything" mentality just wasn't prevalent when I started playing.

So you've been playing since day 1?

Imagine not understanding that I'm trying to point out his hypocrisy. I can tell you what the other event was. By his definition, he should be just as outraged by it as with the pride event. 
---
I'll give you a hint, it was for animals and it explicitly promoted an NGO.
---
You can use "bh and chill" cc. Rune pouches are only 1m and ranks middleman for free
---
Ive said this too, Theres that much new content over the past 6 months it feels like a completely different game.
---
You really want potential BIS mage shit added behind a 90+ rc requirement?.. cmon bruh
---
True! Laughed my balls off.
---
Old school to me does not equal new skills. May as well call it rs3 with warding and even raids, fuck.
---
Keep going off your feelings, all I said was that runecrafting isn't perfect - it isn't.
---
Or we could just bring back the old death mechanics, and have items disappear after 3 minutes of dying. It should be fine with DC's if the timer only goes down when you are online. And it would be a huge item sink added back to the game.
---
Have you tried other lifestyles or are you comfortable with the one you have? You can‚Äôt refute ideas you have tried, that‚Äôs just being complacent and making excuses imo

Minigame shop... so players aren't forced to play a specific minigame that they probably dont like for imbues/important rewards.

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Farming

Read all of that

guaranteed minimum yield is 6 with ultracomp lol
---
also we have [an accurate calculator](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs) on the wiki now if you want to find the best herb to farm at your level (it's probably ranarr or snap)
---
rigour is worth every penny in pvp and pvm
---
? what's hard to understand tho
---
like hmm i cant use ancestral for magic, should i use the best robes i can use or should i just wear an iron platebody? so hard much complicated
---
The wildy shop isn't actually a wildy shop, its just a gp shop with emblems from the ge. Absolutely defeats the point.
---
Yeah you're both right. Raids drops need to stay bis and rare warding items need to find their place in the game
---
This only displays your ignorance on the difference between what one crafts and how one fletches. There is _some_ overlap, but they are two distinct disciplines.
---
Rune Crafting has been used in _quests_ to imbue items with magical properties. Why do you think so many people have a weird itch in the back of their head but can't put their finger on what it is. It's from that quest where you bring a wand into the Chaos Altar and imbue it with Chaos Energy. Imagine that, imbuing energies into other materials using knowledge of Runic Crafting.
---
More skill than left clicking a monster with auto retaliate on /= skillful. How dumb are you?
---
yea sorry gonna have to disagree here. Almost everyone i talk to has no interest in warding. Im usually the first to call out the vocal minority that is ever present in much of the complaining on here and twitter, but this isnt it.
---
For a CoX alt it really depends.  
---
If you're mainly a solo player and would just want it to pre-scout raids, then absolutely none. Just make a level 3 account, run it out to CoX, and you're set. You'd leave the raid on your alt once your main got in there, then scout the next raid while you're running the raid on your main so it's ready to go as soon as you're done.  
---
If you want to dolo raids (duo solo), there are a few paths you could go. The most common would be a prep alt, where you'd need 43+ prayer (Well, could get by without, but highly recommended), some decent combat stats (Would recommend melee, range and mage would be viable as well tho), 55 farming, and 78 herblore. For maximum efficiency, you'd probably want 93 mage with lunar diplomacy + dream mentor completed (venge other + humidify) but that's completely optional and really makes minimal difference.  
---
If you wanted to get fancy with it you could make a DPS alt, you'd want at least 90+ all combat stats (as well as 55 farming / 78 herblore most likely) with 77 prayer, rigour, and augury, and barrows gloves + assembler... But doloing with a dps alt is fairly difficult and I wouldn't recommend it at first (Dolo olm with both accounts in Olm room takes a lot of practice)
---
Dont do that tho
---
i mean its an 8yr old game that everyone still plays and talks about so i think it did something right
---
Alch in between each swing. It reduces how long it takes to get ore
---
I hadn‚Äôt been to an actual combat filled house party in years. I remember when all the level 50‚Äôs-100‚Äôs would box or team up in the dungeon to fuck up the one guy blowing runes on barrages

If you are paying 3m an hour for runners your probably wasting your money lol

You already can‚Äôt log in if you forget your password anyway. Thousands of other services have 2fa and still let you recover your account with no problems.

Use a password manager, and you‚Äôll never forget (or even have to remember) your password. It‚Äôs 2019 and this stuff is so convenient, and so much more secure, there‚Äôs no excuse for not using them anymore.

yes some people only do it for combat and bossing
---
Ding Ding.
---
Y'all need to study Norse Mythology more. Imbuing objects with Symbolic Energy is as old as Antiquity itself.
---
This is hard locked by a grandmaster quest it's not going to be mid tier
---
I had a very similar thought recently - but that this simply could be done as an addition to Smithing, Fletching, Crafting, etc, as opposed to making it a whole new skill on its own.
---
Thinking of this as a whole skill is definitely a different and interesting take...
---
I will put it against the random 6 criteria I made up that I think all skill proposals should be measured against:
---
1. Can be tied into lore all over the world of Runescape. Not just within quests.
---
2. Gives you benefits at multiple levels in the skill from low level to high level content.
---
3. Ties into other skills in various ways.
---
4. Feels different enough to be its own thing.
---
5. Fits the theme of existing skills as being a sort of ‚Äúnatural survival skill‚Äù or ‚Äúlow fantasy‚Äù.
---
6. Players can get excited about its addition to the game.
---
Salvaging:
---
1. Lore-wise I suppose the ability to break things down into component parts can... be considered a skill and I mean, maybe NPCs will call on you for your ability to do that? Eh, I think it's more fitting as an addition to existing skills lore-wise.
---
2. Ignoring "being able to disassemble lower level or higher level items", what kind of benefits are you really getting from being able to Salvage? For example, agility gives us shortcuts, herblore in Pre-EoC gave us Overloads, I'm talking unique unlockable account progression types of things.
---
3. Yeah this definitely ties into other skills just fine ;p
---
4. I can see it as it's own thing I suppose, but also just as easily as a part of existing skills.
---
5. Almost the same answer as point four.
---
6. Well, this idea doesn't have the kind of magnitude I would expect a *new skill* to have - though as an addition to current skills, I think it'd be fine.
---
&gt; the core concept definitely makes sense as it's own skill with old school imo
---
Elaborate, please.
---
Ooh, blue salve amulet. The fashion opportunities. And more skilling clues (by a little bit). Good update.
---
Any word on Hosidius update?
---
does that hit multiple healers at once?
---
Its been not even a month, also it was only voted on once so i dont see your point.
---
No because it prevents gp loss from buying/reselling actually
---
That quest doesn't exist, people only care about rewards
---
You've talked to 100,000 people on warding?
---
Shouldn't have to be a professional golfer to get the drop. 
---
Just my opinion.
---
Chances are you and 99% of others after beating the quest have never gone back there.
---
Im hype af too, I was at celebration for the reveal
---
rs3 bad
---
Dude if you can't be fucked getting 3 low mining levels, and stewing is to much hassle,I think you may have chosen the wrong have to invest time into lol
---
Yes it is
---
I'll get hate for this but I'd rather it be released underpowered than not at all. And then buff it little by little. I think that's better than getting OP rewards from the beginning or never getting any new skill.
---
This could sink so many items that are at alch that don't deserve to be there in terms of strength:
---
Example: Gmaul, Trident(Sometimes it goes up to 70k but goes back to 50 again, ffs its the whip for mage it should be more than  50k). 
---
I also liked how invention gave a use to all the shitty "rare" clue rewards.
---
But a invention/salvaging skill is hard af to balance.
---
Try me
---
On second thought, please don't :P
---
Is this r/woooosh ?
---
What's with this meme?
---
Actually I think Artisan, Sailing, and Warding have fit point 6 for many people (though different ratios typically around only 50%), and believe they fall short more of the other points.
---
Sailing and Artisan could be a minigame and not something seemingly required to partake in like a skill. Warding falls short on 4-5 for me.
---
That really wont stop them, theres people in 1500 total worlds that spam/advertise
---
????? What the fuck are you on about? It's nearly double xp/hr for nechs and dust devils and if you really want to be sweaty it's 100k xp/hr for bloodvelds too.
---
lol rc bad
---
6 years without it, were good.
---
This could also be done with weapons too right? Like switch to bow then ags to get them to switch prayers?

Obviously his ghost is using this reddit account, as the shame of being told to kill himself was too great to bear.

dungeneering wasn't needed, but it was also the most fun piece of content ever to exist in RS history
---
Don't sell them all at once.
---
To be honest I'm voting no because you can already craft some magic armor with the crafting skill.
---
runecrafting is already a loathed skill because of the running and abysmal exp rates would be better if you would put these changes into crafting/rc as an alternative method of training as I agree about magic armor lacking.
---
Or instead offer a new skill that is unique and fun and not a rehash of what we already have
---
So trying to improve on gameplay mechanics and make the game more fun makes the game rs3 now? Sound
---
I'm pretty sure they'll separate conjuring and battle wards from it in the poll. If that does end up being the case, I'd end up voting for Warding and voting NO on conjuring/battle wards
---
6 water melon seeds (~100gp each) + 2 ultra compost (~800gp each) = 20-40 water melons for each allotment/herb/flower area. Planting some Nasturtium or White Lilly in each flower patch (only needs to be done once) will make sure the water melons survives on their own.
---
Use 15 watermelons to make super compost, and add 25 volcanic ash (~80gp each, 2000gp total) to turn it into ultracompost before taking it out in buckets. An easy way to fill the gnome up with empty buckets is to run between him and the plant shop in [Catherby](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Catherby) with some money.
---
Congratulations, you now have a way to create more ultracompost than you need, and selling the excess will even give some profit. Watermelons are also decent XP.
---
As for herbs, you can take a look at the stats found [at the wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Herb). Using 1 ultracompost with Ranarr costs 800gp but should also give an average of around 11k extra profit.
---
I remember I threw one at Nex and it just didn‚Äôt die. Never got compensated for that or anything. Kinda pissed me off but that‚Äôs the way she goes.
---
Bonfires could *possibly* be polled with lower xp rates and no buffs like RS3 has. Just automatic firemaking, but less xp per log.
---
Oh yeas, let streamers who play the game be game developers. Being a developer takes no experience and is solely from playing the game. 
---
Also, polls are as shit to get, due to streamers or clans pushing on updates that are bad for the game or longevity, and good for their pockets momentarily. However it's the best we got now.
---
Where did OP say he was going to do a big drop party? I don't see it written anywhere. He just decided to drop some items. Why cry about free stuff when nothing was promised?
---
Yeah, so they change into pray range and you can max hit with melee
---
Warding would be awesome if it didn't bring a bunch of AOE stuff and BIS gear from a skill.  No skill gives BIS stuff.
---
? I average like 9 lol
---
For normal accounts I wouldnt care either...
---
But getting nmz points on a low lvl IRON man is actual hell...
---
SWAMP man GOOD
---
damn this is the poster child for a soy boy
---
Funny how the most dogshit arguments make their way to the top and people laugh at them.
---
Warding seems like a bad idea to me. I don't like summoning. I don't want battlewards. There are enough dead content skills in game to facilitate all of this new content ie. Mining and Runecrafting. Both of those skills unlock the fastest way to train at around level 30.
---
 If you're telling me there isn't room to add magic gear crafting that fits thematically within both of those skills, you're just circlejerking.
---
The people who like it are actually playing the game. The people who hate it are on this sub posting crab emojis.
---
It's either DEAD CONTENT or JAMFLEX DRAMA CALENDAR XDD
---
1 step vs too many steps
---
BGS. DWH is technically better when it hits... But the BGS hits much, much more consistently. In the long run, it's definitely the better option.
---
Absolutely, if you're not using your DWH anywhere else.
---
I'd say both tbh. Bring 2 blowpipes, use dragon darts for Bandos / anti-crash, and rune darts for minions. Keep in mind tho that using dragon darts is going to come at a net loss unless you get bcp/tassets, so you may just want to save the dragon darts for if someone tries to crash you.
---
I do my part daily.
---
If 75% of the community are not happy with a change, making that change is a bad thing
---
Oh god those skill icons are hideous

I saw another post like this a couple days ago, the mistake that OP made was that they were doing it on mobile and the first letter was uppercase for them, make sure every single letter is lowercase (its case sensitive, unlike our passwords)

awesome thank you so much.

If I can only afford 2 pieces of arma , which pieces should I use? also should I bring a switch for BGS spec?

Thanks

---
Not true.  Crafting does.  Just make the materials gatherable through other means, like crafting.
---
Not to mention they clearly said the rewards were subject to change and they wouldn't mind changing it up, they just want to know if we would think it would be a cool skill.
---
More interesting than dead content isn't exactly a high standard.
---
Sprinkle poop on tree semen and come back later
---
you're better off with a max value string password.

A real smithing rework would involve new types of probably upgradeable/modifiable armours and weapons, which sounds cool but would change the combat meta too much if people are to use them.
---
What's a quick point farming guide for nmz? I wanna get a couple recolours and rings imbued.
---
Actually did see someone at zulrah yesterday in void with a serp helm, I wonder if zulrah felt threatened
---
Doing a ton of quests post EOC was super depressing because when you got to the boss it was obvious some dev had prepared a cool battle with complicated mechanics then you just 2 hit everything with abilities.
---
I was in the minority that actually kind of liked EOC even on release but I‚Äôll never forgive Jagex for ruining every single quest and dungeoneering boss in one update. Leaving them broken like that was one of the most lazy and depressing things I‚Äôve seen in a game.
---
I don't think you understand how much of a fundamental change a new skill is. It's a change that's not at all warranted. All they have to show for it is it being a shitty buyable with summoning-lite features. If they're gonna add something as big as a new skill it better be worthwhile, which warding definitely isn't.
---
I say fuck the new armor and just nerf NMZ and splashing and just add the other features to the game outside of warding. Also just because people like construction, slayer and all those "new" skills doesn't mean there has to be new skills added. It's completely unimportant and I have a strong feeling you're only mentioning that because you saw someone else do it.
---
Except they said that all the UK and German world's would be down for maintenance and even listed the days it would be happening in last week's update.
---
Isnt that just the base model impreza though? More like 10str

Zulrah for a hard task is kinda strange in my opinion as well would have been a better fit for the elite diary.

you don't need to kill jad for the hard karamja diary though only a ket-zek. Jad is needed for the elite karamja diary which seems fine to me.

Ill bet 100m warding wont pass just for the fact that most streamers dont like it.... you know most osrs are sheeple following the herd...

Thank you for linking this because it just shows that these two dev blogs are clean cut, right to the point.

Warnings Dev blog just goes on all these rabbit trails that just leave you wondering why is it a skill
---
This bot is cancer as hell. You don‚Äôt even have any connection to this sub reddit. You just go around being a prick.
---
RC is the most afk skill after 77, its only like 15 hours of lava runes
---
I guess you are right, but atleast it will be less spammers if they implement this.
---
How the fuck will a f2p afford 3rd age if they can‚Äôt even afford a bond? Would be cool though
---
Well done, you're the cause of the "every account deleted" bug.
---
I'd like to have a new skill, I was never around to experience the new launches. Just not this skill.
---
I'd love to see some sort of gathering skill or another way of crafting magical equipment.
---
It would slightly reduce the number of spammers, I'll give you that
---
Kids spent too long rs forgot it‚Äôs about fun not a chore
---
Agree with your view on conjuring and using wards and whatnot.  But I do think the crafting magic equipment was pretty cool.  The dragonkin the zulrah one would be nice as degradeable ad-ons to existing gear instead of their own independent gear, for example.  The buffs to the useless equipment would also be pretty cool, a lot of it might as well be removed from the game for how it is right now, completely useless at every stage of the game.
---
Yep, nailed it. If battle warding manages to pass somehow I'm quitting on the spot
---
Nah it's not the same. Collateral 100% removes the possibility of losing money when reselling. You don't really know what you're talking about.
---
You're missing the point. If you're going to do something, don't disappoint the people that attended. Otherwise, don't do it. That simple. When you announce a dp, that's telling people free stuff.
---
If you like attending bait dps, go crazy.
---
Also, I didn't attend so "cry" in this context is rather misplaced.
---
Runescape is the only major services I know of that lets you enable 2fa but then doesn't protect the disable option with said 2fa. The solution to this is actually really easy just look at services like Gmail, Outlook, Steam, Dropbox and Facebook which all handle this problem the same way:
---
When you activate the authenticator you are given a set of recovery codes you can use to disable the authenticator when you don't have access to it anymore. It is your own responsibility to store those codes somewhere you can find them again and make sure no one else gets a hold of them just like it is with your password. If you lost the codes or just flat out refused to save them somewhere you need to go through customer support.
---
You don't have to accept everything. They got feedback that warding wasn't exciting or new, so they proposed a bunch of stuff to be polled individually. They never expected everything to be added, they're just juggling ideas to gauge the reaction and work on the skill core.
---
We'll get a poll with each of those features, not a single question "should we add warding?"
---
I disagree with the statement that Jagex needs to take account for opinions of non-voters. How do you accurately gauge an opinion of a community that can't even be bothered to vote?
---
By choosing not to vote, their choosing to have no say in updates, and that's fine.
---
Now the birb has two goddam, good for you bro I‚Äôm in the UI cc but haven‚Äôt been on in a while
---
Wait one involves firemaking, one of the most useless skills and the other involves a horrible skill, and could be put into firemaking / runecrafting.
---
Do the math op. Shit post.
---
Tbh when ya can stack it with other stuff like if it‚Äôs possible to use with a salve (ei) yeah use it, if ur like 90 range yeah use it, if you have rigour yeah use it.  OSRS has many DPS calculators that can give you a lot more insight than I can.
---
Group ironman is supposed to be like ironman. No trading with other players and all the other requirements. It will not be set on tutorial Island. The group will all have their own bank but will have a shared bank area that all the players of a group can access so that they can share items. All the players in a group share stats so if everyone were to train a different skill you could level several different ones at once on all the accounts. 
---
This is what I have heard at least. Nothing concrete has been announced and they recently said they are not actively working on it right now
---
The piety police are just going to camp somewhere else as broken.
---
Gonna be a whack-a-mole for a while.
---
New zulrah and olm robes will devalue the hell out of ancestral though. And there's already so few places that magic is even good
---
I understand where you are coming from. The armor is there but it isnt/cant be utilized properly for a couple reasons. Most of the armors are a reward from treasure trails, and that's not good for the skill itself. Theres no real counterparts to things like dhide.
---
If, maybe, 3 sets of armors were added from crafting with cloths, and enchanting with either magic or runecrafting, in the ranges of 40 - 70 that could compete with d hides, it would make more sense. I wouldn't even mind is mystic required a higher magic level and got a slight buff. 
---
Seems weird that its sold in a guild requiring 60+ magic, but the armor itself only requires 20.
---
I dont see the need for a new skill, though. It could be added to crafting and magic/runecrafting with no problems. We dont need new disenchants and their would be multiple ways to implement it.
---
Sure, crafting is "bloated" but would adding 3 or 4 new crafting recipes really change much?
---
The way I see it, RS3 has been on the slow and steady decline for years while OSRS has yet to reach its peak. But that's my biased opinion as someone who quit RS2 back in the day and was suckered back in by OSRS.
---
Show evidence that everyone complained of not you‚Äôre just talking out of where you shit
---
There's a discord server dedicated to VM and in the teams formed there, everyone always does what they have to from my experience.
---
Also, not quite sure what you mean with your last line, people are still doing it.
---
I've just started doing Zulrah, getting around 1m/hr in profits with 81 range and 77 mage, using full ahrims, swamp trident &amp; occult and a blowpipe god dhide switch &amp; glory.
---
I have 71 agility so I tp to clan wars to bank then tp to wizard tower to fairy ring, then jump using summer pie.
---
I get 12 kills/hr through this method. Any way to improve? What should I spend on next to increase efficiency?
---
P.s. 256 kills in and no uniques, is that normal? :P
---
Ok?   I had no plans of joining a clan as a recruit.
---
RuneLite is awesome
---
Got em!

Nice.

A D pick does not swing 600k in one night.  It has swung that much in almost an entire month.   "Hypothetically" it can, but if you use common sense and a little thinking you know it *wont* swing that much in 1 day.
---
Yes, I lead raids and try to teach ironmen to the best of my knowledge, still refining the methods though.
---
I don‚Äôt think you really understood the point I‚Äôm making at all then. I am explains how people are upset we‚Äôre adding 1 skill in 6 years while from2004-6 they added 5 skills, all of which people love today. I was not saying we should go back to 2004 scape...
---
Same, I‚Äôve been plinking away in motherlode to get my mining to 99, and then I‚Äôll take all that stuff I mined and get as much smithing xp as I can making bolts, and then I‚Äôll do slay+ranged, and at some point do some quests lol
---
No way, who would dev for that low...
---
Are we all dead? 0 hp.
---
I'd appreciate it if you left my sister out of this.
---
No problem. Good luck!
---
Easily the best meme I have ever seen
---
i nmzed att and str n chinned barraged everything ese
---
Why not just call it summoning?
---
This could be made into a good idea. Instead of firemaking it could be placed like an actual incense burner in your inv just like in the POH. (Probably add a certain FM requirement for each herb). Though would you want to sacrifice certain inventory slots each time? You would need a tinderbox, incense item and herbs. How long will herbs last? If they only last 5 mins then you need to bring a decent amount of herbs with you in a run or the herb sack will be the first item you buy with points IF this really "changes the meta".   
---
Another point instead of adding this option, why not reintroduce summoning. The familiars could be changed/added to actually give these same effects. Familiars could also be given "aura" effects to make PvM more social. They only used 1 inventory slot and they lasted a fairly long time.   
---
Is this concept kind of a summoning 2.0?
---
Dam. Maybe an upcoming XX hours of Konar slayer or something like that. Or maybe look from 100 Brimstone Keys. idk if he‚Äôs already done that or not.
---

Ill donate a percentage to planned Parenthood or the ACLU and pocket the rest so I can sleep at night
---
You should maybe go ahead and do that anyways.
---
I think it's more of a gold sink in that disentigrating items is an alch alternative. Not sure that it will be a buyable in quite the same way
---
Domt worry, if they have the skill ready, and i think they do, the polls will say the community agrees with the update, they wouldnt throw a lot of work just beacuse some people dont like it, plus i dont know why everyone is whining the item destroing will be a very good thing the game needs
---
You new to the internet or something?

Blocks &gt; Superior slayer &gt; Slayer ring unlock &gt; Herb sack &gt; Slayer helm

Are you dumb or am i wooshing
---
In general, ranged, void has a higher max hit but lower accuracy than dhides.  So when you're a lower ranged level, hides are better.  The other note is, the higher your opponents defense is, the less effective void is.  So specifically rune dragons have high defense, you want dhides.  Also diamond bolts (and Ruby bolts switches) are extremely strong.
---
It‚Äôs nice to see a fellow scaper helping out his sister üëç wholesome

String the bow !

Thank you

Smoke a bowl will bring back that child like wonder
---
Dude seriously. Just make dungeoneering a minigame and im solid
---
Yeah but the reason the game mode was even created, rolled back from 2007 was because people want 2007 scape. So you‚Äôre saying you only like 2026 onwards version of the rolled back game? Do you like the GE or not? You‚Äôre not really making sense lol
---
Quests?
---
This is the superior channel
---
Lmfaooo
---
Yesterday in the Q&amp;A they said people would keep any imbues they currently had, and furthermore the imbued rings would be tradable.
---
Zerk ring is 3.6m now? Wtf.
---
Can you quote me some people who are outright opposed to any change? I don't think that's really as common as you're making it out to be.
---
I think that's a strawman. The vast majority of people, including the "no to warding" crowd, like new content getting released, but simply don't think warding is needed for one reason or another.
---
No one wants summoning with extra steps, no one wants their imbues to be gone and having to grind this weird garbage just to get them back, and I'm pretty damn sure no one wants the ancestral that they grinded for to become completely useless with new mage dmg robes against dragons (olm) and poisonous monsters (zulrah)
---
only they are called skills. and to imbue other things than runes is a different skill. idk seems similar but different enough to warrant another skill
---
buy about 1000 ultra compost. Plant oak trees at 15 after fairy tail 1. Then willows and fruit trees to 70. do this like once every 3 days. Then begin hardwood trees once every 3 days.
---
I fucked up early on and completed monkey madness so unfortunately thats not an option
---
Fletching makes shields... and the rest is all weapons. Crafting makes the armor
---
doesn't seem that way to me. feel better soon.
---
Spooky lmao
---
Hmmm. Actually, wow.
---
Use a hammer on the egg you get from completing the Easter event.
---
Pre-eoc runescape (the period between dungeoneering and eoc) was when RS was the best. 
---
Eoc is when things started turning really bad
---
Warding is going to be a dope change for this game. I'm all for anything this game has in potential and a future. I'm from 2005, I don't see why that matters though. Who cares if you were 5 when you started playing, some of us were older than you then and still are ;)
---
Damn, that was my favorite quest line, some amazing quests in that series
---
How long was it like that? 2006-ish or 2010-ish?
---
I agree, I really didn't like the idea of sailing but I still would rather have that over this.
---
Yes
---
I'll look up rock lobbies! I heard nmz bursting isn't worth it unless you have multiple people in the dream. Is that true? And yeah i definitely think I'll be doing jellies a bit
---
It's obviously because of yellow text black background /s
---
whats so hard about finding sea shanty 2
---
Liver failure is imminent
---
its a reference from the michael jackson meme video, thought people were more cultured
---
No worries man. I'm still a noob but I try to help others too lol
---
&gt;i don't really want someone who is likely to quit the game within the year to be taken seriously on a game i have played and will continue to play for years.
---
unless warding is added.
---
Yea, no
---
ty
---
Stun alching is so fucking click intensive im really trying to stay away from that. I will fire wave though! Again, forgot about that!
---
Ok sure, but if they're adding a new skill it should be something that's interesting and useful long-term, not just something that you grind to 99 then never use again.
---
They have not released an ETA on group iron man's released btw, it's a proposed feature that quite a few people want
---
# Nice.
---
Only yes votes and no votes are tallied.
---
Your only hope is that 26% of the active voting playerbase votes no.
---
Hopefully reddit isn't too representative of the community, because "yes to warding" is absolutely the popular, flavor of the month opinion to have, and the "correct" opinion to have on this sub.
---
&gt;idk man if i didnt play osrs then id just find some other kind of entertainment to relax to or fill my time with.   
---
Just do what you love most.
---
Yeah idk, I agree with you on this.  People have the mentality that bots are good, but I remember when picking flax was legit way to make money instead of just a meme it is today.  Now you can just say cannonballs, but I'm sure there are dozens of players who still do cballs for "money"
---
Yeh, somehow rock lobsters are forgotten but i think its nearly same xp as monkey, problem is they dont respawn exactly the same.
---
And yes bursting in nmz is only good with multiple accs
---
Nope
---
Yea, that was incredibly ambiguous. Sarcasm in text-form either needs context, or needs to be explicit
---
Oh okay. I figured you had 40.
---
arma with justic helm, higher range, better ammo, better prayer/pot control. It shouldnt be hard if doing correctly so maybe watch some videos or obtain some of the above to handicap it a bit
---
Unless the seed dabber can also be used to smoke ranarr concentrates, I don't wanna hear about it.
---
This is a real problem in games today, with loot box, mtx, crates etc.. No policies in place to protect gambling addicts atm so focus on yourself bro, they wont change shit. Maybe in 10 years
---
How do you not have slayer helm if you've done at least 69 slayer for mm2?
---
So this would be a great idea back in 2014 before Zulrah, Slayer Buff, Zeah, and all the other bosses that drop a crazy amount of supplies. Skilling in general is dead content. Back before all these buffs it was worth cutting yew logs, mining coal, and fishing shark. Now the Mets is just get your combat high enough and you will get more GP per hour and the items needed. 
---
Anything that tries to buff resource collection will always be overshadowed by PvM drops.
---
I used to do play testing, and still do research into videogames. 
---
Once you learn the general rules of how game engines work, you know that there's certain stuff that every developer has to find a solution for. When you identify what their solution is for that, you can work out a way to break it. 
---
If you play a specific game like OSRS for yesrs a time, then you get to know both how the engine works and how the developers think. Then you can go ahead and guess what they haven't thought of and see if it works. 
---
Grab a friend, try to break it, see what happens. If you find something major, some developers will pay you bank to tell them about it and help them replicate it so that they can fix it.
---
Just buy broad bolts from the ge, not worth wasting slayer points on them
---
I hated farming on release it was a mess
---
Your combat level in wildy depends on whether you have a familiar summoned or not. Having 96 summoning and using a yak means you'd be able to fight people 11 combat levels above you in level 1 wildy. it was balanced
---
Thanks my dude.
---
I have enough gp for like 4 bonds. Did low cmb risk fighting for past week.
---
Pretty sure he's a pure...
---
like 2 - 3m xp.
---
Idea was "good" because idiots didn't actually think it through.
---
It's either incredibly tedious to use because it's the meta/efficient or it's dead content.
---
There's no in between with something like this.
---
When instead of throwing them back in the water you drop em on the ground like 2 feet away
---
I agree, I feel like the idea to even add a skill would barely pass a poll (not sure if this has been polled, I may be completely wrong.) But regardless no 3/4 player base will agree on a specific skill.
---
Go on.
---
It's not necessarily bad in itself, and I'd say it has its place in rs3, but I personally believe it really changes how the combat and the game works. It feels like EoC before EoC itself to me. Too game changing, especially when it's the OSRS trademark simplicity of combat we're talking about. I won't lose sleep whether warding itself will pass or not, but I really don't want that battle ward and pseudo summoning in the game.
---
i had a problem like this last year. i used the java files and runescape files from a separate user on my computer and replaced all my files and it worked again.
---
need to save that pray coin
---
I would train your combat stats up some more before grinding Slayer.  Low level Slayer monsters are really obnoxious and levels are slow.  Go do something like afk at sand crabs or nmz until you unlock nieve.
---
im not sure if i had the same error message but it sounds very familiar
---
The thing about doing something ironically is that you're still doing it. Also, just the fact that you can't tell if they're ironic or not should be more than enough reason to not condone it.
---
You can drop trade just go to an isolated location of your choosing
---
i remember people thinking slayer was stupid when it first came out and people thinking farming was too complicated when that first came out
---
hunter i dont remember though and everyone loved construction because we'd been wanting pohs for ages
---
What is the point of a new skill if it doesn't add anything useful to the game. From what I'm gathering all salvaging will do is be an item sink that you need to toss things into for xp, and get almost nothing in return. 
---
Invention is an item sink like that, but in return for dissassembling items you get to customize all your armour, weapons and tools. If warding just became a magic based version of invention I'd vote for it in a heartbeat.
---
It's only worth a few hundred k I think. 
---
I would just keep it as a fashionscape item for your iron man. :)
---
A brave but simple statement.
---
Somehow we'll find a way to complain in this thread though.
---
&gt;Ok obviously august 2007 would be too much, but I think you're missing the point of letting more experienced/comitted players making better decisions. Polling game development questions is not something newer players should be able to do imo, as it leads to less consensus about big questions like this new skill update.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Having an account that's 2 years old should be more fair and let new voters come in which seems fair?  
---
  
---
&gt;And to  address your last point I think you mistook my view on not wanting change, I've played OSRS since day 1 and I can tell you with 100% certainty it needs change to grow, it just seems like people are too divided on these bigger updates and when you need 75% to pass a vote we need a group of people voting that's more united.
---
Yeah dude it's getting really frustrating lately. Updates for the sake of updates is a really bad model - especially for this specific game. What's more is that they're poorly executed the majority of the time. 
---
Voting becomes irrelevant with the type of people that are being advertised to. Hopefully it all goes tits up (again) and we're (me) finally freed from this digital prison.
---
That's the point though. There doesn't need to be some piece of active content every 10 steps. It makes the world feel smaller. 
---
A very important part of an open world MMO is a feeling of scale. It should feel like a journey to travel from one city to another.
---
It's not just traveling 10 steps at a time from "A" city, to B activity, to C, to D, to E, to F, to G, to the next city. That doesn't have the same sense of scale when you can turn around and look behind you and always be within sight of multiple different active pieces of content that are acting as breadcrumbs. It comes from a feeling of sometimes getting lost in the middle of nowhere because you don't know the way.
---
You need 55 slayer to use the broad bolts, they aren‚Äôt talking about making them.
---
Prove me wrong. Take any existing skill and write a blog post that is as long and confusing as Warding. You can‚Äôt do it. They‚Äôre trying to do too much with it and it simply does not fit.
---
I'm still strongly against Farming. Just putting it out there.
---
You get farming exp from the quest though
---
nice name
---
You get farming exp from fairytale I
---
Well if that‚Äôs the case, ge has it listed at 5.8 mil.
---
Lol cute
---
It's worth 5.8mil atm, according to the wiki.
---
I read this as ‚Äú... makes Old School Cool‚Äù which is also true.
---
FUCK NIGHTMARE ZONE.

most cancerous bullshit to ever enter the game

*existencial crisis*
---
Really? My bad if so.
---
I just do 4 palms. But i do know papaya would be cheaper - I dont mind doing the palms for now given the exp. Umm..how do i do calquats? Also I only know of 4 fruit spots atm lol is there more? 
---
Fuck i need to look at another guide. I probably am missing out a ton of exp lol.
---
Why in pvp world?
---
Slight correction, he can get fire staves from fire giants. The reason he needs to kill hard clue wizards is specifically for an air staff.
---
Hey another free daily that‚Äôs cheap af is the Calquat tree patch
---
This is lovely
---
Are you saying that you prefer the walk from Varrock to Canifis over the one from Varrock to Falador? Just for the sake of clarity.
---
I don't like it but fuck making it easier. There needs to be a skill that is really hard to get through, there should be different "tiers" of skill difficulty/effort because it adds more variety between them. 
---
If runecrafting was just like every other skill what would we meme about?
---
People accept the risk of engaging in pvp when they enter a pvp area. Sometimes you strike it big with an inventory of glories, or a verac's chainmace, or even just anything put into a looting bag.
---
Good for you for being what you consider honorable in a no rules pvp zone.
---
I see that it's not worded well, but what I mean is that existing skills can overlap to provide what they are suggesting through warding. One could argue that magically infused farming via arceeus or ancient spellbooks would suffice for the creation of imbued plant/silk fiber for use in creating magical armor. Why is a new skill with independent progression necessary for what could otherwise be a welcome expansion of what we already have?   
---
Unless we are going to have a skill that brings something novel to the game - which many players seem to not want for some reason - then I don't know why it couldn't be added to the current system with minor tweaking. Devs get to have their project accepted and the community drops the "muh nostalgia" argument, as new materials, equipment, money-makers, etc. are often readily accepted despite reaching far past what "feels OldSchool."  
---
And on a separate note, I loved seeing new skills when I played growing up as they were always new, but they weren't without controversy even then for the changes they wrought in the game. Hunter and Dungeoneering blew my mind on release, but I think you would be hard pressed to find support for the latter now that raids exist as late game content and not a skill.
---
The emotion really shows
---
You need to start Fairytale II to gain fairy ring access which requires Fairytale I, and that awards farming experience along with I think requiring a minimum farming level to even start.
---
Rigour obv worth, but aside from that bandos/armadyl should be your last purchases. Torso is fine and obby/torags/prossy legs are fine until tassets but boots/rings/amulets/dwh all should come before the bandos/arma purchases for future notice
---
They're like 2.5m atm.
---
Example of a dead "nothing" area in any modern (last decade) MMO?
---
I've already spent thousands irl with these, please don't bring this to the game
---
It's almost as if this subreddit has a... **gasp** hivemind
---
Why would u farm 20 minutes every hour? Trees take 8/16 hours to grow
---
ELI5 Battle Wards?
---
Dagannoth kings?
---
You're right though I guess, cause it'll like drop and be worthless like the rest of cosmetics usually, but still. If he's worried about money and he barely has any he should probably just drop trade it and sell it quickly before it drops.
---
want to start doing nmz to train melee: 
---
I can't afford the beserker necklace alongside the full obsidian gear, should I still use obsidian with the obby sword for the 10% boost or go with a dscim set-up (I dont have the fighter torso) ?
---
I DO want a new skill, but I want it to be something interactive and engaging. Warding just sounds like a snooze fest to train AND the rewards could be better suited to existing parts of the game.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest, when I was 10-12, I didn‚Äôt read the updates thoroughly, I just looked for pictures and cool words. OSRS gives me the chance to kind of play RuneScape like I wish I had when I was younger
---
Runecrafting isn't even bad. Mining is so much worse IMO. But runecrafting is fine as a skill.
---
I have never once heard any meantion from them that it would be set in tutorial island. That literally makes no sense. You cant even use half the skills. No one would play it. People would be pissed.  Nor have I heard they would have their own stats.
---
As you can tell op does not know how the mechanics in this game works lol.
---
&gt; W493 has been made a themed world for Pyramid Plunder. 
---
Really understated great update
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/uEImGdl](https://imgur.com/a/uEImGdl)
---
This is not true at all.
---
A lot of changes are hated, disliked or votes down out of wonderment (not knowing its affect) and by definition the actual affect of that change is unknown (since it never got implemented).
---
For example, back in ACTUAL runescape a lot of the items, minigames and skills hailed as the best and most fun parts of OSRS were resented by the community at first but later loved.
---
Slayer is a perfect one.  There was huge backlash when slayer was being introduced into the game as a "useless skill" or "we already have X combat skills that are leveled up by killing things, we dont need another" etc.
---
Now it is one of the most fun and rewarding skills to train and is seen as an accomplishment for it's difficulty of getting 99.
---
If stuff was polled back then there is no way slayer would have passed.  Imagine how many other staples of OSRS are just like this and realize the game would be a lot less fun and engaging today had these things not been added.
---
Polling is a good thing, but in its current state its hindering game progress more than anything (lack of new skills, declining pvp, abandoned areas of the game, etc).  Remember, as the OP stated, new skills were a part of runescape back then.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking.
---
Ge prices for new clue items are very misleading.
---
I think the bigger issue is that were getting under 60k players to vote on each poll.  And I do agree the requirement for some polls should be higher.  At the same time if they are suggesting low tier f2p robes then it should be low lvs who get to vote on that content.  High levels have no use for said content.  I would like it more inline to what they suggested to pvp polls by allowing the polls to be voted on by their respected community.
---
The two aren't even remotely related, and if you've been following anything at all you'd know they are in fact working on pvp
---
That link lists the release as October 2012, EoC was a month and a half later, rs3 was summer 2013
---
O.mo.k
---
that's like 5x the amount of people that voted in the last couple polls tho, so it's a good sign
---
dumb fuck
---
The graphics/art style do it for me. So charmingly shitty. 
---
Other than eoc being implemented I really disliked the graphics attempting to look better but ultimately they started looking worse. Trying to be something it's not.
---
I'm absolutely stunned that I haven't been downvoted to shit and called a commie cuck for stating that the KKK is bad. I want to think it's because people are learning and improving but realistically it all depends on the day and I think today the jackasses are sleeping.
---
Less than 5gp/xp for 250k an hour. That's 20 hours of vorki hunting. 
---
It's super cheap. Herb is about 5 for ppots which is slow and average is 12. 
---
Farming can be over 13. 
---
Prayer is baseline 12. 
---
Yeah it's not fire making cheap but it's not expensive either.
---
This is awesome. I'm glad you guys look so happy! ..... esp. after paying that 11 dollars a month ;p
---
Thanks!
---
Two questions about the chairs. Why the fuck do they exist? Also where do I get one?
---
Squeel of Fortune.
---
It‚Äôs extremely hypocritical to pass tons of pvm polls with flying colors and then decide that here is where you want to draw the line. 
---
You‚Äôre perfectly okay with the game being changed just in the way you want it to be.
---
Battle wards that will probably change the meta for pretty much everything too?
---
He doesn‚Äôt even know
---
the thing with agility is that it never feels like a grind to me. the time between clicks combined with the runelite agility plugin lets me train from my peripheral while watching youtube
---
By lazy you mean fix that doesn't require a lot of effort
---
This is so cute what a lucky dude
---
Or the skill is a complete clusterfuck and not needed
---
100%. Ngl I thought mod west had nailed it with the core idea  + skillers would really get behind it.
---
Then you need to read more of this sub. People have been saying endlessly that imbues could be in the magic skill (ex. Enchanting jewelry) and that mage armors could be craftable with crafting (ex. Xerician).
---
Lol jagex don‚Äôt care about that. That‚Äôs why accounts get hacked
---
A lot of people aren't against "a skill", they just think warding is pointless and shit
---
Wait, so you didn‚Äôt try to attack the smoke devils at all? You just planned to let your cannon draw them in the whole task without clicking?
---
It blows my mind how many people in this sub can't wrap their heads around the concept of a large group of people having a diverse array of opinions. 
---
This sub has 350k users, no shit you're going to see contradictory posts.
---
It's probably because glitch isn't so easy to fix
---
Isnt autochat disabled by default? You can turn it off. Doesnt help though, they use autotypers or macros for that kind of shit
---
Are there less bots on members worlds? I've just started again after 7 years and all the F2P areas are crawling with bots.
---
I think most people are saying warding fits into runecrafting more than magic and crafting, and RC is definitely not a bloated skill
---
I'm saying the walk from Varrock to Canifis is more engaging in a sense of realism of exploring a real world. 
---
That said, it's just a straight, well define road, that takes only a couple minutes to travel. This is not a strong point of Runescape to begin with. But it's certainly gotten worse since those first early day of classic.
---
Some of my best memories of Runescape were there very first days of playing when I'd get lost and have to explore. This was before you'd have a world map. This was even before the newcomers map was added to the game.
---
-------------------------
---
If you've ever played WoW you'd get a better sense of what I mean. To run from one city to another might take an hour, traversing through multiple zones, hundreds of enemies, small encampments of random people, lakes, forests, deserts, mountains, etc. Just to get from one major city to another. It feels like a journey, and it's an accomplishment to traverse that for the first time. It feels like exploration.
---
I disagree, I feel it could spice up the game in a very interesting way.
---
I disliked the constitution changes and how damage changed. To me that was the point in which it started to feel like a different game.
---
*no one cares if new content devalues your gear*
---
It seems like that is more of an issue with Skills than other content, which is a bit strange. Like I don't think nearly as many players voted no to Song of the Elves because they wanted DT2 and Menaphos instead; they likely supported Song of the Elves knowing that the update they wanted more would likely be offered in the future.
---
But when it comes to Skills, it seems there is a bit more of the mindset that there can only be one new skill and anyone that isn't the one you want can't exist. But the opposite is kinda true; if new skills are supported that would likely lead to more new skills being offered while if new skills keep failing, that will lead to less being offered.
---
That is not to say you should vote for a skill you dislike for the chance of another skill you do like being offered later, but you should vote based on the merit of the skill being offered alone and not based on whether it is a good as X idea. For example, if you think Warding is a good skill it shouldn't matter if you think Sailing is a better skill since Sailing isn't what is being voted on.
---
I too love assuming the worst about stuff that hasn't been implemented or tested yet
---
Hey ;)

Nope, its not disabled and we cant disable it, Thats the problem.

Ahwww

That's because we didn't know any better.
---
Don't ask me, I didn't vote in that poll lol NMZ perception was probably different though considering it is instanced. I don't think it's a fair comparison.
---
Every skill is equally plain how can cut that tree fish that fish be any better then kill that monster ?
---
I really wish they would just release a new server, as it was in 2007, and never update it.
---
Agility or firemaking
---
Every day we move further from God.

Well that blows

Ahh pepe, your insight is always refreshing.

Can I draw my on characters face on his face pls?

100% agree. This would be a welcome addition

You havent read much, thats one of the first thing peoples said.. its all over the threads.

This 100%

They usually find the root and fix it unless it's too much effort
---
Do u not have better things to do neighbourhood watch irl üòÇ
---
These posts are such incredible strawmen. Can we stop upvoting them?
---
The gross majority of people aren‚Äôt hating on warding because it‚Äôs a new skill. They‚Äôre hating on it because they‚Äôre displeased with the content of the blog. To say they‚Äôre hating on it just because it‚Äôs new is incredibly disingenuous...it assumes people can‚Äôt have substantive discussions about whether or not it should be a skill.
---
I don't know how much you have to think about something before it's well thought out for you. Warding was proposed almost 6 months ago and they are definitely still thinking and tweaking with it a bunch. Most of the stuff in the blog where ideas from feed back from the community, you are stupid if you think change is bad.
---
Looks great! 
---
Keep drawing :)
---
The skill and the rewards are stupid bis mags gear for everything. 
---
It's a wannabe hybrid skill between crafting, magic, rune crafting, invention and summoning. 
---
It doesn't fill a void. Who cares if I can't craft mystic. I can't smith bandos either and I'm not complaining. 
---
I'd rather have summoning or invention than be forced to train another useless skill.
---
Suggestion	S
---
That'a a really good idea
---
Okay so I'm probably looking at priority rigour &gt; anguish &gt; torture &gt; prims &gt; dwh &gt; then armor... I had them all b4.. maybe when I get tired of vork I'll sell my dhcb again and buy all the other crap back.. or maybe dhcb is just 2 gud and I shouldnt sell? The struggle is real.
---
Is your boyfriend Mr.Mammal
---
Why do people dislike it so much, from what I understand it's just a dwarf multicannon but for magic (in some cases).
---
Yeah, and that‚Äôs not even an opinion, it‚Äôs a fact. If you compare  at the activities players want to do, community opinion about them, rewards from them, and the lack of real updates to certain skills,  you notice really quickly just how trash skilling has become.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way, but it is. People use some circular logic to justify it too. ‚ÄúSkilling sucks because it never gets updates, but let‚Äôs not update it because no one enjoys it.‚Äù 
---
????
---
No one gives a shit about the health of the game. They‚Äôre just spazzing out because it‚Äôs a meme to not let new skills be introduced. 
---
These same people will try to rearionalize how the BP isn‚Äôt stupid OP, and how nightmarezone and splashing is somehow good for the game.
---
Some of your comparisons are **really** bad. Like warding to quests guides lol. But I do agree with your overall statement.
---
Based on your flag I take it you are/have an ironman. What you're saying, is that as an ironman, you think the usefulness of this skill is dependent on it being tradable once it's imbued? Furthermore, ironmen can't trade items anyway, so fishing, cooking, smithing, etc actually do directly help them with combat.
---
Here I was trying to throw something new into the game that would be more than just merch fodder. But sure, make it tradable. Now is it fine?
---
I got this idea while thinking if I should start a service where I'd be your pet for gp
---
Imagine all the bots rolling through as a group of 60 crabs
---
Still don't understand this meme
---
It‚Äôs like this in most bezeless displays.  It helps you from accidentally hitting them.  You‚Äôll get used to it
---
No chatbox seems suss
---
It's either going to be dead, or meta. And some people don't like either option.
---
5-15 prayer points PER BONE?? Dude what? Catacombs gives one prayer point per bone and is borderline overpowered.
---
I'm voting no
---
That's what I'm saying, there's not one skill in the game already that 3/4 people like.
---
That's cause like 90% of the existing skills would be dead content on arrival because of how simple and boring they are. Newer skills like farming easily have as many components
---
This is wrong. You only see autochat if you enable it. Those accounts aren't using it.
---
There's no use. Jagex support is tbh pretty lacking, and I doubt they care about this. A simple autoclicker won't get anyone perma banned. If their system detects it, he'll get a minor botting ban if it's a first offense. Sending a video most likely won't result in anything.
---
People bot and autoclick on mains daily for months and don't get banned. I've seen some bots that I've reported months ago still at it in certain places.
---
3 spoopy 5 me
---
Yeah i totally agree. I dont think any of this has a place in pvp unless its something like duel arena or clan wars, something closed off where you can add it to the ruleset or something.
---
Why? It's essentially weapon poison except you can apply it to other weapons.
---
&lt;3 I hope today is amazing for you man. Please be good to yourself and all of your endeavors, you made me cryyyyyy. Add me in game man, any time, I mean it, any time.
---
In february(?) they managed to make a twisted bow that spawns on the ground every minute, requiring a rollback.
---
The latest DMM tournament had half the finalists killed by mistake with no way to recover their accounts.
---
Those are 2 of my favorites
---
You look at them, blind boi
---
I'd imagine that being a good thing, since then actual pkers could farm the farmers.
---
Also what [eXCazh](https://www.reddit.com/user/eXCazh) said
---
no, I'm 16, even if I started to work I would get half of the minimum wage and I'd have to wait 1 month to get paid, it's just easier to farm gold
---
When you report a player it creates a time stamp that they‚Äôre able to look at for suspicious activity on an account. Report and forget about it.
---
An item sink is so needed
---
i mean, i personally think the blog is prtty specific about the process: u have wardstones, which are the things u draw wards with; elemental means air, fire, water, earth, caltavic means mind, chaos, death, blood, wrath. U need something like an anvil for smithing, but instead u draw a ward, or rune, or glyph, what ever u want to call, on the floor, to summon powers, where ull use resources (fabric) to create the armour, and the channelling lamps are like a hammer, on an anvil, like, idk how u can be this confused about it, its all almost just renamed existing items, and u dont need to familair with the name to understand it. i get that ur probably not the most high level runescaper, but especially the start of the blog is very clear and well worded.
---
Imo calling dungeoneering a skill is a farce, its a glorified minigame which is one of the worst things to be added to rs. I don't see artisan fitting in with osrs and sailing would probably be another gold sink with barely any room for functionality.
---
Gimme summoning over any of those any day, its the one skill I miss from back in the day. If we cant have summoning I'd rather have warding, we can't deny theres a huge hole when it comes to magic gear and it looks well thought out more than dungeoneering and artisan ever were.
---
I have never been hacked don‚Äôt use 2fa either played for years don‚Äôt download anything dodgy don‚Äôt click dodgy links and use separate email I honestly don‚Äôt see how people even get hacked
---
VoteNay to warding and all aspects of it
---
There's been a start, recently a dozen of community figures went to jagex to discuss changes to dmm and pvp generally. But i don't think it will ever flourish, it takes monstrous effort to research;  set up, and train an account even capable of pking. Not to mention how absurdly specific accounts have to be pk in different brackets. And after all that, the meta is heavily reliant on manipulating game mechanics in your favor, like sliding, understanding pid, stepping under, stacking damage, cancelling / delaying animations, 1 way safespots,  which is hard to learn for an experienced player, so i can't even imagine for new players. And then you have to consider fighting opponents that not only master all of the above, but tick eat every action to stay at full Hp constantly making them quite litterally unkillable (see amenity)
---
Its just a joke, mate
---
Now that you mention it, you‚Äôre right that veteran status itself doesn‚Äôt equate to knowledge of the game. 
---
Experience and knowledge does not equate to understanding it, but they are definitely requirements. How could you understand the game‚Äôs identity without either?
---
The truth that people don't want to hear is that Runescape is boring. All of it is boring.
---
No matter what you're doing you're grinding, or doing the same repetitive thing for 10 hours straight daily.
---
People just wanna argue like the damn spiderman pointing fingers meme about what is more boring.
---
We love the game, and we just love being bored. Nothing is more boring then the other thing IMO.
---
slayer is rewarding though, you usually make decent money off it. It's also not repetitive for the most part as it sends you around the map every task. 
---
there are skills that are boring, repetitive, *and* unrewarding... see woodcutting, fishing, even mining. none of these are efficient when it comes to making money. They're all slow and repetitive
---
True doe
---
But why do we need those materials to train other skills? I personally have zero interest in a skill that's main reward is extra materials to train other skills with.
---
Jesus Murphy, did I say the game was good just because it was pretty, or do you get off on calling people graphics whores?
---
Skyrim is a great game for many reasons, from the mechanics and silly glitches to the literal world building and the level of detail put into it. Even outside of the game, it's fun to mod and tinker with. 
---
With over 300 hours in the game, even when I play it 8 years later, I'm impressed how they managed to arrange things in such a beautiful way despite their lackluster texture pack. The composition and cinematic appearance, from the first scene to the last is so appealing you dont even notice the texture. It's a testemant to Bethesdas visual story telling prowess. 
---
If you need a clearer comparison, compare the textures of Mass Effect 1 and 2,  which came out in 07 and 10 to those in skyrim to see what I mean. Both ME games dont have the same stunning cinematics even when they use cutscenes, despite them both being incredible games with better texture packs.
---
Sorry, guess I'm just flustered my comment tanked due to reading comprehension issues.
---
Can you stop being a master epic trole and just answer the question?
---
Maybe the text over every item on the ground? Lol
---
Okay thanks!
---
Nah this would be (and has been) used to grief regular people just trying to play the game
---
No, but he really has a big 4Head too!
---
Eat up
---
Just did, firemaking isn't mentioned in this post.
---
What even is this
---
Step 1. Find a handful of people being negative toward a potential update.
---
Step 2. Extrapolate the opinions of that handful to everyone.
---
Step 3. Find a handful of people being negative toward a similar thing.
---
Step 4. Complain that the opinion monolith isn't consistent.
---
I think that's a really bad comparison. Runescape in 2007 is not the same thing as Old School RS today.
---
Back in actual 2007, what we got *was* Runescape, no matter what new skills they were adding. The game was also still growing. Arguably, the only updates that came to that game which weren't Runescape anymore were EoC and all the MTX stuff.
---
Nowadays, OSRS exists in part for keeping the pre-eoc gameplay available, but also to keep the original game available and playable. They've already messed with the original game's gameplay too much, we shouldn't be voting everything in just because "omg new contentz!1!" That's how we end up in the same situation again, with the game and gameplay changing so much that the original game isn't really available to play anymore.
---
It's completely fine to add new updates that fit the feel of the game and don't alter the gameplay too much for what already existed, for the sake of game preservation.
---
You don‚Äôt need any farming for fairy rings.

if you dont have a BGS use darklight specs on him. IIRC they dnt have to hit and are a 10% defense reduction

People hate mining too and mlm is terrible. It's just polar because it's kinda afk.

Blood runes are polar for the same reason but 77 rc is a lot more daunting.

This is not the place to accuse players of wrongdoing. Report abuse in game and contact Jagex for serious issues. Feel like sharing? Please censor names wherever possible.
---
the comment you replied to first is stating that polls in general that fail with 75% no votes are clearly items that are not wanted by the community and therefore making the change anyway would be a bad thing.  Your response is to say that even votes that fail with 75% no votes (of people who bothered to vote) only had 15-35% of the overall community actually bothering to vote no.  You implied this invalidates the result and it absolutely does not, bringing me back to my original comment.
---
Lmao kid you forgot to black out your FPS. Enjoy the last few minutes of your account.

Sure, regen makes sense. Fury just does not seem useful.

---
While never using or partaking in it I have no issues with this. I can't see it being that hard to implement either. I'll come to your next one, but I can't pick anything up üòã
---
I don't see what the incentive to salvaging is. Most alchables (d-hide, forged armors, etc) are sitting at a value which is slightly less than their inputs (the leather, or bars that went into it). So I'm breaking down an addy plate..which is worth less than 5 addy bars, and I'm getting..2-3 addy ingots..which is worth less than 2-3 addy bars. 
---
&gt;There could even be rare, unique materials you have only a small chance of salvaging out of a kind of gear. Like with barrows gear, gwd gear, raid rewards, boss drops etc. These could be used to create augmentations for existing gear (yay more item sinks) and create new bis gear, if that's something people actually would want.
---
This is the only thing that would incentivize breaking down gear, but is also one of the biggest problems people have with the Warding (new BIS gear). 
---
This skill sounds boring to train, and provides little tangible benefits.
---
oh ok so it‚Äôs really not the bad haven‚Äôt done that many hard clues so i wasn‚Äôt sure

Good except it requires massive dev time to work on it

If they are putting the time into dev a new skill, they can put the time to potentially not RuneScape AFTER THEY ALREADY RUINED THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE IN THE PAST.

Why risk OSRS?

Do they not want our 11$?
---
i didnt say that, friccking commie  -konar , circa ,idk , like yesterday

At least one person understands.

It's 5k base, nearly 2.5k at 99 farming
---
Neither is lava rc or paying runners???
---
What do you mean they wont fuck up again. Just look at the drama calendar
---
What does "hlc" mean?
---
Farming *is* pretty complicated to learn. I had to have step by step tutorials on how to do tree runs and herb runs, and it wasn't until after I was doing them that I understood how farming worked.
---
The npcs in falador have announced that ever since the party room was moved to falador. And the only time shady rwt has taken place at the party room was pre-eoc when free trade was removed.
---
You just did tho
---
So he could have closed his window much earlier and autologged at that moment?
---
Yeah, spot on.
---
I feel like in players head they make skills to be a bigger thing that they actually are. Many people might end up being against Summoning but overall it would be good for the game. The pet archetype is very poular one in MMO's. Just look at WoW - the most popular class is Hunter.
---
When did I say it does mate
---
Holy shit your a fucking moron people don‚Äôt agree with you and you don‚Äôt get your way so your crying . Ahaha I like how anyone that doesn‚Äôt want the skill is wrong holy shit
---
How abouy you realize you don't know what you are talking about and stop trying to change the game without knowing how it works.
---
Can confirm this episode haunted me for at least a week as a child
---
That‚Äôs why the people who work at Jagex usually truly love the game and the company. It‚Äôs a labor of love for them.
---
i DONT CARE that the top numbers are cut off
---
The average 2007scape redditor is mid 70 combat stats with 100 quest points and hasn't trained a single combat exp off slayer task.
---
You have to vote for every question in order to cast your vote I think, so if 10 people voted for question 1, they also voted for question 2
---
Thank you for linking this. What an excellent post.
---
It's called being hacked not a bug... PS double XP doesn't exist and don't click weird links
---
Can you list the items you had, and lost. This would help a lot
---
You must have been on a pvp world
---
Yes, or at the least leave them out of PvP.

I'm fairly sure you drew yourself with a bit of bias. You most likely don't look that good.

That or you're a guy and this is just a karma bait.

Dungeoneering?
---
You can do elimination votes. Start with 4 or 5 options, and eliminate the least popular until you have 2 choices. "The higher voted skill will be implemented. The other one will be up for consideration next time the community votes to add a skill"

its when you roll backwards, but still in your regular stance. see r/skateboarding

i hear ya, ill never get pmod because of previous offences but it is what it is. i dont know how often they appoint pmods anymore, but i feel like in true 07scape they were bountiful and id see one at least once every day or two. ive seen maybe 2 or 3 pmods in the 5 years ive been playing again
---
God forbid you have to actually play the game, it honestly doesn't sound like you enjoy it?
---
good point tbh

---
&gt;If your biggest complaint is that Warding could be a part of existing skills then you clearly recognize that it fits into OSRS.
---
This is such a strawman. I can think of lots of ideas that thematically make sense in other skills but don't fit into OSRS.
---
Crafting is pretty middle of the road at 5 gp/xp and you get fuckin 300k exp/hour lol.

Lvl 1 farming IRL I guess.

But that would mean polling isn't all black and white?!?

Can‚Äôt compare deaths under something to deaths as a direct result of something else though

Oh, well must be some work but if it passed it could take st least 1 more week

&gt; Bird houses now have a left click/tap 'build' option which will erect the best bird house in your inventory providing you have the required Hunter level.  
---
*yes*
---
&gt; Mosol Rei now has a left click/tap 'follow' option to quickly gain entry to Shilo village, skipping the area with the Undead Ones. This will be the default after completing the Shilo Village quest.

Slayer is PvM with some thinly veiled genocide mixed in
---
Same. The beta was actually kinda cool but it was just me and my brother spamming random power ups.
---
When it got in real game, the game no longer felt like osrs. Sucks cause all I had worked for was gone. Meh osrs is better anyways. I'm older and playing the game tight
---
I was not on a pvp world i was in world 448 its my default world.
---
They‚Äôre just going to repoll Warding until it passes tbh
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
yeah i honestly believe that as long as it doesn't interfere with the core gameplay of OSRS and doesn't introduce mtx, i'm fine with any sort of update. if you can't keep a game fresh, it will naturally start to decline. so what if some things lose value? i'll take new content to sink my time into over equipment dropping in price any day. yeah it does feel a little bad that something i spent so much time on has become easier to obtain, but i can move on

That‚Äôs basically the American prison system
---
Agree to disagree bud.  Zmi is slower less interactive agility.
---
Yes, because the uncut version is relatively useless compared to the cut version, where you can make jewelry. Well that‚Äôs excluding xp, but who cuts dragonstones for xp.
---
The game needs change to keep growing. People the don't want updates for the sake of keeping the game the same are delusional. A game without additional content being developed will die off. This is what I see happening to WoW classic when it hits. People are so adamant about #nochange but after the nostalgia wave hits it starts to run dry the same way it did when osrs came out. Massive influx of players at release, no content updates, player base starts shrinking. With new and exciting games constantly coming out how can a game from last decade compete for a users time when nothing new or exciting is happening in that old game? You end up with a small crowd of the most die hard fans but no newbies. A recipe for disaster.
---
Only 2 stickies allowed per sub.
---
Bad
---
Oh look another idiot posting half assed copy pasted title trying to get to the frontpage.
---
So since you asked so nicely i'll downvote you.
---
&gt;But if you don't care for a new skill, every time you open your skill tab you'll see that 1/1 skill. Even if a player isn't going for max, and never plans on having particularly high skills, leaving a skill at 1 just feels bad. It certainly feels worse than not completing a new quest or not fighting a new boss.
---
That's more about perceptin, illusion and allusion.
---
Just because you have a new skill, doesn't mean you have to train it. On my main, pre-eoc, I never trained Slayer unless I needed it for some quest. For me, Slayer functioned pretty much as any other piece of content like the quests that you mentioned.
---
So if that's how players feel, that has more to do with how they view the skill(s) rather than objective perceived reality, that most logical people work on like me.
---
Why not at least buy obby legs if you can't afford tassets?
---
&gt;makes me not trust them with this
---
ok but the community votes for the suggestions anyway
---
This devalues my F2P only complaining no new changes pk'ing ironman.
---
LOL, yes. Long day.  Just edited.
---
'tis
---
Haha haha u so funniiii
---
The people not voting are opting out of the decision making process.
---
I'd much rather have updates be based on an informed minority who want their opinions heard, rather than a mix of every person's opinion who has ever played runescape once.
---
&gt;How would you propose going about getting new players into voting?
---
The incentive is making your voice heard. I vote because I like having a say in what updates do and don't make it into the game. If someone is choosing not to vote, then having a say is not a priority for them.
---
&gt;The voting system worked when the game was new because a majority of the playerbase would vote, now the voting playerbase is no longer the majority because of how the game is growing.
---
This doesn't mean the voting system doesn't work, though.
---
There doesn't need to be a solution because this is a non-issue. The people who want to have a say have a say, and the people who don't give a shit don't give a shit. There's even a notification in chat to let them know.
---
How do you intend to gauge what the community wants if they can't even be bothered to vote?

we are still here world 301 if you want to mess with them
---
i also don't like battle wards but im perfectly capable of voting no to that on the poll but voting yes for the skill itself and most of the other proposals
---
Just accept that this community is strange... Crying about "keeping the game original" even though it's nowhere near OG RS2... (And that's a damn good thing... When it released, RS2 was ... Kinda shit)
---
Your appeal to the majority has no data to support it.
---
It will be pretty much completely useless though, what else is it gonna be used for lmao bursting? Ancestral is pretty much for zulrah/olm, with these new robes you'll do like 2x more damage than ancestral. 
---
and yeah, imbues aren't that hard to get, but still, this skill looks weird as fuck and i don't want to do it until 69 just to get my imbued b ring and ring of suffering back. 
---
also idk what you're talking about, i have 83 agility and 94 slayer lmao.
---
Out of curisosity, what was the percentage of votes to pass that poll?
---
So, they think they are saving the game, but then they also ask themselves if they "are the baddies"...?
---
2018 reddit: Warding looks unrewarding, needs a reason to level it, all this is dead content on arrival
---
2019 reddit: WTF is this BULLSHIT you get from warding??? EVERYONE will have to level this skill now!!!
---
I personally think polling is stupid, and just let the devs do whatever they want. 
---
But since that would make people die inside, instead Jagex needs to repoll what % is needed for a polls to pass. It was polled at the start of OSRS and most people wanted 75%.
---
Simply repoll it. There's thousands of more players now. Why should only the tiny of amount of people voted at the start still affect us in 2019?
---
Damn can't wait for the Jmod Smackdown on this thread

I own a pair of obby legs but I prefer the way vskirt looks. I have like 110m or so but I'd rather have other items than tassys

I'd forgive them for anything if they did that, fuck, they can even shut down osrs and launch more rs3 servers, as long as they rave.

Working as intended.

Making your own private server is a google search away :), literally 1 hr to set up :):).  Bye :).
---
Use the [page on the real wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide) for up to date information! :)
---
You took 8 comments, and a different idea.  Well done.
---
I will not vote yes on Warding unless I see that battle wards have been removed.
---
If they are polled at the same time, I cannot vote for Warding to pass if the chance of battle wards is still there.
---
I think that voting should be mandatory before being able to log into your account. Once the poll goes up it is placed on the landing page that logging in brings you to, the page that tells you how much membership is left and your inbox messages. From here you would have to vote or skip voting to be able to enter the game.
---
I agree, I don't think this would do anything for RWT, as people can just free trade as it is.
---
Imo it‚Äôs just not possible unless it‚Äôs forced. Even if they said you get 1m every time you vote, there‚Äôs going to be someone that isn‚Äôt going to bother. The responsibility lies on us, independently.
---
I dislike your personality.

Yeah its "massive" so go do something else

Yea there's probably at least 400m of items that are worth prioritizing over tassets if your goal is efficiency
---
Really like the idea of an instanced party room
---
Well of course most polls aren‚Äôt an entirely new skill, but most polls aren‚Äôt qol they are new content.  Just because the most recent poll was qol doesn‚Äôt mean that most are
---
How do you get their run energy tho?
---
It brought a good amount of new stuff, but it was pretty lackluster compared to other skills. Like crafting Runes with RC was huge for the time and it has always been one of the best skilling money makers. Slayer was an interesting way to train and it brought the Whip, a new BiS. Farming was kinda like RC, but for Herbs and more passive. Construction gave you a hub to customize with portals, glory, and altars.
---
Meanwhile, Hunter brought Chins, weight reducing capes, gloves of silence, and a wieldable harpoon... Chins were a pretty big deal, but I wouldn't say they were enough to carry the skill. There is also Imp Boxes, Hunter's Crossbow, Spiked Vambs, Butterfly buffs, and Salamanders but those don't see much use. Oh also, like a third of its initial creatures made Camo outfits that never actually worked...
---
Overall it isn't a bad skill; it is just that its release content was a bit weaker than other new skills. On release, it wasn't recieved poorly because we didn't know better and a lot of the stuff sounded neat. But looking back most of it doesn't hold up very well and not just because new updates have made some of it dated. I'd say it wasn't until the Impetuous Impulses minigame that Hunter became a really good skill since that added more worthwhile content than just catching Chins and more application for the skill.
---
Lmfao summoning was so fucking OP are u joking?? U could bank shit globally just for starters.

There it is

Not really a boss, but a good way to learn some core mechanics is Demonic Gorillas, plus getting a zenyte drop is some tidy cash.

I didnt even do that i just played.. imagine the shock to the system when EOC came around. One day and the game was completely different

RunEscape
---
Its almost as if everyone on this sub is absolutely retarded and are not the people you want deciding what goes into the game.
---
*woah...*
---
so here's my thing. I buy black dhide bodies (but you can sub with lots of different items that have been mentioned here). limit is like 70 so just start with that. go do agility and high alch until they are gone, reinvest all that money including profits into a larger number of black dhide bodies or whatever you are alching. over time you will slowly increase the number of items you are buying and therefore end up training more, and getting more profit. I went from \~500k worth of bodies to over 1m in just a few  agility sessions. It's not the most efficient process, but it gets me to train agility for as long as i can stand and i make profit/magic xp at the same time.

Fuck I knew I needed more detailsüòÇ

I'm surprised to see incense burning ever got upvoted. But I'm even more surprised that you've used Reddit for this long and still aren't using night theme

idk how they can pass any of those higher level battlerobes without either crashing ancestral to alch price or heavily buffing it
---
&gt;different idea

how is it different?

Text Incase you‚Äôre wondering

&gt;I'm fairly sure you drew yourself with a bit of bias. You most likely don't look that good.

&gt;That or you're a guy and this is just a karma bait.
---
I would recommend planting celastrus and palm. Don't forget to ultracompost celastrus.
---
Seems like you're doing mostly mediums anyway, so there's no harm in asking for hard contracts and downgrading to medium if necessary. There are 18 possible options for hard contracts and boosting to 85 would allow you to plant all of them except 1 (redwood at 90). Garden pies are basically free, too.
---
For mains, I would recommend pre-planting celastrus, palm, maple, lantadyme, poison ivy, white lily, snape grass, watermelon, and potato cactus.
---
You want the world to burn, don‚Äôt you?
---
I mean if u want situational BIS mage gear locked behind 90 RC be my guest..
---
Agreed, I would love it as a skill over a mini game.
---
Good, I'm really hoping people vote yes to some of the content. I would like to see magic gear crafting and dissolving in the game, but not if they are going to force a new skill by giving it arbitrary other uses.
---
You don't need bots to add 1 more function to your pvm alt (which are already very common for some bosses)
---
SEND IT TO THE POLLS
---
Well, it does only gain the damage bonus against certain creatures. And we haven't seen the costs that go into it. It is possible that stuff like the Zul-Hide would end up costing the same as Ancestral plus 100K per hour in repair fees or something like that. Also, I do think there was some talk of making it a set effect, which would lose the Slayer Helm, but not sure if the OSRS Team was for that.
---
I do think it can work for an Artisan skill to make gear stronger than Ancestral, Bandos, or Armadyl provided they are more limited in scope, have the right material cost, and have a repair element. Like if some new Melee Armor provided +7 Helm, +6 Body, and +4 Legs (+6 over current BiS) but only against Dragons that was made with a new material that rarely dropped from Metal Dragons (say it goes for 8M each and you needed 6 for a set) and degraded like Barrows with a fee of 100K per set per hour of combat that wouldn't be too unreasonable. It would be cheaper than BiS Melee with more Strength, but it would only work on a certain type of creature and the degrading cost is not trivial.
---
You make fun of people using twitch emotes and then proceed to comment using twitch emotes/pepe memes. Odd.
---
If you post against the circlejerk only the few people actually browsing new might see it, and likely your _actually_ unpopular opinion will not get traction because people browsing new are going to downvote it.
---
Try posting some constructive criticism of runelite and I guarantee you wont reach 50% upvoted just because the runelite circlejerk is going strong. The default way of browsing reddit doesnt encourage conversation
---
I noticed but never thought how it effected "the game" on a game wide scale.. i never even heard of balance or economy or any of that. Just played the game
---
You can solo dungeneering, no one forces you to team.
---
Suggestions should not be posted to Reddit. The RS forums exist for a reason.
---
I enjoy crashers but I am not far enough along to do bosses that would make a difference. Sand crabs ( or pest control ) is me playing while watching a show or movie. I'll stop training range/magic or w/e and go back to a whip to prove a point. I am not active but I will make a point of being active for an hour or as long as it takes to take as much xp as I can away from them. I used to swap when people showed up with AGS or something big that I'll probably never get, but after getting a whip and hitting 20's I don't really take heed from higher players anymore.
---
&gt;downvote me to hell

I got you, fam
---
Blowpipe is awesome for range exp and alot of slayer tasks
---
&gt; allusion
---
You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.
---
blowpipe is really good for lots of moneymaking bosses whereas melee is not very effective.
---
&gt;  payments needed for the people to watch over them, which btw i suggest doing because most arent expensive
---
for the palms specifically it's not worth payment, it's like 10k while the tree is 35k~, ultra compost is 1/10 chance of a tree dying so you'd only lose on average 3500 gp per tree (plus like 350~ from ultra compost with bottomless bucket) 
---
Idk if you were doing payments for palms, just thought i'd mention that incase you were.
---
lol my friend almost had enough points saved for a slayer helm and he was ona long carride so was checking out what other items the slayer store holds, and he accidentally bought max amount of broad bolts.  RIP his slayer helm for quite awhile
---
for vorkath farming would you suggest buying rigour or saving for dhcb first if i am currently using blowpipe
---
My point was about voting for ideal content over the content you'd like; someone else mentioned the Quest vs Skill point and I briefly commented on it in my reply. But like I said in my reply, it has nothing to do with my original point.
---
Upvoted. I want Warding so much! It looks well thought out and would be well integrated into the game. I cannot understand why some people hate the idea so much? Nobody forces you to train it if you dont like it.
---
I like the mix of this and the actual content. I can work on stuff semi-passively while doing other stuff, but then theres some pretty damn fun 'full' attention content as well.
---
In context, that referred to using the products of Runecraft at a corresponding Magic level - in the Smithing section it specifically mentions how T40 Melee equipment is made at 99 Smithing, and the Fletching section mentions the Magic Short Bow (T50 Ranged equipment) being made at 80 Fletching.  
---
I agree that Runecraft has deeper issues - the issues you mentioned with Chaos Runes are barely even the start of them.
---
He's much more famous for being an intolerable douche
---
Because that quest tunnel is an alternative chinning/bursting area for when you have already completed MM and cant go back to ape atoll
---
Well I hate to break it to you and anyone else that thinks for me, but I‚Äôve always been a pker, since before barrows even existed. Everything in this game for me atleast is a buffer point for the endgame which is pking. I get that a lot of you enjoy the challenge of bossing but pking captures a lot more of the game for me. So to put it short all the people that just vote no to spite pking proves not everyone is on the same page. Now while you look forward to having new skills instead of reworking the other boring HALF of the game then I‚Äôm sorry my dude but you and those devs can go to rs3. I didn‚Äôt pay for all this membership for shit that just doesn‚Äôt fit this aesthetic. I don‚Äôt mind change at all but a new skill isn‚Äôt even close to what this game needs

Man I felt bad for him having to repeatedly say on the most recent q and a time and time again that he was just brainstorming on the blog post. 
---
People really liked his ideas too, they just couldn‚Äôt get over that it was more of a brainstorming of lots of ideas rather than a finished cohesive plan for warding lol. 
---
People were slating him even though they liked most of his ideas, but they just wanted them in different parts of the game lol smh.

This devalues rogue kit.

was gonna flame you until I read the post and actually agree with everything

Implying kids haven't been smoking / drinking since ever
---
I refuse to level both Hunter and Farming because they weren't in the game when I played in 2004.  they aren't oldschool enough skills for me
---
Personally i don't think all magic armour should be craftable. Mystic and infinity robes function as a gold/item by virtue of being sold from shops. They should not be craftable.
---
But if there was magic crafting, imo warding process doesn't look right. The silk could be harvested from magical silkworms or something. Or even use normal silk or flax (flax sink ftw) that you imbue via a NPC
---
similar to how hides are tanned. Then use crafting to make the armour.

---
Lol I've been getting down voted for saying the battle wards were the most interesting suggestion in the skill to me. I still probably wouldn't vote for the skill. It seems too unfocused and tedius.
---
You're right about that but at the same time, we now have the benefit of hindsight of what made the bad updates bad, and there were also plenty of updates from the same era that were actually fantastic, including a lot of things that have been implemented in oldschool. Rs3 for all the terrible mtx and fucked up economy has a lot of really cool content that I wish we could have in old school (dungeoneering is my personal no1).
---
unit
---
I think its mostly cuz people don't want to feel obligated to use them when soloing, which mean having to carry a bunch of extra stuff in your inventory. Maybe they would be fun when you're doing raids, if you could have 1-2 ppl focused on warding, but overall it doesnt feel like OS, people want that point and click fighting style that the game has developed around, adding battle wards feels like an ability you're activating.

I do payments for the palms yeah. Its 15 papaya fruit per tree - theyve gone down in price so its only like 8k each. Tbh its just easier for me doing it that way so i dont ever lose exp. The gold loss isnt that big a deal to me saving 20k or whatever a day, but id rather not lose out on a trees worth of exp ya know.
---
He died?
---
I mean the community suggests a lot of dumb ideas so I don't mind when the OSRS Team floats ideas that they know may get unfavorable reactions. They were pretty upfront that they knew this would be a radical change but if they never ask those kinds of things, they won't really know if it is something we'd like.

Big if true

Jagex has the worst customer support i have ever seen and when people get hacked they dont take any action now im going to grind shitty money makers after work just so i can be where i was thanks jagex for your bad customer support.
---
People don't like improvements to content that they had to work hard to achieve. Everyone hates Runecrafting but changes to the XP rates will never be made because not every skill needs to be easy to level. 
---
I don't care either way. The irony is that PvMers complain about PvPers not wanting changes to existing mechanics because muh high skill ceiling, but this subreddit collectively flipped its shit with 2 days of incessant whining when the Warding blog came out.
---
People like /u/likesleague are allowed to vote on content polls when they can't even read the context of the thread they post in. How could they possibly understand the content of a poll?
---
You need to constantly click your health down lol, so no it isn't.
---
Yeah, they looked a bit better than the old graphics we have now, but honestly though the RuneScape engine as it is now was not made for fancy graphics.
---
As someone who played RS3 for 3 years and switched to OSRS after maxing on there, I can say OSRS feels so solid, smooth and insanely responsive compared to that mess.
---
On RS3, everything is clunky as all hell and you're constantly fighting the game to do whatever it is you are trying to do. I prefer OSRS' no nonsense approach; 18 year old graphics but everything works like it should.
---
They have tested nothing, there is nothing to test. They did some brainstorming and then made a design blog.
---
I liked 2010 graphics (if that was before the reworks to tune armor and stuff) RSHD looked fine, RS3 art since then has just gotten disgusting in many places though.
---
I've yet to see a single max player say this. Please link an example so that the rest of the community (pro and anti warding) can make fun of them. 
---
Otherwise, stop pushing this argument
---
This. It's more like
---
&lt;-- xp this way, money that way --&gt;
---
Lavas, other combination runes, nats&amp;deaths&amp;laws, double cosmics
---
At least until you unlock blood runes. They're decent xp, pretty afk, and 500k or so an hour, so you'll never touch anything else ever until you unlock double nats or soul runes.
---
Oh, and ZMI is a thing too.
---
Dissolving is the whole benefit of the skill: an item sink. And talismans are worthless right now, why not give the excess amount of talismans a useful sink?
---
Wolf Combat sounds like a better skill.
---
&gt; days worth of work
---
would've been months if you wanted conclusive data ;)
---
Read it more closely, brainlet.
---
Yeah, I vaguely remember that; I'm just daydreaming.
---
Agreed
---
Legit didn‚Äôt know the place existed until yesterday . Friend suggested I farm nats here on the iron
---
Make it so that you can craft magic armours with firemaking
---
&gt; would we rather have new bis content and rewards that are really good and entice you to do the skill, or would we rather have weak rewards?
---
I think the issue there is that the answer is likely both and neither. So players would want the OP rewards while others would want lackluster rewards and I don't think there will be a clear winner. Also, I don't think you'll find the silent minority commenting much on Reddit because... Well, they probably aren't commenting on Reddit if they are silent.
---
I heard the Scorpions are playing there as well.
---
I don't care what anyone says, i'm excited about the new skill.
---
Too bad nobody pays to suck me off
---
That qp offends me.
---
As someone who does literally only bossing after I levelled my account to a high point I can attest that there are many people who do literally only bossing.
---
O shit. That "kommentƒÅri" is latvian. Haven't seen one of us in a while.
---
Oh wow, thanks for the info.  I had ran through the tunnel and only saw a possibility of grouping up like 3 at a time so that's why I though it was a useless spot but then saw the guide on clicking the coins to spawn more.  I'm willing to bet the jmods don't even know this was a thing.  I think an easy fix is to make the entranceway single combat, then let the rest of the tunnels be multi.  Solves both problems
---
Sounds like iron until i cant do the content man to me.
---
totally agree. that and the summoning shit.
---
Yeah, I actually got lucky and got one drop from a greater abyssal demon lol
---
Personally I really like the breaking down aspect of warding to get materials to make content
---
Is this on steam workshop? Workshop is one of the best things to ever grace gaming, I remember playing through Portal 2: Mel, which was a community submission, voice acting, difficult puzzles, story line. Studio level work. Its amazing they give those tools to the players.
---
unless you have 9+ mill to spend on an abyssal dagger, training strength with full obsidian or sara sword is probably the best setup you can use until roughly 90 hp woth dharoks, as far as I know.
---
I can agree that the major cities in RuneScape are far closer than in other MMOs. They function as hubs in other MMOs in a way that we don't really have in OSRS (apart from maybe the GE) because we can just teleport everywhere we want. 
---
The equivalent of cities in, say, FFXIV would be like Zeah. Travelling from Varrock to Zeah has a lot of steps (ignoring teleports) and would offer you that opportunity to explore in the same way to an extent. 
---
Or imagine if desert lands were extended past Sophanem. That could get similar.
---
Downvote me to hell on this super popular opinion that has already been posted 100 times and on our front page like three times yesterday
---
Why the fuck does everyone on reddit do this?
---
Not to mention a significant portion of the player base is easily swayed by the opinions of content creators and other figures whose sole object is your clicks.
---
Thanks! I went ahead and got the ancestral :D
---
I'm sure part of it is people now actually have the ability to decide what updates go through and which didn't unlike before, and there are some updates where I wish that was the case now.
---
Is there a way to make the resolution better?
---
What skill is that?
---
I DONT HAVE 9+ MILL BECAUSE I GOT HACKED.
---
&gt; That is not to say you should vote for a skill you dislike for the chance of another skill you do like being offered later, but you should vote based on the merit of the skill being offered alone and not based on whether it is a good as X idea.
---
\*EDIT\* GOT MY ACCOUNT BANK BUT ITEMS CLEARED (i dont really care for the gp/items i lost)  
---
thank you jagex
---
This guy cannons.
---
Yes but nobody actually spells it like that so it's wrong. Jagex won't respond to this post.
---
The game is absolutely disgusting. The players who play the game are beyond what any gamer should experience for the first time and it‚Äôs so offending to the gaming community the game should‚Äôve been shut down in 2017 and 2018. The experience of the game itself would be a fun experience if they didn‚Äôt have so much overrun accounts getting fed into the game(botting). There are legitimate people in this world making legitimate money off the game. Many illegal websites supporting the illegal market of the and breaking the runescape rules itself(which is -no persons should buy/sell any product that belongs to jagex) and everything in game belongs to them even if it YOUR items in YOUR bank. It‚Äôs a shame to those people who‚Äôd like to play the game for fun and have a good time with friends. It‚Äôs overgrown with most middle aged men who are entirely ruthless to others who enter the game. Many people agree with me on this statement that it has had one of the worst community based people in any mmorpg or game in general. If I‚Äôd rate the game for the community it wouldn‚Äôt even get half a star. But here‚Äôs the best part, the game is not policed in any way. Like other games such as league of legends you can put a block or shut someone out from having any contact (accounts being able to see each other) whatsoever. But in runescape that‚Äôs not the case. If the person you blocked or reported is online and you did everything you could not to see that account again you‚Äôd have to think again because they‚Äôre are ways and even websites of tracking people in game. Do the best part? It‚Äôs the fact that the people who run the game can‚Äôt do anything about their own game being run by bots and illegal markets and if they‚Äôre not participating then they‚Äôre just really pathetic to not care about their game enough to stop the botting and other fishy things that go on in runescape. You can see thousands of online accounts in the so called ‚Äúdual arena‚Äù on world 302 manipulating players and finding ways to go around the system to steal your money from you. Now you don‚Äôt have to enter there but if you do your most likely going to be bombarded with fishy accounts, illegal participants, who are pretending to be someone they‚Äôre not and steal your money right from under you. Now all this craziness and the employees of runescape don‚Äôt care enough to change some of their own rules to stop these ongoing illegal actions. In my opinion the employees are just as bad if they aren‚Äôt participating because they can stop it if they wanted to but they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been going on for years and people have complained and complained about what‚Äôs been going on. We‚Äôd rather see if shut down that continue to frustrate the rest of the community. Games shouldn‚Äôt be played this way that‚Äôs not they‚Äôre intention nor is it what the gaming community is after. We need to take further measures in insuring that this game be shut down or otherwise rated not even half a star. Now I‚Äôll get comments like we‚Äôll that wasn‚Äôt my experience. We have all had fun on this game at one point or another but we have all been up to our knees in the disgust it brings to communities. Thanks and let‚Äôs get this game in the past!!

1 ticking bolts is the fastest way to 99 but the cost is like 1b lol

It's just crafting. But you make bis gear for multiple styles. Oh and its summoning. Oh and its  aoe combat buffs. Yeah bro totally similar to the other buyable
---
Fuck fr? üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
---
But it is not. I was talking about two skills you like but voting no to one because you like another more. The reply wasn't taking that stance, thus missing the point of my original comment. And I did address and agree with their point; it just wasn't relevant to my original comment since they were discussing different things that only sound similar if you misunderstand them.
---
See and that is where I think you're wrong, when a major update hits that the uninformed majority doesn't like the uninformed majority will simply quit the same way they have before. I also never once said that anyone should be forced to vote, and as the current polling system stands there is an option for every question to opt out of the vote. To think that would change is simple minded. 
---
Your arguments only show that you would prefer an uninformed majority which to me is stupidity if you actually care about this game you're voting for. The only thing I have argued for is more visibility to the polling system that you seem so fond of because I would rather the actual masses steer the game in the direction it should go.
---
What actually is the point in this other then rwt surely that‚Äôs long past enjoyable
---
&gt; change of pace to combat
---
Have you tried playing RuneScape 3?
---
You can make your money back with the blowpipe and buy the dagger later. Revs is good money. But do whatever is fun, you can always train melee for a bit and sell if needed.
---
no, that sounds terrible and will completely change the combat meta. I play os because I like the meta. If I wanted to play something like that I'd play rs3 or literally any other mmo
---
56 magic. Probably unquested. Trash acc tbh. Cant wait to see you in pvp.

Where do you find the survey?
---
Mage not really required for edge
---
Might use foot pedal or splash to get 94 for deep wild PK
---
^^^Or ^^^maybe ^^^artisan? Its pretty crazy to me how difficult it is to think of a new skill that would tie in with other skills. Sailing would be ok, but I guess I just dont like the idea of having another skill be totally instanced.
---
am not a relationship expert but arent you supposed to support your SO hobbies instead of cracking it down? :| even when they might not interest it as much
---
jagex can already and has already been doing that anyway, if they feel the issue is integral enough to game balance/game integrity. they did that years ago with splashing/6hr nmz nerfs for example.
---
I am personally not really okay with the way that these lower tier robes are acquired. It feels really bad as an ultimate ironman to have to rely solely on rng drops while regearing between bounty hunter failures ("I'm 0/3 lol").
---
As a mage pure it has never felt right that the other two parts of the combat triangle can make their gear between runs, while my class is hoping for a good roll.
---
letterkeney. my boi
---
Summoning wasn't mandatory. Before the introduction of the mini nex familiars. It wasn't a massive difference between having summoning and not for skills. 
---
The vast majority of players don't use tick manipulation so efficiently is out on this one. It's an item sink and gold sink. 
---
Good luck finding a tob team with cheap gear and 0 kc. You'll be doing it with noobs until you get at least 20 kc. It's just most people don't want to teach people. It was the same with dungeoneering I even had trouble finding good teams with over 100 dung and hexhunter not that anyone believed that I had one even though I had done sub 8 larges.
---
Invention is a great skill with good rewards. Saying it's shit because you don't have it and top pvmers want you to have bis gear is a stupid argument. 
---
They aren't perfect skills but they are miles away better that this shit storm. If they were introduced they could easily have some issues fixed.
---
For real tho.
---
Huh, that's neat.

I get that but it's not in a vacuum, one getting approved is definitely going to delay or outright cancel another option

Watermelons only make super compost tho...?

You get the chance of the pet upon finishing the harvest, not per pick.

Nope, we understand it fine. You are the one who is misunderstanding, deliberately it seems. You are known for your troll posts though, so carry on. This appears to be one of them.
---
Oh ok lol
---
Taking existing content and doing something cool with it? Hell yeah, man, cheers from iraq.
---
Taking new content that requires a potentially significant grind just to access that one part that """""everyone""""" wanted? I'm good.
---
Where's Lumbridge?
---
100% agreed, the idea of a new skill is still exciting, I am voting yes
---
Ramsay Bolton is putting up a fight.
---
The game started with a vote... a huge vote. and it's been very succesful as is. There hasn't been much content outsides zulrah that's been uh maybe we should have tuned it better.
---
also more people definitely vote in the polls than  represented by reddit/discord. If they wanted more votes they could throw out random prizes to votes, or leave the polls open longer. Its not just the vocal community. Its the active community, and they should decide how the games going because they are still playing.
---
Perhaps not. That said, Sailing did do better than Artisan so we'll have to wait and see if Warding does better than Sailing. If the trend does continue upward, a skill would probably pass eventually.
---
I feel bad for Jagex when they try to ask the community for feedback on how to change and improve their proposed skill into something you can enjoy and would vote yes to, but instead of giving them legitimate criticism or points for them consider you drop a "HURR DURR POLLS ARE RIGGED MY VOICE DOESN'T MATTER".
---
You aren't helping the Warding situation with childish responses like this, if this is legitimately what you replied to their question with.
---
Took me 41 kills :( good luck

10 bots isn't *that* bad. Ge on f2p is a lot more aids

How many kills a trip do you get with ahrims? I wear dhide with occult and seers (I) and get 30-35 kc a trip. Wondering if ahrims is better or not.

Buddy boy, I simply said to take the IDEA over to rs3. I didn‚Äôt tell him to go play a different version of the game entirely such as your private server suggestion did. There was a reason they made old school, let‚Äôs not suggest things that turn us back to the rs3 route.
---
I‚Äôm at 2.4k and this scares me. I‚Äôve had 2 picks and visages, but all I‚Äôm after is pet.
---
Well, we're quite far from 10K total level so I don't think that is a valid concern. But I can get that some players don't want to see many new skills. Still, I'd say it is foolish to deny thing you'd like on the hope of other things. It is like saying no to cake because you want to save room for ice cream, but there is no ice cream there and you don't know if the ice cream place is still open. Personally, I am hesitant about a 25th skill since the interface only has room for 24, but I'm not going to oppose a skill just because it isn't perfect; good is good enough.
---
Also, while the skills of RS2 were fun, I don't think OSRS can do the same. Summoning had a lot of hype but it was also game-changing (and not without its criticisms). But most other skills shared something in common: surprise and mystery. We had no idea Construction or Dungeoneering were coming. They weren't even in the BTS; they were just dropped with little hint. But if we knew from the start how Construction worked, what rooms they were, and the benefits of all the hotspots, it wouldn't have been nearly as exciting. With OSRS, we have to get those kinds of details to vote on it so most, if not all, of that surprise and mystery is gone. So while they do provide something new, I do question how much a new skill in general make the game more fun to play.
---
Yeah, when making a post about warding, don‚Äôt use 75% of the post to talk about how agility and construction needs to be introduced into combat

Its common, OP just dumb.
---
Nice, it personally doesn't sound appealing to me. It's interesting, though.
---
I wouldn't be at all surprised if the polling process massively limited the creativity of the Jagex team, either. There are probably ideas that die on the conceptual stage because they realize early on that it would be difficult to design it in a way that would pass a poll. It's just common sense that there is no majority group in OSRS - there are many factional minority groups who have their own preferences and you have to placate enough of them that no significant voting bloc comes out to vote no en masse to something, because no votes have 3x the weight of yes votes. Polls don't determine what the majority of players want, they determine what certain vindictive minorities don't want.

Minecraft at the time of release filled a gap of true sandbox gameplay in a time where it really didn't exist the way it does today. Think of a game that offered both the survival gameplay that drew in goal oriented players and the tools that drew in the creative crowd. Minecraft offered both. Thats why people flocked to it.

We would have been fine without Hunter...
---
Lmao where the hell were you people when it came out. The skill was received super positively  and the forums were booming with positivity. Content wasn‚Äôt made ‚Äúbrain dead‚Äù because of the skill. It was enhanced and offered tons of new ways to skill and quest efficiently, train combat, boss, etc. Not to mention how charms made it worth it to kill older unused monsters and how making pouches were an awesome item sink. I was one of the first 50 to get to 99 summoning, I thought the skill was excellent.
---
If you want to talk poor design thenDivination was shite skill upon release andInvention was half assed. Summoning and Dungeoneering were amazing and deserve to be recognized.
---
Making RC buyable is not fine or good for the game. If high RC was easier to obtain, that would negatively affect rune prices since more players would have access to stuff like 2x nats and it would ruin RC's profit. RC is not the Magic version of Smithing or Crafting and turning it into that effectively removes what RC currently is. We shouldn't want to make all skills copies of the same sorts of things; not all Artisan skills need to be high exp buyable. And I already said that Crafting already does make Magic Robes, so Robe Crafting would make more sense as a Crafting expansion than an RC expansion.
---
Original looks a lot better for sure.
---
I'm thinking I already know the answer, but I haven't checked on my island since I finished the quest, like... 4 months ago.  Should I probably just go ahead and alch myself now?
---
Which is less exp than ammonites.
---
Yeah seriously there's too much "let's keep the game the same until I get 99 in every skill" mentality. Let the game be dynamic and let developers take exciting risks. 
---
The poll (and subreddits like this) are destroying innovation. Warding is the very first skill made in new OSRS with the intent being to bridge a gap of content, rather than add a mountain of new/unique stuff. They clearly stated the intent and it makes sense. It also opens an unintended feature for crafting (various fabrics and non-stat clothing).
---
Yeah its just done via abyss like any other rune. I like osrs blood rc a lot more
---
Dungeoneering &gt;any new skill
---
My point was that other skills like Agility, RC and Construction need more content instead of adding Warding.
---
So I gave some ideas as to the type of content which could be added instead. How wasn't that relevant?
---
For a game that has a majority of non combat based skills it's fair to have suggestions blending non combat and combat based activities.
---
You make it sound like this is the first time this has happend in rs.
---
Where do I go for this?
---
without hardmode everything has shit hp
---
I was going to use drakes medallion and ping ping back and forth between Meyerditch laboratories and burgh de rott
---
I wouldn't worry about it until you've got at least 100 combat. The  veteran boat makes it a lot faster, and it's not super useful at lower levels anyway.
---
Of all the anti-warding posts I've seen, this is the worst idea.
---
It will take months of valuable dev time to get this skill to a point where it is available to the player base even in a beta form. Hard work and a huge waste of time for the dev team if it gets voted against.
---
Honestly I dont mind infinity being craftable. 
---
Right now all the prices of MTA items are just inflated by the fact that goldfarmers stop botting MTA if profit drops below 200k gp/h. Thats not good content.
---
Dailies and locking raid content behind 2 days wait.
---
&gt; With OSRS, we have to get those kinds of details to vote on it so most, if not all, of that surprise and mystery is gone.
---
Which is why, given the trust I have in the dev team we have, I'd be fine with allowing content without a poll. Or vague polls like "do you want a new skill" for some things.
---

Its not about partying or all that imo. 
---
Take your 1000 hour playing time. Say half was afk so we‚Äôll take that off. You know how many skills you could learn in that time? Businesses you couldve built? Runescape is a huuge time sink and yeah for sure its fun. Thats why we lose so much time on it. But for all of us, the day WILL come where you wont logon anymore and youll realize all that time spent will be lost because youll have nothing to show for it anymore (because the false accomplishments wont have any ‚Äòreal‚Äô value). 
---
Partying is great, but it doesnt take most of your day, every day. Maybe its just me.. i just think that if youre playing story modes, atleast you get to experience different worlds. A lot of the community (incoming prejudice pls dont downvote) practically solely plays runescape. One day theyll grow out of it and itll all be for nothing, whereas you could learn instruments/languages/skills (such as gourmet cooking, dancing, sports). Thats just my two cents though, to each their own
---
Quality

Nah, many people dc'd at same time as me on pvp world. People were mad af lol

Well.... not to brag, but I got 6 seerculls in 300 kills instead of the rings. So ha, joke's on you

Gwd was put in the game long before and mostly everyone loved and ofc this would pass, what would be BIS if we didn‚Äôt have gwd, black dhide, rcb, barrows Armour, Bandos Armour barely gives any more max hits, Armadyl is just more range attack, zammy items aren‚Äôt that useful except for z hasta and spear which aren‚Äôt BIS
---
This one feels like it was changed because of reddit crying, memes, etc rather than an integrity change. As they polled it and it failed a poll.
---
Excellent work, this is much more simplified. Still gonna be a no from me, but good work nonetheless.
---
The majority of my play time is spent during work commutes and pre-bedtime stuff. And yes I just switch over to the wiki whenever I need to look at a guide :) don't have many opportunities for PC play so mobile works. And thanks! :D
---
Is that just one combat stat? Or is that including the HP xp?
---
Makes sense to me.. the only grapple shortcut I use is that one at the observatory. And, big surprise, that is the only one that doesn't make you use a grapple after the first time
---
I think it should be an item sink. Pay Diango say 1m + an item and the item and the money get deleted from the game, but the item becomes keepsaked. You can only have 1 item per item slot keepsaked at a time, and if you keepsake another item, the old one gets deleted. No penalty for dying, just a decent GP sink + item sink.
---
Nice! Finishing the meds today then gonna skill for all the hards.
---
Apology accept- hoping for the pity bucket tomorrow

The rng balances out... just not for you.

Could be made slightly differently but yes, the core idea of exploration and minigame-ness is the same.
---
Needless mention of girlfriend, needless position of protein shaker, so...
---
How many days ago did you lose your virginity?
---
Nobody cares
---
I dont entirelt disagree. But good luck getting people to vote yes to something with the best rewards locked behind 90 rc.
---
congrats :D 
---
, what location is that ?
---
I think the mutes last an hour or two now
---
Also chambers or xeric and theatre blood gave BIS with better max hits and everyone loved it, passed by the polls by a mile
---
Hm I actually don't know, I assumed the results were going to remain hidden the whole time but I could be wrong
---
IMO if they really want to force that mechanic into warding the compromise should be either:
---
1) The battle robes are made with material acquired from dissolving Ancestral. Lore explanation would be that you re-weave the Ancestral robes with the new Hides to boost their power on that enemy type, but only that enemy type. Would be a good way to add re-colors with new models of ancestral that everyone's been wanting. This would stop Ancestral from crashing but doesn't solve the issue that it just replaces Ancestral's niches.
---
2) You make augments instead of robes, the augments can be applied to gear with a 70+ Magic Requirement. Augments would add +%dmg to the gear but only for the monster the augment is meant to counter. So Ahrim's would get 2.5% for example but Ancestral gets 5%. Slightly devalues Ancestral because you can get %dmg on Ahrim's now but the BiS gears still remain dominant and midgame players who can't afford Ancestral can benefit as well. Some people might dislike it for being too RS3 though.

Excluding hp (though i was on shared mostly so all 3 i guess)

800k profit on Monkfish spending 3.7m
---
1.3m profit on Karambwan spending 4.8m
---
What should I do?!
---
Slayer helm is actually super low down the list in terms of Slayer unlock priority.  Rushing a Slayer helm over block list/superiors/etc is noobier than being high level with black mask.
---
&gt; I doubt anything can top tbow spawn or max cash bug.
---
jagex: hold my beer
---
I'm not overly salty about it, it just really is annoying because they're too lazy to find their own world lol
---
Dude the one where courage is afraid of not being perfect because of that crazy scary etiquette teacher. Not a scary subject, but the nightmare he had was fucking creepy as all hell.
---
Subscribe
---
Then explain the difference between OSRS and RS3 and describe how they will remain distinct and the feeling of OSRS won't be corrupted
---
to be fair the scrollbars are really aids to use on mobile.
---
The "E" in grand exchange really bothers me. Other than that... you do you. But that E.. ugh..
---
People way smarter than you have done the math.
---
I've had 1 def and 1 pay for over 2 years now and I love seeing that 1/1, 0xp, 83xp remaining
---
even OSRS can't escape brexit
---
For the mage portion you can use a trident while wearing full melle gear. Only in absolute max do you need to switch anything because bis melee gear is under the splash threshold now
---
2k world yay
---
It's because she's dead, bro
---
lol woah its like you got a sample size of 2000 out of 345k that commented on a random and expect that reaction/figure not to change when other people see the same idea
---
Gold? Im sorry i think you mean piss yellow
---
Because we don't need Warding. That's a fact
---
There are parts of warding that do seem to make sense in other skills that are lacking in utility. That being said, Warding could provide some truly unique utility to the game. Maybe they could add ward enchants to gear to give slight stat boosts but degrade over time as part of the end game warding. Something to make it a living skill and not just another 99?
---
I like that idea! However, I was actually considering something very close. For certain updates that are considered 'game changing', perhaps Jagex could recruit a bunch of people maybe in the hundreds, who have exceptional game knowledge and experience and are willing to keep an open mind about things. These people should work closely with the developers, suggest balance and play test everything before it's released. This was the system that was followed by quite a few games out there, I can speak for one, namely 'Heroes of Newerth'.
---
And the chance is actually not 7500. 7500 is the base chance (B). 
---
The drop rate is B-(lvl*25).
---
At 99 the drop rate would be 7500-(99*25)= 5025
---
Id be for a playtest as well. I think they could implement the rewards and a basic concept. I do think they should take longer than a month to come up with it properly though.
---
Cause it was a new game
---
Because it's not coherent with the design of the game as a whole. Nobody cares that battle wards are similar to RS3. That's misunderstanding everything. The reason people often point to RS3 as being problematic is EOC which completely wiped the player base. While you might say that battle wards add diversity and new aspects to the game, that's the exact opposite of what people want. A large reason that people even play runescape is because of its niche feel, simplicity, and nostalgia. Warding takes away all three of those.
---
Damn every time I see fan art I get jealous as I can't draw! This is wonderful btw
---
I agree getting a new skill is exciting but Warding is so shit.
---
Tagged as humor but isnt funny. Classic /r/2007scape
---
Hmm i guess it is better then. Its just much easier to click on a potion every 15-20 minutes on my phone when im in class than to do a full aggro reset.
---
My personal favorite is Amascut, we still don't know if she's actually crazy or just really desperate to resurrect Tumeken. She has to - spoiler alert - be collecting pieces of his soul for a reason, right? And considering daddy dearest blew himself up to stop the mahjarrat she and Icthlarin brought over she'd probably feel pretty bad about it. Not to mention how horribly things have been going for their people the last few millenia. It's no wonder she'd feel a few souls that would end up in some nightmare fuel slowly lose your memories afterlife anyway would be a small price to pay to finally turn things around.
---
That, and her dialogue is hilarious when she's disguised as a damsel in distress.
---
**Player**: I rescued your sister or, at least, it seems she escaped. I assume you have some sort of psychic link and know that she is safe.
---
**Sumona**: Yes, of course. I am delighted, happy, ecstatic.
---
Isn't it called population control?
---
The idea was dogshit tbh
---
It was disgusting even thinking about Zeah for a year after it was first released. They literally said it didn't perform how they wanted so they werent going to do anything else with it. Now however many years later we're finally getting a real rework, house by house starting with hosidious.
---
Nice video. So refreshing actually seeing a decent pure vid with music instead of shit commentary. 10/10.
---
That's a fair statement, but I feel like most people dont play with max efficiency in mind at all times. Theres definitely times where I want to be efficient and get a level fast and times where I just want to enjoy the skill I'm doing. Idk man I'd just like to see warding/battlewards in action before making an opinion on the skill, but most people are just trying to shut it down
---
Suddenly got an urge to say cellar door and flood the local school.
---
Should have just been added after passing the first time smh
---
Rs3 has incense sticks made with logs ashes and herbs. You light them for combat bonus, made with FM level
---
Agreed.  I‚Äôm not a fan of this version of warding, but at least OP is thinking productively instead of joining the pro/anti circlejerk.  We need more of these posts and less surface level shit talking
---
200 ain't dry fuck off
---
Every non fantasy based aspect of the game is (at least loosely) based on real life.. That's why we light fires with tinderbox's, chop trees with hatchets and cook food on stove tops.
---
[no summoning plz and thx.](https://imgur.com/gallery/voGMGTr)
---
But, to more specifically go through your comment, 
---
Mind Ward - just because another aspect of pvming has a lot of impact does not mean that more should be added? I could say that EATING FOOD HEALS YOUR HP THAT'S FUCKIGN GAME CHANGING. Doesn't justify other more complex systems being added.
---
Chaos - Why do you think they de-aggro in the first place? Starting to sound a lot like NMZ?
---
Death Ward - There's a reason aoe is confined to a specific spellbook.
---
Blood - You're literally whining that "oh im too poor to afford end game content so just make it free"
---
Soul - Literally nobody cares if its new or not. It's a stupid idea that has no place in the game as it stands.
---
Wrath - I honestly don't understand how you can be so deluded to the larger issues
---
HahAhaHahA RuNeCrAfTiNg BaD
---
the crabs were finally laid to rest and you bring this up, you fiend
---
Kinda off topic kinda not. What pots are you making, and how much did it cost?
---
Ps cute cat
---
I always felt that the game lacked the ability to make magic armor, amd I dont dislike the new skill (I am a dungeoneering apologist), but I do think it should be rolled i to runecrafting.
---
You‚Äôre going to get downvoted cause Bandwagon Warding Fags
---
fine with me
---
I had to upvote him lmao
---
wow you are so uninformed. the potential rewards in the blogs are simply ideas that can be tweaked or completely scrapped based on player feedback. the armors will be balanced so that they don't completely outperform already bis gear. cerb crystal boots, imbues, etc etc were tacked on to other skills because there wasn't any place to put them. warding didn't exist so they had to add them to something. so your point about that is pointless too.
---
Minigame teleports have a 20 minute cooldown, not 30
---
Because being a zerker is pretty fun and I think he should try it out before moving on past his defence lvl
---
I'm sure it's comparable. Nmz is also safer for no attention since nobody can crash you.  It's also 18-20 minutes with no attention then just a couple clicks to sip another super combat and a few absorbs.
---
If you're trying for more xp/hr over afk neither method is great.
---
I agree, and your point is correct. Mini game teleports to a lesser extent are lodestones. This place is a fucking shithole with retards roaming around 24/7 so despite this nothing regarding removing minigame teleports will gain any traction or be voted in. I‚Äôve tried everything.
---
Yes to artisan, yes to summoning, and no to dungeoneering?
---
How do I remove someone else's ability to vote?
---
No?
---
OSRS graphics stands up against the test of time not cause they are really bad or really good, but because they have a certain charm to them which even newer content captures somewhat.
---
when i tried doing this they brought their main to barrage them lol
---
Seen this already like 3 times.
---
This is an outrage
---
You literally just play without breaking rules. Jagex has said there's no application process or anything because they have better results with randomly selecting people and seeing if they fit to be a pmod. If you have been chosen (which will happen without you even knowing) you will receive a message to your account on the runescape site. Essentially, if you're the type of person who really wants to be pmod, chances are you're the type of person jagex doesn't want to be a pmod.
---
That's it. They said recently that they are going to do another mass wave of pmod invites for about 100-200 people soon, so that's gonna be your main chance.
---
This made my day
---
you would be a cunt to if you gained 1b agility xp
---
Nah they'd falsely wipe someone and be like "ooh jeez oopsie woopsie the technology isn't there to get your shot back".
---
seriously fucked up.
---
People shit on the zammy boss, but his relatively common drop rate on the spear can make him pretty good.
---
Of course it's game changing, it's BIS. BCP + Tassets was an enormous upgrade over the fighter torso and barrows legs, it's undegradable and increases your max hit, and every single person who does melee combat in this game wants a set of it...
---
DHCB is extremely good in its niche, probably too good, but it's only a niche. 
---
Also this conversation is completely tangential to the point I was trying to make in my post, fine, maybe GWD would pass today, it doesn't change the core argument of my post...
---
How do you get that interface?
---
choose to limit your self blah blah
---
Summoning or gtfo
---
watch the livestream it addresses a lot of your concerns is a really thoughtful way
---
well neit is at alch value so it cant really devalue it more. serp is...oh well, less profit for the snake and more for gwders
---
Psa but idk if anyone will see this. Bonecrusher necklace no longer works in the inventory
---
I would downvote but you cant tell me what to do!
---
That awkward moment when you spell Al Kharid as Al Karid
---
I can never get 100k at crabs I always kill them too quickly and have to wait which drops my xp, is there a 4x ammonite spawn I'm missing?
---
you really hate new content huh
---
There's one where courage is going through like an apartment building IIRC, and a girl is playing some instrument and it ends up being a jumpscare.
---
I really avoid horror altogether as a genre these days. I wonder if being terrified of courage as a child cemented that.
---
This is amazing!! Maybe to add a fix for splashing, higher tiered wards (chaos or higher talisman) could have their life extended by having players splash spells on them. 
---
This would make wards social hubs and would increase player interaction across various subgroups of the community (Im imagining CCs for players looking to train warding for extended periods coordinating with players who want to splash)
---
Zeah shaker cup nice
---
Eh, changing the game because of a strat is wack.  
---
There‚Äôs thing people could‚Äôve done, you‚Äôll play differently if you know it‚Äôs coming.  You could rush, form alliances to break the hold, etc.  
---
They didn‚Äôt even let it play out, they even gave everyone barrows gloves at the end.  Lame.
---
I responded within 5 minutes of your first post retard i think it was actually within 30 seconds get tf out of here

"expensive gear"  The entire post is about a D pick, so its safe to assume that is the expensive gear in question.
---
Thank you for this, it looks a lot more easy to understand than the original post. Also I agree with removing all those buff auras and summoning stuff..

what about yellow graceful cape
---
It took me way to long to figure out what you were flexing in this pic.
---
Looked at the quests and quest list for a bit, then double read chat. Finally I noticed the cape lol.
---
I‚Äôm pretty late with this, but bursting and barraging are both very similar alternatives to ‚Äúmage‚Äù cannons and offer tremendous experience for the cost.
---
Cute
---
Do you not remember or are you just being a jackass?  The game literally died from change and it took a massive effort to bring it back to normal. 
---
I‚Äôm not against change, but to throw peoples argument that this particular change is bad, *because it‚Äôs change* is ridiculous.  
---
This is going to have a monumental effect on the game.
---
Wow, Randeeleeshous sucks now lol. Pathetic
---
Lmfao this must be a jokd
---
Filthy casual
---
Fricken 10 slash bonus AND 4 str? I wouldn't mind a helmet that gives slash accuracy as a focus, but 4 str as well is too much.
---
Revert bank back to osrs launch, bank updates are too RS3.
---
O wait
---
Top floor of the Myth's Guild, with portals to the other quest-based guilds (Champions, Heroes, Legends).
---
So you don‚Äôt end up spending $7 on a ban
---
Warding is just trying *way* too hard to be a massively overhauling game changing skill. Things like hunter and farming that were added could almost be entirely grouped as a giant mini games with the level up unlocks being rewards.
---
I feel like just because Jagex thinks it‚Äôs time to add a new skill, said new skill needs to be the mother of all skills, overflowing with content. In my and a lot of others opinions, the ‚Äúoverflowing with content‚Äù route just opens up a ton of ways to throw off the balance/meta of things and completey ruin some things into dead content. Trying to make BIS magic armor/weapons through a craft-able like skill completely shits on end game content rewards like raids.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest if RuneScape was a cheese burger, combat (pvm/pvp/slayer) would be the patty, skilling would be the cheese, quests would be the lettuce and tomato, mini games the condiments etc... With combat being the most majorly widespread enjoyed activity the players take part in, the endgame gear is gonna come from the highest risk vs reward combat bosses. Just because it‚Äôs time for a new skill doesn‚Äôt mean it needs to completely revolutionize everything.

RS3 has incense burning but it no longer requires standing close to a fire source. Can RS3 get all the good OSRS ideas that that have been voted against?
---
I use RuneLite and somehow managed to remove the ability to see "wield" or "use" or "eat" whenever I hover over inventory items.
---
Does anyone know how to fix this?
---
Thanks! I looked at the wiki, idk how I missed that.

Beginner clue I think

Haven‚Äôt had those in years, but I distinctly remember having some ‚ÄúTwist and Shout‚Äù cookies before basketball practice as a kid and felt so nasty the entire practice haha
---
Isn't the Scythe of Vitur the same as the RS3 Noxious scythe and a legacy friendly version of the Cleave ability?
---
You aren't speaking rationally. Either rapier, avernic, AND bandos are game changing upgrades, or none are (avernic is better than full bandos alone). Scythe, bp, and tbow increased dps by LITERALLY over 20x what gwd did. You need to think less subjectively about what you're saying.
---
What are your stats

As a preteen in those days with shitty rural internet, I had almost no idea what I was doing, but it was fun!

Yeah I heard lots of people say it was an exact copy of A New Hope. If it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it I guess :/

Dicing was the best part of of RuneScape imo. 12 year old me couldn‚Äôt commit to maxing account but would sit there and try to snipe dice.
---
~40,000-42,000 votes cast. That doesn't account for duplicates etc. but thats a sizeable population considering there used to only be ~100-200k uniques per week. The size of players has definitely increased greatly since mobile. There are countries with less turnout than that.

Do OSRS player actually enjoy any non-combat skill that's not slayer?

Yeah still gonna be a no. This just sounds like a very tedious boring expensive slow skill. I know there are already skills like this but we have to have them as they already exist ha. At least we can say no to this one
---
You add more they become less appealing

This.

Oh boy, "How do we make the most useless skillcape *even more* useless?" Grapple stashes. Fletching Cape needs a rework. Grapple stashes are a great idea. Make this happen.

Does the Wilderness Bandit General Store decrease the price it buys things at like normal stores? I know it buys at high alch so even if it does it'd still be profitible to oversell but I'd like to know exactly what to expect before going into the Wilderness.

If players don't like it as its own skill, I expect this is what they will do. I don't think it is bad for them to offer it as a skill if players want it; doing it as its own skill does allow for it to be more involved than if it were part of existing skills. The example I often use is how Construction could have been an expansion to Crafting, Fletching, Smithing, and such but then it wouldn't be able to do as much as it could as its own skill (e.g. how would you unlock new rooms types, house sizes, servants, etc).
---
But either way, I expect that the post-Prif update slot will be a Magic update, whether it comes as Warding or smaller expansions to various skills. Or perhaps Warding fails and they offer something else entirely.
---
Everyones entitled to their opinions, I‚Äôll just be voting no unless they remove the battle wards section.

Well I'm 24 and also enjoy Steven Universe!
