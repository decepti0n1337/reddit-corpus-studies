What is this about entitlement?  If someone wasn't playing at the time of the release of said mount/achievement and they want to get it they can't.  There's no way for him to get it anymore because they've artificially put a limit on the item.  They could put in the same amount of work and not get the same item because they didn't play when it was relevant content.

With GDPR they can be forced to reveal certain things now. There was a guy who was banned for using a third party tool on WoW, he filed a request for all his data, it showed that he was detected using using a program called "" (an empty string), so it was just a bug in their system. Got himself unbanned with that info haha

Reading comprehension really isn't your strong suit huh.
---
\&gt;I think one side thinks that this game isn't ruined by RWT as gold is still very difficult to obtain, I haven't seen the economy crash since the Venuzuealans started being talked about on Reddit.  
---
\&gt;I think most players that are like the grey golem's face are of the opinion "see no harm, do no harm" I've never had an in game problem with them.
---

---
The problem is that's not a correct assumption.  The consequences of RWT are mostly invisible but they're there - botting and gold farming is the main reason that skilling/common pvm is almost completely worthless as a source of money, and even bosses have to be put behind arbitrary fences in order for them to sustain value.  As such, it's not really true that RWT is harmless - it's almost the primary reason the game's meta has evolved as it has, and is at least partially responsible for a lot of the reason moneyscape and boss-scape are synonyms.  I'd slate that whole dynamic down to one of the primary things people are frustrated about in osrs.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When confronted with this, people instantly jump onto the "of course starving children are more important than a 'stupid children's game's' balancing!" (I quote the stupid children's game part, the other absolute brick that walked in assumed I myself was calling osrs a stupid children's game).  Which is a fair point - but what people don't realize that is that excuse can go a long way.  
---
After all, when wouldn't starving children outweigh how fun or unfun a game is to play?  In that frame, the game could be completely unfun to play and that would still be justified because of fucking course starving children are more important.  
---
So if we're introducing this can of worms, then shouldn't helping starving children way outweigh your desire to play that game you (not you, transitive you) just called a stupid children's game?  If you introduce the "starving children" logic, you suddenly find that there really isn't much involving this game that isn't less important - even the ability to play it.  From that point, just not playing this game and using the time to help a charity is barely a step.
---
That's the thing - most people going around grandstanding about this issue are suburban white kids with an illusion of a conscience where they're willing to believe that "of course videogame concerns are outweighed by starving children" as long as they're not actively aware of the videogame concerns (back to your whole "people don't see what's wrong with RWT").  But if suddenly a videogame concern that directly and visibly affects them comes into play (like being able to play less osrs because they work for a charity) - suddenly the starving children don't outweigh anything anymore.
---
It's this skin-deep virtue signalling that's kind of disgusting to see.  Similar to how whenever a crisis like in Venuzuela or somewhere happens, people in 1st world nations are super on about "why isn't anyone helping these people?".  However, those same people often balk at the idea of having to themselves accept even a relatively small amount of refugees from said countries.  
---
If you're gonna wield starving children as a moral high ground, you better be willing to stay on that high ground when it affects you more directly, otherwise you're the worst kind of hypocrite.
---
I don't think I've reported many if any people in game, and as the title says, I don't intend to target pk Venu farmers in the wildy.  I'm just here to see how the people making a lot of noise about "nuuu dun report the Ven boi" would react to the logical continuation of their logic.  The answer, as you can see, is not well.
---
\&gt;I think sacrificing your free time to help a country you know nothing about is a little far as well.
---
I think it really is - when one would have spent that same free time to play that same videogame that matters 1000000% less than starving children, according to them.  Also, do you think those people would be willing to sacrifice that same time for a country they know about?  :thinking:

If it was about the rewards you buy with points, then why does it state " any tradeable or untradeable"? All those items are tradeable, so this clearly was a blanket statement referring to all the rewards, including the trophies.
---
It already exists.
---
&gt;How do you not realize shoving shit downs people throat will not make them sympathize with your cause and will only make extremists. 
---
As opposed to what? Never making a statement? Not demonstrating for your cause at all?

Do you think the people who hated Martin Luther King came into being the moment he became a leader of the Civil Rights movement? No, they were already racist, they simply focused their hatred on the black man who dared speak up against discrimination.

It's amazing that you think normal people would see a Pride Parade and come to the conclusion that they need to kill people. The killers were already homophobic, they were angered by the fact LGBTQ people dared challenge them. But if those challenges were never risen, **nothing would ever change**. That's why Pride Parades came into being, to protest and get heard, not to hide and pretend not to exist.

Doubling money! Money-back guarantee!
---
That is the point, they put in the effort during the time it was meant to be put in. Not to mention the natural progression of the game makes it impossible for someone to put in the same effort as those who obtained it originally. They don't need the item, they didn't earn it, there is nothing wrong with not having it. It encourages people to do the content when it was meant to be done.

Reality has a well-known liberal bias, so conservatives are forced to lie. Republicans would still suck Trump's dick after he fucked their own grandmothers in the ass, and we both know it, so what the Senate does won't change the fact that this is the most corrupt and second worst President in history.

*Worst will always be Andrew Jackson, who ignored a Supreme Court order so he could continue a genocide in violation of treaties the US Congress had ratified with sovereign nations.
---
Personally, I don't mind this from a completionist perspective; as soon as the trophies based I knew that would be another headache for true completion. My issue is they stated they would not add discontinued items they leagues and now they decided to do just that without polling it to the players. If players voted on making them discontinued at the start, that would have been fine, but it is extremely bad for them to make this sort of change midway in.
---
It‚Äôs more of an addication than loyalty. Jagex is like big tobacco and we all have cancer.
---
They said they would be untradeable. They did not say they would become discontinued items however. They actually said nothing would become a discontinued item.
---
But regardless of your opinion on trophies, the bigger issue is pushing through game changes based on social media feedback rather than polls. **That** is the true slippery slope here.

Thank you for helping to fight this bullshit, even in fucking 2007scape they try and pull this shit.

It is not a matter of "who to believe". Untradeable is not the same as discontinued. They said the rewards would be available from future leagues; they never said the trophies would be excluded so it applied to them as well.
---
Were u using runelite? Don't see how ur time could be that long if you weren't using the MTA plugin.
---
Yeah, unfortunate but true. But at the same time the authenticator wasn't available at the time I played, so hoping they'd be smart enough to overlook that.

Or worse, when they were 100k

You're not wrong.

Well, I don't think anyone's going to give a fuck about the trophies personally.    I just remember when I started wow and saw the Zulian tiger and thought hey that's a pretty cool mount.  I looked it up and realized I'll never be able to have it. It was disappointing at the time but then you realize everyone just uses the strider anyways.

Banning the person playing hasn't worked out so well for Jagex in the past. They tried that with wildyowns1 and he managed to get other people banned by mirroring their streams and pretending to be playing

There's really no way to reliably do it without too many false positives

In my opinion, it would be beneficial for you just to knock out getting graceful right now. It may take you a few days but once you get it that should take you to level 60 or so, which will be helpful with a lot of quests

If there was and it wasnt from your ip its generally considered your fault aswell as the creator is responsible for the activity.

I don't see why there'd be an increase in supply for consumables. So shouldn't all food, potions and runes be skyrocketing?
---
Or at least following bond's steady rise.
---
Some more popular consumables are skyrocketing (like sharks and brews), but that seems to be related to something that happened early October (BH rework?), which don't match the bond's increase. And other items like prayer pots, super combat potions, runes and anglerfish have been reasonably stable.
---
but sir, i have this legendary sword from an icyene

You are correct it was Andrew Johnson, and neither he nor Clinton were removed from office by the senate. They served the remainder of their terms and then did not seek reelection, though Clinton couldn't if he wanted to since it was second term.
---
The Zulian tiger is obtainable in the game it is sold through the black market auction house if you obtain 9.9 million gold you can wait for it to show up and buy it. It is also the perfect example of a mount that is impossible to put in the same amount of effort to obtain. Also striders are outdated now that you can water walk with all mounts.
---
tried thieving, but it was too click intensive
---
How does this price difference get to such a point where it's 2.5x more expensive through 1st party? Should jagex lower the bond price to match aftermarket gold price? Would that stop 3rd party selling?
---
It's full of stuff that hasn't become compost yet, right?

Just putting things into perspective, no need to bring sucking dick into this.

Duuude you got it! Congrats! Those farming gains will be a little easier now.

It's not a self fulfilling prophecy, it's basic observation. The Democrat-Republican supremacy developed naturally as a result of the system it evolved in. The amount of people needed to be convinced to not only support a third party, but the same third party makes it infeasible. While they could win in theory, in practice all they do is fracture voter bases.

No, self evident in this case just means the process itself is what he is referring to, and how the democrats are handling it. For example, basing most their case on hearsay and opinion.

Different strokes man, I get deep satisfaction from seeing my inventory fill up with potatoes but can't stand more than 10 minutes of runecrafting.

you don't live to work, if you play to escape then it's a fair investment - if you however literally cannot afford it I can only say maybe less time on the game would help.

Best part is they're shitting on those jobs yet would prefer to go blind staring at a screen all day

Make another with a second dual staff it solves the one arm thing. Also suggest the orbs both go on one end which solves the dirty thing and also looks like balls which is funny.
---
I don't think it does. I thought it made more sense as a cosmetic used to showcase either:
---
* Your highest placing league. Earned once. People say this means competitive people won't play future leagues. Maybe address that with the horrible lack of attention to hiscores instead of discontinued cosmetics
---
* Your placement in the last league. Which would be removed once the following league ends and replaced with where you placed in that.
---
1% of people can obtain dragon tier. No matter what. So each league is creating 1% of accounts with a unique discontinued cosmetic
---
I see the conflict in it but everybody gets a trophy for completing 1 task. If you want to compete for a dragon trophy, that‚Äôs your choice.  
---
Leagues is meant to be a competitive game mode, I wouldn‚Äôt really mind if it changed to not be equipped and made a flex in the achievement hall.
---
Almost every single person complaining has been saying something along the lines of "wow I wish I played it now"
---
How do you expect they would've gotten the trophies without playing? I'm going to call bull fucking shit on all these people that say they would've done future leagues but not twisted. The only other way they would've obtained them is if they were put in the game through other means later on which is easily the most retarded solution imaginable.
---
It's just a bunch of people that thought the game mode was stupid and they didn't want to play it. Future leagues wouldn't have changed that, so now they're missing out. Tough shit.
---
Actually, they started day before yesterday. I got my coins for contributing. Not upvoting. I got 250.
---
I want dungeoneering back
---
No I won't. If I want this dragon cup I have to get it from this league. I won't have "plenty of chances". This is the *only* chance. That is what discontinued means.
---
Gee kinda cute

I needed one today for that quest. Put offer in for 10k but almost did 1m. I‚Äôm always tempted to throw in a 1m offer for quest items. Usually 10k does the trick though.

---
&gt; "Oh you can't. Theyre no longer obtainable".
---
And there's nothing wrong with that. 
---
It's a unique badge you can throw in your bank, alongside dozens and dozens of other similar trophies, for every League you participate in. 
---
If they want similar trophies, they can participate in future leagues.

It's a fucking participation trophy. It should be unique to each League.

Once you get membership it is pretty easy to keep it. 6m May seem like a lot for a bond but if you just spend a bit of time every 2 weeks dedicated to money making it‚Äôs not terrible to upkeep. There is just so much more to do with members content. I suggest joining a cc as well to ask questions, most streamers have a cc open and active even if you don‚Äôt watch said streamer, or you could find one on the forums I guess (I don‚Äôt have much experience there). Remember, google is your friend with this game.

Take a weird leaf and shred it up into that, and ta-da. Chocolate Water with leaf shreds.

That's probably as close to an Energy Potion as you can get that might have at least some flavour.

Otherwise, just find a chocolate bar - crush it - dump it in a bottle of water, and put it in with some sort of herb.

Mint and chocolate usually go pretty well together, IMO.

Niceeee, just so you know if you‚Äôre doing snape grass make sure to also plant the middle flower white tulip or whatever it is flower. It protects your snape grass from ever dying when it‚Äôs fully grown which takes like 10 mins compared to snape grasses 40. Some will still die every now and then but it happens a lot less if you use that white flower (highest flower possible I forget the name)

Oculus is granted manually by jmods upon request to content creators..obviously not anyone can get one. But that's because it can potentially crash the game and isn't stable. When it is deemed stable they said they would release it, but no news since then.

The first day of winter is typically around the 21st of December. There are still 2 days until winter "TECHNICALLY" begins.
---
No it's not being disingenous at all. It is *technically possible*. There is nothing unobtainable in that log. Highly improbable is exactly the right statement. It's very unlikely it could or will ever happen. But to say it's impossible is categorically **false**
---
While collecting everything is pretty much impossible already, now it is impossible outright. Also, this has bigger impacts beyond collecting. Let's say you see a really nice fashionscape with a trophy and want to make something similar; well, you never will be able to do that because you didn't play a certain league where as before any item could always be earned later, even if not easy to obtain.
---
Glad it isn't me
---
Selling grills duh.

And if you start playing in a year? You might still be able to grind enough to collect everything and manage to catch up, but you can never get a trophy for a discontinued league.

Yes pretty much, supply will increase too (i.e. more flippers &amp; more people tempted to buy bonds) but only marginally. So demand is increasing faster than supply so price increases

If we are looking at the rushed impeachment trial that displayed zero solid evidence then I‚Äôve got some very bad news for you about who actually is abusing power
---
Shut up
---
Not our fault you chose poorly :)
---
Fair enough. To me it's not their appearance but their meaning that retains their value. But I wouldn't say leagues will remain a forgotten mode, especially if the trophies remain as they are. Also, since league points can be used for any tradeable league rewards, including past ones, their influence will remain as well.
---
You forgot "no fats no fems no Asians"
---
Also it‚Äôs a little telling that zero republicans voted for it and some democrats defected

Nope. 6k points is about 50 hours of playing if you follow a good method to do so. You have till Jan 16

A gay pride event in a video game isn't trying to convince politicians to legalise gay marriage lmao

Hmm I don't know man what do you think
---
If you've got nothing nice to say, say nothing at all.
---
It's a bug but it's been accepted as a feature similar to other games with in-depth mechanics discovered.
---
How would you ever enforce it?

Whoops, I accidentally turned on rigour when I didn't mean to, lemme turn that off before I lose a prayer poi...**BANNNED**

This is how I feel too, Id compare it to stock managing. Gold farmers and brokers(is that what theyre called?) Both risk a lot of money, its a part of their job. In this case, its a video game, in certain areas I can attack other people, if youre in one of those areas, im gonna attack you.

Are clue scrolls even worth doing most of the time? Ive done lile 15 medium ones and got like 15k maybe max. Ive seen like 2 people make a few mil on an easy before like how tf

ok?
---
no shit.  the trophy is for how you placed in twisted league.  there is only one twisted league.

I'm already in Falador so I figured the white knight would work for the time being and I completely forgot about the stronghold of security! Thank you!
---
Thank you!
---
Can you test ancient mace spec? It boosts prayer.
---
Interesting.
---
the trophy is for how you placed in twisted league.  there is only one twisted league.  sorry you didn't understand that, but it's pretty clear.
---
Cant afford it right now lol that's why I'm playing only free stuff right now.
---
I do understand that. You haven't even commented on what I've brought up. That exact poll mentioned not creating discontinued items. So what about that?
---
\+rep
---
We were far away from this lol
---
Same I have 5 accounts in dragon rank and I absolutely don't want a unique cosmetic reward to show off my efforts!

Great general suggestions.

You can also already get the teleport seed from killing elves in Priff btw

it is so clearly implied in that sentence that I can only assume that you're still taking high school english
---
Its untradable. The poll was for a twisted league trophy. The next league will not be a twisted league, it will be some other league.
---
Yeh I agree with the other rewards. It's why trophies feel so insignificant. It was purely because they wanted a competitive side of it. Why hiscores ranks weren't considered there idk. We don't have % tier rewards for 200m completions. It's purely hiscores ranks. Yet look how many people are passionate about that.
---
I hope a jmod can sort this out
---
A discontinued cosmetic isn‚Äôt bad IMO? I agree tradable discontinues are horrible but they earned these and they‚Äôre not profiting in any way.
---
Discontinued items effect casual and new players the most. Dedicated completionists will be the ones to do them all.
---
A new player literally won't be able to. Holiday events used to be like this, osrs realised the error of that design. Why are we wanting to repeat it?
---
I figure if he was comparing with broad bolts its because he's poor. So, in this context, "to make it more even" sounds odd to me. I agree the comparison with rune bolts/enchanted bolts would be useful to show that the dcb isn't completely outclassed.
---
Good answer glad you have nothing to say on that point.
---
It was clearly spelled out in English. Exactly as I said. You seem to merely be able to insult me rather than actually provide a point.
---
But you're wrong, it wasn't impossible, now it is.
---
That's one way of looking at it, but it's probably just an old school short form of RS3's "Orb of oculus"
---
Its ever so slightly darker I think
---
You gotta look really hard
---
I'm guessing this is a /s. I was all for a unique cosmetic to show off. I don't see why it needs to be permanent and discontinued. What, you don't wanna work next league for a dragon trophy? Good for you, you don't have a dragon trophy now.
---
So more supply will equal the same price?

I wouldn‚Äôt either for a jury that wanted to impeach me before my presidency even started. The American people see through what is happening. 2020 will be a Ronald Reagan style win. Funny thing is libs wanted to impeach him too. We are sick of their abuse and blatant anti Americanism.

&gt; Why not? They can always participate in the next Twisted League, can't they?
---
There will (almost certainly) be more leagues, but there will *never* be another Twisted League. TL is Zeah-locked ironman with a certain set of relics. We don't know what the next league will be, but it won't be that.
---
Here for the smackdown

Probably cause your not wooxwalking
---
creamy good to get serp helm to help with the venom
---
No, that is the reason. There's a decimal hidden from the players so the real XP value is 2b, rounded down from 2.1b because the Gower brothers though it looked cleaner.
---
&gt; people who want them to be obtainable in the future 
---
Do people think there won't be any dragon trophies in the future? I'd be willing to bet that there will be. Sure, people won't be able to get the "Twisted League Dragon Cup" specifically, but too bad! They A. didn't participate in it/ B. were beat by someone who earned it.
---
If someone doesn't participate in the Twisted League, but gets Dragon tier in Vampyre league, should they be able to get the Twisted League Dragon Cup? No, they shouldn't.
---
Dungeoneering is, and will ALWAYS be, the #1 thing I miss and would like to see in OSRS. I never got 99,  I think I got up to like 87 or something, but I loved it nonetheless. As you mentioned, no reward shop as most of those rewards wouldn't fit into the meta of OSRS right now. But I would literally play Dungeoneering right now if there was no reward/XP just because it was so fun. So much variety in gameplay, and as you said, a great combination of skillers and pvmers.

Jagex staff is a fucking joke. They have absolute shit for customer service and the punishment system is flawed beyond belief. Want to know why they won‚Äôt ever actually share evidence? Because they know they‚Äôre in the wrong regularly and are afraid of the liabilities not to mention the player base seeing who they really are. 
---
Just think about how pathetic of a person you have to be to blindly and incorrectly perm ban people? And then you‚Äôre so incompetent at your jobs that you get caught and have to unban said people.. it‚Äôs happened more than once with streamers and that‚Äôs because they are streamers, the rest of us just get bent over.
---
Now think about how they don‚Äôt do bans other than 1-2 days or perm in 99% of situations if not all. How shitty of a person do you have to be? They‚Äôve made it so the real player base quits their game and the botting accounts literally plan to get banned and just make a new botting account. Corrupt as fuck and incapable of understanding the significance of enforcing 1 month bans that actually teach the player base that does screw up not to do it again. 
---
No one takes a 1-2 day mute seriously, they don‚Äôt learn in 1-2 days... the fact that after so many years jagex hasn‚Äôt figured that out is bloody astounding in itself.
---
Anyway good luck, and fuck jagex.
---
I‚Äôm a grunt, so that‚Äôs not surprising. I take pride in that, thanks ü§üüèΩüòÇ love you too
---
U ok?
---
In fact they said the opposite, that they ensured that item would never be discontinued and that they would add them to the main game in some way if leagues ended.
---
What phone do you use? I need a new one that wont die in a year from 1-1.5 hrs/rs a day

Annoying if you're massively afk... very funny if you see someone else or a bot getting killed because they aren't paying attention.

Nice now high alch it
---
Jagex repeatedly clarified that they wouldn't make any discontinued items, both in the initial blog post and in a Q&amp;A stream. 
---
Thus, the only reasonable assumption is that there would be no "Twisted League Dragon Cup", but rather a "League Dragon Cup". 
---
Suddenly, they're going back on their word and we're getting discontinued items without poll.

I was about to complete the 2019 Christmas Event by talking to Santa about saving the bakers but then I died. I lost the Gingerbread Shield somewhere and I am currently unable to complete the quest by talking to Santa. The escaped baker under the Apothecary is also gone. Any idea on how to fix this, get the shield back and turn it in to complete the event?

Love this going to use on leagues with my unlimited prayer!

Yes. I haven't ever even ruined an account, but I can absolutely see the value in this. I can't even think of how it could be a bad addition to the game either. Just have them only subtract like 100xp per lamp, so you can't abuse it any way.

Don‚Äôt know anything coding to propose a solution, but maybe just a minimum on timer of one click?
---
A poster below stated they create content around it so its all a forgone conclusion.
---
"Should a right-click/long-press 'Previous Destination' option be added to charter ships? Selecting this option would take you to the last place you chartered a ship."
---
You charter the ship at the place you leave from, so this is technically correct; but also obviously not what anyone wanted or thought they were voting for.

I‚Äôd imagine it was a split so he sold the rest of his bank

just another point on the list of things nu jagex has done to ruin the game

yes its just a completely worthless item but now there is less defense against future discontinued items because we already have some so why not add more and more and more and more and more then jagex starts selling loot crates with fire phats that are only available for 1 month so buy buy buy hehehehehe epic game HEHEHEHEHEHEHEEHEHE SNIFFY DA POOPY XDDDDDDDDDDD MMMMMMMMM PUT MOAR PUUPY IN ME AUSTISM ^(H33H33H33H33) CAN U COLECT ALL 73 LIMITURD LOOT DIPAIRR ITEMS???????

---
I thought it was a good concept because I like Diablo, so I think I'm extra bitter about it because I was excited about it but it didn't turn out the way I wanted to.
---
The balance is really off, I don't expect them to get it perfect from the get go but some of the decisions they made were just plain stupid IMO. Like why do the easiest skills to train have all the points attached to them? Why does PvM, despite being so hard have so little in the way of incentives to do and points to realistically achieve?
---
Then with regards to balance, I think it was just idiotic to not show us the tasks and relics beforehand. They were too caught up in the idea of wanting to surprise the players and fearing that it'd be boring if people knew the mechanics beforehand that they didn't care about how good those mechanics actually were. If they had shown us this beforehand, they would've fixed a lot of the problems like how the solo raid times were literally impossible until they stealth changed them. 
---
The relics are also kind of boring, like Xeric's Focus was alluded to by Husky as a relic that changed the way we raid to the point where they wouldn't be able to calc DPS (in reference to my question about if the speedrun times were possible), which we then found out was completely false because the relic barely changed anything, it was just the exact same as main game, except you attack one more time with melee. Xeric's Wisdom, the best relic, legit doesn't change anything, it's super boring, and other relics have the same problem too. In general, these are issues that could've been solved by the JMods being more competent or at least showing these to us so we could fix it for them.
---
I don't like how Dragon is percentile based, that just makes it a competition to no-life. With regards to skill-based competition, I thought King of the Skill was far better. I would've preferred the rewards system similar to be similar to Diablo, like put the tasks into categories like PvM, Completionist, Skilling, Raiding, etc., and after you earn a certain amount of points from any of the categories you reach a certain tier. 
---
That's just a (not so brief) summary of some of the issues I have with TL, although there's many other reasons I dislike TL as well.

a lot of multiplayer games actually don't use a lot of data. I remember once getting wifi from my mobile hotspot with 1 bar (sometimes loosing signal) to play Ark evolved online.

ya have to keep in mind that it's not images or videos being transfered all the visuals are pretty much client side I believe. You're just receiving data on where players and npcs are and other simple stuff that's all relayed thru text info.
---
Grindr I am guessing you would be receiving a bunch of images from the server which take up a crazy amount of data even when the images are compressed.

Make it a trophy for the most recently ended league. Why do people feel the need to maintain a reward for a thing that happened years ago (in the future) when people would really only care about recent competitions?
---
Its like flexing your 11 year old soccer trophies as a 25 year old.
---
Oh shit we all get D axes?
---
So if a fight goes on for say an hour, and I only get 1 kill but the other 20 guys in my clan get 6 kills each, how does that tell you how the fight is going? It only tracks the kills you get yourself that you do the most damage on. But you know that right since you seem to know about pvp
---
Read the blog. No discontinued items. I fully expected trophies for tiers in this league. And i fully expected those trophies to then be changed for the next league. Don't get dragon league next league? Too bad, your league trophy degrades.
---
No but being a jerk and doing harassement, yes.
---
The game was designed to run off web browsers in 2000 when someones home internet plan was worse than your phone plan.
---
Nah its something to do with how xp is stored. I think it stores a 1/10th of an xp so it actually uses more memory

It would take thousands of years to finish the collection log.

that just sounds like a steam staff with extra steps

You get high score positions locked at 200m xp which is close

---
Glad you wont be procreating nonetheless
---
I'm confused. Aren't charities basically socialism, and socialism is what caused Venezuela's economic crash? Charities, just like socialized governments take money off the top for 'running costs' and then give a pittance to their people, while also making 'volunteer' positions that in reality do fuck all and just create more work with less outcome.
---
Africa is hungry because it grows no food, and Venezuela is hyper inflated and poor because of its government. Neither of these issues can be fixed by people, governments must take the task to fix this issue. Just pk who you want to pk, make sure to say sit and have a nice day. If you don't put yourself before others, then they will walk all over you. Once you have made enough from being selfish and greedy then you can donate some money to write off that amount and avoid taxes.
---
Take me with you lol i dont give a flip about the valuable drops i just want the pet
---
Exactly the value you said. 2^31
---
That equals *2,147,483,648*
---
Due to the way decimal xp is coded in this game, thats represented in game as 214,748,364.8
---
So thats the maximum XP you could earn in a skill without it causing it to loop back around or cause issues (im not an expert on what would go wrong. Programs i've written simply would fail to compile).
---
That's my understanding of it at least. Happy to read into being wrong, as its an interesting topic.

Except that guy never said anything about "maxed Twitter virgins"? You're projecting your own imagined groups onto his post. 
---
Twitter is a big place. There's more than enough room for the "maxed virgins" you're talking about who constantly complain about devaluation of things they already have **and** for entitled people who think they deserve to earn everything in the game without putting in the work for it.
---
It's not possible to have them all at once though.
---
Also some items are locked behind choices in quests
---
I would just need a trident first. but you aren't wrong
---
You're the first person I've seen who seemed to think they would *take away your trophy* after the next league.
---
When can't upvote because it's a 666.
---
&gt; Right, just like someone who starts today (or who started 5 years ago for that matter) can never obtain every piece of 3rd age and every piece of guilded armor.
---
They can. These are tradeable.
---
&gt; Yeah, it was fine. I never even remotely cared about other people having random cosmetics that I didn't have.
---
And that's your opinion. I do care.
---
&gt; You're literally just fearmongering using a slippery slope fallacy.
---
I'm not fear mongering. I believe this could happen. Its my opinion. I'm not using it as a crutch for my argument. I'm saying they are changing this to now be discontinued, despite polling it outright saying the opposite. People are letting them do it. Without massive backlash we would have partnerships in game RIGHT NOW.
---
And the high scores can show that. If you suspect a player won their dragon trophy in an easier league than yours, you could look them up to verify that. You could rest assured that your e-peen is safe another night.
---
They will "take away" your league-to-league title after the next league if you don't earn it again. Why would trophies be given a unique treatment to that? Especially seeing as they are main game untradeable rewards from a non-main game thing.

I can justify smoking weed because I have issues with anxiety and mental health issues, my medication is the best yet but it doesn't always help, weed helps me with that, my budget a month for that is only 20$. I can't justify spending money on video games because there's no reason to. I only play games I bought a long time ago, or f2p games. If I can sustain myself on bonds, no way am I spending money because there's no reason too

Why shouldnt they?  Because everyone else didn't know they would HAVE to play it to get discontinued items (cosmetic or not).

Here's some polls that Jagex should be held accountable to
---
 [http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1524](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1524) 
---
Question 3: untradeable holiday events; 9697 with a strongly/slightly disagree, 23670 with strongly/slightly agree.  If those are no/yes votes then it would fail a poll at 70.9% yes.
---
Question 4: tradeable holiday events;  10285 disagree, 25638 agree; fail@71.4%
---
And of course the throw back to 2013:
---
[http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=568](Would you like tradeable rare items to only be available for a limited period after their introduction?) 85% yes
---
[Would you like tradeable rare items to only be available for a limited period after their introduction?](http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=570) 64% yes
---
Players voted for existing rares to come back, but for nothing to be "rare."  Rare items were specified to be basically holiday items that were "rare" in rs2/rs3 (phats etc) but it is clear 75% of players did not want their to be mega rare cosmetics.  Maybe something has changed now but Jagex ought to poll it rather than just go with twitter responses.
---
You have the same thought process as most, just not represented on reddit very well
---
I, personally, want just one (of each tier) trophy. Maybe with different examine text, or emotes. That way everyone can have the chance to get one eventually, but they are somewhat unique
---
I don‚Äôt think untradeable means the same thing as discontinued

Also, ignoring the venes hurts them long-term.  If left completely unchecked, the venes would crash the RS economy into the same as their own economy.  If they can make $20/hr on runescape, every single vene would be farming gold until they were only making their standard wage/value in venezuela.  They are currently, at a decent pace, doing that to runescape.  Nothing may change for players who dont RWT because the venes occupy every economic niche (farming every tier of items from bow string to TOB).  But for players who either RWT or care about the RL equivalence of their time spent in-game, the venes are decimating them.
---
But it's important to highlight, venes only impact the Rs economy currently because most of them dont actually know how to play.  They're told where and how to farm stuff and that often turns them into bot-like farms nuking zulrah, zulcano, tob, revs, etc.  If they all were experienced players deciding how they wanted to farm gp, there would be a side assortment of players farming tons of different content, buying shit from each other and making the economy work in a natural way.

The osrs community is a LOT of people so it's going to be a widespread group, but this game does have a large number of bigots.  If you go to a populated area you're bound to see some homophobia &amp; transphobia as well as a bunch of women hating incel behavior. 
---
I think it's less an issue with osrs and more an issue with bigoted anonymity on the internet, but it's an issue regardless.

If someone starts talking to you in the wilderness, it‚Äôs to distract you and keep you where you don‚Äôt wanna be
---
there is nobody who loves quest suggestions more than i do. i love reading community input/suggestions on skills, quests &amp; minigames. 
---
but i would call this reddit title not a serious quest suggestion. 
---
You think someone sits at jagex behind their desk browsing reddit and sees this title and thinks: Yes,! this is it! how could we have never come up with this idea ourselves!! Kill king roald and masterquest. got it. going to code it right now!
---
Tomorrows upload:  Grandmaster quest where we cut the hair of hairdresser in falador. okay? yes it's a ''suggestion'' but if you would actually want to see something of your suggestion make it into the game i think you would have to put in a bit more efford than only detailing the difficulty of the quest and which character should be killed.
---
why leave a dislike and not actually answer any questions
---
why does it need to be a grandmaster quest, those have high skill requirements will we need 73 herblore to make a special poison to kill him? 
---
and why does king roald need to be killed?
---
better change all your account info. you got hacked

A league is a limited time side event, that doesn't effect progress on the main game. If you didn't play the league, you don't get the reward. New league comes, new rewards come. They should be unique and untradeable, assuming they serve as nothing other than cosmetics. "But what if a new player wants that item?" Tough titties. Not every item is available to everyone, you gotta play. Serves as motivation to play the next league, get those special rewards. That's just how things work.
---
Signed, someone who doesn't really plan on doing leagues
---
[Yeah, nobody on OSRS is homophobic!](https://i.imgur.com/iTuQQfo.jpg)
---
Name me some examples of tournament/trophies working like that. Do NFL Super Bowl winners have their rings taken away because they didn't win the following Super Bowl? No, because that'd be stupid. WWE champions and MMA fighters can have their belts/titles taken away, but that doesn't invalidate the fact that they HAD THEM at some point. Elementary/middle schools don't take away little league baseball trophies because that school didn't win the following year, because that would be stupid. Did any of the statues near Duel Arena get taken down because the winners didn't win twice in a row? No. Trophies are meant to symbolize an accomplishment.
---
I'm not sure how you came to the conclusion that the League trophies would be taken away, but I strongly urge you to really rethink that way of thinking.
---
Is it a normal thing in your country for your legislative body to determine that your leader has committed crimes that breached his oath of office and warrant removal from power? Because it isn‚Äôt in the US, it is a big deal.
---
Nah, osrs is better than rs3 and we can use bonds just like them. Only whales are giving jagex $11, or worse - the people that buy bonds with real money.
---
I use salad robes since iron, but I'll endorse this statement.
---
&gt; I agree with the decision but it kinda sucks. Being a completionist in OSRS has never been time-limited. You always had the chance to unlock everything, given enough time. I have an 8-5 job and a family to care of. It's not the end of the world - the rewards are cosmetic - but Jagex forced TL on us (and subsequently, forced this decision to be made).
---
I don't think it should be a goal to cater to casuals who "ought to be able to obtain each piece of content" without... You know, sacrificing that casual title
---
There's something to say about players who join later who want to put in the *effort* to obtain every item imagineable, but I do think it's an arbitrary goal.
---
If someone legitimately set out to obtain every item, I don't think anyone would hold it against them to not own these trophies. Hell even the most high held in regard area restricted accounts make loads of caveats and exceptions for their accounts.
---
That's ok. Unless you run a socialist government or a charity you are in the same shitty leaky boat.
---
Training fire making when you can hear planes water bombing fires and see smoke covering the sky is weird as hell.

Twisted league question: whats the aversion to wyrm tasks? Theyre pretty afk solid xp for me (dark alter, douple xp t5, slayer perks) but I see a lot of comments to videos dismissing them.
---
I very much doubt that a gold seller would enter pvp fir any reason, they do tuings their way or don't do them at all
---
So go and get 95 slayer instead of xp wasting on reddit lmao
---
i am working on a new acc to become a slayer (wyvern/gargs/BBD) and rune drags/dolo ALT eventually. Was wondering at what point should I start actually start training slayer? And which slayer master should I start with? Because they say low levels slayer is too slow.
---
And should I just NMZ/ammonite crabs before I start to slay?
---
 Money not much of an issue since I can fund from my main
---
Damn 99 prayer on mobile
---
They have the most oil of any country and still fail. This is due to their government and many other governments pressure on them for said oil. Nobody cares about the people - they just want the oil. No matter how bad someone's situation is, there is always somebody worse off and it's impossible to help everybody. That's why I said the government, that has the biggest scope, has to be the one to fix itself, or get the help from other governments (probably through war).
---
I've only done DT once in osrs and i just ran straight through the temple in a couple of minutes. What's the fuss all about?
---
Wait 99 agility wtf lol I can barely click trees at a steady pace
---
I‚Äôve never quite understood ‚Äúfarming karma‚Äù  on a subreddit with so few people.

One well-placed comment in r/funny would get you 100x the karma that you‚Äôd get for *nailing* a meme.
---
Source!?
---
What's the issue with an untradable cosmetic that's limited like this? I genuinely don't understand.
---
Gotta remember the game was made for DSL and slow internet. It's meant to use little data.
---
Underrated comment
---
Its never re-obtainable. So if you don't play right now, or didnt play leagues (due to not being aware it would become discontinued, as it wasnt polled as that) you're SoL.
---
Also, only 1% of players can get even get the dragon cup. So 99% of players dont get it by design.
---

Lower your FPS to 15 - it helps immensely for mobile battery life and it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll need great quality gameplay while AFK
---
Nice progress buddy, some tough 99s in there!
---
Will post mine
---
No, it still applies. With overloads in hard you are forced to re-overload every 5 minutes, otherwise you'll be beaten to death while you sit at 51+ hp. In normals, you don't *have* to repot immediately, because enemies don't damage you much. Idk why they're using divine combat pots instead of overloads, though. Both are 5 mins of boost and one is essentially free.
---
As someone who would prefer the old school graphics, I would 100% vote yes to a toggle option for HD.

I never said that. You seemed to imply trophies are recalled every year [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ecxbbv/unique_trophies/fbfrwu7/)
---
any point I should do nieve before 77 slayer? Will also to get melees/ranged up or is wildy slayer enough for that?
---
Give coin
---
No different than what my parents do to me every Christmas...
---
I really want to believe this is real, If so if I've ever interacted with anyone currently jailed.
---
&gt; Runescape has always been praised and loved for it being all obtainable if you work for it.
---
Never seen it that way in my life but okay? I get you are allowed to grind anything but imo shit like hiscores or world firsts for completing difficult PvM content seems to go against that idea.
---
Why can't I get woox's inferno cape replica? Wtf jagex?
---
&gt;I think you saying competition is important and good, and that people can "ignore" competition items and instead work on everything but is exactly why hiscores are a good design, and in-game cosmetics that are then unobtainable are not.
---
So this is literally all about having an ingame item reflect something you think hiscores should good enough at doing.
---
These suggestions are getting fucking shitter and shitter, big fan, keep it up
---
Wearing fir is disgusting
---
don't think so, wildy slayer is probably faster than everything except bursting but you won't be able to do much of that anyway
---
not sure about the stats, just getting the slayer lvl should get you to like mid-80s
---
Farming is the one skill I really don‚Äôt know where to begin or what I should be doing. My level is like 20 (my lowest) and I‚Äôm not sure even after watching guides what methods or how the hell im supposed to even get started

cool thx

Damn, can i get that rune limb drop on twisted league lol

the mining/crafting xp is really negligible, unless you're like 200k away from 99 lol

First off, you're either a goddamn liar or incapable of googling. Exactly one Democrat has ever been impeached, and every single person on the goddamn planet knows Clinton's impeachment was a fucking joke. The other three to either succeed or come close - Trump, Johnson, and Nixon - were all Republicans. So get the fuck out of here with your fake facts and thimblebrained attempts at logic.

I treat everyone equally, I don't care if you are black, asian, indian, venezualean, pvmer, clue scroll brainlet who brings his stack of runes into wildy, normal. I will pk everybody, i see or get pked by someone who's better than me.

Awesome! I see you have the demon masks in there now ;) Now get to LMS to get the cabbage halo!

Same here

Q
---
Hearing that brother. Currently 300k from 96 and I'm oooover it. 95-98 is the worst grind for every skill because it's just the same giant grind for seemingly no gain 3 times. We can do it though I'm sure
---
ahahahahaha this is fantastic, favorite RS tat I‚Äôve seen in a long time

i'm gonna vote for him in 2020 tbh

Wait would listening to your advice count as listening to social media and then violate the very thing you're protesting against? Hmm
---
Penetrative vaginal sex is one of the lowest risks for HIV transmission, but still definitely possible. But there's plenty of other nasties that make protection worth it if you're not in a monogamous relationship. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are both capable of being infectious and doing damage while showing no symptoms, and can cause long term health problems, like infertility. With gonorrhea especially, the rates of antibiotic resistance are climbing concerningly high, with only one or two first-line antibiotics still being considered effective, depending on your country. 
---
TLDR: use a condom when you're meeting sexy singles in your area
---
lots zalcano,crystal equipment expansion axe/pick etc theres another thing thats like dungeoneering but i forgot the name
---
Oh fuck off with your drama stirring and fear mongering. It's got fuck all to do with partnerships and the idea that a trophy for being a gamemode "winning" account is tradable or obtainable elsewhere is fucking ludicrous.
---
Awesome. Now some serious competition will begin for the Dragon tier.
---
Can attest to that, it's the app my ex used to successfully cheat on me with after having no luck with grindr.
---
you can spend 20 per acc
---
lmao they made the verdant valley a real thing
---
Because you use normal customizable rumble instead of hard, and use with decent defense. Dropping your hp every 15 min is enough to last 6hrs if you‚Äôre not a pure and using some kind of good defense gear (obsidian works fine for melee). It‚Äôs slower than hard ruble with overloads but you only have to drink a potion and drink more absorbs every 15/20 min
---
Nice gz!! Farming is definitely one of the best skills :)
---
where is the crown from song of the elves?
---
Because it was supposed to make gold farming via emblems non existent while increasing actual Pvp activity, but instead it did the opposite for both.
---
Very informative! I had no idea about any HIV medication besides slowing it down to not turn into aids. Thank you!

I doubt he's looking for partners but other gay people in general, because they share a common ground.

Can someone talented edit this so that when OP changes to the camera app it just shows some weird/stupid shit?

Good job. You can maker money at every level, much better than seeing beggars at GE instead of using their time to make money
---
They're 250M each, we'll be collecting 9 of them :) this isn't a completed list of all items - this is just what I have so far after 5 days of grinding. 
---
Nearing the end of our series we'll see those 9 helms having a happy place in our bank :D
---
Fair enough, I‚Äôve just never in my runescape playing time felt the need to talk to other guys about how much I like pussy lol

Back in the day, if you went to the varrock general store, you'd find all sorts of items chilling in there lol

Because it looks like a ball sack unfurled itself into a Lovecraftian nightmare.

Yes I understand they‚Äôre wildly over the top
---
wanting to just do the iron thats why i wanted to sink all the normal acc gp
---
Steel titan was insane, like having a second claw spec, iron titan was ok because it was 3 hits instead of 4, and the other titans were mostly just used for training summoning but were still okay/good in their own right. Like the level 79 titans healed you I think? Which was nice for noob me who couldn't get 88 summoning for unicorn.
---
Unicorn was probably the most useful non-BoB/steel titan familiar, skilling familiars were used, terrorbird was used for run energy (not just BoB), bunyip was used for slayer, some of the lower level titans could be used for combat, and iirc minotaurs were only really used by summoning tanks in pvp until they got iron titan.
---
Yea I vaguely remember this. Forgot it was the general store I guess
---
That's not true, there's just as many bottoms.
---
had that argument with my irl friend, granted i pay $5 a month still so in essence it takes me 10 minutes of work (okay maybe 12-13 if you count taxes) to pay for 1 month of membership.  not bad at all for osrs.
---
Still possible, just not nearly as likely anymore.  Only things and the general store are mass amounts from some iron or bank cleanings.

Grindr and A Grinder
---
I can get to the log in screen then get a "login failed" message.

Normally it's something like error connecting to server or whatever. Never seen this one before.
---
Are you getting the same issue?
---
This collection is heading the right way.
---
Hats off to you
---
Honestly one of my absolute favourite pets available in the game. I was beginning to believe I just wasn't going to get it, sure am glad that isn't the case!

Win+Shift+S is the new snipping tool.

Thank you so much :D
---
It's really a captivating project.
---
Regardless of your sexual preference, I would STRONGLY recommend using protection for randos or any non mutually exclusive relationship. HIV is more of a gay disease and u=u/modern science is pretty fucking nice but downplaying risks of stds is not a good idea. Even the easily curable ones are not something you wanna mess with. 
---
Here‚Äôs an anecdote that made me grow the fuck up real fast. I hooked up with a friend who I knew was pretty sexually active but got tested monthly and who I thought was always careful. She was on the pill so that risk is not a factor. All is good and well and a few weeks after our unprotected encounter she calls me cause her monthly test came out positive for chlamydia. Let me tell you that it is not a fun thing to hear. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt catch it but my head made my dick itch from the day that she called until the tests results came back. Bareback feels so much better and I totally get why you prefer it that way, hell who doesn‚Äôt but the risk isn‚Äôt worth it and although I didn‚Äôt get it, the hassle of making an appointment to get tested, the paranoia that I might have something, the stress that comes with it is not fucking worth it. 
---
That being said you‚Äôre an adult I assume and you do you for your own life, I learned through my mistakes, you might do the same some day (hopefully you never get that scare). I still suggest to be safe and wear protection unless you‚Äôre in a stable relationship.
---
You thought wrong.
---
I have the same issue was fine 30 mins ago
---
Why does being gay have to mean they're like-minded? It's not a personality (though some people insist in making it one).
---
It's profitable, but there are far faster and more efficient ways of earning GP. I set out with the goal of crafting my way to a green stack of Death Runes. I love Runecrafting and wouldn't mind taking the skill to 200m. Of course, Death Runes aren't the fastest way to take you there, but I set myself a goal and I intend to complete it. 10m Death Runes.
---
Really happy for you.
---
Big OOF on my part there, lol.
---
I kind of thought that might be the case after I posted that. I bet it‚Äôs a fun quest !
---
How is it tough being trans and playing runescape? You have normal hands like the rest of us...

The real treasure was the Death Runes we made along the way...

Just happend to me when i tried hopping worlds to 330 i thought it was world 330 down at first but its every server for me. On on mobile aswell, damn it jamflex, i just wanted to finish my task at 6:30 in the morning :(
---
Gl on the 2500 BH kills

Bh1 didn't work, let's build a second one to negate the failure, create an even bigger mess. Well ppl don't say bh1 failed so half the task completed. ü§îüòä

Maybe they are working on the ‚Äúlink-email‚Äù button that wasnt available in-game..?

I hope so!

You can log in now

It works well with ipads

I remember a similar glitch
---
I'm not sure what the issue is. Someone else said servers were "down". But last time it was a DDos attack. Maybe now as well?
---
You must be a mod
---
We'll need a place to talk in real-time like Discord then to sync up. They can only be given in game.
---
:(
---
Thanks, and all fair points.  I agree with a lot or even all of that, but I suppose I've more just accepted that's how osrs is, where jmods aren't the best design/balance team when it comes to new content
---
Pvp bad

Go to edgeville dungeon and kill the muggers in the wilderness area for an easy bag

Is it elfs or elves?

I ain't got any

I'm just really happy to be in a OSRS comment section and watching a Kimchi clip, that's like two best worlds colliding.
---
Don't get washed

imagine being this insecure, kek
---
Support 50k+ gp is fair I think

Nope from my own experience each time I tried to have a casual conversation about pvp on reddit I would end up with 20 downvotes.

That might be the easiest gold someone has ever got

I really am just looking for eclectic implying for medium clues. I just keep missing them I wanted to now if there was a certain hunter level I would not miss them at
---
Or make em stackable atleast so you can grind for a few looting bags in wildy
---
I'm a main account :) I'd be very impressed to see the challenge completed on an iron - though that wouldn't be for me. We're about 120 hats/hoods/etc away from completion - max cape hoods, infernal cape max hood, qpc, achievement, 9 250M elven crowns, etc. So there's tons of room to continue!
---
It‚Äôs not, irons can‚Äôt upgrade emblems
---
Support, but only if it overrides any sound settings and blasts it at full volume
---
How did you calculate the division part?
---
Thank you I thought that was the joke at first glance.
---
I don‚Äôt get why they put tldr at the BOTTOM of the text.. what a scam
---
I think the is a viable idea, but I also see people doing the first few easy bosses then quitting the raid to farm items.
---
Except he didn't bash the Jmods (unless there is more not in OP's picture), asking if the team is aware of it and if it will take two years like the first rework did is a perfectly fine line of logic. You don't need to write an essay and eloquently point out everything to make a point or pose a question. 
---
Also you can't be serious with saying "made up echo chamber"  Reddit is a prime example of echo chambers, try to say anything about PvP in this sub and you'll be down voted to oblivion regardless of how well thought out your idea is.
---
You put some dirt in her eye!
---
Hey!
---
My bank account was empty, so I cleaned out my RS bank to buy a bond (people commented on the 77 fletching, it was a good thing I've done it now though :P)
---
So yeah, I don't need a bond since I've got membership anyway, but obviously I can't really refuse a free one. In any case, add Hmmsterrr ingame if you wanna play/chat (keep in mind I'll probably annoy you with questions about the game though, haha).
---
That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre suppose to put the tldr...
---
Which is an off-hand apparently
---
Apologies, saw it on other social media
---
Great. Next time just spend $0.50 and save yourself a headache. Come @ me Reddit
---
HOL UP

good shit man, i'm definitely an angry poster, ya got me

just take it as if u cant access the game without mobile dont play it #antimobileosrs
---
Are you going to get the twisted league slayer helm recolor?
---
Congrats dude, do you already know what you're going to do with it?
---
Just gonna hijack top comment to remind everyone untradeable trophies already passed a poll on twisted league rewards. Here is the wording:
---
Should the Twisted League offer cosmetic Twisted League trophy rewards as described in the blog? This trophy will represent the tier you place in and will be untradeable.
---
Just play Rs3
---
Ok
---
He wasn‚Äôt complaining tho
---
Yep
---
Tried the Twisted LEague rewards thread without any answers..  
---
Anyone have an idea with the armors, do i need to buy t1-&gt;t2-&gt;t3 or can i buy t3 straightaway?
---
It sounds like you have multimedia keys.
---
You can usually reverse that in your laptops bios settings.
---
Alternatively if you‚Äôre using runelite you can use 1,2,3,4,5 keys instead of your f keys
---
##lol
---
I get they dont want to make it dailyscape or weeklyscape, but these were actually fun
---
I wish I never got the mobile app to be honest because of all this.
---
think u still miss them at 99 but i think by the next impling lvl seems to be ok
---
He has a UofA app so I'd say somewhere around Tucson most likely.
---
You talk like you take ambulances frequently. So even if the impeachment worked you still wouldn‚Äôt be happy with the quality of your job? That sounds like a you problem. Find a new job.
---
hope ur an ironman coz d imps would help u anyway with glory and co
---
Well there are already some daily/weekly content ingame. Do you know if it was polled?
---
22/M/WA also looking for coins. Are you my brother?
---
They have been in the game for many, many years as well. They're pretty unknown. They're heraldic helms painted in your construction house, with dofferent family crests given by Sir Renitee in Falador. But almost no one bothers woth them because your family crest doesn't matter at all for literally anything in the game :D
---
Anglers isn't worth the time it takes just for the xp boost (unless you're going for post 99 xp)
---
But it is required for a master clue step
---
&gt;Following your feedback, we've decided to keep trophies unique 
---
unless you can show otherwise this seems to imply they were going to be unique from the start. The initial blog for Twisted League also listed the trophys as "unique rewards"
---
Keep up the grind my friend
---
I mean, my personal feeling is if people were just planning to not play in the league at all and use main game wealth to obtain all of the rewards anyway than it's good the people who tried the hardest and farmed it have something they can show off without pressure to sell it.
---
Ah that's hot
---
Can I add you to play some TF2?
---
Put in the time, get the reward = not a hard concept. 
---
Think of it this way, if you were at an esports tournament for two months and they gave the rewards that were based on progress, would you boycott from you computer chair that it wasn‚Äôt fair? Go play flag football at your local Y if you want a trophy.

As long as those items are completely cosmetic, do not alter gameplay in any way, or are untradable, there really isn't an issue, aside from the principle of the thing.
---
Haha I'm 100% sure I'm straight, not even bi. Although, it always sounds like this whole dating thing would be way easier between gays, so I wish I was gay in that regard. Obviously there are other disadvantages you guys have to deal with.

My point is the poll said both and this only really effects probably .01% of people going for full completion (which is physically impossible anyway) and count a unique trophy as part of completion for some reason
---
Also having a good spec weapon like g maul helps/claws boost up ur xp a bit if you use it while having the unlimited spec power surge. Also use the xp boosting monsters, except for ‚Äúdad‚Äù since he has a knockback.

What you really seem to be saying is that they should "stop acting so gay" because it makes you uncomfortable. Why not just let them be?

Same. Give me coins plz.

Yeah, I was going to say the fishing bot definitely reminded me of carbot, but the bronze player didn't. I think it's the purple full helm"hair"

how much nmz pts did u get for that lvl
---
Nice. How long have you been working on your collection?
---
Yeah I just massively disagree. The game mode was super competitive. Casual players already dont care about full completion of the game as it's not even close to obtainable by them. I think the amount of people that will be upset because they cant obtain the items is much lower than you're acting like it will be
---
5 days :)
---
Fact that you couldn't come up with the video and that you downvoted my comment only further confirms that you're just a lying piece of crap.
---
The poll also stated it would be a unique untradable item
---
No way I have passed it. Thanks a lot!!!

It requires exactly as much attention as on a pc.

I've seen this suggested since 15 years ago. It blows my mind they still haven't added it, seeing as most skillcape NPCs have attached good models.
---
Clearly I am talking about the locking world not about Venezuelans. And I am talking about checking not detecting. It takes time to check if it is a bot after detecting they are not using official clients or runelite or osb. And the processing time make them destroying the experience of other players and also they can trade the resources to other acc. I am not talking about rwt..... I am talking about it can reduce bots only

Don‚Äôt know tbh, if you 1 tick definitely, but I was hitting 100k/hr easily and wasn‚Äôt even 1 ticking with diamond and ruby.  Depending on the bolts and the market, I was also profiting about 100k-2mgp each buyout of 11k.  Usually was around 500k profit in under an hour.

 When playing mobile, just keep in mind, that it's easier to die (in most cases at least) and dying can be more risky because of unreliable mobile network depending on the region you live in.

Pros: Provides players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different trophies.
---
Cons: Engine work, pushing back the release of group ironmen.
---
What do you think is the Player-to-JMod ratio? Also how many player accounts do you think a JMod can manually review in 8hrs? 
---
Find those numbers and go pay Jagex however millions of dollars it would cost to hire that many employees to manually review every account.
---
I'm not winning anything, and I couldn't less if the top 1% get some kind of reward or recognition for their achievement.
---
Thats what an untradeable but not discontinued trophy is.  Thats what a highscores page or ingame monument is.  Thats what a plaque in your house is.
---
What I care about is a discontinued, unobtainable set of items being added to the game. Which is something historically the dev team and community have been fundamentally opposed to.
---
Even worse, it isn't "everyone who gets 20k pts gets highest tier trophy", its top 1%, so the only people who realistically have any chance of getting it are people capable of literally no lifing the game, especially after this announcement.  So streamers, youtubers, people without a full time job/families/classload get a nice trophy and everyone else gets boned.
---
Only people who work hard for it get it? Sure, let them flex now. Then halfway through next year people who had too much work/classes/wanted to do something else in game can grind it out and flex once they do it. Oh wait, we're announcing halfway through that if you werent already no lifing the game mode, you're boned.
---
And sense of accomplishment?  Its a game mode completely separate from the main game and already gives tradeable rewards the top 1% get the most benefit from, why do they also need a discontinued item?
---
And isnt this the same group that flamed the crap out of AutumnElegy and others over "zeah rc devalues my rc cape", "fast afk methods devalue my 200m" "3m/hr profitsnake devalues my 91 rc/alt scape"?  Really? Devalues the achievement?
---
Bump
---
Also the music, quest and achievement capes. And all the max cape variants
---
Nah, it would basically just be a private server that would die very quickly.
---
The whole point of the leagues is to see what can be achieved in a short time. If you missed out, that's unfortunate but it's not like it wasn't heavily advertised/announced. This is going full circle with the caveat of increased XP rates which is a big no-no. 
---
If you want the twisted league experience, play the regular game as an iron man locked in Zeah.
---
Would be dope if there was a league where players could choose to main in only one type of combat skill (mage, range, melee) and they would be able to dual wield any weapons of that skill. Aka, range would be able to dual wield two crossbows, melee two scims, etc.

---
Music also generally uses much more bandwidth than games.
---
For OSRS and most games, music is pre-downloaded when you update the game, so it doesn't use bandwidth while playing afterwards. On top of that, for OSRS, their music is very lightweight because they're not normal full audio files, they are just MIDI files (sequences of notes, like if you saved music sheets digitally) combined with a few sound samples that are used repeatedly with varying volumes and pitch.
---
Actual audio streaming, from something like spotify, apple music, or a video's audio, is relatively taxing, more than games but usually less than video unless the video is extremely compressed. Depending on the quality, either one can use more data than the other. The data used highly depends on the quality/bitrate of music streamed, same as videos. Most free services stream mp3 files at a bitrate of 128kbps, sometimes 320kbps for higher quality (e.g spotify premium). This dictates the amount of bandwidth used per second in the audio file, so at lower quality the least noticeable frequencies are excluded to save space. And then there is the sampling frequency, practically always 44.1khz unless in a high level professional environment. This means that there is some kind of encoded soundwave state 44,100 times per second. I'm not that familiar with how exactly soundwaves are saved, but I know 41,000 states per second is a lot of data that adds up. It's pretty efficient for what it is, though.

&gt;Yeah sure lad, your statement that I‚Äôm totally just mad because I want people to report Venezuelans isn‚Äôt a strawman and is an accurate rendition of my point.
---
It was an appropriate question. At that point, I was unsure whether you were being satirical or legitimately acting that way. It was a fair question to ask and didn't mischaracterize your comments.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs why when I‚Äôll ask you to find me where I‚Äôve said ‚Äúplease report Venuzuelans‚Äù you‚Äôll totally oblige and not suddenly go silent or go for some more ad homs.
---
Whether you said the words "please report Venuzuelans" doesn't invalidate my point.
---
&gt;Fuck outta here, you‚Äôre outta your depth lad
---
This thing you do where you try and repeat what the person says back at them is an incredibly poor and transparent attempt at a deflection.
---
If you think repeatedly doing that makes you're arguments more convincing, you're mistaken.
---
If you win a gold medal at the olympics, you've won a gold medal at the olympics.
---
It doesn't matter if you did it in the 100m sprint or in some weird event like dressage, you still have a gold medal the same as every other medalist.
---
No matter the league, getting a dragon trophy will still be just as big an achievement since it's only the top 1%. If a league is easier, more people will play, and the brackets will be higher.

For the later game grind, I recommend Burning Amulets. They sell well and consistently. Unfortunately you end up hating the place if you are smelting silver, then to Amulets (u) then another set period of time stringing them before enchanting them. Good profit (about half a year ago) though.

That's exactly it. We're all upset that we're never going to be able to attain this item. Part of why OSRS is the only game I play is because completion of it feels good. If this passes, I can never complete the game, ever.

Funny thing is I bet you weren't born before 1981 and are a millenial yourself.

They didn't, they introduced untrables only obtainable from a limited time event and it passed the poll.

I think it's more so that you don't feel the pressure of it being your first win, and even if you lose you already have your fire cape

That's alright, if your dignity is only worth a few GP you just keep on doing it that way.

Wow, terrific!!! Thanks, I do like interesting headgear too.

There is one I could not recognize. Can you please tell me what it is? 5th row from below, the brown one between Beanie and Bobble hat.

In the meantime a friend visited me with the 15 minutes he had left and got THREE dragon defenders.

If I remember right it‚Äôs 2 DWH specs, 10 arclight specs and 200 BGS damage. I wouldn‚Äôt bother without the DWH and arclight. You don‚Äôt need a cannon to keep him engaged or anything, it just does damage and helps with the core. You use both specs and tele, rinse and repeat.

please can we have this just let me have this please

Hey come to w2 ge I have a nature rune and 5 fire runes for you

Most of his posts are reposts.

I usually give them a short term goal.
---
Like "let's make a new f2p account together, treat it like group ironman, and see if we can beat dragon slayer. We'll have to get through a couple quests, but all the levels we need are super easy to get so there isn't much grinding at all. The fun part will be trying to get the gear we need to take on Evlarg. Like we'll need food so one of us could learn to cook while the other learns to fish. We might need to craft some armour one of us could mine while the other smiths." Etc.
---
Generally that has worked for me to at least get them playing, even if they give up before beating dragon slayer. Gives them the idea of direct team work to take down a cool boss without much grinding and an idea of co-op.
---
If they like the gameplay, then since you did a fake-gtoup ironman, theycan still just "discover" the GE whenever they want and do whatever with the character as their main.

With that amount of cash, you want to flip items with a very low trade limit, or a low trade volume. Cheap treasure trail items can work as low volume for slow flips. For more active ones, cheap supplies can work. Also cheap items you get as loot from PvM.

Too bad you can't keep all diary tiers. I assume you would just go for elite?

Probably just inefficient. I do Konar, and a lot of the tasks are single combat areas, thats why i run melee. When i can barrage i do (just 88 magic tho)

It is intentional. The .exe will run the version of Java that is included in the installer and use that to run the .jar in the same directory. If you just run the jar directly it will use your system Java.

It's actually the shirt that's the issue.  A white shirt would look a ton better here.
---
If you're afk training on the side, then you get even less efficient training and it takes even longer. 
---
According to dps calc at sand crabs 60 range from 50 on low to average (not transferring dozens of mills over) gear takes ~6 hours, then ~13 to 70 paying 100% full attention with no downtime. So not counting 1-50 it still takes 19 hours at maximum efficiency. Yes sand crabs are somewhat afk but if you're afking them you won't get that 100%. You aren't going to get 20+ hours of relatively high efficiency playtime in two days unless you're super sweaty about it, like I mentioned above. 
---
For questing yeah it may not take too many hours to do the quests themselves, but you have to get requirements which takes a while and then do the quests which to some is annoying and either way is still time consuming. And getting 90 str and veng isn't something you can just afk real quick. Afk mage training is really slow or really expensive. 
---
So the best current build requires 50m right off the bat for prayer alone. Then all the leveling questing mini games etc. 
---
Tldr making another account from scratch and pouring dozens of hours and mills to do one activity is dumb and not worth a lot of players' time
---
Obviously not, or they wouldn't have posted the follow-up about what to do with trophies.
---
I can't read that justgirlythings template without thinking of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sdtFJvDsuE&amp;t=1m17s)

Yes, you are right. I read the blog again and it makes it feel like the trophies would be available somehow later. For some reason when I read it for the first time I understood that they would be discontinued, that's why I voted no and was confused why there was not more noise about it.

what loyalthy? i quit during 2009 becuse of eoc and grand exchange and i would do it again!

Pretty sure there's an npc that will collect any items you drop if you die in the boss fight. You just have to pay them (I think it's 75k) and you don't lose anything.

Solo Corp is extremely tedious, it‚Äôs 2-3 DWH specs, 20 arc light HITS (not 0s), then 200 BGS damage. The payout is huge if you get one, but it is very very boring in my opinion.

The alien is an old and extremely short lived meme. You didn't make it.

They're both there, take a close look at the rows below :)

I bet you would know how to feel if they decided your dragon trophy should be tradable and available to everyone. You‚Äôve put in hundreds of hours in just two months; you deserve a unique reward.
---
You wear it, I've worn it on stream before :)
---
It's not about making it tradable. It's about making the trophies season specific, and thus discontinued. They explicitly said the trophies would not be discontinued, and now they're going back on that.

It's on the list :)

1:1 actions are fine. You're allowed to rebind your f1 key to k if your f1 key is broken, because that would mean you're pressing one button to do one function. Macros that do multiple actions at once aren't allowed (AHKs that used to drop inventories by clicking 2 buttons arent allowed)
---
The trophies displaying your rank were polled as not to be discontinued, but now they are being made season specific (and therefore discontinued) without poll.
---
They are just saying

1) being trans is hard, it is. Regardless of what you think about trans people it is exhausting to hear the validity of your transness debated by every boring man on the internet
---
2) it is unusual to find another trans person playing OSRS, because it is. 
---
They aren‚Äôt saying it makes the game harder, it‚Äôs kind of sad that I had to walk you through that. Or were you just commenting in bad faith?
---
553 atm :) I'm happy someone else is on the hat grind too :D
---
On the list :)
---
are you going to have enough bank space at the end of this?
---
Thank god. My motivation to finish TL and play future leagues would have been completely killed if the trophy wasn't going to be unique and if any schmuck could obtain the trophy later.

Thank you :D

They do check character, but as rhysdog said, it only does the check when it's opened, not for every roll. The game rolled gloves and saw OP only had 1, for all 3 rolls.

How were you planning on getting the "Twisted" League trophy in the future? There will obviously be more trophies in the future, but you will not be able to get the "Twisted" ones if you didn't place in the Twisted one. The trophy for this league being  discontinued was implied and fairly obvious when it was polled.

Yes, but it costs way more than you're willing to pay. Pretty sure it's like 150m/week at revs? And nobody is gonna run around to wherever you are doing slayer and protect you lol. The answer is just to get better at avoiding people or PK them back

Because i will permanently unlock a silver trophy that i will never be able to upgrade, essentially ruining my completionist account.
---
Likely more than you, but less than I could.  Not enough to try and virtue signal on reddit about how you shouldn't report/pk Venus.  Which is why I don't.
---
DS2 was a lot more fun that MM2. Kruk's dungeon and the platform can fuck right off.
---
if you're not foot braking you better hope you can [slide stop](https://youtu.be/l3EyJPm2E6s?t=241)
---
You would unlock the "Blood" League trophy of whatever tier you placed. You would not unlock the "Twisted" League trophies because it's not the Twisted League anymore.
---
Sure collecting "every" item is impossible but any given item you want to go for is doable in OSRS since until now there were no "discontinued" items.
---
Name checks out.
---
Runelite helps a lot with alch. I found a busy world and followed around someone that was using runelite
---
He's in the wrong line of business, building demolition would have been better.
---
But I understand, that experience in the caves broke him down..
---
Its perfectly possible to get more than 3 of the items.
---
Simply own a maximum of 2 of said items then receive two ore more of said item with some rng.
---
Its not really that elaborate tbh. Saw a guy with 5 bruma torches post on here about a month ago.
---
If your new to pking you don't want to start out as a pure. Chugging potions every second while attacking your opponent back is quite an advanced method.
---
I honestly think sailing would be great, it has a ton of potential as a concept, I think the biggest issue with it is that it does not need to be a skill, but could easily be a minigame. Id he happy with it as a skill. 
---
That being said, I dont think any skill will ever get 75% in a poll, even if 75% of the playerbase want a new skill, they dont all want the same one.
---
I've never had any need to relate to someone based on my sexuality. I've rarely ever talked about that stuff with my friends. Actually, my main friends consist of two men and a potentially (she's still figuring it out) bi asexual woman. So no one I can relate to there. It's like the least important part of a friendship. 
---
I think I'm more talking about gay people who only have gay friends and make that their defining personality trait, not just gay people who happen to be friends because they could relate over shared experiences. Because there are definitely obnoxious people who will take every opportunity to demonstrate how special and different and positively rainbow spangled they are. I don't even mind that so much. 
---
It's the people who over the top morally police others, the whole cancel culture and bigotry of it. People who make it their life and politics to be gay, and whoever falls outside of what they think is labelled the correct opinion or who says something not exactly in line is labelled a homophobe or whatever else label you want to slap on. Even questioning it is considered an excuse for homophobia by some, even if you encourage people to live their life the way they want, just disagree with some things surrounding it like I've written out.
---
Anyway, I'm ranting.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ you are going to wreck jads asshole next time. Btw slayer helm works on all npcs in the cave not just jad
---
As far as I am aware, the trophies won't be in the collection log?
---
I don't understand how that would ruin your completionist account...
---
Finally my dopamine rush
---
HER SISTER WAS THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST BRO!
---
Other side of the coin completely
---
I don't really play osrs anymore but completing DS2 will always be one of my favorite gaming achievements. It was just such a good quest mechanically and thematically.
---
Been going on for years big man.
---
The Wicked Witch of the east was a bad realtor, convince me otherwise.
---
Sailing was an April fools joke you buffoon.
---
Karil's coif looks cool
---
Either you type like a 12 year old or you're actually 12

If you‚Äôre happy then I guess it‚Äôs all that matters
---
Okay cool thanks!
---
Thanks!
---
They said the rewards from the Leagues shop wouldn‚Äôt be discontinued. It‚Äôs literally just the trophy for which rank you end in. Cry more bussy

I wonder is there actually enough bank space slots for all the hats in the game?
---
Also I'm sorry if I assumed you're LGBT if you're not. But I mean... why *would* a straight person need to have friends with the same sexuality? I don't mean to be insensitive, but I assume the vast majority of straight people have figures in their life with the same sexuality, be it your parents, other family members, your teachers, your local politicians, the heterosexual couple standing behind you in line at the grocery store, other kids in high school in open heterosexual relationships, Disney movies where the prince finds his princess, literally any other movie or TV show that depicts a relationship or has a character that offhandedly mentions their partner of the opposite sex,  etc.
---
There's significantly less representation for LGBT people both in media and in real life. And of course that's how it is; there's a significantly smaller proportion of society that aren't cis or straight, so it'd be preposterous to ask for equal representation (yes, I know some people *do* ask for this, and yes, I'll agree that this is ridiculous). But because we don't see the same kind of representation, it can be important to have friends who are also in an underrepresented sexuality, to help normalize that experience and feel more validated. It's completely normal for underrepresented people to form small groups to relate to each other. This is *why* we don't need equal representation in the media; it's because we've filled that void with each other's presence and experiences. If anything, it keeps all that gayness within the group, so people outside of that group don't have to endure it as much. Surely that isn't a bad thing?
---
I can't really speak for other forms of being underrepresented, being race/ethnicity or religion. But I can assume that many people in a minority ethnicity have other family members or maybe neighbors of the same ethnic group that they can relate to from a young age. Religions typically have congregations where you can be around other people in that religion. Being LGBT (or having a disability, I'm sure there's some other underrepresented groups I'm forgetting) have the unique aspect of being scattered in society. There often isn't a natural grouping early in life where you grew up around similar people. Sometimes you need that friend group to make up for that.
---
I 100% agree with you that discontinued holiday items in RS3 are a shame, because you shouldn‚Äôt be punished for not playing the game during those times. However, those items are not granted to players based on their sole ACHIEVEMENTS and PERFORMANCE during those events and are more of a ‚Äúgo through the motions of the mini-quest‚Äù situation, which anyone can do. 
---
The nature of a TIMED COMPETITION means that it must end at some point, and at that point the rewards are given out based on the performance of each competitor. 
---
One could equate Jagex making it so you can obtain previous trophies from future TL events to the Olympics giving previous Olympic medals to the current winning athletes. You should get the reward that represents your achievements during the competition that you participated in, not previous competitions. 
---
Also, I see people saying that Jagex should just make every TL trophy the same aesthetically, so that you can still get the same trophy as everyone else at a later time, but I would expect people to be way less inclined to participate in future TL events after they get their first dragon tier trophy, causing future TL events to have less and less competition and participation in general, decreasing the sentimental value of trophy itself.
---
rekt
---
Damn you've been putting in big hours, gz
---
I don't understand why leagues have to have a 1 and done mentality attached to them by Jagex. 
---
Why not just pick 4 regions and those are your 4 different leagues. Every quarter or bi-annually run a different league. Seems like a pretty straight forward solution to prevent trophies from becoming discontinued. 
---
Gives people one chance a year or every other year if bi-annual to get the unique league trophies and still keeps them rare and competitive. 
---
People will still want to do the leagues since everytime a league runs new tradeable rewards will be introduced as incentive alongside the unique league specific trophy.
---
When I do a skill like this I usually bind it to a mouse button and an additional key to alternate holding.
---
How much is this tab worth?
---
A lot of places have instance warnings, and even skotizo you can literally just pray mage and you're fine. I was just saying it had no indication that it was so dangerous, it just said it was an instance
---
Just relog
---
That guy is doing a very poor job of explaining it, all he had to say was there are buy limits in place that would prevent someone from making an offer big enough
---
Not necessarily. You're forgetting the fact there's a way bigger demand for tbows, rather than the Sycthe. Ranged is the most used PVM skill, therefore the tbow is BIS in most PVMs. The Scythe however, isn't the strongest STAB weapon, which is used in some PVMing bosses/monsters. Therefore, the tbow has a higher demand, which is obvious by the small price drop. The scythe has a lower demand, but increasing supply, which makes sense for the 1B drop.
---
so
---
You only logged out every 6 hours cause the game made you. Nice.
---
Can someone explain the spider human to me? I understand the 92-99, but spider humans?

Yes they are :D but they hella expensive too
---
That's what I was trying to get at, lol. Like c'mon guys, be adults, do work at work,play at home, etc. I know not every job is extremely demanding but it's still inappropriate unless explicitly excused otherwise...
---
That doesn't seem appealing to me but I've visited San Fran so it makes sense.
---
Agreed. The best is when you‚Äôre finally done skilling and you can get all the completionist things done.
---
Did you miss the pun or something lmao
---
So are we posting images of regular loot now?
---
What?
---
Its that I don‚Äôt have balls.
---
For those who don't know, this is a cool little reference to [The Dark Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal:_Age_of_Resistance)  :)
---
You will be unable to get a Twisted League\* trophy. Future Leagues will have their own trophies. If you want a trophy then go compete. If you don't then why would you care either way?
---
Why lol? House pool? Do you go to the bank and eat prayer pots and sharks to restore your prayer and hp?
---
Holy wrench is debatable but in this case it is useful to bring, 1 because of how demonics work, you'll never leave with a full inventory of loot, you will always consume more spots than you fill. And 2, the food to prayer ratio. If you bring more than a few pots you won't be using all of them before you run out of food. Likewise with food, you won't be using it all before you run out of pots. So there is basically no reason not to bring the wrench in this instance. If you're doubting any of this, [the wiki has the math.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Holy_wrench#References)
---
PHREE STUPH PLOXXE
---
But, should we revolve this game mode's motive around your goal? This would be one of the first nonobtainable items true, but something damn near the same will be avaliable whenever a new league comes out. I want to obtain cups from all the leagues and have a reason to go after the next one. If I have 4 dragon trophies no ones gonna know. And I want them to know.

Coif is quaff in hair dressing related terms. Koif is the correct way to say it.

Pretty wholesome guy from reading the chat, what a good sport.
---
Well put them on then...
---
I know someone that works for Coca-Cola and they wear a red shirt every single day to work. A lot of people that work in the shipping industry wear red shirts. I think that the osrs community just has a very narrow slice of personalities and thus jobs that are attracted to that attributes to the fact that no one has seen redshirts on a job before. It is way more common than people seem to know.
---
Lmao what the fuck
---
Some guy said it‚Äôs pronounced quaff in another thread.
---
Zeah favour can suck a floppy one.
---
Gamesounds: not even once.
---
Personally I'm not a big fan of the fact that you lose everything in instances. It feels like it initially came into the game accidentally because of the way instances work in the game code, but now they are trying to integrate it as an actual game mechanic. On the other hand I also don't like how there is next to no punishment for dying outside of an instance. It just makes no sense that you either lose nothing or everything depending on how the area you are standing in is coded. The solution in my opinion is to put rs3's death system into osrs, where you always have to pay a fee (similar to dying at vorkath) to get your stuff back, regardless of whether you were in an instance or not.
---
Yeah but as another comment here said. ‚ÄúAtleast they have a helpline‚Äù
---
70 and counting here
---
I feel like it heavily scales with fishing level, I went in with 90 fishing I believe and was done in 10 games or so. Really nice when I was expecting to be there forever.
---
This is really cool btw, kinda burn't on the game rn so all I do is flip and occasionally leagues. Might learn coding from this, but I see some inherent limitations. Fun though!
---
Reminder
---
90 herb unless someone else has it, 85+ combat stats or you will be ass
---
it‚Äôs really not that hard just learn the mechanics and you‚Äôll get used to it easily
---
I wish we had room in the bank to store more items. Collections like this are awesome amazing job!!
---
They said there would be no discontinued items added because of leagues and the trophies they showed did not have a twisted league logo, only a simple RS. I thought it was obvious from the start that it wouldn't be unique and discontinued because why would it be there's no reason for them to be because leagues are fun and people are going to play them regardless
---
It would be pretty cool. Have certain vines than can be built and climbed based on your agility level also for certain flex. 
---
Neat idea though, adds some more flavor to POH, doesnt hurt or effect anything/anyone. 
---
Has my support!
---
Ge is very predictable.

The stock market is not.

Didn't happen to the Tbow and its not why the Scythe is falling in price
---
Bruh. It's blue. It tastes like blue. You didn't learn this as a kid?
---
Oh yeah that sounds right! They've always been ahead of the curve
---
Read my other comment...
---
Dragonstone bolts (e) are the highest damage bolts in the game aside from Ruby (e) on certain targets, and only early in the kill, then swapping to dragonstone is the optimal ammo. Best range ammo/weapon for anyone who‚Äôs yet to get a lucky blowpipe or twisted bow.
---
You understand it :) unlike sassy
---
What a whale
---
I actually want to make a f2p pking build sorta to do high risk gilded fights. Tbh when i used to play from 01-07 before I started a year ago in osrs I was strictly a PvP player. I just dont like the current "1 tick 150 dmg stack" meta to get kills now. But i do miss pking, and i used to love pking f2p doing full sara/zammy no armor risk fights when they were worth several mil. 
---
Question would be what stats to go for. Usually just pked on my main in f2p
---
It is red but that vibrant of a color in a professional setting is a bit odd lol. I was not meaning to be offensive. Also the tie.....
---
Before the GE it was common to camp the varrok and other general stores as people sold tons of stuff to them to avoid the hassle of trying to find a player to buy it. A whip is someone having fun but you could find tons of useful stuff in them but you had to be quick cuz if you wanted it likely someone else camping wanted it too.
---
It probably uses the pet rock model
---
If the wilderness were actually for pking then sure. Unfortunately that isn't how OSRS works and all they do is pack bossing and skilling in so that those people participate in it as well. Since they're participating their votes should count. Also in the future if Jagex could remove their heads from their collective asses and put skilling and PvM somewhere other than in PvP enabled areas we could maybe get some PvP focused updates that are only polled to people who wanted to PvP.
---
I usually put everything on value checking interface and it organise automatically, but yeah some times I organise it myself.
---
Never even thought of doing that!
---
I think point calculation may take a bit to get accurate sometimes.
---
I've had the reverse happen, where the points I earned weren't applied until I logged out. So I got 100 points but the total didn't update, but when I logged out and switched to a normal world it showed the correct amount. 
---
  
---
Looking at the hi scores, I've seen people with only 10 points that have multiple 20's and 40's. 
---
Maybe you got a pet right before you logged out?
---
Wait what? Unless im mistaken dhcb is still the fastest kills over bgs/bp method.
---
If this were a painting, it would probably auction for more than that banana duct taped on the wall.
---
I used to pk zerks and range tanks on RS2 on my 58 def main while wearing rune gloves lol. What are your other stats? If you're gonna pk, you should skew your stats towards a pking build. You also need a good knowledge of pking mechanics/gear if you're going to make an unorthodox pking build work.
---
Dont blur it out I need to know if it's my account
---
With that logic then it wouldn‚Äôt matter if they said it was tradeable because it‚Äôs a limited time event i.e. it would just be a tradeable discontinued item. 
---
Again, untradeable ‚â† discontinued.
---
Oo you know what, I was thinking of the zombie mask, you're 100% correct. You can't equip the zombie head.
---
I would if it there wasn't people who could use that to try and steal my account :( it is a lot tho i havent checked it since i was around 1500 tl
---
No u
---
BRO WE NEED HATS
---
My pet has a hat all year long
---
Some serious entitlement in this thread. What is the issue with giving people unique cosmetics to represent their accomplishments? Why does everyone have to be able to get everything in the game, even after competitions like this have ended?
---
Yep :D
---
Nice try Nike.

No, you can't login on the website or the desktop client until you link your email address. And I cant link my email address because the button is missing.

There are :) 553 potential/816 slots
---
I tried talking to the owner of the account but he didnt wanna add me back. As this may be something personal im not gonna put the rsn out to the public. The text is reported ingame so jagex is aware incase a request to delete the account comes through.
---
Great idea!
---
Yes they do :) 2.25B worth of elven crowns incoming
---
Did a couple of trips using strictly diamond bolts and i seem to be way more accurate for now. Hitting way more often.  Instead of 2:30 times i am now around the 2min mark.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I really don‚Äôt know
---
Yeah it's unfortunate when this happens. Maybe he hasn't acknowledged it as a problem yet and she's at a loss for what to do. Doesn't excuse her behaviour - deleting an account (or sabotaging in this case, such as by dropping items) would just cause a rift between them. They need to work together for progress to be made.
---
:D

I can't log into the website because it says my email address isn't linked!

Well I'm far from maxed and I agree that the shield is shit if that makes you feel better.
---
I like that the pauldron stays on.
---
130+ for me, but already hit 99 Farming so I'm no longer getting seeds for kills.

I love dungeoneering. But as most would agree, it doesn‚Äôt make sense as a ‚Äúskill.‚Äù
---
Yikes my dude. Put the porn away and get a gf

"Only around my age"
---
IIRC the white one (base) is the same as the ithell one, so you may end up saving 250.5M
---
you sure your rubies are enchanted? and your bolts are dragon-base not addy base?
---
keep in mind ruby rng definitely does matter- proc chance is only 6%, so like you can definitely get a chain streak of kills where you dont roll good ruby hits at all, and if you do theyre right around the bolt swap point. but that's why you avg over kph instead of individual kill speed.
---
What a beast!
---
Is it the same look or the same item ID?

Nice account dude im working on a Uim too. Add me if you like i could maybe do with some tips if you have some haha! rsn: im uim wtf
---
If you know the basics of the game, have decent stats and show up on the weekend with elite void / assembler / mage shortbow i you're gonna get picked up and knock it out of the park.
---
It‚Äôs actually really good for thermy and guardians if it‚Äôs used for pet hunting. No shot you‚Äôd really make any money from them though.
---
I don't even support polled changes, but gotta sit back and enjoy the ride until OSOSRS is out. This has been going on for years, and it's not stopping.
---
Polls themselves are an unpolled change. When they had the OSRS release poll, they said like 750k votes for weekly updates. It got like 200k, which was barely enough for it to be released, with 0 updates.
---
Maybe foreman and other higher ups. The only dress code a laborer has is generally long pants and a hard hat or other safety shit. No idea where you got that idea from lol
---
Sweet :D thank you
---
He's been buying the discounted runes from the zammy mage by the looks of it.
---
Which is, and should be, nothing. You can participate in the next league and get that trophy.
---
Dont often scan reddit posts, only occasionally use it.
---
Whenever I start an Ironman of some sort I always stick around in F2P for like a month or so. Its pretty fun
---
its alright to think it‚Äôs shit but it‚Äôs a bit sad if you cry online that it‚Äôs ruining your point and click game
---
Sergey the Serb is a parody account (I think) he‚Äôs definitely joking about that.
---
Nope. You can even just enter cave and immediately leave to skip the task for free if you want to do that
---
Imagine if DMM came back and midway through the tournament they said the original prizes of $10,000 would instead be several months of membership.
---
But it's a glorified participation trophy? all the other rewards are trade-able and not discontinued. All you need is to do one task to get a single trophy now, you have almost a full month to go get 10 league points and get a trophy.
---
Surely the wilderness pk world is appropriate/bounty world
---
Imagine if there were specific worlds for people to pk outside of the wilderness
---
none of those sub categories provide the link either.

Came here to ask this thank you.

Questing is overrated

You hid everything but what‚Äôs important to me how much you made today 3m I will get it

Lol pet at lvl 55 farm here

id be willing to bet my whole next paycheck that even if they extended twisted league another 4 weeks you wouldn't even do it, and then bitch when its over.
---
I see, I'll give it a try, thanks for the reply.
---
I miss skilling because it was a valid money making method, not just because it‚Äôs a requirement for slayerscape/bossscape

H

doot doola doot doo
---
Damn that‚Äôs (un?)lucky.
---
Pretty long story but I got bored of watching the same ol tv series or movies on Netflix. I found twitch and people streaming their lives. Then I heard about some idiot on YouTube that does crazy stuff for content and it was like a reality show with homeless people. 
---
So I found a dude named Ice Poseidon. I watched him for a while and he would always mention that he got started with his career by streaming osrs. I would watch osrs streamers and be tell myself there isn‚Äôt anyway I‚Äôd play that game. It looked way too confusing, I didn‚Äôt get it. 
---
Last summer everyone I use to game with was talking about classic wow and starting a guild up and raiding again etc. but I didn‚Äôt feel like doing WoW again. Especially classic since I had played on a  private server a couple years ago and got many server firsts.
---
I don‚Äôt play games often because when I get into them I am compelled to beat it or be the best at it as I can be. That usually means spending a lot of time playing it.
---
Anyway, my friends got me wanting to play a game again. I looked into all the new games and they all looked lame. I thought about rust but they do server wipes all the time so I decided to give osrs a go. 
---
I hated it at first didn‚Äôt understand it until I set myself a goal to get the fire cape. I grinded range to 99 at sand crabs and started my fire cape journey. It took 6 attempts but I finally got it. When I got it my hands were shaking my adrenaline was going it was exciting to say the least. 
---
I had never experienced that kind of excitement in any game I‚Äôve ever played. And today I am at 2k total and have killed every boss in the game 20 times except raids or inferno.  
---
Anyways sorry for the tldr u asked üòÇ
---
My next clue was actually over 10x the worth! A whopping 66k
---
Lmao I had a similar thing happen at wyrms. A guy next to me said out of nowhere "man I'm just trying to get a dragon sword and mclancington over here is destroying these things"
---
5 kills later I got a d sword drop. Rip that guy.
---
Type me your username and pass
---
Exactly, it's just like the old holiday items that were untradable and discontinued. I don't think anyone that played back then really cared that they were unobtainable based on when you started the game. I always thought of them as age status items. And it's not like they gave you god mode or anything, it was a damn cosmetic. I don't get why people are so hurt about being included, and they still have a whole 20+ days to play leagues and get a trophy.
---
Imagine having to change the grind every time you log out though, such a stitch up
---
idk if LMS is still active, but its an awesome way to learn bridding! No money lost, and there were some pretty good matches there when it first came out. 
---
Its really discouraging at first, but don't give up! you will get that kill eventually.
---
Doubt it, he would be making more off his legit viewership
---
Nice bot
---
Because that‚Äôs what was shown on the livestream. The whole discord dm image wasn‚Äôt leaked, just this small snippet was shown. This is one image, not a composite image.
---
That Barnes guy in her pms is the admin of a large black market discord aswell.
---
It was stated only way you gonna get them is by getting x% in league. And they will be untradeable. And this is what they clarified with the Twitter. That they didnt slap on "discontinued" doesnt mean it was polled just that way.
---
I just really dont get why are ppl so butt hurt about this. Never played any other mmo? Or anything online really.
---
Not what it means... It means that the story is being explained as if someone is watching their movie, and it needs explaining. They are saying things that they already know
---
Monthly tests don't mean shit lol. Most things (without symptoms) take 3-6 months to show up on a test.
---
Ah that‚Äôs good to hear

Mta and barb assault are way worse
---
Damn, how‚Äôd you get such a good return from your kingdom...
---
Those are the rewards I actually want! no matter what mr money bags throws at the game, I can show I actually put work in a league and earned a unique trophy to say I was there. You don't see people bitching about not having reddit rewards because they can't buy them. It's like saying I want a participation trophy for the event I DIDN'T even participate in! WTF is wrong with people?
---
Got Beaver at 75wc

Better late than never :D
---
You could look through this thread's comments to see that it's not even close to nearly everyone.
---
Pest Control and Barbarian Assault are two of the worst aspects of osrs. So many people are just shitheads. People leaving at wave 9. People afking and not attacking the portals. Not closing the fucking door.
---
Just price check and a bot will sort your items for you

Maxed with 15% lovakengj

supposedly there's a boost for it
---
What do I search for in runelite to get the health and prayer bars like that?
---
Time to get a jem bag and karamja hard
---
Gotta do it legit:D
---
Lmao ty
---
For how long? How many followers? Hyphonix was the most watched OSRS twitch streamer at one point too. Gratz to the new kid on the block that nobody is going to give a shit about in 3 months at this rate.

With that outfit I think he's doing something else with shrooms rather than cutting them.
---
It's a fucking main hand cosmetic that does nothing of value. If you don't want to run in the race, don't expect a participation trophy.
---
What did you actualy think? Hot girls play runescape because they like the game?? Psh

ok super star

i already have 1.7k total from the first few weeks
---
why?
---
Pretty much.
---
Oh yeah i ordered a bunch of stuff for black Friday thanks for reminding me
---
How many masters
---
No worries, it‚Äôs actually a pretty smart question. But same go with chinchompas as well. The initial barrage/chin determines all the others.
---
I got mine from tree spirits.
---
Because it's the only reward that matches everything they said. It avoids creating a discontinued item.
---
&gt;Enjoyment is also an incentive.
---
People don't see it that way. It's all about entitlement.

I‚Äôm pretty sure hiscores update on log out and on world switches

You should try again

I hope this is sarcasm, but reading the other comments here, I can't be sure.
---
You would get a dragon league trophy. There wouldn't be specific trophies for each league.

I'm pretty sure the golem in the pic is colored with Daeyalt already, isn't it?

I still don't understand the type of people who use Twitter. Unless you have an active fan base you want to give updates to, it's just a shit platform. So many nobodies that think they're so important enough that people actually give a rats ass about what they think.
---
It's hardly different from the people who would post random ass Facebook statuses about how they feel.
---
Not one sabre?! or do I remember that drop being removed or something?

What are the goals? I just started myself

Imagine caring about anything as much as this comment section cares about what this guy‚Äôs wearing

lmao throwin salt in the wound eh?
---
Is it possible to just buy membership? 5m is a big deal in f2p, you can better use that 5m to invest in your account.
---
You have alot of great quests in members worlds where you can gain alot of early exp so you don‚Äôt have to train the early bird levels, you should google those.
---
im at pretty much the same kc without any mutas or pet.
---
also currently 800 dry of a drop.
---
keep going bro, we're all gonna make it
---
A number of reasons but the biggest one is that in other games I have seen someone with a really cool cosmetic, and when I looked up to get that cool cosmetic it was discontinued.
---
There's nothing more demotivating than knowing that nothing you do matters in terms of getting that cosmetic, and I know that now it's just a simple bankstanding trophy but it sets a precedent to add more discontinued items down the line. OSRS has never had a discontinued item and I don't want to see them start now
---
the og nightmare zone
---
On top of my head. Really tired so theres probably more.
---
Bulwark nerfs.
---
TB in F2P
---
Trophies in Twisted League.
---
Basilisk knight 'nerfs'
---
Thats the 4 main ones i can think of.
---
Also, not sure if the Mage book upgrade was one ignored or something?
---
TB in F2P shoulda just been done regardless, no point in polling. Failing 3 times though and then being pushed through was dumb.
---
Bulwark nerf, tons of ppl were against it. Jagex gave us zero communication or discussion about the item. Dont think it was even polled?
---
Basilisk knight/Trophies were 'influenced by social media'.
---
Neither got polls, Jagex just listened to what is probably a vefy vocal minority on twitter.
---
Theres definitely more of a push for either ignoring or refusing to put stuff up for votes.
---
Its a very slippery slope.
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
Is there a real right way to address this?
---
1. You grind your arse off, get a dragon trophy that is just a generic RS dragon trophy. Next league, it disappears and you have nothing to show for other than highscores that, unless you were top 25, no one will notice your accomplishment.
---
2. You grind your arse off, get a unique dragon trophy that no one else can obtain because you actually participated in, but people are sad because they can't get the same-model-with-slightly-different-logo because it is unobtainable. 
---
Tbh, I'd go with the second one, as how can people justify saying they would have tried for a dragon trophy and now they can't get it? Bullshit if they honestly believe the could obtain top 1% playing casually (casually being not fuckall hours every day).
---
Indeed. They think people care about their opinions. No one gives a fuck, get a life.
---
I‚Äôm aware he‚Äôs not new but his place in the spotlight is.
---
Okay will do. I‚Äôve been doing this on my phone and have to get home to check everything so I just started worrying with time passing. Thanks!
---
if youre doing this to see your pid for staking, it wont work, they patched it. but something witht he gamer word should do it
---
It‚Äôs 7 now, eat it noob
---
Fascinating; can't wait for future vids!
---
Definitely fake. You can check their support page for registered emails that they use
---
 https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001257125-Suspicious-emails
---
Make sure you take appropriate measures if you clicked that link and entered any info. If not, delete and move on!
---
and then you woke up
---
Hmm
---
doesn't matter, it can be spoofed.
---
type out the runsecape website in your browser, log in and check your email through settings.
---
dont click links in emails
---
You're completely missing the point of my post.
---
Con: It's dumb as fuck.

---
Right, it‚Äôs just like a unique holiday event gear piece. If you didn‚Äôt play why would you get it
---
It would be noreply at jagex if it were real
---
I'm probably getting rune and idc about dragon or anything, but for some it's the principle that these are the first ever discontinued items in osrs and we technically didn't even get to vote on them as such. If they were the same item from league to league, people would have other opportunities to put in that work for them; they're not asking for the trophies for free. The option won't exist to put in that work and earn them. I think that's part of why we've voted against discontinued items in the past, because they're partly a prize for being present and become unavailable to new players. But opinion has changed so it is what it is.
---
I have an email that I created for runescape only like 5 years ago. The only thing it has ever been used for is runescape. I have not received any of those emails.
---
Let me help you out here instead, kiddo. You can evade Oda, you're not obliged to watch him. You can switch to another streamer, you can watch netflix, you can do your homework for once, you can do whatever the fuck you want. That's entirely different from your professor and Trump. Those are people who can directly/indirectly impact your life in a large magnitude. Slandering Oda is not necessary whereas slandering your professor or Trump is understandable. Big difference. How are you not able to differentiate between the two?
---
She looks like she hit the wall at 22
---
No, but I already kinda feel bad that my twisted league character is gonna get nuked, especially because I'm a new player. 
---
I've had a lot of fun don't get me wrong but I'm basically not coming to zeah for a long time (other than for a couple useful things) even though my osrs account is basically fresh out of f2p.
---
Also wanting a real reward that isn't just a bunch of gold isn't not playing the game for fun, it's just a normal thing one expects out of a game.
---
The link brought me to RuneScapes page. Does that not rule anything out? Meaning the link could‚Äôve still bugged me before opening their official page?

Hunter and farming are the 2 skills i always recommend to newer players to get into for gp.
---
Chins are pretty high atm. Farming certain herbs are always good.
---
But its still going to be a grind and you may not get the 5m.

What's an Ootl? RWT stands for Real World Trading.
---
Become the gf then ;) r/egg_irl
---
&gt;Why would hating that secretly mean you want that lmao
---
That's exactly what I mean, it ain't happening secretly now is it? Look at this post and to the extent people are willing to go to slander him. That's jealousy.
---
Jagex said that's their intention in one of their blog posts.
---
This is probably the most delusional post I‚Äôve seen here money laundering lmao ????
---
It was all a dream ;(
---
Sometimes they take you to a very legitimate looking page, but have changed the URL ever so slightly like adding .ru at the end.
---
As others have mentioned; check the legitimate website by browsing to it like you normally would and logging in to your account. 
---
That email is definitely fake, however, so if you've clicked the link and entered info, absolutely change your password asap (by logging in as normal) and make sure you have two factor on for further security!
---
I always buy membership using google play credit, but for some reason today i cant, the image above shows my actual balance and the one under it show my balance when attempting to buy membership, when i try to buy something in other apps, it shows my real balance, but in runescape it doesn't.
---
I've never had this problem before, I have checked the forums for help but no one else seems to have a similar problem, but i couldn't find anything, any help is appreciated.
---
Give Rust a go, you'd be deadly with that drive

Having a job/school and playing 6+ hours a day =\= having a life

When you came back to the game originally, was your auth still on the account?

Or the reverse, he‚Äôs buying OSRS gp with real money to pay off some of his debt.

Dude. Freeze is guaranteed. Nibbler have 0 defence. After that you 19.2 seconds to set up the wave. You can then flick whatever is attacking you and take care of the nibblers. If it really were RNG, there would be no way for xzact to consistently get his low combat infernal capes.
---
 I would suggest linking an entirely new email with two-factor authentication to your account. The email too, not just your account. My emails have phone-code thingy, and also tell you when your email's logged into, and from which IP address, etc. 
---
 It's good you changed your pin. Make sure your email can't be recovered at all by the hacker again. These are basic suggestions though, there's guys much smarter than me in this sub who will help you'
---
In erns of = in terms of?
---
Pking someone isnt exactly competing for resources as the resources will always be there, ita just not allowing others to get resources. Id love if they fixed the wildy, but in order to do that their gonna have to move all wildy uniques elsewhere so as not to force pvmers there. And make wildy more profitable without uniques.
---
I was more getting at this is not normal and I feel like it's gonna be all downhill from here
---
This is months old and i cant really see why would oda risk his twitch career over couple bills, he has 5000+ suibs thats 12500 a month he gets, + bits donos etc, prob like 16k a month, theres no way hes risking that over couple bills just saying
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know cuz all the tinder girls here have 3 kids by 22 years old and ‚Äúain‚Äôt lookin to play no games!!! No sex I want a real man!‚Äù
---
Talented man!
---
Thank you üôÇ I will maybe look into just making a new email entirely for my account
---
You need to find someone else in the opposite gang and you swap certificate halves.
---
Okay thank you! And thanks to everyone else. I‚Äôll change my password and I have 2FA on thankfully so I think I should be good. A valuable TIL for me about sketchy emails lol
---
You really think odablock the type of guy to do that? LOL
---
Can someone ELI5 what's going on?
---
The game shouldn't cater to me, yes. [But neither they should make unpolled changes like this.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMLIgZ0XYAEwoar?format=png&amp;name=900x900)

What's the xp per hour?  With or without wisdom relic?

Sooooo funny to see these people drooling over him any other day but then this comes out &amp; now he‚Äôs the worst person ever lmfao
---
Everytime I tried to tell this to people, 2 or 3 more people would start bailing out of spite. Fuck bailers.
---
Not really. You went into a dangerous situation unprepared and made some mistakes due to relative laziness.
---
It is a sucky situation, but at least it was on TL which isn‚Äôt permanent anyway
---
Out of the loop
---
I‚Äôm convinced you don‚Äôt know what the word jealousy means. There are WAY more reasons to hate someone than wanting what they have
---
Cause it was designed by a "FeEeEeMaLe" probably

Yeah it was

that's a spongeful of toilet water
