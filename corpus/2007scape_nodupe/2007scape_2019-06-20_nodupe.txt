Hello? Just buy an eternal gem lmao

Cost more per xp point than teaks? I should prolly switch to teaks then, I'm not super concerned with leveling fast, just something to do every day lol.
---

---
I've actually switched to curry now, but find maples are too expensive, so I guess I will try teaks then, or something else.
---
Still would be an improvement for Jagex customer support
---
Yeah its very underpowered! they should make it so you can choose your slayer assignments 10 times a day, that would make it so that people actually want to get 99 slayer!
---
!remind me 1 day
---
I just got a daggonath task. What should I bring for my first dks trip? Any recommendations or a video you suggest? I only see old ones. Should I follow one of those?
---
Check the polls
---
Yes tzhaar thieving is completely unaffected by the thieving cape perk, it's actually just as good pre 99 as it is post 99 - that's why everyone doing it wears a different cape so they can look cool!
---
They are talking about changing MEP2 as part of this quest release :(
---
I've said this for years and I'll say it again: Mod MatK is(was) the most important JMod on the OSRS team. Yes we have Ash and he is brilliant and dedicated from a development standpoint, but in terms understand what's healthy for the game's longevity, MatK was invaluable. I know he says he's left us in good hands, but tiny changes add up over time. MatK understands this. Other management doesn't seem to quite as much.
---
Well fuck now I'm unsure. We do know for sure in current game her hitbox is 1x1, which even tho mentioning rs3 prone to downvotes, can be proven with sgb spec. I ask that you'll forgive me for memory having it been so long ago. 
---
That said the reason that do able in part was cuz of buggy aggro ai, which was why zaryte safe spotting was also doable for a while. I recall this flinching being fixed as well?
---
But yeah tldr u might be right. If so they deco changed it when they changed her graphics in rs3.

Keep in mind I'm mobile only and don't get sweaty about it but I was getting in the 75k-85k range when I burst dusties.
---
Because 150 bronze bolts are fucking useless. The fletching cape is already plenty strong enough, as it saves 2 inventory spaces when killing arma. Firemaking cape already provides a light source - doesn't need to be made any better. Attack cape provides unlimited access to one of the best afk training spots in the game (assuming you're going afk for &lt;10 mins you just jump in the basement room and afk with auto retaliate on, come back with 13k more att/str xp than you had before.
---
Eh playing the beta would be cool, but I'm kinda glad I don't have access. I haven't played WoW in years, and I don't want my triumphant return tarnished by the fact that the beta is temporary and I will have to restart when it actually releases.
---
Basically I don't want to get burnt out before it actually starts.
---
The hype is real, and I want to play now. If Blizzard offered me a beta key I would 100% play it. But as long as they don't, I'm content to wait it out.
---
Yeaj, look at all these cancerous incels. You did literally nothing incindiary and theyre frothing at the fuckin mouth.

Ur trolling right? Or do you actually think max cape needs the ability to teleport to every tile in the game.

Appreciate the honest/neutral input.  Its nice to have people say what they think without being biased or extreme.  Hats off to you my friend

If u have a Xeric's talisman they are in the catacombs in the first room to the south. Very quick to get to with like 8 spawns + in a tiny room
---
probably an unpopular opinion but a game should not be balanced around people making alt accounts.
---
The steepness is referring to where questing leaves you if you only skill for quests. Even if you get all the skills leveled for all the questd, you still need 209 more skill levels to meet all the hard diary requirements (ignoring boosts). You need 25 whole farming levels too 49 to 74.

(srs the full 3D is actually super expensive to make, the mold needed costs 5x as much as a normal one and the unit price is a lot higher too. That’s why they’re more expensive than the others, I try to keep my prices as fair as I can but these are just pricey to make)

I don't understand the crowd of people that "quits" games, just play whatever game you enjoy at that moment and if you get the feeling you want to play osrs you play osrs.

Already did the content. Nothing in OSRS is particularly "hard" (with the exception of high end pvm, such as inferno), just tedious.

The line from your house to the node is the issue, once it hits the backbone of the au network there is little problem.
---
The fttn crap we are getting now is the problem, if your the house next to the node your net will be good, if your the last house on the far side of the estate/the cable is ran poorly your in for a bad time. This is what makes internet in AU such a big rng game.

Yeah he was crazy lucky and got it like within 5kc lmao

I guess you ain't lying

I know that they won't restore the bank, I just want to know how it happened as I have 2fa, a bank pin, a secure password, and I've never shared my account or password with anybody

&gt; Making something easier for seemingly no reason (being annoying isn't a reason) would never fly here.
---
i mean that's literally what the majority of qol changes are based on these days.
---
all the recent interface changes were made because it was annoying as fuck to do things on mobile.
---
a more extreme one would be all the updates to poh since osrs became a thing, it makes slayer and pvm in general way easier than before.
---
&gt; Furthermore quests are already easy. There are multiple text/video guides. So would this pass it would be making something that's already easy to do easier. And you do quests once so this cant really even be considered qol.
---
If they are already easy then why does it matter if its easier? I've already done these quests multiple times so i don't really care, but the arguments people make are quite ridiculous. Nothing in runescape is hard, NOTHING. There is varying degrees of tediousness and over the years people seem to love making some things less tedious and others they don't want to change because... reasons.
---
It also just creates value in your own decision making by being there
---
There are plenty of grinds and shitty cliffs to climb all around me, but I choose particular obstacles to tackle first, or choose what to do the easy route and just "pull myself up by my bootstraps" for the shit I can't just get around
---
It makes this dynamic "mental landscape" for the game, where your choices and what obstacles you commit to spending your patience on feles more important

More pressing yes but not nearly as quick. Adding a delay to the recovery without email is as simple as changing a value. Give a delay that we as account holders can set, either 3, 5, or 7 days, and then when that delay is triggered send an email and Jagex account message. If you're the one sending the request you already know about the delay and don't need the message warning you. If you didn't then you have time to tell Jagex that no you did not submit the request and that somebody is trying to hijack your account.

As for today, I woke up and got to hang out with my awesome son. Worked for a few hours. Went on a 24 mile bike ride. Visited my wife at lunch. Worked a few more hours from home. Then we made a new pasta recipe for dinner. Watched some Peaky Blinders while feeding my son. Read him some stories and put him to bed. Now I’m just finishing up some yard work before we have all my employees over for an all day cookout/day drinking party Saturday.

The drop rate of RoL is completely irrelevant though lol, on average you'll still get a b ring or an archers ring every task
---
If you really want to give yourself a whole new outlook of the game, I suggest making a Ironman (or even hardcore Ironman).  You really get to experience the game on how it’s supposed to be played.  I just received a tome of fire today in my hcim, and I haven’t felt this sense of excitement from Runescape since I first started playing in 03.  Just my two cents.

med is a type of pking build, along with voider, zerk, pure, obby mauler and probably 50 others i don't know

I went right to the website, (no links or anything) and spoke with someone. Im still a little concerned about the overall risk of it, but I def would like even some of that money coming back to me, even if theres no efficient way to liquidate the account.

Essentially I would have to come in at a liquidation value thats higher than the cost of a bond, right?

It can work, look at GGG and Path of Exile - one of the most open, in terms of communication, gaming companies around. They're owned by Tencent yet you can still feel their original creative touch every 3 months. (But fuck lootboxes for real)

Jagex can be (understandably) difficult to deal with sometimes. The biggest "oof" I've made with them was a good 18 years ago (I was 11), original runescape. I had made friends with somebody and had PKed/quested with them regularly for a year. At that time, I had a bunch of party hats (a sign of wealth back then) that another friend had given to me, so after selling some of them I was pretty rich. One day this "friend" of mine offers to do some questing or grinding or something for me and I gave him my credentials (really dumb in hindsight, but I didn't have any friends in real life so he was the closest thing I had). Went to log in the next day, password and other credentials were changed. Logged into my alt and saw him online and I tried pleading with him to give the account back, said he could even keep the shit if that's what he wanted, but he just laughed at me and called me a loser, told me to go kill myself, etc. Tried doing email recovery but I wasn't getting anything. Tried contacting jagex but they just wouldn't do anything for me. I was so depressed for months and quit playing until I picked it up again a couple years back.

In response to this, I think that if you have your 2fa linked to the email that your osrc is linked too, they can easily disable your 2fa by requesting it to be canceled and osrc send a confirmation email to your email (which they already have access too) and accept that request then delete the email for proof.
---
You should have a seperate email for your 2fa or have a 2fa for your email you use. 
---
I have both, hopefully that’s good enough.

I studied accounting in college so a lot of my studying required tons of hands on work (writing down entries and what not).

Personally, I found eels and Magic’s to be the most afk thing.

No I'm not. I still believe it is the app and err on the side of not trusting it.
---
They didn't check Jed's code in the mobile app which could lead to peoples account information.  
---
That is my reason and why I don't trust the mobile app. I also have no proof the coding in the app is malicious as I don't know it. All of which I stated in the first reply. 
---
The "no proof" aspect comes for both sides, neither of us have proof if they did or did not check the code Jed wrote. 
---
I cannot prove it is malicious and the others cannot prove it isn't. No need to call people stupid over opinions none of us can prove. 
---
I'm just saying how I see it. In 4+ years of owning my account, nothing happens. I play mobile, and not too long after my account is hijacked. It seems suspicious to me is all and I warned a guy who seemed worried about his account.

It’s fair enough, but I just think doing even some more efficient slayer would yield better drops (as in Cerberus/hydra and other higher level slayer monsters)

I really have never done demonics except a few times. Time to kill was really fast and zenytes are 1/300. Just think there’s better money elsewhere, although they are a lower tier demiboss type thing I guess.

No I don’t really care about the ditch in particular. I think the most disappointing change is the fact you lose nothing when you die now. Its just not runescape anymore knowing you have 2 hours to get your shit anywhere but the wilderness.
---
Because honestly this moreso just sounds like a myth passed down because no one has gone through the mechanic as its supposed to work enough times to throroughly test it, bc it was discovered real quick that its better to tank the damage

Not calling you out for not saying nice things, calling you our for thinking that trying to insult me somehow makes your obnoxious quest better. Further emphasized by the fact that you've yet to say anything good about it yourself, just that "if you don't like it you just hate effort and want to afk." Ad Hominem is all you've got.
---
Underground Pass's puzzles require no thought to solve. The only difficulty in traversing the area is the RNG obstacles, which is also somehow the most engaging section of the quest. The premise of Iban's influence is interesting, story is extremely barebones with the only best bits being the very few interactions with Koftik.

Simple, long term goals, nesting, character building, open world sandbox and of course, the "You can do everything your own way", followed closely by the "You can do *it all again* another way" - is what makes it good imo.
---
Can't think of any other game that does this
---
Black demons are meh. 
---
I never do them at MM2 because it takes an arm and a leg to get through 200 of the damn things when I could just go to Kourend and AFK for decent XP with a chance for totems and shards.
---
Get those RS3 graphics out of here reposter
---
You can learn the method on how to solve a slide puzzle in less than 10 seconds, lmfao; do you complain about having to learn zulrah rotations or raid bosses too?
---
Chasm of fire cannon and safe spot and it’s basically multi
---
Good.
---
That’s the intention
---
nice thinking
---
RS3 refugee/mobile baby spotted
---
Did you check near the farming guild?
---
&gt; I also took this opportunity to add 2FA to all my email accounts.
---
Are you saying that your osrs account email or that account's recovery email didnt have 2FA before? If you only set them up after receiving password change requests thats already too late. IF they got on your email they can easily go into settings and forward all jagex emails to themselves and set the original email to get automatically deleted. That way you would have no idea you got any mail and that it was actually forwarded to them unless you manually check your settings and notice the change. And by that point it doesnt even matter that you have 2FA lol.
---
Those stats are more than adequate to kill demonic gorillas and I kinda view those as early end game PvM that's easier to get into than bossing. Plus they'll certainly net you some gp
---
You could totally kill KBD solo as well, he's not bad to learn.
---
I haven't played RS3 since 2015 and I don't use mobile, try again
---
Don’t mess with perfection
---
I meant soloing something else would be a good intro to PvM and once I had some skills I'd try duo or trio bandos as you recommended. Don't want to bring a team down like a nub haha!
---
Yeah. Which means most ultra gamers are too heavy to even get into basic...
---
Basically me but trying to get inferno gear. Game just isn't fun unless you play an ironman nowadays. Pking is dead and every boss is an instanced solo boss catered towards ironmen. The way I see it is if I can get lucky and stake to a tbow I might have some fun doing inferno
---
Infernal cape is hard.
---
D for automod
---
Recently started playing Ultimate Ironman and these construction stashes are a life saver for storing few important items so you don't have to search for them every time you need one. 
---
Not to mention that they help with clues too obviously.
---
I will be posting rest of the stash locations later too if people find this one useful. If not, I'll just make them and use them myself once I reach the required levels.
---
I like it but I'd like to see them act differently than spirit trees. maybe they drain your health by a decent chunk so as not to be OP. maybe they demand you feed them a spirit seed every 100 uses. something like that.
---
did you get a skilling record?
---
No, I'd rather you not be voting on polls. RS3 welcomes you, though.
---
Jagex customer support is the literal fucking worst in the world. Even ea is better
---
You obviously got hacked, there’s no mystery there worth a J-mods time in explaining it. Change your passwords on everything just to be safe.
---
Submit your repeal through the regular system, including as much info as you have the first time. This isn’t the place for appeals such as your own.

---
The Italy rock move with healers is interesting, i didn’t even know jad would stop attacking there. I think I’d get to nervous moving and mess up when I came back into range.
---
Gratz friend! I finally just got mine too and it feels good to have a junior flex, doubt I’ll ever pursue inferno anyway
---
Nope
---
I'm going to vote on every poll from now on
---
Jed brought revs back for rot to control 2k worlds and rwt, he also sold account info on his way out
---
osrs is the only game ive ever seen accounts get hacked regularly with 2fa. the team that oversees this are working on the bare minimum of brain cells
---
No nsfw tag? smh my virgin eyes 😰
---
It wont pass, I haven't even done these quests and I voted no, now imagine how the rest will vote, casual plebes don't even vote.
---
U are objectively correct by the way but don’t waste your time with this mouth breather
---
Must have fallen out of the package near the farming guild
---
Any 200 or 300 dollar laptop will run it perfectly fine. I used a 400 dollar laptop, that was 5 years old for a year or so until I upgraded.
---
I'd actually suggest using linux on a very cheap laptop for osrs, but any 300 dollar thinkpad with a dual core processor will run the game just fine.
---
? Im from 3rd world country and i was paying equivalent of 11$ in euro.
---
&gt;but am still maintaining the membership on them 2 weeks at a time through draining my rs3 main bank 
---
If everybody who wants to play on multiple accounts is already willing to pay to do so, why would they discount it and make less?
---
let me come
---
The Fremminik Trials is very fun
---
Something about u grinds my gears. I have a picture of bubble bass from that  episode in my head when I read your shit
---
Yeah I got a similiar mail yesterday. In fact a lot suspicious stuff was going on on a lot of my gaming accounts like Twitch or EA.
---
Must be somekind of hacking wave
---
holy shit i can't unhear it now
---
Downvoted you in turn for a non sensical comment
---
Relax mate. What’s the problem here? You got banned because you didn’t talk back or what? 
---
I’m pretty sure it isn’t a banable offense. I’ve seen how the mods interact with bots, and they need a verification from a Jmod to ban, unless it’s the software that detected it. They aren’t really banning people for not talking back. If people act strange though, it’s another thing.
---
I love Underground Pass, I think it’s a great quest and I genuinely wish there were some more like it. It has a really cool story and you have to explore and really try and *survive* in this dungeon environment. It’s actually difficult, you have resources to manage and puzzles to solve and things to kill, which I appreciate much more than just “learn boss”.
---
h
---
I got bout 140k/hr at dust devil's and made around 100k gp/hr too, if you don't have the slay lvl then I suggest you just do some Slayer and do devil's lol it ain't that bad especially if you got a high range level to power thru the tasks
---
Lmao did you see his response 😂
---
Just hope people see this &amp; know that I wouldn’t not make this right 😅 I’ve been in a lab all day for one of my classes, didn’t see this until someone tagged me :/
---
yes and that last thing is the problem when i play i click while I’m in other game so yes it looks floppy with alot of standing and random map clicks
---

---
whos this noob catching swamp lizards in a snelm? and why isn't he just picking up the rcb? lol some ppl are so oblivious
---
The biggest wtf here is the one-style pking. No one goes out without brid anymore because overheads aren't looked down on anymore.
---
Yeah I guess I just think of it as brute forcing by technique, with a few parameters
---
The quest guide does say that 50+ agility is highly recommended. Even noobs would see that and realize that it will be a lot harder if they don't have 50 agility.
---
I wonder if he really would of flew to get the knife 😂
---
I mean at this point it is pretty clear what happened, but like nothing will come of it. 
---
They probably had Jed sign an NDA and moved on. 
---
Also the current collapse of the Venezuela Oil trade could be a vital role in the hacking and scamming that is going on. Due to people from that country looking for a way supplement lost income. (Buyers get buy account info in bulk and sort through them). Rumor has it the market has been on the upswing.
---
I have an inferno cape and I am extraordinarily humble.
---
wtf

Thanks :)

No no he just got the order wrong. He ordered the twisted handcuffs 🤔
---
He died to a healer. He did not complete the fight caves.
---
What i dont get, is why that i have chosen to have an authenticator that why it isn't required when changing the osrs accounts email or password?
---
Do you not realize this is a budget laptop that only needs to play runescape? Did you read ops post?
---
Ddr2 is fine for osrs, ddr3 is better. For 200 or 300 bucks you'll do better getting a better CPU with the saved money.
---
Is it galaxy brain? If so TIL, always referred to it as “universe brain”.
---
Pro tip about email deletion: make a 2nd gmail and have the first auto copy/forward _everything_ to it. Space will never be an issue in any time frame that matters. Just make sure you don’t forget that login ;) you can then use your normal account as usual.
---
Oh shit. This is pretty much the biggest issue with the entire game since Jed started working for Jagex.
---
This is the main reason why I bank all my shit every time I log out. It's annoying as fuck that we can't trust 2-step-authenticator because the customer service kindly hand out your account to hackers.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
At least banking my shit every time I log out reduces the chance of losing all my stuff.
---
Passwords are not case sensitive, bank PIN can be cancelled in 7 days (we should get the ability to change that number all the way up to 365 days IMO), Authenticator can be disabled too easily and customer support hand your account away for free + automatically denies real recovery attempts is just plain fucking wrong. This is 2019, Jagex should really fix these issues asap!
---
We shouldn't have to bank everything I have before logging out.
---
Good luck getting your account back, OP!
---
Alch the beaver
---
Classic panic pray switch at 0:16
---
Graz on the cape tho
---
That won’t make you any more secure. If someone logs in from a different IP it will automatically ask for pin again even if it hasn’t been 5 mins
---
Everything pvm related is going down.
---
hit me up the next time someone cracks a runescape password via brute forcing (no runescape account db leaks exist that i know of as of yet)
---
the rate at which you can try pw combinations and the lockup period makes it rather unrealistic, enough so that being paranoid about case sensitivity making the difference is completely unnecessary
---
you can get cheap laptops with ddr4......

I mean, I guess it depends on what you define as "early on." I'm by no means a hardcore scaper by any means, but I did UGP about two?.. or maybe three months into playing. It's been probably 6 or 7 months since then, and I just finished MEP2 the other day.
---
So I'd say that's still pretty early on, and most people I know did it on a similar timeline; Iban's Blast is too tempting to not get that badboy done.
---
Jed actually was part of the mobile team before he got fired, that bit is true. No one knows the rest for sure.
---
Is it just me or the number of account thefts in the recent month have FUCKING SKYROCKETED?
---
If he's anything like me a decade ago, that's not a build, that's him discovering the attack style tab after a few hours.
---
&gt; If there is anyone who has been around for more than a few years, do you believe the prices will recover or only certain items?
---

Yeah my prayer flicking is *super* questionable, like "Brewed on W29 last task cause I fucked up a blob flick" questionable. But you really have a lot of wriggle room at 99 defense, and you're not doing complicated flick set ups for every wave. 
---
But honestly I'd have done it even if inferno cape was just cosmetic, it was a lot of fun to learn and struggle against!

Depends how the passwords get stored in the database :) If they are hashed with bcrypt at a decent cost, then it does actually make a difference if your password is "catlover123" and not "csBl@dZaaze!". Even when the database gets leaked.
---
I've heard you can "splash" Kraken for FULL Hp + Magic Xp.
---
You just directly attack him (dont poke out the tentacles) so his Hp doesnt decrease but you stiol get the full Xp of your attack. Im returning after a couple years tho so not sure if its been patched.

yeah meme i get it

You cannot transfer skills from rs3 to osrs. Like others have said, you can try to find some clans or websites to help you transfer gp over some wacky rates. OR, what I did was, just use the rs3 money to buy bonds to fund my osrs account. Because memberships are two-way for the same account. You'll start to build your account slowly but surely if you have members. If you really want to swap gold, i'd say it's not worth unless you have like 200m+ on rs3? Otherwise, just slowly spend it on bonds is my suggestion.
---
You can add me if you like. RSN: Herr Fristi
---
I guess people spending real money on bonds as these are 4m ea now is a part of the reason ad well. i mean... if id have te money to spare i would do it aswell. but nah. gotta get dem pizzas :D
---
Summer influx of people that play little during school/work and people panic selling. 
---
The people that play little, are those that can do bosses, but generally have to prioritise real life instead of this game.
---
All the influx of either big or semi-big items will bring the price down and thus panicking those who see their banks tank 400m in a day.
---
Selling isn't dumb to do at the start of the fall, since you can generally buy back your old gear plus a bit more.
---
With that said, it's risky to buy back too late when items rise up to their old price or somewhere along those lines.
---
Give away stuff to noobs in F2P or do drop parties and games till your bank and heart melts.
---
This way, you are happy, the people who you gave to are happy, and hackers cannot get your stuff when you are gone.
---
I think he must have dropped it outside the farming guild
---
Big oof champ sorry to see you took my comment that hard!  
---
Really stings to have you call me a moron because I told you how to deal with that problem of not losing all your items on death champ.   I'm going do my best to get over it though and I hope you keep me in  your thoughts and prayers because I'ma keep you in mine!👼
---
Gratz on lvl 99 Incel OP.
---
Funny how when my shit got hacked I got swarmed with hate accusing me of being an account seller which turned out to be not true, as stated by Mod Weath in his response. It’s nice to see you getting majority support though. I hope everything gets resolved in your favor, bud!
---
Zenytes are literally a 1/300 drop, generally resulting  in a pretty reliable ~one zenyte per two tasks @ about 13m in roughly 3-4 hours. The resources and effort required to reliably drop hundreds of gorillas is also so much lower than any boss.
---
making the goblins and cows multi would be hella litty tho fam.
---
You really think Cerberus is higher money per hour than demonics? You're completely speaking out of your ass.
---
ive spent 100s+ hours on this ironman to see it just gone overnight. and i thought i had all the security measures in place that was available, but obviously not. I stream too so there goes the ironman content.

Would love to if they talk to me :)
---
It makes about as much sense as the area being locked behind a quest in the first place, my best guess would be that they didn't want newer members wandering/being lured into a relatively dangerous area of the world.
---
Updated with sources and math.  Please remember I said pounds not dollars which is why the numbers are slightly higher than what you saw on the front page.
---
we can only imagine how repulsive this creature looks irl, luring in his basement abode, immersed in his life of role play
---
Yup. I don't have a clue otherwise. The situation is truly ridiculous then. Good Luck, lol
---
That's a normal dragon crossbow. DHCB is not red anymore rhey made it like this yellow-green color
---
Im legit just afraid to do anything on the account right now, like i cant even change the email preferences ect so like not sure what to do.
---
I mean, that's the silly thing. The quest has NO agility requirement. You can beat it at 1 agility and 10hp. It just sucks ass really hard.
---
Lmao
---
Are you sure? One of the earliest PVM you can do is barrows, which only really requires 50 range and 50 mage to do effectively. For that iban's is recommended a lot so I could see new players doing underground pass a bit early on.
---
Is the morytania thing still possible? My internet isn't good enough atm to watch YouTube (on holiday) and I want to try that on my skiller.
---
I agree with you but this is one of those cases where Jagex has published their EBIDA and they exist in a well defined industry.  I actually did track down all the numbers ahead of time and only excluded them because the sources and math literally double the length of the post (see edit).
---
If you are curious, please see the updated post with all of the information, math, and rounding that happened in this post.
---
See edit
---
What? That wasn't in the latest poll was it?
---
If you're doing the slayer staff method that's the best time to click on it, when you see the white coming at you. Otherwise just use that tick to eat food
---
That only works for beginner/easy sudokus... A regular sudoku should have at least one point where a square is not guaranteed correctly solvable just by looking at filled in numbers.
---
Ugh that’s the worst
---
You can juggle food on either side of the door to not have to sacrifice a slot for a hammer, btw.
---
Their financials made the front page twice last week so I assumed everyone saw it.  I updated the post with sources.
---
On wiki it says that demonics are best gp/h calculating with supply cost
---

---
Runespan was great. Hate me.
---
Disagree. The people that are going to do it without a guide will already have the challenge. What will RNG do?
---
I pked full sara in f2p bh sometime in 08-10. Was 5m at the time pretty sure I got a failed rwt’er
---
You say this as if rune isn’t already basically obsolete
---
You still have to regain aggro, no decent drops. No aoe melee.
---
NMZ is probably the meta
---
New accounts != new players.
---
I could well be wrong, but I can't see people who are actually new to the game doing UGP early on.

---
My clan hates me a lot now :)
---
What's the chance of this happening?
---
I assume it's 50/50
---
I'm speaking from a Jagex perspective, of their goals with creating the quest. Are they making the puzzle for people specifically for people who are going to do it without a guide, or are they trying to make a puzzle part of the quest experience? If the former, then the MEP2 mold is fine. But if it is the latter, then I think that they should make it different for everyone.
---
I’m gonna play devils advocate here.. your screen shots don’t show shit... everything you have shown is cropped as hell and can be very easily fit in your invent/death box. 
---
You claim they got through the pin, so they know your pin via account sharing or you have showed it on stream, which is your own fault... OR you have gone and RWT it all and are trying to cry hacked as a smoke screen. 
---
Pins take 3 days minimum to remove..
---
Yeah....been a complaint since the game came out.  Over a decade and they can't be added to fix it.

---
&gt; These stackable keys are untradeable, but can nevertheless be dropped to a PKer on death provided they're not among the protected items.
---
What is this inconsistent nonsense? If they're not tradeable, then a PKer shouldn't be able to loot them either. That is how it works with every other item in the game.  
---
You say you can't trade them, but I would argue otherwise. All it does it add a minor inconvenience to the trading process as you need to PK the seller. You might as well just make them tradeable.
---
Off topic, but how much xp/hr is splashing and how much is it?
---
I blame Volvo
---
Revives dead content tho. No one tries to PK in that cave because its so easy to escape. Maybe with potentially big loot people will go there again.
---
I know what you're thinking. "Did he use six bags, or only five?" Well to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I lost count myself. So you've gotta ask yourself one question, punk. Paper or plastic?

How is this afk? Away from keyboard, right? Don’t you have to be there to keep clicking to move to the next obstacle? I really don’t understand the “afk” if you have to be there every few seconds to click the next command. Is there something I’m not getting?

The whip is better but you can't use it until 70 attack. You can use the dragon scimitar to train to that and then use it to get the defender before 70 attack.

Its by many measures an early quest. The highest level mobs you have to fight is 91, and most of it is easy to safespot.

i wanna know what lies below her ass dude!
---
Dun dun dun doon doooon
---
My suggestion is start with quests, don't ask which one, just check and do them if you can.
---
You are going to hinder the experience if you just do what people tell you to do, just go and enjoy it man, in fact, i'd recommend staying away from guides and this subreddit
---
You'd be amazed how many things I WONT do on mobile because its significantly easier on desktop with runelite plugins.
---
"choice" lmfao
---
Yeah I don't think most pures are going to want BIS pure gloves locked behind a contrived 95 farming requirement. 
---
What the fuck does 95 farming have to do with how high I should be able to hit in PvP? This will never pass if it means allowing pures post-quest access to Ape Atoll without defence training.
---
It is time to change your customer support policies Jagex. This subreddit is not the runescape customer support page. Players shouldn't need 5k+ upvotes, gold, silver, plus a sticky to get their issues resolved. What about the people who never make it this far? Enough is enough Jagex!
---
You can instantly teleport out of there...
---
LMS update soon =)
---
The location of the deep wildy chest may be a dead area currently but now that it's there it's going to draw the attention of pkers who know people will be going there for rewards. I don't think theres any problem with it and I'm happy to see pvp getting any kind of update so it will be interesting to see how it plays out.
---
Arceus ape atoll tele already teles close to teak trees
---
You're right, Runelite should be banned! 
---
Can't wait until it's quests for you, already does your clues.
---
Obviously you can play it fine without but runelite has so many good QoL add-ons
---
How many hours a day of straight up questing and Skilling for quest?
---
BEER DRINK
---
To each it's own, i played the game back in the day there were no plug-ins and i still do that way. As i said, i love Runelite and all their QoL/Convenience features but it takes away too much of the thinking and the engagement for me. It's like they make a simple game even simpler and i'm just doing what the client is telling me to do.
---
this. at the very least just choose random non sequiturs as recovery answers
---
It's worth whatever someone is willing to pay. Just like any other commodity on this planet. 
---
Virtual items in CS:GO do have a monetary value (steam wallet). You should  understand this playing a game where people RWT frequently.
---
The quest will probably give an item with infinite teleports to the elf area. I’d imagine the cost of teleports would drop.
---
Lol isnt he third now?

I did have most f2p quests done and had about 40 in all f2p stats so was roughly like 4 hrs a day. But some days I did WT or fishing afk at work. Definitely was a grind though. Currently sitting at 79 combat with 66 att str 60 def 61 magic and 50 range

Yeah I don't want them to become crazy gp/hr I just don't want to feel like they are such a waste because I feel the same as you. I actually enjoy the boss quite a bit, and the granite dust is actually pretty nice to have. I legitimately think that making it tradeable would be tbe perfect fix to the boss and I'm sure people would love to be able to upgrade their cannon. Or you could even keep it untradeable and just make granite cannonballs tradeable so theyre locked behind a smithing req

Even if you want to AFK fish sharks in the fishing guild on mobile it's terrible.  Having to tap and hold every fish spot to see if you can harpoon it.

A typical mistake would be mistyping 1 letter or number or caps lock. if your passsword is more of a sequence then just a simple Word then that could be The cause. Also when submitting req questions mension stupid details that only The owner would know. Like The pin, Any passwords you remember, IP address and dates that you played from that IP. Give them The link to this post aswell. :)

For almost A decade I've wanted a tier 3 Temple Knight armor set... and a continuation of that quest series in general. A good one, one that don't end with a fucking pillar. This idea... I like.

How can you click on rooftops without looking though

Is there a way to go directly to Jad in the Tournament worlds?
---
It was, they just had access to your email too. They deleted any emails sent by Jagex denoting the authenticator being disabled and the email being changed for the account.
---
I've compared small indie titles too such as warframe and neverwinter. Both games are free to play without locking paid content as gameplay and areas behind a paywall. Paid content is mostly cosmetic or simply a way to skip a grind. Again, I'm not saying runescape should go down that path and adopt that business model, but I'm merely saying that the £7 price tag is too steep. Especially for such a low budget game. £4 is a fair asking price.
---
Fucked by hackers ? 😂
---
You didn't see the Twisted bow on the ground near farm guild because its not there!
---
Most of the ppl at revs and wines are bots or goldfarmers, normal players dont go there cause of the toxicity... And clans farming them for profit, which is just as bad as gold farming itself..
---
You’re not going to get hacked from buying gold. You might get banned, but not hacked.
---
Or they have
---
We dont know.
---
Thanks for answering.  
---
Most people are just downvoting me for asking questions about RL, so I appreciate you actually helping me learn from your perspective.
---
bruh it's 9am EST, a lot of players are asleep/working
---
chill
---
Typically if something is game breaking enough, Jagex will tell them to remove it from the client and they obey. Runelite+ is a whole different beast and I agree some of the plug-ins on there are complete overkill.
---
With the whole demonic gorilla's thing, I'm sure I or anyone else could learn properly if they put in the time, but the plug-in doesn't play the game for you. It still requires my full attention and I even mess up sometimes, but I don't deny that it helps.
---
Nothing is enough when your entire computer is compromised short of an email authenticator on another device, like a phone.
---
Nah I don’t mind. They kill a few rats then leave. It’s just funny because they almost always think they’re bot busting

I think he means we can hear the noise barrage makes in our heads when we look at this picture...
---
yes but we're saying that, even if he couldn't click them, because he chose not to, other people, wouldn't know that.  I get what you're saying that he might as well raise his prayer from 22 though.
---
Ill go through these one by one
---
Clue scrolls - I think these would be way too tedious for what they have to offer without runelite, I probably wouldve never even done one if RL didnt exist honestly... But I do see your point here as figuring out what to do based on a hint is indeed content that is being skipped
---
Raids 1 - Im inclined to disagree, you can already scout based on map layout it would just be a far longer far more annoying process
---
Tile marker - wait, people use these outside of the inferno? (Dont know about TOB, havent done that yet) especially the fact that you mention fight caves here has me scratching my head as I cant even think of a reason to mark anything there..
---
I think runelite has done more good than bad in terms of new player experience... in fact, I am still kind of a new player, I started playing 5 months ago and definitely wouldnt have if runelite didnt exist tbh

The vanilla menu gives you bad information all the time. Not only that, but the death mechanics are a little convoluted some items have their own rules in wildy that you wouldn't know until you go there or read the wiki.

I used to do it when I was bored figuring most people were just afk and just thought it was funny seeing their account instant log. People will still do it is all I'm saying.
---
And you’re welcome to not use it. There is no doubt without RL, OSRS’s popularity would suffer.

The usability and QOL updates from RL make OSRS much more enjoyable.

Have you tried training hitpoints, so that you don't die?

Use any and all security options for all accounts. Email and runescape account. Use 2fa and phone for the email as well as 2fa for the runescape account. Google auth for the scape account is good. 
---
Do not use your email for any websites other than runescape and never click a runescape link. Always go to the website on your own.

Best tips i can give anyone with a new account.

You can line runelite up so you only need to click on one spot every few seconds.
---
What a top meme 10/10
---
Make cannonballs. One inventory takes over 2 minutes to make. 150k gp/hour.

You just have to complete Dwarf Cannon, and buy a lot of Steel bars.

How would one do that

I had the same thing with me, did they fuck up the clues?

I had 2 b2b same step after the update, 1 time falo and 1 time the guy in elf camp

Are you legitimately arguing for austerity in a video game that people want to play for leisure and fun? 
---
These aren't cheat codes. There's no "challenge" lost in knowing what Jagex means when they have a game mechanic that is described but poorly clarified.
---
No, the changes are to underground pass and regicide, so i was talkng about those.
---
If it was locked to bh world, maybe.
---
If any world does. It's going to stay empty. Do you realice it's an activity that takes 30 seconds per +20 hours of slayer farming keys...

That's not gonna attrack anyone.

PSA: Buying gold from gold sellers ruins the game.

He stopped the 365 thing a couple days ago
---
I think you’re missing his point. OSRS outnumbers RS3 4 or 5:1 depending on the time of day.
---
Good rhetoric but it's nowhere near as intruding as you make it out to be. A small box on the bottom left of your screen saying the name of an NPC and a number beneath is hardly telling you to go somewhere and do something. It also does not have any boss tool-tips that tell you exactly what to do or where to stand, none of that exists. The only egregious case of making pvm easymode right now is the gorilla plugin, everything else is mild QoL stuff.
---
if its any consonalation i see ur point
---
The vanilla client runs terribly in comparison on every pc I've tried it on (my current and previous computers are basically toasters with a screen though)
---
iron?
---
Jagex has proposed the lvl55 as the riskier chest. That's just very mistaken.
---
At this point Jagex should just buy runelite, make it the default client, and hire the devs to manage it for them.
---
I splashed to 99 magic (back when you could do it for 6 hours straight without any interactions) and it took 3 months.
---
Jagex had yet given us another meme template
---
I feel like runelite has just removed a lot of excess clicking that literally would cause carpel tunnel syndrome if i was actually forced to complete that many actions with my mouse to get the same end result as i do with some runelite features. I understand the whole aversion to the easyscape stuff but that's why all plugins are toggleable and you're able to use what you want to and not what you don't. I think runelite has removed the arbitrary excessive clicking and information finding for people who find it unnecessary and like the more simplistic vibe of osrs without all of that stuff.
---
Ye
---
Probably not, we have it now.
---
If you go to chasm of Fire you can cannon and don’t even need to use overheads you can stand in a safe spot right next to your cannon

Yes I've done both, probably each for over 5 hours each

She's the good guy in this situation and you're being a little shit.
---
98% of players wouldn’t do the same if you were afk and missed the drop. You can either be that 2% or split it halfway or find out your own solution, or just keep it. I’d have tele’d before I received the guilt of him knowing who I was lol
---
I got down syndrome reading this post
---
Clicking your mouse.
---
No way, RuneLite is op. If Jagex buys it they'll ruin it.
---
All high end gear is tanking rn... there’s lots of variables but basically comes down to the time of year, increase paranoia around account security (people dumping and investing in buyable skills in case they get hacked),  more coming into the game daily, etc...
---
If you do vorkath or raids consistently with it, there’s no reason to sell it.
---
I absolutely hate that the precedent has been set for menu swapper to be "ok". It's ridiculously overpowered, far more than ahk ever was (and remember that jagex banned use of that?) - I really don't understand how these features are accepted as a part of the game these days.
---
&gt; from revs nonetheless! Awesome achievement!
---
Cheers, i'm glad it's over haha
---
Some scientists think it hasn't gone far enough.
---
That's not due to having no plugins though, that's due to clicking being a lot easier to do with a mouse.
---
Thanks for the info. I haven't played in a while, thought the Craws bow was still 100m. Also, gratz on pking 2147m! Don't see a lot of loot pics of pking compared to the pvm drops, so it's refrrshing to see these type of posts.
---
how'd you get perm muted lmao
---
Yikes
---
Fucking Hero’s
---
The one thing I dislike about this approach is that mobile gets shafted
---
Didn't realize people used that lol, that sounds awful
---
Don't most people pay with bonds anyway..? How many of those games you listed give the player the option to pay with ingame currency?
---
Now I just want to see popular movies redone with RuneScape prayers
---
How is it more secure to remove the authenticator?
---
I originally posted this on /r/Oldschool_Runescape last night right before bed. Someone commented and said I should also post it here, but I didn't see that comment until I woke up today. I followed their advice and posted it. I think maybe someone saved it and posted it here already, but I looked for it before I posted and didn't see it.
---
I mean sure but if you can't click a tile when xarpus looks at you you're actually stupid. Knowing exactly which tile can be tricky though
---
There's a sound in the base game for when you stop fishing. The only thing that doesn't have a sound is motherlode mine, all other things that you could benefit from an idle alert have one.
---
you've made a lot of people angry i'm sure. grats
---
Broke boii
---
That's the point, PvP is a small community and updates will not pass unless Jagex puts it in as some form of PVM or skilling with it, it definitely does add activity but not in the way Pkers would really want it to. Any actual PvP update we've been promised basically never comes, bh rework 2018 by the way! Lms the big pvp minigame turns out to be a 1 tick flick competition!! (At least that's being reworked)
---
Why don’t jagex make runelite their official client but all plugins need to be reviewed and accepted before being put in the game. It’s the ultimate win-win
---
I ran around the G.E. in circles thinking I would find it and eventually just gave up and logged out for the day. Good luck with the grind, I’m finishing Kandarin hard before I start
---
Putting pve/pvm into the wildy doesn't make people more knowledgeable or interested in pvp.
---
That's 99% of this game. That's what OSRS is. If you don't enjoy tedious tasks you won't last long in this game anyway.
---
No, it really doesn't.
---
Reduces (removes?) the chance to fail when pickpocketing.
---
It’s basically only used by irons on the master farmers. I’ve had it for over a year and never used it.
---
splashing needs to be removed. it's a blight on lumbridge and makes no sense. how can you cast the same spell 100k times, never hit your enemy, and claim to be a master of magic?
---
This account could of had 99 slayer untimmed...
---
No lol just wondering how low i can go. im trying bow and cape only rn.
---
I remember coming across that scene of the internet and finding accessibility to DB’s and leaks around 10 years ago, i think this is when it really started to take off. I still remember when sky and reverb posted the loot photos from recovering Chessy
---
It’s only really all come to the surface in the last 5 years or so like you said. I think everyone’s a bit more aware now, and Reddit’s helped people be a bit smarter.
---
You're kidding right? There's plenty of people who play the game on the official client.
---
farm runs on mobile are terrible, you have to long tap so many farmers to cut down trees/pay for protection etc. but the long tap delay is so long that they always move away from your finger before it registers...
---
duel arena with a friend or tourney world is a good place to practice
---
Slow, but basically legal botting.
---
&gt;Adding a delay to the recovery without email is as simple as changing a value.
---
How do you know this? Guaranteed they don't have systems in place for this and they can't just type in a "7" in a box somewhere to delay recoveries by 7 days. They'd have to program in that system.
---
There have been a few instances where runelite features were added into the main game following their success in the client (updated map, certain qol features, etc)
---
I sometimes think jagex needs some inspiration for how these features should look. The people working on runelite are doing great things for the game and the open source nature, I'm sure, helps jagex with design choices.
---
Just go for b gloves, the biggest concern is doing the piety mini game which gives 20k xp so in all melee stats so make sure you won’t hit 61 attack from it. 92 strength with max range and veng is a good basis to start with.
---
341 contributers but there's less than 10 people who are actually trusted devs so 300+ peoples contributions still need to be checked.
---
Having said that adding 10 extra people to the OSRS team just to work on the client would be ridiculous
---
How many of the dharok’s sets are sparc’s? GG bud very impressive.
---
What was your gear set up?
---
I know right I’ve gotta get all set up lol, I’m ready mentally not physically
---
We smited a dude the other night for about 8m in there. Dude had a fully charged BP amongst other shit lol gotta love em
---
It's definitely better than osb.
---
Yes it a phishing link. Jagex will never show you the full uncensored email for privacy reasons. And they wont allow you to cancel these changes. Because you'd be unable to recover your own account when a the hijacker changed it to their email.

Try pking at green dragons north of monastery. Learn how to tribrid edgeville pking is dumb
---
Lol you splash and then do something fun,  come back to some xp. You aren't going to splash if you're actually playing.
---
So if I go 60att 1def, I will ruin the acc if I then convert it to 70def?
---
For some reason it’s very comical to me to picture nerdy developer types having a massive ego and pretentious but that’s exactly what we see from most gaming development companies. I think it stems from people all of the sudden having a lot of power when they had none growing up. Not trying to be mean or condescending either but just saying it like it is.
---
A zenyte shard drop also they drop tons of rune items and rune. Also they drop a d scimmy.
---
The whole point of that high risk chest is to make the area less dead. 
---
The lower risk chest allows you to just teleport out soon as you see a white dot. That alone makes it less risky than anything above lvl 30 wild. You try to equate teleporting to logging out, those two things are completely incomparable.
---
Ardy cape is good if your bridging with rapier/ancients and don’t want to risk inf cape.
---
&gt; decent risk / reward
---
Noted bones and pkers +1 at altar is pretty decent.
---
The link below is real I think, but the cancel email button links you to 1 different link, and into the scam(?) Website where you put your info

Okay sweaty
---
Barrows would be a kick stater, biggest thing I can say is work towards piety, mory/fally hard and then do some barrows/mole. Theyre pretty decent income for a lower tier boss.
---
I love being able to play on mobile but missing all those RuneLite features is a killer.
---
Find a cpu with the performance of a q6600 at least, anything less isn't even worth buying these days.
---
She basically killed both of the demonic gorillas. I was the one being useless sitting in a safe spot
---
Recovery answers are not a thing on runescape, and for those who have older accounts that still have recovery questions, those are the lowest value information you could possibly give for account recovery. This is a non-issue.
---
Thought of that post once i saw their tweet. Was a good suggestion bro^^
---
Giant seaweed is a base chance of 1/7500, which is the same as like fruit trees, but it grows in 40 minutes and is also decent profit. There's also two patches. Tack it on to the end of birdhouse runs for sure if you do those.
---
Here's a link to the drop rates :) (the listed is base chance, actual chance is found by a formula, but for giant seaweed at 99, its about 1/5000).

---
What's the plugin called?
---
That's not quite how it works. RuneLite injects code, it's not something Jagex could use themselves. Look up reverse engineering to learn more about it, it's a fascinating subject.

The myth comes from back in the days of dung, where better logs made longer lasting fires and reduced chance to burn the food.

You really don't get it. Lets say the lads wanna play apex. You say ok, gimme 5 minutes,  setup your splash,  boot up apex. Play a first person shooter with the lads for a few hours,  alt tab, bam, 50k magic xp WHILE PLAYING APEX LEGENDS.  That's why you splash.
---
Rip, I don't use this email for gaming lel
---
I know what it means.
---
Don't remind me.. back when those items came out the bow was 400m. Skulltricked a few of them back then. This tab doesn't include anything that was skulltricked, that's a whole nother beast that one...
---
I hadn't seen that. My bad. I just thought it was funny and wanted to share it. I did look for it before I posted though. I usually only share OC, but I thought this meme hadn't been here yet.
---
definitely barrows.
---
pick up some barrows tabs look up a guide and you'll be fine. 
---
Barrows wiki strategy guide is good for gear and maybe watch a youtube video or two to watch what's going on. Also try to only use 1-2 doses of prayer pot per trip. Those add up over time and cut into your profit.
---
Not gonna lie, I dont know zookeeper personally but I have over 30k rev kc and I see him out in caves pking all the time. Doubt this is faked
---
This dude should be a comedian with his commentary. Jagex give this man for comedic relief
---
They literally had a decompiled version of the client checked into the github repository. I don’t know why you’re trying to downplay how stupid of a move it was for them to ever be distributing copyrighted content publicly. I’m sure the osbuddy relationship didn’t help but don’t act like taking jagexs intellectual property and illegally redistributing it wasn’t a major issue.
---
right, but if he hacked accounts and stole wealth from players, then him selling high value account info either during his time at jagex or as he was fired really isn't farfetched. OP never said it's 100% concrete proof he just said he's thoroughly convinced, and the only argument i see against it is the fact that we're probably seeing more and more people being hacked because more and more people are realising reddit is the best way to get jagex's attention and get their help
---
Any rough sense of what supplies cost was?
---
It's his own fault. He has no one to be mad at but himself. Plus whip drops aren't that rare from abby demons.

20 minutes,  after every game of apex I'd send a chat and click a rat then back to apex.

Quick, what’s the number to 911?
---
You could technically do it as soon as you get to Morytania, no other requirements, but the lower your level the less profit you’ll make.  I’ve been doing them at a loss since I finished priest in peril simply cause I enjoy the mini game, and you do get lucky from time to time even at low levels (just got a dharoks greataxe the other day).  That said most guides recommend 70s or higher and enough prayer for overheads.

Every game you posted about being free is absolutely littered with mtx.

Well you do find stuff, just nothing that is interesting.

A lot are just "fluff" in the world... some are quest chests that require special conditions to get something out of, but yeah dont sweat too much thinking about it

you're entitled to your opinion

Those Ogres are seriously good for low level ironman, go there with 3k fire strikes and walk a rich man with plenty of runes.
---
You are wrong on that one. If nobody fell for it, then nobody would scam. Clearly, enough people fall for it to be profitable.  There are plenty fish in the sea.
---
How did you stay alive against clans? i'm fairly nooby and have ventured the rev caves a few times as a level 95. I know my account is basically right in the money range where everyone in the rev caves can attack me.
---
But still. It seemed to me like massive clans of 8+ would all appear at once via world hop like every 5 minutes and just clean out the place. **With it being multi and often times having Tele block + Ice barrage on you, how is it possible that any can survive as a solo in the Rev caves?**
---
I legitimately dont understand it lol, sorry for the noob question.
---
I like how you only have one note instead of people able to talk like a normal person.
---
Have you tried using OSBuddy's client and enabling the GPU plugin? I have a 2013 and it still uses a lot of my (old) CPU but I'm wondering since the newer ones have better GPUs, would it be smoother and less straining for the CPU?
---
I just toggle it on for farm runs or bankstanding skills where I need to interact with NPCs a lot.
---
Take it with a pinch of salt, this is what people are saying.
---
Does that work with gpu rendering?
---
lol what? botters have their own clients, they dont need runelite.
---
You can try and beat the game with any style you want to be honest but the reason everyone uses magic is that the brothers have like negative magic defence, you can hit hard with your spells even wearing rune Armour, that sort of thing.  If you really want to melee them I’d say you have to have very high levels.  That said you don’t need 69 mage, I’ve been doing it since around lvl 50 and managed to kill a few brothers.  Higher stats will always help.  I recommend you just go and give it a trial run, if you die your equipment stays on the ground and you can go back and pick it up (happened to me many times).  Or just go in 3item just to feel out how the game works, etc.  Once you get the hang of it it’s not too bad.
---
It's about sending a message.
---
Been away for a bit, what's going on here? What was the problem and how is it fixed?
---
Teaks and mahoganies can only be grown on fossil island, not in normal tree patches.  Teaks are so cheap they are almost free.  
---
Don't bother with maples or higher trees unless you have money to blow and want to level faster.  Stick with fruit trees and hardwoods (teak/mahog).
---
I hope this comment doesn't go unnoticed. I salute you, my man

That’s his new account, I’d bet a ton of money
---
 But it wasn’t.
---
Jagex has said a couple of times that there has been no discernible increase in accounts being compromised. Some highly publicized reddit posts where people had positive results have resulted in an increase in the number of those posts here however.
---
What?! 
---

No other drop too

Bruh.

As someone who started barrows runs at similar stats maybe even lower, I will say for op it’s doable but you’ll be burning money.  No profit at these levels in my experience unless you get lucky roll on the chest.  The tunes don’t make up the cost of the food and prayer pots you need to make it through:

Jagex: 3rd party clients are now banned
---
It'll honestly piss me off if Jagex decides to just add authenticator removal delay because reddit keeps crying about it, instead of updating their recovery system to be more secure, which is what is actually needed.
---
-&gt;Last 7 levels are agility LuL
---
Dude don't even worry. You can honestly learn everything you need to learn before the mages arrive. I've been on the inferno grind for 2.5 weeks and it took me like 3-4 days to get to mages. Now I'm getting to zuk consistently. You can do it!!
---
Definitely threaten them with lawsuits if it comes to it
---
interesting, may try that. have you tried it? any idea on experience rates?
---
Killer update
---
Why take people off actual game content development projects and force them to do quality of life updates like this when a separate company is doing it themselves and not costing Jagex money?
---
accepting new members? reqs?
---
Surprise surprise most folks don't hang out in the wild, you know, that one place where they could be ganked by a random nerd and lose all their stuff.
---
World hopping and logging is the biggest issue with the wild tbh. Being in the wild should force to to remain logged in and on whichever world you're on. I would actually attempt some of the wild content if that were the case. But I understand that makes it difficult for full time pvp people to get their dopamine
---
People don’t realize that, and they just reeee at you for splashing.
---
Also, grats on finishing the goal. I'm hoping that means I'll be seeing you out in the caves less but I'm not getting my hopes up. Lol
---
W
---
Yes, yes keep dropping.
---
Can’t tell if troll or genuinely doesn’t understand that this isn’t what subliminal messaging is.

These are incredibly helpful guides that explain necessary mechanics to understand if you ever want to get anywhere PKing, Best of luck and ignore everyone who's toxic because they'll get the best of you if you don't. &lt;3
---
It's always racism or threats of violence
---
Playing devil's advocate, but couldn't the 2 pkers just go open the chest themselves and share the loot? Or go sell the loot from chests and share the gp? 
---
It feels like the only reason pkers would want to keep the keys themselves is for stacking and opening them all at once, in which case, if they choose to restrict themselves in that way, is it really that inconvenient to get pked for the 5 keys?
---
That's a terrible idea. Then they are responsible for what runelite releases. Remaining disconnected makes it safer for them
---
Let's not forget that it's 95 magic
---
like lol just barrage at that point
---
Yea, I get that and tbh I probably would have moved but I had been there 5 minutes (had runelites npc aggro timer on). 
---
Either way he started being a dick about it, so I dug my heels in and just stood my ground. Mature? No. Satisfying? 100%
---
i think your spot on its a shame really, because this game is so enjoyable even without all this efficiency stuff.
---
I'm not your bro man dude bud, chief.
---
Or it's almost like they're working on a grandmaster quest with a gigantic new city and multiple pieces of boss content and therefore don't have time/resources to dedicate to regular quality updates...
---
Yep, it's basically turning into the same cancer as the main game. Except this time jagex gave the casual scum the option to vote on it.
---
Congrats on getting the account back. Kinda sad that the appeals and stuff were denied so much at first . Maybe RS will take customer support and account security serious someday .
---
Merch it. I made over 5m merching the lance in the past 20hours
---
Yes, he literally states it in the title.
---
I lost all my chins at kree as I forgot about their drop mechanics. Can relate.
---
Nope the point is that you can afk for 20mins at a time
---
My brain somehow read it as 'rune elite' and I thought I was missing out on some elite version of Runelite all this time...
---
Summoning
---
This ^ I like Pugger because he's not a freaky good pker or Pvmer. He just does really interesting stuff
---
Someone told me the way they got theirs approved (they pay via Paypal like me) was to list off every single date of a transaction with Jagex.  Not sure if that's what changed things, but that's the thing I added this time.
---
Wow, you are the 6th person to see this person, with the same comment, wearing the same outfit
---
MaxScape
---
Same
---
How, ive got no idea even howmuch more its gonna drop
---
Get a new processor, it’s bottlenecking up the ass
---
I mean I read your post but it says nothing about any co-conspirators. The only possible way I could interpret that was by Kelvin saying "they", which doesn't necessarily mean several people but a gender-neutral way to refer to someone (assumedly in the interest of keeping the identity unknown).
---
I'm kinda confused on the google doc as well. The first part says that Jed leaked d-spear nerfs and has a note with an image that has nothing to do with the claim, instead it's a screenshot talking about how Jagex is going to release rev cavs, something that seemed kinda obvious since they release most updates on thursdays. Rest of the links don't really have solid evidence and seem to be speculation on what could have happened.
---
If jagex did do that, Im sure people would disagree as it ruins the 'old school' feel of it
---
Because it would take the jagex devs twice as long to do a job half as good. It makes their workload so much easier by simply allowing 3rd party clients to continue running.
---
yeah i didn't want to get too deep in the weeds since fire surge was the example he chose. regardless, i can't think of a way that training mage in nmz could hit breakeven, let alone be profitable.
---
I sold at 170 jsyk
---
is this a new pasta
---
I bought it for 115m and it crashed rip. Made it back via vork and brutal blacks. Im just gonna use it to get 96-99 range and eat the cost. Hopefully ill get a vorki or visage in the process. I doubt it'll dip below 95mish.
---
Just run a Windows VM and use that solely for OSRS. Can even use it in Seamless mode with most VM software (VirtualBox is free) so you can manipulate the window as if it was a native MacOS application. Just make sure to allocate it some video memory in the settings and you're golden.
---
I spent so many nights playing Crash Bash vs AI
---
Why can’t you hop instead of spending time on useless conversation?
---
It’s gonna be going down for at least a couple more days imo.  Use g.e tracker or the grand exchange to help you come up with a price.
---
You could just default boot in windows since its superior anyway
---
Idek bro something is obviously wrong with this guy

Im in the same boat. Typical my luck. Had to sell my entire bank

Oof. It's rare to see someone who is **this** sure of themselves say something this fucking stupid. Fantastic work, A+.

If you want to bring guthans, just swap out legs/helm for the Guthans counter part and bring along the spear in and pl8 in inventory, everything else will be the same.
---
Runelite operates client-side, changing information on a surface level that it receives from RS servers. It would be much harder, costly, and time consuming to make these changes on a server level of development. Plus, why put in all that work if a crowd-sourced operation is doing it for you for free? And since it is non-profit and relies on Jagex resources, it is not a direct threat to the company.
---
I don't get it? Is this supposed to be humor?
---
It’s less than 1/10th of a difference. Is it really that hard to say “yeah that’s not that big of a difference in terms of a 1/512 drop rate”
---
Alright . Thanks

Oh so I get more stuff on rl than osbuddy if I'm dont play for the client?

Ie less options are cornered off under premium access?

&gt;Torso is definitely worth. I would just get torso and try to save up money for Tassets/Prims before BCP anyways.

Repost
---
They don’t need to team up. Working together in a sense of not being direct enemies and sending lawyers.   Jagex can say we will leave you alone unless you cross the line. (Like they did once).
---
There's no way you have GPU on your macOS RuneLite, because macOS doesn't support the OpenGL library.
---
[https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/6482](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/6482)

I'd say open up your settings again, and look at the switch. It should be off, and if you flip it on, it will flip off next time you open the settings. I have a MBP with a GPU and I would love to be proven wrong.

People play this game with sound on? I don't think I have ever turned the sound on in the 5 years I've played.

ya i browse by new on desktop but when i just went to take a shit i found the original post from 3 hours ago and was like dammit. oh well, point stands. just attribute the praise the nebulous person who created it (prob not the person who posted it 3 hours ago anyway)

Prevents a hijacker who managed to get access to my acc from:
---
Accessing the bank
---
Ruining the acc (pure,hcim)
---
Raiding the inventory.

Certainly does mitigate/solve issues.

I know for a fact the times I was hacked via acc recovery th(whilst I was actively playing the account) that this would have saved me.
---
You are factually wrong.

No no I think you are right, idk wtf I’ve been thinking. Lmao I have been DREADING this for months but now I’m finding out it isn’t a req
---
The amulet in the mouth thing reminds me of Courtney Wheeler from Bob’s Burgers (that girl who always sucks on her locket).
---
Honestly sometimes it's just a personal thing. I do not like training magic so I splashed before I could just ice burst dusties/nechs

Also really hated in the F2P ironman community. The hated how Ogres changed the entire meta since every end goal now is basically camp Ogres.

Random story time..  
---
  
---
Back pre-EOC I was quitting the game, only mid level 80.. Base 60ish stats but wanted to give my account away. I pm'ed some guy fighting guards outside V West bank if he wanted my account no strings attached...  
---
He was interested, but sceptical. I gave him my account details, logged onto my pure to talk to him, he logged in and was super excited to have my account, it had no money etc on it, but was a better account than his.  
---
He wanted to trade over all his items to my old account, but wasn't able to for some reason. This was back when everybody was a noob. Including me, It was harder to multi-log. You'd open to browsers and press login on the same world at the same time and hope you were quick enough.  
---
He asked me to login to his account, and trade them over for him. And freely without hesitation gave me his login details..  
---
I wasn't an asshole, but could have easily cleaned his whole back, got my account back and just bounced. But thankfully even a young idiot. I couldn't do it morally.  
---
I still remember his password was "Ilikedrinkingpepsi"  
---
End of random story time, time I never went out to scam, but had the opportunity and couldn't do it.  
---
I did give him the account, but recovered it when oldschool was released. Not much progress on the account anyway. All's good. I hope he had a good few years on it.

Idk man, it’s like if I’m gonna put 2 hrs a night into playing, I don’t like the idea of spending the whole 2 hours grinding RC to not even see a level in that night at 60 RC lol compared to being able to idle my phone all day next to me at work occasionally having to click every 5 mins or so and get it passively

The only thing as AFK as splashing is NMZ. Your suggestions of things to do are just stupid because they require a significant amount more attention. Splashing and normal mode absorb NMZ are the only 2 things that can be done AFK for a long period.
---
Just live your asshole beforehand

It involves a lure people would use to stop you from picking up your items once you drop them

then quit kid

Taken from update log from [16 May 2019](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/farming-improvements-and-rebalancing-existing-content?oldschool=1). If it's not working as intended then I guess report it in game, or try and get a gif/video of this supposed bug and post it on this sub. But it should have been fixed a month ago
---
So the 2 options are figure out an hour+ weird light maze puzzle by yourself that could be ridiculously confusing for some, or you still have the tedious work but nail it down to only take so much time.
---
On his alt YT account, there’s a video that shows him using Runelite.
---
Don’t people usually splash curse?
---
they stated in the original release that jed never even had access to that data, so it couldn’t have been related to him. They’ve confirmed that in the Q&amp;As since
---
u/JagexGambit why do you keep hiring silly immature player moderators dude uhhhhhh bread??? wtf is this LOL
---
For me it took like a 5ish days mining after work to get full prospector (so like 13-15 hours), starting at 60 mining and ending at 69ish mining. So depending on your level it will probably take closer to 8.
---
Yes and I agree. However the fact that resource gathering locations are highly competitive gives an incentive to get to that point. Also it's a whole lot less time to get to corsair then zulrah. My point isnt that it corsair cove is going to become a hotbed of bot activity. Just that it isnt as sheltered of a location is OP believes and a botter that doesnt want to fight over resources could easily get there.
---
Or just use RL?
---
Best thing you can do for an old Mac!

---
GPU and Ground Items is all they really need.
---
I'd argue that people being at ease is why their accounts get compromised in the first place. They think it won't happen to them because they can spot the more obvious phishing attempts, and have a bank pin and a good password, but that isn't good enough anymore.
---
What would have helped in your case is to secure your account properly in the first place. Players need to know that things like an authenticator on your account and email, along with unique passwords aren't optional extra security, they \*are\* the security, and they need all of them if they want to truly protect their stuff.
---
Of course there's a lot of room for Jagex to improve with regards to account security, but a warning that tells you that your account is sunk and that you should immediately move all valuables to a different one isn't going to fight the biggest problem which is player negligence.
---
i mean like my main has 96 rc, i have an alt with 89 and my uim has 54 rn so yeah kinda okay skill. the only reason i kind of like slayer is because of the money
---
You do realize the JMods aren't the upper management of the company? They still have people who are over them.

That's not quite how it works. RuneLite injects code, it's not something Jagex could (or would want to) use themselves. Look up reverse engineering to learn more about it, it's a fascinating subject.

Funny enough, in rs3 they changed it so that you have to give the chef untradeable versions of egg flour and milk so that you cant just buy it before the quest and finish it in two seconds.

Don't hurt yourself reaching like that.

Seriously. Let's talk about Rampart, folks!
---
People are allowed to have different goals than you. This is a second account I made for f2p pking. I wouldn’t splash on my main. But I want to keep the hp down on this account, hence splashing. Not a waste in this instance.

I'm in a high level pvm clan and the amount of people doing this is hilarious. Solid logic, sell all your items when they're all at the lowest they've ever been worth. What could go wrong?
---
Do you stream? Ive either seen you stream or in pk streams lol
---
Amazing. Now do it again
---
I know most people here will agree with you, but I honestly think there's nothing wrong with splashing. It's so insanely slow and costs money to invest in at low levels. I don't think the amount of afk you can do with it is *that* bad, skills like fishing let you stand there and fish then after a few minutes drop it all if you want the fastest xp/h, which can feel about as afk to do.
---
Also maybe I'm weird, but seeing all the people splashing in Lumbridge adds some personality to the game. It's an in joke, a thing we can jab at and go "yeah, this is a weird Runescape quirk." As a recent noob, I wasn't annoyed by the splashers, I was intruiged and wondering "What's going on here? I wanna figure out what this is!"

It’s like real life, you don’t have to hold the door open for someone, but you do because you were raised well. Same applies to hopping.

Oh. So you chose to limit yourself?
---
A lot of "smackdowns" point at that, plus a lot of high level pvmers either talk about rwting or get banned for it. 
---
Also kinda an elimination of odds sorta thing, idk I can't see jagex having passwords/recovery information unhashed so I don't see how it can be easily leaked but maybe I'm naïve.
---
Proof either way is basically anecdotal, I just tend to the side that jagex aren't that deep level of incompetence required for these issues, while players can easily have lax security or want to cash out. I could be wrong of course and I'm very open to actual evidence either way.
---
Yeah.

They literally just stole that plugin from runelite+

Wow I got double boots on iron at like 15kc

On your last point, dunno about anyone else but literally the only reason I go into the f2p wildy is for mining runite, pvm in the wildy just isn't worth it imo when you can kill literally the same thing outside of the wildy (same goes for any other activities too, why risk when you can do the same thing safely)

Super ranged potions, durrrrrrr. I wasn't using them, ty. And thanks, maybe I'll do the math when I'm not at work. Overall, it's looking like just doing crabs with Mitch darts is the way to go tbh
---
I did say almost always, yes some items will drop as more come into the game but very slowly so slowly that it's not worth trying to sell/re-buy to try and recuperate on losses like so many people do , very rarely does an item just tank for no reason and never return unless there's some sort of update/realisation that people didn't know before.

I'm not sure it's possible to buy a laptop that can't play OSRS.
---
So I only ever played f2p and used to grind a lot several years ago. I'm currently playing on an account I started a week or two ago. Once I get enough money for a bond, how do I learn about member only stuff? It just seems like there is so much. Any good resources?
---
It's basically is osb pro was free and was better than osb pro
---
Not even over droprate yet smh. Stop crying.
---
If you use a brine saber you don't have to salt them at all. In case anyone out there is still playing these guys.
---
Someone who rags with bolts I guess
---
Yea my bad! Updated.
---
Osbuddy makes u pay for features runelite does for free
---
That's the most basic way of putting it
---
"I like challenges, but when they require time or skill thats too much for me"
---
Clearly just a shitty excuse and you trying to justify your own inadequacy.
---
Hard disagree there. With that logic I should barrage for mage xp at NMZ and just ignore the go cost
---
Oh boy, this will be so helpful for my Ultimate Ironman progress.
---
Well there goes one of the best f2p money-makers
---
Huh
---
This happened to me and appeal got my account back. They can very easily tell that your account was recovered from a different location and botted. If that is the case an appeal will work but takes approx 1 month at least when I did it.
---
"Good boy. All 7,165 of you."
---
the real problem is pking is vastly removed from any other content in the game, so you could be the best pvmer in the world but you'd have no idea what was going on half the time in a pvp fight.   
---
In most games pvp and pvm at least share some overlap,
---
Only being able to catch 10-15 at a time then needing to run hoping you can out eat a pker and tele out doesn’t really change my initial statement that black chins aren’t a viable source of money without imp box...
---
it's been around before that post even as a runelite+ plugin and is also what this is, ripped 1:1
---
You would likely get much more from other elements as well needless to say you would be famous in the computing world.
---
3rd age druidic set :)
---
Later, virgins!
---
Can I legit just repeatedly try to solo raids 1? Like I think I got the hang of it down, but the problem seems to be that I can't scout, because I use normal client or osbuddy, I do not like runelite for some reason, I have it though, I might have to learn to use it for raids.
---
Will I lose anything if I repeatedly just try to do raids 1? or just lots of patience?
---
I recently got 95 slayer and have done 1 hydra task so far. My pb is 2:19 but I average around 2:30-3 minutes. I have 99 range, blessed dhide, anguish, archer (I), and bp with addy darts. The wiki says I should be getting 20 kills an hour but I’m probably getting like 18 with the delayed respawn and getting 10-15 kills per trip. Does this seem like normal times for my gear?
---
*unzips lizard suit*
---
All I see is a deleted post :)
---
Pause
---
You can't train agility with 1 click every 20 mins bro
---
Repetitionscape
---
the people who actually play the game knows better than the majority of the game. weve seen how ezscape poll results have leaned more and more towards yes voer the years from the new/returning noob players that vote naively and selfishly. so no i dont think catering to the majority is sustainable over time as more new naive players join.
---
Exactly. Us 2011 fans came to OSRS for the old combat system. Not for the lack of PvM content, and to be fair Jagex has done an amazing job giving us RS2 content so far. Raids 1 was sort of like Dungeoneering and raids 2 as well, especially with the party size limit. They gave us GWD and Corp as well. Without these four updates, end-game PvM would be Dagannoth Kings and Kalphite Queen lol.
---
Except there are better places to barrage things. You can 100% use fire blast/wave/surge in nightmarezone though. It’s actually decent exp too since you don’t have to splash and everything stays agrod.  barraging is a bad example because you won’t ever hit 9 things in nmz. 
---
If you are truly worried about the cost of whatever you are doing then don’t use nmz, go do slayer. Also if you buy herb boxes with your nmz points it will save some money on your arrow margins.
---
Just spent an hour down in the zammy wines cave tele grabbing, didn't run into a single pker/person. I thought it would be poppin!
---
Uninterrupted, I grabbed about 650 wines in an hour.
---
&gt;but muh freeze peach
---
Wiki suggests I have 60 agility for Underground Pass. I have 55 agility. With a summer pie and that stat extending prayer would I be fine?
---
Super range pots are good but I’d suggest overloads as they don’t go down each minute, and give a higher boost. If you are doing the absorb method it synergies as well.
---
He look as scared as me when I walked in on my parents
---
Grats
---
The reason I like it is because its something I can do while I'm at work. It's completely shit xp. and expensive after a while. But its nice that I can focus on melee and range when doing slayer at home, and my magic level doesnt get super far behind. I will probably only do it til I get 70 or 75 on my ironman, but its nice to have an option.
---
I do hate that so many do it in lumbridge, there are too many annoying things in lumbridge that have to be the first things new players see. even in the basement is annoying af. So I do my part and go to varrock sewers and splash on giant rats
---
you can already do this with runelite
---
Botting: Get xp without playing,  splashing:  get xp without playing
---
Wait so mod ash is taken 😢😫
---
Link doesn’t work for me on mobile
---
Level 41 their, even spent a day just killing guards
---
&gt; Skulltricked a few of them back then
---
Weren't you apart of the 4 noted item drop lure team on release? You guys got a little more than "a few".
---
Best of luck man, hope you get it fixed
---
Black demons from duradel are great. On Konar tasks yoy can't do gorillas though which is sad
---
They are also nerfing black d hide.
---
Yeah you will very likely have to since it's a low chance of getting the plus 5. Make sure you are prepared to quickly get everything you need from your bank if it isn't in your inventory so the boost doesn't run out. Using the preserve prayer helps with this. It's annoying trying to get the boost but just be patient :)
---
Its been awesome watching your art style improve over the years (btw the detail you put on both the bats are amazing) and i hope you continue to grow as a artist. If Jagex hasn't contacted you to make merch for them yet idfk what they're thinking
---
People will defend the most popular client that is widely used with no issues and will discourage people from using unknown clients with sketchy aspects. Color me shocked stupid ledditors amirite
---
Good thing you have access to the actual numbers instead of just assuming a generalized opinion based on feelings and opinions among your peer groups.
---
Adding an endgame monster for f2p players to grind out bonds with are a good thing for a huge chunk of f2p. F2p ironmen are vocal minority and should be treated as such
---
you're going to need to farm a lot of orange spices, yes. i haven't had to construct anything in a while but i very vividly remember going through four full bottles for a +5 so i could build a portal nexus. don't bother hunting the regular rats, farm the behemoth hell rats and use karambwanji to heal your cat.
---
Damn, I'm so glad they hacked your brand new account, and not the other players who have over 20b on their accounts.
---
Luckily you can bank them, so then you can do teleporting. Of course you have to take them from bank between each teleport, but better that than walk around.
---
You know what's sad about this comment, we already have a 3 day delay option. A bank pin, but half the fucking idiots on this reddit 
---
claim that a bank pin can be bruteforced with ease and with that logic you pretend that its useless. Realistically, if you have a bank pin that isn't something obvious like your birth date or something the hacker will have to disable it which takes 3 days.
---
Honestly had no idea all these years that you can cannon the mole...
---
Wtf of course their going to steal your account, why would you download a client unaffiliated with official runelite but obviously trying to be a clone.
---
The team that handles abuse reports is very active, and they do act on these reports. A quick google/reddit search will prove it. Why would you be upset about the report button being used for its intended purpose?
---
So you're telling me maxed mains don't have the gear to complete the inferno? 
---
Lol no. They all have the gear. They just don't do it.
---
I know several 2277 total people that dont even try inferno because they're too busy doing "pet hunts" or making some sort of ironman alt. 
---
Bottom line is they don't want to participate in mechanically challenging content. They just want to mindlessly grind and see the numbers go up.
---
You'll see them go crazy if a top tier money maker as challenging as the inferno gets added.
---
They'll go insane crying "not everyone has good internet" or some other excuses.
---
For what, playing games and using very specialized software that the developers haven't bothered releasing or optimizing for other platforms? That's the single thing I can think of, besides just being used to the shitty desktop environment. I don't even own a mac btw, but fucking winbloat shills needs to chill out.
---
F2P is fucking lit
---
If I’m already at 50 def and fine with where I’m at would it be worth it to get the fighter torso? Or just keep grinding out until obsidian?
---
Omg, mind is blown
---
You should edit this into your main post, I think you’ve confused people into thinking the official runelite has some kind of plus variant.
---
have combo food, know how to tank, recognize and react early when a clan is going to hit you and book it either over agility gap south or straight north and head for single. the occasional death is inevitable but you can cut down on it by being aware. most larger clans are not going to chase one guy very far if you haul ass north, and most ones that do are easy to tank if you have a good inventory setup (angler shark brew, pnecks, switching prayers, etc)
---
I feel like I’d go back to paying for osbuddy for the features
---
Can anyone think of any other game with a situation like this? Base game is honestly depressing after runelite
---
I mean, sometimes you gotta run thru multi to get to non multi areas. Just being a turd tho
---
Just because it exists doesn’t mean it has honor
---
also give thirst effect similar to desert heat
---
I don't see how this isn't obvious to people. RuneLite Plus was not made by the RuneLite team. That should be enough to trigger alarm bells. That said, RuneScape players are infamous for how poor their concepts of account security are, so I guess it shouldn't be a surprise.
---
Most guys come over to fuck your mom. I just come for the lasagna.
---
No lie I got muted in August of 2006 for calling a guy a crackhead at Camelot bank.
---
15 def is the new meta anyways 🤷‍♀️
---
Jk, best of luck, all my accounts are 13/15 def. sounds like a cool build!
---
It's time to put down the drugs.

OP sounds salty as fuck, no concrete evidence?  Only hey they did this and i say it therefore its true? LUL

Been using rl+ from the start, ttl 2200+, no issues with it..

looking at the way you are typing, you might be viral LUL

Im in "kornhub" it's 420 friendly and pretty active. my rsn is holden woods find me in there and add me!
---
Hey man, fellow artist here, your drawings look amazing, however if i can offer one tip, you use one level of highlight, one level of color, and one lecel of shading. A cool rule ive found is if you have 2 layers of shadow, it adds hella more depth to a drawing. Good job overall though and keep at it!
---
Not like you risk anything in pvm anymore
---
The trustworthy guy actually gave him the knife.  Then scammer created an account identical to that of trustworthy guy requesting the knife back, saying he had a better one.
---
Found the shill.
---
And then they make reddit threads like “I was muted for no reason!” Comes out later they were in the wild calling everyone the n word and telling them they wanna cut their mom’s head off...
---
Heals 1 hp 50% of the time and 0 the other 50% maybe.
---
This happened to my friend years and years ago and he got moved to lumby after posting on the forums, i think? I forget how he got moved or contacted jamflex but he ended up there with all of his stuff completely untouched.
---
As the other person said, you'll want to level str to 99 first, atk to 99, then 99 def for most efficiency. But keep in mind that you shouldn't really be using Dharoks until around 92+-2 HP, because Obby Set/Berkserker Necklace/Obby Sword outdps.
---
yes, absolutely. barb assault is a giant pain in the dick, but you're going to need to do it eventually for diaries and, practically speaking, fighter torso will be your best in slot for the entire game. it's got the same strength bonus as a 15m piece of gear.
---
i'd say if you're going to buy any piece of obsidian buy the legs, which will be your bis until you get tassys.
---
True, sirpugger will probably have a bot busting video on this new spawn
---
Pker/ alt account can enter in a members world then hop to his world to kill him

---
I report racial and homophobic slurs, not because I’m offended by them but because I know that they’re one of the few that you can cop a mute for and it cracks me up.
---
They aren't trying to be a 1:1 clone, and more than enough people already blindly trust regular RL, OSB, and other 3rd-party clients.
---
RL+ specifically has "non-Jagex-approved" plugins, which people interested in will of course find RL+ to be worth a try.
---
But why when you can go down the stairs in the kitchen and splash on spiders that my cat can't eat?
---
Well, whatever the reason, I’m proud of you for embracing and accepting that it was your fault and not saying stuff like “they muted for no reason” when we all know those people got muted for a reason...
---
its not trying to be a clone, it has the plugins in it that jagex banned, such as blackjacking and zulrah. why even comment if you dont have any idea wtf you are talking about
---
Exactly! Glad someone enjoys it as much as I do.
---
its a very common phenomenon, its not some echo chamber bullshit. it goes for almost any games. you can just google how casual gamers ruin games or something and get an in depth explanation on how they ruin games. the tldr is that they dont care for putting in effort for their achievements and fun and forcing devs to make it easier to cater to them for more money
---
Man your gonna hate me when i tell you i got it on kc 13
---
They're decently priced enterprise-quality laptops with a decent Unix-style OS that is fairly user-friendly. Inb4 retards start to sperg about the pricing -- just check the prices of other brand's enterprise lines which have comparable build quality, like Dell XPS/latitude, Lenovo Thinkpad, etc. I personally don't like them due to how limited your access to the hardware is, but only complete dimwits would deny that they are great for the consumers which they are targeting.
---
Thanks a lot. I had no idea about that. Most of the achievements I've placed on the back burner
---
Upvoted because once I failed 13 I went 20 and failed 20 and now I’m 25 ...
---
Remember when jagex wanted to ban runelite but not osbuddy?
---
🦀 Gang 🦀 remembers

Great for F2p, yes.

Nah it's cool x

So why’s there a report button for seriously offensive language?

The reason why I didn't think it had to do with OSRS money is because she begged people not to file any charges. Plus, the text messages don't mention anything about the game. But oh ok :o
---
I got ~900 or so just from 80-90 Rellekka I'm pretty sure (didn't bank at all or do anything else during that grind lmao).
---
'' wtf I ate ''
---
And being afraid for your son's legal security while also feeling terrible that he's apparently, in your understanding, a bona fide scammer that can be arrested for it
---
Lot of love shown in her desperate attempt to help undo his wrongs and stop them from ruining his life.  Even if she was way overestimating the scope here
---
While I don't trust these things, there is in fact zero evidence provided, just a he said.
---
You are actually fucking retarded. Have a nice day sperg.
---
Why did you make this thread on a throwaway account? Seems like you have an agenda.
---
I actually enjoyed going back to zulrah for a bit after I didn't wanna do BP vork. DHCB vork is so fucking easy and the ability to have 5+ kill trips at 90 range 90 def was soooo good. I was lucky to get 2 with BP and bgs don't know if I'm just bad or what lol. But zulrah was nice to come back to because it was actually engaging and I had to think just the right amount to make it not a pain in the ass.
---
Go see your family.
---
Venz were already in the game. This just provided them an alternative to making gp.
---
Botting an account to Zulrah stats is fairly easy esp as a lot of players pay someone to train the agility by hand, there are tons of scripts that will actually bot zulrah decently too
---
RL+ isn't standalone, it needs RL to work.
---
Any pro tips?
---
Sept 2014 and it only passed by 1%. Pretty crazy how the game completely changed direction so quickly after it was added. Would love to see how different the game would be without it. So many things changed/added under the guise of QoL etc that were essentially just ironmen updates.
---
Also the fastest way for ironmen to die in the wilderness, I know FOR SURE some pkers are going to sit there solely to get some ironmen kills. Its also going to become bot central in a few months, its not going to be very profitable but im sure some pkers wont mind stopping there every once and a while to get a little chunk of cash for free off a bot.
---
Look, I have no dog in this fight either way, but purposely using shitty tactics to gain users is a bad sign.
---
Stone, probably
---
Cause you fill your shitty client with ezscape plugins that Jagex + Runelite team decided were unfair?
---
You realize 7 or 8 comments take maybe ten minutes to make?
---
a very very smaller number were yes, but this update made it so they can make 5x the ammt of money in the same time
---
They certainly are, but we shouldn't make changes, or refuse to make changes, just because of how it affects such a small subset of players. If f2p needs something, we shouldn't refuse that thing just because it breaks f2p ironmen.
---
Haven't kept up with announcements much, has the final crystal armor design been shown or is it still being tweaked? Last I saw was the strawpoll of four different rough sketches.
---
I actually loved the clan citadel update in when it originally came out, so i'd be excited to have something like that in OSRS.
---
Which is short for "should have" not "should of"
---
Is there a trick to not getting your prayer completely drained that I’ve missed? I have 60 prayer, most of it is gone just after fighting one brother, if I’m lucky.  I haven’t tried the tele out to recharge method, I guess I sort of thought that would waste a barrows tab, but now that I think about it, one prayer pot is like the price of 3 barrows tabs.  Will have to try that next time I feel like a run there.
---
I didn’t even notice that
---
You're right, I edited my comment for clarity.
---
Not the client we want.... But the client we deserve.
---
It's not required but yes it is recommended because it eases off the load if you don't know what to do. [Synq's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DK-tztm6c&amp;t=5s) goes into depth of each room and practice will fill out the rest.
---
dhcb crash is weird though because it was stable for a month and then crashed 10m+ in 1 day
---
Have you considered you might be addicted to cortisol?  Everything you write feels stressful just to read.  Like as if you're just furious and don't know how to feel differently anymore
---
This is not some 'u mad breh' insult, I'm serious.  I went to your profile to block you and the first thing I saw was a huge, FURIOUS rant.  Like this isn't healthy for you mate
---
So you're saying you personally have scoured through the source code and have evidence that shows otherwise?
---
I agree that people can't truly claim it is safe unless they look through it on their own, but to claim the opposite and also not have personally read through it is equally ignorant.
---
but it’s so sad, even with this update that i need to hop all day
---
Trust me I’d love more F2P content, but the fact we get this is good enough for me.
---
Well met my friend lol, best of luck on the zsp
---
Um, just so you're aware this was a result of the forum jagex had with the pvp all-stars streamers they invited to discuss ideas about how to make pvp more popular....so if you're gonna be mad at someone be mad at them.
---
&gt; This is definitely Viral, a competitor who was recently banned by Sythe for repeated copyright violations. He's sent us fake cease and desists and was pretty much the most shady entity in the rs community. Hes mad we are destroying his client
---
Go on....
---
Love this idea!
---
I've done it probably 25 times on rs3 lol, never on OS but that doesn't matter really. I only started playing again fairly casually after mobile released. I don't even have a PC anymore! Might just give it a bash, should in theory be quicker now too with BP.
---
d
---
Don’t give him nothing if he’s greedy enough to not want to compromise and give you d boots then fuck him.. he’s greedy.. so what do you think he’d do if the tables were turned

The entire conversation is predicated on the idea that people are being enticed there, regardless of their interest in pvp.

Just drop trade them and sell them on GE so you can fund some bonds

Gosh my hands instantly got sweaty when I saw Jad spawn. Im 0/2 at Jad right now. Need to get back and give it another shot!

Addition is hard for the RS community lmao
---
Nice improvement/progression buddy. It's always interesting looking back
---
They are aware of this and probably don't see a point in rebalancing before polling warding. Warding is meant to fix issues in the game (their words, not mine) so tying things like this to it makes it more likely to pass.
---
Thanks sir, anymore helpful hints about windows I should know? Can it also wipe my bootyhole when the taco sauce is too hot and greasy? Windows key + Delete + bootyhole?

A can of cream of mushroom soup lixed with the sauce does wonders

Let me guess, your alliance is the following:

Rev, jaja, CPK, lil cards, vr, dk. Anyone else missing? Let me know.
---
Yeah the farming guild really fucked seed prices..

That would be 1.8 turns. Which is pretty much the same direction lol

Nah, PKers wont stop until they can guarantee a kill with one spell or item.
---
Really? Telling a HCIM to go to the wild?
---
Wtf is this lol
---
Thanks.

&gt; it would create a rush for pk’rs to try an obtain said equipment

Glad you agree, this really was the motivation behind the idea, it seems to be the best way to get pkers to actually fight pkers.

Gotcha thanks man, I'll scope it out. I have no problem with that, 100+ was a little much if I didn't need to spend it.
---
Yea I agree, and never said anything otherwise. Just pointing out that “artificial limitation” is not an accurate term for f2p ironmen.
---
&gt;largely due to clans being able to grief like they do 
---
Funny you say that when there's so few clans left compared to early osrs, if there was ever a time for reddit to "rise up" and fight back against the nasty pkers, it's now.
---
I think the state pvp is in is more due to pk orientated players getting tired of being ignored and moving on from the game (with nobody to replace them because of the ironman pvmer mentality) rather than rev caves being a bad addition to the game. I fully believe if we had everything we have in the wilderness now ~1 year into osrs in addition to other much needed pvp updates that we haven't received yet there would be a far more active pk orientated player base.
---
To add to what others have said, bring some chins (I brought 100, used maybe 20) to aggro healers, and switch darts from addy to dragon either during or just before the two mage wave. They're expensive but I brought 100 and only used 17 with ava's.
---
yes, it's even slightly more dps than arclight

but arclight + dclaws combo is better overall

How do you say that in Spanish?

The only thing f2p needs to have a balanced triangle is better magic armor.

After playing quite a number of MMORPGs. All "endgame" goes this way.

That's why I prefer making dozens of accounts that flounder around mid game.
---
the detail is def better in the new one but the old one is more osrs i prefer it. cleaner is not always better
---
Thank you! I've got some cool ideas I need to get down too :)
---
Draw an obscure female character with awkward proportions and exposed feet, just like your imitator
---
Haha, much appreciated
---
is that the code for a fantastic Rim Job?
---
Thanks
---
That’s exactly why I said “cater to” may be too strong a term...
---
Also, f2p only aside, you can’t say that because someone is an ironman and therefore “choosing to restrict their account” that nothing in the game should cater to them. It’s an official game mode, *some* things absolutely should and already do cater to ironmen.

Anyone can PK but it depends on where and how,  if you get a couple of friends and go out in xerican robes and crossbows and a dds you’ll probably end up having a good laugh for a while.  You’ll need freeze (blitz at least) and tb. Are you a main or a low level?

Haha, I've got it all down. I just need to finish it all off

OSRS is literally a repost, and you enjoy it regardless

Just FYI, ape atoll would allow pures to get addy gloves and thus lock the best gloves behind 95 farming BEFORE completing monkey madness

Hes not calling people an asshat in regards to criticism, hes calling them an asshat because they are fucking retarded like you.

Any 3rd party client introduces risk to an otherwise risk-free environment. Not for my RS account. For my bank account. For my Paypal. For all other accounts I own. I don't want to take any form of risk like that for something as insignificant as an RS account. 
---
People that use 3rd party can do whatever. But I will always ask, in all "I was hacked" threads, "did you use 3rd party?"
---
Well you need the hard wilderness diaries done to get noted Zammy Wines + it's at the end of a long cave in deep wilderness so I'd be surprised if it was botted at all
---
Says the nerd with 97 agility. Rc at least gives you profit
---
NO, YOU'RE BREATHTAKING
---
I’ll probably be doing lava till 82 then maybe chill at double astrals :)
---
I get you, the proportions are better along with the stance now though
---
Yeah, hopefully I'll get better by next year
---
Just join a 50 man clan and smack around 2 year olds that'll surely be fun.
---
Hell in 70 something raids I think we've only actually made overloads twice in duos or trios.
---
When we did 4-6 man raids we ended up doing it a bit more frequently.
---
The whole point of sand crabs is to afk. Perfect time to do that is while you’re doing something irl. Most mobile users are working “on the job” while afking things. Why should he have to hop? You and your friend wasted so much time standing around bitching rather than just hopping. You’re literally the dumbass here.
---
99 range but "budget"
---
Could at least have void....its free!
---
but he said nothing was taken...?
---
I've been mobile only since it came out. I'm not a great player. I'm very casual, and play off and on. I was able to get the fire cape a few months ago after 4 attempts. Once I had it down, I realized it was so easy that I opened it as a slayer task, and haven't lost a single time since.
---
It's very doable on mobile. Just because you don't have some plugin to tell you what to pray doesn't mean you can't get it done. You'll get it, just don't give up.
---
Is this loot tab for you personally or everyone in your team?
---
thanks man i took the day off work to see my friends and they bailed on me so that was fun lol.
---
Damn, a Dad Bod!
---
Once again, you're completely missing the entire objective of jagex's updates. Looks like you're not interested in participating in this conversation, but instead just here to be insulting.
---
A reddit post is how you get Jagexs attention lmao. And you admitted you are trying to get a c&amp;d. That post is literally what youre doing right now lol
---
only for jad
---
The agenda to keep people safe from being hacked?
---
The RS community is notorious for doxing, harassing, threats, etc. especially if this is a lucrative RWT scheme he’s interrupting.
---
Gotcha my mistake then, although I find it strange they do interface changes in runescript. Guess they thought it would be a common enough thing to include it.
---
How many hours pking did you spend on this tab in total? How much profit per hour would that make rev caves pking to be?
---
"Runelite PLUS" is different than "Runelite."
---
just noticed the clock tower kind of looks like a pipe wrench
---
Triggered chud
---
When you can put hundreds of hours into a game some people start to feel like it's their life
---
Oh god our backpack is an even worse pokeball
---
I go in windy once in awhile.  Gotta get those cheaper runes Haha.  Just bring full inventory of food and try to do it during slow hours of the day.  
---
Granted I only chose hc because why not.  I'll still be a btw if I die.  Just have been lucky enough not to yet Haha.

Runelite or runelite+? Cause there’s a difference.
---
When people ask me how many attempts I tell them 0 pink clay teamviwered it lmaooooo, there reactions are priceless, to be fair if there wasn’t video evidence of me getting it myself I probably wouldn’t in case of a false ban
---
Ridiculous lmao
---
i use rl+
---
rl+
---
That isn’t what he’s saying mate. Serene was a user who used to post retarded shit all the time. Serene happened to be Swedish and have conservative political opinions. Now this new account, which was made 7 days after Serene stopped posting, shares those similar qualities.
---
Yea most front-end things will be in a game's choice of scripting language to let designers and content developers work with it.
---
Posting
---
Okay...
---
Wait, so these prayer trainers in high risk worlds have pking clans as bodyguards?
---
maybe he can buy a hair transplant with the money
---
or help his sister out so she doesnt have to strip for cash l000000000l
---
Been using RL+ for a while. I really love the plugins.. I have never had an issue with login problems/items gone or gold missing.   
---
This post is like when RuneLite just got popular, people got hacked/phished, people blamed RuneLite for it.   
---
I'm not the best programmer out there but, I've checked the source. So far no malicious entries found. If you really had some evidence, it would be atleast a screenshot of said malicious code and also the link to it. Which in this case, is not here.  
---
Thanks for the warning though. I'll keep that in mind.   
---
Mind you negative attention, is still giving attention, and thus making this client more visible to players. It might draw more people towards the client, if they also don't see anything bad in the source.  
---
Also, throwaway account on reddit? Luckily Redditors are so gullible!
---
If the book gives a max hit use the book if not use unholy always b ring over treasonous that’s what I do on mine
---
Thank you great sir. I'm going to read up on that right now
---
This is actually an amazing idea.
---
It's like a smaller person within a bigger person.
---
Seeing u sent one of our devs a fake C&amp;D you cant do shit LMAO, ash even said its up to the higher ups so keep trying. Plus we are not a LLC so they have nothing to C&amp;D.  And you think we would even accept a  C&amp;D from gagex. If our github ever went down we would just host it with gitlab. Gagex would have to get rid of runelite to get rid of us. Go watch
---
"Jagex Reply to 3th party clients"
---
It’s a beginner, what did you expect?
---
Congrats bro
---
You get more kills/hr with DHCB so the cost of bolts ends up being made up for by the extra drops and they end up similar gp/hr
---
I did a bit since I was a kid but it's only really been this last year that I've been trying to improve a bit
---
RSN - borteatass
---
That makes more sense then. It sounded like you had the nests before the update.
---
Yeah, the older one is very stiff
---
That would have been silly
---
Done use leaf blAded spear you’ll get def xp
---
Fuckin hell yer lucky bastard
---
I made an Old School clan before clan chat existed. Initially it was so I could not die in the wilderness and stage tactical battles.  
---
I used to keep handwritten notes of all the members we had and manually add and message each one of them when we had a meeting, which usually took an hour. Everyone would hang out in my PoH, typically.  
---
We had a donation system initially, where donated goods like lobsters, mithril bars etc, went into production for universal gear for everyone.  
---
Clan chat came out, made things easier, although we had a website for most management at that point - but it helped keep track of the ten-rank system we already had, which had since evolved into a points system - gain points for going to events, recruiting etc, lose points for inactivity, points = rank levels, high ranks had other ways to gain points from activities.  
---
Easily the best part of Runescape clans was the individuality we were afforded by the shape of the game's community and content which I desperately struggle to find in any other game - typically you want a clan now, you have to run a server, recruit from other servers, have to deal with all the people that normally get banned from a game - that's all pre-packaged, in essence.  
---
Ran the clan for five years, but stepped down long before citadels came out, which started as a good idea but there was just so many problems with it. People don't join clans because of community, they joined for the free xp boost. All the "clan" items are premade nonsense with frankly very little difference in design, even with the optional colours. Clans went from being something you worked on yourself, to being a very railroaded part of the game with far too narrow parameters.  
---
Every clan I've been in post-citadel has even at best, had a short boost of interest, followed by a complete desperate silence and disinterest.  
---
My best hope is that if they did do a clan citadel again (although no shirt off my back if they don't) that they make it some kind of joint construction building, and not just a weird cookie-cutter dimension with valueless resources in it - at the same time I don't want it to be a must-have for game progression.
---
It's value MUST be in facilitating the organisation of group activities, because that's how I personally feel clans flow best in runescape. We took people to just about every minigame, trained people in dungeons and skills, at our largest wilderness event had about 130 people on the register for our side of the war we fought.  
---
You don't get that when you close the parameters like citadels did.
---
great response been telling people this same thing for 2 days now.
---
Man of reason, finally
---
Leaf blades sword bro
---
practice makes uhhhhhhh perfect son?
---
Go and check the source code if you want. There is nothing malicious in the code. This is just like when RuneLite got popular, and Osbuddy players got jealous or something I guess.
---
I could easily draw something way better than this tbh. This guy sucks ass
---
Except then another client would pop up that has those features that “play the game for you”. Personally I see them more as handicaps.
---
Void has less accuracy
---
True. I just find it weird I guess
---
but lewd
---
Just put them in your bank and continue on.
---
better than lance?
---
i used the second option. only because i didn’t feel like leveling up slayer
---
Nah smoke devils are the best easily
---
Sour eh?
---
B ring is always better
---
I dont think he is a farmer, I think people do this stuff at the GE for shits and giggles.
---
Farmer accounts dont want to risk being banned and usually have minimum required stats for said farm.
---
I would say just do what you feel like. Personally I really liked slayer and trained that until I got a clue and then did the clue. Each time I hit a elite or master clue and hit a sherlock step I trained the skill that was needed for that step. 
---
Other goals you could aim for:
---
83 construction 
---
Dragon Slayer II
---
That's a lot of miles for 20yo
---
Post number 29471647 of a standard beginner clue. Will it ever end?
---
Make it crappier Strawberries, boom problem solved
---
Do you mean strength bonus is more important than attack style bonus?
---
Wow what that’s crazy literally tens of thousands of players use this...
---
Yeah somebody probably already had same idea for a meme as I did
---
This but unironically
---
I just don't understand why people keep trusting this obvious rat.
---
&gt;The pure meta has always been like this: put in a disproportionate amount of work for extremely marginal rewards.
---
That's just your interpretation of "the pure meta". 
---
The only absolutes when it comes to pures is having low defence and a low combat level with high offensive stats. There are plenty of rich pures who can afford the extra stuff, and plenty of poor pures who get on just fine with the existing quest routines and unlockables. 
---
There are also "extreme" achievements for pures with the time and resources, like the infernal cape.
---
However, your suggestion of locking down a non-cosmetic pure item behind 95 levels in a *non-combat* skill is not only going to be unpopular, but it's also not in line with the spirit of the game, and is entirely unnecessary. 
---
The highest skill requirement for any quest in this game is in the low 70s. There's not a single quest that requires level 80, let alone 95. That's achievement diary territory, and you'll notice that achievement diaries practically never reward BiS gear (with the possible exception of elite void, which has fairly low stat requirements in the 70s). 
---
Ultimately, this suggestion serves no purpose other than to create an arbitrarily difficult hurdle in achieving BiS pure gloves. Most people absolutely will not want to have to grind 95 farming on each pure account they make if they want to achieve the BiS gloves, regardless of whether or not they would do it if this suggestion came to pass (it won't).
---
I’m nearing your current status as a new player that started when mobile game out and I’m curious.. what made you take a break around this time? 
---
I can feel myself slowly start to burn out and play less and less and I’m hoping to get the joy back. I’d rather not quit for several months.
---
Thats why Skyrim is still the best game ever and so will skyrim 2.
---
Runecrafting****
---
But you downloaded a zulrah plugin? Where was that downloaded from?
---
Well that password was changed a little bit ago just in case, but that literally had no effect. It's not like you need an email to disable the authenticator.  If they had my email they most likely would of reset the account password. I don't use the same passwords for anything.
---
I don't have the funds for 83 construction :(
---
But Dragon Slayer II I think I just need to complete three more quests. So that's an idea!
---
My mom does
---
Ok, now THIS is based
---
Maybe mark it as spoiler, A lot of people like to be surprised during his videos's by his impressive gains.
---
Yes, they should stop all content and focus on people making a meme limited to one server and to a small period of time.
---
Because the make everything faster for no reason. Banking is fast enough as is
---
[ok](https://preview.redd.it/u7pgue8fx8521.gif?width=640&amp;format=mp4&amp;s=7e52975bf8681afc9fb6cd33c5cbe1fc9bc16869)
---
??? It was already on the client it comes with it no need to download from an other site. All was from their discord/website.
---
Probably because of the free month with twitch prime, a LOT more bots at the moment.
---
But there is no official zulrah plugin for runelite so...
---
yeah maybe it's a gearing issue, i don't have much prayer boosting gear other than a blessing and a god cloak.  My best gear is dbootd/dskirt basically, don't have any nice chest piece yet, and haven't unlocked netizont.  Guess i still have some work to do lol.  My account has trouble with dharok, ahrim, and kharyll still.  Dharok especially drains my prayer cause he hits super hard once you start getting him low, and even though i have 75 mage i still splash a lot on them.  Oh well, like i said, i know i don't have the most efficient or profitable runs but it's still fun.  I'll get there eventually.
---
You are standards
---
Not talkimg about normal runelite
---
This is runelite+ some unwanted plugins are on it like the zulrah plugin DONT DOWNLOAD IT
---
For someone that avoids that part of the game entirely, can you explain like I’m five?

You forgot about the legend....he strikes with the quickness. Wow. #free25buttholes

Also mintmadcow and Sparc Mac if you want random stuff
---
A brand new f2p one? It’s faster money than anything else he can do and it doesn’t matter if he dies since there’s no time invested yet
---
It was for something called runelite plus  it has unwanted plugins that were deleted JUST DONT DOWNLOAD if you hear about it.
---
yup and if you get lucky and the clan ignores you on one of their sweeps, you can get some decent loot.  Doesn't happen often though, they like to do scorched earth more or less, but i've scored a few good flips that way.
---
?????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Not gonna say I have a lot of faith here, but hey I’ll upvote it.
---
Super combats kinda straddle the line sometimes but I’m pretty sure that’s it
---
Ive been playing for 13 years its always been the norm to treat lower levels like trash
---

---
Draw him with nuthin but his snelm
---
Think of picking herbs as having lives. You have 5 lives with super and 6 with ultra. Higher farming increases your chances of not depleting a life. So, you’re guaranteed at least one extra with ultra, sometimes more because you have more chances to not deplete a life.
---
so?
---
People have had stats reset for a bug, but this isn’t a bug. You just voluntarily specced on a setting that gives xp you didn’t want. Nobody’s fault but your own
---
Ice cold

I'm over 85cmb but still doing konar because she gives more points per task, should I be going to nieve/steve instead?

Nah too many entities on screen a few non bots disappear too.

I went from using DHCB which got me 4 kills per trip to Lance which gets me 6-8 kills per trip consistently. I used elite void/max set up with dhcb with woox walking and all that but when I use max str with lance I take so much less dmg and get kills quicker.
---
And you're that guy that is somehow bothered by another man's taste in music and humor. Who is the real pathetic one here? Me probably....

Holy crap, rng can be a cruel bitch sometimes. Congrats, how long do you think it took hours wise?

Bruh jad is just Simon says.
---
Yea but vork is:
---
-more difficult 
---
-designed to be a short fight and done repeatedly 
---
The fight caves is only supposed to be done once in most people's cases. So even if you have as hard of a time killing jad as you do killing vorkath for some reason, 6 hours really isn't that bad for a permanent upgrade in RuneScape.
