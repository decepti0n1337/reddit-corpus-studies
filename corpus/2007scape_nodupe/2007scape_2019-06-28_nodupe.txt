I think 2-3 days is an underestimation if you consider the chances of the whip drop. He‚Äôd have to build up and get at least an Ivandis Flail again (spend more time if he wants his rune scim back), and there‚Äôs almost no way he gets his whip on 45kc again. I think a full rebuild would take a week or so of grinding

So what you‚Äôre saying is that nothing else deserves to have its ‚Äúprestige‚Äù protected, just inferno? There‚Äôs no other content in the normal game people should have to do for themselves?
---
whats wrong with the atmosphere?  it's not luna moon dumb idiot
---
You have to alch the box they're in so the individual pieces come loose. Thst way you can equip one at a time
---
It's the time you bought it, there's a way of checking exactly how many days hours and minutes you have, not sure how though, I presume on the website somewhere
---
They're only just now getting rid of the ridiculous CW comp requirement.
---
I see a problem, you play on mobile.
---
He did die in templetrek... go back 2 episodes lol.
---
Lol yeah dog this is complete fabrication
---
[removed]
---
My idea is that his videos are about a month behind his progress, he added a clip where someone said it looks like he lives here and I saw that here on reddit.
---
LOL.
---
and the whip is most value item so wouldn't drop on death.
---
My bank went up 80m today. I'm happy
---
mate hes a sad angry little man no point even trying. Every comment on his reply his him with some snarky or insulting reply to comments don't know how people like that function in the real world 0 social skills

Yeah, the birds attacking you doesn't affect your cutting speed at all if you don't cancel the animation

Oh when did that change?

Sorry I was thinking purely of skill requirements. That's a good point though. I think that's the only circumstance if I'm not mistaken though?
---
Dumb idiot..? Alright then. 
---
Excuse the fuck out of me for having a laugh.
---
Having done the 69 Slayer grind I really wouldn't recommend it unless it's currently a fresh account because doing MM2 **after** finishing most of the DS2 quests fucks up your task list
---

---
So unless you're happy with having to do 100 shit-xp blue dragons for the eighth time, fuck it
---
I know
---
Never have issues with the servers anymore
---
I got my first whip at 3k kc on my iron
---
Gosh I remember starting out way back in the day. My friend and I thought we made it rich cause we found 1 law rune, back when they were 1k each. Simpler times. Felt good making money back then.
---
Hah I did over 500 pies and I didn't get my whip till I gave up at 2k kc, then grinded out 85 and got 3.2k kc total.
---
there's other skills to do besides Runecrafting
---
May I ask how the fuck you have 750 items in your bank? I don't think I've ever passed 700 except when I huge slayer/clue tabs
---
does he also do armor trims? my full rune could use a guthix trim
---
at one stage i had 20 something cats, swapped them all for death runes, in 2006 it was  good money! ;-)

Amazing, i want 1

Def isn't underrated, both weapons work well and you're using a fairly common cheap zerker build.
---
So a well thought out idea that would be an amazing addition to the game should not come in. Because you just want your cape
---
No it counts as someone making a joke
---
Maybe he just skimmed the video.

It‚Äôs because everyone hates change. At least big change.

 I'm really sick of the dragon scimitar meta up until 70 attack and really think it should be a matter of preference. Sure some people argue it would ruin the game integrity and the nostalgia yet i argue the opposite; what weapon did you use in 2007? Sure you may have used the scimitar because you knew it was best by the time you got to rune equipment but early in the game i know every one of you rocked that mithril 2h or that adamant warhammer. Let us use our favorite weapons filled with nostalgia from the old days without feeling like we are playing the game wrong. I made a possible rework to the stats of all basic metal weapons and would like to know what you guys think/what could be improved/if i made something extremely op on accident.

&gt;!If he can get his hands on a dragonstone from implings then he may be working up towards being able to craft a combat bracelet? Would need level 74 Crafting.!&lt;

Jagex would lose hundreds of thousands, if not million of dollars if they did this.

They took the aggressive randoms away because bots weren't dying to them, real players were. Bots can easily detect and handle any random event, in fact every client that isn't shit has a built in auto handler for random events, people don't even have to code to handle randoms anymore.
---
Yea doubt it probably closer to 3x that
---
*too
---
Are you going to provide counter-evidence to go with your dismissal of mine? If mine's not good enough, at least have the courtesy to provide your own.
---
Until shown otherwise, my evidence holds more weight, because at least I *have* evidence.

Raids aren't a big change? Zeah wasn't a big change? Wilderness slayer, Zulrah, inferno i can keep going with changes here

70k xp and hour. 10 hours a day means 700k xp a day.
---
It was voted this way because randoms were basically the annoying fly that keeps flying around your head, you don't care to deal with it, but it doesn't stop it from being annoying.
---
I work in real estate, trust me I know the difference between poor and lazy.

Hi

50/50

I mean if you whine its not old school and abuse zulrah raids and vorkath its really not a good answer
---
Then you clearly care about being crashed...

kill the respiratory systems then tele out. the whole point in basing like that is you "skip" the null time resulting from him slowly getting his ass off the throne.

you are slow or you are using one of the far rooms. use the most east/west ones

??? People used bis gear everywhere they use bis gear now back in the day.
---
What a pointless thing to do. If I wanted to read the boring non uwu post I'd just pull this dick out of my ass and scroll back up. Have I mentioned I have a chronic condition where if I want to read an uwu post I have to insert a dick into my ass? Pretty inconvenient smhüò§üò§üò§

What is the armor
---
I dont know who that is, but it aint me
---
&gt; and there‚Äôs almost no way he gets his whip on 45kc again.
---
Knowing this series he'd get to about 100KC and then get an Abyssal Dagger drop
---
lance and it isn't even remotely close.
---
drakes are way to easy to farm, and master wand is way to cheap.  i could see kodai with something else, also 50% is way to high, 20% max.
---
That's pretty neat :o
---
Congrats bro

Hornwood Helm, Graahk top and legs, prospector boots

Sounds to me like you're not happy with the direction you're going. Maybe school (unsure if you mean high school level or college level) isn't for you... But in that case you need to think of something else.
---
I did well in school when I was a teenager but once I left and had to move on to A-levels I just wasn't interested in the subjects enough to spend the time to get good grades. I soon realised that I was doing what my parents wanted me to do, not what I wanted to do.
---
So after wasting a lot of time I started doing music, and I have been so, so much happier since starting it. Currently working on my mastering skills and my own productions, and looking for some studio work. I'm nowhere near at the perfect point, but it feels amazing knowing I'm on the right path.
---
So make sure you're doing what you want to do!
---
&gt;MMORPGrs have a clan of 20+ people constantly protect him 24/7 at revs.
---
revs is team content, it's not any different than doing cox or tob on an ironman, it's really not a fair comparison.
---
Man this could honestly be like a year from now
---
/r/NFL is here
---
Go to 302 clan wars and get someone in the portal to kill you, it will reset your skull. Or nmz using mini game tele.
---
Confession, my bot does most of the heavy lifting nowadays. I work too much, and this uwu thing has gotten too popular to keep up with. Sorry boo &lt;3
---
everyone doesn't hate warding. this sub (and the game) is made of many people with many opinions. reddit really really really systematically incentivizes outrage so generally negative criticism will make its way to the top much more reliably than positive opinions. 
---
reddit upvotes are *absolutely not* a reliable predictor for poll results. "delete haitius cosaintus" posts got thousands of upvotes and reached front page dozens of times, they poll removing him, it fails. do not concern yourself with highly upvoted posts in opposition to stuff on reddit. they don't actually reflect the voting populace very well.
---
I don't know. Rendi would be a pretty good contender for his 18cb fire Cape.
---
Sometimes.
---
its from the wiki lol
---
Now youre being ridiculous
---
I literally put the analogy in parenthesis every step of the way
---
Maybe because bis back then was super easy to obtain. Full arma is over 70m for a minor dps increase.
---
its from the wiki
---
/u/SettledRS 
---
I'd love to see you at least try lol :P have you commented on this yet? I know it gets suggested like every video.
---
I remember I had a similar idea when I played RS3. Except it would've been an FC for people who are AFK training and leaving loot on the floor to tell lower levels they could come get it all. Neat to see this kinda concept take off!
---
I‚Äôve killing green drags by lava maze. Come buy my loot please. Bring like 60m
---
If they are your target.
---
r/unexpectedouija
---
Dont do that
---
Ok awesome, wasn't sure if there was a combat restriction like to receive emblems
---
I know where this is
---
probably in the ballpark of like 200-300 hours.
---
Damn I‚Äôm already 2500kc on shamans no dwh :(
---
Because they don't want another skill in the way of max :\^)
---
In a serious note, personally, I'd rather see the elements of warding put into RC, similar to how RS3 had ports mage armour craftable with Runecrafting. It would give some much needed TLC to a currently horrid and boring skill. That's my reasoning for not wanting it.
---
yes.
---
Right on!
---
ehy guys noob question here: can members enter in a f2p world and go into the wilderness to kill non members?
---
You can barehand catch d imps at 93. D imps can give dstones, which he'll need for RoW &amp; cb brace. 
---
My only guess anyway
---
same
---
From what I understand, it was removed so players couldn't  abuse the duel mechanic to get a free teleport back to lumbridge.
---
This was many years before the home tele came out.
---
you got this broski
---
Literally just took everything from fortnite. Terrible idea
---
Inconvenient as they were, I love and miss them. Much like that one "friend" from college whose name I never learned, but sometimes I woke up and he was on our couch, and he always had a story to tell that involved someone's asshole and an anime from my childhood.
---
Used to be a glitch you could do to get 2 herb when botanical pies were first released
---
slayers fun, recommend bursting some tasks (anything u fight in zeah catacombs) after u do desert treasure.  
---
barbarian fishing is like 36k xp an hour, still pretty slow, but thats fishing. huntings real profitable at red chins
---
Warding bad
---
making an alt and using it as a BoB is easier and apparently cheaper.  good plan for those lazy to make one i guess.
---
Battle Pass, aka Micro-Transaction. HARD PASS.
---
He didn't even specify what he is talking about. Can you chill the fuck out?
---
This is literally osrs wedding
---
I did 71-99 agility straight. It was not fun, but at least somewhat afk. Now i'm trying to burst lavas to 77 runecrafting and I just can't do it. I thought the worst was over. I could never have been so wrong...
---
but where is the b2b?
---
30h-90hs to max and outside of maxing again the skill has no use for me since the best robes you can make is only +5 more magic attack then ahrims... which means since i have ancestrial it is completely dead content for myself and just a waste of my time to train since its dead on release.
---
So come up with some ideas then!
---
25!!!! Get them randoms booty's to pop baby!?!
---
I thought we were just talking IF you could write a bot that genuinely unuwus it. I can almost guarantee it just goes to the parent comment, why would it go through all that effort when the original has to be there?
---
If you haven‚Äôt already, go watch solomission‚Äôs DMM content, it‚Äôs probably my favourite of all the content creators so far
---
Oh I thought we were talking about whether uwu translator was a bot or not lol
---
Aaaaand this acc isn‚Äôt banned.....
---
That last sentence fucks me up every time, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs from the thread where a player (name escapes me) shit himself.
---
Gonna be honest here. The ads are fucking arrogant. Feels like EA pushing shit on me
---
PKers don't need more help.  What they need is more good reasons for normal players to go into the wilderness- the stronger PKers get, the less rewarding it is for normal players to go into the wildy.  
---
The chests give those players just that- although the drops are boring.  They could put other items of same value (IE instead of X magic logs put Y black chins)- make it special without making it *special.*  You could start getting into gp:EXP of the items and it may be less rewarding for ironman but hey, there's already Konar anyways.
---
Yet, fortnite as a business reaches the billion mark in a year?   
---
Must be so bad to follow examples of successful companies!  
---
These are **basics** of modern digital marketing.  
---
You think the Nikes that Lebron James and Cristiano Ronaldo wear are just because Nike just decided to throw money on athletes?
---

---
Please reply with something constructive, thank you!
---
They're buyable
---
Did nobody watch the video? It is a fire cape not the inferno
---
That is true. It sucks that people suck.
---
Unless we make the normal weapon give a +15% damage bonus + another 20% vs dragons.
---
Fight caves not inferno
---
Without leveling your alt? Not really. There are other things you \*can\* do but it's barely more profit than cannonballs and much more attention required. I'd highly recommend leveling your alt, just do herb + birdhouse runs on it while you level it so it pays for its own bond. You'll want the hunter + farming levels later too, farming levels are great for when you do CoX (you could alt the raid, or even just raid on your alt if you train it enough) and the hunter levels are practically a must have for ToB when you get to that point (Need hunter for elite void)
---
There are non-combat alternatives too (Fishing isn't too bad, I think there are a few \~400k/h methods at higher levels) but honestly I'd recommend going for the combat ones. You just can't beat ToBing on an alt while you level your main, hell I did that for 3 skills (runecrafting, fishing, smithing) and made \~ 9b.
---
Thanks :) It's my first skill pet ever.

How about this: Different market means different things work and different things fail. I'ma take a wild guess and say that you're self-employed. What your post proposes would kill this game. If you don't understand why, you've not done even the slightest research.

Wait wtf. I reread the comment chain idk how you thought that. Uwu translater 100% is not a bot. Unuwu is. Unuwu almost def just copy pastes the parent it doesn't genuinely un uwu it

Well i guess i'm farming  **Grotesque Guardians** this weekend

Personally, I think they suck for money. It's a lot of effort for a boss when I can do vorkath or hydra for twice as much gp/hr.  I only do them for the dust and pet. After I get pet Ill probably stop

Will actually riot at Falador if he doesn't

There's 50/50 chance it isn't 50/50
---
No not really, gp and xp is about the same (I think xp is worse) all while being pretty aids to kill. Only do them for the pet.
---
So just cause its not good for a maxed main its bad hmm....? no point for anyone else in the game or if u start an ironman?
---
I‚Äôm a chemistry major and I am absolutely confused with what you‚Äôre trying to convey
---
We wear their skin to protect us from magic, it just doesn't make sense. Since metal dragons already are weak to magic, maybe a magic weapon particularly effective against them that runs off of crushed dragon bones?
---
That's kind of my understanding of UIM gameplay in general. Your achievements are more based on skills to obtain items rather than whatever you're holding onto at the moment
---
There are clans that are around you can join. Some content creators have chill CCs like J1mmy and Tanzoo. Only disc that i know that is normally open would be wedoraids

why would pures even be doing pest control. only reason i can think of is no hp strength levels but seeing as how its so much easier to do that with range/mage and you need atleast some hp levels it cant be a huge sample size

Only if the price has been raised in that time.

To be honest, I might be thinking of an old policy - membership was once $5 a month(no idea of the ¬£ price) and if you had never lapsed in membership, that rate was maintained when prices were hiked. It was never really a discount but more an incentive to continue paying membership.

I love the serious and hope it continues to get love. I‚Äôm excited for the higher tiers mate, keep up the good work.

The whole reason he's training hunter is to get a rune crossbow. He has to obtain it from a lucky impling because he cannot make a crossbow string since there is no spinning wheel in his restricted area.

I don't understand why these still get upvotes. I don't understand why people still think this is funny in 2019. Furthermore, this name isn't even good, notice how the "Trade" and "Look Up" don't even line up, I've seen far better. This is simply lazy karma. I'll take my downvotes now.

Fuck everyone saying they can't answer for you. FUCK YES! It's worth getting back into! Now with mobile I've neglected my family and responsibilities so much my wife is leaving me. Which is great xp wise but now I'll have to make an alt or two to pay for child support. No biggie though I hear our world is ending. Just hope I can max before then! Otherwise what was the point, ya know?

IRA member in West Belfast 1970 or so. Irish Republican communities didn't trust anyone who wore the crown so many of them took to policing themselves.

It's a rather iconic photo from The Troubles so someone else can probably give more exact details.

To add a bit of expansion, that was when they started stringing together plot threads and existing content. When Ritual of the Mahjarrat first came out Paul Gower talked about the [backgroudn and design of the mahjarrat and RS quests](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Update:Blog_-_Developer_Blogs:_Development_of_the_Mahjarrat). At first they didn't really make storylines but just made individual quests that were one off, with antagonists like Lucien and Khazard and Hazeel. Later around 2004, they were tasked with tidying up the lore which hadn't actually been outlined by that point, and came up with the race of the Mahjarrat, which could shapeshift(explaining their vastly different appearances, like Azzanadra looking like Anubis and Khazard being a skeleton), codified they were heading to the North for a ritual that was coming up(previously just a throwaway line by Lucien about retreating up north, that other devs misinterpretted as meaningful and made other chars like Akthanakos and Enakhra say too), and that the Stone of Jas existed. There are also other development tales that have been pieced together as legitimate like Desert Treasure, Monkey Madness, and Throne of Miscellania being the work of interns working at the time and the lore for Zaros being woven together through various loose ends and eventually codified with the release of the Ancient Spellbook.

A bit of a tangent, but it was around 2006 that they started planning for WGS, with Melzar the Mad getting new dialogue about the Cabbage of Jas, Lunar Diplomacy having lore about V----- and the Stone of Jas, and Movario searching in the Lumbridge Swamp Caves for a magical artifact(and having a Lucien pendant if you pickpocket him), all still present in OSRS

That's the karambwanji fishing spot in karamja. It's that 25k stack of fish he's got. They stack because they are used as bait for karambwan.

Those ehp nerds would throw a hissy fit if a random made them lose XP/h.

Even just adding back camera movement would not go over well with the current player base
---
I'm with you on this boat. This seems really impractical.
---
Loot that is already ignored is ignored for a reason. It's so common and inexpensive that it is just not worth making the trip for. You'd be constantly coming and going for some dudes 2 addy kites.
---
Either OP won't bother to constantly make that trip over and over for common drops or people won't bother telling op about them every 5 minutes for a new load.

who are those non settled people?

Search for deleted emails in you bin box.

It won‚Äôt remain as rare if you give it any type of benefit. Right now it is only cosmetic, so I haven‚Äôt even given a thought about going for it. But if it had a worthwhile benefit, or even a really nice emote..,I‚Äôd likely put some time into.
---
But if you don‚Äôt care whether the cape is rare or not, then my opinion is irrelevant lol
---
not necessarily a fan of how niche they were in v2, we shouldn't have to change gear like that dependent on what we are killing.  Either way the v2 armor still came out as being worst then ancestrial, which is still the problem.  how do you make a skill with armor in 2019 while not killing existing content?  You really cant.

Thx for not censoring killcount... Might as well have just handed me your ssn, ty for the ely
---
KempQ also said it was weird, obsessive, and distasteful. Just didnt let it get to him because he didn‚Äôt care as much as rendi thought
---
But the higher priced items are mostly that expensive for Them being good, so if you keep the most expensive items you mostly keep the best ones.
---
3/10
---
3 points for staff, tome and cape.
---
Switch out mystics for melee tank boots and legs and then d‚Äôhide body if you are ranging... but looking at your bow (looks like yew longbow) maybe you should just skip ahrim and use melee wep on barrows mobs. Because barrows bros have negative mage defense you don‚Äôt need magic attack bonus yourself for accuracy or dmg... its just a mechanic.
---
Hopes this helps you get that sweet epic gamer loot.
---
Dog what if the emote for the champion cape was to turn into the guy on the RuneScape handbook? Maybe alternating between him and the skeleton? The true OG champions of RuneScape are definitely them.
---
Oh. Oh, that's just cruel.
---
You understood what his comment was and you're just being pedantic. Grow up.
---
I remember being in 7th grade drawing all the barrow brothers and their weapons on my note book. I was too noobie to ever get them back then so when I got my veracs flail for 300k I was insanely proud.
---
Also its the start of a skill. Do you want us to have it be like smithing and have lvl 99 make bis gear on release that will be outclassed and become irrelevant when we get the next big content dump? If you want a full 1-99 skill planned out now you're insane. Have to give it room to grow. And sure you since the skill is scaled xp wise like fletching and crafting 30-80 hours to make t60 armor isn't true. And sure you can get lvl 60 mage in a day. Most people probably won't start and bang out 60 magic in a day unless its for a specialty build. part of the skill is proposed to be f2p like crafting has f2p applications. Also basically you're saying the game is meant to be played efficiently. Its a game have fun with it. If you want a skill built strictly for efficiency lets remove 90% of the construction skill better yet lets remove the bulk of slayer monsters. As the bulk of it is dead content. It makes no sense to build a skill that is only designed for endgame players. And its not everyone else problem that you decide play in the most efficient manner.

I‚Äôm not a pker but that‚Äôs kinda partly what wildy is about... if you don‚Äôt want players to attack you don‚Äôt go to pvp places, you gotta read a warning when you jump over the ditch anyway
---
A real player isn't something that you're going to be able to define by being a snooty nitpicking ass. 
---
Point is, player retention early on is cut hard by being forced into a random event, and even more so from dying to one and losing your gear as a new player. 
---
For an older more experienced player, they'll range from mildly annoying to extremely irritating. For the lucky few, nostalgic and fun, but the majority of people won't want them to happen at the time they do. 
---
And that's not even to mention that the intent is against bots, which aren't even really bothered by them as he said above, bots have detection and solution to all of em.
---
no its just a 1 tick action so you're basically treating it like tick manipulating fishing or hunter.
---
It costs him 20k to get his flail back this mf could kick skeletons and have it back in no time, wouldn‚Äôt take more than 10 hours of game time. For salve and strength ammy. Change my mind

The red from the cape/blue from the cane throw it off
---
DON'T PAY, AM GAY
---
Hmm. Maybe y'all are on to something.
---
Fairytale 2 and tree gnome village are some pretty useful ones for transportation during other quests
---
this but jagex needs to stop "rejuvenating" the wildy by only ever bringing pvmers into the wildy instead of doing anything else to help pvp like actually fix/rework bounty hunter
---
Void does work. Armadyl has better range attack bonuses so go with that if you can afford it.
---
its an RPG just have fun with it

I hope I get to smack you up.  Can‚Äôt wait for the salty last sentence as you fall.

Odium ward with ornament kit from bounty hunter store.
---
You're not going to be able to take advantage of a longbow's extended range, so you're just losing a lot of damage. Get a shortbow instead of a longbow. If you're not using rune arrows, a rune crossbow with broad bolts or a Dorgeshuun crossbow would probably be significantly better.
---
You don't need that much mage offense bonus. If your magic is very low, keep the mystic top and bottom for Karil, but bring a Proselyte or Rune switch for casting magic on the melee brothers.
---
Any tier of dragonhide body switch would offer more accuracy than a Fremennik helm switch. Bring both mystics top/bottom and dragonhide body/legs if you need the accuracy, or otherwise just bring Proselyte and dragonhide.
---
Definitely get a glove upgrade. I can't tell what those gloves are for certain, but they don't look to be any of the Cullinomancer's chest gloves. A combat bracelet would be the easiest upgrade.
---
In terms of inventory, you probably could use less prayer potions and more food, as using that many prayer potions will cost a lot in the long run. A range potion and staminas would probably help for more chests per hour, and you could probably use house tablets on the house party world to full heal/pray while banking.
---
I agree but only because im going to get away so its xp,gp,and fun loss on your time.

False.

Cute ad

This is true! Gonna see how the first few days go, there will be some guidelines set in the very near future, thanks
---
Would support if they do that for all accounts. Endless catering to ironmemes devalues the efforts of higher level ironmemes.
---
"meta" "disadvantage" "wouldn't get accepted". I don't think these words can come from someone who enjoys a game.

I'll probably use this when I'm bursting dust devils since the bank was freaking moved further away. Ffs

Lol that chick wearing pink slippers legendary
---
Just a general NMZ question again.
---
I'm currently 65 ranged and want to train it while I'm studying. I think NMZ is the better choice over sand crabs because it's more afk I believe? Plus it's instanced so I don't have to worry about someone crashing me.
---
But, I'm an absolute noob when it comes to ranged. There are so many kind of gears I most likely don't know about, so I wanted to ask here first which gear I should use for maximum xp rates. I've got a couple mil to spend.
---
My goal is maximum afk. However I've seen posts that claim nmz is "afk" but you have to flick your prayer every minute. Is that avoidable? Is there a way to get a true 20 minutes of afk? 
---
I know these questions get asked a lot but I found it surprisingly difficult to find good information about online. Thanks a lot!
---
Thank you for this!
---
It's like the wyvern cc but for all of runescape 
---
I definitely like this idea. Is there a lower limit to what you'll take? I get a load of addy axes from dust devil tasks I usually alch in bulk, but if I can get rid of them early I'd be down
---
Really?
---
This is great actually. I'll consider not skipping a blue dragon task next time I get one :p
---
Obliterate yourself from existence.
---
That ain‚Äôt Phreak
---
Isnt this their current goal? BH reworks and PvP QoL changes like the last 3 updates?
---
he put spoiler tag
---
This is like Uber eats but for loot
---
don't have to flick your prayer. 
---
Full void (elite if you can get it), best range gear in all other slots.
---
For weapon, either imbued msb with amethyst arrows, or mithril darts. 
---
Custom normal rumble, choose the normal bosses. Absorb (and rock cake if you can be bothered). Should be able to afk for 20 mins, maybe less depending on your def lvl.
---
It means having an alt account on the enemy team, going to an empty world and then just letting you main win.
---
It's only 7.2 tickets/hr unless you get a third account involved which speeds it up a bit
---
I want to start selling 3d prints of runescape items, is there any copyright issues with this kind of thing
---
Implement updates Jagex doesn't like.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Sadly I don't have void (yet) and I don't really have the time to get it now. I've started looking for other gear and I found [this](https://imgur.com/H1dbAlS.png) to be the best I could afford. Hopefully that's okay?
---
Also, what do you mean with "normal bosses"? Simply all bosses which do not freeze you or knock you back, etc? Is there a list of these somewhere? And alright, i'll do absorb+rock cake. I assume instead of keeping your hp at 1 you simply let it go up for 20 minutes and then reset it to 1? My def is currently 72.
---
Thanks again!
---
yahoooooooo
---
Drop by the deliveritems discord maybe they can send people your way (they don't buy loot)
---
I like the idea but with graceful and stamina pots i barely if ever run out of energy anyway.
---
I was thinking even 30% is fair. To receive 70k from 100k of junk loot I would be happy. Give the runners a bigger margin.

---
Which is not a death or extermination camp, as the term means in common parlance. You say concentration camp people think holocaust, not temporary storage for criminals before they get shipped back home.
---
Same issue with the concentration camps during the Boer war, just places to put captured people. You could call prisons concentration camps by this metric...
---
So long as they are being treated properly (Which doesn't always look to be the case) it's perfectly acceptable. Don't break into someone else's country.
---
I'm just putting "concentration camp" in same bag of words whose meanings have been completely destroyed or redefined. Racism, diversity, inclusion, now historical terms too.
---
Poo
---
not anymore, the cave was changed to be single-way a couple months ago unfortunately
---
superanti + shield means you can pray ranged, anything less and the dragonfire will still do a decent chunk of damage.
---
Yeah going to godwars and having to tab 1/3rd of the way during your trip because a naked level 120 logged in at the door scouting the right worlds to ddos was great fun for everyone
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Big yikers. Concentration means the concentration of one particular subset of people. Not death camp you absoloute melt lol.
---
LOL tell urself whatever u want ur gay af.  keep hiding behind 'alcohol' and excuses whatever makes u feel better
---
They go for pharaoh's sceptres and possibly the gold stuff. Trading in the stone stuff would be a waste of time for them. You could try to buy noted ones on GE but few people take the time to bank them, much less sell them.
---
If you're not decked out in solid gold why even play
---
Naw bro I've definitely kissed some dudes, I don't think I'm gay atleast
---
To be fair it's been 16 years and I still don't remotely see the resemblance between cooking and it's icon.
---
Do a little bit of everything and find what you like. Stick to it and make some bond money. Or not. Have fun!
---
This is why I did not want to say we madeout and shit. Fuck you I am not gay.
---
Not totally against this, but improving stamina potions in the way you suggested would be redundant as their effects are already sufficient
---
Correct on the rock cake thing. 
---
Upgrade all your stuff to black/blessed dhide when you can, it's a lot cheaper than your current setup which is nice. If you can afford it, adamant darts might give you a bit more xp/hr too.
---
It should have never been a requirement in the first place.
---
880/1012=86.9%
---
Really depends if you're f2p or p2p
---
YouTube and the osrs wiki have a lot more information on PvM for both f2p and p2p than you're likely to find here
---
I'd like to return these hammers for store credit, please.
---
Yeah, me too. I finally caught one of her streams live and just had to request Sea Shanty 2.
---
I know. I was just making the problem easier to understand for our r/cutenoobs
---
No ty
---
&gt; You say concentration camp people think holocaust
---
Yes, and a huge part of the early Holocaust was exactly that. Storing prisoners of war, political prisoners, and members of ethnic and religious minorities. It was not until about 1942 that some of the camps were changed to the death camps commonly referred to as simply concentration camps. But there was a huge difference between the camps. Most of them simply housed the prisoners (under horrible conditions where a lot of them died, but not explicitly intentionally so) until they could be transported to death camps. So even with the Holocaust, the definition of detaining or confining a large number of people still holds. That's literally why they were called concentration camps in the first place.
---
&gt; You could call prisons concentration camps by this metric...
---
Do normal criminal prisoners fall under the categories: "prisoners of war, political prisoners, refugees, or the members of an ethnic or religious minority"? No, so you can't refer to prisons as concentration camps.
---
&gt; So long as they are being treated properly (Which doesn't always look to be the case) it's perfectly acceptable. 
---
That's **exactly** what AOC is arguing. Separating small children from their parents is part of this improper treatment that makes it unacceptable.
---
&gt; I'm just putting "concentration camp" in same bag of words whose meanings have been completely destroyed or redefined. Racism, diversity, inclusion, now historical terms too.
---
Wtf does this even mean?
---
So people don't think holocaust and 6 million Jews (And 5 million more forgotten victims) when they hear concentration camp?
---
I know what the phrase means, and I know what people think when they hear it. I'm saying it's an attempt to emotionally manipulate people, something AOC and her progressive cronies are constantly doing. Tell me about how the world is ending in 12 years again AOC, that's not just rampant fear mongering.
---
No, that was for another area locked ironman i thought
---
O dang you're still around? HYT haven't seen you since the MSN days
---
Made out with a guy.
---
"no homo"
---
Sorry man but you are gay.
---
I noted that you've drawn this idea of what the evil left-wing does and that all on the left are like this. Why would you do that? Why would you give that much power to the fringe group on the outer 1%? I find it incredibly hypocritical that you drag the whole left, and AOC, into this fringe group while decrying people who do this to you. No, they shouldn't do this, so why are you doing the same?
---
&gt; It's racist to criticise a specific religion.
---
You're referring to islamophobia, I take it? Yes, that's racist. But islamophobia has nothing to do with criticism. It has everything to do with **disliking the practioners** of Islam. It think it warrants criticism that Islam is generally so far removed from secularism, but that doesn't mean I should start discriminating against its practioners because of it. That would be racism.
---
&gt; A film is diverse if the cast is almost entirely monoracial (Because diversity only means race to these people), so long as that race isn't white.
---
You're the one choosing to define it as "diversity only means race" by sharing that idea. Stop giving the fringe group that power.
---
What is meant here is that a movie in the US about black people is spreading diversity because it highlights a historically suppressed minority group. It would be the same with any minority group. It's not diverse if it's a Turkic film featuring only Turkic people.
---
&gt; Inclusion requires explicitly excluding people.
---
No, it doesn't. Again, you're giving too much power to the fringe group. Inclusion simply means inclusion.
---
&gt; Now we have putting illegal migrants in temporary facilities while they are processed being referred to by the same name as places that murdered over 10 million people.
---
This is completely irrelevant. You'd also call both buildings, but that doesn't make it bad. Both are concentration camps. Only one featured death camps. You can simply note that and move on rather than needing to redefine language.
---
&gt; with all that implies
---
It implies exactly what is said. Concentration camp because that's what it is. Nothing more, nothing less. Yes, it draws analogies to the Holocaust, but nobody starts thinking that the government will start literally gassing the refugees or shooting them.
---
&gt; No, she's implying that Trump is literally Hitler and this is his holocaust.
---
No, that's not the implication. That's what **you** think the implication is because to **you** she's malicious and corrupt. It says more about you than it says about AOC.
---
&gt; When you say concentration camp people don't think POWs or illegal immigrants, they think genocide. Is that so hard to understand? It's manipulative and I think it need a calling out.
---
I disagree. I can't speak for what others would think as I haven't asked around, but I certainly don't think of genocide. If I wanted to signal genocide, I'd call it death camps. You know, the term used to describe the concentration camps where the genocide took place?
---
Does that 'keep an extra item on death' prayer work on UIM?
---
1. We weren't talking about that at all, nice strawman
---
2. Prices of items absolutely will change if the distribution of wealth changes (people winning from these bots, which I actually believe does not happen with large amounts of money), and also if the wealth ends in the hands of people who don't know how to play the game (When the bots RWT the money). 
---
I'm never said we don't need gold sinks. I never discussed inflation or deflation at all. Thinking that these bots have no effect on the economy though shows me that YOU don't understand how economics work at all.
---
fuck that lmao
---
Tonnes of people are being hacked recently. Just do some skilling until Jagex fixes their security issues. It's still waiting for the day to man an account unrecoverable.

Yeah its really only if you want a lot of wild pies. Id say best uses are cerb, first whip, first hydra, and first thermy

Armour won't increase your DPS, but is worth getting unless you're training past 60's and have got the money for Dragon/Obsidian.

I actually wanted to get other skills to 90 to got farming while I was runecrafting got 90 hunter then construction and for the past 2 weeks I‚Äôve been lost on what to do....low and behold I‚Äôve now went back to runecrafting because I‚Äôm burned out of everything else wtf is wrong with me send help
---
No thank you my thoughts?
---
I assume you know it's in Farnborough, not London.
---
If you're staying in London, then there's plenty of stuff for people who aren't doing Runefest stuff to do. If you're staying at Farnborough, then there's very little.

This will end up being like the guy in Eve online who started the bank for players and 7 years later walked out with all the money in everyone's accounts

Hi,
---
Pretty sure this mod is legit like 4-5 years old and to top it off it's not like RS has the most intense graphics to base a build in Minecraft off of.
---
The guy has locked a player-to-player trade restricted account that can also not make use of a bank (to store items) to a specific area of the map. He is attempting to build his account up to a point where it would be able to beat the raid that's in the same area without leaving the place.
---
Is there any way to make it default log you into a safer world? Runelite logged me into a bounty world and I got gibbed trying to get ghostly robes. I lost nothing but it was time wasted, I didn't want to be anyones bounty :(

Wtf I have a kc of like 550 and have only gotten the onyx bolt tips 3 times.
---
&lt;3, been using it for a long time now and i love how it shows the progress.

for ranged weapons you pretty much always use rapid, atk speed is generally the most important factor in pvm combat.

Gotta alch them dragon bones for that big profit!

This is amazing, been looking forward to a new video :D can't wait for the next one

Deliveritems cc works because it's not a business, it's a community of helpful volunteers.  
---
Once you make it about money, people will realise buying loot is incredibly trash gp/hr, and leave.  
---
It's why deliveritems has guidelines in place which protect the volunteers from getting abused by people using it as their personal ge.  
---
That way its purpose of helping people in need is easily maintainable.
---
Every house style has different music.

Just use pies to as food. They keep your invent full when you eat them so your items never get removed.

Wanna come watch me ruin this game for myself by trying to get 99 fletching? 
---
(In all seriousness, this is a great idea)

Yea I wasn't set on the exact item to combine; just the fact that I would like to see a mage variant

if you have your house setup and fremmy boots then you save 40 seconds on a kill with good bgs spec

Wait is that the real OSRS_HELL back on the sub??
---
wait lol zanaris is the moon

should try it
---
His videos are definitely top tier, but these memes of him are too exaggerated

They're not concentration camps lmao wtf.
---
99 one at a time probably
---
Vorkath has a very low defence level of 214 so even small hits make a big difference.

However, I normally tele out after 0-0 purely out of spite

Great job u nerd boy!

That cheered me up. Thanks for that.

Im at nearing 11k and maybe have been dropped to 20 hp lowest. And i do kraken while playing league so im super afking it

You can get it from cormorant fishing in Kourend
---
20 hours in Swampman time is only a few seconds for us. He couldn't care less how efficiently he spends 20 hours if it's for an experimental method.
---
Remember how he spent 10 straight hours to have a 40% chance of completing a medium clue to have a 1/300 chance of getting a BiS prayer cape. To a normal person this is not worth attempting, but to Swampman it's another step of the staircase.
---
It‚Äôs not an indefensible argument just because you say it is lol. It‚Äôs the stereotype for a reason bud. One 99 skill is time consuming in of itself. Imagine all that time for every single skill. You know that kid‚Äôs not getting any pussy. And quite likely breathing through his mouth.
---
Isn't that most streamers?
---
Slayer helm and torture for melee. Void and salve for range.
---
So what grinds does he have left? Smithing,   herblore, 99 melees and range, rune xbow, making bolts?

Ooo okee, zag er laatst ook een in Eindhoven

Ardy cloak lets you recharge prayer and somewhat close bank access as well as being close to a fairy ring.

"a place in which large numbers of people, especially political prisoners or members of persecuted minorities, are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities, *sometimes* to provide forced labour or to await mass execution"
---
Look up the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally. People were literally walking around waving flags with nazi symbols and sometimes literal swastikas, shouting "blood and soil" and "jews will not replace us". The one where a white supremacist drove into a crowd of counter protesters. Where the US president said "there are fine people on both sides". Those are the people that are called nazis since they literally are nazis.

I know the feeling, especially agility, it's a real struggle, it would be easier if not trying to get the gracefull outfit, those rooftops really takes it toll.

I have about 36k monkfish in my bank I've been fishing for months. Still nothing lol.
---
I have an alt I play when slaying. All it does is smith cannon balls. Has like 25 mining or some shit. And literally over done 32 or whatever to 97 via calls only. Gargoyles feed him and as do other slay tasks. But this isn't uncommon at all.

F2P pkers Tele up with ghorrock Tele, burning amulet or wildy obelisk in a member world and then hop to f2p to get to the rune rocks pking hotspot. Catching them before they hop worlds is quite rare. But if you do manage to catch one, they are generally toxic and flame you while they are trying to tank on anchovy pizzas and swordfish.

You might save 40 seconds with a good spec but it would take just as long considering you have already wasted time starting the fight and then have to tele out, run back, restart the fight and double spec again. When you get in the habit to tele out and you have 4 bad specs in a row then its just so much wasted time.
---
I am not looking for an answer directly per se, i know i've listed this post as a question but i just was curious how many rs players out there was struggling with some aspects of the game because of their disabilities. I don't want an EasyScape, we had that when the knuckleheads at Jagex ruined RS2/RS3.
---
In a way i love to endure those hard aspects of the game because that makes achieving the goal so much sweeter.
---
can i get Nice one
---
You eventually do everything. Have fun with it. Do a bit of everything.
---
Yeah I'm still looking for the harpoon on my iron. I had rushed for 95 slay right as kebos came out so the prayer from hydra completely dwarfed anything else and I just can't bother with small bones anymore lol.
---
I plan to use up the 35k karambwanji I have then do swan song and fish monkfish until I can fish anglerfish. Should be quite an adventure.

Embrace your dopamine at the entrance of TOB wearing Best-In-Slot Morytania gear (pre TOB)

I am still using the official client, generally i am against using 3rd party clients since they give such unfair advantages in the game. But i totally understand and support your need for it and i am glad it enables you to play the game on a good level. I don't thing i will be using Runelite (+) but who knows in the future, thank you for replying.

My motivation is Morytania Elites. I‚Äôm currently 90 fishing. Going to get 91 then admiral pie boost. Then it‚Äôs all about cooking them. Should get me to 97 cooking.

The presidential quote was derived from the argument about the statue, not the guy driving the car, something with context again.

I think what you're doing is called 'The texas sharpshooter'..anyway, so weird to see with how much hatred you people argue about politics in America..
---
I just hunted for orange spices for a +5 construction boost for long enough that my kitten grew into a cat
---
I am not complaining about the game or it's difficulty, i love runescape and i will play it until the day i either die or the game dies. But it is nice hearing from others who also having trouble with some aspects of the game because of one or more disabilites, and also getting advice from those. That's what is so great about runescape,  there are so many ways to play it.
---
You can disable it in settings by clicking the bond icon.
---
Every skill has Some sort of value for quest or diaries for example. But if i had to choose i would say that Slayer is the most usefull and herblore is the most useless because you can buy the pots and its very expensive imo.
---
Do you have to kill the tber? Or can the tber just suicide. If you have to kill the tber, I don't see the downside. If the tber suiciding will remove the tb, then it's a huge problem
---
It's I Suck Cocks btw
---
I'm not going to continue arguing with you. If you say so.
---
No.
---
Say it louder for the people in the back please!
---
Construction is really helpful for teleports and restoring your stats but can be a little expensive to train.
---
wasn't it lvl 3 corp beast?
---
The ironman NPCs in lumbridge are clearly based on streamers. They have set a precedent of doing this, it wouldn't even change the standard.
---
Not great, not terrible
---
If you have a quest Cape you can almost certainly just do the new quest. Ezpz
---
Haha, why do you think RuneScape uses so little data?
---
My goal is a maxed account. Losing items is a setback but can be replaced.
---
Beautiful
---
Magic useful. 
---
Firemaking useless.
---
i dont see an issue, just buy BiS
---
I was averaging about 300k XP per hour on mobile. Blue d'hide body's fairly cheap at the moment at 2.7gp per XP

Took me a few weeks starting at 88 crafting
---
Fuck I really like this idea
---
Literally every single game that interacts with the web does so with data packages. But yes, I guess that's true.
---
Possible to download?
---
Could explore accuracy, or if anything could unlock the ability to finally create 85-90 tier weapons now that 50-75 tiers are less likely to 1 hit you.
---
A 1 tick MSB to AGS can stack you easily into the 90s currently. I use to love edge pking, but now the only pking that feels balanced is NH hybridding. An amazing pker rarely dies when nhing due to the negation of damage of overhead prayers, but the same pker eventually get's 1 hit during standard edge style.
---
It would take a few weeks of test servers being up before anyone could say for sure though, could easily nerf karams like I believe they did in the past?
---
This is absolutely perfect. The epitome of inside joke, but a huge portion of the player base is involved.
---
What is that hand slot
---
As everyone else has already pointed out, it's a bullshit RNG simulator, what do you expect. The **real** question is, why tf would that guy stake into someone with that much higher stats? Unless the stake wasn't equal on both sides...
---
https://youtu.be/BV7RkEL6oRc
---
Probably too high of a defense to pk until you have really good stats, I would start another and just crank out slayer until you get to 75/77 and start making some real money. You can build that acct into a pker later on though, 75att 99str 75 def is a really common build that is really strong. Or you could get 45 def and be a zerker pure!

MANBEARPIG! I'm being super serions right now guys!

Not douchey at all - this was exactly the response I was hoping for! I just started playing a couple weeks ago for the first time since 2006, so I really appreciate all thee info.

you've done this to yourself

Wrong. Judging by the other players gear and the mini map this is very recent. You‚Äôre just a noob, nothing to be ashamed of.

RIP pink marker. They will be missed.

Why are bronze spears so much more expensive than iron ones!?
---
Not for only 70% value of loot.
---
Ah, the Finglish. It's so beautifull
---
Yep, but several players have above 4b total. 2nd place is also mere days off max xp.
---
What you mean you don't want to watch fed people doing the same thing for a 14th time??? But seriously, it's largely Jagexs fault, every time there's a new meta discovered they just outright ban it next time.  The clan shutting down the quest did more last season than anyone else at mixing up the content, what did they get for it?  Oh yea there plan was ruined in the following tournament and their advantage was nullified by people getting the quest in the re-run.  But don't worry big changes will be coming soon!  (Except we won't say what they are, when they'll happen or give any other details, but don't worry there will be big changes soon!)

Trump: "Yes, I think there‚Äôs blame on both sides. If you look at both sides -- I think there‚Äôs blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it, and you don‚Äôt have any doubt about it either. And if you reported it accurately, you would say."

GOT DAMN

&gt; We will buy the loot from you at a rate of 70 percent so that runners will have an incentive to make a profit of 30 percent.
---
low IQ
---
You're not designing an incentive. One variable is empty: loot value. 30% of 5M is 1,5m profit on the run.
---
30% of 300k is just 90k, that's barely profitable for a one-time thing. The noobies who could actually do this for eficient gp will lack the req.s to fast travel anywhere lul
---
You should instead add a flat fee related to traveling distance on top of a % bite.
---
If you sold bills you wouldn't care that much about 500k, lmao.

But you can't do that reliably. :/

The Instagram era of politics. Pairs well with Twitter politics I guess.

No it isn't.

It isn't EVER mentioned in OSRS, except by Konar which is a relatively new addition to the game.

It's only mentioned in RS3 otherwise which is not the same

Because they‚Äôre terrible? Why don‚Äôt people like Brussels sprouts...cus they‚Äôre bad

you can enter tob by either walkigg from the ectophial teleport or paying a guy whos north of ectophial to bring you there. all the quest does is give u a teleport there directly

You aren‚Äôt as smart as you think you are, buddy. The fight I‚Äôm referring to is the fight to better the conditions that these children are living in. This has nothing to do with AOC‚Äôs stance on illegal immigration, because these kids are seeking LEGAL asylum. They aren‚Äôt criminals. They turned themselves in at the border, and are intentionally being held in inadequate conditions while being denied the right to a speedy trial. So, how about you fee free to re-read my comment carefully and slowly, seeing as reading comprehension isn‚Äôt your strong suit.

I have the stats for a quest cape on 2 different accounts that don't have the levels for the new quest.

As someone who exclusively plays on pures, that's hilarious!

Only they can because I do in fact enjoy the game.

If you don‚Äôt like Brussels sprouts you‚Äôre cooking them wrong lmao

Holy fuck bruh

Theyve been saying for 2 years big changes will be coming to the next season, nothing has changed since the PvP weapons

That's what I do Haha and I am a filthy casual.

Oh no people don‚Äôt like racism and as a racist that really scares me! This evil fringe left is going to restrict my rights to be racist!

Someone‚Äôs upset that they only play a pure.

You could do your diaries if you haven‚Äôt.

I'd say most of the community has moved on from the tribalism between account types and gets along. I can't remember the last time someone made an ironman meme that *wasn't* tonge-in-cheek and in good fun.

I did too and the spice part sucked ass
---
Man if I didnt get my name sniped , I would've just given it to J1mmy. Dude deserves it , awesome content creator and consistent guy.
---
Rsn was Jimmy
---
yeah bud thats why i specifically said in another comment that its probably fine to keep these garbage death mechanics if jagex isnt going to make their servers better.
---
Do freminik trials/isles to get the berserker helm/neitiznot helm 
---
Start working on your skills so you can finish Recipe For Disaster to upgrade your gloves to barrows (requirements are on the wiki) 
---
Work on doing pest control to get the fighter torso
---
Use D scim instead of the hammer as it‚Äôs better DPS for all stats 
---
Possibly upgrade to obby legs for the STR
---
I‚Äôd also recommend doing fairy tale part 1 and part of fairy tale part 2 to get fairy rings as it makes slayer and general runescape so much easier.
---
&gt;The fight I‚Äôm referring to is the fight to better the conditions that these children are living in.

---
I think you might genuinely be a moron. The point you seem to have completely missed is that *nowwhere in my comment did I imply that fighting to better the conditions that these children live in is a bad thing.* It's really not that fucking hard. The point I made is that *AOC is not fighting for that.* I have no doubt you think she is, but in reality, she absolutely is not. I would be very careful to criticise my reading comprehension seeing as you just made a total fool of yourself. 
---
&gt;There‚Äôs a reason your initial comment, that you think is so well thought out, is being down downvoted to hell in a politically neutral, if not right leaning, subreddit. It‚Äôs idiotic.
---
I'm pretty sure its more likely that it was just entirely misunderstood. You certainly did. In any event, the phrase "the wolf does not concern himself with the opinion of the sheep" comes to mind.
---
Damn I sure do hate people that signal their virtue by opposing concentration camps. We get it, you have morals.
---
I didn't say he was in multi, that the client was mapping out multi, idiot.
---
Runelite plus is a scam and not part of runelite. Runelite has been approved by jagex and often removes plugins to remain an approved client.
---
Lol I kinda hope not. This series has basically turned into a tv episode for me.
---
I'm sure torch wudve done the same if a certain person hadnt targeted him last tourney. Solo Mission is really good too
---
It's runelite npc aggression lines
---
I need to get 70 construction and 70 herblore. I'm dirt poor atm ;_;
---
Not everyone makes enough money ingame to afford bonds.
---
They're literally not doing any until they re-vamp it. It's not like they already have a date for the next one and don't have time to do it. They can also just do the all starts event in the mean time
---
Is it a plugin or mod? Cuz if it's a plugin+resource pack I could run it in my minecraft network, I would love to.

Damn man somebody woke up on the wrong side of the swamp

Yep, not sure what Jagex was thinking here lol

Oh no no, you do indeed need a kitten/cat for a couple of quests lmao, I just did it all with a kitten
---
13 is what I see most often.  However, 31 or even 44-52 isn‚Äôt super uncommon.

thats what wyverncc is for

This pisses me off: defensive bonuses should reduce damage, not have a chance to make a fight more boring
---
Mark of grace is?

And now you've done all that and have it out of the way. I treat clues like goals. If I can't do a clue and the requirement isn't too insane I'll keep it in my bank and go get the requirements.

Did you even read the post? The suggestion is a clue step
---
Haha, I'll make sure to ask tons of questions to you in the future. :)
---
The bosses thing has occured to me, and after a bit of looking up and playing with the DPS calculator I've found which bosses I will be going for. They require a few quests though so I will do these later today. 
---
My xp was very slow indeed, and using the calculator it showed that an msb wouldn't have that much influence. Because of my struggle with nmz I've switched over to ammonite crabs for today, and there my xp rates are quite great (45k/hour, which is the same as my expected rates in nmz according to the calculator). Honestly, I might stay here the next few days, since they drop fossils as well and are very close to the birdhouses. 
---
And uh, I completely forgot about the ranging potions, hehe. Definitely using those next time.
---
Thanks again for your answers, they really help a ton! It would take ages to find all this knowledge online. I really appreciate it. :)
---
Settled will probably disagree with this, the mods almost out a spinning wheel on canifis and he replied to the mod not to. He does not want the game changed for his sake
---
 70 is such a low level. OSRS has been around for  years now, it's hard  to imagine people still struggling to get at least base 70s when you can  get help with runelite, so many youtube guides, and wiki for all the  best xp rates possible not to mention new skilling methods that weren't  out back in the day. Song of the elves should have been 80 req.
---
Hmm. So If I do Blessed Spirit Shield, do I use void with that or just tank melee gear?
---
Nah but I don't see 70 people commenting while still getting -70 m. Idc about karma but I know they're people downvoting just because I'm opposed to their tought. And when it's about settled I Always get those reactions, funny really. Like some people need a god or something that you must universally recognize. 
---
 
---
You're welcome to argue
---
Sorry I thought it was a clue reward like the Uri emote, yeah read it wrong.
---
First ever fashionscape I‚Äôm upvoting
---
Step 1: keep wyrms blocked, they are dogshit
---
Step 2: get barrows gloves before pointing out someone else's flaws.
---
Step 3: clean that dirty ass screen
---
Couldn‚Äôt all this be solved with a nature and a couple fire tunes?
---
Dmm is sleep content every time anyway. You will never make an esport jagex
---
They will 100% poll it over 10 times in the next few years until it passes
---
I may be lacking comprehension before my morning coffee, but you insinuated that claiming ICE detention was worse than homelessness was wrong. I replied saying that ICE detention is indeed worse than homelessness.
---
That react video was fun to watch. He went from shitting on the game to being very impressed with the expansive quest lines and the community sentiment that playing/unlocking content is its own reward.
---
At 254 kc damn.
---
Tank melee gear over void. The brothers have such low defense that you won't need to worry about magic offense.
---
Yes it was, and I went into it disliking the guy very much. But if he can change his opinion so can I

Noooo way lmfaoooo that‚Äôs nice to know

It's definitely fun and has a really thriving community. The only thing to bear in mind is that it takes a pretty big time commitment to progress. One of the nice things is that a lot of training methods are AFK or semi-AFK though so it doesn't take up quite as much as it would otherwise.

Yeah, Obama and Merkel used to have very similar school of politics and Merkel of course is part of the christian-democratic union, which is centre-right in Germany. Trump is seen as extremly far right here, which is why basically no german ever would support him. Sanders would fit well into the social-democratic party which is centre-left here. Our Linke party (Linke = left) is so left, 80% of americans would get a heart attack. There are also even more left parties, but noone votes for them.
---
Burn it (delete it) before it multiplies.
---
They have their use now for new players. They are a firm upgrade over rune but offer no offensive bonuses. fills a nice gap between rune and more expensive/harder to achieve armour pieces such as fighter torso, obsidian, helm of neitiznot.

Downvoted by 11 year olds including me.

There isn't a task ordering him to get 3rd age pick
---
What's the most underrated skill?
---
I believe you're correct, except 91hp as missing 90 hp is same as missing 91-98hp
---
Yeah i think youre right. I'd add fero gloves to the setup if theyre available too
---
Oh it used to be 3 I am pretty sure for the middle boat. Still 1 point per game makes a difference. I am not sure even if void would be worth it still. Am actually not sure you would probably be better off using a max hit calculator to figure it out if it would be better then what you currently have.
---
I occasionally just go on to f2p ask what the person's cash stack is and give them twice that. I try to do this in places with the most legit players training. The reactions to getting 10-100k are amazing.
---
Hah, IRONy.
---
Uim btw ...
---
And the worst part is he has contacted Jagex about the issue and there's nothing they can do. His account can't even be recovered, meaning the person/people who are doing this are just doing it out of spite so he can't play the game.
---
It's only a matter of time.  With Mod Matt K out, our Chinese overlords will no doubt implement some form of mtx within the next year or two.  Why should gold farmers and bot owners be the ones profiting from selling gold when Jagex and it's parent company could be.

Haha yeah dude like literally despute no it fucking don't

---
Apologies if these questions have been asked before but I have just a couple. 
---
First off, when training ranged (not cannoning or chinning), is it better exp to use a magic shortbow imbued, or to use a crossbow with an offhand?
---
My other question is when is it better exp for ranged, magic, and melee to use void knight gear as opposed to high strength gear for melee, and higher accuracy gear for magic and ranged?
---
Your production skills are sky rocketing
---
Firemaking is still useless. Having higher firemaking barely helps at wintertodt, it just makes you take a little less damage. You still do it just as fast and get just as many rewards.
---
Streamers aren‚Äôt suppose to win it.
---
It's obviously not dogshit to a lot of people.
---
I'm sorry you're such an angry person. I hope you work out your issues.
---
Wines are obscenely fast.

It is a fantasy game. That explains why they get on the moon and even survive

Try how would Villager sandals (yellow) or purple Graceful boots and purple Graceful gloves look like with that set. Your current gloves &amp; boots hue hurts my eye, otherwise your purple theme is nice and cool. ;)

Omg I loved those books when I was little. I should revisit them!

Wow didnt know you can smoke the staff
---
Have you ever considered that his series isn't dogshit and that maybe you just hold an unpopular opinion?
---
Your argument is pretty cute though. The "he is bad", is a subjective opinion which the community in large seems to disagree with wholeheartedly, and me, a stranger on the internet who thinks differently than you has apparently slurped too much swamp cum. You make real good points and definitely don't look stupid.

the slayer tome part is rng, you could go a hour dry playing a piece of horribly outdated and clunky dead content to complete a step adding solely for the sake of fanfare yeah ill pass. Regardless people shouldn't have to temple trek for a step that noone would ever have even thought about if a youtuber didn't waste 500 hours doing it
---
Obviously autistic manchildren love him, why else would they call him dad? He knows this, why do you think he's making merch?
---
It was cool to watch at the beginning and then he hit a massive wall that is absolutely not a good viewing experience.

I always thought zanaris was underground

Maybe just for fashion.

This is my cross to bear. The post was exclusively people starting new nice threads, someone had to do it.
---
Main thing about wyvern cc is people didn‚Äôt want to lose agro and they would lose ppots and herb drops and wanted range pots
---
I genuinely wasn‚Äôt sure if this was a troll for a second, best get cooking for those levels though mate, no boost for +10 levels.
---
xp is better, especially with double trouble
---
Yea cause theres so many rune dragon alts now these 3 items have price crashed hard
---
Yea dalekcookie is pretty good. She's also very good at the game, e.g. she does tob and inferno and whatnot.
---
Dude was an asshole but this is some tumblr shit you gnome
---
meh, a one of drop that literally everyone doing master clues has anyway vs a repeatable rng based step added soley to appease a youtubers fanboys wouldn't say its comparable but does invalidate my blanket statement
---
It was his friend and they had been pking together since early on in the tournament. He was backstabbed.

It's not a joke though.. that is one dirty af screen. Can only imagine what your room/bathroom looks like
---
I'm using red dhide body, green dhide legs, bgloves and a snakeskin bandana and shoes atm.

It's more about the accuracy though, since blue dragons have quite some defence.

Looks like a shout on your wrist to me

Same thing is happening on my Late 2015 iMac (latest Mojave/latest updates).

Hey guys, i recently downloaded old school runescape on my android device and for some reason won't let me log in and play. Anyone got the same problem?
---
I mean the post didn't say immediately
---
What's the best way to get slayer points? Trying to get the amount needed for a slayer helmet. I've been doing tasks from the Shilo guy and I've had to skip steel dragons once so far.
---
Decent, but the text font makes it nearly impossible to read :( I would recommend changing that in the future
---
Its a ruse to add another morytania step for swamp man to juggle for

It snuck in to the picture, nothing I could do, honest...

Lumps are valued at 2.3 but don‚Äôt sell for that. You have to make the plate for it to be worth anything

You generally get more accuracy off dhide. Trying inputting gear on this https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit#gid=158500257
---
My arguement is absolutely not "he's bad". The fact that you people will watch him do 17k temple treks is worrying. How could you possibly enjoy that? He's playing the game in the most unique way? Really? Is that why there are tons of other, area locked UIMs, what is it that makes it such great content? I seriously don't get it.
---

Do we even know anything about Raids 3? Does it even exist?

Not salty or complaining about it, just remarking on the odds lol.

Wow retail doesn't have game progression mtx, iiirc

:) i xfered my bank to my main and whent pking right after, made about 8 mil. I'm taking it as a lesson learned lol.
---
I found out that if you do not want to beat every healer one by one, simply aggro them with chinchompas ^^
---
Not butthurt about it really, but I would get something rarer than what I'd actually like to get. Just remarking on that
---
Because he fucking makes great content, the only reason why you dislike him is because he is popular.
---
This has been a great help to me:

Thank you MLG Pro ironman, I appreciate your reply.
---
Why did you stop playing before?  Lost time? Yes come back if you have more time now. Hated the grind?  Sorry the grind is the game and I would suggest looking for something else.
---
I can see in pic an earth rune
---
They said Summer 2019, so realistically it‚Äôll come out Spring 2020
---
Yeah I hear you. Very hard community to please.  Im not advocating necessarily for an exact copy. I think balancing is a good thing to make them fit our game properly. Not sure about rs3 as I haven‚Äôt played since like 2012.
---
You want him to lamp is construction how high?

That was the only time I was on the top page of a skills high scores. Got lucky with a bunch of genies and just kept taking because I never got any seeds.

Having a different opinion isn't trolling!

Your initial comment passes the 'casual respect' territory.

Also, are the requirements not subject to change?

From what I remember of the tunnels, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anywhere where you‚Äôll have the space needed to set one up, although I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs expressly un-doable

I don't get it. Anyone care to make this thick skull understand?
---
Not always the case, I have a maxed pure that I outbrid tons of zerks on. It's all about skill-gaps. Yeah zerks should win in most cases though purely because they have better gear stats than a pure does but it isn't a guarantee. I also have a 20 def account that SHREKS 70 def accounts so.
---
It is pretty brutal. Grinding out Level 5 all Roles in Barbarian Assault while not being able to talk was a mess. I had to attract the attention of party leaders by running around and using the Beckon emote like a spastic.
---
Has nothing to do with race. Illegal is illegal. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Unfortunate that kids get drug along and put in these circumstances

This six year old stole a lollipop from the store i work at,  I should‚Äôve done a citizen‚Äôs arrest.

Ye, i would just say bronze plateskirt, snelm, iron chainbody. The cape changes

why?
---
Also I just got the shield half again, so fuck me dead
---
I wouldn't expect anything less of customer support.
---
...why do you think we all play OSRS?
---
I think keyboard shortcuts for dropdown menus would be the best reasonable QoL update for runecrafting. It would be a pretty big change to the game, but with things like menu entry swapper and WMK already used by so many players, maybe it's the right call.  
---
All that said, I don't support any major changes to runecrafting itself.
---
What kind of windows do you have?

they're **children** fleeing desperation in their home countries

just because it's The Law doesn't make it just, not by a long shot

Oh no not at all. Just saying this used to be a thing back in the day and briefly when 2007scape launched. It's really cool!
---
Still
---
In rs3 we have pets that pickup ur stuff, cost like $40 lmao
---
took a second but its good bucko
---
Graphics of osrs arent even bad. I mean look at minecraft.
---
I'm not entirely sure, but it seems an upgraded version of the weapon goes from two handed to one handed. He paid 300k to take his hand off.
---
If you're not a streamer or a god-tier pvper with a shot at winning then it's just a week of playing RuneScape without a single XP or GP to show for it
---
Oh shit you right. Idk what I was thinking
---
Or just you know, not touch microtransactions. Its not that hard. Ive been playing Runescape 3 nonironman without touching treasure hunter. I actually enjoy OSRS more, but play Runescape 3 because it has more of the content I enjoy (more skills, more quests, actual finished questlines).
---
OSRS is better in almost every other aspect, but the quests are a dealbreaker for me.
---
In osrs theres an easy way to prove u made ur money legit or u bought it/gambled for it. Gather skills+boss kc‚Äôs

Slayer staff bummers

Lol it's not a concentration camp of you can avoid going there by going the other direction.

It's not a concentration camp if they have couches and ps4's. Shit I don't even have a PS4.

Fun fact GWD2 isn‚Äôt nex it‚Äôs a whole ‚Äònother GWD in the desert. Zaros vs Seren vs Sliske vs Zamorak. It features a neat dual boss, two bosses with a shared health pool

I think it's a stock pot, you boil bones in water to make bone stock which is a base for some soups.
---
Then don't buy it? It's literally that easy.
---
That's just too much for me to watch...
---
Yeah, my account got banned for saying things like "fag" and "suck it" back in the day, now you can say whatever.
---
&gt; Thank you Jagex for keeping OSRS clean of that bullshit 
---
Bonds. It really disappoints me when some in my CC asks for money making advice and someone just replies "buy bonds". I feel like money making is a large aspect of OSRS, and they've really cut into that by making it P2W.

Yes and they had eoc planned before then...you think they just make updates on the fly?
---
yes, the dragon square shield is the one exception to this with the obby shield. However, the obby helm is 800k, which is a big investment for a noob for a helmet. 
---
The point is, a lot of dragon equipment that a lot more experienced players would consider useless are usefull for noobs. That is why you see many 'cute noobs' wearing Dmed helm, rune/granite plate and dragon platelegs instead of the better options.
---
Then don't buy it lmao. why are you so salty? You're not forced to buy it. It's $25 for a shirt which is actually is sort of reasonable. Could be worse, the shirt could be $50.
---
He just accurately summed up 90% of popular streamers in a sentence there.

---
If they have bare minimum quest cape stats they could with a few hours of grinding until the release
---
And you've done this
---
I think Fairy Tale 2 was originally a quest requirement to use the fairy rings, but they did en up removing that. But this close to release? I don‚Äôt expect anything else to change. I am super excited for the new content, even if it will turn my quest cape into a 99k paperweight for a little bit!
---
Working now, and then blast furnace pump all night when I get home.
---
Luckily for you, you don't need a max cape in order to enjoy this game. The existence of the max cape is something that shouldn't even be taken into consideration when voting on a new skill tbh.
---
What's there to discuss? Just do it!!

they bumped slayer to 120 but the highest level creature was a 110 req until more got released
---
the reputation system took longer to finish than Zeah favour did on release (and they released menaphos knowing full well how much the community disliked the Zeah favour grind)
---
RS3 quickchat is one of the things that i think OSRS could use. only risk is devaluing ironmemes because the quickchat icon would distract people from the helmets
---
Smithing spears is locked behind a quest, drops aren't
---
I think I had the same problem but with an older Windows when osrs was released. But Win10 fixed that for me..
---
YA! Fuck people that try to make make money! Dude should do this shit for free and live off welfare!
---
Or practice flicking. You're gonna get to the inferno at some point
---
You do understand that practically this entire subs rips on Jagex for turning Runescape/RS3 into a giant fucking cash grab right? And it's one of the many reasons people play OSRS is because there's no squeal of fortune, no buyable xp lamps etc?
---
Yeah so no whip, maybe a flail?
---
You're a kind man
---
I boosted my agility reqs so I had a bigger grind.  Farming isn't much of an investment if you have been doing herb and hardwood runs.  The time it takes to finish all the quests you'll have earned enough.  Obviously different story if you neglected farming training
---

what version is this on? is it 1.7.10?
---
Blowpipe makes it way easier and takes less time. I did it on my second attempt with blowpipe. It's not needed but helps a ton.
---
Turn aid off
---
The two are definitely a tier above every other content creator by far though. Rendi goes far more into the mechanical side of the game while Settled is a way better entertainer.

Is the summer special only available for people who are not subscribed currently? When I go to the page to buy it, it says: "One or more of the items could not be added to your basket, this may be because you already own the item or it is unavailable at this time. Please get in touch if you require further assistance."

---
It was brought up on this week‚Äôs Q&amp;A stream and in the past. Nex requires multiple engine features that aren‚Äôt available to OSRS. The example usually given is that it isn‚Äôt possible to make bosses run.
---
Well, yeah, because he most likely used an autoclicker thinking he'd get away with it.
---
You won‚Äôt make any money merching with 200k.
---
It's an opinion. 
---
It's an npc that stands on all the rooftop courses waving at you, and you run those same courses a loong time. It's annoying as hell. 
---
It would be different if he actually had a use like a rooftop black market, but nope. Just an uninteractable npc.
---
Same goes for Swampletics. If they made him an npc that would say something nifty and put him somewhere where nobody normally walks, a corner of the swamp or something, I wouldn't mind that.
---
He should not be an annoyance in any way.
---
The tile 17 squares south of zuk inferno locked uim

Generous AF
---
I definitely feel that. I tried out RS3 for a couple weeks for the frist time somewhat recently. I was totally blown away by a quest; can't remember the name of it, but it was in the desert and was music themed. 
---
But the prospect of maintaining two accounts was really overwhelming. Not just because of the playtime, but the amount of planning that goes into achieving progress is really difficult in two games with tons of content. I ended up sticking with OSRS, mostly because I could plan long-term goals more confidently. 
---
That being said, if I ever get super burntout on OSRS then I'll give RS3 another stab. Even just casually exploring a few quests was pretty entertaining.
---
Those bots will go away the moment people stop giving them money lol
---
Because its fun to feel immersed in a world and you can't really do that when there's only 6 polygons for a character's face. 
---
An incredible looking game like Uncharted 4 simply would not be as gripping if it were made back with ps1 graphics technology.
---
Hope this quest gives us the option to burn the whole fucking elf lands and underground pass to the ground.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs close to 50/50

How is a clue step involving wearing gear that he uses in the series not subtle enough
---
dont mention it to jagex , they prefer to make a weakly update that is not important to the game instead of dealing with content problems , bugs , security and ofc the bots problem.
---
ye ye and now everyone will mention that those who works on developing and security and other things are other ppl, but its seems like none realy works on those issue so.....
---
That is just company speak for "We don't have anything".
---
I might be mistaken but I'm pretty sure pedophilia is only if they're below the age of 16 as most states in America (as well as many other countries) age of consent is 16-17. This is more-so walking on the border of being borderline legal depending on where you live.
---
Nah that got shot down because the area's too small. Who knows if they'll add new reqs for the Western Provinces diary though.

You can play both at the same time, they're afk enough

When I try to check the evidence for the Manual Perm Mute, this is what it says.

Does this mean as an american I can get a Jamflex job now?

---
You said mark donalds didn‚Äôt you
---
Turn off aid? what does that mean?
---
alot of easy clue steps in this area =p
---
Dont bother, Gold has no critical thinking skills and never bothered reading the post. He is just parroting what he has been trained to say.
---
I dont understand what that is
---
Yeah the 1 acc per sub is pretty bad, but the sub itself supports the entire system by keeping it from having a store and driving herds of players like me out.
---
there are few countries in the world in a state where your life is genuinely at risk on a day to day basis. the only illegal immigrants the US should have accepted in the last few years are syrians and people along those lines i.e those fleeing an actual war. 
---
i don't really care that guatemala or mexico are high crime rate shitholes, that doesn't mean the people there are entitled to come to the states illegally. [ex-ussr and related sphere still have relatively high crime rates for european standards](http://i.imgur.com/SnlrJea.png) but you don't see those people illegally entering germany in droves, if they leave their countries they take legal methods to do so.
---
What sign have you seen of MTX coming to OSRS, honestly? I don't see anything that warrants for "They'll show their shitty side soon enough" - I understand if you don't like some updates or whatever. But in no way have I seen them force or try to ease the community up for MTX.
---
Legendary pets do not cost 40 bucks
---
Life is too short to learn german :D
---
Flesh crawlers in barbarian village stronghold of security  drop decent amount of rannar weed if your p2p and I guess noted iron ore is decent if your f2p
---
If anything it‚Äôs been proven that MTXs bring players in tbh
---
Ah well that‚Äôs the thing. I watch more mainstream YouTubers like b0aty, framed, torv so I feel like it‚Äôs just the same things over and over again.
---
No YOU have a good day
---
Is there a statute of limitations on using an auto-clicker? Like if ~~I~~ my friend used an auto-clicker a year ago what are the chances Jagex bans ~~me~~ them?
---
I think that‚Äôs the point, you got 8/8 that‚Äôs pretty good.
---
Another problem I have is, I keep thinking "How long is RS3 going to last?".
---
If I had a guarantee that RS3 would still be relatively healthy ("Healthy", as healthy as it is today), then I would play OSRS no question. But I keep thinking to myself "I really want to play these quests, what if one day I cant and I pass my chance to do so?"
---
The max amount recognized its 65k. Its also the limit on npc kills for the logs. If u drop 1b on the floor a client will read it as 65k.
---
Damn that‚Äôs rough, F
---
I used to spend so many hours playing the connect 4 game, was above the average but my 12 year old brain couldn't get past the second room. This would be a dope change
---
If either of those things were what triggered the mute, I'll own it and accept that the punishment fits. I sincerely don't think that is the case, however.
---
Cleaned it not too long ago, it was dirty as hell
---
Gold will always be buyable. Better Jagex get it than some Indian bot farm
---
Corp just has flat damage reduction regardless of how many times you spec him. So you still use the spear.
---
I think asmon's main issue with the store was that the store mounts are always super unique while the achievable ones are just shitty reeeecolors

As you are all commenting, I am not trying to prove the droprate. I am showing an indication to what you could expect. Also I thought it was nice to see the difference between barrows with and without the completion of the diary.

Math checks out

Can confirm, was manually permanently muted many times for saying 'markdonalds' a few years ago in his CC. Was worth it.
---
Nope. People shat all over it, so it's not happening anymore.

That does sound good

Does anyone have 530m lying about to buy jagex?

Seriously if we have like a rich bitch who plays this game please buy it so we can bother you with our issues.

This post is sooo true to me. I ran out of zulrah scales on wave 61  I accidentally took strength potions out instead on brew and got to wave 30 before I realise and the healers done me everytime

Good luck, my OG account was perm muted in 2011 because idiot 15 year old me mentioned at GE that someone pmed me a website link and I typed the whole ass link out lol. I tried a couple times to appeal over the years and have been denied every time. 
---
Recently gave up the account and started an ironmeme cause I couldn‚Äôt talk to my friends in game or participate in clan chats. Sucked to lose an account over a decade old but I have no hope in ever being unmuted now.

American companies are more interested in being woke these days, we'll be seeing rainbow flags and muslim characters soon

Seriously, in China p2w is huge. It makes U.S. companies look generous with f2p games.

But then how will they rig the rolls using in game mechanics?

Sure, let‚Äôs just add Skills and more without voting!
---
It‚Äôs only us, the players, who pay the $11 to keep Jagex up and running :-D
---
Yes it‚Äôs sarcasm, but feel free to tell me why it should be a good idea
---
Mine's almost 5 months. I'll definitely invest some time into slayer. I'd never seen too many people around the slayer tower but I guess I never tried to look for peak times. I haven't been in f2p worlds since I bought mem but that might also be a thing I could do. I'd always noticed less people seemed to be there so I never thought about it. I'll give both a go.
---
On first offence too, such garbage.
---
Lmao dude it‚Äôs a shit opinion. He‚Äôs not annoying, you are just a whiny bitch.

Where did I even say I was voting no to warding in my first comment lmao bro
---
God I hated that part

Konar
---
Got mine at 81. I was high as fuck and didn‚Äôt understand why runelite was flashing when I wasn‚Äôt anywhere near any levels. I noticed about an hour later.
---
I would imagine it gets polled, but I think it's a good idea. Makes the city fit into the entire lore, like it's been there the whole time rather than came late to the game. Even just adding 1 to the elite considering it's a grandmaster quest would help it fit into the lore.
---
Ya'll ready for pride year?
---
Can confirm, I just got a ban for RWT for handing a friend on discord gold I had laying around cause had not been playing much. Never traded that much gold in my life, was like 200m and then got banned.

Says I can't appeal, there is no evidence to see just. 
---
"We think you did this" 
---
and that was that.

15 year account over 200m, :/

Why do I have to see that goblin pop up on every god damn related video

Why does that matter

Damn an rs player going to folly fest? I found your post! Were you able to find a drive?

and here I am... playing rs3... I mean shit scape and MTX is crushing the game very hard
---
I would go to osrs but the graphics are the issue for me...
---
I was joking about the bots part. How often does jagex release information on the total economy size?
---
It‚Äôs crazy how much anxiety you get not because it‚Äôs hard but because you don‚Äôt want to redo the waves
---
you are literally giving them free advertising right now and this has been posted upwards of 100's of times now. please stop.

Isnt the point of ironman not having to care about this?

Dont do slayer until base 70 combats its a complete waste of time

Acid phase and fireball are really your only concerns and every 14 attacks you have to use 1 "crumble undead spell".

Jagex is a business they want what is best for their bottom line, regardless of the devs personal passion at the end of the day their job security is tied to catering to the wants of the shareholders not you. Blindly trust is not a good trait to have.
---
Those NPCs are subtle because you just look at them. 
---
You don‚Äôt have to go out of your way and get flowers and do a salute at the corporeal beast to honor woox or something like that. Gameplay *actions* should have nothing to do with famous players.
---
Noob: Can I recover my obviously cheating account?
---
Jagex: üÖ±Ô∏è
---
pretty sure you can unlock jad task now and try it with a slayer helm!!
---
Better yet, add a clue to go to Lumbridge Graveyard and type F in the chat wearing bronze platebody, iron platelegs and a chef's hat
---
Maybe they felt bad for me cause ice barrage was sold out.
---
Where do I say that or how can you draw that conclusion?
---
Yeah, I wonder if the Pro-China bots made their way into this subreddit. There's no way anyone in the right mind would think that a US company is going to be worse than a Chinese one.
---
I've fixed the [rev cave page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Revenant_Caves).
---
The spell infobox was missing a `members` param, so I've added that soon all of the spell pages should have that info.
---
:)
---
No farts
---
We can buy it TOGETHER!!
---
I use glory tele to edge and then use the ring you mentioned
---
Only fun i need to seeing how theyll botch it this time
---
Just do the ~~abuse~~ *lifehack* of repeating the first three waves until the 45 spawns south of Italy rock. Jad will now spawn in that location. You should now have zero problems killing the healers while Jad is stuck.
---
I enjoy them but really jagex needs to pay multiple people to manually look into solely appeals and evidence. Automated messages are shit and a cop out. It isn't a ban, it's an appeal.
---
They can still die, it's really rare and currently iasor feels like the best to have planted, but they can.
---
Petition to add Telos, but make him start out on 4k% enrage
---
Alright, thanks!
---
How many do you catch an hour I can do the math for you
---
Wait. Isnt seth one of the mods from the TownOfSalem sub?
---
Technically, pedophilia is pre-pubescent. So under 13 or so. The technical term for someone attracted to teenagers is ephebophilia.
---
\#themoreyouknow
---
Yeah I can upvote that for underground pass.
---
Bloat teleports 2 tiles instead of running or something like that. It‚Äôs pretty clever
---
Because your statement implied that a US company buying Germflux would make it worse.  
---
But if that's not what you were implying, my bad
---
ooh i see! thank you! :)
---
Thank you very much :)
---
Woah where do you find the jad simulator? I‚Äôve wasted way too much time just getting killed by jad
---
Thought it was clever enough from the thumbnail, actually laughed when it said "cancer"
---
Thats so nice of you! Thanks! &lt;3
---
True, I was eyeing DKs and knew fremmy elite made them a great money maker but  82 rc... yikes lol
---
Now I'm confused ???
---
Holy shit you just reminded me of that old trick... People told you to press a few keys, then your character would say "I'm a noob" lol
---
I did it back in the day with 70 range and RCB and although it took a few tries, jad wasn't the issue. I mean, I did mess up switching and died twice to that, but I am not only am I abysmal at PVM, it wasn't the RCB's fault. I'd try doing multiple attempts with an RCB instead of blowing your whole bank on a BP.
---
yeah like the cheap champ shards that give like 60 blue essence you can keep but the 900 essence champs that you dont plan on playing with just go to your next wanted champ
---
I got you fam. Voting no on that garbage skill
---
Just go get the KBD pet for the lols
---
generally the more south or closer to london you are, the higher the prices for most things. Rent, restaurants, pubs etc. They do normally pay more, infact london has a different living wage but its not exactly great. You can also use a help to buy ISA to buy a house in the UK up to 250k, but its 450k in london even though prices outside london are sometimes just as expensive.
---
his rsn is his reddit name
---
I got an imbued heart at 71 slayer from my I think 9th superior.
---
Was kind of surprised
---
Hey we have a long way to go, don't give up just yet
---
Why have you shown me this
---
My general advice to this question is to just buy membership with money as that 3-4 mill can make a huge difference for a new member. And $11 really isn't much for hours of entertainment assuming you play at least a few hours a week.
---
To actually answer your question I'd suggest searching site:reddit.com/r/2007scape followed by your question on Google. You'll find a ton of different answers which are helpful.
---
Rockstars filter is nuts. I was playing gta online(same filter) and it censored the word "semen" in basement. Pretty sure it also filters the word Rockstar
---
So c hally spec isnt good even when corps def already has been lowered  by dwhs and bgs?
---
The buyer can choose to risk it or not. Likely taking jobs in the wildy will be baits.
---
No, those are upgraded boots of stone
---
I think RuneScape site need to redirect to RuneScape site, and oldschool RuneScape redirect to oldschool RuneScape site.
---
That barrows one is really good lol
---
feelsbad
---
So the name was sold one time.
---
I call bullshit.
---
The only "people" fishing sharks are bots.
---
I'll join up for sure. 116 combat but on mobile so I need a team. How often do you go?
---
This guys stonks
---
ya my bad thehyre liek 1k runecoins which is 20 euros, so like $23
---
We pay we gay
---
This.  Even Warframe requires a ton of grind and even then there's no endgame available...and the game has been out for 6 years.  They even removed the Raids available in the game.
---
Best PK account.. GO!!
---
g
---
they did it once a year iirc, like 2 years ago it was around 20T
---
the games in the Games Room are all solved except the Reversi game, anyone betting on those is a damn fool.
---
Nearing 3k kc with no pet.
---
Most slayer bosses. Kraken, thermy etc
---
But they‚Äôre so eeeeaassssyy, they have 1 deefffeeeenccceee
---
Do you have 70 defense?  If you do wear Veracs skirt and Helm and you won't need to stack them. Just let them all attack you and focus on Jad.
---
"I've had enough bullshit with keyblades, ha-ha!"
---
I'm interested! Want to finish my current goals first, but I really want to get into that sweet pvm. I'll hit you up when I get on later today
---
Pedo
---
Whenever really. Are you US? My main guys in clan are UK so timing can be hard for a team which is why I‚Äôm looking around. I just recently got to a point I can start tanking so with Atleast 3-4 people, I can tank for quite awhile. Duo runs, I‚Äôm practically chugging brews.
---
CRINGE ALL CAPS YOUTUBE CLICK BAIT AHHHHHH
---
useful: agility construction magic
---
useless: slayer after some items, firemaking, cooking
---
Join my clan chat and hit me up if you ever see me online! Would love to have you join up and PVM with me for sure!
---
Our boy Graardor's thiccer than that
---
yeah I member doom
---
Haven‚Äôt watched this one yet, but so far I thought Ditterbitter has got the best PK‚Äôs.  PK‚Äôd 3 VLS‚Äôs lol. The first one was the juiciest.
---
Off the top of my head should be something like 7/100,000. I think this ((49X48)/(1x2))((1/4000)^2)((3999/4000)^47) is how you would calculate getting exactly two drops of probability 1/4000 over 49 tries
---
It's not even getting polled because they removed it from the dev blog altogether
---
Giant Seaweed has a much higher chance, trees for pet takes years
---
&gt;isn‚Äôt going to crash the market
---
As I said, my opinion has nothing to do with the specifics of the gear or it‚Äôs costs. 
---
You want Swampletics to have special treatment when you know Jagex would have never done this with another player. 
---
And they like won‚Äôt do this, thankfully.
---
Not even "almost".
---
When Tree of Savior was released, a not-so popular mmorpg from a couple years ago, I hopped on the first day it released (before it went F2P).  Gold selling spammers within the first week.
---
umm just buy it on the ge sweetie

/u/nwordcountbot

It's like a smelly smell. A smelly that smells. anchovies. . . ANCHOVIES
---
Doubling karma
---
It's the same def(outside of mage def which isn't useful in fight caves) as other barrow tank helm/legs.
---
...but did he give you the gp?
---
Upvoted because you need 4K more upvotes
---
Cost efficient never matters. In the long run u should always use sang + dragon darts + dragon arrows.
---
Those all seem really powerful compared to the tome of fire. Especially the water one
---
Support
---
Now, definitely much shorter. As wow added expansions, the max lvl kept increasing, and as a result, the time needed to level was eventually "squished". Also, there was a shift in focus to end game so lvling became even faster.
---
During vanilla in 2004, getting 1-60 took a loooooooong time since the leveling was the main focus. If you played casually, it would take roughly half a year maybe even more
---
Nowadays, if you focus, you can reach 1-120 in less than a month, much less time even though there are double the levels
---
Most hackers won't go out of their way to get rid of things like that. There are some cases where untradables get dropped, but that's because it's so easy to do (they're already at the bank) and they want you to quit so they can keep your account. The chance of getting hacked is super low, and the chance of that hacker getting rid of untradables is even lower. You shouldn't avoid doing things on your account just because it could get hacked, unless your account security is absolutely terrible
---
osrs taught me to ignore people telling me what I like isn't what I should like
---
this is so sad. the high scores literally means nothing anymore
---
Normal account? RC
---
Ironman? probably herbolre
---
Ultimate ironman? Herbolre 100%
---
Cool, thanks guys!
---
Ya change the water one to like a 25% chance to ignore magic defense and magic prayer.
---
Wind tome would be pretty similar to fire tome. Instead of more damage its faster attack speed. Probably less dps tbh.
---
Earth tome would be annoying in pvp.
---
Not even perm, had three two-week bans on my pure and its still not banned lol.
---
b
---
yeah, they can finally enjoy the game
---
Jesus this is lame
---
stonks
---
What's your opinion on the quality? Do you think your mouse will wear the image out?
---
Dragon sword is a really good budget option for vasa, although at this point getting a lance before doing any chambers is basically meta for non ironmen
---
Where is 50k/year minimum wage lol
---
This is your brain on Freedom‚Ñ¢
---
I thought I was straight, then I went to a gay club drunk and made out with a dude.
---
Woah propaganda melted your brain.
---
Sadly this isn‚Äôt a detriment to some people.
---
Not at all. Did the math for Wind Tome, it's less DPS at any given level.
---
The Water Tome isn't as OP as you think. Water Surge has a base max hit of 22. It requires a player to be on the Standard Spellbook. It has knockout potential and can surprise an opponent that is unprepared. It requires a certain level of commitment that underscores its power.
---
The Tome of Earth is identical to Jade Bolts (e).
---
25% chance to stun is insanely broken
---
Why do they have so many banks so close to each other?
---
The community think "authenticator delay" is a thing that is used.
---
It requires you to use Water Spells... which are particularly underwhelming.
---
Wind Tome is faster attack speed, less DPS. Would add some surprise, for sure.
---
Earth Tome is identical to Jade Bolts (e).
---
The quality is awesome IMO I dont think my mouse would affect the image anytime soon, the print quality looks top notch, also the mat is very solid with a great thickness
---
Well done brother. It‚Äôs an awesome quest. Now get ready for the next big one üëçüèº
---
\&gt; I have item: Pot of Weeds
---
yeah i only got 1 task of them so far and nothing from the lil guys
---
If you take things at face value I guess
---
There‚Äôs no way to determine that those reviews were actual former employees, or just trolls who were pissed off about shitty servers or getting banned.
---
I'm in Canada. Maybe I'll hang out in the cc and if the stars align I'll go
---
Nailed it.
---
I mean you could call anything useful for noobs cause they simply don't know about better options. A berserker helm is super easy to obtain if you have some game knowledge but a noob might just not know about it
---
Then you should probably be picking up your own loot anyways
---
Working on 77 rc at ZMI. 10 hrs left. Almost lvl 75!
---
Hate to break it to you but they aren't brigading anything, people on this sub just are like that
---
Pride festivals are pretty gay
---
Exchange my move to the grand kitchen.
---
I'm definitely a 2007scape purist but I still believe that some items should be buffed or given an alternate use like karambwan poisoned spears and Splitbark armor. They're cool but don't really fulfill any purpose now
---
Shit man, i totally thought i responded to a comment about the dragon left half. I didnt know about the spears
---
üÖ±Ô∏èoolin
---
For sure! Join up in my clan chat if you‚Äôre ever looking to tank because I‚Äôm the only tank in the clan at the moment!
---
Haha jokes on you! My 99 attack 99 prayer pure is lvl 101!
---
Step 1. Give account to friend
---
Step 2. Have friend bot the account to max combat
---
Step 3. Get banned and then recover the account because "I didn't cheat"
---
Step 4. Jagex: B
---
We got him boys.
---
*cries in ironman*
---
lol, SkillersL is Lynx Titan's RC alt. How did you determine whether these accounts were botting?
---
F
---
No, they don't.
---
it's a letter
---
He has no way of getting a gold leaf to build the stash unit, however I still agree
---
Can i use slayer helm instead of bandana?
---
Oh obviously its still creepy as fuck. I never said it wasn't creepy. I was just adding information i found interesting.
---
Nah, you missed the point actually. They're saying that the combat level system is flawed from the pov of someone who wouldn't focus on maintaining low overall level for pvp, either because they aren't aware or don't care to. Logically, higher combat level should = stronger in combat
---
How does this work?
---
