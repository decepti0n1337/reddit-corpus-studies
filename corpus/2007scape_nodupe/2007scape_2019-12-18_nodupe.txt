Each roll is independent,
---

---
Let assume H is heads, T is tails. 50/50.
---
First flip lands H, Second flip has no more or less chance at landing H again.
---
However, HH is a 25% chance. Thats because due to 2 rolls having 2 outcomes each, thats 4 outcomes.
---
---
---
Troll account. Don't mind him. Gz on the QPC :)
---
Awesome! Going to bookmark the spreadsheet too. Thanks a ton man
---
Young Danny Fenton was on world 14,
---
when he got a quest he had not seen,
---
it was designed to need a slayer ring. 
---
 (He's gonna catch em all cause he's Danny Phasmatys)
---
 When they couldn't speak ghost, his clan, they just quit,
---
then Danny found a ghostspeak amulet. 
---
Fire works flashed; his prayer level changed,
---
 so now he's skilled at praying range. 
---
(Phasmatys, Phasmatys) 
---
When he leveled up he realized, it was 3am,
---
note his baggy eyes.
---
He had hit a wall. He's about to cry.
---
 He would never get drops like the other guys.
---
 It was then Danny knew what he had to do. 
---
He could to tell Jagex that he was through,
---
 but not so! He had to renew. 
---
He's gonna play all night cause he's Danny Phasmatys.
---
Gonna play all night cause he's Danny Phasmatys 
---
 Gonna play all night cause he's...Danny Phasmatys
---
First of all, congratulations.
---
Second of all, don't wait for something as lengthy as a 99 to post those gems. Just keep them coming.
---
Gz
---
^shoulda ^taken ^it ^all ^the ^way ^to ^varrock ^castle ^steps
---
The tax is a massive goldsink and can be seen in every facet of the game. No, removing the duel arena because some Redditors get triggered when a Twitch streamer "scams" his viewers is not something that's more important. Dude, just don't watch Twitch.
---
What's so funny?
---
Good idea! I'm gonna do a video when I hit my 1st 99 :√∏
---
Wasted tons and tons of resources designing it. Lots of money going down the drain if it was just scrapped like it should've been
---
Can I ask did you use the orb of oculus or 3rd party plugin for these camera views?
---
Moss giant boss is good, but don‚Äôt recommend using your keys until your back in p2p
---
Go get a job.
---
RSC, right off tut island circa 2002. Guy told me in lumby he'd Smith me a r2h if I gave him my gut island loot.
---
Rs2, rl friend knew my recovery question answers and took my red, blue and green phats. Left my Santa's though... that's how I knew it was him. 
---
Osrs lent out pegs to a 'friend' I met when we were super early game. 
---
Couldn't care less about the items, but losing friends does hurt.
---
If you‚Äôre gonna high alch at all on a main it‚Äôs still worth it, though, so long as the price hasn‚Äôt ranked by the time you‚Äôre done alching and ready to sell it.
---
Ironic how you call me pretentious while needing to insult my intelligence to make yourself feel good. Stop having a tantrum kid.
---
Watched this without sound the first time and was pleasantly surprised that you picked the song my head chose as well üòÇ
---
so not relevant to staking at all then
---
That was my plan. I forgot all of my combat gear is p2p so I can‚Äôt use it for now. Ope
---
I still like Kemps low level ironman and playing RS properly, I think this sub just hates content creators.
---
one time I took fish but immediately put it back BC I was scared they would get mad at me
---
Well there is your answer. 
---
You used third party clients with dodgy  plugins.
---
I like the idea of adding your twisted league rank to the highscores. That way people could actually see how you placed permanently.
---
I'm impartial to cosmetic trophies you can weild, being able to see you were in the dragon cup doesn't really mean as much as being able to see how well you placed.
---
I've seen this before lol
---
Because why would you spend irl money on runescape when you can play for free lmao
---
they missed one or two, someone got permabanned (or status removed? idk) for transferring items via duel arena
---
Is there a way to get past holiday event items (ie mop)?
---
lol so glad that retard lost the 14b stake after saying that. Staker only players are the plague of RS.
---
I will not play a future league if the trophies aren‚Äôt unique/discontinued. 
---
Also I probably wouldn‚Äôt have played Twisted League had I known points are transferable across leagues; I have no faith that tasks/relics/pts from one league to the next will be balanced.
---
I never changed anything from the original download which is stated by jagex that OSbuddy and Runelite are ok. Not only that but their own JMods use RuneLite so why did I get banned out of nowhere?
---
25buttholes has been doing his part to inspire others as well
---
More untradeables the better. Keeps it from just being a credit card fest.
---
Another idiot using a 50-50 flip to try and prove a point.
---
Least you can get champ scrolls passively from slayer and other activities. I've gotten two giant scrolls from fire giant tasks and a skele one while doing barrows. Moss giants you have to go out of your way to do.
---
11 champion scroll, got damn. Those are 1/5k aren‚Äôt they? You got like twice as many as you‚Äôd expect to killing that many moss giants lol. (Unless Im mistaken one the drop rate)
---
This is incredibly wrong. Card counters  count doesnt tell them what card is to come but to help calculate the expected value of their bet.
---
Hey man! Congrats! Got my first ever 99 last night and my irl mate who plays wasn‚Äôt online and I just couldn‚Äôt wait so I had a nice lonely celebration to myself üòÅ
---
Here‚Äôs to plenty more!
---
He's getting 5b while I'm struggling to make 5m for a bond.
---
This has to be the most hideous screen shot I've ever seen on this sub.
---
Have you tried GPU rendering on runelite or something similar? 
---
Also maybe update java.
---
Prod short for production or produced. Meaning it is a product of just nmz. People used to say soulwars prod etc back in the day. 
---
I basicly mean start a fresh account. Do the 5 quests needed for best nmz xp. Then you afk the accoubt for a few weeks untill 99 melees and hp. Can also afk range there but i just wait to chin that at mm2 tunnels.
---
Pro people scam people in this game and con them for like weeks. People get tbow drops and steal them and ditch their whole clan just for the money. Osrs is probably one of the most toxic mmos you can play because everyone is out to fuck you.
---
Barb is better, but lobsters is best is f2p and okay money for your stats if you can‚Äôt grind a bond with gp right now
---
Thanks
---
This is the last thing you see before having your defence reduced by 51%
---
Except it is. Torture, bandos chest + tassets, Faceguard, prims. That‚Äôs over 100m forsure.
---
There's a line, man. Damn
---
no people think that no people think that people think this is funny
---
Yo! You can also put giant fish in the tank! like the big shark, swordfish, and Bass I think it was
---
1. Dude what are you even saying. You asked me a question:
---
&gt; Ok, does that mean there's more than 1 action per key?
---
If you didnt want an answer whyd you ask the question?
---
2.  All i did was answer your first question. Im not jagex. I dont know if they can detect. I just gave you their response.
---
you should train with this butterfly net, higher dps
---
interest should be circa 30% for this risk
---
Looks like a main for sure. Hope to see the banhammer
---
We're not all sweaty incel nerds here. I've barely made more progress than this on a non Ironman acc in the last 5 years.
---
OSRS isn't the UN dude
---
In w330 you dont have to worry about lighting the burners yourself. So faster
---
Nice! Now get a trimmed music cape =)
---
It always amazes me how dumbfounded people are when they get banned for botting when they bot.
---
Make an iron man bro it‚Äôs the only way it‚Äôs what I did after that cycle now I‚Äôm in my iron man grinding for items that I can‚Äôt sell and stake immediately it‚Äôs literally the only way I was able to kick the habit
---
just make unique trophys every league, then add them to league shop via high cost point reward.
---
I use ge tracker to also take into account trade volume for that item
---
would be more beneficial to completely remove the dual arena.
---
I just asked if Windows Mouse Key was mapping more than 1 action to a particular key. That's all I wanted to know? 
---
I do see the difference I think in what you're trying to say though. Windows Mouse Keys are fine to use as a re-mapping tool, but AHK is not, even if the re-map is still 1 action per key. 
---
So it's not right to say anything goes as long as it's 1 action per key, but more concisely *only* windows mouse keys are fine to use for re-mapping keys... At least I think that's the distinction trying to be made here?
---
I got my firecape, died and lost it. I‚Äôm never getting it back, fuck Jad,
---
&gt; If someone is bad at jad and he spawns poorly for their skill level
---
But it doesn't matter where he spawns... It's not difficult to take a stroll to his spawn position from wave 62 while praying mage on the magers.
---
&gt;If people learn how to learn spawns by wave 3, then they can get a much better jad spawn and then you can essentially take out an entire panel where u talk about not seeing jad. If people learn jad spawns, they are safe.
---
And replace it with a panel that says "the mob that spawns on wave 3 is jad"
---
It's not really information you need. "Be in center, pay attention to orange lizard, kill other lizard, kill orange lizard last and Jad pops up next to you" is more intuitive than going "ignore the yellow mager, just keep a note of where the mob on wave 3 spawned- if you remembered to take note that is"
---
Not sure Slayer helm is a good idea unless you‚Äôre on task
---
Now i just want it to show a compass when minimized !
---
I got crashed so often from 70 Slayer onward that I eventually became that person and I will never apologise. It was an integral part of my game experience, and I like to think I pass that forward
---
That's the joke
---
Hi friends. Are you tired of that shit? Join the grind at r/ironscape
---
This is a paid advertisement, but since we can‚Äôt trade, it‚Äôs paid for with feels.
---
Vorkath is not "good" ranged xp it's less than 10% of the efficient ranged xp rate. Cerb I agree is good but OP is nowhere near doing either of those bosses
---
chaos alter &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Nah, mage only is better because 2 of the three phases are weaker to magic and more importantly you can hide from zulrahs mage phase and not take any damage.
---
222qp
---
That is a big brain idea
---
I overcame my crippling anxiety and was rewarded with two "&lt;3 tyvms" and barrows gloves for my effort. Now if only I could do the same irl...
---
Keep it that way
---
Without oculus orb, your best bet is to have an alt and use the entity hider in RL to hide your alt. Then you've got a camera to follow your main account on. For smooth camera movement use middle click.
---
Good work! I just got my first 99 last night, fletching. Yours is a much better achievement though.
---
Weird guess but maybe they aren‚Äôt turned up to the max
---
barb village will be better xp, don't bother with lobsters unless you're *really* short on money (like, 200k bank value)
---
you stated that this community went downhill after he was elected, it was like this before that so how do you explain the the lack of change in his election?
---
The events used to be aggressive. They‚Äôd attack if you didn‚Äôt answer. Teleport you for picking the wrong answer. It really only frustrates actual players rather than effectively stopping bots. 
---
Even in the good old days they had the stamina system and you needed to sleep and type in a catcha code the bots still navigated around it.
---
stonks   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Well now you have to make a video for each 99. Absolutely amazing video btw.
---
H
---
I should be angry and jealous but honestly, I think I just nutted
---
Np. Goodluck.
---
He gonn kill himself
---
Yeah clarification u/1dabaholic \- don't think they meant barbarian style fishing, but the fly fishing location in barbarian village
---
Darn! I see a bunch of these awesome wallpapers, but never in my resolution lol.
---
no u
---
pots, seeds, herbs you can get back with farming contracts easily (my tab on twisted league is already at 30m in seeds from contracts and its only been 3 week). con sucks but that is mostly wc which is pretty afk and the herb you will get back with farming.  hardest thing is barrows, and thats not that hard.

Awww.
---
When I began playing RS, I refused to train on men and women like most newbies would do. They were *people*, dammit!
---
Just add another grind to my checklist of grinds that still need to be done.
---
LMAO at Woox bringing in the screenshot from #*FIVE YEARS AGO*
---
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
---
    		if (!hasCompletedFarming()) {
---
    			runFarm();
---
    		}
---
    	}
---
    
---
    	private static void runFarm() {
---
    		// Edited out code to not leak my methods
---
    	private final static boolean hasCompletedFarming() {
---
    		return false;
---
That‚Äôs the best kind of high! XD
---
Dude your like the 50th person to post the email.
---
[removed]
---
Honestly. If I started from scratch again I would do it in this order:
---
- 80 FM with WT (starter items, gp)
---
- 70 Agility (76 for Zulrah, but rushing 70 gives you tons of shortcuts)
---
- all ATT/STR/DEF quests via training mage (should get around 40-50s melee and close with mage too)
---
- all Prayer quests
---
- 70 thieving (gp, relatively quick imo)
---
That's basically the route I would go. It would take roughly a week or less to do.
---
Then move into securing some good quests and items:
---
- Barrows Gloves
---
- Ibans Staff
---
- Fighter Torso
---
Etc.
---
I have only been playing like a total of 5 months, feels longer. Made it to around 1500 on my HC for the first time ever really playing - kinda want to start over knowing more efficient methods for stuff but keep telling myself no...
---
I honestly can't be bothered with beginner clues. Every other one I do if that makes you feel better
---
please quote where i said that, my memory isn't what it used to be dear.
---
I second this. Don't take this lightly, it's a mentality that is not only confined to this game. 
---
The more you know about yourself the more control you have over your life.
---
Just finished 380kc with no crystals sweet
---
Haha google: how to install runelite on linux
---
There are step by step instruction on wikihow. Download Runelite for linux and follow the steps described on wikihow in the terminal to install the application.
---
I haven't tried to install the official client on my linux machine, but surely its supported...
---
Fuck you.. Eat my dick.. Congratz.. Bye bitch
---
It's always Sunny in osrs.
---
At least few months ago if you join from OSRS mobile you can receive week p2p, just play a little bit as f2p get some level ups, and use that free p2p if that feature are still available.
---
Not new I played from around 03 to EOC and didn't play much after and didn't start Old school until mobile. I would still like to add you and have more to play with my next goal is firecape.
---
I refuse to believe there's no '10 backup somewhere, bah gawd I'd actually pay for membership if that came out

Unless you lose the staff by accident
---
White people as a whole don't do war in africa, it's a select few. 
---
Xi individually is a shitty person.
---
it says you'll be able to buy these rewards again with points made in later leagues. Although more than likely you'll see something else you want in the next league.
---
I've also heard that the rewards will be tradeable
---
i can really feel the passion and deep suffering that you packed into this image
---
Tbh I enjoyed the poh aquarium in rs3, this would be a cool semi-completionist content addition
---
Ngl I don‚Äôt remember how long ago it was and evidence of it has probably been deleted but if I remember correctly  there was multiple times that he was cleaned when staking then asked viewers to ‚Äúdonate‚Äù gold/items to keep the stream/videos going so of corse people donated gold to keep him staking it‚Äôs part of the reason why I 1: stoped watching him and 2: don‚Äôt have a lot of respect for him
---
Invest in elder mauls
---
Mannn. I've drained 1000 tokens and only got bronze so far. Lucky bastard
---
I have no doubt they've got the accounts with the lowest total hour fire capes
---
Wiki has great info 
---
If you want to be super lazy you can blowpipe only and kills are about 2:30 on a average.
---
Or if you did bot you may be asking for a JMod to put your account status back hoping they just "push it through" and you can win one over.
---
Seen this story to many times. Good luck, hope it works out.
---
Yeah I've been looking forward to your responses. It's been good discourse, and it helped me iron out a hunch I've been working on.
---
TIL

Spoiler : baby yoda dies

Using recoils to avoid combat exp. isn't anyone's strat. People have been doing it since 2005
---
Runelite daddy
---
108 kills to get from bronze to dragon on my alt. Greatest  rng I have ever had
---
If you push it you can do Fletching by bows, as you can make money off of that. Or get Yak Hide armour and do Wintertodt for a Firemaking 99. For a more click intensive one you can also do Thieving, as you can get some Dodgy Necklaces and Gloves to thieve Ardy Knights, though to make it so much easier you'd need the Ardy Medium diary and the Rogues Outfit, which if you 99 on Ardy Knights with Rogues you can get 13m. Otherwise it's like 700k per million xp to make Wines for a Cooking 99.
---
Back in classic we had to do it 1 by 1, the best spot imo was draynor for a few reasons: fishers coming back from musa point would trade their 25 raws for 5 certs (a certificate = 5 fish in a noted form) of whichever fish you were cooking, the fishing cert npc (I think it was niles or giles) was right nearby, and draynor had a few normal trees nearby.  Good times getting carpal tunnel.
---
It isn‚Äôt that simple when your only interaction with people for years is over the internet
---
He's literally the creator posting his content. Lol.
---
Should be with Diango in Draynor
---
Weath has clarified that using AHK or any other program to remap 1 key to another key or button is within the game rules.
---
wanna give me 20m off an ironman then?
---
This is in rs3

---
You didn't happen to do this at the GE about 1 or 2 weeks ago did you? Some glorious bastard was dropping this same loot, but a bgs instead, and I snagged the big one.
---
Thanks for your post after seeing it I looked it up and noticed I was too eligible for the double xp I entered my email password and bank pin and I'm currently waiting on a reply thank you
---
The idea is moreso that we need an item sink rather than a GP sink. We already have GP sinks. PKing in general is a gold sink. Moving your respawn point. Construction. Magic (combat not alching). Dual Arena tax. 
---
We have GP sinks. We need item sinks. This GE tax I've suggested doesn't remove any gold from the game. It removes items.
---
Thinking about starting TL, have you been having fun?
---
It would still be tied to participation/percentage rank in this league though. And it costs 0 points so spending 0 points from a future league wouldn't really do anything, ya know?
---
Not singling you out personally, btw! Just upsetting to see anyone (including Jagex) threatening to change established/polled rules 1 month+ into a competition based on those rules...
---
Haha, I bought 4k rings
---
They are 42 oz now!
---
Yeah, I quit playing leagues when I found out that none of my progress would be archived. Jagex needs to do something otherwise leagues will die out.
---
Doing it now,  thanks man,  this is fast.
---
I did the same. I came back to the cows, where i first started lvling up my combat.
---
Dope man good luck on your grind
---
Well that was 2v1 so it doesn't count
---
Fortnyte
---
Your the devil
---
Take my upvote
---
i agree. who cares anyway lol. skills are literally boring as FUCK and take way too long. no one in their right mind is grinding that out even with the promise of more "fun" things to do when they are finished. either make skilling more fun to do or double the xp. no one cares how many times you did literally the same exact action over and over anyway until max level.
---
does it? what exactly?
---
Lol
---
Best cape in the game, good job
---
i play for pvm though and so do MANY other people. who really derives fun from skilling?
---
Heroes‚Äô Quest isn‚Äôt though.

Start inf farming, your close to starting ranarrs, herb runs are also a gold money source.
---
Here's a fun concept: make the league trophies unique, unobtainable afterwards, and multi-equipable.
---
Twisted League Rune
---
Summer 2020 League Dragon
---
Winter 2020 League Adamant
---
Player would just struggle to carry all of them like the oversized Christmas present. Lol
---
I think the noise wand has a higher dps value
---
Add items. Add cash to make it 50m exact
---
You can play osrs and have a job at the same time. Hell you can do both at the same time now with mobile out.
---
Love the idea of a main trophy display case and shelves that would hold the others.
---
&gt; just to get my base buy able skills to 50m exp
---
I rest my case. Bubble of sweat.
---
Word sounds good, I just always forget to check the damn patch can I pay a dwarf to watch herb patches as well?
---
RS3 is as p2w as RAID tho

Recently got my firecape on mobile wasnt to bad at 110 combat lol.

I actually enjoyed the vid, gave context and background and made the pics feel more interesting as a result
---
If you've ever collected guthix's sweet sweet tears for rc xp you wouldn't say he was evil.
---
I‚Äôm imaging the banks of the digsite packed with players testing their chances of a rare drop and striking it rich
---
Although in thinking this through I‚Äôve realized something like this would probably become heavily botted. So there goes the whole idea.
---
It's just bantz. I like them both.
---
No, and no one checks the patches. Herbs take 80 minutes to grow, use ultra compost and what dies, dies. With ultracompost the death chances are miniscule so dont worry about it.
---
I think farming contracts, giant seaweed farming and doing frequent birdhouse runs will REALLY be beneficial for you, the earlier the better, the herblore gains will be real, as well as the seaweed for crafting gains.
---
I've done this too many times lmao
---
How is that even possible?
---
Is it possible to get a triple hit with a cannon? I was slaying Suqahs and had one I was trying to maneuver into a double hit spot. I moved him into it and then moved him past it and saw three damage splats. I feel like it was probably a third hit from my whip but at the same I don‚Äôt think I was done running yet and capable of attacking.

From that link, not the normal appeal process.

A million times this.

This isn't "good service"

This is the absolute bare minimum to qualify as "service" at all lmao

To be fair to you, I suppose we can all agree that it's "above average service" haha
---
i think slayer is a good place to start. grinding skills immediately after a break is kinda off-putting imo~
---
Y‚Äôall can add me if you want, #no99bois
---
Serious suggestion though: revamp all teleporting interfaces on mobile to something similar to the tree teleports on fossil island.
---
Clear to read and hard to fat finger.
---
With a box of rings!

Imo a female dress version would have been nice to have as well...
---
Not to mention you can‚Äôt use special characters either
---
Did you lose the first one? Like not insured and lost it? If not you don't get a 2nd pet fucking goofball
---
Rip
---
Real question are they ever going to crack down on bots or is that what they‚Äôre doing now?
---
Blame all the people who cry "my gp/hr" with every new update since zulrah spoiled this community. 
---
Jagex: New monster to be around X gp/hr here the uniques we wanna poll and youre free to offer more
---
Community: Unique is good but too strong devalues current BiS reduce stats or no vote. offers little to no alternative drops
---
Option 1. Community: Reeee dead content not BiS items dead on release
---
Option 2. God Jagex fix the economy add gold sinks... Even though we just voted no to all the uniques to a new monster that passed at a polled gp/hr rate. Not our fault the drop table is all alchables and tertiary items
---
Bruh the beginning of osrs had no ge... that shit was %100 whack. Zybez was a nightmare to use. Ge is a must.
---
How are you happy with something that hasnt even been released yet
---
I've heard that heaps, never witnessed it till all this started.
---
At first it was a laugh, now it's 4 weeks later and this shit is still going. And thats not okay
---
This.
---
Can I get a link to all the times you had a guy say he was falsely banned then you smacked him down with proof  please, I need a good laugh
---
No of course not lol. Its ensured, and I have not died since acquiring it. I had it out already when this screenshot was taken.
---
I‚Äôve seen it happen when a monster went from one cannon side to another.
---
You don‚Äôt get a physical 2. 
---
That‚Äôs why it says you would have been followed.
---
if you move them around it's technically possible to get 8 hits i think
---
Deflection prayers even
---
Constant posting at someone else's expense, making fun of them nonstop? 
---
Soft or not, that's bullying cunt.
---
You tuners are the worst lol
---
Huh, even if the colors are a bit difficult to distinguish I figured you'd likely be able to see the shadows of the falling crystals since it's just black contrasting with against a color rather than trying to tell two colors apart. 
---
At this point I don't even really look at the floor though to dodge those though, I can tell if one is falling on my tile by how the projectile itself looks as it's falling. You could just try to take a wide berth if one looks like it's falling near you.
---
they got rid of that feature since a lot of bots were coming in to the game since all you had to do was delete it and make a new play store account and get another week of membership
---
I can only get so erect
---
The HD graphics, the bosses, the armors, wew

Oh interesting. Why wouldn't they give you another physical pet?

Nah, that's just the way Anti-Santa speaks. He really enunciates the "of".

Dude i dont like his content. But the trolling and bullying is dumb as fuck. Either I am talking to 15 year olds or really weird 20 year olds.

Wanna be friends OP? I'm returning to the game as well, if so pm me your IGN.
---
I mean there's small ish changes I've noticed, like the statue in Falador disappearing after (I think) Garden of Tranquility. You're right though would be awesome to see West Ardy after someone puts the bins out and has a good sweep and mop.
---
wtf stop
---
I don‚Äôt get the difference. It‚Äôs so confusing to me that two sites with almost identical names and function pop up when I google stuff. Why not just have one?
---
This is the exact value of my non ironman back ffs, 33.6 mil according to runelite.
---
Is it toxic? I‚Äôm still a fairly new member (less than a year) but when I first became a member and was overwhelmed by the amount of content, in game players were always super helpful. I mean shit, I got 5mil for free from a guy because I was asking ‚Äúnoob‚Äù questions and he literally just says ‚Äúnew mem? Wait here.‚Äù 
---
Ran to the bank and came back with 5mil and said ‚ÄúI think you need this more than I do‚Äù then just ran away before I could even thank him.
---
Eh, I'd disagree with that personally. The entire point of the Infernal cape is that you're supposed to earn it yourself. Whether you like it or not, it's by far the most difficult PvM challenge in the game, and many would argue *the only* half-difficult thing in the game. I don't think anyone that bought capes think they're "good at the game" (why the fuck would they?), but rather the fact that cape selling exists makes everyone think that everyone bought their cape instead of earning it legitimately, and devalues any achievement it may have had. Trust me, if you ever get one, you'll be asked all the time if you bought it.
---
I might also add that gold sellers and cape sellers are usually on the same websites, but that's just me.
---
It gives a strength bonus, but has worse defensive stats. Depends on what you prefer
---
Fandom was the old wiki site that we migrated away from towards the current site. We do not have the ability to take it down because we do not own it, Fandom does. They don't close it down because it still makes them money from the ads. It's just not updated at all.

"you play the game more efficiently then me so your sweaty".  what a nice way to go through life, i guess when someone makes more money then you irl they are nothing but sweats as well.....

You don‚Äôt need the pet insured as long as you avoid combat entirely when you have it out.
---
sorry man I should have worked it out
---
Not weird at all, it's a easy boss that you can easily use more than one account at(so you don't split anything). You barely use supplies, trips can last nearly forever, and over time average it's a pretty high amount of gold per hour.
---
4k/hr actually. You'd be surprised how fast they are.

For some reason I can't login to a membership world. On my account page it says there's a payment pending, but on the Jagex billing site it says my subscription is active. I don't see any options to even attempt to upgrade? If I go to the osrs membership page it says there aren't any packages available to my account

Idk why it hasn't charged like it usually does anyway, I haven't changed anything recently.

Doing this will get your account locked tho lol gotta be careful with that.

I think '07 is the best in terms of balance but for me '10 was the most fun even if (maybe because?) a lot of the content there was pretty much at the end of the slippery slope of overwhelming powercreep.

I didn't mean a dress or any special variant which differs very much. I'd like to see a pic how the existent variant looks on female model. 
---
For example I like male's graceful, but the female one, especially pants, I dislike. On the other hand, some other costumes looks great on females - like vyrewatch (even the heeled boots not included - just top and legs look terrific). That is what I meant: I have to decide, to buy it or to spend points on other things. If they look much worse than male variant (which is quite possible) - then I won't buy. If I like them - well, there is still time to intensify the efforts to get all of them :).

it's about a 10% dps increase (I used dps calc) and only costs like 30k gp/h for the arrows with accumulator. you'll also boost your exp if you unlock ammonite crabs instead of using rock crabs/sand crabs

you should also be getting in the range of 65k xp/h with mith darts at crabs, are you using range pots?

lol, what does "that's not how it works" even mean?  What is "it"?  Obviously this is not something that has been implemented, or even something that would be reasonable to implement.  I am laying out a hypothetical scenario in which I think it might be reasonable to contemplate eliminating the GE, which, if anything, serves to illustrate why eliminating the GE is not practical.

That's what amazes me like holy shit. The lengths some people go through to hack/scam on RuneScape is impressive. Like I assume these people are doing it to rwt the gold they get.
---
I understand the big bot farms because quite honestly the money you can make from gold selling on RuneScape can be insane if you have a big bot farm. I'd love to know what a high end bot farmer makes in a year from selling gold.
---
Like is it decent money, 35-50k usd per year?  Or is it downright insane like 150k+ a year?
---
This is next level though, taking out ad space to hack people. Honestly though this seems kinda dumb, the people likely to fall for this scam probably don't have much gold. I'm so curious how much they'd actually end up making from this.
---
It really do be that way. But only on highly populated worlds.

It's about the same effort as rune dragons and less effort than Zulrah. Bandos is a very easy boss, it doesn't take any effort at all with a geared tank and attacker.

&gt; They should have left their stats alone but made it so the stone attack hits for like 80 damage through prayer if you don't dodge it or something.

the current stone attack is fine imo, it's just there to make the mobs feel "unique" and not be an actual threat nor does it need to be.

I've been saying the same thing about Vannaka for years. This is a realistic medieval warfare game, NOT Chip-n-Dales. 
---
Is it too much to ask that I demand everyone conforms to my standards of modesty?
---
I'm sorry but fuck satisfying both sides. There is no compromise here. A trophy is an achievement. If you didn't put in the work or you did but weren't good enough then too bad. This is what happens when you give every kid a participation trophy. They becone entitled without wanting to put in any of the work themselves.

Why won't jamflex poll Dereks feedback?
---
&gt; The jaw drop rate is fine as is. It‚Äôs more rare than most slayer drops but it also creates the BIS helm (whip is not BIS) so if it‚Äôs gonna be dropped from a fairly easy monster, it shouldn‚Äôt be as common as a whip imo.
---
At one point in time the Whip was BiS one-handed was it not? Blask Mask is BiS for slayer. Also, look at other unique examples. Cerberus uniques are 1/512. GWD items are 1/384.
---
Just because something is BiS does not mean it HAS to worth 50mil+. Look at the price of blowpipe or godswords.
---
&gt; I do think their drop table should be looked at. It would make more sense for them to remove all the addy items from basilisk knights and replace them with rune and add another unique drop or two. Much rather they leave the jaw drop rate alone.
---
I don't think adding high level alchables to Knights is a good idea, if they have profitable general drops, people would start farming them and the Jaw would crash anyway. I prefer if the knights are just something you kill for a jaw drop and never go back again.
---
Maybe 1/512 on task and 1/2560 off-task like how Drakes are.
---
Blessed feedback
---

^ this. I could never get the appeal of video guides. I tried using slayermusiq1's guides, but the issue I found was it was either too fast or too slow. What's nice about reading from the wiki is that it's always at your pace.

Oh shit balls. I thought I finally made it into dragon, welp more grinding I guess lol. Thanks for the fast reply to and the awesome stats.
---
Where else do you think zulrah get all her/his snapsdragons, dwarf weeds, toadflaxes and torstols?
---
you could have walked in one of those house portals being spammed in the chat, told everyone at the altar that you just got the pet and they would have reacted and said a message to include in the screenshot. it's easy to interact with people, it doesn't have to develop into a friendship.
---
Only problem is people would reee that their brimstone/ dark totem rate would be reduced, and you can never take a scapers toys away
---
Also worth mentioning that you can‚Äôt use a dragon defender with dharoks, but I‚Äôve heard that dharoks is better as low as 85 hp, so people seem inconsistent with what hp lvl is really necessary
---
Fuck turael, worst supervisor in the company. 
---
I come into work every day, giving tasks, cancelling them, looking up accounts, issuing loyalty rewards, and reminding customers how many credits are left on their account. 
---
Turael? This guy ONLY has to do account cancellations. I was hired before him, and here I am doing his job and more, and suddenly when I give a customer a task they don't like and they're out of loyalty points it's all "I don't pay $11 a month to kill steel dragons, can I speak to your supervisor?". He always reminds us never transfer to the supervisor unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY so it's back and forth until I cave. Fine, I transfer them over. Turael picks up and says "uhhhh I can give you 9 goblins instead?" and then he's back to fucking off for an hour doing nothing until the next idiot comes around with no loyalty points left. Was that so hard turael? I deal with this shit ALL DAY and he makes a fuss over the couple of unhappy customers he has to talk to every day.
---
Agreed. People either don't want to admit they fucked up or are just incredibly ignorant when it comes to securing your account. If you have a strong password, authenticator on your account and email and a bank pin there's literally no way in hell your bank is getting touched unless you fuck up one way or another.
---
I kind of doubt that's what he meant...?  It seems like usually when someone says "X dry" they're saying "I killed X of this mob and didn't get the drop in question".
---
Why would I work a job in-game for at most $1.5 an hour when any basic job pays close to 10x that amount where I live?
---
I honestly miss them more for their cool animations than the actually abilities themselves. Although the leech curses were cool too, especially when you leeched a spec off someone who was using a wep that uses 100% spec bar.
---
Thanks for your feedback, gamespice

Whatever happened to dungeoneering, it came out when I was very young, and since playing again 10 years later it seems to have disappeared. I can't remember if it was any good, that's probably why it's gone. Any insight?

Shit yes missed that also, still doesn‚Äôt make it worse but yeah, so the 92hp thing just plain isn‚Äôt true ?

hahaha, yes for me its because whenever I have these guides up for quests I keep it on half my screen and the other half is for the RS client. With the Fandom wiki site the half screen is not optimized to show the entire page and instead you need to laterally scroll to read the text and look at the content which is impractical.

You spend 600k per hour of shooting rune darts from the darts alone, not worth it profit wise unless maybe you're raiding. You would be better off repotting every 2 minutes or when you lose a max hit.

I hope so.. currently can‚Äôt complete it.. :(

Hi
---
To draw conclusions about how healthy the economy is, we would need to compare it to another economies. This is somewhat easy to do in real life since we have many countries and we can see which economies are doing relatively better than others.
---
The only economy we could compare the osrs one to is the rs3 economy. I haven't been following the rs3 economy for some time now, but the last time I checked it was dealing with huge inflation issues. Compared to the rs3 economy, the osrs might be considered "healthier".
---
Just FYI you can work out your rank by looking at the hiscores.
---
`Your rank √∑ Total number of ranked players * 100 = Your percentile`
---
Erect if correct
---
I had recently bought a year subscription on the permabanned one
---
Yeah sure, but you said "don't need to change their stats."  You'd have to change their stats to lower the combat level.
---
This can be solved by lowering their stats but giving them higher stat bonuses.
---
Crazy, you got the same email that the other 47 people who posted this did! Makes you think.
---
Derek?
---
No one ever implies they‚Äôve hit the kc when they say that so...
---
Yeah..i did say that? And no, you wouldn't. I just said why. Lots of mobs have high/low stats compared to their combat level. Meaning it wouldnt matter.

If one can put a Golden tench in there for ultimate flex I support (even tho I've never even done the activity).

No. They definitely had 2010-2012 backups. It wasn't the most recent one, it was the one closest to 2007. They only looked for 2007 because at the time the 2007scape server had momentum. It was super convenient for Jagex to come in and take the reins and feel comfortable doing it. Had it been a 2010 private server taking off we probably would have never saw a legacy game come to fruition.

---
Well, what is even better is the hundreds of tiny helpful comments that, if are relevant, are up-voted to the top or pinned so that everyone can see them!
---
You must have big pp
---
just check clan it shows time top right
---
I'm well aware lol and while I doubt jamflox would ever implement it, maybe the timezone converted already since I'm on a US east server and that's why they didn't add GMT.

Either way was just weird haha. Broadcasting a live message to a MMO about maintenance and the time, you should \*prob\* add the timezone regardless. xd

But are they hydrodynamic?

Cml has to be updated manually unless you meet certain criteria.

Do you mean it won't update when you try manually? Keep trying every so often, the rs highscores have been slow/unresponsive since the boss kc update.

Ok can someone please explain this slayermusiq1 joke to me? Not kidding I don't actually know what it is

I think the Trophies should be untradable and discontinued but the rewards should be tradeable and discontinued.

I myself am a "13+ year vet" if you're going to be like that. It does not matter how long you have played, and I accept that you disagree with me, however I am right and you should look more honestly at the new additions in RuneScape

It was only maybe 7-8 mins away from being 11:00 GMT but instead of saying it would be in "8 mins" they said at 11, but then the 2nd said "we'll update when its over" so just a poor choice of wording imo. If it's only a few min away then just say that haha vs giving the actual time it'll start without the timezone and be confusing. 
---
Basically it made it sound like it wouldn't be for a while
---
I mean AGENT P
---
Cant argue there lol.
---
Basically the same gear as before blowpipe. Black d'hide or karils with rcb.
---
Just no. Keep it as it is. It's perfect no need to buff/change it.
---
Considering how easy it is to kill the knights, I think 1/1000 is perfectly reasonable. Those GWD items and crystals and blowpipe all come from bosses that need to be learned. The jaw is dropped from an afk monster with only a 60 slayer requirement.
---
If the knights were like 93 slayer and the special attack was much more punishing, I agree that 1/512 would‚Äôve been fine but they‚Äôre not high requirement and they don‚Äôt take any effort to kill. They‚Äôre just AFK and easy AF even after the buffs.

Wiki quick guides are a thing. The issue I had with video guides is that they're never at a perfect pace so you're either sitting there waiting for the youtuber to stop explaining, or you're pausing the video constantly to catch up.

 **Potential Solutions**   
---
 There is also the issue of what to do should Leagues finish altogether.  To avoid being discontinued entirely, they would need to be introduced  through main-game content. Consider this when thinking about the  potential solutions.     
---
 The answer to all of these problems will take one of the forms below, so  we'd like to run these through an opinion poll. Let us know what you  think, and if you have a proposal of your own then please do let us  know.   
---
* Keep trophies the same throughout every League. Make these available elsewhere in the future if Leagues were to stop.

* Keep trophies the same throughout every League. Make these unavailable in the future if Leagues were to stop.

---
Also not to worry if you log in and your bank is empty it's just the double XP being applied to your account.  
---
 
---
They take a snapshot of your bank for reference then empty it because if they don't then when they apply the double XP it'll also double all your bank items. Then once they finish applying double XP they will automatically regenerate the items in your bank based on the snapshot they took.

Not gunna lie, I really enjoy twisted league, but if they make the second version in the kharidian desert I would not play it at all, it‚Äôs my least favourite area of RuneScape for content, plus I don‚Äôt like sand, its coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere.
---
I've had a similar thought, but would say half the gp per hour but times the current exp rates of mining Smith and rc by 3 to 4. This would reduce gold farmers drastically and keep higher lvl skillers interested

Buy Dharok's or full Obsidian armor and get strength levels in NMZ. Get attack levels from your whip during slayer

Arma is like the last armour upgrade you get, which first of the others depends on what you do more.
---
Tbf I've been very on and off over the last couple of years, just thought it was all just high level content. Looks like cox is reachable for me. Appreciate your comment, my rsn is king mills ü§û
---
In rsc there were only 1 type of bolts so if you bought up all the small amounts of them and had a huge stack of them you were able to manipulate prices of then very easily.
---
&gt;I'd suggest making the same trophies available each league so they fill the same spot in the POH and so you can aim for higher spots next league. But what if they had some option, like an inspect or such that listed what your ranks were for ever league you were in? That way the item itself isn't unique to each league but you still had some way to tell.
---
Perhaps when you unlock a certain rank in the league, you unlock the ability to use that tier of trophy. Then, there can be a visual indication of how many times you've achieved that rank on the trophy itself. Upon inspection it tells the rank achieved for every specific league.

Its not that Jad was ever hard, it was the dread of having to spend an hour (no blowpipe) going through the waves just to get to Jad, if you happened to fuck up. The fear of that 1 missclick that could cost you another hour of time. Then again, maybe thats just me.

That's not true! Just yesterday I was brainstorming a new quest where you had to kill a dragon that had destroyed an island. I called it "Dragon killer".
---
Its been a while since ive checked to be fair, so my numbers may be off due to price changes.
---
How fast were you assuming raids where? Also, pts per hour?
---
My numbers were based on 3+2 scales at 20 minutes a raid with pre-scout. Generally raids in this setup with a good team are 18-21 minutes dependant on rooms, running 95-105k pts a raid depending on rooms.
---
This led do a low ball average of each person achieving 90k+ pts per hour.
---
My estimate for solos is lower, as I'm not the best at soloing. I generally get 25 minute raids and account for 5 minutes to scout/be lazy, so only 60k pts per hour as opposed to the 90k in team raids
---
Feedback is welcome! Ive been grinding out tob recently since sand casino has been mean and tob is definitely more gp/HR, however i do like cox more so id love to know how much its changed!
---
I like the idea of wands (and all mage weapons for that matter) giving a spell damage boost. Though I personally think it should be much lower. 
---
Beginner wand and base staves (including base elemental staves) should at most do 1%. Next tier (battle staves) 2.5%. Mystic battle staves 4% (where the teacher wand comes in), and then top tier at 7.5%. Keeping the "above the top/uniques" at their current 15%
---
Tips on what? I just place them in the most convenient locations for what each account is doing, so If 1 account only needs clicks within the inventory/bank it can go to the left of an account that will require clicks across the whole client for example.

Wildy is dead for multiple reasons, of which clans are only a small part. 
---
Prior to EoC (from the creation of bh worlds onward), singles pking, and especially edge pking, was packed with people in shit gear, shit supplies, shit stats, and little understanding of mechanics - it was *incredibly* common to see lvl 110s with like 85/90/80 stats in full rune, maining an ags or even bgs, with no combo eating and sometimes not even venge. People didn't tryhard because they were having fun, and they simply didn't know better. Compare to now, with the player population significantly older (and thus values their time more, so efficiency and knowledge of game mechanics are a priority), that type of shit is gone - you better be maxed (or maxed for pures) and have good gear, because everyone else is, and you had better know the mechanics, or you're going to die a whole hell of a lot more than you kill others. That, and all of the other bullshit, is a massive turn off for players. Singles clans are only a nail in the coffin, not the cause of it.
---
For multi clans, they require a certain level of reciprocity from other clans, since their main function is to fight each other. But the main issue is that no one has time for that bullshit. I was involved in several clans from 2008-2012 (Brut and RSD being the two notable ones). The vast majority of people in those clans were high school or university students, with a lot of free time on their hands. Regular pk trips were set up for *x* time of day/week, and uncapped fights were a regular thing - sometimes lasting 10+ hours. But now, no one has time for that shit. Most people are well into their careers, have families, and other commitments. You're not going to get the same level of commitment as you did in the past, which creates a self-reinforcing cycle of fewer people being involved in clans, leading to its failure. The shenanigan of clans like RoT (which isn't as bad as people here portray it) is similar to singles - it's a symptom, not a cause.
---
People like to bemoan the death of the wildy as something that Jagex should be responsible for fixing. An honest assessment of the situation shows that there's nothing Jagex can do because the conditions for the wildy thriving no longer exist within the playerbase. It's unfortunate, but life is usually unfortunate.

This can be inefficient when you want to buy and sell high value items quickly. Trying to insta-sell/buy 100m worth of gear every task is going to anti merch the shit out of your bank.

Bandos is 48m, with the torture and prims that‚Äôs about 85m. Whip brings it to 87/88m. Depends on if this man is using a facegaurd or not.

Most people in OSRS *don‚Äôt want dungeoneering* ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs not a real skill, but a mini game.‚Äù
---
Which is a stupid fucking argument considering one (or more) of the skills in OSRS is basically a task of click two items in your backpack repeatedly until 99. Or sit at an *actual minigame* for a couple days for 99 Firemaking.
---
Dungeoneering is honestly the last bit of old school that was introduced to RS3. It was a fantastic skill and OSRS would only benefit from it being in the game ‚Äî with some slight changes made to balance rewards, and perhaps offer different areas/settings to train, rather than going to one castle where all the skill training happens. 
---
Sailing could‚Äôve been an amazing skill that would have been built on such changes. But alas ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply not what the old school crowd wants... even if they‚Äôre also okay with weapons like the blowpipe and twisted bow.
---
It‚Äôs all a big joke honestly. Old school is not old school at all anymore, but New School.

You could drop the clue
---
Standard acc: buy a thousand watermelons from the GE and compost them (buy volcanic ash and turn them to ultracompost for even better value)
---
Ironman: collect low level vegetables (cabbages work well) and compost them, then add compost potion
---
Can still teleport though, given other conditions. Teletangle/Tangleblock just creates a sitting duck from the perspective of a wildy hunter/slayer ergo it‚Äôs overpowered.

But why would I commit the level 44's spawn to memory when I can just look for the Orange 360? Yes, I'm perfectly capable of remembering (or marking) the tile that the 44 spawned on, but why even bother when looking for the Orange 360 is perfectly fine? Standard fire cape attempts don't really need to worry about a good jad spawn because you can just wait for him to show up and start praying accordingly.
---
I'm only responding because you said that looking is for the Orange 360 is some of the "WORST advice" you see, when in reality looking for the 44 is unnecessary for the average player.
---
You play the game more efficiently than 99.9% of players, so you're sweaty, yes. I don't even mean that in a derogatory way, if that's how you like playing then more power to you. But don't act like the way you play is anywhere close to "easy".

Well if there was a PJ timer a new new player could actually focus on fighting back against his opponent. These days the wild is so dead and condensed into clans that new players/pkers get absolutely destroyed by the lack of a pj timer.

He understands your point but is trying to explain youre not as right as you think you are - a pj timer would absolutely help. There is a huge group of people who enjoy pking but don‚Äôt because they cba getting pjed alone that would have motivation to go back out, there‚Äôs also new and existing players who would like to pk but know they can just get pjed within a few ticks. No it wouldn‚Äôt turn the wildy into the most populated place in game but it would def help and be a step at getting rid of the cancer that deters people from pking

If this is stopping you doing jad then just letting you know you can log out during fight caves, pressing it will let you then log out after you finish a wave.

People also aren‚Äôt realizing the difference in toxicity in clans. Not going to just sit here and say they‚Äôre all toxic for no reason but when I get killed 4x in the same spot trying to solo even when I come back unskilled, getting flamed every time it kind of says something. Yes the wilderness is for pking but some singles clan make it their goal to clear out the wildy and make it dead. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt step foot in our wildy‚Äù mentality is pathetic

Your blue text is so accurate.

The target system is just fundamentally flawed:
---
1. Teleport to target is totally unfit for purpose while abuse spots exist (teleport to singles, get fucked by some weird tile being single in the middle of multi).
---
2. Targets being able to pj you is aids
---
Just don't...

Another few good mid to long term quest goals are Monkey Madness 1 and 2, and Dragon Slayer 2.  MM2 unlocks Demonic Gorillas and DS2 unlocks Vorkath.  Getting all requirements for all medium diaries also will help your account if you're a main.

I do ammonite crabs on mobile while I'm at work. I can't consistently check my phone every 5 minutes (or even every 20) so I would end up getting kicked out of NMZ all day. I think I get like 90k xp/hr instead of 100+, and I don't get the NMZ points, but I do get to do birdhouses once an hour.
---
Fair enough as I didn‚Äôt raid for a while and it was after I was 126 but at end game raids is the beat PvM content.
---
depends on what teleports you have. Catherby is right by the bank. falador patch has the cabbage teleport on explorer's ring. Kourend is right by Xeric's Glade and Hosidius POH. Also don't forget the double sized bin in the Medium teir farming guild if you have the levels for it.
---
Remember, if you're only farming herbs you'll use between 4 and 9 composts per trip, depending on your open patches, and you get 15 compost per bin. Stock up on 10 or 20 then you can just start each herb run with an 15 melons and some ash, do the one bin at your first allotment, and still have a net gain of compost. or end each run at catherby or the farming guild and do a compost run then.
---
My guess is restricted zones in each area.
---
Brimstone keys are nice, but they're nothing to get excited over. Getting a task in a shitty spot for a single key isn't worth it. More tasks and xp from the other two will get you better money in the long run. 
---
Konar isn't terrible, I did a bunch of tasks from her on my ironman when I was starting slayer, but it's more about the points than any of the rewards. The general advice is to just go with Nieve and then switch to Duradel when you can.

I think some banter is good. Back in the day a lot of wildy fights were started from just banter at the mining rocks or karamja docks haha.

Holy fuck dude you epically roasted him! Burn! He had a family! Calling the burn ward!
---
Imagine having awkward nerds you've never met 'low key' asking you to be their girlfriend, being told your art is shit by countless others... and still being a good sport about everything. Respect to Gee.
---
What's at 83 exactly? Been a while since I got any herb unlocks on my ironman
---
Tesco is also owned by o2, in with Tesco &amp; having problems connecting.
---
Be ready for 30+ more attempts. 
---
Gl tho.
---
Am I misremembering or did they not previously say all the cosmetic rewards would be tradable? I'm doing the whole league on an alt so I could play my main at the same time (though that rarely happened, twisted league is too fun)
---
Yeah those too, even bandits are ok afking on mobile. I tried doing slayer but I'd get to close to dying when I couldn't check my phone lol. I feel like they made the game a bit easier to afk cause they know where all adults with adult shit to do lol.
---
Seems too overpowered.. I would maybe support if the teleblock aspect was a max of like 30 seconds
---
As far as i know, some of the stuff she designed like the new elves didn't really fit the oldschool aesthetic. Which resulted in some players harassing mod Gee.
---
What's episode 3?
---
Thank you! :D
---
Still, congrats!
---
You're getting distracted from the main point
---
Lady verzik when?
---
The entire tweet is like an Azir reference.
---
im not sure that is an option for everyone
---
and the GPU plugin is workin just fine?
---
Ur comment sounds straight out of an infomercial lmao
---
They give an update each week, or you can just tool around the highscores to figure out the total player count and then calculate your percentile.
---
a lot of people on reddit downvote you for mentioning you have a girlfriend, just so you know for the next post. this is funny though, made me smile
---
Thanks man! I'm having a ton of fun with it so far :) the game feels exciting once again!
---
Definitely is much easier üòÜ
---
Not every woman needs them, but if we‚Äôre designing them from thin air via pixels why not throw a set of D‚Äôs on?
---
you think those people didnt just make a new company and start selling again? They're not gonna stop making money just because a couple websites got shutdown
---
I had base 80+ combats when I started slayer and it was much more enjoyable. Why do you give a shit how other people play?
---
What day of the week do they post the update?
---
Thank you :)
---
Lol I like how it would have been fine if he just chose either.
---
I get the impression that he really wanted to illustrate how inclusive he is.
---
i don't, I just said to have fun. why the fuck do you care about how I tell other people to play?
---
Wait what? Konar looks pretty badass. If Mod Gee designed her props to her.
---
Why would they? Think like a multi million dollar industry
---
What does wasting time/money lagging servers for what is now irrelevant to you?
---
They find a new niche, game, and whatever it may be.
---
Do people actually quest in it a lot? Usually I just hop between a couple super populated worlds to see if anyone else is doing the same quest
---
Bro, a few seconds in a photo manipulation program could give you what youre asking for.
---
Nope. MOBA is a completely different genre of play.
---
because they have low slayer level and will only be able to be assigned low level slayer tasks even though they would have a combat level of over 100.
---
Does Jagex still appeal permanently banned accounts? I recall a post about this.
---
Your point is what
---
Global warming in Gielnor has changed the climate in the Kharidian desert.  Waterskins are no longer required for the league.
---
Bruh she‚Äôs a j mod
---
not sure why you guys want cosmetic rewards from the TL to be available to players who never played it, kind of whack.
---
hahaa
---
You can't be 23 cuz im 23
---
\-No slayer master
---
\-Almost no questlines can be completed without like 50 quests from other areas (most notably cat, demon slayer and digsite)
---
\-Next to no wc/fletch/firemaking/herblore
---
idk man, it doesn't have a lot going for it. Swamp League pls.
---
He is referred to as male by one NPC but referred to as female by a couple others I believe. So maybe Zulrah is just rocking both.
---
Obby plate you can resell, so it doesn't have a time cost when you eventually sell it and buy bandos chestplate.  
---
Torso others are saying takes about 2 hours.  
---
1 str bonus is worth about 0.8% extra dps, as it will only provide an extra max hit at some levels.  
---
You'd need to use Torso for at least 250 hours over obby for the 0.8% faster to save 2 hours of time. Do you envision yourself doing this?  
---
Personally I never did the torso or pest control grind and I have no regrets. Though if I ever get into ToB I might have to get void for that.
---
I just did this with a hcim. I'm so far playing my main about 10x less than it and loving it. Just start and muddle your way through for a good time, or atleast I'm loving it
---
I'm building a baby pure and I tried bhv2 a couple weeks after launch, it was almost mostly people asking me to sell a kill for their ironman. Selling kills is actually probably pretty good money, 200k+ per sell, in theory. Pretty annoying if I wanted to just fight someone though.
---
Sweet! Glad it worked out
---
wait, so you haven't had sex since you started your RS account?
---
&gt; I could be wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure you can get a purple even with very low points, it‚Äôs just less likely than if you had the optimal amount.
---
Yup, we had a +1 with barely 1k points snipe a dhcb a few weeks ago. Very unlikely, but possible.
---
The tablet and elite clues rate stays the same, everything else you just get in lower amounts.
---
Chill dude , in a month u can have all this 23 to ur self , am moving to 24 .
---
Heard some good shit about it .
---
that seems like more fun too
---
If you got good gear and blowpipe, you can out dps a few healers
---
I wonder why
---
People with buoyancy aids and an actual good reason to do so.
---
Don't mean to hijack the question, but in this case when would you go for the general BiS stuff? Is the obby for just when you want to kill quickly? Is it worth sinking GP into an obby set before going for Bandos, etc?
---
Technically they‚Äôre all 99s...
---
Animal crossing was the shit, I‚Äôd love to see this lol
---
Nah, theyre for buoyancy control bro come on
---
thats the point. The game shouldn't be able to be "bott(ed) without breaking the rules"
---
Well that was a rabbit hole
---
petition to ban OP
---
Merching. Also 99smith rune 2h‚Äôs are nutty
---
Yeah
---
Oh man, that's dedication. I got mine at just over 200k tokkul and wanted to pull my hair out
---
Ehh I don't mind it. This game is such a grind I don't mind options that make it more bearable. I don't care for the I walked uphill both ways in the snow crowd that wants everyone else to do it too
---
Oh shit zulrah farming? They do be looking fresh doe üëÄ
---
Fantastic. Thank you much!
---
Because I've played this game for 15 years. It's not my first time training any of these skills.
---
Is there not a female version of every event?
---
I'm guessing it's more upper management, you can easily tie dev times to a dollar amount and management sees dev projects that don't get implemented as wasted money
---
what did u make the app in unity or?
---
No, that is not what we are questioning here. It is far more weird what we are seeing here than you think..
---
I remember back in rs2 I was pvping against Bonesaw in Varrock square and he had like 10 boot lickers standing under me and spamming/insulting to distract me. Reminds me of Abyss currently
---
Hello OP, fuck you.
---
Both spells are from the standard spell book so let‚Äôs slap it on the lunar
---
Lol it even said "this ones going to be good!" And it was 133k loot master. Rip me. 
---
It's pretty dope though, tells you the item when you tap it, and the value of that item.
---
Nice.
---
I made my account in 2006 and still use it for osrs now, you still have more pk‚Äôs than me lmao
---
The lack of content in the desert isn‚Äôt even comparable, at least with Kourend there are a room for development
---
pls stop letting mod gee feminist our game models
---
I want huge tits long hair females
---
Jacked short hair men
---
and all female characters white not fukin blue
---
Remove the GE so players have to interact again
---
Killing ogresses on corsair cove wouod be the best. You dont need to do dragon slayer but if youndo you get acess to the less crowded area to kill them. Id reccomend atleast 40 range. You can safespot them. Bringna fire staff and nature runes to alch the rune item drops and a chisle to cut the gems for some crafting xp. Trains range, mage, crafting and HP while making decentish money. Then once you get the bond your range should be atleast 75. Then id reccomend banging out as many quests as you can.
---
I feel it's pretty tame for today's character design standards
---
The waterskins never really bothered me tbh, removing them from league would possibly be necessary for a good start but after maybe an hour or so the removal of them would remove part of the deserts challenge
---
I want to pick up OSRS after leaving EOC a few years back with a 24XX total account but I‚Äôm no longer a high school student with unlimited hours to burn grinding out stats. 
---
With that said is there a guide anywhere that shows the minimum levels and quests needed to do the ‚Äúfun‚Äù stuff? I‚Äôm planning on going for max combat stats while only training other skills to access content
---
A Friend has definitely made a comeback. I just can‚Äôt stop listening to his voice. Lull me to sleep Karambwandaddy.
---
yes, who cares. skills are boring as fuck in the game.
---
Sigh
---
Jagex is resetting osrs cuz too much sht got duped including experience rewards
---
A lot of people just can't be assed or are trying to type too quickly. It doesn't happen as much anymore, but some people also misspell to be kewl. 
---
Also fuck trying to spell some of the things in this game. I don't think I've seen a single person spell Bryophyta correctly.
---
tiddies
---
&gt;I'm not like other guys
---
Wow a true gem aren't you
---
On crab claw isle as well... sigh..
---
Ah coolio, I'm stuck at 85 to 86 for supercombats woth boost
---
Thank you
---
Just do yourself a favour and get a month of membership.
---
One disappointing thing about some of the recent updates is how the Underground Pass is now instanced. It was fun to watch other people go through it.
---
50/50 either you get it or you don‚Äôt.
---
T1 relic ability tho
---
Half this sub can't read gud.
---
From an evolutionary standpoint a fish person would not have large breasts.
---
Rsn?!
---
Stonks
---
Gilded chungus
---
I watch his videos but so many people talking everywhere
---
I get lost lol
---
What rewards? Herb boxes? Imbues? What's wrong with any of that?
---
You are in the minority. If you look at player counts, when osrs first launched it was booming, then the lack of content caused the player base to dwindle away. Then we started getting some content updates like gwd or new slayer bosses. Zeah brought a ton of people, raids, twisted league, song of the elves. A game with absolutely no updates gets stale and eventually dies. 
---
If you want a 2005 style server, host your own private server.
---
And what are you going to do make a buffed blowpipe?  I think if anything make cosmetic attachments that make the item untradeable and destroy the item if removed.
---
Remove the game so players have to go outside again.
---
or they own bot farms.
---
That's why so many people hate it. They think it's too easy. Even though the requirements to afk NMZ most efficiently are fairly high. Mainly quests.
---
Exactly. Not as difficult of a grind but I have been keeping myself deep into rune and the amount of time it takes to just keep up and not get left behind is a lot. I get the top~20 ~5 ~1%  is the minority by definition  but jagex is seriously going to lose their hardcore players in the next league if they don‚Äôt make it unique.
---
Bring runes for blood rush and runecbow everything. Or get 75 range tbh it's not that much xp from 70 and will make the fightcaves a breeze
---
200iq play
---
Perfect. Thanks for the info! Can't wait to get grinding my Dharok's for NZ imbue grinding!
---
Now just limit how many caskets can be opened daily then add the ability to buy casket keys!
---
Pathetic. You were like 2 when classic was released ofc you don‚Äôt remember that the PvP was wildly popular.
---
party rat
---
Haha I remember everyone saying bond prices would come down around Christmas because everyone gets presents and will buy bonds.  Glad I held onto my bonds I bought at 3.5m
---
You're playing a fucking MMO. If you dont wanna be around other players, play a different game. People like you are ruining this game.
---
Honestly, I was expecting more naga jokes in the comments.
---
what about a quest were u make a cake. it called cake assistent
---
Would be OP yeah?
---
If you feel like making money in runescape is of equal enjoyment as an actual job you're playing the wrong game
---
Oof.
---
What do you consider fun? PvM? Slayer? Bossing? Skilling? Pking?
---
Stop karma whoring.
---
Not to be a downer but his pet rate is 1/60ish. Claw is like 1/20, it has the most common pet drop in the game
---
gonna use them to chase Venezuelans
---
What exactly is crashing btw? Long time player, but I never got into the community until now.
---
romosomi KEKW teuPoooound
---
People who don't abuse to NMZ to 90+ melees are basically gimping themselves, and NMZ makes it super easy to get melee levels so anyone who isn't a super casual already has (near) max melees. The problem is the gap it creates between people who camp NMZ and people who don't, the Basilisk Knight drama was a symptom of this, it had to be buffed because such a large portion of the playerbase did NMZ to max melees so it had to be balanced around those players, upsetting the players who don't train as efficiently.
---
You need another vorkath head so you can have the effect on range cape and max cape
---
They're not twisted leagues. They are twisted. This one is league as its theme. The deserts could be say twisted pilgrimage. Twisted tournament. Or twisted hot af but it wouldnt be league
---
ah, good call! Forgot that 83 was for the jewelery box
---
Nope, just wanted a sink.
---
You're upset people are trying hard in a competition? Lol
---
Those are the odds of specifically 2 tanz fangs.
---
2 uniques is 9x more common: about 1/116.5k.
---
Yes to al of this. Bibs my guy
---
Lots of good advice on here...  Hellhounds too (since you said you're tired of them)
---
Wtf is with the platinum?
---
anything other than zeah would be absolute disaster for area locked game mode
---
Yis
---
Kalico Cat!
---
Do you not know what shadowbanning is???? its literally an instance where bots can still play the game, bot, do everything they want,but gold has no value. The whole point of this is to keep bots in the game but have 0 effect. If a bot gets banned, theyll simply make a new bot. If they look like their unbanned, then theyll keep playing the game but in reality they arent.
---
And who cares?! I don't have to 3 tick everything in order to play the game. Maybe I want to watch a movie while I AFK on the side or play some pokemon training my stats. Maybe I just want to get my nearly 99 combat stat to 99? I had been doing slayer on my main and got a very high attack level from it using a whip. I went ahead and finished it out at nmz and got 99 attack. Now I have points for days and could open herb boxes for days. I seriously don't get why everything has to be efficientscape. Lemme play the way I want to damnit.
---
Good man.
---
That‚Äôs a perfect metaphor haha! God that guy on the highway pisses me off so much!
---
Even after multiple updates Zeah is still sparse and mis-scaled.
---
Maybe, but if all I'm doing is AFKing some herb experience or alching some bows or whatever, I've got no reason not to pick up an oyster pearl someone dropped on the tile next to me.
---
If you saw a quarter on the sidewalk and went over to pick it up, you could do the math about how much money you actually made per hour by deviating from your path for 25 cents over the course of three seconds. Or you could just pick up the free quarter, put it in your pocket and go about your business. I prefer the second attitude.
---
This overall limits the amount of real bots in the game
---
unfortunately, dh isnt actually good at your combat lv. you need like pretty high melee stats and health for it to beat a normal whip/sarasword/abby dagger setup/like 89 hp to beat full obby
---
This is coming from a long term staker. over 10,000 stakes over 24 months. Over the last 6-12 months shadowbanning has been introduced behind our vision. Not once, have I or anyone I have ever met, lost 9 in a row, then continued to win 2 in a row, to lose 28 immediately after, IN A ROW, you do the math, the chance to lose 28 in a row on a 50/50 game is near impossible and i would doubt it had ever happened prior to 12 months ago. 
---
**\*SHADOWBANNING IS REAL, OPEN YOUR EYES, STOP BEING SO FOCUSED ON YOUR ONE IDEA\***
---
what are you talking about, the place has magical carpets. That's hours and hours of fun alone right there. And don't even get me started on all that free space to run around and let your hair loose.
---
I have a feeling my question has been asked before so I‚Äôm gonna ask it here first.
---
AST night I was given a Cabe Kraken boss task. Cave kraken are on my blocked list. Is it an intended game mechanic to receive them as a boss task when I already have them blocked? Seems silly to have to use another 30 points to cancel a task that I already have blocked....
---
Wildy slayer is still pretty good for ironmen to get a rune pouch (&lt;30 tasks total) but you probably won't make any money doing it unless you use bare minimum supplies.
---
Beat me by 1 üòÇ gz dude
---
Why do we even have fun weapons? Who the fuck picks "fun weapons" as a option at the duel arena?
---
I remember doing it once with the cat toy when I was a kid and it was like a 10 minute fight.
---
Besides boxing and xlogging what is the point of giving weapons negative attack bonus when it doesn't make the fight anymore fun?
---
Yews. I want to try the mushrooms method but I‚Äôm scared being a noob I don‚Äôt want to die lol
---
Counter point: the only reason wilderness isn‚Äôt dead right now is because of these clans.
---
Clan matrix is also cool! Lots of skillers, a few pvmers
---
What are you trying to say?
---
Pure Essence, maybe? The price of that has been down in the dirt forever because NMZ offers a really easy line to get tons and tons of it. 
---
Not that I think training Runecrafting needs to become expensive as well as slow, but if the price rose on essence a bit then it'd be less of a kick in the junk to get it from things like Brimstone Keys. 
---
I know NMZ supplies were intended to devalue things that were frequently botted, but now the price has tanked so hard that not even bots bother with essence mining.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of variables but in short yes. You can either duo but with solo strategies, 2+2 raids are good pts/hr, you can just have one person mage skip. But yeah it‚Äôll also come down to how you define efficient. But is it possible? Yes.
---
28 in a row is 1/270 million or 135m duels.
---
how many duels do you think have happened since osrs creation?
---
it is possible ? yes. doesnt mean the game is rigged. a content creator recently hit a drop @ basically the same rarity...
---
https://twitter.com/Sononoldschool/status/1201427053381210112/photo/1
---
Yes, it's part of the reason everyone hates boss tasks.
---
That's why I specified *pure* black skin.
---
I'm down for some soul wars :D
---
Get two more mage levels and he can use the black salamander for 6 gp a cast. He could of not done the diary and still profit with that thing. 
---
Otherwise If you're using Ibans no diary you can go negative in costs unless you're kiting the melee brothers to save on ppots.
---
Are you doing 1 kill trips? Otherwise you are gunna need to restore your prayer
---
Okay so you think Jagex tells you about every little update they do, especially when it affects RWTers.
---
 Yes I know they are targeting RWTers and people renting staking accs etc, but the problem is they put the accounts made to be stakers into a general consensus of "BOT" hes only done lost city and some nmz quests and afked his life away so lets fuck with his win/loss, not all of us botted just to stake, a lot of us put the effort in to make these accounts as easy and fast as possible, because who wants to waste time doing quests and skills you don't need to stake.   
---
What I'm saying is all these accounts are put into a pool and labelled bots, shadowban them and then change their win/loss chances in the arena such as suggested by mod Matt K when he reigned. Explain to me how you think they never implement things we don't see, hear or know about...
---
e.g Admin specific items that a lot of us never knew were made until we saw them on a stream?? You sir are small minded and idiotic.

Elder/twisted/kodai are just labels they chose to represent "melee/range/mage item that comes from CoX". The original plan was for CoX to drop new BiS armour for all 3 styles - elder armour/twisted armour/kodai robes. They were repeatedly polled and kept failing, so eventually the team gave up on them and polled new rewards like dclaws/tbow that passed.

So this is why i made 6 figures at arena last year and now im indebt 113k this year. Hmmm
---
That means a lot to me :) thank you so much! I hope that you'll enjoy the vids :D
---
yeah which boss is rolled independantly of your blocklist if you draw a boss task.
---
but why did you have to skip it, you can set it to 3 and it takes 5 minutes
---
"i dont understand statistics"
---
ok so now let's look at how many duels were probably done in osrs, id say maybe 1 billion, or close to.   
---
that equates to **maybe 5 people getting a 27 loss streak in OSRS HISTORY.**
---
explain to me why i know atleast 9 people that have similar accounts for staking, all with 20-35 loss streaks in the last 12 months, never ever seen before. (all long time stakers)
---
You're again, being closed minded and idiotic.
---
Do people actually give a shit about other people‚Äôs levels?
---
Full obsidian if you've got 60 in each.
---
The helm, body, and legs make it do like 20% more damaged, and stacks with the berserker necklace. One is 20% and the other is 10%. Add the shield or a defender, some climbing/dragon boots and a fcape you've got a very strong kit. Probably will be your entire 5m though. Not good for slayer however if you have a slayer helm/black mask

Now when i think about it , i also thought he is the good guy .

On Android I like using this program called scrcpy that runs everything on my phones hardware, it just displays the screen I can interact with on my PC. It uses Android debug bridge so you don't need USB type c 3.0 to be able to do that. After that I'll resize it and force it to always be on top.

I can use runelite but the gpu plugin doesn't work for me on Linux so for more chill stuff like minnows.

Hey bro join L0st Dynasty cc I‚Äôm one of the owners!

We do everything content wise you can think of daily and there‚Äôs always people to hang out with even if it‚Äôs just shooting shit in the cc. Lmk bro we‚Äôd love to have a new friend! IGN: TTTankey

info.com is a spoofed domain. If it was not spoofed, it would not matter since they don't look at replies. Scripting a bot to insert false data into the recovery form will not matter since I'm sure they can write a query to group by ip and delete where count is &gt; 3. There's nothing you can do other than ddosing them or trying sql injections to delete their database.
---
Camping NMZ and then doing Slayer after mid or high 90's combats is literally the correct way to do it.
---
Have you tried low/ mid level slayer without stacks of cash?
---
Believe you me, that guy is gonna enjoy speeding through the first 70 levels of slayer in a single sitting one shotting everything.
---
nerd
---
I mean if i just antifire and get a dihns and pray range ill be fine, and i just have to tank one freeze to get out of multi. The thing is, there is no other option. 15 k for a black d‚Äôhide set or 2m for Karil top and tank legs.  Its simply not worth the extra risk, mystics is like 120k or something and next upgrade is ahrims. A normal mystic d‚Äôhide set risk is about 700k with everything and the next step is a few mil.
---
And the problem you stated is more a multi problem not just a low risk PK gear.
---
Mate stop downvoting all my posts and commenting on them, you're being a weirdo.
---
I mean, they already added the KKK outfit, might as well.
---
What slayer level are you m8. I'm chilling at 800ish and I skip ALOT. if I didn't skip, I'd be at 6k+....also have 2 coloured helms, herb sack, many extends ect
---
60-82 is ~15m in oak planks
---
It's not really the same thing though. If it takes you about 4 seconds to spot and pick up a quarter (it might take less), and you did that for an hour, 3600/4*$0.25=$225/h if you averaged it out for an hour.
---
So picking up a quarter is a good idea unless you can make more than $225 an hour, whereas picking up a 150gp item is only worth it if you can't make 55k-250k/h depending on your speed.
---
Again I'm not trying to be pedantic, I just like efficiency math.
---
Nahh, gotta wait for the desert to get its expansion first.
---
Hahahaha.
---
As a tech person I'm just laughing.  You'd be surprised at how many store non hashed passwords.
---
Hey do you think the other RuneScape players here ever click on your user history and realize your an antisemitic white nationalist?
---
Gz man ! Cb lvl ?
---
I think places where you need high accuracy, as the obby sword and necklace got shit accuracy stats. Also when slaying you use slayer helm+bis gear. And I think for strength levels above 96 regular BiS gear is better. 
---
So... before then, definitely invest in obby set and the berserker necklace! It‚Äôs power is really underestimated.
---
Jagex can't fix PvP when the players don't actually want to fight each other. 
---
Any pkers worth their salt have a great time fighting others, anyone else wants to risk cabbage and some skimpy black tights for millions.
---
It's more about supplies from WT
---
Clue boxes are tradable on the GE.
---
I feel like players underestimate how big of a negative impact the GE had on player experience
---
Kkk, klue kount klub
---
I still enjoy edge pking the most out of anything.  But yeh max hits just keep getting higher...
---
fairly high? Those quests are easy and don't take long to get done. For xp purposes at least, if we're talking about points that's a different story, but most people just do it for the xp.
---
Bro I just made a HCIM but I‚Äôm leaving it f2p until I get all my starter skilling out the way like fishing cooking mining smithing woodcutting and firemaking. I thought it would be boring but running around and grabbing all my shit has been so much fun! I plan to become a member soon once I get around 60 in those (minus FM 50). 
---
Bottom line is do it and just go have fun, half of the fun is not knowing what you‚Äôre doing and figuring it out :]
---
accessability settings enable zoom
---
\&gt;NMZ gives us imbues, herb boxes, redirection scrolls
---
all brokenly overpowered and deserve to be in other parts of the game that lack meaningful rewards (Pre 77 RC), herb boxes in general deserve to be take out because you shouldnt be able to profit from the most braindead low effort yet also best skilling method in the game for 5 skills
---
\&gt; plus afk melee experience
---
you should, in every situation be able to get better rates with more effort, lavas/abyss, 3 tick fishing, 3 tick hunter, etc. but melee has like 8 really easy quests as a req and a tradable armor set and basic af stats and you now have the literal end game of melee training forever and its significantly easier.
---
you take it out cause its a fucking piece of shit that gives busted ass rewards with no thought behind why or how.
---
Great piece buttttttt ancestral bottoms&gt;Tassies
---
"OSRS Leagues" was not spectacular branding in general, to be honest. It's not like RS3 has an immediate parallel. Something like "Regional Leagues" would have been better.
---
there's mobs that drop enough pure essence that it still out beats mining it. So nmz ain't the only place hurting that.
---
I‚Äôd shoot for around 85+ mage and 80+ range.
---
Anyone can learn it. My friend who used to try it died constantly, a week later he had 100+ KC. It just takes some practice.
---
P.S. Responding smarmily to someone picking apart a single phrase of theirs in order to look better doesn't make you any less wrong.
---
See, that's the difference between us. I hate efficiency math. And I play RS mostly AFK. Skill 'n chill, that's what I say.
---
The new armour + weapon that just passed are extremely strong against basilisks. Going to increase the kills/h by a lot, so people are dumping jaw now in anticipation.

You lose a max hit without tassies

The only alching that high level players that can afford to spend 8m on a staff do is while on slayer tasks. The staff is basically dead content but was made a required item which is just stupid.
---
Would be kinda like making a kurask head a required item for masters or something, useless item that now needs to be grinded.
---
I'll give that a shot. Thanks!
---
I don't know what criticism she got, but for anyone wondering what kind of criticism is acceptable or not when giving feedback to the artists, here are some guidelines:
---
1. Be specific about what you don't like (the colors, the size, shape, certain part of the model, etc)
---
2. Give an example of how it can be changed (brighter, darker, less busy, less boring, etc)
---
3. Bonus points if you can be extra specific by providing a picture or a detailed description of the change
---
4. Don't just say "it's shit" or "I don't like it" this is usually unhelpful because there could be a ton of different things someone could dislike about it. Stop and think and really reflect on what you don't like and why.
---
My mom would only let me buy membership during the summer, so I wouldn't neglect my school work. Little did she know that everything was more time consuming in f2p so I wasted more time on runescape during the school year!
---
My friend quit sand casino and now is addicted to ToB. Could give that a try.
---
He turned it in and got an inferno cape :)
---
It's just a weird choice to make negative attack styles, because the only way it has ever been used has been to abuse the mechanics in Pvp. Like I'm not seeing what they intended people to do with it.
---
Let'er ride boys!!! Keep this party train goin!!
---
Do you have an easy clue scroll banked? I don't think that would be it, but I can't think what else it would be.
---
Fairly certain I slayed thousands of chickens in lumbridge with a rusty iron sword and just left the body‚Äôs to rot, and uncertain how many bird of paradise my traps on fossil island have captured, and yet I felt bad about the parrot too.
---
I'm working on getting base 80 and I'm not sure if I should be going for some useful 99s like crafting or construction. Any advice?
---
Top left artwork has seen some shit
---
Just buy a Zamorak mjolqueerikia
---
Dont do anything with free vpns.
---
No one is buying pure essence from the NMZ shop.
---
Errr have you done much Slayer?
---
Shut the fucking servers down
---
on mobile with 4 clicks per hour?  no, no comparision really
---
Gee is such a blessing
---
they dont target anyone because it isnt in the game you cave dweller
---
How can i appeal a perma ban? I got falsely banned for macro even though I've never botted. I've used runelite but that's it, and only used the default plug ins
---
Oh Evony...
---
Unfortunately not :(. I just feel like I'm missing something obvious or my account is bugged lol
---
alright bud calm down I was just making a joke
---
nobody disagrees with you except for jagex
---
Some of us already went through the slow leveling process during rs2 and would like that grind to be a bit quicker this time around. I personally maxed combat in 2007 and it was a painful experience. I recently maxed combat in osrs and it was pretty easy and enjoyable. Thanks, Nmz.
---
Constantly dropping pestle and mortars from herb cape and people at 2k total world flock to it.
---
I don't think there is a good way to handle it. If you where to make a system that isn't abuseable then it would be too complicated for real players to do without feeling like a waste of time, or it wouldn't give any good loot at all.
---
I think reporting players and banning them is too big of a job to do properly too and never ending. You'd have to hire like a team of 5 to just monitor bounty Hunter and that's what like 100k a year or something In wages alone?
---
5ge6 can use other mechanics. Like he got a range att or he'll fly towards you and melee you just something else other than that it's dead people only farm him for pet. Maybe the could update his loot table and add a chance for a new UK unique one that can go in a tool, armor, or weapon. I wanna play this game for as long as it's up. And the only thing to do that is to revamp and reinvent
---
Very noob, what's WT?
---
atm im risking 140k on 3 accs total not each, deleting ppl from zammy altar / revs
---
+65 magic acc doesnt splash &gt;70% of the time
---
+165 range +117 str, bolt spec 64s?
---
pvp can be very dumb
---
Go kill Sand Crabs.  They drops loads of them when you afk with that relic.
---
Cute
---
got mine after like easily 50+ attempts with acb, d'hide, ahrims. please don't do it without a tbow for your own mental sake, it made me almost quit the game.
---
Im almost 93 slayer, skip all the time, im always around 1k points lol
---
That‚Äôs a bullshit lie. Zeah was balanced enough to hold twisted league; if it wasn‚Äôt then it wouldn‚Äôt have been able to support it. It‚Äôs not sparse at all and has starting to mid game to endgame content.
---
It's LOUD and that makes it FUNNY
---
Your lifetime membership is still active, and they actually do still push updates.

I'm still an X-guardian, and my house has accrued a lot of interest...
---
Work towards getting MM2 and DS2 complete.
---
U can just do ffa. It's what I do
---
RSPS‚Äôy
---
i dont really think itd take much effort at all to enforce, all theyd need to do is check their tipoff email and require clip submissions. once they started giving 2 weeks/perms for it all the real players would ofc stop doing it, then itd just be bot  farms, which require a lot of accounts whichd all get banned at once upon a single player report.
---
if it wasnt just one world and one relatively small area of the map i'd agree with you, enforcing would be unrealistic.
---
NPC's dont drop emblems anymore, so its either slayer points or Bounty Hunter.
---
u guys are getting roasted lmao

Aw yes, the standing for 30 mins trying to find someone selling the thing I need at a reasonable price. It was so amazing trying to find that one person, attempting to read the chat faster than the spammers. Then having to locate them! Wow what a dream!
---
Now its an awful ordeal, having to name search for the needed item. Putting in a set price and waiting at most 5 minutes for the trade to go through. 
---
/s
---
The GE is an amazing addition to the game, I remember when it was first added and it greatly improved my QOL. I will never not want or need the GE, and the silly arguments of "no player interaction" are baseless. And is in no way a negative thing, the encounters i have these days are 100% toxic. I encounter racism, homophobia, transphobia every play time. The less I have to interact with the player base the better off I am.
---
This would be a great idea for a nmz rework.
---
I've solo'd Corp on a main before. It's fun to do sometimes
---
Don't have the stats but gonna work towards itüòÇ is it similar to dungeoneering???
---
Nice !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You are able to skip
---
Damn, i need to copy pasta this for future posts
---
trident is a pitchfork staff.
---
That's alpha af
---
Yea but most methods need a rock cake/locator orb, which I think both are from grandmaster quests. Or Dharok's which requires base 70. Or Guthan's. Sure, a low level with minimal quests can go in and still afk, but at that point it's not much better than sand crabs or something.
---
Beats my 8kc hilt
---
Or gmaul them out for the lulz.
---
yeah geargias
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it
---
I do camp it. Maybe its because you have arcane and i use the god book. But i bring a ppot each inventory but never end up using a sip after like 8 kills. Its actually kind of nice. Prayer is only 78 too
---
Probably not the exact same group of people, but there's definitely some overlap
---
your dps will be shit and you'd have to be the runner but you can still easily complete it. chambers is easy as fuck cmonbruh. even with the worst people on earth you can just keep running in until olm is dead. never understood that design lol.
---
Based on what they said at least, the community demanded a 2008 server, Jagex said there was none. Eventually Jagex 'found' a backup of 2007, pre GWD which we got. There was no mention of anything else. Definitely possible they did have it but that's mere speculation.
---
I'd compare it to an "ironman lite" mode. Plus, the map was more populated due to less worlds but also hubs being dispersed
---
For something that you can easily afk its pretty good
---
How are you dying? Running out of food? Poison? Icecuntbug?
---
Random tips:
---
Vorkath runs on 6 attack cycle, every 6th attack is icecuntbug or poison, alternating. so if first spec was acid, prepare for icecunt, vice versa. If you count attacks there are no surprises other than first
---
Bring a slayer staff set to autocast crumble undead. No need to click ground and easy forgiveness if you misclick cuntbug
---
Step 2-3 tiles backwards as soon as Poison comes, I find that easier to find a nice solid poisonless path. Dont be afraid to tank one or two poison pools to get to safety initially
---
Lastly, tbh no rigour and no void elite with blowpipe sounds miserable. I honestly hate blowpipe vorkath, its much harder then dhcb. Consider grinding elite void/ some range levels/ dhcb/rigor to make 50 kc grind easier. You got this!
---
That's insane.
---
How much do they go for nowadays?
---
Really? I do 90% of my slayer tasks with melee ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I do the POH method. Refresh my hp/prayer/spec  in between kills. Usually end each kill with like 5-10 prayer left.
---
Try using the beta worlds when they're active to save on supplies
---
Here at 400kc and still no unique...
---
I think the random spawn with increased loot tables. Would make the wilderness very interesting.  The uncertainty for both pvm and PVP. Would make it very fun. Imagine if kbd just roamed the wilderness. But had wild rewards. 
---
You could then add PK rewards by adding a modifier to dropped items from wilderness bosses. 
---
For example.
---
Kbd drops "super awesome bow (D)"
---
Once you leave the wilderness it reverts permanently into "super awesome bow"
---
Any item with (D) doesn't drop but is instead destroyed and given to pkr's as untradeable keys.
---
The keys open up a chest for "super awesome arrows"
---
You make the two items balance off of each other.
---
Voila.
---
Shit you're right.. I wouldn't have been able to bash people with it though, and seeing as how I never actually used it for magic that would have been a dealbreaker for 8 year old me
---
Cr√ºnge
---
It literally has to be this right? Or he let himself get venomed at the end?
---
I want my money back
---
Then there is me only picking up vials to add to the other 2m of them in my bank
---
Yeah those are the only two logical explanations and all I can say is oof
---
Keep on keeping on. The grind will be worth it üí™
---
I dunno man, I would have given him the Sandwich Lady.
---
Did u talk to oziach?
---
Agility, 43 prayer. Buy LOTS of Stamina pots because you're going to run two an a half marathons.
---
I am aware that I will recieve downvotes for replying with Nice at this time, but I wish to continue the chain for the memes.
---
My tip: bring super budget gear. 
---
Salve, bgs, blowpipe +1 (archer ring, barrows gloves, whatever), black dhide and snakeskin in other slots. For supplies just bring like one ppot and lobsters, pre-pot everything else in the bank. 
---
That way, each time you die you lose maybe 20k in gear/food (make sure you protect item), and you just bring out another set. Don't worry about buying your items back.
---
Bonus is that when you do get it down, your kills with actual gear will be faster and more consistent than you're used to
---
There is **NO SUCH THING** as a half A press!
---
"It's like A Tribe Called Quest, you say the whole thing."
---
Imagine actually thinking I'm trying to show off to other people on a reddit thread buried a few comments deep on a hidden comment. I'm literally just talking to you, stop deflecting shit and just own up to it smh man.
---
sell your spades before they crash!
---
Low cost (so little bit of loss per item) but buyable in bulk is rune arrows. Don't know if this is still viable tho, check a alch calculator for the current best items of the day.. pretty sure u can ask Uncle Google on how to find such a calculator.
---
Good luck and have fun!
---
Thank you for calling to the Gielinor's Genocide help center‚Ñ¢, My name is Vannaka, what can I help you with?
---
I love comparing the effort put into challenges in twisted leagues versus bounty hunter.
---
Twisted leagues get hundreds of interesting challenges for the gamemode.
---
Bounty Hunter gets 10 such as "kill someone without protect item."
---
Makes me vomit that the team can't come together and actually make something fun for PvP. The Jmod Husky openly states he hates pvp. At what point do the players that enjoy PvP take their $11 to a private server that is dedicated to PvP?
---
I mean jagex and other companies suing facebook
---
That would be massive loss gained after alchs... Sorry I had to break it to ya..
---
I got assembler around 25 kc (I'm at 140+ now). 
---
You can drink the potions before you start the fight, it should last you the whole fight. You can drink it right before you wake him up. If you're talking about the rapid fire fireballs, make sure you are walking and not running. Try to find a few tiles in a line where you can walk back and forth on to avoid the machine gun. I would suggest checking out videos on YouTube if you're struggling with a specific phase. When he's not doing machine gun, green poison pools, ice block freeze, or super fireball, you should be attacking him. 
---
I didn't have rigour or a BGS. I still don't have either of them. I honestly think with your stats it's possible to get the 50kc no problem. It sounds like you're having more trouble on the mechanics of the fight rather than not having high stats. Don't worry about people telling you to get a DHCB or w/e. 
---
I hope you join the Assembler crew soon, brother.
---
I like your thoughts. Would be awesome and very dynamic. That way you could add a game mode like MonsterHunter. The pvm equivalent of bounty hunter. Where a player is assigned a certain monster wich must be hunted down and killed in a certain period of time.
---
It sure would make the wilderness wild again.
---
Can i get a list of things polled multiple times until they passed/got pushed as integrity?
---
Almost mesmerizing. Way more pleasing to look at than splashers /s
---
I think it's a 4chan meme, i found it from a YouTube video. YouTube search "I'm a coomer"
---
That‚Äôs why then. It‚Äôs less kills per hour to do it like that, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better to use prayer pots and do multiple kills per trip
---
This would devalue my melee splashing only Ironman, I‚Äôm pretty sure I almost have lvl 2 Strength.
---
I too have been brainstorming ways to revitalize the wilderness, that'll have a lasting impact.
---
Wait but how did you drop three coins separate from eachother?
---
One of those antisocial coworkers
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, however I understood that the points per kill change if harder or more bosses are enabled but xp is not modified.
---
I use 5 easy bosses for both melee and range usually count, roald, me, snake, kendal.
---
Normal mode rumble with absorbs on range, repot and absorb up every 20 mins, sometimes rockcake to 1hp too to help absorbs last longer but not essential as that then takes longer to reset each 20 mins.. can be a pain if at work.
---
Melee I used the 5 bosses above either with guthans for easy 1 click reset for work or dharok with above absorb method for higher xp.
---
Use these when you play other games, just set a 20 min timer on phone and tab out to reset when needed.
---
Splashing is best for work as if you miss the 20 min mark due a call or something it doesn't matter
---
Please continue! One of my favourite things to watch on this sub :)
---
It was always phone or credit card.
---
So a bunch of us snuck into the school office during lunch time and spent about $200 on the phone for 4 accounts.
---
Alright, best of luck!
---
04 was a part of the gilded age for sure
---
I'm not seeing how they would lose any of the players.  If people got  tired of the servers they would just come back to OSRS proper.

that dog ugly, but yes he was a good boy, rip.
---
Depends on if you're trying to max afk or you're going to be actively paying attention.
---
Max AFK: full obby, obby sword, absorb pots, super combats (or overloads if you just wanna use points), normal mode
---
Hard mode gives more points, look into 1hp methods using rock cake or locator orb. Depending on your hp level, you can use dharok for more xp/hr
---
Calm down, Satan.
---
I just did it on my iron, if you have bloods and deaths to spare then leave the sweets and mage gear, if you need hp drop sharks and take off your armor while safespoting a melee dude. It's better to have those slots be more pray pots or sharks
---
The nice
---
70 prayer from 50 would be like 3.3 mil with Bloodveld heads and who knows how much time investment, so that's pretty unlikely to happen for a while. My cash stack is getting low from upgrades and I'll need death runes. I'm pretty close to the stats for mory hards. I'd just need 66 agility, which it probably 6 hours away.
---
Chances are that I'll take your advice and spam slayer tasks until I have the money for 70 prayer. It would be nice to have the longer times spent in slayer tasks, as well as access to mory hards.
---
i love raids art, your work is sick
---
Incorrect, the crystal crown cannot be alched.
---
Holy smokes
---
Well, to an extent, the point of area locked gameplay is that some content is unavailable and some skills are hard (or impossible) to train. In Zeah this isn't really an issue as we know, because it is very self contained. Also, leagues aren't really about making new content, but utilizing the existing one with some easily added modifiers
---
No flute salad and sea shanty 2 is number 7 yeah sorry to say this but you are just wrong. This is not even a matter of opinion it is just a fact
---
THIS. The game simply cannot be runescape until death mechanics are reverted, and ddos protection is implemented. 
---
Nobody wants to acknowledge that the original death mechanics were best version of them.
---
Metal dragons.
---
But you still need to play for ~2500 hours unless you play with alts

Damn, and 2.7m for the legs. I had no idea

How high are you man

Thanks for all of your comments and advice so far. I better take break from Jad for a while, it just haunts me. Maybe I try again someday with music and some booze to calm my mind.
---
Wow spoilers.
---
Just remember zulrah always moves from left to right and then back right to left. Keep up with her and pray switch first then attack. You will get it. I struggled alot at first too. You dont have to memorize the rotations just remember it always moves.

Having that god awful EoC HP bar?

Why would you clip it to include the name and then black it out

Hey, don‚Äôt phat shame them

Coming back to OSRS = not playing on those servers... That's losing players on those servers. Then those servers are a cost to the company.

38min solo at 347 kc lol gg super undeserved.

Ah you‚Äôre right. You still need it for minnows and the xp bonus does help leveling up later though. Unlike those stupid flared trousers which have been rotting in my POH ever since I completed that one step.

the fact he's been at this for 10 months is

Play how you want! Of course there will be much more unlocked with p2p, but maybe you should try it F2P first if you‚Äôre on the fence.

Fuck, you‚Äôll never solve this clue

13 of them is 2 many

I‚Äôll be paying attention. Using overloads and absorptions, mostly just wondering what bosses are the most efficient to choose.

Scales not made of steel.

Sometime during the train wreck that is RS3 they added 2 pitchforks. I think the regular one you could get for traveling to Botany Bay and the other was a golden pitchfork for participating in 10 or so Botany ban votings.
---
It's pretty good for us who enjoy training stats in a more afk way while doing other things, and don't want to be forced into doing tasks we don't enjoy (aka slayer)
---
Just wait till you do the quest where you have to boil your pet rock
