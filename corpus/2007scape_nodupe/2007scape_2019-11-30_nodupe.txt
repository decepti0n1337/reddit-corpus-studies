Pro tip just drop your easily replaceable stuff to save your clue.

Library wouldn't even come close to souls/bloods. I'd say even without harvester. As it's far more sustainable over a far longer time.
---
Well, 1, 5 and 7 are Jed.
---
I get your point though. Tbf, i personally think this screenshot is missing a ton of context.
---
don't do barb fishing.
---

---
Do drift net fishing, you get 99 hunter then finish 99 fishing with barb.
---
You get 75k fishing 100k hunter at normal rates, higher if you are proactive.
---
Oh wow that’s insane. I really did get lucky then. It’s wild you picked those two as your example, as those are 2/3 pets I happen to have, haha!
---

---
Have you seen defense pures?  The reason it’s not a thing is that you get the maximum strength level allowed for your bracket and the then train attack. 
---
The xp rates aren’t even that bad if you’re adding in cannoning organized crime in zeah.
---
This is a jmods personal account
---
&gt; Jmods and their clans merching based on insider info regarding updates and making billions and RWTing it - check
---
When did this happen and which Jmod did this?
---
Doesn't really affect bloods or souls as you can do that in main game never running out of energy provided your agility is like.. 75+ or something lowmlike that.
---
They’re trying to pick it up aren’t they?
---
You should be waaaaay past the need of a rune scim if you’re using Konar.
---
It's absolutely people trying the glitch, it's an open secret at this point. Everyone can find out how it works easily now, all a malicious person has to do is find a different way to crash the servers than what was just patched. I wouldn't be surprised if they went back to old-fashioned ddosing the worlds.
---
If I could sit in a business semi afk for a 150 hours in 2 weeks and be paid for it I would. Thing is that isn't how anything works.
---
Not worth it imo. Tried it the other day and it does take a while to set up (anywhere from 5 to even 15 minutes if you're unlucky) but that wouldn't be a real issue, if it wasn't for the fact that 1 single newb could (and WILL) come in at any time and mess up the synchronisation you set up so well. With all the time lost to setting stuff back up again and again, you could have long been gaining tons of xp had you been doing another method.
---
That's the most hooah shit I've seen in a while.
---
nope.avi
---
Library is 70k xp/hr on regular servers. It's still the highest xp you can get, but harvester would probably change that.
---
Still useful for fairy ring and getting to wildy from GE.
---
Eh they've mentioned having historical data and I really don't see how they couldn't keep the top 1000 in every skill, points, clues and total level. It's not exactly a huge amount of data and if they want any sort of longevity in these leagues they're gonna wanna offer something better than an ugly ass trophy.
---
What did he mean by this
---
This function would be great for RS3 with how many obnoxious pets it has.
---
Second
---
I wholeheartedly agree.
---
Yeh the first picture didn't load properly on mobile in the album until I clicked thru to it. Noticed that after.
---
Yeh couldn't see first pic at first. Seen now, Ty :)
---
This is 100% the reason. I trained up to 56(?) for regicide and haven’t touched it since. I personally don’t like Graceful so I didn’t feel the need to collect tokens for that (just sold all the ones I collected for the crystals or whatever for money). Except for the quest req I’ve found no reason for me to train it.
---
I am a bit confused about what point you are trying to make. Drop rates for pets are fixed percentages.
---
Now do it 5 more times. Jk good job man lol
---
I usually try to do that! Literally all i did was alt tab to paste it into paint. I do that so that in case i prnt screen something else accidentally i don't lose it. I was really quick too. Like 5 seconds tops. I alt tabbed right back and watched my dying animation. He must've logged in milliseconds before i switched lol. Unlucky but oh well :)
---
Where did European bh world go? It's wayy to hard to play on american ping.
---
Your luck sounds almost exactly like my brother's haha. But to be fair I'd only call the kq pet a boss pet. I have a handful of skilling pets that I got pretty lucky on. Farming I worked hard for doing pet patches only and got it at 42m XP. That was a happy moment
---
So October 2021?
---
Nice, what item is that even?
---
Nothing I said has anything to do with Alts?
---
I see you aren't willing to accept any opinion but your own, so I'll leave you to your pride.
---
I don't want to be that guy but the idea just wouldn't work in any meaningful way that adds progression to the game.  
---
Let's be honest,
---
This is nothing more than adding a search function to every object in the game and giving us xp in the process for doing so.  
---
  
---
here is what would happen with this skill;  
---
1. Skill releases, everyone is walking around for a day or two searching everything (or 'foraging').
---
2. Most people get bored because walking around randomly clicking on things.
---
3. People find the best xp training methods and the entire skill revolves around standing in a bank clicking an item in your inventory or standing in front of an object, clicking it. Next thing you know, it's not uncommon for people to just be groping trees, fences, bushes and shit.
---
4. Runescape will legit look stupid with random characters everywhere just fondling inanimate objects
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We should have a skill but this isn't even a skill suggestion, it's a "let's add another option to the right click menu for no reason but to give rewards and xp for it because mobile gaming practices are exactly what we need".
---
If you have 84 slayer I’d recommend training on it but not waking it up if that makes sense
---
F
---
should be an ultimate
---
Chance of hitting a max hit is 1/max hit. He is not taking accuracy into account, defence doesn't affect how often you get a max hit only how often you hit.
---
Man, this is so wholesome.
---
"how rare is this"
---
With the clue relic, you get them at a drop rate of 1/10 and they stack so you could camp
---
Hellhounds for a few hours and have hundreds of Hard clues. All which have the lowest step required and low requirements due to only bening in Zeah. 
---
This disables all Sherlock clues and most Emote clues which are otherwise harder to complete... 
---
Yeah... clues on TL are crazy easy to do.
---
Lol
---
What the fuck are you talking about? He’s angry because he got muted not because people were attacking his mobs you tardo
---
But in an iron man who cares, neither will be his best gear
---
Ehm, he has this screenshot though..
---
Staff gonna be worth a 100m at least and orbs prob 500m+. Who is gonna risk that.
---
Tbh even having a cat out is better than having any of the pets. Pets do nothing. Cats give you runes
---
This is what they mean when they call gamers AnCaps
---
It’s entirely the Jmods fault for abusing his powers and punishing someone for a non-punishable offends.
---
FTFY

Should’ve had a drop party
---
Which verse is this out of the book of scape?
---
Good to hear! Enjoy
---
Grats man! Currently the same pet I'm going for, I did I think ~6 kills without Arclight then decided to go and quest so I could have it. Boyyyy does it make a difference for the eye tower things that spawn.
---
2 steps, in case they have a halberd.
---
im about to join the army just to have friends to congradulate me on this shit.. i'v sacrificed it all
---
I got two hards in a row worth less than 40k :(
---
u/JagexHusky why are you being an asshole mate?
---
Get 200m all, then all pets, then get soeedrun records on all bosses. This should keep you busy for a few weeks.
---
Oh, and try to minimize the client as much as possible to not have major frames drops
---
If the crasher could get more kills per hour would it be griefing?
---
It’s not even hard to train at all lmao.
---
Beautiful I love the internet.  The fact that this exists. Thanks
---
I've been using mage long from clue, and I felt the maple short was better
---
Also; you saying ballista/surge double maul &gt;= staff maul is the equivalent of saying dds maul &gt; ags maul because dds has higher total potential damage; despite that almost never being the case. 
---
You sure are something
---
GREETINGS FROM NEIGHBOUR LATVIA MATE
---
Well the flipside is that we won't be disappointed by shallow cashgrabs. Jagex knows that new skills are some of the biggest content to get memberships out of older players, so they pull a cheap one like divination. And never is a long time, all the polls need is a well thought out dev blog, maybe a video, and content creator support.
---
Yes but no. For your rates you need a shitload of slayer points I just don't have yet.
---
That awkward moment when you breakup with your RuneScape grillfriend and then you hear you uncle crying from the other room
---
No I mean the hunting / having to actively move around part. It's why I think Herbiboar is trash as well. 
---
Even the incredibly slight variations on chinchompas are annoying. My hunter is only 83 and I've done it purely through birdhouses because they are static.  Mining is even okay because even though you have to move around, the route you work is static. 
---
I prefer Artisan / bank standing skills in general though, so I doubt we'll ever agree on a gathering skill that we both like. You seem to want to increase the amount of attention I have to spend to skill. I want the exact opposite.
---
Chompy chick is the cutest pet in the game and I won't stand for this slander
---
I’m new to construction. What did you use to grind? Oak larders make me press 2 and 1
---
Damn dude. Better sue him and take his fake internet points back
---
get a 99
---
i mean ive personally seen people in my clan get corp raggers banned
---
Husky was warned this would happen in TL due to everybody being an ironman, he literally said ‘nah i dont see it happening’
---
Tagging a monster isnt griefing. Tagging every monster isn’t griefing, Jagex has been very very clear on this. 
---
If they had hopped worlds and one had followed the other - that is a reportable offence.
---
Ok then shut up and enjoy your current username.  An easy solution is available already and you're too stubborn to use it. No one's problem but your own.
---
&gt;Discussion
---
Get real lmao
---
Hmmm. I know. Hmmmmmm
---
Nice.
---
lol.
---
I just did mine and SoTE last week! Such a good feeling
---
I was also getting like 49k mining xp/h and 67k crafting which got me to 92 mining and 95 crafting by the end which was pretty nice
---
They aren’t worth much, but they’ll be worth something soon lol
---
I could see why you would think that, because that's how content has been in the past. What separates Foraging from all the rest is procedural generation. When a player forages a resource in one area, it could respawn in another area as a completely different resource. The landscape would be constantly shifting along with the best place to find items. This encourages covering new ground and makes the strategy of going in a straight line from A to B inefficient.
---
No, stick with shortbows they are always better dps. They are 2 ticks faster and have the same stats as longbows.
---
I love this content, please continue this. I think it would work well in the format of a YouTube video too
---
The employee was fired 2 years ago according to legal documents from September. The most worrying to me is how hard Jagex is fighting against him, they even appealed the court decision. Not only did the court find him unlawfully terminated, but it found that HR (inc. Osborne) treated him unfairly in their discussions prior (but after the incident).
---
Hmm or how about the staff has an attack requirement.  Like staves do.
---
Are the same guy that said that the staff wasn't OP in the wild because nobody would risk BIS? if you seriously think people aren't gonna risk an occult you're ignorant
---
I agree. Doing this the first time really is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. People will have the meta down for the next league, being part of the discovery process here is amazing.
---
What do you enjoy more Skilling or PVM?
---
What’s a “dnb” head? Like what’s that stand for?
---
Drum'n'Bass
---
Not even an open secret, it’s completely public since Rendi spit the dummy because the the dupers didn’t give him his cut
---
Drum n bass leell
---
Ahh okay, so is there vocals in it as well? Or is it literally just drums and bass?
---
Some people just want to skill until they get to the most AFK training method like redwoods, bird houses, or ameythst mining and then watch netflix to 99. We all have our own playstyle and thats ok. I think the thing that separates Foraging from other "active" skills is what you're paying attention to. An active fishing method like aerial or barbarian has you constantly dropping things and managing things in your inventory. Foraging takes you outside your inventory into the world itself, as you constantly adjust your approach to where your gathering and how you gather it.
---
If no actions are logged on release how would the game know where you're trying to move an item in your inventory to?
---
All he’s been doing lately is feeding into drama on twitter
---
But agility and rc are easier to grind. Changing gear and zone constantly I can't get into the grind, that's why I hate slayer
---

---
Yes. It's refreshing to actually hear someone say arborist. Most ppl don't even know what that is. Thank you sir.
---
[Here sweetheart](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dfnku/why_are_comment_scores_hidden/) let me help you
---
Got me.  Dammit.
---
Obviously not... if you are sending messages TO someone and getting them FROM them, they are obv not the same person...
---
Hahaha, I respect that.
---
How do they have that league icon next to their name? For me it just has the regular ironman symbol still
---
I've actually been an arborist for a while as well. Boss doesn't quite trust me to climb yet which is fine considering most of our work is done in a lift. He does however trust my ability to drop trees and do proper hinges. He tops the trees and I drop them.
---
I dont even think name changes should coat a bond. There should be a cool down on it of course, but having it cost 6m to just change your name is crazy to me
---
group ironman defeats the purpose of being a ironman lol the fuck
---
Nah. 3a isnt the same chance. A specific gilded piece is as rare as getting any 3a. However getting any gilded piece is 12x more likely than 3a i believe. So if he was 12x luckier, he could have got 3a or 144x luckier, could have been double 3a.
---
I had multiple mental breakdowns getting to 77 in the main game. This is nuts.
---
Just make the max hit scale with magic level...
---
Prices will drop over time.
---
castle wars pls
---
Pretty much my grandma's alzheimers
---
I’d say agility is by far the most boring skill to train, only Runecrafting comes close.
---
what? i could literally do that right now. Just means two accounts from two unique spots are running.
---
Uh, I think I was misinformed about the army....I wanna join
---
played him like a fiddle
---
How do you get the iron man symbol on your reddit?
---
Is this a part of Lizard Shaman drops? cause i remember some video talking about bots there and that they tried to get them.
---
Grinding Gear Games creator of Path of Exile, the "best" free ARPG.

Oh god.

---
Lol bet you can't sleep with all that adrenaline now
---
Anyone seen my cat lately?
---
Damn, you can actually get your brain off of thinking about trees? I hear chainsaws in my dreams and every tree I see I'm thinking about how I'd drop it.
---
Here, I did it too: Kjadfhgalkjshdhgsfakiljhagkjasgdhjklsdghjkags
---
You look like Freddie Mercury
---
they didnt have bots scouting every inch of the wild and informing them with detailed information on the loot they carry.
---
you have a backpack with an undead chicken a dragon head and a magnet in it and you want a quiver?
---
That's creepy 😳 who is it stalking
---
Hmm, I think it would be interesting to have more reason to explore the very unique world that Jagex has created, so again I would probably vote for this skill if it was polled. 
---
Thanks for the more detailed explanation of how the skill would progress!
---
QUESTS!
---
&gt; things like attacking corp one time, or an irons monster one time strictly to deny loot has been something people have gotten banned for.
---
This is an untrue statement the only way to get banned for this is in the main game and if it is continual harassment not a one time thing.
---
!qp
---
oopsie woopsie I made a fucky wucky with my bots, I will get them fixed asap, just making some alts for bh farming since Jagex was so kind to implement a new money methods for bots.
---
It’s definitely not an issue for me at all.  I play on a tiny phone and can see everything perfectly because the quality is quite high.
---
yeah at the beginning more people would play it since the items prices rise up because it's not getting 24/7 farmed by botters. When it's crowded by normal people the items will drop again and it will be dead content, sorry i mean it is already dead content since botters have been removed. So what you guys get now from complaining about it? You can't even get points in LMS now since nobody is playing competitiv anymore and like 10 ppl no matter which time play casual. I rather play a minigame with botters but  3-4 players instead of waiting hours for a round to start. And how tf do these botters harm you? Do they take away your skilling spot? No they don't, they sell it for real cash so you guys must be jealous of pixel or irl cash or just dumb when you complain about LMS, if you would play LMS activly you would know when the botters aren't there the players also disappear since the rounds don't start. Only noobs or idiots do LMS for cash since there are at least 100 better cash methodes existing in this game. Most of the player played it for fun/halos nothing else and you can't get both anymore.
---
Which quests in particular?
---
Lets find his fucking account and grief the shit out of him.  Fuck him
---
Lmao at the communism xD
---
I had nearly 2.2k total before my first pet, and that was with thousands of pvm boss kills on top of that
---
I really wish the Jagex upper management gave even a fraction of the shits the Jmods give about this fantastic game. It's so weird to see the disparity between how much the mods we see on the couch every week care about the game, and how much the cocaine snorting, wrongfully terminating, costumer service undervaluing executives care.
---
Mostly just find the optimal quest efficiency guide on the wiki and follow it
---
If youre a main I suggest finding a money maker that you like more than dragons, and/or makes more gp/hr. Do that for a little while instead. It'll either feel like it's going by faster, or actually go by faster, or both. Win-win-win. That's basically all normie-man-mode is.
---
If that doesn't sound appealing to you, welcome to the reason I play ironman .
---
A friend's twisted league series is actually interesting and feels like his old hc Ironman videos. I like it
---
Alch then? They wouldn’t sell for more than their alch value anyways if they were tradable.
---
ur supposed to mage iron drags just fyi. 
---
but yeah, iron/steel drags are considered one of the worst tasks to do
---
Who hurt you
---
Inb4 "you cannot appeal this ban"
---
If people can run an auto clicker exactly every 1.5 seconds for 6 hours on end to high alch to 99 and not get banned you're probably fine.

---
\&gt;You’re useless when it comes to discussions because no matter what you refuse to see things from the other persons perspective and can’t grasp the basic concepts that they are portraying because you’re blinded by your almost religious stance on the matter.
---
Literally my response to the top comment (first one you would have seen upon entering this thread) is "hmm that's a fair point".  Seems like I'm not the one who's blind mater.  Literally everyone I'm rude to in this thread is being disingenuous - I'm under no imperative to be polite to someone who literally isn't being honest with me, and I'm not going to treat their opinion as actual if it's factually wrong.  When a guy tells me 1 strength pures exist and I'm just cherry picking, and he finds 0 pictures and I find 4, then why would I see things from his perspective?  We'd both be wrong.
---
\&gt;And the cherry on the cake is that you come off as a real arrogant asshole trying to toot his own horn, but who is actually just shooting himself in the foot in the process.
---
Having no patience for disigenuous spike TV shats doesn't mean I'm "tooting my own" anything.  If your opinion is honest and intelligible, I'm polite.  If it's not, I'm not.  That's not that hard to understand.
---
\&gt;Because of that you result to doing things like this to try make yourself feel better but in the long run it’ll make you feel worse.
---
I've got a pretty good record actually, I think of the issues I lobbied for about 80% end up going my way.  Your whole "I'm sure you're miserable" strawman doesn't work too well when my tactics work.  It's almost like being right is more important than being civil to people blatantly lying. Like yourself.
---
As for the current issue, even with the nerf they've already added to the staff, I doubt it will pass in current form, but we shall see.  At this point, I don't think it's gamebreaking, just stupid, so I'll vote no as will many others, unless Jagex change things further.  If Jagex doesn't change it further and it passes, I'll be dissapointed, but I'll know that I'd have done my best to argue my point.  
---
It's a big game, and not everyone sees things my way, so no matter how hard I try people are going to have different opinions than me.  And sometimes that means things pass that I don't want.  And that's ok, because that's how democracy works.  I don't have to convince everyone, and I sure as hell don't have to tolerate people who lie through their teeth.
---
\&gt; I’m sure your personal life isn’t quite what you want it to be, 
---
Some advice for you since your post is mostly projection - no one's life is everything they want it to be.  If it was, they'd just want more.  Just learn to enjoy what you have and improve what you don't.  Channeling your resentment into projective comments on reddit is neither of those things.  Commenting on porn on reddit is also probably self-toxic in the long term, but you do you.
---
Hydra
---
I never said anything about how often you have to do it. I said that the single tag to deny loot is not okay. We both know jagex is horribly inconsistent with banning for griefing, theres definitely some risk. It does happen.
---
If it makes you feel better I’m in the same boat except I got kraken at 4366 kc
---
The best answer your going to get is nobody knows, like another comment said try to message a Mod and see if they can better answer your question.
---
Wildy slayer is better for points
---
&gt;	The content that they bribed us with made it into the game even without the skill. 
---
This was the first thing I thought of when Farming contracts came with the guild. Assigned skilling tasks are enjoyable short-term objectives and that was supposed to be the winning goal of Artisan. We don’t need OP gear and items from a “skiller’s Slayer”. That’s where the skills come in lol. But farming contracts are great because the reward is supplies that assist in the skill being applied! It’s a great cycle imo and really wish Artisan was focused more on that.
---
Proud of u &lt;3
---
Can confirm, I voted yes for my f2p brothers but that was my exact thought, “do I really want more trash items?”
---
Follow them and find out
---
I agree. I find that too many people use the latter, and things like “don’t like it, don’t use it” which I feel doesn’t add any value to discussions
---
Let's fucking go, dude! Gratz! :D
---
Pest Control
---
yeah, but he's the one claiming it's Husky's account. Do we actually know that it is?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it was true, but Fraser is the single biggest cockwomble in all of RS so unless we have some kind of evidence it's him I'll be taking this with 15 pounds of salt
---
I understand it looks like this but my brother genuinely gave it to me. I don’t really know how to prove it but I don’t have the money to buy an account, so take it how you will I guess.
---
It took me 3 trips with base 80s
---
I think they dropped it doing recruitment drive, it was like 500k-ish
---
More things should be untradeable to bolster account progression. It's what this game is about.
---
Play mobile in the bath
---
Both 99 cooking videos had 99 slayer today
---
Slayer! Also, working on diary's will help flesh out your account since it will give you goals to work towards such as quests and skill reqs. Personally I enjoy becoming stronger in combat so I like to level my combat skills with slayer and then do money making methods to save up for gear upgrades.
---
A solid goal (imo) would be to work towards a fire cape!
---
Part of the reason is that ironmen can drop trade stuff over. Certain shops would be a good source of main income if ironmen didn't have to compete. It'd be interesting to see a solution to that problem come up, but at this point shop competition affects iron xp rates and the community would. probably get salty.
---
You either get it or you don't
---
The farming guild has a cat sleeping in its gazebo, but we can't put a pet inside a gazebo in a poh. Thought it could be cool if we could give the gazebo the "pet basket" interaction.
---
Now you can finally play the game

You should've downloaded The Republic instead
---
You cant boost with wildy slayer, they're tracked separately to normal slayer tasks.

Tier 5 Shayzien armor is supposed to completely protect from the blob attacks from the shamans. But instead, he's taking 1's.
---
Yup. Saw the pizza place next door get theirs cleaned. Disgusting process that involves disassembling the unit and spraying chemicals that break down the char and carry it away after scrubbing the parts.
---
I dont believe any pizza place could afford the physical labor it would require to steel wool every part.
---
&gt;  location locked
---
Hopefully next one isn't also location locked, or it's multiple locations, because Zeah has literally everything. It's almost like an alternate gillenor, anything else would be boring and dead content with not much to do in comparison.
---
Yeah this is kind of hard to understand. I do think non mems is not really worth playing though. And I don't think it would be hard to find a better game than f2p osrs, so could concider dif games for those 2 weeks? Or if you really want it maybe buy a little less weed or something.

Think about it this way, the higher the combat level, the more it gives slayer exp. I would stsrt with hill giants, move to moss giants, then maybe couple of bloodvelds or sulphur lizards. After 62 you can do wyrms and so on.
---
I think the key here is to do variety of tasks, that way you won't get bored.
---
Best points is Hill Giants.
---
20 attack and 20 strength. And same damage as godsword. Sounds fair to me.
---
What's the point of adding new items it they aren't worth using
---
I never said that.
---
I think people alchd stuff like yew longbows. Not sure what was the first. If you mean the very first gp, not really sure.
---
Every monster drops some kind of coins / alchable item. Over time it adds up.
---
My first three tasks went Cows&gt;Temple Spiders&gt;Undead Druids, so I feel you lol. Took me until lvl 43 prayer for the spiders and had to grind out 70 range for the druids. It’s what we get for not having Unnatural Selection.
---
I haven't done this but I fat thumb when clicking the orbs and run across the map on a daily basis
---
Void costs 5k?
---
Fair enough, I understood it, but he then immediately deletes his account. And he does make a point, but to make a whole post and complain about it, rather than try to solve the issue is just strange to me is all
---
Good thing rng isn't transitive.
---
&gt;I was against it when it was polled, and would really have much rather been in favor of something that facilitated more face to face trades.
---
I mean, that was what existed when it was polled. The trading post. Where you had to add players, hope they were online, then hop to their world/bank of their choosing, hope they didn't change the price, hope they had enough of the item you needed or were willing to sell small portions if you needed less, etc. 
---
All the trading post did was make the average player spend way more of their gameplay not actually playing the game.
---
The face to face interaction that was offered was essentially just player-based grand exchange inputs, where they would list the item, you'd do +5% until they accepted, and click accept. Except instead of 3 clicks it took 20 minutes of active "gameplay".
---
I am mid 80s combat stats, and thx for the info.
---
If I do turael + konar method, for the 10th task is konar still better than duradel? Considering sometimes i will need to cancel the konar task because she can give a bad monster or bad location.
---
I hope I don't have long blonde hair and a midget hand
---
Why would that be good? This is also because back when DLongs were 100k it was near BIS and OSRS was in its infancy.
---
Saying that all her items are from me, this seems counterintuitive
---
I appreciate this my guy!!
---
Instead of picking flax and spinning, you can get like 3k-4k bowstring an hour through temple trekking. Much faster that way!
---
&gt; D longs are at alch value because they're now on many, many drop tables
---
And because they're severely outclassed by numerous items and aren't even BIS for 60 att pures.
---
YO THIS SHIT FUNNNY AS FUCK

Clue box.
---
Drains 1% Arceuus favor every time you fail.
---
Thank you, not too sure about YT video :/
---
I'm going to say this is probably risky. Is there anything you can do to make the click duration more natural?
---
As someone who played from 03'-06' and is just returning with a full time job and gf it has made my return to RS so much nicer.
---
I do miss the fun of going to Varrock and finding a good deal, but I dont have time for that anymore. I'd be more interested in an Ironman type mode/server that eliminates the GE for those that want that.
---
Were the worlds full or near full at the time?
---
Removing what?
---
Only thing I can think of is some kind of AHK script wizardry to automatically force a random duration on each depression, but idk how to write scripts and I've got a feeling it would be complicated af.
---
I wonder if it's a DOOP glitch 
---
uwu
---
My pk group lost an ags to the world getting hit off
---
5 bil + alone has been brought into the game by just the creation of accounts and the 25gp starting coins :)
---
two onyx is already very slightly rarer than this clue at 1 in 1,048,576.   
---
with an elite clue makes 1 in 78,643,200.   
---
add in pet and your looking at 1 in 314,572,800,000 if i did all my math right.   
---
That makes that drop 314,572 times rarer than this clue reward.
---
Lol I guess me opening and closing the app to quickly glitched me out. Sucks only being to play on mobile
---
direction?
---
The reason they cater to limited accounts that chose to be limited is because the community doesn't want it to be possible for a limited account to absolutely annihilate all other accounts around it's combat bracket.  
---
To be honest I think the spec staff that boosts special attack to 70+ shouldn't be allowed in game because we're getting dangerously close to turning pvp into an entirely RNG based competition we're any player can just about one hit any other player regardless of skill. This latest spec weapon would only make things worse. That's just my opinion, everyone is entitled to their own of course.
---
damn that sucks :/

Rip granma! It's okay, you're dead now!

If you're gonna be using it often it will net you way more than any amount the price will fall over a few months
---
its a good idea until you realize its an unnecessary buff to runecrafting xp.
---
People still buy the skill
---
Just instead they have to stand around and waste literal hours of time trying to find a buyer. That's not good gameplay
---
Not to mention the rampant scamming.
---
People don't stop buying skills becuz there's no ge, it just makes it worst for the average player.
---
Joel get on skype
---
Same, I would hate ruining the probability of a rare item in the main game by getting the item in twisted league. 3rd age are like 1/10000 so I can't imagine how low the chance becomes once you have found one :D
---
Mining has enough variety and incentives with mlm, blast mine, volcanic mine and zalcano. 
---
They need to give other skills the same treatment that they gave mining.
---
Damnn. This meme is everywhere. I've seen people post it for a year in chat of black ops 4 blackout PC

Pretty lucky with clues somehow, got 3 pairs of rangers in like 90 meds which made a big part of it
---
damn and I thought you /u/JagexHusky were cool..
---
On it.
---
Getting a pet or whatever on TL doesn't mean you'd have gotten one in the maingame, but that doesn't make it less demotivating to get one you're still grinding in there.
---
I agree, massively increased energy regen, useful shortcuts for farm runs and bossing, the ability to kill zilyana, the gear set that's bis for everything that isn't combat(and sometimes combat), and the amylase crystals used for one of the most consumed potions in the game can't even be considered a real reward. If only agility was as useful as other skills like firemaking or woodcutting.

That's better, you pleb.
---
Have the Jmods ever issued a smackdown during a weekend? Just curious since they are not at work for a couple of days.
---
No I made it
---
There’s logic to higher tier gear, of which gives higher accuracy (Xerician robes, mystics, Ahrims, Armadyl) or str/damage bonuses (Obsidian, Bandos, Ancestral), having suitable defense reqs. 
---
Suggesting otherwise is saying that anything that provides greater accuracy/str shouldn’t be linked to defense. 
---
The defense skill and actual defense bonuses are not the same. The defense SKILL gives access to better worn equipment. 
---
To say otherwise is literally retarded. Go play a private server
---
No one here understands that.  I look forward to the 3 weeks of ok videos before the inevitable nerf

I agree that I was wrong and I did apologise, sorry if that wasn't clear.
---
It was never a matter of being unprofessional, I don't want to be professional when on my personal account which is what I was trying to get across. I currently struggling to separate the two and I am trying to do that.
---
I don’t want him to do anything I was pointing out to the guy above that his comment was queer
---
All of that equipment gives greater defence bonuses than lower defence gear, so that does make sense for then. This gear has the defensive stats of mithril. So it does not make sense. Torso matches the band's chest plate in at, had far lower defence bonuses and rightfully requires a lower defense level.
---
Fremenik kilt and manacles don't have a Def requirement, have crap defense bonuses, yet match migh higher Def equipment's str bonuses
---
The 70 str requirement actually is quite fitting here, if anything they should give it an attack requirement instead since it provides high crush bonuses
---
So yes, greater accuracy and str shouldn't be intrinsicaly linked to defence, in the same way greater defence gear shouldn't be intrinsically linked to ark/str/w.e.
---
Detect what exactly? This isn't a bottling offence.

It's nice having some items not tradable as if you die them you'll keep it (excluding wildy) and Digsite specifically for rune dragons.

Best bet probably alch them and not make so many in future lol. And if you are a main account you can mount one in your POH and not need to make anymore.

Yeah if you could not fuck the memes up that would be great.

Its too long for that imo

Never heard of gargoyles?

Yep. There is no separation between j mod and normal player when within the game. Dude should have his j mod status deactivated if he’s that thin skinned and quick to pull the trigger. Also should have all his mutes/bans looked into and reviewed.

Player moderators are players first, they are in the role as volunteers and can request to have it removed at any time. The only difference between Jagex staff and regular players in this situation is that Jagex employees can request player moderator status for their own account, but the "responsibilities" and procedures around it are the same for both.
---
Luckily I don't waste my time on this game anymore. The thought of getting banned without any chance of support and still paying $11 for it...

I do waste time on this sub though. You people are funny.

---
It's the little waddle! I have three other "real" pets (orphan, rocky, and heron) but the chompy chick is the one that follows me everywhere.

They’ve made it that way. Also why should an armor that is offensively better than BIS be made available to players with such low defence?
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.

Once I was cleaning pans facing away from the oven and the owner said "I'll spray this thing while it's still hot it might make some fumes. I heard a lot of spraying and sizzling fluids and suddenly my lungs felt like they were burning from the inside. I felt like I was about to die. I run out and had a 15 minute coughing fit where I felt I was dying. Turned out fine though. Weird thing is the owener seemed unphased by the chemical fumes.

Can confirm. I barrage in prossy with d boots and defender on my uim and have 0 issues. I only have to bust out wizard boots and ancient book for smoke devils.
---
I’ll take your downvote and leave.  I think you are trolling at this point.  Go back to /u/SendMeBuhTitsPlease and read his comment one more time.  It’s extremely constructive and could be very beneficial for you as a person.
---
I think the main difference though, is that if there was no ironman mode applied, then the guy not chinning could attack one while the other guy is multi targeting. And he can try and do more than half damage to secure the kill for himself.
---
Since he's iron, he probably was just tagging them to invalidate the target for everyone.
---
Unless you’re using ancestral. Cause that not only gives accuracy, but damage increase
---
wait for it to be useless for the nightmare of ashihama and then when the bosses rewards release into the game, the elysian will tank 200-300M when everyone dumps it. Then rinse repeat for merchers

Low lvl glass cannon accounts usually have 1 or low pray which makes them susceptible to losing their +1

As someone who did develop bots for my own use, yes. When I started out I had a few things i ran into, even tho mouse position and interval between clicks were different the time the button was pressed down was always the same, it results in a ban. So I imagine if you play legit random click positions and intervals but the button down pressed exact same time always will get you banned for suspension of using macro tools.
---
What about paid instanced versions? Like a public version for all then a paid version where you either get your own or a second can come in? Not sure how the farm works but it seems like you want 2 people in there? Would you do a small fee for an instanced version almost like how you can pay for blast furnace to be run by npcs?
---
Yes please!!!!!
---
From my testing the spec does scale with level now (I think they hotfixed it), from hitting ~55 with occult and ma2 cloak at 75 magic to 73  with same gear at 99 magic, which while still strong is much better now
---
Go after updates
---
Yeah you dont have to use an offensive prayer at all because it doesnt increase your damage at all. Their defences are low enough to wear prossy and burst without any extra accuracy.
---
Hmm

Honestly it's shit like this that got me to just quit paying for membership. If I do have it, it's via bonds.  Not gonna pay money to a company that apparently doesn't give two shits about customer service, but still wants me to be a paying customer? When they treat customers like this?

It's absolutely not worth using for anything other than GWD boss healing on minions. For slayer, use dds or claws for special attack and bank if you need to restock on food/ppots. Guthans is a noob trap

I would love this or maybe make it settable so you can set it to x or all or 1 then you also can set your left click (maybe settable by shift clicking on the 1,5,10,x ext )

Ban code is a “pin” for your bank! It will keep your items safe if you get hacked. I suggest setting one up! If you don’t want random messages from random players set your “Private” to “Friends” that way only people you’ve added will be able to message you/see you’re online. Good luck &amp; have fun

I don't play anymore, just occasionally hop on to skim through my bank and look at my shit for nostalgia. This is fucking retarded, and honestly just perpetuates more botting. Why the fuck would anyone of you give a shit to dump thousands of more hours into the game when they so readily ban you just for being in the same breath as people planning to manipulate the game?
---
All this will do is ensure that if this ever happens again, people will shut the fuck up and take their free money and let Jagex fumble fuck around to pick up the peices.

Yes
---
If you plan on doing a lot of pvm, getting construction to 82-87 for ornate pool is always a good move. Rigour really pays for itself though, so I wouldn't put that off too long. Apart from that, BIS rings and ammies is a good start, assuming you already have good weapons like whip, tbp, trident. I wouldn't worry about BIS armor or boots for now.

Two of my alts were falsely banned for botting on Thursday. I used one to make money by buying/selling to npcs and the ge. I played on both desktop and mobile on that account since it saves a click on mobile. That account had over 16m in it which was a lot to me since I’m pretty noob. I was afk woodcutting, mining, and smithing on my other two alts (because I wanted to train my three alts up to 750total skill). Those two were on desktop. One of those was banned while the other wasn’t for some reason. To be fair, those two did look like bots because I was playing on all four accounts at the same time (main was afk combat) and had to afk walk to and from the mines. However, if a person actually reviewed the actions, they could see that a person was actually playing on them. I took breaks to eat, shower, etc. 
---
I’ll probably quit now even though my main wasn’t banned. Even if my alts somehow get unbanned, I’ll probably be falsely banned again with the money making method (over 1m an hour on mobile which is way better than the other methods with my stats). Part of the excitement for me is finding obscure money making methods so this takes a lot of the fun out for me. It’s also funny because I was competing against actual bots. You can tell by the names and they all wore the same items. I think this is all for the better though since I had an unhealthy obsession with the game. I glad I never spent a single cent on the game. 
---
I wish you luck in getting your account back brother.
---
Whoa there, Brohan, my bad for misremembering.   My first comment is still correct even though my second had some incorrect math (fixed now).

---
I was banned for something unrelated. I’m sorry to cause public outcry
---
Is the torture really that  good? I like the defensive bonuses of the fury
---
It’s also directly related to the same set of bans.
---
Sauce? Wanna read through the comments lol
---
Zeah favor is Aids but I dont think it makes all of league bad.
---
No problem
---
Idk man farming is kinda low. Would work on that first
---
Gonna start imbuing some rings
---
You can plant and hop you don't have to wait for em to die my guy
---
This has been suggested before, the idea quickly died, but still this would be amazing
---
Okay lol? Pretty sure they don’t work on Saturday’s and response time has no correlation to whether you’re innocent or not.
---
No one likes doing wildly bosses, particularly Vet’ion because he’s in multi combat. Ring is useful for literally anything prayer related, barrage tasks, god wars, saga, inferno
---
&gt;Guilty until proven innocent seems to be Jagex's motto here
---
The problem with this statement is there's literally an [example](https://mobile.twitter.com/JagexTyran/status/1200796929325707265?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) of someone knowingly breaking game rules and still asking for a justification.
---
I don't know what the goal is, to see how much Jagex knows about what they did?
---
*dags
---
That's a great start. Especially if you already have them, costs next to nothing.
---
There are times when bans are corrected.
---
amen to that
---
Go for quest/item related goals, not just levels. Barrows gloves should be your first big goal, then dragon slayer 2 for the upgraded accumulator, etc. fire cape and fighter torso also.
---
Do realize that the guy you're taking to said he's lvl 41 with 60 slayer. Deep down he knows that he doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
Bursting/barraging tasks in the cat as are sole of the highest xp/hr tasks. Bursting nechs is better gp/hr than meleeing nechs. Bursting there off task is never macro-efficient. If you do the typical bursting tasks in the catas you'll probably have enough totems for skotizo pet WELL before 99 slayer.
---
And I don't even think he meant bursting them. With his levels I'm betting he meant meleeing those mobs.
---
Some people who don't want to play at max efficiency may find bursting dusts to be a break even way to get fast magic xp and totems. Which it is. But off task barraging is least inefficient in the mm2 caves, and isn't even macro efficient for maxing. You can get the magic levels to burst on task with 0 time alching, and gp "should" never be a problem if you really care about maximizing your efficiency.
---
Organised crime and diary lamps
---
You can be grateful you dont really have to experience a situation like Venezuela first hand. I do however agree with your sentiment.
---
Someone who broke the rules was banned without an explanation. Did they deserve an explanation? Perhaps or perhaps not. But we should still be supportive of those requesting explanations, even if some of them turn out to be cheaters.
---
Thankfully the katana was cheap so it costed about 83m roughly due to the ankou pieces!

Platinum tokens

Coins come into the game mostly from alchemy, monster drops, and selling stuff to shops.

Congrats :) ppl seem to get jad pets at low kc. I assume if you have over 10kc of jad then the pet becomes unobtainable
---
I was wrong and you got silenced by the downvotes, rip, mob-mentality too strong.
---
I didn’t even have to turn in the cape, that’s what surprised me the most.
---
I've got 82. Don't really need the 0rnate box
---
He got the fire fire cape, the inferno cape
---
dag kings = just run in a circle really fast

And you have to post about it on Reddit for some attention...smh.

They are both different games. Play what you enjoy the most as both games are grindy.

Retoast
---
For what purpose?
---
Bea5: I used a cheat client to mass flood packets in an attempt to crash the server, why did you ban me?
---
Tyran: Because you used a cheat client to mass flood packets in an attempt to crash the server
---
Bea5: Right, sounds accurate
---
What is the point of this exchange? It seems to me that it only wastes time.
---
Tertiary drops mean they are dropped alongside normal loot. So for example when you kill a man, you might receive bones (primary drop), coins or a herb (secondary drop), and a clue scroll (tertiary drop). You might receive no secondary drops or no drops at all.

Maybe you should've tagged the arrows too so you'd know you shoot them

Mos eisley locked.
---
I ain’t complaining
---
Clearly. He didn't trade for his armor. He took materials to a quest master and got special armor
---
That doesn't help you, though, does it?
---
???????????
---
Mate did u not read what I said lmao, if the ban is because of the dupe then it's complete bs and absolutely deserves to be quashed
---
Not OP but It's possible for them to see if you have hardware (mouse/keyboard) or software input. Afaik they don't actually track it or use it to ban people otherwise your software &amp; mousekeys, etc. would be getting a lot of legit players banned.
---
its called "osrs soa"
---
I have the same in 400kc, but jar instead of pet.
---
lmao you right you right, but still man. I put so much time into the account, feels like a waste for it to just get banned out of nowhere y'know? Besides, I bought $100 worth of bonds, one time. I've seen so many posts about people spending thousands upon thousands on the game, over many years. I feel fine about that purchase :P
---
It’s the cc Soa
---
Xyborg is my friend and I’ve explained to him the exact reason why I was banned. Obviously, he knows exactly what I did and how I did it
---
"manually permed a steamer for a jmod watching to reverse" that's a very interesting opinion given that they specifically said he was AUTOMATICALLY permed, not manually, which was then reviewed by the mod team, the same thing that happens to ALL AUTOMATIC PERMS. the only difference was that the mod saw it happen live and was able to expedite the process. Not that I expect anyone on Reddit to actually present facts cause jagex looks way worse when you just make up nonsense
---
Multilog?
---
Are you fucking joking right now? I wish I could bury my head in the sand with your skills.
---
“I wouldn’t dupe because it’s immoral to crash the price of gold” hmm... if you cared about the game, why would your moral compass center at the price of RWT gold? Maybe try “I wouldn’t dupe because it’s immoral to ruin the game economy” next time. Might help out your victim narrative a bit more.
---
I think the only other thing of that style is the stupid karamjan rum from that one f2p quest.  Maybe also some quest items you're only supposed to have in instanced areas?  And yeah I imagine so.  For the quest items it doesn't matter too much since in most quest spaces randoms don't occur, but in the case of the Khaled artefacts its:
---
* Something you could do in large quantities
---
* Something that generates a lot of exp, increasing random event spawn rates
---
* Something that doesn't block randoms
---
Remind me! 1 day
---
What grandma man said... yea Ironman mode but it allows trading. You give them a few servers specific to them like TL and bam problem solved.
---
Agreed, the production quality is reasonable and it is impressive seeing what he's done in such a short span on the account.
---
RIP it’s gone. Let it go
---
The biggest gold dupe happened partially as a result of your macroing.
---
Guthans heals 25% of damage dealt. If you're in absolute max gear + guthans with max stats and divine potted your dps is 6.30 (infernal cape, prims, tort, ferocious, b ring, piety). Guthans heals 25% of damage dealt (average). That means you heal 6.30 * 0.25, or 1.58 health per second. To heal from 30 hp to 99 would take on average 43.67 seconds ASSUMING the gargoyles don't keep hitting you (which they do, so it's even longer).
---
Guthans is trash if you're paying attention. You can heal that damage in roughly 3 manta rays, it's not one heal = one bank at all. You have to bank like once every 5 times you'd use guthans. That's 1 bank trip vs 218 seconds of using guthans.
---
It's not even close, guthans is absolute trash if you don't weigh in the AFKness.
---
Or just have 3 times the kc for the drop rate
---
I like how they ban real players then I still see all the same bots around
---
I generally bring the explorer's ring for barrage tasks. The limiter on those isn't prayer points, but inventory space for loot.
---
Yes, I know picking up loot isn't EHP, but you blow through runes fast and I don't want a task I have extended to be a massive money drain.
---
awesome thanks!
---
So? You could have the client and the plugins but if you never used them you wouldn’t have been caught.
---
Cya
---
But it also makes more sense for skillcapes to be useful.
---
They say the cave starts at wave 50 so this was a zero time error don't worry

---
I mean it wasn't a chainban or anything I'm still free to play on my alts, I just don't like that jagex gets free reign to ban people for no reason at any time. Not costing me anything to post here, is it?
---
Why
---
Jagex has confirmed that everything on the RuneLite client is complaint with their 3rd party statement.
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/another-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1
---
&gt;We’ve added confirmation that RuneLite have fully complied with the rules within this statement.
---
Then perhaps they've should learn their lesson in adding dumb shit the community wants to cosmetics.
---
u
---
The pronoun being addressed was "they" implying that you two are cohorts. You may not be. But it reads like you might be. And when it comes to the bans that get appealed on reddit, the vast majority of them are liars and cheaters presenting just little enough information to appear innocent, knowing jagex won't provide public information to counter the BS stories.
---
If nobody heals the pyromancer nobody can get any experience at all.
---
it's a good show who cares
---
What is that thing.
---
Works fine on my Mac
---
Burgers
---
For the record, I do actually appreciate people who try to break the game and use throwaways to find holes in the engine. Its fascinating to me.
---
You’re not going to get it back because we know jagex. We can’t even say goodluck because we know, once jagex falsely bans, that’s it. You will beed proof you were NOT cheating and even if you did have proof, it won’t be uplifted
---
I only use 300 in TL and 40 of those are empty seed placeholders
---
They became fascist when they stopped slaughtering the rich to give to the poor, and started slaughtering minorities to distract from the fact that they're giving everything to the rich.

China is communist so probably won't cost too much
---
No it didn’t lol
---
I'm curious to see if this gets downvoted or not. But the ONE thing I miss about RS3, to this day, was the resting/sitting down to recharge run energy and the musicians. Even just the sit-down part would be fine. Everyone hates walking and even with high level agility you'd still need constant stamina pots to explore this game (thats around 77 herb for irons). I know it's EZscape but it's the one thing I miss about RS3.
---
So maybe something like this for high level agility? Or a sit funtion on the cape?
---
Well it's their game bud, not yours.
---
&gt;Yet the Americans with their national pride support the American government and are grateful that Donald Trump has fucked China and the rest of the world so hard to fill their own pockets.
---
While some Americans do support him you are crazy to think the majority do. The bigger problem is that none of these negatives generally affect the day to day lives of Americans and until it does you won't see people really giving a shit.
---
I frankly don't expect an unban, i know jagex better than to hope for that; I just want to know what the heck they thought I did to deserve a permanent ban for bug abuse of all things after a spotless record on a decade+ old account.
---
Nah dude it's totes because they associate with our lord and savior Rendi and Jagex is out to get them because they're evil
---
(/s)
---
Slain.
---
They would not simply ban you for being friend's with him. I suspect you know more than you're willing to fess.

There's 2 that I remember well and 1 that was a grey area. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/5wlhz3/a_friends_fletching_method_got_me_banned/  
---
There was someone who got macro majored for enchanting bolts or fletching with a touch screen, this was a big deal to the community because it was right before mobile was supposed to come out and people were wondering if playing on mobile would get them permed. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1q6igr/false_ban_just_because_i_was_hunting_for_most_of/  
---
Another time was close to launch, a lot of high level skillers were getting false perm bans for botting because of their efficient play, Lynx Titan was permed for this as well at one point.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/776m07/my_account_hardbuldge_was_permed_for_the_cerb/  
---
The one I mentioned was a grey area was a HCIM using a bug to fight Cerb, but similar bugs have long been known about and have been allowed. He was perm banned because they thought it was against the spirit of HCIM specifically to fight a boss that way and the ban was downgraded to two weeks.
---
Is anybody else high on weeeeeeeed
---
punchline in title boo

It’s called multi tasking or just straight up  botting.

How short sighted of me to log into the world they were going to crash and macro on it
---
Well thats funny becaus u took a pic of urself and photoshopped rune items on u an bein rich so wat now?
---
As I've previously stated, I don't start healing at no hp, roughly around 70 hp ill bust it out for a heal and then bam; back in my regular gear, sure it's possible to be unlucky, but if you'd rather go bank, by all means. The OP wanted to know if it was a decent investment, and for 2.3m I think it is, also even if you're unlucky, and it takes you a while to heal up, I'm assuming he's not going for EHP records.
---
Make the tokens only available for the same pet
---
at least the streams are on 7 second intervals now. before hand, it was near impossible to get the diary task!
---
I have spoken.
---
PSA: the mod tweet linked here is NOT in response to the OPs ban. It's a response to another player in this thread with a different ban reason.
---
Multiboxing actually.
---
"ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK." Do you make these yourself, cause it looks incredibly cool!
---
I was living a perfectly happy life not knowing that sentence existed. Why did you have to ruin my happiness?
---
Don’t post people’s names. Also there’s no evidence you didn’t crash him. No one gets pissed off at nothing. 
---
FYI, you’re breaking the subs rules so I’m reporting the post
---
Making a reddit post is the most logical thing to do if you’re banned and know there’s basically no chance of an unban. For the cheaters they might as well get more info for next time, it’s on Jagex to defend themselves without spilling the beans. I don’t really see why that makes you so salty, each side is doing what is most logical.
---
Dont cry about it on Reddit. You've abused game mechanics and hope you can slither your way out of the situation. Just own what you've done and man up.
---
same :/
---
nice
---
Lmao legit
---
Meanwhile the community eats it up and claims Jmods are evil and out to get everyone. 
---
Side note, my guess is he's not entirely unhappy to have the reason revealed because it provides information to his group of fellow bug abusers that "x" is detectable.
---
NO COLLUSION
---
Source?
---
Thats not what theyre suggesting.
---
But 5 is the regular farming tick amount, so I think you're misunderstanding the text
---
Gz on 99 hunter ya fucking loser
---
They have good customer support too
---
Fuck, OP is salt bae? I had no clue.
---
Melee and range hitting 80s - we sleep
---
Mage possibly getting a much needed upgrade? - real shit
---
Smh... what do you think that is...
---
SUWU!
---
Just before I get into this, you being 100% serious right? Because the client and the plugins are directly and officially approved by Jagex. Anything in the **standard** runelite client is legal in this game.
---
You get 3 copies of the same item.
---
You know theres a bank at the ge you could of put your stuff in. Also the items are invisible to other players for 1 minute that should be enought time to go the bank then pick your stuff up
---
The trashcan
---
This. 99.99% of all reddit posts about being wrongfully banned are correctly banned.
---
OP was correctly banned. Theres nothing to suggest he wasnt.
---
He draged me to another bank in varrock, the item appeared to him less than a minute, i thought i was smart but im really fucking dumb, nothing goes right for my in this year, even in a game xD
---
🔥
---
You can’t chin MM2 on pures (because you need to complete mm1) and you can only chin in MM1 tunnel if you haven’t completed MM1.
---
To use the tunnel in MM2, you can start chinning as soon as you unlock the area.
---
My opinion doesn't matter too much for this. But I would rather have spec weps keep their spec usage the same for PvE and PvP
---
I dont understand how people still get scammed in this game. If someone wants to just give you things they'd just give them to you... they wouldnt make you jump through hoops for it. If something sounds off it 100% is not a genuine person. The only logical thing to do when you think you can anti scam someone is to report them and leave them on your ignore list. If you're trying to anti scam you're no different than the scammer.
---
I do birdhouses but i dont yet have farm runs. What quests should i do?
---
Post a complaint everyday until Jagex looks into it
---
more like ruining the experience of new players
---
i don't think there's a makeover mage but you can build the things to do it in your poh bedroom
---
I know exactly what you're talking about because back in 06 when I would appeal offenses I would just write about how the gower twins loved fucking eachother in the butt for a couple paragraphs and then I'd get it appealed every single time. I know for a fact not a single mfer is lookin at that shit.
---
I think people just up vote it for the impending humiliation

He's at 2.4k currently lol he might hit that 5k Jagex reply threshold

Didn’t wanna use the sand casino?

Usually the competitive lms worlds are active, especially the p2p world as of lately

Robotic Process Automation on VDIs
---
Obviously this a scam at first sight, i took the bait perfect as fuckin dumb i am, lost a notebook to a scam in a real life and almost all my bank in game hahahah i deserve this shit seriously
---
Jagex likes to abuse the shit out of their power sometimes
---
Not as overused as the pic of something obviously rare with easily to Google odds and a title asking if something is rare. If anything the 50/50 response is the only one fitting for this kind of question.
---
I annoys me when people do this and in their next post 2 weeks later they claim jagex ignored them.
---
IIRC, when I did 96-99 in MM2 caves, it set me back about 12m. That being said, I did wipe once and lost a few K Chins.
---
Hey I've played some BA and did a few leeches with you maybe two months ago. Inb4 interface stalling is now bug abuse. Hope you get your account back.
---
Don’t post on a public forum if you don’t want public opinion. With all due respect, if you don’t want to be critiqued don’t put yourself up for it.
---
Clear cut case where you accepted you should be perm muted for whatever you said though. This user is asking for customer service and was banned, not muted, wanting a reply. Quite a lot of distinguishing factors imo.
---
thats bea5 he owned that ban after learning what for (it was unrelated to the dupe and didnt even work so he assumed it wasnt why)
---
I think they should just remove the uniqueness of each individual pet.
---
If someone wants to grind Corp Beast until they can fill their menagerie with twenty different Dark Cores, why shouldn't they be able to?
---
Yes, I am completely serious. I am well aware that there are approved plugins on the official client. That official client is also, open source and very very easy to add cheats to, and more players than you would think including players who don't even know how to code do write quite cheaty plugins that cannot be detected due to the nature of how many of the "QoL" approved plugins operate. I am not arguing whether the official client is approved by jagex or not, I am talking from the point of a developer who knows very well how the client works (the same as a bot client, but to an even higher level than a bot client in terms of reading information and modifications) and how deep that open source API goes.
---
Who in their right mind would grind reclaim tokens, are you expecting to die repeatedly with pets out?
---
I bet
---
Everyone enjoys different faucets of the game
---
Yeah it was starting to drive me insane lol
---
Very wholesome
---
Any update?
---
Some advice : train ~~nothing but runecrafting~~ combat stats. Your total level is on your skills page, your combat level is influenced by prayer, health, combat stats, etc
---
Anyways, have fun and get ready for the long road ahead!
---
I understand that being an iron man myself. But there is just not enough evidence in the pictures for me to make an informed opinion on what has occurred there. Not too sure if the friends list violated rule 5 by the way all I know is if someone’s being a dick in game, you’re not allowed to post their name to avoid mob mentality hounding of the person. But still, even for the same reason try blanking out your friends list for their sake in future.
---
&gt;Nothing is stopping people from downloading the client and using it.
---
thats a pretty shit argument.
---
&gt;makes vetting certain instances a little faster? 
---
as i said, someone in 150m gear with runelite will get around 25% more points an hour than someone in 3b gear in the vanilla client at raids.
---
&gt;The client doesn’t “massively” improve rewards and xp, it changes the xp rate for prayer, an extremely expensive skill
---
25-50% more xp per click/fewer actions is very massive.
---
&gt;It’s not like item prices started crashing after having instance maps lmao. 
---
we've never not had instance maps for raids.
---
&gt;Anyone who is more than a casual playing this game is usually going to use runelite, there aren’t many people doing raids on the official client.
---
But that's not what you are arguing, you are arguing it's fair because it's free. I can't tell if you are arguing the plugins are fair, or if you are arguing they arent fair plugins but it's okay because runelite is free. If runelite decided to switch to a subscription based model tomorrow, even if it was very inexpensive how would your opinion change?
---
This message is sponsored by my bad RNG only Ironman
---
Nice PK drop.
---
I’ve had 2 perms revoked by appeal so I would say it’s definitely worth a shot
---
In addition to what they are saying the many many people going for beyond 99 fm exp at todt like 200m exp, will end up with a pretty high con level never having trained it.
---
Ahh The Weekly Press, the most wholesome of wholesome reddit press
---
I wouldn't do it. I'll need the pyromancer's outfit for TL.
---
Black arms gang represent!
---
Some people dislike free untradeables I guess lol
---
If the guy is American they would just help him with a state assisted suicide. Cops are certainly the worst people to call for this.
---
i only meant that as jagex literally doesnt have a support team. you can appeal stuff and get lucky sure
---
Enable drop alerts in chat so you can do slayer. Some bosses are viable too.
---
Get stylus or something similiar. I got 1$ pen with stylus on other end. Works perfectly.
---
Wow, that's pretty intense! Hope everything is ok with he guy, in the meantime I can hold the T bow for you? I have plenty of bank space if you need it.
---
Just message me bro.  
---
All the best.
---
Look into your settings and change the drop notifications. You can set the drops to notify you for every drop over one GP. This sounds stupid but effectively your game chat log has the drop list, really useful because drops can be hard to see on mobile.
---
Start doing some Skilling. This will get you used to the interface. Over time you will be a bit more comfortable with the controls and can do some more PVM.
---
In each blank tab I would recommend keeping your most used items right near the top. Again this sounds dumb, but when you play on laptop you can see more items, so this way on mobile you don't need to scroll when you're getting your most frequent stuff.
---
yeah I like the one in rimmington u fill buckets with
---
What a twist!
---
Yeah I’ll try that way, thanks for all your help
---
It's actually 1/2,5k
---
UwU
---
They fixed it within 2-4 days according to rendi.
---
Floor? They are outside it's the fucking ground lmao
---
Oh fuck Woosh
---
He used the D word!!
---
Np! Gl man.
---
gz you king. Now you can start slayer
---
Honestly I’ve had more new f2p players lose their minds over a basic rune item. 
---
I remember back when I first started years ago some guy gave me a rune scim and I figured since “rune” was in the name of the game then it must be amazing. Made we want to grind just so I could be able to use it. 
---
If you’re ever bored buy some rune weapons and head over to lumbridge cows on a f2p world. Usually good for some pretty wholesome reactions and it’s a good way to help out a bunch of new players for pretty cheap.
---
It is, but you can tell this guy's missing a few screws.
---
Fuckin oof
---
I was wondering how would the  **Inquisitor's Mace** affect the price of the abysall bludgeon, should I sell my bludgeon in the near future assuming the price drops?
---
contracts. prior to that point i wouldnt really bother much with them, you dont have to get very many seeds to get to where you can access farming guild.
---
You’re very passive aggressive. I’d imagine your estimate is probably correct about people’s membership durations... but it’s neither here nor there to point to membership fee which if you’re grandfathered in at a price is certainly not the same as what you’re insinuating, I do not pay 100 dollars for a year of membership, not even close and with gp my iron man gets bonded. Paying for access isn’t want people are focusing on it’s the animosity to micro transactions playing a big part in the response. Given the nature of the time period the game is reverted back to and the desire to have things removed from Rs3, the concept of real world wealth giving you advantage in game is frowned upon. This was the go to stance back when Gower owned Jagex. No ones wallet should in anyway be able to effect their cash stack. This is a sore subject for a lot of the people loyal to the concepts this game was remade on, because it is legal real world trading.
---
I don't get it
---
if you submitted a bug report in game with as much detail as possible you did your job, those get manually reviewed.
---
first check to see if you bought rs3 bonds accidently. this happens all the time.
---
By jagex's own words: they do not.
---
Obviously they should but knowing their customer support is shit and doesn't function on the weekends, you shouldnt post expecting a reply.
---
yea I completed it passively.
---
good thing i wasn't in a secret bug abuse discord chat then lol why do none of you people read
---
For twisted league, what is the best method for raising construction? Guessing oaks in the guild but what about banking for planks and getting back to poh?
---
I don’t know too much about it, but I believe they try and get people into a certain house because you can actually tip someone for using their house. I usually tip 10k when I use someone’s house for prayer they might just try to get people in to make more and make having your house open profitable. I know there are other people advertising clans that help bring you supplies also
---
I appreciate you, /u/Dipshit-Kun
---
yeah i dont know what to tell you, with low skills its going to be hard even without f2p just because so many people try to do the same sort of thing.
---
even in members anything below about level 40 content (ie gem rocks and eclectic implings) isnt going to net very much
---
No the max xp with all possible relic boosts is like 6 m/hr
---
I’d spunk on his helmet
---
Finally a decent suggestion
---
Go to the Ardy monastery. Easy beads.
---
Better dps &gt; better defense almost always
---
Police aren't trained properly for suicidal people. A psychologist or someone specifically trained for these situations should always respond with police, but sadly nobody cares to much on mental health.
---
Hell yeah bloodz am I right?
---
Rich boys ftw! Fuck peasants
---
&gt;that’s a pretty shit argument
---
Yet you have nothing beyond saying it’s shit to disprove it. How is it bad? It’s pretty easily found if you look anywhere for another client.
---
&gt;	25-50% more xp per click/fewer actions is very massive.
---
But there’s no **real** difference it makes, how is it unfair to other players? It doesn’t disrupt the economy or anything other than speeding up throwing money at the altar lmao.
---
&gt;	as i said, someone in 150m gear with runelite will get around 25% more points an hour than someone in 3b gear in the vanilla client at raids.
---
The people in that 150m gear probably have enough experience to pull that off, no one just starting raids or casually doing it is going to reap actual benefits from it.
---
&gt;	But that’s not what you are arguing, you are arguing it’s fair because it’s free. I can’t tell if you are arguing the plugins are fair, or if you are arguing they arent fair plugins but it’s okay because runelite is free. If runelite decided to switch to a subscription based model tomorrow, even if it was very inexpensive how would your opinion change?
---
The difference is that the client is free, no bullshit around it. It’s easily found and accessible, it’s not hidden away somewhere and it’s officially approved by jagex. They’re not locking plugins behind a paywall. If it was a subscription model I’d switch to another client lol? I wouldn’t give a shit if other people paid for it, as long as there aren’t OP plugins that aren’t approved. This game isn’t that serious to me that I’m gonna cry my eyes out that someone’s using a different client than me. Even if they were botting I could not care any less, what they do on their account barely changes my in game experience. I’m still going to train the way I want to and buy the items I need, regardless of their price.
---
This baby yoda is cuter than the other abomination.
---
China busy right now dealing with Hong Kong
---
You're not wrong hahaha
---
A few years back CutThroat and Silver Bloods had a rivalry. They changed their names to variations of BLO000D and CRIllIP etc
---
Is the item stacking thing a rl plug-in?
---
What about....10k for every hour you aren't in the wilderness. Makes the game start hectic, nips bot creation in the bud, satisfies PKers. Genius.
---
Runelite existing isnt a reason to neglect the official client though, which is what jagex uses it to do. It's what they did before runelite back when you had to pay 2 bucks a month for osbuddy pro too.
---
i dont know why you think I dont use runelite. I do use runelite. But again and especially since there's no mobile runelite client they can't justify continuing to neglect the official client anymore. As an example- have you personally tried doing a decent amount of solo raids on the mobile or official client? It's not a  victim thing, dont know how you think i'm playing the victim here.
---
More than likely yeah
---
Imagine believing that EVERY post here is the 1/2000 person telling the truth.
---
When the other 1999/2000 lie and leave out shit in the OP.
---
So you up front admit being connected about the dupe bug? There ya go solved
---
everyone learns eventually. either i tell him or he figures it out in a week. either way if he's gonna be a long term player it wont make a difference lol
---
Make the pet model 5% larger for every roll you get.
---
thanks buddy.
---
Oh boy, you think thats bad, try motherlode mine
---
Just remember two things for the future: Never ever drop your items and if someone says anti scam you know it's fake. Sorry for your loss and sucks to see this luring is still going...
---
Fletch yew longbows ( I see you have 61), high alch them while u do agility. Do some roof top laps. The mark of grace will be also for money later on.
---
How is 2016 ages ago? We are still in 2016 right guys? Oh god 2020 is coming wtf
---
I started the game roughly a week ago and it feels like I picked a good time to start. Plus I was given some starter gear and guidance from a veteran who found me killing cows in lumbridge.
---
Your whole comment didn't make sense. 
---
"I'm sure if they're bringing legal action against people they have enough evidence and proof of it." 
---
Thats fine, but they aren't taking legal action against anyone here, so how is this at all relevant?
---
Lets do it (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
jewelry box means you got at least 83 con and if you don't have that i don't know what to tell you
---
Honestly I can actually see that - League of Legends had a gamemode called URF that was a super fucking fast version of league, and they stopped bringing it back as often because they realised that it actually reduced their playerbase in the long term as people weren't able to get back into 'normal' league after playing without mana and 80% cooldown reduction for a few weeks
---
This community loves the drama and feels they’re entitled to know every time a j mod employee so much as sneezes.
---
You could claim jagex eats babies and it would get upvoted on a slow day
---
It's already been said, but don't feel like you need to justify yourself to the neckbeards on reddit. These people will froth at the mouth and get outraged about absolutely anything, no matter how slight.
---
Months? Do you kill 5 per day?
---
Why not? People make pking ironmen to avoid xp, this let's them get ahold of high level weapons while having another low level account.
---
Looks like the Alabama crew
---
When you open a crate it first rolls for a d axe -&gt; pet -&gt; tome -&gt; gloves -&gt; torch -&gt; then a piece of the outfit. You are given a piece that you have the least of and if they’re all tie then you get a garb. I keep my torches and gloves in bank because if you were to roll for it after having 3 banked it’ll turn into a magic seed for gloves and a torstol seed for torch. I always turn in extra outfit pieces but those crates don’t have any unique drops on it.
---
Chad level: 9000
---
I’m guessing that they’re expecting half of the uniques to fail the poll, and thus guaranteeing that the boss doesn’t have to be all alchables
---
&gt; double exp weekend 
---
maybe in RS3 you have double exp. In OSRS we have x20 multiplier.
---
Yeah. They definitely don't just sell it. Riiiiight.
---
Had to get 85 slayer
---
84 to boost for max jewelry box, “at least” 81 for the standard one that just holds a ring of dueling and a games neck. So close, but incorrect. 
---
You’re not understanding what I’m saying, but to be fair I literally have no fucking idea what you’re trying  to say either so I guess we should just cut this communication off right here.
---
Idk that rune 2 hand sword looks pretty advanced. I bet it’s the best weapon
---
Can confirm xyborg is one of the nicest dudes around
---
Smart thinking I guess :)
---
Made the same suggestion and got downvoted to fucking hell a day ago. Yes I agree. There’s no need to put 4 items on one boss when literally only 1 or 2 are enough to make it worth doing. We can save the other drops for future content.
---
For fucks sake mates, the staff alone and the 3 orb drops are all the boss needs if the orbs degrade.
---
what is important in over decade old point and click game?
---
When you use a jewelry box you’re still using a ring of dueling.
---
I'd suggest sticking with runelite. It's open source and theyve always complied with what jagex says is against the rules. It was confirmed anything on runelite is allowed.
---
Osbuddy lost almost all of it's market share so they like to add things that are very clearly over the line just to bring all 3rd party clients down with them.
---
I thought this was pretty funny, idk why people are down voting
---
unban frublox
---
Flick
---
Do u kno da wae?
---
Oof I got my black mask on 6 kc
---
Work no rec
---
Complete each diary as you get it. 
---
Apart from that, have fun.
---
Nice, I’m about to finish up 99 soon and I’ve got close to 100K lol. Soon to be incinerated.
---
Gonna piggyback on this - what are people's block list for duradel? Got all my points saved to block but hearing differing things from different people.
---
that youtube link is dead. what was it?
---
I was given 300 lobsters and mithral gear and some advice on where to farm and get food. I'm gonna stay away from getting too far ahead too early because that's not any fun.
---
I heard Mr Beast is the stripper for Mod Ash’s bachelor party
---
So knowing someone who's banned is a bannable offense now?
---
1143 kc 6 cores no pet
---
Very clean family
---
I was there when Anyless got his firecape
---
I'm good with the amount of time I've already dumped into this account lol. Dont have the time for a new account. Never gonna catch me grinding quests/stats again son
---
WHat about the Construction skillcape?
---
I think it's to hide his dent.
---
That a dds cursor? Nice. Do they still come with free viruses?
---
If you don’t play anymore, then how do you know what the clowns are doing
---
&gt;	I’m not asking you to do that though, I’m trying to convince you (and anyone reading this) to push for more balancing for the official client.
---
Do you really not think that everyone would encourage jagex to improve their client? People have been asking for years lmao, and there’s literally no way you could’ve made that connection out of your first few posts. Jagex isn’t going to improve their client while free alternatives are out that keep players around. 
---
&gt;	Have you tried raiding extensively on mobile for example? Have you tried one ticking bones on mobile or the official client? have you tried 3 tick+drop on mobile? If you have, youd know there's clear issues between the vanille, mobile and runelite.
---
No and why would I? I know it isn’t feasible and there’s only so many people who strictly play mobile only. If you’re playing on mobile your connection is going to be a bigger issue. I’m sure people can 1/3t on mobile if they want to but if you’re that serious about OSRS you’re probably going to play more on a desktop or laptop, with access to runelite.
---
Na
---
I'm not sure if I believe your story
---
Yea someone did this to me once as a kid.  I sold it lmao ez 30k
---
This. So much sarcasm
---
lmfao this sub man
---
Presuming guilt based on association isn’t silly bud.
---
If you wanna flex on noobs, give them bonds not free items.
---
Yeah what you have right there will last till you need gear upgrades into adamant and eventually rune. But if you decide to ever bite the bullet and go members there is so much variety in things to do its nearly impossible to get too far ahead too soon
---
Just get 99s in NMZ and do bgloves whenever you need it. Will be easy and take you 2-3 months
---
This is funny and all but this dude watermarked a fucking meme LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
I literally just got a pet at 66 agility a few days ago. Congrats!
