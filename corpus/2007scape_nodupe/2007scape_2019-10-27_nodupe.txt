If it wasn’t at 4 am for me I could definitely consider it

Most people subscribe to the dps is king philosophy, arguing that more dps = more exp/hr = better efficiency. After a certain gp/hr threshold on your money making method, food costs are pretty negligable, and faster kills are going to negate banking time. 
---

---
Therefore if you agree with that, i would advise against justiciar legs because they arent helping your dps at all. 
---
You can also get the same strength bonus as a bandos plate gets with a fighter torso for free, save a few hours and some def bonuses. 
---
So i would recommend the ammy, but keep in mind your strength bonus and wether or not it even fives you an extra max hit/what level you get an extra max hit. 
---
Goodluck!

I’ve had people do that shit at sand crabs. 6 hours in and never leaving longer than it takes to reset aggro and you get the dude that walks up, “bro hop I’ve been here for 2 hours, I was just resetting” lmao, okay, yeah, like that’s not just a blatant lie.
---
yeah its too bad i only really get one shot at it haha

that's a bad joke

If using runelite you can change your shift click to ‘use’ so it’s easier to combine doses. Just remember you have to adjust the shift click for each dose level 1-4.
---
Ive done ge is pretty trippy

Combine smithing and mining, tbh. 
---
And wc and fm.
---
And rc and mage.
---
And crafting and construction

I could be completely wrong here as, like I said before I haven't seen the code but I do believe that menu entries are hard coded into an object, if you wanted to create a check like that you'd have to alter the code behind every object in the game to give it the ability to check properly. We've seen before how small changes can completely mess up other areas of the game that're completely unrelated, and with the spaghetti code that the game was in before 2013, we can guarantee that a change this large will lead to alot of issues relating to random objects all across the map. I could be wrong here but this is just based off of what little understanding I have of the games code.

They could potentially mod a random account for the sake of banning/muting these dicing bots. But you’re still going to be back at square one when dicing bots show up less than 24 hours later. 
---
And you can’t give those powers to some rando, they’d have to be a Jagex employee. So at the end of the day, are resources put towards someone manually banning bots everyday that show up 24 hours later on a new account, worth it?

What? I can cook food to use. 1000% more useful than being able to Smith full rune at like 98.

Pretty sure dropping the skillcape in a F2P world, hopping, getting the 99, then hopping back to pick it up works.

That’s not how that works

---
Why would she leave when your face is literally the tears of guthix minigame
---
this is like middle school type coding though, its super basic stuff.
---
He is mixing quite a few things together to fit his narrative of Jagex being helpless against bots. The bot he displayed in the video still makes use of a client to get the opponents health etc., and to move the mouse. The only "machine learning" part of the bot is for the decisions on whether it should eat/use 2h and so on. Jagex would still be able to detect the bot based on client detection, mouse movements etc.
---
Even if the bot didn't make use of a client, and also had a way of imitating real human mouse movements, Jagex would probably still be able to detect that it is a bot based on many factors. Just using "machine learning" and other buzz words in your bot is not going to magically make Jagex helpless against it.
---
Mining and smithing make perfect sense if you consider the runescape world in classic. 16 years later slightly less sensical.
---
Adamant armor is the best in the game. Rune armor is added later. It is best in slot for for every piece of gear until dragon med and sq comes out (medium is worth 8 rune sets, and sq shield is worth 80 sets for the most minor best in slot bonus). The only gear that can be dropped are helmets and chain bodies (maybe square shield and legs?. I think longsword or short sword is dropped but they are largely outclasses by battle axe and 2h. This gear is only dropped by enemies that can devastate you since a handful of players are 100 combat and 40 prayer to paralyze monsters. 
---
And to top it off. For those couple of players who can do smithing for rune armor, there’s only like 3 spots to find an ore with a 15 minute spawn on it.
---
Real reason why it costed so much is that it is a clue step req, and clue items were expensive on release.

Trees are supposed to be shared, the asshole is the one that complains.

Yeah statue/ grave in wildy existed prior to his unexpected passing. Players have since attributed it to him, but afaik, it's not a nod from Jagex, at least it wasn't officially.

This may go without saying, but I dont really want to

Well don’t you worry. One day his shit armor will be unwearable while your bronze is as solid as the day you made it!

I wouldn't quite call the GE making the game "easy." I'd say what it does is it makes a lot of content fairly pointless.
---
Some new player who came from WoW posted (and deleted for whatever reason) something along these lines:  
---
"Often when I would get a new item, I would just dump it on the GE before even looking it up to learn what it does, knowing that I could just buy it later if I ever found myself needing one.  
---
...  
---
The vast majority of skilling content is almost completely irrelevant. The best way to train most skills is to farm the most profitable monsters for cash, then buy your way through a skill with the fastest method whenever you needed to train it, immediately buying and selling all relevant resources on the GE of course.  
---
The ability to simply insert cash and receive any item or vice/versa makes 90% of content irrelevant, as gameplay is basically condensed to finding the most profitable mob to kill, selling its drops, and using the money to buy gear to kill a yet more profitable mob."
---
I dont think so. Say you divide your items into three boxes (you type in a number to bring said box up) like id have one for my skilling, one for combat, one for everything else. Shouldnt need to fiddle with more than one or two at any given time. Of course it could be optional too, for those of us that really like added security (:

Best advice, have my upvote.
---
But how long?  Very nice collection though!
---
Sharing hurts afk time, but is better for efficiency when theres a group.
---
Which is why reworking it as rs3 did makes sense, because this isnt classic anymore. This is old school though, so that isnt happening.
---
Well it means you gotta do stuff with other people, too much to deal with for socially anxious people like me. I guess soloing is a thing but that seems quite challenging.
---
Do you need a savior to come in and bring you a super restore?
---
Yeah no-ge was best runescape imo. I know it might be different now with more advanced botting in place (where bots can perform fairly advanced trades, “react to stimuli”, etc), but it really made a difference when you had to buy and sell things. There  was more appeal in your character being a mage/runecrafter or a ranger/fletcher or whatever because you just had to “specialize” a bit more to be efficient and useful to the community.
---
Imagine having to do emotes or else you take major damage from a boss room.

I recently heard someone saying levels are way more important than gear, like being 99 with cheap gear is more dps than 90 with bis gear, so I thought divines must be good since they always stay at one level, am I wrong?
---
Now that you have mentioned it, is there a way to avoid another gorilla attacking you while the one you are fighting is doing his animation?
---
And also someone here suggested a ranged bottom switch and I did that today, maybe I should instead do a top switch? Or should I just go for the blessed d hide and keep the veracs skirt / blessed d hide switch?

I know those are alot of questions, no offense taken if you don't answer them

This. Bot watch should still be turned on, but banning capabilities should be disabled on bot worlds. This way it can still collect data and learn. 
---
Bot watch could also collect and post highscore data for a bot only highscore leaderboard. Quickest boss kills, most effecient kills in terms of inventory usage, highest boss counts, best pvp bot k/d ratios, best skilling bots, most creative bots, etc. Bot makers would have a frenzy with this for the competition, even if they knew it was actively hurting them. They would do it, because there are plenty of programmer’s like the guy in the video who make bots as a hobby.
---
YOu can drop all quest items save for gree grees from mm1. Everything else is easily reobtainable if say a new quest comes out
---
About to start up again after a hiatus, excited!
---
Then they wouldn't use that world.  Why would they sign up to get caught? The whole concept makes no sense.
---
I've been playing for years and never knew about him lol. There are a few quest items you do want to keep but the majority you can drop and I'm pretty sure they are all replaceable. A few you want to keep are ring of visibility, amulets (ghostspeak, monkeyspeak ,catspeak), the monkey camouflage things from monkey madness, ring of charos, darklight (to upgrade to arclight), dramen staff. Most quest rewards you want to keep like magic secateurs, ectophial etc.
---
Range void is good for chinning and fighting low defense monsters offtask

MElee void is used at tob, mage void is good pre torm brace for all magic pvm or for tob

Well the last quest I did (which I just finished today) was Monkey Madness 2 and god did I hate that quest, but then again there was a good couple quests that are just a major pain. I enjoyed the chalenge of Dragon slayer 2 so I think it was one of my favorites but again that one is also just more recent in my memory as well. Overall was actually pretty enjoyable and I never actually thought I would finish them all originally but here I am.

I feel like there's enough noted ess drops that no one needs to mine that shit to keep the runes flowing.   
---
The real impact on the economy that the PvM meta has imo is how players never have to grind for gear upgrades now due to lack of item sinks. There's enough zerk rings in the game now that any regular account who is a high enough level to take on DKs definitely has one, will never get rid of it and can't even lose it without going deep wildy. B rings will never recover to &gt;3-4m+ like they used to be because every single new ring coming in to the game is worth less than the last with no item sink.

I think it’s a proposed reward from that new seasonal rs game mode

It might be but they probably ban more people for rwt than botting. I would personally buy a bond or 2 and rebuild from there..
---
This is why ironman is so appealing to such a large portion of the playerbase. The amount you learn on iron is crazy, not to mention you end up using methods or items that you'd never even consider on a main. Mainscape is just about doing the most profitable methods and then buying your way through the game. What's the point of killing a boss that takes time if it makes you 1m an hour if that, when Vorkath, Zulrah or Revs net you 4m+ an hour with little effort. Even going out and collecting quest items takes time which some might find tedious but it's something I've really enjoyed, it's like preparing for a quest is a little quest in itself. Stuff like that really sparked my interest for the game again
---
should’ve just made a text post
---
Wow I think you just described to me why I quit membership and basically stopped playing 3 months ago. The game had no magic it was just 'grind barrows until____"

Is there anyway to notify you if you're AFKing and receive a valuable drop on runelite? Similar to the bird's nest notification? Can't find anything in the settings
---
Nice work buddy, awesome first 99! :-)
---
Won't bother suggesting what 20 others already have, but i prefer using a fury and a suffering (i). The extra def (&amp;

 prayer bonus) honestly helps a ton on the times where you guess wrong in the 50/50s.

generally you are switching every 3-4 attacks so i don't personally see the value in ring/ammy switches but I'm also super lazy.

Lol nub i got pet at 37 and 173 kc. Iron man btw

We also have his 07 ss number, 50FPS

I’m sure it went wrong the day MMG was made CEO

Awesome! Congrats on being second place! Perhaps if you try again you’ll get in?
---
Crashers has always been the worst part of the game for me.
---
Definitely wearing the ghost speak ammy. I had the same problem cuz i saw a post saying using the ammy gives you some unique quotes. But i think thats later on during the event
---
Where is the pet drop? That's a vork head which is 1/50 kills. Nothing really "rare" to brag about in screenie. He's just showing the loot tracker picked up vial.
---
That's a head drop homie
---
Group Ironman just gonna revive it if anything. He’s the most consistent pvm streamer at the moment, he’s not going anywhere unless he gets bored I’d think haha
---
If you’re going to 99 with silvers, good luck I stopped at 82 because it got too tedious
---
Easiest way to do it is to highlight all drops above a certain value then notify on highlighted drops (both in Ground items plugin)
---
But that’s not how safe spaces work, you’re missing the entire point. 
---
Keep being wrong though that’s cool as long as it doesn’t bother you.
---
Grats man!! I can't even imagine. What's kc?
---
In prison booty is more important than wata
---
They can yes. But should they? That should be the question here. Set a good example, not whatever that is.

To be fair, the pet icon is just a not sideways vorkath head

Xp rates generally should be listed as max rates (with proof someone can get them over an extended period) rather than arbitrarily guessing how efficient/sweaty someone is.

Dude it's $20 and you have your money back.  Save up.

which ones? i only know of strength and power amulet trimmed.  
---
Those are trimmed though not really ornaments. I wanted power amulet to go with my green guthix set up.   
---
I might just change to saradomin just for my amulet.

The ornament kits are for versions without a trimmed version.

Hill Giants and Moss giants dude. I’m 75 combat, 61attk/60str/60def 43 prayer just from doing that from 40+ combats
---
Runelite allows you to remove the xp cap in a sense. You can see virtual levels. But it would definitely be cool if it was straight up implemented into the game as real levels. Maybe offer end game incentives for lvl 105, 110, etc.
---
Nothing game breaking, but enough to make you want to keep grinding. You can still get cape at 99, but anything after is “mastering” the skill or something. Definitely an interesting concept to think about. Won’t ever happen but still pretty cool
---
Check the osrs wiki for a good guide, but in order to save yourself the money you have to harvest the bones yourself. 
---
If you're about to do dragon slayer, you can probably kill giants no problem. I'd get some training in on hill or moss giants, and bury those bones for the xp.

basically any other content other than pvp :-)

\&gt; Like shit, even Framed is more deserving for being a good pker. Bottom line is no one wants anyone to get immortalized in the game without deserving it.

What does that even mean?  Actually, fuck it.  Let's make this real simple.  Did you encounter the easter egg in game?  In fact, would you have ever encountered it if you didn't hear about it?
---
Be thankful building one builds both chairs as well lol.
---
how were you killing them without taking damage?  just sitting on wall and avoiding aoe splats??
---
Cool idea.
---
If this were to be added, I'd prefer a full hunter rework like RS3 got for M+S.
---
Hunter is currently one of the worst skills in the game purely because of how limited it is. 80% if not more of the items and methods in the skill guide are never visited by players, and lots of mechanics like baits and smoking are borderline useless.
---
As it stands, all hunter is used for is chins, herbiboar pet and implings, so reworking prior content and having things like this boss would really livej it up.

Smelting gold is expensive (and very fast xp), pretty much anything else is profitable (and not super fast xp).
---
Surely it links to Twitter.
---
I agree. The bait and smoke “benefits” are too miniscule to be worth being bothered for. And the fact that the various Hunter gear is cosmetic is pretty underwhelming. Also plenty of Hunter loot is useless no matter what lvl or archetype build you have. They ought to make the skill more viable/rewarding other than for doing chins, herbis, or implings.

Appears to be bots logging in and selling particular items up to a threshold at desert general store (pollnivneach). Assuming items are profitable to buy from GE and sell here. If you're looking to report they don't stay on worlds long, just enough to hop and sell inv
---
What
---
Mans gotta make money
---
1. Its not ahk
---
2. Its not even “good” because if theyre botting their prayer switches then they will literally never hit a prayer switch in time. It takes 1 tick to react and switch prayers and 0 ticks to switch and Hit. So if u just hit perfect switches its an autowin. Even if ur a bad pker just sit in tank and 1 way switch a whip and crossbow and youll beat these bots.
---
Can you imagine how amazing it would be if the OSRS team got even *half* the amount of funding they deserve?

Nope. It just takes him right back here.

if you're using runelite try disabling the low detail mode maybe?

Are top tier pvmers able to complete the corrupted gauntlet 100% of the time? I haven’t done it since near release so maybe they made it easier, but I only got one completion in like 30 attempts.

I was at greater demons in kourend and some guy crashed me so I moved to the higher section with 4 demons, there was one guy already there but plenty of demons were spawning.. he told me to hop which I said I don't need to and then he started attacking my demons. I would move to a free one and he would just follow!
---
This made it all very fun for me so I told him well now I'm definitely not hopping as this is hilarious. Couldn't care less about xp loss just watching him get raged was great fun!

A dishwasher doesn’t make more than £23k, they’d make minimum or just above minimum wage. Even £10/hr they’d need to work every week day for 8 hours (assuming unpaid lunch hour) plus 4 extra hours. Realistically they’d be 40 hours a week on £8.50ish and work roughly 48 weeks over the year to get £16.5k
---
Alright thanks a lot. Outside of herb runs i should also find an afk method since i spend 1:30-2 hours a day on a bus.

Add me - ENG Ferret

He might not have 75 Def

Imagine spending 30 minutes at corp beast to see the same thing

This sounds very similar to an existing RS3 boss. I'm not against the idea because of that. I think it sounds hecking awesome. But it does sound familiar.

Ah, I see you’re out of yours as it stands

Borderline? Some of them are actively useless, like hunter gear.
---
fishing monkfish/karambwans are a pretty low-level option for afk money. You could also craft jewellery or make cannonballs, or fletch bows
---
Obvious troll with that username.
---
Fletching yew logs becomes profitable at 75 and super afk. Only 100k an hour but still. Karambwan cooking is also maybe afk profitable
---
It all just depends on how far into the wild you are going... if you will be in 50 wildy you’ll be preyed upon either way! What are you planning to do in the wild?

tob is impractical to solo, and also would be worse money than doing it in a trio/4 man since completion times are so long.

&gt;"Often when I would get a new item, I would just dump it on the GE before even looking it up to learn what it does, knowing that I could just buy it later if I ever found myself needing one.
---
This is a genuine problem I had with playing a normal account. When I did Barrows, I didn't even look at what item I got. All I looked at was the price of the chest. Drops became piles of money. Everything was money.
---
Mark makes it sound more like a lifestyle decision in the RS documentary, and he was the first to go.

I don't think it's even that, pretty sure the entire joke is "lol I didn't customize my character at all, I look like a bot!"

It’s actually leaf-bladed spear that I used in the pic lol, just used it as a placeholder to give visual aid for a new Hunter only spear
---
/rwallstreetbets would like to have a talk with you
---
Honestly a good dose of fear mongering is healthy. The reason we are all here is due to them completely ruining our old favourite game, after all.  
---
Some do take it way too far though, but it's generally only the powerusers and twitter
---
That's... Even dumber
---
Warding should have been a trimming armor skill, would have passed. SMH
---
Lmao and people were saying  that Jagex employees were not under. NDA over 15 people  have left in like pass 2 months they obviously can’t say shit even if they wanted to
---
People say the GE was needed as scamming and the "time investment" it took to get trades through made the whole process near unbearable.
---
Yes. The Grand Exchange solved scamming, and is incredibly inconvenient. Literally everyone who knows about it and isn't an ironman will use the Grand Exchange and do a trade, whereas maybe before a lot of players couldn't be bothered trading anything ever.
---
**But the inconvenience of trading is what gave every individual activity more value.** Knowing how to get barrows pieces, or the best way to obtain dragonstone amulets, or simply harvesting your own supplies individually had more weight. The inconvenience factor acted as a sort of "tax" on the prospect of trading- it also rewarded players who got involved in trading and putting their time to merchanting.
---
On top of that it felt like the rest of the map was a lot more active and alive. Players hung out in lumbridge, castle wars wall, just about EVERY bank in key locations around the entire map had people talking, bartering, training firemaking or any multitude of processing skills.
---
I'd honestly take back the days of the cancer trading, cause I know that "cancer" at least created *some* value in doing activities.
---
I feel like the game is going down a slippery slope with ironman mode as well though. Instead of updating the game and not really considering if it's hard for ironmen or not they have added so many things to go that only and directly effect ironmen to make certain grinds easier. If it carries on apart from getting pvm drops for yourself there won't be much of a difference on the skilling side of things than playing on a main.

Hespori works fine, used on my skiller. You will still keep 3 items on death so go in skulled

For prayer your best bet is going to be the ectofuntus with whatever best bones you can get a hold of. I don’t know what stats you have or what’s quests etc but that’s the first thing I’d suggest 😊

&gt;Everyone served a purpose that benefited the community. Today, with the G.E, that sense of community is not as strong
---
I'm getting a strong "local community was destroyed by capitalism" vibe off this post.
---
It’s also a terrible approach if you’re trying to have fun, unless you find clicking a rock 5000 times to get armour that isn’t worth anything fun.
---
How do you have 20k
---
Make/run 2k alts with a bot.
---
Have them all follow your main around.
---
Commit sudoku
---
200m all required, heals 4 hp.
---
This is precisely why Ironman is so appealing
---
Yes
---
It's incredible fun. I tried UIM "as a joke" in FTP, and now I'm like nearly 1600 total in members with like 6m+ in items in my looting bag.
---
I'm STILL having a blast playing it. I legit have more fun TODAY than I did back in my "nostalgia" era of the game. I've learned so god damn much playing the account, and there are so many small unlocks and goals.
---
Farming Demonic Gorillas for the first time on my Ironman. I mostly understand what I'm doing, but I'm struggling a bit. I've been doing pretty good at catching their attack style switches and praying accordingly. My issue is the one attack they tend to get in before I know what they're switched to. I'll catch the switch, but that one range attack they get in before I know I need to pray range just seems to always blast me for 25-30 damage or something. Magic is my lowest defense with my setup, so if they're not in Magic and go to switch, I'll pray mage just to be safe. But if they go Melee -&gt; Range and not Melee -&gt; Magic I just get chunked every time. It's making me have really short trips.
---
Is there something I'm just not seeing here on what I should be doing? And for the record, [this is my gear setup](https://i.imgur.com/dC6A7Xs.png), with a RCB/Ava's for my switch (and I usually have Explorer's Ring in the ring slot, just forgot to swap for this screenshot). Keep in mind I'm Ironman, so I'm working with what I have.
---
It generally works that way in countries that don’t try to bankrupt you if you break a finger
---
I do a lot of Zalcano and no gauntlet. I have 83 mining and consistently get 2-3m an hour at zalc without uniques and would say a 5m estimate must factor in some uniques. Although a high mining level helps a little I think it’s more about what pick you have and just getting ur technique down. Always do zalc in a group of 3 or 4 and try to 3-cycle it. Try to get at least 8 tephra per down and understand it’s not always max damage to wait for the blue circles. MVP helps a little bit it’s not a huge game changer, you somewhat often get 300-500k drops even without it. Good luck dude
---
I mean considering they've admitted live at RuneFest to have written some quest puzzles and challenges while super drunk, I would be surprised if that was the case.
---
Hey, I have the same issue since this morning, also made post about a few minutes ago. It's been going on for hours and it is really annoying.
---
no to the pure rewards we don't need things for them in all content it's a high tier boss im assuming give it high tier rewards not everything made for pures
---
&gt;Maybe offer end game incentives for lvl 105, 110, etc.
---
I hope that if they ever do this, it'll be for some sort of cosmetic. Perhaps a trim to the 99 cape, or a cumulative boosts to pet chances that are spread out over 100-126.
---
If there was an actual bonus, however slight, it'll become the meta to grind out that level before you can really utilise the skill. For example, if 110 was the cap for combat skills, then high end pvm clans would require that as an entry point, and future pvm would be balanced around having 110 stats, etc. It'd just introduce months of grinding just to get back to the point where one can "finally play the game".
---
Saw this post in New and thought jesus christ this community is dumb. Now it's on the front page.
---
This is pretty similar to an idea I had a while ago https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8yt6rb/questboss_idea_bigger_chompy_bird_hunting/
---
Just recently got my 1k kc at demonic off task. I have made nearly 60m from them. The only difference in gear from what I run is that I go for full void. I ran the numbers on a dps calc and atleast with my stats it is better dps. I'm guessing the real problem is you aren't praying properly. I usually take 2 super combats and ranging pots and will bank when I go through both of them. 
---
Ps. The ring switch itsnt worth the dps difference tbh, stick with berserker
---
Depending on what options you have, use a shield, I normally go with defender but tried it with a spectral shield and it was so good for helping last longer, crystal shield would be great if you have it or even a dfs, as you have alow pipe you won't get the negative range bonus
---
Revenge of the C H O M P S
---
That’s excessive. Maybe it could just take the player’s shit and throw it all over the floor.
---
How sad....could have had better time management
---
Yeah MVP is broken and doesnt help at all actually, you average better drops when your not MVP and just did high damage compared to the MVP, the MVP just has a higher % to get the pet
---
Should also add that you need to complete part of the quest, What Lies Below, to see b staves in his shop. 
---
So if you open his shop and don’t see what OP is talking about, that’s why. That quest req happened in order to combat the bots buying b staves 24/7.
---
Hahahahahahaha making fun of someon!!! Hahahahahahaha cool, wow not efficient, so bad, noob, hahahahaha. Fucking chad OP

Have you been playing Monster Hunter? Cause this sounds a lot like how those fights go. Love the idea btw, combines the ideas of the two games I’m playing right now.

Not as long as botting is possible

Weapon and neck is enough for me. Adapt to your style.

What where, isnt fossil island teak personal
---
Congrats man! Farming is all about consistency! Just gotta stick with it. Did you get the pet?
---
Check how long slayermusiq guide takes. If you do it without a guide, 8 hours?
---
Can we see chat box of you obtaining pet?
---
Cant afk comfortably,for some reason you cant claim your items like other instance boss
---
I didn't screenshot it, but if you'd like i can show it in my inventory
---
I think vork will be better if you have a poh pool and lunar isle portal, and can get bgs/bp. Zulrah is kinda annoying to do without suffering imo, and is a lot more intensive overall.
---
I have stared at my female osrs character’s booty longer than any normal person should tbh
---
Nats were good, but RC is still good too. But my point was that the balance wasn't that different back in the day; it just moved to different PvM. For the most part, the bad types of money-making are still bad and the good types are still good.
---
Lucky that they even called back! Studios tend to just ghost applicants if they aren't selected. The silence can be excruciating at times!
---
I found Japanese studios to be very helpful and polite when it comes to that. Usually explaining why they went with someone else.
---
Looks great.

My posture was awful.

I rrecently bought a Herman miller chair, although they're very pricey it's easier to maintain a good posture and remain comfortable.

For the hours we put into our gaming life going all out on the seating is worth it.

Blowpipe runs about 500k a hr scale cost I do believe. I'm not at home to calculate out the bolt cost but you can figure it out by the breakage rate x shots per hour = broke bolts x cost.

if you have any capital at all, just do gold w/ goldsmithing gauntlets to 60 so you can stop paying the foreman. then you can do mith and make your money back. gold isnt thaaaat expensive.
---
The javelin mid air... LOL.
---
Priority? What kinda basement dwelling baby man is this
---
I didnt train rc and i want it to stay "boring". The way I view it, is that rc is the big "perseverance test" you have to go through to get one of the most lucrative rewards ingame; the max cape. Can't it stay like that? The max cape would lose value in my eyes if rc got easier, and that's something I 100% don't want

I’ve always heard the joke about forgetting to eat, but a couple of weeks ago I played Mindustry for 12 hours straight and forgot to eat dinner and was like “why am I hungry?”

I mean glory could easily be used for teleporting as it's not really a HUGE disadvantage to fury for mid-game and veracs is one of the best budget tank helms not to mention pray bonus...

You can just flinch Elvarg, no prayer needed.

Backup codes are basically an industry standard for 2FA recovery, they work well provided the user doesn't store them stupidly (like emailed to them self or something)

as an added bonus you'll give yourself a permanent dent in your ability to concentrate on one thing at a time due to doing literally anything and everything  to minimize actual interaction with the grind.

If runecrafting was faster an easier then what would take its place? Something needs to be easy and fast and something needs to be slow and boring. If they were all fast and east what would be the point of having different skills?

Gonna add making gold bracelets to this list
---
My account was just banned in the middle of a session. I have been afk training smithing while doing homework all week. It was for botting and I’ve never use a bot in all of my years of playing. It’s only for two days. It’s really frustrating I can’t play for two days, but I’m more concerned of it happening again right as I’m unbanned. The appeal section on my account says I can’t do anything. Do I have any options to get it unlocked? I really have no clue what to do when it is usable again.
---
Seems like someones baiting the pmod with racism using the ghost outfits?

They're both terrible gp/xp. Maybe if you're iron I'd understand the bloods.
---
Reread it again... I said axe, not pick

Nah, I think that this would (in certain cases) lead to people making 20+ bots to just stand around and get random events

Gz

Shut up

one of those gambling bots

I like it better if they drain you of xp in your lowest skill. Just a tiny bit the same amount of xp you would have gotten from a lamp.

lmao couldnt make it on ds2? why does he even have verzik in his name
---
In addition to this his range attack happens more often then mage
---
Haha thanks for some reason I don’t remember a lot of those, just the frogs, sandwich lady, and Jekyll and Hyde that I do remember. I was pretty young back in the day when I played.
---
Wow, you're really toxic to the point that you don't even read. If you keep at it people might even mistake you for being retarded. That's a whole nother level of being stupid. There's ignorant level stupid, then there's toxic keyboard warrior level retarded of stupidity that takes in info and somehow twists that info just so you can vent/spread more of your toxicity.
---
I haven't played for a year now, last time i played was in 2018, i used osbuddy then and runelite even before that. 
---
That was then, this is now.
---
I did mention i stumbled across a video regarding people getting banned by using 3rd party client. Here(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JqKRosTuI), i'll even give you a link because i want to help stop your toxicity from affecting more of your working brain.
---
This is a legit worry. I'm not a streamer, a false positive ban on me for using a 3rd party client for whatever reason(i don't use any abusive plugins because i'm currently f2p training melee at stronghold security) could be the end for me. As i said, i'm not a streamer, just an average player among thousands of others. I don't record videos of my playtime so i can't be prepared to prove my innocence. 
---
If you have nothing to contribute to this thread, just don't reply on anything. You are such a salty sjw on 3rd party clients. I never even bashed them here. I just stated my worry of getting falsely banned for using a 3rd party client and here you are guns blazing insulting me out of nowhere. Take your 'special needs' somewhere else. There are alot of youtube videos comment section for your 'special needs', there you are free to be as toxic and as special as you can be.
---
Damn this looks good
---
Glad you enjoyed it and super happy to hear that you were even thinking about it. Cheers!
---
There’s just absolutely no reason for a level 40 armor requiring 99 smithing to make. Where-as a DFS is something like 75 smithing.
---
Bring some gp with you because they recently made it so that some NPCs in the underground pass will sell you food, which is nice. Bring a couple staminas and a bunch of food, and hope you get good RNG

BTW?

Dont't you also need it for the diary?
---
No if u stand under him he will melee u, be like 2sq away when using Hally most time when u attack using your hally ur like 2sq anyway. And na I always use tier 1 as it's alot quicker and Max hit thought prayer is 13 so if u pray correctly it's fine. Good luck man corrupt can be difficult at first to get the hang of it.
---
Jesus that's pretty good
---
You're right I worded it wrong. Some are smaller and harder to click but skillshots shouldn't be harder to hit on them.
---
I mean people have had every pet on 1kc, its just a roll of a dice, means nothing. People win the lottery everyday
---
So you could have placeholders that you potentially couldn't even use because you didn't have bank space, defeating the point of having the placeholders?
---
It also opens up the possibility of having a bank containing thousands of different items because the placeholders dont count, making it a chaotic mess and being a massive memory issue server side

Were you by any chance inspired by "jealousy" from edvard munch? Haha looks great though well done mate

Maybe the bot farm got shut down?
---
Instead of big bones. Make it Ourg bone. It makes sense since chompys are around there. So the chompy stole the ourg bones from the ogres. Drops 1-3 a game to participating people. No more than 1 per person though
---
&gt;Farming a boss to buy my way through a skill is just not fun to me at all.
---
That's the original point. I definitely wont deny as an ironman you'll be stuck grinding certain bosses for a long time, but instead of doing it for gp, you're doing it for an item. There's a certain sense of satisfaction of getting that drop finally and being able to say you're 'done' with a boss that you simply don't get when farming bosses for gold.
---
There are also bots who farm the spawn in the wilderness from torvestas video
---
going to try now good idea
---
I just don't think I should be forced to have multiple accounts for each bracket to pk. Would be nice if my suggestion was implemented so I could pk on my one account at all levels.
---
Without a spectral, that 90 prayer point drain is a pain in the ass
---
The bank icons are rendered from items directly, they aren't sprites, the current reason there's a limit is because rendering more than 800 makes the bank interface really slow, the placeholder items are also rendered items so they still count towards the limit.
---
From what Jagex have indicated, an engine rework to fix this is incredibly unlikely, thus why they've tried to find ways around it such as the seed vault and leprechauns.
---
Oh yeah I totally was, so was the guy I was replying to for sure, though I do kind of think they should come back maybe, or at least I miss when they were dangerous, now they're nothing more than a mild annoyance unless its genie or school random and maybe maze sometimes. Sarcasm can be hard to convey through text though so the downvotes on your comments are totally uncalled for, this sub is pretty dumb sometimes like that.
---
man you are a genius dont know how you thought of that but it worked. thank you so much
---
As the first comment says be careful as their are plenty of scamming clans / people out there, there are a couple of clans that are trusting just cant remember the names. It's a risky bit of work but if u find a trusting clan it's decent.

I see you play on w420 a lot

Spinning flax is like the meme money making method. You might want to check out some of these https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide

How did they scam u was it from a Cox split? Or was it from item lending?
---
Yeah, but I don’t want to add a year with of progress into my current account just to quit it.
---
Don’t really have anything on that account
---
spotted the pmod
---
Ah ok. So I tried this and now my casts are nearing 600/hour as well. I guess the wiki is deceptively calculating profit/casts based on the 3/18 method. There's no way you would be able to get to 600/hour if you were to pick up all the glass on the floor.
---
There is as much variety as you want there to be. EHPscape is not mandatory. What happened to playing for fun?

It's a terrible day for rain

I'm not a pmod, i haven't played in a long time
---
hope this is a joke
---
Tbh there are only two active brackets - pure and main. 
---
Anything else is a niche account that won’t see a lot of action and/or will get bullied by a different bracket. 
---
And you aren’t forced to, there is money to be made and fights to be found in either bracket. 
---
I’d be super surprised if they let you change your stats like that, since it takes away membership sales. There’s a reason osrs is known as “alt scape”.
---
You color things the same color that will go together in a swap, ie blue for all mage gear, red for meele, etc. - just an easier to process visual for some people myself included.

Makes sense, thanks!

I'm trying to get con, agi, herblore, smithing, hunter, and wc to 70 by November 2nd so I can do SotE and join that guy's 99 party in Priffdinas. Problem is, I was scammed for 5m (80% of my bank value) on Friday. I have to make that money back somehow to fund con and herblore. So I'm doing my best money maker (smithing) to 70. I'm hoping that + the money from red chins to 70 will fund con and herblore.
---
Hopefully that gives you a sense of my current goals as a mid-game player.
---
I haven't personally checked, but I'd imagine the login requests are encrypted, so using a public wifi shouldn't be a big issue. You can use data plan if you're paranoid (buying a chip is usually pretty cheap), but I don't think it's necessary.

Fun fact: There is no such thing as world rights
---
You can decide to fuck someone over and take their world if you can, or you can decide to hold onto the world you've been doing it on rather than hop another 20mins because someone took your seat. If you go bank and come back to a guy telling you he's been there for hours, you'd have to be a massive pussy to just fuck off and let him have it.

Haha, I know a bunch of the theory but actually reaching peak rates is difficult. I'm not too sure, what you wrote sounds mostly right. [Here's a video from the EHP discord](https://youtu.be/x0p80YexTwY), maybe there's something missing that would come across better in a video?
---
Best advice I can give is make a complete quest list with all the skill requirements you need. Take a look at the experience rewards and find a good order to do the quests. Some experience rewards can save you quite a bit of time spent on training.
---
6 months?? It only costs 5m cash money on the ge.
---
Joe.
---
but consider: the ZMI runecrafting is faster, and the Arcceus library can be a pretty similar speed. The skull strikes me as just kinda pointless.
---
She’s got a slice of pizza tattoo’d on her shoulder lmao
---
There is dialogue during one of the quests where he says, "I must be frank with you sir", so there
---
👍👍 So mine copper and tin and when.i hit lvl 41 i start mining iron?
---
been rc training every day for an hour for the past 5 days
---
got killed every day
---
???
---
i was expecting a ton of bots selling gold but
---
this is better
---
Headcanon accepted
---
I’ll show up, see ya there
---
1/4 day training with Dsword and you can speed that up
---
Mhm
---
I've been killed like 5 times, I think it's bot puritans?
---
(For the record, no I'm not using a bot)
---
monkey madness gives back 30k attack xp tho
---
My favourite is when they [RAID SHADOW LEGENDS] just throw in a mid-roll ad mid sentence.
---
Btw
---
Yep.  And you can do dorics quest and knights sword for some early smithing levels to save time banking then once you get to 30 you can save the iron and coal for steel bars for smithing exp :)
---
Sorry didn't read.
---
You're wrong.
---
Recover your account and auth is instantly removed. 
---
Nothing has changed. Jagex doesn't understand that false recoveries are the only reason we wanted auth delay.
---
This this and always this
---
Just turn off menu entry swapper feature as it is debatable. And you should be good to go as they keep their client up to date with Jagex’s rules.
---
True, i had forgotten avout that. Even still with the d sword you're around 80k ahead, assuming you get it done in a few hours (have all the reqs)
---
Tbh Blast Furnace is one of the activities I’ve found that really burn me out when I try to do it tick-perfect. I’d advise to take it a little more relaxed and just work towards a goal.
---
You don’t have to use a stamina potion to gain exp. You still make great profit and exp when you’re walking. Just take it at the pace that makes it most enjoyable.
---
i was halfway joking but it really is basic stuff.
---
you could literally spend an hour on a youtube tutorial and know how to do it.
---
I get the feeling I was one of the lucky ones with MM1. I never timed myself but I never felt like it was taking a frustratingly long time for any part of it other than the stupid cave you have to run to the end of multiple times.
---
Probably just crashing some clan's party.
---
Just to know that RS3's team is like twice the size compared to OSRS.
---
so from 60-70 is \~450k xp so the question is is the d scim about 20% more dps than the d long, i think it depends on if you got strength levels from completing monkey madness as well tbh
---
All that 200gp?
---
weird way to cope
---
I can’t even read this because the image is compressed too much without opening the host url and mobile Chrome won’t even let you zoom in that far.
---
believe me if you think he botted learn about ehp respect most ppl dont know how to grind Always welcome in my cc. &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Every single kid at my school botted back in 2009. Obviously I can’t say everybody who has ever played runescape botted, but you’d be lying to yourself if you think 80% of the community hasn’t botted before in some sort of way.
---
But you also have to teleport and bank wines
---
Lol.
---
Unless you have 85+ strength the d scim and d sword are virtually identical, that's the point. The d scim might eke out an extra few k an hour, but it's not worth the time spent getting it when the d sword exists, if you're solely doing it for the d scim
---
Don't worry m8, i suck at runescape and reddit so I overclass you
---
Must be me but I've never seen the playtime reminder and I play quite alot tbh.
---
Tho this wouldn't hurt might even help people.
---
I tend to sit straight but usually my head is leaning forward to look at the screen so my neck gets quite irritating.
---
That's bizarre
---
I mean you can test it- superior antifire and pray mage is not full protection, the wiki isnt perfect.
---
I heard they will start selling them as MTX. One pass will cost $5 and will allow you to use the n word 2 times.
---
On a main account sara book is actually much more useful than the zammy one, but don‘t mind me
---
I too like squeezing fish.
---
&gt;Also if it uses a boulder attack it'll be ranged or magic.
---
Wait really? If it's on melee, it won't ever boulder you? 700 odd kc and this is news to me.
---
I’m not crying, you are
---
Did it before ds2 actually, it wasnt too bad other than the stupid mutant gorillas before glough and i just let Nieve kill them while I hid in the beginning of the cave.        
---
        
---
All I need to do is SoTE for Quest Cape. Working on 70 Construction for that.
---
This is not about scim vs long, but scim vs sword. They have identical attack speeds and 3 str difference
---
It's a neat idea, but it's probably a bigger change than you'd think. Starting at level 11 you make double air runes and thus 10xp/ess, for example, which is what you'd get for Deaths - when you hit 77 and get 23.8 from Bloods, you get *40* from Air runes. Run times differ, obviously, so I'm not sure which basic runes would be the best. Air probably beats everything with runners, but otherwise it might be Mind since it's got the Arceuus teleport.
---
Rune dragons
---
Or people can just play the game however they want and not care about efficiency
---
/r/itswooooshwith4os
---
i think as soon as you can afford the dhcb its around 110m you should be good to switch to vorkath.
---
Either I'm dense and don't know how to, but I can't add a description on mobile..
---
Long story short, a friend of mine accidentally posted a picture to his instagram story. How can anyone not recognize the osrs private messaging? Sent him a message asking if he still plays. Turns out he's logged over 600 hours into the game. Also said hes the second person to get 99 fishing in osrs (questionable)
---
Pretty high start up costs, no? Assuming he spent his gp from hunter and rc (back when he was 90) on buyables, i’d say he wouldnt have a dhl unless he sold the bank. Even if he did rune dragons still require more attention than rc, especially without justiciar (speaking as someone who is currently literally just doing blood rc and rune drags right now)
---
Yeah and meele cant safespot enemies. They do different things.
---
There are no classes in osrs so you can use all 3 combat styles for their unique advantages.
---
They take a minute, OP just throwing a hissy fit
---
I've tried to get support for several accounts. They only had a business contact email and the "support" page only sent you for a ticket submission which never gets answered.
---
[This guide](https://youtu.be/nL-xqIZgt3w) helped me beat him with no issues.
---
Looks like you tbh
---
People choose to purposely get crashed and griefed? Nah
---
Lmao
---
I take it you have 92 agility? lol
---
Anchovies have a 30 gp profit per cooked food. For getting a bond I really think he should buy a bond with irl money then maintain it
---
It's the truth though, OSRS is in its fucking prime, don't forget this my boys. I already miss the interactions I had from two years ago, and it wasn't that long ago, right? OWN IT
---
If you liked factorio you should check out satisfactory. Really fucking cool, had the same effect on me as factorio.
---
We've all been there, and tbh it's not a bad starter method
---
Another suggestion I have is looting pvp worlds with a fresh account or just use your current account
---
Live by the flip, die by the flip. 
---
It's the GE tracker app. And It amazing, makes finding decent flips way less tedious.
---
Could you imagine explaining this to the dudes mom at the funeral? 
---
"I'm personally honoring the memory of your son by clicking a mouse in the same 10 places for 8 hours a day on a game called Two-Thousand Seven Runescape. That's how much he meant to me"
---
So I'm away at college and taking a break from the scape but still logging in occasionally for some f2p flipping. I accidentally took out my whole cash stack and can't put it back in now since I'm over the limit. Probably not a huge deal but I'm a bit paranoid of being hacked given all the posts, and having my stack behind a bank pin made me feel at least a bit better. 
---
Anyway to get my cash back in? considering just putting it all in a GE offer
---
You probably looking for a bot instead of a plugin mate.
---
Did you say something? You coughed
---
You can achieve the same effect in real life by going to the gym.
---
SCRHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I dont know how you could've fucked up r/woooosh any worse than that.
---
99 prayer
---
BECAUSE JAGEX IS FALSE BANNING EVERYONE RIP
---
yes pls
---
Yeah, growing up I thought that the RS mods/employees made bank playing and developing a game that I, and mostly likely them as well, loved. I was disappointed to learn that you can almost make more at any entry level position across the board.
---
lel
---
Well Flanders is secretly Satan remember.
---
But he botted
---
If you legit think that this is what being a terrible person is like, it'd be p fun to see you interact with actual people.

Well a maxed pure would have 99 range 99 str 99 mage 1 def and usually 31-55 pray with attack being either 50, 60, or 75.
---
The basis of a pure is 1 defence AFAIK.
---
it's eye level my dude
---
yes and yes
---
Its the bone crossbow - available after Death of the Dorghuun quest (Something like that)
---
Spend a full day questing for D scim
---
Realize you aren't attack 60
---
Continue ranging slayer tasks with bone bolts
---
I don't think they should get the prayer and gwd protection buffs, but it would be an interesting option in the future.  Maybe sinking a saradomin's light into a piece of the the brothers armor gives you a restored version that doesn't degrade but it loses the buff on any non-safe death and reverts back to it's normal version
---
I am honest but I'm going to be honest and say when I bank and come back and see someone is already killing the boss I just hop, it's less hassle and takes like 10 seconds to find another world.
---
Thats a different argument entirely. This started with saying bloods the way to make money, but the money isnt really relevant.
---
Still can't hop over the draynor wall because I said fuck it instead of doing the diary :'(
---
It does affect fishing rates, so it's worth using the boost, but it's not going to be a massive difference.
---
Tbf the runes yes but the rest.
---
in video games your goals are very clear-cut and you know exactly what to do. not really the case with exercising.
---
Update, OC of tweet is a creator of visual production...does not play OSRS but did like the comment.
---
Can you please explain this more? A second corp "instance" is created on a world if a level 100 iron damages it??
---
Or are there 2 corp beasts per world always or somthing
---
Wat
---
the only actually enjoyable-in-the-moment content is pvm like raids or pvp. the rest is kind of just there to make you feel like you're achieving something on the side. still fun though.
---
Mad props! Congrats! It makes me happy to see posts like this. Best of luck on the quest cape! I hate to even know how much 99 con costs...
---
Grats man! What method for con did you use?
---
Thank you for the tips. I don't use RL but I am playing on resizable vanilla so I have it just big enough i can click the altar and bank within tp range. I may consider 99 crafting, I do feel like one of the parts that slows me down is getting out new rings/necklaces, so if I need half as many rings, that time saved will definitely add up.
---
How long did it take sir? And also, how long did it take to got 90 in the first place?
---
How long?
---
WHAT’S THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL?
---
souls are like 20% more xp/h so 100% worth doing souls over bloods and just raid in the saved time to make a lot more gp. Bloods 90-99 only useful for people unable to raid or ironmemes.
---
I mean, you can still buy it and whack some kids with it xD if you dabble in PvP people will drag it out there sometimes but it's a lot of risk.
---
Oh man, quite a while.  Welcome back man!  Yeah, justiciar is usually just for tanking bosses in teams or on rune dragon alts.  Offensive options are usually preferred.  Cool looking armor, it's just offense is much better in most cases.
---
The meta in deep wildy is completely centered around med levels with rigour. Sure there will obviously be pures, but you're not going to see many if any go deep ever with an update like this. Deep wilderness is just going to be packed completely by a bunch of raggers with max/med level stats just like a tournament world.
---
Will I fail or will I succeed? *proceeds to stab knife*
---
73*
---
Went tent is favored mostly cause of the poison
---
It should make a noticeable difference, gl.
---
\^
---
Dude you kinda suck for that
---
81 crafting? You need 93
---
good thing no one trains rc except me, I expect to make a killing off this for a while
---
Quest reqs and smithing done. Now I just need hunter, con, agi, herblore, wc.
---
Going on a month without a video, settled....I'm getting all antsy in my pantsy.
---
you could set a goal of boss collection log unlocks on a main which is basically the same thing as ironman just without the fucking boring supply grind/farm runs/pot making/angler fishing etc.
---
Possible yeah but people will do anything for an edge
---
SOA CC is where you wanna look
---
&gt;Entire RS community: so wholesome.

&gt;Jagex: Account sharing is illegal, banned for macro major

Except account sharing is no longer against the rules as long as you do not abuse it for hiscores manipulation.
---
How much for the white cape.
---
Trye 😂😂
---
That was how the trading post worked pre-ge. It was aids.
---
Also done ;D
---
Ye i should
---
What advantage could I get from other (non-iron) player using my pool or altar?
---
I can't watch Netflix and do that at the same time.
---
No
---
Just don’t use anything that you feel is overpowered if you wanna be safe. No 1 tick stuff, no menu swappers, no cerb or demonic gorilla plugins if they are still around, ect(the list goes on).
---
pretty sure at least easy clues are 1m or so an hour "efficiently" and I think Beginners are close to that as well.  Obviously Mediums are the best money because how fast you can get them and Rangers.
---
Edit:  Sorry, to answer your question, the reason they are "efficient" as opposed to others is because of how quickly you can farm low tier clues as opposed to higher tier clues.  I think hards you can get from implings, but it is super expensive and not worth it like with mediums.  Elite and Master are just slow/hard to get in general so you cant "efficiently" get them.
---
He’s too dangerous to be kept alive!
---
This is so random. I love it!
---
only retards get internet outages, got it.
---
You'll still get pked as a level 3 doing black chins, and that requires you to get a high total level without raising combat stats anyways. Wintertodt is fast and being level 3 is nice because you only need cakes but 99 fm is fast either way
---
Feels like I'm praying nothing at all*
---
Whats TFW? LOL
---
Cheers, was good fun to help out Puzzle with his gallery :)
---
You semi-afk Zulrah while I have to be trembling and having full focus lol. Best of luck on your grind.
---
I did bloods all the way to 99 because i had an alt uim i was levelling while pretty much afk'ing on my main
---
Legit opted for bloods mainly for the less clicks + longer grind because i wanted to spend more time afk'ing it while levelling the new acc
---
Because people are retarded. 
---
They don’t get “scammed” they just cry that because they don’t fucking read.
---
Thanks for the laughs and the grats! Just chinning the monkeys in mm1 tunnels for 75 range so I can go knock out 69 slayer with a BP and get mm2 done 😜
---
Realk talk my dude, you're 92 agil arent you?
---
imagine not understanding the concept of patience points
---
If you're iron man you dont get DScim for training, you get it bc its BIS for a while
---
Slings that freeze? Sure!
---
DKs is barely above 1m/hr without elite diaries when tribriding offtask. You should be able to get above 80 kph which is approx 63 hrs avg for a pet. Much longer for specific one. Pretty afk if you don't pray flick at all. Long banking every 80 mins.  
---
Rune dragons are about 1.5-1.9m / hr, quite afkable, but no pet chance.  
---
Zulrah is around 2.8m an hr and with 25 kph, 160 hrs for a pet on avg. Not really afkable, but can be fairly low effort with fewer switches (eg. Void, which isn't as good, or no boots/gloves/cape/helm switch), or no effort on switching needed using just a twisted bow, not using mage at all. I didn't like this boss for the first 50 kc. But once I began to anticpate the next form, count my hits left before having to switch gear, and run to the next area before Zulrah moved, it became a lot more enjoyable. On mobile I don't bother with more than a 5 or 6 way switch and I get a little lower kph than on pc.  
---
Vorkath is around 3.2m an hr and with 26 kph, a pet every 115 hours on average. Not really too afk. Less memorization than Zulrah, but with Vorky, messing up can be quite punishing (fireball, spawn, woox phase) and dying costs you 100k.  
---
Godwars bosses - Generally about 3.5m / hr profit to be split between two people. Trio isn't much worse individual profit per hr. If you have alts capable of doing this, that's great, but if you have rune dragons unlocked on them might as well just do that instead. Pet chance is pretty low.  
---
   
---
Corp - Worth looking into if you have a small dedicated group to camping it. Pretty low effort compared to raids or something.  
---
You already know that raids are good, so I won't comment there.
---
"you can never change the speed at which you catch fish, at least not without tick manipulation."
---
Yes you can. harpoon, fishing cape, pie, etc...hence my disagreement
---
Completely agree, almost all of my high level friends burnt out. None of them enjoy hydra or gauntlet. The last thing most of us enjoyed was ToB which came out 1.5 years ago. With no runefest announcement of any big challenging pvm content theres no motivation to keep playing.
---
Guys why are you all bashing this guy for his suggestion?
---
lol what
---
Thought you were talking about Vinland saga
---
Where is this? am noob
---
I mean. I’ll do it
---
Level 59, started collecting marks from around lvl 40
---
Feel like hes wearing nothing at all.
---
Mudkip is a good teacher of all things osrs
---
Why, does that give me an XP bonus or is it purely cosmetic?
---
&gt; Rsjustice
---
isnt really running any more, Runewatch is the new 1
---
Tfw runecrafting is so bad someone has to die for you to train it.
---
Around lvl 65 by doing canafis 40-60 and than seers
---
I wouldn't use rewards, we would still have duel arena for that kind of thing, and pvp worlds for unsafe pk.  Making wilderness a safe death on regular worlds seems like it could make the game more playable/enjoyable for people who only pvm, like dragon farmers for a big example or ent farmers. This would also make things a lot easier for runecrafters and people who do clue scrolls.  Let's face it if you're killing green dragons or something like that any decent pker will get your loot every time if they feel like taking it.  Kinda frustrating.  At the same time this would probably make dragon bones crash in value so IDK.
---
No man, you don't get it. I'm not dissing ironman mode. I'm saying that by only going for the most efficient strategies you are limiting yourselves, and then choosing to complain to the air for forcing you to hamstring your enjoyment of the game. EHP burnout is a self-caused problem. I like to do the efficient methods too, but I don't do so at the expense of my enjoyment. This is still a game.
---
Thanks man! I just hope someone decides they’re willing to teach me haha
---
:dab:
---
does it happen at any other time?
---
I personally wouldn't say shit, but just not enthusiastic. The new BIS helmet quest was literally 20mins, 15mins being a fetch quest and it was listed as master afaik?
---
*62 till you get dsword
---
11kc Zilyana, 237 kc Vorki &amp; 92 kc Snakeling. Pet RNG on fleek :,)
---
Just kill whichever thug he blackjacks until he hops
---
That's subjective though. That's like, just your opinion man.
---
For Muds? Only if you've got 82 Magic and Lunars for Magic Imbue, along with the Balloon routes opened. Figured that was a bit too high an ask for someone just getting into members
---
Nice gpu
---
lol why did this get downvoted?  
---
You reddit nerds always suprise me
---
Lol what? Iron kiteshield with prayer bonus and magic def lmao, and if ur a main acc not defense locked in offhand slot there are much better options for magic def
---
REEEEEPOST
---
Bra gold ore is at its all time low, might wanna check out blast furnace, your older self will love you for it. I still do some may runecrafting even under LVL 91 to balance out click intensity of lavas.
---
What’s it worth to you
---
Sounds like you bought your account
---
He is jacked
---
Wow no drops from Rex? Damn you’re so unlucky :(
---
melee can use halberd remember?
---
Right around 60, did mainly Canifis rooftop course
---
Wait so you got 99 rcing on his account for him?
---
Are there any good combat money making methods that don't involve needing range at all?  I have 70's for att, str, def, and magic but everything needs range that I can find.  My slayer is 35 and I am leveling that up at the moment.
---
Nothing at all
---
I literally made this
---
Forgive me settled for not putting enough time in maxing
---
If you do it right off the bat at level 10 draynor and stick with morytania instead of going to falador at 50, it's about level 56 to 58ish.
---
Fyi morytania gives more Mark's than falador. People choose to stay at morytania because falador is barely better xp.
---
Im really disappointed that not a single number was 69.
---
Would pay good money for this cosmetic. Lolol good shit.
---
Can it count towards Rantz’ chompy hats?
---
this has nothing to do with osrs but that thing is amazing
---
5 lobsters and 5 salmon? Cooked? Cya acc
---
Heavy stuff man. Literally 34kg for a one-handed shiel
---
One sec
---
I always prefer to get graceful later and skip canfis entirely because the xp is so bad. I usually barb fish until I can do seers. Full graceful around 73-75
---
Why are they not holy sandals?... Sarandon bless us all!

Stupid sexy Flanders
---
I feel that seren was easier than galvek. Just brew above your max health.
---
Same ones that make hcs :^)
---
That was mithalin mysteries, yes.
---
You know a skill sucks when an otherwise legit player resorts to botting it.
---
Think about what you asked lol. It would count as a 250. It could also “count” as a 10, 50, 100 etc
---
the angel bobs run i was doing killed my enjoyment so I wanna start a fresh, only slightly modded, run here soon
---
I love gaping my asshole
---
Thats why UIM is so fun, because so few people play it, its still unexplored territory.
---
Currently non-irons can buy it for 1.5m at slayer masters
---
I second the garden. Super chill. Hated underwater thieving but I was also bad at it.
---
Curious why not 126?
---
70.
---
Howdily doodily scaperino
---
Tax the GE
---
Seriously, I would wake up and not fucking do ANYTHING else until like 12 and go, "where did my saturday disappear to"
---
I was doing my task of 15 vetion's as an ironman and didn't get the drop for half of my kills just cause pkers logged in and barrage damaged vetion... then other times even when i kill vetion from full hp solo i STILL don't get the loot, so FRUSTRATING
---
It didnt grab me from the footage I saw, was considering just waiting for it to fully release and look at it then
---
So this is a bot farm
---
Looks like a cave goblin but ok
---
I thought the same thing but after I tried it I was totally sold. It's literally just 3d factorio, without tough enemies. I do kinda wish they made the enemies harder, but the factory making itself is super neat in 3d.
---
Priff is amazing, but if it was like rs3, people would be upset for sure.
---
I also run Vork and one of his fireballs definitely hits through Mage protect + super anti, albeit very low and not often (never over 8 damage.)
---
I’m sorry to have offended you by not blocking my whole screen.
---
That’s just like, your opinion man. Each major OSRS city has dense population spikes in specific areas - Falador has the mining guild, Varrock has the GE, Prifddinas has the Gauntlet and Zolcano, and so on. If worlds were more close to their player maxes, you’d see a lot more people in the areas you’re suggesting are dead.
---
Eating makes you stop shooting, moving makes you stop shooting. Eat once, click once. Move once, click once.

Imagine if you have your hellpuppy out and inv full and you get the pet , yikes
---
Congrats!
---
Basically for f2p since you wouldn't have to worry about arrows, i like the idea
---
Damn man, sorry your RNG is so bad. GZ though!
---
When people voted the GE in, they knew this would happen and people didn't seem to care much
---
The last bit is the most important part people
---
45 seconds=more nests per hour than wcing

Rubies can be stored at the museum curator, they may need to be cut though.

So? The defender gives massive pokey pokey chancetime
---
Karamja Diary... trading gems for machete. Says I need gout tuber... GE price of 900k?! There has to be an easier way to do this.
---
I don't agree at all, people think graceful is way more useful than it is. Graceful doesn't make your run energy drop any slower if you're only carrying a small amount of weight, which you generally are, since having negative weight does nothing. All it does is help your energy regen a bit faster when you're standing still, which you pretty much spend 0 time doing. Most of the time if you're running for long distances then you'll need a stamina potion regardless of whether you're in full graceful or only have 1-2 pieces, and once you sip that stamina potion you can run all the way to your destination no matter what you're wearing.  
---
I'd MUCH rather have access to 10 more shortcuts and have to take a single extra sip of stamina potion occasionally, compared to someone who needs to run huge distances because they didn't have the agility shortcut, but at least they have full graceful to run in...

Which saves more time, hitting 70 agility so you can use the pipe shortcut in the Taverley dungeon, or having full graceful at 65 agility while running all the way around to blue dragons? As far as I can tell the only really good use for graceful is when you need to carry a ton of weight a pretty good distance, like if you're carrying a cannon to a slayer task, but in that setting it's even still not that great because you don't wanna use up 6 inventory spots for your graceful.

Making them into arrows is usually good xp but you'll usually lose money. Making headless arrows, with shafts and feathers, is profitable.

The [Fletching Training wiki page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fletching_training) has a chart of cost and xp of making each arrow so you can decide if any is worth doing.
