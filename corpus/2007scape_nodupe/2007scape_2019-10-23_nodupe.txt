Yeah after 4-500 hours of raids rofl

Chaos altar is total cancer.  Originally I wanted to train my prayer there and got all prepared with a "maxed" setup (hard diary, house obelisk, etc.) for it because I figured it was perfect for me since I play a decent number of hours at very "off" times like 4-6am CT.  But oh how wrong I was.  I don't think I ran a SINGLE inventory without encountering a PKer somewhere along the way and either logging, running, or dying.  I made it around 50 inventories before giving up.  The place is absolutely crawling with them at all hours of the day.  I have no idea how anyone gets any remotely decent xp rate there.  I have to assume that simply no one does.  Unless you're clicking each bone.  Which... yeah fuck that for 13 million xp.
---
Eh, it's about 14% chance. Below average, sure, but not by a huge amount.
---
Add me: Naragun. Getting back into osrs.

I wasn't aware of there being a multitude of accounts that were banned.  Is there any word of accounts being reviewed?

Wow so how much did you pay for that acc? Lmao. Someone with all that complete but has no idea how to make ‚Äúgp‚Äù obvious rwt. Rip.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Hahaha, you funny boy. :p If I had an RS3 account with dyed max gear, you bet your ass I'd RWT the shit outta that bitch. At least I'd have some real money for it then. There is no point in being rich on a game that will go offline in a year, if that, so might as well cash out before it's too late.
---
True it can be pretty bad but at least they have support
---
Gz!

I felt the more damage against large creatures was going for more the "David and goliath" thing what with using a rock to kill a giant.

The difference over unholy book isn't all that much and I'd rather just save for a mage book
---
Jagex does, and that's why they don't allow appeals on those types if bans.
---
This is the issue at hand
---
I‚Äôm assuming by looking at the ring of life in there that this is a ‚ÄúI got the wrong 1/128‚Äù item situation?
---
Just so you know, Rex has about 29 items on his table that are 1/128 meaning 1/5 drops that you get will be 1/128.

Thank you!

Without rangers you make like 100k/hr i think, if not a net loss. Completing 15 clues per hour means you should get rangers every 8-9 hours, which means you really have to commit to it.
---
It's cause pmods are payed to not flag certain bots and to only flag others and accounts get sold/rented some are prolly botting too

Do I need to unlock medium scrolls as a drop from guards? I'm about 1k in and no sign of a scroll.

A jmod said it himself, They give out automated perm bans and its not 100% accurate, You are relying on their epic customer support (that is totally real btw) to notice you among the 15k people they ban like the shining diamond you are among the filth, Don't worry Boneguard, I'm sure you'll stick out next to 8888DDDFHFBH2345 and DickMoveAsh96

Thanks man

not a single pull up was done

Wait can you not see items that were dropped before you log in?
---
How do you not immediately insure just in case?
---
Or just don't be a sweaty nerd and just eat normally
---
Remember, we only hear about bad things. No one is gonna post the typical email chain of a jmod fixing a false positive. Yes, customer service is abysmal and definitely needs a major overhaul, but I think it is still pretty rare for an account to be banned unfairly.
---
Auto detection should flag high total level accounts for a human to determine if it's botting activity, and should not automatically ban the account

Hundreds of hours? Once you hit level 40 go to Blast Furnace and you're golden.

You keep referring back to video evidence; however, most bans happen when you are not logged in.... Just so happens this one did.
---
The video evidence just shows him disconnecting and the ban.
---
What he does off stream is another story.
---
I am entirely out on this one I couldn't care less, but from reading my comments this is my observation.
---
In regards to downvotes... who cares... being like hungry is a burden on our society.
---
Thanks :D
---
The "issue" is that EVscape got unbanned because he was a popular, high ranked player.
---
If I would have been banned for the exact same thing, I'd be fucked and when I appealed on reddit I'd get a "j-mod smackdown" complete with a J-mod doubling down and telling me to go jump in a ditch.
---
That's the "issue" here.
---
There's just something in general i can't stomach with RS3 in general.. everything is so overwhelming .The sounds, visuals.. (The graphic revamp was nice but i cant atke all teh changes to the familiar locations and all the npcs everywhere and confusing shit. I dont know where to start.)
---
Just about a month ago. I got the email from Mod Tattoo saying they read it over and they won't be giving back the account, which is baloney because it was sent to me so quickly and my appeal was pretty long.
---
Anecdote = evidence?
---
Well the fact that they dont address the entire problem IS THE PROBLEM.  When other people get false banned is it addressed?  Do they go on massive unban waves?  Does anyone ever get unbanned without either being a streamer or having to make a reddit post with 3k upvotes?  Hmmmm almost like he only made the comment because of who was banned not because the problem itself.

Fine. I'm weird, you're not. You *know more about computers*, i don't. You visit r/depressedvirgins, i visit.. wait.. One moment. 
---
You're the fucking weirdo here.
---
Here's some innocuous advice. Get off your computer, put on some deodorant, brush your teeth and scrape your tongue, read a couple of books and brush up on your reading skills.. go outside and chances are you probably won't be a depressed virgin anymore.
---
Just please for the sake of humanity, when you do exit your basement.. don't be the guy to shoot up another god damn school. Some people want to actually do something with their lives. You see, not everyone is blessed to be able to have enough free time to kill to browse a subreddit that is the epitome of their lives, such as yourself.

Surely that isn't the only thing you got going for you.. right squirt? Who am i kidding lol. You're probably making 8 figures and fucking my wife.

This is gold, I used to do the menial stuff for my dad. He started after I did but blew past me in months. I'd pick flax and mine coal for hours and he pay me a measly sum that seemed like a lot. Now he just started again and I'm the one that's super far ahead of him.

Yeah I got a 600 hour account with 100mill in gold and stuff that just got a macroing band last week. When I haven‚Äôt been on a over a month. Now I got to appeal it which will take a year or two. Sad times. üò∞

What lol. This has always been the random zone for the frog random.
---
&gt; It's a serious offence and deserves at least a perm mute, if not a perm ban. I've actually lost 2 tbows to this exact scam but I guess the second time was kind of my fault.
---
The serious offense is being dumb enough to drop a 1b item EVER.  RWT thats like $500 and you did it twice.... In no world am I dense enough to drop that in a *PvP World* probably not even in a regular one.
---
In his defense I've lost 4 tbows with this scam.

That's probably a little low actually

Exactly :(
---
That's pretty much what I've realized, my xp rates are trash because of pkers, I have no idea how anyone can get 800k xp/hr there. I can do dragon bones at chaos altar for 4 gp/xp or ensouled dragon heads for 6.3, or ensouled abyssals for 5.7, with consistent xp rates instead of getting forced off after 2 inventories because a clan came. I get melee and mage xp with heads as well.
---
I'm 94.8 prayer now, it's around 22m for 99 prayer with d bones assuming I don't get pked, It's 28 for abyssal heads and 33m for dragon heads. Honestly it's mad tempting to just not deal with the cancer in exchange for a extra few hours at Hydra. There's assholes who will pk you, then sit there and wait for you to come back to kill you again for another 40k in bones. It's so fucking toxic.
---
so controversial, yet so brave
---
Imagine not drinking water
---
I purposely be toxic to people in game because everyone trys so hard to be offended all the time. 90% of toxic people wilp talk to you normally if you speak to them in the right way.

If you get tbed you just go up and down kbd ladder for 2.5 mins while spiders and lesser demons pj anyone who tries to attack you then you pull the lever and leave. It's so easy to not die there that you can basically consider kbd a safe boss.

He just posted the loot from 16k eclectics. Nowhere in the original post does he say anything about it being good/consistent money

It‚Äôs a cancer that needs to be quashed.

After a certain amount you kind of get them memorized.

Yeah! The whole fucking point of pking! You just said it yourself. Glad we can finally agree. And I m sure if they were that concerned of kissing their gear they wouldn't be pking in the first place
---
This is true, but it just means I used up my rng and you've got yours saved up
---
I look forward to this post every month!

Yep - I still have an account that is currently perm banned from 2008 for a false positive

You are the one conflating this post. You are drawing generalizations on streamers from one person being helped. How do you know this mod was working while he was watching this stream? You get over yourself and your need to blow up a beautiful bit of technical assistance into hateful discrimination.
---
Bruh arthritis is real
---
We all quit due to this happening to one of the guys in our group. This was before the removal of the wilderness in 07. A few of us have had spells playing again but nothing major. It's a shame to go out like that.
---
It's just the normal yearly movement of scales, it's happened before.
---
Do you have untradeable drop notifications on?
---
Just sounds like a free sceptre to me
---
I would grind slayer. And get farm up to where you can grow ranarrs/snapdragons, basically free money.  (Do the farm runs between slayer tasks so it doesnt feel boring)
---
Just added you man, when I see you on I'll shoot you a message
---
The general consensus would be just grind slayer and eventually it becomes really good money when you can boss and kill high level monster.  As for now I would recommend doing Barrows for money and getting the Morytania hard diaries done if possible to make more money at Barrows.  
---
Some good account goals would be to do all easy achievement diaries then medium then hard etc. or a Quest cape.   Evenutally getting 83 construction is super nice for having a "max house" and all that entails.  So for now Barrows for money and then slayer when you feel like it.  
---
Side note:  Do you already have D defender and a torso?  If not those are good goals as well.
---
Of course you did because Jagex's bot detection is flawless.  That's why they raised membership prices- to use their funds to perfect the ultimate bot detection system that doesn't let ANY real bots get through like those BET and UID gambling bots (operated by one person btw).  It's so good, it detected your inherent sin and banned you preemptively.  It's unfortunate that you were born tainted.
---
It's actually hilarious that Jagex is held by the balls of those gambling bots and literally can't do anything to stop them.  Gambling bots have become so synonymous with the GE and Jagex can't stop one person from doing it.
---
Don't log out, if I do fuck me.
---
Thats even more frightening for false positives. If it can happen to a streamer it can happen to anyone. Hes lucky he is a streamer otherwise he would have had to fight to get that revoked. Because huehue no appeal.
---
Thats the whole reason everyone is upset. They said false positives do happen, its apparent they do(in some small miniscule amount). And they are perma bans with "no real appeal" for accounts with thousands of hours and money. Yeah you can go on social media but wouldn't it be better to just not have false positives or have a better system which allows for systematic proof to prove innocence.
---
I'd just use them in all bossing scenarios, and normal super combats for everything else
---
If you know about the scam sure. Sceptre used to not be 1-click teleport though so this has the potential to fool a lot of people.
---
I use them when pre-potting for TOB and COX. If I'm doing slayer I just use regular pots + preserve and repot at 110/118.
---
He said in one the first GIMP video that someone made an overlay for them in runelite
---
Are you the only one to update this collection, or should I follow somebody else?
---
and everyone would be commenting ‚Äújmod smackdown incoming!!!‚Äù
---
I'm not, I got confused with the phrasing on the clue, it said gnome green robe top and that's not what it goes by on the GE. I realize now I could've gotten it off the ge, but I didn't then lol
---
The upper level veins decay with time rather than number of ores mined so it doesn't matter if you have multiple people mining the same vein because it will decay at the same rate.
---
Yep I've already got my d defender and torso done
---
sadly, false bans happens all the time and jagex never undoes it
---
No idea how to do farming I'll look into it though :)
---
Except Jagex have no interest building a decent client.
---
Gonna throw in my two cents.
---
I got perm banned on a prior account with "no chance to appeal" on the appeal section. However, I still sent a message through Jagex's site. I provided info including my IP addresses I've used while playing the game, past passwords, and links to pictures I had while leveling up etc. The ban was repealed by the following week, assuming that they saw that the ip was from a different country and probs not me. Granted this was back in like 2007ish so things may have changed.
---
Second time was just a normal ban with a chance to appeal. First appeal got rejected because I couldn't remember all of my info (this was when I was getting back into OSRS and hadn't played in years and... yeah didnt remember everything) but the second appeal with mostly corrected info was accepted and boom, everything was Gucci. 
---
Like I said, things might be different now, but I dont think things are as bad as everyone made it out to be. I never had to resort to twitter or anything.
---
I got banned only a couple years ago because I cut 20k+ magic logs to get to 99 fletching. It was my fault. I stood in the same spot for hours without logging, zoomed in on my bank slot and inventory and just grinded for hours and hours other than the auto timeout. 
---
Scared the shit out of me so now I try to change things up and move around more so I don‚Äôt get flagged like that. Couldn‚Äôt believe I got banned.
---
Lmao not if you chill at brutal black dragons like I do
---
I have crazy amounts of totems and shards
---
I start with construction because construction has the most content unlocks post-90. Go ahead and check, it's a fact. Every single level you get something new and a lot of them (read: Ornate Jewellery Box, Ornate Rejuvination Pool, Fairy Ring + Spirit Tree) are very good.
---
You complained about not having anything new to unlock at the later levels. I dismantled the basis for your complaint.
---
Already being done, next idea please
---
Press Fluorine to pay respects
---
I dont think that you get that "Macroing Major (ban)" is completely UN-APPEALABLE. It literally says that when you go to details of the offense.
---
That is the whole problem here.
---
I know!!..I've literally reset my password 3+ timesand keep on getting "Invalid credentials" after I just restarted my password..At one point it said my account probably got stolen, but it didn't give me a email or number...this is complete bs...My account wasn't a giant account with billions of gp...it was just a simple freaking account..üò°üò°

Is NMZ a net positive game? If i am using dharoks with absorbs will i make back my points that I used on absorbs?
---
To be honest I never tried to get my account back through Reddit, but people shouldnt need to go to a THIRD PARTY WEBSITE in order to appeal. I was banned and tried to through their avenues and couldnt even get any contact info besides making a new account which led nowhere.   
---
Because there was no legit way back when mine got banned I moved on with my life. Is it really unrealistic to think that it could have fallen to the side? Especially when I thought there was no other place to do it.
---
Do you not know what anecdote means karam?

I would assume 126 has the most internal capes.

same lost my 1500 Total UIM a month ago. Im trying to get it appealed
---
At least u got the butt plug
---
i mean i just got a false ban this weekend. honestly either this happens all the time or something happened to their system recently
---
I don't expect you to believe me but maybe... i run a bunch of accounts and never received a ban before, and i have an untrimmed mining cape. I got hit with a perma ban and am accused of using 3rd party botting software..
---
all i did was keep clicking with my left hand on my laptop.. thats the only thing you have to do to alch. 
---
i sent in an appeal but the message they give you doesn't instill hope. I didn't lose thaaat much cash, just the $$$ and alchables they had on them, but I might stop playing altogether because of it, just feels like whats the point if you can just get bopped outta nowhere. 
---
[the message](https://i.imgur.com/Puz4inl.png)
---
Even if you have it all recorded, there's no way to appeal with that recording. Customer support is nonexistent.
---
I think we are actually getting some update to the clan system soon. It was engine work

I've been playing since release of osrs and you still have higher hunter than me

What was April?

Just pointing out that the defining feature of an element comes down to its number of protons.
---
Literally everyone I know that plays runescape has never been banned because of a false positive. The internet has the tendency to make things seem more common than they really are. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt let that stop you from enjoying the game, but if you want to stress about time you haven‚Äôt even spent yet, then so be it.
---
Yes definitely. You make back the money of a full dh set repair, from the herb boxes as well.

I find his videos really entertaining alongside Linksocarina and Rargh, not sure why ev gets so much hate on this sub

This..this picture brings joy to the 10 year old me, just need the mini clip border
---
That's not necessarily how he died. That is a custom message he paid to have broadcasted if he ever died. According to the person who runs this Twitter account, he set that message in November 2018 so he almost certainly didn't die to flicking DH.
---
PvP backwards still spells PvP, I don't understand.
---
i really hope so because i just got hit with a perma ban on my new f2p alcher... feels pretty lame man. I don't bot thats stupid, what is stupid is banning my super cool alcher [:(](https://i.imgur.com/Puz4inl.png)
---
Replied to clarify, but that custom message was set last November so probably isn't the real reason.
---
Double checking now and I'm not even sure if it was submitted by the account owner... &gt;_&gt;

Friend is better than some random person I guess, my bad for not double checking that they actually owned the account.
---
NMZ is as afk as splashing, and gives you rates of over 120k/hr if you include hp exp. Should we change every skill to be like that?

Rip XD

replying because I would also purchase.

10/10 waiting to get my stolen acc back but it won't ever happen because fuck me so.

I made a mining pure around 10 y/o too. but it also had one of those shitty pker names from back in the day like xx whateverthefuckiput xx

Then somebody in Varrock East bank said ‚Äúlook everyone your password gets censored if you try to say it! **********‚Äù and ya damn right I said it and got hacked and pass changed the next time I logged out lmfao
---
Unironically denied
---
Smug little kid acting superior on reddit then completely walks back his original point. Fuck off little kid and go troll somewhere else
---
Yeah, unfortunately most of them are :/
---
Patience is key especially when flipping 3rd age items. At the very least you didn't lose much.
---
A lot of it is explained in the comments already -- but long story short, with OSB, they made the executive decision to release some plugins that were so busted for training various skills and put all of third party clients on the hot seat again.   
---
They basically know they are going down and want to take Runelite and others with them.
---
At this point, its not about EV. Its about how often FPs happen and how often they arent appealable.
---
Jagex is banning innocent accounts and not letting people unban them. EVscape was unbanned because he was live and someone at jagex saw and unbanned him. Most of these bans arent live and dont have someone at jagex to witness them.
---
Meaning at any given time, you could be at risk of losing your account.

Idk there are a lot of inferno capes in the game now. The average is definitely far below 126, especially with all the zerkers and pures in general that have it now

Just a side note, I think there's a big problem with alcoholism in the OSRS community we kinda just don't talk about. Like, I love the guys in my CC but they are always downing a brew or two... dozen

And it's obviously not isolated to the cc, it's rampant amongst content creators as well.

That said, most of being good at raids is just attacking as frequently as possible and not being slow between rooms so you can be a competent raider with a rapier or blade until you can afford a scythe. 
---
Scaling is not an issue as the raid scales to the highest player so as long as you have one person 115+ you're good
---
How is making clothing related to making runes??
---
B
---
Correct, gigachad osrs-player is too efficient to maintain relationships with in-game friends
---
Definitely worth it.
---
While having an extra free inventory slot would speed up the xp rates by 3.7%, I think it would be absolutely pure qol if it didn't free up an invent. Perhaps it requires the ice gloves in inventory still to operate as ice gloves.
---
Make it have a cost to use or high quest requirement and it will definitely not always be used
---
Same with my almost maxed pure. Appeal was denied. Same copy pasta that they told the streamer. Gl man
---
Ban me
---
Yeah, but why would you accidentally not log out if you‚Äôre at a location in which you could get into combat?? I wouldn‚Äôt even do that on a regular account never mind a HARDCORE IRONMAN.
---
Look at the mod sween thread, or at the front page of this sub at any given time. The truth is is that several people have been falsely banned. There are thousand of people on this sub, many with several accounts. If a handful of people havent been banned, that doesnt mean there isnt a problem.
---
Very cool. 10/10. Ill bet your next pet wont be the mole rat though lol.
---
In any case the blade has dropped by 100m+ since release so profits must be lower. We'll find out next week when they release the Gauntlet drop rates.
---
&gt;profitable
---
Eclectics for mediums are only profitable when you get ranger boots
---
this guy hasn‚Äôt smoked crack

They‚Äôll refund you. I got a refund recently after buying membership, playing for 30 minutes, and requested the refund two weeks later.
---
Baja blast is gross
---
Feathers are now the defacto currency of f2p
---
More than I ever achieved in multiple years.
---
One of the best mmos I‚Äôve ever played in terms of pvp was called helbreath and came out around the same time as runescape. The death mechanic would randomly choose an item that would be lost on death. However, if you had something called a zemstone, that would drop instead of an item. So of course the zems were in huge demand and basically became a currency and were random drops from mobs. Everyone pvpd because you weren‚Äôt risking your bank to join in.. so much fun lol
---
it was going up pretty consistently either way, way before crystal pick was added.
---
wildy bosses are not popular bosses and dragon pickaxe is something really everyone needs, for both pvm and skilling
---
I'm 2 k on task basilisk kc.

Wow. Using a stylus gets you banned now. Thanks, Jagex.

Absolute legend! You're doing God's work
---
Yall have friends that play runescape?
---
Im sad, my friend tried it, said the graphics were bad. After I told him that its called "Oldschool" for a reason and it was 20 years old he asked when Oldschool came out. I said 2013 and he keeps talking over me when I try to explain the game is a BACKUP. He said that I suck at the game, that pking is easy, all you do is click. He tried tutorial island, after saying nothing except that the game sucks, and making fun of me for playing it. He got to giant rats, I tought him how to mine and smelt, we got hyped up, i thought he might actually have fun. The chatbox said to talk to the instructor, you know where this is going. After like a minute of him trying to open the door, he proclaimed it just "wasnt for him".
---
&gt; AHK
---
Default windows mouse keys are allowed, remapping, and 1:1 input. How is he using AHK? All he did was remap keys and use default windows mouse keys. Which they explicitly said are allowed.
---
Though I got 2 day banned for default windows mouse keys and when I messaged Mod Ash on Twitter he told me, "not my job" then suggested some people I can message who literally never replied.
---
So... JaGeX.
---
Their AHK update post explicitly says default windows functions and remapping are allowed.
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/mouse-keys---changes--clarification?oldschool=1
---
Idc about my ban, it's 2 days, whatever. But if they can't manage allowing windows settings, then they need to update their damn post and say use at your own risk, because I read it before using. Same thing in his vid, a Jmod literally told him he's allowed to do that he shows it around 8:50.
---
its much shorter laps than fally/varrock, its less that canafis is good and more that those two are shit
---
Banned for hijacking, possibly major offense.
---
Those arent appealable I believe.
---
Clue items have generally good margins but take a long while. Something something eggs in 1 basket. Diversify.

Yo whaat
---
Relieved to hear about the scaling thing! I was worried from reading older posts. Ferocious gloves would be nice but such is life. Scythe is definitely my top priority for upgrades, and hopefully would get me started on doing ToB. As a "poor" player I was very excited when the scythe crashed, but It's still sooo much money for me. I feel like the only way I could get that much GP is via CoX. 
---
I feel confident in becoming competent eventually but of course "top level content" has some of the most elitism around it so I get nervous I'll be laughed out so I want to at least appear prepared when I start.
---
This nibbler got that $5 box
---
"Whip and DDS combo... 20-20.... 20-20..."
---
l-m-a-o
---
Ya but then I'd have to do quests and a crappy minigame.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect much from mine, until I got the parrot worth around 220k
---
I got false VACed once,took me 15 minutes to reclaim my account back
---
Still got chills from that day
---
You need that ring of recoil for when that ass claps back
---
Did you not read what I said? the prices on the wiki automatically update. The average shown on the wiki is up to date with current prices
---
yeah that jmod reply was such a joke.
---
you are literally acknowledging errors exist in the same reply where you are saying the only way to appeal is if your acc was hijacked during this period. like obviously it's not on this single jmod, its the team and the company at fault, but seriously its sad as fuck.
---
the recovery system needs to be safer. a 1-3 day delay would protect the most high end accounts- the ones which are actual targets of social engineering -&gt; attempts at recovery. this should be an opt in similar to bank pin, similar to the lock on ironman mode. obviously this change would only affect a small % of the very dedicated playerbase, however these social engineering recovery hacks only target that playerbase in the first place.
---
macro bans need to either be more certain, or have a means for very dedicated players to get another look at their account (as to not flood the system with tickets from suicide gold farmer bots). a player who has a decent total level should be entitled to a second review after a ban, even if it's just a short one. similar to the threads on reddit, where you get a reply from a jmod that simply says "hey, i double checked and our ban was correct", or "hey, we fucked up yo." Yeah, jagex has said all bans like this get manual review but **it absolutely doesnt seem like thats good enough**.
---
these are two real big problems right now.
---
The Varrock diaries give you free money each day in the form of reduced cost battlestaves. If you wanted to pick one to do first that one is great!
---
I'm also 400 dry on Rangers, stay strong and I wish you luck my brother.
---
Honestly i think u can train it to do that + not bannable just have it recorded
---
1. Transportation Incantations book in the Arceuus library unlocks the Kourend Teleport spell, puts you right at the statue. 
---
2. Finishing Architectural Alliance miniquest (100% favour in all 5 houses) unlocks the Xeric's Heart teleport on the Xeric's talisman, which puts you in the same spot.

do you realize hosting a PS isn't just downloading bunch if files and pressing run?

It felt good seeing a new sub on my notifications!! Dude I love your feedback. I was trying to get away with doing what the big content creators do. Also, yeah, it felt bad blocking the chat box. I'll totally fix this. Thanks for everything man! Looking forward to streaming tomorrow :)
---
It had to be said, thank you
---
Nice account :) Impressive KC! I've been slowly grinding and soon I'll have nothing better to do but raids :) glad to hear its tons of fun.
---
What's been your go-to melee weapon especially starting out? and what do you use now for melee? Any thoughts on how you've been avoiding defense XP on long range like in vespula/olm?
---
Got them for my second task on my iron man account, not especially fun for a low level like me
---
Thank you for suggesting these things. I've looked into the white balance before and I tried turning it a bit yellow to off set the blue, and it totally messed everything up in a way that it didn't in the tutorials. So weird. And also... I think you're right - I think I'm mixing my lighting with incandescent and LEDs.
---
Disagree. It may have a minor affect but its not "The reason" Otherwise the trend in price increase would be consistent since the release of SOTE which isnt even almost the case.
---
Who uses relics on rc?
---
buddy I‚Äôll tell you right now there‚Äôs a good amount of words that can definitely break your bones
---
how is his prayer been switched on and off continiously isnt even looking at the screen
---
Not really if we expand it to rune binding which is functionally enchanting. Technically now it's enchanting magic receptive rock.
---
I like the XP idea
---
he is not really that easy compared to hespori he is really hard
---
Legit couldn't get 15 more kc for 1337?
---
rune boots are better then climbing boots.
---
Part of me was expecting castle wars wall tbh. Gz on the 99!
---
Seen worse names running around. Also ive had an acc that was permed for rwt and botting unbanned.
---
You gonna try for the remaining 3 uniques and finish med clues?
---
I feel personally attacked
---
What even is this photo?
---
Use the support page which has an appeal option for bans that don't have an appeal option on the account page, make a reddit post, or tweet Support and/or JMods that work in anti-cheating.
---
bummer.  at 99 agility I only had 3 squirrel rolls.  senpai pls teach me how to get max squirrel rolls within 20k xp and all dragons too
---
I actually made an ironman alt and did a tiny bit on it (really not much, got up to wintertodt and then took a break). Tried logging into it about a month and a half later and it was disabled for macroing. Either the account was hijacked (really dunno how it could've) or it was another false positive but either way I just made a new one.
---
As a side note. Those chairs are wildly uncomfortable and in no way practical for desk usage. Source: me.
---
Me too I use to lure a lot on multiple accounts. Plus don‚Äôt forget one of my rsn was Whitepower and another was kkk. Loved luring on that combo it made me laugh.
---
I don't support child labor, I buy my Nike from adults.
---
I don't see the community cancelling their subs over this sooo... why would they care?
---
Because melee armor has very high range defense and negative magic defense.  Vorkath's magic attacks are near guaranteed to hit in melee armor, but there's a big chance of blocking the range attack
---
Turns out 200m agility and fishing is easier than 2 hunter.
---
&gt;training pretty sweaty?
---
Huh, never heard it put that way. Tbh I kinda like it haha
---
Lemme pet all the doggos
---
Been like this for the last 18 years
---
Basically look at the ‚Äúslayer monsters‚Äù above like a 60 slayer req, those are the monsters that swill make you money. 
---
It gets really good when you can kill gargoyles and above
---
Well. Never going to the bottom of security stronghold again
---
Rainbow boots suddenly not worth it anymore
---
How is your construction lvl so high?
---
And me having just put an offer in for 15k of em
---
Exactly, this guy gets it.
---
/u/JagexTyran you sure your bot detection systems are actually working correctly?
---
Well kinda yes but not really, anyway thats where i got the idea
---
You can never just quit osrs
---
That's Op.
---
$11 isn‚Äôt much for the amount of hours you‚Äôll play in a month maybe take one of them off to pay for it
---
Woah, that was way more comprehensive than my question/suggestion.
---
Big support for slayer enchantment being used.
---
The alternative I proposed was perhaps make the imbues buy able with Larran's keys
---
It‚Äôs incredibly easy to make 6m in 2 weeks.
---
Neither was warding and it‚Äôs still there. Polled and failed with no BS. ZMI triggered people for a day before they found out lavas were better with runners
---
(Unlucky at Zulrah) less than 1500 kills (2 pet drops)
---
Symbols, case sensitivity, numbers is all bullshit. If you wanna strong password make it 20 chars long. That completly protect you from bruteforce.
---
I don‚Äôt mind the price, just hope it doesn‚Äôt discourage game growth
---
I understand that it's not correct for this type of stuff to be advertised, but how does it make you go to the effort of doing this, or even disturb you? Genuinely curious because when I see it, its not even thought about
---
This would screw over a lot of real players. Say a gold seller is selling an item so he buys a tbow with his gold to trade away the tbow. The guy who sold him the tbow is now out a tbow cuz the money was marked.
---
Not really.  You sound cynical.  I don't mean that as an insult.
---
BiS tbh

It‚Äôs got way better.  It‚Äôs not even worth botting accounts unless it‚Äôs gold farming that you plan on replacing every week

What on earth even is account hijacking. lol
---
Probably next update, any later and it'll be after actual halloween lol
---
Yeah no 45 def 75 atk is trash. Most of the ones in my clan chat regret it.
---
no not all of warding. runecrafting for crafting runes used to combine with robes made from crafting and then magic to merge the two.
---
This is true. Biggest reason is I want to upgrade to an occult altar ;__; if I didn‚Äôt drop as much as I did on my house I‚Äôd say I could just do it over again on a new acc lol
---
Fine. I'm weird, you're not. You know more about computers, i don't. You visit r/depressedvirgins, i visit.. wait.. One moment.

---
I feel like in a couple days r/2007scape is just going to be full of homoerotic pictures with fake quotes
---
Aim for monkey madness 2. Make its skill and quest reqs your current goal. Youll end up training a bit of def before then anyway. The mm2 tunnels are insane for bursting and chinning. Its like 170k def xp an hour when i started with sort of low stats.
---
&gt; but in that case jamflex would issue a statement letting everyone know there was a big breach
---
That's only if Jagex is aware of the breach. Even then, they might not even share for months. There have been cases of data breaches were the company has not informed the public for almost a year.

might as well go med at that point bud

Just as long as that wet nice pussy doesn‚Äôt lure you to the deep wildy you‚Äôll be fine
---
i ruined my 60 attacl zerker with 1800 total regret it to this day by getting attack but med is so kuch better than 75 attack zerker, absolutely shits on them
---
Then dont play
---
If you want a perfect tank, dont go over 148 attack and strength combined, I would suggest 75 attack 73 strength, then you can use t75 weapons... and you can slay with a tent on defensive or somewhere along those lines. 
---
^ alternative to the obvious burst/barrage comment
---
Yeah definitely wish I had 60 att still. Meh gonna sleep on it before I finish the quest. Can always just bank the head and do other stuff in the mean time
---
Idk it is strange but u can revert crystal pick and get ur d pickaxe back
---
id stay 1 defence ags sotd on 1 defence is fun is fuck lol
---
the exact rates aren't known right?
---
10mins later jagex shuts down
---
Runelite doesnt have any additional access than any other client.  If runelite developers can add plugins, any player can.
---
I was just joking haha. Go for it and ofc enjoy the adventure.
---
give it 5 years and it'll be the same
---
Exact rates haven't been released, big pvm clan called oblivion is saying it's somewhere around 1/750-800 from their dataset.
---
Better than a battlestaff and runes at least!

hey just replying here to let you know its more than just a small amount of players. 2 people in my group are encountering this issue.
---
why not just play Ironman if this is your mentality, everything is untradable.
---
Leather body is about an average beginner clue in terms of median value
---
Probably cowl, I've gotten two worth 3gp and 2gp

Like 99% of operating systems don't allow random ass programs to look at your open processes without running them as administrator. This is why I can clearly see that you are talking out of your ass. Lmfao

huh. I have one from 2010 that was permabanned no appeal for "macroing". I was just alching a lot manually.
---
Please stfu
---
Each account has each other addef
---
This, but when I did the quest I think I had either 5 or 7 agility levels above the req and it wasn't as aggravating as people say it was.
---
1gp for beginners has been done a lot. Last time the rewards were for an easy clue
---
banned
---
Wow cowls have skyrocketed in price
---
I done this end of last year, i forgot it was a different link. I tried 3 accs. 1st was unbanned same statement as your, i botted huntet for 2 hours in 2004. 2nd acc they said was highjacked when the offences happened so also unbanned. The 3rd i actually botted it 24/7 for a few weeks before it got perm banned.. that stayed banned. Thanks op for posting this, everyone upvote the post and spread it around.
---
It's too much to be honest. I could grind it out, but I don't want to. If the prices keep going up, then eventually you won't be able to. Banks will be hit hard. Some would have to liquidate their items for bonds. I'm sure there's some that have. People asking for a bond and will pay them back in members items. 
---
       Bonds will either go up due to scarcity, because if no one buying them anymore and selling them, then the gold will just waiting to be exchanged as players trade for bonds at 4 mil. Hoping they go down at prices they are familiar with. Or their gold will sit in the bank. So that would create a Flat exchange. Because nobody really wants to pay a lot for a bond. Then the worth of gold and items will probably go down more. Bonds will be worth even more. 
---
         New players could instantly get more gold for their buck eventually one day. The ratio between bond and gold we have now will be even bigger by a huge margin. Imagine 10-20mil for a bond. And as they play they'll make more gold through items.
---
         While there will be some items for bossing (Zulrah scales) that will go up because there's some players that want to do that, and can afford to buy bonds with money and by sitting on their gold after all these years. But eventually it will run out. Prices will eventually creep up as they keep playing and there won't be players to fill that void as they quit, or have taken a break waiting for that sweet 4 mil bond.
---
       It again depends if players do buy bonds though. Or even members to sell their stuff back into the economy.  Giving a boost to other players that skill and bringing the less used stuff back up. If they keep playing and even more new players join then it could sustain itself. Maybe eventually lower the bond prices. 
---
      Or could it be the market shifting after the bot bans? Main accounts that don't need much gold to level up as they are reaching max levels?  New players, even players that renewed membership will need to find better ways to make money and sell items as they do to keep the game going.  Can't let sit in the bank.  
---
I'm also going to assume players will turn to runecrafting, or to get more nature runes from drops. Because a lot of players do alch. Even in f2p. Dragon bones have gone up as well. Players do work on prayer at gilded houses. But if nobody is getting them then the prices will go up as the demand for prayer levels go up.
---
Good luck grinding for it on f2p. You'll be at it a long time.
---
Also rs3 has more players online than osrs right now. You need more players.
---
Same thing happened to several people i know. Have only been using the generally used clients (Osbuddy &amp; Runelite) and recieved Macro Major bans. Fucking sad.
---
well my orn pool is like top right from my entrance. my glory is in the room right from my entrance point. its a shorter walk and a left click very close to anbank. my jewlery box on the other hand is in the room left from my pool in the top right corner. while still being near togethet with my fairy ring, i simply prefer edge as its muscle memory by now
---
60% on 2x2... if u see that fire surge and time of fire already obliterate bandos... this will do ot more lol
---
Neither do i but you can see the burn marks.
---
can we get more focus on minigames perticularly on getting soul wars to osrs or atleast a minigame similar to it.
---
It sure was 200iq when it was original

Yeah this.

Upvoting for jmod/community smackdown
---
So many big bois on RS these days :)
---
Time for conspiracy theories: What if the JMod intentionally banned EVscape while he was testing out new content and thus had a high viewercount, all to bring to attention these fake bans? This brave JMod risked his job to hopefully force Jimflex to finally add customer support.
---
morally more ethical.
---
But what if evscape was macroing before he went streaming??? Think about that.
---
Yea some peoples irl time is worth more to them than in-game time. Weird right? Almost like some people have a life and a job.

Meh, at this point we could just call hardcore ironmen everywherebutwildy-only ironmen.
---
I haven't checked in a while, but Wilderness Slayer has been around 300 Slayer Points/Hour, that in itself should be more than enough reason to bring PVMers into a PKing zone.
---
Who says hes quitting=
---
Hahaha I‚Äôm sorry. Quality was pretty shit
---
its not about the time investment, its stream clips with webcam/branding on, then rambling and monologuing without a direction for 15 minutes and no useful information in the video description.  
---
you watch it and then wonder - was that a good use of 15 minutes? or was that the same pattern produced segment that everyone else does with no original spin?
---
Could this be looked at even as a add-on in bh &amp; pvp servers since thats where pk accounts are most likely to be ruined in action?
---
1 Clicking the attack styles is even more irrelevant now that attack styles are saved for weapons.

unbanning

My total bank is at 750 ish, I do have most items except for ances bottoms. Which one is the best to go for?

please completely scrap these "player bounties"

Okay. But lots of people have issues.

Don't you know you have to press down+B to make sure you catch stuff successfully?
---
The tiktok indian cut. Very modern
---
It's fine to use in rs3 as most worlds are dead anyway and you have abilities called surge and bladed dive. If you dont know wtf they are, they are abilities that allow to teleport a few squares ahead. Them two combined, That's why its viable in RS3... you can also use anticipate to prevent being rooted. I know as I did this to get 120 rc using bloods. Good news 1 to 99 in osrs is same as 1 to 120 rc with mtx spam. Bad news news is rc is still a skill...
---
But in osrs, you get attacked randomly as it is, and this would hurt normal players too as it would cause pkers to just camp abyss. And no-one is getting any rc done then.
---
Bruh my balls are quacking buddy

Back in the day you were supposed to wear rune legs since d legs were 2.5m
---
 w
---
That makes sense. Whilst not maybe the most intuitive thing for new players, it's more aimed at veterans and as such, giving new players a level playing field. 
---
I updated my post to include "buffs" to mix up the tasks. Rather than "kill your opponent with magic" you may sometimes get "10% extra magic damage" for that target. As always, optional of course
---
IIRC removing wilderness emblems means ironmen can't get the magic shortbow/ row upgrade scrolls through wildy slayer, which previously you could. This is probably a way to counteract that deficit. If you think about it those upgrade scrolls are a bit more difficult to get for ironman accounts now, since thay are placed along with slayer enchantment drop rates.
---
Triple my bank ;-;
---
You're forgetting all of the quality of life updates done so ironmen wouldnt have a tough time. Imo ironmen should not have access to all items anyway since it's a limited game mode.
---
nope, just hobbie and fun :)
---
ty man, i apreciate it ! keep the grind and the healty life ! haha
---
Bounty Hunter has been losing players consistently for a long time so we wanted to introduce extra incentives and general improvements - we've fixed some things between the gameplay changes like the PJ timer, minimum requirements and locator arrow. 
---
We expect players to be buying kills far less or at least it'll be more expensive than before because of how much a kill would be worth. We're making sure IMs won't have early access to late game supplies or anything like that through this rework.

Who is banned for using plugins? Got a link?

I suppose we do...

wait thats illegal
---
&gt; Maybe they both drop half a key which you combine?
---
Something like that yeah. Should be mentioned that only a few people would actively kill both (only ice giants are f2p, and only fire giants are a common slayer task), so maybe other fire/ice creatures could drop their relevant key half as well, just with a lower drop rate.
---
Its like 7am and I could absolutely fucking instasmash some Doritos Locos Tacos with a rock hammer right now.
---
the veng kill is good, the no body / leg is good, the not using prayers / super pots is bad. My recommendation is get two kills without leaving the wilderness I'm not sure if it has been suggested yet, but if it was I second it.
---
It's a possibility, we're just not keen on creating discontinued items (the Archaic emblems), even if they're untradeabale. All the old BH items will stay on the shop, but like other minigames, if you want access to them, you'll need to play it.
---
I was a real bad boy back then

I legit must be blind. I dont get what the A or the W is supposed to be
---
He also appealed the ban already and was told there wasn't a mistake. so why jump on the bandwaggon again?
---
I know this may sound stupid but why should new bosses give new BIS gear? The fact that this is constantly the case is just contributing to power creep. Yes new gear is needed occasionally but if its at the same rate as new bosses/content is added then doesn't that defeat the point of this being oldschool? Imo it then just becomes a different direction that rs3 could have taken. I like the idea that some of the drops can be better than the current most used items but not bis or even that that aren't as good as things like black d'hide but have unique points that give the game more diversity. Isn't 5 niche armour sets that are grood in specific circumstances better than 1 or 2 blanket BIS sets?
---
Tl:dr why not niche armour instead of BIS to prevent power creep and provide diversity
---
The one for getting two kills without leaving is already in the beta :) and we agree the Prayers one was overbearing - we think changing this to "No overheads" is more reasonable. The "No supers" one is already reduced from "no potions". It seems fairer since you can still use boosts from other potions.
---

---
Where did he post? I cant find a jmod response.
---
This is monkey madness
---
So just in regards you example, what if he was pming someone he knew as a joke from a different account and didn't actually scam and was going to give the stuff back? if the jmod insta baned the same way they insta unbanned that would also be unfair.
---
The point of this situation is that human error is a thing, but Jamflexs' view is that the automated system doesn't make mistakes and you can't appeal is complete contrary to it being possible for human error.
---
There is no way players can help grow the company, thats up to jagex to do things right, ask yourself this, if they banned you incorrectly with no way to appeal it would you start a new account? because i certainly wouldn't, I would never give them any of my money. realistically they need to change how the automated system works or loosen up on the appeal process
---
I'm not suggesting they'd be discontinued, I'm suggesting that Archaic emblems (or their reflavoured equivalent, which all current Archaic emblems would turn into) stay in the game and stay obtainable through Wilderness Slayer. If it's an issue that tier 2-10 emblems are now discontinued, a date could be given for their deletion if they are not turned into points by that point.

If you type in the search bar on the rs homepage "appeal a ban" you can send a ticket in and they will respond within the week via email.

Would be fun if you assigned specific weapons; kill your next target with a dragon longsword, mace, dagger etc

Make the clothing with crafting, turn it magical with rc, just like tiaras

Here‚Äôs the thing, stop. Talk to UIM about this, not reddit. I am so tired of people who don‚Äôt play ironman modes telling us what is the purpose of it and what isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs resulted in some absolutely retarded polls specifically about Ironmen. Stop.
---
As you've taken the effort to respond to me, I'll reciprocate.
---
Mod Gambit, Pvp is not just **limited** to "hunt down/kill your target while doing X/Y/Z". That is a very narrow way of looking at it imo.
---
**Objective based Pvp** can add a tremendously exciting aspect to bounty hunter, if done correctly.
---
Tasks like: **"A mysterious emblem has spawned somewhere (random/in certain hotspot) in the wilderness. Retrieve the emblem to complete your task"**
---
OR
---
**Enter the wilderness at level one and exit through the wildy lever at mage bank to complete your task**
---
In order to complete such tasks you will **need to be carrying a certain amount of risk on you at all times (High risk, high reward)**.
---
By the virtue of carrying that risk, you will **not be safe** from other bounty hunters, which include your very own target.
---
These kinds of tasks don't necessitate confrontational- Pvp, but allow for far more diverse gameplay styles, incorporating aspects of **stealth, tank testing, baiting and anti-pking** 
---
Tank testing/out-maneuvering and generally being sneaky enough to evade death from groups of players in single and multi-combat in addition to the target following (or teleporting to) you to in order to complete a certain objective can make for **extremely thrilling** gameplay.
---
The task system can run in parallel to the target system and it could include tasks that involve defeating your target in a certain way (such as the ones offered), or other objective-based tasks like the ones outlined.
---
Bounty hunter needs a way to "branch out" to spice up the gameplay and allow for different play-styles. 
---
Coupled with attractive rewards, I believe objective based-Pvp is the solution that you're seeking. It's the reason why minigames such as castle wars, Fog, Soul wars, Sc have historically been as popular as they have.
---
I have two accounts one that I bot a little bit on and one I‚Äôve never used a bot on period. I‚Äôve gotten a 2 day ban for macroing on my non bot account and there‚Äôs been nothing done to my other account that I actually have botted on.
---
I know it's satire but you can tell the dude actually thinks he's smooth irl lmao
---
No because you boost at the start of a fight 
---
No one uses them because they are a pain in the ass to make for no benefit, and less doses per inv space
---
I have a pure thats got 50 att and am also curious. I have been avoiding pking because I dont know what I want to do. Might just make it a zerker
---
*bang bang*
---
I believe him because that's why I left too. I have very little time to devote to hobbies these days, and I sure as shit aren't going to devote it to a game where i might lose hundreds of hours of progress because of a shitty anti cheat system. I'm not impressed by your argument from incredulity.

This update is perhaps one of the most poorly thought out, shittily designed and unnecessary updates in the history of OSRS. Every single thing has failed in both design and implementation, and has only caused existing content to have to be given stupid changes and caveats because you didn't think about the repercussions of your design. Bravo, team. Bravo.

Precisely. Void and barrows gloves are the only thing I can think of that require a decent amount of work. I'm more thinking of a drop.

It's because skillers are enlightened and see beyond trivial things such as race

They've tried everything.  Can't even get a response.  One happened three years ago, the other last month.
---
Nope.
---
Stop with this, you‚Äôre ruining the wilderness drop table even more with every update.  Being able to buy what you need is way better than getting many magic short scrolls. Why would I want more than one? If I wanted let me buy them but there is no need to ruin a drop.

---
Nobody *wants* to go through the unbanning process
---
I've gotten 2 accounts unbanned, one of which was "unappealable" back in 2007-ish, one in 2017, by using the same link on Jagex' own site. None of this Twitter and reddit BS that everyone on this shitshow of a sub thinks is the only way to reach them

Sounds like your account may have been compromised, sorry bro!
---
What is a ‚ÄúGCSE‚Äù?
---
I think you'd have to be fairly ignorant to not understand a streamer was banned and unbanned immediately bc a mod was watching the stream. Context clues are your friend
---
On top of that, the meta has been extremely stale for years. there are only a few viable account builds. Pking in 2009 was seen as the glory times because of the rapidly developing meta and the wide variety in account build viable at different brackets. to access powerful items you had to make investments in your account build. Turmoil pures were far from balanced but atleast they spiced up the meta.
---
There have only been updates that further cement the meta instead of adding new options. Nowadays items like the obsidian maul would have never passed a poll, let alone be suggested. "oh an item with such a high strength bonus and no attack requirement is not balanced, lets make it require 70 attack and defence!"
---
Song of the Elves was the chance to add more diversity in weapons and armor, but even the potions and the blade of Saeldor aren't locked behind the quest requirements so there is really no point.
---
I really hope we can see some new items with interesting skill/quest requirements that promote pvp build diversity instead of this band aid fix.
---
Last thing I need someone pking me in the wilderness when j have my player attack options on hidden
---
so you made this post to tell everybody in a underhanded way that you have a tbow? well we are all very impressed bigshot/s

when the opponents are of equal skill pvp is rng based. if you disagree you don't have an adequate understanding of how the game functions. other pvp games do it better by minimizing/eliminating the rng elements.

there is no subjectivity to this point. you are objectively wrong.

It really makes me suspicious that another jmod could 'instantly see' that this was in fact a false-positive and unbanned EV within minutes.

Upvoted for visibility. But Jagex customer support is still terrible.
---
People are upset that they fixed this in a quick easy manner FOR ONE PERSON, and refuse to even look into anyone elses case. They say it's unappealable, and yet they fix it for someone in a quick easy manner becuaee he is basically advertising their game?
---
Upvoted, best of luck with the Jagex support lottery.
---
Bigger tinfoil hat, they just banned him for fun to create some drama.
---
I want consistency. I want a processing skill to be on par with literally every other one (every other production skill can have 100k+ exp/hr rates if you want to throw the money at it). I want the option of slow but profitable, medium profit or medium exp, and fast but costly like construction and smithing and crafting and fletching. I want there to be no arbitrary value assigned to runecrafting just because it‚Äôs grueling to train and I don‚Äôt want that arbitrary value to mess with possible content. 
---
Most of all I want there to be support behind the kind of content meant to introduce better exp rates or an easier training method. ‚ÄúI did it the hard way so you have to, as well‚Äù is no way for a community to nurture a growing new player scene. Established players, from bank standers all the way up to maxed ehp junkies, should be planting trees who‚Äôs shade they know they‚Äôll never sit in, so to speak, instead of salting the earth behind them as they progress.
---
Yeah but I think non degradable works against it in this case- look at black masks, which are BiS in a lot more scenarios, which have item sinks in the POH and multiple slayer helms
---
I think most people who are willing to pay 30m for it will have it soon, and as more come into the game there will be increasingly lower demand for them causing the price to lower more and more. Plus at the price it is, a lot of people will still kill it, even with the ridiculous defence level it has now, so I think it'll fall to a price where it's no longer worth killing the Knights when tasks come up 
---
But of course, I could be wrong
---
Damn what was jagex thinking, low level hunter is irrelevant now
---
Its nice to see someone who appreciates the extra starting cash on an account, but want to grind out their own acheivements. its a breath of fresh air. Yes 50m cash will take away from your overall experience, but hes my suggestion. 
---
Use that money for the most efficent way to train a skill. The BEST methods are usually impractical and super expensive. This way you can skin your money, and get great xp for gp and time you spend.
---
I would not reccomend buying an eternal glory as thats about 30m of your 50. you can train construction and get a mounted glory farley quickly and its the same effect, plus you'd save like 29.9m.
---
Invest in "good" gear but not BiS as that will easily eat up 50m with 2 or 3 items.
---
Some good buyable skills are Con, crafting, magic (if you can burst), range (if you can chin), prayer is almost nessesary, and farming will put your account off in a good direction.
---
Dont waste your time on fashionscape or trying to look like a baller. and a good base level for all the buyables are around 60 like you mentioned.
---
So you want jagex to control the markets? I don't think that is a good idea and may be wasted Dev time. Just introduce a new minigame or skill that makes it worthwhile to sink items.
---
This is wrong ur not fat at all

Same thing happened to me. I played back last winter, stopped playing, came back to find out I'd been banned.

It took a couple days before they emailed me back(i figured it was because I was using runelite, so I ticked the 'used third party client' option, but they restored under the pretense that someone else used my account. I logged back in to find that my (entirely f2p) character now had way more strength and attack(rip pure) and a bunch of members items.
---
How far along was your cousin? Did he ever have membership? I don't have much to offer, I'm not a high level nor am I rich, but message me in game Aflalafla if he needs anything. I understand he's only 10, but my stupid ass tried hacking tf2 when I was 10 too, we all make mistakes, we just need to learn from them. If he truly didnt macro then Jagex is a bunch of retards.

Yeah idk how or where you fucking emailed them but i'm 100% sure they don't reply to emails how about you follow the small support system and ticket system they have and then you'll get a reply rofl
---
i get more kills/h with rune knifes and eagle eye. its not worth using rigour if u have to bank every 30 mins.
---
get a ring of the god and devout boots / ranging cape t and u can do 1h+ trips
---
prooooof?

You can still kill your target however you want.

Off topic, but it kills me how trash the Taco Bell near me is. Half the time I go there, the food I get is cold af, and the other half they say their system is froze so they can't take any orders. I love taco Bell too :(

At least we're getting a H'ween event!

why don't u just go ahead and test how effective blowpiping it's crystals is over stab weapons. As for mole, twisted bow is effective because of it's passive effect

just avoid third party clients and you'll be fine, as useful as they are...

3 jaws in 2.6k kc doing 75 kills/h.

You'll be able to buy them for 30k each from any Slayer Master shop for the duration of the beta.
---
If its their first 99 after they've been playing since deviousMUD then they deserve to get shit on
---
It's because of the Streamers.......and PvP clans..They already got the Loot Cave....It's wasn't enough so now they need another OP thing in wildy.
---
Mirror shield, acb, dragonstone bolts e, anguish, assembler, ring of the gods(i), devout boots, bracelet of slaughter, slayer helm, armadyl chainskirt and crystal body.
---
I have basilisk task extended and I extend it further with bracelet of slaughter. Doing full task in 1 trip with a full inv of ranged and prayer pots. Spending max 240 bolts per hour.
---
The pace of basilisk knights is similar to skeletal wyverns and brutal black dragons. The gp/hr of basilisk knights is higher but trash off task.
---
? Do you have eyes maybe look at the subreddit.

[For example this blown up post and the guy even saying he got a reply from support saying his ban was correct yet he thinks he is talking to a bot because he is too stupid to learn the difference between a bot and a support system like zendeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dlllge/recent_events_with_evscape_made_me_think_about/f4u6ycb/)

It is surprisingly easy to amass negative karma very quickly by posting opposing political opinions on either r/politics (Liberals) or r/The_Donald (Conservatives) regardless of intentionally trolling or having a well reasoned opinion.

And questing in general

It‚Äôs funny how little self awareness internet users have.  Were literally on a sub for a game that is designed to play your mind and keep you coming back for the little dopamine boost of minor accomplishments and gains of wealth.  Fake karma points aren‚Äôt that much different than fake gold and fake skills on a video game.
---
I'm genuinely concerned about getting banned. I already had my account stolen while I was on a break, and with all the scare of third party clients, I figured it was probably my own fault(wasnt aware it was stolen it just told me i was banned)
---
I got lucky and they unbanned me, but I don't want to risk what I've put into this account. Should I just abandon runelite?
---
so it's not appealable if you answer truthfully
---
I'll by saying I don't PVP. Why in the absolute fuck would you make it harder to get BH rewards without engaging in PVP? The PVP community is already struggling in size and is a small minority in polls now.
---
If you make everything harder to get for everyone else for literally no reason, you're just incentivizing people to reflexively vote 'no' on even more PVP polls in the future, and bring in even more players to vote 'no' than before.
---
You're strangling PVP with these updates and time-wasted, deflected PVP polls. Worst part is you just drag it on and on and refuse to learn for some reason. Either cut that shit out **NOW**, or speed up the process of killing PVP so we can get those non-PVP Wilderness worlds everyone will vote 'yes' for in the polls.
---
This uncomfortable middle ground filled with content deadening updates is just not a good place to be.
---
Dolo raids and use the extra GP to get fastest exp for other skills.
---
I'm glad you're looking forward to it.
---
We're aware of the maul handle situation and I'm open to ideas - we considered adding them to a shop temporarily similar to the Rune pouch and looting bag, but decided adding an infinite supply was too risky for a tradeable item.

If you pay the farmer to protect it, it will grow safely with no need for you to check on it. Once a crop is fully grown, there is no chance of disease, so also no need for you to personally check on it.

Not if you do torstol runs and farming contracts
---
I PKs you BKs
---
this is so cool! do you folks know what the skill order is, or if the list is circular? wonder what would happen if you overflowed past whatever the "last" skill is
---
if they let people off then they have to let a bunch of people off. that would just take too much effort to see who has false positives and who doesn't, so everyone is just fucked
---
Honestly. You know it‚Äôs mislabeled and that PKer is washing the blood off

A lot of the dangerous tasks can be completed in a less convoluted way now, so if anything it will speed up the progress somewhat.

Hunter was my first and it gave me 70m, if you don't mind hunter it's not a bad starter at all. Got me introduced into the 99s grind.

lololollol

i can't believe people actually want to look like that tho
---
Rocky is awesome tho! wana trade lol
---
Will you bring the cost of the pouch down? If 1250 slayer points for rune pouch is the only way, it means youll basicly need 99 slayer for it.
---
the non-ranger-boot drops almost exactly cancel out the cost to get the clues
---
You don't. You're not a streamer, so they dont care about you.
---
yes there is, the fun of doing it, i compare it to mini railways, they're so cool to watch cause its a mini lil world, i kind of get the same feeling from hunter
---
Did you read the second part?
---
It's the stabby mid-level ones you gotta worry about, these guys are super inaccurate
---
Have you tried not being so good?
---
Now it's even harder for inexperienced players. Also, the way the rewards system works will further incentivize non-PKers to  vote 'no' on future PVP polls since Jagex is trying to gatekeep players from getting what they want/need without PKing.
---
I don't think that's what this is about.
---
Its not an act its a legitamate runelite bug and if you ever got hacked thats what it would look like. You just cant see it that way because you are in fact jealous of pixels
---
Lol. This man fed 20 Venezuelans for a week with his purchase
---
Sounds like he was botting or he had other people play his account. How can you be out driving while you died and not know how you died? You log out after 5mins of afk or 20mins splashing. And if he was afk he would know where he went afk. It's not like your character randomly walks places, and random events no longer attack or teleport you.
---
Sounds like he was cheating either way.
---
The above proposed tasks are much more in line with how Pking is done in osrs than ‚Äúkill someone without legs on‚Äù.
---
No need to complain when you've yet to encounter any problem.

Got hacked once and it was my fault. Learned from the experience and it has yet to happen.

Getting smacked with the quickness by a team of 23 tim allan fanboys in the revenant caves
---
Nah it makes sense. Judging people on their personality and merits, while using their skin colour as nothing more than an identifying marker in the same way you'd use dress sense or hair colour is so narrow minded. Dude just be accepting. Gawd.
---
Doesn't it give some sort of "this cannot be appealed" message in the ban?
---
Get members and follow a guide to barrows gloves
---
&gt;the blade of Saeldor isn't locked behind the quest requirements so there is really no point.
---
It is if you want the weapon to have any stats.
---
All 99s are cool. But if you start flexing 99 cooking we're gonna clown on you.
---
Goal tracked lol
---
Basiscally slayer and bank yes, I‚Äôve already done a most of the quests so that‚Äôs secondary
---
&gt;And Cooking you can end up profitable but slower, or again with lots of money, can be done really quickly too.
---
Wines is actually only 8.5M~ (unless theres an even faster more expensive method I dont know)
---
I think cooking is too chill to lose money on tho, I got 99 fletching and cooking in my first 5 weeks, both through profit methods for some starter cash
---
The game isnt going into mtx
---
‚ÄúWe are postponing the QA because we royally fucked up BH and also player support is a hot topic right now and we don‚Äôt feel like having to answer difficult questions‚Äù

---
I find runecrafting to be pretty enjoyable and therapeutic tbh. It‚Äôs really easy to sit and get into the groove of doing double astrals and get my mind off of things, with the added benefit of making some pretty nice gp gains.
---
It's not that 1250 points is hard to get, but kieren brought up on a Q&amp;A that there are *so* many things competing for slayer points right now.
---
- unlocks  
---
- extensions  
---
- perks (auto smash etc.)  
---
- blocks  
---
- slayer helm  
---
- superiors  
---
- boss tasks  
---
- slayer rings  
---
- herb sack  
---
- rune pouch  
---
- helm recolours  
---
- skips  
---
You can get any individual item pretty early on, but you'll probably be in the 90's by the time you buy everything you want (which is 200+ hours if you're trying to bank points instead of skipping as much as possible). Rune pouch is pretty low on the list compared to most of those other things.
---
bstaves will always bounce back because of alch price, take advantage of it
---
Man that sucks mafia is a cool dude. I assume that's a dc?
---
U cant supply any explanation. My appeal was insta denied pretty much on two of my accs. One banned in 2012 and one in 2019. One was hijacked and banned and the other was banned for a huff and suck mouse.
---
Sorry it devalued my social anxiety
---
Read the comments, bunch of edgelords just desperate to make black jokes. Even the comment above you directly references the skin color but you feel the need to embellish what they are saying. Weird.

I like mine, might not be the most efficient though

You think if he was botting hed be more likely to make up a "I died to a boss" story
---
Great editing!
---
Definitely not crumbs. You can see the differences in the eyes and legs. Yours still has the plastic bumps from where the strings cut off.  People really are ignorant as fuck.
---
I‚Äôve been super excited about this, the zulrah bots have been rocked so I can go back to making decent money while hunting my mutagen again.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) thanks for letting me know ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I've been saving, got like 850 (varrock easy only) and I've missed a couple days where I didn't get on that day in time.
---
The issue is the air orb, if that doesn't come down because of botters or low levels moneymaking with it then I'll be stuck with only 14% :p
---
Not really sure why people think that creating robes should be part of the skill where you craft runes, but since we're not getting warding I would like to see some of the content added elsewhere.

Grtz on achieving 99 agility man. Although slightly disappointed there were no fireworks.
---
It‚Äôs still there, search: key
---
Why does he look like Ryan Reynolds?
---
My guess is it would be because they broke subreddit rules, then knowingly made more posts breaking the same rule trying to circumvent it.
---
Thx for the support guys. I know this post comes off of as a meme and is a rip-off of another account called ‚Äú20 minutes‚Äù, but his post inspired me to create a duplicate because it‚Äôs apparent that there are many of us that never got justice for a false positive. 
---
Again, I did NOT steal or hijack any damn accounts. The only thing I remember at the time was that a couple of good in game friends had given me free stuff including a D2H and other random crap - like why wouldn‚Äôt 11-12 yr old me not accept? In addition, apparently I have an ‚Äúaccount sharing‚Äù mute from 2006... never once have I shared my account. The only thing that could be the reason for that is when I got hacked at a public library computer cuz I stupidly typed my password too slow and two guys behind me literally just copied what I typed, followed by them logging into my acc and hacking me
---
Oh they changed it to Key Remapping?
---
i prepared all for the moment and i accidentaly touched the obstacle :(
---
Lol bro I‚Äôm over 3k kills with only 3 dropped shards. So when you get your shard before 1k kc be happy.
---
Yes.
---
What do you mean? The skin was all dark from being down in the dirt all day. Then they washed off all the dirt for clean skin. It seems normal to me
---
But that specific picture of hand washing is a meme. Besides, is editing it to swap the text REALLY too much effort? Finding a different picture is the same thing.
---
What are the recommended combat levels for regular and hard gauntlet? What are their corresponding profit?

This order isnt accurate for the xp drops. With 16385 xp i get a fm xp drop, then if i do another 16385 i get wc

You can now never get another kill and flex on literaly everyone. Im so jelly ;_;

Awesome, thanks!
---
Ah yes, I forget all white people came together and created racism and a few got alzheimers and now think racism is dumb.

I bet you're just the least racist one here, huh?

Or are you also one of those "racism against white people isn't racist" retards?
---
Cant do hunter at work tho
---
I got cooking and fletching to 99 at work for some starter cash when I just started playing... then I went for fishing at infernal eels and made a lot more money but also spent like 3-4x the time I needed for cooking and fletching combined lmao
---
well it isn‚Äôt like they‚Äôre using some multivariable calculus or differential equations for xp rates. the experience formula is just an exponential polynomial, and the xp needed for level L is just a summation of it. all of which can still be solved algebraically.
---
delete this right now
---
this is why pvp is dying
---
The first few were funny, but not anymore. This sub is awful at just spamming memes and running the joke into the ground.
---
Depends. Varrock and mory are pretty good ones. I find the ge teleport amazing. Bonecrusher and barrows runes are great. Kandarin is good for agility and the catherby herb patch. Frem is nice for the shortcut to the herb patch and elites for dk bones.
---
Honestly just read the rewards and set goals for whatever you want
---
I'd argue that a google search of "black man washing hands" would be quicker than editing the pigment of the skin but tbh I don't really give af and I'm confused on why I'm even talking about this lmao
---
"banktap" lol
---
A quick lapse in judgement in game is different than logging in and leaving your account logged in at a dangerous area while you actually leave, or whatever allegedly happened. It's extremely unusual for someone to not know how they died in a situation like this.
---
It's reasonable to wonder what happened. Of course people are going to read into it.
---
The way to get to the manually reviewed tickets isn't hard at all. It's clearly marked and people throw hissy fits because it isn't the first option.
---
I do enjoy how every time this appeal method is discussed people in the comments admit they botted. They don't want to unban every idiot who botted for a week non stop, it clogs up the queue and isn't beneficial to anyone except the botter and most likely the script writer.
---
If you just make it better for beginners by slightly buffing profits for everyone its going to be better for good pkers aswell because they have more people to fight. 
---
And if they would have choosen to just buffed the reward store it would have also been better for pvmers who do wildy slayer...
---
I have! Like I mentioned I really started making this sheet to determine how many days it would take me to level to 99 farming by taking all the runs I was doing into account. Then I got carried away, made all the inputs parameters, added pricing and prettied it up to share with the community. That being said I still frequently use jihadsquad's spreadsheet for all sorts of things!
---
Those are actually both my alt reddit accounts that I deleted. I‚Äôm IceBarraging (my in game rsn) and atheentrepeneur was my throwaway
---
I mean this sincerely:
---
I love how annoyed you neets get by benign things. Warms my cockles.
---
Generally you pray mage if you don't know what's coming. Mage hits higher and with a decent setup you'll have a nice ranged defence bonus. 
---
Make sure you run away if it's about to potentially change to melee, this gives you time to react as you know melee is coming if the gorilla runs towards you.
---
Also SGS allows you to sustain most of the hits you dont know are coming.
---
We'd like to do something similar for Clue Boxes. We're limited in how much we can do this week due to devs being away, so it wasn't included this week but could be added next.
---
Yeah must be really hard to beg for money.

Sounds like a really good ground work for jagex to pick up and start from. Great idea on making the raid more friendly to both mid/lower levels and high levels. Great that the rewards, while bis, don't actually offer much in the way of unique advantages over current bis. Current bis has, or nearly has, reached the height of where they can go without being too extremely overpowered.
---
On that note, I think it would be really cool to see jagex introduce either, combat stats that can go to 120 and are reduced to 99 while in wilderness, or non tradeable max tier, 99 req gear which can be upgraded from verge extremely rare drops from max tier content around runescape (taking ages to max specific weapons). The idea of non tradeable weapons tho, would crash the max tier tradeables. But I would like to see some creative innovation to extend the max tier ceiling without destroying rs. I ruining our raid does a good job of filling a couple voids in the type of max tier content being released, without overdoing the ideas. Great job honestly.
---
That's true but I don't think that invalidates the task. I guess I'd have an issue with it if the entire fight is supposed to be done with no legs or body. But the added risk to take off armor during the fight sounds fun.
---
I get where you're coming from though in saying that, i don't even have a 99 but I'd prefer that than an untrimmed cooking cape

2015-2030 to not give you the exact level
---
I think if they are in a f2p area, like defense or woodcutting or smithing or mining,  they should be obtainable to f2p but capes like attack or strength should not be suddenly moved to a f2p location just so they can get the capes.
---
that is what i thought when i got the first one..
---
I personally use it at raids and zulrah for poison immunity.
---
Clap them cheeks=
---
It's still BIS for wildy tanking, allowing you to take an extra brew instead of an antivenom.
---
Same reason fire runes are more expensive than lava runes. They're F2P items and suicide bots rely on them.
---
Wowie, this was the one skilling pet I was upset I didn't get to 99. Lucky duck.
---
There is almost not difference in KO potential for a pure naked compared to one in chaps and a cwars top.
---
So... zmi?
---
Pretty much what everyone said. Using DFS you lose a lot of offense meaning longer kills. Food typically isn‚Äôt the limiting factor it‚Äôs inventory space.
---
This guys reads.

My soup is slightly cold right now, should I heat it up a bit?

Cute butt tho
---
maybe just alow them to get a dye that dyes normal capes in that skillcapes colour, this way they can show off without a bis cape and also normal skillcapes are sold in members areas
---
Oh definitely, this is 100% on reddit. Jmods should honestly not browse this shit subreddit. It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous.

---
Yeah its ez with 43 pray
---
Do what you feel like, you will most likely fail the first few attempts and that will cost you a lot of money in super restores and brews. I would take that money and invest in 75 ranged instead, but it is your call.
---
You forgot to crappily shotgun a beer! Downvoted smh
---
For real tho gratz! I'm working on 99 agility rn as well and will probably make a similar video :P
---
It's more of a personal "vote with your wallet" kind of thing for me. Their lack of real customer support and inconsistencies with the little support they do give is what bothers me. Until Jagex can do better for their playerbase, I don't want to support the company.
---
Meanwhile in ironman land.. we look down on the maxed main flexers and hold our 90 crafting In Higher value than there entire acc.
---
I‚Äôve seen loads of pures get the cape with 63 range 1 def and 43 prayer. 70 def will at least allow you good armor- and at 61 range get a dragon b bow/ if you need one I got you
---
I did papayas, hardwoods, redwood, and hespori 1-2 runs per day to 99 and it took like 6-7 months. Buying bstaffs with varrock hard covers the cost. Not worth blowing a hundred mill+ on magic trees at all imo
---
Nah, because I mentioned I was 12 at one point and my account was muted until my 13th birthday
---
Thank you! your answer was the best because my range is very high so most of the time im trying to hit with melee and cant back away.  and also the mage attack deal the most damage.
---
Not a jamflex problem because it doesnt occur on the official client

Haha

Just watched this episode last night.
---
Even on my like 7th watch through, it still hurts just as much lol
---
I actually kinda like runecrafting. Not properly grinding it out, but when I feel like doing some easy skilling, I will just mindlessly craft astral runes while catching up on my Youtube to-watch list, or watching some random documentary
---
He was meaning a budget autocast for Zamorak Flames. That alone is enough to be a problem.
---
I wanted my 1st 99 to be somewhat special, not generic cooking or fletching. As I've seen that smithing used to be one of the lower amount of player-99's, I chose smithing. I also really like the untrimmed smithing cape.
---
I mean, it's not the *sole* reason.
---
Fake, internet does not contain girls.
---
Gold is cheap COMPARED yeah, I didn't use gold though as it's still a big money sink.

I'm working on the quest cape now.. bless you. I'd rather do runecrafting. I still have 55 quests left. Kill me.

We edited the default sound of the Minecraft instruments using a resourcepack and played Barbarianism on our Minecraft gameception: Minescape

What do you think of the result?
---
do you even know the drop rates? lol lucky bastard
---
If you can afford an SGS, the special attack heals you by 50% and restores prayer by 25% of that hit. It's highly accurate, allowing you to extend your trips for a lot of PvM
---
eyyy
---
Has he gotten any 3a?
---
It's that mythical "engine work" we hear about. Actually, that gives me an idea for a meme.
---
who is complaining about selling runes from slayer? If you have a bursting task, have runes in your bank, you would think you would use those before you bought more (taps head).
---
Literally no one complains about bursting/barraging tasks are expensive. its common knowledge they profit or break even.
---
Praying mage will help stop alot of that damage my friend
---
PvM is a safe way to practice gear switching, prayer switching and F-key usage.

Killing wildy PvMers is a way too. A player geared for vetion don't have anything to fight back with lol.

I started playing Runescape 13,5 years ago like CB\_Ranso said in a reply. I mostly played inefficient &amp; F2P RS as I just played to enjoy the game. The few times that I was a member back in the day I just hunted for clues or did a bit of everything, just as I'm doing now!
---
I did take a break between EOC &amp; OSRS and a few breaks to play different games inbetween, but I finally did get the smithing as I so long desired to get. It took me not too long to get it as I currently have like 6-8 hours a day to play the game in Blast Furnace to make adamant bars &amp; platebodies, but it still took 13,5 years to get my 1st 99 ever! :D
---
P.S. Thanks &lt;3
---
Starts with 678. 5 and 9 then wrap it. 29 is like 59 but just dropped down a bit. Then multiply by 2 to get 58 but separate 1 from it to get 571. Then 058 which would have the same distance between each number if the 0 were shifted by 2. So 0582. Then 735 and 625. Which are 110 (fairly even) apart and both end in 5, which makes them easier to remember. 
---
I guess to make 058 easier, it's 57 + 1 from earlier in the sequence, keeping the same number of digits.
---
Couldn't agree more &lt;3
---
Yeah, most likely going to let my sub expire after maxing. Thank god I've been playing super casually on my account, or I'd be on here begging for a review. Between the farce that is the Jagex  "Customer support," things failing polls multiple times, and then being added as "integrity" changes, and the constant fear that my account isn't safe enough (even though I've already done everything possible to secure it) this is no bueno.
---
That doesn't include drops you've seen though? The items suck, but the amounts aren't too bad.
---
Slow &amp; steady wins the race, am I right?
---
uhm and just because someone has a 120b bank in runescape doesnt mean they have 120b gp.
---
it is split up between items and money like in real life. 120b is 120b no matter if it is liquid or not
---
I am loving the cape! I'm definitely going to rock a lot of fashionscape with this
---
I didnt see his comment but I assume he brought up the attack timer over verzik to count down ticks to her next attack. This allows you to perfectly time walking under/away from her and avoiding melee attacks.
---
Lmao.

Why were you tunnelling inputs to an account you dumped loads of wealth onto that was in NMZ?

I've never seen so many circumstantial flags get triggered all at once xD
---
If you're innocent, good luck. No idea why you thought that wouldn't have consequences though?
---
You literally can't write anything in bud, that isn't an appeal.
---
Yea, I thought about that after the fact, but I lost all thought process when I saw the 48. Prior to that I don't think I've ever even been hit for double digits.
---
That's all people dude
---
Always in doubt üò≠ everyone loves a giveaway and you know it üëç

It already did.

They literally wrote:

Everyone: Are 3rd party clients safe?
---
Jagex: Yesn't.
---
That's what it felt like. Tried to be the nicest I could be but when they don't want to help how can you force them? You can't. It's insaine.
---
There should be a pity mechanic for these types of things.  It's an untradeable pet who cares if he gets x2 the drop rate after being x2 the drop rate of the pet.

I totally agree. Even though, RuneCrafting, agility &amp; mining untrimmed are also badass ones to have, no matter if I prefer the trimmed versions. Untrimmed smithing definitely looks good tho. Loving it &lt;3

I'll keep you updated when it happens haha, tyvm

Good luck ass licker69
---
Remember when Kacy was rank 1 for most pets, with the bloodhound holding him back from being first to get all pets? 
---
Yeah... since then multiple new pets have come out, 2 people have managed to get all pets, and Kacy is still hunting down the clue dog. 
---
*Oof*
---
I played the "real" OSRS back in the day, didn't get a 99 until now tho
---
Just give F2P ONE new cape. Slightly better stats than all F2P capes, cost 9.9k, and only requires 99 in ANY skill. No adjustments to P2P required, no relocation of F2P cape sellers. Simplify the demand.
---
I can understand the panic all too well. Which makes me shit at pking or bossing. Me running around like a crazy person in a panic is not conducive to me getting kills.
---
Im studing nutrition so i know how my bodie and metabolism works so i can manipulate it as i want. 
---
i only eat Fruits, veggetables and meat and drink water so that improves the lean body and energetic lvl af compared to my old lifestyle.
---
Its my lifestyle so its not that i "kill my self" at gym.. i just train 3 times per week and play soccer  on saturdays.. but its true that i like to push my self futher every training.

Nice gl. I only have 56rc and that's from tears of guthix. I kinda enjoy questing though.
---
I think it was your attitude of "it hasn't happened to me so it's not an issue" rather than having a different opinion.
---
A spade with a load of shit piled onto it.
---
This genuinely isn't true though.. they could absolutely improve support, but people don't always come to the forums to get resolved and when they do a Jmod usually confirms that the person had been in the wrong.
---
This is the same old BS that goes on in these forums. I feel like it's such common sense as to why they have to be careful as to how they handle this. The chance of false positives are possible, but still highly unlikely. The people should have a better way to appeal, but now since it happened to someone on stream the appeal is going to get abused by a bunch of people who were rightfully banned.
---
If it's your first time I wouldnt recommend doing it without BP and definitely not at 67 range
---
Not true, I got "macro major" banned and literally all I would have had to say was "can you guys make sure that isn't macro minor", but no you can't write anything in the appeal.
---
Did you read my "no" at the start or not?
---
Remember the 3M gp you had to pay for a set of Black (g)?
---
That's because PvMers vote no out of spite to get the content handed over to them.
---
How can we address the fact that non-PvPers vote no to good content out of spite? I personally couldn't care less about anything besides PvP and I still don't vote no, I vote yes so that they can enjoy the game.
---
I'm sorry you have to deal with such a divided player base but PvP is essential to this game. It was killed once in 2007 and it killed the game. It was killed a second time with EoC and it killed RS3. Kill it a third time and I'm sure other cheaper video games wouldn't mind the extra players.
---
3h?
---
Totally agree. Thanks :D
---
ring of charos for the ladies
---
Thanks! :D
---
No. I prefer my music and Discord conversations to game sounds. Nylocas is fine
---
Not at the moment. I might have to start. Thanks
---
Not to mention if divine doesnt give you a max hit you can swap out tassets for justiciar legs
---
Yeah man my advice to anyone starting out is go ahead and get that month of membership and do as many quests as you can. They give you insane level ups. Waterfall quest is the best example as it takes 30 mins tops to complete it and you‚Äôd have 30 atk and str from lvl 1.
---
Blyat
---
I know.  I thought I made that clear in the last sentence of my post, but I might have not worded it well.
---
I mean, not really, I just see them less often than combats, but I see WAY less fletching than you would see back in 2006-2010. Back then fletching was considered one of the easiest to get if you wanted a skillcape, but these days it's annoying to get, even compared to like 8 other skills. Probably because it's worthless and nobody cares about just having a skillcape for the sake of it anymore.
---
"We've invested so much without returns by going into debt we now have to find ways to increase our revenue just to pay up all the past development that did not paid for itself"

No shame, I hope osrs team do not waste money on shitty game updates that do not improve the game that much.

The item formerly known as a mysterious emblem.
---
yeah, its not at all impressive that you can force yourself to runecraft or do agility for 100s of hours for nothing but some shitty capes.
---
I can barely do runecrafting for 2 hours, and then once i'm done with that i can't stand to do it for another couple of months.

&gt; Failed pretty heavily though
---
Was like 74.5% yes, have no idea why it failed in the first place.
---
It would be absolute aids if they didn't make rune pouches tradeable, you could basically get one instantly since emblems were tradeable anyway. Imagine everytime you wanted one (it's always lost in a PvP death for instance) you'd have to grind out BH, pay 1250 slayer points or do something dreadful like MTA every single time.
---
General Graardor
---
No. I don't think it should be in the game, but it was voted in wasn't it?  Have you really rationalized your cheating to the point that you unironically compare 3rd party advantages to mechanics that are part of the actual game?

You aren't a streamer, so you don't get customer support. Sorry bud.
---
Unless you're a streamer, apparently.
---
Same tbh
---
I guess you're lucky? Because I have friends that play this game for a living selling rsgp. They all say that RWT bans do happen, and have happened to them, but pretty randomly.

Shit... didn‚Äôt think of that. I am going to repost this with this feedback and another, requiring gold bars to charge them... 1250 gold bars for every 250k xp received. 250k xp is aprox 4355 bars/h, essentially a loss of 28.7% of what you‚Äôd make, even though it‚Äôs a loss, for an extra 3.9% xp/h which is a good trade off I find. Should the amount of bars be more or less to charge? I find this a good amount.

And fucks.

The ceo Phil Mansell is really the one everyone needs to be mad at. The devs teams can't do anything with corporate support. Yet everyone goes after the mods and devs and not the people actually in control

no bullying the noobs pls

This is true, but I don't see your point.  If you have an inventory full of iron, your run will deplete slower if you reduce that weight with graceful. Yes, if your weight is already 0 it makes no difference, but I think it's pretty simple to see that that's not the case we're talking about.
---
Is there any way to get a text box somewhere to add an explanation? I went through the steps, and it says it's being looked at, but I never even got a chance to say anything. My account was banned ages ago in rs2 after it got hacked and botted, I really only just want the name back since it's what I use in every game.
---
When you kill Vorkath, try to start with a DHCB to cut down on supplies needed. Also, don‚Äôt worry about using a bolt switch the first few times when you‚Äôre learning.
---
They were 200+ a year ago, after a qna they mentioned something about mass producing cannonballs for ironman related to the poh, which caused cannonballs to crash below 150. Now theyre rising back to 200 since there hasnt been a word on it again

10 hours out of like 170 to hit drop rate. its a small chunk. a skeletal visage at drop rate adds 6,000gp average to each of your kills. 
---
yes it saves time but its pretty negligible.
---
So they'll ban your main for effectively muling the foreign currency purchase?
---
With the increased amount of posts discussing Jagex‚Äôs customer support it‚Äôs got me wondering... how many people actually need or use their support system? Are people really getting hacked and falsely banned left and right? I‚Äôm all for their customer service being improved, but what percentage of players actually have their accounts compromised? 10%?
---
Nah, maybe it didnt fit that well. Don't get me wrong I like this format, I just found it funny how we essentially ask for a lot of swole dudes

Misconstruing the intent of the message so you can call it racist? Ouchies.
---
Old method was buying a T10 emblem (2m+ GP) which gave you enough points for 4 pouches, so it's not as good as that. However with the removal of the old BH shop there is no quick way to get a rune pouch anymore (either have to play lots of BH, pay 1250 slayer points or (temporarily) do wildy slayer for enough archaic emblems), so hopefully the upcoming poll to make them tradeable passes.

Okay, you may be right, it was a manual ban, whatever. The point is you can still appeal those in the same way, manual or not, as long as they're a macro major ban.

You‚Äôre wrong dipshit.
---
Back to wanking in your mum‚Äôs knicker draw you go
---
If you have 1.5m to spare on a rune pouch you already could've bought one in emblems from the old store anyway
---
the xp rates are already very high for this method to make this viable. the influx of gold bars has been a problem and there is an oversupply on the market currently, crashing the price down. this would help fight it. ya, a mere 9k xp/h more is worth the tradeoff.
---
whats your range level? because from what i read i would expect it to be around 80, which is low for vorkath
---
The only reason people go there is for low level metal dragon tasks until they are wise enough to block them

I got dhcb and have never used bp here is it because of the shield slot?
---
A double sided dildo
---
The short answer is better stats and gear = better kills. Rigour will help you get kills faster but it isn't going to really help with damage from the ranged attack. Are you consistently hitting nice specs with the BGS or not? With kill times like that you aren't quite there yet. I don't use a DHCB but with Rigour, blowpipe on adamant darts and 99 range my kills on average are usually 1:30. Sometimes I end up dropping food on the ground to pick up items because I didn‚Äôt have to use any and other times I will use half of my inventory. The less time it takes you to get a kill means less chance of beyond exposed to hard hitting attacks.

when i was starting out, i used cheap gold bars to make bracelets and get profit crafting xp, dont know why its a problem
---
No reason to dharok without the full set tho
---
I'm struggling with the same thing.  My specs are very unreliable.  I have 86 attack and I use a super combat plus piety for specs and they barely ever land.  Leads to really long kills and using most of my supplies just for one kill.  I think I'm gonna give it a rest until 90 attack and see if it's much better then.

"Wishing they we're a streamer so they would be popular" does not reflect anything I mentioned. Many of the comments I am reading are ranting about this being an example of streamer preference and I simply do not see it that way. I believe the Jagex employee did the right thing. The mass down-votes on a honest reply that recognizes they do not always get it right does not make sense to me. If people really just want better customer service, lashing out at an example of someone going out of their way to help a customer (regardless of that customer's status as a streamer) is not helpful.
---
the price of gold bars have dropped tremendously. making gold bars is the meta for getting 99 smithing. thousands of people do it. there is just too much and it has posed a problem to the community, just like too much gold in the game.
---
It can still get much harder. An easy example would be some extended inferno where you can't cheese with tank gear (everything has 100% accuracy). We also don't have anything like 7 jads in the base game, i.e an activity which requires constant actions every tick and sometimes multiple in a single click. Sure it's not adding new mechanics, but the skill ceiling can be raised significantly.
---
Also more dynamic content like zulrah on release (but make it so you can properly react).

In RS3, a player named Omid was 43k dry on a drop that's 1/2k. Rough stats shows that there's a 1/1.7BILLION chance of that happening. See [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4b390z/bugged_or_just_unlucky_if_you_watch_runescapeomid/) for the full maths.
---
A Jmod replied (see [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4b390z/bugged_or_just_unlucky_if_you_watch_runescapeomid/d15ro0t/)), turned out that when an unrelated item was added to the game, it had flagged the item as being obtained by Omid, even though it wasn't (and you can only get it once). They ended up manually granting him the item, given that it had been a confirmed bug, and he was WAY over the drop rate.
---
JMods don't read this thread. But from your own description, you willingly use a VPN and 2FA for increased security and are dealing with the consequences of that. Security is a trade off.
---
Damn, it's justified then to RWT and buy bonds with that gold. You pay ~70 cents per mil (lower on average and in bulk), so 2 bonds (rounded up to 5.5m) is 11m.
---
That way you're paying $7.70 rather than $11 for a bond, and it's a win-win-win. You pay a lot less for month of membership, the gold sellers make a profit, and Jagex still comes out ahead compared to you buying a normal membership.

Sweet! You got your acc back?
---
It's mostly because they randomly decided 'oh we polled it this way, so we're gonna change how it worked' 
---
It doesn't make any sense still. You can run ess to any training method besides zeah. And it was a big meme where we asked for the polled xp rates of everything. Mocking the idea. I forget what places now. My big gripe with the decision is that tick manipulation exists because 'it's more effort' but running ess has tradeoffs as well. You either are running multiple accounts (more effort) or you're paying someone or giving them SOMETHING to make it worth it for them.
---
I still think it needs to be reverted. Zmi was an old-school thing, it just wasn't in the 2007 backup. 
---
Wiki says "Originally released on 18 September 2007,"
---
For some reason I remember soup doing this exact thing in a quest guide. If I'm not exaggerating it was the exact line lol.
---
If they removed all non-cosmetic MTX and reverted EoC do you think some people would move back? Or are their Hiscores already too destroyed to bother...

They are just use bulwark and karils

You right. Excuse me for being dumb.

 Legit, vanilla client player, i even got 99 farming this spring. So happy.

Woke up, decided to alch and do agility, then cook some swordies. Logged out, took a nap, woke up 4 hours later. Banned for major macroing. I thought, "wow, well i didnt cheat, so I'll appeal and we'll be good to go." Decided to make a new char to have as a skiller if anything.even put membership on right away to talk to friends.
---
3 days later, the alt got banned for same exact thing.
---
This happened on the 14th and the 17th of October. Finally got the appeals back yesterday/2 days ago, saying both accounts were banned permanently.

Definitely not a happy camper. RIP Zaknafein22/Zaknafein D and Deaf Giraffe.

Rigour does give you a def boost of 25%, so it most definitely does help you tank more hits.

I wasn‚Äôt saying that Kacy hasn‚Äôt spent more time, I was just stating that Curtis spending around 1700 hours grinding ~4 kills/hr was also by no means an unimpressive feat

By denied do you mean they just didn't give you a reply? It clearly states that you won't receive any response if this is not the first time you tried appealing a ban.
---
What acc?
---
because god forbid we break the cycle of shitty nieve hentai this subreddit seems to be perpetually trapped in
---
I would say use steel skin to have a better chance of tanking more ranged hits.
---
E: Also use bastion pots if you can. I would say divine pots are better when you have dhcb, and reg range pots won't give you the extra defense levels. It might cost a bit more, but it might help out with doing a kill or two more than your current average.
---
They are, but since you get the clockwork back after emptying the trap, it's easiest to just bring logs of the type you need, hammer, and chisel and craft a new one right there.

Im watching guides on achievement diaries, and almost all of em recommend doing Varrock first. But because it is not as profitable as it used to be, is it still worth tackling Varrock diary first ? Or is there something more useful I should go after ?

Hey man just wanted to say it‚Äôs really cool and I think smithing is one of the coolest original skills to get a 99. I always had a childhood dream of making my own rune armor and sword and I came close to it on my ironman but recently made a UIM. One day hopefully!

No, because he's an extremely successful developer/entrepreneur that made a series of business decisions that lead him to be the leader in nearly every industry he's ever entered. Amazon, Twitch, Alexa, Audible, AWS, all very successful businesses, and he's the visionary behind them. He might be a rich asshole, but he knows what he's doing. Amazon wasn't dumb luck.
---
Nothing is. If it's desirable then locking it behind uncaring rng is going to leave some people working hard and feeling shitty. The threshold system doesn't impact normal player's chances of getting a pet, it only makes the long term grinding less morale destroying. You can actually work towards a pet instead of potentially going 10x the droprate. It's a kindness, and it would barely change anything for 99 percent of players.

Their support is fucking terrible lol. I can't think of one other company that provides me a service that has an almost unreachable support team, depends on an automated system to respond to most inquiries in spite of the fact that these automated systems they use have been known to get it wrong in the past. On top of that being a streamer or hoping your Reddit post blows up is one of the only ways to have a chance of your problem being reviewed by an actual human being. Look at Blizzard, any problem I have ever had with my account has been responded to within 48 hours via email/ticket. I can even phone them if it's more urgent or be in a live voice chat with an agent within minutes. In my opinion they're lucky they have such a unique product because if for example this company was providing my electricity, I'd have fucked off years ago to another provider. Please don't ever get into a business providing goods and services to paying customers if you think Jagex has decent customer support.
---
Yeah, but that's wrong.
---
Aren‚Äôt skillers the guys at level 3 combat who only train non combat

---
I'd like to still maintain the will to play the game, that's more important than pushing out levels upon levels upon levels, because then it gets old pretty quickly.
---
Can't have fun if you're banned lol
---
He can't define "no customer support" because he probably never needed it let alone did some search for whatever problem he had.
---
I really haven‚Äôt noticed much of a difference for the ranged attack. I will still get hit for 20+ when it lands. It‚Äôs more about the DPS.
---
That still taking days to get to 99 lol.
---
That‚Äôs how I got good at lms
---
Meh, torso is one of those things that the earlier you get it the better. May as well get it out of the way now rather than wait, it'll also give you another ~1m (the price of the obby plate) to buy gear with so yeah.
---
You do get more from higher level houses. The cost of magics could make your run less efficient in terms of money. Redwoods are a godsend because they cost like 5 times less than magics and also get more nests and seeds. Runs really go up in efficiency at redwoods.
---
Ok, let's just trust the Reddit guy who swears his friend didn't bot, because nobody ever lied on the internet.

Not saying it's the case but I mean we've seen plenty of people on reddit saying the same thing and after some research people have figured out they were really botting.

That level 3 player would be marked as a group ironman though, and I assume there will be some sort of notation for which bracket they're in (2-5 man), so you'd know that they were likely helped by other players.
---
Normal ironmen will still have their normal grey, red, or white helmets showing that they're true solo players. It devalues nothing unless you believe all ironmen have the same restrictions for some reason.

based on what you don't like, and wanting to sink the money, construction all the way. You'll sink about half that into 83 construction which will cut out almost all of the running around that you don't like.

The other 25m you could buy what you need for base 60s and buy all the gear you'll need up until base 60s or 70s combat. that should drain most of the 50m stack altogether.

I'll pick option 1 if its cosmetics only. I dont give a shit about a few cosmetics
---
Good. did they announce this?
---
Sombra out here spreading the lords truth. Gz
---
jeeeez. unreal
---
Sorry for all your dislikes, I get what you meant cause i thought so too at first, that he was comparing Jeffs IRL bank to someones RS bank.
---
Tin and copper make bronze
---
Clean herbs from slayer. Flesh crawlers or chaos druids.
---
Just saying I have beef with him, i‚Äôd rather take advice from someone who doesn‚Äôt do what he does
---
Just did it! Wow, I hope this works!!!! Theres a light at the end of the tunnel! Illuminarian may be once again!
---
Are you in fixed mode? In fixed you can't hide the chat box
---
200m xp only using bird snares/ crimson swift btw
---
Evscape AND solo mission
---
Damn, before even Runecrafting came out.
---
Maybe it's similar falut as the freeze lags by demonic gorillas. Try reinstall Runelite if your launcher version is earlier than 2.0.0 or 2.0.2
---
Thank you
---
You either get a drop or you dont
---
Also with Elon being involved since series A funding and getting to the point it is now. I‚Äôd say Elon had a pretty big hand in why it became as big as it is. And he still wasn‚Äôt forced out for that reason lol. Can you google?
---
Literally unplayable but unironically. I always instantly abandon any FashionScape with clipping issues.
---
Where did I ever mention Elon being forced out?
---
Clean herbs, make potions!
---
If it's early herblore levels, chaos druids drop a good amount of herbs. Late game it's all about getting herb seeds and doing herb runs.
---
He grinded 17 runecrafting last night
---
No cause those are BIS legs. It‚Äôs affects your game. Pets don‚Äôt
---
Goodluck?
---
A bond is worth 5.4 million gold right now. 10 Bonds can be bought for 70 USD. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of 110.2 Billion USD. So if Jeff Bezos was able to fully liquefy his net worth without ruining its value and convert it to bonds, then sell them without crashing the price of bonds (neither of those things is actually possible), he would have about 85 quadrillion gold.
---
Not an iron so idk exactly. 
---
Maybe Farming runs, kingdom herbs, Abby spectres, herbiboar?
---
without knowing what stage of the game you're in it's difficult to give the best answer. My ironman is fairly early game. I fish monkfish or do barb fishing as my AFK activity. If you have access to bowstrings chopping yew logs isn't a bad play either. After I (eventually) get 99 fishing my AFK activity will swap to cooking and then I'll be chopping oaks to bank construction experience.
---
That‚Äôs not how stats work. If you are on the drop rate for an item you‚Äôve got about a 63% chance or something like that to actually get it lol.
---
Nobody PKs because the barrier to entry is insanely high. The mechanics in this game are actually difficult compared to a lot of other games and then add on to the fact that you‚Äôre at a legitimate disadvantage if you don‚Äôt build your account a certain way, and you get a very difficult part of the game to get into.
---
Nice
---
I mean I‚Äôd look, but genuinely curious, what point is there of paying attention to him for an extended period of time? Like he‚Äôs not gonna teach you how to make another Amazon because he‚Äôd just do it himself if that were the case lol. Unless he offers to pay for something for you, is there a purpose?
---
MLM question - how many trip to the hopper can one make? I understood 28 x 3 trips was the max but some are saying you can go a 4th time even without a coal sack or any other extra upgrades.
---
I maxed thru slayer, didn't even hit 99 combats by 99.
---
I play for myself tho and my own achievements. Not to flex on others
---
Gz on lvl 2 Photoshop!
---
Yes I am talking about the recovery system as that is what Jagex redirect me to when I click the option stating I am unable to access the email. So therefore I follow the steps as instructed by Jagex and where does that get me? To a recovery form that is telling me my password is incorrect even though I'm logged in to the account. You linking me what you just linked has completely proven my point btw. You have just shown me there is another avenue to reach their support team. Why does that prove my point that their system is bad? Because if I go to their support page and select the options/answers relevant to me, it directs me to account recovery. To get to the page you linked, I had to click no to everything. So I had to put in the wrong answer for everything to get directed to the place you linked. Is that a working system that's easy to navigate? Obviously not cause why would I click no to the answers when that would be lying...
---
Imagine getting a skillcape for its stats. üòÇ An obby cape has the exact same defensive stats.
---
Yes. Tassets arent mandatory whatsoever
---
It‚Äôs pretty funny to me how these memes are proving the age old comic book argument about super heroes playing to the male fantasy.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôve been doing slayer in there for 8 months, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a task without 1
---
How is this nsfw?
---
his [twitter](https://twitter.com/homerosrs?) says he's at 42? maybe he doesn't update it and he has more, if i'm wrong that's my mistake
---
That fucking sucks man sucks the life from you
---
Well it's not like he's there to hand out money, so I can understand the students.
---
I'd gladly work customer service for Jagex as well if I could do it from home. Based out of Canada. Glad I'm not one of the few that are willing to help out.
---
fucking capitalism lmaooo. riight how dare the government let people trade freely. we should be like north korea
---
You can also buy them.
---
I could easily argue it's more important that horrendous rng is prevented from ruining your game by putting caps on actual important items, than on functionless pets.
---
Bruh you forgot to mention the 4 hours of botting you apparently did lmao. Almost maxed out and you decide to bot nice.
---
Back in original Rs2, my first 99 was cooking (the untrimmed cape was quite funny), followed by 99 runecrafting. Seems odd to think back that I wouldn‚Äôt just try some skills on between those two extremities...
---
Dude he never said anything about Elon being forced out
---
This is WRONG. Why are people consistently saying this. There was A CLIP OF EV SCAPE SWITCHING TO PROT MAGIC WITHOUT GOING TO PRAYER INTERFACE POSTED IN THIS REDDIT RECENTLY. IT WAS DELETED AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS. EV SHAME ON YOU AND THIS IS EMBARRASSING
---
EDIT: I remember it was posted and how surprised I was, the man was doing zulrah and got caught cheating. I commented on this post but I am having trouble finding this video now. I am crossing my fingers someone has it and will reupload the clip because this is weird
---
Ah thanks! We actually did a few DK runs this month.
---
You've never played this game on a desktop if you think a tablet is the best way to play this game
---
Raise your stats and always default to praying against the attack you have the least defence against when they switch styles. Sounds like for you that would be mage. Walking back to determine if they will use melee or not is too tedious for me, and it cuts into kill time if you‚Äôre using melee when they switch. I started trying to kill them with 48 defence and 61 attack and got a similar kill count per trip to what you‚Äôre getting, but now that I have 70+ in both and significantly better gear my results are night and day to what they were. I was using a dscim and blessed d hide; now I use a blessed Sara sword with a Karils top and Veracs plate skirt. Being on task helps a lot too.
---
eat brick kid
---
I don't think it's racsst
---
You're talking about a country not a race
---
Their argument is that essentially they don't want to remake content that is already released when they can spend their really precious time producing new exciting content, which is fair but negates being able to explore old content that we used to experience.
---
I mean. I can google how the prick got rich.
---
try out taverley instead of brimhaven, theres a huge mob of black demons that are cannonable
---
But hey, that's just a theory... that I agree with.

Stealing Creation seems cool but doesn't it require Summoning to be in the game?
---
Man, I was having a terrible night and this brightened it up a little.
---
It is and membership still make more money
---
Imagine being so upset over internet points. Stay on reddit youre not wanted elsewhere.
---
Make sure you have f-keys for easy prayer and gear switch. Tip* get your prayer on before moving to the "safespot" or you'll get stacked by the money snek
---
I don't remember it requiring summoning? Couldn't it be done just fine without?
---
Im gonna give you a swirly you nerd.
---
I understand your pain, i have 99 smithing and every other comment is SeE hOw HaRd It Is To GeT rUnEcRaFtInG like i get it its hard but let us have this we all worked hard for our 99s
---
A wolf can run at a speed of 40 miles per hour during a chase. Wolves have long legs and spend most of their time trotting at a speed of 7-10 miles per hour. They can keep up a reasonable pace for hours and have been known to cover distances of 55 miles in one night.
---
Realize you're probably gonna die a few times. If you kill on your first attempt, whatever. Just accept that it's a hard learning curve.
---
For actual advice? Minimize your switches as much as you can. If you've got a 6 or 7 item switch, you're gonna be changing your stuff more often than actually looking at zulrah.
---
Void range/mage is your friend here. A 3 or 4 item switch will help you a lot as you'll be able to focus more on doing dps instead of doing switches for a boss you don't yet know.
---
Maybe they don't want to remake content that abusers used to trick J-Mods in the past. Maybe it could be done without Summoning too.
---
just, stop mentioning china okay all the WOW people who don't know are coming to osrs. the more people mention it for no reason in osrs the more likely CCCP is to show up and turn off chat
---
I'm keen
---
Hey now. Emerald is fucking awesome.
---
You're using the meme wrong
---
Its called "swolesome" for a reason
---
Take a break from questing if it's burning you out
---
start business, expense everything as business, 'invest' in 'research' , business makes no money = zero taxes
---
I‚Äôm on 2550kc no pet. At one point I had 2 bludgeon pieces in bank and my next 6 unsired were as follows: whip,jar,whip,jar,whip,jar.
---
It did avoid damage every now and again, but for me on both mobile and pc much more often than not I'd take the hits despite clicking/tapping as fast as I could
---
??? I got 1 letter wrong with the letter right next to it
---
Yes it is
---
I feel like people miss the point of what pets are supposed to be. I don‚Äôt believe they were added as a mathematical thing you calculate, then begin the long grind To achieve. They were meant to be a happy accident when grinding *any* boss. Rather than think ‚ÄúI need to grind this one boss 4000 times for this specific pet‚Äù, think how many different bosses you do throughout your runescape career. Odds are you‚Äôll get a pet at some point if you do varied things, and if you‚Äôre not thinking about it because you haven‚Äôt spent the past 6 months grinding the boss, you‚Äôll be all the happier
---
:D knowing that brightens my day too
---
I know you're not OP but I'm adding to you.
---
Switch prayers first. 
---
Then run to the next spot.
---
Switch gear on the run. 
---
Maintain DPS as much as possible. 
---
Use https://nightfirecat.github.io/zulrahguide/
---
It helped me a lot.
---
I got my first 99 on the 10 year anniversary of starting my account. Still proud though
---
Man it took me 17+m xp to get one. Gz
---
If you‚Äôre learning and not just tanking for first diary kills, I‚Äôve recently started doing it. Here‚Äôs some pointers that helped me:
---
*theres a GitHub called Zulrah Rotations. I put it half on my screen and RS on the other half
---
*bastion potions are great for the extra defense
---
*swap prayers first, then click to the location you need to be. Swap gear while moving to that location
---
*personally, I used long ranged for my blowpipe the first couple of kills. You can use rapid, but placement has to be exact in certain phases
---
*stay above 50hp during blue phases as she can easily combo you out with her back to back 30+hp attacks
---
*bring a second ring of recoil, at least until you get the hang of it
---
*eat during phase swaps. Potions are fine if necessary
---
*if on RL, consider a suicide run of marking tiles and Zul
---
*eat before jad phase and make sure you have adequate prayer. During jad phase, don‚Äôt panic swap. If you get hit, keep it on the prayer you have. I find it best to swap prayer when the projectile is half way to your toon
---
*there is a bank deposit box in the shack next to the Zul Andra tele location. Use it to store extra food you bring when you come back to get your stuff.
---
I love PC, wish it had a pet so I could happily farm it.
---
machamp would be banned for using macros. two builds in one click??
---
That's the only way I do most of my Runescaping. Hulu and Netflix are a god send
---
I mean that‚Äôs just simply not true. They‚Äôre going to be giving actual advice. They obviously have survivorship bias. But they can give you some of the fundamental building blocks to get yourself going.
---
I sat in my chair and thought ‚Äúfuck I knew I was gonna die like this‚Äù and it happened anyway
---
&gt; an extra player means the zalcano kill is less efficient for everyone.
---
UHH it's more efficient since it's less tephra thrown per player. Not my fault they were dick-ish when I came in, it's cute how you defend derogatory language that wasn't warranted though. :)
---
What?
---
How are they proving that, and who even makes that argument? Of course it's people's fantasy, that's why they're popular fiction books
---
A good majority of the WOW community most likely will not last long on OSRS, as the games are the same genre but fairly different in reality. Not saying this to be negative about WOW, I absolutely adored WOW for years before and during the MOP expansion. However, the only way to truly fix the situation is to bring all possible situations to light.
---
4s are the most efficient.
---
I am not defending anything, i am saying you need to get over it instead of crying over your hurt feelings
---
Idk, is this real?
---
I know right, damn brits.
---
You can get way over 135k per hour with chins
---
These are just getting lazy
---
Like you couldn't sit there for 30 secs to add a funny caption to it?
---
Its swolesome meme, not just "oh hes buff at a PC haha"
---
Lol im dumb
---
99 cooking is for chicks and queers
---
I got to 95 cooking but then a friend told me it would be a waste to have that be my untrimmed. Two weeks later he got his first 99 in cooking
---
I can think most of the people on this sub are assholes and also not care about imaginary internet points lol. They're not mutually exclusive
---
I‚Äôm 2550 kc in and no pet... why can‚Äôt I get this lucky.
---
There's actually a lot of passive things you can do to generate income/exp.
---
* Your Kingdom really only needs to be checked once a week, and you can use a Ring of Wealth to get there, making it really easy to upkeep. 
---
* The Varrock diaries allow you to buy battlestaffs from Zaff at a discounted price once per day, with the amount increasing per diary tier completed.
---
* If you like economics and have a large enough cash stack (~10M), you can use it to start flipping. Your orders often don't auto-complete right away, so if you place your orders before bed, they have the whole night to be completed before you wake up. I definitely wouldn't try this without a solid foundation though, as the wrong investment could fuck your bank if you're not careful.
---
* If you're not doing Tears of Guthix, you should do them. Once a week for decent exp in a skill you probably don't enjoy training anyway.
---
I don't have them on hand, but there are several guides for maximizing your progress with minimal time invested. Mobile helps a ton with this, especially for easy things like Zaff which take at most 2 minutes to complete.
---
I dont see a jar though?
---
How is that even possible
---
5k Hydra kills not a single claw here
---
Naw, theres a max gp an account can have anyway.  Gotta convert that wealth into items.
---
I'm confused on why someone down voted my post for asking a question lol.
---
I mean one guy is the CEO of one of the biggest company in the world and one flips burgers at mcdonalds
---
Cuntgratations!
---
Just get it lmao
---
Nah just step to step prep.
---
You are literally a god among men
---
The issue is this Jagex now acknowledge that false positives are a thing, yet there is no formal appeal process outside of twitter.
---
Yeah I tried Zulrah w my stats and had a shitty time but I'm not opposed to skilling and getting reqs for Ds2. Just need to workout the money for it.
---
Make some money, go questing, train skills.
---
The wiki has a great f2p moneymaking guide. Cooks assistant and romeo and juliet have great QP rewards. Get 32 quest points and then go slay elvarg. After that, see if you cant become a member.
---
Because it takes a lot longer. 77-99 RC with bloods and then souls at 90 takes around 200+ hours. 
---
Not necessarily more "difficult" just takes a lot longer. &amp; that's fine. Some people like to sit there for a long time just crafting runes for a few weeks. Other people like quick 99s like cooking/firemaking etc. &amp; that's also fine. A 99 is a 99 imho.
---
Being elitist/gatekeeping etc kills the game real quickly for new people. Any 99 is cause for celebration.
---
but the prices change doe
---
Most of those bots are super low level so as they get removed they would just create more. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt work on removing, but outright getting rid of them is a monsterous tackle.
---
I use mage and range. I find the halberd annoying to use too
---
It's definitely dramatically went up sense then. The amount of alchables, and straight up cash we get from emblem statues, ECT is crazy these days.
---
The community isn't as obsessed with gold sinks as they where in the day, I think the community is just used the the change of value in gold now. It's very similar to the economy before removal of free trade.
---
Ill get my morytania hard diaries done before I start camping barrows for gp just because it makes it a little bit better :)
---
That‚Äôs what bank chests are
---
Game will last 4 more years tops. I‚Äôll bet my wife‚Äôs virginity on this.
---
Tremendously disappointed and believe whoever designed this task system runs a bot farm. These tasks aren‚Äôt fun and no pker will do them.
---
I play how I want to play and you're shitting on me for that. You called me a douche on the internet and ill tell ya what you almost hurt my feelings. 
---
Btw, shitting on people for flexing their first 99 being a boring and generic 99 after playing since 1999. People without 99s can flex whatever they want. They're all cute noobs fishing for positive internet points.
---
Last run I got 4K total worth with diary done as well ://///
---
I'm a public accountant, not a manager, so I was unaware what metric CLTV was.  I think the only people that could know that would be Jagex themselves.
---
Regardless, if you think Jagex became successful without experienced managers and "business acumen", you may be correct; however they would have grown to be much, much larger with a great management.
---
In the name of Harambee, free monkeylad
---
You should bring alchs
---
Gz on 99 fletching
---
In the context of runescape quests, it is definitely one of the more challenging ones.
---
Runescape quests aren‚Äôt difficult when you read a guide literally telling you what to do step by step.
---
Salarin the twisted?
---
how do you fall for this
---
or just suicide with the essence next to the altar, 1 hr to get your boosts, which means less stress :)
---
good for them. you shouldnt be impressed by some giant evil businessman who exploits millions.
---
A friend of mine just got his first 99 a few months ago on his account (ive known him for about 8 years now).  He decided to go with fletching because it was my first 99 ;-;.
---
Catatafish made a salmon suck asshole..
---
Nice pet, but the grind is never over.
---
How the hell do you fall for a doubling scam?
---
Save us rune chain Bois some puss bro! You're gonna take it all!
---
Storing data for 200M accounts might as well be free these days.
---
At the same time pets are literally cosmetic and it would devalue all existing pets. You don't NEED to grind pets to better your account so being opposed to this isn't a strange concept.
---
But the majority of players have hundreds of hours in account(s) that aren't specialized in pvp. I personally never tried pvp because of the barrier to entry. It costs a lot, often isn't profitable, and you just get destroyed by pures.
---
The issue isn't the amount of time, it's that it's a huge time investment that doesn't transfer to anything else. Most pvp accounts seem to be specifically crafted, meaning I need to start all over from scratch and pour tons of time into a new account that does nothing but pvp, or I get trashed by any mediocre player with such an account.
---
Entirety hider on runelite. Allows you to hide other peoples character.
---
Not really a question about the game itself but why do people randomly start talking shit to me when I‚Äôm in the Grand Exchange? Like they‚Äôll randomly say ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs a weirdo‚Äù or ‚Äú[Username] is a scammer‚Äù when I‚Äôve never even met them. I don‚Äôt even talk in the GE lol.  Just thought it was weird that this has happened a couple of times.
---
im sure the girl scapers are gushing over this shit
---
This is a mobile game. Duh.
---
Yes they do. It's EHP for ironmen and it's faster than Zeah while being much more chill than lava's for normal accounts.
---
Don't starve to death
---
thank you so much this is what it was :D
---
pure and f2p, thats a big yikes
---
I still don‚Äôt have a 99... I almost have base 70 including rcing I feel like that‚Äôs a bigger achievement
---
Beating cows to death is a wholesome activity I'll have you know.
---
No visible boost only stacks with invisible boost wc guild or crystal saw for example
---
I think it‚Äôs the key loot that you‚Äôre thinking of from him too. He doesn‚Äôt drop notes if I recall.
---
Won't have enough for a whip by the time you hit 70 but you should start doing birdhouses regularly. Consistently profitable and gets you passive hunter levels. I'm hitting 66 today solely from doing that for the last 2 weeks or so.
---
It's 2 minutes of effort once an hour.
---
üèÖ
---
It's like Thanos snapped away D.B. Weiss, abducted David Benioff, fucked  him bloody for ruining S8 GoT, and subsequently created this byproduct-of-a-man to rebalance the show. Valar Morghulis.
---
you do you :)
---
Work too I do this shit on mobile, easy way to get fishing xp and cooking xp and have food for slayer
---
I'd go for quest cape / do slayer when you get bored of quests
---
kinda? You need to prove your research, funding, purpose etc, and you can only expense the costs during the years they occur
---
basically every business loses money in the beginning, the more you lose, the more you can carry the loss forward
---
What if its just pkers washing away the germs of the skillers. Thats why the hands are white lol
---
yea i couldnt recall anything about him except decient noted herbs, thank you for your help!!
---
Drink runecrafting tears
---
.....
---
Is that Tatted Strength?
---
reality is often disappointing
---
Nice grind, but the per is never over.
---
That‚Äôs why I learned to photoshop
---
Why are the double letters crooked?
---
More than 5175000
---
Firemaking is my highest. I think I got it to about 94. Honestly that was pretty easy. Since I don‚Äôt really want to buy a bunch of stuff to cook, I don‚Äôt think cooking will be that easy for me. Though I‚Äôm also on RS3, not OSRS.
---
I am so happy for you, cutest pet in the game with the seasonal santa hat on.
---
It‚Äôs only efficient to start slayer at 85 or 100 combat if you are going for max and rush training combat most people just train regular slayer wildly slayer is best imo for lower levels
---
I fucking had a billionaire drop party randomly while I was at the ge, dude dropped 250m in items... I got 1.4m
---
Be aware that you can hide behind the pillars to avoid the blue zulrah, and you could use the magic only method to kill it :)
---
I think it was just because pkers are known to be even sweatier than the other sub-groups of osrs.
---
Natural talent for being unlucky :d
---
Maybe a little, but not quite, I'm a big completionist and feel the need to surpass my original account, my fear is more that I will ditch all other hobbies to play OSRS
---
Nobody see the irony that every comment on this swolesome meme attempt is critical of OP lol
---
O and did I mention a form of usuable customer service
---
My only advice for you; hot pockets and mountain dew. Never quit.
---
No. But there are websites that value accounts. Quick Google search would get you there. Should you sell your account for actual money? No. Can you? Technically yes.
---
I‚Äôm gonna collectivize your toothbrush.
---
r/woooosh
---
You get kicked if you're not playing on mobile, because if you're playing on mobile you're able to 'scape while getting those sick gains.
---
Yeah I tell people if they ask what I play . If you're ashamed to tell them you need new friends.
---
Damn this picture of me is going around quick I better show my mom
---
Hol up, what did you break?
---
Looks like it's going to be 5 moths
---
I just want to mention a few things here. First you need to be aware of the dangers. Always. I lost my hcim skiller doing medium clue as i forgot you can spawn a wizard which pretty much oneshot me. Second being, its possible to safespot some monsters and cannon stall hit them then recoil. So some items or quests are achievable. You can also drop trick air talismans. Others can be obtained through implings or random events. Good luck. Btw castle wars minigame teleport then run to catherby. Beware of bears and bats.

Yeah all you can do for now is go to 1250+ worlds to avoid them. Doesn't solve the problem, but that's all you can do

She got billions and at that point doe it even matter how much you got?
---
Like seriously even if he actually gave her half he'd be richer than God.
---
I mean it's a perfectly fine setup if you're 60-70
---
Can you try that again in English?
---
Downvotes? Why do people dislike the truth??

"First, a quick look at Amazon‚Äôs¬†financial statements¬†shows it¬†does pay taxes. In 2017,¬†Amazon paid close to $1 billion in income tax. In 2018, the amount jumped to $1.18 billion, accounting for local, state, and international taxes."

Arms look so short lol. Looks like a double amputee waving his stumps around.

Lol was just doing this.. spend near an hour for the bronze... shiiet

That's such a stupid argument to make. Yes of course Jagex is a business. Of course their goal is to make money. Of course they released Old School to make money. Still, people forget that there are actual people working on it. Assuming they completely agree with the decisions Jagex made is just as Braindead.
---
I don't know why you are even talking about loyalty, what does that have to do with anything? I plainly said that it's okay to criticize Jagex when they deserve it, and it's okay to completely disagree with them.
---
Saying that they are the "worst company ever" is just stupid bullshit. There are far far worse game companies out there, who don't go through half the effort Jagex does to communicate. 
---
Anyway half the time the community is talking out of their ass when it comes to things like anti bot and anti macro tools. Way oversimplifying things and acting like its just an easy task to make a perfect anti bot system. 
---
Of course it's bullshit to lose major progress like some have claimed. It's perfectly okay to be unhappy with Jagex, you don't need to blindly agree with everything and I never implied that anyway. 
---
I'm just fucking sick of seeing the same complaints and same memes over and over. Directly attacking mods whom are just communicating the decisions of the company is pointless. Things could be so, so, so much worse. Calling them the worst company ever is absolutely ridiculous and uncalled for. Voice your opinions when necessary, don't just start shitting out memes anytime you are unhappy
---
Lol love this. Wish most players acted this way instead of saying ‚Äú**** off loser‚Äù or **** like that. Great satire :P
---
But does this actually increase gp/hr over losing a inventory slot?
---
&gt;but Jagex can know if ur trading to a different IP address or not. That's why u don't get banned for RWT if you transfer bils of gp between your own accounts
---
Than....
---
crater was shit lmao
---
Forsaken is a cc?
---
Its a lobster not a crabü¶Äü¶Ä

Justice for MONKEYFART34
---
I don‚Äôt agree with unbanning but working on the appeals process and giving players an avenue to pursue false-positives better for sure. It does happen and it‚Äôs not fair
---
Yes you but you have a higher chance of having flipped tails in those 100 flips.
---
F2P will always have bots.
---

---
I linked your channel in the description
---
For F2p just do air runes, honestly the xp/hr at the absolute best is 20k/hr and you need a bunch of skull scepter pieces and energy pots and fally teleports to do that.
---
For members Just ZMI through the safe path.
---
The abyss could also be used without talismans but the multi ring would be very risky with 10hp
---
Jagex: why not both?
---
Hey maybe he didn‚Äôt get the message. We respect the effort anyways!
---
now this is fucking gold.
---
ITT people who only see the world (and memes) through a racial lense.
---
Idk, while pvm pets don‚Äôt make sense that much, pvp pets would probably make even less sense
---
i have no friends and no coworkers, so yes and no?
---
Hp is more common than cooking cape
---
Gz mate. 10/10 would upvote again
---
that inventory is nauseating.
---
appreciate you, King üí™üèΩ
---
Lmfao serioouusly tho
---
Just Google fairy ring _________. You'll have the code in like 5 seconds.
---
‚ÄúLol idk why these memes make me so hard‚Äù
---
I thought all accounts from back then that were inactive were deleted? three times or so they went and openned up usernames. or was that just a username release?
---
Not that these beer thirsty bots can make an impact on the game. Its just a sad thing to see. I worry about new players seeing these things going on and then leaving the game..
