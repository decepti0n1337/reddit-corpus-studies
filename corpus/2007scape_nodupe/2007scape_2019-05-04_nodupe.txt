Getting the kills faster is usually whats most important for wildy bosses, and scorpia is basically mage only, so its good to have 2 ppl around incase of a pker.

I literally have a task of 145 hellhounds. How canny
---
Well you‚Äôre in the OSRS subreddit boi
---
Streamers is hard to say. YouTube theres plenty. Theoatrix is a great start with all his guides. Also learn to love slayermusiq1 for quest guides. You'll thank me later for that one
---
Wow, that's ridiculously low.  It seems like paying that low is a huge security risk, as it incentivizes people who legitimately need more money screwing you over because they have access to the codebase of a multi million dollar company
---
Hellhounds are terrible money, no bones about it.
---
Dickhead lol
---
Tanzoo and virtoso (I think that's there names) they do para challenges. It's pretty funny

---
I also like EVscape, he is doing a tonnnn of content right now and would take you a good chunk of time to watch it from the beginning which I recommend doing if you're afk and looking to kill time.

Ffs I saw this last week, cropped a screenshot of it and was gonna use it on the next lewd Zuharr pic

and here you come in like a Neanderthal just like stating it, was that even a joke why am I getting so worked up about this

Bots are only going to get more advanced.  Jagex's bot detection cannot hope to keep up.
---
The only way to stop botting is to require some form of identity verification when registering.  A verified social media account, or a debit/credit card.
---
Both of those won't happen since they hurt profits.
---
This meme originated in like 2014 if not earlier so I doubt
---
my tip was for someone Who is building their block list ( and said they blocked steels and skipped hellhounds) and starting to get into slayer by the time you get to cerb you can unblock hellhounds and block something else. I also hope that anyone who has reached that level of slayer would be able to make that decision themselves as they are probably no longer a new player in the game.
---
&gt;has had their drop tables inflated due to slayer 
---
I really think it's the fact that everyone and their pet does clue scrolls along with the focus on efficiency above all else.
---
Sure and while we‚Äôre at it Party Pete as a pet too. 1/10,000 chance you get him when using the dance emote!

You like giving out bonds to mems by any chance?

These ACTUAL crabs are getting better customer service than us.

Why do you go into threads you're not interested in and post your shitty ass useless comments? It's spamming up this post.
---
yeah you're right for sure, just wanted to point it out.
---
I just realized the river has a name.
---
i think you ment to type the oposite of what you wrote but yeah in theory ffa and split will have the same average in the long run. but that has to be over thousands and thousands of raids since the valuable shit are giga rare. so ffa is basically taking a gamble on getting items on lower kc than their drop rate which can either do you very good, fuck you over, or just average. its a gamble

Yes you can! I was just giving a tip to someone who seemed to have low level slayer.

its a bit more complicated than that since ruby bolt and diamond bolt spec are not equal frequency

you solve (assuming kandarin hard completeion)

93.4%*BoltDPS + (6.6%*20%*VorkathHP)/AttackSpeed = 89%*BoltDPS + (11%*1.15%*BoltMaxHit/2)/AttackSpeed

You can safespot all the enemies easily so you have time to think about whatever. And idk maybe bust out pencil and paper or mspaint or something and scout out the place and then use your notes/maps to figure it out instead of running around there for hours.
---
yikes, dude... even if you arent familiar with the scam its just obvious.
---
the fact you're months after the fact and still not sure what happened is hilarious to me. there really are some fools running around this giant ass game

Same thing with compost for people trying to do Hosidious favor in one go
---
Fair enough, I just prefer to block things that aren‚Äôt profitable or easy to do, and that guide made things pretty straightforward and how to do that. Sure I could just skip hounds until i‚Äôm high enough level for Cerberus I suppose, but by taking them in profitable areas, I see no harm in keeping my block option(s) free for other things that are undesirable.

Yea I miss the time where they schemed and had sex and whores until those schemes ended up in what we have now.

You don't stay boosted at you max level all the time,the extra 3 strength bonus should at the very least let you maintain max hits for longer.

How about access to the dark wizard's tower East of Falador as a reward? It's currently members but no one goes there... Could put in some interesting high-level monster in the basement to make it worth it.

Yeah wtf why would they use more than 3 polygons for anything?!?!?!?!?!??????????????
---
i didnt post it before
---
konar tasks take longer to do you would make more gp just killing a boss instead

It all depends on what you‚Äôre training on. Make sure to pair the right wep and attack style to the monsters weakness.

This was all on sand crabs, not sure if they have a specific weakness

The biggest mistake I think you're making here is the assumption that all events spawn equally.  [This](https://prnt.sc/j217ep) was my data collected over almost 700 hours in non-wilderness areas.  Genie, while a lot more common than the surprise exam, is still pretty uncommon compared to other events.

It's literally an arms-race. Botting used to be way worse, trust me when I say they've made a lot of improvements. Botwatch was a huge step for Jagex and has had a lot of success. The issue is neither side will ever stop development. There will always be new methods, new scripts, new ways to conceal your bot. Jagex has a few guys working 9-5 on this shit whereas you might have literally thousands of players around the world in bot development, who the fuck knows.

6 brews are 19k. 110k for 11-12ish restores. Scales are 294k for 1600. That puts the total at 294-300k. I was off by quite a bit from 500, but that's much closer than 25k

I‚Äôm an Ironman with 61 range currently although i am going to train it a lot. I have a rune crossbow but I‚Äôm wondering what the best bolts were that i could use but also would be easily accessible. I think  rune bolts are going to be hard to come by so what would be good alternatives.
---
Probably Frontier or Spirit
---
Lots of people.
---
That's why I'm very happy with the way kagex is dealing with powercreep. Very minimal upgrades will make this game last a long time

Ive never lost a clue scroll up there I just bring pray pots and if I get a clue I either run down south and tele or go towards the lever. I only bring monks robes so I could drop everything and pray +1 item

Brimhaven agility dungeon is the highest xp/hr when you are very high agility (something like 97+)

I never knew runescape had an actually significant rp base, but wow...

Better than not.  Plus the many other things I've seen it block and stop over the years.  Never had to worry about any issues, and I have been to some sketchy sites. For me it's proven to mean multiple occasions no matter who all doesn't like it. Quite frankly I can care less if people do or not.  It's always worked for me. Sometimes a little too good.   But thanks for chiming in on your opinion.

let's ban all toxic racist players from OSRS!!!!

News report: OSRS player base drops by whopping 73%
---
Except the content is beyond simple and takes seconds.  Good design would be having something like a VERY profitable minigame in the wild that requires players to take their time, and preferably be content that is best done in PvP gear.  Meaning that players doing the content without intention of killing others will be prepared to fight for what they get, while people who aim to kill others will have a decent chance to get decent stuff.
---
Instead we get "run here with valuable stuff from somewhere else and dig for a moment, then run away while hoping that nobody shows up in those 20-30 seconds."  What part of that is good game design?  That's fucking retarded design.
---
Why stop there, slay irl dwarfs for slayer exp. throw hedgehogs around for ranging
---
6327.
---
Want
---
valuable stuff? I do wildy clues in black dhide, whip, spade and clue. you dont have to risk shit for clue scrolls
---
Wow, how did you get two friends?
---
You can do it before the boss is even spawned, just find the right tiles.
---
Also you can do it during the kill, my recommendation being starting at the back of the boss room.
---
Hey guys, Ninendrew here.
---
Wait... Vorkath is not even hard.
---
Nothing is worse than when the loser is quiet. Even flaming and insulting the winners is less awkward than just silence
---
People merching?
---
Just because you don't risk it doesn't mean you don't bring something valuable with you.  Is that your only retort to piss poor game design?
---
Vorkath is really easy idk why this guy had this much difficulty
---
Might be an unpopular opinion, I don't know, but if there's one thing I miss from RS3, it's the quests. They definitely improved there. Love Story, Blood Runs Deep (I miss Balmung...), the Mahjarrat questline and The World Wakes, all really fun quests IMO.
---
I just want a grand exchange type thing in priff after the elf quest is released. Sort of how it is in rs3.
---
it really isnt, with 90+ range and def using blowpipe spec to heal gets you more kills per hour than using bgs
---
6001
---
it really isnt, with 90+ range and def using blowpipe spec to heal gets you more kills per hour than using bgs  if you are below 90 range then maybe then its worth using the bgs since you might need it but with 90+ range you hardly hit 0s.
---
&gt;lists two of the most unpopular Antivirus
---
Do people just not pay attention?  I don‚Äôt see how this could ever possibly work lmao
---
below 90 range maybe, after 90 range you rarely hit 0s, at 99 its even less of a question. so if anything bgs is only worth low level.
---
May wanna look into blessed dhide for the range bonus as well as prayer bonus if your gonna be praying.
---
Unpopular isn't the right word for those.  Shit better suits them.

It's a browser game from the mid 2000's. You're fine.

Tbh game was already going to shit before the EoC, it was just the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of players.
---
Can't u just play on unrestricted worlds
---
But it‚Äôs allowed so you wouldn‚Äôt be banned? You do realize default windows mouse keys have always been ok? It‚Äôs AHK and scripting that is not, so if OP was actually saying it every time that would be a user input action, therefore not bannable
---
Just bring a slayer staff and set it to auto cast crumble. Then you can just switch weapons and no need to use the spellbook at all
---
Not intentionally, the bonds would be sold regardless.
---
This guy pks clue hunters, what do you expect of him?
---
You can but they aren't always available to play on.
---
I'm in a clan that requires to apply. They do this mainly to check whether people have the minimum stats and gear to join. (The clan is Divine PvM btw and it's legit, some YouTubers have done PvM with them).
---
My previous clan also had this "apply" method in the forums mainly to see whether you have the necessary runecrafting level and whether you have read the rules, because they had hidden in plain sight a line of text that you had to copy to prove that you've read their rules.
---
There is nothing wrong with applying to a clan, since it keeps out amateurs away, especially if it's a clan aimed at higher level content. What you should look out for are links, because legitimate clans give you instructions on what to Google or search on official forums to find their post and never give actual links.
---
Yeah Snakelings aren't a problem, even using mystic might and a magic pot! I'll try rotation 3 which that is and see how it goes!

Also get that mage level up, a good portion of your mage defense stats are rolled on your mage level itself, not just defensive stats provided by armor. This'll keep them from landing freezes on you so easily

Sell your bank and buy a dhcb. Best decision I've had so far.

Holy shit this is a life saver. Thanks a bunch!

Iron or Fe in name is simply asking to get crashed. No excuses

One ironman being toxic is proof that ALL of them are entitled and should then be permanently banned? Yeah I'm pretty sure you're right, that's some flawless reasoning.

This is a lot to take in

Good effort.

Downvoted.
---
His account is pretty low for what you'd think, and he streamed a few times and was pretty average.
---
He wasn't ever really known for raw skill or game knowledge, mostly just account progression. His account on osrs isn't very good.
---
I did mine first try on the question then proceeded ot spend 1.2 mil trying to get 1 KC after the quest. I can do it pretty Weill now tho just gotta practice.
---
Do you just afk to get hit by all that lol
---
PvM death, yes
---
PvP, no
---
I gotta remember this when I‚Äôm there on alts.
---
Dont try and woox walk, looks like ur ping is as shit as mine. Just walk around on that phase.
---

---
Yeah, it might be more efficient to get avernic before, i havnt started tob and idk how many hours it is on average to get it.. But there should be several items from Cox that helps tob right? Tbow, kodai, claws and both prayers? And only really hilt and staff that helps for Cox?
---
But if you have the experience from before tob might not be that hard to do early. .
---
I have a photo of 16 kc ring of the gods!
---
For some of it... yes. I tab out thinking he *probably* won't fire ball.. He did. It hurt ):
---
let's see    
---
All hail king /u/chrisCGC
---
I agree that strength is much better for dps but strength never increases accuracy and past 96 strength can increase your max hit dependent on how potted you are.
---
75 totems between 2 accounts.. only 1 claw and an onyx. REEEEEEEEEE
---
Any good ways to train my magic and range from 70 to 80 somewhat quickly and make decent profit?  As it stands I'm doing barrows runs for gp and then slayer when I want to actually train but if I could get both done at once it'd be nice.
---
too bad it‚Äôs the same logic being used against pvp
---
What is the problem? I'm scrolling through reddit, doing 5 kill vorkath trips with supplies left and I play like 2 times per month :(
---
oh god
---
have a sip of an antifire
---
Don't poke vorkath and just stand in front of him. Then act like your woox walking by clicking on him to poke but he never wakes up.
---
Also, the rhythm of staying alive is the same speed as rs game ticks so you could play that also and learn to click to the rhythm
---
Do it! Hold it up high! Let everyone know
---
Honestly just explore around and do some things you havnt seen before!
---
I got my first ever membership 13 years ago, I was pick pocketing men in lumby and some1 gave me a full set of ham robes lol.
---
Might I suggest trying to do the monkey madness quest as a current goal
---
People fall for it because they're stupid.  It's that simple.
---
Keep questing and set a goal of completing Recipe For Disaster. That will keep you busy for quite a while, and you‚Äôll come up with goals you want to accomplish afterwards while doing all the requirements for that quest.
---
hashtags and emojis should stay buried with EoC
---
I recall hearing that the damage distribution in this game is coded in a way that a higher max hit = more accuracy since there is one more non-zero value that you can roll on. Is that inaccurate?

&gt;Again with claws, how do you save the hundreds of hours using claws over dds?
---
If you want to use that argument, how does getting an avernic save you the 50-100 hours of ToB?
---
  
---
Just because an item doesn't save as much time in efficient play than it takes to get doesn't mean it's not worth getting when you can. If any item speeds up any other later content, it is worth considering. The only other variable is the difficulty and supplies used to get it at whatever earlier point you'd grind for it.
---
If someone wants to go for an ironman tbow eventually, there's no reason to grind for it after you've completed everything it's useful for, regardless of whether or not it's very useful for hyper efficient play.
---
Getting an avernic that early almost purely depends on whether or not you can have better geared players carry you. You're doing tob at that point with no claws, scythe, tbow, kodai, and plenty of other bis armor. If your entire group was as undergeared as you are going into ToB rushing for avernic, that's not going to be a good time.
---
Rage?  Yikes lol.  Ahh how will I deal with someone who opts out of a conversation since he can't handle it.  Opting out shows you're too sensitive.   How will I cope?üôÅ Remember this life lesson, "A Bitch online is a bitch in  person".  Seems you have the issues, with running away when things heat upüôÇ.   Now if you comment back i will show that  I hit a soft spot so the jokes on you.
---
It's hilarious how you're so snarky over this when you missed the completely obvious joke
---
Iron men accounts aren't for reaching raids or getting a high total skill level they're for the journey
---
FEcking idiot i think
---
Ah feel you man I still haven't killed Vorkath a single time after the quest, because it seems to be too hard for me. I have lost a lot of money to it :(
---
Use Runelite's chat filter
---
What is it?
---
They have 5 iq or are 13.
---
You don't NEED to be able to communicate as long as you can read instructions. But you might need to indicate ur muted in some way so they dont expect you to talk. Discord for voice chat will be your friend here though.
---
Fe is the chemistry short name for iron.
---
Good ass meme
---
Fe is iron on tbe periodic table
---
Oh duhh
---
You must  be one of those guys who go after the ugly bitchs that never gets touched.  Seeing as I only have it on my shitty ass laptop that I don't play anything on.   Get some new material man, then try again.   I give you credit though, you tried to be creative.  Have an upvote on me for that haha.
---
Lol we pk with dhides and ballista if we pk with styles we take xericians etc
---
Itll help for sure.
---
It actually exists, it's the Hobgoblin Penisula next to the Crafting guild.
---
Your magic defense is 70% based on magic level, 30% defense level so it helps a lot to restore up.
---
I just don't get why people struggle with vorkath, I can understand if people lack gear and or recommended levels to to sufficient damage to him but for the most part he is a simple boss with fairly simple mechanics.
---
How is it a bait?  What can i lure from a guy who pk with us? Fucking ballista??
---
Double death runes etc. via the abyss, revenants caves, african-american chins, wilderness bosses.
---
You can get rid of those bots in chat with Runelite.
---
it's more fun to do in f2p, mems can make their own bonds easily
---
Is the 100k fee to return items a permanent thing or just for DS2?
---
only for the clues introduced in the first clue scroll update, which the clues were suggested by the community
---
Another?  üòÇ.  Didn't bother reading that either.   But damnnn,  you really  are easy to let people get under your skin.  üòÇ. Maybe try growing thicker skin, after all it is  just Reddit.  Not like it matters  :D
---
Chill the fuck out, you instigated the fight, you wanted someone to bring it up by making the comment about, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait for people to bitch about avg!!‚Äù without anyone saying anything. You need to seriously chill and calm the fuck out, you‚Äôre genuinely creepy and eerie as hell. All of that over someones opinion of your anti-virus.
---
Well there was the guy who can‚Äôt use his arms or legs and got the infernal cape with his mouth
---
Not saying i could make it.
---
just interested to see your reaction...
---
it's okay. My mind was blown when I figured this out like a year ago

Congratz, idiot.

Maybe there are some who want to have sex with animals, but in my experience I haven't seen anyone like that. Most of them do have pedophilic tendancies though.
---
This is my go to spot for stuff like this and early levels, pretty much every kind of rock from iron - addy and I‚Äôve never seen a soul down there
---
puro puro without bots and ironmen was a really enjoyable experience, now its shit
---
Awesome, thanks. I think this is the optimal set up. I'm very close to all of it. 74 defense, 72 prayer. Planning on staying at 75 def so I need to finish up a few quests before I grind it out. Just need to build the bank a bit for Dinhs and Serp helm, which means enduring a little bit more of this less than optimal gear. I assume since no dragonfire shield or antifire shield you are bringing out anti dragonfire potion maybe?
---
Lmfao, you were calling me a bitch for not wanting to reply before and now I'm a bitch for making a reply? Can you at least be a tiny bit consistent with your rage and not completely contradictory one comment to the next?
---
It‚Äôs glhf you goon

üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Aggressive.  I didn't bother reading past the first four words.  That shit was pretty good. You got me, you got me üòÇ.   You must be a friend of one of those guys.  Can't fight their battles, so their in need of some Reddit help.

Maybe I am mixing it up with another piece then. But again, very nice üòé

"Have a nice day"  he said üòÇ.  Damn man your too much.üòÇ.  Boring ass graveyard shift  isn't as bad as I thought it would be tonight.   Oh and I didn't bother reading that.  Just seeing the motivation pop up was plenty enough to crack me up.   Fine job nerd, fine job.
---
Because you normally can‚Äôt. Using runelite let‚Äôs you zoom further out.
---
What's funnier about these scams is the OP writing 6 line replies of rage in response to criticism of his antivirus
---
Can we have a GWD Boss room with Ash

&gt; She can handle all of you at once.

How tf does vorkath sound like a female name to you?

What gear? All I see is alchables
---
Nice, I managed to luck it on dragon slayer 2 want to prove to myself I can do it but too chicken shit to risk shit haha
---
Upvote this into oblivion, the world must know
---
This alone is proof that all non-ironmen are entitled and should be permanently banned.
---
Oopsie! Thanks!
---
4man then i guess?
---
Like Elvarg
---
No, you block it cause it's a garbage task.
---
What tha fuck
---
Lol yeah it does, considered posting it to 4chan, no idea where to post it but reading it I reckon it could be a legit copypasta
---
Yeah Zulrah is much harder to learn. About 100KC and never died to vork. Zulrah on the other hand...
---
Probably because being F2P has more weight in bot detection that not. You might have been on the edge of being considered a bot and your membership running out put you on the otherside of the line.
---
This whole thread of conspiracy is actually laughable. Jagex doesn't make more money once you activate a bot, and it's not a flip of a switch to make working bot detection. It's insanely difficult and it's hard to convey to a community if they have little to no programing experience.
---
No, that's the crab nebula
---
You can do tob with around 100m in gear. Talking is pretty useful for calling roles. Raids 1 is easier, 2 is more rewarding. I sorta doubt when you say ‚ÄúI am decent at the game‚Äù but I‚Äôd recommend maxing combat before trying to get deep into pvm. Or just make a new account so you aren‚Äôt muted and max combat on there
---
True, the lurers who don't extend their false friendship for days, weeks, months are desperate amateurs.
---
My friend fell victim to one of them, well, TWICE.
---
First time: A typical lurer befriended and groomed him then promised that he'd make easily 100m+ anti-luring, which didn't end well for his bank. 
---
Second time: A guy we knew in our CC who claimed he was a "reformed" scammer and even had admin roles in our CC and Discord (over the months of getting to know him,) decided to lead my friend on for 6 months before he slowly gained enough trust through small lends/borrows, even 800m in gear from another CC member at one point, which he surprisingly gave back, and then he started borrowing my friend's **Tbow** for Hydra. 
---
Few days later, he claimed he got hacked, didn't show any proof or screenshots of his bank, invent, etc. Didn't show any remorse or sorrow and when we questioned him, he left the discord and CC to start his own up and took a few of our members with him, then not long after he bragged about how easy it was to scam a Tbow by "befriending someone dumb for 6 months."
---
So yeah, I fully agree, never lend anybody your expensive shit unless you really really know them, but even still, I would never lend anybody a Tbow.
---
None of that makes a huge difference
---
Thanks, great guide :) I saw in the comments it got one or two criticisms, but I thought it was a good guide with a clear and concise explanation, with no waffle, that‚Äôs what I love about a guide
---
One thing though, you didn‚Äôt mention how you banked did you? 
---
Also, what runelite plug in highlights your switches different colours? 
---
Thanks :)
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre a troll, 12 years old, or socially challenged
---
awww yisss

I'm pretty sure like 3/4 of the accounts at puro puro aren't bots, they're gold farmers.

If you get banned on that account you no longer can utilize the bond. They have to repurchase a bond on a newly unbanned account.
---
If I cared enough to buy a bond, I'd bet you for a bond that I can make a bot in f2p and banned in a day, while if I do exact same blatant botting after purchasing a bond, it will survive much longer.
---
I was thinking the guy rocking the slayer helmet + salve ei combo lol
---
will cut Jagex' profits too much I guess

OP deleted his account after writing a ton of insults because his choice of antivirus was criticized, here's a glimpse of it, makes for a great copypasta:

As for the other guy, that wasn't advice he was giving. Everything here is from someone's opinion. He surely didn't find it hostile. Even replied to me about my username. Don't say you were not talking about him because there wasn't many comments that could come close to giving me "advice". So you call those insults? Yikes... If that's what you call an insult then you seem a bit too sensitive for Reddit. As for the editing you literally just came on his post lmao. Acting like you've been in this discussion the whole time or something. You have no clue what was here before so don't act like you're doing something noble on a post that won't matter to anyone in a day or soüòÇ. Feelings Hurt? Not in the slightest. I just enjoy toying (and getting a good laugh) with those type of people on Reddit. Oh yeah? üòÇ First off that gave me a great laugh üòÇ. You aren't that bright since you don't know the actual domain ("rs.ru") when it is literally right in front of you on my post. Secondly, coming on here commenting to me like that makes me think you have been hacked via something similar. Did what i say hit a little soft spot and remind you of a time when you were phished for your precious d scim and full rune? We can talk about it if you like?üòÇ Damn didn't expect soo many people to get offended by my opinion about AVGüòÇ. Dare I mention browsers next or will that seriously piss people off? Lmao.

Sorry your stuck with Norton / Mcafee on your Walmart PC.Edit: Some people love their norton and mcafee judging by the hate this comment is getting üòÇ. I love itüòÅüòÇ So easy to mess with people on reddit over something as silly as Anti-virus brands. Hmmm dare i discuss browsers next? üòÇ

Few hundred K with 100 bots is already 10 mil an hour passively. Also you have no sources for fake credit cards used? I know it was a problem back in the day but I don't recall the exact details.

2006 was a different era. If you looted runes for teleports off some1, they'd get flamed and called a tele tubby. It was a different time.

&gt;the only thing that really costs more is property, i rent a 2 bedroom apartment for 1800 a month,

you cheeky fox.

You reckon I should put time into learning zulrah at this stage instead of the many hours it would take to get 85 range+

Much easier with bp but it's not that hard without it. I suggest using a spawn predictor (a tool that tells where everything spawns). Makes it easier to mitigate damage on a pure. Just google "Fight Caves Spawn Predictor"

We vikings are famous for prankster names on our islands. Such as naming Iceland and Greenland accordingly
---
Companies are always worried about "oh but what if they figure out that they got banned for botting!", but if they really cared, those 70k bots would be banned before they left tutorial island.

Yep. The best antivirus changes every 5 years or so.

It was avg last year, avast before that, and Norton before that, McAfee before that...

This comment is hilarious wtf why is it downvoted

My vote is the crasher

i believe you

bro code homie blur out the fuckin name
---
For most things it doesnt stack up to dhcb, the "new" factor is wearing off now that its found its niche for raids/rune dragon alts/ etc, and it could also just be a merch clan.

A bit back bps went from like 5m to almost 10 back to 5ish in about a month.

Yea but it can be used for both really, don't see why you have to restrict it to a single use scenario

A load of bots already get banned before they leave tutorial island according to some old q&amp;a with mod mat k

If only runelite had a plug-in for this exact problem.

People think their account is secure with 2fa and bank pin. But they leave their email totally unsecured. Then cry. The game tells you many times to put 2FA on your email.

Not everyone does, it gives defence exp and pures try to avoid it so they don't get that extra training from nudolion.
---
Sex is xp waste.
---
Totally agree. People are never going to learn if Jagex are always made to look like the ones at fault. That's not to say that account security couldn't be improved.
---
You don‚Äôt need to run the entirety of the fight. You can just turn it off.
---
Yews are not good at all, what are your combat stats like??
---
Think about it. Literally no one would do it because the optimal way to get MoG would be killing people.
---
Because somehow after 18 years and two attempts at running the game, Jagex still hasn‚Äôt figured out how to balance a combat triangle. Melee was overpowered in RS2 which led to EoC and RS3. Now it‚Äôs ranged. I wonder how they‚Äôre gonna tackle this one. The Chinese overlords will probably force/rig EoC through a poll.
---
You are doing fine my dude keep it up!
---
this gives me flashbacks
---
Have to try that out hadn't thought about lunar tele.
---
&gt; People are never going to learn if Jagex are always made to look like the ones at fault 
---
But they are at fault. I could remove 2fa on my email account and make the password public and people still wouldn't be able to access my steam, battlenet etc. accounts because I have 2fa on those. But people could still access my osrs account despite the 2fa on it so obviously Jagex is doing something wrong here.
---
I've gotten killed with a full inventory of cake at wildy agility. Guess what was waiting for me on the ground when I returned to my spot?
---
You think so? I always found that the colors sort of bleed with the frontlit screen of the 001, but are more even with the backlit. With the light on, at least. The nice thing about the 001 was that you could turn off the light all together.

Yes the Shield of Arrav cc. It's called OSRS soa, just go in there and say which side you're looking for. At most you'll have to wait 5 minutes, but usually it doesn't take long.

Unless his reddit post history is full of personal details that'll help recover the account + he decides to keep his bank in his inventory when he logs out or goes on vacation long enough for his PIN to be removed, posting your IGN on reddit really doesn't make a difference. It's not exactly difficult to find accounts that have a ton of wealth.
---
Is there a "quest tree" somewhere? An image/site where you can visually see what quests are requirements for other quests, like the technology trees in some games.
---
Playing the game and expecting it to not have bots that go unbanned for months is me being part of the problem?
---
Not saying this is the fastest method, but I get around 20 kc an hour using this method. 
---
The fremmy boots are for the telly back to vorkath; since I have to recharge my BGS spec I'm already in my house anyway, so after a succesfull kill I just telly using a mounted glory after drinking from my pool. Then you can bank in edge, and teleport back with your fremmy boots.
---
Are people seriously defending the ironman here? Fucking lol

If you press tab multiple tiles you cycle through People you have been messaging since log in.

Maxed melee is mostly better. Elite Void can be used in tob while your still learning, or at Corp if your not in karils. But maxed melee is better dps
---
the one guy in the image with good gear should get fastpass
---
More expensive
---
its worth it for nmz training but might not be that good for mid- high level slayer because of the low def.
---
i already have the budget setup (neitz helm, torso, dlegs) but I still ended up getting the full obsidian set with zerker necklace to train in nmz.
---
This kid looks like the pizza guy that Michael traps in the conference room in the Office lol
---
Probably a result of the change. Still only ~2-4k gp/hr for the decent xp rates.

This is worth more than 5 cabbages. Impressive.

Jagex can't ban accessibility options like sticky keys, and if shift configuration was banned runelite wouldn't have it by default.
---

---
Thanks for the links, but i know of that already. It's just that i was wondering if there was something big where you could visually track how "high up" you already are in quest series and stuff. But seeing how many quests are prerequisites for other quests I think it'll become a mess. Thanks anyway!

Use boat to travel (teleport) similarly to the existing charter ships.
---
Even better if it incorporated fishing and combat, a good soundtrack, and maybe some mini-games and sailor swag.

If I was to guess probably did 2*phi of (0-(1/23))/(sqrt(1/23(1-1/23)/25).

Jagex is probably just racist

that's why these guys don't ever get muted.

You can filter just teleports

None are corect???

Cannon goblins near lumbridge and I got in (lucky) in about 10 minutes. My hardest ones so far are completing a COX run, 85 farming, and getting a mimic.

I like how one of them is insanely hot, and the other is ugly af. But hey atleast that ugly dude has a nice watch.

This is all Jim Carrey's fault

This subreddit is incredibly racist, nothing new
---
Why'd I get downvoted? Do I seriously have to put /s for people to realize it's a joke?
---
(doesn't consider the possibility that it just wasn't funny)
---
I‚Äôm offended for saying my opinion? Lmao good one Amber.
---
You can use anti-fire potions for dragon stone bolts and even if you use other bolts the chance of getting a spec is 6% to be able to hit into the 50s-60s whereas the elder maul can do it every time and hit higher than that still
---
Just remembered this page https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quests/Series
---
Maybe something like that?
---
More the assumption that happens to reinforce the shit life they have somewhere else. Weird. Flex

pretty much halves the kill time for ~20seconds of walking if ur quick. This is objectively measurable and you are wrong. Only with DHCB does that method become more KPH
---
It‚Äôs the internet. If you get offeneded by words on a screen maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be on it.
---
Go do Wintertodt.
---
For sure. There‚Äôs some pretty useful Easy/Mediums which generally require 40-50 in slills
---
If we're talking about the unofficial use of the word grinding, in the scope of mmo's, (news flash this is the runescape reddit), then grinding does not necessarily mean bad, just repetitive, sometimes it can be a fun grind, others it can be a bad grind, but the use of the word **in this context** generally means repetitive.
---
Really bro
---
As an Ironman I agree with him wholeheartedly
---
Only Chinese replica around here is RS3
---
When did I say racism is acceptable? All I‚Äôm saying is it‚Äôs the internet and if you get offended by what people say on it you‚Äôre not going to have a fun time.
---
Okay, thanks
---
75 range so I can attempt fight caves. Need to finish RFD, and then get my combat up to afk at NMZ. Gotta get my mid level grind on
---
Zulrah is prob the hardest boss to learn before raids.
---
Yeah I find it aesthetically very pleasing, and the rewards are great. Even doing 1 contract a day is a nice passive gp boost
---
What's the bug?
---
Somebody needs to live to spread the tale.
---
What?
---
Maybe something like this?
---
Problem with runescape quests is that even in series a quest will sometimes require completion of another quest that's only vaguely related. A single page showcasing prereqs for each quest would get very messy
---
Dude you can see the ign of every Joe schmoe with a t bow at the ge and they don't get hacked
---
How much rent are SJWs paying to preoccupy your mind like that
---
and this is surprising because ...? It's obvious Jagex would strive for 0 false positives and minimal false negatives than other way around when it comes to banning paying players
---
True, pures are always an exception to a lot of things lol
---
&gt;Why would you do bandos before inferno? As for raids void is almost as good, and the items you get from those speed up bandos a significant amount.
---
Because bandos is bis melee gear for CoX? Tassets are a huge upgrade just in terms of how much tankier they make you.
---
Void really isn't great for solos
---
Ok people really need to chill with the RC hate. I got 99 RC a couple days ago and that shit is super afk. Once you hit 77 it's so easy to afk and the profit you make is also really good. Hell even doing the abyss to 77 was a bit afk imo once you get the hand of it. 
---
Also in terms of engagement. Skills like thieving, fishing, even smithing are basically the same level of engagement. 
---
People need to understand that once you hit 77, it's smooth sailing. And getting to 77 through the abyss, while hard to some, makes you a lot of money while almost every other skill comes no where close.
---
Ping really only matters if you're doing tick perfect activities. Beyond that, picking a server from your country will suffice in pretty much all other cases.

---
You die for different reasons on the bosses. 
---
Once you learn zulrah well you really only die if you get greedy and dont eat when youre below 42hp and get one shot by blue phase ranged bolt. Theres lots of leeway for mistakes that wont get your horribly killed if youre near max hp. Once in a blue moon 2 snakelings will max hit you for 11 each and zulrah will hit for 40, but thats only 62 damage super rarely
---
Vorkath can fuck you up for certain mistakes and i usually die every so often to him because i messed up my woox walk and got killed in 3 ticks by poison phase or i misclick and get hit by his dodgeable fireball.

You‚Äôre not accounting for the fact that the strength bonus lost on those four slots can get made up by the Void invisible boost of +10% to damage and accuracy.
---
The problem with it being afk after 77, is the 77 part. That is a lot of grinding with not great xp rates

Trying to not look like such a NMZ prod haha. Need around 15 more qp for barrows gloves and working on slayer + other random skilling stats for stuff like DS2 and MM2. Feels bad being 122cb but only 1680 total.

Hey, I still use Legacy mode in RS3. I always find it a fun challenge to kill the newer bosses using only Legacy Mode. It's like old school but with modern graphics.

Just a heads up this subreddit automatically removes most links, such as patreon.
---
Or make it common practice to bank everything when you log for the day
---
Looks like the Runelite player indicator plugin.
---
Try to think about what you said you stupid fuck
---
That isn't entirely true. Every level improves your gathering of logs, like how every Strength level improves your damage even if it doesn't unlock a new item. Also, it is unreasonable to expect Gathering skills, or Combat skills, to have a bunch of unlocks like Artisan skills and Support skills.
---
Sir amic vase

Whenever I see a post like this I like to pretend to myself that it's possible this happens to me when I go kill a boss I've never killed for the first time. Sadly at this point though I'm running out of them.

Skills were very useful before PvM started flooding the resources market. Once that started, skilling for resources became less common.

That ain't a staker. That's a scammer.

Just solved BA here. Nice post man. If someone dc‚Äôs and logs in you‚Äôll still be in the room, add a dc/log out timer so people dont just log out for 30m. Make the timer 2-3 minutes and well if you can‚Äôt reconnect in 3 minutes that‚Äôs tough luck to your internet. Blame your provider for losing all those points. Teams of 5 can end games as a majority vote if they hate each other, all this plus everything you said would really fix up BA. It‚Äôs such a fun mini game as well.

Same goes for pvm and obtaining items through botting

I know the wilderness has its purpose and you accept the risks once you enter, but that certainly doesn‚Äôt mean that I was ‚Äúoutsmarted‚Äù. I‚Äôm not going to bring 100k risk with me just to complete a wilderness clue step. It would seem IDIOTIC to do so when I can simply risk a spade.

You can, i just use msb and bronze arrows so i don't waste scales. Are you maximizing your magic defence? Any slot that doesn't give damage bonus(occult neck, imbued god cape, slay helm, tormented brace) should be the highest mage defence you can get. I wear karils and a dhide shield there

Idk, I had the most fun I can remember in RS with dungeoneering and summoning, as did a lot of people I used to play with. TDS, Nex, etc., all that stuff was really fun back then.

Maybe just items that you get warned before dropping, like 30k and above.

Man I love that cave. I once went through it again after having completed the quest long ago. It's a lot of fun.
---
Only when your agility is very low is the cave annoying af cause you'll fall a lot at the end where the cages are with those trapped things in them. But other than that, top notch content.
---
Now that I think about it, they should make that entire cave function as an agility course when the quest is finished.
---
they gave us abilities instead of click and wait based combat
---
and it was literally never asked for by the community and on top of that was poorly implemented and they had to do patches for several months to get it into a decent state
---
that being said theyve made it work out but it did significantly damage the community. i mean just scroll through this thread and you can see the massive grudge these people still hold because it gave such a bad first impression
---
Only issue there is you can change that value in options so scammer boi could just set it to like 10M. Maybe pin to change options...?
---
just stake it
---
Because you won‚Äôt be hired if you don‚Äôt sign it lol. Also they probably only legally pursue large losses or cases that would bring bad PR. And if their smart they could hide their tracks or set up a fake farm that seems like they were farming much less gold then the really where as to avoid all legal issues. Just saying it‚Äôs plausible and likely has happened.
---
Damn this is impressive!!
---
That's not griefing, that's competition. If they followed you to the next world that'd be griefing. And what you're doing "make sure they suffer" is the same exact "griefing". Either way, just hop? Or deal with it? NMZ is instanced afking with free potions. Plus like, yknow there are countless monsters to kill other than sand crabs, you're just lazy and entitled so you should have to pay a premium for that.
---
Here‚Äôs some stuff that helped me in the beginning. Walk, don‚Äôt run! That will help with the acid spit phase. Ctrl+click (while set to walking) to run from firebombs. Filter out all spells but combat spells for easy access to your crumble undead spell. Click yourself to stop shooting vorkath at the start of the crumble undead phase. Eat during the acid phase, or at the start/end of the crumble undead phase (you‚Äôll significantly increase your dps).
---
So going to a PvP area unprepared is not being dumb?
---
How much more could possibly be added to Woodcutting though?  And rebalancing/refreshing any skills to add more throughout the levels would just have people up in arms about ‚ÄúOSRS IS BECOMING RS3!!1!11‚Äù

Killing someone when you're trying to kill people and they aren't isn't outsmarting anyone.  Pkers that actually feel proud about killing bambis are probably the ones on reddit projecting their insecurities on others "nyehhhh you're just mad you died nyeehhhhhh"

Mobilefag? Listen bud, I was part of the vote that made OSRS a thing. Don't act like your superior just because you played the game before someone because 1: you're wrong in this case, and 2: that's such a dumb argument
---
I don't think so. My prayer has been stuck at 0 zero since I did dragon slayer. I've gained 3 levels since then, but 3 points isn't really that much. Kind of a useless skill with it being such an important resource.

The commitment...

can you say why?

It's not nessesarily required but your gonna have a bad time without it

---
that was not at all the point of the video. You dont NEED to do anything outside of basic combat for most bossing. People discover ways to increase dps and be more efficient such as woox walking at vorkath but they are advanced tactics that only some people will use. If you want to maximaize your gp/hr and dps feel free to use them, but by no means are they required to be able to boss

yeah fair enough, but it could at least have been included in the blog

They could expand on the canoes. There's lots of rivers, like Elid, the one near Ardougne, small one in the Fremennik province, Salve river, the one on Karamja. A lot of these could provide useful shortcuts.

I never gave an opinion on it, and I'm not going to because it's beside the point I'm making.

Reddit admins official stance was that it was a racist sub name.
---
My point is that all of porn subs (besides the last one, r/race play, which I left out of my comment) had nothing to do with the discussion at hand, and there's nothing wrong with them.
---
And never, ever on pvm/skilling polls
---
Competition/crashing has always been a part of the game. It‚Äôs only gridding if you specifically hop worlds to follow the losing player i.e. you, if it bothers you more than him you‚Äôre more likely to hop and he keeps the world. Now if he hops to follow you THAT is griefing. You‚Äôre just being retarded in all honesty and everyone else here ‚Äúflaming‚Äù you isn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúflaming‚Äù you just like how the guy at sand crabs isn‚Äôt actually griefing you.
---
By the way what kind of pleb are you that you‚Äôre training on sand crabs lmfao. Either train at NMZ to imbue rings or train Slayer to double-down on XP. You‚Äôre an inefficient piece of shit and you have the attitude to go with it too by acting like you matter more than whoever else is stupid enough to train at sand crabs. 
---
You got crashed and got triggered. Fucking deal with it buddy. PvM long enough and you become numb to it. Crashing is a part of the game and it sucks but it‚Äôs not against the rules as much as you‚Äôd love to bitch and whine until it is.

i don't think that's a great thing to argue for. just because (past years) balancing team was incompetent and failed to address the issue doesn't mean the issue shouldn't be addressed when they get their shit together.
---
Yeah contracts are a bit op for irons going for post 99 herb, for example. However, even with the nerf to contracts theyre still going to make herb (and farm)  far, far easier. I don't think the hard part about the skill has ever been you being gated by supplies?
---
&gt;a similar thing happened to ironmen also where you stopped being able to boost in CoX to enchant via overloads, all this does is make people go into more effort
---
they made it impossible to do enchants in NMZ a while ago, they just missed this.

The more I read through this thread the more I‚Äôm convinced that OP is actually retarded and I‚Äôm not joking, I say that in the most medical definitive meaning possible. He has issues and he shows all the signs.

On my main finish getting maxed combat stats (121 CB currently).

On my baby pure get 70 str/range and finish off RFD for mith gloves and learn how to pk on it (my first pure).

New spot for power training 99wc

No, that‚Äôs just RuneScape bud. When you play one of the world‚Äôs most popular MMO‚Äôs with limited servers and limited space at various resource and training spots, you can expect to get crashed, at that point it‚Äôs a mind game of who gets triggered into hopping first. Clearly OP lost, he hopped and decided to come roid rage on reddit hoping we‚Äôd all agree with him when none of us do. Any of us real seasoned players know that‚Äôs a part of the game, ESPECIALLY us PvMers pre-server increase. Before we had worlds well into the 400s and 500s, it was almost impossible to get a Bandos, Corp, or DKs room without having to crash somebody, and if you were lucky enough to find an open world, you‚Äôd be equally as unlucky and get crashed within ten minutes. With how many servers we have now I have no problem finding space at any spot I go to on RS so OP should‚Äôve just cut his losses and found a new world. No reason to roid rage over pixels.

this is def not banter and you not knowing the difference paints you in a very bad light and I worry for anyone that has any sort of a daily encounter with you.
---
No... I can't... the puzzle... the shadows.... it's too much
---
Hybridding usually refers to just mage/melee without range or overheads, where tribridding and NHing are basically the same thing now
---
This happened to me a few weeks ago. I didn't have access to my email on my account because I got a new phone. I dont think I had the same website problems as you, but what I did to fix it was put in a request to change my email on the account. Denied on my first request, but I put in another request with more details of my problem in the comment section. Successful on the second attempt. Didn't lose my 335 hours of progress. I believe you go through the account recover/forgot password options to get to the email change request. Do not be demoralized, it is a fixable problem!
---
i understand and agree to an extent, but next thing they're going to do is ban trading in all altars after people are now running lava runes, there shouldn't be a system where the vocal minority can attain maximum rates and then complain until they're nerfed.
---
jagex consistently change their philosophy in the way they manage and maintain, for example, CoX and overloads, yes i agree it should have been nerfed but they knew about it way way way before they done anything so people were rushing to perform this pre-nerf - all this does then is punish those after which. 
---
all i ask for is to at least poll the nerf.
---
Ty for the loot
---
This is fucking funny
---
I will never accept RWT as an excuse for punishing legitimate players. That's how we got free trade restriction and Wilderness PvP removal in 2007.
---
went there ealier today and got insta pked not even 5 mins in and a single rev kill to my name, its sad really
---
Not bad. So how old the acc is what I really meant
---
Right, I meant to say my first gen SP died and I got the 2nd gen one with the brighter screen. Thankfully the battery in my Ruby Cartridge is miraculously still good.
---
&gt; but next thing they're going to do is ban trading in all altars after people are now running lava runes,
---
Why do you think this? nothing they said for justifying zmi nerfs would make sense in terms of astral and lava nerfs.
---
&gt;all i ask for is to at least poll the nerf.
---
they dont poll balance changes because people who abuse them vote against them despite a nerf being good for the game overall.
---
I finished dragon slayer 2 like a week and a half ago. Almost 200 vorkath kills. 0 zulrah
---
Moi world? I think I saw u in there a few times
---
Just finished all of my imbues (finally did Lunar and Dream Mentor), now I'm gonna work on 75 range and then grind out the fight caves.
---
Get higher strength and out dps them, duh
---
Tbf this is like a region locked ironman asking jagex to add stuff to the region to make it easier
---
The Dream!
---
I know it takes longer for iron men to grind for particular items and levels, but I don't think that means a player plays more with an iron man compared to a regular account.  And even so, I think that whole time thing is beside the point.  My point is that having a particular account doesn't have any correlation with the type of personality you have when interacting with others.
---
People are lazy and don't want to do quests
---
Insane tab! Honestly don't know how people can keep themselves from selling a huge tab like that. And btw I remember your name from [letting me live here!](https://i.imgur.com/0hR9PCJ.png)
---
want to link me some proof?
---
See you in a few months
---
And 9th attempt overall. Hard to believe
---
Oh no
---
Make sure your zoom as all the way out so you can click the cave and the bank chest. You do have to build the bank chest if you haven't yet. Its much easier to afk then anything else I've come across in osrs.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaat? Like on private chat?
---
I have been wishing there was a way to do that forever. I just thought the RS engine was too old-school for that...
---
Gotcha thank you

How many hours did you spend on this tab so far?

Welp this is embarrassing but apparently the patch just has the weed-y animation when you look at the patch from the Mountain Camp next door. My Snapdragons were there :/

Yeah the difference is it's way more effective

Can I have an example of those? Being completely serious. And since when is trolling so bad?

I also did

Doesn't remind me but upvoted for the reference

You should be using anglers when you need to heal above 99, like brewing up.

Do you have to split this tab among your pking friends or is this already your split?

And if trolling is all it was, that wouldn't be so bad. It's the doxxing, brigading into other subs, spreading hate speech, and other rules they break consistently.

Make sure you have a different password for your email and runescape login.

You can get away with normal void if you're really wanting to kill Vork, you'll just use more prayer since elite void has a +6 total prayer bonus over normal void. Elite void is 12.5% more damage and accuracy with the range helm, where normal range void is 10% more damage/accuracy. So a 2.5% increase in damage/accuracy and more prayer bonus basically.
---
Hot post.

Benjo you‚Äôre my hero!

High quality.  Ty for this.  Honestly still don‚Äôt like warding though

Actually,  i got banned again hence the meme

I think this is more for hacking than accidental scam trading

They're permanent unlocks and you could always just farm more gold, so go for it

Blow pipe and swap at least 10 brews for restores
---
I respectfully disagree:
---
First, I don't know what EoC was like initially, but I generally hear it's in a way better state nowadays, and I find it pretty decent myself. With that said though:
---
&gt; It's too easy to win
---
I wouldn't call it directly too easy, but I'm not sure what this means exactly. The skill grind is still there, and quest chains still exist and give rewards. What about RS/EoC is easier to win than it is in OSRS?
---
&gt;  the game is not chill anymore
---
I find skilling way more chill on RS than OSRS. As for combat, there is Revolution mode which can fire off skills automatically; works great on mobile and if I'm just doing some slayer task or something. Then there's also Legacy mode as well for things outside of high-level PvM.
---
Within reason, EoC gives me the choice of active or afk combat basically, instead of the afk-only option with OSRS.
---
With the recent talks about prayer flicking, some people brought up that they do it to make combat in OSRS more interesting and active, along with it being a skillful activity. EoC to me hits all 3 points, and I think some people would be pleasantly surprised if they gave it a chance today.
---
How do you share? Killer keeps the loot?
---
Very nice, I was bored of red chins so I'm doing herbiboar for 99 hunt and I got pretty at 260kc, guy on the same world is 4k kc dry feel bad for him.
---
What's your opinion on them like say nerfing the blowpipe after all this time. It's an understandable approach to just side with jagex and bite the bullet knowings it's nerfed for all.
---
&gt;lol
---
-also me
---
I appreciate you demanding proof and then sticking your head in the sand and declaring "no proof" once I provided it. Have a nice day.
---
Oh my, thank you. This will make dodging those one-shot meteors way easier.
---
That's where I got it yeah, but I think it's just mining in general, I honestly dont know
---
Those times are missed dearly.....
---
Mage and yew logs have not had their prices change significantly since the start of old school - how has pvm devalued woodcutting?
---
yo, chill out, it was just banter.

I'd like more things like PP for thieving

Thanks for the tips! I'll probably do a lot of that then!
---
Slayer bad
---
Warding bad
---
My goal is to get all necessary skills up for Song of the Elves when it comes out.
---
Problem is getting to 77 in the first place takes like 80 hours
---
Woah people don't like the truth do they? It's obvious from all these videos people are uploading, a HUGE part of the playerbase are bots. Not active players, just realize it for fucks sake, if you don't realize that you're part of the problem.
---
Later virgins
---
You can save a lot of stress by just grinding agility to 60 or 70, makes it a lot easier with summer pies. You'll benefit in the long run anyways with the faster run regen
---
(H)
---
and I just want a twisted bow
---
Interesting, I think we just have different definition of noob
---
I'm sorry that happened. In the future, you can look them up on RS3 website highscores and if they have a red badge/trophy thing by their name and are still telling you they need money to get back into members, you can know for sure they're trying to rip you off because the red badge means membership. This isn't 100% reliable since they might not have RS3 highscores but it's a way to possibly check. But yeah it's sad people abuse trust/kindness, especially over 3-4M.
---
haha get it because mining crafting
---
Nexus is same amount of clicks as a jewel box....?
---
Well, they're really racist against any brown people, but that's not really a race either
---
I think bp has had existing content balanced around it, its in line with other end game dps weapons like tbow scythe black chins dhcb. Really its just crossbows aside from dhcb that are really bad. 
---
I think a bp nerf would work (like a real nerf to bps dps) if they went and rebalanced theatre, cox(solo) and inferno. But i do not see them doing that.
---
Cool, Ty as always.
---
Team effort, everyone keeps their own small loot. Depending on how many people are pking and say it's claws it might be split.
---
Tber usually would get a split.
---
Welp, that's what you get for not having 2FA and falling for a double-xp scam üò¥
---
oh
---
I think your best chance of finding that is an Ironman guide
---
But when not having run on, don't you need to react rather quick to the fireball to walk 2 sqm away? In my experience (just a few KC) having run on is easier so I can dodge the fire without any stress, then when I see the poison I manually turn off run as soon as I find an open "spot" to walk around on.
---
Need Kebab?
---
Looks like the head and the face were made separately and then the face was put on like a mask but they got the skin tone wrong. Have no idea how they make these but it just looks like a smooth head wearing a face mask. Gives me the willys.

what build if i wanna use neitznot helm?? that was my go to but i realised neitznot is 55 def n i kinda wanted that for stylescape haha

Hans age can be older than OSRS. If you mean played time I'd guess somewhere around 100 days.

Try to Yahoo it or look it up on Bing.

So what would you fill in these levels with? Woodcutting has always been just that, gathering logs. You have teaks or mushrooms at fossil island for XP, or redwoods for an extremely laid back but still decent XP option. I'm not sure what you can really add to this skill to make it "exciting" when the entire basis of the skill is simple and straightforward: cut wood and collect or drop it.

In that case it must be stolen from OSRS

99 firemaking at wintertodt (94 atm) and then going to do start getting requirements for monkey madness 2!
---
I personally don‚Äôt care but think if they were removed fire cape should stay
---
Why even have a mask on your agility suit that ups your run regen? It seem to me like negatively impacting your ease of breathing would impair stamina regeneration.
---
What would be a decent farming level to stop at for someone who hates the skill?
---
I still have another 5 or so slayer levels left before 95 so I'll get my combat up before raids anyhow. I might stop at 93 slayer. Not sure yet.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why though, like, there isn‚Äôt any reason to remove any of this stuff, especially considering some of it‚Äôs still in use, it‚Äôd be like removing all pickaxes except bronze rune and infernal, just because some don‚Äôt get quite as much use doesn‚Äôt mean you should just get rid of them.

Slayer task isn't even always viable as you could have substituted other kills in that timeframe, e.g. every time I get a black demon task I use it to dump any dark totems.
---
I've filtered bones/ashes from my drops but it's pretty reasonable to keep those in to track exact kc, although it's only really notable if you're killing things in multi that will die simultaneously

First make a baby pure cmb 60/70-ish.
---
Learn how to pk on that, kill green dragon bots, other pures and pvmers. Once you got a bit better, get your pure to late 70s cmb or early 80s and once you get bored make it a zerker and max it.
---
Being a pure is really fun and cheap way to pk, I‚Äôd recommend tribridding. Edge pking is boring imo and too many prods, 99 strenght, 99 range at cmb 58 for example..
---
While as a baby pure tribrid, you can have lots of fun and you‚Äôll fight different kind of people too.

Could you elaborate?

Imo, graceful should be the standard adventurer uniform... i wouldn't mind in the future if it got things like defence bonus (on par with mithril or addy). Also useful things like ice gloves, some slayer items, among others could be integrated into it to make it better. My point being is that i think it should be an all arounder gear for any activity which improve as you progress through the game.... that be said... This game is toxic as fuck, need that surgical mask to keep to fumes out.

Too much effort to click a single tile in the middle of all that shit. It should autopath you

Woox walking is specifically talking about the tactic on vork's acid phase. Obviously everyone knows you can walk and attack at the same time.
