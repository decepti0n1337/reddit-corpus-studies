Why are you so defensive towards similar posts of your half-assed memes, do you not have much else going on? I'm genuinely curious because you've shit on several posts that share an idea, and I find your toxic attitude a little off-putting.

Welcome man! Quests are your best bet, all the best P2P content gets unlocked with questing. Priest in Peril, ghosts ahoy, grand tree, tree gnome stronghold... all good places to start! Also, slayer; great way to start earning money!
---
Because gear doesn't matter as much in WoW arena compared to OSRS where RNG can make or break the difference in gear entirely. I was 2.3k in WoW PvP so I believe I can speak for both games in this matter, even if only opinionated.

the brew drop was never supposed to make it to the live game and only 1 person got it before it was removed.

it was a mistake, but they never actually thought it was a good idea...

as a bit of constructive criticism I recommend less editing and make the video as short as humanely possible so you get straight to the point. Otherwise good video :)

What a shit reward though Jesus

What I'm saying is, even if you maxed 99 strength and 75 attack you could get 99 range and you would be melee based. If you got 75/76/1 you would be melee based with 99 range regardless. 
---
Oh rip my b
---
He gonna get that 99 fishing!!
---
A 50ft long cable is not likely to be causing issues, unless your cable were damaged. There might be an increase in latency compared to a much shorter cable, but the increase would be so negligible that it shouldn't really affect anything (the cable would have to be *much* longer than that for it to begin mattering.)
---
Bending or pulling can damage a cable internally, so if you're coiling the cable around something so it takes up less space, that's worth keeping in mind so you don't pull it too tight (due to your cable being so long compared to the distance at which your router is.)
---
Also worth considering is that, if the cable isn't properly up to spec and weren't properly insulated for example, I guess it's possible that a long cable coiled up on itself could be causing noise and interference with itself. But something like this should not be a problem with a proper cable.
---
(Still, it's not necessarily your cable, there are many things that could cause this kind of problem.)
---
Yay

I mean it’s not terrible! But if I were u I wouldn’t worry about losing or gaining money rn and just use the bp. You’ll level faster and get to profitable tasks faster. It’s like going for 99 smith with cannonballs to profit, taking 200 hours. Or lose money making gold bars to 99, but taking 50 hours. In that extra 150 hours you can make 10x that of the cannonball profit.

---
No, but these is phishing.
---
Yeah definitely. I spend most of my time skilling, but running around Hosidius and the castle full of Royal Guards was one of the first times I've genuinely enjoyed running around looking at stuff in game since like 2011. I enjoyed Ape Atoll to an extent, but it was also the first time I've died on my osrs account because I forgot to turn on protect from melee, and panicked. That, and not being able to go down the trapdoor, was infuriating as all hell. 
---
I'm still not sure how someone finds the willpower to level a skill to 99. My highest skill is 72 mining, and I think that's like 7% of the way to a 99. Then do that 23 times? oof. I'll pass my osrs account down to my kids and their kids after them, one day we'll have a max account.
---
The irony of posting this on social media.

I mean I don’t want a bunch of dumb pets to start coming into the game. And we also don’t need to add a pet to everything. They should be cool/rareasfuq/from difficult bosses or skills. Adding more pets for the sake of adding more pets takes away a pets value. May be dumb reasoning but it’s just my opinion.

They're all different departments. CS would not be involved with DMM at all (I'd hope). The people "fixing" DMM would be the devs and probably some engine folks on hand for any crazy emergencies.

Do you kill baby blues or vorkath for blue dragon task? That answers your question. It's a matter of choice. That's what makes slayer the favourite skill for many people :)
---
I'd dig some kind of archeology skill and I think it fits well with the theme. 
---
I'd remove firemaking. I dig the cape but every other skill has a real purpose.
---
I really love this and want it more than anything right now. Zaros is best god.

---
Yeah true, but it'd be hard for them to cooperate and get an early advantage when they all start in different places. It'd still totally happen tho :c
---
you're right, 18 years of playing runescape with 0 accounts getting hacked means im doing something wrong and ignorant of the situation.  Sorry but blaming jagex for your own lack of securing your account is not their problem, and solely based on the user.  
---
Applying opportunity cost to RS lets you make an informed choice on how you play the game, and is different from optimizing the entire game to get peak results (like grinding vorkath forever).
---
Like most things there's a middle ground where you're progressing through the game at a good pace, and still enjoying the journey, and that requires understanding how to play effectively while keeping in mind that the point is to have fun.
---
この動画は以外がとても面白かった。
---
completing an elite was insane, but a master? that's fucking massive mate gratz
---
You already had 18 cannonballs in your cannon
---
All arcanas are $30-35 and are the most expensive "straight from valve" cosmetics.
---
Other items do cost way more but that's because we have an actual community market and the players/traders value them that high. League doesn't have that kind of system.
---
Void night. 
---
Real productive input there my dude
---
Think it’s a hard issue to fix because they keep releasing things to create space like the clue spots and now the seed vault. Totally agree with you btw.

Fuck I couldn’t agree more

does this work?

It would take a lot of resources to do the tournament correctly, I think many of us don't care about DMM and would prefer the resources be used on the game itself.
---
It's doable without spectral; easier, but not necessary.
---
Yes, its happened to some people who accidentally got their def reset recently due to a mistake Jagex made. It's a lot less significant or OP than you would imagine because def lvl plays a huge part in, well, defence calculations
---
Also this one here is fake fyi.
---
What’s rsi
---
Taking 30 is TERRIBLE. It’s obviously not necessary, but it’s really not worth it without. 
---
I only use bp on highly profitable tasks the cost is just not worth it IMO. Use msb I with tune arrows. 
---
Literally a couple days of efficient vorkath plus a day of construction training to be exact
---
Seriously, I'm 91 for the elite diary and I'm not touching it for a long time on my iron

not even 69% run energy. 9/10 for effort

🦀🦀 DMM Clans Control Jagex 🦀🦀
---
They’re doing this shit intentionally
---
It's good to look at them again. Hopefully runefest
---
Honestly like 15 hours is all it should take assuming you do efficient vork and you can stand construction training. I would rather do this before I ever go in W330 lmao.
---
D 
---
Oh I didnt see that part lmao
---
i feel like one action per prayer switch is a nice rule of thumb when you're learning. so like switch, tag a healer, switch drink a pot, ect
---
The day that J-Roc loses his flow, is the day that the hair on Jim Lahey's bald head grow.
---
I too have a zerk and it’s a shame you didnt afk another acc while making your zerk, having both is nice. Maybe consider not ruining it. 
---
I just tried to go around the island with zulrah each phase, if you think about it, youre never allowed to stay on one side of the island too long, just kinda go with him and focus on switching the prayer first then the gear,  so you dont die.
---
Eventually you learn where to go after taking damage. I tried looking at the guides amd shit but just found this way easier. Now im on 275kc, with a bp, serp helm and onyx drop btwbtw
---
So edgy 
---
So we make an ibans staff but better and with no quest requirements. 
---
Smoke should be 4 and 8 respectively. 6/10 would be a tad too high imo.
---
Shadow...should ignore protection prayer or at least partially as that is what Damis does during the quest. Like instead of 40% reduction in PvP it would only be 20% against shadows.
---
Is the sum of these numbers being 100.2% also some sort of meme?
---
Aww I coulda
---
This isn't actually him, this is: /u/hoorayforjay
---
Or the line waiting to do Vorkoth
---
Damn right. Banana Cape for the Marimboans like me.
---
it is actually weaker than iban staff.
---
Crimson Strike is melee-distance and hits 1 damage lower. Lava Blast hits 1 higher than fire blast.
---
How is it edgy it's literally just the truth. 
---
I’ll bring all the acorns I can possible find
---
Runecraft bad

Buy an Abby dagger

Deliberately covers all skills with runecrafting lvl 57, but doesnt bother taking his prayer and hp out?

How did that go? I feel like that'd be better than a grinder, not worse.
---

6 hours of Swampletics vs. Druid’s Bridge would be more entertaining than DMM tbh

More importantly, matches my ancient staff and vestment robes with skotizo Slayer helm for the ultimate functional fashionscape while bursting. Huge support.

Gzz man! Looking good! I got a champions cape and a chompy hat, rn grinding clue reawrds, got the spade and the clueless scroll.
---
Yes I get that, I am still hoping to recover my account for nostalgia/rs3 bond alt since it had maxed stats etc.
---
 
---
Back around that time I actually put in work and got the 4k hat after like 40-45 hours of grinding kills. I wore that 5 golden feather hat EVERYWHERE. It was a great way to meet other 4k kill players. I may have gotten Fletching and Cooking as my first 2 99s, but that golden hat was my pride and joy!
---
Simultaneously this plan also rids any chance of 6-hour logouts in the 1v1 stage.
---
why dont you try rather than posting here?
---
the only people who have a really strong understanding of how to recover accounts are people who make money stealing from people with a lot of in game wealth, and jmods ofc, who aren't going to tell you how to more easily recover an account beyond providing the info you know.
---
your character is equipped pretty badly too lmfao

You should have no problems recovering your account, if you are in the same country where it was created.

Teams of 10-20 in Castle Wars would be better and more entertaining.

I have tried once a few weeks ago and was denied, I’m not sure if I just keep submitting recovery and put in limited details in the 300 char limit everytime would help my cause, so I just wanted to know if anyone else have similar experiences and/or success stories

Just want to add that Ironman mode isn’t choreman mode, it just makes chireman mode that much more appealing.
---
I haven’t prayed flicked a single task, I don’t overdo herb runs etc. it just punishes you more than a normal account for not doing your chores, but it’s still playable any way you want, and is more satisfying in the end for doing that

I’m not disagreeing with the fact that you’re better off making money elsewhere. However for lower-mid level players it’s the best way to go upon it without dumping truck loads of money on herbalore that they most likely don’t have. I’m 99 herbalore so it’s beyond me at this point, initially I just made all the pots myself which helped a lot and it is essentially free exp since you’re paying it off and profiting through farming. Whether it’s worth the time or effort to make unf pots yourself is a different story, however you can make about 2-3k unf pots in about 30-45 minutes which at 200gp increase is about 600k saved by doing it yourself.

I’ve watched chymistry for a while now. I’m hoping to get into his learning raid sometime when I finally meet the requirements. He will call you out on your mistakes but that’s a good thing. He’s a teacher not your friend. He’s turned several bad players in to capable raiders. 
---
As for you comments on group content. I’ve always taken games as play however you want as long as it doesn’t negatively impact other players experiences. Realistically for the players this video is going to address they have a very long time until they get to multiplayer content. RuneScape is mostly a single player game except for a handful of activities and you shouldn’t let other people’s experience affect your own entertainment

According to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/cambridge-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IM1028_KO10,27.htm), the average wage of a software developer in Cambridge is £35,466/yr.
---
Also according to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Jagex-Cambridge-Salaries-EI_IE322592.0,5_IL.6,15_IM1028.htm), Jagex pays these wages:
---
QA Tester - £19,000/yr
---
Community Manager - £23,000/yr
---
Senior Software Engineer - £42,210/yr
---
These wages seem reasonable to me, but I don't live in the UK. 
---
I don't see the wage for a regular software engineer on the page. I probably would if I logged in, but I hate making random accounts for sites I will never use again.
---
Because he now has a reddit account with possible information to phish for connected to the rs username.

One I do is I always find myself switching to the skills tab and checking my XP left to level, despite having both a goals indicator at the top of the screen that shows that XP without me having to click the skills tab, and RuneLite.
---
In fact it's worse than that, I usually check the goals ticker first, and THEN switch to the skills tab like a few seconds later, like the number is somehow gonna be different. I think I'm just so used to checking the skills tab constantly while training from years of doing it back in 2004-2007.

I can, but I found clicking it then going back to zulrah to click a bit hard when I was learning

---
Im gonna say the diary triggers when your killed in zulrahs den with npc but coz you killed it and died the game couldnt trigger the dead npc part. I would've thought itd count off the boss kc tho
---
Some of which are difficult to read, not in a format I want, or just outright wrong! This works for me :)
---
How
---
I had that too, 7 items in 23 chest. But now I’ve done 100 and only gotten 1 item in those
---
If I could afford it I would. Is viggoras chainmace a decent alternative?
---
r/goblinslayer getting the hardest hard on in  hard on history
---
So what’s the time zone 
---
It's nearly identical to a d scim, just using crush rather than slash.
---
PST! Pacific standard time. I believe it’s like GMT -8:00?
---
if the tourney had gone on any longer, I'm pretty sure they would've bled into April
---
just needed to bring in some piss buckets for the streamers while they make the casters take turns sleeping and stalling on stream

Anywhere we can buy this as a poster? would love to have this in my room

---
Constant refactoring is the root cause of spaghetti code though... legacy systems are shit. Money is the only reason it hasn’t been reworked. 
---
I would personally be so fucking excited to build out a new engine for OSRS. There is such immense potential for improvement. 
---
D
---
This may shock you, but there are players besides btws
---
On the brightside though, once you get the pool, altar, top tier jewellery box, spirit tree and fairy ring in your house you're golden. So far, 85 construction is the best thing I've ever done on my account, helps so much when training slayer!
---
S
---
thanks very smart
---
Lure jad to a corner so you can safe spot the healer, its what i did since i cant multitask either
---
Should have gone for 69 prayer, 69 run energy.
---
Thanks very helpful and the snail like things are what? 
---
Disagree with this - think zulrah is easier once learnt. 
---
Yo is that an unfinished abby demon task you got there?
---
And 69 prayer, by just using up 1 point.
---
Why not have it be a weapon so it can work while you're moving?
---
14:00 PST is 21:00 GMT

for anyone who wants to know. :)

Make a second account into a main, or make a second pure and turn your current one into a main, former is easier probably especially if the pure is high lvl 
---
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💞💞💞💞😋 thank you!
---
We spreading crabs again?
---
Yes. 
---
Idgaf about DMM, but there’s an innumerable amount of features and content that could be rolled out consistently and without bugs if they took the time to build the game on a new engine. Take two years for all I care. It would make the game way better. Worth missing a year of trashcan broken updates and rollbacks. 
---
Go max 
---
I will be there, if you remind me when the day comes. I dont do calenders. :|
---
most worlds are like 300 ish ping
---
I'm not so sure this community would welcome an item that lets people move around while floating. Seems too rs3.
---
They’re not snails, they’re crabs actually.
---
Yo I struggle to Smith cannonballs on mobile. You people are nuts, congrats!
---
I’m not sure how to do it but you can set reminders on reddit :0 !remindme or something? I will likely re-post this a day or two ahead of time as well just Incase!!
---
I really wonder what Jagex was thinking when they made smithing rune platebodies require 99 smithing, especially with rune armor only requiring 40 defense. Like it seems bad in retrospect because the last time smithing a rune platebody was relevant, certain members of this community hadn't even been born, but even at the time it seems kind of strange. Clearly they anticipated that there would be tiers of armor beyond rune, and yet for some reason they decided that would be the end point of the smithing skill. 
---
Refactoring is what got us into this mess in the first place. That’s where the spaghetti code comes from. Too many devs touching the same shit without understanding the big picture. This shit engine doesn’t seem to offer any sort of encapsulated features anymore. 
---
Correct. It's kind of creepy you know that.
---
OP is based
---
Defender if doing it as main focus. Dfs and justiciar if afk alt
---
This was so epic! What a great job man hats off to everyone involved in this 
---
Oh my evil god. 
---
The more information you have of someones account, the easier it is to hack. People have gotten hacked over silly details in a screenshot I imagine, so the meme is covering every single digit
---
&gt; Light black
---
!remindme 13 days
---
I never get to see the W1 bots :(
---
1/5k
---
And at the end of the year when there has been no content and only like 4 minor QoL updates the complaints will be server population is dying and the game is dull.
---
The perfect example is Jagex already tried "taking a year off to fix the game" with RS3 and what has happened is those fixes haven't been implemented and the game itself hasn't had too many major updates.
---
What you're asking for is basically giving Jagex a free pass to not do anything and continue to underdeliver. 
---
The game is tons of fun as it is right now, and I can see the allure of making the base game itself stronger without adding new stuff. But they can do both, if they lied to you and made it seem like you can only choose between QoL or new content you're very easily mislead.
---
What needs to happen is;
---
* Jagex needs to be open with their community. Stop blowing smoke up everyone's asses and releasing PR statements that mean nothing.
---
* They need to get on top of the problems that the players have been bitching about since I started playing almost a year ago.
---
* They need to find their passion somewhere. Go look at the mod couch lately, they seem like they are bored and kinda just wasting time. Maybe it's a Q&amp;A issue but there is a clear lack of passion.
---
* Even Mod Ash has been caught looking kinda like he wants to fall asleep a lot lately.
---
So to surmise, imo, the issue is they need to be honest and find their passion. Constantly lying and under delivering on your product will cause depression and a lack of happiness. The two are mutually exclusive, you can't lie to your player base or dismiss them constantly and be happy.
---
Once they start being open with communication and delivering on their promises they'll find their passion again.
---
Currently they are on the road to becoming another washed up MMO developer where the only people who stick around 10 years later are people who literally know how to play no other games. Which is fine, you like what you like, but if that's your entire player base your developer team is going to eventually be of the same quality.
---
Java is the single most prevalent development platform to this day lol. You have no idea what you’re talking about. 
---
I don't think the point is to make it go up in price. It is it make it actually have a use. You are right though, the price of the staff is directly tied to chaos runes almost exclusively.
---
The arenas are redesigned with each tournament to fit the current seasonal theming - whilst fundamentally they're 1v1 arenas, they're brand new. 
---
It's the same concept even with a modifier.
---
I had to move my PC recently and got it running today if that's of any help.
---
I hated free trade being removed, gifting pretty much became impossible. Also, the revenants aren't nearly as much of a pain in the ass as pkers. I almost never died from them.
---
IT'S SPREADING
---
Same, but I'm the same with pretty much all games I don't play, it's hard to know when someone has done a sick move or whatever when you don't know much about the game.
---
I kinda laugh to myself that people still watch DMM. I watched the one last Summer or whatever and it was not my cup of tea. They have completely wrong ideology on how to run and support a Esport tournament.
---
* They think that multi bursting to get into the final 2,000's is anything close to skill based.
---
* They add unpolled extreme tier weapons to "make fights faster" so "less supplies are used"(Seriously a direct quote from Ayiza last Summer) aka make it so 3 or 4 hit combo's can happen and a fights over based on RNG in a matter of 12-15 game ticks.
---
* The constantly have to address griefing
---
* There is no limit or set period to play, if you can play 140 hours and buy someones adderall script you usually have the upper hand.
---
* They constantly change what gear you need to earn versus what they give you for free. Next season you'll get 85 slayer for free and 6000% whip drop rate because LUL.
---
* Bugs. Bugs Everywhere. Think about how badly League of Legends was doing early on in their esports career when games were won or lost on bugs.
---
DMM is a noble effort but they have no PvP experts within the company. They are using a set of newb developers to program a legacy model game. Just look at LMS, Castle Wars, or any of their other efforts. Its all dead content on a much smaller scale then DMM, if you can't make those work what makes you think throwing 20 grand into the mix and allowing for maximum corruption to be good clout for your esports tourney.
---
AMD GPU? If so, try toggling the GPU setting off and on. I've had some fps issues and read on the github that there are memory leaks.
---
If not, it might be something else.
---
delete runelite entirely and redownload it.
---
iirc osrs doesnt even utilise your gpu so it's all on that. is your disk running at 100? also, i never tried it but there's an option on runelite to use GPU i think so maybe try toggling that
---
Cept for pures

What can I say? I'm no Superman.

This takes crabs in a bucket to a new level.

---
How bout you meet me in wildy :)
---
Wait, what clients let you play at 60 FPS?!
---
I get that, but wouldn't you say that making rune armor require 40 defense does make it seem like they were leaving room for future content? If rune used to require 90 def to wear I would understand, but it seems quite clear that they didn't intend on stopping there. 
---
I agree to an extent, however I think the point he's trying to make is that even if you don't know what is going on you can atleast visually see something "cool" happening.
---
for example with overwatch (which I haven't played or followed in over a year so idk if this is still true but i'm assuming it is) even if you have never seen or heard of the game before watching a Hanzo ULT into a Zarya Gravbomb just looks cool AF. even if its not the highest skill play to pull off. or a reaper jumping into the entire enemy team with nano and wiping them with ult, not particularly hard but its impressive to watch.
---
where is RS I basically never feel like that happens especially when you have the issues like T posing while projects are shot at each other.
---
Panic pray

Meanwhile steam runes are crafted in the same altar, for 0.5 less exp per rune roughly 5k less exp per hour, waters cost the same as earths, but steam runes are like 150 ea

They are lvl 14 wildy. Telly out when you get a drop

Can something be done about Wyrms transformation animation stopping your character from attacking them?  Having to attack them once to get them to transform and then again to get them to actually do combat with them seems bad
---
Where can I get my hands on some gps?
---
I have too, but this isn’t the first Ironman I made. I burnt out early twice. I think I needed to hit a point of dissatisfaction on my main before I could commit to Ironman 
---
Yeah easy. The quest is not hard at all. 1st hour is running about RS and 2nd hour is killing some dragons
---
Wildy or gtfo 
---
Osrs would be dead without third party clients btw.
---
Oh that is actually 50/50
---
Start an ironman, you wont regret it
---
Increased vewi distance doesnt/cant render entities at a higher distance than the default client though, so its purely graphical, not sure how thats cheating? 
---
Yep
---
The ranged and melee ghosts at cerberus have very similar silhouettes. Could you update the model of the melee ghost to have a helmet or a shield or something so it stands out better?
---
This topic has been discussed on the q&amp;a before but not actually addressed. As a colourblind person I feel forced to use "cheat" plugins on runelite to make up for a deficiency which is not uncommon, and could easily be fixed within the game by just changing one of the models slightly.
---
You realise we can do lavas? Lol
---
It is
---
I did bronze to rune on my Ironman in like 2 hours, then it took me like 8k+ tokens just to get dragon, rng is wild. 
---
You can still use it to run further, unless that was changed since I finished RC? Makes stuff like astral RC insanely afk

How did Jagex obtain the infinity gauntlet to instantly remove 50% of the DMM contestants?

Could we see the Crystal Longsword be added into the game? Similar to a nerfed Chaotic Longsword? [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/axiba0/crystal\_longsword\_cls/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/axiba0/crystal_longsword_cls/)

Could we see the BiS Hybrid Helmet, the Master Pennance Helmet be Polled? You Jmods have already liked it on stream.

Could we see Possessed Ankou's and Acolyte Armour added in the game from the new Sea Slug Quest? [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8q5gmh/acolyte\_armour\_and\_possessed\_ankou/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8q5gmh/acolyte_armour_and_possessed_ankou/)
---
Could we see a change to mining pure essence to make it more viable? I understand it's heavily botted content and so shouldn't ever be profitable but as of right now on a low level iron the best options are temple trek or banshees. As pure essence is now incredibly cheap, even if you gave 20k essence an hour (not a suggestion, just throwing a very high number out there) it would still be completely worthless for bots. It would still be far far slower than zeah library/waiting for ess from pvm and doing ZMI but at least it would provide another option for pre-77 RC.
---
Is F2P magic rebalancing possible? What are your thoughts?
---
Glitchless, Warpless, Single segment, Blindfolded, RTA
---
I think we have room for a donation or two.
---
I honestly don't think they thought that far ahead. They figured rune would be the highest tier smithable armor and dragon and up would come from other sources.
---
The wildy gives these more generous drop table monsters in the wildy because you are likely to be attacked. Either tele out when attacked, tank 5 wildy levels with a teleblock, or don't be greedy and stay till a full invy ESPECIALLY now the looting bag is so good. 
---
Obby mauler.
---
You can train it's str entirely via fishing
---
Beside the fact this is obviously a joke this idea is dumb.
---
Back from RuneScape Classic, smithing was only up to addy iirc and a person actually grinded to 99 and they added rune platebody in honor of that person. 
---
On mobile at that if you're really pressed irl even
---
Maaaaaaah Ja Gertje!
---
Most people (63%) get a drop before drop rate though
---
It's the wilderness, there's the rest of the world if you don't want to get attacked, always have an escape plan and don't risk what you aren't willing to lose 
---
Is there a reason as to why its impossible to obtain multiple god imbued mage capes on the same inventory? for example say i killed justiciar zachariah to obtain 'justiciars hand' the option to kill him again no longer appears until i've returned the hand to kolodion. can this be changed? I think it would actually add a "risk vs reward" feeling to it.
---
I don't think I'd remove any skill as they all seem to kinda fit in, although firemaking is by far the most useless of them all so if I had to dump one it would be that.
---
As for adding, invention, just without damage boosting perks. Creation of utility devices and utility perks like small boosts to energy regen, -damage on venom etc. Dorgeshuun electricity could replace Guthix as the power source.
---
But you can buy one in Falador
---
This.

I got freaking 70-73 runecrafting last weekend and I felt so good.

Ayy congratulations, im \~24m dry for pet atm. I cannot bring my spider pet in the water when going to farm. Can you get back in the water with the pet out or is it a one-time-pet-in-the-water moment?
---
Could we get an update to the Banner Easle in the POH? It is a really cool feature for customization and allows for some cool flair. 
---
It seems that not many players use it or know about it at all. This could be because the items that can be recoloured are often not optimal.
---
Could it be possible to allow recolouring of iron items to spice the pure scene?
---
Yeah, there is a mixture of evangelion and maybe something else
---
Should make a YouTube series would be a nice watch!
---
Zulrah is harder to learn because of all the rotations, normally throws a lot of people off and makes em panic way too easily before Zulrah Out Dps' you to the point where you can't do anything other than tele or die (or miraculously recover at the rate it's better not to bother with the kill)
---
Vorkath is just praying one prayer all the time while killing the spawn and avoiding the acid pools, turning on your prayer occasionally. A lot easier compared but has little to no uniques ( Both vissy's being 1/5k) vs Zulrah's 1/512 unique drop table; Vorkath is more consistent with drops for money such as alchs whereas Zulrah is generally better for scales, seed drops and supply drops.
---
Dumb.
---
Well regardless of what you do, props to you for being able to do agility for more than like 3 hours at a time.. Lol anything longer than that and I start drifting off

When I was level 54 I had addy chain, med and legs and mithril sq
---
Fucking ballers smh...
---
I’d believe it. Runelite reports for me a little less than 800 kills. I haven’t gotten a single zenyte but I have unfortunately gotten several ballista pieces and 2 spirit seeds.
---
One of the biggest things for me is I'd like to know what clans are fighting what clans before they go to the 1v1s. I watch these mass pile ups and have no idea who's winning or losing and it's really just me waiting for 1v1s. 
---
The website looked completely legit and had me seriously convinced. The real problem I have with this is that my 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION was NOT even triggered.
---
Jagex won’t and shouldn’t help you imo. You breached your own account security by ignoring the stronghold of security warnings. Lucky for you it’s only 1.4m. 
---
Why not plant Watermelons, harvest them and dump them in the compost bin? With two patches that gives you more than enough to fill it. 
---
The problem I have with this is that I have 2 factor authentication on my account and it did NOT even work for the new device they had signed in on.
---
Shouldve used the crab song lol
---
Could be a Desert treasure sequel reward. Could even make it marginally better than other MA2 capes if the quest is hard enough to warrant it. 
---
Can we get the tutorial island character creation screen for: Hairdresser in Falador, Makeover Mage, Yrsa in Relekka, and Thesselia in Varrock?
---
Can we get a "Peek All" and a personal best timer for Cerberus? 
---
And killing the player counts as avianse kill
---
There are other ways to do a clan vs clan event than this mess. 
---
Forget about large scale Beta test. This should have been caught internally before such a test takes place. Your process of code written to code deployed is severely lacking automated tests, and it shows.
---
From the top of my head you could have...
---
- Simulated the 1v1 stage with bots / npcs.
---
- Automated tests that check white-listed areas for fog.
---
- Thought about separation of concerns. Create the arenas in a way that allows for themes to be changed independently of the underlying code in the area.
---
What does it take for you to start valuing tests and QA of your product? Nearly all DMM tournaments have had issues and the last few weeks devastating bugs have reached the live game. 
---
The problem I have right now is that my 2 factor authentication was not even triggered whatsoever. What is the point of using added security on your account if they don't even ask other people for it but ask me every time I log in?
---
Did you login on the phis site with 2fa?
---
I can't believe they made it into the real thing
---
No, this website did not ask me for my 2fa. That's why this makes no sense how they had gotten past this.
---
Even 2fa won’t protect you from dumb decisions. I know it’s harsh but apparently you need a reality check. Don’t visit random links and make it easy for them. There’s literally 5 posts a day of people falling victim to the same shit. I don’t get it. 
---
Mining/Fishing/Woodcutting guilds are all places where the more people there are the objectively worse it is.
---
Do you use same password for your mail? Check your spam/deleted folders to see if they had access to it and deleted the 2fa
---
Free yonkers 2019 
---
Yes please refuse to play the game, we don't need more dumbass falling for phishing websites cos of their greed looool
---
This is why you set a bank pin
---
It wasn't triggered because it isn't required to log onto the website to remove it for some reason. 
---
I've been able to get some of the scrolls passively. I got giant from slayer, goblin and imp from GWD kc, and skeleton from trying to get Vetion ring and/or pet. Probably not the fastest way, but it works out I guess.
---
I understand, I made a dumb decision and wasn't paying attention. But this is no excuse for the lack of customer support on their end.
---
Agree with this, I like most content being locked behind quests, I don’t know what changed where content is just churned out and given away so freely aslong as you can buy a couple of bonds.

No. All of my passwords are different per account.

The first ironman to ever forget to mention it
---
Exactly, almost none of the grinds are actually enjoyable. Some of them are, and some of them are for a while, but doing the same dull thing for hours and hours just gets boring, its normal. Tick manipulation and stuff like that can make it interesting, insofar as it sometimes puts me in a trance state. One of the reasons why humans like music is that it‘s so predictable and nothing unexpected happens in music - we want this consistency in our lives, and tick manipulation is going to give you that consistency instead of e.g. getting fish at random times. Also it‘s somewhat immersive. 
---
Great idea
---
There's a lot of things so I give you a short TLDR
---
- Torvesta was banned using an alt account. People got mad at that because it empowers clanmanmode even more (clans can use 10s of accounts just to boost 1 player, while a solo player isn't allowed to use an alt
---
- During the final stage (the 1vs1 stage) people that spawned in an area all got instantly killed by fog. Jagex couldn't restore all accounts and said themselves that roughly half could be saved, half remained dead.
---
People get their names stolen because people buy these names thinking a cool name is worth it
---
No support 
---
Because then it would actually be an insane money making activity. They alch for so much
---
Imagine not listening to the audiobook while reading a Japanese Manga and translating on the fly while comparing the panels to the visual novel on steam
---
Hopefully this will be a forerunner at agdq 
---
A clan for people of color? Count me in 
---
With the new clue scroll items coming out bank space is only going to become more of an issue.Would you consider adding a new upgraded clue scroll chest to the POH; the current one doesn't let you store some items unless you've completed the full set and in the past you've stated you'd be unwilling to change this due to the risk of introducing bugs. This new chest would allow you to store any treasure trail item and could use an interface similar to the seed vault. It could have a high construction and GP sink to keep it balanced. 
---
Might be. Photo exposure is not ridiculous enough to be Instagram. 
---
Deadmanmode got me back in. Joined a clan and when dmm became dead i joined them on 07
---
Thank you for your efficiency scape common knowledge 
---
Just because you are making an accusation, doesnt mean it is true. It is super scummy if you are attacking an innocent dude. A person should be innocent until poven guilty. From seeing his posts i dont think he is merching, but there needs to be a proper investigation before we can condemn or exonerate. People throwing accusations without proper investigations is how which hunts start.
---
Smithing lvls?
---
Wow didn't realise how gigantic our characters are
---
Smithing in OSRS is only useful in providing bulks amount of darts to use for Blowpipe and Canonballs.
---
Mining... is a requirement for some quests? Gotta admit that RS3's Mining and Smithing rework made those skills more appealing ans useful than what they used to be, including OSRS.
---
Remove graceful add resting, keep staminas.

Basically, yeah, a combination of max prayer and range attack.

No. This would drop the prices of the salad robes. We don't need this shit to be more accessible.

Whats with all the RS3 style cosmetic suggestions lately? Really don't like the way we're headed.

What should I be blocking using Duradel for best XP rates ? Looking for pretty much maximum efficiency setup till 95 slayer. I’m 73 now with 5 block slots available

I mean, it does have one use. Isn’t it used to build that one fence in your POH superior garden?

Smh ppl just seem to be asking to get hacked nowadays

This is a good idea.

But warding isn't going to pass,

So it's not a good idea.
---
Remove warding and sure! :D
---
Just like when Jagex announced new bis ranged gloves from ToB and ranger gloves spiked from 2m to 35m in about 6 hours?
---
Wait I don’t want any of that stuff in osrs. Just some genie pants for afking at the g.e. We already have teleports that have a cow kicking you to lumbridge, as well as rings that turn you into coins, a bush, and a rock. I don’t think floating is all that great of a leap to say it’d kill osrs.
---
The mechanic is that way because they couldnt fix it to work properly when the designed the sire. 
---
That question was asked a lot previously, but not that recently i think so maybe they are now able to fix it.
---
(Or woman. Im not assuming any genders)
---
Tfw you couldn't get a dragon med

If you took a long break and got hacked then it was used for bottling, maybe. Submit a ticket with the last time you actually played with any relevant information. 
---
One guy makes profit? Can't have good updates, nope, not at all. 
---
People already make billions at staking. Do you cry yourself to sleep thinking of that?
---
This all boils down to you not understanding that he is TEACHING raids, and therefore is teaching an efficient way of doing them. Imagine going to his stream to learn how to raid and he told you "you do whatever you want!".
---
I wouldn't kick people in ToB because they're inefficient, as long as we complete it. If they're being inefficient and there isn't any problem with clearing the raid, then it's just more loot for me. 
---
Ok, I will try that, thanks
---
Looks useful and a lot more condensed than most, only input is you don't need to use the blowpipe on long rang on the second phase as the fog isn't in that corner 
---
Entry level SE here make around 65-70k in the US, getting paid 35k especially for a game like RuneScape where you’re thrown into fixing a retards code from 2007 is laughable and almost insulting.

Only if your hands turn to fireballs while casting spells.

Theres no way it would kill osrs. We've been pushing it on cosmetics for ages now and nothings gone wrong.
---
Any tips on fire cape for mobile? I'm in the same boat as you, about to go for it and only played mobile 
---
btw 
---
Don't get stuck in the mud with these grimey fucks. Stay high and mighty like your floating blue pants.
---
How would doxxing someone help a hacker hack someone's account?
---
Torvesta wasn't banned just for using an alt account, he was banned for muling (placing a bunch of his wealth on an alt, which meant he wasn't risking it on his main)
---
I’d say make a regular account first and see if you want to stick it out. 
---
Woodcutting and mining guild would suck as a world.
---
Just went through his posts, that’s not what I’m seeing either
---
Tacky title but nice
---
I asked Mod Ash about the second statement and he said it would be [tricky](https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1074080882108043264), not sure what that would imply though.
---
The third point would be difficult because then it's creating a custom filter for the scions &amp; spawns (If I'm reading correctly)
---
As for the first point, yeah. Sire sucks to kill at the moment, the run time, respiratory and everything else that follows with it. In the foreseeable future, they will change it.  
---
Bitch it smells like dream and the sleeping cap.

Bring back castle wars
---
Yep :p messed up on those too 
---
Well said. I literally ran around the rooftops of Seers for 3 hours last night while watching a movie. Nothing about it felt like a grind. I hardly even paid attention to it. But by the end of the movie, I was 2 agility levels closer to my quest cape. I enjoy doing the quests. So, the way I see it, I feel productive without necessarily feeling the grind.
---
"Good updates"
---
Too good for btws 
---
Dag meneer de Bolleeee
---
Barrows gloves on mobile must've been hell
---
Jagex changes the genie random to give out this untradable set pieces instead of lamps
---
OP is found dead in a gutter the next day
---
All tokkul items are locked behind chaos prices, that is 100gp~ for 9 tokkul. If any item exceeds this price range, people can make 3-5m hr by buying 500k+ chaos runes from packs every hour. 
---
The weapon seems a bit op but the armour could be an interesting range alternative to proselyte hmmmmm.
---
A single farming expansion killed RuneScape for you? You must not have liked it much to begin with. 
---
Didnt blur out untrimmed strength cape, GG account.
---
Maybe to give back, or train people to eventually work there (though I never did)
---
They're like &lt;100 ea now, and keep dropping the more people find out about it. Soon enough YouTubers will make guides encouraging it and they'll be worth like 30ea
---
they alch for 48k so pvp death would be lower than that
---
Same issue happened to me, a few times I ended up with only 3 herbs from 1 patch at 96 Farming.
---
Maybe it's simply because they're too lazy to do it.
---
Not blaming anyone. I heard the pay at Jagex is low compared to others. 
---
On a previous Q&amp;A Mod Ash said that he would be in favor of giving Justiciar a small mage buff given that its magic accuracy is so bad you can't even cast crumble undead at Vorkath while wearing it.
---
Can we please poll giving both the body +10 and the legs +5 magic accuracy? This still leaves their magic accuracy as the worst in the game, but you can at least cast spells (that will never hit anything but allow you to put out fire at Olm and cast cumble undead at Vorkath).
---
Lol ur died.
---
It would still be worse than a blowpipe
---
I loaned my friend an Elysian and a Rapier but I have never RWTED! Wow honestly.
---
I mean like, I loved the update so much that I didn't do anything else and then got burned out.
---
I see that it wasn't obvious from my comment sorry.
---
I'm missing livesplit, including snarky titled splits
---
Its actually under FPS Control I believe.

Thanks! I'll bring my own pet squirrel with me to!

When will group ironman be released, or will it ever be released?

Nice work man! My account is mobile only too, got to jad twice but too much panic, 3rd time lucky 😁

This is going to be wonderful 😭💞

Faker than my 12 inch dick
---
Swap fury for occult. suffering (i) / imbued heart / bp for spec / spectral shield or mages book / jester shoes over wizard boots / strawberry baskets over sharks / pray for shark drops. Obviously if you have decent sized bank get a sang and knock out 200 in one trip but the above set up should get you closer to 60 kills a trip.
---
But do theu
---
Well that answers that. Still stressful haha. 
---
Grats man. Frame it above your mantel. 
---
Nah, they're probably working through the backlog of prizes. Give it a year or 10 and it'll all be sorted, surely. 
---
It takes 5m worth of obsidian gear in the form of 	10 Toktz-mej-tal (staff), 2 Tzhaar-ket-om (maul), 25 Toktz-xil-ul (archery ring)
---
Do you get a lot of crashes? I find if I'm in a higher activity or effects area my game sometimes just freezes on mobile. I've tried in iPhone 8, iPad pro, and pixel 3xl and all had similar freezes around GE sometimes. And a few times it's frozen while training rock crabs even. 
---
I'd be terrified to try an IM or UIM on mobile lol
---
Gosh it seems like its been so long since its come out. Its crazy.
---
Ain't that just the client?
---
He never said if though
---
Theres ways, not as fast as pvm but theres ways
---
I currently make 1.5-2m a day afk fishing at work
---
I like all of these ideas. But, what would the vyrewatch give on pickpocket :o
---
You guys have spoken about making skill cape and hoods a single item. Right now the hoods are absolute waste of space in the bank. West if I’m not mistaken recommended the hoods to be a toggle option, Please reconsider this again. 
---
Ooo that'd be so good for meleeing the black dragons
---
Love the content man! Keep us updated yeah :D
---
maybe you should move onto birdhouses
---
Jagex has told us a number of times that only items in the weapon slot can change our walk/run animation. 
---
this is either fake or outdated. you can easily tell by the lack of a herb patch
---
Hi Mod Weath, Recently I have been banned on my account "3loo\_v2" for RWT and I have never rwted on the account. I loaned my friend an ely and a rapier but other than that I have never sold any OSRS gp. I can not appeal the ban and I could not get any help on Twitter. I would appreciate it if you would give it a look.
---
Best regards,

He's more dangerous to his own bank than any hacker ever could be
---
I didn't realize everyone's was different! I wonder if it's tied to account creation? Mine ticks 2 and a half minutes early.
---
You seem very cynical but I don't really care enough to defend op so believe whatever you want
---
Don't do pcp kids 
---
One of my biggest hatreds towards RS3 is cosmetics. I'd prefer things stay the way they are right now. Really not happy about the treasure trail rewards were getting and the ones we got last time. Shit is way too over the top and wacky big XD lmao 
---
Well now it triggers me god damn it...
---
Just get mm2 done. Youll have 99 in no time
---
Ok but 17549 total is crazy good 
---
That mentality is exactly what that damage control post was going for. Nothing will change because from a business perspective investing time and resorurces will get then less profit than adding half assed content to the game and advertising it
---
You're moving the goalposts. I don't remember ever saying that 100% of his posts are merch posts. You might be replying to the wrong comment?

If you use red chins it costs a lot but, you get up to 600k do an hour. 
---
I was the OP.
---
PS4 has 4k, actually a higher res 4k than the Xbox, and crossplay is the one thing it does well. But i find no enjoyment in playing on the Xbox vs a player on the PC. PC player will whoop ya
---
Chin on mm2 tunnels. What kept me going was knowing that ranged is one of the fastest skills in the game.
---
Yeah it seems super random. Sometimes I can stay 10min+ in a world without interruptions and it starts bugging me... should I switch worlds or keep on hoping to be alone for a few more minutes :) and other times I'll get aggroed within the first 30 seconds of me entering the cave ..  I finished my task and you're right I'll always have some spare points now for these kind of situations !
---
LOL! Exactly I think he just likes making suggestions lol.
---
Never said they were good.
---
RANDY, YOUR STICK!
---
&gt;is jagex still actively looking to buff it 
---
I think you misunderstood the situation. *Reddit* was actively trying to buff it. Jagex never was. 
---
I had no idea there was an obsidian staff 
---
\&gt;He's doing it to things he can't merch
---
\&gt;Evidence of tradable items spiking directly after posts
---
\&gt;Alright, whatever, dude. You seem pretty negative or whatever idc
---
???
---
no probs! the gif itself is really just a bunch of dudes hammering a pole, seemed like the reason for their order was just less likelihood of two adjacent guys accidentally hitting each other if their timing hiccupped, because a 1-2-3-4 order could mean 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4 bump hammers if they are out of sync, but a 1-2-4-3 order reduces the risk since you only have 1-2 and 4-3 run the same risk if someone slows down or speeds up on accident. That could just be a major coincidence with how the timing of a 4Cyl engine works, but it was interesting nonetheless

---
Depending on your goals, ranging your slayer tasks can be great. Not the best xp, but it definitely adds up. Tbh, getting to 99 seems like a hurdle but it's just one step at a time. When training slayer it almost feels like passive gains
---
I'd like a vendor that sells impling jars personally. 
---
if chinning is too much money, unless there's a specific reason to get 99 you're better off doing it passively through slayer with cannon/blowpipe
---
Don't need to. Anyone on desktop official client can trash anyone on mobile just fine lol. Mobile controls are simply inferior to desktop controls. The notion that the skill ceiling is anywhere near as high is laughable. 
---
And while they're at it let us disable the deposit worn equipment button in the deposit box. I've accidentally deposited my prospector way too many times.

You're investing a lot more time into this than I'm willing to, enjoy your day
---
Even though he says it's worse than BP but take a fact that barely Noone is doing skulled BP and with this bow you would just skull salve and this for dumb dmg. It's not needed as revs is already stupid profit 
---
No idea. Figured it would be easier than trying to put the formula in a reddit comment
---
So much time for such a shitty set.
---
Account security is going to be taken seriously?
---
We havent heard anything since that message two weeks ago and to me it was nothing but a damage control move to avoid the auth delay &amp; customer service spam in the DMM stream.
---
Well that's an opinion right there.. I think they are interesting.
---
They could add a machine gun and it would still be worse than the blowpipe
---
I love gifs of a bunch of dudes hammering poles
---
Have you ever thought about adding different wepons for magic that can auto-cast. like a sword with the same stats as a battlestaff, but move crush bonus to slash/stab and have an auto-cast function. Would be very cool to have some different visuals and some variations for magic casting aside from only staffs. The sword could, if not to hard to implement, have it's own casting animation where you lift it up into the air to cast spells. 
---
It's fine that you lose items on death, that's how the game was originally designed. 
---
No to instanced wilderness bosses.
---
They have 0 means to punish skulltrickers.
---
I actually wholeheartedly disagree, the final hour is fun in my opinion. Watching clans collide on one another and take each other out is very exciting. Anyone who has ever war’d in osrs before knows what’s going on during the big team fights. If Jagex could just make sure the game mode went smoothly, DMM would be amazing to watch. I had a blast watching the most recent DMM if you disregard the bugs that happened, the bugs were what ruined it. 
---
Took 6 minutes, but sure
---
Why do you get sour and be a bit of a jerk when you're wrong?
---
Say what?
---
are farming contracts actually profitable? when I tried it I seemed to be losing money since I kept getting trees
---
hcim btw

Want to do some raids? :) I'll do it on mobile and you can do it on regular client with no fkeys..

Let's see who lasts. Lol

Literally this clip doesn't show anything. If you are going to accuse someone on something, at least make sure the clip shows it.
---
A few years ago I tried out Konduit but didn't find any of its features all that useful for skilling. The xp tracker was cool and so was being able to easily look up people on the high scores but those were the only two things that I liked.
---
Just for um... research purposes, what was your ISP when the account was created? Just trying to get to know you better is all /s
---
Good, remove
---
no swampletics gifts pls ;)
---
Use a proxy from Lithuania to try and recover the pure. 
---
I would love this, it’s similar to how bonds affect rwt. Put a small tax on it and boom. Another massive gold sink, and control of a shitty market space.
---
Yeah this is straight up slander
---
6 way in 1 tick isn’t AHK... maybe if you barrage the same tick but even that is possible
---
U sound like classic “everyone better than me is hacking” lol
---
Watching the video in question, because you couldn't be bothered to link it (I only found a "10 way switch"), I didn't see him do 10 actions in a single tick at any point? "Holding you to it" is simply if you're going to make an extrodinary claim, then you should have something to back it up with.  And if you can do it, please show me a video/gif of yourself doing it in one tick in risk-fight pvp.  I'm not sure why you're getting so upset or defensive, has nobody eber challenged you to show proof lol?
---
I mean theoretically, You can get both magic and palm tree seeds very easily through Zulrah, not that I would imply that I would want them to come through another Boss but even the alchemical Hydra and some other bosses drop them VERY rarely; probably at a 1/1k+ rate which seems a bit too rare, but that's my point of view.
---
Brimstone keys while they can roll on the table as well with how many come into the game is somewhat reliable but not really a reliable way to get them
---
x[)
---
Use RuneLite and just use those features with GPU rendering. Honestly I can’t play the OG client because low FPS is awful. Once you have 50 FPS, there isn’t any way I’m going back to 20.

Can the design/recolor for ancestral be polled or addressed from this post https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aysxdb/heres_my_take_on_that_idea_for_ancestral_recolors/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app    Every time someone posts/reposts it, it ends up top of the page so there is clearly demand.

To be fair, they're most guilty of copying Ultima Online. I've been doing some research on MMO/RPG interfaces recently for a project of mine, and looking over old screenshots from Ultima, it's incredible how many similarities there are. I recall one of the Gower brothers mentioning once that they took a lot of inspiration from Ultima and it really shows when you start comparing. Color scheme, widget layouts, even skills.
---
Man I remember when I was young and just started playing, I was at the local library and some dude that was far older than me was like “here man you wanna know how to make bank” walked me to Varrock attacked a guard and got me killed :( was a sad day lmao
---
So you're saying if you lose access to your authentication in a legitimate way (phone lost etc), you should permanently lose access to your account? nice
---
Did you blood barrage off of the healers at triples and did you camp rigour during jads and zuk? Gratz on the cape! 
---
My hp was only below 3p because i new barrage phase was coming. Black tile is where you move immediately AFTER he shoots acid, you'll yhen want to spam click towards the safest area, diagonal movements prevent getting bombed. 
---
Orange spot is for blowpipe, but u can black with dhcb.
---
Im upset because this conversation has been convoluted and dumb since the start, im claiming people 6 way switch all the time..... but you can do 8 actions per tick.
---
You can also click on the boat to take you to vorkath instead of clicking on Torfinn
---
I'd believe anything at this point 
---
And you can also take 4x the time per trip.
---
But hey, if you're the type of person to get 99 cooking with shrimp because "you can do it at level 1" regardless of the better alternatives, then power to you.
---
I don't think wild bosses should be out into a lair, but I do agree bosses like Callisto and Venanatis should be given actual fight mechanics outside of having stupid defense and hitting constant 40+ damage ranged attacks. As they currently are, the most effective way to solonthese bosses is bugging them into safespots. This is not very interactive and requires no actual PvM skill
---
I would explore the non members area for a while first! Do all the quest and what not. level up your stats a little bit and have fun! 
---
And then Jagex realise what they have done and in following months they made rune items easier to get to, by adding them to monsters drop tables
---
There's no reason that this would have to work the same way the other chests work. It could be something like 1/5k per chest.
---
And why are you assuming it won't stack with salve?
---
I feel doing it as a group of 2 would be easier than the few hundred I've soloed...
---
You also need access to the account's email address to remove the authenticator. And if that happens losing some virtual gold is the least of your problems.
---
Thanks for the tip :)
---
And not having a Spotify notification from 6ix9ine. Haha just kidding.
---
I play rs3 over osrs. But imo do whatever you want. Don’t become an elitist. Play how you want and just enjoy the ride :)
---
Other sites have backup codes for this reason. Account recovery also exists for this reason.
---
How do you handle broken/new phones then? Unless we have a physical authenticator you literally need the option to disable it without your phone. 
---
Ok thanks what would you recommend for the desired level of prayer for a void ranger to pk on
---
i dont blame people for getting scared of improving though; some fuckers i played with were the most toxic i've encountered in osrs yet.
---
Options &gt; Controls &gt; F1 Keybinding &gt; Tick the circle which says "Esc closes current interface"
---
With backup codes you can write down or print out. Other sites (gmail, steam, github) have these on their 2fa.
---
69 hp as well
---
To each their own, but it seems your taste resides in the gutter.
---
Other than consistency in the content, no, no reason. Because a 40% boost to damage is a bit much
---
I held onto an elite clue for the longest time. It took forever to finish but finally yesterday i was able to do it. I felt so accomplished. I open the casket. I was reward with 70k in loot. Did a two step, easy clue in 5 minutes after and was awarded over 100k in loot.         
---
Why the elite took so long? I had to do the ape atoll agility course. Trained agility, did MM1, and the receipt for disaster monkey part. And the pre required quests. Had to do Kings ransom, underground pass and regicide. And a handful of other pre required quests. Had to train prayer to do chivalry. I don't like quests usually but this is a good excuse to do them and to train skills. 
---
Unless it had a different meaning even further back...
---
I say it every time I kill a boss. :)
---
I always see new players. Theres a reason barbarian assault isnt dead. Theres always noobs getting their torso. 
---

Yep that's me, sup
---
Dude they has this stream last week
---
Yep this is what caught my eye, too. Not necessarily rip backs, but the other 3 are doing way more work and getting way less work done.
---
A month of doing at least 3-5 hours a day of just scrolls. I’ve been laid off of work so it’s been a lot of no lifing this game. 
---
52 for the smites.
---
I won't. Maybe I'll try rs3 as well. Thanks!
---
Okay thanks! 
---
Curious as to what you enjoy more about rs3 compared to osrs?
---
Looks like someone is shadow banned
---
Get dat 99 str. 
---
It’s a quality meme man! 
---
Even better. Wieldable genie lamp, cupping it with both hands
---
60m was a lot more in 2009 than it is now. And I'll bet you just got phished or downloaded a keylogger rather than actually getting hacked.
---
I haven't called anybody an idiot, but thank you for the response.

---
Is that the weed number????
---
Very first episode of Star Trek isn’t it? The one with Pike, before Kirk?
---
Our entire cc just got kicked at the same time, weird.
---
HD isn't what made RS3 bad though.
---
but thanks to Runelite OSRS can look much better than it did originally. Once they figure out ground blending and water texture swapping, I'll be perfectly content with Runelite GPU graphics.
---
Yep, ty Jamflex
---
You mean people got kicked from their clans lol
---
Do ranarrs on disease free patches and toadflax on regular. It's pretty much guaranteed profit.
---
Yep. 
---
Yep me as well, everybody got kicked from the CC they were in..
---
Was at third phase olm in a solo........... ty jiggleflox
---
I got kicked in the cox by my wife 
---
Yes sir

Why? :(

same, dont have time for another before work... great

Only here for the smackdown
---
we did as well, was half hp at head
---
Entire cc got kicked at the same time, said we left the channel

Perfect for a maxed med. Get 75 attack/def + 77 prayer (augury is worth it).

---
I can't say he rwted or not, but doesn't it seem a little fishy that he just happens to be killing Zulrah with 3 tbows and apparently switching out each one? Does that make any sense? This seems pretty sketchy if you ask me. 
---
I have an even noobier story at most. I played when I was like 8 years old, it was 2005 or something, before the GE. I was completely hopeless at the game but loved it anyway, I had no idea how to make money or get items.
---
I was thrilled when a random dude in Varrock gave me 1k and a full set of bronze plate one day. I was so happy. 
---
Then my friend from primary school lured me to follow him and we went to the Al Kharid mine. I was immediately killed by scorpions as he intended.
---
I found him selling my armour to the general store in Lumbridge, I didn't speak to him for what felt like a week. I felt so betrayed. 
---
Jagex: fucks up every DMM tourney

Jagex fucks up present DMM tourney

---
Do you plan on revitalizing the fight pits and castle wars? 
---
Sure it's not a good idea with the state of account security but he was just being silly using 3 bows for zulrah. It's just being excessive for the sake of the joke.
---
nah leaving the status means he can keep streaming and bringing in income. HCIM rebuild is pretty decent content

I'm just gonna say it......I prefer the dubbed anime version..........

Good luck failing your class dude.

got kicked from olm in 361 as well, same exact thing
---
That skill only has you hacked not dead

The chat server hiccuped and everyone was kicked out of their clan chats across the entire game.

Even with a Dinh's, you're still relying on RNG against skilled or many opponents. Agility is the best escape from revs, second only to avoiding conflict entirely in the first place.
---
We got kicked out of 350 aswell
---
You click the button
---
I pressed the downvote arrow twice for you lol
---
I find that more believable though if theyre just interested in his wealth.
---
What I dont believe though is this:
---
1. He gets twisted bow from raids
---
2. He goes to his bank withdraws 2 MORE TWISTED BOWS to do zulrah
---
3. Gets hacked right after xdpDpDPDPd
---
'Imagine' if he had just done zulrah with 1 twisted bow like 100% of the people with twisted bow does then he would still have 2 twisted bows in his bank and it wouldnt affect him, but he was greedy and wanted to RWT more than just his 1 tbow (because he can get as many twisted bows as he wants from raids its a safe death, and if youre gonna RWT 1 twisted bow to risk getting banned u might as well RWT all 3)
---
No1 should believe theres any chance he didnt RWT. You cant be THAT stupid naive and gullible.
---
Same, I got lured for 1k and a set of bronze plate when I was like 7 or 8 in 2005.
---
No idea this was a thing. Thanks!
---
Every world, every clan closed simultaneously

The inventory item icon changes like all the scims and the whip etc. happened after HD. My favorite private server revision is 508. That's after HD and after god wars but before they ruined the d scim.

"give me a free thing that devalues the other thing"

The state of OSRS lately. Vorkath's head and kq head should never have been given a guaranteed drop.

I hope mine can help, if you have any questions on how to interpret it, you can ask me too!

How is he gonna get redwood logs?
---
dual wielding bows huh
---
&gt; wouldn't of  
---
wouldn't have
---
He just replied to someone claiming RWT in his chat with "I mean, it's not out of line doing zulrah with 3 twisted bows", this guy has to be trolling.
---
I think so too right? I saw Torvesta pking with a similar acc, seems super viable! 
---
[https://youtu.be/EojfyJ-9St8](https://youtu.be/EojfyJ-9St8) \- "E X P" acc, check it in-game :)
---
Looks cool right? I think that cb should be well populated also, especially in PVP-worlds.
---
Thanks!
---
You can buy it in the ge, why would they make it a guaranteed drop 
---
1. Can loot piles be changed so that wyrm bones (and maybe other bones too) always are on the bottom ? 
---
2. Can the questions at the Q&amp;A be displayed on screen again? Sometimes I miss the question or can’t hear it.
---
3. When doing the Treasure Trail, are you guys also changing the way elite cryptic clues work?
---
All clan chats are randomly "kicking" people. Jamflex at it again with the postponed April Fools joke
---
I wonder if this is REAL. I mean what in the WORLD were you thinking? This is as dumb as Jagex removing free TRADING  
---
Much more efficient to use abby dagger/bludgeon to 99 str first though.
---
Keep 70 att and get peity, 70 att accts are insane with dh
---
Some players will play with whip and a dragon scimmy switch for aggressive since whip is so much better. But any attacker who uses melee is probably a noob. Range is so fucking overpowered in BA.
---
Yes. Why would you ever go to empty servers to skill? I skill on populated servers so I can talk that shit with the boys.
---
It spread to the battlefield 5 subreddit as well

Just asked him why would anyone possibly do zulrah with 3 tbows in their invent and I got banned within 10 seconds, calling bs on this. 
---
This happened to me 2 days ago 
---
No
---
Yeah, you’re right.  I play with a friend which helps, and I know there are clans around which I need to check out.  Thanks!
---
Of melee weapons it's literally BIS for 3 out of 4 attack styles. You only need 1 switch, and especially with the recent update where it now remembers attack styles across weapons, it's pretty good. 
---
 Invisibility is either overpowered or underpowered in every scenario I can think of. I can't think of any way to actually balance it in a way that it wouldn't be abused
---
Shadow Boxing also sounds really overpowered unless the monster you spawn gives no xp or items in which case what's the point.
---
Shadow casting is just pointless.
---
I should mention you would need to get 70 def and prayer for peity, but your acct won't be great without veng
---
I find vorkath more chill but I feel incredibly stressed when I tab out at vorkath and often have to scurry to dodge a fireball. At zulrah I can tab out and type no problem at high hp, but it becomes high effort when hp tanks and there are snakelings around. 
---
You'd rather pick up a guam leaf then the bones?
---
i think when i get the account ready for raids and pvp,  I will probably make a iron man if i have time, thanks :D
---
That's what I do while at work. Actually, cannonball speed would be even better if we're talking afk.
---
Prayer flicking can suck it. Only time I ever even attempt to do it, is when im almost done with a task and I'm out of pots. Can't be bothered
---
Slayer is good for training combat although I would not suggest starting at lvl 3 combat.  Theres some quest out there like Waterfall Quest, DS1, Fight Arena, Grand Tree, etc.  that can give you some nice combat stats.  Usually after questing my accounts are in the like mid 50s for attack and str and mid 40s for defence.  After that id suggest some training on some sand crabs to get to base 70 melees and to get some range levels.  After that you can either do slayer for training (with guthans now cus yeah dont train slayer without sgs/guthans) or you can do the afk as hell NMZ training to get to base 90s really quick.
---
Obsidian strike should be the lowest level spell (fire strike, earth strike, etc.)
---
Blue phat peak was around 2400$ on sythe although many people didnt know how to find the real RSgp rates so paid much higher per mill
---
Can Iban's staff be changed so that if you spam click an enemy it doesn't cancel the attack until you stop?
---
Im talking about people who bring just a whip and have AFK or use magic for 1/3 the game. Bringing switches is fine if you really want to use a whip, but if you're going to put in that effort to bring multiple weapons, you might as well just use ranged
---
I second this.
---
Maybe he is cutting yews
---
I lured a level 3 for absolutely nothing
---
I like it!
---
Showing people lots of money works easily lol. He was also a rwter so probably knew people who bought their phats for irl
---
What is CoX? NEwish player here
---
Nice frog leather 
---
for the love of god, players, keep your weapon idea's to yourself. if 10% of the suggestions made it to the game there would be 500 useless items by now. seriously stop trying to reinvent the game
---
Ironman?
---
OMG thank you
---
Fighter torso is a good (and free) offensive chest slot before bcp, the gloves that reduce your weight, and high value gambles for the pet are 3 big reasons
---
i care
---
Agreed, I have done almost all of my combat via Slayer and it keeps you way more focused on leveling Slayer than combat.
---
Chambers of Xeric (Raids / Raids 1)
---
Upvoting for Mod smackdown?
---
Yikes copying resources from WDR and not even giving them credit 
---
fuck that's cool. 
---
ah ok thanks homie
---
So theoretically you would it be useful to have someone use the karils crossbows special on high levels that likely have 89 agility?
---
You poor soul. It must suck getting a 20m drop.
---
Np 
---
You ever go there with sounds on full blast? Shits bumpin better than sea shanty 2
---
every ironman account ever. Total sperg-out if the group isn't fast enough. 
---
Slayer Dart?
---
Where is your source? You made up a number out of your ass.
---
He raised with 2 tbows when he got his 2nd one like a week ago, if I got 3 you bet your ass I'd run around with all 3 for awhile 
---
Hahaha holy shit. Why are they shoving the authenticator down players throats if it's that simple to remove it?
---
I don't think I'd play the game if I couldn't use runelite at the very least osbuddy pro. So think of it as you will.
---
Pretty sure that’s like a 1/7,000,000 chance of happening
---
The suggestion states that you stop floating upon attempting to walk, so it would be like rings of nature, stone or coins.
---
That’s been happening to me for a few months... started to think clan didn’t really want me 
---
Support Shades of Mort'ton expansion and a use for redwood pyre logs, not sure about these rewards though.
---
you lost me buddy, karils crossbow special?
---
28k??? 
---
mate its like 70k in kentucky of all places
---
Hahahaha. I actually homeported to fally right after that and he was already in the bank putting on another set of ‘noob’ looking armor so he can continue to beg. Gotta love killing beggars 
---
Took a month of moderate play (2-4hrs, not every day) of bp in nmz for me to get 99. 
---
Still unfair to those who want to pvp without using AHK.
---
Thing is, you are a new player as you played 10 years ago. He probably meant people who have never touched any kind of RuneScape.
---
u/Jagex_Weath this screams rwt, might want to take a look?
---
I mean the set effect when you wear all of Carol's equipment together you have a chance of lowering your targets agility
---
*Cries in C Engineer*
---
I'm a big fan of his stream, even a subscriber. But if this is RWT I'll bail. 
---
Maybe they will fix it now since it is kicking pvmers out of raids because pvp clans/snipe teams that are mains/pures in f2p and p2p have been bitching forever about these clan chat glitches.  It's fucking horrible.  Fix your game. 
---
Same for me. Subbed, huge fan. Great pvm but its really fishy man :/
---
Not defending him or crucifying him here but I'm giving him the benefit of a doubt because I know if I got 3 tbows I'd definitely run around with all 3 of them
---
"I'm a retard and my rs password is the same as the email one"
---
Err but achhually I am and iron Man with anecdotal experience I must be corrrrect.... Alot of people have made a thread recently (my dumbass included) I didn't click links, my emails weren't compromised, and there was no malware. The dumbest thing I did was have the same password for 2 accounts. The real solution making authenticators work. I got no email about a disabled authententicator because once again the email wasn't compromised.
---
So you're telling me PKers would have to just spam right click until they find someone? That is idiotic.
---
You'd get the same xp rates but without the downsides.
---
Honestly I missed the shadow casting other players thing. You really don't see any issues with that?
---
ah yes, the internet age of 10 years :p 
---
Can the Desert hard diary unlock new (but further away) shortcut to the Kalphite Queen? There is a perfect spot for one where you walk past the first kalphite soldiers. Most people can only manage one kill per trip and even at high agility and full run energy, you can't there in one go from the fairy ring.
---
This wouldn't devalue the elite diary that much because you still lose alot of time by having to walk around to this new shortcut.
---
Personally I feel like they shouldn't ever add unique idle animations unless they're tied to gear that's insanely difficult to get, like an Infernal max cape or getting 200m xp in a skill. I wouldn't mind cool idle animations if they were the kind of thing that required that much time and effort, I wouldn't want them to be so widespread that you're able to just go to the GE and see 10-15 different idle animations bankstanding, and I wouldn't want it to be rng-based, I'd want them to be tied to achievements which are difficult enough to obtain that seeing someone with one in-game would actually surprise you.
---
all good. i can always change it...does 24 hp sound better? 
---
It's called multiboxing. You can do so even through Runelite, with the right plugins. Basically all the accounts mimic the mouseclicks and keystrokes of a "master" account.
---
some people actually need to hear this. 
---
We are assuming nobody is dumb enough to use same password for years, which unfortunately isn't the case
---
ahh gotcha, never thought about that bet yes i imagine so but you'd be relying on rng a lot and i've never seen it in use! personally if i where you i'd bring a dihns with 84 agil and a summer pie to boost to the shortcut :D
---
My god samsung really are thorough when it comes to their fridges! 
---
None of the content developers are the people that work on that stuff though, so why should they stop making content?
---
What they need to do is higher people to work on those stuff not have everyone else stop working...
---
landlines in 2019 lul
---
Trust me we all look acoustic
---
I tried to get this to the chair of the committees’ attention via Twitter (he checks it during the meeting) but no luck.
---
Seemed to be a misrepresentation that RS GP has no real world value when clearly we know that isn’t the case. 
---
They took about 120m in stuff.  They just didn't bother with the little things.
---
Do you not log out if you don't interact with the game for like 20 mins or something?
---
Yeah that's what I was going to say as well. But I still feel that RS players have still been in longer than WoW just because the game has a nostalgia that the latter doesn't have. Guild Wars is the only other long running one that comes to my mind but that is nowhere near an 8 year figure. 
---
Can the ectophial be changed to not empty at all. Every time I forget to wait a few secs and run away with an empty ectophial. Then after my farm run I have to run all the way back from Canafis :S
---
F
---
Splashing on nibblers is super common in justiciar. For blood barraging to heal, you need to drop stuff and take it off or put on ancestral
---
They will be in the bond pouch. You have to move them from your pouch to your inventory to see them in game - small arrow moves it along! 
---
&gt; Ok
---
I wouldn't rwt but would I think RWTers would RWT? Hmm... Yeah, I think theres a great possibility of that. Stay gullible and naive, sheeple.
---
Well i meant like i can't acces the Google authenticator app from my phone since it's broken. 
---
I did it a while ago so idk if they changed it, but occasionally I would have to absorb if I got unlucky with spear procs, but if I wasn’t unlucky I wouldn’t log out for 6 hours
---
So you crashed him and he got mad?
---
That's well said.
---
Thanks, def gonna do sone zulrah and barrows, gotta build the bank up so I can start doing the big bosses. Currently doing herb runs and slayer.
---
Then what about jugs of wine fermenting or tree saplings? 🤯
---
Could you imagine thinking standing AFK in a spot is adding life to a video game.
---
You need access to the email to delete it. Secure your email with 2 step and your account is secure.

"I ONLY HAVE 40 SECONDS JUST LET ME GRAB MY WINE"

For what it’s worth, he’s essentially written into the lore of the 5th age with the 10 Year Anniversary event. 
---
That would be cool though I love writing RS events into lore. 
---
Will do thanks!
---
Grats I want to learn dks too. Is it harder or easier than you thought?
---
Rip
---
Under 40m?
---
Need to build bank so I can get some kind of gear for that
---
There’s a bond pouch. You have to click on the wrench icon and then you have to pay x amount of gp to make them tradable. I tried doing it on the osrs app and couldn’t find it so you may have to be loved in on a pc to find it 
---
Impossible. 
---
I'm going on about 20 years. I'm not pleased with Jagex as a company, but i can't lie, they did a solid job at reviving OSRS and bringing it to mobile. That was a great move.. 
---
Guild wars was LIT. I LOVE that game. Gw2 wasn't as great. But guild wars 1. man. Great great times... 
---
What is that inventory for castle wars lol
---
is it really crashing when you can just share? as long as you don't have to wait on eachother (too long) / attack eachothers monsters it's fine imho.
---
Then quit this shit game and find something with competint devs
---
It's a thing because someone could have a high level iron man and decide they dont want to be iron man anymore. 
---
\&gt;You're missing the fact that it is the safest area to stand.
---
It's literally no safer than any other area because the poison is random.
---
\&gt;The tiles are marked so you know where i am?
---
You can also locate yourself by looking at the screen. The markers don't designate any special tile, just the ones you chose to use. They have no innate significance.
---
\&gt;Sharks are expensive
---
But allow you to have more kills/trip, thus increasing your overall kills/hour. More kills/hr = more gp/hr. 
---
\&gt;and useless as you want full hp if using blowpipe.
---
I don't understand what you mean by this. How are monkfish better at keeping you full hp than sharks?
---
I was in a clan called Ancient Guardians. Definitely support.
---
The guy facing the camera in the back, he chokes up on the hammer after he hits the stake 
---
Literally just saw this GIF in class yesterday 😂

pretty sure that was part of the motivation tbh nothing gets osrs twitch/youtube viewers excited like a rebuild or "from scratch" series
---
Gonna start doing those diaries too!
---
Dwarf in the flask
---
This guy doesn't know efficiency ehh
---
If you didn't have authenticator installed on any other device you'll have to disable it first and then set it up again. But I'm still not sure what you're asking because the authenticator doesn't have anything do with phone numbers. You don't even need a phone to use it.
---
Not everyone has a high IQ like yours.
---
 turn your private off if you don't want to hear the truth
---
Rip account

&gt;:(

There are like 8 bloodvelds and it was at peak hours. Normally there are a standard 2/3 people doing them. 
---
He was just being a bitch thinking he owned the place. Or in shorter terms, an ironman.
---
he's like a better a friend, a bestfriend
---
Because it's in rs3 and we can't have rs3 things in osrs right?
---
$11 btw
---
I’d stay training them one at a time to get your str and att up. Higher str and att = higher xp rates 
---
And his videos get double or triple that number in views. He's going to to keep flying up.
---
now the poor guy will never learn how to tie his shoes
---
cringe
---
Yeah, dude. You open a graph, select a date, screenshot, and upload to imgur. That takes like a minute total.
---
Well i don't have access to a cellphone right now. I've been trying to download an authenticator on desktop but i can't seem to figure out how it works. It does ask me for a phone number to validate which i don't have right now.
---
I found the bond wallet but the initial 2 I bought didnt show up in there
---
I'm flattered that my code stood out to you as Nobel Prize material.
---
Serious note, any chance a sub like that exists? Would love a sub with posts of programmers that are serious about their code but it's garbage or of people who took a class and think they're the next Margaret Hamilton.
---
A friend? Sparc Mac? Im sure plenty others have too. Its just how smart you sre about it sadly.
---
You can't choose permanent on tutorial island. After 1k total, you can go see the ironman tutors to make it permanent. 
---
“”Swamp man good” good” good
---
You don't ***buy*** nats, you get them from kurasks obviously 
---
Yeah that's fine, Jagex clearly realises this and that's why they let people keep using it. But, I do believe, it gives its users advantages over people who only play on the official client.
---
Probably because for most ironmen it’s not their first account, or first time getting fighter torso/level 5 all roles. Seriously tilting when you get retards on your team that didn’t even do the tutorial, and lose you points by attacking with the wrong style
---
Stardew valley! 
---
Oh. Maybe I can change it now lol, could only make the choice on tut island when I checked 
---
play with my donger
---
plz
---
its a difference of getting 20-30 in USE and 100-130 in USW
---
You don’t think they fucking know that dude? Shit takes time 
---
I mostly have this problem on mobile, but thanks for the tip
---
Smoking+reading? multitasking is doing two tasks at once no? paying similar attention to two things?
---
Examples being drinking+reading, eating+watching videos and etc. Your problem seems to lie with the definition rather than the act. I'm not saying that you don't juggle different activities in your brain but to call multitasking(juggling multiple tasks) a myth is fucking retarded and to do it on a semantic point is pedantic.
---
Monster examine has all that and more.
---
If it’s afk stuff my phones getting hot in my pocket while I do shit around the house. If it’s semi-afk I’ll watch tv and click when I have to. 
---
It baffles me that you think there's honestly a 0% chance. Cynical much?
---
Sometimes I’ll sit right next to them on wave 1 just spam typing telling them to stop attacking and switch attack styles and they’ll just stand there still attacking losing the entire team points. People just don’t want to do any sort of learning before getting their fighter torso’s.
---
KempQ RWT’d his main got banned and he admitted to it. Comeon... Don’t try to play that card. 
---
Why the fuck is there a song in the background from Samson en Gert.
---
They’ve had a lot of time. Shits just hitting the fan now and there should have been preventive work WAY before things got this way. You would think they would have learned from the past. 
---
A simple restructure of planning and development procedures is not rocket science. 
---
The game can be fun and inefficient.
---
Yes it would.
---
&gt; basically the suggestion is to increase the slayer xp from 450 to 600
---
Should increase it to 650, not 600 because Sire has the 1.125 XP multiplier on him because of the stats
---
I didn't realize that you can't cast crumble undead on Vorkath. Justiciar already sucks so much and that just makes it way worse.
---
The issue is that the bank is pretty much at its limit. They’ve discussed it on stream multiple times. Adding more space makes it take longer to load which makes the bank react badly to items stored. 
---
Get rid of pointless quest items with the wise old man, build hidey holes for clue items, and put most/all seeds in the seed vault in the farming guild. Don’t store 1, 2, 3, and 4 doses of every potion you ever use. 
---
I have ~750 used spaces on my iron. Over 80 of that is incomplete sets from clue scrolls. Having over 816 is unnecessary with the amount of storage we get elsewhere. 
---
Why?
---
Can we buff unused weapons using this format? 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b37rs8/suggestion_rebalancing_bad_melee_weapons/
---
how much xp was it?
---
Agreed that the delay may safe a significant amount of account, however most newer players wont bother setting up their authenticator anyways untill they have been hacked 
---
it's obvious you're a fanboy and it's clouding your judgment
---
So you guys not have books? 
---
so better range legs than penace skirt for a solo minigame? nty
---
R u an autist
---
I agree, innocent untill proven guilty. 
---
Judging people by their percieved motives is always a bad idea, you can't read other people's minds. There could be a million reasons for walking around with 3 twisted bows, maybe he just wants to look at them, maybe he likes switching between them, heck maybe he took 'em out accidentally. 
---
This sub is so toxic for instantly jumping to the worst case scenario. Toxic and envious teenagers thinking it must be RWT because that's what *they* would do if they had 3 T-bows. And then attacking you with insults about your IQ for saying that maybe it wasn't RWT! Blegh. 
---
Can you remove the avernic defender from ToB and add it to warrior guild instead? Maybe a new solo only boss.
---
&gt;Exactly zero people will read this in its entirety.
---
I'M DUMB SO EVERYONE ELSE MUST BE, TOO.
---
Sorry dude, this is an information post. Either read the info or don't, you're not a child... probably. 
---
Eve comes to mind
---
Not until they want to get the skull sceptre! 
---
My point is that you wouldn't need a delay if 2fa was required to access your account settings. I mean really, what's the point of requiring 2fa when logging in the game but not on the site? How do you justify that?
---
Thanks for sharing, osrs is from 2007, not 2005

Sbeve
---
Well it's illegal to admit that its  known and not targeted cause of tax and age and labour laws. For legal reasons they could give no other answer. Their answer is consistent with their policy and rules and administration

I know p2p has peak hours and it's pretty fun. I'd imagine f2p requires clan/groups

The email authentication is separate from RuneScape. Unrelated. What he's saying is that to log in to the game, you need auth. To log in, on the same website, to disable security features, authentication is not required. This seems like it would be an easy, common sense fix 
---
Tbow thing or pure xp glitch?
---
almost like theyre doing it on purpose now
---
To all the sad people in this thread reeing about maybe rwt i just say: who the fuck cares.
---
Tbow
---
Whether you believe it IRL or not it has no place in Runescape lore.
---
I am adult and I see daily other adults say dumb shit. Honestly not suprised if 2% is close to truth
---
"Would not be used to make someone engage with something they haven't done in the past." 
---
This irks me about the rampant in-your-face treasure hunter promotions. You get these in your face popups on RS3 without having enguaged with MTX.
---
Idk why but I fucking love birdhouse runs 
---
It could though
---
This chest would be amazing for Swampletics
---
Hit up Draynor and chop some trees one time. Come on man you’re better than that

No need for another fictional god in game.

A few days ago when this was mentioned, it was supposedly fixed with an app update but even after updating the app it still happens to a ton of people
---
Did I saw it was from 2005?

Wait til it’s revealed he’s cheating on his gf (who are we kidding though) with hookers and leaving the swamp constantly

OCD maybe

Their names are in the pictures you dense cunt 😂

Good thing this one is real

availability of logs definitely isnt the bottleneck for shades of morton, it's getting sacred oil and shade remains

More accurate 'Lost on Death' interface

All i want is for the squirrel to return from the maze random

They could also add in Jesus, Buddah, and Abraham Lincoln. Doesn't mean they should.

OLD THING GOOD

NEW THING BAD
---
Nope
---
I would say more of an average ~ 60k and peaking in the high 70/80's. Though, they're gonna be low now alongside the rest of the seeds in the game (other than maybe magics etc) because of farming contracts etc
---
if he got a drop he'd post it on twitter (and show off his bows). 
---
its really not that unbelievable
---
Something I did that really helped was getting multiple ectophials after the quest was done. That way if I ever forget to refill it, I can just use one of my other ectophials for the next farm run, refilling both at the same time.

Got mine at 47 on my first maple tree

As far as I am aware it wont regen the HP at the same time as the normal 1 minute/1 HP regen possibly after 1 minute the cape is worn. So it regens at a different time.

Now thaaaat is a fashionscape

&gt; I really don’t think he Rwt’d
---
Sparc Mac did.
---
The fuck is this even about? The only server people might want is a pre-eoc server which is sometime in 2012 when there were &gt;100k players online.
---
Probably skewed by the fact that there are so few new players that aren't bots. I would say that WoW has similar numbers of long-time players to runescape but still has more accounts created recently
---
You just multiplied 1/17.4 with itself, but the rate changes with each item.
---
If the pic is even real is another discussion.
---
He didn't lose anything of value content wise. 
---
Maybe a week for rangers, double zenytes. Technically? 500 hours for another bow. However, Zulrah and Raids 1 are the only sustainable long term pvm content on a hcim so really, from a content perspective and a perspective of someone who likes raids1 it's not a big deal.
---
Yeah I went in knowing nothing, left a couple hours later with torso, which I had assumed would be harder to get.
---
imagine calling someone a child and frequenting /r/aww
---
he wasn't recovered, his paypal email (donations to him = can see it) was his hcims login email apparently.
---
Because he's further along in the elves questline than you.
---
I would FW this at vork.  Only need to eat around 30hp anyway during combat.  Might bring 5 or 6 of these. 
---
You can still burn stuff at 99 cook, my dude
---
if i hacked someones account i would 100% ruin their hcim status or get them def if they were a pure. anyone who says they wouldn't is lying

Then don't unlock everything. Not every cosmetic item needs to be easy to obtain.

I should do barrows just for the runes... getting to be expensive buying as many as I am currently.

Only took you a month to reply??

Gratz, nice balanced stats.
---
If you’re comparing Jagex to a beer company then surely you must realise that one is regulated by the government, the other is free to regulate themselves at will. It’s not really a fair comparison.

Budweiser cannot sell alcohol to children under any circumstances because regulation/law forbids it. No regulation or law forbids Jagex from advertising forms of gambling (spins/duel arena) to children. This normalises gambling to children, who are otherwise forbidden to gamble due to regulations/laws.
---
If they’re not allowed to gamble in a betting shop, why should they be allowed to bet in the duel arena, using a currency that inherently has a real life cash value? And Jagex themselves acknowledge gp has a cash value because you can purchase it through bonds. 
---
So how is buying bonds and going to the duel arena, losing and buying more bonds, not the same as going to the betting shop with a £10?
---
Sure, you can argue you can’t sell the winnings. But Sparc Mac bought his first car through selling his duel arena winnings, and iirc he was under the legal gambling age at the time.
---
Hell yeah, will do man!
---
So basically everything like the guy said... 
---
Here’s the motherfuckin tea 
---
Ah. I did not know that
---
ok good lol. I've never played rs3 so i just send them a message
---
Will you do another wave of resetting names of inactive accounts?
---
Nope. The correct calculation is `(1/102)^4 * (101/102)^2 * 15`, which is about 1/7,359,817. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution
---
Hmm, interesting. So you randomly come back after being banned the same day? Huh, interesting.... 
---
Why would you care? It's 2+ grand chilling in his bank with that has no purpose at all, let the man make some money.
---
I love the lottery aspect of it. Hopefully it'll be good for training and I'll be able to make some money. I don't like doing risky things. I'm not good at fighting and usually over prepare. 
---
they’re already trying, they ban all users that RWT on sight but they can’t really do more than that because theyre not law enforcement. They can’t ban users they suspect without proof because then they might get sued for wrongfully terminating people’s subscription services. Other than that, anyone getting caught doing RWT just gets banned so really not much else they can do.
---
y'all are really playing this game for 2.5 hours a day?
---
Just like I definitely "asked my parents permission" before visiting a website
---
I've often thought about this, it's such an obvious idea that there must be a good reason why it's not that way. 
---
For some reason reading the title I assumed the government was finally calling them to justice for fucking up DMM every time.
---
£45 btw
---
It covers more than verac's top. Plus, kreeara wears it as a crop top.
---
If I had abs, I would, but instead I decided to play this game 
---
&gt;dharok-pray melee-use mage
---
&gt;ahrim-pray mage-use range
---
&gt;karil-pray ranged-use mage
---
&gt;guthan-tank/use remaining pray-use mage
---
&gt;torag-tank-use mage
---
&gt;verac-tank-use mage
---
&gt;tunnel-melee to 88%
---
&gt;run to chest
---
&gt;tele to clan wars, use portal
---
&gt;tele back to barrows
---
EZ
---
Wouldn't be considered gambling though. Under the current definition you need to be able to win back something of monetary value for it to be considered gambling. Jagex and other games are hiding behind the fact that they don't allow you to cash out, thus nothing procured has monetary value.
---
note to fbi: this is for a video game
---
&gt;Very cognisant of addiction and we address. 0.05% referenced the word 'addiction' in correspondence to Jagex.
---
&gt; Do you reject that RS is addictive?
---
&gt; Neil - I reject that.
---
The word addiction may only be referenced 0.05% to Jagex but most people address Addition with the term Runescape not Jagex.
---
You're 100% not the same as everyone else
---
He got a twisted bow 4hrs before he got hacked. It was his 3rd.
---
I accept that - it’s a good point.
---
The extent of addiction and mental health just isn’t known yet. Jagex admitted it didn’t know the extent of the issue beyond correspondence from players referring to addiction. It could be huge.
---
It’s too important of an issue for the general well-being of the community to not be addressed.
---
We’ve stuck with RS for many years. The company should take responsibility for its users, especially if there’s MTX/addiction issues. Gambling sites are forced to offer self exclusion but Jagex doesn’t. If you are an addict - you can’t make choices like that. You’re addicted. 
---
&gt;Addiction to gaming, specifically runescape, was completely denied by Jagex. 
---
lmao if jagex honestly thinks this. Many people don't even play this game 'normally' anymore but more than 40h a week (which is basically a fulltime job) and some people even play 60-100 hours a week. Not being biased, because I'm a runescape addict myself and play like 60 hours a week, it's pathetic. I do have some months a year I quit and don't play at all though :p

How would motherload mine only hcim participate in polls then?

Thanks mate, cheers! Got some additional milestone points with your help. :-]
---
&gt;The MTX amounts people can spend (£5k/month cap)
---
O is there a cap? So if a rich saudi prince wants to buy $1m in TH keys, he simply can't? :O
---
That would be considered a habit not an addiction.
---
or even at the g.e

forgot to buy a bond on my alt and saw this when i was waiting for my friend to bring me a new one
---
For some reason I thought that leprechaun was the pet 😂 
---
RC is horrible.
---
Base 80! 
---
Whoa back up a bit, Jagex gave this response:
---
&gt;£45 a year average of regular users of the 2.5h a day people.
---
Which is INCREDIBLY confusing. Like that wording is so awkward it makes me think they're hiding something. The interviewer assumes it to mean:
---
&gt;The £45/year was an average across all players.
---
Which would imply there's 1.9m players, seems accurate but then they later mention that they have 1m players, which doesn't add up to their $84m revenue, did they just round down? I can't help but feel the original statement was masquerading some other facts.
---
&gt;Q:Why force log out at all?
---
&gt;A:Players should take a break.
---
BULL SHIT. We know it's because of engine limits that cause the game's performance to fuck up after too many hours and that's why RS3 doesn't have the logout timer. 
---
For anyone interested in the game's stats, information in this interview should not be considered reliable info, because it seems like Jagex is just cherrypicking responses that are really inconsistent (some data appears to be taken from RS3, some from OSRS, some from both games) and just fits their narrative.
---
Base 80 and still no pet. F you
---
Thank you for reading.
---
in my experience they're just not patient enough to reasonably expect anyone new to get good. i was getting flamed less than a second after the call changed multiple times so of course i'm just gonna leave and fuck everyone over
---
TBH I'm starting to get tired of "we're leaking" posts. Especially since they're pretty much identical.
---
Lol because they pay shit
---
I had that book waaaaaaay back. I think it was one of the books available in one of my schools books fairs. I remember it being pretty enjoyable, especially cause I played RS way more back then than I do now, but I don’t know if it still holds up or if it’s just nostalgia talking.
---
Regardless, I hope you enjoy it all the same!
---
Someone photoshop a pharaoh's scepter on this, I just got one :D
---
To be fair, I think Jagex said that like 2-3 years ago and since then osrs grew a lot and rs3 has lost players. 
---
There is no way you can get sub 30 on normal speedrun, but you could probably do it on TAS
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Yes lol I'm familiar with all of the methods
---
/r/theydidnotdothemath
---
He could have "done zulrah" with 1 bow is what I'm saying
---
You forgot to hide amount of runes in your pouch, say good bye to your account
---
Really? I haven’t played it. Jagex were adamant about that point so misleading maybe.
---
Right that's what I'm saying. If you lose your phone with authenticator, currently you can disable the auth with email access which means you don't lose your rs account if you lose your phone. 
---
As someone with 99 farming and no Groot, I concur, fuck this guy.
---
There goes your rng 
---
this is what happened to me except i was too scared to try to look for another team after, assuming the same thing would just happen again
---
Get the fuck outta here with this lmfaooo.
---
No the majority of the pvp scene does not use AHK, and its heavily frowned on. Ask any pker.
---
yes they should ban them, because ahk as it currently can exist is meta breaking. The meta being actually playing. Ban all cheaters.
---
Learn Zulrah if you haven't, a lot of fun although it can be pretty frustrating at first. Use the gp that you make to get buyables (83 construction is an absolute godsend.)  continue training slayer and doing your fruit trees for farm runs.
---
You have to use a bow. There are specific arrows you must use for each style.
---
It would be faster to get get base 70 attack and strength then switch to strength training to 99. Then hop back to attack. Then finally defense. The reasoning behind this is because up to a certain point, nmz monsters are weak defense and decent attack level isn’t exponential as compared to your max hit from 70 strength versus 99 strength. 
---
Using nmz as a base example just because obby set + zerk necklace is the fastest combat training method before having high enough stats to use dharoks. 
---
Damn nice have fun grinding :) 
---
"Accounts are secure and safe. People have freedom for how long, and how much they want to play."
---
lmao
---
Yelling REEEEEEEE at people who ~~take~~  walk by my rock crabs.
---
Ill give you 1/3.50
---
I mean Jagex had some shifty dodgy answers but the person or people asked some really retarded leading questions as well.
---
'Does it not concern you as a company you need to give out mental health advice?'(in regards to having mental health awareness events implying that they are causing mental health issues). Like fuck off mate what a bullshit question. It's like asking 'Does it not concern you as a company that you have to donate to cancer research every year!? You guys keep donating but there's still cancer aren't you concerned!!!!!'
---
&gt;*Are devs encouraged to monetise the game?*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;No but if players choose to, they can engage with content and go further they can buy items.
---
As someone who mainly plays RS3, I can confirm, this statement is bullshit.
---
(Assuming the statement is regarding mtx such as solomon's and TH)
---
They could leave it the way it is now but allow you to trade in logs to a NPC outside the arena that would stop you being damaged.
---
We need some kind of log sink in game and I would gladly 'pay' 500 or so maple/willow logs per game not to take any damage.
---
Or you can just drop trade them, it's by far the easiest way
---
tourney worlds would also probably help the pvp scene a lot as more people would be motivated to learn
---
No one wants a nanny state.
---
No one wants a generation of gaming / gambling addicts.
---
Have to strike a balance somewhere. The government ends up paying to support these people. The company makes all the profit from causing the problem.
---
 Because the point of removing the Authenticator is usually because you don’t have access to it.
---
Should I sell it or keep it?
---
You can do shit stuff like buy from ge and sell to shops at low lvl.
---
Or get magic up and do barrows.
---
Much appreciated ;)
---
It's not a blatant lie from a legal perspective. They are truly not a gambling company as there is no way to "cash out" *through* Jagex. This is how they get around gambling laws in Japan with Pachinko (people take their reward tokens and a 3rd party pays cash for them). 
---
Jagex is doing their due diligence in attempting to stop/ban rwting, and has been doing so for a long time (hence bonds being one way).
---
Granted, they should be more realistic and doing more with things that are in game gambling, but given the stage they're on, their responses (in regards to gambling) were relatively accurate. 
---
I personally would have liked some different answers, especially in their mental health awareness answers, but that component wasn't necessarily inaccurate.
---
To the sad person complaining in this thread about people reeing at 100% rwt I just say: who the fuck cares.
---
Nah, it's so easy to quit you can do it however many times you want. 
---
farming is by far the fastest skill per time actually spent on the skill, ignoring stuff like 1tick karams/darts for fletching.
---
The 2% makes me feel special
---
The £45/year was an average across all players. What is the average spend for paying players only?
---
No details to hand and not something we would disclose. 
---
[Challenged on that answer] Do you have that information? 
---
Yes but not comfortable sharing. Not public domain and is commercially sensitive.
---
[Damian Collins MP] Average daily user is £45/year MTX spend. That is 'commercially sensitive' too but you shared anyway. Why are you not able to answer the previous question?
---
There is a large difference between users and that particular number varies depending on the player.
---
This is the one that rubs me the wrong way I guess. Sounds like they are embarrassed of their worst case
---
Curious though, why did it go straight to your backpack? 
---
^🦀
---
I play both OSRS and WoW like you, I play WoW for a few months when a new expac comes out then when I quit I play OSRS lol. 
---
You're doing great, love your videos!
---
If you’re interesting in doing the diaries as well, I would check the required quests for diary completion. Knock out 2 reqs at once
---
I was complaining about this a ton and no one in my cc believed me. Thought it was just bad rng but it was so consistent. Every harvest was abysmal when the attas was planted, but right after it died it was normal rng again.
---
And I'm sitting here raging because the waves leading up to first Jad in the Inferno get me killed more often than Zuk itself.
---
Tits! I mean, nice!
---
A lot of pker targetting is by combat level/gear. Theyre going to targer a 90-100cmb with dhide much higher than say a 126 in similar gear just due to the ease to kill. It sucks but like the above guy said, stay below 30 and I tend to hug the wall part between/during kills so pkers will need to shuffle around it to get a tb. 
---
why r u on ancients?
---
you can't cash out within Jagex's own framework though, which is all they can control. rwt'ers get banned and they make new max combat accounts all the time or they just buy new accounts
---
Prioritize 83 construction over everything else, then rigour
---
Ok this is fucking quality meme'age. Rofl. I've never actually laughed out loud before at some RS related content but this was genius. 
---
I like Settled a little more now that he's a fellow #weebo 
---
I was hoping for some ZA WARUDOOO action, but hey it was quality stuff nonetheless. 
---
Click on the ads and buy whatever they're offering and then send it to this man

Laughs in asain mobile games
---
Ooooo look at fancy mr inferno man over here with his FANCY CAPE
---
Yeah it is. The players choose to play. Want to be competitive? Put in the time and effort? Want to bitch about it? Then don’t. 
---
fremmy hard, kandarin hard, western prov hard, mory hard, varrock med, karamja hard. got those?
---
it would still be dead content with added prayer bonus.
---
I don't think Defender should be changed at all because the BA communtity has the workings of the trap and runner AI down to a science. Collector could be made more useful and and the cannon interface could be made less clunky, however.
---
I vote Meiryerditch replaces fally and Prif as 95+ agility. I hate the fally course, the clickboxes suck and the mark rate feels so poor.
---
I quit the game several times daily, it can't be addictive!
---
and underestimating how stupid people will act when their actions can't affect them irl. 
---
Pity party to justify RWT lol...  But whatever, no point in arguing with someone who doesnt want to admit he's wrong.
---
I have no idea what the context is but that is the most annoying thing I've seen in a while
---
Government interest in 'addiction' and 'play times' is concerning; imagine if companies are obligated to enforce limits on players living in certain countries, you're locked out of your runescape/steam library after playing four hours in a day, 
---
Fake as hell itself go from left to right got 2 spaces empty and the chat box doesn’t say you got anything 1/5 for At least using photoshop

You've made my future eclectic grind so much better friend.

You're welcome!

If you rebound MSB1 to F2 wouldn’t that just be a single click? I thought that’s what he said in the video. I would link it but Idk how on mobile. 
---
How does double clicking reduce drag vs single clicking? 
---
so many job shortages
---
&gt; Just because something isn't designed to have monetary value in real life has nothing to do with the law.
---
That's just false. Following that logic, Neopets is a gambling platform. And here I thought gambling was heavily regulated but it turns out there are thousands of gambling sites that kids can join with no questions asked /s
---
The hunter vs rogue PVP metagame has been done to death, and they have acknowledged that it does relatively nothing to improve PvP.
---
&gt; i play runescape
---
&gt; that's something a runescape addict would do
---
interesting point
---
Right, exactly. Rebuilding legitimately is fine but buying gold through either rwt or bonds to gamble isn't
---
I dunno, your reasons are less likely than RWT, but you do you with your mental gymnastics.
---
h
---
Didn't even think about that, perfect!  Thankssss
---
Literally how
---
He must want to see a LOT of naked dudes, preach it from the rooftops brother! 
---
A runelite plugin for this would be amazing. Something like:
---
Plant something and afk there till a growth cycle passes, and let runelite do the tracking. 
---
I'd appreciate just a "Leap off cliff" option right at the beginning and take 50 damage to avoid that entire obstacle mess
---
Any ideas? I want to report bots but the option is gone. I've tried relogging and restarting RuneLite
---
This reminds me of a quote by Gabriel Morton of LDO fame 
---
"If I'm just reading a guide, and doing what it tells me, that's not me playing the game, it's the author using me as a vessel to play the game" 
---
Not really, that's how all esports work
---
They are asking everyone who will come before them. 
---
It is a key part of how the UK Parliament looks to enact change on key issues.
---
Hadn't even thought of that, gives me some guidance and should be good to do!  Thank you !
---
first step is to get 89 agility
---
Start the presses beginning of month drama let's goooo

Nobody said that. You just don't understand the difference between OSRS Bonds and RS3 microtransactions. I don't like Bonds but they're not nearly as bad as what RS3 has
---
In the sense that he's surprised by the following hes gained. Like he feels as if his channel has gotten bigger than he thinks it deserves.

Closed beta for Bannerlord is confirmed in case you didn't hear. The time is finally coming.

Yeah we were the ones who did this. You think it just happened on its own?

A person fucking up when being rushed to make sure they get the 3.6b off before the acct owner takes the account back is less likely? You’re talking about them risking a few bil to make sure they get a few mil. I promise you the hackers don’t give a fuck about 4m

Does anyone know how many subs he had before he started this series?

You forget that the item that is the hardest to get was also taken: the twisted bow. I think I believe him being hacked since the acc now has 0 tbows. If the hacker got only 1 or 2 I would be more likely to believe that he rwt:d

---
Are you sure you are on YouTube
---
For me it says the channel has no videos? And when I click through the video says it’s private?
---
I spent 6 minutes taking screenshots. There are like 3-4 different accounts that make these kinds of posts on the regular suggesting buffs and changes to certain items. They're all in a very similar/the same format, and the item prices spike each time.
---
They're awful, low effort, unbalanced suggestions. I thought the most recent post was weird, so I looked up the price graph, and a ton of the obby staves were bought a day before the post was made.
---
It's just annoying that these dumb suggestion posts get upvoted by noobs and they'll never make it into the game.
---
Lol buddy I literally just got hacked and all they had was my email. 
---
It's a video game company, like why are you asking game devs if their own product is addictive? Is gaming addictive? Maybe, but so is any other entertainment product. Is sitting on the couch and watching shitty TV shows for 6 hours on your off day addictive? There's no difference between spending your free time playing games and watching TV, at the end of the day, if you have nothing to do, you spend hours finding entertainment in some entertainment product.

Wow this was actually a really awesome reply. Thank you for taking the time to detail your thoughts. Having read that I think I'll be giving rs3 another shot as an Ironman. Seems like the content is much more engaging. 
---
That's odd. Have you tried another browser, or incognito/private browsing mode?

What sort of things have you been doing when you play?

Any way for us to shed some light to this committee about the "addiction" and "gambling" aspects jagex refused to answer?

There was an unlimited net drop that no one believes was in morytania before swampletics started so a jmod possibly put it there.
---
C H E S T B R A
---
I really can't believe that that figure is true. I mean, even regardless of "In game behavior"- you simply don't have mass video games with such a low ratio of players below 18. I mean I'm trying to think of games with a typically "older" playerbase like EVE: Online and Everquest and even those I can't imagine have less than 2% of players below age 18. 
---
Let me be the first too congratulate you my friend!

wel on mobile its kinda like this press a lot the npc xd. but weird flex still 
---
You can walk over the rubble in the south east corner
---
&gt; Sure, you can argue you can’t sell the winnings
---
It's the only argument needed. Likewise, many underage people drink beer frequently. Should Budweiser be held responsible for people breaking the law with their product?
---
This is the low effort content I come to this sub for
---
might as well raise to 94

Also if the average account is 8 years old that makes a lot more sense

Use MSBI. Better dps than rcb

You want 43 prayer for protect from melee

You don't need magic gear for barrows. Because the brothers (Except Ahrim) have very low magic level and defense bonus you can accurately hit as long as you're above -65 magic attack bonus. I use blessed d'hide.

I must be the only one who can’t stand that dude 🤦🏾‍♂️

Didn't get as many internet points as you were hoping for?
---
If you gonna bond it with irl gp, you can flip with those 6.5 m not much but it’s a start, try runes, materials, skilling stuff and fish.. either that or u can try crystal chest, idk if those are still good tho, I made a lot of bank that way tho

Wow I totally had no idea that was in game lmao 
---
Maybe you've been blocked? 🤣 
---
&gt; Jagex denied several times that runescape is addictive, rejecting the suggestion on many occasions
---
Also Jagex:
---
&gt; Average play time is 2.5h a day for those who play everyday.
---
&gt; Average player has played for 8 years.
---
Why would it matter
---
swamp-kun ❤️
---
Yes. If people want to spend that much money, that's their choice. Not everyone is a fragile skeleton of a person some are just rich people who want to support their game and buy all the latest stuff in the game they love. 
---
Only 3k people watch the livestream, mentioning how addicting and awful the game is during every stream then gives the wrong impression to media, new players and others. Do you see supercell / blizzard etc. Going on about addiction during their streams? Should they? Bluntly in my opinion, no. It's unnecessary and has no benefit. Jagex shouldn't be a mental health company that also makes a game.
---
Both RS and MTG tend to be referred to as "crack" by their communities. RS is pixel crack, MTG is cardboard crack.
---
Penny slots cheaper than drinking at the bar lmao 
---
For what reason
---
Thanks! I think most old school players would really enjoy rs3 if they gave it a chance. Especially in ironman mode.
---
Will it include propane and propane accessories ? 
---
Is this a Swampletics question
---
Word of advice from someone who is on the pet grind. Stay in the top right corner (where the people in void are) and wait for one of them to scroll, you will be getting 15 minute or less matches and eventually someone will invite you to the main clans. Also NEVER play with anyone in a runeplatebody, they will 100% be slow and leave the second they get points for torso

He was bringing all 3 twisted bows to raids on stream, knowing rocket it is definitely plausible that he'd bring them to zulrah too, if I got a 3rd tbow on an iron I'd like just having them in my inv to look at them, then again I know my account is fairly secure

you're awesome anyways :)

I'm so glad someone posted about this here lol that dude is so busted for rwt. Time to get the Jmod ban hammer.

When do you ever hear of a hacker going on a hcim and not making them lose the HC status.
---
Also, his story is just so stupid lol. "I was doing zulrah with 3 twisted bows". 
---
I was thinking about Jagex
---
I thought swapping was against the rules? Anyway wouldn't give an unfair advantage to people with lots of gold on the main game?

Shouldnt it say, Capture saradomin standard?

Thought it was range for hill giant and mage for moss giant?

Correct! Iron man mode came out Oct of 2014 and  g.e  Feb 2015. Most likely the g.e was a big project  and in development for a while so they released released iron man for those who wanted to earn their gear/ items. How much did g.e pass poll?
---
Ok but I don't think you can disprove their claim. Higher tier and more valuable "outfits" are generally more complex and fine-tuned. What required more creative input, Justiciar and ornament kits and high tier clue scroll rewards, or Wizard robes and Iron armor?
---
I can’t wrap my head around this. I don’t see how this is jagex’s fault at all. Couldn’t you get addicted to just about anything and spend that kind of money? Where do you draw the line between funding a hobby and addiction? People are unique and will enjoy/invest their time and money differently. Obviously these extreme cases of debt and addiction are far from healthy, but I find it strange how people expect jagex to o𝚏𝚏𝚎𝚛 such a level support and pro activism in combatting it.  
---
Are we able to change our plus 1 item? Or do we only get one time to choose an item.

yeah i think a better answer would have pertained to what you mentioned. thats simple demand pricing, which isnt illegal by any means for a company to partake in.

Yeah, it seems very handy if you actually do something non afk on mobile.

There have been countless other examples, like with seercull, granite maul, ahrim's staff, torag's hammers (over and over), and many others

It's not tinfoil hat stuff. Mods have come in and examined players accounts and they saw that the people who made a lot of these suggestions had tens of thousands of the items stocked up.

Nah d long was top tier

And people will gamble elsewhere if the Duel Arena were shut down, but it shouldn't be shut down. Sounds like you just want Jagex to remove free trade again

Does it matter which gang you join in shield of arrav? I saw a guide that said you have to join the Black Arms Gang, but the wiki says you have to kill the jailmaster.

You’re right. Not everyone who engages in buying gold is addicted so that was poorly worded by me.
---
Are we playing the same game? 
---
+Str is no/little affect on DPS, but +accuracy a significant DPS contributor? You've got it backwards. 
---
basically do a minute a day for 3 years and you'll get there :^)
---
Nah you’re good it just goes to show how much jagex ignores the pvp community. We’ve been complaining about this for idk 4 months now? It’s difficult to pk with teammates when you can’t identify who is on your side right away. But now that it’s affecting pvmers more and more maybe they’ll pay attention. 
---
I'm in the same exact boat haha. 65 rc, have only done a handful of rc runs. All exp is from genies, diary rewards, quests, and tog. The permanent ToG grind my only rc training from here on out.
---
Fuck off
---
Do what you want and don’t let fear of regret stop you from deironing. If you want another ironman then you can make one. Having a high level iron isn’t for me, journey of getting there is what I’m after.

I’m 17 and I’ve been playing since I was 8 or 9 lol

Oof. Im 900 kills on demonic gorillas and only gotten 2 light frames.
---
As a returning player with interest in DMM, I also have a few suggestions and parts of the torny I find interesting.  I personally watch sparc Mac, Alfie, ditter, and torvestas this time around and liked bits of each of their content.
---
1.  Don't flame me too hard, but clanmanmode is fine.  I think the people who want a "fair competitive mode" should just watch the PVP all stars, that's literally what it's for.  It's super interesting watching strategies unfold each tornament.  Being able to camp shilo village?  That's actually genius, same with ditter's clan camping tourist trap to let him get ancients first.  Next torny have that quest unlocked, and viola, new content because clans will have to figure out a new strategy to keep it fresh.  
---
Another thing I'd like to see is a clearer list of clans.  That adds teams you can root for instead of watching your favorite streamer get instakilled then stopping caring about the torny.
---
2.  Jagex should really add focus to the whole week, not the final hours.  Ditter made extremely good videos of his own personal progress this past week, but I'd like Jagex to take it a step further.  They should give out statistics, like top ten pkers, top ten skillers, how the final 4 from last tornament are progressing this tournament etc.
---
3.  Id want to see more item reveals.  If you get a VLS, it should have a game announcement similar to revs.  Put a Target on people's heads.  Maybe even a bounty board revealing the names of the most wealthy characters in the past hour or so.  
---
Idk.  Bottom line is, I'd love to follow DMM throughout the week from several people's views, how clan tactics are changing, who are the biggest threats, and who is grinding the most.
---
 Lmao welp gg account. Cant log in to remove authenticator because I lost my phone.

It’s bad if you don’t show up but there are no penalties beyond a small negative mention.

I'm at work can't watch, did you have kebos tasks competed. It gives 10% more runes and 5% to mine a second essence.

&gt; More needs to be done Jagex. Time to up your game. 
---
No. Just personal responsibility. The government and private enterprise should not be in the business of addressing this.
---
Do you think they should get involved in restricting violence in video games? 
---
Im wondering how they actually got that figure. Is it the average for active players? If so, what is an active player?

then ur best choice is chaos gauntlets + fire bolt like someone said below

So if it plugs itself then it have infinite energy?

Doubt it all you want, it's the truth. I don't normally record myself, so i don't have vids. If you were nice, maybe I'd go out of my way and hit up vork to get a vid for you. But you weren't, so I won't, and you'll have to take me at my word.
---
I can understand not using all your food in a trip. I regularly leave with a few bites of food left, but I still take the better food in case things don't go smoothly. Sometimes I lag. Sometimes I misclick. Sometimes vork just fucking wrecks me with basic attacks.
---
But none of this has anything to do with the comments that I made to OP, and at this point you just seem to want to be measuring dicks, so I'll take my leave.
---
That's fair to frown at them, but given the stage they're on and the legal ramifications for admitting your game contains gambling (when it legally doesn't) is unreasonable, especially when they try to curb rwt and have no options to cash out. Don't get me wrong; I hate staking and how it fuels a lot of rwting, but going on that platform and saying there's gambling is a lot different than them trying to solve this issue internally. 
---
They did recently say that they will make an official in-game clock so that people can avoid all the time zone stuff when setting up bossing and events. 
---
No thanks dead content should remain dead
---
Different guy but with a similar opinion:
---
A lot of it just doesn't feel like OSRS. There's a fair bit that does, but a lot does not. It feels like they made it big just because they could - if you play on the jagex client, there are several render-distance-length areas where there's nothing different from the last render-distance-length area. It has a weird sort of vibe because of that which I can't quite find a good way of explaining, but the best I can come up with is it feels like a safe version of the wilderness with less mobs and more grass.
---
 The art style just seems off - in both the physical appearance of the roads/buildings/continent itself and a lot of the gear from that expansion. It has a very RS3 vibe to it to me - almost a "cartoony" fantasy rather than a "dungeon" fantasy remake up my own terms.  
---
Overall, fine, but it's nothing that made me excited. Just more content in the way of I'm not exactly sure what to be honest. 
---
anyone wanna explain what any of this is? 
---
Thanks for the info I wanna know as much as possible before going into zuk.

Oof

Ideally block it.

Range with antifire shield/antifire pot. Use ruby/diamond enchanted bolts.

Perhaps a first phase in which you don't actually deal damage but can drain prayer?

Easy to fight + keys means they're great. Better off blocking suqahs or something.

You would have to remove the 50x xp gains after death. And even then it would be difficult to get anyone onboard to play. Sadly It is something I would like worked out, but it never will be something jagex will do. :(

Would it be possible to add more superior slayer monsters?

It would be pretty cool if you had a chance of spawning one the DKS doing a regular dagganoth task. Same could be said about the KQ.

 I think it would add some excitement to the late game slayer grind and I'm sure theres many tasks where you can implement a superior monster which is already in the game instead of making new ones.

as for zuk I'd suggest knowing how the entire fight goes and what to do when he enrages (after healers spawn). Be aware that the non-safe squares from the corner safespots to the middle safespots will drag you and kill you post enrage (zuk attacks quicker post enrage).

yeah so....to achieve a 56 hour week that means you need to play 8 hours a day, 7 days a week. and that's just ehp, which means that any time at all you spend banking, or any hour where you slack off slightly and get less than ehp, it won't even count as a full hour.
---
i'm not gonna tell you how to live your life, you're an adult, but IMO this isn't any way to live. if you have a full time job and get a reasonable amount of sleep that means literally the only thing you do when you're not at work or asleep is play rs during the week. that's insanity lol.

The highest strength bonus you can get from a top and bottom in melee is +6, a whip gives +82.

"They want them to be a special occasion thing, something that players can play every now and then and test ideas without detracting from the main-game. They don't want to impact real-game activities or PKing too."

Trident is definitely more expensive to keep up but the dps increase from Ibans staff makes it WAY better even at 75.

If you have the gold, upgrade asap, if you wanna be cheap about it then Ibans is totally fine.

This is about RS3, not OSRS.

don't go past 88%. After 88, bolt racks become a potential drop that can pop up in your chest. The thing is, bolt racks are kinda worthless. You get significantly more money from runes than you do from the bolt racks, especially if you've completed the morytania hard diaries.
---
So don't go for 100%, it's going to take you longer and make you less money

I love the idea of listing different clans honestly, maybe show the wealth of clans as well, and what players are affiliated with the clan. I kind of hated clanman mode, but if Jagex can embrace it and clean it up a bit I would be for it

How are Jagex benefiting if I may ask? Genuinely not aware of this, if they are indeed benefiting. 
---
I agree, the duel arena is one aspect of the game which can induce addictive behaviour but wouldn't you agree that there are other elements of the game which could be seen as similar to the duel arena? For example trading in wintertodt pieces for a drop-table roll, opening konars chest, literally every npc drop, etc.. 
---
Obviously these have less returns than the duel arena but they also have less risk. I'm not defending the duel arena as it very much is an example of actual gambling (and it doesn't make sense to remove other forms of gambling yet keep this in the game) however you're going about doing this all wrong. 
---
Parliament won't do anything about this. Mtx is another example of gambling yet it remains as one of the main sources of revenue for the company. 
---
Duel arena junkies are similar to actual gambling addicts as in, inherently they both display similar behavioural patterns. Sure, this is terrible (and probably not as bad as actually throwing away your life savings) but no one's stopping actual gambling addicts. No one's putting in legislations to stop the 40-year old gambling addict with a family from throwing away their son/daughters schooling fees (damn I got a bit too specific lol).
---
What I don't understand is the lack of awareness this receives. Not just in the game but in real life. These people are down right addicted and think that their big break is just around the corner and keep chasing the 'thrill'. I just hope that this kind of outlook changes, not because these people are almost helpless (and I guess that is a concern too) but because the casinos that profit from them are going to keep profiting from it and do everything in their power to stop anyone that could affect their total revenue.

dicing is a tiny portion compared to the arena, so get rid of the arena and youve done a massive step towards getting rid of gambling
---
theres no other way to gamble in game since they changed flowers ect in RS3 they could easily add all that stuff to OSRS then the gamblers have no leg to stand on
---
Unless someone goes out of their way to organize an event, no. It probably has something to do with the fact that even if 23 people somehow showed up at the same time to play, they still could start a game.
