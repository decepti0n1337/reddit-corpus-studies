Hard agree.
---
Idk, I got my quest cape before MM2, and the bar has risen quite a lot since May 2017 or whenever that was.
---
Wintertodt actually jump starts a lot of skills like farming herblore cooking and provides you with magic logs required for a few required quest.
---
Your first mistake is looking at ehp lol
---
Bring back funorb
---
honestly... where is the dye system at this point.

---
useless herbs and components? --&gt; dyes.
---
PKers as a whole are scoundrels, almost exclusively resorting to RWT, bots, and toolkits to aid them in the wilderness. This is a well-established fact, and for this reason, I think it's safe to say that all ironmen deserve to be banned.
---
Maxed poh means you don’t even need food.

When you need help, join the deliveritems cc and someone will most likely help

smh nice private server
---
Rod of Ivandis is pretty cool, same with Ivandis flail
---
yeah everyone just shouldn't take damage at all.
---
EngineWork™
---
The damage doesn't bother me.  Its the fact every time I do something the action stops and my actions keep getting chain canceled. :(   If they made it so you didn't take damage around the brazier, wouldn't it be fine?
---
That still seems enough time for funds to be in limbo. Regardless, take screenshots of your bank changes and contact jagex. If they don’t respond when they say they will file a report with your bank to get your money back.
---
Trade with group and likely be able to kill bosses together, rather than not being able to have any assistance on regular ironman.
---
But yes, that's the whole difference. Just like hardcore is just ironman but you can't die, and Ultimate is ironman but you can't bank.
---
It's for people like me that love the ironman mode but hate the idea of long lengthy shop based grinds and such and way less involvement with my friends and clan.
---
Before Group Ironman comes out are we gonna have a LFG where people can find like minded scapers to group with that have similar time constraints/commitment problems?
---
Will do, thank you
---
High performance mode on android
---
Wildly cuz fml
---
Yeah... the screenshot proves nothing.

Tekken 7 on PC is amazing for RuneScape. It's bugged out and weird and lets you do controller inputs even while your mouse is clicking on the RuneScape client. I play Tekken and when my opponent lands a combo on me I click on rs. Most other games require an alt tab to shift focus even in windowed mode, but something about that game is weird and perfect for multitasking. 
---
I'm general console games are nicer cus no alt tabbing. I have gotten a lot of milage out of turn based rpgs and Mario maker.
---
I'm gonna try this, thanks!
---
I’m pretty sure Elvarg is so strong that the dhcb doesn’t do extra damage against him

Probably in a small house between Galahad and Grandpa Jack.
---
By day I'd tend to McGrubor's woods, removing dead trees, planting new ones - managing the local fauna, would probably start a bee hive up that way and start making local mead to sell to Forester's Arms. The flavor would have a distinct difference to any mead produced near Catherby as the honey collected from the bee's would be collected from a different flora.
---
On the weekend's I'd probably head down and watch the fishing contest, pick up some local carp in exchange for mead for dinner that night. Could always head to Galahad's for a nice cup of tea.
---
Might even take up archery at the local guild, would really help hunting those foxes that break into McGrubor's - they really stir up the hounds.
---
\&gt;.&gt; ornament kit?
---
Too much danger will drive people away. Even with the 60 minute system, I'm still terrified of dying without something like what RS3 has for death.
---
Who dies at hespori
---
Deserved for using animation smoothing
---
Because, in 2019, it's a game of people who voluntarily chose a game based on 2007.  Most likely, this is not as important a feature to the OSRS community as it was to the 2008 community.  In 08, there might have been a risk of people leaving RS after thinking it felt outdated.  That is not a major concern for OSRS with the possible exception of mobile-users and RS3 refugees who get over the novelty.
---
Just cheat, use one click black jack.
---
No
---
I'm not disagreeing but it might be factoring the spec into the dps
---
I enjoy learning things like this, thanks for sharing
---
Neither is high level wintertodt lmao, what's your point?
---
And there it is.
---
Common courtesy
---
You don't have to remember the waves. If you know how to count in binary the waves work exactly like that (Except it counts from 0-2 instead of 0-1). 
---
Remembering the waves doesn't matter either unless you're doing some kind of challenge, the only really important ones you have to remember are when the Magers spawn, and when Jad spawns, and kinda when Rangers spawn. The waves last a while too so you can just have the wiki with the list of waves open to double check pretty easily.

Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real.

No, it's 1/1000.

Fuck it next update gives everyone 99fm
---
It was originally a toggle in 08.  You could still chose low detail graphics as I did given my ancient computer.  Even to this day, I believe, you can toggle off a lot of the HD features in RS3 like textures and lighting.  Albeit, last time I checked was about 3 years ago.
---
Most replies in this thread are atleast somewhat supportive of the theme of this post. It seems that the silent majority of people do not want to risk anything on death during pvm
---
Like the Lunar spellbook does.
---
yeah i fucked up
---
Even woodcutting my leg's still bouncing, so I'd prolly skew the data or something
---
The % of people who actually solve the puzzles themselves is so low that they probably make them long so it's not just a gimme after the first guide goes up
---
she*
---
I think another thing to consider is that if you're performing similar to or on par with their level, you've basically dedicated your life to mastering it anyway. In which case, you're probably naturally talented at it and not really all that different from them in the first place.
---
There are starving iron men in morytania
---
The crossbow probably shouldn't have been introduced at all.
---
I won't lie... This made me cry.

Idk to me, Minecraft and osrs gave off the same “vibe”
---
Yeah for sure :)

Guilty as charged, lmao.[](https://i.imgur.com/enoaMNt.png)

As an avid pvper, what noticeably messed up PvP was the new prayers. Augury and Rigour are so overpowered it’s upsetting. Someone in dhide snakeskin and a glory can hit higher and more accurate than someone in void using eagle eye. The powercreep fr range and mage prayers is unreal.
---
You're correct, but those were minor changes.  Lava is another example of something that changed even for low detail if I recall correctly.  This being said, people here seem to be mis-remembering and claiming that it was not a toggle at all in 08 and that low detail just stopped existing.  This is not true.
---
The recent buff made them not truly safespottable. But sitting behind the water or outside the door will allow you to range with protect mage on and take no damage. But you must use prayer.
---
How high should I get firemaking? Not planning to max it, just planning to get it to a point where I don't have to worry about it until I want to max it.
---
I'm thinking 66 for quest reqs, but not sure.
---
Umm... what about Free-2-players unlocking black weaponry at level 10, while members unlock white weaponry at the same level?!?
---
Yea I was meaning barbarian village fishing lol should have clarified better.
---
Looked up the quest that needs 66fm, it's Making Friends with My Arm which is definitely one of the more useful ones, but doesn't provide anything absolutely crucial like DS2 or something. 
---
66 won't take that long and 65 is needed for two diaries, might as well get it in case you decide to do that quest or get those diaries, won't take that long
---
Oh ok, then someone else might get more use out of it I’m a max combat main lol.
---
Recently it was discovered that Cerb's special attacks are on a cycle. She does the triple attack every 10 attacks, the ghosts every 7 attacks, and the lava every 5 attacks, provided that she is below the HP thresholds for the ghosts/lava. You can find a more detailed breakdown of her attack patterns [here](https://pastebin.com/hWCvantS). It's not necessary to memorize this when you're just learning cerb, but it's nice to know for the future
---
The looting bag suicide method is popular and is covered in Surg1n's video guide, but not many others as far as I know of. You just go into Cerb's lair and suicide with an inventory of supplies plus a looting bag of supplies, so you basically have 3 full inventories for your trip.
---
you're dead stupid
---
Ok, the first few waves (and a lot of the other ones) have bats, if they hit you, they drain 1 prayer, and should be high priority. Heres why the fight cave is ez. The cave resets. When the melee comes in, the first wave with him is just him. Then its him + 1 bat, then him + 2 bats, then him + 1 kek, so on and so forth.
---
Im not the commenter but what range should you be? Trying to get my cape and don't want to spend 1mil+ on supplies.
---
Negative exp lamps were suggested and possibly even polled I believe. But they weren't received well and failed the poll or were removed as a suggestion.
---
I'm SO happy for you! [Nice](https://i.imgur.com/qaWkwZ8.png) !

Already at 65, so may as well.

2.5 months deep into playing again. So much grinding... I often wonder why I’m doing this again...

Lmao alright bud

I assume there’s a safe spot? That’s prettt good
---
I’d even be ok with having a way to spend bonds on it.
---
Oh, hmm, didn't notice that. Yeah I typically average around 18-20 I think, and that was from before I unlocked Rigour, haven't really checked since then. Well that is a relief, even 40 hours worth of Vorkath for a single item is a pretty damn long time :/
---
Fashionscape is top-tier
---
I cant get over how bad this is... first, no veng, thats just stupid. Bring a rune pouch with high alch for longer trips. Second, u just tank the electricity when you can out walk it... i mean ur getting kills but its painful to watch u pvm
---
That and they provide interesting specials on the history channel.  I'm waiting for another boat to crash on the island off the coast of India (I believe that where it is) trying to observe the indigenous, only to be slaughtered.  Sad stuff.
---
You have to pray mage but you can stand outside the room to avoid the melee attack. I didn’t even bother avoiding the special attack either. Just keep auto retaliate on and your good!

Well hello there, Tim Allen biker boy. It seems you have unknowingly stumbled upon The Savage Prophecy, you little shat. Go to Youtube and type in "25 Buttholes" with the quickness or my savage goons will light you up. But first I need you to go down to your local liquor store and buy five packs of Newport Reds and a bottle of UV Blue. Pour the UV Blue and Newports into a blender. Blend them. Now drink the concoctiooooonnnnnn.

This is where you are wrong. You are ignorantly arrogant to think you are safe without using authentication on.

All it takes is for one website to leak your info. Hell sometimes you can Google site directories off of Google if you phrase your searches in a way you probably never heard of. You have to use a dynamic IP cause Google will block you after the first few times, but the directories give plain text info. Sometimes it's passwords, sometimes it's something unreadable you don't understand.

I believe in you. Checking back in next week.

Not worth ddosing someone if you dont gain anything from it. They would have to have the power to ddos an entire world offline which isnt worth it unless you can make some money from it  which the current system prevents.

not really, zulrah's one of the few where dying a ton while you're learning is common and pretty rare after you get the hang of it, vorkath's maybe another but that released with the grave price so everybody has had the same level of disadvantage there

---
I'm actually not 100% on if it's been polled. I've never actually seen it in a poll, and iirc there were very few changes/talk of changes from zulandra release up to the great 2016 Zulrah nerf. It's something Jmods have casually poked around on on reddit and QAs, so it's probably had a few straw polls that were smacked down into oblivion and then largely ignored. I'm sure you could find any history of this update suggestion along this subreddit, since everything gets transcripted in QAs and suggestions are frequent, but it'd be a lot of digging to find anything coherent.

People in this game are obsessed with only doing what the most efficient way is. You do you bb

It wouldn't take a month to learn how to basic brid for anyone who has been playing this game for any amount of time.  Most of the skills you need to learn are involved some what in PvM, you just do it more quickly in PvP.  Edge/GE pking are mostly not brid fights, learning on a lower level account means no brids, bridding is only done by high level pures and mains.  Even if you suck at bridding welfare bridding setups can run you as low as 200-300k.
---
You must be fun at parties

If you have 2FA on your email, Authenticator, bank pin, and you're at least somewhat confident your email isn't compromised, there's also the chance that someone who knows you well is secretly a subhuman creature that spends an unknown amount of time social engineering enough info out of you to gain access.

It was probably the same method where you snuck out the gorilla animation from ardy zoo. It was called animation stalling and you just spam clicked on anyone of your stats to bring up the menu. If you where pro you could sneak in a few clicks on the mini map, or type one handed while keepin this up.

It's a meme you can't actually be hacked that way.

If a 4m pipe is to pricey for you then caves might be off the cards in general. A failed attempt can cost multiple 100k depending on how far in you get.

---
This is a semi competitive game mode so I dont see many players sharing anything more than general tips, the point is to break the meta so that person who comes up with a new tactic benefits more from not sharing
---
Is it really worth 30 mil!?!?!!?
---
More effort than agility.
---
When did you start farming? Was this prior farming guild update? 
---
The shift in meta with Attas seed and more and more players having farming capes/high level diaries is bringing more herbs into the game than before. These metas make farming more profitable for the individual, but less profitable for everyone else. The more yield boosters get added into the game, the more of a requirement they become to profit.
---
It worked, ty!
---
Eventually.
---
Nah, can't do anything til maxed, that's when game starts
---
The same code could apply to iron men who drop items. It's literally the exact same "if iron man" statement.
---
u get double the compost
---
is this some kind of mating call
---
Train in NMZ at those stats. 
---
Range in NMZ too, don't know what you've started with but you can either use MSB(i), Bone xbow and bolts (I used this on the ironman it was super cheap!), Broad bolts with suitable xbow is also OK poverty-range exp.
---
The benefit of NMZ is that you'll get points which can buy herb boxes to subsidise your training and is much more AFK than crabs.
---
lol
---
How much would these cost?
---
Can we exchange wine for them 1:1? :P
---
Hell no. LMFAO
---
depends how familiar you are with the game, how much free time you have and what you consider quick. 
---
for an experienced player just rushing them, its probably about 40 hours from a new account, if youre less experienced, it could be hundreds of hours.
---
They make a good goal for new players, but they arent so critical that its a waste to do anything else without them.
---
We all just sound like autistic screeching anyway. Lol
---
With samsung Dex and desktop mode being more prevelent in phones that can display to a monitor, can we please get desktop for mobile?

Tribridding is way too hard for someone brand new to pvp. Gotta walk before you can run.
---
Started killing Cerberus tonight, the mechanics seem simple enough and I've gotten 20 kills without much trouble. A few questions:
---
Is there any way to keep her from doing the summoned spirits and the lava at the same time? I'm typically golden unless that happens, in which case I inevitably wind up taking a fuckin ton of damage from one of the two. 
---
Also, how many kills do people typically get per inventory? My first bunch of attempts I got 2 kills before I had to teleport out because I ran out of sharks, and I had one trip so far where I got 3 but only just barely. What number should I be shooting for? Using ranged with blowpipe+rune darts if that matters.
---
An obstacle to blue dragons that greatly reduces travel time.

When i first witnessed this live I thought it was works of the magic potatoe. But it was real. Anyone that says other wise just wasn't there.
---
hahaha I love that closeup of the imp being kicked omg.
---
To each their own. I'd just prefer more forgiving death mechanics outside of the wild akin to RS3's system: Everything's safe, pay a fee relative to the cost of the items to get 'em back. Would make me much more comfortable in branching out and trying more intense PvM than just some Slayer.
---
yep
---
Using my dhc on my alt for Dragon slayer was  probably the best feeling ive had from this game in 5ever
---
Waaay better with the spikes. The only thing I would say is over designed would be the mourning star. The scythe is probably my favorite idea from this lot, would give the ToB scythe a lower-tier counterpart and some precedence.
---
All good points but Jagex aren’t exactly failing considering a few days ago there was over 700 people on world 325.

Nope. We could have a riot in fally and they wont do shit. Can you imagine the chinese share holders trying to force their white euorpean developers to start coming down on their perdominetly white euorpean player base? 
---
That's just bad buisness. Blizzard is different, and activision blizzard also has the means to control the narative in other parts of the world where the player base consumes more of the tencent, leage, and hearthstone type games. Fucking all the number one played mobas are almost exclusively big in asia, and Tencent owns all of them.  Tencent is a 5% share holder in blizzard.

Two different markets completely. Osrs is a niche market.

Thanks for your reply!

at this point you might as well be able to since there's so many fucking versions
---
As in perhaps using the skill of RuneCraft to draw a rune or use an altar with a rune on a thing and via this magical and/or runecraft-ian ritual IMBUE the object in question, whether a piece of essence into a rune or an otherwise inanimate object like a piece of cloth into wizard clothing *or tephra into a demon slaying rock as is a new method that has taken well at ZALCANO and really just an example of using RC to imbue things other than runes*. 
---
*Et voila* the mage armour crafting hole is patched up with another way to train RC that doesn't need to be OP but could add some variety or purpose to the otherwise stagnant skill(s). Much the same way we already imbue boots or craft salad robes but applied to the classic armours like skeletal/splitbark/basic wizards' robes so f2p/IM + low/mid levels have some access to magic gear and pkers can flood their rag sets and let the spice flow.
---
The skill is called RUNECRAFT. Implying crafting with the use of magical energy produced from runes: The mysterious and magical symbols that appear on the altars and powered by the magical essence that has been chipped/veered off the larger section of charge-able rock dug into gielinor and contained/copied/transferred into/onto magically stable/inanimate objects that we all learned about harvesting from "clean" parts of this rock in the starter quests: dubbed rune essence, and even has a purer version known as pure essence suggesting the rock doesn't need to be 100% pure, unless for some more intricate versions of runic energy with the f2p/membs split breaking the fourth wall as a good example for varying levels of magic. Xerician's salad robes existence is a good example of low quality cloth already imbued to be spun into armour by the time you get it, reckon one could use essence and dye on normie clothes to enchant them, maybe some multicolored wizzy fashionscape bonus.
---
There's already plenty of instances and examples of using the skill in ways other than crafting runes such as Imbuing BIS boots, but if applying this treatment doesn't oldschool vibe with the playerbase then crafting and enchanting clothes with a magic spell akin to enchant bolts or ritual at a wizard guild or tower if not an RC altar: could be an alternative if only to give them some skill synergy and or use to an otherwise simple skill in patching up a missing crafting (magic gear) function with equal or less than current meta rates depending on Tiers.
---
Much like OP stated, warding was an overstep in the right direction and not every content idea needs to be scrapped, just the redundancies/non OS extras which IMHO were the extra sets of gear, the extra skill itself, battlepets, and maybe the wardstones seen as one could just use an RC altar or spell but maybe that'd be part of the ritual/component for a spell.
---
Don't see who you're saying to calm to but yes to the historical context and runes carved into stuff more than rocks is a thing.
---
This but the skill Runecraft is just fine a name because crafting/collecting things and imbuing with runic energy/crystals is already canon. Don't need to switch sweet F all. Could forego RC all together and just craft and magically enchant robes with a spell similar to an enchant bolt spell seen as we can already spin magic xerician fabric into salad robes. Pretty well just need to be able to enchant/imbue/slap magic energy into normie robes and splitbark which could introduce a couple new farming methods for noobs.

Freedom for gamers or something

Woox merely adopted runescape. Mat k was born in it, molded by it
---
So im actually not against the gravestone/buy items back mechanic. If they don't want the old mech id be very excited if that were implemented. The current system is too safe, there should be some risk involved
---
The coif tho

we need different lms leagues like 1def pures, zerkers and max bridders

I've played for years, and years. Years. And have almost Zero interest in pvp, sadly, due to the relatively high cost and ridiculously high learning curve. 3-ticking barbarian fishing? Sure I'll give that a go. Splat stacking or die? ..not that appealing.
---
imagine bitching about having to grind when this game is literally nothing but grinding
---
Let's look at the average experience a noob has when he goes PKing:  
---
Noob goes into wild. Stands around trying to size up the 40 accounts on his screen while someone drinks a range pot and suddenly - dbow rush, he's dead. Fun time.  
---
Noob goes into wild with his second set of gear. Gets in a fight versus a pure account. Fights the pure account, let's say an obby mauler. Usually, the pure runs away after he's out of food while calling you a pussy for doing the same thing, but this time, miraculously, Noob beats obby mauler. Noob then realizes obby mauler was wearing about 5k worth of gear + supplies and he's kind of feeling like he wasted his time.  
---
Noob collects the leftover supplies and is hit by a dclaw rush while he's low on food. Is told to sit.  
---
Noob strikes out a third time and is skull tricked, a fourth time and is rushed again, etc etc. He ends up leaving, fleeced of his cash if he's lucky or of his most powerful weapon if he's not.
---
What does it feel like? You got robbed by a bunch of scummy people trying to make a quick buck, and that's before you consider the math of the kind of builds you face in PvP and how little they risk for big hits vs how much the "average" noob is going to bring to the wild. Why would anyone want to join?

You put an impressive amount of work into this post, for how shitty the idea is. Bravo sir.

W H E N will we get a randomize/playlist function on the ingame music player

W H E N, I say
---
I'm looking at you Runefest co-presenter lady
---
Yea and without 99 firemaking shouldn’t even think about it smh...
---
sounds like a M&amp;S advert
---
But...you did chose to limit yourself? And why should they make everything so it shits tons of resources just because ironfaggies like you don't play normal acc so you can brag about your dumb status which is means less and less with every iron catered update
---
you do if you use entity hider on Runelite.

5. I'm just abd at it I dunno why but I tend to choke in pvp scenarios. For boss fights all good, or for pvp in other games but some kind of barrier for me in osrs
---
It's different mechanics.
---
You can tell what a boss will do eventually while pvm you need to predict.
---
It's a high learning curve and definitely harder given most are experienced and long standing in it.
---
I know the feels I suck at PvP lol
---
Fair enough.
---
On normal gauntlet, 9:30 is plenty of enough time to get t2 armor and 2 t3 weapons, even if you get unlucky with your first rooms, it's just a matter of proper routing and monitoring resources, i think all you need is practice.
---
For consistent corrupted gauntlets, the meta is t1 armor and two t3 weapons and can be acquired very consistently, the bigger challenge is actually making as few mistakes as you can on the boss.
---
I think you just need to watch a guide and practice, took me a lot of deaths to be able to do corrupted consistently.
---
Support
---
I tried playing lms to learn a week ago and I got a bunch of "u ok?" And "sit f******" and various other things... I guess you could say the community is what drives me away, as well as the skill gap. I had some dude running around the entire time during a fight and would freeze me and use doors to do some weird shit idk what the hell was happening, this was in a casual game too. The skill gap between good pkers and new ones is big and demotivating, and the toxicity throw at bad players doesn't help.
---
Botting
---
&gt;if you compare the cost to cakes which is what the meta for any new account
---
Yes but new accounts also get shit rewards so it's balanced.
---
I just got one today too!
---
Quick Chat when
---
Pvp has always has shit talking, can understand though.
---
And yeah given the small size you'll find people doing weird shit.
---
And there's always someone better.
---
- Is there a role related reason there are no horses?
---
- Can you add poll adding horses
---
- Can you poll being able to sit on every bench/chair etc. in the game?
---
Struggling on pirates treasure and call the game trash? Time for some retrospection there I feel
---
My biggest issue with the current death mechanics isn't that no risk is involved. It's that people can literally cheese pvm encounters with it. Fill a looting bag with food/brews/potions, and a full inv of more food. Go suicide in a noninstanced boss and go gear up. More than triples your supplies for the trip. Which is fucking dumb and should be looked at. Send that stuff to the bank or pick it up in unusable notes or something.
---
You mean the fact that taking damage interrupts all actions except cutting roots for no clear reason?
---
How do you use pool for Wintertodt with no food? Do you TP out mid fight then come back in?
---
Turn off the chat when playing. It helped me focus more on what's actually happening. As far as people roaming around, practice switching prayers and countering their attacks.
---
Why would the variants be different thought?
---
Last track of the music list - Zombiism :)
---
Because pkers can rot in hell
---
when u hide chat, because u bought ur own onxys.
---
technically no, you get a role each essence you craft.

Nope, it's entirely satire.
---
Yes

---
so which one of these are you?, great, ultra, or master tier?
---
fair enough. im just trying to say that i dont think you have much to worry about. i think youre limiting yourself for no rational reason.
---
The extra points go toward a [scaling chance at another loot roll in the same casket](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Supply_crate). So the points aren't currently wasted.
---
If they were, and you could exchange them for food usable inside Wintertodt, the game would be literally free.
---
What a humble coif :)
---
If we're going in the order shown on the image... Right now I am a master virgin...
---
Brutal black dragons, abyssal Sire, Hobgoblins.
---
well Im a great virgin lol
---
Lmao
---
Why wouldn’t they just be able to trade..
---
and can only be consumed while in wintertodt
---
Wow, so much bitterness. Who hurt you?
---
I think the problem with Wintertodt, as the mods also mentioned on the stream, isn't that it's hard at higher hp levels. It's that it's so much easier at low hp levels, which kinda forces any account to start at Wintertodt instead of starting with what they actually enjoy, for the sake of efficiency. Punishing players this hard for not doing grinds in a certain order takes away freedom of choice from the game, which is a problem.
---
I'm just dumb and paranoid. Bad experiences back when I played in '05 don't bode well for my psyche playing a functionally similar game in '19. It's kinda like hearing the ice barrage sound effect randomly. You aren't in danger, but the sound still gives you the heebie-jeebies, y'know?
---
go play lms get a grasp of pking then move on to wildy or pvp
---
I did birdhouses and then when I could catch nature imps I got the magic logs from there. Good route if you hate todt and can log in for birdhouses. Very afk.
---
Ok this might be the only way to prefer S.o.a.D to Joy Division

---
Tele out after each round.
---
With 99hp (and also maybe a Regen brace) you don't have to drink wine too often, you just poh pool each round to heal up.
---
todt rewards become less impactful to your progress the higher level you are. xp til next level increases, xp per resource item is static. missing out on these items early on means not only more time spent training gatherers, but also more time training buyables, since you didnt start with bonus xp banked in herbs, seeds, fish, logs, gems, ores
---
you also may get an early d axe
---
Well you predicted correctly!
---
Increase passive health restore at todt based on max hp level as well. Currently a 10 hp account restores 10% of their health every minute, while a 99 hp account would restore ~1%. Probably contributes quite a bit to the difficulty difference.
---
For sure, the MM2 boss is easy as anything if you abuse the dark bow strafing and DS2 is more about learning mechanics and good clicks than stats. Good luck man!
---
And it's locked behind a diary, too! Full support
---
Yep, especially with 99 cooking.
---
Nah I'm all seriousness, mm2 bosses are pretty much safespotable. And all you need it's a bit of luck on Ds2. I did it with similar stats
---
10th post of this I see, why is’nt jagex looking into it?
---
What did you call my sister?
---
Nope still too easy, Yo jagex nerf the jaw drop rate pls
---
5. It doesn't seem fun. I don't see a point in pking
---
Thanks man, appreciate the response. I'm more worried about DS2 but I'm gonna get them done if it kills me!
---
Thanks man, that gives me hope!
---
Not what i said but ok.. also you realise if no one used those slurs they would hold more weight making them worse. Its pvp, people are anonymous and face no consequences  for their actions. I see no need for dropping racist stuff but i will say "sit" and "youre trash" to wind you up.
---
Why on God’s green simulated earth would you not have that orange shield given to you by the duke? I can’t imagine how someone would survive this quest when they make mistakes like that before even getting on the island where that devastating fucker lives. Come on man.

yep, my repost from 11months ago, good job detective

Yes.

It’s possible to have too many cosmetics, it confuses newer players and can look cluttered, this happened with Team Fortress 2, I dunno what the items in that game mean anymore

I highly doubt it.

No they won't be added to the collection log

Yo my dumbass did not know about this mechanic. I thought these bones were to be used in construction to actually make house objects. I always assumed it was dungeon stuff that I never have used before.

Or you could, you know, read the [official newspost](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a-message-about-unofficial-clients?oldschool=1) that been out for over two weeks.

The guy legit said "to each his own" just above, he didn't actively try to tell OP hr's playing the game wrong, and only brought it up when OP explained his reasoning.
---
I guess you're being sarcastic..?
---
How the hell is giving ironmen a visually unique cape when they have fucking maxed making the game easier for them?

I'd vote yes just so that everyone can have a humid room rather than just me

If you quit why are you still here cuckman mode. &gt;Plays self sufficient account &gt; thinks they are entitled to special rewards because of it

agreed. These stats and OP's lack of game knowledge scream bought account. How someone could have the hardest 99 and the most expensive 99 and still have no clue how to make money makes zero sense.

Must be sweating quite a bit over there.

&gt; I'm complaining about the fact that ironman do impact the game on a way it shouldn't. Updates are being made with them in mind yet they made the choice to restrict themselfs 
---
They should not release a game mode if they do not plan to support it. Adding small cosmetics or small changes to help keep people interested are never a bad thing. No “negative impact” has happened from ironman being introduced. 
---
If you look at Settled or any top OSRS streamer what do, they all have in common? They play ironman accounts. Why do you think this is? If these streamers had no additional challenge after maxing, they would eventually switch games. Ironman mode is one of the only things that makes people actually watch runescape steamers. Truthfully any mode they add (even the newest one) are just new modes with restrictions like deadman to help capture the spark of challenge people want in the game.
---
Warding made it to private servers?

Just did it to see what happens and I advise against it! Lol lagged out my game trying to delete it

‘05 I worked for weeks at shades of Morton for fine cloth to get full splitbark armor. A guy offered to trade me a rare omni-talisman for my whole set I spent hours getting. Omni-talisman not as good as promised...
---
What's the problem? We knew what we were getting into, we simply got outsmarted. We actually thought that we were the sharks. We could have escape so many times, but greed got the best of us.

Yes, let's remove the options that give max cape utility and add more with pretty colors. brilliant.
---
I don't play an ironman and I would be fine with seeing these added to the game, but the comment about fire/inf./ava max capes making no sense is what makes no sense.
---
If doing pvp against primarily 70 defense pures, is the dds as a spec weapon still viable or is it too inaccurate? Otherwise, would a zgs be more worth it (as I can’t really afford an ags)

It’s not a meme dude lol the second most voted option on the last wuestion of the recent PvP poll was “I don’t like PvP”. If it was a meme and a nonissue it’d be the third or last one. People genuinely hate PvP and PKers and this straw man of the pking community being wholly toxic is just as retarded as those brainlet memes that the reddit community loves. I’m not the professor of comedy but it’s the same joke that apparently never gets old for people who hate pvp. 
---
What it simply comes down to is people are entitled and don’t expect to die in the wild. They die, get mad, and vent here. They breed this hateful attitude that divides the community more than a handful of PKers saying sit or cya. PKers being toxic doesn’t divide the community as much as one part of the community actually helping to deny the other part content. Because at the end of the day 70 percent of PvP encounters aren’t toxic, and you’d know that if you didn’t use one or two examples of you dying as evidence the whole community was bad.
---
I think that if jagex moved that cap to 1b they would also be adding everyone past 200m to a suicide watch list, or reporting them to the FBI or something
---
I think that was all over the forums too.
---
It's not craziest but definitely my favorite. I'm out doing a master near the level 50 obelisk in blessed d'hide and a blowpipe. Some ultra chad level 103 tried barraging me with the quickness but he splashes like a Magikarp, it's starting to become obvious he doesn't pk much. My prayer flicks are horrendous but somehow his switches are even slower.  He chases me back to the obelisk and we tele down to 13 wilderness, at which point I double blowpipe spec to skull and he goes down lmao.
---
Who's doing this?
---
Neither the OP nor the person you replied to is doing this or having it done to them.
---
OP said they didn't like a task, someone asked why. I think you're taking something personally here.
---
Gold farmers aren’t the only concern. The hues tend to ruin games and take them over with time. No single person in this game would ever be able to use a female character again. Anything green and yellow would skyrocket in price. 99% of your game chat would become Portuguese.

It was a video about the dice botters hiring pmods to mute other dice bots/ the account selling scene and how much it costs to buy pmod accounts for that purpose. Cant remember who it was by but it was a video mainly about the dice bots

Oooooo, that makes sense. How scandalous! Thanks for the info! It’s been killing me not knowing. I wonder why it was deleted then

When I was 12 in 6th grade, my IRL school friends did this to me sorta.

I wish he would take his cock out of his ass but hey ho
---
That would be a cool idea but maybe place them in banks like poll boths? And maybe have requirements to unlock each one ? Like a certain level in a certain skill or completion of a certain quest or achievement diary ?
---
Then there should be:
---
- Firecape max cape
---
- Ironman firecape max cape
---
- HCIM firecape max cape
---
- UIM firecape max cape
---
- Infernal max cape
---
- Ironman infernal max cape
---
- HCIM infernal max cape
---
- UIM infernal max cape
---
- Ava's max cape
---
- Ironman Ava's max cape
---
- HCIM Ava's max cape
---
- UIM Ava's max cape
---
At a complete guess id say maybe that a lot of sharks coming into the game are from bot farms and that perhaps a lot got banned recently? As opposed to the cooking of them which is perhaps primarily real people, hence the sudden price change.
---
Not that cold here in the Republic of Finland tbh.

I hope you realize, you're coming off as the snowflake in all this. Brand new to this thread. Just now hopping in. As I'm reading through it, you come off as a petulant, tantrum throwing child. And I'm sure I'm not the only one you come off to as such.
---
RS3 does have something similar. Time doesn’t pass but you can manually set time of day and lighting.

You're gonna need ovls and pack yak atleast, with those you might be able to do it without turmoil and SS but i'm not sure.

Tried to play the video through his twitter and got this:

This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Super Freak.

Pleeeeease someone say this isn't true
---
Rest In Peace old guy from pawn stars &lt;3
---
Rule of thumb. If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. If it isn’t just flat out someone giving you gp or something then it isn’t worth the time. Anyone spamming something at the ge is never legit. Whether they’re telling you to go to a website, gamble, or do a favor and they’ll “double your bank”.
---
I remember paying 100k for a black helm (h) once because I had never seen one and I panicked that I'd never see one again.
---
Nope, once you pay you can just talk to her to change it back if you set it to somewhere else
---
They actually used the possessive pronoun ‘their’ to give context it is indeed their baby. You’re reading too deep into it.
---
Very possible. Definitely thought it was bigger though. Guess I just need to take no profit which isn't a huge deal
---
considering the players who max an ironman account (of any kind) spent thousands of hours of time and dedication on earning the levels for these capes, yes. why not? There are multiple ways to go about this. removing the cosmetic change associated with these iron variants would be a fine option - most people who get the iron variants wouldnt want the color to be changed to ava's, fire, infernal, etc anyway.
---
Better than the original

Ouch, Russia sold you hard on that huh?

Autumn Voyage is my goto.
---
You might see that there is nothing special about those random numbers and they are annoying as you say. but if you look in depth of the game mechanics you can see that you boost from a specific levels to do a quest or or to do achievement on diary, Thieving as a skill if you trained it you will see that every level make difference the same as combat skills and other skills like Agility.
---
Gonna need to get that woodcutting up

Thanks for explaining this in a way I understand

Make it shorter, name it “the”

I mean, i know some people that only do pking content. They cant pvm to save their life, im sure a large portion of the pvm community is far more skilled in pvp with zero exp than many of the bad pkers that hunt pvmers, or are meat shields in open clans etc. 
---
Anyone with like 80 range can join an open rev clan and just bolt people, can then learn to tank, pray, switch etc. Or stay a noob and keep bolting people forever. As i pker i did a weekend of wildy slayer recently and i killed so many pkers and made soo many more leave me alone. Some knew how what to do but some were just stupid and made every mistake possible.

Right in the feels man. Someone told me it was a member's only item and I blew somewhere around 200-500k.

I cheesed it with mage only for the diary kill. I picked a rotation and memorized it then reset until I got that rotation. Had to tele out the first attempt, got the kill on the second attempt.

Thanks, been werkin on it ;)

It doesn't matter what the pay is, that's my point. Even people who have worked on runescape outside the engine for over a decade don't touch it. Mod ash for example. Incredible dev, been with osrs for 15+ years, literally incapable of editing the engine. 
---
Is that his fault? No. That's just how it is. There are about 3 people alive that can edit the engine, full stop. That's just the way it is going to be until this game dies, nobody else is suitable.
---
We dont need these...

Geomancy skill. Composting the cactus patch doesn't increase yield but does cause it to not die so you should do it.

Yeah, you get to know the baits by names after a while. Or by simply fighting them, you can figure out pretty quickly if they are baiting.
---
dank, i look forward to hating this skill, thanks.
---
The whole point was to find a f2p way to find decent money as a way of setting a new goal. I know I could just buy membership but that’s not as fun
---
If you die at a place with a reclaim fee, you can pay with the money you'll be reclaiming if there is enough in there. He didn't have to go get more money cause he had 1.9m in his inventory.
---
It did confuse me on my first read through, I couldn't tell what was happening until I reached the next panel.
---
I just did mine last week - and what I found was that on most waves when you get "set up" you are pretty safe and have time while you kill the mobs for that wave.  This gave me more than enough time to look up the next wave and gameplan with the wiki open.
---
It was actually pretty relaxed for the most part.  Of the 63 waves I would say there are like 5 that are stressful, and those are fine after you get 1-2 mobs down.
---
Where did you find this list? I'd like to see it
---
\+1 refers to what you would keep with protect item on, aka your special weapon most of the time (ex. claws or AGS). Therefore if you smite them then they lose protect item and therefore you get their +1.
---
just do/practice green&gt;green aka charlie aka 3rd rotation it has 10 rotations 
---
which 6 out 10 are green that you mage 1 melee that u mage 3 blue that u can either hide or range on 
---
but best bet is to focus on mage only much easier and cut down on switches if u plan to range
---

In RS3, we have them in Varrock, Prif, and Menaphos. It’s super nice. I’m surprised they didn’t put them in OSRS Prif, honestly.

Already giving your child 2nd to best in slot boots? Damn, you must trust him a lot.

I understand what your saying dude. I had hundreds of millions. I ended up saving some afterwards(not much) and bought some membership items with the gold which I can’t sell now. I already joined back a few times with whatever gold I could collect for a membership bond but didn’t end up playing enough to keep earning. That’s why I’m refusing to just buy a bond and finding a way to force myself to earn it in f2p as a goal so I continue playing. I don’t want to simply rc double nats or whatever for money. I’m trying to find more inspiration to keep playing this way

Alright. Settle down.

I'm really glad you used "they" as a pronoun to describe OP otherwise people might assume OP identifies as a male/female/ironman/kalaphite. This is how positive change happens, by small considerate actions.

Ilfeen: Hey ya, you're the human that helped my friend Islwyn, aren't you? He told me that he'd given you some crystal equipment.
---
Player: That's right, why?
---
Ilfeen: When it reverts to seed, bring it to me and I'll chant it for you.
---
Player: It just happens I have a seed here, what can you do with it?
---
Ilfeen: I can only make shields and bows. I've been trying halberds but so far only Islwyn has succeeded.
---
Player: How much for a shield?
---
Ilfeen: As this is the first one I've made for you it will be 750,000 coins. The cost should get cheaper as I get to know your resonance.
---
Player: I'll take it.
---
Ilfeen hands you a crystal shield.

Thanks for letting me knoe, another thing i gotta work on ;). Learn something everyday

You can do quests and lamps to level up RC easily (unless you are ironman and want to put them into herblore).
---
I haven't done much of any RC (maybe 1 hour total) and am almost level 57.
---
Damn. That is really disappointing. At least it hasn't happened to me while training prayer at the chaos altar :). Now I know to never risk anything while playing on my mac side. I guess it's back to windows.
---
Heard of anyone getting banned for it?
---
Adele sure has seen better days.
---
at 99hp you should be soloing it. Get WT down to 10% maybe on a different account and then just sit at one brazier and get points and xp.
---
Ds2 is very fun and easy! Use ruby bolts on the last boss and get lucky!

I love you

I was able to make the money you’d spend on this quest in a few minutes as an ironman in RuneScape Classic. You’ll be fine.

Remember, put the rum in. Put bananas in. Talk to the dude with the monkey so it’s actually sent to Port Sarim, and it’ll even pay for the last trip back.

I've never been a helmet on RS3, but I'm loving it in OSRS. It's actually a lot easier if you use a combination of mobile and PC play time. I use my phone for AFK tasks while I'm doing other things (like working) and my PC for questing + things that require more attention. Also once set up, daily tasks only take a few minutes, so you won't have any issues there.
---
This is discussed like daily, try using the search function

Link?
---
So now that we have this info, how hard would it be to build a "profit per kill" calculator like what we see at demonic gorillas page?
---
Would it be hard to make a "template" we can plop in any page that we can just feed all that previously listed info into and it'll calculate it automatically?
---

Zulrah drops 200 laws at a time and it's pretty common. I haven't had to buy laws in a long time.
---
I remember when newspapers came out I would sell them for 50-100k a pop.. Nobody had paid attention to such a small update, so they believed me when I said they were super rare.   
---
Got banned tho and cried for a full day. :(
---
Sounds more like Gein.
---
Lol what. They literally announced clan system rework, just wait !
---
The elder chaos druid can roll BOTH the gem drop table and rare drop table. To get the mentioned items from the gem drop table does indeed require the quest, but can be received from the rare drop table without it.
---
It's an app that forces the game to run on portrait instead of landscape. I've found it's great for agility and mlm, there's probably other activities that can be done. Only downside is bank and tabs get pretty small but could be fixed if they made the tabs/bank expandable.
---
Oh that's what's going on here lol. Thanks!
---
Yeah someone has mentioned this, sorry. Just wanted to get a discussion going about peoples opinions.
---
Think before you speak. There are 3,168 Ironman accounts with substantial post-99 Slayer XP, and that doesn't even tap into non-Slayer bossing.
---
Lol that’s my friend Door. Funny guy
---
As long as you play however way you want. Just try and have fun and enjoy the game and you will progress through it the way you want!
---
There are a number of monsters that access both RDT and GDT which is why we mention this on them. If a monster only hit the RDT that information would not show up now for the legends quest requirement.

I'm assuming English isn't your first language but you have a serious grammatical error in your question that I assume is asking if we have a favorite streamer. Also you use gender specific pronouns in your survey assuming all streamers we watch are men.

Why should they get something just for playing another mode?

It's not like it's harder to max, especially with all the Ironman updates Jagex keeps putting out.
---
That wasn't my experience at all tbh, tho I only had a teacher for like 1-2 raids then just grouped with other low kcers :P
---
I have 8707 kraken kc and no pet 😥
---
I remember getting quickswapped noted iron axe instead of noted rune axe. I the  proceeded to scam 100s of kids with the same trick.
---
It's an unsatisfying half-step that makes the Max cape a huge disappointment for the amount of work that goes into it though. If you max, you should be able to use the Max cape for whatever FashionScape you want.
---
If they ever complete the prerequisite engine work, they should update the Max capes ASAP.
---
The game should have risk, I agree. But the old death mechanics were too brutal. Ddosing and disconnects can result in you losing hundreds of mils due to no fault of your own. That's not what I would call good gameplay. A more costly version of zulrah/vork death mechanics would be a great median. Maybe 3-5% of the total value of lost items to reclaim them? 
---
As for an item sink, we can formulate better ideas than just bringing back the old death mechanics. Disassembly of some sort (kind of like what was proposed with warding, but without a new and boring skill proposition) would be a more intelligent and fair approach to an item sink.
---
We shouldnt have rely on the occasional dc and loss of valuable items to stabilize the economy.
---
It was great, thanks for the scim and dds drops!
---

GZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

I disagree with this since we don't have the Max cape customization options that the original Max cape released with. They could add the Ironman icons to the back of the cape though.
---
Yeah one of the people running the program probably striked the video. Obviously they wont dispute it, so hopefully it will be up again in 30 days.

At the bottom of the banking interface you should see a quantity option, change that to your desired withdraw size (All is good if you wanna fill your inv with 1 item, X is good if you wanna do like half your inv for stuff like crafting/herblore)
---
the paterdomus robes experience rates are too broken. Regular skilling sets are like 2.5% exp bonus at best, and chaos altar/POH altars are already insane

The main reason for the blowpipe is the reduction in time spent in the Caves, since it’s got such a high DPS. Means you’re not wasting 1.5 hours on a run, more like 45-60 minutes. Easier to deal with Jad tearing you a new one when it takes a half hour less to do so.
---
At the bottom of the bank interface there is a list of numbers, "1, 5, 10, x." The highlighted one is how much of an item will be withdrawn with each click.  X is a settable number, so you can make the withdraw amount 12, 14, or 2000 if that is a number you use constantly. It basically makes withdrawing supplies  for herblore easy instead of having to spam click 14 times

I wonder if this'll throw up a red flag in the botwatch system. You clicked once but it sent a ton of characters.

Once again it's not about what I want or what you want. It's what's best for the game. Any item that people want is an item that will keep people paying for membership and supporting the continuity of the game. Many people have expressed a desire for this item and many other cosmetics.
---
Voting no to cosmetics simply because they aren't something you personally would use is tantamount to voting no on lms content and updates even if you don't pvp at all. Is it your right as a p2p player? absolutely. But voting in a selfish manner is never what is right for the long term growth and success of the game. My opinion is not more valuable than yours. Assuming that that's what i mean is contrary to everything I've said.

I'm not saying steels and miths are terrible to do, like you said they're fairly quick. I'm saying people who are interested in maximizing slayer xp per hour generally don't do them. 
---
You might be right, I don't know for sure, and I'm not going to do all the calculations to figure out the optimal block/skip list. But the fact that this is the first time I've ever seen someone suggest that steel or mith dragons are worth doing leads me to believe you're wrong, since the alternative is that everyone else who has done the calculations is wrong.

And your last 3 links don't do anything to dispute my claim. The first one just says that you can kill them. And the last 2 are just guides for how to slay the two dragons.

"It's an integrity change" or "It's broken" or "It's not what we intended"
---
That being said, some kind of consistency in how to approach these need balancing changes is something I thing should happen.
---
Why is it ok to completely overhaul basilisk knights u polled but not sire? Or GG? Or any piece of content?
---
I saw at least 7, lol
---
Where is your consistency? Mad that they wanna make gargs and sire easier. And mad that they made basilisks easier? The only consistency I see with you is U MAD 😤😤🤪

While we were going through them we noticed some were spot on with what we had earlier in the year's project standpoint and others we were off by a little bit in some places. Not enough to affect to overall average profit per kill, but enough to say this was a big gift from the OS team. There were a lot of things from this dump we got that weren't even touched by the original project due to not enough drop data.
---
Dunno why this has anything to do with gender. Also there’s skills missing from the list, why not max?

There isn't one currently. Those that are there currently are done by hand on the page itself. We may look into a template, but that may be more cumbersome due to alt rarity values or a large range of rarity points. It's something we can look into to making those easier to get put up.

I was on the same boat. I payed for memebership till i got to money dragon and profit snek (vorkath zulrah). Now that i can do those bosses easily and effortlessly i set a time and day to grind out 2 bonds. But i also go and do gwd bosses and raids as well but if im really in need of a bond those are the ones i do. Mostly money comes in quickly with these "endgame" adventures.

To me pking should have some degree of complexity and experience based skills involved, yes 1 tick spec or combo eat takes time to master but is still something to be learn the same way other game mechanics in any other games, long gone is the era of the dead brain hit and hope for the best pking of the early 2000s, not only because of the new items added into the game but also because we de players have changed. We are no longer kids or young teens that just have a vague notion of the game mechanics, we have grown so much that we have a greater understanding of the game to the point we know about tick and how to use them, optimal gear and how the bonus affects your pking performance and dps, etc. Another thing that does not quite click with me is why people thing that the existence of an item changes everything, yes rapier is a thing yet most pkers dont own or use one, same goes for claws and other BiS, yes high end pkers do so what, there has been always a wealth gap that skews the players odds, even back when those items didn't exist those with the money to afford 99 range and mage (something rare in the in the rs2 era)were able to better their odds at pking, than the guy with their combat skills all over the place.
---
As for the cost of entry, learning something new will always cost something, I don't get why it should be easier to learn how to defeat a player that is unpredictible and different base on the target than an NPC with set behaviors, and the argument that since good pk weapons are expensive thus is hard to join is silly as you DO NOT NEED things like AGS or claws to pk, yes DDS and Maul maight be weaker in comparision but this does not make them useless the same way whip is still good even if there is a rapier or a scythe.
---
interesting. I played from 2004 to like 2009 and never remember it being a thing that was discussed the way it is now.
---
Pog, thank you for all the dedication and hard work!
---
So glad they are the majority. Without them this game is dead  as it wouldn't have a player base.

That wouldn't be an issue because it wouldn't exist in the first place

It is when they sell gold for real money.

That's when it becomes a "Business" and that's why they don't like this.

Probably someone who had the name got banned (when that happens the name can never be used again). Just choose a different name that *is* available. On a game with millions of created accounts it should be expected that you won't necessarily get the name you want and it's a bit silly to use that as a reason to not play

the fact that you had a brassy at 11 is pretty damn impressive imo. I was super stoked that I had a nezzy helm at that age but I never had any gp because the only moneymaker I knew was making bowstrings in seers. it ain't much but it's honest work.
---
He got himself copyright striked intentionally to take merit away from the idea he's involved in these scenes or is being paid to make the videos by the botters/gamblers as an advertisement.  Some of his videos are legit, but you can tell when he changes his tone for other videos and basically goes easy on some of them.
---
If they went that far on youtube to get the videos removed, I wonder if these guys have tried to bribe the /r/2007scape moderators into hiding posts like this. I know there are services that exists where you can pay people to mass downvote threads and post comments from accounts to misdirect claims, but SirPugger always has proof and is a reliable source.  
---
Them trying to silence him for talking about it is an important area of discussion to keep in mind while we use the internet, I bet some people would have tried to dispute the copyright and ended up being doxxed and silenced.
---
Honestly, I think that people partaking in gambling also should be banned. Don't need that trash in Runescape.
---
She. Sounds. Hideous.

I was wondering this too I don’t know if it records how many laps but first lap first floor first chest unreal

It's so obvious p mod account are being bought or abused go to any ge spot where two competitive gambling bots are and you'll see one of them muted and the other not. It happens all the time even when both bots are active on the same world

I think after a number of tries it stops checking for a while (to stop name checking bots) so that may have been the case for you. Maybe wait a bit then try again
---
It’s useful for challenge mode CoX, purples at ToB (but if you’re using tent you can just 50/50 and whack it), and venoming minions at Sara. Also a decent tank helm for wilderness clues/prayer or black chins because it also saves an inventory spot not needing an anti venom.

According to the wiki rewards calculator, yes getting a higher % increases the average amount of bolt racks received.

No. If we can't get a Champion's Max Cape because there's too many Max Capes, what makes you think we'll get these!?
---
Because they are a pain in the ass at mid levels and at high levels they are shit gp/hr for the amount of effort involved. They are effectively dead content now which is why the jaw costs so much.
---
Just put in in some some spot that RuneScape classic players would know about. Some archaic piece of content like Temple of ivok or some shit. No one touches that content besides once. No one's going to run into it, but the people who need it will know where it is.

IF YOU GUYS WANT TO GAMBLE JUST GO TO THE DUEL ARENA. If you don't have a maxed account, I don't really recommend it but you're still safer going with somebody who's streaming and having them chuck it for you. I've trusted a few randoms with a couple tens of mills before trying to play on their streaks and they're likely not going to log with under 50m of yours.. I've seen a guy do a legit 2b community chuck before, as in everyone trades their money to him and he chucks it, this is all done on stream though. I mean this is really a last resort.. because at the end of the day you shouldn't trust anyone on here but... it's a lot less of a chance to get scammed by someone live on twitch for under 50m then it is to lose 50m to a dicing bot. Just realize that duel arena is waaaay more addicting than it is to throw money at these bots because you physically see how close some duels can be.
---
*sip*
---
Yeah but like 25 people watch him when he streams on youtube. He's pretty much dead.

Does anyone have a link to the key and Peele meme for the skills ranking. Where he goes around shaking people's hands/hugging them. I saw it used here a few months ago and wanted to see it again. Thanks

Good on them, did anyone just randomly vanish or were they vocal? I used to watch a lot of oldschool streams in 2016, there's so many that aren't active anymore

I don't know if you've ever watched The International for Dota 2, but they had the exact same problem but with a guy. They brought in Day9 (professional starcraft player i think?) to host the English panel for the biggest event of the year after having only been involved with the game for a few months.
---
Long story short, it was miserable.  He didn't know enough about the game to properly interact with the different people on the panels or lead conversations.  He's an incredible guy, but he was not qualified to host the event and as a result it was very awkward and the event suffered.
---
Same story here. Hire people who know your game.
---
So on top of having a max cape AND the colorful helmet next to your name, you want more recolors of the max cape? All for what? To show how large your E-peen is? I’m voting yes

Not really though. It's more like 1 to infinity.

Lmao this is horrible advice, Rigour is more than 50m, better spend it on good gear/cons so you can farm properly to get rigour.

I appreciate you bringing this subreddit to my attention.

Not twitch. I think it's more he got kicked off twitch and no one cared to follow him after that. I'm sure not wanting to watch a train wreck is part of it, but I think it is more the switch of platforms.

Back in RS Classic you used to be able to change your password in-game. After it happened to me I used to scam accounts by telling people to change their password to coins and hit alt f4. Then change the password so I had time to take their stuff.

Why does the Portal Nexus not allow Arceus Teleports?
---
You're barking up the wrong tree. I don't represent Jagex. I'm just giving you the facts, not disagreeing with you. If you actually read the resource I gave you, you'd see their defense against boosting groups.
---
&gt;What should happen if a member of the group leaves?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If a group has progressed their accounts as a team but then one of them decides ‘Right, they’ve carried me this far, now I can make it on my own' and then decides to leave the group they would expect to just be downgraded to a solo Ironman account.  
---
&gt;However! They would be wrong, this will not be happening, if a member of a GIM group leaves the group they will be downgraded to normal account with no ironman restrictions. Simple as that.
---
Then
---
&gt; If a group member does leave, can we recruit a new one?  
---
&gt;If a member of your ironman group leaves then it seems appropriate to allow the group to recruit a new member. The best way to do this would be to allow groups to recruit ONLY fresh group accounts from the recruitment room. 
---
Express your concerns to the company, not me.
---
It's nice at off task DKs so you can bring extra restores to lengthen trips

---
exp rates up to about lvl 60 are pretty miserable, click intensive, gets a little better from there. Then at 63 you can hunt red chinchompas, make some decent money.
---
I don’t stake but why do you care what other people do with their gp lol
---
Lmao I knew it!(From Pennsylvania btw)
---
???????
---
Ya, this is amazons problem, not jagex since they don’t put the game out on the kindle store. Works fine on my fire 8 though.
---
I don’t think you can be sensible?
---
This is the saddest shit I've read all day
---
Soul wars, even tho it was broken af.
---
I saw on the runelite server, someone said runelite gave you some drop data which u had used to get drop rates for a lot of the common monsters, and then u gave it to private servers so they stopped giving you any more, is this true?
---
Nah. Rsc it was in ordered logged in however if someone logged out, the next person to log in would take that place. In rs2, it was either the same on release or we had ip pid where ur ip was based on the digits in an ip address. Then in 2008 it was changed to be same as rsc. Then with the release of osrs it went back to ip pid. Then in 2014 it went to randomly switching every tick. 
---
Before 2014, you could never boot someone off good pid.
---
I'm always happy to help!

Out of curiosity have you done them? They aren't hard they just kinda...suck? people are trying to find ways to make them interesting, similar to how demonic gorillas kick some ass

---
Birdhouses all the way man, do them as soon as you can start
---
I unironically sort of like this
---
I see that. But plenty of others (sorry if it's not you) have given a lot of flack about how boosting would ruin the mode when:
---
1). I'm not boosting, I just want to play with my friends.
---
2). Even if someone boosts it doesn't hurt anyone else because... Iron men btw.
---
3). There is already going to be boosting if they don't require new members to be fresh accounts only, but this is definitely a money grab for jagex if this becomes the case.
---
4). If group Ironman is a lower tier than Ironman, and is in between Ironman / normal mode, then it makes sense to have GIM be allowed as a step in between.
---
They dknt have to do it...at all. Its actually kind of cool they have the option to slog through a couple kills to potentially make bank at a really low level.
---
The internet culture has expanded so knowledge is more easily accessible. Then you browse any forums where pid would matter like pking, staking, castle wars forums? It was discussed plenty there.
---
Why
---
RuneScape taught me to lie about my age online, because the first time I tried making an account it blocked me because I put my real birth year. I was 10 at the time.
---
Neat.
---
Osrs mobile also runs better on mobile then the vanilla osrs client. There is literally no good reason mobile shouldn't have mouse support.
---
The only thing I can think of is if there is botting detection issues with mobile.
---
NO
---
Ah yes, my 500g granite for half a mil
---
Lmao.
---
Back then almost all random events could attack you so it might just be that.
---
Good times, i miss finding myself in lumbridge while afk fishing...
---
spent 300k on that necklace that turns u into a rabbit in castle wars :(
---
Jagex has clear rules on this topic, and the only reason they allow duel arena staking is because otherwise they'd have to deal with many other player-run games of chance which are much more prone to scamming. That said, I don't think this game (easily accessible to kids) should have a place for gambling. It's a terrifyingly easy way to get into it and lose yourself.
---
Furthermore, I don't care what people do with their in-game currency as long as it stays in the game, but it's simply a fact that there is a large RWT presence in the duel arena. It puts a dark cloud above Runescape and has resulted in way too many problems for Jagex in the past and present.
---
Lucky cause you didn’t have any 10k+ or 20k+ kills before getting a scroll reeeeeee
---
Why are you putting question marks 
---
That's the next line of the song that I replied to.
---
What does dragon warhammer have to do with lizardman shamans? They’re just big lizards. Give the drop to baby red dragons instead as it makes sense, cos they’re red dragons and the dragon warhammer is red
---
iOS 13 (both it and iPadOS) supports Mice natively, and they work fine in OSRS mobile. I'm confident this isn't at all because of Jagex though; pretty sure this was a specific feature added with 13.
---
For Android, while not a solution or ideal, if you have a USB drawing tablet (like Wacom or Huion; the things you connect to a computer for signatures or actual drawing with a pen; alternatively if you happen to play osu! you may have seen these used), if you can connect that over USB OTG, that'll work perfectly for OSRS since pen taps are considered touch input.
---
&gt;1). I'm not boosting, I just want to play with my friends.
---
They give you the option to do that by creating a new account. They don't know who is and isn't boosting. They're protecting themselves by making everyone start at square 1.
---
&gt;2). Even if someone boosts it doesn't hurt anyone else because... Iron men btw.
---
Did you not read my previous post? If you leave a group, you're a regular unrestricted account. You're not even IM anymore.
---
&gt;3). There is already going to be boosting if they don't require new members to be fresh accounts only, but this is definitely a money grab for jagex if this becomes the case.
---
I take it you haven't read anything from Jagex and you're just ranting now. They've made it very clear they're taking huge steps to prevent boosing... by going to the extreme of making your account a regular account upon leaving the group.
---
&gt;4). If group Ironman is a lower tier than Ironman, and is in between Ironman / normal mode, then it makes sense to have GIM be allowed as a step in between.
---
You have absolutely no reading comprehension. When you leave the group, you're a normal account. You don't get to be an IM EVER AGAIN with that account. Hence, the reason of starting with a NEW account. You don't just get to downgrade your account as you please over and over again.
---
They've addressed all of your concerns but you're too lazy to spend 1 minute reading a dev article.
---
I feel like I shouldn't have to say this, but no, that's not true.
---
Youtube is absolute scum, they are trying to censor everyone and phase out vloggers to make YT more like netflix.

I remember once seeing the 10k+ coin stack under everyone at the bank booth at varrock east, the adrenaline running to it was real. ended up being 250k which I had a nerdgasm over

---
Ah yes, like when the camo outfit pieces from the random event were selling for like 700k because jagex made them tradable for some reason.

Patch notes are bare bones following as they aren't exactly weekly or daily and can save you headache if let's say X creature Max hit was doubled without you realizing and you die in a unsafe area
---
Ok. How would it be like a gold sink? I dont understand
---
So it’s harsh that you botted and got banned?
---
Sorry dude but you deserved every bit of punishment you got, you won’t find any sympathy on this sub.
---
Also it isn’t “macroing” that’s exactly what you did. No fuck up here.

For the wilderness bosses, there's a 1/128 chance of hitting the dragon 2h table. 50% you get the dragon 2h sword (0.5/128), and 50% you get sent to the dragon pickaxe table (0.5/128).
---
There's a 1/128 chance of directly getting the dragon pickaxe table, plus 0.5/128 from the above paragraph. This makes it a 1.5/128 chance of getting to this table. You have 50% chance of getting the dragon pickaxe (so 0.75/128), and a 50% chance of getting supercompost (0.75/128).
---
You also have a 4/128 direct chance of hitting the supercompost table.
---
This is why the dragon pickaxe was incorrectly stated to be 1/256 for many months by jmods because they didn't realize that the dragon 2h table gives a chance at the dragon pickaxe.
---
Is this Jagex supporting botters by not banning them so they continue to buy bonds?
---
Trust no one.   Lesson learned

Yes, I'm not sure what the length of time is but it's something like that. If you change your name again though your original name will no longer be reserved, reservation only applies to your last name
---
1/X is easier to get mad about when you reach (x rounded to the next whole number)+1 and you still don't have the drop
---
Thank you very much for these transcripts, I really enjoy reading when I don't have the time/ability to watch the stream. Also very useful if you miss something. 
---
Really, thanks man
---
Really fun idea. They had a minigame made like this in Rs3 that always looked enjoyable. Would play.
---
Shit to kill, shit drop rate, there's better, easier, more engaging (fun), and more consistent methods of making money.
---
This is dope
---
giving noobs sara plate is probably the smartest way to get them to fully engage with the game
---
Would even like the opinions of non stakers like me
---
RNG 8764
---
Are your xp drops on lol
---
Infernal eels are the best mobile friendly and afk money maker
---
Cballs are around 5 cents an hour, why bother tbh
---
Wasn’t  posible D many of us were too young.
---
Heeeey my name is andrew too💙💙💙💙
---
Let us recolour our original red max cape.
---
You can do it in nmz (good for afking) but you can train defence more efficiently by chinning or barraging.
---
Will that hit the healers if I use them on Jad?
---
Nothing true they forgot to add in a any team or regular cape for that1-2+ in def bonus stats
---
Edit: I just saw the link on the list it doesn’t include cape but kn the notes below it, it does
---
Too many bots as is. It's not like the 2006 days when you got the three strikes and you're out system. We all remember back then botting was the reason they removed free trade, because of the lack of urgency, and the ever evolving private script markets.
---
It sucks but you are now the poster child on reasons not to bot.
---
Ooooh it's from the new quest so it's not updated on some places i guess, thanks!
---
Yep, xp drops are on, using runelite and no data for my skill gains, xp is staying the same when you mouse over the skill I'm training (defense)
---
2007, the massacre
---
Missed a fat opportunity to name it SplashMountain
---
Have fun and enjoy the adventure!
---
Have you considered that in 2007 most people playing were kids and teenagers? The player base is not the same.
---
I'd love to go back to high school, that's like 20 years ago :).
---
Chinchompas for ranged training, herbiboar and birdhouses for herblore supplies.  High level imps often have good rewards, most notably the dragon imps.  Lucky imps have great rewards but are so rare its unlikely you'll get anything.
---
Fits with the Monty python references they've added. take my vote
---
Its actually not what you said by looking up about 2 inches.
---
*ssssssmmmmmooookkkkkeeeeeee innnn thhhheee wwaaattterr* ^fire in the sky
---
Unpopular opinion: 25 buttholes deserves a golden gnome
---
You are screaming "ban me!" so hard man, I mean this is kind of acting as if you were selling drugs next to a police station.
---
I love this, but I'm already 99 and have the pet too.
---
You literally said “I doubt there’s that much work to do”.
---
That's incredible, very good job to whomever made it.
---
I use a laptop. Spam Tap the touchpad, never actually make a click.
---
Followed !
---
Shame they're not making a strawman mode because you'd be good at it!
---
Don't stop I'm almost there
---
god i wish that were me
---
Perhaps the lore is/will be different for OSRS, but I think what RS2 established there is a safe bet when you consider Song of the Elves mentions the elder god Mah.
---
Too much of Runescape's lore is difficult to learn about, as it's scattered among twitter, updates, in-game dialogue, in-game books, the actual runescape novels, Q&amp;A sessions, etc. Really, nobody can be blamed making mistakes.
---
I still very much appreciate your artwork and the fact that you've worked in deeper than surface level lore into it :)
---
is your name andrew
---
Just checked it and it's as I said. Are you remembering wrong? https://youtu.be/88J74HaB4WY
---
Yup just check the wiki page for tangleroot :) idea behind most of them was that time / cost / level should impact it. Same reason thieving a man isn't the same chance of Rocky as thieving a Paladin for example. Otherwise pet meta would just be to spam pickpocket men when at their no fail level.
---
Though farming has some weird ones with some questionable design. Seaweed being the most obvious weird choice. It's one of the best pet patches despite growing in like 40 minutes, being a profit patch and being heavily involved in ironman meta. Same with mushroom, pretty quick low level and very cheap patch to grow. Yet amazing rates.
---
Other ones make more sense like fruit trees and spirit trees because of their level requirement and massive growth time.
---
hespori is like a big tree spirit.
---
Which was one of the best ways to get a rune axe before the woodcutting guild
---
Use resources like the wikia as it is official and can for the most part answer any specific questions about drops, use for certain items, and also has guides from a lot of things like training or how to do quest. As well as helping you to get familiar with the lore of things if thats you like that sort of thing.
---
&gt;Why Specific Graardor?
---
&gt;Because it's Pet *General* Graardor
---
Was a highlight for me, bigbrain
---
Unlucky as hell mate. I partner boosted my mate when he hit 95 to get his first task cos I had tons of points and Konar blocks. He got one pretty quick and decided to annoy me by getting claw and 3 leathers his first task while I got 2 tails...
---
Is the magic logs from the zombies in Tarn's lair a better option for ironmen than using that tree in legends quest I wonder
---
No is name is Andrew too
---
wiki, not wikia
---
God Ash is a gentleman and a scholar, you take that back this instant you cut, you ruffian, you scoundrel
---
+1 for one involving wize old man
---
They haven't. But I doubt it seeing as it's not an ingame minigame or boss.
---
Are they any good?
---
Because all the backlash comes from the socially unaware neckbeards that hate their own physical appearance. You can’t even see the guys face lol
