thanks for trying to argue with them. you are completetly right in that Vorkath is not being botted due to the requirements. 
---

---
You can write a script for every PvE Boss and Vorkath is  far from the difficulty of raids /inferno.
---
Problems? Judging by the title I think he means he would much rather play RS than have a girlfriend. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Okay, sorry to hear :)
---
Are you sure you're not super upset over runecrafting? It sounds like it.
---
Yes
---
How about no. The older a boss gets the more the profits decline. That's how its been and always will be.
---
You are special :)
---
World 322 out of coincidence but I'd be happy if I picked accident memes. I wanted a world with 69 in it but there wasn't a good one.

I hear dharoks is sub optimal prior to 90 hp, full obby with zerker neck and obby sword best til then (for low def mobs like nmz)

Eh, "Stayin' Alive" is still perfectly functional, as people are pointing out. Don't worry about which song you're using as long as it works for you in the moment :)
---
Are the bristles-2 a photoshop brush or a Krita? Thanks so much for answering, I love the way it looks oil painted almost.
---
8/10 would fart inside.
---
there are plenty of people that go really dry for 1/5k drops, why the fook would you be an exception to change the way drops are managed. keep grinding like the rest of use and stop complaining. have a nice day :)
---
Jagex fucks up all the time, but come on, diconnecting people when using an ability? Did they at least do a rollback, or was everyone who died to that just forced to pay death the fee and move on?
---
Not sure why this is downvoted, bludgeon and dagger are the best options if training on higher def mobs outside crabs or nmz
---
Advice on mid-level goals? Been playing for around 2 months and have reached a point where basically all of early game goals are out of the way (see pictures below). Any advice on where to go from here? Thanks!

"A lot of legit players" can you back that statement? The only legit players I see at zulrah are far above/ very close to SOTE reqs. 
---
Or are you suggesting full ancestral / TBOW armadyll is harder to achieve than 70 in a few stats? To me it feels like a lot of low level players are skipping on zulrah until they feel more confident // or at the very least im very unlucky in not seeing them during my zulrah trips.

---
They'd be ok in WoW because it's a different aspect. This is essentially just timers, but in RS the difficulty in this is timing the prayer flicking, in WoW the difficulty would be executing the mechanics.
---
What’s pog? Thank you! Grinding strength right now. Just trying to get buff
---
Omg, this is badass.
---
i dont see why zulrah should not be on equal terms to Vorkath. Zulrah seems more difficult/ click intense to me. Kill times are roughly the same. Rewards used to be roughly the same too.
---

I wish they would add stuff from the 3rd party clients to the vanilla one
---
Divine super combats are basically guaranteed certain value now whereas the expected value of the crystal chest is lower than that. Maybe you're lucky with the chest though.
---
Nerd
---
Haha yeah 322 is what people spam in dota when they think someone is throwing a game
---
Wait forreal? Can't tell if this is /s since they removed world hop limit.
---
Dude, this is easily the best artwork I’ve seen on this sub. Everyone loses it over the zuhaar guy, but this is leagues better imo.
---
it's not racist either way since theyre all the same race
---
Allow Ironmen to purchase bonds from the grand exchange.
---
They can't trade them, and they're a use for an ironman's accumulated gold. You can already use bonds on ironmen to give them membership.
---
Trident is A LOT more dps than iban.
---
I mean, little weird to target them specifically. Rageb8? I can’t tell anymore tbh.
---
Tbh I love this idea. I get the idea of not necessarily being punitive to someone who doesn't have one of the mutagens, but exchanging mutagens + scales for the other mutagen. Would definitely be a passive scale sink. u/dreadwraith8d made a really good point with us needing a scale sink with all the bots. I rememeber when scales were 200+ gold a piece, now they're like 160.
---
well I'm throwing my life away so
---
Nice, very useful ^

The same thing I do every day u/pops_rustafied. Train Runecrafting.

On the bright side, I finally got the pet.

Oh, that's good news.  I guess not much has changed at the higher end since I left then.

Trueee. Intervention at the after party

Wtf nerd, jump scare to the extreme here.

before designing a whole new skill we need to decide whether we even want a new skill

he looks so odd and out of place its really weird

Yeah built a badass pc at the end of 2016, so not as impressive now but:
---
GPU: 1080 Gaming
---
CPU: i7 8700k
---
Storage: Samsung 960 PRO m.2 512g and a 4tb bulk hdd
---
RAM: 16g Trident
---
Everything else along those lines, all RGBd out, crystal (all glass) white case, it's a real beauty. Probably the highest spec game I've played on it is tabletop simulator...

Seriously, OP.

Make a link to something or PM me. I want a print and I want to pay the artist not just download it.

---
a monster and a redbull that's a true kyle
---
I still dont agree with your methods
---
lmao 10/10
---
Oh yikes my bad, misread
---
Would expect it to be fairly close to 190-200k like you say but you might want to ask the discord yourself. As you make fewer mistakes with the bark 4t cycle you should notice a decent increase in xp/hr
---
Was a fun 99, thanks for the invite!

Anyone willing to carry a choob through 1kc of CoX? I don't have the gear to really do it properly yet but I'd like to knock out the diary. I know I could do learner raids but it doesn't seem worth tying to learn CoX without the gear to be actually useful to a team.
---
I have really lost all motivation to level up this skill now I I practically live on the house party world. I'm like why would I spend all that time and money when I can just use someone else's who has the best everything?
---
Dungeoneering only Exists for the sake of Existing, you have no goal but finishing Dungeons over and over again, Dungeons existed forever in runescaoe but suddenly you get Xp for completing dungeons only at daemonheim, futhermore, The Reward shop gave miscellanious that are not related to the dungeons, which made the lack of a narrative of the skill worse.
---
Sure it had great lore and quests, but Just no real reason to Exist the way it did.
---
Trade in cape for a chance at a token to recolour.
---
I’m not quite sure what’s meant to be light about rocks being all over you..
---
It's a skilling boss and is also a great moneymaker, so it's appealing to a lot of lower level players and new members as it's an easy way to get a substantial amount of gp early on. You also get around 150k exp/hr starting from level 50, which is very high to begin with if you're coming straight from F2P, and the experience rates only get higher as your firemaking levels up
---
Underrated comment here......
---
is the joke only 12 clues?
---
fuck your rng:(
---
A correction in my original comment, it's actually moreso gold farmers not bots, confirmed by a jmod. I'd prefer jagex spend more time tracking rwt as I feel that could be vastly improved over placing a bunch of bandaid solutions on a problem which would hurt actual legitimate players.
---
Zul Andra teles dropped because they dramatically changed the drop table for the boss by the way, not because of bots and gold farmers.
---
He's holding a shark
---
This is fucking genius hahaha
---
It's better than tears of guthix. It's 90k magic exp per day which is 99 in half a year doing nothing.
---
Nope, just the 500k upfront then 1m each time you want to reclaim.
---
It’s a game man also rocks weren’t mentioned 😂
---
Orikalkum dragon ;)
---
It’s like 400kxp/hr...
---
I'm not proud to say this but that was my 2nd inv on the head phase alone... This was before we knew about wdr, what the specials were, how to turn the head or anything lmao
---
If I want to do Vorkath (BGS+BP right now) long term as my money maker, should I aim first for Rigour or DHCB? I need to grind out 160m either way so which purchase gets me there faster?
---
It turns the function keys, like control or shift, to toggle mode.
---
They're talking about the black Knight Titan from Holy Grail, which is a members quest.
---
Figma nuts lol
---
Recently unblocked them and I’m trying to do a full task at Vorkath. 750 do a kill is more than most high level slayer bosses afaik and it’s like 2 minutes a kill with a quick bank time. I’m only 50 kills in of 168 and the loot tab is already over 10m
---
Was she 10 gp though?
---
But you have to drink brews when you're damaged? How is that not endgame pvm?
---
its becuase of runescape classic, rs3 fixed smithing and made it useful.
---
Scimitars have the best overall mix of power and speed of any other kind of melee weapon.
---
Always buy the strongest kind of scimitar you can use as soon as you can afford it, it is always worth it.
---
Thanks for showing up, guys. I love this community
---
One action between each jad hit, and change to longrange on your blowpipe. Pray, switch to longrange, pray, hit one, pray, hit another, etc.
---
TBH it should be imbueable with anti's or superanti's. That'd be pretty useful for PP or something
---
A cat knows a mouse when it sees one
---
What
---
But the clicks.. construction is shit
---
Once you stop burning higher tier fish less you start making profit.
---
For example cooked shark is usually around 150gp more than a raw shark and by using hosidius kitchen/cooking gauntlets you burn a lot less. If you use both you stop burning sharks at 94 then it's straight profit until 99
---
A nice goal to aim for is the quest recipe for disaster. The requirements are a whole load of other quests which are good to do anyway and the reward for finishing is some of the best gloves in the game =)
---
Lucky man, my wife gave up in tutorial island after not being able to smelt the bronze bar because she just wouldn't listen that she needed tin as well.
---
Could we potentially see some QoL changes come to the vanilla osrs client? It has been through very few changes over the past few years and would love to see additions such as GPU support.
---
OMG! I just found Unnecessary Inventions last week and I can’t stop laughing at all of his creations. It’s so funny seeing him here now. My favorite is his Sweat Gutters™️
---
You can use number keys for everything except clicking to build and remove. I just rest my hand on 1 key and spacebar, sit back in my chair, and pull my hand off my mouse every 4 tables to hit enter when telling my butler how many planks to get me.

LMFAO

Hey thanks for looking out! I appreciate you brother
---
Fashionscape is on point
---
it's a gigantic pain in the ass to bulk buy bonds and sell them. also jagex is not amazing at banning gold buyers
---
Wrong thread, JMods don't read this. Try the Q&amp;A thread posted on Mondays/Tuesdays depending on your timezone (you just missed this week's one)
---
Do that for what? Excluding raids, vorkath is the fastest way in the game to earn 1b gp. Trying to get there through slayer and "casual" bossing would take twice as long
---
Watch 6 and 7, but honestly spare yourself from Season 8
---
I had fun, thanks man.
---
check out bitterkoekje's dps calculator, there are also forum links to what the calculations are based off.
---
Mining, Skotz, and grinding mole ATM.
---
You tried Aus servers? They probs not much better but we had to deal with NA ping before we got those servers so i totally get what is happening to you.
---
I got mine recently by using the “efficient quest cape” wiki and slayermusiq1 videos. Honestly had such a blast
---
What do you need a 1b cash stack for? You want a tbow? Why wouldn't you raid for that?
---
tbh i doubt it makes much of a difference seeing as the rest of your gear has pretty decent mage def bonuses already, but the -5 accuracy probably doesn't impact your own dps much either.
---
I still upvoted tho &lt;3
---
Thanks it's always annoying when I click the banker by mistake instead of the booth.
---
They eat them motherfuckers
---
It is a mining pet you can tell by the way he’s standing in the picture
---
Probably how they spell it in the UK like color/ colour
---
Private servers have the graphics, so Jagex could just take those and make new ones for the new places. Doubt it’ll happen though.
---
Because the post in question is talking about buying 800m and you said that's "easy to make money" in your first comment? and Raiding for a bow still takes hundreds of hours and less consistent than vorkath
---
If that's what it takes to ban the gold farmers then yes.
---
I didn't tele out when I got Kree pet to instantly insure it. Probably done about 10 more kills after. Now I realise how bad that could have ended...
---
What are thoseeee boots?
---
I would’ve given you 1.5M for that. :(
---
Tbh I usually find my inv filling up before running out of food even with the regular anti-fire shield... So if the opposite is true for you then DFS is probably the better option. Typically extra DPS &gt; extra survivability tho, since more kills/h = more profit/h.
---
Blessed be thine RNG &lt;3
---
Money making is easy. You're just lazy.
---
You're just not an idiot
---
Were not even talking about me, I just told you how long it would take, using the fastest method possible in game, to make the amount of gold he bought. But I understand you have 10k hour played doing slayer for 500k/hr and nothing better to do so its ez.
---
Has Rantz tried to kill one yet?
---
Until they ban someone who isn’t, they make a reddit post and we shit post jamflex crabs 🦀 and trash the company for being incompetent and shitty. They’re damned if they do, and damned if they don’t. But at least if they don’t they can pass the blame along to someone else.
---
Better ban you too in case you decide to purchase gold in the future
---
You.. shouldn't do that
---
Yes I already went through that I already took the bow from him. I'm so freaking confused idk what to do
---
Love it
---
Yeah fuck doing something afk while driving much prefer click intensive
---
Pures are the kind of people who want armor options when they have 1 def.

Are your npc attack options hidden?
---
I had no idea fanart could be this detailed while still maintaining the OSRS graphical style. Easily one of the best pieces I've ever seen. Thank you for the new wallpaper!
---
F
---
Personally, I don't think it is a terrible idea. But I know in the past when Broad Darts were considered they felt there wasn't enough room to justify adding them and Amethyst likely run into a similar issue. If there were going to add them, chances are they would have been added by now but never know.
---
Yeah man i had never been hacked in over 10 years at that point so i had the attitude itll never happen to me so i never had 2 factor but it happens no matter how safe you are :p
---
Awesome. Thank you
---
I did, I'm 939 dry, damn you
---
Boi the servers have been total shit lately. Tf you on? But on another note, they've got to fucking do something that this. Risk is what balanced PvM profits. I don't care that I have an Infernal cape, Twisted Bow, Scythe, and camp Raids 24/7. The fact that I'm able to do so unafraid to die is a serious integrity issue.
---
Nope, as darts they have to look at scaling with blowpipe.
---
In mlm I say "Pay-dirt! Poggers!"
---
Havent you heard about the mining and smiting rework?
---
Jokes aside they basically restructured everything so smithing was really really useful to level now and mining was afkable and not as soul destroying as it can be in osrs
---
I'm the one who slays for all the tarromin seeds that you require, I request my fair share as well.
---
Pick flax soo good
---
If you were to say get a task from Steve then go Tureal (without finishing the task) and get one from him (tureal) then you streak will be over.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I’d take it
---
What and ruin the graphics if this beautiful game? No thanks. Id rather only get to play for 15 minutes before my battery is drained.
---
Lol what? People sit at certain areas for ages all the time. Skill grinds? Boss/drop grinds? Flippers?
---
Well I kinda liked sir puggers videos but that's gonna be an unsubscribe for me
---
Do you have a firecape and barrows gloves? Cause then you should grind for them :) very useful.
---
forcing people to work together is NOT a good thing
---
Do this exactly! It's what I have done. So much in members is "locked" behind quest requirements , so this will really help you out.
---
How can you be so closed-minded? I'd imagine there's plenty of things you like that others don't. Should they just disregard you as human trash for that? Grow the fuck up.
---
If you could make something worth 40k at level 40 smithing, (which you can basically get for free from a few quests), that would make early game moneymaking a joke
---
how to spot the new kid. the booth he stands behind can be used without a seal. dont click on him, problem solved, newbie.
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
Would be a great idea imo, as long as it was only unlockable with points from the mini game itself. Much in the same way you pick up bones to peaches first if you plan on going for multiple items as it makes the graveyard room far less frustrating. Honestly having done the mini game myself recently I think it needs a lot of balance/qol changes but it is very outdated content now.
---
he's 14 lol
---
Desert Treasure 2, Desert Raids, Barrows 2 (Vesta, Statius etc) dropped by Wilderness Raid and Frozen Door Skilling Raid are all coming out next month man. And Sailing, Artisan, Dungeoneering, and Warding.
---
It's the biggest update month in the history of MMORPGS, I can't wait for all the new content.
---
Sinicul, add me bro
---
Jagex doesn't care about you.
---
Hey looking for some advice, I'm currently mobile locked as well. What did you do during the healers? Last time I got to jad the healers came out and I tried killing them, missed pray switch and died. I currently have 86 range toxic (addy) blessed dhide and anguish. My question is, when healers come out could I just out dps them and kill jad with my current set up, that way I can just focus on prayers?

In osrs yeah. It was changed some time before osrs base game. I think it was with the introduction of the ditch because that also stopped u from taking damage when u levered into mb.

Ok

Who the fuck pks at mlm like whatttt. I bet he was bridding the poor lad too.

Fewer smily faces in comments goes a long way too. To be totally honest, I feel like they make you appear to lack ingenuity. Solid video content though. I’d watch.

Anyone who has ever teled up to bandits with the burning ammy has seen these bots. They were actually there pre hop limit update too.

Now i cant unsee my butler with a future lambo

always point north unless i cant see something thats vertical

u noob yes

Yeah. Jagex could do it client side in about a month at most. Regular People have already made clients that edit graphics of the game. But ash doesnt like hacks so we must suffer.
---
Deserved ban
---
Sit
---
reported him for rwt
---
i mean for the sake of the OSRS economy, all bosses should be limited outside of slayer tasks, at a high enough number it would impact 99% of players
---
something like 80-100 kills a day of a single boss can be the "limit" and can just explain it by saying "___ has no interest in fighting you anymore"
---
make killing Zulrah an elite task, done.
---
Lol you'll be okay champ
---
Correct, but you can easily have your prayer empty out when entering the abyss within 15 seconds of the boost timer going off.
---
&gt;As long as you enable it while the timer is above 14, it will still boost.
---
Only IF you enable preserve 15 seconds ahead of the level drop though. If you take issue with this fact, check the wiki. https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Preserve
---
You need 70 to get into Priff to get Crystal shards, so it does sort of have a 70 agility requirement.
---
So ur merching them urself but didnt want to sell at 100k. dont worry dude. Theres no reason they shouldnt hit 200k other than an update.
---
Imagine getting kicked for high level a q p
---
could just get the gloves and make more money doing rune dragons with them then sell them back when you get close to dhcb money again

East Ardougne.

Train your cat to hit the green boxes

For insuring your pets? Go to easy ardougne and the head a little west of the central market. Shes right next door of the estate agent

The one you insure your pets at? Ardougne.
---
You cant buy pets, only insure them. The insurer is west of the east ardougne tele. You can get free kittens from gertrude west varrock after a quest

Aw man I wish I would have seen this later - congrats! What method did you use to level?

Recharge your prayer, that should be your next goal
---
With HCIM being the only high risk game mode currently, could we see an alternative high risk game mode for main accounts.

rather than losing status on death these accounts could lose a portion of their bank on deaths with the ability to safe guard a limited amount of chosen items

Stop watching in my opinion its not worth ruining it for ur self

Tune into Runefest. Always big announcements at Runefest. Black graceful, man. Black graceful.

U could reach that area just by standing on the dock. But the problem is that they consider mantas and turtles to be deep sea creatures, hence the reason why you go out to see to catch them so that rod would need to be able 500 times longer.

---
Lol where you get this info from?? Ive heard quite the opposite for a very very long time.
---
tbh from when I've used it dwh might not even be worth bringing even if you have it because it just feels like it *never* hits, probably get more dps from just using that attack on an extra lance attack that actually might hit and then use the extra space for food while also not having to worry about watching your spec bar,  could be wrong technically but you feel kinda dumb when you bring it and frequently miss every single spec in a trip
---
Lol i ran into these once and kept closing the door on them
---
26 planks but you only use 24
---
Mahog table = 6 x 4 per trip
---
how do you get scammed if you report the player the spanner is insisting you report?
---
Hope we get some new bosses... i know we just got kebos but we need another large slayer update
---
It's a man watch out
---
Rs3 bad

Do super combats

You can do oak dungeon doors for 500k xp per hour. It's also one of the cheapest methods.

I disagree.  I advise my friends to drop the 15-20m it takes to get 83 con as soon a they get all of the sub 5m upgrades (fury, whip, rings,  etc) before investing in any godwars items except maybe bgs. Having easy access to ornate pool and jewelry box is really game changing and you only need to do it once.  Taking the extra 30-60 seconds to use someone else's house adds up tremendously over time.
---
Community: no ezscape plz
---
Also community: unless it affects me too
---
What do you need 86 for? I was under the assumption that I have basically a max house with 84 and the highest portal nexus. Is it for the spirit tree + fairy ring? Because I don't see much of an issue with just having those be in two seperate rooms honestly
---
Bill Burr making me laugh for the millionth time in my life
---
 as you complete more of the diary it will work on more higher tier ores
---
I cant afford a lance /: i hve a bgs though lol. What would be the next best weapon? It seems like peeps are recommending not even trying without a lance.
---
Its definitely worth having your own house for sure. But I dont think it's something you need to train until you're already set with equipment, supplies, and prayer. I'd rather use spare GP on those first before I sink it all into construction. That's at least my thoughts.
---
I plan on getting into that eventually.
---
I do have questions about it though...is hunter actually fun? If not, is it profitable enough to negate the suffering? Are there any important quests that have hunter prerequisites?
---
This is absolutely fucking excellent.  What a pleasure to look at.  Notice the D Scim being snapped through.  You are genuinely talented.
---
i actually got scammed like this years and years ago pre-pre eoc, friend gave me his level 118 with 99 str.... i put so much gp on that account and he recovered it..
---
no one take this account, or take it and just don't use it so he can't scam others.
---
I’m the friend btw. :p. Yeah I got it verified by a pmod friend that it’s 1/25,000,000. Bone and dwh are 1/5,000. So 5000x5000=25,000,000. At least that’s how it was explained to me
---
Duuude gratz!!! Its always nice seeing people beat it for their first time! (:
---
Sure, but not forced. Both raids updates have been group content.

This longer, I realize I should be saying it

did you also change the password for your email that is connected to rs? that is the only way I could see it happening again

It’s more like I made a pure and realized how dumb it was

I have yes due to me forgetting it lmao

Honestly I wouldn't kiss you after you touched that man.

maybe a third party client then or a keylogger on your computer. I am just throwing out ideas, hopefully you get it figured out homie. best of luck

if you eventually get 99 constr, the cape teleports are so good

Ice or blood barrage on abby demon task? I was wondering since they tp around so much, maybe blood barrage would get more kills/h since they will split up sometimes if you freeze them. Or does the extra dmg and reduced cost make it more worth to still use ice barrage?

This is a great piece of work. The detail is amazing. Every section I look, I find something new. Love it!
---
It's not actually insane.
---
So here's my best conspiracy theory. JageX was somewhat forced to remove free trade and make the wilderness safe because of the amount of credit card fraud that was happening. If they didn't get it under control, they would have been at risk of losing their ability to process payments.
---
This fraud was done by botters and gold farmers. You need a lot of accounts, a lot of memberships, to run a successful farm. So how do you combat it?
---
Well, you can sell membership in game. You can sell bonds. And that helped a lot, surely. I doubt any gold farmers use stolen cards anymore.
---
But bot farmers? If you still need a lot of membership, you still commit a lot of fraud. And JageX is still seeing too much credit card fraud through their company. They still have their banks breathing down their neck to get their numbers down.
---
So how do we cross the threshold? Make a small loophole. Make it a pain the ass. Give it a cover story, the best cover story is the truth. Making 1 account of membership by hand is pretty easy. Making 10 is a hassle. 100 is ridiculous. Only a bot farmer would be willing to set up all the hoops to do so. The same kind who would use stolen cards before. 
---
And there could be multiple middlemen in between. Maybe the botter buys account packs. But at the end, jagex has crossed below the threshold. JageX has "acceptable" levels of credit card fraud. And simply has to ghost any concerns about the loophole.
---
Or maybe.
---
Not.
---
I know that. You still have to watch for the spot actually leaving, though.
---
Fav task
---
Why
---
I've seen a few people talking about this in game and on reddit, wonder what's caused the spike.
---
I dunno, I've heard Framed is a super cool dude, and pretty good at the game, but his voice makes it unbearable for me to watch a single full video of his
---
And that is what Autumn Elegy signed up for on his F2P UIM. 
---
The "trial" isn't built for snowflake F2P-only IM/UIM/HCIM though. You can thrive in f2p if you can use the GE.
---
Chaos runes were always bound to onyx price. 
---
Ppl sold chaos runes for 9 tokkul and bought onyx for 260k tokkul(with diary). 
---
The demand for onyx was bigger than the supply of chaos runes so ppl bought extra chaos runes from shops for 100 ea. 
---
100÷9×260000=2'888'888 
---
Now that there are too many onyx from the new skilling boss and the zulrah gold farmers this is not needed anymore so chaos runes just follow the onyx down. 
---
Onyx price x 9 ÷260'000 is the lower cap for chas runes now. 
---
I hope this was understandable.
---
no... 1760 total. i dont read this thread a lot though, why?
---
Damn that's lucky, it took me 13 long clues before I got 2 rangers :(

Dunno man, but I can't see any say to prevent it. Even if they don't get into your account, it must be pretty easy to set up a program to permanently stop you form being able to get into it by maxing out the login attempts. Imagine someone doing that during a tournament or something...

If more than 1 prayer is on you can't flick it from the prayer book, it will drain at the standard rate even when flicking properly. You have to use the prayer orb if your flicking more than 1 prayer.

I feel personally attacked.... not that I could anything to stop that 😂
---
I'm not telling anyone shit, just said I was wondering. be as much of a noob as you like, my man.
---
I think they could quite possibly be brute forcing your RS password as well as your email password simultaneously, this would enable them to disable 2FA and steal all your stuff. All my accounts are user logins so I haven't had a problem, yet. Fingers crossed you're fine and whoever it is just gives up.
---
Interesting, was unaware of this. Thank you.
---
where do you get the inspiration for all these great ideas?
---
bruv idk, you know actualy who cares right tome of water is great!
---
making an ironman (btw) made me extremely aware of how broken using someone else's house is.  made an alt recently and I bought no teleports or jewellery other than house tabs to get around, questing on w330 is amazingly fast
---
The email linked to your rs acc shouldn’t be the email you use to login, make a new email. 
---
That email should be a diffferent password than your login email and your rs account password. 
---
Your rs email acc should have a different password than your rs acc login and your recovery email. 
---
Your rs account, rs email, and recovery email should all have 2 step authentication. 
---
All three different passwords you used should be unique to literally any password you’ve ever used anywhere.  
---
Unless your pc is infected you cannot be hacked if you follow the above.
---
Ah, I see the such as now. makes sense, you are correct and I'm bummed to hear it. That being said, you still dont have to be such an asshole about it. You didnt stop to think "hey maybe this guy is confused". you just jumped on this "this guy is a fucking idiot who is entitled" train and I find that pretty stupid/ and or entitled in itself.
---
I do appreciate you taking the time to explain to me why I was wrong, though. So thank you for that.
---
I didn't choose the single life, the single life chose me. So I chose Old School RuneScape .

But like *that many* though? I don't know the data on Zalcano, I would assume after a month of constant farming we would know more about its drop rates.
---
Always check prices via ge-tracker. The prices in game are almost never correct on new and high ticket items.
---
Hey there,
---
are you ever planning on introducing the **Barrows Brother's pet**? Would be cool if you'd also be able to morph the pet to be able to choose the brother following you.
---
I mean I believe it’s possible to drop up to 1200 maybe 1300 at a time.
---
Good detective work amigo
---
This is exactly what people that voted yes for warding expected when the poll failed. If the skill is simple and limited (Warding), it's labeled as boring for OSRS even tho it fits (Firemaking...). If the skill is overly exciting with multiple features and stuff (Sailing), it's labeled as RS3, a minigame or not fit for OSRS because it's way too complex, so that's a no either.
---
The reality just ends up being 75% for a new skill will never happen.

If the password to your email to your rs account gets leaked then your rs acc info is irrelevant. That’s why having a recovery email that isnt your login email is recommended.
---
Yeah, I guess I'll reset everything change and make a couple new ones, think about rebuilding but more than likely not.
---
So relatable
---
Real gamers don’t use the falador agility course
---
2fa on your email is the most valuable security measure you can have also btw. Auth on your rs acc is easily bypassed if your email is leaked. Even if your email is leaked an auth will protect you 99.9% of the time
---
It was on my pure so I have to bank really often maybe 6-8 times a task so it wouldn’t be worth it for me to pay 250k+ especially with my tiny bank. That’s definitely a solution for most people though
---
Hmm, thanks for all the info I'll make sure I do that for future references
---
Thanks this is what I was looking to hear :D
---
Yes but people are just using their own runes instead of buying them.
---
Thanks for taking your time to write this Comment.
---
I understand what you mean, but i Really do believe what made Dungeoneering Unique is the fact that you had to survive by making everything from scratch, i'm Afraid that if you ditch that Aspect most of the Uniqueness will be gone :(
---
I did however think about Replacing all the Resources inside the Dungeon with their real Variants from Gielinor so you could take them out, Meaning you could craft D'hide armour and Addy armour inside for instance, and get to keep it afterwards, this may help player shake off the feeling of being locked away from the main game when playing Arcanology.
---
More exp = less gp/exp
---
At least on the windows client - you can right light the camera icon to open the screenshot folder.
---
I think you have the order back to front
---
right click/equivalent the screenshot button on your client's frame, open screenshot folder
---
I would grab yourself a month of membership if you can swing it like others have suggested, then as a new player I would rush to meet the mins to smith cannonballs or do blast furnace. There isn't a lot of money in skilling anymore at low levels but cballs and blast furnace especially can be great.
---
Just making sure i read that correctly but not out loud

Cheers mate!

If you want AFK then do swansong then monks to 99.

If you want money do barb fishing till you can do lava eels.

if you want fast XP do barb fishing till 99.
---
May i know why are you Voting no? especially if you like this idea.
---
I made that post. I was really asking if it as worth it.
---
Im so sorry man, i started doing barrows on my pure a couple days ago.
---
I stopped after 60 chests because i got bored and the only unique i got was Karils top.
---
anything is fine tbh, the xp rates won't differ by that much
---
I realize this format is pretty tough on the Mobile, so the least i can do is supply you with a Tl'dr:
---
Delve into Arcane Ruins that are very similar to dungeons from Dungeoneering but instead of getting Xp from finishing the Dungeon, you will have to Collect Different Types of Resources and Study Arcane Transcripts that will give you Xp And blueprints for Magic Equipment.
---
When you Exit the Ruins, you can Combine the Resource you've gathered and the Knowledge you've learnt into Magical Armour and Equipment.

If it's a trade, why not do it?

Else if it involves trust where u give him first, then no.

RTX is NVIDIA’s implementation of real time ray tracing. There is dedicated hardware to achieve this on any of their cards designated as RTX instead of GTX.
---
Agreed
---
nah, I like the blade locked behind the quest. things hold much more value when you cant just throw coins at the g e and get whatever you want. id rather a good item be locked behind time and effort and not just gp. look at stuff like justiciar/rapier/prims/dfs/avernic etc. any bond warrior can just put down a quick 200$ and be in maximum gear. shits getting ridiculous. these items already worth several mills barely hold status. some items should be locked behind something other than Gp, for everyones sake.
---
Why would you need that, never needed this
---
I thought they said on release of ToB they said it doesn't scale.
---
hahahahahah wow
---
Did u lose anything ? Have you been to Draynor recently?
---
try calculating how many teleports u need to make the spending worth while.. it's probably insane
---
np i've done the math, you would need to spend 280k house tabs, not gp, tabs, to balance out into a profitable inventment savings wise. So after using 280k tele tabs to house you would start saving money...
---
It's not good nor eficient, it's just autistic.
---
Oof
---
12m in bank? I never had even close to that when I was double your stats. Sounds like your doing fine.
---
I do 3-5 man raids and I've now seen 3 items

I was at the GE... Also no. Only thing I did was activate my autheticator...

Well I’ll be dang’d. I did lunge only because the website said it needed a stabbing weapon. And the picture looked like it was stabbing. RIP me...

Thanks for looking out friend!
---
30 seconds? are you serious?
---
I play 3 accounts and use my main's house for all of them, It takes me a second to write the name down once in each acc, they have teleport outside configuration and all go to rimington, it takes no fucking time
---
If you're prepared to do it this way, it'z zero time, if you're not, and you mind banking, hopping worlds or some shit, then yeah, but you can play w30 or w18 to do this
---
Did you have a glory you might've teled by accident with?

Goto your slayer master and skip that task

Anyone wanting to do this without jailbreak or with android, you can use an rca to lightning/micro usb  adapter chain and plug it into the reversing camera input, then your reversing camera will always dispplay the phones screen, if using an android the resolution adjusts to your actualy cars resolution while ios will stretch.
---
I can't confirm this but I'm pretty sure this is some kind of server glitch their have been multiple similar reports of people not being where they logged off yesterday.
---
If they arnt contributing much how are they reducing your gp/h? Haven't done zalcano before, not 100% how it works but I know mvp gets the most

Haha I appreciate you giving me so much praise but unfortunately I was indeed just mashing it as fast as I could...

Shit, is that legit why onyx crashed so hard?
---
Yeh I was asking incase you had a small roll back to Draynor. Idk then can't imagine it was a hack if you didn't lose anything
---
Buy 1 bond it's like 30000 cannonballs
---
I'm f2p, so no
---
where though?
---
I’ve got somewhat similar combat stats, you could probably do barrows really easily. Other than that I’d suggest getting slayer to above 75 for gargoyles.
---
More self-awareness than Trump supporters. I think it's a good thing he posted it and deleted it. Shows he can tell when what he's saying isn't worth the effort, or very respectful.
---
In his defense, however, I did think Torvesta was making this shit up. A bot farm no one knows about? Big claim, considering most of the community has known about the fortress forever. Prime F2P iron man spot.
---
It’s just a meme format. In reality the colour may have different shading on areas as the lighting hits it but that’s it.
---
&gt;which proves the person's true colours, motives, and lack of integrity.

Says the Trump supporter.
---
Well that would fundamentally change the entire game so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ sorry pal, gonna have to use your mouse like the rest of us
---
Lol I just did it the other day with Max gear 99 range rigour/augury

Tiananmen Square 1989

Tried that, with 90 range msb i or k bow kills take over 6 minutes and costs load of prayer points. So imo thats not worth for me
---
My account actually got locked this morning.  I changed the pass and unlocked it but still weird.  I hopped on reddit and saw people getting password reset emails.  Jagex needs to respond to whats happening already... Can't be just a coincidence with this happening to multiple people.
---
Maybe.
---
No need for 75 range, you'll be killing the dragons with diamond (e) and ruby (e) bolts, so a rcb is sufficient.
---
OK in that case, take a few lessons on humility.
---
I did the account stalking thing, and found out that you're only 17, so I apologise for being overly harsh.
---
I also know that you're going to find this condescending and tbh there's no other way of doing this.
---
It's OK to make mistakes. When someone says "did you check your bank?" they're not calling you retarded. You don't need to flip out at them, because mature people realise that everyone sometimes makes stupid mistakes, but most importantly, that's fine. How many times do you have to help your technologically inept older relatives, and the answer is something as simple as "did you plug it in?"

Also, stick at your a levels. You can do it man.

Holy cow that’s awesome. Congrats man
---
Already been said here a few times but I will say it again, slayer... This will build your account money making power immensely. Aside from that I would say do your quests and diaries in order to flesh out some of your other skills in between slaying! And it gives you some goals to aim towards.

I'm jealous. Very jealous. Big congrats to you though

Yeah a bit, but they've done this before, and have been in decline for a few months. Meanwhile chaos runes *plummeted*
---
Thats what I figured. I was just confused how it made it into my primary folder and didn't get filtered to spam.
---
It is fairly easy to show in the email a different sender than the actual sender. So although ur mail shows that the sender is the jagex no reply, it might not actually be the jagex no reply.
---
golden rule: Never follow any links from emails regarding account details. Not for runescape, nor for any other company or website.
---
Ok? But raids is near end game and zulrah isn’t...
---
Hey guys!
---
so EpicFails made me quit Fortnite and i want to try Runescape as i loved mmo ever since.
---
Im on vacation currently so no pc here but my phone of course. If i start playing on mobil, do i play with the pc community aswell and can i just log in to that account later?
---
Thanks in advance and have a nice day!
---
Did you ask for a reset? If not then no lmao. Look at the email address too. Bogus.
---
 just log in through the website and sort it out from there so you can be 100% sure. It’s really not that complicated
---
@jagex please lock zulrah behind a harder quest than regicide
---
I used broad bolts throughout the cave. You probably didn't safe spot enough or didn't take out the rangers fast enough. It's a learning experience.
---
Probably not if it's a.jagex
---
It’s spam email looking to get your info . Ignore it
---
So do you mean where there are lesser clans or? If so, my experience is that from wilderness bosses Vet'ion has the lowest amount of clans. Also chaos elemental and lava dragons.
---
I see. That's good to know. But as you said, I didn't click anything from the first email to be safe.
---
Honestly id be totally fine if they made a quest around zulrah and lock her behind that. Discover how zulrah made the pact with the village and all that. Could be pretty dope
---
I didn’t, that’s why I’m worried, luckily my email has 2FA so I’m safe. But it sucks that they have managed to get this far through my profile to request a password reset. I’m usually very safe.
---
Attach the net to the rod
---
Never had it happen to me but you can't say it's not an exploit.
---
I think it's a little disappointing that there aren't superiors for wyrms, hydras and drakes. They should be top of the list imo
---
That’s me you’re talking about. I got tired of making chump change so grinded out everything i need for zulrah to just build up some bank. If they lock it behind sote then I’m done. A lot of shit in this game is locked behind enough junk as it is.

I don't mind at all, no she did not, but it was an influence. The relationship was toxic, she was overly suffocating. I'm glad, I'm in a much better place now with an amazing girl who I have a child with and were engaged. She also doesnt mind me playing and often tries to show an interest, even though I know she doesnt care.. its kinda cute
---
wow!, i didn't even know that possible, i mean i've gotten double rune platebodys but double ranger boots ?!?!, i would love to see the odds on that one lol.
---
Congratulations! :)

At around 90 woodcutting in the woodcutting guild (+7 invisible boost, so 97 essentially) where Yews are within like 10 tiles of a bank, I'm able to get about 250 logs an hour, which is generous. At current prices this is like ~60k an hour...if you're doing F2P where you probably have a lower WC level, you don't have a guild, or a dragon axe...your profits will be even lower. I really don't recommend woodcutting even if you're a member honestly. I just started playing RS a couple of months ago and I wish I would have rushed fishing instead of woodcutting.

Thats what I said in the second part of the comment, each item alpne is 1/418, 24 items and we are about 1/17. Lucky on amount of items, above droprate for 1/418 for a specific item, but overall he is about average.
---
Seems like it goes under The coupon collectpr problem, not collector fallacy like I mentioned even though that makes sense as well, but the main thing is that you fill most of the collection quickly but then slow down as you keep getting duplicates, and it seems like you are very close just being one coupon/card/barrows item away and you put a lot of cash into more coupons/card packs and thats how they make money off you
---
Why does everyone on reddit stalk accounts? Do you not realise how weird that is?

I don't know, after 151 there doesn't seem to be anything beneficial to unlock or no rewards for that matter.
---
The loot is scaled to how many players participate in the kill. There is a vague threshold of *contributing enough* where you go from the low loot to the high loot table and it's easy enough to make this amount even only 1-2 out of 3+ zalc phases. Its annoying cause people joining mid kill or session will scale your loot down without speeding the kill up. MVP gets a roll on both tables so doesn't make a huge amount more on the second roll (&lt;50k) but they do get a roll on the good table which is normally decent.
---
Yea but they do other things to, even my alt has done a wide range of activities I'm talking about accounts that purely exist to make gp.
---
It is real. Loads of people had this email come through this past week. Someone has a database of emails and is just sending requests randomly trying to find out who has Runescape accounts and who doesn't. I wouldn't worry too much and maybe just change your email/password and the rest of the info just in case.
---
Although many people suicide their accounts if you limited it to x amount of kills you in turn help the botters.  If they rotate 4 hours for each bot and have 500 bots.  That's only 5 rotations a day with buying 2 50 auth scripts.... allowing the accounts to last longer being they aren't suicided.  Secondly.... 2captcha.  All you'll literally do is annoy regular players with captchas.
---
MVP gets maybe 20k more on average with everyone else still getting 1-400k drops regularly assuming a 4 man team.
---
Zalcano is so toxic rn because everyone will not do a kill unless its 4 man, if you join a world they tell you to hop and if you dont they all leave and flame you, despite it being a team skilling boss...
---
Yep can switch between them as much as you want
---
yer this pic is only 2.5 years old, your still tring to be relevant. what a newb.

Every suggestion I ever put on here gets downvoted almost immediately and instead of getting comments like this i end up just saying something exactly like that to myself lmao. Also, don’t worry about it too much. Jagex hasn’t actually used a suggestion from here (aside from QoL and new content adjusting) in over two years.
---
I dont believe so at the moment. I think heard about jeg trying to add a boss under the museum you have to build to fight but i dont believe that came to fruition due to problems that arose

probably because he's the face of pking on youtube, just like a friend was the face of ironmen on youtube &amp; monni is the face of pking on twitch

Ima assume you’re on windows ten so here’s what you do, save these four pics in a folder inside your picture folder https://m.imgur.com/a/sQPwXZ6 then open one of em from the folder. Now you can switch between all rotations by just scrolling on your mouse. Shrink the window horizontally as much as it will allow and then put it on the left or right of your screen (whichever you’re most comfy with). Make sure you put the black parts of the window “off screen” so the whites of the image are riiight at the edge. Now shrink your runelite horizontally so the border covers the other black side. Now at the start of every rotation, you just have to scroll down to the one you’re on. Good way of knowing what one quickly is by splitting it into two parts. If you have melee as the second phase, you know to scroll to either magma A or B. If zulrah pops up on the outside as range or mage, you know it’s either the normal or tanzanite rotation. I’ll post a picture when i get home cos reading that back seems a bit confusing but you’ll get my point when i upload it.

That also didn’t help

Tourney worlds are the blue starred worlds IIRC.
---
It would completely change PVP
---
Yeah. Tbh he's not very difficult, but that is only said once youve had the experience and actually gone through the caves. Once ya try it tho and get first hand experience you'll see that its pretty easy and not that complicated :)
---
Better off using a better dps weapon and wearing initiate/proselyte with holy ammo slot thing that I can’t remember the name of.
---
Alright that’s kind of what I was thinking the answer would be I just didn’t know how far off the damage was between the mace and scim. And since the scim would be better than mace the whip is obviously better so I’ll stick with that!
---
Double pog

I can hear the sounds in my head now. Made that mistake more than once

Tanzoo and Virtoso just have such a good chemistry together. If they stopped splitting their videos on two different channels and made more than 1 video a week they would probably be much more popular
---
This hurt my head
---
What’s at 18?
---
The blessing? Yeah I’ve been using a blessing and a Sara sword to train strength for a while so they both give prayer bonus. But I didn’t know if switching to a whip would lower my prayer bonus enough that I would waste way more pots.
---
So we just out here stealing tweets?

What’s the easiest way to get a rune pouch on Ironman? Could I buy a t10 on my main from the ge, and suicide to my Ironman in the wilderness to give it to the Ironman?
---
With a whip 100% use that, scim is +7 accuracy and I think +11 strength, so whip would be even more!
---
Thanks for sharing
---
In a word, yes, but you'll likely use more. 
---
Simply, the Scimitar is a 4 tick weapon whereas the mace is 5 tick.
---
Now as a direct comparison on stats, the Scimitar has something like +10 melee strength over the mace. In addition, the Mace has high crush but the Scimitar's slash bonus is even higher than the Mace's crush bonus.
---
Ultimately, with faster DPS (using the Scimitar), you are more likely to use less prayer potions than the +5 prayer bonus from the mace.
---
As a sidenote, Aberrant Spectres are the last thing to worry about prayer potion cost on. Ranarrs are fairly common as a drop. You'll likely yield an equivalent amount of Ranarrs for Prayer Potions used.
---
Roving Elvis. Always one step behind seeing him live. Not this time.
---
It took a lot of “phone usage” as in I had to be actively playing a lot to get it cause I flipped and alched for it. And I wanted something more AFKish and exp rewarding
---
yes
---
presumably if smithing got reworked, mining would get reworked as well, and rune would switch to being the same level for mining as smithing the bars. Just reworking one without the other would make even less sense
---
Fremmy exiles at rune fest?
---
Yeah it's actually 7/14 exactly
---
If it's too annoying and the pkers are as bad as you say, just do trips of 100-150 noted and a tank setup. Better exp that way too. That's what I did to 99 and didn't die once.
---
yeah, which would be very bad I reckon
---
Yeah I never had a problem making my money back on spectres but that was just the example that came to mind. Thanks for the breakdown!
---
Nah but with like actual fishing rods :I
---
If you’re training strength the ss is good. Use prayer armour and even a god cape if you don’t have fire cape. That’ll be as good as it gets. I mean you could throw in holy sandals but you’ll want some offensive bonus to kill things faster. A fury has prayer bonus also I believe

Go to the Makeover Mage and turn your player into a dog. That’s the only way to put the double rangers to use

Emblem farmers, at least tge bots, have been pretty well wiped out

Nice.

I too share that sentiment, however, if you're doing things like Vorkath, sometimes it is just easier to directly teleport to your home rather than someone elses. 
---
After all, it all adds up.
---
good luck, and btw void is a good investment of time especially if u have hard western diaries done. but u can do it whenever since vorkath is one of those special cases void is bis for.

Yes I do

I used to bring antifire shield to lesser demons (just in case)
---
I really wish they would make that option toggleable.
---
What makes you think its not?
---
I was using a regular dragon crossbow or acb before but even after buying a dhcb, my kills were still 2:30 and only 2 per trip.
---
 After buying Rigour, which fell to about 50m now (big investment) , I instantly started getting 3 kills per trip and eventually 4-5 with more practice. Rigour makes an enormous difference. I think I'd still be getting 3-4 kills per trip even without the dhcb just because of Rigour.
---
Why do you think people associate tv series with thieving? It’s boring af but that’s what it was back in the day. If you compare all the conveniences that modern day games have to OS you’re just gonna hate it.

...my house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

I started doing fishing/cooking for now to get stuff ready for RFD, needed a goal to work towards, kind of got overwhelmed with all my low stats lol couldn’t decide which I wanted to level up. I was grinding crafting/smithing/fletching the other day making snakeskin shields just to boost them up a little and got bored with the “lack of action” so I started doing slayer and realized I need better equipment which means more money.
---
No?
---
It's max gear now, but not max stats.
---
Void range elite, dhcb, salve ei, archer ring I, avas assembler, pegasian boots, dragonfire ward, dragon bolts e ruby/diamond.

Even with all of this I was still only getting 2 kills per trip without rigour lol

I’d be happy if I can find a solid team that will teach me raids.

Very high chance someone else was on your account. Authenticator on your account is not enough, if you really want to be secure, ensure your recovery email is different from your login email. Then put 2-step authentication on your recovery email.

We're not talking about other MMOS. Other MMOS have shitty "Kill 20 goblins and collect 5/5 goblin asses" as quests, and runescape has amazing unique quests, should we stoop to the level of shitty mmo quests too? Should we have action bar combat, because other MMOs do it? What other MMOs do is completely irrelevant, firstly, just cause it's a different thing, and secondly because osrs is very unique,
---
Is dwh really that good?
---
One small flavour
---
Basically RFD
---
Actually yeah. I found out that if I click a shark on the exact same tick as my attack begins, I eat at the same time without wasting a tick. I also normally only eat during his acid splash when possible.
---
Hi, thanks for taking the time to answer my question. So it's basically the drop table that got "buffed"? Not the combat level of the mobs/health etc?
---
Nice now you dont need to use placement
---
Prayer flicking wasn’t actually designed to be a thing. People just discovered you can save prayer points by flicking and manipulating the tick system. Adds a skill ceiling that isn’t absolutely necessary for 99% of content but rewards the people that do it. That’s why they left it in. A lot of people weren’t a fan of flicking when it caught on but that was their reasoning and i can see why. Don’t wanna do it? Use more pots. Wanna do it? Sure, but be prepared to be a human metronome .
---
well if  you mine your own ore its pure profit
---
Jesus I’m 1k kc no tassets and I thought that was bad, you are well over due.
---
Anyone who doesn't do attack on left, strength to the right, def to the right of that if applicable, and then ppots... is a horrible person
---
You waste gp by using these gloves instead of the rogue's set gloves.

Big oof for sure

Can also just hide NPC attack options for pickpocketing

Visiting a friend who’s in town?

Not quite. Someone will get the last ore in that vein and close the vein for everyone else, making the last ore something to fight over. This does pretty significantly effect xp rates as well as having the closest spots to the sack available to you.

Oh no, you said the big bad word. Your suggestion is now invalid.

Have the runelite devs fiddled with the loot tracker? Not been on for a bit and looks different. Or I’m just remembering it wrong.
---
The rough thing on blowpipe with super anti + pray mage the breath attacks can hit a 10, the range attack is more frequent than the mage attack and has 5 higher max hit.
---
With DHCB and antifire shield + super antifire pray range the breath attacks do 0 damage, and you're getting hit by the weaker and less frequent mage attack
---
I got two of these emails in the past couple days as well.
---
Idk man if i saw this girl on tinder(assuming that this is the only pic i get and ignoring the fact that profiles with only 1 pic ate sus af) id go for it and take my chances that none of thats true. A lot of girls take weird angle selfies like this where you cant see half their face nowadays. Shes not ugly shes just mainstream.

Turns out it was just chestbrah trying to insure his new lambo

A taste of nope. Spiders. Spiders everywhere.

Do you have Authenticator on your Runescape account, and some form of 2FA on your email account?
---
I don't know if I'm honest, I've only just recently started playing again after a year break.
---
Oh I thought there was a whole mechanic I didn’t know about lol
---
Unless if there's a ragger following me for 35 minutes

I think he's hoping they will show the password reset link in the screenie like one user did in another thread :(

lol no actually. i was just waiting for my food and noticed it. laughed way too hard

Get dragon ruby (e) for 100 specs

How do you know it's a bot and not an alt?

&gt;  Imitation is the highest form of flattery.

If that was that. Imitation here means stolen potentional revenue.

It's at least understandable why people want to protect their position.

Yes, you have a better chance of getting drops compared to how it worked before and the monsters remain unchanged.

What is the record for fastest time to max?
---
You sir, are a real class act, you blocked out his name.  That goes to show you are already exponentially more mature than this sad sad little man.
---
keep going. it was like that for me. in the 110-135 chest count i got super luck and got 7 unique. if i would have sold them it would be like 10m. It was a good day. im almost at 300kc and im almost finished with Dh, Ahrims, and verock. Need Dh plate, Ahrim hood, and verock flail. you will get to a point that everytime you get a drop you will want to do more for another. plus it can be a decent money maker.
---
I see no genuine reason why this is a bad idea. Why not?
---
Some of us aren’t on twitter tho. But yes a credit would be nice
---
Saw these guys last night, definitely seemed out of place

They just seem fatter and I don’t remember there ever being a “time remaining” i like it.

The best time to get P2P is before you complete tutorial island.

Unless you're gonna buy a bond on the GE for it with GP for another account, then you can do tutorial island and run to the GE in F2P.
---
To be fair there is like 7k people with a max cape so statistically its likely
---
Way less competition at hill giants.  And yeah crabs til 99 if you stay with no overheads
---
Exactly my point. I expanded in another comment.
---
Rigour is huge because the def bonus is sneaky good. Obviously the ranged bonus is the big get, but the def helps a lot. For anyone reading this who can't afford rigour, turn on steel skin, eagle eye, protection prayer as your quick prayers. The def will help you squeeze out an extra kill quite often
---
I'm a betting man. I'd bet heavily against the idea that this person has anything vaguely resembling happiness in their life. 
---
Sure, normal people can be jerks, but that? That isn't coming from a normal person. It's grossly inappropriate to say that to someone who deserves it, much less some random guy just trying to be helpful.
---
Kill the ragger
---
6 mins with craws bow? are you not range potted up? My range is like 7 levels less than that and i have killed faster.
---
I'm saying that because they kept it in despite the fact that it wasn't designed to be a thing and they made similar mechanics like prayer switching requirement for certain content, like Jad, shows a shift in game play that needs to be represented with an easier to control method. I don't believe prayer flicking takes any amount of skill or has a skill ceiling, it's just a pain to do because of the really old ui.
---
I've heard a lot of people have. In my case I also had someone I recently met and was playing with acting very strangely which caused me to be extra careful. They were asking personal questions and nudging me to log out. Probably just coicidence but I didn't want to take any risks.
---
I used blessed dhide, and brimstone ring. You got better gear then me. I was 75 def and 84range
---
I just did the quest the other day with 78 ranged, God d'hide and this fight was all down to the ruby dragon (e) procs. Took 3 tries to beat him, so with karils it should be doable if you get the right rng.
---
Ye its nice
---
Use nezi or verac helm for tank gear
---
Nice
---
Haha thanks!
---
Tbh i really wanted to keep his name it to play a little game of "Shaming" but decided not to in the end because it was going down to his level, and would also probably lead to this post getting deleted due to Privacy Reasons.
---
I usually put att, str, def potions in a vertical line in inventory
---
Yes, it's 1/1k for each slot of the clue to hit rangers, so if each of the rolls hits that 1/1k you got 5 rangers.
---
Thank you!
---
Wonder if the JMods can refund you the ~£170 or ~$200 dollars you paid for the 'vpn'
---
What is the difference between a gold farmer and a bot? Is one like a real person getting paid? Or what is it?
---
My range is only 66 which doesn’t help either. I’m really just tryna do it as fast as I can. Magic seems the fastest. It’s also my highest combat skill

You're best bet would be standing 2 tiles away from him and running up and down the boat in a straight line to avoid the bombs. Make sure you're zoomed out enough to see exactly when he launches his firebreath attack. And have audio cues on incase you dont see it

Tbh I think you kinda had that one coming, OP. Shouldn't have been a fake fuck. /s
---
Depends; if you are asking from a "what should i train" perspective, the answer tends to be most of them to some extent without one being far more useful. Mainly you'd want all the combat skills; Melee and Ranged both good damage, Prayer protects from damage, Magic gives Teleports and Magic Defence, and Defence and HP help you not die.
---
If you're asking more from the "what do you think is more useful" like you'd ask what is your favorite skill, I'd say Magic. While it is generally inferior for combat compared to Melee and Ranged, Magic offers a lot more utility. Aside from being useful in some combat situation, it also makes up most of your defence again magic. It also gives teleports, lunar skilling spells, and necromancy prayer training.

Not all heroes wear capes...some wear assemblers.

You generally lose money killing Bronze/Iron/Steel dragons and their xp is crap. I use slayer dart for afk experience

Do not camp these without anguish and blowpipe under any circumstance, you have been warned

Oh no
---
This doesn’t actually work. It ends up just adding the eating delay to your next attack, so you’re not gaining any dps
---
Its not fake just an old ass picture OP is just reposting for karma.
---
Construction is one of the most useful non combat skill when it comes to both PvM and PvP. Its far from useless or limited.
---
Dang haven’t seen a post like this before ...
---
100% of the polls would say slayer/qol and even quests take priority over a new skill.
---
I agree it’s one of the most useful, but it lacks something.

People got the reference it's just painfully unfunny so no one reacted

I used to watch torvesta then I realized every video he does is just s Framed video a month later I decided to save my time.  He also has weird justification for shit - I'm DH bombing and saving my gear so there's no risk but it's ok because I'm exposing a known bug

Yes a mithril scimitar is only used for a very narrow range of levels (20-30 attack) before it is replaced by a better weapon (adamant scimitar). You should get 30 attack and then sell the mithril scimitar on the grand exchange to put the fold pieces towards buying an adamant scimitar.

&gt; Jagex has had data breaches in the past
---
Which ones, aside from Jed?
---
&gt;Until Jagex is properly called out on this they'll never take it entirely seriously. Something needs to change with the way they handle hacked accounts as until then there is still very little downside for hackers and gold sellers.
---
I can assure you that Jagex take actual data breaches very seriously. What they don't care much about is people getting hacked because they were phished from an obvious dodgy email or they downloaded dodgy clients.
---
As you said, they would face legal repercussions if they had a *known* data breach of PII and they did not report it. People often think they have to report it publicly within 72 hours, but that's not true they just have to report to the DPA within 72 hours of the breach **being known about**, not since the breach happened. They then have to tell people that are affected by their PII being breached without undue delay.
---
You could do blast furnace I guess
---
Depending on what you wear you can tank them all. I have worn god hide and been able to kill jad.
---
Yeah I thought of trying that but that would be just a shit ton in dragon darts

Insulting people won't help.

If you think there's been an actual data breach contact the ICC, or go to /r/legaladviceuk, who will also tell you to just contact the ICC.

Yes sir, both of those were huge grinds for me. Took me 7m in cannonballs and 22k goblins for my champion scroll! Barrows is pretty good for those elite clues
---
Just so you know it’s max hit isn’t a guantees one shot. I believe it’s like 95, so brewing over your max hp can let you tank a hit if you mess up. I did speed runs when going for pet and I brewed up to like 116 hp or whatever it was and let it hit me purposely to hit it back with a huge vengeance
---
Definitely unlock it before, free trips while you're doing it on slayer. Beats grinding it out after.
---
~600m is the biggest possible
---
Nice try, youtuber
---
It was removed from lumbridge because it wasnt a good image for new players to be getting off tutorial island and see people just splashing away. IMO that turns people away from the game when thats their first sight of the actual player base

HAHAHA brooo im telling you its so bad, i chill to the maximum for the first 62 waves and out of nowhere its like i forget the 4 hours worth of jad videos ive studied front to back

The we do raids discord is pretty good about teaching new players, get yourself some elite void, BGS, blowpipe, a whip, and around 80 combat stats and they should take you in a learner raid no problem, get ahold of their discord and you'll be able to find the minimum requirements! That's where I got my kc

The joke in COD was don’t speak Russian because they wanted to commit mass murder and make it seem like it was the Americans 
---
If they wanted to make this joke for RuneScape it should have said: remember no Gielinor

Saying no spinners makes no sense, the Russians from the cod game aren’t purposefully missing certain people (spinners) like this joke implies. It doesn’t work cause it doesn’t make any sense

Hell yeah east side for life

This doesn't make any sense, how would a VPN help you in this situation?

yeah i laughed too, so fuck that guy im gonna fuck him in the eye socket

Book of law gives range attack not strength.

With what kind of logic would a VPN prevent keyloggers..?

Fastest would be to grind 99 Strength, then Attack and then Defense but I think you'll generally be fine just whipping on controlled or whatever.

Ruby bolts e (the adamant version) worked great for me.

Gear isn't the problem- the whole fight relies on you doing mechanics and hoping for bolt procs.

Now trim it so you can flex on those noobs
---
I also got one. My theory is that someone is checking if logins exist by using the password reset feature. If the email is sent you know you are dealing with a real login name. After that they probably start brute forcing with a library of the most common passwords. This explains the complaints about people being locked out of their accounts. If your email is secure and your password is strong you probably have nothing to fear.

Could be worse...

I'm not actually. I just like how unique the account is. Thought it would make an interesting skiller.
---
* The non scientific conclusion
---
Would you say it’s inferior mostly because of the cost to use it full time?

I like using magic, I usually just can’t justify the rune cost over extended periods of time as a mid-level account. Stuff like Barrows being the exception where I make it back.

---
okay, and until i actually start hitting higher levels of str/attack, will 80-85 defense even make a noticeable difference in my bossing?
---
I think the fake emails are the ones that say the password/email has already been changed. Jmods said they would never send mails to tell you the email has been changed and instead they send mails to tell you someone requested a change.
---
They're likely just requesting password changes for all emails on leaked email lists for some reason

What's the info tho

How is it a detriment

Lol, the type of rhetoric seen in the image is present and openly defended on every gaming sub, this one included. Hypocrites much

This was me last week, but I just moved all my wealth to my wife's account, which we have a known history of sharing large amounts of wealth back and forth depending on the activity and she's newer so she borrows stuff.

I think he stands by what he posted but he didn't want it to come across as an attack but rather criticism, but it's hard to word it as such
---
Aye Columbus
---
I currently have like 82 attack and 81 defense.  I don't think it matters too much, but I am also not doing too much bossing really.  
---
However, I have been learning Vorkath on the tournament worlds, first using maxed stats and later adjusting to my real stats and I will tell you that it is certainly more forgiving when I make a mistake and have to tank a hit to have higher defense but overall it doesn't make too much of a difference.
---
Well, I think heals 6 so it’d be 4 damage instead of 10 but I’d be open to it doing none or still healing 6 and ignoring damage, I don’t know
---
Mainly cost but also DPS. Even if cost wasn't a factor, Magic is generally weaker than Melee and Ranged unless the creature is specifically weak to Magic. Though at lower levels, I think Magic can be stronger due to how its max hits work.
---
Still, if you have a choice between a D Scim, an MSB, or Iban's Blast, you'd probably pick anything but Iban's Blast for something like say Fire Giants since the rune cost is a bit much and the damage, while probably not terrible, will likely be comparable or lower since Magic casts a bit slow compared to Scimitars and Shortbows. But at somewhere like Barrows, Archeologist Bosses, Rex, etc then you'd want to use a spell like Iban's Blast over the other options.
---
Just go get the fire cape and you can stop pretending that you aren't embarrassed
---
Lol wow I feel so silly! I was nowhere near prepared for this battle! It’s amazing I was able to defeat him. Thank you for your insight wise one 🙏
---
I rarely lag on house world which I believe is US and I play in UK. Especially if you get rid of chat effects or hide chat all together. I don't have to hop worlds if I log into that world to start.
---
Good goal is to complete all F2P quests. Good luck hope to see you back playing. Everyone is still just as dumb as they were 10 years ago.
---
It is definitely worth it, there is a ton of new content since you last played. Not to mention, mobile has made it really easy to play. I play probably 1 hour a day, but I do farm runs multiple times throughout the day. On my days off, probably 3-4 hours
---
That's an awesome first 99, and insanely impressive that you got it back in 2002. I may have started playing in 2001, but I never accomplished anything of note until Skillscape were released and caused **mass** motivation across the entire game population.

As someone from the Northwest Chicago suburbs all I can say is I just made that up.

Yeah I'm a long way off bossing thankfully. I mainly use it for Phials who unotes my pure ess, get quick and free healing and run energy, then fairy ring straight by nature altar. I also high alch whilst running. It's fun for an hour or so whilst fairly click intensive, but I'm leveling two skills and earning money at the same time.

pwople these days

smh
---
AND FUCKING FUCKED MY LAST PRAYER
---
Read the humor tag troll. This game is infested with bots
---
btw I play an Ironman, those tears are my for the dwh
---
Try having an untrimmed Prayer cape.
---
It does feel a bit broken from when I last played runescape for sure.
---
DHCB is absolutely insane. My PB dropped by 30 seconds compared to blowpipe (1:16 now at 95 range and no Rigour) and you take way less damage, so it's easy to extend trips.

Rune c bow is way less dps than msb i or k bow

,,oh this game has a huge problem with bots, lets allow them" wtf man.
---
What's your combat level ?
---
incredibly dangerous though with social engineering
---
Sir you belong in r/woooosh
---
Gratz man!
---
Thankfully I'm not bossing and mainly use it for getting around and nature running. Little to no lag when I turn chat off.
---
I just read the QnA and people were talking about getting more exp while playing and doing the quests. I am not sure if I got it correct. Do they mean more exp for the same things on f2p or it's just the unlocked features which help us get more exp?
---
I'm pretty sure Zulrah is crap money these days unless you are a total pro at it and can crank out high kills /hr.  And even then it's only decent, not great.
---
If you're into combat you should go for either hill giants for their limpwurt roots with melee or ogress warriors with ranged/mage for their rune weapons and various runes and also gems.
---
Skilling your best bet is probably get 55 magic and high alch rune 2hs/legs/skirts and other stuff that profits well, otherwise crafting gold necklaces is pretty good and afk. Mining and sell anything above copper and tin is good too but high effort and bots can be annoying.
---
If you have the guts for it you can also buy rune stuff at ge and sell at bandit camp in wildy for great profit, but very risky with pvpers.
---
Yew logs are ok only if you really enjoy woodcutting.
---
&gt;The currency isnt hyper inflated. Items aren't worth either nothing at all or everything.

It is hyper inflated but there's too many items too so they cancel eachother out.
---
Thank you, although no cape i was defeated at same time next try is the cape for sure i feel it
---
Lmfaooo
---
Dwh is probably the single most important pvm item to get. You need it to efficiently do zammy, bandos, kq, cox, tob, vet'ion, sire, and probably others I can't remember. You can for sure do all this without a dwh, but it helps a ton.

Summer pies, stamina pots, prayer potions and some prayer gear. That's all you need honestly. When you fall activate prayer and run to rope. Keep summer pieing to the max. Maybe take a couple brews as well in case the pies aren't enough heals for the fall damage.
---
Good luck!
---
OP is an ironman pure so he gets about 50 kills per hour
---
Die
---
You're better off just bringing a couple guthix rests and tick eating mage attacks. Then you can just eat to full between kills.

Another Slice of 'Nam

Good luck :) I just did fletching while merchanting or whenever I didn't really want to do anything active. Gotta have something to do when bankstanding :p
---
un-screw me, my amigo

Honestly, streaks like this are partly shy I've not even bothered starting  the grind on my iron man.  
---
Making such an essential item for lategame PvM a bullshit 1/5000 drop from a trivial monster that is harder to find a world for than to kill is bizarre.
---
Wow!
---
I work for a home heating oil company. It's very slow this time of year, just need to enter some orders here and there. I leave room on my desktop to see if there are any emails coming in while I play, lol. I also got 90 fishing and 90+ all 3 melee stats while at work this summer
---
Shut your scrawny pimple ass up bitch.
---
 Dont have an Ironman (not a chance) but I think this would be a cool concept. 
---
Although I think it would be a better idea if maxed ironmen got a gold trimmed Ironman armour set. This way nobodies ‘max cape’ gets devalued, and maxed ironmen get something cool.
---
It’s not. It’s quite a bit worse.
---
my name jeff
---
I'm still taking a lot of mage damage, even with rigour, but I don't have  ward and only have 79 mage. Depending on how many mage attacks it does, I can either go a kill without eating, or go through half an inventory of food if I'm really unlucky.
---
Raiding is higher gp than vorkath lol
---
How do you mean, good world? I thought the order was always the same.
---
Edit: I read the rest of the replies, guess I was wrong.
---
The bolts are same as rune while the arrows and javs are between rune and dragon, so it isn't super consistent as it is. The darts could be same as rune or perhaps slightly weaker in some way; or just same as rune but you make less per mineral than normal (e.g. 4 dart tips instead of 10).

\&gt;Are you able to debate what people actually say or are you only able to debate against the strawmen of your own creation?

I mean youve originally claimed that Clintons been to some "pedo island" without proof, then retreated from that and said that Clinton has been on some "lolita express" 26 times (I assume you chose that number because its easy to remember since theres no actual backup for that number) without proof, and then are deliberately ignoring extensive proof of Trump and Ep being party bros for a decade.
---
Youre free to continue to believe that calling your arguments pure imagination is a strawman (I assume its just the flashcard buzzword that was at the top of the stack), but that would also be an exercise in creativity.
---
Huh interesting. I was like 95 ranged when i started vorki so i never considered karils. That being said ill be sure to remember and pass this on...
---
Tbh i dint think vork is worth doing &lt;80 ranged unless you expect &lt;1m/hr
---
But why purple again?
---
I might be able to help, send me a dm
---
People alch them for profit

Not gunna lie bro this looks extremely dodgy. If you did really transfer money across and you were accidentally banned, BOTH accounts would have been banned. The supplier and the mule. They wouldn't have just banned the person buying gold, but first of all the person selling it. I think you've directly RWT on the "mule" and it's been banned before you've had chance to trade it to your main. Also, you seem like you have a really good account and I'm sure your bank is worth much more than 250m
---
Why does it matter? You’re just going to get a copy pasted response about going to the support center in the runescape website. Jagex is such a fucking joke lmao

I trained Agility, then can't use it in f2p you say? "Wtf is that even supposed to mean"

At the very least you get to see that you've gotten the pet more than once in your collection log book, which is kinda cool

That was really positive for me and yes what you say makes sense.

I have started with my new journey on OSRS and heck did I enjoy the nostalgia for the first hour I played.
---
The fastest possible method in the game isn’t vorkath. Lava running is more, Cox is more, tob is more, being a ba leech seller is more. Astral running is more. Swapping is more. Shit I’m sure there more methods I’m not thinking of. 
---
Vorkath is insane but it’s not the stand alone god of making money in this game lol.
---
Stupid question. Can each tag tab have the same items in each?  Like have my graceful in the farming AND tag tab?

Based on your post history you got hacked and want jagex to help. People who don't go to shady websites or share accounts don't get hacked.
---
Essence miners hate him!!!
---
Oh right I didn't realise the difference was that much! And I think you're correct, if he did accidentally get banned, both accounts would have got banned. His main would have looked like a RWT supplier, the fact that his "mule" has only been banned proves that he didn't get chance to trade it over to his main yet.
---
The bolts aren’t amethyst bolts. They’re broad bolts with amethyst tips. 
---
Idk I get what you’re saying but overall it just wouldn’t make sense. Best bet just leave amethyst how it is, useless unless you’re an Ironman

Yes the context is wrong but I still enjoyed the meme and got a laugh out of it.
---
People are just unaware of the maths. Time cost of login into random names is 5 secs, + 2-5 secs loading house. The name-cost is just once a session cuz these people don't usually log out.
---
Let's say it spends 10 seconds.
---
Let's say construction training / house planing is zero time.
---
And let's say you only spend time on making the gp, at 1M/H that early on.
---
20M is 1-83 with cheap methods.
---
20H are 72M seconds.
---
10 second per use would take you to use 7,2M times other people's POH for any use for being less efficient than just "investing" on having it on your own.
---
Now downvote the maths, cuz they will obviously hurt your feelz
---
It's the same with prayer, over 80 the extra points per dose require a fucking ocean of doses to start being a factor that actually saves costs/time past a consuming threshold that is so big no player is really gonna reach.
---
I wouldn't be talking fat warrer, your a lvl 109 rofl !!

if you're bringing a blowpipe ur darts fall to the ground without a ranging cape slot item, crystal bow is the best weapon to use on armadylian guards in the wildy if 3/4iteming

I prob max out at 1m/hr although I haven't done vork or SOTE

Have you ever even tried to get a response from jagex bro? I don’t understand why my post history has anything to do with the OP, nice try at derailing lmfao.

Mazchna would be best until 30 Slayer, Vannaka best until 45 Slayer, and Chaeldar best until 50/65 Slayer. I think that's healthy progression and usage of lower level slayer masters personally.

I think requiring 1.3m slayer xp from someone instead of 100 combat and 100k slayer xp is more than enough cost-wise.

There's players who don't prioritize melee, and they prefer/enjoy range and magic. It can be really frustrating to be a few combat levels off the next slayer master, but have it require a lot of range/magic levels.
---
Combat level is biased towards melee. Despite it being two stats, you can have like 5m range xp and be nowhere near the combat level you'd be if you had 2m attack+ 2m str xp.
---
Giving players who don't prioritize melee healthy progression through Slayer masters is a pretty genuine reason imo.
---
Almost completed all the fossil island skeletons from woodcutting those mushroom trees.
---
It was fun collecting those fossils: any other similar grinds in osrs while I’m still in the mood ?
---
kk yes thats what i mean. its pretty fast and has the bank which is great. there is the fremmenick sea boots if you are super high level but imo its really dumb and is a waste of an inventory slot anyways. When you get dhcb make sure to use dragon ruby bolts (e) as well as dragon diamond bolts (e). very worth while.

You seem so incredibly thin-skinned and hell-bent on trying to gain brownie points. For what? You *know* this type of stuff happens everywhere on the Internet. It's been happening since the inception of the internet, for as long as I can remember. I get that you don't like getting yelled at and especially in this manner. But posting it openly on here, even though you blocked out his name, seems incredibly shallow.
---
All this post looks like is 'hey guys, look how pietous I am exposing this evil-doing!' But all you're doing in reality is showing us that this guy affected you pretty heavily, else you wouldn't have felt the need to post about this whatsoever.

This post is the equivalent of someone telling you 'well, in Spain they have bullfighting' and you'd respond with 'Damn, there's crazy people in this world'. There is nothing the other person can do with a response like that, yet that's the response you're looking for.

How are you killing vork? Dhcb and rigour will be best. Anything else - still probably rigour.
---
My brother actually did this back in 2008. I didn't get banned but received a smackdown from my parents for "using their credit card without their approval".
---
Somewhat unrelated but my dog also chewed up my homework once, got a day of detention for that one.
---
What? I don’t understand why this has to do with my recent hack. If you have an issue with a bug, the jagex website has a bug report page. If you ask the support twitter, they will give you a copy pasted response linking you the support page for bug reports. It’s really inconvenient. Just scroll down at all the retweets from the support page. It’s just nothing but copy pasted responses linking back to the support page on the runescape website lmao. What’s the point of the twitter support then?
---
Haha first time?
---
Great job
---
&gt;or potentially it flagged some system, a large amount of GP being transferred to an account made within the hour.
---
More likely this.
---
That plus the fact you used a VPN made it look like you were selling your cash and the person buying was using a fresh acc to prevent theirs from being banned.
---
Only with Rune Arrows or better. With addy arrows Rune Cbow with broad bolts is better dps.

Yeah, tag tabs are separate from bank tabs. You can have an item in as many tag tabs as you want but only one bank tab. For example, I have my blowpipe in my ranging bank tab, as well as in my dag kings tag tab, CoX tag tab, and Hydra tag tab. Tag tabs are runelite, bank tab is jagex.

Just get back to the question and answer part of the Q&amp;A stream. Hard concept to understand, I know..
---
Damn dude, you probably eveb made a loss then.. always google an item on the ge tracker if you don't knoe the actual worth
---
Nah that’s pretty much spot on. This Reddit false narrative that all PvPers are toxic is dumb. Yeah PvP community is toxic to EACH OTHER. But honestly majority or PvP and pvmer encounters I’ll argue the pvmers are more toxic. The pvpers are there because it’s the only place they can do what they enjoy and then pvmers act surprised when they get attacked and die (especially when they have zero food or even fucking dhide). I’ve been apart of a lot of big PvM CC’s and I can safely say that there’s nothing more toxic than if you mess up special orders, miss ticks attacking, etc. pvpers mainly focus their toxicity on each other and whether that’s right or wrong I don’t really care but it’s just kinda their culture.
---
Or maybe he is the first and last Slayer master. Once you get 90+ Slayer (or whatever reqs) you can return to him and he notices how much you have progressed and changes what he assigns to higher level stuff.
---
That's true for most items on the unique drop table (elegant items have double the rarity) but not for items off of the standard drop table. If you successfully roll the unique drop table then from there al of the uniques (other than elegant) have the same drop rate, but the chance of getting any medium clue item isn't equal since the standard drop table items have a much more common drop rate. [Here's the full drop table.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Reward_casket_(medium) )

I mean op made 48 mil. I'm not sure how you could "make a loss"

Damn bro I missed it. I'm even playing at work I just didn't see it in time.

Yeah, the guy who first trains you turns out to be some weird guy chilling out in the sewer.

I usually get membership before I start Tutorial Island. In essence, I don't ever use F2P at all, even for alts.

how is this calculated? with standard deviations &amp; p stat?
---
He ain't wrong tho
---
Reread what I said. "***part time*** minimum wage" as in they are dependent on their parents/family and don't care.
---
I’ll keep at it. Maybe switch over to better bolts to take out the rangers faster.
---
The good thing, more time consuming for an iron of course, is if you can get an open spot on Zeah, you can use a cannon and kill them with that + your best range weapon. Kills take maybe a minute and you’re always hitting more than one. Pretty rapid fire

---
Sold my rapier for 99 prayer. I know the feeling lol
---
My PB is somewhere around 240, had a picture of it but can't find it. Basically if anyone is curious the tears run on a pattern (different each world) and if you figure out the pattern you can plan when and where you need to move by observing the fountain you're on and observing the ones around you. I generally keep track of 3 streams at a time (ie a wall) and if I'm feeling really cheeky I will hop worlds looking for an optimal pattern. This is obviously not necessary but an interesting thinking challenge
---
It could be because summer is coming to an end and kids are going back to school. Prices seem to go crazy at the start and end of summer. - IE, prayer potions a month or two ago
---
Prob people buying it and low ones sold out leaving the higher prices
---
Just bp and elite void, I definitely am not close to affording a dhcb and like fighting other bosses too
---
So it fell to 160mil due to fear that the Blade of Saeldor was going to devalue it. However, people quickly realized that the blade and the rapier have completely different use cases and they pretty much don't effect each other's prices.
---
The rapier had been going slowly before the Song of the Elves quest and once it returned to its original price it just continued to go up like it had been doing. The drop to 160mil was basically a fluke.
---
Tanky McTankface
---
Im sorry i forgot to mention im an ironmeme thats why im doing arma :).
---
You have to collect pages in the forthos dungeon for a miniquest and champion scrolls for the champions cape (the latter will take a long time).
---
I rushed 99 Magic in a few days after I got the Prayer because I didn't want to be associated with wallet warriors.
---
Aw, completely get your point about the potential to hold out for an extra few mil, but dude just got over 1000% more than he was okay with getting for the item. That's an awfully full glass to label half-empty.
---
I mean I don’t PvP at all but I vote yes to PvP updates that seem to make sense because I care about everyone being able to enjoy the game like I get to.
---
Putting an item for sale for even 1 gp will sell for the highest current buy offer in the ge. He would have got the same amount putting the offer in for 48m. It was a risk that no one had a buy offer and he could have likely made slightly more by waiting but he didn't get screwed over with the price.
---
They do have lots of othee things to do, they just choose not to do it.
---
Ahh damn. I had bought one for 160 and saw it going up and sold for 171. Now I’m regretting selling it.

---
Simple probability: 1 - ((X-1)/X)^X =~ 0.63.
---
So ((X-1)/X)^X is the probability that you hit non rangers X times, subtract it from 1 to get the probability of the complement.
---
No you aren’t lol, did you not pay any attention? You’re playing a deep cover American agent. That’s why you get shot in the head by makarov at the end, and he says something along the lines of “this is the message”.
---
"boring" is subjective.  I find corrupted gauntlet boring, its easy and unrewarding.  Sure rune dragons might be boring but at least they are rewarding and leading to account progression.
---
he's self projection 99
---
Conversely, I went to Vannaka at basically minimum reqs and got 16 bronze dragons. Instant cancel for me.

Fuck yeah, that's a happy surprise. Go treat yourself. :)

---
Thanks, that's exactly what I wanted to know. I'm pretty efficient at training these kinds of skills, so I usually just take the theoretical maximum and subtract 15% to get my roughly estimated xp/hr.
---
Oh ok think I'm understanding it a little more. So theres a lot of mundane questions that people have already, and y'all have already answered, that gets repeated often. 
---
But what makes a question interesting? Are simple yes or no question no good? Do you guys have guidelines that you follow on whether or not you can  answer questions? Is it possible to make these guidelines public? I guess my main question is how you decide to answer questions. Obviously upvotes, but what else? Do you think we need a database of answered questions? Kinda like a /r9k/ mode for the Q&amp;A threads?
---
Momentarily, until it is filled by the item you get from the jar
---
Oh that's cool, I didn't know. The wiki say they require hop seeds, and mentions nothing about herb seeds. I understand that though, I was wondering why hop seeds aren't stupid expensive right now.
---
What the fuck
---
Pssst, people will disagree but if you don't have a lance I would totally recommend you grab that first! I waaaay prefer it at vorkath and at olm you will spend a lot more time on the melee hands than the head. Also allows you to do rune dragons for some chill 1m/H content.
---
Def not locked. Easily possible to get most of those without dwh.
---
Barrage dusts is a good one
---
the zulrah calc has a tbow calculation inside. thats pretty much max gear. 2.9m profit/h - supply cost of approx 1m/h.
---
Going consistently above 24 kills/h would be only possible using dragon darts on your BP and a sanguinesti staff . Which would in turn decrease your net profit.
---
And no sorry. Zulrah is not 5m/hr. Maybe you have misstyped your "10k kc". All the drops would have to double in value for that statement to be true. Alchables will never go above alch price. Zul-andra-tps are ultra low compared to a year ago. Scales have stabilized at a price below 180. Not one update in the past year has caused prices to double. Yeah, Zulrah big succ.
---
....bruh

idk, nothing crazy. if the look is worth it to me then maybe 2m

Download a private server and client combo, there is a lot of them out on the web. Then just run the server and the client.

oh so thats where the logging out / logging in comes in. either that or i can pray to RNGesus that I get 2 +5's within my 23 brown spices that i have.
---
Yeah it’s decent for sure. But 3m+ is easily obtainable at vorkath
---
You'll have to give more details but if you were wrongfully banned then do something about it. :)
---
Why did they say that in an interview with the Devs then. Even saying that runelite was against the rules and certain applications with runelite could trigger a ban.
---
Did I read that 13 year olds will be there?
---
Farm runs and bird houses. The gold will add up. I have about 10 mil from mine so far (not adding seeds).
---
Even with an arma book? I mostly use a cbow because broad bolts are cheap, but I figured with the arma book or other shield slot items for the bonus cbow would be better. I have no idea tho I usually just go with the norm.
---
He’s probably the asshole that sent you that PM
---
I love the current character models. Would hate to see them change.
---
I remember when the he update came out I really disliked any change that wasn't to the direct enviorment. I remember all the first things I noticed that made me upset was scimitars changes, goofy player models, and guthans plate bodies. 
---
As time went on I felt like all the armors and player models where starting to look like toon town, or something generic.
---
They also added the second shop with hops seeds in the farming guild. Probably both contributed tbh.
---
Black armor
---
Haven't played on that account in years. Not even sure what the stats are. Not too worried, but figured I'd add to this post so if the mods see it they realize it's more than a single person issue
---
Oh, I see what you mean. The way your comment and the one above you were worded, I thought you meant OP's was a bad idea. 
---
Yeah, I agree, removing the combat levels entirely would be dumb
---
Pretty sure someone must've gotten a 1kc shard
---
DHCB gives you brutal blacks for chill 1M/hr content and gives more kills per trip at vorkath.
---
Thx Stranger!
---
Ok will do!
---
Splashing versus stun alch ^^
---
yes, my iron friend didn't like it tho
---
Never respond to anyone who starts a sentence out with “Pssst”
---
Revs is not a good idea if you’re new, and solo. Green a Dragon bots will be a good start for ya. Once you start getting your feet wet you can try Chins. Lots of low level PKers killing the chin bots.
---
Thank you for your input!

Gives an escanor or armstrong vibe

5. Tbh I hit psycho rng on GWD bosses. Zammy hilt kc 7, tassets 26, xbow 17, chestplate 19. We’ve done a few hundred bandos since and have gotten bcp and just kind of feel like trying something new. We Corp bomb when we feel like being afk tho!
---
I feel you bro, you can see in the video how I clicked 10 times per tick hahaha I was so nervous and didn't want to die to a dead click (happened to me before this attempt).
---
We figured but thanks for confirming! What about CoX?
---
That got dark real quick
---
Same. I got an email about resetting my password as well, but I really don't care. I have 2FA on my email accounts AND my OSRS account. Short of stealing my phone, they're not getting my account.
---
I'd consider fally hard a fairly advanced account in regards to people wanting beginner guides without BiS requirements.
---
How does BP work at mole? Since it has a chance of digging after every hit I'd assume hard hitting accurate weapons are quicker.
---
Rigour is good because of the range damage % bonus.
---
He's an ironman.

Thats what i did, just took me 3-4 tries both times

No no, it was more meant as advice than something bad.

True, he got a bit lucky. Just trying to explain how the ge works as some people don't always understand.
---
Upload yourself beating wooxs records then ill sub
---
I dont recommend the 83 hunt tip. Puro is heavilly botted, and you may go very dry on a glory. Also, hunt is easy to train now a days with birdhouse runs.
---
The new meta is 75 craft and boosting for glory, at this level you can also make slayer rings. I recommending getting 61 craft at charters (for lunar diplomacy) and then 61-75 craft farm giant seaweed and then mine sandstone for buckets of sand.
---
To glassmake effectively, you should look into getting 77 mage for super glass make (you can also +3 boost for this with wizard mind bombs).
---
That should give you a few goals, GL!
---
they said they were going to let irons use items on the collection log to add it, and then totally changed their minds :(
---
Completely understandable! For this item it seems the worth is around 48m but there are a lot of merchers taking advantage of it on low traded items :)
---
Scythe is so expensive to use because you charge them with blood runes, and usually Tbow is BIS in most of the places where a Scythe is BiS
---
Ill try
---
I think this makes the most logical sense
---
Stamina pot and brews are all you need because they don’t weigh anything. First time doing DT I got kicked soooo many times because I had sharks. 
---
Ever since doing the pyramid with brews and staminas on 4 alts I have fell only 1 time total.
---
Yea neither am I lol, but the oak doors method isn't just efficient, it's super convenient.  You just have to position your camera the right way and call your servant to you, then you don't have to move your mouse at all and just click/use keyboard to build and remove.  Also, because the demon butler returns from the bank too fast in order for you to build and remove two doors while he's gone (unless you're  tick perfect and have good ping, which I assuredly am not), then it's actually just as fast if not faster to use a regular butler instead of a demon butler, saving half of those costs.
---
this might be true
---
Do a few hard clues, or hop to a PvP world, ask someone to buy the shop out and leave one behind. There’s tons of options.
---
This isn’t a joke?
---
59 hunter. Shamans sounds fun
---
what a twisted 'trainer', gives you a dagger and throws you in a cage full of giant man-eating rats to fight one to the death, stabbing it dozens of times as it shrieks and slowly bleeds to death, coughing up its bloody vomit
---
Maybe he just *really* likes slaughtering rats.
---
Nah, people are downvoting you because you're a dickhead
---
The suggestion absolutely was shit, but it doesn't justify that kind of behavior. That being said, I will pray every night for the rest of my life that nothing like that ever passes a vote.
---
Thank you for your reply. I'd say eliminating downtime is probably one of the things I'm best at, as there's a lot of carryover from other games. I enjoy calculating whether it's more efficient to use cheaper methods to skillup or more expensive methods combined with making gold.
---
Thank you for clarifying about combat. I was confused at first why all the items that were recommended were better than dragon, for example, but max hit being king seems to be the reason.
---
Don’t disrespect god tier f2p fashion scape

rapier is used where tent would be used, except verzik

You’d go to the main runescape website (not oldschool) and download the launcher there. As a heads up though that’s basically a completely different game and a lot of things have changed, so it’s nothing like OSRS. If you’re looking for nostalgia stuff you’d have to start fresh on OSRS, but it’s not as bad as it sounds.
---
Runelite. It’s one the of sprites. You can have it as that which I think is the 2010 setting and you can have it as the old school setting which I think maybe be 2004? But yeah it’s on runelite.
---
Hm runecrafting xp was it?
---
You too man!  GZ We have joined the club !!!
---
Just saying that means you don't understand.
---
Local is internal Network.
---
You need the public IP to get the local IP.
---
In other words, If you're using local network without first obtaining their public IP. You're doing shit to your own network.
---
Man you're the worst black hatter I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.

I've been using it since I was like 7 years old gimme a break

Damn I think I made like 300-400m from 95.

:)
---
Problem with the Q&amp;A it's the same questions over and over again or stupid ass suggestions. Idm them doing those, I would prefer first 30 just straight Q&amp;A, and the next thirty is announcements, fan art, quiz etc.

Yea pretty much, it was a few years go
---
Free account guy is back! Original numbers! 55-100 wins!

Sometimes people run into the wild with all their teles or all their gp. You never know what someone else has in their inventory. I don’t PK but if you’re going into the wildy and get killed by someone, it’s fair game.
---
until they get a scythe, in which case rapier/tent is never used again?
---
Did your time really get devalued if you had fun? This is a game after all.
---
Yikes for yikesing a guy who plays the game as intended
---
Big if true

Yeh seem to be getting alot of that, I realise now I have been stupidly unlucky on getting boss tasks
---
So much sandwich lady
---
https://youtu.be/VpOIJEE613s that’s the fight
---
He's wrong anyway, no one cares at all about that. It's for what Chris and Raven said, feels good rolling for big hits on helpless noobs and you never know what shit people are risking. Numerous posts on this sub and youtube clips of accidental cash stacks, accidental skulling and too many teleports, runes, scrolls, gp. Only take a minute when i'm out pking and may not have seen anyone for 15mins!
---
I just finished my 500 easy grind my best loot was power ammy t for 1.8m
---
I'm a fuckin reddit noob who doesn't know how to use it. They're playing sea shanty 2 and cut it off right before the drop. Clever
---
Slayer at high levels can easily sustain kingdom and much more. The average greater nech task of 200+ earns me 800k-1m+.
---
For a low level like yourself I would honestly blackjack. I've heard it's ezmode to blackjack with leftclick using op clients so you may want to look into that if you decide to blackjack.
---
Any recommendations for guidance. Or is it the same as last time do all the free play and then pay to play
---
Yeah, they're pretty sweet, and that profit isn't factoring in the later income from skotizo that you'll get due to all the totem pieces and shards.  The wiki lists brutal blacks as ~770k/hr with 40 kills/hr, but says that max efficiency is 70-75 kills/hr so my income makes sense. 
---
 I usually get around 60.   
---
I also use less supplies than what the wiki cites.  I use 2 prayer pots per run (sometimes less), instead of 2.5.  I use only 1 dose of divine ranging pots per run, not 3.  Using assembler and having 99 ranging means I use fewer dragon bolts (e) than what they are citing.  And I bank using the farming cape tele to go to farming guild and then replenish stats with pool in house from the spirit tree, so that saves time banking and takes away the house telly costs.  It's all small stuff here and there, but it adds up.
---
where does it say that pkers should get resources from pker.  its called player killing, you shouldnt be expected to train an account to 2277 from player killing.  If they want to make money they pvm, if they want to train their skills they do it like skillers.  Why do pkers have this mindset that the game should be handled to them on a silver platter with limited risk/work involved?  why should they be able to move past the grind/time that everyone else has to wade through?
---
So your personal oppinion is irrelevant then. Fan boi.
---
oof
---
The general rule of thumb is the action always needs to be 1:1. If you're doing anything that generates 2+ actions with only 1 click, probably not safe.
---
You seem butthurt lolol
---
cant report me until i am doing the act :P
---
&gt;WMK
---
what is WMK?
---
mute is piss fast if you have freezes, i would recommend one of you have dwarhammer and the other bgs if you are going to do tek.  they both should only add about 1-2 minutes max on your raid time.
---
thanks!
---
Really struck a nerve there huh

“Sorry guys we just looked at the code and it seems we’ve accidentally removed it about a year ago” dwh 50m=&gt; 2147m
---
For this theory to be true it’s reasonable to expect to see a similar item from CoX to be decreasing in price because the rise in people doing CoX would lead to a rise in the supply of that item in the GE. A Dextrous prayer scroll is a near perfect comparison because both are very commonly dropped as uniques, are roughly the same price and are one time BIS consumables so they can’t be being dumped for a new META for new content or the like, they are literally permanent to the account. And you do see exactly that happening, the Dex has been dropping in price steadily over the past week or so. But I think it might be more complicated than simply that because I would expect to see a larger drop than a mil or so in the Dex for the spike seen with the hilts. I think it being mid-late August and the fact that college/high school aged kids are beginning classes again is decreasing the amount of raids being completed and causing a drop in supply. Just my 200 cents
---
ok then thanks for letting me know
---
yet non skullers cant fight back because a vast majority of teams/clans use alts with same names making it impossible to know who you are retaliating on.  Even more so if they catch a freeze and stand on you while logging onto another account.  Then the pvmer is skulled and risking 10x what the pker/clan/team is risking.  In no situation is it worth it to fight back in the wild.  that is the largest disadvantage and you can not counter argue to that.
---
I don’t want to be that guy but could these 99 parties be planned a day in advance and post the date? I legit want to go visit these guys and celebrate and I’m always 16 hours late.

If jagex tried muting for something like that now the fanbase would lose its shit

Nah, just don't want people to take it the wrong way. Don't know Torvesta personally, it's just something about the way he talks that bugs me.
---
Nothing wrong with that but only if you're using dhcb/ward cause there's no way I'd want to do multi kill trips with a BP/bgs unless you get lucky and only use 1 or 2 food in the first kill.
---
"due me" and "due to me" are both acceptable in this case. if you're talking about the grammar

Are you planning on re-upping your membership? Because rune is the highest tier armour non members can wear.

If you want to stay f2p you could invest in some god armour like saradomin etc that gives you a prayer bonus.

As if you've never made a mistake. Dude caught himself literally within minutes. Chill, mate.

Aight whatever man you do you lmao
---
Idk why you'd do konar at high level when you're not doing hydra task. If you wanted fast exp you shouldn't have used konar. 
---
With 1000 hydra kills,assuming you received  the claw you would have made 152m from the drops.
---
More than 3x the total loot from all other task  from 96-99.
---
Much better then the ads that tried to copy the exact same format for mobile game ads.
---
I fully respect a pker who kills me, no hard feelings at all. I probably don't even remember your name the second I turn up in Edgevile.
---
It's just a chore having to move to the arena every 5-6 runs due to a pkers killing me (as they always do, I cannot, nor do I want to defend myself. I find fighting really barbaric and wish to shoo away from it as much as possible). If a pker wishes to do so it's their good right.
---
But isn't this part of "senseless violence" - there's a big campaign in the Netherlands against this. Violence which serves no purpose at all, if I really wish to spite the pker I'd just drop the bones. 
---
Again I respect them, but do we have to make it so that one person's fun destroy another's? Can't we create a community where we combined say "no" against violence?
---
Yo I just started barb fishing and every time i cut the fish, nothing happens. no bait...
---
what am i doing wrong?

Are you making fun of rednecks? Fuck outta here with your bigotry.

you could say the same about gta, or the elder scrolls, or saints row, or an infinite number of games where you can kill innocent people with very little repercussion
