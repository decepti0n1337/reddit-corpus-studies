SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED

Regardless of what you did in 2006, why ban you now? Hope you get it reversed.
---
Buy one at a range shop or do beginner clues

My account was perm banned now I have my account back,I hope this doesn‚Äôt happen to me. Upvoted for visibility

Nice cerberus plugin

That‚Äôs jagex for you, what else did you expect?

I used to make a pretty solid profit from smithing, is it no longer that good? I made an iron man account recently so I'm forced to do it anyway but I figured smithing would be a good money maker.
---
Which range shop? I went to the one closest in Rimmington and they don't have the base shortbow.

Big igloo time

It is literally labeled as a permanent ban. The Jmod mistakenly put a value of only a few years, and after it was realized that a permanent ban was revoked the mistake was fixed and it went back to being permanent. It doesn't matter what the Jmod input for the number, because it doesn't change the fact that it was fully meant to be a permanent ban originally.

There‚Äôs a ranged shop in Varrok that sells bows. If you don‚Äôt have the money then you can get 50gp from killing goblins along the way.

But then why do I only get half exp for fletching them to unstrung!!?

Couldn't you talk to the ranged tutor in Lumbridge?

I think if they were to add personalised weapons via smithing at high levels it'd bring some life back to it.

Every one said that to me, literally every guide was like "nothing less than60 agi" I said fuck it and did it with like 50 agi and it wasn't hard at all and I saved my self hours of mindless agility training

I‚Äôm not denying that I‚Äôm shady nor a doofus, I just want to know why I was banned and then unbanned and then banned again
---
They magically pop out as drops from mobs.
---
In osrs, everything can be obtained somehow by killing mobs
---
In rs2 skilling was profitable because if you really wanted ore, mining was actually the best way to obtain it, instead of killing zalcano
---
I absolutely agree that this isn't a court, etc etc. In addition, I agree that all accounts are Jagex's property, and of course it's within their rights to act as they wish. 
---
That doesn't change the fact that I dislike the idea of sentences not being literal.
---
Highly unlikely that's the case - Castle wars died not long after the current save is from, and I don't remember such bug existing at that time, and I played a LOT of cw at that time. If memory serves, gwd made cw go out of fashion, and it picked up a bit after free trade removal, but didn't last long as most players started leaving and it never recovered.
---
Welcome to Jagex support your call is very important to us. Please hold ... ‚ô´Sea Shanty 2‚ô´
---
You can be truthful, what was it that got your account banned in the first place? It was 13 years ago which is longer then alot of felony charges, even if it was for something as bad as botting you have had a bunch of time to grow up and reform. If it was no reason then sorry to ya but if it was for a good reason and your lying then we will prolly see a jmod smackdown. Always better to be truthful
---
what do you need enlightened journy for?
---
Fully agreed. The accounts are Jagex's property, and they can act as they wish.
---
As a consumer, it's my preference they behave as I mentioned above.
---
So on task will always favor like BIS Arma and shit?

To me it sounds like he leaked someone's personal details/attempted to dox someone in game? That would be my best guess

on task the slayer helmet/black mask with imbue on its own provides around the same strength bonus as the void set as a whole. so yeah.

I also had to start a second main for false ban(hcim too, both banned same time). It‚Äôs really sad that this is a thing that happens. Especially considering how much time and effort this game can eat up. I don‚Äôt play anymore because of the risk. And I want to play, I just have to be okay with the chance of randomly losing my account.

If you're getting 1.5 kill average, you should only kill 8f you land a bgs spec and tele immediately if you fail to do so

Smithing needs a complete overhaul, this won't fix it sadly.

It'll never happen, but I can dream.

Excuse you?

That‚Äôs the fucking final boss! You ever tried to keep a child happy!

Ok
---
Got mine at 52 at ZMI
---
Im not gonna change your mind, but at least someone killing a boss 10000 times for the purpose of getting gp isnt being delusional. Because in the current state of the game, if youre looking for gp the most realistic means of doing that is bossing. Someone rolling the dice on a lottery or hunting down defenseless people in the hopes of making gp when on average it's a horrible method for making gp are delusional.  
---
Call them both pathetic if you want, but one is delusional and one is not.
---
For real, while I have no skin in the game since I still have my original account thankfully, I remember all the stupid shit I did and said as a kid, and how much I've grown since I was literally 8 years old, I can imagine a lot of people remain banned to this day for stupid shit they did as kids and probably now regret.
---
Oh yeah it's all coming together
---
Are you okay?

The guy you are replying to isnt the OP...
---
Haha going against hivemind reddit 10/10 funny downvotes on le way

Your streams are great. Gz on hammer beast!
---
How did you get into ToB?  Don‚Äôt you need a bunch of quests to get access to the area?
---
Exactly that. Although there's usually still the chance for parole (they evaluate whether or not you should still be in prison, and let you out essentially on probation). Unless they sentence you to life with no parole, in which case you're basically guaranteed to die in prison.

You smite mith darts to get that sweet +1 (also a mith dart)

Priest in peril is the only requirement. The gates on the northern side of ToB are open and you can just walk right in. It‚Äôs a bit of a trek but worth it

Yeah, imagine how much many of us have grown since we first made our accounts.

There are already established big names who don‚Äôt have to advertise on the Reddit of all places. Just sounds like a scam.

Also generally fuck off, rwt is the gay
---
I think, and this really sucks, you might not get to keep it. I think someone asked this on a q and a once.
---
Makes sense, idk why I thought you needed to complete the whole vampire chain.
---
This shit makes me terrified to log into my main account.
---
Just not the statistic OP was looking for :(
---
If you log out during a game, you can log back in within the minute 'check' to offer a free space to anyone in the waiting room - you used to be able to hop worlds as well, to enter games like this. I thought it was changed, but this could explain it, if he is hopping back and forth between two worlds, with two games running.
---
Why?
---
Yikes. It wasnt even OP, you are a cunt lmao. 
---
Even if he did bot or something. It was 13 years ago *(they were more than likely a child)* on a different Runescape.
---
I'm amazed no HCIM has Pet'ion or Scropin?
---
Gets drunk. Kills Thug in the wild. I am a God at pking.
---
I think they wanted to keep it accessible to anyone. Similar to how CoX is accessible on a level 3 with no quests. Hopefully raids 3 is the same!
---
One of my accounts was perm banned when I was 15. It's been almost 12 years and it's still banned. I would pay a fee to have it unbanned. 12 years is a long time.

Stop playing for a while. Cut out all osrs. Come back when you feel like it would be fun again.

The longer they wait, the higher the reward, but the higher the chance that another mod will get the reward. Interesting game theory example.

Yeah, I hope this buddy ends up being able to talk again

Oh ya breaking out of jail and getting unbanned in a video game are the exact same thing obviously. Definitely not possible he was also a lot younger and less mature TEN years ago, and has definitely changed a lot as a person. Nope, impossible. Jagex should ban him and his entire blood line from ever playing their sacred game.
---
Weird! My account was banned back in 2008 or so. I was done with the game and gave the account to a friend, who did some dumb noobie scam and got the account banned. When I came back 11 years later, I was able to reactivate it in RS3 like nothing happened
---
Do what everyone does now, ask for their discord hash or drop yours. I would rather have a ping on my phone saying "oi cunt, come bandos" than just replying on in game dm which i always miss cause afking to hard.
---
Except OP didn't do anything, it's not like he was the reason he got unbanned. Instead it's more like the people in charge of the jail said he could leave, he does and then 10 years later they're like "oops lmao that was a mistake, back in you go to serve your life sentence".
---
Yeah, I'd say go ahead and take a break.

could be wrong, but some candidates are pvm items like whip, barrows gear, onyx/zenyte jewellery (less so), maybe clue items like rangers or orn kits.

Watch it disappear when you leave the island :(. I remember back when I was a kid I drop tricked a bunch of arrows from vanakka for like two hours. Then I left the island and only had 25. Think you get stuck with the same inventory every time

How to extend your trips:
---
1. Get a dhcb
---
2. Get rigour
---
3. Train ranged AND magic.
---
The thing using BP is that your bgs spec is essential for you to effectively kill it. In my experience i needed abt 30 bgs spec damage to even consider staying after specs. So yea, 2nd kill you only have 1 spec. If you fail that youll have to bank.
---
Once you get dhcb you are able to kill vork without needing specs. This enables you to kill several more vorks before banking.
---
I was 89 ranged when i switched from BP to dhcb, and my average trip of 1 kill turned into avg 4 kills/ trip (i also have rigour).
---
Hope this helps.
---
You can roughly gauge gp inflation by bond prices. You could look at the volume of items traded also
---
Who says this isn't also an OSRS account? He's been playing on this account for 10 years since it's been unbanned. He's probably been playing for the past 6 years on OSRS. And you seriously are asking, "Why not make a new account and throw away 6 years of progress?" When talking about RuneScape. A game that is renown for taking 6,000 hours of gameplay, on average, just to "max."
---
Every one switches over ??? Or just those who opt in?
---
I am one of those retired maxed mains. I don‚Äôt play it for tickets I just enjoy the challenge of running the flag or being an off mage on caps.. it will never be non competitive again sadly, I do miss the old days of playing for fun.

Separate profile from the main game, like with DMM or tourney worlds. When you log in the twisted league world you'll be a region-locked iron, when you log into a normal world you'll have your usual account.
---
What's the use of crafting for a main? You can just buy your torture off the GE. What about fletching? GE has all the darts you need for your blow pipe. How about hunter? GE's got chins too.
---
I can keep going and doing this for a majority of skills. This argument is stupid. Most skill do not have a "point" anymore with how easy it is to trade items. Outside of very niche things like herblore for raids, firemaking for eternal fires, etc most non combat skills are completely useless outside of like agility.
---
Why do skills need a "point" anyway? They're literally the game play lmao.
---
I would have to decline. I thought about the offer, and using my points on herb boxes will be more efficient.
---
Yeah, bots lmao.

I did the same as a kid smh, scammed by Jagex

I tried a couple times, however I was using 30 darts on average per kill and could not get to a 2nd kill (lost way too many 100k's trying to squeeze it)

True. Nice

My bad, I am probably mistaken then and it is ranged all along

I need to find the animations
---
Potentially dumb question, but I thought I'd ask. I'm interested in coming back to OSRS for the upcoming twisted league, and also really want to make a group ironman account. I understand that group ironman is potentially over a year away, but would still like the untradeable rewards from the temporary leagues to be on the group ironman account.
---
So here's my plan, but wanted to see if anyone knew of any reasons why this wouldn't work given the information we have today. If I make a fresh account and leave them on tutorial island, buy membership for the account, and then only use it in the temporary league, would I still be able to become a group ironman on the "main" game when that time comes next year?

if thats the case, id just get your range up

Dungeons/clues need to drop recipes that have obscure/different ingredients for items. Make players have to get high smithing to get the gear or for others to want high smithing for a profit off the gear. Do it for crafting and smithing as well as fetching.

---
Well the account was banned from 2006 - 2009, so does that mean he hasn't really played since 2006? I thought he had been playing on this account actively and just recently was re-banned. Otherwise, how did he even know he was banned again? He could have been banned again in 2010 and never noticed if he didn't log in till now.

That just means it disappears not long after it spawns, even if it's in your inventory. As long as you deposit it into the ore collector once per rotation, you'll be fine.
---
I agree but it also rewards inactivity by increasing the payout with time. Then whether or not the mods respond would depend on whether or not they work together and the "cost" they place on responding to OP.
---
But if it were $11 and dropping there would be absolutely no incentive to wait, given the $11 is incentive enough to even respond.

all these posts about pvp that lack any actual thought are only serving to numb people to the topic. eventually, if not already, people will get sick of seeing them and turn against pvp.

Honestly my advice was to just make a new account since he would have started from the beginning in OSRS anyways.
---
Only thing he wouldn't have is his original name.
---
Legit fake, god ash has already stated that the trees and the fishing spots don‚Äôt have the pet drops programmed into them.
---
Balls shrinky dinky cause the roids so strong but they make the aforementioned jimmy-jam look long.
---
60 is what the wiki recommends, so you'll be good. Just block out at least an hour for the whole thing lol.
---
GL on finishing RFD, it's definitely worth it!
---
My advice was to start with a new account since he was beginning from zilch regardless.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about getting keylogged as long as you stick to the big name/popular servers. The owners of these ones (roatzpk, runewild, dawntained, etc.) make so much money from donations that they would never want to ruin their reputation by putting malicious code that would be very quickly detected by the community.
---
Question about miscellania mechanics as wiki is somewhat unclear and cba testing myself: if you have workers on idle, do they not still take money and ‚Äúwaste‚Äù it, or not take any money?
---
it's pretty simple really, life may have a subjective meaning to you, me, or others. Or not, but that particular meaning cannot be argued to be right or wrong because it's a subjective opinion.
---
objectively, life has a clear meaning, to procreate and to survive. this is evident when observing a wide variety of life forms including ourselves. whether or not you agree with this statement doesn't change the fact that it is true. but that also doesn't discard the subjective meanings that people may conclude that life has as well as the objective meaning life so clearly has.
---
ok, now take that brain you used to reflect on yourself and how you shouldn't be taken at face value based on a singular experience, and apply it to other people! 
---
great, now we're caught up, try addressing my post again.
---
You fell for an old ass trap. Now its time to rebuild. Change up your passwords and ip as well. Some of these scammers will "check up" on your account if they are able to in the future.
---
So I got my email compromised had my recovery email changed and had my Authenticator removed, I did EXACTLY what you did to the tit ( using comp with WiFi, and phone with carrier data) and reported it on reddit. Basically noticed I was able to lock and recover my account within a 14-18 hour window
---
good luck
---
It's a good think I don't drink, or do anything for that matter.
---
I don‚Äôt have a good explanation why but I‚Äôd get rigour
---
Get started at vorkath, or zulrah if you're decent at games or understand how the game plays, but you'll probably have done barrows by the time you get there anyways
---
this sub's new meme to repeat for weeks and absolutely run into the ground ?
---
Regen bracelet.
---
Do some surveys online you broke ass
---
Player owned Zulrah
---
I want to know exactly what he did.
---
My account was the same, got perma banned because someone hacked my account at some point in the 5 years that I wasn't playing. Appealed it, got unbanned, played for a couple months with my friend. A few weeks after I stopped again I logged on to give my friend back some stuff he let me borrow and I saw I was perma banned again, with no new offences, and no choice to appeal
---
Piss off
---
I remember when I was 9 I stole someone's account and then that became my main. I still use it. Should I be banned?
---
Damn very nice gz
---
I got a mimic when it first came out and didn‚Äôt realize how to use it, fudged it didn‚Äôt get to fight the boss. Haven‚Äôt seen one sense and forgot they exaisted
---
Yes I'm just going to accept my fate and I started again last night. I'm using a different Gmail account just incase at some point sknethi g happens and it is fixed.  But I'm not holding my breath . Thanks for the response .
---
After all this time does it really matter?
---
RemindMe! 24 hours
---
Sucks ay. Hope something comes from this and fixes it but I have doubts. 
---
Oh well... Back at Lumby killing chickens
---
They take your money and do no work in return, because technically you have them "assigned" to be idle. So you should never have anyone idle.
---
This disgusts me
---
Knew it was coming but I still watched lol nice
---
Possibly a rogue mod at work cleaning out your bank?
---
You don't understand this whole "permaban" thing huh?
---
I never reset after spec. I always fill up my inventory and usually have to drop a couple potions as well. My vorkath grind is pretty steady, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm missing out on gp/xp

He was banned in 06 and logged back in during 09. He literally said that

60 is good. You want 70 and a full stamina to get really good times through the pass but 60 is definitely worlds better than 40
---
Fair

Shut up boomer

I saw other accounts there as well!
---
What would you adjust? Its a small detail that is affected by a market-value that multiplies on itself after 3-4 layers of change
---
Any possibility of introducing some sort of AI in unpopulated mini games?

Adjusted xp values and high alchemy values to essentially make the next tier relative to the current rune xp rates/high alchemy values
---
We don‚Äôt need to keep adding instances to things. It‚Äôs an mmo, competition for resources is part of the game.
---
I‚Äôm honestly amazed at how many people need customer support for this game because they‚Äôre all so allegedly innocent. We‚Äôll never get player support btw. Account security is the players responsibility and has always been, billing support is handled swiftly, and people intentionally push boundaries and act surprised when they‚Äôre banned for it. Like the people who make some rig to alch for them or any other outside support. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. The games rules are pretty clear people just continually look for ways to blur the lines.
---
K den
---
Note that there will be certain combinations of gear/prayer/bolt and dart type where bp is higher dps, but i think dhcb will still be better profit per hr.
---
Oh I definitely agree with that, just not exactly fun to go through 3 times in a short period
---
I had my account hacked and bottled while I went on vacation for a little over a week and when I got back I got an email saying it was perm banned. I wasn't able to appeal but I did do a email chain with their support confirming all my actions and locations and they were able to ip range thst my log in where not from my origins even if I did log in at my vacation area I included that in the emails too. It's to cover yourself and provide proof. I wish you luck on your account. Also I do have my account back and was able to keep all the levels the bot did on it.
---
Let‚Äôs be real that‚Äôs what group iron man is gonna be 4 feeders and one acc going for the new spot on the high scores until they make another high score challenge mode

yeah i really wouldnt be complaining if i wasnt competing against bots.
---
12 year old me never got scammed, yet people getting scammed everyday and its almost 2020
---
Yeah its been around  there all in on it trying to make you think you can antiscam.  Had some guy pming me at ge trying to be my buddy and do the same thing
---
works fine with 1
---
Noooooo... please... don‚Äôt vote no to more op armour, weapons, bosses, or devaluations of skills.... /s
---
Of course, hard to do any higher level pvm on an iron without barrows gear.
---
Holy. Fuck. Anyone who‚Äôs claiming the boss is shit is probably 80 combat and using rag gear, no fuck it‚Äôs rough. If you‚Äôve got a functional brain and have the stats and gear KQ is absolutely not a bad boss.
---
Indeed, we need to reward players with arma helms after killing the clue scroll guardians one million times.
---
For a sec i thought that it was a winter update

Its because you set it to wumbo

Most of the time people just want the name of that character when an account was banned for a long time.

how im feeling with r/c right now, 92 r/c and doing souls which based on the math from 92-99 is exactly 50% chance. 
---
kill me now
---
is... is this a bad or good thing?
---
I partly agree with you. The lines have been blurred constantly and it's good that they've come out and clearly drawn the lines.
---
I will have to agree to disagree with you about customer support. For instance a great example of customer support for me is Blizzard. When the WoW movie came out i raised a ticket and said "the WoW movie made me feel nostalgic any chance I could get 1 weeks playtime to see if i'm still interested in this game?" and within 24 hours they replied and gave me 1 weeks game credit with a pretty epic response:
---
"*I just wanted to swing by and let you know that I was able to get that week of game time applied to your account so you should be all set to log in and get your game on, see the new content, and see if this is a world you'd like to get immersed back into =). If you ever need anything else don't hesitate to let us know! &lt;3"*
---
Realistically it's the 'moments' like this that people talk about as wins and other than the hearthstone shamozzle recently they've always been a quality business to me.
---
The issue with introducing a new smithing tier is that 9/10 of the weapons are going to be useless.
---
I would like to have a new smithing tier, but as anyone who has thought about adding a new smithing tier realizes, adding a new tier of metal would be pointless if 9/10 weapons would be useless since they'd be so badly balanced.
---
As long as the bad metal weapon balance situation continues to be unaddressed, adding new smithing content would be impossible.
---
Thanks for the reply. I don't plan to barrage Slayer, trying to milk the most profit out of it as I can.

Where in runelite can i check the ping? It's not on the world switcher menu
---
Having high runecrafting can make you upwards of 9m/hr. The same cannot be said for smithing.
---
Just shouldn't gamble in general. Staking however :\^)
---
Ctrl+F will open a search menu for locating specific text. You could have used that. Also they're in ascending order, so "looking for it" has been made pretty damn easy for you.
---
On Mac you use Cmd+F and on Android Chrome the feature is called "Find in page".
---
Are you sure?? I can swear it was there last time I checked
---
They will judge purely on feeling. Like how sorry they feel for you, how much they feel you deserved it etc. It‚Äôs not like court

it's near useless on a normal account too

flexing with 3a longsword on an ironman account is far more impressive than flexing with 3a longsword on a normie

Make sure he loses no nut November!
---
I think its safe to say you can play the game without skillcape perks (and its not going to make a big difference)
---
some of the most sought after skillcape perks:
---
construction - just use house tele tab instead
---
crafting - ring of dueling puts you insanely close to a bank too
---
Given you take photos of your vape collection, I doubt you can knock out a wank let alone a real person
---
Calm down, Tony. I did read your post and the point of this is to allow more freedom for change in the skill. By having the skill maxed out with mid tier equipment makes adding anything new requiring smithing backwards; for example binding a draconic visage, or fixing together a dragon square shield, etc... are apparently easier than creating a basic rune sq. shield. It‚Äôs backwards and makes the skill stunted as a result. It‚Äôs obvious the skill needs reworked.
---
Subjective value versus objective value. You perceive a 3rd age longsword to have more subjective value to an Ironman than to a main, which is your opinion. Simple misunderstanding that could‚Äôve been avoided had you used more appropriate diction in your original statement, but I‚Äôm not here to critique your communication skills. Was just tryna work outta ya what the fuck you were on about. Cheers lad.

I really like this one, thank you for this

Construction cape gives infinite house teleports, but it's not like you can't teleport to your POH without 99 construction. Attack cape gives infinite warrior guild tokens, but you can still get a ddefender without 99 attack.

If 1 person gets unbanned then other perm bans should get unbanned too
---
I do want to see more Jmod gameplay to see what they think of their game.
---
&gt;Hate to say it, I think if we had a game feature similar to RS3 invention, we could bring back a lot of uses for smithing, for example, the tourmaline core for guardian boots should have some sort of smithing requirement to fuse the two together.
---
I think that's a bit of a roundabout way of making smithing more useful imo.
---
It would be best if smithing would just be used in the way it was intended to be used when designed - way of providing players with useful weapons and armour.
---
To answer your question, Jagex can definitely detect large transfers of wealth, and people have been banned in the past for doing large transfers between accounts. Depending on what you‚Äôre doing with the money once you transfer it would perhaps affect how suspicious it looks, but I‚Äôm unsure on that one. Ultimately, if you get a RWT ban, I think your only course of action would be to appeal it.
---
Thanks for giving actual examples. As someone who exclusively runecrafts, this gives me great context as to what is actually going on in the PvP community and how updates have affected it.

With this argumentation you might as well begin smithing addy in your 30s, runite in your 40s and assemble dragon items at 60.
---
It's not exactly like moving the level by threshold 10 makes the items created correspond to their usefulness. And so far, I still fail to realize how *literally* all the smithing content that has been added in osrs has been hindered by the current level requirements.
---
Just use some free vpn software ;)

how many average joes complain about their bans on reddit vs actually going through the appeal process and not posting on social media about it? I'm sure it's a lot more lol

What annoys me most about him is that he seems to always complain. 
---
Kills someone with a 45-45 dds "oh man I wish I didn't kill him there so I could've gmauled him a 49" or "how did he not get smited there ?!?!" in like 95% of the clips
---
Eh, it's definitely subjective to an extent, but not entirely. Ignoring the fact that account trading is against the rules, people would pay much more than 500m for an ironman with a 3a longsword. Hell, people pay hundreds of mills just for a name that looks kinda cool.
---
&gt; Everyone is botting in someway, whether it be using a recorder/repeater macro... or an actual bot for playing

Nah

Excellent news!

That is what setting your friends chat to private is for, but i see where you are coming from and it would be nice to see who has tried to add me to their friend's list
---
It's for sure you're ranged level. I have 70 def and 93 range and I can always get 2-4 kills, no rigour. Your def level is way higher but you say you're still taking damage. To me that says your kills are too slow and vork is attacking you a lot more than he would. If you don't woox walk, learn that, it's easy and you're giving up dps by not doing it. Rune darts will help. Make sure your salve amulet is imbued otherwise it doesn't help your ranging. Try not to eat except when frozen or when walking to avoid acid/fireballs. 
---
When avoiding the 1 shot fireballs you can ctrl click to run. If you time it right and start running alright after you attack, and click two tiles away, you can click back on vork right away and you'll have avoided the fireball while attacking as fast as possible with the blowpipe. It's small optimizations like this that matter.
---
Basically, the faster you kill vork the less damage you'll take.
---
Im so glad i havent been hit with this bug, id reeeeeeee so bad, your taking it like a champ. Goodluck op

Sorry I got mixed up, I agree tho, not everybody who was banned should be unbanned.
---
If a botter was in the same situation as OP and they didn‚Äôt bot when they got the account back, they should get the account back if they learned their lesson
---
Yeah, its a shame but people gotta learn it somehow.
---
the award is for being a good youtuber. in game achievments dont mean anything.

So wholesome.
---
Sorry that ban is correct, there was a recovery made for the account which was granted, as part of the recovery request the account also had the ban quashed, this was incorrect, so the ban was subsequently re-applied

In an ideal world PvM shouldn't be a substitute for other skills. Unfortunately the game has been balanced around it for so long. Can't really go back and fix it. Really unfortunate actually.
---
And like a month before that.
---
Is there a way to check the IP on who was using the account at the time? It might be correct but I do feel like someone else may have had access at the time. Which is why I changed the details.

I don't disagree, but I think a game should be moderately fun. Currently, RC lacks the fun, it doesn't even have the thrill of randomness.

---
Things have to rest on firm principles, this is how we assess things and how we relate to content in the game. Why not just throw everything up in the air? Why should RFD require 175 for everyone? Why not just randomize it or let people choose to do it at 40 QP? Why should inferno have 69 waves? Couldnt it just be 55? Why should Zuk have 1200 hp just because u killed him with 1200 why not just give him 550 hp.

Plus all the runes, arrows/darts, potions and food used.
---
False, it gets easier on task with slayer helm
---
This is all under the assumption that the demand will TRIPLE for rune bars because the requirements for 99 smithing items are lowered to 92. Which most likely will not be the case unless there's some point to getting from 92-99 smithing. There's not going to be a sudden influx of people getting 99 smithing without incentive.
---
Adding nearly 30% to a number is quite a jump.
---
I can buy it for a reasonable price of 91M plus 234 red chins as a bonus
---
He probably wants to see what he has in his bank
---
Yeah. Potions/runes/etc just get added to yours to get used, not even taken into account tbh.
---
Jagex mentioned in a Q&amp;A that instances cause server performance issues. Otherwise they'd have instances for more bosses.
---
If your appeal has been denied. I would say that's the end of the road for you bud.
---
While I don't like the escalating argument and your examples are very exaggerated, I agree it has to be balanced. Balancing new items/methods is possible. So the question is not if we introduce new stuff (because the answer is yes), but how do we balance it?
---
The only time I step out of these zones is to do my clues.

I hate to hop on this bandwagon, but I figured its worth a shot. I had an account that I started when I was in third or fourth grade, It was my childhood account. I grew up super poor so I always played at the public library, school, or a friends house. We didn't have a computer til I was in middle school. Anyways, This account was stolen from me when I was in 5th or 6th grade in ways that I didn't understand. I would see it online once and awhile and even spoke with the person playing the account at one point from one of my alts. Ive tried to look up the player name in the highscores to see what happened with the account, but it doesn't show up. Is there any way you could help me figure out what happened to my account or possibly grant me access to it again? RSN was Player458 (Very original name I know, Third grade me assumed everyone would know I meant Playa Pimp ladies man player, not video game player.)
---
I never hacked in runescape, i quit the game over 6 months ago and only came back to see if id like to play osrs again. i dont know why i got banned, the only thing i did in in those days is try to buy a bond on the ge, and getting wine of zamorak. i play on mobile and never considered using bots or auto clickers
---
2 bans for the same offence within 10 days? Doesn't look good.
---
This is a very oddly worded smack down....
---
&gt;The big complaints I hear are things like agility exp topping out at 65 or 70k/hr, depending on your desired intensity, when it started out at like 10k/hr, and slayer exp per hour capping out realistically at 40k/hr if you do all super efficient tasks with cannons and don't make any/much profit.
---
Yeah, there should be an agility minigame that gives good exp and is engaging. Maybe an arena of sorts where you have to navigate obstacles to try and get tickets which you can trade in for rewards ranging from novelty items to EXP.
---
I think it should go somewhere on Karamja tbh.
---
i dont know what to say, i never botted on osrs or used auto clickers, untill that point i hadnt played osrs for over 6 months
---
It sucks man automated response, I know what flagged me was one click construction. At the time did t realise it woukd cause such problem, but after all the recent events after and people I have spoke to ha e realised what caused the ban.

I'm lost without my account no motivation. To start another either :(

Yeah, painting everyone with a broad brush will always get you shit on. I'm also almost 2.1k total and skilling is the reason I play. I don't PvM or PvP and I'm pursuing my 11th 99 right now. Idk why people are suddenly getting your clown-ass mentality when skilling is what the game is built on.

Hey Mod Steve,
---
Since you're nice enough to look into old accounts I have an old account that I would just like some closure on specifically my first rs3 account. I believe it got banned in 2013 or 2014 for major macro but I never botted and think if it was due to an old yahoo email account leak, also that was a period of time I never played on that account (was in undergraduate studies at the time and addicted to League of legends) I came back around 2015 and attempted to login but saw it was banned quit again because of that and started several osrs accounts in 2016, maxed my main at the beginning of this year and started playing hcim. The only other thing I could think of is I was playing on a mac before the official client came out between 2010-2012ish. Just would like some closure and if I can get it back great. If not thats ok too.

To expound a bit more on BH heres what put the nail in the coffin to kill it off: they changed it so you had to risk an emblem to pk one or get the small chance of a t1 drop so basically it comes down to skill gap like you said. Some one new cant profit when they are forced to risk a 100k emblem to possibly receive a 100k emblem. Before you still had the chance to get one regardless and you could pk some one experienced for a high tier without risking, which would obv be more profitable for a beginner.

I'd say if you're updating a skill so drastically that it will affect veterans, give veterans some recognition like having their skillcape be different than the new generation that got it after the skill became easier to train.
---
Ohhh ye it‚Äôs November. I banged one out last night so I‚Äôm out of this game already.
---
Runelite updated to comply with the new rules the same day as the statement was released, after working with Jagex for weeks to ensure everything was agreed on, and prepared for. Adam was one of the "stakeholders" Jagex mentioned.
---
Rest assured, using RL wont get you in trouble, can't speak for other clients
---
It baffles me that you're here looking into this, we've felt lost for ages over stuff like this. Hate to jump on this as well but it feels like it might be my only option.
---
I had my account hijacked recently, I hadn't been on for a few weeks but I can't get online the password has been changed, i've got access to my email (A .mail account) and there's nothing there to say it was taken. I also put an account recovery email in and didn't get a response, and I can't find it on the hiscores any more as the name's been changed I think.

It's actually pretty rare to get pked doing air orbs. It never happened to me once on my ironman when I was doing it. Also you're exaggerating the trip time a bit.

i don't think jagex should have opened them in the first place tbh

About to start my first HCIM. Was wondering what some of the best things to afk on a 118cmbt 2k total main whilst I play the hardcore. Was probably gonna start ZMI and mining, but other than that and NMZ is there anything else relatively afk that is worthwhile skilling or money making wise. (Things where i can focus on hardcore more since ill likely be starting at wintertodt)
---
Next time don't run and hide from Jad before he spawns. Stay in the area the off colored 360 spawns because that's where Jad will spawn. Only do 1 thing between Jad attacks (not including prayer change). Jad attack, 1 potion dose, Jad attack, change pray + potion, Jad attack, 1 attack to healer, and so on. The wiki shows his 2 animations. Once I figured this out, I haven't failed a single attempt
---
nice
---
That was a different guy, happened to have the same offenses but the dates listed were different
---
yes but use [Runelite.net](https://Runelite.net)
---
Shut the fuck up
---
What method are you doing?
---
Late 2020. Has to wait for clan upgrades.
---
That's great. Rule enforcement is one of the most important things on old school game servers. :)
---
Yes, theres a huge post on the homepage about them.
---
zmi, bloods when you get there, mlm, wc, fishing, afk slayer, plank make, sorceress' garden if you set up the 1 click method, smith dart tips, cooking, crafting, herblore w/ stamina/antivenom/extended super antifire, wt as well
---
you have a few options
---
Hey welcome to RuneScape i love that new people are playing this game as other people said killing cows in Lumbridge is the best way to profit in the early game you can further increase your profit by tanning the hide in al kharid which increases the profit per hide by 15gp (costs 1gp to tan each hide into leather) if you need any more help in the future please dont hesitate to add me my IGN is Almighty502
---
In 528 hours you got get maybe lvl 50 RC. So time well spent
---
I'll allow it

Called it

Multi tick drifting!?!
---
ok boomer
---
Its fake though. Mod Ash confirmed in the past that the tutorial island activities have no pet chance coded into them
---
cool, thank you!
---
Could've been 0. That's 3 items you didn't have before.
---
Be more grateful
---
&gt;  But if you wanna convince yourself you're doing it for gp that's what I'm calling delusional
---
We enjoy this part of the game, you don't. Get over it. I'm not even going to read your sentences.
---
I only use vanilla :/ but.. I'll always use an attack potion beforehand to get the most out of the boost. Also, if I want the best occult alter, can I make that at any time? I dont see the 3 alter in build mode.
---
Chronicle should do the trick here. Also go make money and buy laws, just teleporting everywhere is so much nicer.
---
Probably because after they've scammed a fuck ton, buying 2 bonds to double name change is nothing, and helps them scam even more dumb people.
---
Because its not possible :) OP is lying
---
I died at the N O C H E S T B R A H part LOL. Incredible video yet again, thanks for the content. Congrats on the sick cape.

I'm honestly looking forward to this mode, I'm hoping it will bring some of the group back to the game as everyone has drifted away for various reasons.

I have been doing North Suqah's with a cannon, and still burning through 2 or 3 full inventory's of prayer potions and food. When they drop absolutely nothing.. I resent the supply costs of over 1.2mil. It is, like a realisation that this game is just designed to purposely frustrate and infuriate. I mean every dungeon is vastly overpopulated with monsters that re-spawn seconds after death, the monsters themselves.. well.. I mean really SAFE SPOTS??!?? As an actually accepted mechanic? Come on really!?! It's lazy game design and totally non-involving for the player. Yes it is an OLD game but so was Everquest(the original) and that was significantly, to say vastly superior in every regard.
---
These Suqah tasks being thrown at me over and over.. just serves as an illustration to me that this game and I do not have a future together.  I cancelled two paid accounts.
---
played since 2010, slowly with the ge mostly
---
1 click construction is not even detectable , it‚Äôs just against the rules
---
Bye
---
i never said it wasn't funny. i just said it's become predictable
---
I play the game for skilling. If I wanted to pvp/pve I'd play wow or something. No other game offers skilling in the form that RS does.
---
Underrated response

Yes of course, if you created the account you are the only person that can recover it - go for it!

This is my friend. When we were younger I always did our capes and he did shitty quests I didn't want to do. Last year he told me he was playing again and he wanted a firecape and asked me if I could still kill jad if he got to wave 59 because he always panics and hits the wrong button. We're in our late 20s.
---
???
---
Name of the account?
---
hey everyone it seems to be that there are some gold selling websites going under due to probemas taking over the comunity they have single handedly taken over the buisness why should you try them out? well let's start with there reward program there reward program is absolutely amazing rewards up to 3rd age including the longsword axe and pickaxes! now let's move on to there amazing staff that are 24/7 and more then understanding and helpful with any questions you may have.
---
CHEAPEST &amp; FASTEST
---
Osrs/rs3 gp @ probemas.com
---
With exclusive loyalty program, since 2013
---
Damn got literally everything except for elite void. Oh well, clan sounds pretty sweaty anyways
---
Noob doesn‚Äôt even play. How do you not recognize tutorial island?
---
If your ban reason is "bug abuse" then yes
---
Not allowed
---
I don't wanna get abuse, I just want some nice kid who plays rs to get a decent account so it doesn't get wasted!
---
That is fair, I'll message you in DMs once I have it available. I travel for work so I don't have my desktop available to me atm
---
Good bot.
---
Additionally does anyone know how to edit/add to the current one?
---
Most people get the 99 to have a sense of achievement because they can show it to other players.
---
People are scared the more people that have that 99/cape then it will mean less.
---
I personally have 99 agility, but if the new content comes out and it's better xp/phr I don't care.. Others however do I guess.
---
Doing something that few others do surely isn‚Äôt where all the fun comes from. I can make up arbitrary things that no one else does but would not be considered fun (to 99.999999% of people) like longest time spent picking up and dropping the same item.
---
REDDIT SHOULD NOT BE UR CUSTOMER SERVICE U FUCKING CUNTS!!!!
---
I was thinking the same thing, lol.
---
Then be responsible enough to keep your password private
---
i dunno about that https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/droynf/can_a_mod_explain_this_to_me/f6lg35l?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x
---
Bruh what
---
Well when the day comes (which it will) that the original creator wants the account back, he/she will get it no problem, you will have no recourse at all and anything you have added to the account in terms of time invested, achievements or money will be handed over to the creator - you'll also make yourself look like a hijacker. I'm not naive enough to think that nobody shares accounts, but I would honestly not advise it - I see the fall out of shares gone wrong too often!
---
So they are selling ingame items which you can sell for gold? What's your point?
---
Also reddit:
---
They can't detect me using banned 3rd party plugins so I'll keep using them reeeeeeeeeee
---
Yes I thought this might have been the case at first but I  double checked each time and it was correct
---
its funny because the benefits you listed have nothing to do with actual smithing. basically the only point in training smithing is to achieve requirements for non-smithing related activities
---
It's funny how the "pros" columns in these types of posts usually boil down to "It won't make the game worse". Really think we need to come up with some better reasons to change things up.
---
Obviously by just threatening them over and over again until they gave up. Jagex are a pathetic company
---
Speak for yourself
---
83 agility here and I get 45k xp phr. If you have access to Vorkath or raids the profit from bloods is not worth it considering it will take you 35 hours longer.
---
It's the same for all bosses. I was afraid to fight bandos for a long time. Near the same stats and I run groups and solo him all the time. I just tried solo one day and said I'll do my best. Be confident and dont be afraid to die(unless you're a hcim)
---
Venezualens out here throwing tbs in black hide lol
---
Bond prices are about to drop hard, I'd sell your stockpile now before they 1 mil each
---
What do you mean? The reqs are barely like 200m and the CCs mainly for endgame content/raids its pretty reasonable.....
---
As an iron I‚Äôm not too concerned with the GP and this short grind was to stock pile scales and shoot for a mutagen. But on average every 10 kills is 1m gp. So at 3000 KC, as a main I would of made at least 300m.
---
yep I'm just switching when necessary. What happened last night is I was trying to take my time but I didn't have a good rhythm and I lost focus on one thing at a time. I definitely have enough supplies when I get to that point, but I definitely don't want to spawn the healers a second time.
---
Did you take a shit in your screen lol, windex at least
---
He's saying they're having ongoing legal battles with all the sites that's why he can't mention anything. Bonds are about to drop hard af.
---
Sets you you up so much in this game. One of the best early game goals imo
---
[deleted]
---
Ok boomer
---
Have you tried talking to Oziach?
---
Wheres the total
---
The only way to really make sure nobody forgets is to make it a meme
---
Yeah get a maxed house. 83 con and boost with crystal saw and stews. Left overs could be used to get zenytes.
---
200m isnt a budget my friend. Buy god dhide and obby top/legs. Buy bis rings and neck slots. Blowpipe and the whip/bludgeon
---
https://youtu.be/yu6WxJJ_MbE
---
For those curious
---
Mate all the banned features have already been removed from clients. Everyone saying "well I'm still going to use a 3pc" thinks they are doing it and getting away with something, when in reality jagex aren't against 3pc, just some of their features.
---
With all those features now gone, there is nothing wrong with using 3pc.
---
Plz be aware when I say 3pc in this context I'm only actually referring to runelite as that's the only one I've used and the only one where I know what features they had previously/now.
---
Because no matter what's on your interface, you'll still commonly panic at Jad your first time. Managing the healers and keeping your prayer switches accurate is difficult if it's your first ever time. Having a blowpipe vs Karils doesn't make managing the fight any easier, maybe just a bit faster.
---
&gt;Just rinse and repeat until rng swings your way
---
Did you forget what game youre playing?
---
go to the items sheet, create a new line in the helms section, and add it.
---
that was amazing thank you
---
Try joining OS GWD cc
---
Interesting idea, but unfortunately I have all the onyxes I need. Could probably find something else to spend Tokkul on.
---
The whole idea behind the beat up chair os you restore it, not sell as is.
---
ooh nice 2. x 10\^6 gp loot
---
Yea, idk enough of the history to really speak on it so I will take your word for it. I have really only been back the last few months since literally years ago.  
---
As soon as I saw it my first thought was "MTX" but I play HCIM so it doesn't really affect me and it's easy to ignore.
---
Bogla gold and acuse gold have went under and no longer are rwt due to probemas taking over all there clientel
---
Yeah theres literally a house walking around on chicken legs and this dude has a problem with realistic architecture
---
Just get defence up and get barrows gloves
---
And several months before that
---
This isn't about money, it's mostly for ironmen because it's incredibly slow to make them. Only bots make them for money as it's pretty shitty (200k/H?) but has next to no requirements.
---
It actually doesn't affect your chances of a barrows item, only the # of brothers killed affects that
---
Probly somewhere between 15-25%, depending on what gear exactly
---
Smi-ed lmfao. Perfect.
---
Underrated
---
Really depends on how much blue one cast the range. With that you can get rekt ez if he does it every kill 3-4 times. If this doesn't happen often you can get 4-5 ez. Depends on gear aswell but full maxed is 4-5 really doable!
---
It looks like its drawn on with a crayon
---
if you can't target demand you will never win this war
---
Haha
---
Can you let me know? I need more stories to break.
---
When you buy the bonds from jagex they are already tradable. So there's no gold sink for the majority of bonds. Only if you are flipping or giving to an iron man.
---
Have you ever submitted a customer support ticket sheep man? Maybe if you actually thought for yourself instead of going along with the masses you would know they are very helpful. Baaaa
---
He looks like he is about to drop the hottest Code Snippet of 2007
---
People realise this is ironic, right?
---
No problem lmk if you have any other issues.
---
If you don't use adblock a lot of gold selling site ads play on youtube or any other site with google ads
---

---
Oh I misread.  Vorkath really shouldn‚Äôt be done on a zerk unless you‚Äôre using DHCB.  The difference in bp and bgs vs DHCB(optionally with using bp on acid phase) is 1-3 kills versus 4-6(anything over 6 is a waste because of inventory space). 
---
The kill times are also a massive difference.  I actually hold a 38 second PB on vork because of 7 b2b ruby specs. Usually kill time is around 1:20-40 with dhcb and you also take less damage because you aren‚Äôt needing to pray mage to become 100% dragon fire resistant. 
---
So with all that in mind, Vorkath is not &gt; Zulrah unless you have dhcb.  And even so Zulrah most likely is still probably better profit than Vorkath, just not AS consistent.
---
They already said in a Q&amp;A they won‚Äôt
---
stfu boomer
---
Bonds have never had high value. You were just buying gold at double the price.
---
Yeah that was exactly my experience. I don‚Äôt mind tanking, I‚Äôm just sick of it rn cuz I‚Äôd like to actually get some KC
---
I did use it but stopped about year and a half ago. It is kind of strange though and more than anything since they haven‚Äôt been able to fix it on their support page it says they are trying to fix it but limited only to a few players.
---
You know there are 100s of other gold selling sites. Shutting two down isn't going to make bonds crash.
---
Or super afk for good xp and okay profits
---
Time to panic sell all my zulrah scales
---
I'm glad they're banned! Every time I buy gold on my Ironman they scam me and don't trade me the gold! Good riddance
---

Hey, I‚Äôm a free to play account at the moment. I may eventually become a member though, really enjoying the game and the community so far. I am currently doing the cow hide strategy and working up my secondary skills (woodcutting and fishing)
---
GENUINELY one of the best PEEKAYS i've had all day
---
Nah, fuck that shit mate. RNG isn't sacred in the slightest, and when it leads to situations like this you absolutely change it. It's a game, it should be fun. Pets that require a ridiculous amount of hours to grind aren't fun, because that doesn't change the fact that thousands of noobs will still get them at level 60 or so. RNG should be progressive after 99.
---
I just did, now pay me.
---
Sure bro, hit me up on here if you want to do some bandos sometime :)
---
Goodluck you think if player auctions could get hit they wouldn't of already been hit by bigger studios.
---
You can apply to this for the entire game. "It's a marginal bonus, you don't need to grind for it." See what I mean? All goals are valid, and some people play this game exclusively to hunt for pets.
---
Ya I decided to do slayer while hammered. My slayer task was earth warriors so was in the wildy. Not my brightest choice lol
---
i think we‚Äôre all guilty of this to be quite honest
---
Lmfao yes and I've been perm banned with no way to appeal it. Are you fucking dense?
---
I got perm banned with no way to appeal it. No one to talk to live. Nothing. I couldnt even send in a fucking response or anything. And who is very helpful? The mods? Yea only when theres been a big stink.
---
If you don't enjoy rc you really don't need to do it.
---
Randomness is what kills the fun in skilling, especially skill based skills like rc.
---
You can do lava runners for peak efficiency
---
You're the opposite of me.
---
Yea jagex isnt the best with customer support either. Good luck mate, I hope you resolve the issue.
---
All gold MUST GO!
---
nobody:
---
me: 3 maxed tbowers, oh wait,  living the dream
---
Blood in and blood out
---
It's definitely a big part of it in a game where higher number = more better
---
Slayer needs no buffs
---
Slayer is in a great place right now as it seems the vast majority of the playerbase finds doing their slayer tasks worthwhile
---
Thanks for that. Don't have the assembler so gonna keep doing for that and the slayer helm then back to zulra. Didn't even know what that staff was you mentioned. Look forward to giving that a go, sounds very op at zulra
---
It makes me want to throw up looking at it.
---
Not op, but I always shot for a min of 60. Be it in one spec or both. I think most guides recommend 60+ bugs damage in both specs
---
I remember doing this right before I got my first kill back in the day when it released. I was at work running all the scenarios through my head and pumping myself up.
---
Good times.
---
And this is why we play ironman
---
Ty for bring attention to this. Enjoy the gold.
---
LMAOOOO
---
Not to toot my own horn too much, but [this would be perfect](https://i.redd.it/oiolua81e9g31.png). It makes the RNG scale very slowly, up to 2x drop rate at around 100m exp. This would reduce the amount of people going dry 100m+ exp by about 90%.
---
honestly mobile is garbage
---
GUYS THIS IS FUNNY HES SMOKING WEED GZ 99 ERBLORE
---
I'm usually 99% incapacitated when stoned, like driving games= i just crash into walls all the time and can't do shit, and i can't stand up to go the kitchen, but Runescape, it's chill. One time i just sat in varrock forrest chopping and burning logs, then wandered around, was pretty cool.
---
Why
---
NOOOO NOT BOGLA.... i mean, nice job jagex, you get em
---
If you bring a lot of brews and restore you will be able to tank atleast half a Tb, since they didn't make you waste your supplies by baiting you at first. Also, bring a dihn's bulwark and some D hide.
---
Run around the goblins, it'll make it very hard to hit you. If you are able to box a goblin, brew down as fast as you can so your stats are at 0s, but I find it actually difficult to box a goblin, unlike a spider at the KBD. Also, I love praying mage right until another player gets on me and then switch to melee for their specs and back to mage.
---
@die_nub_plz fuck you loser LMAO
---
(he owned both websites)
---
It was probably so people couldn't break rules (i.e. offensive language/botting) and use the old excuse "i went to get a drink and my friend went on my account and said bad words" excuse. We were all kids back then, we tried this shit.
---
And that's the real problem. Progressive RNG please!
---
Since the desert amulet 4 is a free, infinite, wearable teleport I'd say it's the equivalent of having both the ornate pool and the skill cape. And since 99 &gt; 78 I think it's fair that ornate pool with cape is better.
---
Yes it can't hurt, I assume you mean 'years' between appeals rather than months
---
It's a reasonable assumption based on the number of people with 92 smithing at this moment and the fact that currently, rune plateleg smithing is profitable. Don't get demand confused with the number of people - not everyone with 90+ smithing will use the rune bars. The issue isn't the update in the long term but the initial shock because rune platelegs/skirts/2hes are currently one of the fastest smithing methods that is also profitable (225k exp/hr with about 500k profit/hr. If the update does not delete every rune bar in the game first, the scenario I outlined is highly likely to occur which is specifically why RS3 removed all rune ores, bars, and smithed items during the M&amp;S rework).
---
It's kinda good that it's predictable because that means that people haven't forgo
---
The herb on the curb
---
I vote no to xp increasing content because increasing xp/hr of skills will make this game worse imo.
---
Just like how in rs3 99's dont mean fuck all. In osrs some 99's still are impressive and just because you don't want to skip the grind for rewards doesn't mean the game would be better off for it.
---
The less you have to work for shit the less meaningful it becomes. Twisted Bow is cool because you need to grind a lot to get it. Magic shortbow isnt.
---
haha too bad i'm too busy maxing
---
Literally nothing will happen. There are hundreds more gold sites out there and new ones will pop up.
---
Jagex really needs to cool it with these bans.
---
Not so alone
---
Its zulrah dudd
---
Okay please keep in mind you're not a psychic. When you say you're "predicting" anything it's because you have done enough of the activity that you're starting to memorize at least parts of rotations. 
---
I also find it funny you disagree with my method of learning when it takes less time, costs less gp to learn, and commits the rotations to memory making you more efficient at killing zulrah. 
---
If youd rather just do what OP did go ahead.
---
Jagex added a clue scroll boss to elite / master clues. When you open one of the proper tiered caskets there is a chance it could be a mimic casket in which case you go to Watson‚Äôs house and you can enter the mimic fight there. You have to enable it first by talking to the casket in Watson‚Äôs house iirc. Don‚Äôt quote me on that.
---
I red that people get banned for auto clickers and sort of apps, wouldn't this trigger that too? I'm 4-5 weeks into osrs and i dont  want to get banned for using third party apps.

Your examples have a different value then the staff: When you buy that staff, you will need to alch 614344 times to balance your costs of this staff (today's prices). Beside this fact, this unlock would not be free, for like 1000 slayer rewards points, it's even more time it will cost. A moss giant task of 60-120 kills has like 1.8 Mossy keys. The chance of getting this task is like 4%. Do you see how much hours it still will cost? 614344 / 1200 alchs/h is more than 500 hours. With the like 1k unlock points and the chances to get this task for still only 1.8 keys, it even way more. I think it's important to only talk about the whole picture.
---
Rune 2h and runite is 1/64, gmaul 1/256. I have no idea where you're getting 67 million
---
Suqah my nuts
---
The nexus itself is very expensive. Id say buy a level 2, and the teleports you know youll use often. (I.e. Lunar isle if you do vorkath often, ge, seers for quick banking) they are 10x more expensive than regular portals
---
It's not a joke though, spending 50 hours in f2p to buy a bond is downright retarded.
---
DUDE
---
I have fat fingers okay.
---
Got farming pet at 54....so ya, I know :D
---
Smithing cape, contruction cape, and max cape unlock content. Also skill total worlds unlock content which is an average of 96 because u cant kill certain people if u cant enter their world.
---
Does anyone else find it comical that the username of OP is one of the most popular botting scripts on that particular website?
---
Nice advertising scheme.

*Blizzcon Intensifies*
---
Ouch....
---
huh?
---
Have you tried raids? Bigger drops and you still make okay gp/hour without a unique item.
---
Maybe he was the guy that died with the cats think about it
---
Oof
---
You are suggesting a minor buff
---
My reasoning is the same even if its a small buff
---
Decent players do construction tick perfect on the official client.
---
Yeah you might struggle finding tob teams but other than that you're good
---
yea, their ban system really blows
---
It‚Äôs f2p now. Dunno why you‚Äôre randomly appearing there, but it‚Äôs f2p.
---
it kind of was revived in force with the guy on live news recently that ended his interview with "aaannnd Epstein didn't kill himself :)". It's not only trendy here but pretty much in every online community at the moment.
---
You're crying about "being dry on a pet" when you're only halfway the supposed droprate?
---
I see.
---
Jagex be like: ‚Äúoh, 3rd party client?‚Äù
---
##BAN HIM
---
You said you were brewed, if you didn't restore then the chance is pretty good. Also it's difficult to know the chance without knowing their gear aswell.
---
It‚Äôs all about dosage dude and tolerance affects effective dosage
---
Lock it behind a 100% complete collection log
---
Why would fewer competitors lower the prices. 
---
Unless ofcourse they liquidate the GP in a sell-off, but that's still only temporarily.
---
If anything it gives the Venezuelans more marketshare.
---
Mmm nope. At no point is it good exp or gp. It's a trash boss by definition. Can only do a few kills pre trip and the trips take long as fuck. Best drop is trash, fight is trash. It's all trash.
---
Part of the mystery thank you. I have seen a couple weird obscure posts about the same issue. Idk, pretty strange
---
It's watermarked and this guy still stole it from that whatistthiswowscape guy
---
&gt;About your definition of a "buff": When you buy that staff, you will need to alch 614344 times to balance   your costs of this staff (today's prices). Beside this fact, this unlock   would not be free, for like 1000 slayer rewards points, it's even more   time it will cost. A moss giant task of 60-120 kills has like 1.8  Mossy  keys.

Maybe if you feel miserable in the pursuit of your goal, you should stop. Is this some kind of checkbox you must tick?

You are the one subjecting yourself to misery voluntarily and for no concrete gain, and complaining that the RNG gods are unfair because they haven't allowed you to check that box.
---
You do not have to hunt a cosmetic rare drop. You set your own goal knowing full well the odds are stacked against you, you don't get to whine and beg to the developers to make it easier for you to check an arbitrary box that you yourself created because you now find the odds unfair.
---
Nice!  How many cannonballs did you make to get Ballsy?
---
Well, I never said I was dry on the pet. I understand how drop rates work. My question was aimed to other people and their struggles my dude.
---
Pretty sure they have to be unnoted
---
What? If you can make 2m p/hr then x30 would be 60m? 
---
A bond buys you 5.2m gold. Maybe I've read what you've written wrong. But I've read it at least 4 times and can't see it being any other way
---
How can you add the new verseion to the edit ? I can‚Äôt find the file option?
---
It‚Äôs not just smithing, nearly all skills are dead content nowadays after getting quest and diary reqs. Thanks slayerscape!
---
Congrats lad.
---
If you would calculate further with the information I gave you, you would see this "buff" isn't a buff or one for a few %. This would not harm the game.
---
I can understand that. There is a valid point to not ruining the game, and I‚Äôm not saying we should add things like the giant prayer afk crystal from RS3. I just don‚Äôt get the idea of locking a skill behind a max exp rate. Most players would enjoy mini games the keep you engaged if it‚Äôs the best exp rate, but we all know the worst kind of player would crawl out of the woodwork saying it‚Äôs ruining the integrity of OSRS.
---
I love the idea of in-demand clue item rewards! Thank you
---
Oh gotcha. So it's kind of an internet bandwagon thing. Thanks
---
&gt;**Seeing as I‚Äôm halfway to drop rate with no luck** (except for all the bank made obviously,) **but my question is what‚Äôs the longest dry streak any of you have gone for a pet**, just to get a glimpse of **the nightmare I should be expecting.**
---
Might want to re read what you said buddy.
---
The hellish relish
---
I want this so bad on iOS lol
---
The Great Olm has smothered you in acid. It starts to drip.
---
More of the same isn't content, it's a perk. If you want to move more coal, run twice, the smithing cape makes stuff faster, it doesn't unlock anything new. If you want to teleport to any POH portal, you can use those nmz scrolls. Everything unlocked by any of the capes is a perk and not actual content.
---
Yea done quite a few. Like to change things up though.
---
Yeah, they have to be unnoted. It can definitely be a real pain for things that need a lot of items.
---
How about selling? (Asking for a friend)
---
A full 56gp per inventory, thank god it's afk
---
my thing about Underground Pass is that it's such a self-contained, thematically connected story. All the horrible shit you have to do (killing the unicorn/paladins), the creepy messages in the chatbox, koftik going insane, making the doll, it's so good imo, but like you said it's all a matter of opinion
---
r/woosh
---
Rune dragons, scale fishing, infernal eels, amethyst mining, blood RC.
---
I'm usually not interested in this man - but I've gotta admit, that was pretty sick
---
Why is Rune even 85?
---
Like who's going to reach 90 smithing and think: "*Whew, I can finally upgrade to Rune Scimitar now!*"
---
The levels don't make any sense tbh. I have zero incentive outside of going for the skill cape to even go level smithing up. I do what I need for the quest and then peace out of that skill.
---
Do a series where your locked on one tile.... see as you cant move call it the leglesshcim series
---
Yeah kraken is a nice easy one tbh if i was gonna go dry at least it is there, with sang staff i can do a whole task without banking. agility sucks though i actually hate it with a passion
---
chiken tendies good
---
These are getting really obvious
---
Gotcha, thanks for getting back to me
---
lmao everyday
---
Someone else has been logging onto your account
---
When items are added and not removed, overtime this is going to happen. It's why we need some kind of universal item sink, so glories/gmauls/etc aren't alch price.
---
I feel like everyone says that but i've never really gotten it
---
chin
---
Well It isn't proof of getting b2b2b2b .. u could get many other low worth drops betweens those r2h.. so it could be easily faked
---
Someone panicing and spamming brews lol. That considered tho, probably what someone else said. Around 15-25%

---
Jagex should add this as new decoration to POH. It looks amazing to be honest. :)
---
I thought the rules state you can change which key does the command as long as it‚Äôs still 1:1, so it would be legal for you to bind a key on the keyboard for left click making it so you would never move the mouse while arching.
---
THIS.
---
dude is full of shit, I played since 2005 and it was never against the rules
---
It's for the ffa portal, 50m cheaper alternative to ornate pool
---
There will always be good sites. Just like there will always be bots.
---
RIP Gear!
---
Defo not b2b2b, games filtered, should have shown it unfiltered bro, better luck next time.
---
Hahaha jiggledix bad
---
So I guess their detection system would more focus on the interval between clicks then?
---
High as fuck and didn‚Äôt get the meme for a minute
---
Lol I did like 3 from start to finishing ds1. 600????????
---
I wish i still played this game, because of this post i just realized i can actually play this game while being high.  When i played rs like 12 years ago i was too young to even know what weed was.
---
Lmao, Ballsy XD
---
No, RS3 removed rune ores, bars, and smithed items because people who had been hoarding them would wake up and find that the entire Rune market CRASHED on release, because Rune went from being 90+ smithing to 40, with 6\~ new tiers of items released that were greater than it. Most (not all) of the items got replaced with those scraps that were equal to the alch value of what Rune used to be so that people could recover. The demand for Rune dropped considerably when smithing and mining got reworked on RS3, platebodies went from being around 50k to like 10k the day after the update.
---
And obviously, if the level requirement gets lowered for Rune on Smithing, it needs to be offset by a lower requirement for Mining as well, with ore supplies being increased as well to avoid potential issues. The problem with applying real-world economics to games like this is that JAGEX HAS THE POWER TO DIRECTLY INTERVENE WITH ISSUES.
---
Lower
---
Gl with that, the elusive pika-chin is honestly such a flex to have
---
Looks to me as though you got banned for Real World Trading Goldfarmer.
---
I didn't have access to this account at the time of the ban and just recently retrieved my account to find out I was banned back in 2011.
---
Edit: is there anyway of getting this undone. Like I said I didn't have access to the account at the time of the ban.
---
I once got muted for "encouraging bug abuse." I was doing an herb run, there were oggleroots just on the ground and someone near by asked me what they were. I said something like "Idk pick it up and find out?"
---
Turns out oggleroots were smuggled out of some minigame, me telling him to pick it up was apparently encouraging bug abuse so I got muted for 3 days.
---
Yesn't
---
High as fuck more like you could‚Äôve done better I am ashamed, if you was high enough you wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the fish
---
Jagex is the gold selling website.
---
Just getting back into the game. I have 70 attack, 65 str/def. I'm still wearing a rune platebody; what should be my next upgrade as far as that goes? Fighter Torso?
---
I'm wearing dragon boots and usually just a slayer helm when doing tasks
---
You really think Jagex has the power to shut down gold selling sites in parts of the world they UK/EU have no power?
---
People like this who are actually helpful do need more recognition
---
No, nostalgia is a lot like Kudzu. It will spread, strangle, and kill everything it touches unless it's brought under control.
---
Does it roll?
---
You're right. They should add something better than this. Maybe a new BIS helm and give it to a mob that level 90 ironmen can kill afk. Meanwhile end game content is bottle-necked by power-creep and useful perks from grandmaster quests are something in short supply. Not to mention, we're unlocking the nightmare with this update.
---
Fish plugin?
---
That ties directly into what i said about not knowing the combat formula. Look at pures etc.
---
15 noted steel bars is about 1/20 from gargoyles, that‚Äôs where I got basically all of mine. Otherwise the blast furnace can stock you up pretty quickly as well. 
---
Unless you have a lot of time to afk for cballs (I personally don‚Äôt) I wouldn‚Äôt recommend seeking out a canon early. The time saved in slayer doesn‚Äôt come even close to making up for the time spent making cballs. I used my canon for lizardman shaman kills in the multi area (be prepared to get crashed a LOT if you try this) and for racking up black knight kills for master clues, and that is about it.
---
with master clues i would say yes. Masters have decent drops and alchables even without uniques.
---
do them while u can, jaws will crash massively once theres enough in tye game and demand falls
---
It hops
---
Not asking for it to be #1 priority but im not the only one. They dont need a whole building full of employees for a legal battle. That's why they have customer support to help their customers out with their own private situation while others work on different tasks.
---
Bonds gonna skyrocket
---
The even more interesting restricted accounts will be the new pking irons that get gear they normally wouldn't from their group. Low hp dark bow irons will dominate, but I suck at pvp and don't know if anything more sinister can be brewed.
---
I don't think smithing is worthless, there is a very obvious need for all the dart and arrow tips/heads. I can see what people mean when they say it's worthless because the armor isn't that good, but I think it actually has a good level balance still, mostly because of the ranged ammo strength that you unlock. When you couple smithing with fletching, crafting and magic, you are able to make the best ranged ammo (minus a couple other options) at very high smithing levels, which should be the case. Now we all see the ranged smithing is still viable for today's game/levels. 
---
Ok let's move on to the armor which is the cause for people thinking smithing is dead. Yes getting to upper 90s for mere rune armor sucks and should not be the case. But if you take into consideration the other things you can make, it has to be that way. Smithing is designed in a way that you learn how to smelt/shape harder and harder metals. So if you're not going to be able to smith rune arrow tips until 90 smithing which is the first rune item you learn to shape, then it makes sense and should follow that much larger items requiring more rune needs a higher level and more experience to make. Yes rune armor sucks especially if you're making your own because it will take ages for you to actually get it. But rune arrows/darts are still very commonly used in almost every situation and they are still very strong. 
---
Tldr: rune arrows/darts are still really strong, can't lower armor reqs without lowering arrow/bolt levels. Arrow/bolts are in a good place level-wise.
---
It would take the fun out of the game. Most of it is grinding so i guess i would go pet hunting and shit.
---
has anyone else had issues trying to claim it?
---
I never saw a point in botting. I was in the game for the fun of playing with my friends and when they got off so did i. I only within the last year or two started playing again. Finally remembered like four days ago what my login in for was and was able to recover my account to find this.
---
Not sure this will really make the game more social but aight.
---
Dont rely on shit to fix itself. Get the auth back up asap or you risk your acct
---
It's pretty pathetic that people reeeee about another person joining in a boss fight that's designed to be fought with a group just because it might slightly lower their GP. But that's the new "oldschool" for ya.
---
E
---
"Will not be playing anymore," lol no shit ur banned.
---
I want to see a PvM clan with black d'hides and rune crossbow as the only requirement. Maybe a cudgel and whip too and iban blasts.
---
It wont lmao. 2 botting websites out of hundreds. And shutting down their website doesnt mean they lost the gold
---
Thanks man
---
Agreed. You could change it by using the respective sq'irk fruit for each season on it.
---
But it's a meme, they're not supposed to be deep
---
life is able to have an objective meaning because life itself is inherently objective
---
Well obviously you wont be playing this anymore, you're banned dude
---
Send the story + evidence to tipoff@jagex.com
---
To me it implied that you can make them (4) now by taking them to the ge which boaty can't do because he can only use content that was there on osrs release on this account
---
Very nice.
---
Well yeah, you wont be playing anymore. You‚Äôre banned.
---
Any way to do this on an iphone?
---
Mobile login screen on a laptop. 3/10
---
Lmao so I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôve watched guides on all the wildy boss safe spots hoping to one day build the courage to go out there, but you see when I was a wee lad I was lured by a group of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù saying we were gonna camp kbd, then proceeded to run a train on my poor defenseless 8yo self. I‚Äôve had trust issues ever since.
---
You can't alch bonds. Maybe that's the value used to calculate items kept on death or something though
---
Well, when you have maxed players and ironman players having an argument almost identical to the phrase  "if i had to do this terrible (subjective) grind then so should you" against regular players, then of course people would compare memes like this to Runescape.
---
I hate that Wolf said ‚Äútrust me you don‚Äôt want it‚Äù. Obviously people want the option, and it‚Äôs so easy to implement. Obviously it‚Äôs not the best for all situations, but for very low inventory/other tab interaction activities (agility, fishing, woodcutting) it‚Äôs so nice. Holding a phone landscape while walking sucks.
---
Or maybe legit players will play this for fucking fun instead of sweating? The high level community is miniscule
---
If you‚Äôre okay with using Runelite they have an appimage and a jar file. Works great for me. 
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to play the official client on Linux, maybe through Wine?

And in almost all cases the chair is a piece of crap regardless of the condition and you will get nowhere near $100 for it.

Didn't pick up on the sarcasm huh?

Man Runecrafting 99 is such a grind. I have a 19 hour flight tomorrow and I did the math: If I Runecrafted for 15 of those hours, I'd only get from level 75 to level 80. IN 15 HOURS. 5 LEVELS, and not even halfway! You know how discouraging that is? What an achievement man, congrats
---
Believe that SoloMission used it a fair bit, check comments on some vids?
---
My point was just that all a C&amp;D really says is we may pursue further legal action if you dont stop what you're doing.  Since no action is really being taken, you dont lose anything by issuing the letter.  I.E. if a company has no legitimate legal recourse, a scary C&amp;D might still achieve the desired result.
---
You‚Äôre being a little bitch, false bans happen everyday
---
she must have fat nuts then
---
I love how it suggest 99k is a lot of money for a cape that requires endgame stats and all quests
---
Blizzard is really good about returning items, even if a raid gets ninja looted and a legendary drops they are known to give them back
---
Pretty much all of them have something useful that‚Äôs pretty useful. 
---
Var: mining xp and battlestaves  
---
Lumby: fairy rings without staff  
---
Mory: more tunes at barrows  
---
Western: elite void  
---
Kebos: more blood runes  
---
Kandarin: more marks of grace and bolt specs  
---
Ardy: thieving and herb runs
---
Fremmy: lunar spells
---
Obviously each of these has more and the others have uses too. Those were the best perks off the top of my head.
---
Damn right you won't be playing. The permaban will make sure of that. Go bot somewhere else.
---
\^ This. I'd even pay a crazy fee for reclaiming items or something but getting crashed nonstop everywhere in the game is horrible.
---
I always see their total loot and think they‚Äôre rounding down more often than up.

Common sense isn't special knowledge.  I'm just confused as to why this guy's opinion matters as opposed to the other 7 billion people that are about as informed on the issue.

More of a symptom than a reason in rs3 though

lower the price of your dumb ass membership and bonds and maybe people wont break the rules and buy from you dildos

its still detectable but a lot harder since its 6 hours long...but keep doing that over and its gonna be easy to tell

That wouldn't really make sense to do. If anything, it should be the reverse and the weapons should last longer while skulled. Btw, revs isn't the only spot to use these items.
---
I think it is a great boss - I actually did the pet grind a couple months ago and rarely had to hop worlds more than twice to find an open it
---
Yep, my fav part and before guides are around. Read every line of dialogue on every option, take your time and enjoy it!
---
Laugh (or hate? )all you want, I remember using something like this back in the days of RS2. 
---
Took a wooden plank 30x30x5 (in centimeters), put mouse in the middle of it and nailed a couple of nails in so whenever I put mouse in there it wouldn't move. Then I used same nailing technique on the lego machine that was right next to mouse and used some rubber bands so it wouldn't move. 
---
This way I made 99 magic on 2 accounts with high alching. Never banned for it. I think the click intervals varied every time a bit. I think every click was done in 30ms to 40ms time frame.
---
Good old times. I miss rs2.
---
&gt; reduction in suppliers 
---
but gold resellers dont make that gold they are just middlemen. one company could keep up with the demand that all those other active companies provide at this moment they would just need a bigger capital to buy more gold incase something happens in the game that makes botters/farmers dump their GP like a ban wave or BH emblem rework that happened not too long ago.
---
&gt; An increase in the riskiness of a business also results in higher prices as the supplier needs to be compensated for taking on the additional risk
---
players that buy gold would not accept increased price unless something gets done to GP by jagex that makes GP more scarce like raw resource rework so that bosses drop those resource shards instead of pure alchables or whatever is the suggested thing by that tractor guy
---
so the only way for gold resellers to increase profits due to increased risk and reduced competition is to reduce price at which they buy gold making venezuelans the ones that will suffer most from this crack down on gold sites hence my original comment "poor venezuelans"
---
Well if you think about it, he could do it with even an iron dagger (p) (or bronze dagger too) but he will need a god tier RNG to be able to poison them so there's still a chance
---
Well considering I have my account set to an authenticator and I was banned for the same thing even though I have never been hacked and nothing has ever been wrong when I logged in.
---
How didn‚Äôt work for me? I only got rs3 loot?

And I've never botted and I think that shit ruins the game
---
When does the submit questions for next q&amp;a thread become posted?
---
Rofl you wish it was a whole 10k. Enjoy the spade if anything at all, I'll probably end up protecting it on death
---
How though?  I've seen that asked before and the answer is always yes, but does that mean this detection system can detect click patterns that are SIX HOURS long?  And if so, is there any further limit to it?  Like, would it catch a 12 hour record on repeat?
---
I‚Äôm not too sure I just logged onto twitch and clicked the link that offered the 14 day membership.

i made an alt for cannonballs.  it also does herb/birdhouse runs, collects willow branches and cactus and does it's farming contracts. took like 3 days to set up

Removing gold selling is to maintain game integrity....free membership with twitch prime is a promo to get new players....2 very different things
---
You could go even further and put sleep timer. Make it 1% chance to sleep for a random time. 
---
Even further would be to simulate a random keypress between up, down, left and right arrow buttons. That way you even change camera position randomly.
---
This troll post is strong
---
Agree, I‚Äôd even pay.. money sink!
---
There‚Äôs better sites to RWT off that don‚Äôt particularly even focus mainly on selling RSGP.
---
When has that happened to osrs?
---
Not OP but the logic is this: 
---
I could spend 1 hour in real life making say $15 which equates to say 20-30M in game. 
---
Or I could spend 1 hour in game making 1-3M with the best gold farming methods. 
---
For a fraction of time you can make insane amounts of gold. People with busy lives / jobs then use this logic to justify RWT as they don't have as much time to spend in game earning gold simply to unlock content they want to play. Not saying it's legit, but that is the logic.
---
It's great that you quit, don't need whiny people like you plaguing our "dead game" that has more players than the main game.
---
Keskivertopelaaja :)
---
Also appreciate your feedback, thanks. Perhaps when you have read what I have said, by making a solid, hard alternative way to get Moss Giants as Slayer task, your "would crash **hard**" make no sense. Example: If the unlock was free and the chance to get the task was 50% and the volume was 300 kills, look, than the staff would crash hard indeed. Hopefully this makes it a little clearer.
---
little too late i would say
---
Gold selling was against game integrity because pay 2 win was deemed to be cheating the game. But if jagex is selling gold in the form of bonds, then how is player to player gold sales anymore against game 'integrity' than what they do.
---
Vagina get warm cuz she think max stats hot
---
You don‚Äôt spend much time on the internet do you? There is nothing wrong with art that depicts characters under 18. It‚Äôs been done for centuries, and still happens across all forms of media. If you want to take qualm with actually suggestive art of sub-18 characters, that‚Äôs a separate discussion and I would definitely understand where you were coming from.
---
But you are *really* reaching here when you try to justify your criticism by pointing to tiny barely visible blush lines under her eyes. You sound like the textbook definition of a prude.
---
Remember rsbots.net? Was the most popular bot back around 2012 or so.  Jagex sued them in Massachusetts court, won, and they shut down permanently.  The court case info is publicly available via Google search, so you might gain some insight from that.
---
haha great meme you guys, someone mentioned weed so I said the dude weed thing xD
---
Good point. Testicles are outside the body because they need to be a couple degrees cooler than the body temperature.
---
the biological imperatives of life that define itself - by the order of its own quality or characteristics - absolutely equates to its meaning and purpose. a star burns gas, its objective meaning is to burn gas and die/collapse. just like life, it's objective meaning or purpose is to survive reproduce and subsequently, die, because that's the function that is observed. it really isn't that complex of an idea to grasp in comparison to the thousands of subjective meanings things may possess.
---
Yeah, i kinda assumed with 2k total you could afford it.
---
Amazing! Great job Jagex. Have to give some credit when they do something big like this.
---
well it's not capped at 4/6 charges per amulet, for one thing.
---
Pretty sure it's not as far as you're describing either
---
so with both quests completed you need to have a minimum of 750k in the coffer when the cycle processes to get the most resources back. 75k will be removed each cycle, or 10% of the current balance if you are below 750k and the rewards will be scaled down as well.
---
you will lose a small amount of resources by not filling favor back up every day. cutting maples by the ring of wealth miscelannia tele is the easiest way to regain favor. personally I check every 2-3 days but depending on how much of your bank 1 mil is and what other money makers are available to you you may want to check more or less often.
---
Its like two blocks more and you can store 1K tps for basically nothing.
---
May be the game is only around because they exist and create a market that obviously has demand, allowing people to get something back for the time they put into the game.
---
Okay, I can see your point of view. Maybe I‚Äôm grabbing my torch and pitchfork too quickly. That being said, the artist called his own work a loli. That‚Äôs not even my words, it‚Äôs his.
---
Maybe I should take this more as a studio Ghibli type art, but something about it does NOT strike me as being that sort of art. 
---
I just think that there is something inherently creepy about this picture. Maybe I can‚Äôt see past my own expectations, but there it is. This picture makes me uncomfortable.
---
Yeah you know what I was thinking of heart. But it does have much higher requirements arguably, since honour is locked, and also doesn't provide stats so might not be good depending on what you're doing.
---
I don't think anyone is arguing against democracy. But saying 'you have the right for your viewpoint to influence the game' is dismissive of the point that's being made. Just because you should have the right to democracy does not mean that all ideas are constructive to the community

Rev Caves high is pretty fun. I like to escape from PKers while giggling like a schoolgirl. Or get TB'd and washed. Fun either way

I think we should be polite to each other. No need to offend.

I actually really like underground pass, it's such a crazy adventure. But heck Tai bwo wannai trio or legend's. They have things you can mess up for literally no reason.
---
Not necessarily.
---
There could be more sites getting shut down very soon and Jagex might want to release all the information at once, instead of multiple statements.
---
Something like: "We just shut down 8 gold selling websites, banned 15,000 of their accounts and removed 2 trillion illegitimate GP from the game."
---
At your level you will want to shoot for:

- Varrock hard, so you can make like 60k per day for free from battlestaves
---
- Kandarin hard, for increased exp at the Seers Village agility course and for the Seers Village teleport which is extremely close to a bank
---
- Morytania hard, for the bonecrusher and also for increased profit at Barrows if you decide to do that
---
All of the diaries are pretty useful, though. Ardy hard gives you bonus thieving exp, Lumbridge gives more exp at tears of guthix, Karamja gloves 3 have a teleport that's pretty close to Duradel, etc
---
That's how most people feel when they don't have a high tolerance. Then you smoke daily for a long time and can't get that high if you try, so you're chasing the highs you used to get. 
---
I've been so high I couldn't form coherent sentences or even listen to a whole sentence and comprehend it several times, but it's been years since I've been that high, not through lack of trying ;)
---
My friend group is already dividing itself up for groupman mode. If we're a good metric, I'm sure there are plenty of others.
---
What are you doing? Heroin for ants? 3m/hr ain‚Äôt gunna pay for nothin.
---
Don't worry, I bet the bots and farmers have already moved to another one of the dozens of popular selling sites. This is more of a "morale move" than anything. Stopping gold selling sites is one of the many small things that should be done to de-incentivize illegitimate RWTs.
---
Unfortunately not. I found them on Etsy.
---
If you even thought about anything other than your current task, perma ban
---
If you don't regain that 1% each day, that day will only accumulate 99% of the reward. I check every few days, the drop off isn't that much. You don't have to collect often, the reward pool doesn't decay
---
You‚Äôre lvl 125. Something tells me you have more than 3 hours gametime. Money well spent
---
but really though...
---
were can i buy fruity nmz from tho
---
Gz on 99@@@@@
---
they were two different, seperate websites, but owned by the same person. if you tell arcus "bogla offered me .7 per gp!" they might give you a lower price, even though theyre the same company at the top. thats what made it funny,
---
Well shit my man. We should do some sort of collaboration.
---
Chances are you probably aren‚Äôt a good metric, unfortunately. Most normies can‚Äôt even keep one account bonded much less two, I don‚Äôt see it being any different this way. Group Ironman is watered down Ironman where people with commitment issues will show lol.
---
I‚Äôd love to be wrong, but unfortunately I think I won‚Äôt be. ü§™ hit me with that !remindme 6 months
---
Bonds came into the game to combat gold selling sites. It will always be impossible to get rid of gold sellers and this was their solution to combat it while making money off it

Twisted bow is cool because its a broken ass item, and yes being 1b is a symptom of that, but thats some really weird backwards causation, like ur just trying to twist emphasis on the grind when its not really there...

same, only time I ever got temp-banned was for using an alch clicker.

Whoops.

Yes

I think rule enforcement is a high priority on old school game servers so I'm very happy about what I've seen during this fall.
---
&gt; Too many times have I seen people with 1100 total wearing 100m worth of gear. 
---
\^Plenty of those are alts though. People putting their BIS combat gears on their alts to make some gp on the side while they are skilling on their mains.
---
It's not an idea on this post, but it's better than the retarded shit you came up with. Increasing your risk and reward is something that 07scape used to do. So naturally, if you risk by skulling with a rev wep, the reward would be to have your weapons last longer. If you think I'm smoking shit by saying that, then you're painfully unaware of current mechanics in the revs cave that increase your drop chances at uniques based on being skulled.

I was thinking Ahrims and eternal boots.

his shit is getting weirder and weirder. today we had the lizard men and indian call center voice. tommorow? only b‚Äôholes knows.
---
Yeah because BIS weapons costing fuck all is healthy for the game. Back to wintertodt buddy, keep on fletching and remember slayer good and rc bad =\]
---
True. I'd still prefer 77 att and 1 def though. Maybe this guy is transitioning to zerker sometime soon though, and in that case 77 att still works with 45 def and not gaining an extra cb level. Who knows what's going on here.
---
Yes that's once you hit 93 cooking. As I previously stated, I had a fairly low cooking level so they 100% do make a difference. The reason the cooking gauntlets have no effect at 93 cooking at the Hosidius range, is because you stop burning them entirely at that level and that range.

For ur stats, you should try killin chaos druids in edgeville dungeon. Easy kills and good training/money making. Bring a looting bag so you can pick up the herbs they drop. Avoid the Guam herbs. They‚Äôre cheap af. Be aware it is wildly.
---
Nice.
---
Like with the new rune essences in the morytania expansion, why did they have to specify that it would not increase exp/hr? And given people would complain if it ends up being even ever so slightly more, you know they are going to undershoot the exp rates and make it instantly dead content
---
Yeah i've always used an imbued MSB but blowpipe will help speed up Ahrim times. It's not the biggest efficiency booster but after 100-200 runs, it adds up.
---
Blowpipe is a lot more broken than the twisted bow but it's not really as cool now is it?
---
I suppose. Have you done the Morytania Hard Diary?
---
Dungeoneering is like the one thing this community unanimously wants, and we'll probably never get it.
---
Hurray for 30k ranarr seeds!!
---
Yeah. You can see how much bonds jumped up when Twitch membership ended as proof.
---
Well they have added farming contracts so they might add other skills in the future
---
He insulted first? He called him a selective monkey...
---
Level 125 pure btw
---
With those stats, I would use your woodcutting to quickly cut the logs needed to get 50 Firemaking. Should only take about an hour since you‚Äôre already 50 woodcutting.
---
Then go do Wintertodt for your 14 days. It will easily get you to 80+ firemaking in less than 200 KC, and will grant you enough fish and ores since your levels are quite high to grant you a good amount of money.
---
You‚Äôll prolly also end up with a few hundred thousand gp too.
---
Atleast some BIS gear should require smithing - yeah. Dragonfire shield is an example of how it atleast should be done. Runescape is a game well suited to illustrate a normal economy that requires specialization of labour and different people doing different things. Such a game is nice because the economy becomes vibrant and player-driven and it creates events that aren't scripted.  
---
Unfortunately the original vision of a vibrant and realistic medieval gameworld has been abandoned because it's more convenient for most players if the most popular playstyle (PvM) just gives you everything and is both the main supplier and main consumer of most content. That leads to other skills simply being supportive - not complimentary. When skills are supportive to the "main" gameplay of PvM there also isn't a need to have them be challenging in themselves, which ruins the fun for the players of the "main" PvM content.   
---
The solution requires a few things:   
---
(1) Less skilling requirements for PvM content. If PvM is locked behind quests, it should be preferable to offer alternative (and possibly worse/more expensive/more tedious) ways of doing the quests.   
---
(2) Less skilling rewards from PvM. Specialization requires that one group has a monopoly on at least the main supply of certain resources. Currently PvM can just give everything.   
---
(3) More rewarding skilling content. Skilling content needs to become a consumer of resources created by the PvMers. Currently all resources both in- and out go to support PvM actions. There is very little resources going from PvM to skilling consumers.   
---
(4) Less skilling requirements for PvM gear (requiring smithing to make it is fine, PvMers buy it from smithers. Here i mean things like barrow gloves) and less PvM requirements for skilling gear.  
---
(5) The relevant skill should always be required to create or obtain the relevant item. Crafting or smithing for the respective armours, fletching for bows, etc. 
---
Some unique content should be locked behind quests of course, but it's unfortunate to lock BIS gear behind skilling content as that requires everyone to be generalists, which means skills have to be easy and we can't have economic specialization into the skills we enjoy. If the game was made so that everyone doesn't have to level every skill it would make sense to have skills be hard, but when the game "requires" everyone to get 80+ in every skill, of course that takes too long for most people and it needs to become easier.   
---
It's more fun for me if i can spend the limited time in my own niche than to spend it on being a mediocre generalist. But the game really doesn't allow for that unless you put arbitrary restrictions on yourself.
---
Haha. Man someone defending such a random idea this hard has interests other than game integrity at stake. 
---
Keep trying to get your shitty merches buffed so you can cash in. The completely unfounded insults to anyone who doesn't see it the way you do really tops this whole post off.
---
We need the witch outfit in osrs.
---
so easy to trigger you guys
---
Pretty good, lots of guides and things to do
---
2, 3, 4 and 5 man groups.
---
Kind of a bad example because making the game too convenient will make the game horribly boring.
---
The Feud has fairly low requirements, and then Ali Morrisane sells assortment of runes after you complete sudoku for him.
---
Yeah I knew it'd be a longshot from the start, but better to try than not try at all.. Ah well, lol.
---
So to anyone wondering, always clean your account and put the GP on an alt if you've successfully become unbanned.  A month later the unban might be overturned.
---
Nice
---
Yellow text good
---
Tbh the only things that are cancer in the OG client is the drawing distance and the fact that it doesn't use the GPU to render the graphics.
---
I still use the OG client though. I can live with it for now and someday it will get fixed I'm sure.
---
I am a socket for following a good guide. Do you have any suggestions? I think I'll enjoy the early game + skilling grinds the most since I've not solo'd things like GWD on my main so it would be out of the question on an iron
---
Not that bad actually, 3hrs per lvl. Just aim for a lvl per day until you get to the point where it's 10hrs per lvl. Then do a lvl every 2 days. Eventually in like a month you'll be 99

Penis bad, buy gold good

The only thing wrong with the sentence is a comma and a phone autocorrect.  But here you go "Goodluck, you think if player auctions could get hit they would of already been hit by bigger studios." They have been active for 19 years, good luck jamflex
---
I think you misread his post
---
It was time for him to *pay the Bill*.
---
Yeah exactly. Plus I realized that a lot of the accounts were probably stolen and I didn't want to support such a shitty thing.
---
It's wrong because it's a logical fallacy
---
For starters they only sent out cease and desist letters, not orders. So no judge ruled in their favour. Other company's (blizzard) have gone to court and lost for the exact same thing. Agreeing to exchange one parties gold to another for compensation isn't a violation of Jagex's IP. So if for 20 years this has existed and not one company has successfully won a suit to stop any re sellers of virtual gold, how could Jagex.
---
Runecrafting offers no more exp per hour from a particular training method as your level increases, so no you aren't "improving your account." You're unlocking, as you called them, artificial gates. Many levels effectively do not exist for runecrafting, because they don't change anything about the skill, be it exp or profit.
---
With thieving, once you unlock master farmers, for example, you can thieve from them immediately, but your exp rates and profit will be awful. As you gain levels, you'll succeed more often, leading to more exp per hour and more profit. That kind of positive feedback loop makes high levels feel satisfying and useful. They don't have to gimmick the skill with "super master farmers" once you hit level 60 and "ultra master farmers" at level 80.
---
There's no reason to get 99 runecrafting. Double deaths are, as you call it, an artificial gate that was only put in there because people complained about the lack of use of 99 runecrafting.
---
Could thieving be more interactive? Definitely. But you do have pyramid plunder, which is basically the wintertodt of thieving, save for the 30 levels or so that it isn't the best training method and falls behind blackjacking, stalls, or other pickpockets.
---
Because dragon battle axes boost you higher
---
Buy bonds irl money sell for gpppppp
---
thats true i suppose. either way, i'm not high enough level (nor do i have the cash stack rn) to do guthan's method, but i'll keep it in mind for the future
---
Fastest way there is to do Lava runes
---
Still fast but not as fast as lavas with decent profit would be steam runes
---
For a lazy alternative you could also do ZMI.
---
So they can have a monopoly on the market btw
---
I'm trying to decide on if I want to runecraft the whole flight, or do construction. I have up to 90 construction banked right now

beeeen there af. though i cracked my laptop screen once at mlm, just a break in the polygons.

But RS3 is dead

1320 on task with nothin but a curved and long bone

Also diet. Think he only eats chicken breasts and tuna lol.

Forgot to bring some flatpack chairs to "sit"
---
So like less than 1 hour?
---
I enjoy doing some stuff myself in this game. I treat the ge like the grocery store, only go when im out of shit
---
It was a while back when RS3 was slightly less dead.
---
To make the enhanced nightmarish set, it requires you to break down a set of bandos in the forge. When that gear is melted down, it doesnt matter if the bandos gear was a boot or a helmet as it has now been reforged.
---
&gt; This means they will look like bots with no stats, but they're not, they are legitimate accounts that I will be paying membership for.
---
automation looks much different on a statistical level than an afk alt. unless your alt is using a mouse recorder or actual macro you have nothing to worry about.
---
unless its an f2p ge flipping alt. for  whatever reason those get banned accidentally a lot.
---
Karambwan and dark crab fishing spots are static so these are afk with the exception of banking/pkers.
---
are you maxed combats?
---
Loot from shutting down a gold farming operation? I NEED THE STATISTICS T_T

Bruh I'm happy for you but block your fucking name in these things. I can't count how many times I've told people this and how many more times I've seen people get hacked for drops because they wanted to show off their loot.

Then you werent brewed?

---
There's basically 2 independently managed Runescape games. Both games are still run by Jagex, but the development teams are completely different. You can use your old login credentials to get into either game, though.
---
The updated one you're thinking of is referred to as RS3, and that has the Evolution of Combat and the other changes you're thinking of. All your old progress remains on this account.
---
This subreddit is dedicated to Oldschool Runescape OSRS. The devs basically took a backup of the game as it existed in 2007 and made servers for it. It has since been updated pretty extensively, but they try to maintain the original feeling of the game. When they reinstated the game back to 2007, though, there was no fair way to keep anyone's progress, so all accounts were reset. You can still log in with your old name, but you're back to level 3 just like everyone else was.
---
You could add bubbles at the top by agitation, like a head on a carbonated drink.

I too was making a joke, jesus.
---
Yup
---
yeah i was thinking monkfish but the spots change too often for me tbh
---
Thank you!
---
he wasn't replying to you
---
p2p or f2p? Cooking is probably going to be better money if f2p, since fishing them is so slow. Fishing is really slow for making money though tbh
---
gotcha. maybe later down the road when i can actually do efficient nmz
---
That's why I said 'If'. People were acting as though a JMod doing his job was a bad thing hence my botting example.
---
I wasn't replying to you? o.o
---
right click the high alch button to set alch warnings and untradeable item warnings
---
I take it back. Apologies
---
Honestly, you just have to bite the bullet. Commit to runecrafting for however long it takes. I came out the other end really having enjoyed the grind, it's kind of meditative.
---
f.lux doesn't darken your screen, it shifts your screens white balance  over time. You have the intent correct though, it does this to gradually reduce eye strain throughout the day.
---
Yeah it just seems like a fun thing to do on the side. I basically want to kill people that don‚Äôt fight back, whist also clearing out some bot farms. 
---
I have no intention of wasting too much time on it though
---
I don't care how they do it. I'm just glad to see they are making progress. You gotta l start somewhere. Keep it up!
---
It's more of an example that Jagex bot banning system is not perfect and Jagex needs to finally have a way for people to appeal their bans. If this guy wasnt a streamer, he probably would never have his account back.
---
Mr Mammal is pretty entertaining. If I can bend the rules a bit Skiddler is good on Twitch, although a lot of his stuff lately is the Group Ironman.
---
No, it really doesnt. Definitely not at raids... do you have any raid kc?
---
This is a monumental moment for my cerb lair only uim
---
its not funny, unless youre a lowerclassmen in high school
---
&gt; is this a different game mimicking the original
---
Yeah, pretty much. You can log into both games with your old account, progress will be on RS3 though. Your character on oldschool will be a fresh account on tutorial island.

I always kills all the brothers + 2 skeles and a bloodworm and have never gotten 87,4%. Always 86,2
---
Look up the "super chocobo world" series if you havent already.  He is a maxed ironman who does collection log content and it has really good editing/artwork
---
Doesn't really matter what type of rune you're making. Atleast 3m/hr
---
83 is fine, you may want to get 80 def as well for ferocious gloves if you have DS2 done and can afford them.
---
Well it's impossible to hack someone without a username to start with, sharing a screenshot of a tbow drop with your name all over it is going to get you hacked if someone wants it, simple as that.
---
Oh and Mudkip!!

oh gotcha

Yeah the notion of "do this incredibly tine consuming minigame or fall way behind in pvm ability" didn't appeal to me.

I have been following the GIMP actually. Not a huge fan of EVScape personally, but the series itself is pretty interesting. Might have to check out streamers actually, never really got into twitch, so might try that out.

Always happy to help. If you bring chins to use on Jad, sometimes you can tag some of the healers without needing to move. That‚Äôs how I got my first Jad kill.

Other Gold sites are gonna see more traffic now that the Top 2 are down.

Remember when MMG said Bonds killed RWT?
---
You can say that about probably more than half of every skill. Which non combat skills are genuinely useful for a main? Agility, construction...??
---
Pls lower the bond cost lol shits getting expensive for a noob like me, 6m
---
I gotta ask, was the wonky polevault animation the inspiration for this?
---
Ok whats my email?
---
Turn off left click attack options for other players, and remember to not skull! Always make sure you're not bringing anything with you into the wilderness you aren't willing to lose. As long as you're not skulled you'll keep 3 items (or 4 if you have unlocked the protect item prayer and are using it as you die).
---
Less than 5% ie literally nothing. The money it changes about the same price as shit your too lazy to pick up during slayer. Like I said, they're annoying and kinda stupid.
---
Tbow?
---
Theres the main one, I think its osiris guide! Yeah they are for sure the best. Especially setting your own goals and getting them!
---
Should check out the iron man subreddit, ironscape for better help!

Yeah the OSRS crowd is kinda special lmao, i still check the subreddits sometimes to see how ridicilous it gets. Also quit playing OSRS when I thought about the agility i had to do to max :")
---
The 1:1 thing is a pure myth and never existed. It's just a myth that has been perpetrated by this subreddit for so long that everyone repeats it. If you reverse their clientside AC, you'll know what they look for.
---
 And "1:1" is not one of them
---
Depends on how good the tunner is, experienced lava runners charge up to 8 or 9m an hour.
---
yeah I've always thought PA was the best site for gold. I've used it multiple times and never had a problem on either end. Buying GP and then bonds is often cheaper than actually buying membership. Though it's against the rules...
---
Or just dont do vasa...that's one boss in the raid and its completely irrelevant if even one person has a tbow, which most of the time even on we do raids there is a tbow.
---
If you can afford a tbow, you really shouldn‚Äôt be leeching with addy darts in the 2 rooms where you use it
---
Looting pvp worlds ( no exp gain )
---
Hunter ( only if you're going to be playing 6+ hours a day it'll make your bond money)
---
Smithing, starting cash required,  blast furnace
---
Chaos druids if you wanna train combat, not as good as the other methods but can get you set up for slayer
---
Nah dude got proof too, the ACC he uses when testing the fight cave name is Selca, that's my mates account that was recovered. How else does he get the account other then buying it or being the one who recovered it
---
Interval, repeated actions, movement loops
---
"Leeching with addy darts" it's called not wasting money

still powerless against botting websites

I boss baked as fuck and yeah I die sometimes but I'll be damned if the grind isn't waaaaay easier.
---
Yes, theres videos on youtube where people just beg and make a ton.
---
How long did that take you?
---
No you can only watch them be online /s
---
Eh, they did set RC as a req for almost every elite diary so I‚Äôd say for late game it‚Äôs important. Especially for DKs
---
It's really not that bad.  Fighter torso is something everyone finds daunting and then people who get it go "oh I wish I did that earlier...". I used randoms for the whole thing and it took 2.5 hours total, even switching groups some.
---
Seeing a picture with someone‚Äôs RSN with no link to the account‚Äôs email whatsoever is no different than seeing that account in game.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm definitely going to insure it! Rather spend the money now and not have to depend on the chance that I‚Äôll have good RNG again.
---
Imagine if that would be lynx on his alt

Bruh

Herb runs.

Over 200m xp dry*
---
You may want to try killing cow and sell the cowhide for early cash which will allow you to purchase better gear. You may want to spend some time exploring the game. If you dive straight into efficiency, it may ruin your experience!

I realised the other day why I had so much trouble back in the day since I noticed he looks a lot smaller than I remember.
---
Pretty sure I played fully zoomed in as a kid so I had trouble seeing the tells.
---
So add to ignore? Why complain about it here.
---
I would love it if they just remade it with an older art style. The whole dungeon crawl aspect is what OSRS needs, not just raids. I don't understand why it shouldn't be implemented if it had rewards and was a good way to practice bossing and learning the mechanics of the game. It could be F2P and/or P2P for all I care.
---
Time commitment and difference in power is not on the same scale.
---
Take mystics just
---
Implying it takes effort
---
Then play another game. You're cheating.
---
I don't support either notion. I take pride in my acc being legit
---
Depending on how much he plays in those 14 days he could get 99. 90+ is definitely possible with the xp rates there.
---
I wonder if anyone in the comment section relates to this post?
---
its a sick achievement but in reality it's actually pretty sad
---
Lol why is this a thing. Right click his name and add him to ignore. Theres nothing else he can do to affect your gameplay afterwards
---
I used to get muted almost every week or so back in the day lmao
