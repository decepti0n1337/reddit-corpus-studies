Wilderness is about risk/reward. Typically things in the wildy are more rewarding because you're at risk of being PK'd. The people killing you aren't doing it for your 30k, they're doing it for the exact reason you made this post. You're frustrated. Not because you lost 30k, but because someone else spent (or perhaps as you see it, "wasted") their time trying to ruin your gameplay experience. They didn't win because of your 30k, they won because someone was trying to do something more rewarding in the wildy, and they stopped them, and now you're here bitching about it on the official reddit. Way more rewarding to a griefer than a fair fight with decent loot.

Both are ranged thrown weapons that have the same thrown speed and that are primarily used for PVP, One is significantly better than the other. I compared them to rune knives for that purpose so /u/LothricsLegs knows their main purpose and has something to compare them to and understand what they are.

Maybe you can say they're bad for the game, but I dont think the tryhard side of the community is any better.
---
In fact, I'd say its more common to see someone look down on another player for not having some kind of gear or playing in an inefficient manner. The hyper efficient crowd that tick mines until they break a sweat is usually the crowd I see actually acting rude to others.

best part is it is all f2p... I would like to have a fury on him or some real accuracy/str gear but it isn't worth the bonds. Especially if I start actually killing monks as a result. 
---
I didn’t know that, that’s pretty cool
---
Probably because you can play OSRS for thousands of hours, so it is blocked. But you get on RS3 after 15 minutes so they don’t even bother.

Nah. Videos way easier and faster.
---
It sounds like you didn't watch the clip... The reason it is being mass disliked is because it did so well it hit trending. People saw it on trending and then clicked on it to dislike it because it was RS3. It is not like they were subbed to a guy who randomly uploaded RS3. And just because features can be misused doesn't mean it is the features faults.
---
Oh :( 
---
Yeah i took a little hiatus after eoc but then went back and its pretty fun to do the new bosses and such. However rn im on the osrs grind cause i can only really focus on one game at a time. Also there is an rs3 add on application thats pretty good but i forget what its called (maybe runeapps or something but dont just go and download some random thing cause it could be phishing)
---
have you tried picking up the steel platebodys in the wilderness and alching them
---
I don't see anything wrong with throwing knives tbh. Or with the bronze-rune boots. Limit dragon+ to members, sure, but rune is a f2p metal. It can be mined, it can be worn. Why can't we wear it as boots? It's also devalue the freebie boots from the stronghold of security. Wouldn't that be *good* for the ingame economy?
---
Nah... it just makes the OSRS community look dumb
---
If you're actually really new to bossing like myself, id recommend doing barrows with your mage level, as well as crazy archeologist and chaos fanatic (former mage and latter range). All these are easy after a few kills which means they aren't difficult to begin with.
---
Once you're comfortable with those 'bosses', you could move on to the other wilderness bosses or maybe try things like the boss options of certain slayer tasks.
---
I'm thinking either killing chickens at lumbridge for their feathers is something you might be able to handle or spinning flax in the castle if you can't afford bronze yet to do chickens. 
---
Good luck!

your idea seems “decent” to you because you ignore the hordes of people explaining to you why you’re wrong
---
i really don’t get how you can keep covering your ears and ignoring the fact that increasing the strength of ranged in f2p will OBJECTIVELY have a big impact on combat, pvp and pve
---
you even acknowledge that you don’t enjoy or have any stake in f2p, you just want to meddle with the established format that lots of people already enjoy as-is and don’t want changed
---
all for the sake of your own idea of consistency?

What don’t you like about it? I can’t recall which animation I used as there are a lot of animations we use for running with weapons. Generally it’s not worth the time making a unique one for every single weapon but sometimes it’s required (for instance, the whip has a special one as it needs to bend as you move it about).

no, because the largest amount of people who consistently play f2p are the pkers. Most other people either choose to limit themselves, or only play f2p for a month or two before getting members. The goal is to get people to buy members, it is likely with more content in f2p, people will quit the game entirely before they buy members.

Is there a reason you're doing it before 61 range? Otherwise I'd recommend getting your ranged lvl up. It'd take a long  time to do it with a msb and low range.

How did they get the sword to stay like that 
---
I have the same long term goal, generally start with the things with the lowest cost for bis gear. For example, barrows is only slightly faster in bis gear than trident/bp/hides, so that's a good one to go for early. Corp's a decent one since it's pretty much just spear/void/accessories. Just make sure you're not rushing to do stuff that's much faster with bow/scythe at the beginning of your journey.

Regarding reason 2, I'm pretty sure Mod Kiernan said that they cant change stats for PvM vs PvP during the Q&amp;A but they can change stuff like tick speed as what we saw for the blowpipe

There still be beggars in members worlds. Shit crazy
---
Friend just came to runescape and i was helping him get on his feet. I'm genuinely not mad, i'm mostly amused haha.
---
I guess that could be the trade off. People who don’t want to do them would use slayer points t cancel since the drops are kinda crazy from them. I think I got about a mill from bloodvelds in less then 45 minutes. But at the same time it would be annoying. Yes and no for me
---
Crossbows nowdays are pretty useless outside of pvp (except for the dhcb).
---
The DHCB is a very niche item which is used for raiding (pre tbow) and mainly vorkath/brutal blacks. If you intend on doing either of those then yes get a dhcb but otherwise just use the blowpipe, its better in most situations.

How were you doing on supplies when you got to Jad? If that setup got you to Jad without too much of a problem, then you should be fine. But if you were just about out of brews when you got to Jad, then you could maybe try switching to a verac's skirt instead of dhide for increased tankiness.

Think I had about 3 saras, and a single super restore. Wish I had brought more ranging potions. The 360s were so tanky if I wasn’t flicking eagle eye.

I also don't have access to the email address tied to the account because I don't remember it. I created the account 10+ years ago when I was a kid. My current password has been my password for a very long time. I vaguely remember the password that I created the account with but my recovery requests keeps getting immediately denied, so I guess I am entering that password in wrong. 
---
I really want to get my account back and I'm not sure what to do at this point. I have tried to answer the questions to the best of my ability and have also provided payment information for subscriptions purchased ~2 years ago.

[Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ahhof6/konar_slayer_spreadsheet/?st=JREDSAHK&amp;sh=9c96a2bc) a spreadsheet for Konar’s list of tasks and weightings. If you want to max out Hydra, block the 5 highest weighted tasks otherwise, and skip as many other bad tasks as you can sustainably
---
85att/def, 88str, 86 range. Using slayer helm (i), blesses d’hide top, verac skirt, fury, assembler, dragon boots, blessing, blowpipe, arclight and d defender. 
---
There’s a certain amount of damage that is unavoidable to a certain extent when you fight them, but as long as your prayer is correct you can last for a while. Also if you’re using runelite it tells you what to pray against and when to switch. 
---
Some voiders run them but they are so expensive

:)
---
Thank you very much!
---
Ayeeeee. Phish gang. Except my dumb ass is a 14 year vet that got phished because I wasn’t familiar with twitch at the time. RIPRIP NIGGA REBUILD. 
---
I say that with complete love, because I appreciate the struggle.
---
So true... Wish I could find my old friends from The Dark Legends and Dark Slayers 
---
Hellhounds - no loot except Hard clue scrolls
---
Black Demons - waste of time except Demonic Gorillas
---
Greater Demons - high weight, bad loot
---
Kalphites - high weight, bad loot
---
Konar might be a better option if you're after profit, the extra drops average out to around 1k gold per kill on top of normal loot, slightly more for higher level monsters.
---
Multicombat zone 
---
Thats awesome dude 
---
Considering I got the two shards within 4 kills of each other, I’m gonna disagreeing- coming from someone who can do zulrah. 
---
Bruh I'm Canadian, anywhere that regularly goes above 30° is all the same 😂

Cant tell if shitty joke or serious

I mean yeah what do you expect when you’re literally being a nazi?
---
After reading your comment   i now understand the meaning of life. 
---
Trust me, I know exactly how you feel about questing.
---
Just watch a video guide along side with the quest and it's literally brain dead and you'll be so glad you did it after.
---
If you just use a wiki guide or no guide at all I think questing sucks.  But video guides are so easy. 
---
i’d honestly rather do UG pass twice than monkey madness once 
---
Archaic meanings are illegal
---
It's all luck. His rng is just bad. Some people flick between controlled / accurate / defensive to see which hits better. In the end it's just rng and you need to leave the arena. Gambling addiction is no joke.
---
Then fuck him. Iron men are some of the most entitled players in the game.
---
Brutals are great for afk, but they don't beat vork over gp/hr

Did ya go through the recovery process and re-enable auth?

Bis range boots... If you don't have an iron I guess you wouldn't understand.

I would think that you most likely can rotate the room 90 degrees to fix that.

This is the dumbest post I've ever read.

make it into a zerker 42 or 45 def still fun pking
---
Do barrows and slayer, but in between do proper herb runs. They add up and you make great profit for just doing a run every 90 mins. Spend some money on seeds and look into ultra compost.
---
Nah that was a pretty good example, rwt a couple bil vs taking 1b from a company, advertising a gambling website, and pushing jagex to make new rules.
---
Also not that this is relevant, but one of them apologized and admitted their mistake and the other one just said "I learned my lesson. ^^^^thanks ^^^^for ^^^^the ^^^^100k "

Yeah just google search how to get osbuddy or even maybe runelite on chromebook. Definitely can do osbuddy but not sure if there is a guide or way to do runelite. Price of the laptop doesn't really matter but I will say I got an $80 chromebook that runs osbuddy perfectly fine for the price of course.

Best pure clan to exist on Runescape

They could just add it to the archery store. Plus members make yew short and longbows and sell them on the grand exchange anyway.

Why didn't you just do the rest of the task at regular black demons instead of skipping?

True, you're still a cunt if you crash intentionally though, even if all worlds are packed.

YOINK! My hat now!

good pet hunt

since unlocking zeah rc i now dislike agility more than rc

You don't just talk to the devs, you shitpost everywhere involving rs3 content which is what this thread is about. Being bitter over your game changing in a way you didn't like isn't a valid reason to act that way. 
---
God dammit Tanner from high school always showing off things I dont have, we get it you have the hottest girlfriend,  get a runescape cake, drive a mustang GT, and make 200k a year. Fuck you Tanner.
---
You get phat xp drops from repairing the brazier, and when you're playing solo, you get waaaay more opportunities to do so. I only went to 99 fm but I did a fair amount of solo games and got like 65 construction from it. Getting one skill to 99 and 3 others into the 60's is a pretty good way to start off an account tbh.

After trying recovery appeal the  problem somehow just solved it self , I logged in to account settings and I get this message : " In order to continue playing you must register an email address with us. This can be used to recover your account.
---
This will not change your login information."
---
This WASN'T there before I posted this, before I posted this , it went to account settings saying my email is registered to the login email  which i have no access to so ye I had a good reason to panic..... oh well cool story jagex.

Im considering giving him my old toshiba satellite for it. Only issue is it doesnt have the D button.  You can still click it, it just makes D's hard. 
---
See what I did there?  
---
But yeah he got ripped off.  Ive sent him multiple good laptops in the last few months but he said he never had the money. Including descent ones for only 75. Now he has 150 (that could get a laptop that would run Wow around here)
---
And he buys a fucking chromebook. 
---
Rip

Sometimes rng is bad, i either tend to hit 20s or 0s with no inbetween

What a fucked mentality. Never done that never will I have too much respect for others

One day after you say this a bunch of jmods on the recent stream voiced how they wanted to nerf blowpipe.

im actually allergic so no cat quests on this account sadly

&gt;I wasnt happy

hmm

Reported for animal abuse :\[

because it wasn't like this before and no reason for it to be changed and i already said i needed an easy email login.
---
I do find it bizarre there are still people defending the guy, Enjoy your narcissist youtuber that doesn't even care enough about his loyal fans to even apologize to them for the shit he's pulled.
---
how long did you wait for this
---
It may be fast, but it's the opposite of afk. He probably had fewer total clicks getting to 99 mining than you would getting 80 hunter. 
---
The ring of wealth removes the gem drop table but does not increase drop rate right?
---
Unless its in the wild? Got in an argument eith a clan member and im pretty sure im right
---
yeah its a game, and if you're a lvl 126 pet hunting at kbd and you cant be fucked to hop so you crash 3 lvl 80s that are trying to have fun you're killing their experience.
---
"fun for me but not for thee" I guess is your motto.
---
Sucks to suck
---
Literal savages lmao
---
Idc bout points but they should let partners do boss tasks together. Its be sick to duo hydra and vorkath
---
Use Zulrah guide, you can't play reactionary and chase him around you gotta know what he does and be ready to switch to what he'll be doing as you're fighting. It will take a while to get a gist of but basically yes. 
---
I mean even if you are professional about how you take hits, those guys are bloodied up and bruised for sure. I know a few professional "performance" wrestlers and even when they do everything right then can still get fucked up a good bit.

This is hilarious, but do people actually teleport with it? plz get some footage of that 
---
Yeah, it's not too much of a hassle since the bank is so close.
---
That’s all they can say, they don’t get a choice if the new owner wants to.
---
Civ 6
---
Do you think that the people you see in game aren't real or something? You realise Runescape is an MMO, yes? 
---
I would personally recommend against the honor phone. It's hardware is great for the price, but the one I bought (7X) just had so many problems. It would restart randomly about 5 times a day.
---
The Moto g6 is a solid budget phone but I'm not sure if it does well with osrs (got it for family).
---
You could try to pick up an older One Plus 3t if ya want. My one plus phones have been great.
---
That's what I was thinking :D
---
Why don’t you just play the game instead of watching people play it smh 
---
The prayer bonus from what? Verac bottoms?
---
&gt;Perfect example: My main doesnt really get crashed anymore, my new acc that im leveling to becom a rune dragon alt tho, it got crashed at amolonite crabs, I wasnt happy, but the higher level showed up, I asked him to hop he said no so I just spent 8 mins finding a new world then went back to afking for 4 hours
---
Stealing someones spot because you can't be arsed to find your own is a dick move. Why should they spend 8 minutes hopping just b3cause you have higher stats? 
---
Normal ironmen are the worst. Ult btw. 
---
I think it's also cool considering the idea of making normally untouched content (the alcohols in Gnome Restaurant) somewhat useful.
---
If you're talking about the safespots by the pillars, then youre probably talking about the parts where you're stuck at an edge. There are usually two tiles that are diagonal from each other that you can run between after zulrah has started charging the next attack
---
Lol that's not healthy, that's literally promoting a culture of toxicity within the game. 
---
None of these boosts are higher than existing ones, except for the Incense concept which pushes your combat skills another +1-2. Which is pretty small.
---
Its not an ezscape suggestion
---
I dont really see how making the blowpipe more expensive to use would change  anything. Cost per hour is insignificant for end game pvm like raids even if you increased the cost 5x.
---
Re str/ accuracy nerfs? I really just dont get what the point is. Youd just make existing content like acb inferno, pre tbow solo raids harder, youd make content where pipe is close (but more expensive to use than bow) to bow like tob maiden, hydra etc far more bow favored despite bow costing near nothing phr to use.
---
You don't get to play the lottery, you're an Ironman. 
---
It's against the rules to intentionally grief other players with or without ironman status.  If you go out of your way in PvP to ruin one specific person's time hunt them down and rag them over and over, yeah that's included too.  It can be hard to tell what's actually malicious and what isn't from Jagex's perspective I imagine though.
---
Solid content
---
Because it gets to a point where people simply are tired of the game and don't want to play anymore? Sparc has a bank worth like 80b, at a shitty rate to sell bulk of 0.6~ish that's $50k. If he tired of the game, 50k doesn't do that bad, plus he can just stream another game (he won't lose his full fan base) 
---
theyre all shit
---
But im the one who spent 8 mins looking?
---
Just skip anything you can't cannon/barrage and do the 2 minute tasks (addy/mith/rune/black drags, wyverns without extension, dark beasts)
---
I've gotten about 5 tasks and I'm up points. With elite diary you can skip 2/5 tasks
---
"your smell..." 
---
Yes. 
---
THANK YOU 
---
I'll hit that, sexually

---
Its called competition, not toxicity, and yes it is healthy.
---
&gt; W308 Anvil, people selling/buying bulk rune 2h for 38k each for alchers
---
&gt; What, why?
---
The best alchable you can buy on the GE with a limit &gt; 1000 are battlestaves or onyx bolts (e), where you make maybe 0-50 gp per alch. Rune 2hs alch for 38400 so you make 143 gp per alch at current nature rune prices, almost 3 times as much. It's also benificial for the people making the rune 2hs because they sell them for more than GE value.
---
&gt; Maybe list some good ironman chats, Ironmancc is one I know of
---
"Being an ironman" isn't a specific useful in-game purpose, those are social clan chats. I'm interested not in social clan chats, just in ones where people collaborate for a specific in-game activity.
---
I wouldn’t stop fletching.

Not *you*, as in, any person doing this would be a dick. The 'perfect example' you describe is pretty standard arsehole behaviour.

Hm, never heard of doing it like that. If it works that good though I see no reason not to.

Of course DM me

Honestly that’s too much. I don’t buy my membership anymore because of the high price. I use to have members on 3 accounts when it was $5 but $11 for a single account is enough for me.

Flashbacks from the pride event
---
You must be young or naive to think an old friend won't scam you for pixels not even worth much IRL? Ok, you and I must have completely different kinds of friends. I trust my friends with far more value than a runescape account without thinking twice. It sounds to me likely you're hanging out with addicts or something like that if your trust in your friends is so low. Also, a partner is very different to a friend. 
---
Np :)

I agree that in most cases the leader and friends get the most benefit, but that is in no way, a pyramid scheme lmfaoooo. 
---
Your disappointment lmfao

?

I really appreciate this, should i be using ranged or melee for this? Also to grind for the starting points should i do rumble or normal or hard? 
---
Go into f2p and tell me how many real players you see 
---
If you want the actual and more logical reason for the difference in severity, A Friend was and still is one of the largest OSRS content creators on YouTube, with close to 400k subs, by comparison, B0aty, who is pretty popular, only has 320k subs. KempQ only has 75k subs, so a fraction of the following a friend has.
---
A friend not only accepted RSGP for advertisement, but he also received close to 50k cash irl based on his comments at the time. He used his position in the community to promote irl gambling (bitcoins) and rsgp gambling, promoting this shady site to roughly 400k subs, some of which are underage, similar to the whole CS Lotto stuff that used to occur with Syndicate. He forced JaGeX’s hand, and they made an example out of him to prevent future content creators with a large following from abusing their standing for massive personal gain at the detriment of the viewer.
---
KempQ, on the other hand, performed an act that wasn’t nearly as detrimental to the community as A Friend. The scale of the offences between the two is quite large. 
---
I have no stake in the matter since I don’t watch either of their content really, but yea, I hope that I’ve clarified the difference.
---
Any particular reason why a obsidian cape would be laying on the ground of the helmet shop in Relleka?

Ok mb I mistook you for trying to defend Dovydas but I get your point now.
---
I think Last Stand would be better.

This is pretty clearly out of date though, as evidenced by the fact that the punishment for buying has always been less than that of selling. So it seems more a case of them running on out of date TOS.
---
ah okay time to go look up what that is lol
---

---
DWH successful hit reduces opponents defense by 30% of its current value. BGS reduces the defense by whatever it hits - so it hits a 60, the defense will be reduced by 60. 
---
If your average hit with the BGS outweighs the reduction from a DWH hit, then BGS will be better. This obviously gets a bit complicated though because you'd have to calculate the accuracy so would need the defense stat for the enemy, and your offensive bonuses and so on. 
---
I believe someone did the math for Vorkath and while it's a borderline situation, the BGS is slightly better. 
---
More scale cost/lower accuracy could do fine.
---
The problem of 2 tick attacks is that external str bonus points from gear are more weighted than on 5 tick weapons.
---
The best nerf is to change ava's assembler/anguish bonus with a bp to be only +3 total

Futire range str items should scale on wep speed, or else they will unbalance things further in bias to fast weps, similar case for meele with fero+avernic tbh
---
PANIC BUY WHITEBERRIES

I just want balance, as all things should be.

you're a loser.
---
That doesn't work as an excuse. True, f2ps can't fletch, but it's not like they're locked out of every bow. If they can cut the tree, they should be able to use the tree's wood as a bow. I'm not saying fletching should be f2p, just that yew bows be.

Ah okay, yeah it'll still be possible as a zerk just a lot harder. I fought between making a main or zerk when I came back to RS as I didn't want to make 2 accounts but knew I'd struggle with money as a zerk. I ended up going for a med level 75 atk and def acc which I'm loving.
---
Check out ParkingmeterRs, he's a high level zerk main account so would give you some ideas for the long term.
---
He takes too much notice of them and gives them attention which just keeps them around. 
---
Just stay silent, that usually pisses them off even more than your words could, and watching them rage into the void is always hilarious.

Love the idea! The designs... as /u/FishGoesGlubGlub said, I think HC could be better, but otherwise great. Support. Should actually be a fairly easy change to make - I think, anyway.

How often are updates already stuff the community wants? Also what updates have passed that you think low levels skewed?

Alternatively just use slayer points.

1. It'll be another and he'll throw in some weird phases, like range phases with magic thrown in. After his first rotation shit gets weird.
---
2. I rarely went through one whole Recoil but did occasionally. 2 should be safe.
---
3. He starts spinning his tail. Move away. He hits in a line away from him so don't move straight towards him. You can move directly away from him for the first hit, then move north or south.
---
4. I don't remember what the attacks look like tbh. The way it works is as soon as the projectile is out of his mouth, the damage is calculated so it doesn't matter what you pray after that. Because of that, you pray for the next attack as soon as you see the other one. So as soon as you see his magic attack, you switch to range prayer.
---
That only works for the first task of the day.

Sure, for the first task of the day.

Of course you wouldn't think its a problem, you're one of the toxic people yourself after all.

Maybe off topic a bit but does anyone else think the max cape looks kinda lame? For getting 99 in everything you would think the cape would look hard af but it just doesn't look appealing

As an ironman, that guys an idiot. You won’t get banned for that unless you follow the dude around doing it on purpose and even then it’s pretty unlikely. Don’t let him make you hate all of us
---
Then imagine watching tv
---
Cringe
---
Only one chest per run with restores at clan wars after each run. I flick 3-4 of the 6 brothers without using a single prayer potion. I only ever need a single sip if dharok or ahrim is in the tunnels.
---
If I didn't flick I'd be spending like 10k a chest on pots.
---
Just what I was about to write 😅
---
Now you will be beating 2 snakes each trip
---
🤣 probably not wrong
---
Probably you have stashed up on blowpipes, nice try. 
---
Youre training wrong way. You can get 75 def in around 220-240 hours
---
Bout 20 quests away tbh

SO FUNII LEL

How many pets?

'Prat' is such a gimped word to even have in your vocabulary (is it even a real word?). I'd love to write something creative for you in retort but I won't bother. I'm sure you'd just copy whatever I wrote and past it in the reply field.

bh and pvp worlds are dead as it is

Yes you can boost for multiple roots. It's tricky if you want to use a stew though because if you wait too long before digging up the tree it will regrow, and since magic trees take so long to cut down you're likely to lose your +5 boost. If you use a garden pie it's easy though, just eat it before digging up the stump.

I dont have a problem of just playing runescape for a week to grind it out. I think the first bond will always be the hardest to get but once i actually have it ill have a ton of stuff to do. Plus i dont really have the conditions to spend money on members each month now. The time to ask my mom for members is long gone unfortunatly xD but thanks anyway my dude

For fucks sake.

That’s what I said!

Sorry to break the jerk here but I know this guy irl. He's fuckin insane on 2007scape but he's also got like twenty level 100+ on WoW and had a bunch of Tier 3 level 60s on Nostalrius. He's a fuckin sick gamer, he can stay up for no exaggeration 72 hours straight playing. He is also fortunate enough that his uncle is Frank Fritz from the show American Pickers. So he's always playing around with some old toy or retro gaming console or vintage cars. Lucky dude.

FWIW: Disliking the video doesn't tell the algorithm not to recommend similar videos to you in future. That can only be done with the three dots to the side of the video.

I’m guessing you are talking about PhunkGames. Just found her Twitter, PhunkgTV, and nothing was posted on her twitter between March and December, until a tweet about a change in her life direction just before Christmas. Would confirm why her twitch channel hasn’t uploaded in months also.

Yes

No problem

Yes, I supposed it's the kronos plant doing it. I thought it sped up growing, but looks like it skips a growth stage instead.

Okay, at least there is an explanation.

I just had something really random happen to me, where i was killing level 90 Dagannoth, when i suddenly get a 154 Dragon Arrow tip drop.

From what i looked up, that shouldn't happen, do you have an explanation?

It's just part of the Runescape experience. This is the best Jagex can do when they are not hiring hackers themselves.

It's definitely possible with 51 range and lower but unless you're experienced with fire capes don't bother.
---
85 is lowest i'd go on a pking account unless it's made for killing lvl 3 chin hunters, 94 mage is normal since barrage/veng
---
This is humor?

How do you plan to get 70 herb? It's pretty aids on ironman isn't it? And you don't really have the stats/gear to grind spectres

It's funi becyz no1 care about silvr hoarse ppl

Thank you for your knowledge.

iirc sexually harassed a girl, got confronted by his mates about it, lied to his stream saying it's all made up albeit screenshots and recordings of him saying real seedy shit

My point was never to argue whether or not disliking RS3 is right. I simply wanted to explain why the community has such a stance on RS3, and its effects on the game thus far. I personally want to see both games succeed, but through improvements to the games rather than blindly liking the current state.
---
funny how you reply to this but not when u r pwned

I use the house method and while it is a little annoying when someone gets there in the 30 seconds you were teleporting it's fair game and I just hop lol.

Why are you flicking the magers exactly? You should be praying in a priority fashion i.e. always mage pray on when magers are up because they hit hardest hence why they are the highest level monster before jad

About to get 86 rc for Karamja Diary, any tips on staying sane while doing Lavas the whole way?
---
what the fuck even is this bot
---
Wtf. Whyyy
---
Range them.
---
Yeah, Galvek probably won't be as hard for you. For the most part you're just walking back and forth 2 squares expect for the wave phase. And for phases 2-4 you can set protect range/eagle eye on your quick prayers so it's one tap to turn them back on. 
---
DS2 was the first proper PVM I tried on my account and still managed Galvek in under 10 tries.
---
I'm (assuming) they won't nerf it to absolute oblivion. It will likely still be useful as a level/tier 75 ranged weapon.
---
(In b4 Jagex makes me eat my own words) 
---
farming and flesh crawlers are really op
---
Mines probably even more worthless unless I get 75 def and go DFS spec level 3s at 1500 total worlds catching black chins. :D
---
Beat me to it
---
If you stream the game and I donate a dollar to you, I have your email address. Combine that with doxxing to find out more informaiton then I can just recover your account.
---
Jagex does what to stop that exactly?
---
Either way, I feel like Jad should be doing a mage atk. 
---
So wholesome. :) 
---
Yeah it being a 2h weapon should limit the amount it gets nerfed too, hopefully
---
Q
---
This idea is fan-fucking-tastic. Thank you. 
---
jagex has nothing to do with ppl streaming, also gz on getting mail adress. you won't dox just anyone succesfully it pretty much depends on owner's precautions like not posting your info on internet which is pretty basic stuff 
---
that's why it's totally not jagexs fault
---
Why is the fire cape easier? Because of the ability to use the slayer mask?
---
Not even for racial reasons. Like other games ban certain outfit combos from being made to prevent people from raiding with memes.
---
Not that I normally agree with that sentiment, I just like the idea that we are so against rot we ban their character model.

I love the game but you can buy bonds for gold so it’s kinda pay to win.... although it would cost a lot to officially pay to win (vs rmt sites)  it is technically in the game. Doesn’t bother me much but just sayin

You are all saying animal abuse but my cat actually loves water. He often sits in the sink and when i turn on the tap he gives no fucks and just sits there getting soaking wet while occasionally licking the waterstream.

Overrated comment

Selling rate isnt 80 cents per mill
---
Oh dear, looks like i triggered all the ironmemes.
---
Dude they missed out on a significant amount of passive gems which are invaluable to Ironmen by not having a glory. When they eventually run out they will need to go to the shilo village mines and slave away. That’s it. Never once said they did MLM specifically for gems, but why wouldn’t you want to get more?

150kc and what we got so far was the 4mil helm. I wish I had the rng like u lol

How do I delete someone else’s post?
---
It’s +14 range levels. You’d be silly not to bring it to be honest.
---
I’d say just use it in the very beginning when ur not taking damage so you can speed thru the first easy waves.
---
Then if you’re really taking that much damage for some reason to be counteracting it all the time, just at least use to for the waves that have magers. Those guys are just giant health bars that take forever to kill otherwise.
---
That was an update that came later
---
Who?
---
Spidines
---
Honestly they should just make bankers interact with looting bags directly, like notes, and have it extract whatever yourl have space for or drop the excess.
---
Thank you, I think I am just going to quit playing. I can’t play a game or do anything where 40 days of hard work can be taken From me in an instant, and nothing happen about it.
---
I'm gonna chime in and say I've been using it for a couple days and haven't noticed anything funky. Great job on the model

I'll take curses instead

Trying to PK in the wilderness blasting immigrant song by Led Zeppelin wondering what the fuck I was doing wrong haha

in a way. apparently some people pay 4m/hr to run essence for them
---
Thanks Mr Sleep. 
---
Kodai, tormented, occult and ancestral is everything you need. The rest of the gear should give good prayer bonuses. 
---
If i remember correctly, iban’s has a max hit of 25, 27/28 with occult necklace(not sure if it rounds down or up)  
---
Trident scales with magic lvl, so you’ll definitely out dmg iban’s staff eventually. 
---
Ohhh i get it! Thank you man, i appreciate you explaining it!
---
i think you can get duplicates if you drop trick and talk to the girl who gave you the items in ardougne again.
---
its because the bankers have to let you interact with them 2 squares away instead of 1 so that you can use them across the bank booth. this happens on so many banks where there's a wall only 1 square away from the banker
---
Its always worth getting it
---
I'm pretty sure you go and talk to the science guy and get another and try again. Worst case scenario, you have to go all the way to varrock and find out he like drank it. Then go back. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE MONK ROBES BEFORE YOU GO TALK TO THEM IN THAT PLACE!! The guide isn't very clear about that part and it messed me up. 
---
I think it's preist robes not monk robes. It's been a while.
---
umm no
---
alright ill try that
---
so your saying arma is over 120m per hour? Perhaps I should start fighting it.
---
So it would seem.
---
That was my point.
---
Those arms gonna be swol
---
Why on some slayer tasks do I get a message in the chat box every 10 kills but then others I get nothing? 
---
this was probably around 2006. as the years went by you got less and less back from the runners
---
they should make it so you can combine skillcapes to it for different skillcape color combinations. since the default one is supposed to be sorta the "skilling" one it makes sense.
---
I do like 80-90 kills on task then switch to regular black demons. 360 kc now no Zenyte   
---
gz 
---
Slayer for me.
---
I thought after all these years that we aged and matured. Guess not.

I doubt his rwted cash will last long

Yeah well, whatever content you specifically enjoy is a waste of dev time /s
---
Do you have the crystal saw??
---
But that means going past 70
---
Lmao
---
He's using an alt
---
Kind of jealous, really want the Karamja Gloves to start Efficient Slayer.
---
god I wish we could go back to the days where getting berated online was normal and nobody really gave a shit
---
Jesus christ lmao, can you victimize and blow this situation out of proportion any further? They get crashed in a fucking video game and have to hop worlds, they're not getting put in death camps. 
---
Degenerates like you...
---
I think killing them for their loot is fine it’s just if you 1 item them or if they’ve got nothing and you keep killing them it’s a problem 
---
Every game has one aspect you don't like. You still do it, cause it's worth all the stuff that comes from it that is worth it. The whole point of this game is you can equate the minimal hours, and put in the value of effort it is worth to you. Afk, full manual, money maker, 3 tick, whatever. 
---
Botting should still not be one of those because it requires no effort, and effectively cuts off the reward process. You're still bored. If not now you will be. Though I'm sure there are people out there who only like collecting things and coming back and just managing materials. But that is a completely different game at that point, you got different game play elements like potentially getting caught but getting away with it.
---
we do raids is discord channel for Cox 
---
This was such a great money maker for me back then. I remember that I wouldn’t trade anyone who only offered law runes and only trade those who offered both types
---
Does anyone really give a shit if he rwt? Like he didn't cheat, sexually harass anyone, advertise shady sites, tell someone to kill themself,etc.
---
Runelite plug-in 
---
This is going to be very nice once I start slayer, all ready to go :D
---
No, you can't boost your combat level
---
[Combat bracelet.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Combat_bracelet)
---
&gt; The bracelet also informs you on your current Slayer task count every 10 kills (i.e. "You still need to kill x0 monsters to complete your current Slayer assignment"). This feature only works if the bracelet is charged.
---
I cried when I saw this today :(
---
No, it’s like waiting online for something in real life. You wouldn’t cut someone because you would be called a cunt but would save time. But you’re also not cutting them because you recognize them as another person. 
---
Ehm, I'm pretty sure this wasn't Dovydas first time breaking the rules and getting punished for it. According to their rules the first ban you receive should only affect the account in question (as long as the accounts are not affecting each other).
---
The second ban you receive bans all your accounts.
---
Frist of all how dare yo u
---
I give them a bucket of milk

Or: "my world. Hop." After you've been killing Thermy for an hour straight. 
---
Hey, i'm not saying it's good to do. I'm just saying the people here supporting griefing splashers probably have very inconsistent viewpoints when it comes to other types of griefing.
---
I'm of the opinion that splashing, or tick manipulating woodcutting should be allowed without the need of judgement of other players.
---
Non-player character yes.
---
That doesn't mean non-player sameasyou character.
---
Any monster, boss, store clerk, cow, chicken, etc is still a character. 
---
Ahhhhh that makes so much sense! I've been using uncharged ones or doing ranged on my last few tasks. Thanks 
---
idk you don't seem very happy either. does the massive ROT cock in your mouth hurt?
---
Did you want a specific party hat or all different colors?
---
Oh you dont have to, there's a lot of asshole mains out there too. You just shouldnt be a dick because you're an ironman.
---
delet dis
---
Oh man I remember running laws for the old nite as well
---
It wasn’t they were doing it for rc xp, us plebs were the minions bringing them the pure essence
---
Thanks for the info
---
Y a cat
---
I’d actually be ok with this. Not enough potato themed thigs
---
Lamps. 
---
lol
---
&gt; Where's the challenge? This is trial and error levels of bullshit. There is nothing fair about this. I was just robbed of an hour and a half of my life cause some jackass thought this was acceptable in a game.
---
​Nah. If you read a guide and did it correctly you would know exactly where and when he will spawn and get your prayers on correctly.
---
I have untrimmed Farm too! Congrats man!
---
The people in your cc must either have thought you were trolling or wanted to strangle you lmao
---
lol pray at nmz 
---
Lol turn on sound
---
I dont have every ironman, dont worry. For all i know he could be nicest mf on the planet, but just having a bad day.
---
I'd unironically vote for this (maybe if it only converted 2-3 food items into potatoes).
---
Would give more spec weapon variety in pvp, that's for sure :P
---
You would run unnoted pure essence to the law altar and a runecrafter would trade you the laws and noted essences. For them it was a way to get really good RC exp
---
Sometimes I text like my little sister mocking her, I guess I've blended reality at this point 🤷‍♂️?
---
Why? 
---
Lamps, or you could do raids for the relics there.
---
Dat fish
---
I thought it was rape or sexual assault at a minimum
---
Lol what. I'm not in any pvp clan or even defending RoT, I know they have done bad stuff. I'm just saying flaming people online is just toxic and doesn't lead to anything good. If you look through the other guy's post history, you can see it is all he does on reddit. I'm just looking for more positivity or constructive conversation on this board
---
Google it idiot 
---
Ya, Mobile automatically remembers you so you never have to type anything in so it’s not that. Who knows maybe it’s just being weird 
---
Comedy gold. You should write more often.

Which client are you using? Btw gratz!!!

Used to run air runes for 2k + ess and the guy once accidentally traded me 20k. Thought i was on top of the world
---
I knew a dude in old school that was 99def 10hp pure. Idk how he did it that is so much time spent
---
Fuck this guy sounds gay. That's probably where the dislikes come from.
---
but you're stunned!
---
Shouldnt nerf black d hide, nerf how mage lvl gives you mage def. Not remove, but nerf.
---
Give me your bank before you quit 
---
Oh so you went back to bank to unnote the pure essence and then return back so he could craft more law runes?
---
Noted
---
It's chill after 77
---
dummy to lvl 8 vampire slayer to 22 death plateau to 25 close to 26 tick eat tree gnome village to 33 fight arena to 38 then just lamp the 120k from museum fossil floor would put u at 54 but then its pre much a halt other than a few other quests that give a lamp u can use possibly 40-50k more xp then its just raids for relics or 500 xp lamps from speciman cleans
---
Both work fine. Kxb is ridiculously more expensive though. 
---
Goklok
---
If you give the vial(s) to the wrong person, I believe you have to go to Varrock and continue the quest anyway, and then go back to the girl in Ardougne and get another set of items.
---
It's a good idea to also drop-tick and get more than one set of items from her just in-case of minor mistakes like that.
---
I sat on a banana and it changed my life forever

But then he could go to sand crabs
---
You're missing the joke.....
---
It's silly how often the argument goes "rs has x" for a reason to have something not. Things like new skills should be added to add extra longetivity, even skills from rs3 like summoning were amazing. I honestly think summoning was the best skill for the game, it was useful, a money drain, a random item drain and on top of that it gave another angle to look at training spots: instead of "what gives good xp?", "what gives good gp?" There was the question "what gives good charms?".
---
But alas "runescape 3 has it, so it is bad".
---
On top of that the whole voting system always makes sure a big change like a skill -with actually complicated implications at all fields in the game- can't be added. There will always be people "against" it.
---
Voting shouldn't vote about details at the same time of generic things, we should vote "get skill XYZ?". Then the basics get implemented and then vote on *changes* to those basics.
---
Hey, you're wrong. Want proof? Go to the menu on a low lvl account. Click NPC attack options and set them to hidden. It hides them for high level monsters, now.
---
It'd be a nice feature and I have nothing against it.
---
For easier log-in currently, I use KeePassXC and just have it auto-type my user/pass into OSRS. Has the added bonus of my password being completely randomized.
---
Xp would've run smoother. That's what I'm saying: it made always sense to downgrade to xp just to improve your laptops health and make sure it could run more &amp; was damaged less during normal use.
---
I will try to get that computer running again. 
---
you dont need stretched mode on fixed
---
Yes, exactly. They weren’t making profit nor were they losing money, just do. Nowadays, you have to pay your runners 3-5m hr depending on how competitive it is.
---
Can’t relate wasn’t membs, but definitely spent hours doing this with air runes
---
It's CIV
---
He needs a cigar
---
if you get a high enough attack level to reach a high combat ,pest control repair baricades
---
Oh gee, okay, let's just ignore the toxic clans and then the problems won't exist anymore.
---
No
---
Competing with people in a videogame isn't "treating them like dogs". Just because people aren't behaving exactly like you want them to doesn't mean they are doing anything wrong.
---
Running Nats for Larryr was the bomb! 
---
They should tbh... It costs like 5k lol
---
Na, how about we have max capes that depend on what year you maxed. That would be much better as the different capes would actually relate to how difficult it was to max 2013 max regular &gt; hcim or im. 2016 im &gt; 2019 im etc. Year is much more telling.
---
It’s because of retards like you that assume failure that the rates are so high. Yes, marriage isn’t easy, but given 2 people that actually want to be married and are willing to continue to make the choice to be together even when things are tough- that’s love. Going online and making brainless comments telling people that marriage is rolling the dice is precisely the attitude that causes such a high divorce rate. You should change your tune or you will continue to live a sad, lonely little life.

I usually use the wiki as my questing guide. Is this slayer person better you would say?

Yup big problem for me with OSRS, I run through so many shows &amp; movies. That I have rewatched pretty much everything I've ever seen. Currently busy with my sixth rewatch of SG-1. Will do Atlantis &amp; Universe again after that.
---
evidence plz
---
My feelings are just fine, thanks.
---
Its time to stop posting boyo.
---
If people still want some nostalgia, you can run Wyverns for much more profit in members worlds. They give you half price prayer pots and overpay for ranging pots so they can stay at wyverns longer, and it still gives me that nostalgic feel of running air runes as a kid lol
---
It's not immoral but it absolutely ruins the game/games. Microtransactions that give an in-game advantage are absolute cancer.
---
One of my friends traded a Fez for a D scim... The guy thought it was some rare phat type thing and had never seen one before. It was pretty amazing since we both had like 20k to our names somehow
---
Max capes look so dull
---
this one right here officer

hard to have pride when you get your ass handed to your constantly, and you're the second fiddle to a filthy low born saiyan warrior. PITIFUL.

&gt;If you repeatedly follow someone to their new world and crash them over and over, thats against the rules. That's harrassment.

I think jagex should add this for sure. Xp only hiscores are boring as fuck. Clue hiscores was a step in the good direction. Now we need boss/raid hiscores.
---
Yet he enabled someone else to gain an advantage. So he encourages rule breaking.
---
That’s what I’ve been doing but after I got the talisman I was burnt out and just wanted to do something different you know?
---
Ah fuck, nvm then have all the rng. 
---
Sounds op against pures.
---
Potato maul then elder maul. No combo food left cuz karambwans got potato'd
---
300 kc and no item here. That means not even seen. I duoed half of my kills so Ive seen 450 kills.
---
Basically you courier the runes and unnote, and get paid in laws
---
Rich guy gets to grind RC with greater efficiency
---
why the hand though
---
It doesn't help at all and it's a waste of time; someone posted a screenshot of Facebook responding to a report by saying it *wasn't* a violation of community guidelines.
---
Personally I don't know why anyone would bother using Facebook nowadays though... they clearly don't care.
---
Can i have the black one if i crash ironmen?
---
Ignore him, he’s an idiot
---
Not everyone has the cash for a 40m sword, and for 5m Guthans is not "awful"... Guys like you two lol...
---
Is it worth it to also get 75 attack for a bulwark? Also just throwing this out there but how many total levels do you get for 50 ranged via cannon? You could red d/hide to help make sure people splash on you.
---
Correct me if i'm wrong but you will exclusively crash worlds with ironmen, people with lower stats, or people with lower gear to crash. Enlighten me on how you manage to call that "competing"
---
I've never had a post make me this nauseous before
---
Oddly enough, you're right
---
Depends on what you're looking for.
---
I would
---
If all your friends were named Cliff, would you jump off them?!
---
If you're praying pro melee you don't need defs or guthans, if you're praying piety you don't need prayer potions, just flick it on your attack ticks. 
---
You should definitely have tons of dusts from dust devils. Consider doing steam runecrafting some time to cut your elemental runes down from 4 slots to two. 
---
The whole point of bringing guthans is so you don't need to bring food
---
????
---
What are your stats?
---
Make sure it doesn't have a place holder also you might need to go through the process of getting every relic again
---
It technically belongs to yagex
---
Hugh, protector of ducks
---
I used addy and then brought dragon darts for jad. I had 83 ranged and 70 defence and 71 prayer so 95 should be way more than  enough. At those levels I had a ton of supplies left for jad every time. I also brought 6 manta rays for the last fight since you can heal without having to restore again. The holy wrench also helps a ton. Having 71 prayer made the supplies last a lot longer. I also used god dhide for the successful run since i feel like you need range accuracy more than defence bonus. What's your inventory set up?
---
Except nobody outside the US and possibly Canada are called Tanner but I still appreciate the meme.
---
I am assume he is wearing timbs just out of frame
---
No ass, tho.
---
Competing for resources in a video =/= toxic nor does it mean I have no empathy lmao. 
---
You dont need either of those things. Using food is superior to using guthans. Using dps special attack weapons (claw&gt;dds) is better than an sgs
---
50 base combat stats roughly
---
Until jagex approves a recovery request anyway.  Two factor authentication doesn't matter shit when you can just bypass it. 
---
 I had 2fa on my email and my runescape account.  I also used separate emails for the login to the runescape account.  And had different passwords for each that are used only for those accounts.  I woke up and jagex just granted a recovery request.  So I do everything I can to protect it and still doesn't work.
---
For you it might be a waste, but you gotta remember that he never played that account as of late. His focus for a long time has always been on his Ironman 10hp series. 
---
Plus since account sharing is a thing, he could easily use a friend’s/fan’s account for a new content video. 
---
At the end of the day, he made a few grand and lost a $500 account that could easily be replaced via his black market ways. 
---
13 trouts
---
like you only did construction thru WT?
---
This is genius😂
---
Lol this comment made me more nauseous than the original post.  XD
---
Gotohell
---
How could you say something so brave yet so controversial
---
It's not but it's the main reason. The 2 scenarios are not comparable at all, this is a video game and you can prevent getting crashed by getting good. 
---
If they are actually trying to kill you thats the same as actually trying to kill the boss or whatever, so not griefing. It they are just ragging with crystal bow or something without really trying to kill you then it may be considered griefing
---
Goodbye whip, barrows items... and yes, even you herb pouch. (Ironman btw.)
---
SGS and pegs.
---
spectral for cerberus, pegasian boots, 99 range/mage/prayer if you have not got those already
---
I can’t stand lavas. I just found a show I wanted to watch and did bloods while watching it. 
---
Pay someone to organize your bank 
---
As someone who's well over 150 superiors dry of gem and heart, go alch yourself.
---
Of course it's not the same, this is a fucking video game. Stop comparing it to reality where cutting people in queue has real consequences like not getting served. What are you going to do in-game, cry at me, I right-click ignore you and you end up hopping anyways because I out-gear you. 
---
2 simple words to prevent this: Get good.
---
Big security risk for shared computers. Would need a toggle.
---
And supporting poor people in Venezuela. 
---
Allah akbar
---
"why take 5 seconds to hop when i can just crash this guy, get less loot and xp? competing for resources BTW"
---
thats hardcore
---
It’s a cannonball but he blacked out one of the numbers cuz meme 
---
Stop being a scrub. Just but super combats noob
---
DJ KHARID!
---
Did exactly this, however I also remember that I was permanently muted and banned because of my foul language. I used to mine the rune essence however my comp was laggy so I would always type things like, “shit my computer is on crack right now etc.” 
---
Got muted for like a week and my dumbass didn’t learn from my mistakes and still did it until I was banned. Got sad and created another account and then became paranoid to say anything bad at all. 
---
(Also about 5 years later I learned I could appeal my ban on that account. Went back and claimed my fish jumped out of my bowl and typed it and it got accepted.)
---
even if it used 100% of spec bar, 2-3 anglerfish would be like doing 44-66 damage guaranteed
---
Yeah you’re right his new content videos probly get way more videos than the standard ones 
---
That's just called a diamond ring.
---
Actually. Kind of useful for pure accounts. 
---
Wanna know what is disgusting? I see this once in  a while in nmz, and one time there were a lot of people nearby, and I asked everyone to report the autoclicker.
---
Long story short, everyone stood up for the botter.
---
The concept of turning food into lower food is actually kind of interesting for a spec weapon. Obviously it couldn't be this but they could probably make a balanced weapon around that mechanic. 
---
You're beyond ignorant if you think at certain popular training spots it takes 5 seconds to find an empty world. It can take 5-10 minutes on busy days and that will add up to many hours on the way to 99 or 200m XP. 
---
Grats my dude. Did you do it the normal way or did you have blowpipe? Either way pretty cool 😎 
---
This dude makes great guides for rs3 pvm and puts a lot of work in them. But the autism of some of the 07 players is just too powerful.
---
The irony of an OSRS player saying a probability &gt;1% is poor. 
---
It’s heavily down to rng/gear set up for cannon/stars
---
Same on mobile if I haven’t been on that day. But every days first login I need my pin...
---
Blow pipe is the normal way these days 
---
What’s your username? Lemme just- what’s your username? 👹
---
Look on the bright side, you still have double xp. Grind boi
---
so what is your solution to drops, you can say take x resource out but what does said monsters drop then?  Without drops no one will pvm, and if no one is pvm'ing no one is buying your herbs...
---
Fast Free Laws (FFL) world 66. Trade the guys in zammy robes on Entrana. Man I remember at peak hours it would take a while to trade someone
---
He bought a sports car after selling his bank. Everyone knows, nobody cares. I don’t like the guy though.
---
Popular opinion: Don't dislike videos you haven't even fucking watched
---
q
---
Just under 70 I believe :) 
---
A better name for the weapon is "Potato Masher".
---
Did you do mlm straight for 2 months? From what level
---
It will drop really low considering the best fishing method is minnows and the d harpoon doesnt affect the catch rate.
---
I can't believe they bought your fish story but didn't accept my explanation that my older brother botted al kharid guards for 6 days straight to test his programming $ki11z
---
depends how much dmg you’re dealing with blowpipe vs cannon... Also hp is 1.33x xp per dmg point not 1.
---
Oof dont be rude.
---
If you can only afford one you should go with the kodai. Best of luck with your bursting/barraging!
---
This is proof to me that the *"Area only"* Ironman is just a dumb gimmick that's too restrictive to be entertaining. Even Swampletics series is just the same as everyone else's series:
---
*"Today i got X level in X skill, now i can do X activity! Please keep watching my leveling up slideshow montage*".
---
1 Defence pures are still the most entertaining accounts to watch, while not exactly Ironmen the game offers lots of different challenges that have to be at least somewhat rethinked when you take into account the fact that there is a lot of danger to be accounted for especially when it comes to bosses.
---
I think I had one banked like an idiot haha 
---
SHREKED
---
Pegasians, Toxic Trident, Imbued Heart. 
---
Wait. That's illegal. 
---
You not go through the stronghold of security at any point?
---
Well once you get to raiding the ironman CC's requirements are full elite void unless you have a torm and ahrims etc. Void bottom is one of the best magic def items for early slayer as well. I'd recommend checking out the ironscape discord and asking for help there.
---
No problem, brother! Happy to help out a fellow farmer :)
---
What am I looking at here
---
Yeah :)
---
Fez was actually expensive back then tbf, sounds like you got scammed lol
---
You do understand how long it takes to build a fanbase that will follow you around to different games right?  If you don't it's forever being a multi game streamer means you not only have to be entertaining but above average at every game you play.  Sparc is not above average at the other games he plays, but is good at RS.  Hence why his view count falls off a cliff when he switches from RS to say fortnite or SoT.  50k to toss away the engine that makes you much more money than that would be idiotic. He's even talked on his stream about how he would never RWT because it hurts his platform and would cost him money in the long run.  KEMP Q had none of these problems because he is a small youtuber.
---
Is no one reading that he is an Ironman?!? My suggestion is dust runes and don’t use pots. Taken care of. 
---
Lol dude they added that feature a long time ago
---
Holy shit that meme had be dying with my friend Jason. We used to sit at the park and offer people party hats for things they had, and say they were getting a good deal. 
---
Yeah that's why I like kronos seeds
---
this is where I met King Duffy
---
Yes will be back in a week or so grinding for a whip
---
They were losing money. They lost the essence.
---
Thank you:)
---
You always get +5 in stats you don't need, so what you have to do is trick the game into thinking you need a different stat. Go into your cc, talk about how you need a +5 herblore boost, have some herb materials ready in your inventory, etc. Then you'll get -5 herblore but you'll get +5 con because you've successfully tricked it into thinking you didn't care about con.
---
I hope you like a challenge because [Kakashi Sensei x Mr. Krabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4hY8leqMLg)already exists.
---
Yes, if it meant there wouldn’t be any more microtransactions/p2w dded.
---

---
It's not "gaurnteed damage" unless the  fight is a dm or results in death when you're out of food.
---
9001 shaman kc, and a quick trip past Oziach to boost RNG
---
I dont understand why they think flicking like this works in any capacity. Were they at one point 1 tick flicking and something went wrong and caused them to fudge it up?
---
Nah, fuck RS3 and Mod mark. They killed that game
---
H
---
Lol I got down vote botted
---
&gt;depends how much dmg you’re dealing with blowpipe vs cannon...
---
And thats why im asking because I assume someone here could know the average ratios based on previous expierence. There are complete blocklists and skiplists for maximum exp/h, so I didnt think that it would be so hard to find someone who knows how the combat to slayer exp ratio looks like for cannon+bp slayer.
---
Ez for Foe
---
&gt; after it was raided and i couldn't find any traces of it being deactivated.
---
Login to the official osrs site and click "account settings" then click the authenticator tab. It will either prompt you to add one or say you are already protected.
---
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas on how this could have happend?
---
The ddos attack you received makes me think it was a phishing scam you fell for. Have you been watching twitch recently or signed into anywhere with your information (even if looked like the osrs sign in page).
---
Chop chop!
---
You don't seem to understand, sparc likely makes 1-5k a night from donations/subs.  Why would he toss that away to get banned?  For him it's a net loss in the long run, because for the content he does (pking/staking) he needs a maxed account with tons of gold on it. If you've ever watched his channel when he switches games his view count drops by like 70-90%.  The money he would gain instantly is nothing compared to the long haul.
---
not as clue tbh
---
I genuinely used to be this cynical.
---
Bong dude 
---
Once he hits 75 he’ll be able to use the dragon fire shield and activate its d fire. Lol
---
Yeah I remember being a little noob and having like 83 magic and 77 range learning how to do a complex boss when I had never really PvM'd in oldschool.  100% worth sticking with it.
---
Fair enough, thanks.
---
I guess no one ITT has heard of tattoo make up 🤷‍♂️
---
I wouldn’t have chosen that spot, but with that being said it at least looks well done. 
---
Damn, I got perm muted because my young and stupid ass typed out a website link in public chat after some scammer had pmed it to me. I was just trying to mock him or some shit and I ended up quitting for years until I recently picked up oldschool. They denied my appeal and now I can’t talk forever because no quickchat... everyone thought I was botting for a bit so I would just world hop but now I’ve created a whole new account because it’s not worth keeping the nostalgia of my old one and I miss talking in game.
---
You clearly don’t know a good suggestion when you see one. This shit’s ingenious 
---
I remember getting 2.5k per invent. My friend and I called it "the trick". Because felt like it was an easy way of gaining a free money.
---
Just do slayer tasks and shoot the things they tell you to kill
---
You've got a long road ahead of you.
---
Send this to the tipoff jagex email. 
---
You've got to forgive your Dad already.
---
it’s a nice easy way to get that fletching cape trimmed, definitely recommend

I was actually subbed to Sparc mac for a year this last December for entertainment but decided to switch to Faux because I’ve always liked how he’s a normal streamer and doesn’t attract aids players.
---
Minimum stats / gear to do BA for fighter torso ?
---
No shit sherlock. Op is obviously not experienced at Zulrah. You want him to buy scrolls at 20k ea to die 20 times in the beginning?! That's really worth it.
---
Might need to do Ghost Ahoy for that I believe 
---
Didn’t walk on water. Downvoted
---
No pet?🙃
---
Times are changing, ass is the new vagina. 
---
Make a bug report in-game and try to get video evidence
---
If anything he will just get more views on YouTube because YouTube don’t give af about dislikes, just the audience.
---
Is this from Pet Semetary?
---
I don't share that issue, I personally love playing on my HD monitor. If I want easier clicks I use the stretched mode. 
---
However I would love scalable interfaces, I would love to be able to increase say the invent size etc. While keeping the minimap size the same. But I reckon this is a lot of engine work.
---
Test
---
He doesn't know
---
oh lmao
---
Maybe?
---
well, he used to sell gold back in rs2 days, people who mention it in his chat get banned.
---
You still can. A guy made a video recently about it. Using a Remote Desktop app on your phone you can leave your computer running and technically play from anywhere. Mobile is cool yes but with this you can lock your phone or do whatever, and you only have to click something every 20 minutes. Think on an inventory he goes for about 6 hours. I’ll try to find a link.
---
Yeah but it's a grind haha just figured I could make some spare cash this way w/o it. 
---
Lol wtf does this say 
---
I think Runelite has a plug-in for scaling UI, but I don’t use it so I’m not sure about any quality degradation 
---
I've seen these posts popping up in the last couple weeks - is there some underlying info I'm missing? They've all just been super standard and low level slayer tasks
---
I hoped you hadn't taken the "never" too literally, I'm not gonna run a billion fight simulation or anything, but raggers don't have to switch or do anything other than bolt you, sip brews, and occasionally prayer switch 
---
Wasnt aimed at OP, was replying to the other guy who claims they arent worth it. Im assuming he himself does zulrah and believes they arent worth the 20k, pipe down boy.
---
holy shit
---
Devalues my potato pure
---
V
---
This comment section is a disaster. Lol.
---
dont think about it too deeply, i just wanted to see peoples opinions and what items I might have never thought of to buy
---
what "warm" gear do i wear at windertodt at 1 defense? Never done it before
---
I did 1-84 through slayer. Got me to 64 slayer. I also killed 1k+ green drags for cash along the way. 84-99 I did in nmz. Used roughly 100k mith darts. About 60k/hour without blowpipe, and around 90k with. 
---
Maybe it was just a bad video
---
I want a quest complete when i die not while im still mid quest,
---
Whooosh
---
And yet here you are 
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
And restart the whole thing if you fall
---
\+5 runecraft, never logout
---
No, I think you missed my joke too
---
its quite well organized imo, every set sort of goes from left to right so i can click it faster instead of looking pretty
---
It's gambling on an online game you pussy
---
Target the main sources rather than the scapegoats if your going to bring up inflation
---
Okay if you want to be technical you little shit. The lizard men in the swamps northern end don’t count. Care to explain?
---
I hope that all the dickheads who disliked his video enjoy finding out that likes and dislikes are functionality identical to the YouTube algorithm.
---
It doesn't care if your *engagement* was positive or negative, it just cares that you clicked at all. So when you bother to go dislike some video about something you don't care about, congratulations - you just boosted its visibility on YouTube, social media, search engines.
---
Remember to dislike your enemies, kids - it helps them a lot!
---
Because they can respawn. Tanking them is faster and safer.
---
not just crashing the ironmen. but the ironwomen and the ironchildren too!
---
why
---
I mostly just want the cape for the free grapples in case I don't have one on me and it happens to be convenient.
---
It’s a troll and you took the bait

Gear setup: full blessed d’hide, arma helm, fury, blowpipe, addy darts, archers ring (i), god blessing, and barrows gloves

Smithing. What a skill

ye i might just spend all money on getting 99 range / prayer, how would I buy 99 magic though?
---
[Here's a small part of it.](https://i.imgur.com/7G0OTdm.png) I've had this account for almost a year now after coming from RS3. I've probably gotten at least 100 or so black masks on top of various other seeds and other loot skilling or AFKing cave horrors which put me at around 150M. From there I've been merching while doing farm runs. It also helps I was invited to the mobile beta and had been doing that for a good 6 months at work afk lol. 
---
Oh no! A 15% dislike ratio on ONE VIDEo how TrAGiC?!??!
---
Account sharing is a bannable offense
---
Rwt confirmed
---
Honestly mate, you should take a good long look at yourself.
---
Nobody's arguing that being crashed on runescape is anything more than a minor inconvenience, but if the only reason you're not a dick to people IRL is because you might yourself be inconveienced, that's kinda sociopathic.
---
Lol. You know what I meant. 
---
You teleported to piscatoris instead of chartering to port tyras. You disappoint me.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wintertodt#Warm_clothing

No point in reporting it. Facebook's reporting system is utterly useless, they'll say it doesn't violate their community guidelines. I've reported numerous fake accounts and it does nothing.
---
320k/ hour 
---
Smh... Should have gone through the stronghold of security! If it makes you feel any better almost all of us have feel for some kind of scam at least once in our rs careers.

Nooo thanks, not if you play on several accounts and use keybinds to log in

300-320k/ hour

Remember trying to buy items to do a clue lol
---
I know and i had it for all of 3 months lol
---
At least that makes sense to me
---
Sparc bought his mustang when he was like 16-18 and that was literally ages ago. How can you say "what are you talking about" 
---
Imagine just making a bug report and people being cunts in the comments. 
---
Lol imagine team rushing in the rev caves. 
---
Oh you brought enough brews to tank to the agility shortcut? That’s cute.

---
Instead of botting runner accounts they employed the actual players of the game itself. Nice. 
---
that bit had me in stitches
---
u chose to limit urself
---
Pures intentionally lock themselves out of game content by making specific account builds if you want to be able to do more stuff in game don’t be a pure 
---
Idk your combat stats but stats &gt; gear. 
---
If you don’t have 99 range and mage those are both very easy buyables and 100m would cover both of those 99s. 
---
When are these genius ideas going to be seriously considered by Jiggleflex?
---
Yes.  
---
I personally liked it because it usually ended up with us instead of buying something going out at getting it ourselves which made the game have more content than it does now.
---
ye ig, just would be nice to afk in NMZ for 6 hours like the rest
---
let pures get level 99 def
---
pros: y not
---
cons: none
---
So much yes.
---
Why the 2 cannons? Do they keep it from being able to melee you?
---
cons: don’t see any here
---
There seems to be a mistake, this post is tagged as [Humor] when it's clearly an excellent [Suggestion]

Lady in the mining guild who you buy the gloves from also has massive cans

its not 2016 everyone does slayer now

this... is brilliant

Why turn all of their food to potoes when you could just spec them with 30 ags'?
---
Nope. Not my problem. 
---
You took the words right out of my mouth. Same. 
---
The good ole days.... 
---
Lmao right
---
Worst npc design in all of rs history. 
---
Those people are scum
---
How about something like a Mandrake enemy, where there's a random chance it spawns whenever you pull up any plant.
---
Oh wow makes me loose the motivation to do arma at all. Sorry bout your rng bro
---
How is that an unpopular opinion? GE was voted in with 76% support and no one complains about it.
---
Yeah completely on the same page. This has been on my mind since the "mithrilman" suggestion has been floating around. 
---
I honestly think people forgot just how insanely time consuming trading was and get caught up in how cool the community-vibe was. We were all younger then and probably had alot more free time then we currently do. I prefer not spending 20 minutes trying to buy a rune scimitar at market value. 
---
Meaning
---
Why spec them a 30 with an AGS when you can just turn their food into potatoes?
---
Some one is salty that they haven’t seen green money 😭😭😭😭
---
Isn't it actually so that his farming cape will stay untrimmed? I think if he gets another 99 with the farming cape in his inv/bank, his farming cape will receive a trim.
---
Wait till 75 range and use a blow pipe
---
This was it. 
---
What's your escape plan?
---
 Why turn all of their food to potoes when you could just spec them with 30 ags'? 
---
Didn’t wanna grind out range I hate it but I’ll probably end up doing it lol
---
Having played OSRS semi-self-sufficiently pre-GE and now playing ironman mode I have to say it's really not the same.
---
You can try tweeting Mod Ash and asking about how exactly the rune and dragon axe differ, but I believe those algorithms are might be a bit too complicated.
---
Pretty much everyone who on this forum does.
---
Got Rigour?
---
I used to use recorder to record 5k alchs, then play that once a day, no need to even use repetitive auto clickers. That was a long time ago, but worked for 4 pk accounts. The 94 mage barrier to pk on anything other than a pure is a bit cancer for RS if pking as all you're interested in

I used rcb with broad bolts and diamond bolts for jad, and just used the best range armor i had, but you should get 70 ranged and use god dhide for prayer bonus

Is that what people think? I have 494 bandos kc, I've been crashed maybe 4 times. The only ones that get crashed have some sort of Ironman reference in their name, which is their own fault.

Thats the plan yes, thing is I just reached 43 and am only able to superheat for now untill I reach high alch.. unless you ment to low alch untill 55?
---
The best one was where he got cleaned on a friday at the duel arena, then on the monday uploaded a new video showing off his mustang
---
Eat my ass daddy
---
That's a good question to tweet at Mod Ash.
---
I've got a shitload of logs from 99fm on my hcim too so I was wondering if I should fletch them into bows but then I was wondering what to do with them? String them or not? Alch or sell?
---
If you solo, yeah, mostly people crash
---
I'd vote for it. 
---
um no i'm done with rs.
---
Or an anguish
---
Yeah pal, make a pure, defense is too high and Hp is too low for your level my friend 
---
Sage advice. 
---
At least ‘itchnoo’ gets it.
---
It's a novelty account. Quite interesting imo
---
Yes. Stop using botclients.
---
Use torso/torag or torso/obby. People aaying you shouldnt be uaing barrows for general training  are wrong. Its dirt cheap to use. Obby lega qill giveyou better dps but more susceptible to damgage soit depends what you are fighting.
---
This is me and I’m not even a “new” player. Just super casual. 
---
It is with tick eating but my series is about doing things with out complex combat mechanics, with inconsistent ping a lot of people won't even be able to tick eat.
---
Sit.
---
I just started back after more than ten years away bc of the nostalgia. The most I ever had back then was under 2m. I can't even fathom 120m or how you'd spend it...
---
I did mention the full health respawn, you can bring chins but that takes up a slot and if you're going to wait to tag the healers all at once he may heal up quite a bit, not great for lower levels.
---
The screen resolution is separate from the scaling. In Windows 10, on a XPS 13 I had with a 1080p screen, I used 150% scaling (still at 1080p) because 100% was too tiny. This was seemingly fine with every program and OSRS.
---
But those other two methods (the Java flag and RuneLite) work fine as well and aren't attached to the OS scaling.
---
Good luck!!
---
lol get over it, such a baby put him the ignore list and play the game.
---
Yeah everybody is able to do it they just need to chillll
---
Exactly! It makes your exp pretty crazy, and it's crazy against Zulrah and a few others. It's even profitable on some slayer tasks if you want the ranged experience/ want to safespot to avoid having to pray.
---
Use guthans on the little bois that spawn from chubby bois or from melee boys with protect melee on.
---
Could put it toward a twisted bow which costs 1.2B
---
Oh I didn't see you had it already lol
---
Unrelated but one of my favorite parts of 2007scape over rs3 is the open areas where there just.. isn't anything really. The whole piscatorias hunting area, the "woods" north of Falador. Just really like it for some reason. Calming. 
---
In Rs3 seems like everything is cram packed with random bullshit and you can't have a gamescreen that doesn't have at least 3 events/questpoints/minigames/etc. 
---
That's cool man 
---
Yeah picking the flax isn't too fun, but with Throne of Misc, if you put max allocation into flax picking (along with 750K in the coffer), you can get 1.2K of flax a day.
---
I heard there's also some minigame that rewards bowstrings too.
---
Bring boost potions! They’ll help a lot with slayer and combat experience per hour. If your trying to save money you can buy super attack potions and then use a dragon battle axe spec for the strength
---
That must've been allt of BlessRNG to make that happen 
---
I hope you charged them. I hear english is 80k each nowadays.
---
Are we just going to ignore the dozens and dozens of quest bosses though? Those are supposed to be the real introduction to pvm, but for some reason people throw them out all the time as if they don't count even though most of them are harder than Obor or other low level bosses that people suggest on reddit. The content is there. If people choose to not do it that seems like their own problem
---
Judging by the downvotes on my comment, I'm assuming people believe I want it to look "special snowflake-y." Which I don't.
---
I just don't like the color scheme, thats literally it. No need for neon lights.
---
It's too bright red. I understand the normal max cape would clash with it if it was much deeper, but the other two capes are much more representative of the actual Ironman icon color. 
---
Right now, it looks salmon-colored.
---
Can confirm I got scammed this way with charcoal. I then sold the charcoal using this very same scam lol 
---
Lol you'll soon learn range is the easy one

Really wish they were unlocks for Nieve and Duradel so I don't have to waste points skipping them.

It isn't. I've already asked mod ash via Twitter and he said it's not tracked. Though he did warn me to be careful what program knows my password.
---
People used to pass it off as a rare item and sell it for a lot of gp. No clue why. I don’t think the spinach rolls are tradable anymore though

Funny idea hahahah, gotta work for the loot :)

Jagex upped the membership price to 11 dollars. When mistakes happen people say 11 dollars because the money wasn't put to good use. Usually just meming though

Why would you ever block money demons?

Bro if someone is that stupid to just hand him 1m they deserve to lose it

Inventory management is a massive part of the game, let's just take out 10 items and never worry about then again! Oh good idea!!!

Good point, support
---
Just sit at 155 hp and youll be fine

I'm not a snowflake. I'm not even an ironman.

I love it, when are you producing more

Stupid question but are you using swamp paste?  Cuz you might be using swamp tar and that won’t work.
---
Cheers, I'll look into it!

Support btw
---
Sorry im an idiot, you said that before and I forgot. I believe when I was getting early magic levels I just did fire strike on slayer monsters until i had the levels to do more advanced stuff. 
---
Enchanting jewelry might be a good option, i think you can turn a decent profit doing that.
---
The Final Alch
---
m8 you gotta use the double eyepatch lol
---
Yeah I figured this is an unpopular opinion. But I also loved questing, so depends on the person lol
---
They are only ~450k gp/hr and the task takes awhile without barrage. With barrage, it's not very much profit and annoying with the teleportation.
---
Maul should be 1/128 droprate, otherwise i dont see how this wouldn't pass polls.
---
I wish, My buddy from work shared me the IMGUR link, im googling it now, so far ill try "College Professor hates Pomgrantes" or "Allergic to Pomgrantes"
---
Isn’t even buying something specific, just buying.
---
The majority of the community took a long time to convince that the GE was a good idea. Everyone had this idea in their head that the GE would kill the game because no one would have any reason to interact with each other. I remember certain youtubers/streamers making very vocal arguments to their viewers about why the GE was bad so I'm sure that had a lot of impact.
---
In reality trading pre GE wasn't at all about "player interaction". For a long time the system was add someone on Zybez, go to their location, buy item, delete them. You had a pretty good chance of being scammed, especially with certain items like dragon bones, or even tricked in to going to a certain location where you would end up dying (like Tai Bwo Wannai where the tribesmen would poison you).
---
If you found someone selling or buying items in Varrock West bank, it was almost guaranteed to be a bot who was buying at stupidly low prices and selling at stupidly high prices.
---
I bring to you...
---
That's a given
---
Ok all these guys in comments are retards, start using the kempq way, get 17 tier 10s by paying people to let you kill them. And then get your main banned for rwt so you cant turn back

---
Can’t wait to see this posted another time :))))))
---
No worries, this is reddit after all haha!
---
Probably fire strike, I am sitting on dozens of rings of pursuit that wont sell for 50% of the price. Doing the slayer tasks is such a good idea! I think I will go for that.
---
Use runelite it will tell you the world. 
---
Well, if they'd suicide a few times there's quite some stacks of mats there for an hour
---
There is a difference between crashing and attacking everything in the room 1 time though. Not saying that's what happened here, but it happens often. 
---
low alch will always be negative profit. superheat is something I haven't looked up however 
---
I only ever been scammed once in my life, no joke.  I changed my password to FULLRUNE in 2003 to get full rune but instead I lost my account to a guy wearing a chefs hat, I never had recovery questions set so he set them and I never got my account back. 
---
That was the first and last time I was ever trusting of another person in my life.

Ancestral body and top are the same item, but okay.
---
Whats the fungal situation on your chair
---
Apparently it's a psych class and she was trying to teach them how to not teach children "just yelling no is a bad way to teach a child"

Would that just make is so you can ask someone to buy something for you from the GE for you?

Use RuneLite and it'll label your drops.

It's fun to do big quests on release date without any guides because everyone is doing them at that time. But long term when you're doing like a 100 quests to build your account...then yea i prefer to run through them with a guide. 
---
One time somebody tried to lure with me with the old trusty “YouTube vid in the wild” and tried to get me to throw a chinchompa, but my Internet was so bad it lagged and my brother had me stop in time. The worst part.. it was for granite body gmaul and rune platelegs
---
Fuck that. I'm not a masochist.
---
Yeah I don't know either, I'm not an ironman lol
---
Using lamps or quest rewards or some shit. The actions give it away

If you're trying to be "efficient" you should use torso/obby, but barrows armor makes you take significantly less damage. I did all my training with barrows armor because you don't have to pay as much attention to your hp.

K nice flex i guess 
---
Disqualified. 
---
For me, it depends. Especially since I've done a lot of the quests already pre-EOC. Something like RFD and all the subquests for it, I'm definitely going to go through a guide don't get me wrong. But at the same time doing a quest I haven't done before without a guide every now and then is just fun imo.
---
Perhaps you can look at the quest log in game, sometimes it will tell you what you need to do next. At the very least it will give you some idea of where the quest is hanging.

Ye the 125/150% thing is exactly what makes it unplayable. It becomes blurry as fuck, giving me headaches. I have to completely change the screen resolution to make rs bearable, but that makes all other things on the laptop complete shit (chrome, yt, netflix, spotify etc)

It's clearly a joke mate

Bro I remember I saved up a bunch of money (100k)

To buy a g maul. I bought a rock hammer, he told me it was the same thing but better..

I cried for an hour when I figured out you couldnt even equip it. 
---
Time is money. A RS account is invested full of time. Very worth selling.
---
Nmz is even more afk if you do it right. I did 80-99 att and str with dharoks on my ironmeme at NMZ with a 12minute timer, so 12min complete afk (absorbs-get to 12hp-use cake/orb to go back to 1 and boom another 12min full afk)

Your mobile is (generally) password locked to get on.

Having this on the computer leaves it open to friends, family and if logging in from a public computer, strangers. Obviously avoidable if people are careful but people often are not.

My train of thought was that the obby cape has been the bis buyable cape for like a decade now. Making this one a slashy weaker fire cape would be neat.

My heart goes out to all the noobs who were scammed right next door on the top floor of the staff shop with the “follow me, and let’s see who will trade me more money” scam...(AKA Me as an 11 year old.) I used to check it after that in world 1 as if I was some sort of vigilante scam preventing rs officer...? Nearly always someone awkwardly logging as I entered the room. Ah, the good ol’ days! 
---
what's wrong with a maxed uim trying to have some fun in a game?

For the most part you would have to do everything yourself like an ironman but every now and again you would find that perfect trade and manage to snag a mithril platebody. It was so much more exciting and raw. Now you just buy what you need at the GE

You'll definitely stand a better chance and have more variety if you get 42/45 def but the meta of msb Ags largely remains the same.

Unless you want to pure brid I would suggest getting some defence. High levels=higher loot and if you're at all successful in your current bracket you should be fine in your new one. There will be some rigour rangers but they can often be veng stacked without too much problem.

They're not going to play osrs even if some osrs dances gained popularity in the media. Younger kids don't care about games like osrs due to it being an old game with outdated graphics and mechanics.

There's a reason why the osrs's playerbases average age is quite high. OSRS is mostly played by people who used to play it when they were kids

Without the G/E people are stuck buying and selling items to merching bots, which is exactly why the G/E passed the poll in OSRS.

What sort of account do you want? A 1 defence pure? A zerker? A void ranger? Do you plan on edgeville/bh style pking or no honour pking? There are a lot of different builds around the 80 combat mark, and so we need to know what your looking for.
---
and i just got a jar of swamp :(

I only ever liked staying 60 because it's the nostalgic of being a \*REAL\* zerker. haven't really played it anymore because i got bored of it like you just said.

I think he's just doing random ironic dancing lol

Yeah I mean that's just the kinda game it is. Runescape does not hold your hand at all.

Not as bad but 300kc 1 unique
---
Yo........this actually happened to me. You just dug up a ~15 year old repressed memory that I didn’t even know I had. Wow.
---
Definetly not a 1 def, but 1 with like 99 range. What do you suggest then?
---
loooool fml
---
So movement isn't actually required, just the fact that it's instanced means you can get double logs from 3t? It seems odd that the only videos I see of this move around so much. 
---
Wot? 
---
it won’t be for hours and hours because it’s a speed run and a cross fit only ironman so i wouldn’t be training on cows id be in the gym doing crossfit 
---
How long have you been at The Gower Institute for the Autistic? 
---
Understood, thanks!
---
Start burying your bones GG

maybe make a voider then 42 def and 50/60 attack and 52 prayer and rest 99, theres guides on youtube
---
Lmao I do
---
This is why I stopped playing my Ironman lol
---
Whitest party ever

Honorable mention to Blighttown.

I mean to be completely fair, I think Mithrilman is still a great idea. Sure it's a lot less efficient than taking part in the legitimate ingame economy but that's like saying Ironman is a stupid idea for the same reason

I think its currently 10 on mining and 5 on raw fish
