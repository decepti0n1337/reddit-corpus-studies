a buff that needed to happened, too.

I saw one comment\\post about how the dude had to actually use pots for an extended task (!!!!) the horror.
---
---
---
Absolute beast - would totally recommend getting elite void
---
ok then play the game, if youre actively playing you'll also get to max combat pretty easily in 3 years. this is an ALTERNATIVE for people who have limited time, or dont want to do other methods.
---
1 star lmao. Great pay for little work is at least a 3 in my book
---
Congratulations sir on being the dumbest person on this sub for the day.
---
If he wasn't before, losing his void would have definitely made him a spite voter
---
Like I said... if you‚Äôve been playing casually for 3 years you should be above base 85s. Even if you play an hour a day on average.
---
I didn't sell anything to anyone. Guys, If I had done something wrong, I would not be asking for help, but I did nothing wrong, please ask them to help me. I know I can only create another account, but it bothers me that it has been banned for a reason that does not even have to do. I appreciate that account, don't let it die unfairly.
---
Congrations to ur wizdom
---
So you don‚Äôt reach 500? I don‚Äôt fletch and can get to ~650 easily, especially with a lot of relighting the brazier
---
those are my next goals!
---
The hour a day was literally just making a point, I haven't actively played in a long time and even when I did I didn't spend that much time on RS per day because I was in University but it really is just easy to level in OSRS.
---
He hasn't made a video in like 2 months and i dont watch twitch much so i never know what hes up to
---
Lookin great tho

USA USA USA USA

:(
---
it worked poorly, extremely buggy and unsecured
---
Read the full thing. It says "As we‚Äôve said, this is not an exhaustive list, and we reserve the right to add features to this list in future. We‚Äôll continue to monitor community concerns about other specific features and offer more clarity if it‚Äôs needed." followed by "However, we don‚Äôt want players to be left in constant fear of possible bans, so we‚Äôll give advance warning if any additional features are being considered for the list."
---
That means the list doesn't contain everything but they will add it to the list before it is bannable. They won't ban players for plugins that aren't on the list without warning. The guideline mentioned is only what is unacceptable; what is bannable is what is on the list. If features like the ones OSB highlights here are unacceptable, they will be added to the list before they start banning players. Simple as that.
---
As for the ground item plugin and loot tracker, it is a stretch to say they are against the rules because you don't have to right click to see items. If a whip is on the floor, I can visually see that already; a plugin that adds the name wouldn't break the guideline because a click is not required. Same for a loot tracker; you can get ingame loot notifications so you can already know every drop without seeing it.
---
Sentinel @ 274 (range/crush) vs Graardor @ 340 (anything but mage) is 100% more defense? Is that how defense levels work?
---
slayer bosses defo regular monsters maybe like high lvl mobs with alot of hp like adamant dragons or rune dragons idk but dds works fine at those if u dont have dragon hunter lance/xbow
---
missing the point lol
---
Elitism? You‚Äôre joking right? I‚Äôm just being honest and I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs bad because he‚Äôs low CBL. I‚Äôm just saying he should be higher if he played even an hour a day average for 3 years.
---
To be fair you risk nothing as a pure. You can always learn, everyone had to at some point. Its discouraging to start but not a big deal if each death is &lt;100k tbh
---
Of course you are, I ask all the time too. There's just no reason to make this game easier than it already is. It's such a simple thing to just see the bird nest and pick it up
---
Lol I thought they were actually fun.  Fuckin hate them now.
---
It's only 30 m because it's hard to get, it should be around 1 m
---
Wow this is amazing well done buddy
---
Abberant spectres are an entirely different thing. You pray mage and take 0 damage. And they're fast to kill.
---
Knights are slow to kill, deal decent melee damage even against a maxed melee main, require constant prayer, and now have an attack that slows your kills more if you don't dodge it.
---
They're a 60 slayer monster. You need that to be able to kill them. 55 RC is a joke as well, that's a few hours without even taking into account that most have quested and lamped and tears'd their level past that easily. It's still a low req.
---
Lol No Mercy I love it üî• video
---
Because it's the same problem. Degraded stuff never rewards what it should. It's slightly under half a weapon at the maximum all the way down to a single shard.
---
When we could have a system like revenant ether for the wildy weapons. Where they need to be charged to a bare minimum. A system that was actually designed with the wilderness in mind. Unlike every other degradable in the game has been.
---
People take breaks. My account is only two years old and it's barely into the 70s because I had to start putting more time into my work and most days I don't get time to play at all.
---
"I need to acquire spade" - every pker ever.
---
How about we just lock all slayer monsters at 99 slayer? Seems only fair to me
---
Didn‚Äôt berate you lmao
---
You asked why you couldn‚Äôt go back and change a slayer task to a completely different slayer task (tzhaar vs jad), comparing it to dropping an untradable, one use, item and later reclaiming it to use. 
---
They are so damn different, that comparing them is fucking silly. 
---
Maybe your IQ isn‚Äôt low but your comment lacked basic critical thinking. If you thought about your comment, and thought ‚Äúyeah, this is a good thing to say, this is a valid point‚Äù, then yeah, maybe your IQ is a bit lower than the average. 
---
But to comment about me berating you...and equating me calling your dumbass out to me also having a shit life? Jesus Christ dude get a grip.
---
Thanks for watching üòÅ
---
60 slayer is a drop in the bucket of 99 slayer or maxing. You train combat stats while doing it and it's bloated as fuck with tons of bonuses, bis gear, task-only bosses, konar keys, wildy keys (that are *still* getting buffed, see: dagon'hai robes), emblems (soon to be removed though) etc. Balancing decisions should not be made around level 60 slayer when that's a whopping 2% of the total xp to 99.
---
Stfu
---
It is. OP just didn't know it and has been runecrafting with the lamp :D
---
Maybe he didn't play an hour a day lol, maybe he had better things to do than play an mmo. And "bad" lol. Runescape isn't exactly a high mechanical skill game.
---
If twisted bow doesn't exist and melee meta is back serp would be a costlier and better choice in a lot of situations because the +1 strength doesn't offer a max hit, and the defensives, poison immunity and venom damage easily outweigh +3 prayer bonus, which does nothing if you're flicking.
---
Maybe you need to learn to read and/or use a dps calc.
---
Dwh?
---
Although I agree f2p has some really bad aspects, such as the mass bots. There's no denying that f2p players are needed. People aren't always willing to invest money into a game without first trying it, hence why almost every major AAA game company do BETAs, so people can try the game before paying money for it.
---
Could have just stayed 60 if all you wanted was to bully pures.
---
They're only best in slot for range and that might not even be true soon
---
Well you basically took a mid level slayer monster and made it so you need super high stats to actually kill it effectively. Why even gate it behind 60 slayer at this point lol?
---
I would love to make an ironman pker, but holy shit that's time consuming and I hate questing/pvming/skilling enough, can't imagine having to get my own resources everytime without a grand exchange üò´
---
what's the point then?
---
It depends on order. If bp existed and then tbow and slayer helmet were added, the slayer helmet would be the better item. The order matters because slayer helmet scales based on items.
---
Yeah I noticed a disclaimer at the bottom of the blog that these would not be discontinued rewards. I maintain the belief that the rewards should be untradeable though.
---
not all i want to do but yeah i know lol
---
Getting the existing playerbase to play the game in new ways. For a game to which it is notoriously difficult to attract (and keep!) new players, this is the future in my opinion :-)
---
Don't you dare add dildos to red slayer helms cheeks.
---
Not a bad idea overall, just some design considerations
---
With a funny title
---
Thank you very much! I can do a personal commission for a price depending on what you were looking for (send me a pm), but if it‚Äôs just an idea you wanted to throw out there, just post it on this thread and maybe you‚Äôll see it in the future. I‚Äôm always looking for inspiration!
---
Time to graduate kids...  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/)
---
The defense bonuses don't add.
---
If you want to calculate what the equivalent defense would be with +0 bonus it's:
---
[(Def +8 ) (Bonus +63) / 63 ] - 8
---
So 250 with +90 bonus is equivalent to 618 defense with +0
---
[removed]
---
Wow rude
---
Well it's named master for a reason :)
---
run craft because run needed to craft mind blown
---
You have two design routes:
---
A) All task add +1 point, so the dumb ones are skipable (250 raids, dwh hammer drop, maxing, skilling pet, omlet with dust..).
---
B) The dumbest tasks give exponentially more points in an attempt to match the exponential extra work they take
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
With option A) casual players will have heavier weight at creating these uniques than the top 10% of bottle-pissing lads
---
With option B) if points are exponential as the task work, few will create most of the cosmetics
---
All those things were OP and so was this.
---
You plebians think you guys are all knowing with your mid-level accounts and think that somehow your opinions should weigh as much as streamers who play osrs professionally with thousands of hours clocked.
---
You don't know the number of jaws that came into the game.
---
There's a reason jagex mods take in faux, sick nerd, b0atys opinion. It's because they literally helped build the game up to what it is currently.
---
Who the fuck are you.
---
I‚Äôm more on the side that the game should be fun and not pandering to only end game players when basilisk knights were fine
---
I know that is what it said, but when I claimed my Varrock Medium lamp, it also let me get the Easy lamp that I had dropped long ago. 
---
[Those are literally the only two lamps I ever got on my pking main](https://i.imgur.com/kqNoMxV.png) so the memory is pretty clear.
---
But then the boss would have to have a low max hit. Otherwise you're taking 3 hitsplats per attack, since it would be insanely easy to get combo'd out, and that's just awful design.
---
If you want damage to go through protects to want incentivize tanking, then you just need typeless damage that's not reduced by protects but the accuracy of the hit is reduced by armor, similar to Nomad.
---
&gt; to keep serp bis
---
And this is why your opinion is weighted in a bias. You want the serp to remain the best option in all circumstances except slayer task. 
---
Faceguard doesn't offer a max hit in all situations, and doesn't have the same defence stats as serp or poison immunity or venom damage. So it hasn't even entirely trumped a 5 year old item.
---
And zulrah is easy mate, just because it was hard for you doesn't mean it's hard. You can build an account from scratch to Zulrah ready very quickly, and 75 mage 75 range is stupidly easy to do it at those levels. I did my diary kill all those years back with those stats and downed it first try. 
---
So no I don't think faceguard is badly designed, I think your stuck in a mindset of wanting a low req old boss to continue dropping bis melee helm for anything off task, alongwith a heavily used near bis range weapon and the old bis mage weapon.
---
Nobody forced any change, but having best in slots come from an afk monster when it could have come from a different source is dumb as hell (one of the frequent rhetorics of jagex is it's hard to find rewards for pvm bossing/raids, and they waste a potential one on an afk slayer monster)
---
Name any spot you'd use a serpentine helm over the nezzy.
---
nice logic
---
Hover over the combat styles  it will show you what damage type they use (Lunge is Stab, everything else is Slash) as well as what experience they give.
---
However, Arclight has a much higher slash bonus (+38) compared to stab (+10) so you'd be better off using slash anyway.
---
The xp/hr difference between granite cannonballs vs normal cannonballs is on the order of 3%. I tested this less than a week ago while grinding out 99 slayer. Only *the* most efficiency-obsessed people would bother buying them and 30gp is a fairly generous fraction of the cost of a cannonball comparable to its relative increase in max hit.
---
nobody in their right mind would kill them for money once they drop below 10m. so it will rise again. its called economics.
---
I wish my scribbles looked 1/10000th is good. Practice makes... and all that bullshit but you have real talent. I really like your style and although the background isn‚Äôt detailed I really like its menacing vibe. Beautiful piece and would love for you to post more. Thanks for sharing and further thanks for not having to include a sob story about how your dog just got done battling her 8th bout of chemo.

ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄJAMFLEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST NECKBEARD DEMANDS ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Literally revert the changes, make it so you cant safespot, and make it so they ignore prayer/sometimes defense. Now they arent as afkable but still doable without wanting to kill yourself.
---
nope, i used a max hit calc, max hit increase of 1 over helm so about 2%, op af. nerf justified. pack your bags, guys, its over!
---
the serpentine helm can do significantly more upwards of 20% more dps than what this helm will give. suffice to say, it doesn't work on certain bosses, but over the serpentine, the +1 str is negligible, not even worthy of a rational (mathematical) increase in max hit.
---
yea it would be neat everyone in mystics and magic shortbows again lol
---
So you need a 40m weapon as a mid level with 60 Slayer to do it efficiently.
---
Nice
---
Mate, your post history says it all.. 
---
You deserve to be muted, there is always evidence on a mute and you refuse to share it.

You keep purposefully misunderstanding my comments just to be a jerk.

dragonstone is used if you expect them to not have antifire protection. Usually in higher stakes fights they will be

*trips you with snake tail because you murdered their king*
---
Fremenik Trials is a 30 minute quest that introduced a new BiS and made the previous BiS,rune full helm worthless.
---
Fremenik Isles is a 30 minute quest that introduced a new BiS and makes berserker helm obsolete.
---
The Fremenik Exiles is a 30 minute quest and retards keep shitting their pants about it.
---
Serpentine works on literally no meta bosses.

MMOs are traditionally competitive like this, RuneScape is no different. If you can't compete for a spot, find a different one.

I love watching c engineer gank people on his pvp hardcore lol

Yeah, what the fuck.

The only one that doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes out and shove them into my ears is gunschilli
---
Why would you? There are better options that you can unlock/buy
---
You say that like jagex cares
---
Admiring the hard work put in by developers who spend hours creating an amazing world for you to explore and be immersed in is xp waste though.
---
it can have content, but BIS items shouldnt come from mid game afking
---
Thanks. This is across a couple of leagues + main game, so my guess would be no more than 45 hours on any specific character. Still quite a bit though.
---
I made a custom loot filter that ignores whites and greens except for gear upgrades and super profitable ones. So that means I pick up rares and above, generally. I'll try making a new char this league with the suggestions in this thread and see how it goes.
---
Agreed but those weapons were gay
---
I would imagine so. They already previously mentioned a morytania only one.
---
Why the looting bag drop rate???? It‚Äôs annoying enough that I have to go get one, now it‚Äôll be more difficult?
---
Aight, so they added an authenticator
---
And your email takes care of all of that other password security stuff
---
If there was a problem with account security, its been fixed then.
---
Can't wait to see Swampletics competing in a Morytania League! Swamp man good
---
At least its real people and not bots replying to support messages.
---
gotta have the c r i s p y boys
---
Good point
---
Higher across the board? Underground pass and a basic mage and range level is higher than Exiles and stats to kill knights at all well? I don't think so..
---
If I‚Äôve got other people playing w/me doing stuff like cox or a bit of Callisto at times, it isn‚Äôt too bad going dry for a drop, though raids is the worst place to go dry for since when you‚Äôre with a team that generally knows what they‚Äôre doing, it will still take a decent while per raid.

What the fuck are you trying to say?

Is it Random Zulrah after 4:30 Minutes in a Fight?
---
Yea if youre a noob
---
And this is linked to 1 NPC being slightly harder to kill, seems like you're making a bit of a meal of it.
---
upvotes/downvotes mean nothing because after 1hour everybody follows top comment trends. This thread we hate Jagex and anybody who is max combat and the next we won't.
---
 No doubt but the stats don‚Äôt lie
---
Sote is not a hard quest though.
---
At time of release they were, but they haven't been for a very long time. 
---
But the point isn't that they are or aren't good items right now, the point is that they eventually got stepped over by items that were far more easily obtainable. You originally said that the serp helm should be better than the face guard because it's coming from objectively much more difficult content. But the dragon 2H is bested in literally every single way by a cheap item available from an "experienced" difficulty quest. Barrows is objectively way easier than KQ, but outclasses the shit out of the d chain even if you don't account for set effects.
---
What I'm driving at is that content difficulty doesn't need to reflect in the stats of items. It's okay for an easier to get item to step over something that comes from harder content, especially when that item has been in the game for a long time. Serp has existed in OSRS for over 4 years, it's okay if it gets replaced in a few niche situations. For the majority of setups, the +1 strength bonus from the face guard won't actually give you a new max hit anyways, so the serp helm will still be better because it has much better defensive stats. It's not being totally replaced, it's just losing its status as the BIS item for every single melee scenario (other than tanking with Justicar, but that only applies to like 1% of the player base).
---
Thanks. Runelite makes the game more entertaining and i kinda just stopped playing when i saw the post about 3rd party

What happened in ds2?

Multipart question about mid game ironman (1400-1600).
---
I want alchables. Like thousands of alchables. What‚Äôs the plan? I‚Äôd prefer as little time commitment as possible. Current idea is maple longbows using kingdom + temple trekking. I think that pays for the nats.
---
Second question ties in. I want a self-sustaining cash stack. On slayer I can get like, chump change per hour. I‚Äôd like some sort of cash flow and I don‚Äôt know how to set it up.
---
Thanks for your help.

@Sicknerdosrs
---
Chaos Tunnels would be great
---
You can thank JageX for not getting the balance right in the first place.
---
as a pve player I voted yes to everything but the last question as i don't want pvp weapons in my area of the game. Was really excited to see some new PKing videos with some of these upgrades :(
---
Real people *do* reply to support messages done through the actual helpdesk site. The bot responses are on Twitter.
---
I've played rs3 when it was rs2. It's not for me, that's why I'm playing oldschool lmao, not sure why you're now using a second ad hominem. It's dumb. 
---
&gt;this is an old school impractical game, not everything has to consider your time and efficiency - ?????
---
Doesn't mean everything has to be unnecessarily tedious though, does it?
---
Rolls off history, you have been caught. Punishment shall be swift.
---
Youre a sick nerd for that pun
---
I had to turn off the plug in there because it just isnt needed. If anything it made me mess up more for some reason
---
&gt;All of those are much harder to get though, you can‚Äôt really compare the value of a boss or clue scroll drop to a basic mob drop
---
Demonic Gorillas aren't boss drops. Why are you ignoring them? 
---
And bask knights are not a 'basic mob.' It's literally a superior, essentially elite mob. A perfect comparison to Demonic Gorillas, huh?
---
I feel this. Only at half the kc but it feel this lol
---
Or make it a task only npc like cerberus?
---
Why would I want to spend more time playing a game where the developers think this update is a good design decision lmfao
---
I play this game for 10 hours every few months and then go play actual skillful games with the rest of my free time
---
That doesn't even make sense lmao.. So when you reach low-level slayer at your respective level, you shouldn't be able to kill it?
---
I get maybe 1 in 5 nests because I never notice them.  I keep my chat to clan so I miss the notifications and I can never see them on the ground because they blend in (colorblind).  It sucks.
---
Tbh it's fine where it comes from. Especially if they follow through with not wanting useful gear and drop it to a +5. Then this content well and truly dead seeing as faceguard is only marginally better in melee situations for CoX and ToB and as an attacker in gwd groups
---
What is your method exactly? I found reaching 500 points without fletching pretty simple.
---
"hey I'm kind of hungry, can we get some food?"
---
"Here's some lard and monster energy"
---
"Wtf I don't want this, can I have actual food?"

"No - we don't think that you eating lard and monster needs to change"
---
Yep, all the way from 58
---
Thanks, I appreciate the info!
---
See I bank all my items then allow them to do the trick to make me run out. Then I plead with the rusher to not kill me for my bank. Die, loose some random shit from my bank I threw in and continue with my day.

finally? i see killer art all the time
---
Hopefully you didnt use up all your luck. I got 1 tome in 550ish kc lol

Unlock additional content.
---
I've always hated questing but in recent years, I've become a bit attached to the questing like it's another skill. I really enjoy the achievement diaries because it gives me goals to strive for and it rewards me for completion with some great QoL benefits.

I also enjoy doing clues and slayer if I feel like vegging out.
---
I like it.
---
holy shit Boaty is inked up dude!
---
The smoother way to comprehend what he is saying is while you AFK on your main, play on an alt instead.. and then it sounded like he took it further by saying when the alt gets stuck, create an additional alt.
---
Besides best item for raids is only 80m... it's not the t bow...
---
Hmm, would love a taste of those buns. Eyy.
---
Maybe try range them from a distance with mage pray and auto retaliate on and tell me again that theyre not afk lol..
---
What's the best way to get from 52-55 rc? I have never done fossil island is that the way to go?
---
&gt; directly causing the power creep
---
if the high levels are the ones directly causing powercreep, how come you want a new BIS helm to come from a mid-level afkable slayer task?
---
thats objective power creep from content the high levels dont want, so how is it their fault?
---
What is the best weapon to train strength XP with 70att and 65str?
---
What is the value for the upgraded Gmaul on pvp death?

Should of cropped out her hand, then put it on a layer in the same exact spot above the layer with the masks.

Whats the difference? Is a dark beast harder to kill? Not really

hey, fuck you guy.

Training crafting might be a good way to get alchables.
---
If I get a dfs for the galvek fight and die with it, but don‚Äôt lose it, will it still lose its charge? Or is that only if you drop it and need to recover it?
---
Yeah I'm not a fan of mobile other than afk skills because....well, I just dont like rs on the phone.
---
I mean it doesn't deserved the gold but definitely doesn't deserved 19 downvotes either, it is kinda funny but nothing to write home about
---
I like the idea of slayer but just don't enjoy doing it. Seems like I always get tasks that beat the shit out of me even with my current stats, and I end up losing more money keeping myself training than I make from the skill. Plus it seems like you don't even get to make much money on it until you've hit the much higher levels, and I just don't know how long it'll take me to get there with my patience being where it's at.
---
Damn, you know things are bad when you're saying positive things about blizzard entertainment.
---
3 hours per day? Need to at least get it up to 15-20
---
Name one thing you use the slayer helm before, besides a slayer task. I‚Äôve gone DAYS before getting certain tasks and I have 99 slayer so it‚Äôs nice to be able to farm some bosses off task. If you can name one thing you use the slayer helm for  besides a slayer task I‚Äôll give you fucking Reddit gold. My point of it being niche is you have to do it on task..
---
no
---
if you want to do the randoms do them, if you dont just dismiss or ignore them. nothing needs to be changed about them
---
Cant tell if sarcastic or not, but those things are terrible after the update.
---
What if it's the bot owners defending their bots?
---
The requirements are not low.
---
nah not at all. it's a different experience
---
I listen sometimes
---
So are tile markers a bannable offense? In the point it says features which tell you where to stand to avoid zulrahs attacks
---
ahh good, that makes me feel better
---
92 is half of 99.
---
Therefore, according to maths, 7 is half of 99.
---
Which puts me over half way to 99 runecrafting :')
---
Thank you! I plan on it!
---
No lol. 90% of reddit doesnt have a twitter.
---
Real talk why is rcb 61 range req
---
I wasn't considering builds, but the only scenario I can see where one build wouldn't fit all is with pures. Is there any other scenario?
---
I did Astral Runes, it's fairly afk and decent profit. But you need to complete Lunar Diplomacy.
---
Like the bots that exist and have like 55m exp in one skill and level 1 everything else that still exist?

I did this a while back. Maybe 2-4 hours

I changed my password, didn't kick them off my account, logged in later to see my bank cleared. and just this morning I login to find that my account has been banned for macroing, I guess whoever got on was using a bot to clear my bank. :/ I've sent in a support ticket

I really don't like the idea of the rewards being tradeable, maybe poll that aswell if the rewards pass.

Maybe if you spent less time on bad edits you would actually no longer be such a bad pker

not true

making the mob harder is going to make the drop more expensive, not sure how you're able to think like that.

The team is relatively small, and the company as a whole is not "massively" profitable. I'm also assuming you have never written code or work in game development, so I'm confused on how you are so sure they "just won't to do it" because they are "godshit" company. It's probably hard to be passionate about developing a game while having to deal with this kind of ignorance and bullshit on a daily basis.
---
Im still voting no
---
How long did it take for you to get to that point?
---
ü§£ that hurts
---
An hour and a half? Should be closer to 10 hours as that would give them enough time to figure out how often you get the drops or how many supplies are used or what the xp rate is. They would probably already do hour or so testing like that, no game company, however bad wouldn't have put less than an houe into its final or near final versions.
---
Would you look at the size of that rock hammer?!?!
---
So go ahead and delete the post then. That way people aren't blindly bitching about something all over twitter &amp; RS, when it's actually not even a real issue.
---
Before an update to how in combat status was treated being in combat used to keep you logged in for 6 hours before force logging the account off. Now its nerfed down to 20 mins
---
EFFICIENCY REEEEEEEEE
---
its bis for 10-20 def builds since its a rune full helm with no negative def and with positive mage/range attack
---
only using it on a slayer task doesnt make it niche when you shouldnt be doing things off task. 
---
name one thing you can do on task thats better to do off task?
---
I just realised how terrifying Zulrah would be....
---
What item??
---
What‚Äôs the pink potion next to your anti venom?
---
ye m8 99 fletching sure makes those slayer monsters 2 easy
---
I got vorki and vorkath's head on the same drop.
---
Shots fired!!!
---
Karamja diary rewards work differently than all the others though... look at the reward amounts for example.
---
Who do you think they'd rather oiss off more, 10% of the player base or 90%?
---
Thats ok üò•
---
I meant getting the most task points by winning, which isnt a good competition if every task is reasonable, of course there should be some ridiculous ones.
---
Get fucked lmao Jagex ruined them, without a polled changed might I add, today.
---
At 8x xp rate you could max a main with efficient methods in 10.4 full days. If you played 4 hours a day you would max in two months. 
---
When he inevitably reaches that stage he would complain there's nothing to do and move on to the next game.
---
There‚Äôs a simulator that lets you practice the flicking by using the animations. It‚Äôs RS3 jad but the switching is the same speed, but the mage attack animations is a little easier to see in the simulator. I just practiced that and hit the flicks correctly for 2 minutes in a row and felt confident after that.  It gets a little harder when the healers come but if you have a blowpipe just kill them one at a time so you don‚Äôt even have to worry about brewing or anything while fighting him.
---
This is one of few copy pastas that almost gets me lol.
---
Nope.
---
If you can't get people to help you, you can solo and scout the easy rooms and get to Olm easily, you just have to get into the Olm room.
---
What was the loot?
---
What is the ideal room layout?
---
Where are the kebbits? :o
---
I found the birds, the chinchompas, and the butterflies -- but no kebbits yet...
---
Can‚Äôt prepare the food if you can‚Äôt afford it
---
Which streamers wanted this buffed?
---
dope af
---
I've only gotten the Fishing one. I think you're just seeing patterns in random noise.
---
I like the idea but I dont think that every event should have a pet
---
Not really.... for being a venomous snake, funny how zulrah doesn't bite.
---
Not just pures, med levels, f2p only accounts.. iron men, hardcore iron men and if we want to get cheeky. Region locked accounts, your original comment honestly was very much the opposite of understanding. 
---
People like to play the game in so many different ways, it‚Äôs simply factual that 11$ for one character vs 7$ for unlimited characters. 
---
Provides the customer with far more freedom. 
---
We have a guy who literally won‚Äôt leave mortyania, imo an absolute madman and mental but I respect it. 
---
If he wants to play content outside of that he would have to pay 11$ for another account.. right, how is that comparable to free choice. 
---
Blizzard is a better company period and I don‚Äôt even like WoW
---
Is it imgurs fault for the garbage crop? I mean I was gonna scroll past it, assuming it was some nasty ass window dust drawing.   
---
I appreciate the license plate, but clean your fuckin' car, Zezima00245
---
Isn‚Äôt what lies below already a quest? I vaguely remember Bork from rs2
---
A mid-level account having access to a mid-level monster with some decent drops was fine. The possible helmet just shouldn't have been BIS.
---
I mean 1) maxing, 2) spirit trees, and 3) herb yield goes up with level
---
Good to know Konar assigns them.
---
Got mine back on Monday, welcome.
---
For the love of god can we stop making changes to the game?
---
Use to be able to guthans NMZ with certain quests done to get rotations where you wouldnt die with guthans healing. There was also the fact that you only needed to click once every 6 hours to stay clocked in.
---
S
---
I was literally about to say 6 hours isnt so bad
---
According to the Ironman Skilling Methods discord, 90 runecrafting is 'early game'. Crafting blood runes at 77 is considered 'very early game'. These people are actually off their fucking face on god knows what
---
I did just think about that lol... Still would be super terrifying
---
It‚Äôs also actually enjoyable to do
---
Yes I can make the comparison as 2500 brews aren't even relatively fucking close to the price of a tbow. The tbow is the one super rare and sought after drop from cox, the rest are meh. Kinda like the brews were with konar keys.
---
In 2 months.
---
His sleeves are sick are you kidding me?
---
This isn't an end game mob.
---
Quit fooling yourself.
---
Does adding a mechanic where you have to do the smallest amount of work to get a kill really deter you from pursuing a drop well over 30m? If so, I can see why you are mid level.
---
I mean you're not even half way at 77, pretty early on man
---
I have never made an obby tank but def and str at a low level would be really interesting. it's all about tick management, just like a gmaul pure. now you just have def, it sounds pretty good to be honest
---
Oh, even at my level it's possible to get through stages 2-4??
---
Nope. When you train thieving, the default left click option is ‚ÄòAttack‚Äô for the majority of pickpocketable NPCs that are also killable (men, guards, ardy knights etc.) by turning attack option to ‚Äòhidden‚Äô your default left click becomes to Pickpocket.
---
  
---
Afaik this option was made intentionally for Thieving.
---
50 comments a day is fucking nothing. You yourself just posted 32 comments in a 2 hour span lmfao. Literally the pot calling the kettle black.
---
And there are plenty of players who can't afford twisted bow or blowpipe, but we don't call msb bis do we?
---
Over halfway to 99
---
It took me about 3 weeks to save for a set of full addy and an addy long sword. I remember mining for hours and hours in the lumby swamp.
---
I eventually moved up to the falador mine and I died with my full addy to those damn scorpions. I was devestated.
---
When I became a member I remember buying an elemental shield from a guy for 10k. I don't know how much my bank was but I remember thinking DAMN that's expensive.
---
Also thought blue mystic was the coolest armour when I got to members and saved for it for agessssss.
---
Also, not me but I remember not long before I started playing - watching my cousin at castlewars in like 2004-2005 and he had a g maul and it must have been worth a couple 100k back then. Someone told him they'd give him 400k for it and they did the old... put up 400k and a heap of junk items then change the cash to 40k.
---
I swear he almost cried lol
---
Yeah it took me 1300 slayer points, 5 Basilisk tasks(from Vannaka), about 20 other tasks to fish for those Basilisk tasks, and I got the jaw on the tail end of my 5th task(roughly 230 Basilisks each task).
---
Around 1k kc for jaw on task for me
---
Won't happen, too many people with 99's, would never pass a poll, would be difficult too implement, etc
---
There are plenty of players who can't afford blowpipe or tbow but we don't call msb bis do we?
---
Demonics feel much better to kill than these.
---
This is essentially a non-question as history proves that they don't care about pissing off 90% of their fanbase.
---
You're right, sorry!!!
---
This guys gets it
---
weirdo, go outside
---
Solo nex was impossible till EoC. Duo was very hard but possible
---
DedWilson lmao
---
to be fair I feel like I didn't mind shit like agility and whatnot in rs2 but I can't bring myself to do it for more than a hour at a time now in osrs.
---
Doesnt making these rewards tradeable introduce rare items into osrs? (Like rs3 Santa hats and others) if these items are only obtainable once, during this league, most people haven't seemed to clue into this
---
TIL. 
---
Never would've thought of that. Thanks for the tip homie
---
Please point to me where I said it was nerfed "into the ground"? Oh wait, i never said that.
---
So we can say sgs btw.
---
F
---
finally roasting the elitist in the community
---
I feel like the easiest solution would be to be to let people escape but fill every dungeon and tile that isn't in zeah with dead man mode fog. Though I have no idea what the tools you guys work with are like, im assuming it's drag and drop.
---
Can we please move every good item to high level wildy raids? Not being immediately pk'd after finally getting a good drop really ruins the fun.
---
Do you ever come into this sub or are you just ignoring the several hundred posts over the years about how bad zulrah is for the game?
---
What the actual fuck
---
!redditsilver
---
its a mid level enemy bro
---
unless you're super lucky you're gonna be sitting there for a while since the drop seems like 1/1k or sumn like that off task
---
Max melee saves you far more time because tasks go faster. However this is only the case if you're an EHP Tryhard with tons of cash funding you.
---
How do people not see this obvious joke lol
---
Your correct, I stand corrected.
---
You said barrows gloves were never used
---
In rs3 you can get to 99 combats stats pretty quickly. Just gonna put that out there. By quickly I mean about 30 hours 1 to 99 probably? For like magic.
---
This game changed so much
---
If you have 82 magic, switch to lunars and craft mud runes. Use ring of dueling to castle wars, then take the balloon to varrock and you're right by the earth altar.
---
report these guys and dont give these racist fucks the time of day. funny how people get real brave behind a screen
---
Inb4 50/50
---
Is this only obtainable from the new game mode or will we be able to buy it in ge?
---
Do some math yourself
---
There is no point adding them in as mid-level content if they‚Äôd going to be this tough to kill and have a rare drop rate. Now they‚Äôll only be killed by players level 115+ and farmed for their 10M unique price, exactly like Demonic Gorillas.
---
Prior to the update, I could see all levels attempting to kill them and it would give mid-level players at around 100 combat a chance to make some money from something with a unique drop worth 1-3M. 
---
High-level players aren‚Äôt going to kill many Basilisks once the hype dies down, even on task. Mid-level players would (pre nerf).  Why ruin it for those players just for the high levelled players who are just going straight back to raids and bosses anyway once the hype is gone?
---
Run energy and prayer reduced. 
---
That place is fucking huge, and altars are limited.
---
Of course! 
---
Assuming my Zulrah bot doesn't get banned...
---
It's 1/800 on task 1/4k off task. It takes a few hours to get the drop lmao, it's literally one of the best items in the game. I already said I don't think the helm should come from a shit slayer monster but apparently that's too difficult to understand.
---
No.
---
It‚Äôs like 10 tasks of points you lost out on, harden the fuck up.
---
extended suqah is a must (cannon), same for nechys and smoke devils(barrage), can't help you with the block list though, not an expert on that one
---
If you're gonna play 2 accounts at the same time why wouldn't you just bond the league account from your main
---
Probably getting really unlucky. It happened before I mean. I'll keep testing
---
Probably dark altar devotion, no efficient way to train prayer otherwise. The run is tempting but it‚Äôs not the end of the world. And runes shouldn‚Äôt be a problem with the rune shop.
---
It's a trend with current game devs and most companies now to bend and give to the whim of a vocal minority.
---
Just turn them inside out on day 2 and cover up the smell with plenty of axe bodyspray.
---
magic
---
If you wanna max out your gains, Ditch the nez get obby helm, rock a berserker neck and use the obby sword instead.
---
Fuck the haters.
---
Hydro Flask gang.
---
Xzacts guide very in depth
---
For the first year of my account I was at 1:3 of time spent playing to the age of the account. It was a reality check for sure
---
theyre not changing them. its an optional recolor.
---
Sorry I meant bots that are scripted to pick up drops
---
Fisting is 300 bucks
---
Guess the theatre of blood is a click and wait thing too right?
---
Almost entire list if not an ironman: money.
---
Dang, that's reasonable though I guess.
---
and a plethora of successful titles they have, compared to the 1 that Jagex has.
---
You not working or barely working and having 0 social life does not mean that the game should become a game that isn't fun where everything is a grind that panders to you. 
---
In all reality, both situations are unrealistic. But the game should be built around the average player. If I had to guess, that's people who 20-35 who work 40 hour work weeks like a normal person. If you cater the game to the minority who spend more time in one day than the average does in a week, the game will die.
---
Just to add on, if things getting easier or better rates lowers your sense of achievement, just don't fucking do it that way? It's like complaining that someone like a youtuber who makes a shit ton of money for little to no work takes away your sense of achievement as a lawyer. It's just a poor argument.
---
hes consistently top viewed channel and by a wide margin too when hes online so not for most ppl i guess
---
This is dumb, they're legit a tipoff@jagex email thats used for shit like this.
---
Who said that? I‚Äôm probably the most popular dude on tinder in my city. Bet you‚Äôre still a virgin üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Cause minions follow bosses. And pets are pets
---
They made the abyssal whip from Runescape into the real thing! Wow!
---
Well and it isn't like Isles was a massive step up from zerker in terms of reqs anyways. Honestly, Faceguard is a perfect transition from that perspective. The game just may have changed too much around it for the HLC to accept that.
---
sounds fun
---
How much dick did you think he had to suck from the councilors?
---
Amazing post
---
I didn‚Äôt say he was bitching about losing a duel.
---
I said he had issues that were out of his and Jagex‚Äô control at the time.
---
If his account was hacked, he should have used an authenticator, or taken better precautions to prevent it from happening.
---
You‚Äôre the imbecile for not being able to read and interpret language...
---
Literally a friend
---
To support streamers you like lol
---
As a f2p player i would love this but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be a good idea.
---
read the updates on the dev blog- DagonHai is giganerfed
---
The to 45 defense requirement nerf right?
---
I will physically slam dunk a basketball on you twat.
---
Wow crazy how you refer to this as scribbles! POG
---
Thanks so much for putting it on the backlog! Seriously so hyped for this.
---
It did make them easier. I don't like that it's gone tbh, but I can see why.
---
r u retarded, hes always the most viewed/subbed twitch streamer while hes online. U can not be a fan of his content but u cant straight up deny facts.
---
I was just wondering if someone who voted no to questions 1 and/or 2 could explain to me their reasons why? 
---
Seems like a pretty minor but helpful QoL change, with no ramifications for gameplay. I can't believe 5,000 people would vote no sure out of spite?
---
Bro you‚Äôre the one posting on reddit for relationship advice, I highly doubt you‚Äôre extremely popular on tinder lol. 
---
&gt;	Bet you‚Äôre still a virgin üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Lol no wonder she broke up with you, literally a man child
---
People use the msb too but we don't pretend it's bis
---
Nope, only started playing a few months ago as f2p and easily bought bonds with gp from there. First one was a bit of a grind, but after that i just followed the news articles, bot and youtuber/twitch drama. You can guess which items are affected by all that and easily profit enough gp for bonds from that. It's the same in any game with an "auction house".
---
Nah, you'll have to get a new kitten from old lady Gerty
---
$11
---
To what jagex said in their statement : dont do bad shit
---
So what is bad shit?
---
The 1:1 click ration should be held. If you don't use menu switchers or bots you should be good.
---
What is the 1:1? If you do 1 click, 1 action should be performed. OSbuddy got users banned because jagex saw them do 1:8, 8 actions in one click. runelite doesnt have any of those.
---
are you shitting me
---
You pretty much use up the whole restore venging tekton. If you bring 2 brews max then you could have 1 dose of restore left and bring that instead of picking up the revitalization potion, so you could do that. Though personally I venge as much as I can, even venging my hp down at ice demon below his max hit just to go as fast as I can, so having only 1 sanfew dose means that if I mess up and die at shamans (I often times go in with like 10 hp or something so even the purple spawns can kill me if I'm not careful) it's basically a wipe as they'll poison me as soon as I come back, potentially killing me with poison damage again before I even kill them.
---
For people who bring less switches and have more room it could be more viable though. Although low defence on the jaw helm is gonna really hurt during mutta especially, as well as olm, tight ropes, and vanguards, so overall it's still not worth it I'd say, it gives no new max hits to scythe and a +1 to lance in some gear setups. Though for ironmen it'll be real useful, as anything that saves them scales is worth going out of their way to make it work.
---
Protip : block basilisks
---
OUCH!
---
Definitely not when you factor in the jaw.
---
Prop for a movie if anyone wondering
---
It‚Äôs a movie prop..smh
---
You really A Friended that joke up
---
Nothing worse than trying to do RFD with a kitten... You have my sympathy
---
Bitch ass elvarg got stabbed ez by me in like 5min. Thats a dragonkin early attempt HA! Dumb super dragons are no match for my me
---
I love that anime.
---
With that much money you can buy your self every coloured pet cat
---
because low combat with money = RWT in their eyes
---
Those have been there forever
---
Funny that even with the help of runelite they were still tedious af.
---
40 defence* so I assume you didn't read that the mage bonuses were also lowered.
---
All quests are mid lvl
---
Me at 2am with a box of chicken nuggets
---
Insane
---
Ah it was from 70 to 45 I guess it went down to 40 with mage bonus nerfs then. Ok hype that's a good fix.
---
I pretty much play everything. I just feel like osrs has potential to be amazing. Idk maybe after getting max cape 2 years ago I have a special hats for skilling.
---
You know what. I actually really like this idea, it may get me back into rs just for fun game modes.
---
Thanks for saying guys and girls. It‚Äôs nice to feel included sometimes.
---
Oh I died like that once on a HCIM! I didn't know there were moss giants there because on my regular ironman I was already fairly high in stats by the time I roamed around that are for the first time (did F2P first) so I didn't think there were any threats for level 3 accounts there.
---
I only play my regular ironman now. It's too scary thinking about all those small things around the world that can kill you when you're a low level. I forgot about all of them because there's no penalty for death on other account types.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a random boss added now that would take hundreds of people killing it for a bit of a laff
---
either the accumulator or the run/prayer reduction depending on what gear they announce as being attainable
---
Yes there is....  
---
Trying to get +5 cons boost spice with kitten.
---
You know how you‚Äôre able to buy those items right
---
emily
---
yeah 
---
really says alot that while the game is overun by venezuelans 
---
and bots
---
jagex does stupid shit like this
---
or go after runelite plugins
---
unprofessional morons
---
Honestly the qol ones are the ones I'm sad about, like single click logs and construction that legit just makes sense I can understand how black jacking could be seen as op but thriving is a stupid skill like you if your not gonna single click black jacking with osbuddy your gonna single click stalls or ardy knights like there's no difference
---
This is exactly the reason I don't go to nerdy conventions. Those people have 0 concept of hygiene.
---
Dont listen to that guy, only certain addons are not allowed and runelite removed them
---
To be exact. 18 months.
---
Yet I can guarantee you still pay money to corporations who tax evade and do all the shit you literally just listed.
---
&gt;most of the wilderness "revitalizations" haven't been truly PvP focused.
---
Correct. They have been focused on rewarding Pkers, however, and still don't work. 
---
&gt;are you implying an entire facet and community of players should just be left behind because you think it's "dead content"?
---
I think Wilderness updates should be dropped as a concept with PvP focus being placed elsewhere. I don't think PvP should be removed as a whole, but "fixing" the Wilderness is going to take more time and resources than I think should be given to it, simply because the core design is flawed. 
---
&gt;OSRS isn't too big to fail and amputating groups of players like that is a good way to go about it.
---
It's clearly not a very large group of players if the content itself is dead, though. You can't have it both ways - either PvP is active and the amount of players interacting with it is significant, or it's dying like everyone whines about.
---
I actually watched the whole thing, what a beautiful way to spend 2 mins of my life. I only wish there were more
---
40 hours 5 days a week and we might even compensate them for their time
---
No, but I definitely had to put in the time to get the drop, both on and off task. I got the jae off task.
---
I messaged a mod about their being so reactive to the loud 1% after new content. Hopefully they I will stop looking at Twitter lol.
---
Smithing bot
---
Right but by that argument Faceguard is niche because it's ONLY FOR MELEE. And slayer helm ISNT and WORKS FOR MAGE AND RANGE.
---
Youre definition of niche is too vague. Yes you use it for slayer tasks.. you also use it for combat. Does that mean its a niche item? No. It serves a wide purpose across all different styles of combat against every type of monster bar a few.
---
Whereas faceguard, in a bis environment, is useful in very few places (Cox, ToB, corp, pking if you wanna risk 20m+).
---
So yes, you have to be on a slayer task to take advantage of a slayer helm. But the fact that your task can cover a whole wide variety of monsters and bosses, and let you range mage or melee, is not what I'd call niche.
---
A stab weapon that's good against only dragons like a dh lance, that's a niche weapon. It's garbage against anything but dragons and easily gets beat out by much cheaper and easier to obtain weapons. And it's only for melee. So its niche.
---
I wouldn't even define faceguard as niche. But in the context of a bis helm, faceguards usages as bis are more niche than slayer helm. As to be killing bosses / mobs efficiently you're doing so on task, despite you saying because you don't do that that argument isn't valid.

Also I tried earlier and in full tank gear at 98 defence i was still taking a lot more damage than before
---
View count dropped when classic came out
---
Is this going to be a one time thing? If the rewards are exclusive and not obtainable after these two months, couldn't they end up like rares in the original RS?
---
Many people will skip metal dragons because they are a drag. I‚Äôd recommend getting a black mask/slayer helm ASAP and getting it imbued too.
---
LMFAO if you think it's sweaty you haven't been to it since buff. Almost exactly the same. 400 kc since buff on task ezzzz
---
Oh shit only 1.6 million nats to 99
---
Wut
---
leagues shouldnt have any rewards in the main game
---
I'd prefer cosmetics like the baguette over pets.
---
Indeed, it's easy to look back on hcim deaths and decry them as stupid, but it's surprisingly easy to die in RuneScape if you don't think carefully about your actions. HCIM is surprisingly skillful gameplay.
---
I feel ya
---
Ah.. the old "I don't know what's going on" routine. 
---
Classic.
---
This having to be posted says a lot about our community
---
This is beyond stupid. Time is a resource that has a value, which these all take. Admittedly torso is a very short grind for the benefits it reaps, but even in that case there are STILL players who cba to get it.
---
*sloppy seconds
---
The concept is the problem. Why give bis drops to such simple mobs. Then the overbuff due to it not being a good place for the drop fullstop.
---
when you compare it to the price of it's competitor, you would have over 300k dragon darts to work with.
---
Huh TIL
---
Yeah in the short term. Demand decreases while supply decreases, regardless. I.e. it will drop
---
So its confirmed
---
Just got my elite void! My melee stats are at base 75 with mage/range at 85+.
---
I‚Äôm pretty poor equipment wise but do have anguish/torture. What are some good mobs/bosses to fight with elite?
---
So you‚Äôre one of the dickheads that cause this
---
I want it to be a super simple game.
---
If I wanted engaging combat I'd play something else.
---
What about the metalic dragons in the catacombs?
---
A
---
&gt;Ok  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\- Jagex
---
Can't argue with that proof.
---
Nice.
---
and also give him 250k for that damn puzzle
---
The blog says you will start with dragon slayer and a few other quests already completed.
---
exactly why it needed to be removed, it's supposed to be a high skill high reward area, not something anyone can do because of a plugin.
---
I don't think he was joking in the manner you think he was.
---
support
---
You mean pre eoc nex where even a current jmod got hundreds of kills with just a bow
---
Well you did a great job! It looks phenomenal and now I‚Äôm super excited about the possibility of cooler slayer helms!
---
How were they "fun" lmao. Before the update you clicked them and waited for them to die. Literally no different than fighting a goblin. It's about as boring of a fight as you could get.
---
For you it's Jad
---
Using dragon sword, I keep putting off MM since I usually play AFK while studying. I plan on doing it and fremenik isles soon. 
---
Also any tips on getting fighter torso? I sat in barbarian assault for half hour waiting to join and couldn‚Äôt get a team. 
---
The task is only 10 Bronze dragons and I‚Äôm 4 in so I‚Äôll pump it with a lot of sharks I suppose.
---
Bro are u high
---
I don't know if its actually worth explaining why so much of what you said is flawed or over-simplified.
---
I'm pretty sure its very easy to read what you said and know that you're missing the point, for what seems on purpose.
---
Considering unsired is 1/100. You lucky.

The ignorance of your own words are lost on you, humility is the last thing you deserve when you show little yourself.

The amount of effort for a guthans heal is just not worth it

Just run back to the bank and get some food

Oh god get a life please.

I like this idea and will not make me look bad for doing non xp related randoms.
---
My favorite is the balloon animal :)
---
Maybe try Turael boosting? 9 quick tasks at Turael, every 10th at Konar or Duradel for pretty easy points. Turael might even give you basilisks, iirc.
---
One of the starting relics is a x4 to prayer. A mod said somewhere that it is multiplicative, so it would be a total of x12.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not being subjective and saying ‚Äúthis is why he‚Äôs good for everyone.‚Äù I‚Äôm pointing out the ways that make him unique from other streamers and why some people might choose to watch him

Extremely

I mean, they could bring back DMM as it's own league. Same with KOTS
---
Did he bring his own shoes and bowling ball?
---
It requires a chanpion scroll yet ur complaining about mimc? Ok...
---
It‚Äôs been said a million times in this sub already, but also worth mentioning that black mask, which is BiS for literally anything on slayer task comes from cave horrors, which realistically you could probably kill with a wily cat.
---

These actually look cool as fuck.

Good job

Its worse than a fucking acb in basically wvery single place ur a dumbass

Helmet 'feels' like 31.7kg. Reality: you got a weakass neck
---
Interestingly enough since the precedent has been set about game-modes not needing to pass a vote, all we really need to do is convince the mod team that this is beneficial. Just thought I'd remind you so you have some ammo with your next tweet about VOSRS.
---
Brilliant marketing. He even mentioned his shirt got him killed.
---
Fuk.
---
It hasn‚Äôt changed.
---
Over half way! 49.5 is half of 99
---
Because you're not chasing mil after mil. You dont have the pressure that comes with a main account
---
It would've looked way cooler with the original Armadyl set pre-2017.
---
No, during swamp league the give him a crown and make him king.
---
Genius
---
Or play the game the way you want? Just because the most efficient thing for a main is to grind money, doesn't mean you have to.
---
it wasnt just the safespots that were afk? put on protect from magic and you were set. You could argue that whip and other good BiS items also came from shitty as monsters, but that doesn't mean thats good game design and that we should continue.
---
The osrs community has given up on fun everything needs to be min/max and end game
---
i too am suicidal.                                                                                       \[/s\]
---
Does your iron man need every cosmetic in the game?
---
Yea not a big fan of pet scape
---
I'd say fighter torso is mid level and it was BiS at some point right?
---
Probably the best thing at the start. You can always unlock runes/ammo later
---
You don't want a genie pet?
---
This feels extremely unfair that it wasn't polled. Especially since the people who cried to get this on Twitter are the same people who alt spammed "no" to Warding

I am all for banning the seller, as well as the buyer.
---
I have never once PKed on OSRS, and have never once voted on a PVP related poll. IMO if you have less than a certain number of PK kills or PK activity you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to vote on PVP related polls. Of course if it is introducing items or other mechanics that would impact anything outside of PVP, all bets are off and everyone should be able to vote.
---
I think people spite voting against each other is a good way to expedite players losing interest and eventually the death of RuneScape. We all play and love the same game, it is a shame that some want to force each other out of it.
---
ok dont play it then? does w45 dmm existing hurt you? why would this
---
Thanks

sounds like what sea shanty would sound like if it was background music to the ship crew playing on the deck

---
Thankyou for taking the effort to make such a detailed post.
---
*furiously takes notes*
---
How long did barb fishing 58-99 take you?
---
http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/top100
---
Here's a list of the top traded items, a good place to start to get an idea :)
---
But the drop is different - you cant compare a bis helmet to a dark bow.
---
It's an item to add to a bad drop table and it has no defence for being iconic like the black mask as it's new. Especially because new end game content is suffering from a lack of ideas as far as rewards are concerned. It's as if they put a primordial crystal on the Aberrant Spectres drop table. Very bad game design. The quest boss was also stupidly easy and looked incomplete. I had no difficulties completing it on a level 90 ironman. Is this their barrier to entry to BIS items?
---
Depends on who you ask man. Out of your list apple and hp are the only ones I'd avoid.
---
You seen him recently? Absolute unit, it killed his focus.
---
I'd also like to watch youtube or twitch streams, or have the wiki open, though I know Chrome just devours ram and I'm likely looking at 4gigs of it given my budget. I'm fine with having it closed while I play though.
---
Is there any kind of clock speed you'd suggest? I see a number of dual core and quad core ones with varying speeds, and it likes like some of the dual core ones are faster, but I'm really not 100% savvy.
---
Most laptop manufacturers source all their components from the same suppliers, don't listen to people who buy by brands, especially when it  comes to prebuilt computers.
---
It answers your question fully, he explains how tasks are nearly impossible WITH scouts, implying scouts give an unfair advantage to begin with.  And that without them you might as well not be bothering, sorry you need ot have things dumbed down for you.
---
Your mom
---
Basilisk knight - 60 slayer 
---
Dark beast - level 90 slayer
---
See the difference?:
---
So I hear people on all that, but at he same time it‚Äôs locked behind quest reqs and 55 rc which is a pretty big turn off for a lot of people (not that it‚Äôs hard) but aside from all that, my post is about how it feels while worn.
---
That's probably the safest bet. Hopefully I gave you something to think about though.
---
If rewards are put on castle wars, people will just afk it or boost it.
---
Yea honestly I thought they were fine before but just needed the range safe spots gone. The safe spots allowed people to camp there indefinitely since they didn‚Äôt even need to protect from magic.
---
Negative. One should do for the whole weekend.
---
your entire argument is stupid as fuck. It's an extremely minimal difference. It wasn't a "nerf" It was a rebalance. OBVIOUSLY the numbers cant be LITERALLY the exact same as before. it's an RNG table with multiple different loot drops.
---
They didnt sit down and go "damn this is giving players too much money we should reduce it"
---
Does that mean you get the drop then? Or does it show up in collection log as long as you did damage
---
is there a rough ETA on when we can expect the first league?
---
And the maxed osrs players
---
Nice congrats :)
---
yeah i shouldnt go to the doctor to get stuff checked out. im going to go with the fat fuck waiting by the bus station nearby. they clearly know better
---
&gt; Black mask becomes non-tradable when you make a slayer mask.
---
Okay? Why do you think this matters? 
---
Just disassemble the helm if you want the mask back. 
---
&gt; rangers are an extremely rare drop from a medium clue (which are one of the more uncommon ones to find, you get a shit ton of hard clues from slayer but you need to specifically seek out meds)
---
1/200 to 1/350 is not what I'd call 'extremely rare.' It's rare a rare drop from a clue, but it's not an 'extremely rare' drop from a clue. 
---
It's rarity ties in to how you can't farm medium clues at a fast rate, so I'll give on why that one's not yet alch value. 
---
&gt; Everything else is from a literal fucking boss.
---
Since when did Demonic Gorillas become a boss?
---
Wonder how many people asked her "What are you supposed to be?"
---
&gt; splashing
---
wait thats gone to now ?
---
Question: where do I put the deodorant?
---
Disclaimer: I'm still under 18, so unlike the 25 year old I at least have a slight excuse.
---
go back to playing the game for fun, nerd
---
Random events need a huge rework, maybe a token system where each event you complete gives you a token and you can buy untradeable cosmetics with them. Like the frog random on a larger scale
---
Boi id say go buy lotto but you just used all that luck up
---
implying pkers also dont vote no
---
Run while you still can
---
A really stupid point that is... Have you ever done bossing on mobile too?
---
Implement these please!!
---
"How is my clearly correct opinion not everyone else fact?!" - You
---
Adamant darts unless what you're doing is above 3m an hour.
---
Eh, demonics have a indirect slayer req of 69 non boostable via needing mm2. Your other points still stand however they're noticeably more engaging and reward skilled players that know how to work the  switches. Where as the knights it was stand there and eat or safespot indefinitely.
---
It's actually a recoloured zamorak brew. I used photoshop's eyedropper tool to match the the light part of the liquid to the lighter red of the zamorak symbol and the dark part of the liquid to the dark part of the zamorak symbol.
---
The purple potion is just a regular antifire potion.
---
I agree they don't look as good when they aren't colour matched, which is why I made the zamorak potion red.
---
https://i.imgur.com/x2sw6Ai.png This is how it looks with the zamorak symbol on top of a zamorak brew.
---
The announced Warding last year. That didn't pass a poll. No Warding. 
---
It's easy to hear the voices of a few outspoken people and think things are worse than they really are.
---
I wouldn't worry. 
---
P.S. Yet.
---
Kc...
---
I‚Äôm so confused ....
---
all superior variant looks dope in my opinion.
---
personal favourite is probably nechryarch, that monstrosity looks absolutely terrifying when spawns
---
I like that they made them harder.
---
They're were way too easy for a monster that drops a BIS helm. The slayer requirement should probably be higher, though.
---
Raids 3 and menaphos, or something out that way, calling it now.
---
Void...?
---
Thousands *
---
As I got 214 task. Damn.
---
Honestly just treat it like farming, get a 10k exp drop every week via tears of guthix. Forces you to train other skills too though.
---
This. I'm only like 65 slayer, I spent all of my points unlocking them, and extending them, and now the task is trash. Actually peeved that I spent my points on something that was supposed to be great for my levels and they just changed it without polling to be terrible for me.
---
Don't sugar coat it. These people are grown adults and should know by now that it's important to take care of yourself. 
---
If you don't shower, if you reek, and if you can't be bothered to do it by default at this point in your life, you should be ashamed and embarrassed. 
---
There isn't room for being kind about it. This should be EXPECTED of all adults, and if you aren't already doing it, start. There really isn't an excuse.
---
This is stuff that should be learned in school as a child. It's basic. Keep up, you smelly bastards.
---
&gt; I gotta disagree with this. gorillas are super easy once you get the hang of it.
---
They aren't *super hard.* I never said they were. 
---
But they require pretty *constant focus.* If you don't pay attention, you'll die. 
---
&gt; Even without zenyte drops I can average anywhere from 500-900k a trip.
---
Without taking into account scales, potions, and food, you only average 23k a kill without a zenny. 
---
That's very low-tier loot compared to other methods you should have available to you. 
---
That's a good thing. Most of their value is tied up in their rare drop. 
---
+1 good design. 
---
I can agree that bask knights shouldn't be 4.3k a kill, tbh. Maybe 10k a kill, ignoring drops, or maybe a little higher given their buff.
---
Awesome
---
is that a  corsair k63 keyboard?
---
There's a bunch of mid game content already.
---
And a BIS helm you should kill monsters that can't just be semi afked.
---
Why would you make the cosmetics tradeable???????
---
Holy shit you are still active here
---
People on this sub complain about not being able to play the game as much. Because of this they want the game to be easier so they can accomplish more in the short amount of time they play
---
Used to be pretty common when soul wars was a thing.
---
Couple of hours of BA max? Not sure what you're getting at. It's a very cheaply gotten item that is bis for a vast majority of med level melee. But there's still a significant amount of players who can't even be bothered to get it.
---
Wow, very faithful
---
because the content is less than a week old and it's not uncommon for them to change new content
---
Streamers are all really boring
---
I‚Äôm 60dry of anything
---
why

Level 121 with 56 rc. I would have base 70 without rc :D

Thank you.

I hated that plugin.

Look up what the pyrelord looks like.
---
I tried that. It ended up working after I created my character on mobile and then used my pc for the rest
---
Reminds me of the woman from woman yelling at a cat meme lmao
---
bunch of noobs wasting exp
---
If you don't pay 100% attenion all the time, it's easy to take damage
---
They don‚Äôt drop their head in that dungeon because the crystal shards replaced that tertiary drop on their tables.
---
People do pvm outside of task?
---
I enjoyed the full explanation, followed by the wrong number though
---
Stop using slayer requirement as a form of difficulty measurement.
---
Skeletal wyverns are harder than gargoyles.
---
Cerb is harder than thermy.
---
Abyssal sire is harder than kraken.
---
Drakes are harder than abyssal demons.
---
Ancient wyverns (72) are harder than smoke devils despite it being 93 slayer and the 2nd highest slayer level mob.
---
Slayer level does not indicate difficulty.
---
There's a reason they all have music playing while they stream, they aren't entertaining enough on their own to keep people around
---
Lol are you all joking?
---
Client needs fixing, bots are over running the game... Game modes are being released?
---
Doesn't anyone even care or it everything fine as long as new content is released once per month?
---
Previous bis helmet was 4.5m and required a constant cost to use it.
---
dark bow is a mad strong pvp weapon I've clapped cheeks with it
---
Yeah... as if they are trying to be passionate about it lmao. Literally 0 customer support. Oh wow, super passionate. Literally firing staff left and right.. Mmm.. I can feel the passion. Willing to spend absolutely 0 money on the team.. Ahh the passion.
---
Fucking morons.
---
Good some fucking good finally
---
Spoken like sometime who hasn't killed one post update with auto retaliate on. The task is more afk than before.
---
theres no evidence thats true, most tertiary drops can be gotten in the same kill, i.e clues and long bones, visage and dragon limbs, kq head and jar of sand,
---
Even if 70% of the player base was venezuelans or bots osrs would still have a higher player count than rs3
---
Nah, the Serp was only BIS in a very few situations. I was talking about the OG Nezzy.
---
The concept of Artisan applies to Slayer too lol cmon you cant see that?
---
For real what a joke! Seems people just want new content constantly. Nothing else matters.
---
Well these leagues only last a certain amount of time so I highly doubt anyone is going to max. I'd be surprised if the leagues stay up for as long as it would take someone to max with 100% efficiency without the Zeah restriction.
---
Abyssal whip isnt bis. Putting a bis item behind something so weak was silly, but in saying that the buff was also dumb and they should have just developed better content in the first place.
---
The weapons were worse than the current available weapons, lul.
---
It is suggested on that discord to keep bloods for barraging so yeah that is true.
---
No.... serp our did it everywhere.. not sure what your on about but anyways. 
---
Only place nez was really used was pking because of the low risk.
---
Agreed, made a post about the sane thing.
---
THESE ARE SO COOL
---
I agree, it looks like they needed to come up with something really fast. They used some leftover horns to glue onto it.
---
haha aress3 I mean runecraft bad!!
---
I think some people still have them, if you know who to ask.
---
You must be really dense.
---
People aren't complaining about any potential increase in "supply costs" or whatever, even if that is one of the drawbacks. No, people are wondering why the vocal minority of neets thought that buffing a low/mid level slayer monster, making even non extended tasks take hours, was a good idea.
---
Let a rare drop be a rare drop for christ's sake. Besides, anyone saying a BIS shouldn't be "easy to obtain" are conveniently forgetting the fact that they got their black masks quite early on, and that many other BIS are just quest rewards.
---
That‚Äôs what happens when the pvp community is toxic..I tried getting into pvp by playing Lms, to be barraged with ‚Äúsit, your bad, cya.‚Äù Then when it comes to pvp updates they act nice to get some votes.
---
The color combination make it look futuristic, not really medieval... That‚Äôs a shame imo
---
Why are you downvoted, youre right lol
---
I‚Äôd love this, since I always skip ransoms since they are kinda useless, if there was however a minute chance of something like a pet, I‚Äôd certainly do it
---
that's what we call a password
---
You're absolutely correct. Abyssal Demons should not be this easy to kill when they require 85 Slayer. Buff the too-easy, 100%-AFK monsters.
---
Yeah sure, they watch the clip have a laugh maybe pop into his stream to make a comment then they leave to go watch a streamer doing high level pvm or something.
---
Watching him do wintertodt, blackjacking, and 3tg fishing on repeat is not good content for his channel and his average viewer count has suffered since his first big death
---
passwords aren't case sensitive
---
passwords have a limit of 20 characters
---
you are allowed to make dumb ass passwords like 123456. Good websites force you to combine your password with letters, numbers and symbols
---
Just to name a few that they can at least work on, there is no reason to not have these basic things
---
This is such an accurate rendition!! I love it
---
So all I have to do to get a new skill is loudly bitch on twitter?
---
Well, yeah, halfway to 57.
---
I think the format is great, it‚Äôs cool to see people bring different styles of presenting information to the table. Perhaps it‚Äôs less accessible than a lot of what gets the focus around here but I like that it‚Äôs a part of our conversation now.
---
i respect your opinion and i believe they could come from somewhere better, but what about the 75%+ of players that voted yes to it?
---
That's an awesome idea!
---
Doesn't fit since every pet is grindable, while this isn't
---
Fair, but understanding the outcome before live is important as it stops things going haywire on release
---
I just hope the rewards wont be locked to per league, id rather not be permanently locked out of some cosmetics because I didnt get enough points for all of them during X league, as an ironman
---
Gonna tack on amalayse/MoG to make stamina's? No rooftops in kourend right?
---
Lmaooo I was about 100% sure you were joking based off the second comment. I thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no fucking way‚Äù. 
---
Thanks for giving me hope.
---
Then you don't also get the privilege to play end-game content designed for those who do play more often.
---
Any type of con has this issue. Twitchcon and the likes. It's gross.
---
Looks like the banshee is playing its mixed tape..
---
i mean, thats how you get rich. if you go even on every task, you cant really make anything can you
---
Proof that nostalgia never dies
---
honestly i‚Äôm probably in the very small minority that i believe they should‚Äôve kept the basilisk knights untouched but made the drop rarer than it is now. i know it‚Äôs already super rare but i‚Äôd rather have it be 1/3000 on task and 1/5000 off task. would keep the value of it up while still not being a trash task.
---
!remindme 60 days 
---
We'll stick a pin in this comment and see how it ages üòÇ
---
Could someone please tell me where he‚Äôs training? Recently returned to the game and made an Ironman and I‚Äôve been doing lava drags for some magic, prayer exp and some income. I can‚Äôt keep up with all the updates since I‚Äôve been gone, wondering if there‚Äôs an Ironman clan out there...

Lmao
---
This helm is the main reason I'm gonna actually try in leagues. This thing looks sick and I need it in my life
---
I don't use twitter or twitch so I never heard any complaints about the difficulty. I almost always love game updates, but this one was a very unpleasant surprise.
---
&gt;You're the one arguing graceful isnt worth it
---
I‚Äôm literally not.
---
You got enough bolts ?
---
U wunnah dem tahrtoes?
---
Still 2 dead games.
---
Modifying it removes the challenge lol, why not just play a regular account
---
That only goes for the sweaty hardcore nerds like Twitter users and the 10% of redditors.
---
I believe it‚Äôs a popular opinion than damage&gt;defence. Therefore obsidian armour over dragon.
---
I would go full obsidian, if you can afford it with the berserker necklace and obby sword- highest dps for your level until you hit 65 att and str (or 130 total) then get that dragon defender.
---
This is why I've already left and I'm back to Destiny.  This shit ain't fun, especially with a bunch of psychopaths that hate themselves calling the shots.  Ya'll have no idea what you actually want, why the hell are you guys voting and having a say in actual development.  Stick to polls about monetization, but content shouldn't be in the hands of the players.
---
Agreed.
---
Woox tested it and said it was easy Kappa
---
DDoSing hasn't been an issue since Jed got fired but it will forever be used as an excuse to not revert because this sub is just a bunch of losers who want no risk, afk 5 accounts at once scape.
---
Sorry for flexing I'm just shook by the Lost Lands X OSRS crossover hahaha
---
I'm a dubstep producer from the UK going by the name Jarvis, been around for a long time, got semi successful but didnt really blow up huge, kinda quit a few weeks ago and now excision starts supporting got me all confused üòï
---
This is really beautiful. You are super talented, this art style is amazing! I hope we get more content from you in the future.
---
Rune cbow can be made there, steel/iron dragons drop the limbs. The best magic weapon will *probably* be a slayer staff unless they add Ibans/Seas to some sort of store or relic thing.
---
Alright, Ill bite.
---
Whens the last time you just felt like killing something, and how long did that sentiment last?
---
You can Slayer ring to Nieve or Slayer tower (bonus xp here with Mory diary) to do the same pray restore method just as quickly
---
It seems like it won't be polled just judging by reading the blog post? It seems the poll question will be something like "should these rewards be added as described in the blog?". And in the blog it clearly says they will be traceable. I think it's a mistake honestly because they are really cool items but they should be about flexing your leagues points IMO and if they are buyable it just defeats the whole purpose.
---
The desperation of you people has no limits
---
So again, what the fuck is the point of polls?
---
I think you'd love Rs3
---
You're welcome
---
mom?
---
go to rs3 if u want huge xp rates
---
Thanks for the entertainment reading this brain dead reply it provides some good entertainment. You are extremely delusional if you think the way you've spoken to me is appropriate because I said "don't let the door hit you on the way out".
---
Go back to sucking on your momma's titties because you need some nutrients to make that tiny, low IQ brain grow. Good luck on those very difficult puzzles that I was completing in a couple of mins as a child ü§£
---
Whatever you say dude, no point arguing with someone that spends their majority of their time on reddit or being awful at TFT
---
The game came back with the promise of polled content. The whole idea of choice is basically a lie if they make critical changes without polled feedback.
---
What do you mean "as if"?
---
I support this
---
Not sure how much of a brainlet you have to be to say that something that the makers of the game has **specifically** asked players not to do isn't cheating.
---
Someone must know the rates.
---
They are afraid of bans. If they were honest they would remove meny entry swapper to. But people would shit them selfs without it.
---
This belongs in a museum, this inspired so many great memes
---
&gt;Also i'd say regicide is harder than the new fremennik quest
---
I agree but Id like to mention a devils advocate argument; the RC requirement is probably a bigger obstacle than anything else in those 2 quests for most people and you actually need to do the quest to be able to wear the new nezzie while you can buy serp without doing regicide.
---
Given that you've probably 'called' the pet on half your kills about 50% that you would 'call' it.
---
Yeah no point except saying it has a point and making their game appeal to more people. Basilisk change was pointless haha to many virgins that want 800+ hour content for +1 strength bonus
---
A lot of monsters use 2 or 3 attack styles randomly and some can hit through prayer.
---
It makes me so happy seeing you guys already coming up with ideas like this for future leagues. Really cool concept, thanks for the suggestion!
---
They should've been level 90+, just poor design all around
---
Say I was to start playing the league on my main, but after an amount of time wanted to swap back to old school, would that be possible? Or would I have to wait for the league to end.
---
Jagex catered to neck beards again.
---
Hmm weird how it wasn't a problem for months and then neckbeards got uppity about it and boom problem.
---
You can easily do zulrah at 80+ combat stats
---
ITT: people falling for the most obvious bait ever
---
While i do think these were a bit too easy previously, I would say this   update puts them in bullshit territory. If they had their drop table buffed to give them supplies like food/prayer pots then fair enough, but as it is I can only kill about 10 per trip max. These are way harder than their 60 slayer requirement would suggest and either they should nerf them back to how they were, or increase the slayer level required to kill them and buff their drop table.
---
Way to late for that, but I can probably manage to make a sketchy banner to carry around
---
CliEnTs tHaT mAkE tHe GaMe lEsS timE coNsuMiNg bAd

Damn. Guess I'll have to cash out to turn it back into gp
---
and then bitches he has nothing to do instead of progressing account further, go play destiny or something if you want casual
---
I absolutely think it‚Äôs appropriate for a handful of BIS items to be obtainable by med levels. And I don‚Äôt think the fact that high lvls can spam through med levels is a reason to not give med levels content, that would be horrible game design. In 2007, the neit was BIS obtained by a quest, and you could get the BIS dragon defender at 65 attack and str. Med levels being able to obtain a few items they take into late game was a core concept of the game in 2007
---
Oh ok. That‚Äôs silly. Do you know why I got downvoted? üòî
---
There no need to grind lavas to 99 rc, try doing nature from 91 with rc pouches for profit.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve read it and it doesn‚Äôt make any sense when he‚Äôs continuously afking his other account while doing these.
---
Yeah, uninstall that shit, problem solved.
---
Should we tell you?
---
smh can't even enjoy a simple meme these days
---
As far as I know, the full void set effect is better than dragonhide or karil‚Äôs armor. However, you only get the set effect when you‚Äôre wearing every piece in the set- so you won‚Äôt be able to use your barrows gloves or a slayer helm. Personally, I use dragonhide with barrows gloves and a slayer helm when I‚Äôm training slayer, and full void for anything else- questing, bossing, etc.
---
Hope that answered your question.
---
I think this is the first time I've seen a white knight outside of Falador.
---
And that someone could be you if you did it for an hour
---
But seriously if you come over here I will trim that armor for you
---
&gt;	What does relationship advice have to do with hookups? 
---
Guess you have no friends to talk to family to support you huh? Never said it was about hookups with reddit, was about why you‚Äôre not in a relationship anymore boy. 
---
&gt;	You‚Äôre just mad cause I‚Äôm right. Sit kid. Your mom works at Popeyes
---
Right about what..? Also it‚Äôs funny you calling me a kid when I‚Äôm older than you. Again, you‚Äôre just a man child. At least I can talk to my mom if I need to about relationships instead of posting to Reddit lmao
---
Also really cute getting on your alt to upvote yourself through all of this and downvote everyone responding to you lol
---
Not really. Never played until wrath so all these inconveniences that people enjoy in classic im not a fan of. Dont get me wrong, retail isn't a shining star either
---
Ur a bottle top
---
Ah okay good thanks for mentioning that. I wasn't worried about discontinued items but I can see why other people would not like them.
---
Helm of neitiznot + d boots
---
Then mid levels don‚Äôt deserve a bis helm either
---
Oh yeah, d boots would be good. He did say he already has a neitz.
---
To my understanding the fact that they are a mid level slayer NPC, implies that they are targeted towards mid levels? 
---
It‚Äòs getting harder and harder to create content for the whole ‚Äömid-level‚Äò community because the voices that Jagex hear are often from the HLC or maxed players.
---
What makes you think it's projection?
---
Is it not about the mixed opinion of players on third party client features?
---
Literally everyone's excuse for defending left click blackjacking/con was "im not a neet i wanna maintain top exp rates with muh limited time but i dont wanna use more than one mouse button!!"
---
Looks great, awesome job!
---
How is that different than getting 99s?
---
Jokes on you I'm hiding millions in my servants moneybag!
---
Konar is still being used frequently by players. I used her from 85-95 slayer. Only reason I don't use her anymore is because (exactly what everyone expected) the prices of the items she rewards dropped and I feel like I rarely make more than 50k a chest anymore.
---
Back when death mechanics were 3 minuets i had my stash cat on me (60kish) went to karajama met with some loser demons and died, cryed for 4 hours my older brother gave me 200k , till this day that was the worst day of my life, i wanna say 2002-3ish
---
Am I the only one that finds it strange he gets 71minute kills in that gear?
---
did you test it out as an account at that level or a maxed with BIS gear? because i'm willing to bet that right now they are a waste of time for an average account with 60 slayer to farm.
---
Hahaha
---
Looks like it was inspired by content creators but not seeing where they are credited
---
That doesn't mean the new bis should be cheap too, it should be something you need to work for
---
Now there is a difference between changing them again and reverting them. It sounds like they wouldn't want to revert them, which is understandable now I guess. They could change them a third time though to something else and see how that works out
---
Thanks man :)
---
Pretending that zulrah isnt mid-level content and that the BiS helm we had before that wasnt early game content is wrong as well
---
hey bro you gotta share those herb run and flipping tips with us bro
---
Please submit links using the [link submission form](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/submit).

mmmf... anal vore &lt;33
---
Back in classic when you could duel anywhere I got lured for a rune med. The person dueled me twice and threw then dueled me a third time staking my helm for something I can't remember with no retreating on and they pulled a r2h and destroyed me (had a rune longsword at the time and nowhere near pvp stats).
---
Is it strange that after 10months of playing and having never played before, he has over 1b bank value and barely the stats to fund it?
---
he‚Äôs obviously using one example of a person to target a whole group of people, i know quite a few maxed players and none of them are unemployed and living at home doing nothing, this guys just salty this game is grindy and projecting false facts to make himself feel better about himself.
---
People like you believe the moon landing was fake
---
We want pk updates. But since you responded I‚Äôll respond too. Jagex after the polls failed said they‚Äôd be making some changes on the way certain things get polled or voted in. So because of this poll where the only pk item to pass was something earned from pvm they will change how they vote for pvp/pk updates. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you need 100/200 kills in the wilderness or pvp to vote on a pvp poll in the future or a way less percentage to pass pvp updates they literally polled these things and phrased questions vaguely to see how the pvmers and non pkers would vote. 
---
Now I will agree it cost me probably 250m in total over to course of a year of pking every day to get good. I don‚Äôt die much anymore but yeah it cost a whole bunch. I like lms because it does teach you to pk for free but only med\main pkin. The pking community has numbers in the 20,000‚Äôs that‚Äôs a decent number of people part of community that gets no updates cause of the way polling happens. Jagex has heard our complaints and they are gonna change stuff finally. It only took them a year of polls getting shot down every time to realize they will never pass and pvp will die. I actually look forward to see what they do
---
How long is the league going to last? How much fun are you getting out of it? How much work hours did it take to develop? How many hours do you play your classical AAA title?
---
Imo people are way too stingy with the price of membership and thats what leads to MTX.
---
If you ever paid 60 dollars for a game you spent 40 hours playing and are complaning about 11$ a month you are an hypocrite.
---
More catering to ironmen... Spend 2 months of time grinding a brand new account just for cosmetic rewards... Yeah imma head out
---
Congrats!  Assuming you borrowed the gear, bow at least, or that is much more impressive than a 10 month firecape.  Now you can set your sights on the Infernal cape :)
---
this would greatly improve my muslim only ironman
---
The RC thing is a meme, not a serious argument. 55 RC takes like 10 hours tops
---
It was voted in 96% with those stats.
---
It was done by hand because when you use a generator like that there are some issues and the quality is lacking.
---
dude I've been doing a lot of wc
---
Hill giant club is really expensive for f2p though
---
Or, you can just let people play the game the way they want to. It literally doesn't impact you at all.
---
The obsession with numbers going up on a screen is correct, the mentally ill part is debatable.
---
I haven't been crashed once and I've done about 20 moles
---
Thank you, I may tak eyou up on that offer.  Ill send it over now.
---
Don't be hard on me, It was my first run and only had addy darts on my blowpipe
---
Wc to afford full arma and tbow. *applause* congratulations you played yourself.
---
I get the joke, but as it stands that's the only way of making the game more mechanically challenging. All the content that is considered "hard" is just hard to learn because of stat/gear requirement to do effectively, challenge being reset upon death or both. Other than that most mechanics are "stand here/do not stand here/look out big hit coming/kill small thing" either as individuals or combinations of each other, with prayer added on top.
---
The fair amount of challenge that can be implemented this way is still fun to overcome, but nothing in the game is actually hard to pull off consistently. Different player added challenges are much harder (account/gear limitations, speedruns, high efficiency solos), but those are pieces of content you don't have to participate in to reap the rewards.
---
That being said, I wouldn't want it any other way, and would rather see the devs come up with new and creative mechanics even with the limitations of the game rather than seeing the combat system overhauled in favour of a more complex one.
---
I'll be disabling basilisk tasks now, thanks for making me waste the points to unlock + extend them
---
Verrrry cool. I like your style. Reminds me of a warden from For Honor a bit
---
First day huh
---
With a cannon? And how much did you spend in cannon balls, p pots and such? Did you count that? Did you also count the time it took you to level up stats till you could use the whip and such? That's not 12ish hours. Your 12 hours assumes you get the best slayer creatures for XP as well that not gonna be the case most of the time either.
---
Looks great, but needs to come from in game, not some side mode.  
---
If it were to fail this poll, would the  mods look to re-poll it somewhere more appropriate?
---
it is very depressing to rely on 1/5k drops for a few minutes of dopamine yeah. people attempting to justify it have the C O P E running thru their veins
---
YOU chose not to understand my comment, going straight for the "oh you didnt read cause they are not going to be new pouches each time" read my other ones. I'm well aware that the pouches would be linked. I'm totally against the entire concept of inventory saving. Why not just have summoning back too?
---
ah okay so the drop table is good to be old school but when we say that nezy was a BIS that only required quest completion you'll tell me that maybe oldschool didn't have it all figured out? how about stop being hypocrites
---
I also kill bandos with the boys on weekends
---
Is it honestly that bad? I have heard a lot of people talk about this to the point where I am not sure if its a joke or not? I have been to blizzcon the last 5 years where this is legitimately not a problem. I am going to runefest for the first time this year so thats why I am curious.
---
Badass!
---
Its good for dks off task, so if you're pet hunting DKs I guess its quite solid there. Though, if you can afford it, a serp may be better since you dont need to bring a couple antidotes
---
There is significant evidence that what he said isn't true: I just got one on my last task this past week in the Prif dungeon.
---
I don't have evidence to support this other than my coll log having 1 head, and the fact I only do them in the Prif dungeon.
---
Me and the boys running past the dark wizards
---
There was no ditch when I was a kid.
---
Some good points here, I no longer grind like I used to, I was once a numbers chaser but now I log in and literally do whatever I fancy, I still make steady progress but I definitely enjoy it lots more too, and I dont stress if I miss a few days of play due to working or life in general.. best of both worlds.
---
Angler + Kara is already strong, healing 74% of ur hp in one tick is a no no.
---
I'm sure you are aware of zeah rc. That's massively more afk than traditional rc.
---
People still ddos when there are massive stakes going on at the duel arena, as that is one of the few places where it still can be a benefit.
---
Weird ok but flex
---
Everyone knows Saradomists are secret freaks.
---
You also could *have* listened more in school
---
i think its so members with max gears cant just afk faceroll those bosses
---
This makes me sad. And it's only gonna get worse when MTX besides bonds come into the game
---
Kills uim completely.
---
What? It's really not?
---
There's a ton of content in the game, maxing doesn't mean you've done everything or acquired everything. You could grind for pets, take on the inferno, go boss/raid with some friends, try to fill out collection log, etc. If you haven't realized yet the entire game is a grind to be able to grind more.
---
It's almost like you didn't read the post!
---
&gt;Drops and droprates can be adjusted to properly balance the ease of killing Basilisk Knights and the Jormungand vs the effective droprate
---
Once you have 200m it's not that hard to make 10m a day sitting at the GE. Ten months is a long time and you got to remember that it's a marathon, not a sprint.
---
üòõ found at oneholyrobot.com
---
But who actually thinks that way? I haven't seen a single person make this argument whether on reddit, twitter, or in game. It seems like this is just a made up point of view.
---
I love the balloon pet good idea
---
Never said it was hard, only that it was high effort.
---
You completely missed the point of this post but its ok, continue trying to be an edgy teenager and see how that works when your 30
---
Ok mom
---
Uninstalling and downloading the newest RL launcher should fix the framedrops.
---
Not everything about the game is fun? The fun parts are fun but the levelling up of kther skills requires repetition of the same mundane tasks for tens to hundreds of hours. Unless you're autistic and find pleasure in watching paint dry, nobody else finds that fun
---
Started playing back in 05/06 I think, was loving playing but quite possibly the biggest noob ever :).. anyway my mate bought me full rune for the first time (I never had a prayer of buying it myself). Day one I went to the wilderness line to show my stuff off (as you did back in the day) and this really nice guy got talking to me and told me about a glitch that could earn me bank.. the only catch was that we had to go to the teleport obelisk thing in the wilderness. I thought I was a clever guy that could do maths and knew he couldn't attack me as he was a way higher level.... Safe to say when I got teleported to deep wildy I never stood a chance. Well and truly heart breaking &lt;/3 I'll never forget it.
---
I then messaged him asking for my stuff back and he offered to fight me for it in duel arena, WHAT A TWAT!
---
250 raid clears is pretty insane even for dedicated players.
---
Yea add more gp on top of a better jaw drop rate into the game. Makes sense.
---
I have rc, agility, smithing, fishing, mining, slayer, attack, defense, strength left. Lowest is 90 (mining) so I feel you. I should be maxed around February-March at the latest of next year
---
ill check it out thanks
---
Thank you, next question. BYE!
---
They don't drop the jaws which is the point. If you didn't want to get them as a task you would just remove them from your unlocks, good task to get just annoying because of the massive buff.
---
Want blue dragons nerfed as well? I really think the burst tasks are the only tasks worth nerfing, it's like free 99 mage and slayer at no cost and is the quickest route
---
Don't worry, you're not alone :)
---
Where do they come from?
---
No. Just look at what the last incarnation of that concept was. Runespan always was an always will be an icon of ezscape, atleast for me.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
Cabbage combo
---
I dont slay for xp so id still be slaying but sure idm
---
Looks great, looks fun and interesting, but I will vote no to anything that affects the main game, including the tradeable rewards.
---
I really like the rewards and would like to see them added in in other ways, but I don't want alternative game modes to affect the main game.
---
10o0 hOuRs.
---
And no QUESTIONS.
---
Application? more so information about levels so they can judge you on your xp waste.
---
Not quite sure yet. I was thinking they be put as a rare drop from currently-dead agility content to reintroduce players to empty training areas. Right now rooftop courses are the agility meta and very few non-btw players ever stray away from it.
---
I agree, but it's hard to be good at PVP without spending hours grinding for GP and levels
---
Whenever there‚Äôs drama right in the beginning of the month it‚Äôs usually followed by more drama like Tbow drop.
---
the previous one came from the lower level variant of the quest. That was NEVER seen as a problem in the community...
---
They say that the words hurt
---
People were complaining from the initial reveal of the mob right up to release and they couldn't be assed, so now they are currently just a shitty mob that nobody wants to kill.
---
Damn Sneaky be killing it
---
You know what I use to think the same way till I started skilling hardcore. It made me feel invigorated everytime I got 200-500k exp a day cause before I was just only pking and getting 4k-15k exp a day
---
This boss isn't supposed to be a better way of acquiring the Jaw, it's just supposed to be an alternative, more engaging way.
---
Also, the reason I said 40k was to pretty much only pay for food/potions. Realistically speaking 40k per kill is a laughable rate for a boss of that level. Especially when you take into consideration that Vorkath exists.
---
Wow more pets just what we need
---
wow might be the only game where i'm not in constant worry about my account being hacked or getting scammed as they are usually quick and decisive with their actions that in large deter them from even happening.
---
Don't need them at all
---
I was mostly memeing. The structure you propose is actually not far off from what they actually do, if I'm not mistaken.
---
But this sub is apparently 89% maxed players who treat anyone who isn't at least base 90s (excluding pures) in combat stats + Slayer is a filthy normie
---
TIL there's a superior pyrefiend.
---
Shit his pants AND only got 2nd place, that's my favorite part of that story
---
Exactly i dont know why people care so much
---
It passed poll with 96%. Just remember Reddit and Twitter don't speak for the majority of the community. Normally people that are in the minority are the loudest
---
Quite possibly the worst thing ever invented... EVER. Whoever made that skill and thought it would be a good idea to put it in the game wants locking in a dark basement with Joseph fritzel on guard duty for the rest of his/her life!
---
Wow, what a nostalgia trip.
---
Things that make the game harder or nerfs to stuff never gets polled. Wah wah.
---
Updating their client is something they can't control?
---
The joke is all the people on this reddit who think the buff wasnt needed
---
Haven‚Äôt killed it since like 2 days after release. Did it on task with Bandos and divines. Used a rapier, but didn‚Äôt bring bones to peaches. Obviously b2p could extend trips by a long time, but I‚Äôve been using a bone crusher lol
---
MEP2 doesn't require 90 slayer either.
---
I was so surprised when we hit b2b dramaless months. 3/10 so far must be some kind of record.
---
Rushing Taverly gate in F2P
---
this has never been the case, the loot is rolled from a reward casket when you open it.
---
You don't have to speedrun to learn or use the strategies though. It can be useful to know what items/skills/flasks are used and why.
---
It was a few behind-the-scenes greasy Twitter neckbeards complaining to Jagex on social media. Literally like 0.000001% of the playerbase, and from a group of players that have the **least** relevant and influential opinion out of any player.
---
Sweaty, 18 hour playtime bottle pissers don't represent the playerbase. Not only that, the basement creatures who were complaining on Twitter are so high-leveled that Basilisk Knights were already dead content to them pre-release. They were never intended for them to fight in the first place.
---
Fucking brainlets, of course they were too easy for them. If they weren't brain damaging themselves with their BO and ammonia fumes from their piss bottles they might have realized this.
---
Make cooking cape no longer let you inside cooking guild, devalues my chefs hat.
---
PvP pker here .., I wanted them for fun ...
---
And only 3x exp.
---
It‚Äôs still fun to play. I like going for collectionist things like pets. Biggest reason I‚Äôm still playing is I‚Äôm finally becoming wealthy enough to afford good gear lol
---
Just cause they don't play as much as you doesn't mean their vote shouldn't count. Whole point of polls is to get different views and let's the majority view win.
---
Yea because i worked last year until i started studying again about a month ago?
---
And why does my personal life matter to you? Yes i play the game a lot more than the average person, so i for sure know a lot more about it than some noob like you
---
You say it‚Äôs ‚ÄúOctober 2nd , 2019‚Äù not ‚Äú two October‚Äù
---
Shamans are good without dwh though
---
My maxhit with dharoks is like 66 in nmz, When should i start using dharoks in nmz?
---
Me and my little brother hoping the earth strike hits a 0
---
Too soon.
---
Omg i love this. My favorite part is the running. Noobs always think for some reason running away from the inevitable attack will help instead of a prayer switch. It took a while to break that habit against new bosses.
---
There was no runescape when I was a kid.
---
The God wars bosses weren't created to be easily soloable my dude. That doesnt make them not mid game content. It was made to run with your friends, theres a reason it isnt instanced.
---
I‚Äôm chaotic neutral in all of this. I don‚Äôt vote but I‚Äôm on the sidelines with me popcorn.
---
‚ÄúI STILL SEE YOUR SHADOWS IN MY ROOM‚Äù
---
No I‚Äôm saying they were pretty difficult to kill on release. More difficult to kill than slayer monsters that required a higher level to kill. I thought they were fine on release
---
Are you ok? Why are you so angry?
---
Lmaooo yessssssss, this guy. I like this guy.
---
Uh yeah, that's the point.
---
Understandable have a nice day.
---
sit idiot
---
You're not saying anything of substance. Did you just comment because you're angry? üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
When your power goes out and you realize what time it is üòÇ
---
I think that or probs GWD2 i just wish they realize more team content instead of solo content.....
---
Nah I NEVER do gwd lol. It‚Äôs hard to dedicate time to doing a GWD trip, and I don‚Äôt have any friends to go with haha
---
Compare it to Vorkath. A blue dragon slayer task is fun but no way in hell I'm staying there for 240 kills... If I play 10h a day, I prefer to at least finish a slayer task.
---
Be dont need extra.
---
Oh wow. Someone bitching about pvp updates and nobody bats an eye.
---
I think I was too bored at work to see the joke and to not take your comment too seriously aha.
---
Yeah it's times like these that I'm proud to be a mid-level player. I would hate to see myself become one of those creatures who were complaining about Basilisks on Twitter.
---
Can you imagine? Just got done with your 20 hour play session to take a piss bottle break, sore and uncomfortable as hell because you're so overweight, sweaty, and greasy. Then proceed to bitch at Jmods on Twitter for two hours because you finally found something worth breaking your EHP addiction for a couple of hours.
---
So don't do them if they're such an annoying task... Or seeing as they are much harder to kill now, it's likely that the jaws will retain their value better, because less people will be capable of effectively farming them.
---
I did like that I could afk them at first. But I much rather have the jaw be a rare item that holds its value a while longer. That‚Äôs more exciting and now I‚Äôm not on a mad dash to slay/skip for the task for FOMO.
---
Now they‚Äôre a semi-afk slow task akin to Drakes, but with a 20+m drop. Their drop table is fine, too. More than enough to cover your supplies while training slayer, all the while gambling for a big drop. Exactly as it should be.
---
He said "get into" not endgame boss battle
---
I just read through that thread and you're right. It also seems that a ton of people didn't even bother to read the entire article. There's boosted xp rates and a bunch of ways to speed up progress and people are discussing how it's not doable for regular players.
---
oups! WILD*
---
See I primarily played the game to flip on the GE. Most of the rest of the game seems pretty boring to me. So without having a goal like ‚ÄúI want to be able to kill x boss or do x quest‚Äù, there‚Äôs not really much point in me trying to get most stats up. The XP rate of RC compared to other skills doesn‚Äôt matter at all because skilling is the side game for me.
---
Especially not new items with the max change of +-5% a day.
---
It shouldn't be a 60 slay monster dropping BiS helm, this is on Mod Wolf for wanting to get something done quick before Runefest and before he left Jagex.
---
yea
---
just dodge lmao
---
It's not that bad at all. It is grindy but plenty of stuff to do before you're maxed. Just don't rush enjoy it and if not then quit worth a try at least the game is great.
---
It's a game that will progress as fast as YOU can. been playing RS (osrs) since I was 11 and in full honesty the numbers are fussy exactly but you will hit a point where to lvl up one stat it could take 8hrs of gameplay
---
I think people are especially angry this time because of the source of this kneejerk reaction, a handful of Twitter neckbeards who were too high-leveled to bother with Basilisk Knights in the first place.
---
You can get like 70 fletching in 5 minutes
---
We say 2nd of october in UK, idk about other countries because they use different languages so stuff like that might be normal to them...
---
They should make this the default run animation ~~for April fools or something lol~~
---
FTFY
---
Except horizontal progression can only go so far before the niches get filled
---
remove the helmet from their drop table
---
Came back to this sub to see if it was still toxic and looks like it‚Äôs just gotten worse. So glad I quit this game after a majority of the mods left.
---
Couldve been lent to him I guesss.
---
These wouldnt harm the game and people would be interested in doing the events instead of dismissing them. Id vote for this to pass
---
Man playing rs while high is so difficult lol. I spend so long staring at my bank thinking about everything I'll need for whatever I'm doing next and I end up forgetting half of it anyways so I backtrack like four different times, then I can't remember what I was even doing, etc etc
---
Dropped by Tim Allen biker boys
---
&gt; BIS meals
---
That's fantastic man. I'm not even angry about your incorrect opinion. This is hilarious.
---
haha fucking exactly
---
Which in runescape time, is very fast

Updating their client wouldnt solve the problem of third party client. I don't want to go into detail about this but the consensus is that its nearly impossible to detect that someone isnt using the base client and anyway they make it detectable could be countered. Therefore if they made a balanced client that was alot weaker in plugins then the comon 3pc people would still use 3pc...
---
If it doesn't require 100% my attention, I'll be multitasking. 
---
Semi-afk Skilling? Multitasking with videos or series
---
Pvp, bosses, efficient play, quests. I'll probably just be solely paying attention to the game.
---
This goes for all the games I play. MOBAS or whatever when waiting for queue, etc. Doesn't require me to pay all attention so I do other things,
---
Even study in the mean time

I never even mentioned ehp, I only said slayer isn't the slowest skill from experience. I guess you're too elite to know how casuals play the game I guess?
---
My idea is don't play it if you don't want to lose progress on your ironman.
---
 A post destined to die at 8 upvotes
---
It probably has to do with what happened to slayer in 2012. In 2012 the only profitable task in the game at that point was Ice Strykewyrms do to it being task only and you couldn't camp the hell out of it.
---
A lot of stuff is nicer if it's challenging or by some measure deemed as "aids"
---
How much $$$ did he fund? Dun know how much u rent soo
---
Yeah he does pull like 10k or even 20k if there's special events like new content released or DMM. But right now there's not much happening in the game + he's doing the same stuff over and over again so his views are lower than usual. I still wouldn't say his channel is even close to dying. You can make a living on Twitch by averaging over 100 views, it all depends on how you manage your business and what you do outside of Twitch.

That or their piss bottle tower tipped over and they got lightheaded from all of the ammonia fumes.

where do we draw the line between ‚Äúenjoyment‚Äù and ‚Äúdopamine hits,‚Äù though?
---
Yes, "engine limitations" was the explanation Jagex gave for not adding mounts in RS3 (without the extra speed mounts would be dead content). OS code is most presumably similar
---
It's a good meme though
---
I've never been to rf, is it really that bad? i see content creators and other players saying this all the time
---
Jesus fuck, fuck you man. I like how this herd mentality completely clouds your judgement and makes you blind.
---
Do you fucking know me? No you don't, yet you group me together with some unnamed group, attach their qualities to me. I'm not a NEET, i work a solid job 8hr/s a day. When i play OSRS, i dont tick manipulate. I leveled 88 smithing with fucking addy darts, i afked barbarian fishing to 91, no tick manipulation.
---
You talk down these NEETS, but have you looked in the mirror? Do you live in this reality? Think for once, before you write.
---
Just because you're fucking retarded and bad at the game, doesn't mean everyone is, you're talking like these basilisk knights are inferno that only select few can do. They're incredibly fucking easy, can be killed taking no damage with ranged, and can kill 10-20 in a trip, more if you use b2p. This update does not cater to the 5%, i'd say 30% of the community has no problem killing basilisk knights, it's just not the sweet vorkath 3m/h and it's suddenly NEETscape.
---
Knights are dead content
---
As I said, Cave horrors and Abyssal demons are "original" content, so I don't think it would do any good to change their requirements higher.
---
They need to be put in their place. One of the cringiest things in the entire OSRS community is that these creatures think their opinions on the game hold relevancy to the wider playerbase or hold any influence.
---
are you ok lmao
---
I don‚Äôt remember what happened but tbows were randomly spawning on the ground and anybody could just pick them up
---
You mean who woulda thunk
---
&gt;Like teleblock failing a poll and going in anyway
---
A poll? More like 3
---
Someone told me the chins aren‚Äôt perfect because they don‚Äôt nab all the healers due to Jad‚Äôs hitbox size or something. Is that a thing?
---
Relics could make this much much more manageable, we have no idea yet
---
It'll go back down, this is just people panic buying it because of the plugin change.
---
Runelite has almost none of those overpowered ones. Use bones is arguably the only one you could even argue is overpowered and it's far more a QOL thing than anything.
---
socialscape, see you there :)
---
Nobody gives a fuck about the price of the jaw, the problem is the knights are way too hard for being level 60 slayer monsters and their loot outside of the jaw is garbage. The change wasn‚Äôt needed in the first place, this task went from being just slightly decent to being absolute aids.
---
Bleh.  Fortunately they are only given by lower level slayer masters, and they are pretty quick to do.
---
Soooooo only 4 years later, are they gonna do it and to rs3.....
---
Gf osrs.
---
Sure, same thing for the purpose of the argument really. Still solidly longer than basilisk expected value
---
Wait what happens to Bob? üò∞
---

---
Tbows were spawning on the ground so they had to rollback

Lol what? Nice gatekeeping. VERY few, if any of us at all know how to balance a game. Guess we better do away with the system.

You sure you‚Äôre not signing up with the same email address or phone number as the original muted account or something silly?

Simply don‚Äôt play it if you can‚Äôt sacrifice gains in the real mode. I don‚Äôt want Jagex to cater even more to irons. I‚Äôm a 2,133 total iron with 365M exp btw.

"People" is unironically a stretch to use for those creatures. They're fundamentally unable to fit into society.
---
Volume on people!
---
You are a person whom I feel probably has growth past the phase of instant gratification
---
If u dont like the game then fuck off dude. 
---
Why do u feel the need to bring others down and call the mentally ill? 
---
This is a social game for most players I know, which means they get on to talk to their clans and friends and do other things in the meantime.
---
Did u not use AOL instant messenger back in the day? People spent hours online doing a lot less. 
---
If u think its only endless grinding maybe you're just socially inept? That ever cross your mind?
---
I don't use OSBuddy but there is no evidence of foul play in the past and any accusations such as that are wild and unwarranted speculation
---
don't understand why jagex didn't do something like this in the first place, every other bis gear is a boss drop
---
Connect 4 is a solved game btw.
---
This is why everyone who stakes says "dont ever stake".
---
If you win big, the game is boring because you have stupid amounts of money.
---
If you lose, you're cleaned. 
---
Staking addiction should be treated like any other addiction.
---
If you can't stop yourself from gambling the money away you may want to either start an ironman or take a long break from the entire game.
---
Not judging you, I have a propensity for addiction myself.
---
Taking a step back and finding other healthier activities to occupy my time has been one of the most helpful things I've done.
---
No, some people are just born with high stats
---
Do you have to?
---
People do all kinds of shit they like to varying degrees in order to get a certain thing/ action that they desire. 
---
Some enjoy the runescape grind,  some don't,  most I'd say have some goal they work towards.  Me personally I like high level pvm and pvp so I dip everything else to get to that.  Some things I don't like (tornado) but that doesn't mean I won't do it if it gatekeeps me from content I want to do. Most skills I find relaxing because some times I need a break from hyper competetive games.
---
I remember you begging for gold at GE
---
the tone and wording of his comment was broad and very general towards maxed players, so i replied as such. 
---
that being said though i agree, people like you describe should absolutely be shamed and have real problems.
---
Yeah try a different email maybe? If not maybe someone can make you an account that's not muted
---
Living up to your username
---
That and you don't have to stand next to the ugly minnow npc.
---
You say that and yet here you are ranting doing the exact same thing. Before you say it, "take it elsewhere please" is not a solution that justifies the rant.
---
10hp accounts would love it
---
I‚Äôm maxed combat on 2 accounts and can confidently say this is now one of the worst tasks in the game
---
Why do we need another guild? Most people don‚Äôt even use the guilds we already have. Also catering to what I‚Äôll call 1% of players is a very poor game development decision.
---
Edit: OP are you maxed?
---
Where is the account security "blog'
---
no lol he's dumb
---
Make it so only people with over 120 IQ are allowed to post on Reddit
---
If they were as they are now I wouldn't have an issue, but I wouldn't have thrown my slayer points at unlocking and extending the task
---
Right, and we should lock slayer mask behind a boss and a master quest to appease a few neckbeards. +15% accuracy/strength for killing a med level npc? are you kidding? Let's just retroactively upgrade every npc that drops a remotely decent item. I am not an advocate for easyscape but jesus this was a stupid update that directly contradicts what the quest was supposed to be geared toward. Tell me, what were the original reqs for helm of neitiznot? should we buff that too? lock it behind more difficult content? The reality is this buff wasn't an "integrity change", it was to appease a few sweaty streamers who happened to get the drop early and don't want others to do the same.
---
How the hell did you get ToB done before CoX for music cape?
---
Definitely some form of stone mutagen for the niet helm
---
I would like more in the fairy tale quest line. Would be nice to use fairy rings with out a dramen staff
---
Also lms is such a nice way to practice pvp, it's crazy helpful
---
So like some idea posted in the reddit earlier
---
A Jormungand boss, it'd be midlevel (weaker than vorkarth) and loot wise like 30k/kill. But it'd have the Jaw drop unique
---
Okay, you kill Vorkath to get better drops but you have the choice of killing normal blue dragons as well... Just like you can kill normal basilisks. This mental gymnastics is too much for me.
---
Haha yeah that is very true, probably would have been annoyed if it was my first run.
---
imagine being this dense
---
My god.. Stop being efficient for one fucking second.. I dont wanna stop playing the main game and lose xp omg noooo.... You sound like a fucking baby.. Get over it guy
---
go kill 168 bloodvelds
---
Well, i'm not referring to it being polled or not. I'm referring to the decision that Mod Wolf communicated on twitter before he left, where he stated that they polled the helm high because "if players don't like it they'll vote no" even though the vast majority of people aren't going to do that lol
---
Blue dragons arnt bad at all it you go to the task only spot set up a cannon and safespot
---
It hits all the dragons in the room and you fly thru the task. Add a bone crusher for some free pray xp
---
I can't out DPS the healers with 92 range, slayer helm, and rune darts. Zero chance that happened.
---
People cried basilisks were too easy. Jagex nerfed them. People cried about Jagex nerfing them. The end.

Personally I get bored while watching tv shows/ movies but if I play rs at the same time I feel like I‚Äôm accomplishing something. I feel like a multitasking god.

For the chance to fight thicc booty bloodveld boss? Anytime baby
---
You sound really spoiled, KQ is fine as it is. KQ originally was aimed and designed to be killed in teams back in RSC because of this you weren't supossed to get many kills/trip. It wasn't a boss that you are supossed to solo but as the game progressed that became possible. Be happy about the fact you can get 3 kills/trip (or more) nowdays thanks to things like DWH/BP + Slayer Task.
---
what are you going on about? you're obviously missing something. Dragon darts, eagle eye, range pot, on task, blessed d hide, anguish, archers ring (i)
---
EDIT: I do a JAD task once a day with 92 range and this setup and always out dps the healers
---
This literally entices those who bot to create bots for this type of content... 1/5000 on an easy monster? Sure we'll bot it.  1/1000 on a slayer task only boss? Not gonna see bots there... Sad to see this game really spiraling downward these days.  It's all about "big business"... more bots = larger playerbase = more popularity = cheaper items in game. Jagex could CARE less about the players, if they're making money and not losing players rapidly they do not care one single bit.  We don't live in the 20th century where people actually did things to be good people and help others out. It's all greed and doing whats best for yourself only. Sounds a lot like capitalism if you ask me...

Like the original basilisks or basilisk knights? Are OG basilisks still a thing?

That's not the point

You only get 50 kills s trip cuz they have 2x everything

They intend to make them tradeable, but they are polling whether or not to do so.

There are actually bonds in OSRS, but we've drawn a line in the sand there, and they've been around for a few years with nothing more.

NICE MEME
---
but it sound like bad move to get more player to game. 
---
however I think making it optional and having some rewards could  make it happens:
---
- POH equipment that show how much xp you "lost" during the weekend
---
- special idle animation after wasting 50k, 250k, 1m xp 
---
- add new armchairs in GE that can be used only be people that wasted 100k xp - you can use bank and GE when sitting - only one person can use armchair at one time -  armchairs would be in GE  for 1 month after the weekend 
---
- "xp waste" pet - but it disappear after month and it  reduced xp by 50% when he is following player.
---
What if.....we use a smoldering stone?
---
Not like they were that hard to begin with. A small sacrifice
---
Ye and I 1 hit olm with a msb(i) gg jamflex
---
Next time try not to edit your posts after I already replied
---
It says "If lost on death."
---
If means everything that follows only applies if the first condition is met, in this case being that the VLS only drops with its charges if you lose it on death.
---
The VLS spec also only uses 35% spec in this iteration. Even if the 30k gmaul without a clamp uses 65% spec you can still use them together. It's basic math, 35 + 65 = 100.
---
The real strength of the VLS is its unpredictability. It doesn't matter how good a tent whip is in comparison because you still need a spec weapon with it. The VLS can act as both a mainhand and a spec weapon, meaning it immediately has a ton of variability for the opponent to consider.
---
The man could be holding a VLS into claws into a clamped gmaul, or he could be holding onto an ags. Or he could just smack you with a 40 off the bat with VLS then spec you with it in the next hit with a 60-30 VLS into welfare gmaul. He could even just spec you twice with the sword, wait that 30 seconds and get off a cheeky 3rd spec when the opponent gets careless thinking he blew his load prematurely.

messing around at the GE is genuinely fun though

it make minigames worth playing only on special weekends

What about that is "addictiony"

Bank standing usually = idk what to do but I wanna do something.

If they were addicted theyd be pissed they were losing xp and would be  doing wines or something while they figure out what to do next

Lol what no he doesn't. Look at his face
---
A few streamers got lucky with jaw (which is used to make the new BiS melee helmet) so people cried they were too easy since you get a BiS for them.
---
Jagex then went to give the bask knights a huge buff (+50% HP, deal more damage, new special attack, more defense), making it harder to obtain the jaw for anyone that didn't get lucky (and they're fairly rare, estimated drop rate is around 1/500-1/1k on task and confirmed 5x rarer off task)
---
Now people are crying because the grind takes a lot longer and the new helm is only +1 str over serp.
---
This is a joke right? This can‚Äôt be a serious post. I refuse to believe it.

---
This conversation wasn't about 3rd party clients though? I was specifically addressing "why do new mobs have dodge mechanics" and ultimately it's that movement is one if the few things we have under our control with the basic options of runescape. I don't think that's really a bad thing and I'd much rather have what we do in osrs than a dozen or more abilities with various cooldown and stun/lock breaks etc.
---
Dude you are assuming that everyone's gonna be doing the most efficient methods. That's not going to happen.you may call it fact based but there aren't many players who can maintain those rates consistantly. In practicality there is no way slayer is slower than RC and
---
Agility
---
This should have been the ONLY way to get the Jaw. Basilisk Knights should have been like the superior bloodvelds.
---
Lol he just made a post about how 90% of rap sucks then in the post he bitches about how they have girls shaking their ass in their video

I don't think it really matter how you play the game as long as don't play it too much. If you play a couple hours a night, max efficiency I see nothing wrong with that
---
Pretty good pet luck too!

&gt; fun
---
fun is addicting, it should be banned

Common misconception.
---
You do not need Rune Mysteries to train runecrafting. You only need Rune Mysteries to gain access to the essence mines. You also need it for access to the Abyss miniquest but you can totally train RC with lavas without rune mysteries.

Herblore, yeah you need Druidic Ritual though so mission failed.

This. And I'm someone who has a job in which I could spend upwards of 12-14 hours in a day physically and mentally exhausting myself. So, when I get home, I'm not always in the mood to play some fast-paced or competitive game that I have to focus really hard on. Runescape is a nice, chill game for me. I also like grind-y types of games and setting goals to accomplish in them.
---
Lmao youre really not grasping this concept.

Agreed, nerfs need to happen sometimes and they are veerrrryyyy unlikely to ever pass a poll.
---
Haha thx
---
How I personally choose to play isn't relevant (I wouldn't actually do that anyways), the point is that there should be a choice. One of the greatest aspects that rs has over other MMOs is the level of choice; you can go do whatever you want whenever you want. For example you can fight high level monsters while mid level - not as efficiently, but you don't *need* to hit level cap before participating in real pvm like you do in other games. Or you can go train any skill any number of ways.
---
By not just reducing the droprate, but reducing it *significantly* off task, you force players to either hopelessly grind the same boring slow-to-kill mob for potentially dozens of hours to get a drop, or blow a shitload of slayer points (which take dozens of hours to obtain) due to low weighting to get tasks for them to spend maybe only 10 hours getting the drop. Or option 3: just grind slayer because slayer good, and you may eventually get the drop on task after a couple/few months. 
---
Tldr slayer good, only slayer
---
Isnt like.. bloodvelds.. lvl 60 or so slayer?
---
I'm comprehending that you have a lot of larrans keys sitting in your bank....

level 98 with 38 runecrafting. Legit never made a rune yet and hope i can put it off until i want to hurt myself. Diaries and quest to get this as high as possible.

There are other languages that use month-day convention in spoken conversation, but you're right that there are also many that do not.
---
Off the top of my head I know that German does not, but Korean does (although in the context of year-month-day, not month-day-year. Generally Korean orders things large -&gt; small and superset -&gt; subset). I don't have enough experience with any other languages to make a claim about their date conventions.

Make them so we have to charge them with feathers, but not normal feathers, they need to be special ones. Made of silver perhaps?

Is this sarcasm and suggesting new players should be able to make the kind of money people who worked hard progressing their accounts do? Wouldn‚Äôt make much sense for there to be a lack of progression in money making as you level.

I did a 200 basilisk task last night.  Took me over 10 trips and 4 hours to finish.  I'm max combat.   Total loot was 950k.  
---
600 on task kills before update, and now 200 after.  This was uncalled for.  They're every bit as afk as before, but take 3x as long and more supplies.
---
Pre-buff basilisk knights were a fine addition as mid-level content. The issue comes from making the helmet BIS. There is no issue with a level 60 slayer monster having an upgrade to the nezzy, but it's an unnecessary powercreep that could have been saved for future content. By buffing the basilisk knights it not only eludes the problem, but worsens it.
---
Amen brother!

Did it with similar stats to you, had 75 Def tho. Took me literally about 20 tries only getting to 4th stage 3 or 4 times.. 
---
I was thinking same as you until I did it and still had half an invent left.. just wait until you pearl a few ruby bolt specs off and watch him drop like a sack of dragon shit
---
Yes! About 3-4 hours of painting. Another hour or so before I had a solid idea on what to paint though (lots of scribbling and erasing).
---
Also he's trading 1 coin and it's called "coins"
---
I'd much rather destroy clue hunters than do a bloodveld task
---
Why do you think its shit?
---
This already in rs3.
---
\&gt;Rcb, ruby and diamond bolts (e), archer helm, barrows gloves, karils top, accumulator, blessed dhide legs &amp; boots, fury, archer ring. 
---
To be clear, you ARE bringing an antidragon shield, right? Just superantifire alone doesnt work on him, he ignores all antifire if you dont have a shield.
---
\&gt;Inv: range pot, super extended antifire, prayer pot, 1 click tele, 2 sara brews, 3 super restores &amp; the rest mantas.
---
Downgrade to a regular antifire.  Hes not vork, antifire+antidragon shield is enough and you have to bring a shield anyway.  Itll save you money.
---
Your sara to manta ratio is kinda low - the higher the saras, the more annoying the healing is to use but the longer youll last, since 3 saras+1 restore is equivalent to 9 mantas in 4 spaces. If you bring like 12 saras and 5 supers (and take the time to learn how to sip brews correctly if you havent), food will stop being the limiting reagent.
---
At that point, its just a matter of learning his attacks.  
---
* Fire - He doesnt use ranged this phase, only magic and fire - so you should be praying only mage.  Im sure you saw in slayermusiqs thing, but you want to stricly stay on the vertical spinal cord of the ship, running a bit whenever you get meteored.  Never sideways.
---
* Air - tedious but easy.  He starts using ranged this phase and your ranged def is likely lower so pray that.
---
* Water - if you use runelite, turn on the applet that will show you the square youre running to.  Makes tsunami a lot easier.  When running through tsunami, always assume Galvek is firing a meteor and keep moving through, dont wait for the tsunami to pass you.
---
* Earth - honestly, just every time you see him wind up an attack, dodge it as if its his earth block.  Youll be slightly more winded but your crossbow has a large firing cooldown, and that way hes not going to ever hit you with the boulder.
---
All phases in general:
---
* Never leave his render distance.  You want to see the dry heaving that telegraphs a meteor.
---
* If youre gonna be using a lot of brews, your ranged buff will reset a lot.  Try bringing 2 ranged pots to compensate.
---
* If you havent already, have eagle eye or rigour on during the fight.  This will likely double your prayer usage so if the supplies arent working out, feel free to stop, but youll be restoring off your brews a lot anyway.
---
* Pre-sip a stamina and an angler before equipping your full inventory at bank.  Easy way to cheat some inventory space, every bit helps.
---
* Build a lunar isle portal in your house and buy a bunch of house tabs.  After each run, teleport there, bank at the non-lunar banker, then talk to the lunar banker for a free teleport right to Torfinn.  This is useful both to start a run or to recover stuff from Torfinn.
---
* 99% of the fight is patience and dodging the meteors
---
So glad you like it! Thank you so much! Means a lot.

Its a themed ironman instead of strictly an area ironman. Wouldn't be much of a fremennik if you couldn't do fremmy trials
---
I love this community
---
Congrats man :)
---
I thought that‚Äôs why we all are here
---
Never been to a RuneFest but can any Melee players tell me how they compare to a smash bros. tourny?
---
Wow doubling money is one trade is real
---
Thank you! I used photoshop for this oneü§ôüèº
---
Man this has to be a record for killing new content quickly
---
My understanding of the story is that Jormungand was killed (this boss would be a reincarnation of sorts with the two Basilisk Knights performing the ritual, but stopping halfway to attack the player) and the *End of Things* was set in motion regardless of outcome on the Isle of Stone. My expectation was for Jagex to yoink something else from norse mythology (same way they yoinked Jormungand) to use as the final boss in the GM quest.
---
i can feel the entitlement
---
Cave horrors are bosses? Had no idea.
---
then they would be completely useless
---
If you're taking a lot of damage (you say you are running out of food) I would personally try a couple runs with Verac's helm. You lose about 1% overall hit chance with your setup so it shouldn't be too much but it adds a lot of ranged defence. It may be too little dps with your setup, or it might help its hard to say.
---
And the 3m item is honestly far more central to gameplay, uniquely powerful.
---
Its a +8 upgrade from a +0 where nezzy 2 is a +6 from a +5 or +3.
---
What is AHK?
---
Yeh, use more brews, I used elite void if you've got that..
---
Neither of us have girlfriends. And it clear we arent getting none there. Let's get together as a manhood and smell good for ourselves. :)
---
What's wrong with that? I was gonna buy one for Jad lol
---
Slayer task, timer and kc is for killing jad. The cape is only given if you don‚Äôt die. I think it‚Äôs possible to die from healers aswell so keep that in mind next time.
---
Agreed. It's also strange that some of the items on that screenshot had nothing to do with those key packages. Nothing said about the supreme stars for example.
---
I don‚Äôt believe in consumers being responsible for making sure companies pay good wages. I also believe people need to take responsibility of their careers. If Jagex employees want higher salaries it‚Äôs their own responsibility to go after them. If Jagex won‚Äôt give it to them, they should move on. They have marketable skills. They can use them for other things besides games and get paid more money. The fact is that working on a video game you love is a dream job for software developers. There‚Äôs probably no shortage of people ready to come in at any salary.
---
It's not like they mistakenly (or "mistakenly") made the wrong item spawn or something. They were testing something and needed a weapon. It wasn't balance testing, they just needed their character to have some gear quick and to be able to attack/kill something to validate functionality. I'm sure most of the random spawns they create in that capacity are only for the absolute most powerful items in the game. Unfortunately, they just forgot one they'd made in the testing process that time.
---
if im not mistaken you should use dharok once you hit 92 hp
---
Sorry which word are you offended by?
---
Because he hasn‚Äôt gotten 96 yet
---
You beautiful bastard. I've done it finally. I dropped brews all together - I think I was getting flustered trying to remember to take 3-1 etc. Not bringing them at all meant I had a few extra pieces of food that I needed to finish him off. 
---
Also I was using fucking extended super antifire potions which apparently dont fucking work! I only found this out afterwards though! So I did it without any proper protection (I was using a DFS shield I forgot to mention that in my OP)
---
Thanks so much for the help everyone I fucking love you all
---
wow good come back my gui you really killin the reddit game right now
---
Youre human garbage
---
like 3 days ago
---
I remember my uncle game me 90k and I thought I was so rich. Then I took it into the stronghold of security not thinking, because a guy said he‚Äôd give me an addy scimmy if I made it all the way through. I died and lost all my moneys, sad day for small me.
---
I said this in another comment and I agree with your point, just find it funny how Reddit points at twitter as the plague when they are both the complete same thing.
---
&gt; The drop shouldn't have been on them to begin with, but it is and so they should be balanced around what the BIS item they give is.
---
It's because premier club coming close.
---
*yourmfdad has been* **BANNED**
---
I disagree. The majority want the grind, but when Jagex releases grind content people remember that grinds are hard. So initially there is complaining, but over time people enjoy it.
---
Yeah there's enough dumb ideas floating around here on a daily basis already.
---
Yea, also it drops a 30 mil item lol. Incentive.
---
LOL
---
I've finally killed the fucker! I did NOT know this and didnt read your comment until afterwards so no wonder it was taking the piss to kill him!? Thanks so much for the help all the same
---
The (existential) horror
---
Why would you add range prayer but not mage prayer? Downvoted for the shit suggestion.
---
i would play the fuck outa this
---
Too big. That is a 5head.
---
If both characters are from the same account, rewards will be transferred automatically. If your main is on a different account you'll be able to trade some rewards to other players (like your main), some rewards can be account locked though (untradable).
---
83 with 1 rc
---
yes please god make this happen
---
0 until I get stats and gear
---
Def go obsidian, im pretty sure dh is only better at 90 hp and attack and is way less afk
---
1. I would value your arguments but you have excluded stuff on purpose to make it sound better. Nmz requires loads of quests so the whole 'no quest' thing is wrong. 
---
2. While knights aren't the best content (pretty shit tbh) its pointless comparing dags that were released ~15 years ago. In that day and age i guarantee dags were much much harder. New mobs with Bis gear is definitely gonna get powercrept since people have much better items now.
---
Edit: The best solution i've heard is similar to cursed/demonic gorillas. Have knight with the shit drop rate and revert them. Have a higher level mob with better rates
---
I was in a F2P world GE a few days ago selling platinum tokens for 750gp each (you can obviously just trade them to a banker for 1k each). I had dozens of people accusing me of scamming. Lmfao, where is the logic in that? I was just using a creative way to give some money to a few noobs.
---
Gz on 50 fishing!
---
Bonds Will most likely only go up since people Will need alts to play league.
---
In normal mode it doesn't really matter, you can just stay max hp, the mobs don't hit very often. This is how I play when I'm at work at least. It really minimizes interaction.
---
Man even 15 minutes of max efficiency is too much for me, but true, 
---
people can do whatever they enjoy
---
I never knew this but i use the con cape to restore stats and stuff at the pool. I do this once my potions run out or im about to die it helps me tp out and reset.
---
Thanks man!  I studied and dissected his comment for 8 years in order to catch it.
---
That‚Äôs not me
---
Thanks! Now if only I could get into the guild
---
&gt;Acting like you are forced to go to the Wildy lol?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Sounds like a personal problem, stop being a little bitch
---
Username checks the fuck out.
---
GWD was August 2007.
---
That good, or bad?
---
It's even more crazy when they advertise RWT websites and osrs gambling in YouTube videos. I feel like jagex would ban these players but seems like if you create content you're above the normal rules.
---
‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùchallenging‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù
---
I didnt know a monster remaining afk and their new special attack literally does nothing but stop u from attacking and deals no damage + just boosted defense and hp is a challenge.
---
114 million xp, and you haven't killed enough banshees to get the greater version? Wtf dude, is all your xp in runecrafting or what?
---
Spot?
---
People dont fucking think when they vote in polls
---
Spent over $2k irl and bonds -10b total lifetime at the duel arena. I decided I wanted to max and havent had a reason to go back to the DA. You got this find the discipline to quit and motivate yourself to try new stuff to you in game.
---
yeah I do the same.  vork&gt;house tele&gt;use pool&gt;lunar isle portal&gt;bank&gt;speak to left banker (kicked to rellekka). places you very close to the fremmy elite tele spot. Saves a few steps anyway
---
Oh cool! Did you read my thing first? It seems like a lot of other people were saying bring more brews.   I tried that at first but it went so badly I watched some vids and the guy I watched brought mostly mantas.  Its much more relaxing only having to eat one piece of food than sipping the sara three times then the restore. I think you lose too much dps in a boss that is constantly hitting you
---
&gt;effort required for shamans
---
What effort? They're easy to completely avoid all damage from. Pray range, pop an antidote++, and make sure to wear shayzien 5, boom, no damage as long as you click like 5 squares away now and then.
---
They also have less defense than bknights, and half the health.
---
I miss aggro events that would kill noobs
---
..... you mean ..... buff??
---
It's really any kind of tech-oriented conference. In the opening presentation for DEFCON (a "hacker" convention), they tell people for the love of God please take care of your hygiene.
---
Because they didn't poll another level of basilisks, they only got approval for the knights.  It's early enough that the buff is certainly an integrity change, since obviously them being extremely weak on release was an oversight. 
---
 And if people think that's a hot take, then it's just more of a reason to justify the buff not being polled.  They were safespottable.  That's more than enough of a reason to adjust them within a month of release.
---
Your post indicates an imbued berserker. So you're wrong in saying there's no quests involved. Lol.
---
Yeah running between trees while woodcutting is going to be insane now
---
what about it?
---
as i said getting hit after you killed the monster shouldnt be a thing regardless of what npc is might be.
---
Obviously not you dork
---
Going into the wilderness for any reason = you are at risk.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt with your proposed stats for this new boss he still be harder than Vorkath on raw HP as there is no bonus to be used from DHCB
---
    hyahyahyahya
---
They know this is an issue but the current engine has no way of telling or keeping track of what the mobs have hit.
---
&gt;I dont understand why people dont want a monster to be harder to kill
---
The problem is that they didn't make it harder to kill. They duct taped a bullet sponge to its forehead and added a bullshit special attack. It's not harder to kill at all, it just takes 50% longer and burns up more supplies. That was a pointless move, especially when (not if) the jaw tanks in price. It will be dead content for non-ironman accounts because it will **cost** money to get the drop.
---
Need to make them instanced.
---
Not being funny but it‚Äôs the BIS helm. To insinuate it isn‚Äôt worth killing them because they‚Äôre tougher to kill is laughable.
---
Lmao forgot to censor compass orientation. Thanks for the account bro!
---
Is that Dana White lmao
---
did you read what i said?
---
this is not a matter of having enough food to complete the kill or not.
---
this is a matter of you have completed the kill but you get damaged by the boss that is already dead.
---
üêê
---
I got flamed for not having that in a 1750 world once.
---
Oh and I was 91 combat...
---
I think you're thinking of the guy going for the woodcutting pet. If you look at the top posts of this sub he did finally get it.
---
Ranged level? That seems decently high, you can use amethyst tipped for more ranged strength
---

---
I go from seeing OS to a fuckin weeb a wig real fast, wrong subreddit mate
---
Its built up through various other wildy posts I've seen him rage on
---
theres already lvl 80 and 85 armour
---
Thanks dude, yeah my memory is a bit vague..
---
dat dwarf weed..
---
Definitely, but he's purely talking about the unique mechanics, not the actual bosses themselves
---
Not uncommon. People hit up to like 70s but you‚Äôre talking max gear, 95+ range, fully potted, using rigour, using dragon bolts of some type.
---
Yes.
---
Unfortunately no, you would need to use points to cancel current task.
---
For me it's moreso that I don't usually like just sitting and watching something and I feel like I need to be doing something so boring rinds on runescape are good for that.
---
Seems like the axes might be useful for once with this idea.
---
You‚Äôre acting like they should have foresaw this back in 2005. Okay - in 2005 they released an easy boss that dropped BIS ring. Does that mean in 2019 they should release an easy monster that drops BIS helm?
---
I just don‚Äôt really understand what the controversy is. You can buy it from the GE if you have coins, right? It‚Äôs not untradable. It‚Äôs best in slot. I don‚Äôt know if you should be able to get the best helmet in the game at level 80.
---

Lighting it on fire is the new META, try it out.

You dont get dopamine from goal, dopamine is the neuro chemical that motivates you to reach your goal not the chemical that you get from achieving that goal nor does it give you pleasure.

so this is what the helm the fat twitter neets wear?
---
Easily farmable solo on a Slayer task
---
Get 10 time the xp needed to reach level 99 on every stat.
---
Lol bad excuse. there‚Äôs no high level pvm in the wild. It‚Äôs all mid to low level shit. YOU want the pet and so now YOU need to grow balls and accept the risk. No ones grinding Scorpia and the other shitter bosses for the ultra BIS malediction ward. No ones even grinding those bosses for the shields alone lol. 
---
For clues: there‚Äôs no risk associated with clues, at all. You lose nothing if you‚Äôre not absolutely retarded.
---
it's just a black cat from Gertrude
---
yeah, i mean you don't lose ags shards or claws shards when you don't risk them either, what's your point?
---
also, vls gmaul is completely irrelevant in outlasting and in regular fights ags/claws maul beats vls maul any day.
---
"unpredictability"?? i mean if you're 1 ticking everything (as you should be in 2019) it doesn't matter whether you whack with it or spec with it lmao. if they 9tick vls (or any spec weapon) you have the time to turn pray melee on either way, so it's a nonissue.
---
and the last part sounds like a pvmer describing how pvp works based solely on watching torvesta videos.
---
Depends on your view of midgame. I can do barrows with 35 magic and 50 ranged 20 defence pretty easy (did in dmm) and it's decent money. Cox can be done pretty easy with 75 magic and ranged. 60 atk 80 strength and 1 def ( I consider it midgame too lol)
---
I wash myself with a rag on a stick
---
Yah but everyone bitches and moans about those skills
---
Damn, this playerbase keeps rolling out the best content.  Shoutout to random event pets
---
More than 2, but less than 4
---
Oh yeah? I did it by flinching everything with my foot. Weapons are for brainlets
---
In the UK it would be the 1st of April and is how dates are taught in school.
---
Is this actually true
---
Makes retribution deal 3x more damage would make this item great
---
Because the price will start high but eventually stabalize at a much lower price eventually anyway (see: any pvm item - ferocious gloves is a good recent example). So all forcing rarity does is make it take maybe a few more months to stabilize at 8m. It's dumb to be mad about your rare drop being worth 20m instead of 25m when it's going to be 8m after a while anyway. Again look at the all-time price graph of literally any bis pvm item.
---
I don't even pk, but reading some of the comments here from "Anti-wilders" really makes me side with the pking community.  They contain no logic and are very toxic...
---
Sit kid
---
I had that type of step too yesterday and the plugin didn't work for me either
---
although i found that i actually completed it faster doing it normally than with the plugin lol
---
I read it with Eric's voice haha
---
Castle wars please
---
Of course skilling money is less than PvM money. Why do you as mid level player think you‚Äôre entitled to moneymaking at even half the rate of maxed players?
---
and to answer your question
---
Nats, Deaths, and Law RC is 300-700k hr
---
Blast mining at 75 is 500k hr
---
Mort Myre fungus is 600k
---
Making planks without the spell is 400-500k
---
tanning hides without the spell is 500-600k
---
Hunting Medium clue scrolls is TWO MIL AN HOUR if you get rangers at the rate
---
Blue dragon scales are 400k
---
making stat boosting pies is 450-600k
---
cutting diamond and ruby bolt tips are 300k
---
Cleaning certian grimy herbs can go from 200-700k an hour, snaps being the best
---
making unf potions is the same rate as bove but less clicking
---
Hunting red chins can be 600k
---
hunting black chins can be 1.2 mil
---
casting superglass make is 750-850k an hour
---
charging unpowered orbs is 450k an hour for fire and waters
---
This is less than half the list from the wiki. You have no excuse. Mid level moneymaking is fine, I‚Äôd be happy to list more if you want. Maybe think for a sec that mid level PvM shouldn‚Äôt be half as good as endgame slayer PvM and use your head. There are plenty that aren‚Äôt even listed on the wiki.
---
Sure, check my reply to the other guys comment.
---
Who else tryna fuck the ppot?
---
Lmaoooo that fact you responding makes you his bitch.
---
Diamond bolt spec doesnt just increase damage though... as you should already know.
---
Look at the wiki. When the proc goes off, it has a 100% chance to hit, ignoring all defense (even if the hit rolls a 0). So you hit through the high defense more often with diamond bolts
---
Step 1: 1/500 chance for casket
---
Step 2: 1/400
---
Step 3: 1/300
---
Step 4: 1/200
---
Step 5 and beyond: 1/100
---
Rarely does someone gift a quality meme like this.
---
Here's the thing mate, group ironman has been out as long as runescape has existed. The client drawing in a little colored helmet next to his name is not what makes him a group ironman. He's just playing the game with his friends and having fun- *that* is what makes it group ironman. 
---
*Fuck the helmet*. You don't need it lol. If you want to have fun playing group ironman with your friends *you can do it right now*.
---
Are you an Ironman? I have a f2p skiller that isn't an Ironman and I'm torn between maxing it as f2p skiller or getting combat also as f2p. Or getting memby and doing new skills. Up to base 70s atm in f2p skills on it except rc obviously
---
When was the last time Jagex released an update that was balanced on the first try? They create drop tables that devalue the shit out of gathering skills, we have to nerf or buff every update after a week of unbalanced gameplay, even when they released Zeah they had to redesign the entire continent because it was so godawful and was just a giant square. I don't trust these devs anymore, and we need to stop introducing new content into the game. Update existing content and QOL first.
---
TLDR I upvoted this for the drawing
---
Looks like Dana Pink to me
---
Same. 2 sub quests left
---
All for this. Nice suggestion!
---
Stupid suggestion next. 
---
The basilisk knight ‚Äúscandal‚Äù is not a scandal it‚Äôs a bunch of entitled man children crying over a video game item because they can‚Äôt get it and now it‚Äôs even harder to get it. 
---
A master quest is not going to produce a GRANDMASTER quest boss, which is what this would be if you‚Äôre trying to make it like vorkath. If anything the new basilisks now match the quest jormungand in mechanics more lol. 
---
Give the stupid bullshit up already and suck it up
---
Yeah cocaine and other hard drugs hijacks our brains reward system and floods our brains with dopamine in order to narrow focus on the reward: cocaine: 
---
Just saying dopamine is not what you get after but before an action of repetition/motivated learning. These addictions are simply an extreme outcome from an otherwise normal functioning brain just unfortunate that there are consequences to addictive behaviours.
---
Id pay $100 to be able to buy like a OSRS download on steam that was the entire game without online so if (or when) OSRS ever went to to shit I could just play that on my own
---
&gt;Are any of you aware that its possible to care about skilling and efficiency/exp gain without playing 8 hours a day? Theres no grey area with you ppl lmao. No you're right, anyone who has a different playstyle than you is obviously living an unhealthy NEET lifestyle.
---
Lmfao, take what I said and drive it to an absolute because you can't argue with the actual point of the comment. Do the same thing with my comment that people did to the more extreme case I quoted. 
---
No, not every skiller plays eight or twelve or sixteen hours a day, but you can't tell me that this game isn't set up to promote that kind of behavior and that it's an insignificant portion of the player base. The actual game *sucks* when held to the standard of most MMOs, and a huge portion of the player base either bots or spends a huge amount of time grinding. Look at any skill and the amount of actual time it takes to max. Look at the fucking meta that has evolved around maximizing efficiency and preventing carpal tunnel development. Look at the actual game and how much time it demands of people. It isn't healthy and you can clearly see that in a huge portion of the player base. 
---
But go ahead and pretend that I'm saying every skiller spends eight hours a day on it and use that to ignore the actual problems here.
---
Prayer flicking melee and bringing an inventory of food makes them really easy
---
30 tick delay for eating it and can't be used in combat
---
I'm not sure what you mean by cannon method, but it's just the 0 xp combat method you can see on videos from YouTubers like kempq or maulerosrs
---
They voted for socialist leaders, their fault. Same shit is happening the west
---
Hahaha wow you‚Äôre butthurt. Enjoy being a shitter who can‚Äôt get a jaw drop so you have to cry to devs to make it so you can.
---
holy shit dude
---
Wildy Slayer is the shit idk what you're on about.
---
Please look out for the thread's flair. It's humor so expect ironic/dumb comments lol
---
So what gives the pleasure in your opinion
---
You do this after that video of the dude who dresses as a lever? I‚Äôm almost tempted to try it too lmao
---
grats
---
500 hours is generous. The co op for this game being locked behind 1000 hours sort of hurts the game a bit imo . There is no mid game raids or bossing. I guess you could do KBD or maybe kq
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah that's not even remotely close to the same thing as dhide and crystal bow
---
They changed that recently, Before it used to be only crafting cape.
---
Because the experience is worth more than them to the basically non existent impact of not attending.
---
Uhm okay sweaty, like, who hurt you? You must be an incel for having THAT opinion.
---
They buffed the things that drop them, now they're a pain to grind, especially off task. Not as bad as everyone is making it out to be, though.
---
You good?
---
200-300k per hour safespotting? That's a "lot" of money huh
---
99 agility and RC here I come
---
Then try to use the same format with a glory runner so the ending would've not been so anti-climatic
---
They just added a shit ton new quests though. Do we need more right now?
---
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day
---

Why change a piece of legacy content that's been in the game for longer than most of its players, when you could, as I said and as they've been doing with most content that has BIS rewards, release a new BIS ring with harder requirements?
---
C H E S T B R A H
---
No it's an AI, he showed us lol
---
Did you even read the context? I was pointing out the hypocrisy in someone siding with pkers due to pvmer toxicity, I said nothing about how that affected me. L2 read please thanks.
---
People refer to lots of different pking builds that aren't 1 def as different types of pures
---
I.E. Berserker pures back in the day
---
I don't think you understand the base concept of wilderness PvM then. You say it increases the Risk vs Reward factor, but for who exactly?
---
 All it does is increase reward for you and increases risk for the PKer. It's supposed to be a dangerous place. 
---
If you do wilderness PvM, you should just accept the fact that there is a strong chance someone will either PK you or attempt to PK you.
---
Brainlet pker memes never get old üòÇü§£

Be glad you have 1, :(
---
Whales don't want help if you go through the MTX post you'll see a few people saying they spend $100 a month on MTX and see no problem with it the down fall as the community it's always been.
---
I feel like this may get more attention with a serious title. but good luck.
---
not sure where you're from, but the uni emails in my country have the students first and last names in them, if you do manage to get some help you could probably send them a photo of id to clear it up, i guess email the university and ask for some kind of signed proof.
---
I‚Äôm aware of that, I think you replied to the wrong guy.
---
Monkey Madness 2: Electric Monkey Boogaloo
---
nah, talked with him he is actually making a neural network
---
Fuck that makes me want to vomit
---
Power creep exisits in pvm ( most likely more than it does in pvp currently )
---
Tbow is the best dps weapon by alot the only weapon that compares consistently are both the scythe ( the upkeep value is too high so its not really worth using ) , blowpipe is up there in terms of dps ( despite serving no niche )
---
The 3 item's dps is rather similar and far more than the other tier 75 items. That should be enough evidence to warrant those weapons arent  t75.
---
Slayer helm has a 16.6% damage output and is only niche in slayer. Not to mention the fact you can still use tbow bp and scythe in slayer so idk what youre saying?
---
Slayer helm is not even close to contributing power creep when compared to those weapons.
---
Take a look at all the tier 75 items and tell me if all of them deserve to be in the same tier ( depending on dps , accuracy attack speed etc)
---
Trident of the seas - 15 mage attack tier
---
 75
---
Trident of swamp - 15 mage attack, 3 more higher hits ( the fact its the same speed should already tell you its a different tier of a weappn ) and its ability to venom .
---
Staff of the dead - 18+ mage atk , 15% mage damage bonus ,
---
Toxic Staff of the dead - 25 + mage(7 more) attack , same damage bonus % , ability to venom , a special attack to halve all melee damage ( not sure how long)
---
Thats only a few items from t75 .
---
Most of the new items have enough accuracy and dps to warrant a different tier bracket.
---
The whole "after feedback, because the community wants it, we're nerfing them!" Thing even though there's literally a polling system embedded into the game is some valid drama, imo.
---
Also, I'd suggest hiding posts tagged with "humor" for the time being. I think you're treating many of them as players actually crying when they're mostly just silly memes.
---
Cave horrors weren‚Äôt made with iron men in mind. And for such a good item it should be locked behind at least 80 slayer
---
Theres a lot of space between mid level strong and high level strong.  Barrows is the golden standard for mid level strong - and its not strong at all for high level.  As a guy in early to mid lategame, I havent done barrows for money in 7 months and I havent done it for fun in 3.
---
I hope that clarified my point.
---
Seriously people need to understand this. No mtx ever, even if it's just cosmetic shit. It will always evolve into something else.
---
Relateable. Feels good to use the gear i grind for to kill players of the opposing faction.
---
I would like to point out now that i am 3.8k kills on basilisks. 3.2k on task. I started on release, grinded for hours on end. Didn't get jaw. And then there are 50 iq idiots like sick nerd. Get jaw in double digit kc and spearheads a buff that makes them almost as tanky as bandos. Yes.
---
The t bow spawn was in February? Damn time flies!
---
You woke up at 3am to just avoid pkers?
---
Mystic hat (light) should NOT COME from a level 40 slayer monster! what the hELL!
---
holy shit, i praise you.
---
Why not just all out 0xp weekend?
---
Short answer: No  
---
  Long answer: Hahaha, definitely no. Decisions regarding monetization are handled in board rooms by C-suite executives, not by devs. The devs who execute those marching orders are just employees of the company. Shit-flinging at them accomplishes nothing. You might as well be yelling at your barista because you think Starbucks charges too much for a latte. Not only do they have zero say in those sort of decisions, but chances are they probably already privately agree with you but aren't allowed to publicly say so without risking their jobs.
---
An AI is just an advanced bot.. so I guess we‚Äôre both correct lol
---
cmon bro, you dont gotta make up stories, we all now you were dreaming.
---
Certainly, but 95% of the time people will use the word "Zerker" instead. "Pure" usually designates 1 (or very low) defence.
---
No the problem is whiny people with too much entitlement because they got killed in the games 1 pvp zone wanting the entire map to themselves. For every activity in the wilderness there is a similar activity in a safe zone that likely makes more money anyway, yall don't need the entire map let pkers have their one little corner and if you dont like the risk stay tf out
---
Why are you doing them if you‚Äôre a maxed account? You clearly don‚Äôt like them
---
DWH is all in all a decently implented item if were being honest.
---
Then again, Im sure theres thousands of irons that disagree with me.
---
Awe I‚Äôm sorry to hear it, What did they take from you?
---
Source: nothing
---
Hmmm interesting, any links to back this up?
---
Jesus Christ. If u aren't prepared to risk shit don't go in. Idk what is wrong with this community where everyone wants their hands to be held at all times.
---
I dig this idea. I think it should fill the profit spot that GGs do now, and it should come with a buff to those two‚Äôs profitability. Makes sense slayer level wise. Although the knights need to get unfucked up.
---
Currently the risk vs reward is way unbalanced in favour of the pker. This would be a way to make it more fair. 
---
Can't you see the problems that have been caused by pvmers feeling hard done by the current system? Any content that would make pvpers stronger gets voted no. A lot of people just vote no to PvP updates in general in retaliation. Clearly something is wrong with the current system.
---
All slayer partners get is the exact same task. Nothing else. It's not two people on one task. each has their own.
---
Entaro incontrol
---
The pvmer can pose a threat easily they just need anti pk gear. Also escape in singles is very easy with bulwark in the game
---
If you mean quitting social media, great idea! Amazing for mental health.
---
As for the game, so much of osrs is solo it seems silly to quit because people on the internet are silly.
---
Oh i do the same! Except its some random high % rum.
---
So then is it fair to say if you attack pvmers, be prepared for them to vote no to PvP updates?
---
Maging metal dragons / replacement for mages book anywhere you might use that / Allows you to consistently tank torag, guthan and verac when you are in tank gear while wearing it (so you will only need a prayer sip if its the other brothers in the tunnel)
---
The other day I got pked for nothing more than my bones. Anybody would think these guys didn‚Äôt get enough milk
---
Yup, we've lost a lot of content and nearly all of our reward space to monetization.
---
Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger! OMG this is so funny I exhaled through my nose.
---
Prayer flicking isnt something should need to be used to kill a mid level monster
---
That's her attractor alright
---
Name another game that lets the community decide balance changes, ill wait.
---
Why would he pick up his cannon? If its set up on the ground, cant you just retrieve it for free if you get pk'd?
---
Well the guys who do this usually get 70 prayer. Prayers extremely fast niw too. Just expensive
---
The method is a little like this:
---
Do partner slayer to get high CB Lvl tasks on your level 3, main venoms the monsters, as they die, you attack on the lvl 3 and hit a 0 but since it's last hit it gives you half the normal slay XP per the kill assist mechanic

---
You used the wrong word. Bias implies prejudice in a person's thinking.
---
What you were looking for is 'isn't a good comparison.'
---
and you can even do some nmz while you‚Äôre showering.
---
No.  Its kinda weird how the boss that drops \*THE\* melee ring can be safespotted. That being said, its osrs, not all of it \*needs\* to be challenging, even the high level stuff.
---
Being an idiot with maximum efficiency
---
Players who vote no to pvp updates because they went into a pvp zone and got attacked are bad for the game and should not be pandered to
---
Idk lmao I'm a pvmer and I just stay out of the wilderness. If I see an update that's adds something to the game that could help me pvm or adds content I'll vote for it. But just because I see an update that only adds a PvP content I'm not gonna just vote no. I'll just simply not vote.
---
What's the right answer for that?
---
If you‚Äôve only done 5 quests you‚Äôre going to have a very fun time getting the points for imbuing
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what the context is when you‚Äôre pointing out a specific example of ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù. You‚Äôre clearly upset or at the very least side with people who get upset by being told to ‚Äúsit fgt‚Äù. People who are affected by being told to ‚Äúsit fgt‚Äù are mentally unhinged, so you‚Äôre either mentally unstable or are in support of people who are. Either way, yikes, not a good look bud.
---
I got spiders on my lvl 20 account. HoW aM I MeAnT tO kIlL VeNaNaTiS?????? This game is so broken@@@@@

Theres a lot of space between mid level strong and high level strong. Barrows is the golden standard for mid level strong - and its not strong at all for high level. As a guy in early to mid lategame, I havent done barrows for money in 7 months and I havent done it for fun in 3.  1.2 mil isnt much anymore.

I‚Äôm poor so I just hold my friends ASS. They get annoyed about it sometimes but I enjoy myself.

this idea that reddit good twitter bad is so fucking ridiculous I can't even.

both of you groups of nerds need to get over yourself.

It's like watching a car crash where the occupants all know they've gone over a cliff but refuse to accept their fate, meanwhile the driver is preparing his own parachute whilst asking his passengers to have faith and keep putting money in the glove box for future journeys.

Just need 10 alts to take tank all the other monsters.

i like soloing personally more because you can get like 30 item crates at a time and as someone else said, you dont have to deal with the cancer that ensues at WT.
---
Basically anything non neurotypical is considered a mental illness nowadays.  That doesn't mean it is.  Illness implied negativeness and disability.  Neuropathy works on a scale, too.  It's like saying that all people above or below the average height by 4 inches are physically ill

That's just being pedantic
---
Just please make sure you miss shauny. He's too precious to be harmed.

So many people would just pretend to be a pvmer running around naked until a pker attacks them, rev spawns them bam full mystic and dds wielding why they fighting you back?

Nah he eats chicken every day, but with different spices. It fuels is elite gamer energy and massive biceps.

&gt;I went to bed super early on the weekend and woke up around 3am and figured id try it.

&gt;figured id try it.

reading is hard :(

you're one of the people, and the fact that you've just described an mmo as solo definitely should be the final nail.
---
=)
---
Sorry if this is suggested frequently, I don't see too many posts about it :) just a quick redesign, thoughts?
---
Wellll what you should and shouldn‚Äôt do for any monster is debatable. I was simply suggesting a method to increase your sustainability for your task.
---
Again, I don‚Äôt know much about the basilisks or what level of content they are. Best of luck!
---
You uncovered one of life's greatest and best kept secrets. I appauld you. But can you unravel the connection between ESS and pure ess?

You haven't? Fuckin casual.

I mean... in Draynor Manor... in a hidden room... ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Easy on the straw. But yeah you're right, it's only a bit of time so it's not like it's that bad.
---
However, even though getting killed is merely a minor annoyance, there are no positives to balance it out. For PvMers there's literally nothing positive to balance out the regularly occuring minor annoyance of getting killed.
---
Is it that strange for someone to avoid a game area that's filled with a regular minor annoyance, with nothing fun to compensate?

One player utilizes the games pvp zone to pvp, the other votes no to all pvp updates because they were attacked in again, the games 1 pvp zone. Your solution is to punish the player using the pvp zone for pvp? Delete this thread lmao

\+1 for breaking bad

TIL there's normally a 1k fee to go to Waterbirth

Pking clue scrollers is the dumbest fucking thing. I understand there needs to be a balance from stuff like chaos Altar, Slayer, and bosses, which is usually handled by pkers, but this meme is everything and more. I love pking, but I can only imagine some of these deep wildly pkers have probably had a stroke blowing the biggest load of their life because they killed someone 30 levels under them. Pking isn't the problem, it's the pussies that do it.
---
I can't wait to watch Rendi make a video escaping zeah and breaking the game
---
Yep- when people don‚Äôt include drop log I automatically doubt the post
---
There isn't a clear distinction though. Pure is not clear. You aren't most people, your clan of 1def pures aren't most people, you can't speak for most people's assumptions beyond the word pure.
---
Whatcha mean? Gameplay or community wise? Cause I‚Äôd say the majority of people I see in game are friendly/willing to help others. Then again I‚Äôm not in sweaty elitist clans. And there‚Äôs a plethora of late game content to do.
---
I‚Äôd be lying if I didn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm not going to burn hard for modern warfare later this month, though
---
Piety?
---
I think that's pretty neat. Wildy course doesn't see much love since you don't get any marks. It's decent xp when you actually unlock it, but not much incentive to go there otherwise
---
Oh. Btw I'm not a pker. Just a a player from 2004 when you knew if you entered the wildly you were there to fight or die.
---
&gt;Basilisks knights are ONLY for the sweaty NEETS playing 18 hours a day tick manipulating.
---
This isn't what happened. Those are the players that caused this change, not the ones using the content. They're too high-level to bother ever going there. They got it nerfed because they wanted to and bailed.
---
I did as well and got a damn basilisk head and ragequit them üòÖ it just sounded like you didn‚Äôt like them based on the tone of your original comment
---
I think you should appreciate any ASS you get

Yeah it's gonna be hard making consistent money with skilling

Making skilling bots it a lot easier than pvm bots so your work is already devalued

Please don't tease me with good content I'll never see.

---
&gt; you're full of shit. Reddit is FAR AND AWAY the single largest external influence on this game, 
---
Because it is representative  of the community.  Thousands of ideas get down voted into oblivion on this site, and the ones that survive are the ones that rise to the top.  Which is the very spirit of what this version of Runescape was founded on.  
---
Not this over representation of a small set of loud individuals on twitter.  Who have hot take 120/240 character comments on new content.  
---
Did Basalisks need changing? That is a question that should have been discussed before just changing them over night.  The Jaw was never going to stay high because +1 str for a lot of setups doesn't even get an extra max hit and the alternative bonuses offered by other helms make them clear winners.  There was no need to artificially extend the price curve of this item while simultaneously taking away content for mid level players.
---
Today there were some alternative solutions that got upvoted that could have solved this non-existent problem of a "Bis slot" item in numbers only dropping in price.  Throw it on an interesting boss that they have the model and mechanics made for like Jorgumandur.
---
Not on a jagex salary rofl
---
I agree (not btw) - it's the perfect mid-to-late game upgrade for any player. It's rare enough that it's more than pleasantly surprising when one drops as well!
---
The difference between Shamans and BKnights though is you can go to a shamans task with a blowpipe, prayer pots and zero food and if you focus you won't ever need to worry about your HP being the reason you leave. BKnights will tear you a new one and rip through your food if RNG isn't your friend

Now people can say they finally got some ASS in osrs

I only go in wildly with my clue, a spade and a dscim. I always get ice barraged. Enjoy the bones I guess lol.

OK what I meant what they never poll balancing CHANGES, like after the fact. My bad for not making that clear. I agree that we do a lot of balancing beforehand from community feedback.

Bond-age held my marriage together.

Its not a requirement to kill those things though.
---
There are some unfinished quest lines that i want completed. The fairy tale quest line, The temple knight quest line with the slugs are two that pop out instantly. Vampire slayer never really had a good sequal to it. you legit killed an elder vampire from mortania and they dont even care. Not sure if there is anything else in regards to that since i have done everything over there yet. I am sure their are tons of other story lines that could be implemented to make this game feel better. honestly i want more character involvement. All these quest seems like your just a random dude just getting a job and doing it. nothing more significant besides that.
---
I thought they added the twisted bush because it was the easiest hotfix at first, stop players from picking them up at least.
---
E: to add, I remember the clip of a Jmod on twitch randomly placing twisted bows on the floor in the area just fucking around with the chat during a development preview, but I don‚Äôt really remember.
---
same lmao then fally hard to get the mole pet and left after 100 kc
---
rushed ds2 because vork seemed easier than zulrah, got 300kc and now cant make myself do it til i get a dhcb/dhl lmao
---
I still do this but whenever I look away or switch to my inventory a pker always logs in and teleblocks me.
---
I play this game precisely because I can easily watch something else while playing.
---
Is virtual fishing experience gain a touchy subject for you.
---
I know you already are very aware of this issue, and have read your other responses on it, but I wanted to echo the issue of not being able to play my main (ironman) while playing the league. I have an anc top and hat on my main, and those recolors look awesome. But they are also said to be high cost rewards. I don't get to play much these days so if I wanted the colors I would have to basically stop all progress on my main. 
---
I know this is probably not something you have a good solution for on this first league, but if you expect to make this a regular thing then I think fixing this issue should be a top priority if at all possible. 
---
Also I know the milestones can be changed, but dude 250 raids? I only have 180 kc on my main.... Heeeellll no am I doing 250 raids on an alt. Not to mention they will be a lot slower.
---
Easily farmable is a stretch. It's 35 kills max on a boss task. Also if you're not flicking it's like 3-5 per kill count.
---
OP wanted revenants to spawn and attack pvpers who attack unskulls
---
No, lol
---
The quest has nothing to do with pvp? Just because it worked for the d pick doesnt mean making a fremmy area randomly a pvp zone just for the safe of difficulty makes 
---
sense
---
It‚Äôs a game changing item for ironmen, def should be a tough grind.
---
Unironically remove b ring (i). You afk for a couple hours and get 4 more str, its stupid as fuck.
---
That is pretty ridiculous. A lot of pkers look for noobs who skull up on pvmers and pk them. When someone was pking me at black chins one time some other dude came over and they had a long death battle
---
Hey dick nose, relax and get off OPs back
---
in the additional comments field of the recovery i did get like more and more pissed off lol, maybe that helped.
---
i think my last set of comments started with something like "idk why im even typing here, you guys just automatically deny this anyway and wont read it" lmao

aw OwO gei
---
Im not being serious. It doesnt make sense to lock the dragon pic into the wilderness either.
---
Do you have a link or the name of the official place I can find it?
---
The name is kind of ambiguous, so a Google search just gives me a bunch of unrelated stuff.
---
Also, do you have to compile it yourself?
---
Just tried prayer flicking with melee and got owned. Switched to ranged safe-spotting and thats going well :)
---
btw.. I'm mid level lol. I don't have piety :/
---
If anything it needs to be longer as it stands. It wouldn't be fun if all you ever do is the early game every league. Each league should be long enough a casual person can get to some sort of end game and enjoy the end game content for a bit. They've said this will be 3x exp rates and at 3x exp rates 2 months isn't long enough.
---
Thats a great point though, DKs are still a popular, farmable, useful for all players piece of PVM content. New content doesnt need to be fancy, crazy stuff. Abby demons: still relevant. DKs: still relevant. Barrows: Still relevant. Jad: Still relevant. All old as hell, all relevant, useful and fun.
---
&gt;just get a natty light
---
this but unironically
---
And every time they tried in any way to add MTX to osrs, it failed. 
---
When RS3 fails, they aren‚Äôt going to mess with the one cash cow they have left
---
Look ma I posted it again

Lol "spare ranger boots". With hopes like that you should just stick to clue Scrolls kiddo
---
This was more of a joke in the sense that Im not going to stop attacking you just because you're not risking anything of value.
---
I‚Äôd recommend astrals, they only require a few clicks and you can get up to 35k xp/hr. Even single astrals are decent money right now with astrals being like 170
---
But that's part of what EoC gives, right? Well, not that it's unique to EoC. But RS3 chops the protect prayers down to 50% damage reduction. Which is huge. Protect prayers still get used all the time, obviously. But they're not a "throw them on, drink prayer potions, never worry about damage" mechanic anymore.
---
And/or as someone else mentioned, make monsters/bosses just ignore protect prayers like adamant dragons because protect prayers are too ubiquitous and force too much of a DPS-scape type of playstyle across the board.
---
Absolutely perfect idea with no community backlash. 101% agree

---
The profit per kill at DK's goes down a lot if you don't have the fremennik elites done though.
---
Twitter really is horrific though
---
You still have to be careful cuz there's stuff like: they'll give you an empty master scroll book and a tele scroll, once you put the scroll in the book it links to the scroll book in your bank if you have one. Suddenly you can lose all of those scrolls, not just the one you picked up. Or something like that.
---
Trying to out-scam the scammer is exactly the kind of greedy thinking that they exploit to get your shit in the first place.

Your genius knows no bounds your highness. What an impossible feat you have done, studying for 3 years to get a bachelor degree most likely. Clearly everything you say is now ultimate fact and any heathen who questions you is an uneducated peasant!
---
&gt;But RS3 chops the protect prayers down to 50% damage reduction. Which is huge. Protect prayers still get used all the time, obviously. But they're not a "throw them on, drink prayer potions, never worry about damage" mechanic anymore.
---
50% base, but 60% with Amulet of Souls(BIS) and then you have prayers like soulsplit on top that heal you for dealing damage(can flick between the two for both effects)
---
The major reason RS3 is dps-scape is more of poor balancing that just not enough punishing mechanics. Some people can do 4000% Telos with no food or no armor or no summons, or etc just by abusing the blatantly overpowered abilities since nothing ever gets balance patched like in other MMOs.
---
In OSRS it's more along the times of just bosses not being punishing enough combined with people being able to flick prayers to block near 100% of damage.
---
And yeah, typeless damage that goes through protects is a way to go. It's why Nomad was so hard pre-eoc.

Miss you big man. Gone but not forgotten.

There are individuals that like pay to win and don‚Äôt want to do the grind.

There are individuals that don‚Äôt like that other people can pay to win.

I thought it was established that RS3 was the default a pay to win game and Osrs was the official not pay to win game. 
---
What‚Äôs all the drama now? RS3 was pay to win and became even more pay to win? Wtf, be consistent with what you want, damn.

Might have to try those with my friend we‚Äôre both like 100cb

As they absolutely should

Saves an invent space since you don't need fremmy boots 4 too

Best kill time?

&gt; Rune dragons are relatively relaxing and relatively afk, drop better loot, and you don't compete for moles.

Yeah but I don't own justiciar rn and I don't like doing rune dragons. Also, when I'm killing mole, the pet chance is nice, and I don't want to kill vorkath.

How many strawmans have you got? 100m was just a ballpark number that I threw out because we were talking about efficient Vorkath kills netting you 4m gp/h , which require DHCB (111m) &amp; Dragonfire Ward (29m). At no point did I say that 100m in the bank = beating the game, like you suggested.
---
That's what I assumed. The figure was arbitrary. No need to freak.
---
&gt;you don't compete for moles.
---
I've never had to compete for moles on 428
---
You seem to imagine lategame to be different than it actually is. Maybe one day you'll understand.
---
I said this before but got bitched by bunch of sweaty max main nerds... 
---
Just because the game is 20 years old doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt update some skills -.-
---
If you're a lvl 40 and get assigned black demons, might as well go back to training
---
Boi didn't you just post about how dry you were lmao
---
This sounds so exciting.  I haven't played osrs in a while but I follow the updates and reddit.  This would definitely make the game exciting, especially with the relics potentially changing the meta in drastic ways.  The rewards look awesome, but I am curious about the claim that the will not be discontinued.  Does this mean if the next league is in the desert that Kourend rewards will still be available for purchase at the end?  Additionally, what do I do if i'm say 20 points short of a reward I really wanted in a league?  Do the points transfer to the next league meaning I only need to earn 20 points next season?
---
Same goes for work email. So many people don't keep personal shit and professional shit separate it boggles my mind.

It's called knowing your shit. Something you're obviously incapable of.

It'd be cool if they added chess into the connect 4 room.

What happens if you get skull tricked and they smite you for the crystal bow? Is the bow destroyed or can you run back to where you died and pick it back up?
---
Two of these were caused by twitter neckbeards, too.
---
I just wish it didn't assign them to level 40s. Wildy slayer would be a lot better if maybe the masters were split down the middle.
---
For a perfectly efficient Ironman, the way I remember the guide going is that you steal cakes from ardy, get 50 firemaking and then head to wintertodt for 99 fm, then barbarian fish to 99 fishing, rc to 77 and then do bloods and souls to 99 for money and barrage runes, then a bunch of other unreasonable grinds and then the account is ready to progress with pvming and questing which are the mid/lategame
---
&gt;What if you bought the tickets months ago and already made for travel arrangements, and you'd rather not waste all that money? 
---
Then you have absolutely no idea what a protest means and you should not partake,your attitude is actually the problem, the only true method is to leave the game, you can't, your addicted.

The existence of RS3 bonds and legal swapping meant it was already in 07 by default, just extra steps.

Fuck bonds, but I wouldn't call people idiots.
---
Here's a tip for most. If you have a hard clue step in the wild, just take a spade, clue and 1 dragon dagger poison. You're only gonna need to protect from melee or mage only and they're easy to kill just spec 4 times to get the most damage in. After you have your next clue or reward just suicide back to mainland.
---
Honestly idk why people are freaking out so much lol. Most of the time the MMO communities are freaking out because games are being watered down and being made too easy to cater to the super casual. Now everyone‚Äôs mad they made something harder?
---
&gt;Cus those were made to prevent bots
---
The ardy knight changed happened because Jagex more or less admitted to have no way to tell between botters/Autoclickers and people using WMK to pickpocket ardy knights. Another contributing factor was that jagex didn't intent for ardy knights to be something you can hit max exp rate at without even looking at your computer for hours at a time.
---
&gt;they haven't done much in that regard.
---
The change forced people to use full on bots if they wanted to afk ardy knights because you can't just autoclick one spot for 6 hours straight anymore.
---
If Jagex gave everyone a mill gp by mistake and took it away you would cry that removing it was unpolled. All that was polled was them having a 60 slayer level required to kill them, I think most people though they would be closer to Demonics, atleast in how they would have some sort of mechanic not making them afk, and thats what they are trying to do.
---
Look I don't want to have to right click to use someone else's house okay?
---
Though in seriousness, jagex should allow us to reorganize certain right clicks such as for houses or barriers (ex. Olm or Hydra).
---
Lol ya. My bro got pked at the wildy course TWICE last night. He hates agility now.

Very true.

screenshots can be easily faked and runelite developer mode allows you to change username value to whatever you want (you can change ur own username to zezima etc).
---
agreed or maybe give them unique drops or better drops that are nice at low levels
---
a few ideas
---
rock slug drops rock ooze, you can use it with herblore to make a salve for yourself, when used for a brief period of time if you get hurt while thieving, you take no damage but are just stunned
---
Wall beasts now drop strength potions and spades and may drop rune claws 
---
Desert lizard now drops desert lizard meat, when cooked and eaten it boosts firemaking by 3 for a time and it counts as an extra warm clothing slot for a time when eaten, they now drop fire and mystic fire staffs as well
---
killerwatts now frequently drop rings of recoil, this due to being static and idea is being touched hurts from electricity
---
Why do people use ahk for macros instead of something like python? Python has mouse movement packages, not to mention image recognition and machine learning shit

Is ahk a lot easier to write?
---
Theres 1 type of pure. 1 def pures.

Theres also skillers, ranged tanks (60atk/65-70def/77pray), zerkers. None of these are pures like you insinuate

I legit don't understand how anyone can be ok with themselves smelling so poorly.

Then again, I'm hyper sensitive about my own smell. I'm a grown man with a beard, but I have candles and plugins all throughout my house because I dont want anyone to think I smell bad.
---
DAE Blizzard just stole Jagex's idea to release an earlier version of their game after realizing they've completely lost touch with their playerbase?
---
Oh boy, let's make training agility even worse by encouraging pkers to camp spots where players don't use gear and is the the only option that isn't trash xp/hr before 60 agility.
---
Looked better b4 imo
---
Rex is also guarded by 2 big boys and spinners.   And if you dont pay attention you can be one shorted on the way to the safe spot.
---
What
---
With boss loot too.
---
Use a poop sock instead. That way you can spin it around and hurl it like a slingshot.
---
They are completely stupid.
---
Honestly, it's painful to see how deep into the game these people are, jagleflox must be sat in the boardroom pissing themselves laughing at the complete and utter lack of balls their customers have.
---
If these people were **truly** fed up of being shat on week in week out they would have quit years ago, but they can't, and jagex **KNOW** this.
---
If Mod Roq was busy, don't think he'd be logged into the game lol
---
if you're not btw I feel for you

I missed rsmv
---
Jesus Christ this got me good lmao
---
Get your chain took in west ardy!
---
What is wrong with you people. If you‚Äôre a mid level theres plenty of other ways to make money through skilling and even PvM. Training slayer at lower levels sucks, just like every other skill in the entire game, but they payoff is huge later. That‚Äôs how it should be. Can‚Äôt believe we actually have people arguing that low level slayer deserves to make great profit when its the most profitable skill in the entire game t later levels, thats the fuckin point. If you dont want to grind 300 hours then dont, go train some other skill like farming or runecrafting, or go kill non slayer monsters that can make you money. Slayer should never be good profit at lower levels.
---
You fucking even have Konar keys and Larrans keys, where even does this strawman argument stand?

Just press space and do a forward slash saying:             /charge now guys! Then say oops

I love how Reddit downvotes you when this is 100% correct.

It was obvious, I'm up 7.5mil from the scammer. Was just curious how the story unraveled I guess.

Easy clues would be faster.

Good point, OP

I, too, dislike varied game content. Can you make another chart showcasing why Corp is a bad boss because it's different than Rex? And another that showcases why Sara gwd is a bad boss because it's different than Rex?

That's fucking illegal

Ahh that‚Äôs interesting. Makes more sense.

Cant get skull tricked when u have player attack options off ;)

I think the biggest issue isn't the buff to them. It's the fact they're incredibly slow with a shitty drop table. If you don't get the jaw, it's a complete and utter waste of time.
---
&gt; should be the final nail.
---
Quit talking about it and be about it then.

I'm sure Ron will catch up when hes done taking a shit.

Level 75 crafting is easy as fuck, cost a few mil max doing to most expensive training methods. People can go buy 10m for $6 these days. That's the definition of ez scape. And why cant you just do the hard diary? It teleports you to the mine? Or you could put a lunar altar in your house and use NPC contact.
---
You can pick up drops in PvP too, just not from other players because that would be trading.
---
I do not see your point?
---
You get drops form PvP activities such as LMS. You get all Wildy PvM drops. You get emblem drops. Emblems/keys form wildy slayer. Everything but player loot. 
---
Plenty of ironman participate in content in the wild, revs ar epacked with ironman farming its resources. Ironmen farm wildy bosses for dragon picks and other drops too.
---
Again, why shouldn't ironmen be forced to do this content if this content indeed exists?
---
That‚Äôs quite the dump
---
Yes and they know you will only learn by experiencing it yourself, so just remember that it's you making these choices, once you start listening to other people, you can learn from them instead of doing it yourself.
---
Honestly I'd stopped playing for a few months I was excited to be coming back.
---
But nah I'm good of I wanted to play on the vanilla client I already would.
---
I hate, losing so many qol things for no reason other than sweaty nerds want the game to be even more of a grind.
---
It's unfortunate your friends don't want to train slayer as much as you have, and seemingly aren't as interested in osrs as you. It may be best if you let them play the game how they want to play it versus forcing a skill on them they may not want to train. I wouldn't expect anything near a week dev time devoted to a low lvl slayer rework...hoping you find another way to keep your friends playing!
---
I mean, let's be honest. Most maxed players aren't bothering to farm them for any amount of time. They will just buy it and do more solid money making methods rather than spend potentially 10 hours on something not worth while
---
diablo 2 was good af, diablo 3 was the fuck up. and whatever shit they're doing now is prolly equally as bad
---
Why does this automaticly downloads when I clock the link... I don't like that.

---
Me: "There's nothing wrong with giving med levels moneymaking methods on par with barrows (\~1m)"
---
Other guy: &lt;disagrees, we argue&gt;
---
You, butting in: "yeah youre wrong about everything but also Med levels are anywhere between 80-100 combat, and at that level you don't need anything more than 1m/hr. "  "so really I'm agreeing with you but think we're both wrong apparently"
---
\&gt; Stop trying to justify a reason to give med levels money makers compariable to end game content, its never going to happen. 
---
Thank god, as I said, there's a large gap between 200k and 2m.  For someone so sure Im wrong about everything, you do seem to be largely admitting Im right.
---
\&gt; Barrows and Zulrah are more than enough money than you'll ever need as a med level. And no, 80 ranged and magic isnt "difficult to get". Thats about as medlevel as you can possibly be. 
---
80% to max is not med.
---
Also, mathematically base 80s place you above 100 combat - that range you yourself set for meds.
---
Sounds like I dont need to be the meme lord, you memed on yourself my bwana.
---
Based on the trend of people leaving the game over the last quarter I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if the game is back at 20k this time next year.

Umm

This amazed me to. You cant get there any other way can you? Shipperman on the dock wont let you board to there, but you can board towards fremmy trials (been a while since i played)

I was going to say that but wasn't sure how informed this sub is. Overwatch is also just TF2.

Wouldn't really matter if you're doing them as fast as possible you're barraging him to freeze him anyway. It just fucks the mid level players.

The advance group goes in and out to reset the re spawn rather than going around in a circle waiting on them.

I pvm but I don't do slayer. How can you find someone telling you what to kill enjoyable? I want to kill whatever I want to kill. You don't tell me what to do.

I like doing rooftops with girls, overtaking them and letting them look at my butt as I speed off ahead, coming back round to ram past them again.

---
I never once claimed giving these things a bis was a good idea. On the contrary, I think it was a stupid idea and whoever thought it up should get the boot. I'd have much preferred the last quest boss getting the jaw than knights. 
---
As for demonics... I see no issue with them. a) you're not forced into a slayer task to get their uniques, b) you need to pay attention to kill them and c) you need gear. They're meant to be a high-ish level demi-boss. They as an update are leagues above basilisks. Hell, people are crying about the gorilla helper going away. Don't you think that's for a reason?
---
I agree, high end items from high end content.
---
To be honest the whole this new helm being "BIS" has been rather exaggerated. Majority of the time blowpipe is the best dps and the faceguard gives no range bonus. The viable way to train combat is slayer, so you wear the slayer helm, And elite void is a lot more practical to use and great dps wise for other cases. If you camp NMZ then DH is best xp rate wise.
---
So it's really only useful for those taking max gear into raids instead of void, or those that PK in max strength.
---
That said, it is nice for the casual players to be able to obtain a nice, all be it niche, upgrade, without having to do high level content. 
---
That that said, now the basilisk knights have been buffed, they are rather difficult to kill, or at least take a long time, for mid level players. If I had just hit 60 slayer, I wouldn't even try doing them on task, in an attempt for a rare drop I consider to be more niche than BIS.
---
Id say less than a mark, since there'd be no easy way to bank and marks are worth quite a bit right? I don't really know though, I don't quite know how tickets work honestly
---
79-6=73
---
Same.
---
Sometimes it's so debilitating to lose that goal oriented mentality that I don't have any motivation to play at all and almost quit. I just have to remind myself that there is always a goal in rs and always a new grind.
---
i mean prior to nerf if you could kill 120/h which is just about doable in max melee, they were like 4.7m/h just on jaw (assuming jaw is 24m, it is actually higher now tbh). but with the kills per hour being slightly lower than 2/3 of that now, since they got a 50% hp buff and slight def buff, now it's only like 3m/h on jaw or w/e. 4.7m/h is no joke, 3m/h....is surpassed by a number of things.
---
the nerf actually took it from worth to not worth, for max mains anyway. still a very strong money maker for lower levels who can't do max eff vork/zulrah or tob
---
I honestly wouldn't mind making them more interesting but I don't see it passing.
---
You didnt scamm, he is legit 1trade doubling money.
---
i have played the game 10 years so i obviously havr nothing against the grind. i definitely agree with you. slayer has always been my favorite skill and i was excited to train it when i started oldschool now im level 59 slayer and can barely get through half a task without wanting to quit because im just throwing away my money on cannonballs and supplies etc. even if u could make 100k an hr it would at least feel like it's worth doing
---
You can get lunar altar with as low as 75 con, spirit tree with as low as 78 farming. A few hours in nmz for Brimhaven tabs. Slayer ring tele to Hajedy doesn‚Äôt even make any sense. He has literally nothing to do with slayer. Duradel is /supposed/ to be annoying to get to.
---
Level 80 is not 80% to 99. After reading that there is literally no reason to waste time arguing with you anymore, as you have no idea of how the game mechanics actually work.
---
good chance you look at reddit on your phone whilst watching a movie its not exclusive to rs
---
At least it should be. However, not sure if that's the case at Jagex
---
&gt;*All wildly content is dead*
---
I agree. 
---
PvP content might not be dead but I think future *wilderness* content's never getting off the ground. LMS, Duel Arena, Clan Wars, Castle Wars - all exist for various flavours of player-versus-player content whether you want to FFA it up, or 1v1mebro for high stakes, challenge another clan with yours, or just fuck around in mass team-vs-team. 
---
Wilderness content isn't so much "player vs. player" it's "players hunting other players" and it's not many people that really want to be on the receiving end of that. The whole high-risk-high-reward thing isn't really good on a large scale for the game's economy either - I'm sure the constant streams of coins/loot/alchables coming in off Revs does *not* help. As an individual, sure - it's risk vs. reward... but SOMEONE is leaving the caves with that loot. 
---
No matter what, the random Wilderness Wandering of 2004-2007 isn't coming back. There's ironically too many people who are too good, carrying the meta upward. Either you're spending a long time getting slapped down to learn to be on that level, or you're just food for someone who did.
---
Nor does slayer ring to terror dogs. Duradel being hard to get to is stupid there‚Äôs no sense behind that except for saying it makes sense.
---
But that's nowhere near the actual value of the drops.
---
I have over 2k kc and I averaged 5k/kc picking up and alching everything. A few friends did the same and got even less. I at least got a jaw to up that number but my buddy who had 2400kc no jaw is just effed. And he was on task about half those kills.
---
500kgp/hr is the approximate value of farming basilisk Knights.
---
Not worth it at all.
---
In years past? I've been lurking this whole year and haven't seen it until now
---
The 12k per kill without uniques does not include the b ring my dude. Yes Rex is profitable with uniques. I'm saying if you cannot collect every bone with the elites you may not end up ahead without the b ring drop.
---
Or increasing the requirements to wear bandos?
---
My washing machine also has super load
---
I explained to another person here. Just copy and pasted because it applies the same.
---
The issue is the type of grind, and what it's turned every other grind into, because of updates. 
---
I mentioned a few years ago that everyone did zulrah for profit, all day. Those very same people would then train their buyable skills, increasing the cost for alternative players, as it drives up prices. So now people that aren't willing to do the meta pvm method are suffering. Those people doing zulrah then train non-buyables by going for high xp and low gp methods, because they can make up the financial difference through zulrah. 
---
Jagex failed to implement skilling updates that followed the profit margins with newer pvm content. I understand bossing should be considered the meta at all times, but not by the gap it's been made to. 
---
The pvm updates have made skilling almost meaningless, I noticed myself only skilling to heighten the total level and have a base skilling level. Because they're not profitable, not by the same level by any means, most of the time I lost a lot of money, so what do I have to do to rebuild? Post release pvm content, again. Creates a horrible cycle and a single way of playing if you want to enjoy newer content, like I said to the other person, nobody could afford a t-bow by mining or woodcutting, unless they dedicated hours we couldn't comprehend. Only people that get close to that kind of money for newer content are people that just do new pvm content day in and day out.
---
What I'm trying to say, is a whip used to be a BIS weapon. Okay it'll take you longer affording one by cutting this, mining that... But it was still possible to achieve things you wanted by playing the way you wanted. That's not possible anymore, the ways of playing have become limited if you want to enjoy newer content
---
Sure, how he treated Zanik was wrong, but Bob's wife and kids were killed by goblin raiders. It's easy to understand why he lashes out and doesn't trust goblins.

Let's look at all the bis helms. Yep all are under 10m. Justicar is 34m and it comes from ToB and is part of a set effect which gives it more value. 
---
Before the update I'd wager 3-5m. Now probably 10-15.

It‚Äôs healthy to take a break from the hive mind, YouTube is the best honestly

yeah guys this is way too easy can we get a buff on these guys? I'm going back to raiding btw cya
---
No idea why that‚Äôs happening
---
Great, thanks
---
I‚Äôm failing to see what the problem is? The game has always put emphasis on PvM over skilling because the majority of players would rather PvM than skill but that doesn‚Äôt mean profitable skilling doesn‚Äôt exist. Hunting black chins, Zalcano now, no shit chopping Magic‚Äôs and mining coal was always worse it‚Äôs a zero effort activity vs PvM that actually has a skill aspect. 
---
I literally don‚Äôt even get what you‚Äôre trying to argue now. You haven‚Äôt played in 6 months, you stay informed via this subreddit (God Bless lol). You‚Äôre clearly disconnected from the actual game.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, ill give it a try
---
stop inflating to 20% cause you weren't happy it's actually 12.7* and you know that doesn't fit your narrative.

Damn that's just bad luck. Just gotta keep an eye on the map and world switcher at all times I guess, not much you can do when you're fighting though
---
Demonics require 69 slayer lol
---
I use redirect tablets but I‚Äôm saying slayer ring should somehow have a tele to duradel. Brimhaven dungeons not a bad idea. I know the options I have. This wasn‚Äôt a question it was a SUGGESTION.
---
You're getting weirdly passive aggressive over a game mate. It's an opinion, nothing else. 
---
Whip used to be BIS, okay it'll take longer affording one by mining for example, but it was doable. 
---
Newer items means if you want to buy it, you need to play a certain way, otherwise it's not attainable. Nobody is buying a scythe or tbow by mining. 
---
So because jagex have failed to keep skilling up with the rest of pvm updates, they've forced people to play a single way to enjoy newer content, it's really simple.
---
Excellent
---
What happened in april?
---
Do a bigger switch and go to your house after each kill to refill spec. iirc this is more efficient til you get a dhcb
---
Yeah that's why your bring like 10 bolts. Probably won't even pick them up.
---
it worked thanks!
---
I mean it does say that in the blog post.
---
I‚Äôve literally gone completely empty handed and they still kill me lol
---
Thank you!
---
I'm right, you're wrong. That's how simple it is. Sorry that everyone hates you Mr martyr
---
Zerk
---
Crazy how your stupidity demands two separate threads. The dbow is bis for one spec damage, of any weapon in RS. Keep crying that you're wrong though lol
---
The problem with the max cape variants is that they still exist and can be created for not-BIS capes. Additionally, some of them (looking at you, mage arena 1/2 capes) are super hard to distinguish.
---
Yeah, sorry to have a go at you.
---
No problem, Gratz on the pet !
---
So where do they come from if nobody does them?
---
Yeah, it's full of brainlets like you
---
Bots, never said nobody does them. You can just do things that make money 10x faster
---
my primary acc is one and thats actually what i call them too lol; i was just being pedantic as what he was saying was incorrect. the term "pure" used by itself refers to 1 def pures yeah but 2 say that there is only one type of pure is Questionable cus zerkers and 13 def/initiate/def pures ARE types of pure
---
Lmao, why does there have to be an incentive for the pker in every situation? You're  already busting a load over bones on the ground after a kill, why does there need to be more?
---
Wasn't that the style of the original Twisted Bow that players hated? Anyway, while I don't think that looks bad, if the TBow does get an Orn Kit, I'd rather see it do something a bit better than swapping the colors. More of an Obby Maul or Fury Orn than a Dark Bow recolor...
---
This Is why I strictly stick to Skilling for money making. It's too much of a gamble with this stuff. RNG and such.
---
DO YOU NOT HAVE A PHONE?
---
Absolutely.
---
I'm comparing it more to similar upgrades that offer similar stats.
---
Ferocious gloves for example. Require ds2 to have, higher stats, and come from a 95 slayer boss. Yet are ~8m. They're a similar upgrade over b gloves as faceguard is over neitz and serp.
---
That's the reasoning I have on why it will settle to where I think it will.
---
