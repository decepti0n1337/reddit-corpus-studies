Yup. Pray mage and use super antifire for full protection.

You're just an idiot, that's all. If you were dumb enough to think that someone would pay 90m for a lance AT G.E when they can literally buy one for like 5m cheaper at the EXACT SAME LOCATION then you were probably too dumb to actually confirm they put up 90m &amp; you deserved what you got. No sympathy.
---
Been stuck at 99cb because I don't want to get to 100 without barrows gloves. Finished Legends to get my 175th qp just to find out I still need to do Desert Treasure. Taking a little break because I fucking hate questing lol.
---
Can you name a successful game where you lose all your shit if you die in a PvM instance? Legitimately curious because this sounds retarded and like it would drive everyone interested in getting into high level PvM away.
---
which part

Bet he think being trans means scarfing down hormone pills and chopping your dong off.

CPPS.me is the actual biggest one.

OSRS is virtually singleplayer anyway. In fact, more often than not, non-instanced content in OSRS makes you more antisocial because you don't want anyone crashing.

Last week, the community had us [complete Monkey Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o_W9eJE1GE&amp;feature=youtu.be) and achieve the stats to wield a Dragon Scimitar, time to see what's in store for next week.

I'm hoping for a biiig desert expansion south of Menaphos that is incredibly hard to traverse due to constant sandstorms, roaming high-level monsters and lack of minimap

Puzzle pirates was fun af

If he‚Äôs still looking to get the rune crossbow as a direct drop. There‚Äôs another way he could get it with imps too, though it‚Äôs also unlikely
---
Prefer to use original client when doing Bossing.

Funnily enough I feel Puzzle Pirates is a game that can straight up be amazing if it was adapted into a mobile game.
---
It was ironic i didnt want to buy a super expensive setup i have around 70m at best i cant afford that setup unfortunately
---
How much money?
---
Check out the wiki's money-making guide, maybe kill chaos druids in the wilderness part of the edgeville dungeon, and collect herbs. Wear dragonhide for better mage defense.
---
I know that you might not want to hear this and it doesn't exactly answer your question, but with such a low combat level your money makers will not be very efficient. [This link](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide) is to the wiki's list of well-known moneymakers. See if there is anything that you have the stats for and go for it. Beware that a lot of moneymakers that don't have stat requirements require a large capital to start. 
---
What do you need cash for? Just gear and stuff? In that case I totally understand wanting to get some early, but you will probably be better off in the long run just using what you have right now to up your stats so you have access to methods that won't make you want to die.
---
Till his alt got the 10m deposit. ;)
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be made easier for high combats but you shouldn‚Äôt have an advantage for being a low combat if anything it should be harder for them.
---
Not if you go to my Snip-Snap guy, I'll give you his card
---
Get Fishing/cooking or mining up. Most skills are money. They just take a while to collect.

Someone's triggered. ü•ö
---
I afk'd wcing guild on an alt and always saw the same guy there, he even was present when I hit 99.
---
We never exchanged a word, best friend I ever had.
---
So? You realize when you try to remove 2FA from an account you need to verify you want to remove it through email. Passwords not being case sensitive doesn‚Äôt make a difference on osrs. No one is being hacked by being brute forced because of the delay after a couple failed attempts. So your 2 points aren‚Äôt really security flaws. Exactly what I was talking about that this sub likes to circle jerk blaming jagex.
---
Classic. Started in 2002 and played until about 2006. Made a return after mobile release
---
I stared at that for 5 minutes trying to figure out the scam haha
---
Fake as can be
---
Np. Also do animal magnetism ASAP if you plan on training range. It will save you a lot of money in the long run.
---
Agility shortcut for the win
---
Like he said, intense pkers. You were a god if you had barrage when castle wars was at its peak. My dragon long got hard seeing them in action but still couldn't pierce their armor.
---
My god. Can i commission him for my character aswell?
---
Change it to the Firemaking icon.
---
Goed gedaan Tom üòé
---
Please do! I didn‚Äôt even ask him to make me this! I just woke up and he tagged me in it, honestly made my day. Feels good to feel good.
---
You dont need 2FA to log onto the runescape website and you dont need the 2FA to disable the 2FA. And even with that there is no delay. Also passwords aren't case sensitive.
---
It would be fine if there was a 7 or 3 day delay just like removing a bank pin bc it allows you to react and catch anything bad in time. But other people don't like the downtime for when you swap phones.
---
But just my opinion, who swaps phones that often? And if you do, haven't you learned how to use cloud based authenticators or have hardcopy backup codes for it. 
---
2FA is good and should be required for all forms of log in. Another problem is that if this is implemented and you dont want to wait and dont have any codes then you have to contact support to recover your account. And some people dont know their own recovery info. Personally i think thats their fault and they should just wait if they dont know it.
---
Idk my 2 cents.
---
Can‚Äôt do Kebbits but he can do swamp lizards at 29. He‚Äôll prob do implings from 27-29 and then swamp lizards until 99
---
Could Mod Kieren please finally release ToB drop rates?

most efficient is str then atk, don't worry about def if you plan on burst/barraging slayer tasks.

I dropped it after the first trip, just doing a weapon/cape switch now, been too poor to afford an upgrade from dragon since I did the 83 con/ 82 herb grinds

"it won't be too long to grind, maybe like a month"
---
The first quote you mention he never said ‚Äú*all* games‚Äù. So again how is Crysis a good comparison? If I said some berries are large, I wouldn‚Äôt then choose the smallest berry as an example, would I?
---
Compared to games that are actually similar to OSRS (because again, he didn‚Äôt say *all* games, so logically you would compare it to a similar game rather than the one game that is apples to oranges) like 2007 WoW, you find that they have very similar low detail graphics. Huh, maybe that‚Äôs just what graphics looked like back then [in MMORPGs and not triple A titles]. 
---
I added that last bit in to help you out since you‚Äôre so retarded you completely lack any ability to infer what he‚Äôs actually trying to say, and just continue repeating what you think he means.
---

If this is true then trading is compromised.

I'm a fan of spinning bowstrings. Flax is like 2-4gp at the grand exchange and bowstrings sell for 120-130gp each. Otherwise kill greater demons. Rune drops. Also ranging blue dragons and taking home all the bones and hide makes 500-600k/hr
---
Yeah generally when people get caught botting this is the post they make saying it was all jagex and they never did anything wrong they are a good boy and deserve their account back
---
it's also pretty crazy that he's the most popular content creator in game atm, and it's still only half a million views in a week. rs feels like such a big part of my life atm but when you really put it in perspective, it's such a small community.

---
Not exactly an impressive drop but I got 4 artefacts from 8 mammoths last night for slayer. One was back to back as well
---
Damn wish they implemented this for pet drops in OSRS. Most pets on OSRS are just people getting lucky low KC drops.
---
In crafting, if you want to do magical jewellry, you have to enchant them with magic. I think in case of making magical equipment, it's more about imbuing the robes with magical energy, than making the robes themselves, which warding would do. So not literally crafting.
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs a good beginners guide. Well done man
---
So, what's your plan to rebuild? Are you going to go for RFD reqs first, or are you going to bot another game and cry when you get perma'd from yet ANOTHER game?
---

---
Damn would love to just don‚Äôt have any weapons üòÇ I‚Äôll keep that in mind though thanks
---
Not necessarily opposed to a medium level DFS, but the DFS itself has already crashed to basically nothing because of its limited use, so this would only really benefit non-members. And the shield needs a bit of a nerf, it has higher stats than the uncharged DFS and has no negative attack bonuses unlike the DFS.
---
idk man, I sold somebody 50k blood runes the other day for 400 each and that is definitely too good to be true.
---
Spend 5 minutes on second trade window making sure you have the right items and amounts and you likely won't get scammed
---
the saddest shape of all.
---
Jagex did try to remove runelite but the backlash was to much they caved, i did not use it until they "green lit" the project after removing some questionable plugins and now review all new plugins to ensure its okay in their eyes and not game breaking. 
---
The use of all third party is against ToS BUT runelite and osbuddy possible konduit also have all become a grey area where jagex dont mind the use of them with exceptions and all should be used at your own risk to account security/possibility of being flagged by the system.
---
Lets add an entire skill for range equipment as well then? Gotta inject the ranged energy into the dhide for my RP.
---
Give me 1 reason why meleeing bandos isn't as good as range
---
My plugin was pulling information based on my current equipment, prayer and poison status and marking safe areas based on the range of my range gear mostly
---
Damn op I thought you publicly admitting to being poor was bad. And then I saw the bountiful amount of edgy racist posts. If you hate yourself that‚Äôs fine but please stop being an inconvenience for regular people

I would like a new hops patch tbh. Yanhillian hops are more profit per patch and quicker

if you can get ahold of a silver sickle, you should be able to lol, mort myre fungi

Could never get it to work on dial up for that reason
---
Not asking for my account back. Do you see any link regarding any information about my account? I just want Jagex to either follow their rules or adjust them accordingly.
---
Here's the problem - if you're doing efficiencyscape, you can't really type. If you're doing slayer or some other PvM, you're either in an instance or hopping worlds so you don't have to compete for mobs. A lot of skilling activities are similar, like hunter, most methods of mining/woodcutting, etc.
---
A lot of the game is just set up to be antisocial. Conversely, look at Wintertodt - an activity where you often have time to type without reducing your efficiency and there are usually tons of people around. Lots of chatting goes on there. Now, Wintertodt isn't exactly the most thrilling content in the game, but if more skilling activities were set up similarly to Wintertodt the game would definitely feel more social again.

&gt; You dont need 2FA to log onto the runescape website and you dont need the 2FA to disable the 2FA. And even with that there is no delay. Also passwords aren't case sensitive.
---
Am I understanding this right? You don't need 2FA to disable 2FA, and disabling 2FA is instantaneous?
---
If I'm understanding that right, it literally 100% invalidates the purpose of 2FA...

You don't understand how the "we can alter this contract at any time" part of all ToS documents work, do ya?

That's what the sequel to monkey madness 2 really should be. Some sort of journey to the underworld or time travel scheme, probably with an endgame "whatever it takes" reference.
---
It's almost like that if someone is paying for a service that the company providing the service needs to follow rules and regulation regarding the service they are rendering. This isn't rocket science. There are terms you agree to in anything. If you sign a document for a loan you are stating that you will repay the said loan in the said period of months and as long as you oblige by those rules then there is nothing to worry about, but when a loan provider goes outside of those rules and takes actions outside of the agreed upon documentation then there are repercussions that can be taken on the client side.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In this case Jagex is going outside of the bounds of it's rules and allowing some 3rd party clients and plugins to exist and not others which is 100% against the rules of Jagex itself. Either they follow the rules they have stated or they change them. It's quite simple.
---
Yeah and you can get mage armor off monsters I guess they've had warding the entire time?
---
Yes I guess you are correct, it is their IP but I realize that they should be adhering to their own rules or update them accordingly. Seems like a shady business practice for a multimillion dollar company.
---
He‚Äôs been banned for botting in the past he said, so I wouldn‚Äôt doubt he was doing it again. 
---
Sorry, the ‚Äúhacker‚Äù botted

That‚Äôs what I want to find out. How was this even possible? I don‚Äôt even have an email..

It's because OSRS uses a single core even you if have a multi-core system.

Whenever people claim this it‚Äôs almost always not true considering they‚Äôve been hacked. How about data base leaks? Your email or password combo for rs or email been leaked?

This is a joke that has no bearing either way on his views, though demographically speaking hes likely either to be not a fan or neutral towards brexit.

Gz

This was scim times though, hes now got a whip to speed up kills.
---
Nieve vs duradel? Opinion?
---
Same thing happened to me(2277 with 4b), you might aswell make a new account or just quit because they will recover it over and over again until Jagex fixes their shit.
---
I think a total skill level for f2p worlds would work best.

Wonder if he‚Äôs playing on RuneLite. Haven‚Äôt heard anyone getting hacked using Vanilla Client likes this yet

The only people buying shit outside of the ge are scammers. Sure some have hit their limit but most of these are scammers anyway, and they certainly wouldn't be trying to buy just a single item.

My guess is that he changed it to like 9m or something and all the 0's in the final screen made it difficult to read with your massive 'free 5m' boner blocking your vision.
---
Now here is a cool idea: a runelite plugin that auto-screenshots any accepted trades over X million gp value so we could conduct scam autopsies.
---
because why waste dev time on ironmen
---
Then he can play the game
---
ur a holy wizard harry; grats bro
---
Netflix, better computers and better internet also killed the multiplayer aspect. Nowadays we are all on Netflix or doing some other shit while playing the game. I can't even count the amount of times I've went afk.
---
I would say personally I'm more social now compared to how I was back when I played as a kid but the main thing is that I'm more social on other platforms like Discord or Twitch chat instead of inside Runescape.
---
 **"Jagex Product(s)"** is used as shorthand for our online games including all Jagex websites used to play those games and products published by Jagex on behalf of third parties.
---
Again please read the entire ToS before posting. Products relates to the game itself. Not the accounts themselves.
---
A lot of people say theyre "trying to help the community." You slipped up somewhere, most likely botting or you have a stream that you went live on and forgot about streaming your login info.
---
"Hackers" dont just find any random account and hack into it.
---
What is even going on? This is very difficult for other people to follow along. What do these aliases mean? Were they in trouble for other things?

Man I miss jadinko hunting, that was such a nice change from chins, didn‚Äôt see many bots there either

It is ridiculous. I argue that getting hacked in the first place is ridiculous. Like wtf are you clicking? This is 2019 get smart cmon

Are you actually intelligent enough to understand that you have no ability to have a complex thought inside of that thick skull of yours? I'm not sure if you're blatantly an idiot or just passively. Thank you for your unintelligible thoughts that have been added to this post. Please refrain from speaking as all others around you would sure like to keep their brain cells in tact, and judging from what you say the people around you probably need them almost as much as you.

It's near the amount of times these posts come up and get completely ignored by jmods

Please remove this post. It‚Äôs showing Authenticator numbers. Not safe.
---
Because hacking a big streamer is too noticeable. It would cause a lot of unwanted attention. Whereas 2bil from a nobody is safer, especially with how Jagex is now on account security and customer support
---
my account was originally hacked through a database leak(my fault because I didn't know and didnt change my info), then again during the jed drama(not my fault since jagex gave me my money back).
---
niether times were because I had a virus or clicked the wrong stuff
---
It's usually not easy to scour the web for linked information. "Hundreds of miles" is not worth the hours it could take when there are banks 10x bigger.
---
You probably also don't make yourself a target, and that helps
---
Remember, Data is only useful if they know how to analyze it...
---
Journey? I wouldnt call a mindless grind a journey
---
Unwanted attention? Not like the hacker ever comes out and says who they are. And all these people post on reddit every time they are ‚Äúhacked‚Äù.
---
Good luck man. Been hacked before, it's stressful. I felt so grimy after I got my account back having someone else touch my bank.
---
Saradomin godsword or guthan set.
---
Unlocking reserve prayer aswell with sgs can recover very few points it uses.
---
Last time the mods just deleted the thread before we got a smackdown.
---
All right, so after some reading it seems you have been poor with security in the past and even now.  I just saw you say that you do not have a bank pin nor do you bank your items when you logout. I wouldn't complain about security when you are not using every security measure. 
---
Anyhow, in the past it seems that you gave enough information for someone to hack your account. I can't say specifically what you did that gave the information to hacker but it must have been a good amount as he can recover your account. Now obviously I cannot say you bought this account, but the fact that it was botted on before sounds like it might have been a throwaway account that got sold. I could be very well wrong so let's just assume you are being honest. 
---
So you gave away enough information to the hacker, he hacks your account very easily because of poor security and pretty much bots your account into oblivion before it is banned. You appeal for this and recover your account. You then continue to play on this account and try to impliment better security. Everything seems fine until you are hacked again. Okay, so after two years you are recovered and screwed again. This seems fishy to me and seems plausible that you bought this account and the original owner recovered it from you or you decided to rwt your 2.3b. Assuming you are honest, this did not happen and this dude randomly recovered you two years later.
---
You're question seems to be how you had no alert of the authenticator... well just think how you had no alert. The individual clearly has enough information to recover you're account, so he most likely has access to email accounts and such (he can disable then enable while deleting emails about, essentially making it look like nothing happen). This goes back on your piss poor security that you still continue to have. 
---
So overall, because of giving out a lot of past information to this man, he can recover your account forever until the recovery system flaws are fixed or jagex denies account recovery for your account. Essentially, your account (that is if you are being honest) is unplayable as it will always be able to be hacked. Also, you are 100% not telling everything because some things are not adding up. I actually had someone I know have this exact situation happen to them recently, found out they bought the account...

Skilling beyond quest requirements has no use and the only reason to do it is for the sake of it or because you have nothing else to spend your miserable life doing
---
The only thing I can think of is me logging in at a friends house and playing on his computer. But he‚Äôs also an avid player and is very secure himself. I suppose it‚Äôs possible his computer is compromised but he‚Äôs a tech guy and keeps his stuff secure too and I think that‚Äôs very unlikely. Honestly, I‚Äôve ever RWT or anything like that.
---
Damn why do all of you jagex nut huggers come crawling out of the woods with your idiotic assumptions and pedantic suggestions? Even if this post is entirely fake, which it probably isn‚Äôt, it does no harm and would only serve to have jagex strengthen their account security system which would help YOU. Why come in here with your faux genius observations of ‚Äúhurrrr time hurrr‚Äù.
---
Yes, play RS3 if you want a social game
---
Bro, even if nobody knows who did it if a big streamer got hacked that would cause uproar and jagex is forced to attend to the matter, hence the unwanted attention. All these people posting hacked is attention, but people forget about it eventually. Now if someone like mmorpg got hacked, that would cause huge attention and jagex would definitely look heavily into the matter

The point is 99% of these post on Reddit a Knox comes in and proves that op bought/ sold the account .

&gt;Honestly I‚Äôm probably done with the game anyway.
---
Then what is the purpose for making this post? I can't imagine an answer that would satisfy you if that were the case.
---
Crafting is already a bloated skill, and it is used for creating range gear. Crafting is to range as smithing is to melee as warding would be to mage.
---
Move on from the email. That's not it.
---
Smack down means that they are upvoting incase you are lying/bought the account in the past. In that event they want to see the JMOD smack down on you
---
Any chance you pissed off a girlfriend/boyfriend recently?
---
&gt;clients like runelite+ are basically just pushing jagex to take a stance on private plugins. like ahk abusers did eventually. cheaters gunna try to fight legit ways to cheat.

so basically, this is overpowered to cater to lazy players &amp; cheaters to exploit game mechanics and pvp mechanics? Thats what I got from what you just replied. Also, thank you.
---
Mate your computer is compromised. Even with security it‚Äôs still easily possible. Time to wipe your drives and your routers and any computer connected to your wifi as a worm can stay bouncing between computers for years. Only way to detect these kinds of bugs is being extremely advanced with computers. So take the easy route because it‚Äôs obvious he monitored you for awhile before committing the act that way he could get it all. Also no more porn or saving reddit photos on your devices.

Did you even read that? The hacker had a ton of info on the account to fool support into letting him recover it. Only person that could've given out all that info was the op.
---
reusing the same information for things you consider valuable probably isn't the best idea no matter what, no db leaks are on anyone but the company responsible. 
---
blizzards system works, but it's incredibly abusable. duping through that system was/and i assume still is pretty damn easy so i can definitely see jagex not wanting to take the time to implement all of that for a game where there's a lot more motivated people considering the irl value of gold compared to in wow. 
---
complex passwords would be nice but bruteforcing isn't a problem after the removal of the companion app where you could consistently attempt logins. 
---
obviously there's some pretty damn easy shit they could implement but they seem really reluctant on any of it for whatever reason, people have been giving them basic shit that would help quite a bit with acc security for years and it falls on deaf ears so at this point it's pretty much on the user to be responsible for his account security (which it should be anyways)

Shortly after showing off the new Gielinor mousemat, the stream was hijacked by super-intelligent hackers from this subreddit. They maintained control of the stream for upwards of 20 minutes to broadcast google image searches of crabs smoking cigarettes and ramble about why the developers should be working 24/7 on whatever anyone is mad enough to make a thread about on any given day. Once Jagex regained access to their Twitch channel, the mod team was so touched that they decided to work full time to cater to reddit users, and quickly announced that Q&amp;As would stop and all VODs would slowly be deleted over the coming weeks so that this new workflow could be more easily accepted and ingrained in the OSRS team.
---
I‚Äôll never understand how people manage shit like this, clearly you must‚Äôve done something wrong, been hacked before? If so instantly they know your username, pissed off the wrong person? RUSSIANS HACKING OUR GAMES NOW?

---
That would benefit the upper echelon of OSRS players so much further ahead and may create an issue among low-mid level or experienced players. Would make sense, but the 100k coin sink/interest of potential drops among players attempting is a way of agreeing with both sides I guess.
---

---
\&gt;We shouldn't have to bank all our stuff every time we log off on the off chance we get hacked randomly. 
---
It's not possible to ''get hacked randomly''. You have to be a real dumbass by downloading shady shit, getting phished or share a ton of information under the same name as your account to be hacked. It's literally always your own fault if you get hacked, no way around it.
---
As far as what I can tell, he's saying that you're associated with at least 2 people who have been banned for botting or hacking or something in the past, and what I can find online seems to support that you at least used to know these people, but this dude talks like he knows significantly more and I'm curious
---
it's a friends baby mamma lol
---
Means he‚Äôs probably against it, people in cities/London as a rule were against brexit, those out in the country were for it.
---
Unless you have a specific email address that you only use to register for one game and the game company hasn't been hacked or sold your informations, chances are your email is compromised and there is a chance it's been hacked.
---
Now I agree there are things you can do to make it difficult/not worth the hassle but nobody is 100% safe from being hacked and the companies you are trusting with your credit card info/personal informations has a responsibility to safeguard them as best they can.
---
That sounds like your answer right there.  They had previously been on the account, so were able to recover it.  If they paid membership on the account or had access to the account for any amount of time they have a legit case for recovering the account.  Jagex didn't flag that the account had previously been compromised and botted on.  This is a clear case where an optional recovery delay would make a huge difference protecting accounts of dedicated players.
---
At the same time you should be paranoid about putting that much cash on an account thats been compromised before.  And also a bank pin is essential for protecting most valuables in situations like this.  Hopefully Jagex gets back to you in a few hours when they get into office but it looks like there were holes in account security on your end as well as theirs.
---
So another password?..
---
Why not add 3 passwords! Just in case.

Ah thats understandable then

He said it was hacked today, so I highly doubt it

I knew the kundrumb guy like 12ish years ago and I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since he vanished. The other guy I have no clue who he is. I don‚Äôt see how this has anything to do with Jar of Swamp anyway, since there‚Äôs no link between the two accounts. I played gangstuh44 during rs2. I made Jar of Swamp when oldschool was released with completely new emails and info.
---
/r/wellthatsucks
---
This person mentions in another comment that the account has been hacked previously and recovers along with needing to appeal a botting ban at the time. If your account was ever compromised in the past, you should add every layer of security possible.
---
I think I'll save my comments before jagex comes here and says what happened. If they don't say anything I'll assume it's their fault. Meanwhile, no simpathy or hate towards you because I don't have enough info yet.
---
Hell yes. I also did this for cheat codes on my N64, Gamecube, etc.
---
Let me try and understand this... So you care to share it with people, but don't care what they have to say?
---
He got his account recovered and didn't get any email notification, someone is deleting the recovery emails.
---
That would make sense,but they will not do that unless they were to entirely scrap their idea of warding as a new skill. I highly doubt they'd do that after the work they've put in to try and make this specific skill.
---
People remember hard clues as being worth doing from back in the day when all cosmetics were worth tons of gp. Now almost all of the rewards are garbage and even the good rewards aren't worth much. You can make more money buying random shit from shops and selling in ge per hour then doing hard clues. They're more of a fun distraction or a thing to do to hit a goal then something to do for serious profit.

Yeah true I missed that bit. 2.3b bank no pin is brave haha.

Was looking for this in this thread, i was thinking the same thing.

Here we go boys, to the top!
---
That‚Äôs honestly what I think happened because they did put membership on it because when I got the account back it was killing green dragons and had a few days membership left. I just want to hear the explanation Jagex gives regarding the matter
---
I liked the idea of having a certain total level to be able to upgrade an emblem.. Yes it kinda sucks but it'd combat the emblem Farmers. Looters in but too worried about.

He also killed over 20k shamans on his maxed uim and didnt get a dwh.

Even if you don't bank everything you are still protecting most of your bank.  Outside of something like raids you will at most have one set of expensive gear out.  I make a point to bank my cash stack when I log out at the GE.
---
RemindMe! 12 hours
---
Sad by who's standards? I never had to use 2FA because I'm careful with my passwords
---
Im fairly confident if someone has 2FA on runescape, that u/gangstuh44 has it on his email...which would mean...no.
---
Recovering accounts has absolutely nothing to do with knowing a user‚Äôs password. 
---
People hack accounts by browsing online OSRS communities looking for people posting pictures with their username. 
---
The next step is finding their email address, which can generally be done through more in depth searching for their social media usernames/handles, along with their RSN‚Äôs and any other information they have disclosed in posts. 
---
If in the course of the search they find enough information to establish a general timeline of account creation and enough information to appear as the account owner, they will proceed with recovery attempts. 
---
It‚Äôs probably safe to say that recoveries fail for most attempts, but hackers specifically target high value players and keep information on them for long periods of time, and in extreme cases even do some social engineering to get enough information. 
---
Authenticator delay aside, the number one thing Jagex can do is completely revamp their recovery system. I‚Äôm not suggesting any specific fix, but they can certainly do better than the existing system.
---
Sucks to see that everyone here is so unsympathetic, everyone just wants to see a smack down. Who cares. Just give the man some answers and give him the closure he needs. Please don‚Äôt assume everything is RWT/phishing or bought account

I believe Justiciar was made to resemble Torva, but people were hardcore not wanting any str bonus on it because they didn't want to devalue bandos.  I do think it would be cool to have more BIS items instead of just leaving it at bandos/arma for eternity, but it does have to be done carefully.  Even something as more def bonus/atk bonus and same str bonus as bandos would be cool.

Maybe you did get an email but the hackers had access to your email and deleted it before you saw it?

Antonin Scalia (Supreme Court judge) was murdered by Hillary Clinton. Man was found w a pillow on his face and announced dead by a medical examiner before he was even looked at. Wikileaks published a email from John Podesta where he talks about wet works at the vineyard. That is a euphemism for assassination.... Scalia was staying at a hotel next to a wine vinyard... he traveled w Hillary‚Äôs friend and was killed so Obama could replace and implement a democratic Supreme Court judge.

The Russian troll plan was to cause as much shitfests as possible, and it worked mostly well.
---
I've secured the account for you. I can see that you've submitted a recovery for it and this should be granted in a short while by our support mods.
---
Unfortunately, it looks as though the email that you had registered on the account is not as secure as you had hoped. The hijacker used this email to recover your account (rather than going through the manual recovery system). I recommend taking some time to secure your email and/or create a new one that is not affiliated with anything other than your OSRS account.  I'd also recommend checking the email on a website such as haveibeenpwned, to try and identify how it was leaked.
---
I've begun the process of tracking any wealth that was taken from the account. I'll ban any hijacking/real world trading accounts that have received or sold the wealth. I have also made the anti-hijacking team aware of your account so they can fully investigate the person responsible for the hijacking.
---

They have poor options to remedy the situation some people are in.  People get doxed and end up having their accounts recovered forever because Jagex ask questions in a recovery page that a basic dox will cover.  Anyone who streams is extremely vulnerable.  People shouldn't have to change other online practices because Jagex's recovery system allows someone to get access to your account because they know your current ISP and your account is 16 years old.
---
One example of this when an ISP has a connectivity problem with Jagex (such as last week, northwestern USA was offline for 16 hours).  Anyone who said they couldnt connect or asked if other people could connect, in a discord, inadvertently gave away their ISP and probably don't even realize it.  If someone says they're from certain states, they may have narrowed the possible ISPs to 1-3 options.
---

didnt know that, good thing i had agi 99 b4 rc 77 lmao

Thank you, Weath! I checked haveibeenpwned and it said there was no breach for the email that I have listed as my linked email. That‚Äôs why I was confused. I created the email after the first time I was hacked, and two step authenticated it. Any advice on how to proceed going forward to ensure optimal security?

No it means you've used up all your RNG

It's fine by rules to login to his account, although I wouldn't play on it or store any amount of wealth on it because he has every single detail needed to recover his account whenever he wants to have free progress made by someone who isn't him. Stick to your own account, maybe use his as an alt or something and trade money you make to your main frequently.
---
Lol all this effort is not worth it for 90m man....

A general rule of thumb is the black market value of gold in OSRS is around $1USD mer million in game gold.
---
2.6 billion gp is roughly around $2300 USD.
---
Another genral rule is GP in OSRS can be earnt in a number of ways but vary from around 500k-5 million GP per hour - depending on the type of account. Higher level accounts make a lot more money.
---
Judging by around 2.5m/hr farming for gold, this would equate to around 1,040 hours of EFFICIENT goldmaking hours.
---
Oh sorry I meant *******

Its more like saying she got mugged walking down a dark alley and walked down the dark alley again cause its a shortcut.  The cops can arrest criminals and prevent crime, but there are also some simple things you can do to avoid getting robbed like locking your front door, your back door, and your windows, and staying out of bad neighborhoods at night.  It might take a few extra seconds to lock your door, but its worth it.  Same thing with a bank pin.
---
He still got robbed and I feel bad for him but there are supposed to be three layers to protecting your bank and he was missing one and the other was compromised, and he knew it.  Jagex could have also probably prevented this with an authenticator delay, but thats not bulletproof.
---
This is the exact reason i opened this thread, i'm disappointed it's not at the top somewhere
---
You only need to not be the lowest hanging fruit. It's not like the Chinese government is suddenly going to target your account. 
---
If you're being directly targeted your biggest weaknesses are going to be social engineering (so keep your shit to yourself) and password reuse.
---
Idk, I'd fight someone in max gear any day, chances are they're going to lose eventually and lose bank. Especially if they were using a ballista, that's just begging to be antirushed.

I think the optimal account security is just ensuring your account isn't worth hacking.
---
My friend made a new account with his free Twitch Prime membership, and the account was compromised a few days later but somehow he ended up with more gp than he started with.

Came here for this. I want to say the amount of gold is pretty similar as well, no? I'm likely not remembering the details of that story correctly but it is still a funny coincidence at least.

No _detected_ viruses or keyloggers.

I don't really think that's a great idea. Convenient, yes, but why should someone who grinds low level bosses like mole, wildy bosses, or bosses that drop quick pets be able to get something like an Olm pet or Inferno pet without the huge learning curve and grind it'd take to get those? Something I would be open to, however, is making a pet always drop on their expected rate and remove the RNG from it. Pet hunters would never have awful RNG that stops them from getting a pet and those that have pets would then hold a symbol of their commitment to a piece of content
---
He says it's 2fa sooo
---
Yes, I know. And?
---
Complain about the shithole recovery system that leads to all these posts in the first place.

Although, I also think that because of all of the existing pets already in the game, this also wouldn't be a good option
---
Don‚Äôt use Yahoo, AOL or whatever. These websites don‚Äôt stop malicious login attempts. Use Gmail or Outlook and you should be fine (they use IP recognition)

osrs gold hasn't been $1/m in years

So basically you‚Äôre going to send the recovery information to a hijacked email?

Very unique style. Great job.

Lmao dude. That's 100% on you.

Good job.

Getting 2.3B can take years or mere minutes depending on the way you get it. If you try and get it from PvM or money-making through various skills it would take months at least (unless your insanely lucky and get some of the rarest drops in game). However most people that acquire massive amounts of wealth do it through staking, which is just duelling other players betting large sums of money and that way you can get rich really fast or really poor even faster.
---
You gonna pay up now or..?

Osrs is a new game that came out in 2013 meant to resemble how the game used to be. The modern RuneScape is the one you used to play that was updated over the years

I had the same thing happen to me 'bout a month ago now. Lost 4.5b, I made a post about it but got 0 upvotes, so no one over saw it.

&gt; Unfortunately, it looks as though the email that you had registered on the account is not as secure as you had hoped. The hijacker used this email to recover your account

From what Weath said it seems like regular support would have worked for OP and that he was just impatient. of course if a massive post on reddit is shaming them they see it as a priority to set things straight.
---
Did OP have a Yahoo email address?
---
How did you come to that conclusion?
---
... you had the wrong email written down?
---
Something tells me your unbiased facade is just that - a facade. And you're just getting a hardcore boner over some armchair detective adrenaline you're feeling.
---
Be careful with how strongly you oppose OP. You can very easily overstep into harassment territory - which even if OP is RWT'ing, you having rage spasms could be counter-productive to your final goal and it will negatively impact your credibility.
---
And what you're doing is also against Reddit ToS.

Why not?

I was very positive I had it correct. But Weath just said the email that the recovery was sent to wasn‚Äôt compromised. That either means he missed something or I had the wrong email. I trust weath knows what he‚Äôs doing. Could‚Äôve been an honest mistake on my part.
---
The phone is something you posses. The username and password and email recovery is something you have. When the something you have (email) can disable the something you posses (authenticator on a phone) then it isn't 2FA.

Can you explain haveibeenpwned? Does that mean someone somewhere has my password for my email?

I login with a username, old account.

---
Glad to help! Yeah with this spot as long as you don‚Äôt attack the northern or southern Tzhaar-Hurrs then you won‚Äôt have to worry about mages or xils at all.

I know who he is. We went to middle school together. Which is why I‚Äôm tagged in his YouTube vids. It isn‚Äôt me though. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.

Stumbled here from the FP but the drama already has me hooked.

I'd like to know if the email provider is a major one. If its something like Gmail there is a way I recall reading about when crypto was bigger. It's slow and very expensive. Basically it involves getting the cellprovider to send another sim to get the legit phone to reset the 2fa. Needless to say there would be a ton of social engineering or hacking involved. Unless OP had several thousand usd to take no one would time or put in the effort. If it's legit OP should at least warn us with provider so we can figure out how they bypassed 2fa. I don't play this game but email is used to authenticate people on a ton of things.

Hey - from what I can see the account has been locked and is awaiting recovery from the owner.
---
There are 3 ways to do slayer; the fast way, the 'profitable way', and the enjoyable way(may be either of the other 2 depending on you)
---
 The fast way will usually cost you money. This is cannoning every task you can, bursting/barraging certain tasks, and skipping most of the slow xp/profitable tasks. This gets you to the levels needed for boss slayer faster, which is where the real slayer money comes from. This is generally seen as the 'correct' way.
---
I put the profitable method under quotations because its a little ironic; its not really your best bet for money. The first task you can actually make any money on is cave horrors at 58; and that just comes down to getting lucky on black masks. The profitable way is a sort of trap. you settle for what appears to be decent money at the time, but you're really just increasing the time it will take to unlock actual profitable mobs, because early/mid level profitable mobs often give bad xp/h.
---
The enjoyable method is just saying fuck both and doing what tasks you enjoy, skipping what you dislike. With any luck, you'll enjoy tasks that are good for you (as in fast AND profitable) like dust devils.
---
Nvm it was a similar post. My bad
---
I agree with the first part but what is this about Russian bots? I haven't heard about that since following the story but I think Russian bots are overused and blamed on everything including low rotten tomatoes scores for Star Wars.
---
Oof on politics in a game subreddit. Gonna be a poopstorm
---
Well, I don't think that's what's happening here. But thanks guy.
---
I've been playing since 2007, so you're right, I didn't.
---
they've been breached like 13 times since mid 2000. People just need to stop using web mail all together. I bet it's the reason for 90% of hijacked accounts
---
It's also a bit crazy how the AI system automatically rejects any recovery attempts. Someone used a temporary @sharklaser.com account to get control of my account through 2FA and apparently those one hour emails are accepted.
---
nope
---
Fair.
---
your range/mage are better which is good for prime/rex and since he's 70+ combat stats that's good for supreme.
---
kills will probably be pretty long but it's doable.
---
It‚Äôs facts and the truth, that‚Äôs different from a conspiracy theory. Do your own research like I have before you rush to judgement on something you aren‚Äôt educated on
---
[Link](https://haveibeenpwned.com) You can check to see if your account details have been leaked in a breach.
---
It's a website that searches for your email address to see if it was exposed in any security breaches. It's a very helpful tool.
---
It checks if your email was found on a list of compromised emails from a website or service leak or hack. It also lists what exactly has been taken from you, worst case is credit card information but could also just be non important stuff from that service.
---
Iron man mode is for you
---
Possibly the single best clue ever opened?
---
Like their whole database got leaked
---
Hijacked emails for the purposes of resetting something else.... 
---
Probably were put on a script to delete and scrub content before it reaches you or your linked devices, so you aren't alerted
---
What‚Äôs the challenge account? Just curious.
---
Security by obscurity is not real security and gives a false sense of security and when real security issues arise you will be more vulnerable. Most compromised systems are in fact Linux.
---
Haveibeenpwned is a website that lists known hacks, the info that the hack contains and who has been affected by them. It's worth signing up for their notifications on each of your email accounts. That way if your info is ever breached you can be notified it and change your passwords accordingly
---
Many app/token based ones have overrides with SMS. Although many do allow you to disable it. I've also seen 48-72 hour holds so unless you're not paying attention at all you would catch it.
---
Fair enough, I see what you mean. I think it is a bit more risky then that though. Lava maze tele is one of the most popular PKing hotspots and you can get unlucky with lag/a misclick and you're pretty much dead (assuming the person attacking you isn't bad.) Assuming you're picking up bones and hides (or even just hides) your inventory gets filled very quickly forcing you to rebank pretty often. 
---
Pretty much every boss that isn't a huge pain to kill is busy, that doesn't necessarily reflect its profit/value. A lot of people try KBD as their first boss and it would be nice if they could make a bit of money to show what bossing could bring at higher levels.
---
Just my thoughts on the matter.
---
HaveIBeenPwned.com is a website which keeps track of any publically listed leaks or hacks of user data. The creator keeps a copy of the leaks/hack (where possible) and alerts you if your email matches any records in the database, along with the date and service the hack impacted. This way, if your impacted you can change any emails or passwords that may have been used on that service, in case hackers managed to capture those. Definitely check it out for more information!
---
Yeah I see that now. I'd delete a bunch of your comments here to protect yourself in the future
---
I‚Äôm just seeing this post from the frontpage, but I wanted to say great job on the quick response time! Your thoroughness with dealing with OPs issue and taking the extra steps to try to track the gold and stuff is really great, and in only two hours! Just wanted to make sure you knew you were appreciated :)
---
if, when you put your email into haveibeenpwned, it means that at some point, your email address / password combo have been shared on the internet, and anyone could have them - if you've been pwned, you need to really secure your account.
---
Kourletics? Zealetics? The name may be a tough one but hopefully your quest to maxing isn‚Äôt!
---
&gt; apparently those one hour emails are accepted
---
What else are bots to use?
---
Congratulations you can assemble the adult version of LEGO.
---
Not sure how that means you're incapable of downloading infected files, but good for you.
---
When you are hunting, you track animals to eat them or bring them back to your family. All runescape community are like a family, you bring back the food to family(me) once you are done tracking and hunting, not throw it away, which is very close to banning I suppose.
---
And my friends are rich. So what? They‚Äôre also my real life friends. I see them every few days. They know I‚Äôm not going to steal their shit. We share wealth all the time. Hell, my buddy‚Äôs tbow was in my bank this time.
---
I just said it was a huge loan.
---
Nothing more or less.
---
The majority of top posts are also bullshit liars who spin the story in their favour while knowing they were in the wrong. The majority of top posts have had jmod smackdowns.
---
Lol found the person incapable of understanding humour
---
And I‚Äôm just saying if that‚Äôs your evidence of me being suspect that‚Äôs dog shit.
---
That's how IT security works these days - your email is the motherlode. People need a backup solution and that's mail or in some cases an sms.
---
The point is that people properly secure their email.
---
Yo this is pretty cool! Nice find. Btw you can swap to a ranged weapon like darts,blowpipe, msb for tagging the npcs. Then swap to your mage weapon when done!
---
You're supposed to use your normal email for daily use and a secret different email for sites that are likely being targeted for robbery, as your runescape account is or an irl investment/exhange account would be. Else you're constantly exposed to being tricked by fake emails 'looking legit' soliciting you for your secret details.
---
IE create "mysecretmailretarded@gmail.com", just use it on osrs.
---
Set 2fa on that email not related to your phone number, but to an Authenticator 2fa service or even better, a Yubi-Key or a Trezor which are phisical 2fa checks (these are unhackable, unless you get robbed irl).
---
This reminds me of a cyanide and happiness short about Dick Tucker the Easily Aroused Secret Agent

Strangely enough your recent comment has added a large degree of concern to this whole ordeal.
---
You aren't making a stronger case for yourself.
---
It'll be uploaded to YouTube
---
They‚Äôve said a million times on q and a and posts that mtx will never happen big reason being is of it was to come to osrs it would need to be polled which wouldn‚Äôt pass
---
So basically the same demographic to Trumps voters
---
Lmfaooo it doesn‚Äôt sound like I sold anything. He loaned me his tbow to pvm with while he‚Äôs on a hiatus. I got hacked and lost it. Nothing more to it
---
Hi there.
---
How quickly do the replies to your recovery requests come back? Are they immediate, or does it take an hour or so?
---
Anguish and occult should be priority for extra damage. 
---
Once you kill Jad, get Zuk as close to 240 HP as possible and then kill the set ASAP. Once you do, Initiate the healer phase and follow suite. You should be flicking/ praying rigour to speed things up. It shouldn't take you more than 2/3 shield rotations of healers to kill them all, which should be enough time to get ready for your final set.
---
Sets don't stop spawning, so you're working against the clock.
---
It's definitely in the realm of possibility and I'm just entertaining it.
---
Is there anything else we should know about your accounts dealings?
---
Scalia was a piece of human garbage. I‚Äôve said this about a couple of people in my whole life but I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs decomposed and six feet under. I just hope he doesn‚Äôt ruin the soil around his remains.
---
&gt; The average player doesn't even know 2-step on e-mail exists, or even think they'll need it
---
2FA is pretty commonplace for security nowadays. It's the current day version of the 'don't write your passwords down' security tip of the 2000's.
---
FYI, I have the account back right now. You said you wanted to know.
---
Obviously not, that's how the hacker did it.  The recovery email was sent.  The email was somehow opened
---
Where's the vod for yesterday's stream? Not seeing it on twitch
---
Here's what I did:
---
1.) 1st Set of M/R: Tag both and kill the ranger.
---
2.) Leave mager alive and get zuk below 600Hp
---
3.) Kill the mager.
---
4.) Get Zuk to 480 for Jad Spawn.
---
5.) Kill Jad
---
6.) Get Zuk to ~300Hp
---
7.) Walk the shield and wait for the 2nd set to spawn.
---
8.) Tag and kill both R/M. 
---
9.) Get zuk to 240 Hp to spawn healers.
---
10.) Kill healers and finish off zuk.
---
If you're maxed you should be killing zuk before the 3rd set appears and healers should already be dead by the time the 3rd set does appear. You should be ranged potted and praying rigour/preserve during zuk as well. You need at least 2-3 doses of bastion/range pot for zuk.
---
Fair. That's good to hear.
---
Lmao no it didn't? Everything he has said is normal for a player who has an account more than a year old and friends who play... Are you sure you used to play?
---
About 3 days ago I made a new email and all it has is osrs
---
i'm at venanatis.. 3 kills so far. it's actually hard to kill
---
Sure, insult whoever you are talking to. Always gives your argument more credit.
---
Let me explain this in simple terms. The idea behind 2FA is that you have to gain access to two different ‚Äûkeys‚Äú, hence enhancing security.
---
It you can bypass this by gaining a single ‚Äûkey‚Äú (like in this case access to an e-mail address) it breaks the whole concept of 2FA.
---
And just because a lots of companies do this, doesn‚Äôt make it better. Lot‚Äôs of online companies have shit security, where do you think all those hacks come from.
---
If there is a reset option, this also has to be 2FA, typical example is to ask security questions that only the user can know, but there are better options.
---
I did. Maybe not with people who shared wealth to that degree, however.
---
It seems he has his account returned, though.
---
Get some help lmao
---
Way back in the day, you could see the IP address of the last logged on user. This was used for ddosing. I dont think it does that anymore.
---
Any n-step authentication is only as secure as the access to the nth step.
---
It‚Äôs actually happened a lot more than ‚Äútwice‚Äù if you were around here for longer than 1 week you would know
---
He doesnt want to lose his crown so he isn't allowed to say anything about the situation.
---
Ye, I was there. Congrats dude!
---
It really isn‚Äôt though. Friends share items all the time. I do raids with my real life friends and we divy up the gear to make sure everyone is geared properly. We‚Äôve been scaping together for 10 years. That isn‚Äôt against the rules and it isn‚Äôt suspect. You‚Äôve offered no evidence against me that‚Äôs actually suspect. You‚Äôre digging yourself a hole here.
---
Sorry, but that sounds like horseshit. If they had 2fa on their email, they would have seen the login attempt as soon as it happened. I have no idea how someone would get around 2fa, so let me know if I'm completely fucking wrong. 
---
Also, this is your daily reminder to change your email and osrs password very often.
---
I don't think i'm digging myself a hole. It just seemed strange to me. But now I know.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why people go and make a reddit post after they do it. All it does is draw un-needed attention to them self
---
You're likely being denied because of the new location and new devices. 
---
If there's no history of those on the account, then Jagex will probably think that you're a hijacker. I believe they mention something similar at the top of the recovery form. 
---
Otherwise you simply don't fill in enough correct information for Jagex to verify your identify as the account owner.
---
Thanks for the replies guys. Whether or not yous believe me, I'm following this exact procedure. 100% , my rng is genuinally terrible. Even on the anguish runs I seem to hit so terribly on zuk. Would you recommend me waiting for the 3rd set before healers to give me confidence this problem won't happen?
---
Yeah, between my friends. Again, it isn‚Äôt against the rules. The mods can surely tell that I‚Äôve been playing with these guys for years. They‚Äôve been on my friends list forever. You tubers openly admit to getting loaned items all the time on video. It‚Äôs not against the rules
---
Damn...
---
I was meant to sleep but his posts are too good. I think he is auditioning for a character on CSI. Like a kid who is there playing detective around all the grownups.
---
Your post said 1/8th of your time at work is actually working. Did you mean "just" working instead? That I can understand if you're good at your job.
---
I just kinda ran with what you said above &amp; I'll stand by it if you're legit playing rs 7hrs a day on company time hahahahaha.
---
Yeah I know man they keep spawning , I feel I'm just too slow possibly stacked with a bad string of low rng
---
Fix your terrible security system. Y'all give your players anxiety.
---
Not OP in this situation
---
LOLOLOLOL another brainlet with unsecure email blaming jagex.
---
Surely you can blacklist sites that literally advertise "hey we exist only to provide you with a temporary email" like Sharklaser does. I don't think that's out of the realm of possibility is it? For all we know, they already do and there's some misunderstanding with Afrikano's post. Having their system blacklist those things doesn't seem like it's impossible. 
---
You'd still have manually created email throwaways, yes, but it'd be less tempting in theory.
---
I wasn't saying it was against the rules.
---
That just seemed like a huge amount of wealth to share.
---
Thanks for the reply dude
---
If they keep developing sea of thieves I really hope they use the PP economy as a model to follow.
---
That hasn't been accurate for ages, rule of thumb for selling rn is more like $0.50 USD/mil
---
I tried to tell you. You could‚Äôve dm‚Äôd me from the beginning and it would‚Äôve been cleared up then. But you had to be cocky and witch hunt me for no reason.
---
It's still not 100% your fault because there should be an authenticator trip when trying to recover your account or get any type of information out of it through any method except logging in.
---
weird flex but ok
---
the way you get around 2fa is people having their token generator on their computer where they access everything from - removing the second factor entirely since you have access to everything if your computer is compromised. if you have your 2fa generator on your phone it is nearly impossible to get around it.
---
K O L O N I S E R E N
---
some rando hacked it?
---
Some people simply function on less sleep. I‚Äôm unhuman if I don‚Äôt get 9 hours, some people can live fine with 5.
---
My day job is helping people that have been hacked / infected / had their identity stolen and the idea that you need to be doing something sketchy to fall victim to these threats is just patently false.
---
We've had people get infected by malware served from Forbes, we've had large scale attacks on particular vulnerable routers that led to infections etc. You can disagree all you want, but you're incorrect.
---
Or even link it directly to your phone number. Like text to accept type thing
---
10k for each mark of grace if you transfer to crystals, the graceful gear can't be liquidated to anything afaik. Or can they be sold back for tokens?
---
Nice job mate! Two big gear upgrades in one day üòÅ
---
it‚Äôs sad that human life is wasted on an idiot like you üòü
---
As a newbie scared to lose everything I'm working hard for to get, I would like to thank you Weath. Good job and very nice response!
---
Wow.
---
I dont play runescape much but i am amazed by how much you cared about this whole situation.
---
My main mmorpg game is Tibia and if you get hacked there the admins will just say: "ROFLMAO GTFO"
---
there you go mr assumption, I didn't say that's how people get infected / hacked / etc, it's how I think /HE/ got hacked. 
---
I'm full aware there are plenty of things completely out of control from the user that can get them infected.
---
I think it was the same person that did it the first time. I know which email they used now. The same one from last time.
---
Isn't it also stupid how we gotta get 5k upvotes on Reddit before any help at all.
---
Imagine going through all that for 90m....
---
No, but OP seems really triggered by that comment
---
Lover levels? 69 here.
---
With an app for example?
---
Sigh... Putting a delay somewhere doesn't solve the underlining issue.  Your account remains vulnerable, as your account's details remain compromised. 
---
There is also nothing you can do to secure your account. At best you could change the registered email, if it's compromised. But next time they'll just go through the recovery form. Don't forget that they can use the stuff they found in your email.
---
It's like 13034k or something close to that. 
---
It's a little over 13M exp for a 99
---
This ia beautiful, thanks
---
I don‚Äôt think they can be sold back? Something to have a look into I think!
---
that's most people on here though, like 1k total at best, complain about having to get 40 runecrafting
---
fuck off dude
---
Unless Jagex supplied him with the email account, it's not their job at all.
---
If they **actually** did "more of less doing everything they know how to ensure the safety of their account", they'd have 2FA on their email and this wouldn't happen.
---
Basic security practices shouldn't have to be taught by a games company.
---
I agree. But at least I got the clarity I was asking for and know what steps to take moving forward. I have the account back, not sure what I want to do with it at this point though.
---
thats a naive way of thinking. 
---
jagex is not going to recover ten thousands of accounts because they took a risk. we are talking about jagex, a company without customer support, authenticator delay or item restoration. bots are rampant in the game and RWT is flourishing. 
---
if any private client decides to go rogue and steal accounts (and sell their gp for hundreds of thousands of dollars) then its your loss. the private client only profits.
---
I mean that's pretty much the case for any service connected to your email. You can't blame Jagex for people that don't have a secure email service, it's not like there's a lack of secure options.
---
Everyone disliked that.
---
Imagine working for Jagex, with not a lot of salary, working overtime with no pay to get updates out quickly just to make the community happy. Go to Reddit to relax and people make memes because they think you don't care.
---
If someone has access to the tied email they can bypass ingame two-step verification. As long as you have 2FA on your rs account, the security weakness has basically been outsourced  from Jagex to your email provider. How secure your email provider is is an entirely separate question.
---
Dank
---
I‚Äôm not going to let him throw false accusations at me. It‚Äôs done now. I really don‚Äôt care anymore. Woo what a night.
---
Would it be better if they ignored the thread?
---
It‚Äôs all luck, I got 3rd Age Chestplate on my 130th hard clue, which was 55m at the time. All my other clues have been mediocre at best.
---
This was some sort of fix to a lure I think. The lost on death screen means nothing unless you're in the wild anyway so I wouldnt worry about it too much as you'll just keep your graceful equipped on death.
---
I think they're making it a priority because there have been many miscommunications within their own team and the community has been demanding something be done about account security. It's also nice that he was able to get a response on Reddit, but Reddit shouldn't be required to get this figured out quickly
---
no and it's complete ass LOL idk if i'm gonna go back, 8 kc
---
After it switches it'll still take the old code for a few seconds
---
so we walk around it
---
Yeah, I am, but the real question is, Uh, what are you? Dumb?
---
I used it for skulled Rev Cave pvming to skull while avoiding attacking anyone. You just equip an Amulet of Avarice, Unequip, and bank it with the boxes. 
---
You might not see the point because you can always just skull up, but losing a Salve (ei) to an anti-pker you chose to skull on can make you think differently.
---
yeah i mean it wouldnt change anything anyways, fuck it. i'd be down for it.
---
Before I read this comment, the picture had me wondering when they added a third age crossbow to the game.
---
1st
---
I thought they were apart of the sleves u choose
---
I was doing Melee for a while then changed to ranged and even with 86 ranged, dragon diamond and ruby bolts, and Karil's (well I'm using a half Verac half Karil's set like for Fight Caves) I'm having a tough time getting things in order, I've died more times on the first phase with range than any time I've gone with straight melee... Melee seems a lot less complicated, but you need 90+ attack and strength to make it worth the time... on HCIM, I'd totally go melee but only if you have high high melee stats.
---
another shitty update. shocked.
---
Do slayer and go "double" it again.
---
i would really suggest getting antifires.
---
Alternatively you can tick eat using purple sweets.
---
Parties are xp waste
---
Daganoth rex stops antifire pots, so I would recommend getting some there if u are an ironman and dont want to train herblore...
---
I really wouldnt recommend doing the fight without it
---
nice little emblem farm fix :) hope it helps a bit
---
&gt;Tier 10 emblems can now be traded with players and on the Grand Exchange. To combat emblem farming, the BH world is now limited to players with 300+ total level or 25+ hours of game time. 
---
Not a bad bandaid fix, but I hope this isn't the last change we see to prevent emblem farming. 
---
Also, is it 25 hours playtime, or 25 hours as a member?
---
dhcb&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bp bgs. I literally can not stand doing vork without dhcb after doing it with it. The kills are far easier, you take so much less damage overall, and the consistent 6 kill trips are too good to pass up. If you plan on cranking vorkath for awhile, I would 1000% get a dhcb. If you're feeling lazy and dont wanna do vork sometimes, It's great at wyverns and brutal blacks for afking some decent gp as well.
---
anyone who says this forgets how annoying the game was pre ge.
---
go play iron man if you want to experience that.
---
New accounts have a 24h ingame playtime restriction before being able to use the ge. These bots are waiting it out before starting to bot, as most bots are banned within a few hours. Just because they get random events doesnteak theyre force spawning them lmfao
---
Yes. Those don't rely on SMS authentification (which is the most insecure 2FA you could ever have, never opt into it when you have other options).
---
&gt; The defender drop rate has been changed from 1/50 to 1/25. The dragon defender's rate has been changed from 1/100 to 1/50.
---
Outstanding.
---
I think the 25 hour game time limit should either be increased or removed. Is 25 hours really a big deal to a bot farmer who can afk many bots at a time?
---
Kudos for owning up to their mistake regarding imp boxes
---
What did you stop at the anvil for with raw ore?
---
Fuck you're right, i first did a stop at lumbridge furnace
---
I've been maxed since 2016. HNNG INFERNAL MAX CAPE BTW
---
i think they should just give people all the items in the game and save them time from playing.
---
So we can do black chins again ? nice
---
It's better to wear devout boots\*
---
Lol remind me of this post when 75% of osrs voters choose to introduce mtx in the game, these posts have been on and off Reddit for as long as I can remember the jmods have repeated there selves a million times already
---
Do something else then?
---
Early level Slayer isnt really profitable, u start getting gp when u get around 75 and can kill gargoyles, though i think konar slayer made slayer a bit more profitable. Try using her and loot those Brimstone keys
---
make an ironman
---
max your combat and get good gear first.
---
makes slayer way easier when you can just cannon everything.
---
&gt; Players will no longer be able to logout in the hydra room. They are still able to leave the room when there is no hydra inside via the doors.

Anyone know why this was changed or why you couldn't leave in the first place?

I got quest Cape out of the way by lvl 95 combat. I  hate quests so much I just wanted to power through it and get them all done already.
---
I have 4 more hunter levels and it suuuucks
---
You sound like you take this game a bit too seriously
---
What ? Not like you are safe in the wildy anyway.
---
They said that they most of the bots before the leave tutorial island, so a 25 hour is probably enough to reduce the bots by a fuck ton.
---
I'm gonna play devil's advocate and ask what incentive do the mods of this sub have to care about any of your post? 
---
This sub isn't moderated or owned by Jagex, and despite the memes, this isn't an official channel to get customer support, and the mods' primary concern should be to ensure that the content on this sub is healthy for the sub's longevity, and I'd argue that customer support requests in fact run counter to that aim if a huge proportion of the discussion on the subreddit is focused on whether or not little timmy actually botted, or sally who got phished begging jagex to give her account back before she gets cleaned.

Do I need to make a list of the construction skill changes?

You have all that shit some of which makes the game 100 times easier then it originally was, and people bitch about the toolbelt like wtf
---
Treat yourself to a quality Android
---
Authenticator has nothing to do with your sim.

Osrs is based on 2007scape? It wouldn't be bringing it back, it'd be adding new content to the game.

Got em

U can do a quest for free level 23 rc
---
They are only from elites. Good luck with that lmfao.
---
They do it so each region has a chance to pk with lower ping
---
Yes i do :) but if you login to the game and try to go on bounty hunter on an account without skill total of over 300 but i have over 25 hours in game time! So how about that?
---
Gotta talk to oziach for that respawn feature.
---
While true, that's not at all relevant to the number of bots that make it off tutorial island, though.
---
I cant login to the world and IN GAME IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS OVER 300 TOTAL SKILL LVL AND OVER 25 HOURS
---
it's just not possible without identification where i live. and if someone actually creates a fake passport we're getting into territory where he could also just break into my home or put a gun to my head and force me to hand out my stuff. obviously it's not "secure" then.
---
that's just not something your run of the mill game account hacker does. if someone goes to those length he could just invest that time into hacking someone worth a few millions.
---
For sure, else it wouldn't be under the DMM-section like that.
---
They probably meant and... 25 hours in game played is easily done splashing.
---
Reduce his hitpoints to zero before he reduces your hitpoints to zero.
---
Have you put this forward as a suggestion?
---
I can't express how happy I am with this. These 'experiments' are exactly what I want to see from Jagex.
---
Banning bots isn't enough to stop them. We also need ingame measures. Even these minor inconveniences will help. And if it doesn't work you can always change or remove it.
---
Yes pretty much. The only way you can really secure is , is to attach that email to another email and 2FA it.... and even then people are still getting hacked
---
As I said before, that statement was made years ago. They also didnt provide numbers either.
---
Bots also need to work less to be worth it since membership is free and membership money making is easier
---
Like you wouldnt have as many emblem farming rings without free membs
---
The first post is clearly talking to people explicitly questioning their gender identity, it's not mocking people with feminine traits that don't intend on transitioning, that's a really wild thing to take away from that meme.  Literally, the first panel says "So you're questioning your gender identity?
---
The second one is about the backwards logic people who are uncomfortable with their gender identity commonly use to justify making themselves more like the gender they internally want to be while still being able to outwardly deny it.  "Haha I'm not trans, I'm just taking the drugs that trans people take because it prevents balding."  Do you *seriously* think this is *shilling* hrt?
---
The third one is about people hardcore repressing.  It literally says "I want to be a girl, I would start HRT, "Button smashed (referring to those 'would you press the button games'.
---
I honestly do not understand how you can arrive at the conclusions you came to, it seems like you're really stretching it to defend the position you have.
---
I actually don't love "Egg" culture super much and I am a trans person, I think some trans people that just want to help get too aggressive with the egg shit sometimes.  There really are cis men that just want to crossdress, as a community, we should not be literally misgendering these people because we think we know better.  However, you picked some awful fucking examples to demonstrate this point.
---
As a whole, that sub is mostly for trans people in denial/people questioning their gender identity, and for trans people who've already gone through it poking fun at some of the silly rationalizations, we made before transition to convince ourselves we weren't.
---
lmao calm down mate, go log into a f2p world if you want to see it loool
---
I've updated the newspost to be more clear. It requires both.
---
?
---
Oh that is actually a really good one! Did not finish that one yet, that will be my first goal! And do you recommend black/god d'hide for the fight or elite void?
---
so what exactly do you need help with then...
---
Is the membership deal bonds or a reacurring payment?
---
Decided to purchase a DHCB last night, and I'm so glad I did. Can usually stay for 4-5 kills taking around 2 minutes each.
---
Sure took long for the antisemitism to come out
---
I remember the day I was F2P and all I did was mine rune ess and had saved like 6-7k of it, and then they came out with the updated pure essence which turned all rune ess into pure ess and the price rose from like 12gp ea to 120 gp ea and I thought I was a rich noob
---
Ballah üòé
---
If you give to the community and ask nothing in return.... why should you be asking for special treatment by not being banned lol? Anyone earning 6 figures would just be paying someone else to grind their character stats while they play do their business, play other games, go on a vacation or be out there getting drunk and wasted in luxury clubs with models.
---
Idk about toolbelt, but MONEY POUCH IS NEEDED!
---
they change nonpvp worlds into pvp worlds to help with ping? what? why not just rotate which world is high risk among the already existing pvp worlds? Ive had 3 separate worlds i used as home worlds change to pvp world . and its not just pvp worlds. ive had a home world changed to west coast USA randomly too
---
Get 75 ranged for blowpipe before ds2, it's a lifesaver
---
What i did after losing my bank chuck was grind out 99hunt. Got about 60~m but it didn‚Äôt last long. Sand casino is a bad place to have a 99 party. . . .
---
&gt;you cant tele at chins
---
You can't use imp boxes where you can't tele
---
yea cause winterdodt &amp; tbow doesnt make the game easy at all. They didnt wanna put bonfires cause its 2010 rs they wanted to keep it 2007 yet 99 firemaking takes a week to get doing winterdodt and is extremely afk &amp; profitable. 
---
Tbow hits 75s with amethyst arrows on monster with high magic defense bonus. you can three hit jad with a tbow.
---
Yea the toolbelt does make the game alot easier, would affect the whole game lmfao -_-
---
Okay, but do you have numbers to disprove the statement that most bots don't make it off tutorial island? Your other points are valid, but again irrelevant to the topic being discussed.
---
Bot haha!

I understand disliking them for primary training, since I know you want the levels sooner, but you really should be doing them even if it's between regular Hunter training. Birdhouses, while you're doing them, is better xp/h, so if you're doing salamanders for example it's better to switch to birdhouses for a minute when you can
---
The real question is who get 77 rc before agi lol...
---
You won‚Äôt lose the graceful if you die under lvl 20 wilderness as it‚Äôs untradeables. The screen is correct

---
It makes so much more sense now.
---
dont forget armadyl godsword, that wasnt in rs07. So i dont see an issue in having the toolbelt feature. Its not like it affects the entire game like Twisted bow which 3 hits jad &amp; winterdodt where you can get a firemaking cape in a week and is extremely profitable.
---
No.....im a obby mauler with 60 str....
---
No, takes too many inventory spots to be worth it. Just bring extra brews and restores
---
2FA would be a barrier to any form of 100% remote control of your pc as long as it's active.
---
Problem is it's skipped trought acc recovery appeals, if succesful tricks jagex arbitration = very bad as they have made mistakes before.
---
I just want to lock my account recovery behind a private key stored in my trezor, which I can't loss because I don't know.
---
And if my trezor breaks I can always get a new one and recalculate taht key from a long-ass seed of 12/24 words (written down on paper) and a pin code.
---
This is the standard of security of tech spawned to secure your bitcoins, even for millions of dollars. This tier of security has no entry costs, a trezor may be 40$. But even without one.
---
Even if this is an aditional feature to upgrade acc security and not the standard for normies.
---
Storing a private key on paper as a last resort to recover your owned account should be the only way to go, or else everyone can try to break trought jagex arbitration / remove 2FAs making them pointless. Jagex shouldn't push security on third party sites like google, they're just being retards, duh, it's out of their control.
---
If they generate one time pass-codes to recover accounts then only the legitimate owner can start such a process, and if he's retarded to not store that code safely irl, then he just sull go kill himself and leave non retards have functional security layers.
---
Although I see the issue with alchables in the shop, it gives t10s at least a bare minimum mark. Which I believe is 1.2M 
---
If it was just cosmetics and rune pouches, eventually the market will settle T10s being super cheap, when I think they SHOULD be worth around 1.8-2m
---
Thanks! Is it difficult to do?
---
Think OP is talking about changing it yourself similar using a monster head to recolor your slayer helm
---
Read today's update that screen shot is hella old. 
---
The bh world's need 300 total, it should be upped I agree... 
---
Just go kill them üòÇ
---
&gt; By your logic imp boxes should stay the same while teleports should be nerfed lmao.
---
You respond to my comment that says that noone banks tas often as they would impbox by saying that "according to my logic" imp boxes dont make a difference?
---
You dont have make a fool out of yourself lmao. Jagex sadly agrees with you ironman players that wildy content shouldnt be risky.

For anyone who wants to know how things are going, rc happens to be our sotw this week.
---
Hard clues
---
is there a way to find this info? one time that screen said I would lose ardougn cape but when I died I still had it
---
Teleporting takes longer. Therefore people will do it less than they would use an imp box, meaning that they would carry more risk on them at chins due to wanting to bank less.
---
You might bank at 50 chins no matter what, but the majority would rather teleport less and just stay at chins.
---
If you go to a pvp world, you can loot the fights and make a reasonable profit with no stat requirements.
---
Just head to varrock or edgeville on a pvp world and start banking all the drops. You'll profit quickly but wont gain any stats.
---
Just a coincidence. Ingame talking/trading is safe unless you are giving them personal details.
---
What does happen to graceful if you get pked while abyss rcing?
---
it was a suggestion to add dyes to the game like orn kit or use vorkath head to get votkath color and king black dragon heads to get black one and i think hydra head to get purple color was 4 motnhs ago
---
Imagine thinking gargoyles need a nerf in 2019. A lot of players block them these days.
---
so any news?
---
As long as you watch guides beforehand, the only roles that could be considered difficult to any degree would be healer in later waves and defender. 
---
If you watch the Lord Shayne defender guide on YouTube, it ends up being by far the easiest/fastest role to do imo.
---
For healer, just ask your team to have 2 healers on waves 9 or 10 to give you some help. 
---
BA is a super fun time after you play a few rounds.
---
The point is teleporting takes longer than using an imp box. Why is that hard to grasp? People feel less incentivised to do an action that takes longer therefore keeping more chins on them before banking.
---
I used d'hide, didn't have void so I'm not sure how good it would be.
---
What i hate about RC is keeping track of teleport charges..
---
I think there's too many variables in the trade volume to isolate bot activity. 
---
I'd say part of the reason there's not a huge spike is because there's less actual BH pkers, and also the emblem drop requirement update. I'm assuming this drop in supply is offset somewhat by botted emblems. Emblem price has gone up despite the trade volume slightly decreasing. Wouldn't make sense if the same amount of players were active (or if the rate of legit emblems coming in was the same). Plus, why would botters sell emblems to the shop for a fraction of the GE value, and risk a higher chance of being detected than just selling on the GE?
---
Duh
---
What you mean by opened the map
---
its the wildy lvl up and do barrows way better cash
---
Haha i think so too:)
---
Ahh so rumbles the way to go then? Feel like I‚Äôll be getting hit constantly with only 47 defence.
---
Well yes and no, no matter what they will never fall below a .2 ratio which is locked behind the alch price of rune legs. So this is a major issue regardless, but I doubt the Tier 10s will ever fall below a .3 ratio just between merchants and people buying looting bags/rune pouches.
---
I‚Äôd happily pay double of it didn‚Äôt run out whilst offline. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a very good business model.
---
i guess i understand what you mean, although they should have implemented some features for the dwh in the first place then
---
3 weeks ago the poll for a lot of "shiny" content suggestions passed.
---
to have the audacity to call this "combat" against bots goes against anything i stand for. if that is your solution to bots and if that statisfies you permanently then thats ok. but i happen to disagree. i demand a larger bot update and they have yet to promise anything of that sort. 
---
same with doing an update previous week to revoke it the next week (imp boxes). wow, we most certainly did not go in circles.
---
jamflex is a really succesfull company. it completely baffles me how much slack people give them. standards and holding them accountable is what keeps games great.

Good thing you posted the entire varrock map otherwise I would have gotten really confused as to the path you took to make your Gielinor gold pieces
---
I‚Äôm always up for more variaty so you‚Äôve got my support! Seeing everyone in identical BiS gear gets a bit stale.

I did this on the way to lava dragons, lost 12m. Made me want to quit playing
---
nice b8 m8
---
Duh? I have never pre ordered anything requiring full payment in advance. They always take the payment 1 day prior to shipping.
---
Except it isn't, because it says you'll lose graceful.
---
I actually hadn't seen the 300 total level, but that is still only a bandaid. This will slow them down for a few days, while they adjust the scripts to grab some easy levels (you would only need like 10 in each skill which wouldnt take long at all) The 25 hours things seems like it would work on the surface, but in reality they have bots that can knock that out easily, and worst case buying accounts that are already that old would be trivial.
---
I don't think it would be bad I just nees to get around to doing it.
---
Grind out that crafting ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
He didnt get them from the same clue
---
Literally never heard of a preorder waiting to take payments till it ships. I work with a lot of shipping companies and preorder always requires full payment at time of purchase.
---
The way this guy puts it is as if an imp box = all danger from wilderness removed. Like what? It's a mere QoL that saves you time banking. People won't risk more because if they're frequently PKed, the only ones I see risking more are the badasses in big ass two handed shields that will tank you from GDZ to the ditch while cussing your ass out.
---
I meant annually not monthly...
---
already got 99 craft, still need to swap duel ring + binding neck
---
Thank you for your luck wishes. Apperently I needed that :) 2 in 16 kills.
---
Not unknown. It didn't exist before the diary, and was added as a reward for said diary, so...
---
How long would it take to do those quests? The trial is only a week of members.
---
literally just remove BH from the game entirely, its shit tier trash content anyway. Then make more effort to revive wildy in other ways but ffs dont add a mechanic like emblems which basically just allows to print gold into the game constantly lmao.
---
Have they lied about botting before?
---
I don't know. I think it has to do with expectations. I'm not pvming yet but when I get there I will probably look for groups that don't split or ask groups not to split with me so they don't expect me to
---
Right,I remember an american guy who paid to get tracked just to see if they would and they bought his phone and triangular tracking for like $5.
---
GAAHK
---
And they need to play 25 hours
---
U know what the droprate of elite clues is?
---
I interpreted it as needing both too.
---
Getting the wrong target means you need to wait longer to get the actual target.
---
Sorry but basing your math on counting teletabs of some shitty programmed farm doesnt seem very convincing. 
---
Would prefer to see the actual math based on whats possible based on limits of the game instead of random numbers
---
I feel like an idiot, I dont understand the 25+ hour requirement. How does that help?
---
Typically they would be caught before this time (my assumption)
---
Man does the bring back or add content argument even matter üòÇüòÇ
---
&gt; BH world is now limited to players with 300+ total level **_and_** 25+ hours of game time.
---
It's not one or the other.
---
Armadyl is just about useless outside of raids or inferno. Way too expensive for what it is.
---
That does seem very reasonable
---
Seriously though it's awesome.  I played back in 03-05 or so.  Never really been a big gamer but man did I forget how much I loved osrs.  Play exclusively on mobile while watching TV, cleaning or working on my car.
---
Not long, 2 days max. You can also redeem the month of twitch prime loot if you have one, or use the amazon prime trial to get it and then cancel. 
---
With only a week of time, you'll have to do a lot of herb runs to make the money back, especially while bonds are pretty expensive. There are other methods if you wanna grind but honestly those are not fun to do and should be a last resort
---
\*Bottery\* crust
---
Seriously. Instead of whining hunters don't drop enough chins why don't you just train hunter and catch them yourself instead of fucking whining.

If you're aiming to get Farming XP anyway, then yes, they're definitely worth it, since you're getting free GP for a task you were already going to do.

Yes it's better, an even better option is to sell it for a dh lance

It‚Äôs great, mate :)
---
Honestly, anything you find not fun isn't worth it. In the long run, it's better to find more enjoyable Hunter methods than to do one daily that you hate until you burn out. 
---
People rave about efficiency and xp/hr with dailies like birdhouse runs, but if you end up doing them and quitting due to burn out, then the XP/hr is even worse :P

An easy way to make a little consistent  money is buy bars and turn them into arrow heads. Super low overhead but profit is bad. After getting a few hundred k doing that you could switch to blast furnace

you expect a bunch of young guys to clean? Laughable.
---
It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúeasy-scape‚Äù it‚Äôs about patching a hole for  a game mechanic they made to allow yourself to stay out of combat. I agree a lot of things have made this easy-scape however this is after all a minor qol change and really only filling a niche that was overlooked
---
Then they can play a trade account.
---
Iron men are for true gamer cunts.

No flasks either..

The bot detection works, it just takes a while to catch them. So now they have a full 25 hours to catch an account before it can harm the game

That takes more effort, 25 hours of splashing would put them over the 20 combat level they need.

It's a band-aid fix. But it will not hurt giving Jagex 25 hours to catch each bot account before its harmful.

Void mage has more ranged defense and more magic defense than Ahrim's though.
---
Yes this is usually a good idea, but the only problem is that with this spot you can‚Äôt run north or south 2 tiles from where I was grouping them so you need something with really long range to stack 4 extra kets. The way I did it in the video is the best way by grouping the northern spawns first then running to the center area and grouping the rest. It can be done though, just a lot less tedious to just use blood rush.

Tzhaar kets have a magic defense bonus of 0 but a flat magic level of 40 so it‚Äôs good to have mage bonus for them. If you are worried about prayer though, using god robes will still keep your magic bonus a little higher (+4 for each piece) while also give you the same prayer bonus as initiate.
---
It is quite obvious they are pandering to Ironmen, the instanced bosses and the general way raids function shows that they don't want the backlash from the ironman community. Anything that isn't ideal for Ironmen will lead to a WW3 equivalent level of outrage from them.

It's just too convenient, it's not a QoL update like interface adjustments, it's an actual feature that makes the game easier. Things that the toolbelt will do: you will never forget your tools, you are essentially adding more inventory spaces, it will never take up space in your inventory, you won't lose it on death. Things that a QoL update does, for example: reduces the amount of clicking done for an action from 3 clicks to 2 clicks.

Rapier is 1 or 2 max hits over tentacle depending on other gear

Welcome to construction.
---
Definitely better loot than slayer you can do at your level. You can get emblems pretty frequently that go for ~190k right now, but since tasks can be any level monster they can take a while. If you want to do it then you should. I‚Äôd advise that you risk little to nothing and use expeditious bracelets at all times.
---
But doing that on 40 accounts a day will become difficult.
---
I don't think it's better xp. Good money from the emblems and great points.
---
Not really hard considering swamp lizards can be up to like 50k xp per hour.
---
That means that you put out enough info at some point for someone to recover your account. No matter what jagex does they can‚Äôt stop their players from leaking their own info, being phished or just in general practicing account security.

They do whatever they like, always have.

That is a very reasonable argument. And I completely understand that perspective. The debate should be about whether the life of the unborn trumps a woman‚Äôs right to choose what she can/can‚Äôt do with her body, and it‚Äôs an important debate. My snide comment was directed at the original commenter who was much more callous in his delivery of the information.

Cheers to the next 14 years of your life being consumed by the game like the rest of us. You may take breaks from time to time, but RuneScape is like the Hotel California: you may log out, but you can never leave. 
---
Welcome to the family.
---
The indictments have all been people just not telling the complete truth to Mueller, not actually over Russia interfering. Please tell us more about how informed you are! :) /s
---
Plainly untrue? I've watched his stream during inferno non-stop and he absolutely failed mechanically on mechanics he already knew about from previous attempts and/or from watching other streamers fail it. He wasn't even the first to reach healers.
---
&gt; If it were hard, players would need to overcome a skill gap that prevented them from succeeding.
---
I've literally known people who couldn't do Jad on a max main. It's beyond foolish to claim that Inferno isn't mechanically hard. You're basically saying it's not hard because after many attempts people get good, well no shit, if you attempt 99% of video game challenges a million times you'll do them all eventually. 
---
&gt;Exactly my point.
---
Doesn't prove your point because you're using a sample size of 1. Most people do far more attempts than that. Precise clicks at Jads and especially at Zuk healers/minions has proven to be hard for most people hence difficult mechanics. 
---
I mean, you'll never convince me that the Inferno overall isn't a hard piece of content considering it took the best players so long to get it done despite figuring out the mechanics.
---
A couple thousand Russian bots literally cannot cause this. They are drops in the sea of voices about these issues. Its a shit excuse.
---
Lol downvotes. "How dare you have preferences!"

It got so *bad* that I was *only* doing one hour of work out of 8 hours.

He's not wearing the official 6 figure crew ring that we all get when we escape peasantry. ^^/s
---
Absolutely - I appreciate that the devs put in that effort. But what I really want is a toggle checkbox for each state like that (including PoH death), with checkboxes that default to your current "actual character state".
---
For example, if you're skulled outside the wildy, the checkboxes will default to that. But you can still play around with them if you're curious about an unskulled death in a PoH.
---
Zmi is 100 times better than abyss crafting. Just grab essence and follow someone to the altar and tele back.

lol if you can use charge dragonstone scrolls you can charge a full inv to (4) for like 200gp in 1 click at the bank

Most of them just buy the account already for a buck or two. Now they‚Äôll just have a bit more everhead paying like $5 an account for 300 total 25 hours.

Why would you want to put a pet inside your self
---
hey vsauce! michael here!
---
I didn't even account for bugs and exploits. My thought is that PvP worlds kind of function as a scenery change from wildy PvP with added bracketing. I'd venture to guess 99.99% of PVP fights occur in the currently marked off "hot zones".
---
Just because you CAN attack other players, doesn't mean you will. There have been plenty of times where I was doing wildy hellhounds for krystilia and other higher leveled players run right past me when theyre in range and could probably 2 shot me.
---
With this incentive, maybe players would be willing to accept the risk of Skilling on PVP worlds and incentivize pkers to hunt them down for more bank.
---
Also, it may fix the complaint regarding PvP skill gaps and bad accounts as players with suboptimal accounts could still potentially kill skillers for loot if they're on the lower end of their combat bracket.
---
WDR tracks all banned players, doesnt matter how many times you change your name
---
Solid advice and all of which helped me get my first fire cape. 
---
One thing I did to bait the healers was use chinchompas to try and aggro the healers which helped heaps if you‚Äôre having issues with them.
---
dont think scythe would do much didnt she only take up 1 sq that is why no one ever took a dhally for a spec as well.

That's what i thought when my 6 hour journey began :D

Hmm, never obtained any considerable wood resources from slayer is there a certain master that gives logs as a reward for completing a task?
---
Not that I condone this behavior, but there are tons of websites that share names of players who have ninja'd loot from shared raids. Be mindful.
---
they could cap the damage froom tbow like they do on other bosses.  Make it a max hit of like 40 and it would be fine.
---
Dragon Dart Tips and Yew Logs are decent. . . everything else. . . .not so much, but its literally babby's first boss and ya. ..
---
proof?
---
But u start with 25 gp only... so why unplayable?
---

---
i'm pretty sure i saw a tweet with a mod say that the interface changes are client sided until the last number is entered.
---
it would also make no sense to even have code check every digit so i can't see why a programmer would make it like that.
---
nex was the best boss in rs, and one of the most enjoyable pieces of content in the game.  Raids 1 and 2 wont ever get there being a fake cop out of dungeoneering.
---
thats a good enough point, if you care enough cancel your sub till they fix it
---
There's still open cc's that f2p pk in multi.
---
According to the RS wiki, at the time of this video you couldn't. Apparently they teased the release by adding the Open option to the door, with the sounds you hear in the video, but didn't release Nex for a few months.
---
Kind of a bummer that we can't have secret, reveal-on-release content like this in OSRS because of the polling system, but it's better than letting Jagex have free reign to release shitty unpolled content.
---
That‚Äôs a straight up lie lmao
---
I just want to know
---
How about we also put a player made 4 digit password or pin on the banks so unathorized people cant access it for 7 days?
---
Well, if you lose your whole bank of a couple hundred mills, I reckon your motivation to play also disappears. If you were to have a few items stored, that would get you started into making stacks again.
---
they could just remove emblems from the game in general.
---
The customer support page on the official website.
---
boy something else to add to make ironmen seem even more chadly
---
Damn, I miss nex and these graphics.
---
I can understand u lose motivation. But u can do a lot of stuff to rebuild. And most of the time u come back stronger always.
---

---
Should hopefully give Jagex more time to catch the bots, before the start farming.
---
My guy closed his door with crab claw fingers lmaooo

Maybe jagex will fix how osrs runs on my phone.  I get like 7 fps on my phone.

I miss soul split and turmoil lol
---
Could there be another use for Dwarf weed added to the game. currently their only use is ranging potions which are good but the secondary is one of the few secondaries now that cant be gathered by farming. could we get a potion that is made with dwarf weed and something else that will temporary boost a stat of your choice by 3 or 4 but incurred damage or lowered another random stat by the same amount. the RNG of the spicy stews is annoying and getting a +4 boost for certain skills can be a pain in the arse sometimes.
---
i9-9900X
---
I think he means the Kourend and Kebos diaries. The scroll gives a 2/4/6/8% chance of catching double fish of any kind, with a higher catch rate as you complete higher tier diaries.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs still enough time for bot detection to pick them up?
---
Dude if you don't think 4-5 hours are bursts you're in for a hell of a game mate.
---
isn't revenant a different category then demon though?  like it has demon in its name but its not actually coded as one so i dont think arclight would boost damage on it.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter how easy the stuff is, just needs to increase the time to make the account so they cannot create bots quicker than they can be banned. Also a higher chance they‚Äôre detected before farming emblems for too long. Right now they could just leave tutorial island and be ready in an hour lol
---
the ge will not be removed idk what gives people the impression that it would be.
---
I think that as long as the bot accounts are banned frequently, this is definitely a good change. Keep the reporting up!
---
Except even "solid red" and "solid blue" states are not actually so. California is the third most Trump voting state for example. It's would be impossible to win an election just by having the majority in those three states.
---
Also, yes, it would be great for democracy if each person's vote was weighed equally. That's sort of what democracy is.

Why does allowing them to be sold on the GE help?

---
Would still be benefitial to have a small cash-stack ready for the rebuild
---
No one knows if it's good enough yet. Let's wait and see in a week or two. Or couple of months, since the bot creators might try and mask their activity for a while when the area's highlighted.
---
They could, but I think that they should find a better reason than "bots exploit them" to remove them, and don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that those better reasons don't exist, but I'm just saying that considering punishing people who utilize the content legitimately purely because there's people out there that utilize it illegitimately isn't right.
---
You gotta realize even only working 4 hours a day is sweet. When I clock in, I have to work all 8 hours.
---
Agreed. I've become a terrible person by playing it. Btw.
---
Nah he is ready for the inferno
---
He stands alone üòî
---
Those are some of the freest kills with a decent payout so it's not hard to see why he would go for them, I did 90-99 fishing at dark crabs and I'd see people there noting crabs for several hours which would easily make their loot over 1m worth in crabs.
---
I mainly just say that to annoy people. I got extremely lucky and went from mith to drag in less than 20 kc. I think total was less than 200 iirc, so barely took me over two hours, including getting the tokens required.
---
Thanks! I didn't know if anything explicitly gave more scales but I'm hardlocked at the hard diaries until I drag myself back to doing slayer for the hydra
---
I drew the picture but a friend edited it
---
Pretty sure it's a quote from the beginning of his most recent video
---
It's a relatively small community that does random split raids. It'd be hard to change your discord and name change twice just to scam.
---
Luckily when I used wedoraids it was mostly older players with empathy who didn't scam.
---
But with frauds like op these discords gets dissolved pretty quickly i'd imagine. Some people prioritize a small amount of worthless pixels over friendship and integrity.
---
im still saving up my total level :( one day
---
That's not a good argument though. Which is worse from a campaign perspective, ignoring six sparsely-populated states whose population totals 30 million, or one big state, whose populations totals 40 million? obviously everyone's going to try to win over the big state because the interests of 40 million people are greater than that of 30 million.
---
It would definitely be targeted, but I could also see pkers hunting players down for their shrooms, right? Basically, wouldn't the  pkers be able to mitigate this issue by slowing overall resource production? Yes there would be a new stream of items coming to market, but that's also what HA values were created for.
---
Maybe special degradable looting bags could be created for PVP worlds. Purchasable for something like 100-250k to create some gold sink to offset new item production too.
---
You probably won't have to worry about scammers, just do your thing and wait till you get a drop. No pressure or negotitations
---
i mean they created emblems because of people who were not risking anything, i never agreed with that reasoning in the first place.  Then again i also disagree with the pure gp drops from rev caves which bring in a shit ton of gp as well.  feels counter productive to introduce gp into the game like that while also trying to create gold sinks.
---
troll I assume.
---
Hence melting a dragon metal shield would create a dragon metal shard lol. I'm confused about what part of forging the platebody doesn't make sense.
---
that's probably the plan.
---
Or a listing fee instead.
---
Back in my elementary and middle school days I got scammed a bunch of times. First I tried drop trading my Adamant 2h and cash stack (like 20K) for a Scythe. Later I saw a guy with a Bone spear and he explained how it was the best item in members but I was still free, but when I became a member he would sell it to me. So I gave him my Rune 2h and some more gold for it and later realized it was horrible and he blocked me. And finally I got scammed out of some Guthix trimmed armor by some dude saying a Hollow Reed was really rare and valuable. 
---
After those I don't think I ever got scammed again. I learned a lot back in those days. And every scam that's still running is insanely obvious I have no idea how people still fall for them. 
---
Anyway Jakeyosaurus has videos explaining every common lure so that's helpful.
---
There should be a mini game or something where you get to rob the bank to train thieving, like in the little clip you can watch of the mysterious old man robbing the draynor bank

---
I usually just pray mage and use ranged out of it's melee range, but still, the poison is hella obnoxious
---
Lol you‚Äôre just making my argument easier by bringing up LA. It‚Äôs another point on why EC should stay. These larger cities like LA are very left leaning, all large cities are for the most part. So not only do you have small areas of land filled with people who think the same, but you‚Äôre also excluding a lot of people in rural areas who get no say. Seems fair. Listen man the people in the fly over states have just as many problems and as people in cities and getting rid of the ec will just fuck them over even more.
---
preach brother, preach
---
Me and my friend raided with randoms once and one got a scroll worth 200m at the time and we all pretended like we had agreed to split it and he ended up doing it lol. But if we had gotten anything we wouldnt have split shit.
---
/u/doing_a_clue I addressed your topic here, brotha.
---
Last paragraph re: suboptimal account builds. "Nooby" players may still be able to kill other noobs.
---
Bc of the way bracketing works on PVP worlds, low leveled players would still be able to adequately target level 3 skillers, higher leveled noobs would be able to attack those players as well, and so on until we reach Max mains.
---
Essentially, my argument is that this mechanic could incentivize skillers an pvmers to participate, therefore recreating the pvp food chain.
---
I commented in the above thread for you, brotha
---
They could also remove masterfarmers, zulrah, vorkath, and about 99% of the game in general with that logic.
---
Also can work for banking equipment while getting lured..:
---
Therapy might be useful to you buddy, help you release all this pent up anger and rage you have.
---
3x 85 combat stats would get you into an LPC at the time when the scene was just restarting and many of the people had multiple accounts already so they just couldn't be arsed.
---
The problem now is the bots are back to work as soon as jagex bans them. It‚Äôs just another layer where now it‚Äôs a 1 day lag period before the bots can come back. And they also now have to survive 25 hours of their normal bot detection.  So it may not fix them all, but it definitely makes it harder and creates a thinning of the herd before they can get to the BA world
---
Sure but what's the relation to that to my post? I don't understand.
---
If your wearing proper God items you can exit combat in time after getting a key
---
You're so good!!!!!!!!!!
---
What‚Äôs a bank
---
The anxiety came from dying on your last attempt before heading to bed then lying there thinking about it for the next hour while trying to fall asleep
---
Damn, I hope the internet police don't throw him in jail
---
What...? You could just make the accounts and wait 2 weeks, this actually requires credit
---
That may be good also, but sometimes a listing doesnt sell. Would you get the money back from the listing fee if you redacted your listing?
---
What mods work on what is public knowledge.   
---
There are plethora of mmos that do not have 1\\10th of the bot problem WoW does. the ones that do usually don't care to address it...like runescape.   
---
I find people who try to use walls of text redundant, but here I am replying to you anyway.
---
Well I'm only concerned about emblem farming, and since you can't do that in f2p I'm perfectly fine having no req in f2p
---
The issue with total level cap is that you're forcing players who have pures to level up skills they don't want to level, which I don't think is fair tbh.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted a bank heist quest.
---
Fly over states can be dealt with by local politics. Trust me. I live in Rural MN, I know what it's like to feel "ignored" but that's where my local rep comes into play. You make it seem as if fly over states will lose there represantation, when they will still have it at a local level.
---
Your arguement, outside of the US, would be crazy. No one gives a ahit about land area, more votes = more wins. Life isn't fair, and if you feel "ignored" because you chose to live in bumfuck, boofoo, sorry. Just don't look at popular vote numbers from like, any years.
---
Bots aren't people
---
Sooner than later jagex has to. If it gets too late their player base would already of moved on to a new game. Unless they want to do the engine work for group Ironman. I believe it would be superior for the casual approach to fe life. Vs a smaller community(hcuim) within one of the smallest communities(uim) there is for the game.
---
These people are most likely new and just need a little guidance. Let‚Äôs be real most of us didn‚Äôt learn how to play this game on our own.
---
r/woosh
---
Literally lost 2.5m like this at lavas two days ago. Rip.
---
I've been edging the last seven days. and its cake day.. now to find that gf ;)
---
&gt;So if I just hit all of the healers once they won't heal Jad anymore?
---
Yes
---
&gt;And if they attack me, won't I die?
---
Probably not. They aren't particularly strong. You can also run in a long straight line to drag them into a line so that only 1 attacks you. If you are very very low on food this might pose a problem but if you get to jad with a couple brews you'll be fine.
---
What about changing ur rsn 2x?
---
Why does this read like a twitch prime advertisement
---
Every raid is a ffa if it‚Äôs my drop.
---
I love your attitude lmao
---
You can still pvp. You just can't get emblems.
---
Yes, there's tens of them! Well, probably less than that. Like 3
---
With the update to emblems any chance we get an update to death mechanics of BH items in PvM? Only having to worry about buying your pouch once seems a lil redundant for arguably one of if not the most valuable items in the game. Also worth mentioning it is always lost in pvp situations. Would like to see MA2 cape lost on death in pvm as well. /u/jagexacorn
---
Playing on my mac I'm afraid. Doesn't quite work the same as WMK.

Oh hey. I used to play with this guy like 10 years ago lol. I guess he got into osrs. He also owns the name ‚ÄúA Level 2‚Äù.

---
i commend you good sir.
---
7-8 sara brews, 1-2 range pots and the rest super restores. 
---
Take some purple sweets if you want to heal up in between rounds. 
---
Also can I suggest a couple of chinchompa's for the healers, as you can hit multiple healers with one throw.
---
Good luck!
---
&gt; The wall exists to protect whatever is inside from dangerous enemies. 
---
no that would be the ditch...
---
Most iron really don't even do bountyhunter for real and boosting is looked down upon. I also don't really understand how making something untradable tradable influences ironmen in any way since it'll stay untradable for them regardless
---
The slay xp/hr is pretty bad
---
Well, you could jerk off while doing one of the many things that can be done efficiently using one hand.
---
You're not really winning me over here, try coming up with a specific example.
---
Here i'll even go first. Closest thing i can think of is rev caves, but that's more because it promotes paying for protection which goes against the spirit of the game mode. I feel that's a fair critique.
---
Summoning is a dope skill and honestly pretty old school when you think about it. It just needed to be more balanced. Like you said it was almost like slayer part 2 bc of how much dead content it brought to life.
---
How does this fight against emblem farmers? Now they can just sell them to the Grand Exchange.
---
What????, my whole life.. is a lie
---
Well I looked it up. Wow. Holy shit. I downvoted myself. TIL
---
*wise old man approves*
---
Very cool invitation. I'll try to be there!
---
Yet it still lags while on Jad and I get one shot lolol
---
Because I'm referring to them right?
---
it was more so related to the idea that since this change is meant to combat farming and meant to encourage BH rune pouches should be lost on death in PVM, since they always are in PVP...which I agree with. safemode pvp with only 100k risk to recover you items is overall bad for the game
---
please explain
---
it's ok if you can't make it I still love you
---
That's just not how the community worked. It was mostly you went there, saw people spamming their ccs, and off you went. After the 150 rule was implemented people started using discords, but it just died off so fast it never caught on.
---
The crossbow is ~1/300 from lucky imps
---
Agree, they were the first Slayer "milestone" back in the day and it doesnt make sense that they were left out. Pyrefiends have one ffs
---
This needs to happen.
---
Because you could create an account and wait 14 days to become a member...??
---
Man, I fuckin' hate Cerb. She just feels poorly designed.
---
Why would you use your teeth? I understand the werewolf deathslide but why here?
---
Dear god no. What i've heard from people and read online about the behind the scenes of Twitch creeps me out too much. Moderators helping out female streamers to receive sexual favors and so on.
---
Cries in Germany circa early 1900s
---
I rarely see anyone complain in the Ironman community, unless it's normal things like going dry for an item. Idk why this sub has such a hard-on for hating Ironman accounts. 
---
It's funny, because despite them thinking about us constantly, I never think about them due to playing alone lmao
---
Exactly! Just remove all drops in the game besides gold
---
Your mac will have integrated graphics on the CPU. I believe the GPU plugin is only for dedicated GPU's
---
Accurate
---
If you ever partkate in f2p iron grind 500 total is actually exciting lol. 750 is super exciting.
---
A lot of people call it aids but i find f2p ironman mode to be runescape in its purest form of autism.
---
Jagex already won, even before today's update. Both major emblem farms had stopped running due to drastically increased ban rates, instant flagging (bots getting banned right after killing/dying in BH), and the Twitch Prime promo ending, making it impossible to maintain a farm of that size. If it was only the total level + playtime change, goldfarmers could simply throw more CPU power at the issue.
---
Sometimes the universe aligns and you get things like this.
---
no
---
Can someone explain this to me? Why would this be any different than running into a normal player?
---
Keep fighting the good fight
---
Do you have any reccomendations of good welfare gear I can use to try and snag some PKs on rev PKers?
---
 I'm not looking to risk like 20M+ skulling in the rev caves haha
---
I always feel bad killing them in the wildy lol
---
Ahhhhh cool, that's an interesting mechanic. Thanks for the info.
---
ironmen only players get upset when new content isn't ironman friendly?   
---
I'm not sure how difficult that is to grasp?
---
yeah :(
---
The fact that you're comparing video editting with a 2007 browser game says a lot.
---
This is exactly why I switched to ironman.
---
And an extra trap when hunting in the wild.
---
nice. best of luck with that my brethren!
---
I swear to god stop reposting this or I will commit sodoku
---
I think they're talking about the new Song of the Elves quest, which was going to require fairytale part 1 (which awards attack and magic xp). They later announced they were cutting the part of the quest that required fairy ring use.
---
&gt;To be fair, you can though. 
---
It is possible but you need to get lucky even with 99 range rigour. If you whiff a couple as the healers show up and they get him to full you can't consistently outdps them for a full jad health bar.
---
because you guys suck.   
---
Next question.  
---
HCIM btw

check out the dwarven cannon quest for some real fun

What gave it away? The calendar?

I was going to bring my parents but my mom says she was already invited? Please explain.

Does that make you feel better? Lmao
---
It's an animation stall using an item that makes your character remain in place until the animation is finished despite your character actually moving. Their character appears to be in the safe zone but is actually out of it so when you trade them, you move out of the safe zone as well.
---
Same question?
---
how big of a % is that?
---
I see say more posts complaining about btws complaining than actual btws complaining.
---
Nah, it's more like the thermal design of macbooks has always been fucky, they prefer them to run hot because fans are loud and loud is bad.
---
Though runescape is pretty inefficient i suppose.  i've run overwatch on this machine and thermal wise it's about the same.
---
All I've ever played as a kid were inefficient f2p accounts back before rs3 existed, came back last year and figured I'd try ironman mode. Nearly 1700 total now, no regrets at all. I honestly don't understand why people think you need to have played normal mode before trying ironman.
---
Maybe it's mostly just because I'm a mix of efficiency- and afkscape, and being a normie would just resulted in me camping a single activity for gold and buying all other skills with it. At least now I'm forced to explore all kinds of content, while still allowing for me to be efficient within those boundaries.
---
Some ironmen have mains with money and they pay their halves, or take their half on their main.
---
RuneScape is like the habbo hotel ~~California~~
---
runescape gold isnt even facing an inflation yet, if anything its in a deflation.
---
Honestly barrows gloves is a great main goal at first. Then idk you defenders, fire cape, and void those are just off the top of my head
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄJagex powerless against capital letters (and non case-sensitive passwords) ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
yes.   
---
it should be risked because of how strong it is...just like it is in pvp.   
---
it didn't.
---
This is good. They also said this total level limit will be flexible so this is gonna be an ongoing effort.
---
I‚Äôm curious about what kind or extent of effects a massive bot bust (like the bot nuke years ago) would have on the economy of the game, assuming it would be successful.
---
Lol i hear you. I mainly 8v8ed and busted zergs. Played Palomides Iseult and Lancelot. Still friends with 3 of my old guild mates and we met back in 2003. I consider one of them one of my closest friends and visited him before
---
Could do some kind of range tank.
---
I think there would be backlash from pvm'ers in general default mode or ironman mode doesn't matter. Ofcourse ironmen would be hit harder because getting one through slayer points or wildy slayer is rather slow (but good enough for getting it once). Also many of them are following regular account progression rather than making a pvp build which would put them at quite a large disadvantage.
---
I think the biggest problem with it from an ironmen perspective would be that it would promote boosting with bountyhunter again because for ironmen the rune pouch isn't balanced around being somewhat disposable. A common argument against something like that is "shouldn't ironmen be hard, you chose to limit yourself". To which i'd say that it's fair that things are difficult. But they should atleast be balanced around a certain difficulty level and plenty of people seem to think it is fine as is right now. Harder to deal with does not necesarrily mean more fun.
---
I do think pvm could do with a bit more risk but i'm not quite sure what form that would need to take...
---
&gt; One that I can‚Äôt wait to be on, for better or for worse, for a long time to come!
---
Couldn't have said it better myself. Really hoping the game stays as fascinating as it is right now and i have something to come back to whenever there's time.
---
How long did void take you, out of curiosity?
---
you already lose it in pvp, bud. The only community that would freak out is the btws.
---
sorry been out of the running, but i mean the original runescape, before runescape 2
---
I don't need 7 pots. The food I have lasts me about 7 kills a trip on average and I have 6 pots which last around the same amount of time
---
FairyTale Part 1 requires Nature Spirit that rewards defence exp. Which for a series of quests that's 7 quests long that had never had a defence requirement and was mostly focused on puzzles and annoying agility obstacles it was largely an arbitrary addition and was rightly removed. 
---
It didn't add anything to the quest to have it and would have limited a sizeable community of players from new content and a new city for no discernible reason. Saying otherwise is disingenuous and beguiles ulterior motives.
---
I haven't been crashed much on the iron but when I do you bet your ass i'll waste all my supplies so neither of us get the loot/world.
---
The only somewhat successful crash i've seen was at giant mole, the dickhead had a tbow and full arma which is better than dharoks for some reason. I couldn't destroy the loot at all in 10 kills and was only helping him. I would've given up there but he thanked me for the assistance so I came back with bronze darts and graceful, when the mole is less than half hp there's a 50% chance of it digging whenever it receives a hit, regardless of it being a 0 or not. I threw darts to chase the mole around the cave system for a half an hour until the crasher raged at me and hopped, at that point I didn't want to kill mole anymore, I just logged out and played something else for a while.
---
Could always sell lvl 1 emblems anyways.
---
They were using the jagex owned models.
---
Gotta get through the 2k irit seeds from contracts somehow
---
well Jagex didn't threaten them, but a lot of people on Reddit started saying to OSHD "if you send the files to Jagex they will sue you bla bla" so they never did. There was A LOT of support for the client so i'm unsure why they just threw the project away so fast
---
The area looks like dogshit for a start
---
They're about the same AFK but Sacred Eels have an interesting niche in that they're technically the best cooking xp/hr in the game if you bank the Eels to cut later.
---
Sacred Eels are marginally better gp/hr if you bank them to cut later, about the same if you don't though so it's heavily dependent on scale prices. Although Infernal Eels are much better XP/hr.
---
One person's opinion is not fact.
---
Shouldn't be too bad, if my math is on point, taking into account the amount of hours i was averaging a day with the sacred eels, I should be able to get 99 woodcutting from 75 in just over a month.
---
So i was gunna post this regardless today that ive gotten 6 fucking tails but then i rolled the pet.
---
I still want my claw though Jigglyflux. 
---
Id like to note that 5 heads,the jars and 5 tails were before 900kc.
---
Also hit almost the entire rare drop table. And have received every seed drop multiple times...
---
boosting it again? It stopped? when?   
---
Making there be no risk involved with op items is a huge part of why the economy is the way it is right now....which is one of the main selling points of ironman mode, if this thread is to be believed.
---
I'm not sure how you can write either of those things with a straight face.
---
First off, you need the top eleven states to reach 50% of the population. The top three states containing more population than the rest of the country is not remotely true.
---
Second, it does matter how each person within a state votes in a popular vote scenario. In fact, it matters how every single person votes. If a candidate only scores 40% of the votes in those eleven big states, and scores 62% of the votes in the remaining smaller states, that candidate wins. Even with the popular vote you don't need to win a single big state to win the election.
---
Yes, those servers were shut down for good not too long ago. Unfortunately your account is gone.
---
When are you implementing a gmaul change? If at all?
---
In the name of my master, you are under arrest bankers
---
Never say never. They threw a lot of money on RS Mobile just for it to flop.
---
Are the overhead protection prayers not being buffed to 60% damage reduced instead of 40%?
---
Lol I mean there's a ditch you gotta jump and a big warning the first time you enter no?
---
Like if you get tricked it's because your being greedy. 
---
If you bring valuable items to a clearly marked area people can kill you because your going to get a bunch of money for doing it some guy says, you literally deserve to be tricked lmao. Let's not babysit people to much.
---
Added but I never have private on public, don't know about you ahah
---
I'm at 366 kc. Only thing I'm missing is the pet.
---
We all know it's true
---
Imagine being so young that you actually watch Youtube poop.
---
good thing mine is backed up by a highly publicized event that happened in the game history. When they killed the wild and the player base halved. Maybe you heard about it. The game has never been as popular as it was since.
---
The tags make it easier for lazier people or people learning their switches.
---
I had to use it for Zulrah for all the switches, it just helps you and it's organized. Really isn't as bad as these guys are saying

‚ÄúYou name should should‚Äù 
---
Can‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre done after that epic comeback? You wanna come at me and not finish what you started? 
---
Guess that expected from someone who can‚Äôt even pick up sarcasm lmao
---
Sounds like a botter that's butthurt and just wants to bot.
---
They should remake this boss, someone should push for it and then have them poll it
---
&gt;"iron btw", "gz but can you do it on an iron" like fucking hell lmao
---
Says /u/hcforever
---
I did it!!!! After 2 more attempts. I used Rapid, pulled some of the healers, and just kept my eyes on switching prayers. One healer was still on him but I just fought through it. I found a really good Jad simulator that I practice on for about 10 minutes beforehand. That helped tremendously.
---
personally i find it interesting that it's 2k19 and there are still bots.. you'd think after a few years they'd figure out a preventive formula..
---
You got the bug... it's nice isn't it
---
I believe the majority of us prefer the 2008-2010 era of RS - That is why OSRS is turning into a non HD version of RS2. I do hope that we someday will get the amazing HD option
---
I mean there's no toilet so where else do you expect Cerb to go?
---
Exactly. There is a pretty specific pattern for me. I come back to the game after a few months break and am very motivated. Lvling skills and generally playing the game and enjoying myself. After a few months however my mind catches up with me and is like "Yo wtf is the point of lvling 78 RC?" Then its like the meaning of rs dissapears and I go staking. Usually I win a lot at first but eventually I lose it all. Then im like hahaaa nice...! I wanted to quit anyway...its best for me. While I secretly know I will come back.
---
When you're in Venezuela and your choices are
---
"kill mammoth on runescape with 700 accounts" or "eat rodents for breakfast"
---
It probably isnt as big of a deal
---
Ok, pvp is fine, reddit is just a bunch of people crying about things that aren't actually issues. I doubt most people on reddit even know the basics of pking.
---
PS: Reddit wanted to remove 1-tick prayer flicking. Lol.
---
aaaaaand you missed your flight
---
I just hit lv85 rc and I'm going for 99... this hit a little too close to home.
---
Ugh, I'm really not excited about void. Defender for sure. Maybe the fighter torso? Is the torso even worth it?
---
why not just make rune pouch tradable and be done with it?
---
The wiki is wrong, never trust them for their rates/guides. They assume inconsistent catch rates for that guide, where Infernal Eels are about 90% of their efficient rate while Sacred Eels are only about 80%. The XP/hr of sacred eels is far lower still but in terms of GP/hr, they end up about even if you AFK cut the eels for both but an advantage of Sacred Eels is that you can bank them at the chest nearby to mass-cut them later and it works out to be more gp/hr if you do so. I don't agree with the negligible XP part though but I did it an alt with 99 Fishing and Cooking so the XP didn't really matter to me.
---
Who else here is going ? :)
---
I haven't seen this. Most ironmen are quiet and just playing fairly efficiently
---
Hodor
---
That comment is the biggest evidence that you don't actually pk.
---
Also, I've never had a fire Cape. Young me was too stubborn to beat Jad so it never happened. That's the last goal I have in mind.
---
Unironically I think its more like 15 for me.
---
Just don't touch balls and it isn't gay.
---
I know so how does this change anything? If anything it helps them because the bots are already farming them to upgrade them and it just makes it more convenient for them to sell them at tier 10. Instead of having to trade them in for Battle axes or whatever.
---
Makes even less sense for zulrah tbh. There are only two sets of gear you are using, range and mage just click on the gear. But ya I guess it's ok for learning
---
You're not going to know how someone performs until you're half way through the raid.
---
Ok honey :)
---
Btw?
---
With questing I‚Äôm guessing 300 total is do able in under 25 hours?
---
Plenty of RSPS have these things! Go play that
---
Made my day lmao
---
More than a friend considering how much time you spend with a hand in his pants.
---
it doesnt make it any slower though. Or even much more work. Theres already scripts to automate skilling -- the only part thats delayed is the first batch of bots, who needed to wait the 25+ hours. Once those are out, theres already another set of bots skilling and waiting ready to be released the next day, and so-on. 
---
By the time the first wave of bots gets banned, the second, third, fourth, and fifth wave are already in the works. based on your TLDR you're assuming that they only have one set of bots at a time; and thats incorrect. Bot accounts are disposable. Botters expect their bots to be banned, and as such they're always creating more.
---
Dark crabs are even more afk, you can afk full 5min, or just before you get idle log out
---
Obviously boosting still happens. However it's only a minor fraction of what used to be 95% (if not more) of ironmen before wildy slayer and the ability to buy em with slayer points. It's also generaly looked down upon by most ironmen nowadays.
---
I do agree pvm could use some more risk but i don't think shredding through rune pouches is the way.
---
Reminder that the endgame of any game is the forums.
---
please, everyone knows that Verac is homosexual.
---
About 10k xp/hr lower but the same gp/hr if you have 99 cooking. It's like 7k xp/hr lower and 50k gp/hr more though if you bank them and manually cut Sacred Eels later, which isn't an option for Infernal Eels.
---
well if someone afks 25 hours then goes emblems its pretty bannable in itself
---
Why not give Torag a passive effect to remove run energy, then have his hammers' special attack bind players for 5 seconds, similar to the tent whip? I think that'd make my boy Torag pretty sick
---
I wonder if Jagex can tell what account is on a free trail vs what account isn't. If they can tell your idea is great. At least this is slowing them down a little tho, only can have 6/7 free days to farm now.
---
But at that point your not luring new players your luring idiot wealthy players
---
Most lures are done on people who think they can anti-lure, and don't even use the wild.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing though, the game flourished when it was punishing. Being able to risk nothing for the chance at the best/most expensive item in the game is not a good design philosophy.
---
yea, that's what he said lol
---
Support
---
I bound it to one of my mouse buttons (esc) so i could do RC (and a ton of other shit) way easier
---
I'd still consider agility like 10% of the brainpower required for RC. Agility with the big green boxes can be done by an infant multitasking.

First time i did Al Kharid course i laughed my ass off, and i would not have done that if the course was boring

&gt; Straight up shilling HRT. It doesn't matter if it's in meme format or not.
---
Let me translate that meme for you. 
---
It's a egg saying "I'm going to start hrt, not because I'm trans but because of these effects I find desirable".
---
You somehow interpret that as 'shilling'? Just listing the common effects of HRT is not 'shilling'.
---
Nobody is telling anyone else to do anything.
---
&gt; Yep, it mentions dysphoria. Not sure why you felt like giving me your definition of that. Did you feel that it doesn't relate to the sub? It's being discussed regardless.
---
The dog has 'ME' written on it, again proving it's a self-post.
---
Conclusion, none of your examples support your idiotic belief
---
Yeah thanks for mobile, I honestly never play on a computer. Stuck in traffic? Runescape. Waiting for a flight? Runescape. Long wait at the doctor's office? Runescape. Theres never a time I cant play unless I'm at work or driving. Mobile is great for clocking in many hours.
---
Its funny u pretend new players arent gonna buy gp.
---
Hell yeah
---
Even if you're a pro, using tools like this can only make you better. If it saves even a tiny amount of brainpower, you can invest that brainpower elsewhere and be even more of a pro.
---
That's literally how 90% of us learned
---
That's exactly what it is, this isn't new information or anything dude.
---
thas one thic boi
---
i know from private servers what kinda tracking is possible in rs. they can track where the money went and see who its traded to. so they can just ban the player that has the money on it even if they are friends the money will be gone and the hacked persons bank can be restored

At lvl 90 fishing, I get 35k xp/hr + ~260k gp/hr. No risk and no banking needed.

Definitely not something to flaunt but it's still great to never worry about burning shit again!

It is a place for people questioning their gender to poke fun at their own denialism. If they decide they are cis, good for them! Nobody is forcing them to do anything.

That's why I said wishing you were the other gender is a SIGN that you MIGHT be trans. Not a guarantee. I was careful with my wording.

Tbh i shouldn't complain. I got 4 claws and 5 rings within 2k too lol.

I really love your artwork! You've got that skill of putting emotion into something abstract and dreamy. I remember your blue dragon one from a while back, keep going!

I believe he's talking specifically about emblem farming bots, there are other more sophisticated bots that are harder to detect.
---
How often do pkers come to pk dark crab fishermen?

Pretty much all of them besides Sire and Kraken

Thanks for sharing been playing for about over a year now again after stopping and had no clue these were a thing. Will be doing these in a couple levels now!
---
You can't imp box chins when a pker shows up. Black chins are over lv30 wild, so you'd have to run down to 30 wild, plus not be in combat, in order to bank them. And if you're in combat, you would just teleport away.
---
except...it shouldn't be? if I'm doing wildy slayer with a looting bag and die, guess what happens. If I get pk'd with a looting bag, guess what happens.
---
Makes sense.
---
I've noticed how bad my core strength is doing behind the head tricep extensions, I find it puts so much strain. Definitely my goal is to improve my core strength this summer
---
'Touch and hold delay' option in your phone's accessibility settings?
---
It was hacked together and a client mod. It‚Äôs completely different than pushing a fully fledged feature live. It also means for future content they have to create double the assets and consider double the possibilities. It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù texture swap or an animation swap, it‚Äôs far more involved.
---
it does because it has been abused before, it relies on things like your payment method, internet provider, ip, account creation, old passwords (one of my accs is from 2006, by then I used some really shitty passwords non-exclusive to rs, probably leaked by now!).. those are not total secrets like a one-time generated code would be.

Jagex arbitration is the only way of me being hijacked, and currently exists. I has happened before, heck, even a Jmod was involved in a scheeme to abuse that system kek

---
Hey, I used to bot as of today when my main was banned, I ensure you that this is not the case, jagex's bot detection systems are really as good as they say. I only botted reasonable times with premium scripts, I got caught doing 2 hours of blast furnace fyi, i was banned shortly after going to the grand exchange manually and gathering items for ds2. I did quite a lot of hours babysitting this script to ensure the bot was not poorly coded. I get a little upset by people who rag on jagex's systems.
---
the majority of bots with large amount of xp are
---
1.bought hand crafted
---
2.in remote areas of the game where it is unlikely to be found and reported
---
3.customs scripts where jagex cant use the similarity of movements between multiple accounts
---
I would do anything for this
---

 Took around \~11 days to complete, averaged around 3mil per session with hourly gp ranging from 340k-600k depending how lucky I was with alchables.
---
That's a fair point
---
what's your average points? i get everywhere from 170 to 200 when im lucky
---
No, range pot rigour blowpipe ddarts is still more dps than turmoil ovl chaotics. That's why everyone brings it up when chaotics are mentioned as some overpowered class of weapon

What is a core? (Probaly a noob question)

Typical ironmeme :)
---
What if it was like 2-3 hours a day per day for 7 days or something like that?
---
&gt; The **only** community that would freak out is the btws.
---
There would be an outcry from everyone not ironmen specifically
---
You obviously didn't grow up next to my neighbor, she had big bazongas since she was like 10. It was unreal
---
seeing as the question was about other popular mmos that don't have the same quality of bot problems, no, it wasn't. We were talking about multiplayer online games and their bot problems and LoL is that.   
---
This is a weird 'gotcha' attempt.
---
Any goals after that?
---
I too am out of the loop.  Would like to know what the crabs are about.
---
The thing about a total level restriction is it forces bots to use multiple scripts to train multiple stats.  If any of those scripts is compromised, the bot can be detected and shut down and best of all, THE BOT MAKER WONT KNOW WHICH SCRIPT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED
---
U need the key once i think, after that u can kill boss unlimited
---
Mo'rokai?
---
You can only ever get one key. Once you unlock the boss you don't need more keys to fight them again
---
99% chance you did not match, I'd wager

1def pures can kill both sire and kraken with the slayer lvl
---
I wonder if he's even wearing ferocious gloves?
---
Nah, HD graphics were trash.
---
However, I wouldn't be opposed to adding better lighting effects like sprites and other ambient lighting.
---
I will say, the only thing I like about rs3, is that you can toggle daytime/night lights.
---
Lmfao that screenshot

I added the picture. Do you see it? Sorry kinda new to reddit

What‚Äôs the difference between those two points
---
Anyone have a link to the dungeon ash linked too?

just add hazelmere's signet ring to the table and call it a day
---
Yes please, I miss GWD style bosses so much. Nex was actually a really cool boss, with some revised drops it would be a good addition to osrs.
---
I'm saying this as someone who exclusively plays iron.
---
Legend has it he lures the whole room of kalphites with his darts before equipping his rune longsword and going afk for 20 mins at a time.
---
It‚Äôs hard but doable to write a bot that does one thing very well and undetectable.  It‚Äôs very hard to write a script that does many things so well that none of the actions trigger the bot watchg.
---
never thought of that one to be fair aha
---
Nah
---
You can do nearly anything on a 1 defense build, just takes a bit more skill
---
He's trying to suggest I said there's currently an item that they can't get, when I'm suggesting it'd be ok if something was implemented they couldn't? Seems very different to me personally.
---
I think 1 Def pures would have to trap all the scions and run behind Sire to avoid getting piled, but I'm not sure if that's foolproof.
---
I think a good buff would be draining 50% of their run energy to restore 25% of your run energy. A good hit or two basically ensures you can keep up with them since the armor is so heavy
---
Because it is. Fuck Graceful, it removes decision making from the game, it's boring as hell to get, and it's ugly as hell. Catch me in my Boots of lightness, Penance gloves, and Spotted cape

LAUGHING MY ASS OFF AT THAT ONE BUDDY

Beltless squats and deadlifts will do the trick, also ab wheel if you have access to one. That thing blew my core up like no other, was stuck at a 715 deadlift for like 4-5 months, switched to a different gym and the owner saw me fail a lift and he just handed me an ab wheel and said "use this, it will make your deadlift go up" lol he wasn't lying, core strength is super underrated.
---
"search peramiters; 300 total, ~25 hours played" easier than searching all players to ban them. Maybe idk I'm not a fucking computer surgeon.
---
Yeah I see it now. Sorry dont know what it is, though I think I've seen a similar post before
---
He just did

Fair enough. I should've said 'the largest freak out would be the btws'.

an ironman called iron olive has done both bosses in his videos on a 1 def ironman

Been playing since I was about 11 and I'm turning 21 soon, I still check it out every now and then. It's a very unique game and if you give the game time, trust me you will get addicted to it. Best of luck on the grind.

Also, they would need custom scripts for every single stat they need to train and if any of them fail, the bot will be caught and banned hours before it gets to the Wild.

That's partly why I do it man. It's not just the extra gaming time but its just the extra time of your life not spent sleeping. When you add up how much of our lives we sleep through, we are losing a lot of time that way. If you can train yourself to feel good on 6 (it's not for everyone, granted) then I recommend it.

Thanks for the advice, my gym doesn't but they are only ¬£7 on Amazon, I can get one for home though.
---
There are barely enough PKers to make Chaos Altar and Black Chins dangerous. I see maybe 1-2 Pkers an hour there. If you think that there will be enough PKers to cover the entire PVP world when there aren't enough to cover profitable wilderness sites, then you are delusional about the state of PVP.
---
Another problem is that it will drastically change the meta of skilling. Nobody would want that.
---
And again, Jagex has said they are not interested in continuing the Hunter vs Rogue interaction that all "PVP content" has been up to this point because it hasn't worked.
---
Good to know, thank you! Not having to bank is legendary, you‚Äôre really only missing out on cooking exp I take it? Which really isn‚Äôt a big deal

Oh seriously? I thought it was like skitzo. That's awesome

Look up lord shayne‚Äôs defender guide on YouTube, it‚Äôll make defender the easiest role, and the vid is short and to the point. 
---
I had never played it before, and following the guide I made it through all the waves without missing a defender. 
---
Also don‚Äôt worry too much about not knowing how to play every role perfectly, with random teams incompetence is the norm
---
Takes one to know one...
---
Yup they do this every time, these brain dead morons eat it up, and then complain that it isn't working a month later. It doesn't slow shit down, the bots adapt, they rarely ever get banned easier, and it just ends up only fucking over the game or real players. Bunch of fucking infants on here.

It's a term for ironman, because it became a running joke that some ironman identify themselves as "I'm an ironman btw"

If you've still got that itch, the Phoenix freeshard is going pretty strong with 300-500 players on one server at a time. It's ran by some of the dudes who worked at Mythic in the good ol days.

---
Alright, my mistake. In which case I completely agree, a portion of the community has some severely mean-tinted glasses on when it comes to any type of PvP really. I thought your comment was directed towards the more-or-less proposed change.
---
Don‚Äôt, I like it now.
---
I agree to this so much. I did one task of cerb (221 kills) and got ONE peg crystal. That's it. I then blocked hell hounds and will NEVER do that boss again unless they change the stupid fucking mechanics. Every single one of my deaths was because of a growl at the same time as the spirits. Attack? Sure. Growl? No. 
---
One thing I would like to add is the triple attack is every 40 seconds.
---
think in the greater scheme of things. this is not only a quest, this is access to a complete new set of weapons (they all require crystal shards), a new agility course and most importantly: it would be the first time a minigame is locked for a sizeable amount of the community. 
---
of course you dont have to cater to everyone and always. but sometimes when there is no reason to exclude a part of your community, why do you need to create unnecessary drama? lets be as inclusive as we can be without making things easy.
---
i believe if you design a grandmaster quest, it should have real requirements. quests are a walk in the park. what about 90+ in major stats and a challenge that is inbetween zulrah and the inferno? that would be a real quest only for grandmasters. and everybody would have a shot at trying it

---
wow your poor little sissy ears... cry in the corner cuz you saw a cuss word little timmy
---
Yeah, but that doesn't matter because you won't notice them till they are doing exactly that, making money.
---
You're not going to notice the 400 accounts they now have randomly leveling and building play time to do this act. Literally they will be leveling 100 accounts per day, every day, and on the 3rd or 4th day, they are prepped for emblem farming, and they will probably get banned the same day, so they emblem farm all day, mule, and get banned. 
---
The only cost Jagex has increased is the prep time. Each accounts breakeven cost will go up $0.08 per day till the account is farming, that is the price of power and other needed things for each account to run for the day. So a net value loss per account of $0.24 or so to meet this requirement, so they will have to farm an extra 500,000 gold for their new break even.
---
&gt;A friend told me that the player numbers for OSRS now surpass RS3. Is that true?
---
Yes, there are far more OSRS players than RS3 players, even discounting the bots.
---
&gt;What did RS3 do wrong?
---
Many things. But don't let them stop you from giving RS3 a try and form you own personal impression of the game instead of just conforming to what other OSRS players think of it. Remember that buying membership for OSRS also gives you membership for RS3, so you not making the most out of your money if you do not even give RS3 a try.

They're in favor of content that doesn't hurt their specific PK build*, but you're right they do like the game itself.

Eternal slayer ring -&gt; chain to aberrants (bring nose peg) will considerably shorten down running back. A DWH will do wonders (specs on 1st phase Dusk will transfer over to his second form). Did the pet grind on my 60 att 1 def account too.
---
&gt;One thing I would like to add is the triple attack is every 40 seconds, and CAN occur during the spirit phase.
---
Damn, this is good to know.
---
/r/runescape is still pretty active, something weird going on with the subscriber count.

As I said I know it fluctuates, usually its 2-4m not 12. U 2hed
---
You used a "premium" script on one of the most banned and monitored activities in RS history?
---
Whew. Wonder why you got banned.
---
Sooo because it's not a perfect solution they should just not even try?
---
I wasn‚Äôt either but with mobile it‚Äôs pretty easy to grind out 100-200 points a day while watching tv or doing something else. Void is definitely worth it. Also just finishing up the achievement diaries when you can gives you lots of little things that are really nice. Try to start fairytale 2 so you have access to fairy rings as well
---
I remember being 12 and getting into the original RuneScape (well technically RuneScape 2 but whatever) and feeling this. Hits me right in the feels.
---
Must be thinking about 05 near max. (40 atk 70 str 70 range)
---
Yep, the clan that has a total prep record of like 3-40 in 5 years (imagine only prepping once every like 6 monthsLOLOLOL)
---
Genuinely profound.  I've never seen it put so concisely and accurately before.
---
And since then, with stuff like Vorkath, that 500k/hr everyone rees about at Gargoyles doesn't seem so bad
---
That's not what I'm pointing at though. Meme being the thread or not, some guy, supposedly an ironman, on twitter complaining about some proposed update does not warrant a negative stance towards the btw community.
---
Actually, my biggest issue is when you fail to answer the requests for actual examples on this meme in action.
---
It would require constantly pinging the highscores everytime you saw a player. Or a list of all known ironmen updated daily from name changes or new players.
---
You probably hit the top of their CS queue around the time you made your post.  It's taken me about that long to get responses from CS sans reddit posts in the past
---
They did, you're suppose to get it on 256 KC it's called KQ head (tattered)
---
Kudos for typing this well thought out newb guide
---
It‚Äôs alright. It‚Äôs been ridiculous at this point and before Jagex came out with any PvP related updates; members of the PVP community had to tweet at mods everyday to get anything proposed.
---
Ik you been answered but as people have said, no loot ever spawns if it was the irons kill but he got help.  If that weren‚Äôt the case, there‚Äôd be an incentive to crash irons.
---
While I don't think it will stop bots outright it makes the investment more long term and less profitable. You can't make 100 accounts and get them rolling out the bat, but you can have accounts just getting primed to be used for said botting. I think it will be less oppressive for a little bit but will return to similar levels. The botting problem is really in-addressable because people are willing to make thousands of accounts that get banned within a day, and it doesn't really deter them. 
---
Hell I have a buddy that plays legit now that went through 7 accounts getting banned, he would make a new account bot out agility because he hated it, then play it legit for a while, then say put it on cannonballs and set a bot again and get banned. If this man took 7 times where he was also putting in 100's of hours, imagine how many it will take for those that just let their farm run while watching movies and shit. I really feel for jamflex because it's like an arms race that you will always fall behind in, no matter how fast you bring out a new deterrence it can't compete with a hivemind of lazy industrious nerds finding workarounds. I personally live in fear of being banned even though I never have botted, just running 4 accounts at once like a psychopath.

They had to bring in a load of temps to do this as it required remodelling everything in the game. They would never do it again. That doesn't mean they couldn't though; they're making more profit than they ever have, so if they could afford to do it then, they can more than afford to do it now.
---
I don‚Äôt give a damn about the cuss words, the mom joke is what I found funny
---
Ooh yes, I've considered a stylus.. but I honestly don't really use mobile often.
---
In the context of steam, if someone had access to my email, they would still need to log in with my password and confirm any trades through the mobile app. Changing the password makes my steam account lock down for 7 days without being able to trade. Logging in to a new device (like if they logged in to my account on their phone to confirm trades) would lock my account down for 3 or 7 days, can't remember which. 
---
&gt;I mean that's pretty much the case for any service connected to your email.
---
Yes, but most of those servers are less secure (email is used for complete account control) because those accounts aren't as valuable. This isn't a reddit (or other website) account where you can't trade anything - its an online game with a trading system that has real world implications for getting hacked. You can't really profit much off of cracking someone's reddit account, whereas you can make hundreds or sometimes thousands of dollars for cracking a runescape, steam, WoW, etc account, and so the security needs to be much higher than reddit-level.

Premium scripts aren't premium when they're dirt cheap to begin with and you can also pay for them with gold. You used a public script, don't let the name premium fool you, and got banned for it. You're not going to get caught with a private script and some common sense, in Runescape or any other game for that matter.

I see it constantly on twitter. For example; gathering wines of zammy, or red spiders eggs. Btws expressed concern that the new dungeon doesnt do enough for them( when it already clearly caters to mid level ironmen with spiders eggs, new places to farm herbs, and an instanced boss, and a place to farm and tan red dhide) stating rangint potions suck to make, and they should add additional spawns not in the wilderness, and instead in this dungeon.
---
Great, can you explain what additional information you're basing that belief on? Clearly you know something more than the rest of us, since you're so adamant he was "obviously poking his computer around into sketchy places". 
---
My "assumption" was based on you holding the position that he was at fault, without any evidence that was the case. Which logically means that you're choosing to consider him at fault, until you have evidence that he isn't. 
---
My response was simply pointing out that the majority of infections / hacking / identity theft occur without the victim doing anything wrong, and that you should require evidence that someone is at fault (not that they aren't).
---
bro clap backs and yo mama jokes with these inky dinky graphics and yellow text is forever comedy gold

I think some people don't see it that way. They just want lots of gp to show off / access high level content without putting the work in. I think it's the same for folks that buy bonds for all their gp.

I get what your saying, and I thank you for the informative response. For me, osrs combat is devilishly simple but still insanely hard and that‚Äôs why I love it. The skill cap is high but in essence it‚Äôs very simple to understand. It‚Äôs not just the combat of RS3 that made me stop playing I seriously like the old graphics a 10000x times more. I‚Äôve watched a few rs3 streams and man there screens are 10x larger, there‚Äôs 14 different things happening at once, they‚Äôre spamming there abilities, and so on. Runescape is a classic game and I, like many, enjoy playing what I use to play back in the day but with new additions to keep it fresh. Rs3 just seems like WoW now

---
I'm not going to deny that mechanics such as instances are partially there for Iron Men (But lets be honest, mains love the lack of competition just as much).
---
Why does chest loot as opposed to something being dropped on the ground make a difference for you? Unless you're not planning on splitting the loot, then it works out the same. 
---
Chest loot solves the issue of group content on Iron Man. It doesn't compromise the game mode IMO, because the amount of solo effort required to get items in the current content that has chest loot is still very high and obviously your drops are dependent on how much effort you put in on that Raid, so you can't exactly be carried and still have the same chance of loot.
---
And if a normie and ironman damage an NPC, and the ironman does the most damage, no one gets the drop.

Go out and buy a charged Trident of the seas for your magic if you‚Äôve got the 75 magic lvl. That‚Äôs about 1 mil, a little more, and can last a bunch of runs at Barrows so you can usually make the money back for the Trident or loot enough runes to refill it during the runs!

---
Native Americans
---
&gt;I feel like that would be the obvious opinion of anyone who plays osrs, because why else would they play osrs.
---
You definitely can't say that, because if that were the case, OSRS' community would be completely fine with us taking *everything else* from RS3 except EOC, which they certainly wouldn't.
---
For example, I don't play OSRS because I think EOC is shit. I play OSRS because I think that RS3 has sold its soul to MTX and I don't like being panhandled by the company I already pay money to play their game and the fact that the existence of the MTX inherently devalues any XP related achievement I accomplish, as I'm competitive by nature and don't like the idea that I could grind 20 hours for something someone dropped 100 dollars for and got in a few minutes.
---
Like I said before, you don't have to like EOC, you can play whatever version of the game you'd like, but I simply think that most people don't have very educated opinions on the matter to even *know* that they don't actually prefer EOC, so they instead blindly hate on it.
---
&gt;It doesn't matter how intuitive or useful it is if people just don't want it.
---
This is absolutely true, I don't take issue with the people that don't want it, I take issue with the people who incessantly talk shit about it without ever bothering to try it for themselves.

Does anyone know where I can find a ridiculously high resolution map of OSRS without the icons on it? I intend to run a D&amp;D campaign using Runescape as the setting and would appreciate being able to zoom in and add a grid to create battle/city maps rather than having to draw them all out myself.
---
Yes, it is. It harms the overall economy of the game and makes the value or uniques drop. Its a MMO, not a solo experiance. Ill give you further examples though. Sandstone being able to get chiseled into buckets of sand.  Adding additional store inventory, and purchase ammounts( buy1000, buy 50 etc), peek options at many bosses.  Boss damage being reset after someone teles or leaves a room at gwd or other places, and many other specific updates benifiting only(or mostly) ironmen.  
---
They get catered to quite frequently and imo, it defeats the purpose of limiting your account. The oroginal intent of ironman mode was that it would be side content and would never receive updates or attention, as stated by the blog and mods and poll. Yet they get just as much if not more QOL than the main game, where time could be better spent elsewhere

By Release is a good one too. By J1mmy.
---
&gt; but I do know they only have one dedicated J-Mod to anti-botting when a game as bad as runescape in regards to botting would have at least .a small team if they *actually cared* about stopping it
---
Jagex hires a small team and it costs them a lot and you still have the same exact same problem and are in the same exact place as now. No matter how many people Jagex hire for bot issues, there are going to be tens of thousands of more people a step ahead of them.

There is only so much that Jagex can do when the game itself is already designed around bot like activity.

You do realize Guthix was initially depicted as a floating skull with tendrils/snakes right? If I remember they showed it during the early god letters and the door to his temple in WGS shows it.

A core is a compute unit. In the past, CPU's were sped up by increasing the clock rate i.e. allowing it to do more things in a given amount of time. But due to physical constraints, manufacturers can't increase the clock rate reliably anymore. To keep getting increased performance, manufacturers moved to multi-core designs, so instead of 1 CPU doing things faster you speed up the computer by having multiple cores doing things simultaneously. So programs get the best performance and reduce the load on your computer by spreading their work over the multiple cores, but RuneScape is single threaded so it will hog a single core. 
---
Side note a GPU is basically just a CPU specialized for graphics. RuneScape by default uses the CPU to render which slows it down a lot.

When i was writing bots in college id use color ranges (the game varies the colors but not by much, easy to identify a specific sink or bankchest on a screen) to identify objects in game undetectably. Get their coordinates on the screen and randomly click within 25 pixels at slightly random intervals. I ran hundreds of bots for months without detection before my c.s. research/class projects started taking too much of my time to keep it going.
---
Theres just not much they can do to catch a well written bot. I mostly did profitable tasks that didnt reward xp and made billions.

that was fucking stupid. also the req are way too low, should req 7 or 10, 75 stats

I mean, I‚Äôm just playing devils advocate.

I'll probably try out barrows again, the first thing I bought when I got 75 magic was the full trident. That's why I grinded to 75 before I wanted to do something else.
---
Mine.  Some accounts can't use it. Why are you people so fucking anti-anything that isnt BiS or for you.  Theres literally no negatives to uniques for lower levels other than you want to fuck other peoples fun.

Don‚Äôt forget you can visit disord.gg/wdr which also offers many resources and cccapable mentors :)

For sure, I don't think I've ever met any Ironmen who behave like this though. In fact, I think I remember several UIMs advising Jagex to lock them out of seed vault because it'd be too powerful for the gamemode.
---
That's technically AHK btw, and a banable offense... Silly I know.
---
!remindme 2 days

Fuck you bitch
---
I literally put quotation marks around the word reality don't preach to me about it being a game I'm not stupid. The GAME'S reality. As in, the rules of the world inside the game. 
---
A profit snake in swamp tar fits perfectly into the reality of this game. Magic and combat and crafting and thieving all make sense in this reality. A massive city at the edge of the most dangerous area of the game opening a huge hole in the wall directly between their financial center and the very edge of that dangerous place does not make sense.
---
Ooh this is actually really cool, thanks for the heads up man. That's an easy extra 3-4m cash every 2 weeks. Nice

They‚Äôre objectively not worthless. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt scam, but if I was homeless and couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for food for my kids, then fuck yea I‚Äôm gonna scam some ‚Äúworthless item‚Äù so my kids can eat.
---
I‚Äôm being hyperbolic of course since I doubt anyone‚Äôs in that situation but the point remains that the pixels aren‚Äôt worthless.
---
I'm honestly more concerned about wilderness slayer. perhaps wilderness keys is their solution to that side of things. 
---
It sucks for BH players too but really, PKing isn't about the money!
---
I‚Äôll be there, sweetie
---
What does any of that have to do with me?
---
Is it because you need to make an ape atol tab? Couldn't find a restriction that would make it impossible.
---
Bro get 94 mage!

This is very motivational. Imma go make my first Ironman
---
Jagex arbitrarily made the defence requirement to begin with. If this is to be the finale to the elf quest line and all the other quests are available to pures(?) then why the fuck should this one require defence? Bitching about this is really nonsense. They don't always think things through on the first iteration and are always asking for community feedback.
---
No, actually there was a client that did the updated graphics and Jagex sent an immediate cease and desist :(
---
I've never been crashed in 100 KC. Everyone knows that ironmen only stay for a couple of kills so it's like finding a free world. Unless they're using mage, then it's open season.
---
which was the argument many people said.  But mod ash specifically said this dungeon was to move it away from the tower of life.  
---
Which is an iroman update. most other players get the eggs from vennenatis.
---
Why do wines of zammy need to be made easily accessable just because Ironmen don't want to gather them like theyve been gathered for 10 years? If you make them easily farmable they'll lose their value.
---
I'll do you one better. I'll explain why you have made yourself look like a fool.
---
1. You disregarded someone else's opinion / point because they have said that they have "come to the realisation after 4 years". Now it may well be true that you have played longer than they have, however to disregard their point on the basis that you have played longer and therefore you must be right is in fact an argument from authority, also known as the appeal to authority fallacy; Just because you are more experienced does not mean that you automatically are right and that someone else's point is invalid.
---
2. You present your opinion as holding more merit / weight than the other player's with the following:  
---
a. " I play the game as a PKer, skiller, and PVMer all alike. Although i cannot guarantee it, i am damn sure you're a noob all around compared to me" (I corrected your misspelling of the word you're)  
---
b."I have more PVP accounts than you do bro"  
---
Just because you might have more PVP accounts and you do certain activities, it does not mean that the other player is automatically a "Noob" to everyone. We can both agree that what we deem the term "Noob" to refer to is relative; you even said it yourself when you said "we can literally measure success in OSRS with GP, stats and certain untradeables". Those are quite clearly your own personal parameters which you consider when determining if someone is a "Noob". However, other players may have their own parameters too; such as a player who is new to the game.   
---
In order for your point to be valid you would need to know the other player's GP, stats and what untradeables they have; unfortunately you present no evidence that you have this information at hand and therefore your argument becomes somewhat of a moot point and can be disregarded based on a lack of evidence.
---
3. There is only one person that has mentioned speaking with authority and i'm afraid it's you "Don't speak with authority if you don't have it" (Again I've corrected your spelling of the word don't... both times). Why have you assumed that the player doesn't have authority on the subject? Where is your evidence to support this? Again your argument falls down because of a lack of evidence and more assumptions on your part.
---
Now I will make my own assumption here; I assume that you've read my poorly worded, potty mouthed comment and you've decided that you would take position upon your high horse on the basis that I must likely not be very intelligent based on how I worded my previous response. In other words you thought taking the high and mighty route would give you an easy means to victory. However I regret to remind you that you should never judge a book by it's cover and that "throwing stones in glass houses" probably isn't a wise idea.  
---
Please don't take it personally, I hope you see the funny side. 
---
Happy Scaping!
---
OP is a cunt.
---
what
---
Commonly stated but it's false. It was like a throwaway joke 4 years ago, he has since said he's not doing it again on an alt. He said he had a lot of other games to catch up to and was taking a break.
---
Which is why I suggested killing the monsters? ü§î
---
I know you‚Äôre probably just commenting shit like this to make yourself feel better by making someone else feel bad, but 2k on an Ironman is hard, anyone who says otherwise is wrong. It‚Äôs as simple as that. I hope you find a cure for your insecurity eventually...although the internet isn‚Äôt the best place for that.
---
Theyre pretty fun, ironman skillers are already fun on their own but hardcore makes it tougher and harder to unlock a couple things
---
You'd be surprised what a little convenience does. I'd bet a small PK scene will spring up from it.
---
I just don't understand why still. You have the cape to give more points but an actual pot would give more points than what the capes offering.
---
It does. Just annoying to actually log out and back in instead of waiting 20 seconds.
---
You had me with your post, you lost me with your comments
---
You could make a lot more in a week from duradel slayer
---
Jealous! I just ht 1.5k and 2k feels years away...
---
Did you read the tweet? It makes perfect sense.
---
Looks like shit, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a toggle they need to devote major resources to implement it when they could be making good content instead
---
Nope, a lot of the textures in RS3 are different to what the 2010 era had, and work differently model wise as well.
---
This is just beautiful man. Congrats.

Idk, that‚Äôs why I asked. I don‚Äôt really get the pushback for just asking
---
best elite clues/hour
---
You.. log on daily to do dailies that benefit someone playing the game while saying that's a healthy way to not play the game?
---
Why not just take a break? If the game is truly that addicting or you don't want to play it, you don't have to. Cancel your sub and move on, it'll be there for a day when you want to come back. I don't get why people think they have to stake their bank away or "just logon once a day" to feed it. Go invest energy elsewhere and you'll forget about it. Or don't, it's a game and if you enjoy it, you should enjoy it. Just not for like.. 18 hours a day ahaha
---
Welcome to hell, brother :D
---
not really
---
it‚Äôs the best elite clues per hour
---
Congrats! I just hit 1k for the first time today!
---
I have no idea in general what it is
---
Workin on to right now
---
killing low level pvp one update at a time
---
Lol you must be poor as fuck
---
Whats the show?
---
Nah lol 
---
That response confirms you have really been trying the whole time, damn that‚Äôs sad.
---
I do have one started actually, havent used it in ages, think i got to like 75 fm at wintertodt and my membership ran out, and havent been navk since haha
---
500 total is extremely shitty for people who just want to make quick pures (and remake them once they exit their combat bracket.)
---
This sub cannot stomach the idea that forcing everyone to play every part of the game just because you enjoy it is not good game design.  I have no interest in skilling -- I have a tentative interest in Pking.  With a 500 total requirement, it's just not worth bothering.  
---
And I'd never be able to convince my friends to get into it with me.  Friends who get excited seeing PvP combat until you tell them it'll take a work week's worth of staring at trees/spam clicking logs etc. just to access the content.
---
But any time this is brought up, the community floods with downvotes and laughs, spitefully, at how they're harming the pking community.  It's just a bunch of mains throwing alternative playstyle players to the wolves in exchange for feeling slightly more secure from bots.
---
300 is tolerable.  You get close with a standard pure setup.  500 would be high enough to kill any growth because pking is already hard enough to get into.  Adding an arbitrary grind requirement as well just ensures no one new bothers with it
---
I'm down with this. Someone screenshot this and send it to mod ash. I dont have a twitter lol
---
I'm kinda close but not at the same time, can I join the discord tho so when Im ready I can learn
---
Theres no way swampletics got someone who doesnt play the game into the game.
---
Thing is that most people doing FFA CoX and ToB are shit so you're better off just splitting

---
We all agree that pvp burns more money per time played but since there are so many more pvmers the amount of resources being burned by all of pvm is way higher than the resources burned by all of pvp. Not taking sides just clarifying his statement
---
Just do FFA

Gimme dat template

????? Not everyone has a reddit account lol

Oh in that case we should add 10 bh kills before you can access god wars dungeon, yeah?

Tbh i quit right around the time this was implemented and am not a fan of it.

Yeah I don‚Äôt think he realizes how badly a noob can be lured, especially if they are young and this is their first MMORPG. Heck, I look back at my teenage self and think about how I got lured and scammed in the ways the ways that I did. My first death was literally at barb village when I had just started playing was low level, a person told me to attack a barbarian and that he would help me kill it, there I am, 12 year old in my first mmo, having teamed up with a person for the first time ever, or so I thought. As I was getting hacked by 0s and 1s and 3s and slowIy killing myself, I realized the situation but I was so taken by adrenaline that I literally forgot that I can just click and walk away from the fight. I was instead typing ‚ÄúPlease help!‚Äù Over and over. As I died, he typed ‚Äúnoob‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt even know the meaning of it at the time. That‚Äôs how gullible and hotheaded a 12 year old kid who is new to  mmos can be. 
---
Nowadays, some of the lures and scams are so elaborate that a vet might never ever see it coming. Or try to 200iq the scammer and still get outsmarted. That‚Äôs why if I‚Äôm sitting at GE and I hear ‚Äúhey you wanna earn -‚Äú 
---
‚ÄúFuck off.‚Äù

Ironman is mad ^

What is the fastest farming XP on a budget at lower levels? I don't know much about the skill, only level 17 from a quest. I was thinking fruit trees, but I'm not sure how the payment to the gardeners work, and if this would be too expensive to maintain even with cheap seeds. Thanks for your time
---
There is no 1:1 rule. 
---
Quote by Mod mat K:
---
&gt;The answer to AHK is that if you use it you run the risk of being banned. Although in the past you have heard people quote an 1:1 rule, this is not nor has ever been true. It is a myth that many people (including Jmods) believed and as such was propagated as fact. It is not a fact.
---
&gt;The only answer we will give is that if you use it you run the risk of being banned.
---
&gt;Our approach to AHK has not changed so if you have been using it for a long time and have not been banned you are probably safe to assume what you are doing is okay. The reason we won't be more specific is those that want to cheat will push any guidelines we set out to the max and when they get banned they will complain that they thought what they were doing were in the guidelines."
---
They don‚Äôt understand, I wouldn‚Äôt worry.
---
The only people that this total level inconveniences is legitimate players that want to  pvp. Emblem farmers are just going to bot the levels like they bot everything else.
---
This whole subreddit would have an aneurysm if they added 10 bh kills before you could start doing slayer.
---
this is amazing
---
That's really not true at all. You can suicide bot for says straight and not get banned. If you bother to use/write a private script ban rates are hilariously low, especially if the account has an older creation date. Getting banned from botting is mostly pure RNG or someone reporting you. Jagex likes to say things like this to underplay the problem, but it's really not all that true.
---
whats whack is that the chinese people i meet (as part of a thing i do), most of them dont know about it
---
If you watched the 'botting to max' series a while ago, I saw someone doing AHK to max. Only watched a few minutes of the first episode, but it's different. Otherwise I am a big fan of the bot hunting videos and the playing runescape properly series.
---
It‚Äôs weird that someone who knows about OSRS, and is close enough to know that they are posted on the subreddit, somehow doesn‚Äôt have a Reddit account. Especially since they have a Twitter account too. People try to fake being other people for karma/clout all the time, so most of the time when someone says ‚Äúhey this is me‚Äù with a freshly made Reddit account, chances are it‚Äôs not actually them.
---
Correction:  ‚ÄúHow to revive mass luring from g.e‚Äù
---
&gt;-New music soundtracks only obtainable through playing DMM (some entry level, such as making an account, getting your first kill, and some high level, such as your first GWD/Raid on DMM, and your first kill against a player for a loot/bank value of over 10M). 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;‚Äã
---
&gt;-Cosmetics only obtainable through bloodmoney (and add limitations to how often you can kill the same player for bloodmoney to prevent abuse.) 
---
&gt;-Add the ability to transfer XP to OSRS (at a 1:20 ratio)
---
&gt;-Add Vesta, Statius, Morrigan, and Zuriel weaponry to OSRS - but only obtainable through DMM. Make the DMM drop rate 1/20th of what it was in the seasonals.
---
Just.. No.
---
i cant even remember what my original point was lol  :)  
---
but i want a gate to the wilderness at G.E thats all i know 
---
hahahhahaa
---
My computer would catch fire if I even tried to load 2 rs clients
---
In a way I agree with you, but I cant remember if this also came with those ridiculous Disney-esque chatheads and goofy running animations. Those need to be banished from the game for eternity and beyond
---
Set your block list to exclude all highest weighted non-hydra tasks
---
Sounds like forced content for osrs players that don‚Äôt want to play DMM but would because of music cape/easier money making/stats. 
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be lasting playerbase tbh.
---
i'm pretty sure that doesnt change the value of the rewards
---
It doesnt make sense lore wise.  A big marketplace should be walled off from a lawless warzone.
---
The death of the game when it was removed is a fairly good indicator, in all fairness it was also coupled with the removal of free trade which was huge but it's pretty disingenuous to pretend that pvp wasn't an absolutely massive part of the game back then, hell it was basically end game for a lot of high level players unless you enjoy running kq over and over. But aside from that pvp orientated players burn through food/runes/brews/restores faster than anyone, not to mention pvp players bring in a huge chunk of revenue for Jagex with all of their alt builds.
---
Chaotic good
---
I lol'ed

What? Someone probably told her "yo your tinder is on reddit lol" so she made an account just to comment. Happens all the time. Having a twitter account and a reddit account isn't related at all.

This is the best post on all of reddit

There's one charging outlet in the entire gate area?
---
As someone who play in this era and not in 07, I say hell yeah.

From my perspective people are upset about a lack of new bosses like gwd that just exist on the map.

Maybe a new boss area appears in the desert akin to gwd :(
