Well I went ahead and completed the quest by finding a different combination of shapes. I'm also not sure what a screenshot could provide in terms of information.

Just look what supplies you use and subtract that from your loot tracker

I remember this how I lost my robin set back in 2006 . Some dudes invited me to their house and we were boxing in the ring and then I got left at 2 hp and he asked me to cook karambwan outside in the rimmy cooking range so I can heal back up and my dumb ass did and I ate it and died . I was so sad . Smh lol
---
You'll regret that comment in a few days..
---
Drakes are a super shit task, but it’s tolerable if you have a lance
---
I said not saying that. Just plainly begging for money.
---
You're not wrong haha
---
Nigga you gay
---
Even if you not a troll, how do you not realize this is the stupidest shit ever. You’re setting up idiots to get scammed after having their 10-50k doubled.
---
Ive said before that bot and RWT detection is so lax that I'm sure some Jagex employees are getting kickbacks
---
Probably engine work.
---
No
---
Spoilers
---
I still think it's a fucked up seedy thing to do. A person wearing max cash begging is like.. implying you'll get rewarded for being generous. 
---

---
It seems seedy/scammy to me.
---
Reading is hard, sorry lol.
---
If you're literally just asking for money, then you aren't breaking any rules.

As we can see, skillers are truly the most toxic players

I love them, incredible work! You wouldn't happen to go by TzKet-Death too? If so, you made some awesome models for a particular TF2 server I like.

Oops.

You can't delete accounts (banned accounts keep their names too)

Little explanation:
---
This simple addition would allow more streamline play for people who only got acces to a mouse OR keyboard at the same time.
---
The Up/Down Arrow price regulator buttons tend to be ineffective in following cases:
---
\- Mainly: Quikly buying a cheap item e.g. '20 bread' for a quest 
---
\- Heavy price increments towards highly valued items
---
\- Very small price increments for cheap items
---
Warding is a terrible skill, we don't want a terrible idea making it's way to the game ... Warding, as it looks, would do better if it was polled as a minigame instead of a skill ...

You can afk for 4 minutes and 50 seconds (unless you wanna waste absorbs).
---
I'm maxed and have a maxed pure. The main was done at NMZ ages ago and the pures melee was done at chaos druids. The druids were much more afk even at 52 prayer and I was pk'd once. The range at NMZ (while less XP/h) is very afk so i'd still do that there but for melee I honestly suggest chaos druids especially on a main.

Looks like a RuneScape version of Meg from family guy

I’m definitely an Edgy Atheist, but how dare you call me a teenager. I was playing this game when you were still in the womb.

Yeah funner, don't act like you don't know what the meaning is you god damn dolt.
---
You see a red line under the word when you type it? Didn't think so.  Its an actual word you just aren't with the times.
---
Don't mind me i'm just trying to stir the shit pot.
---
But your blue dragon tasks would be worth more if bots didn't keep the prices down
---
Imagine thinking a peepee could post a reddit comment...
---
Lmfao I saw that dude yesterday
---
I don't get it.
---
Doesn’t work. I had an account that I linked an email to. Next day I tried logging into pc with that email and it had me start over. New name and everything. GC acc is still active and the same lvls.
---
no, no, you put the shit *on* the plants.
---
I mean he's not going about it the wrong way, showing people in the clan are enjoying themselves ain't wrong?
---
The main thing is you can't have armor or weapons on Entrana so if those items are rolled they will be rerolled. This mainly equates to higher god page chances. This is usually used for ironmen because there aren't many useful items other than god pages that easy clues give.
---
Yeah, for every guy that gets genuine happiness and reward out of grinding RuneScape for ungodly hours, there's 10 unhappy depressed dudes that claim it's a healthy habit that makes them happy.
---
If it changed due to inactivity then they give you a free name change upon login. What happened to you is either you got hacked and they changed the name or you've had too many offensive names in the past and Jagex changed your name for you because you're incapable of choosing an appropriate name (if this is the case you cannot change it even if you're a member).
---
You cannot change your name without becoming a member
---
True, but everything would be drastically expensive. Runes, food, potions, ect.
---
unless you are low defense you won't waste absorbs.
---
my 1 defense pure is the only one i have to watch consistently otherwise i'll take hundreds of damage in seconds.
---
and you can't afk in the wild unless you want to die, it's just that simple.
---
maybe you were able to get away with it, but to suggest to other people that they won't be attacked there is a bit ridiculous.
---
He is ranked in top 25 most xp for smithing and he probably botted the whole thing, currently the bot is broken.
---
Does efficient soloing include having an alt?
---
It's a high level guy getting caught using a bot lol
---
I think its looking at the craws bow on the arma dude, and the d scim on the voider
---
Imagine thinking they're triggered lol
---
galactic brain
---
Didnt some else do this like last week?
---
Take a look at their profile, it'll give you a hint as to what kind of person they are
---
I was told no gratz till 99 so shut up
---
I had thought what OP meant by "top page" was that the bot was top 25 in the skill but he's actually rank 123 which is like 5th page. It's broken meaning it isn't doing what it was programmed to do, smithing, and is likely wandering around seemingly randomly.
---
No matter how many times I see this meme its gonna he funny.
---
broken meaning the bot isnt working correctly and is probably running around doing nothing picking up certain items, and top page refers to the highscores
---
I dunno he typed at least 3 sentences about nothing...
---
Stupid high accuracy and stupid high attack speed. Downright shittiest task I've had so far. And because I had just started slayer, I couldn't skip it either. I would rather fight 500 ghouls than 100 killawatts.

Yeah I feel bad for the guy but if it happened to me I'd be more embarrassed with myself and impressed with Vincent's lack of remaining scruples.
---
If you can’t stop yourself from gambling then maybe you should get help. I don’t see any harm in staking as long as you’re not chucking your paychecks for gold to continue staking. 1-800-ADM-ITIT :)
---
Never suggested that they wouldn't be attacked. I suggest that they do the method and see for themselves.
---
Ahrim and Karil are sick.
---
Its a sketchy fork of runelite that went ahead and implemented stuff that Jagex has already asked to be removed from runelite
---
OP isn't talking about normal RL
---
2000+ scales
---
3000+ darts (I used addy)
---
2/3 bastion pots
---
12 sara brews
---
Remaining inventory super restores
---
Don’t waste spots on crossbow and darts, take a blessing for +1 prayer bonus
---
You won’t use it all but there’s no harm in being stocked.
---
Follow the official osrs wiki guide. Tick waves off when you’re on them (when you’re on a wave tick it off)
---
Remember the 29314 killing order.
---
Jad spawns where the orange lizard spawns on wave 62
---
Sound off, when jad dangles you pray mage, when he flails you pray ranged.
---
When the healers spawn for jad, dps them one at a time  keeping track of your prayer. Obviously stay out of melee distance for jad or else he will slap you hard.
---
justiciar+spectral on the alt?
---
This is the funniest and saddest exchange I've ever seen.
---
I suppose I'll do it one day. Very easy skill to ignore though, just because of how separate it is from the rest of the game.
---
I figured, but I was going on the assumption that the "Plus" was just a plugin some had made and he called it that.
---
That sounds to be pretty reasonable at your level, AFKing sand crabs with MSB(i) or something could be cheaper and comparable.
---
It's either fast EXP or cheap EXP, rarely you'll find both!
---
U should go back to school... thats correct.
---
Unironic question: what are some of your favorite fashionscape with these helms? Any of them that look good with a dps set in your opinion?
---
At that level, I assume a player with non-bis gear does it because they want to, fashionscape or whatever
---
Shut up etsy gave me real skill capes
---
it's fine, 75 magic and range are recommended stats to kill it and that's completely fine with hard diaries. Elite diaries have reqs like 93 slayer
---
Support
---
It should say, "Good lord what will have happened in there?"
---
What are you on about?
---
Thank you
---
As much as I hate to say this - isn't it best not to just report something on just the notice of some post?
---
I mean, I'm sure they'll investigate and find out if this person is indeed a bot (and they likely are, it is a big problem) but we can't know for sure without any evidence. OP didn't post any videos, no screenshots, nada.
---
It's been posted on this sub several times. There were a few threads from different people posting their findings.
---
Suck my penile erectus
---
I can’t seem to find molly
---
Congratulations big achievement
---
That's a yikes from me chief.
---
Does paying farmers to watch my crops stop them from ever becoming diseased?
---
&gt; NMZ creatures are identical to their original quest form
---
Mostly but Vampire doesn't need a stake and hammer and Black Knight Titan doesn't require Excalibur.
---
I run Diamond_Ring.exe and have had good luck so far, even added a couple more bots. It takes *alot* of work to setup and run properly, it crashes for over 50% of users.
---
Honestly sounds like a great high level addition to normal spellbook, 75-85ish magic requirement with big rune cost (like 2 nats 2 laws + 8 airs-ish) would be lit
---
Problem is that it wasn't sea shanty 2, it was a disaster.
---
I also believe you, but on my screen the comments are alternating believing and disbelieving, so I feel obligated to say I don't believe you
---
can't blame them when 99.99999% of people saying doubling money are scamming.
---
Tell molly to stuff it.
---
oh maybe not. doctor strange is what im thinking of
---
You submit a bug report?
---
So much 🆙
---
I think you mean arduino, smh.
---
And get bombed with FAQ links and obnoxious smiley faces.
---
It is less than that. It has been granted a total of 0 times and will never be granted and shouldn't ever be granted
---
Runelite
---
You won’t feel much of him after you mess with molly.
---
&gt; You still didn't tell me how you can prove it's a bot. You just keep repeating that you proved it, without providing info on how.
---
You are literally posting on a thread about a guy who finds and records bots at work. Lol.
---
&gt; I never said anything about there being a big enough bot problem, and I never said anything about jagex doing enough.
---
Then they wouldn't need to pay someone 8 hours to find if someone is a bot?
---
&gt;I'm saying that you can't know how much they are doing or not doing, and you cannot come to the conclusion that they refuse to do anything.
---
But there are obvious bots that are easily identified without even having any special knowledge exist. Again, someone with 20m experience who only does one thing and never reacts to anything is obviously a bot, and jagex could detect and ban that with ease. They don't, so suggesting that they do anything more than that is just stupid.
---
 
---
&gt; Based on you not providing me with info on how you as a player can prove without a doubt that an account is a bot account, despite me asking for it several times, you should practise reading comprehension more.
---
Again. You are sitting in a thread about someone who makes videos about finding bots. Just go and watch his channel for ten seconds.
---
Don't go into multi.
---
Nice.
---
I should do something like this while vidding and see what happens
---
Unfortunately no ancients. I was planning on going for ancients before doing jad for this reason but I’m impatient and want to just go for it. Thank you for the advise!
---
[These things, they take time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6yBHDvKUw)

Redundant? What? Smoke devils are one of the best mage/slayer xp per hour tasks in the game, dont need to buff it any more than it already is :/
---
The comments were made after mine
---
... For steamed hams
---
Gz beast, what's next?
---
nonsense, the wild after it was 'removed' and re added might as well have been a completely different thing.
---
all of that shit was added to try and placate the userbase who was pissed off at jagex for removing the actual wild in the first place, and the majority of pkers quit the game entirely so the people who enjoyed the stuff that came after might as well be completely different types of players.
---
I’m glad to hear that I’m good on scales. I don’t want to spend more than I need to considering I’m taking a break from range after this. Good inventory setup. So I shouldn’t worry about the range on the blowpipe?
---
Hope that ring and mask are imbued.
---
Maybe the cow is measured longways
---
If you get your range and mage to about 80, you can easily do Zulrah. That's how I make $$ on my pure.
---
It's actually still possible. Just managed to do so ;)
---
"Let's not turn this robbery into a murder."
---
Played for years but definitely still a noob here, and I 100% will not be doing wildy mess unless I have to. I do all my bones either with my butler at my altar, or on house party.
---
Guaranteed to drive up the AFK'ing and opposite-team alt-loading.
---
When they made them, did they deliberately make all the uniques that aren't zenyte trash money?
---
Every 5 minutes or so the game makes some checks and sees if you're eligible for a random. Just making sure you're not in an area that can't get randoms when the in-game timer reaches a multiple of 5 minutes should be about all you can do.
---
I've never actually bought anything from a content creator before, but I enjoy /u/SettledRS content so much I wanted to support him. Thank you Settled.
---
I know it doesn’t quite compare, but if it makes you feel any better, a guy in my cc just fished 9k sharks (going for big shark) without wearing his rada’s Blessing
---
Get a blessing for like 10k if you haven't already, free prayer bonus instead of an unused arrow slot
---
Repost till seen then do a long term continued edit, you could start something. Just needs a little more
---
Summoning also  necessarily affected combat. This changed pvp and duel arena and was a bit of a headache. Plus people  would yak scroll an item to the bank in the wild
---
Not wielding the secateurs. 
---
Your bots broken.

Rookie numbers ;)

I know this isn't entirely serious, but people who unironically have nothing to flex flex about other than barrows gloves are the brainlets of pvm
---
I use barrows gloves during ranged phase, along with armadyl helmet, which you could possibly include in your switches. Grind out the assembler asap!
---
Imp boxes already existed.
---
thanks man, getting there now considering this was from scratch for a series and started not too long ago
---
21 hours = nearly a full work week? I don’t think 3 a day is casual but you can’t compare a part timers week to a “full work week”
---
&gt;Do you hide during phases or nah?
---
i believe so but im not sure of the details of a mage only kill as i have never attempted that method personally.
---
True but yak scrolls were stackable and you'd see so many items disappear
---
GRR &gt;:( Don't post thing on reddit unless MEM FUNNY!
---
Runescape has some of the best dialogue of any game.
---
Gz you need real friends

That’s him potting up while messaging you that he’s going to help right before he Ice blitz g mauls ur ass.
---
What legs are those? Also, did you used a guide to learn Barbarian Assault? I want to get my torso but game seems a little bit too complicated to learn.
---
That's awesome man if u need some in game friends hit me up I'm on that nastolgia train too
---
The best part is you can report them anyway and they still get muted since "doubling" is against the rules.
---
I feel no guilt for players who think it's cute to actually do it for fun. Not only does it make players more likely to fall for a scam later, but it also contributes to begging since newbies will rely on other players instead of themselves to get GP.
---
Boots teleport is closer by like 5 - 10 sec
---
At the end of 2018
---
You're completely right.
---
He was making a joke. A bad one....but a joke, nonetheless
---
Yes, and you call them steamed hams, despite the fact that they are obviously grilled.
---
The 5'4" Manlet vs 5'10" Chad Moo
---
Damn I always thought the icon was of a brain, not a hand
---
Give your mom a break bro, come sing to me.
---
well yeah, sure, it's... it's not easy haha. Getting to jad is one thing and not panicking is another, but eh.. who cares, I would't put it on Elite either but eh
---
That'll be a lottt of monkfish or motherload mine, honestly, do motherload mine until you can get a coal bag and do blast furnace if you refuse to spend money on the game, you'll get a bond in a fraction of the time it would take fishing or mining! If you get your prayer up once you're a member too, you can also collect Mort myre fungus, which is just as quick, but requires less attention, but the trade of is that you don't get any XP from it
---
This makes me think, I haven’t played in a while but it’s probably so much easier to wildly boss and black chin hunt now that there’s so many worlds
---
Why?
---
Shut up and take my money
---
10/10 vouch for this.
---
I was here today and i could not figure out why so many people were following this one guy around in circles. hope he actually gets banned for once
---
None of us have done tune mysteries either
---
Oh ur running a 3rd party client to see how much time is left on each vein?? Easy 200
---
Fucking normies
---
But did you eat his smite???
---
Use duradel for slayer. Only use konar for milestone tasks as she gives more points. But generally konar is shit slayer xp
---
to be fair, that dude correct he dont need no fucking guide he already knows how to handle his sword apparently for an armored opponent
---
still under the drop rate so its lucky but well deserved
---
It’s all pretty awful though
---
Thank the good lord for people like you friend, I was about to throw my phone through the window
---
"increase your pew pew power with a bow by 10%"
---
"increase your wizardry with a stick by 10%"
---
Yeah you’re right over time it averages out and it’s still overall fun but for every super fast kill you get there’s gonna be one where you splash constantly. And it’s the ones where I splash that make me rage like a little baby
---
I'm as excited as you are, friend! I can't wait to see clan integration in Old School.
---
Upgrading to the armadyl helmet and the barrows gloves will give you an extra +12 ranged bonus EACH, while upgrading to the assembler will give you a +4 ranged bonus. I would go with the armadyl helmet first (since ancestral hat gives negative ranged bonus, for the prayer bonus, and also to complete the armadyl set), barrows gloves, and then assembler. I've been experimenting with different gear, and have been trying out elite void which gives me a consistent 1:30 kill average, but without void my ranged switch is: armadyl helmet, karils top, karils bottom, anguish, barrows gloves, assembler, and blow pipe.
---
go play rs3 noob
---
SHE WAS A COP WEE BAY
---
Can someone point out the evidence from this clip that a bot is broken?   
---
I honestly just see someone standing still.   
---
Not saying it's not a broken bot, but how does this clip itself provide evidence to a broken bot?
---
are you going to add their weapons? that would really put this over the edge but very well done nevertheless
---
I'll be in my bunk
---
Yeah but that shit happens with every boss in the game, can’t really just blame zulrah for shitty luck once in awhile
---
This changes everything...
---
It takes 2 seconds to ban them. Also takes 2 seconds to create a bh emblem farm. See the problem now? 
---
It’s a constant circle of life where a farm gets banned and then gets replaced immediately and then banned and then replaced immediately. Barrier of entry is very low which makes bh farms so popular.
---
Just doing the raid on better efficiency cuts down brew usage and gear plays some role to this as well.
---
for example, ice demon room, you could've bring fire surge and safespot on the wall. Mutt room, bring freeze zgs/ancients to prevent it from eating and killing it faster. And yes, points determines your % on loot rolls, check wiki for formulae. 
---
For olm room, make sure everyone knows their roles. Head running properly, dodging special attacks, switching prayers on autoattacks or special orbs etc. Realize what you are taking damage from and avoid that next raid.
---
well considering vein times are static its nothing huge really.
---
Guthix isn't an elder god.
---
Keep Oldschool Oldschool. No to summoning.
---
Bh bot farms are banned every day. However, the owners can create a brand new set of accounts that very same day and continue to farm emblems.
---
I dont like your color matching
---
Yeah u right it’s just the nature of a game like OSRS
---
Remind me of the old days
---
If she hasn't figured out 'words' yet, then I think he is stuck with her forever.
---
Nothing that changes as many metas as summoning did will ever pass a poll.
---
damn. could have cornered the market on kp d spears or hasta ;P
---
How much time did the torso took?
---
Actually this doesn't work, they require the e-mail address as well.
---
A mini game? Wtf?
---
Gz
---
I have elite void, but I'm not sure my ranged is high enough to use it to it's full potential (at 90 currently). I'll definitely try slotting in the helmet though. I'm not sure if you saw, but the guy above was talking about the Sang staff. Do you have any experience in that/recommend it?
---
Yeah I know, would more p mods help? I mean all of this can ONLY happen on one world so...
---
P mods can only mute people, so that wouldn't really help.
---
Fuck
---
True.
---
Another common build is 60 attack 70 def, but that’s not really possible where you’re at now I assume
---
Somebody should create a bot that hops around worlds and trades the doublers 1gp, when they double that thinking that the player (bot) would do a much bigger trade, the bot yells "Scammed" and hops to a different world to double 1 gp yet again. 
---
This would make millions, guaranteed.
---
Are you kidding me dude? Just look up a YouTube guide like literally everyone else does. Did you even try to do any research on your own?
---
imagine being such a low life to create an account just to spoil something for everyone. Feel sorry for the parents having to take care this loser lol.
---
Oh my god he’s 42? Yikes British don’t age well huh
---
Jagex: we don't ban bots till later so as not to make the bot detection system easy
---
Bots with 50m rc/smithing/wc/mining/hunter untrimmed still in every single world.
---
Jagex cares more about a guy autoclicking for a mage level vs bots going for thousands of hours making bils.
---
Huh? If I didn’t get this post, I’d look up “poisoned karambwans” to see what the problem is and then see that they’re suppose to be cooked normally. What’s difficult about that lol
---
&gt;how can I reduce the number of brews I use?
---
don't get hit 4head.
---
in all seriousness you're still low kc and a learning curve is to be expected its easy to get overwhelmed at olm when you're new and you don't really understand whats going on or why.
---
once you get a few more kc under your belt and get more comfortable with the fight it just comes down to avoiding the mechanics and planing ahead. count the autos, its easier to avoid the specials if you know they're coming. bonus points if you or your teammates learn how to skip specials, its totally not needed but i *highly* recommend it once you and the boys are comfortable.
---
&gt;Are points the determinants of rewards?
---
yes
---
The bot the's using probably encountered something it wasnt designed to handle so he's been standing in the same place for hours not logging out. all the shit dropped on the floor is probably unrelated
---
That is so not relatable advice for 99.9% of the playerbase, my dude. I consider myself a relatively enfranchised player and I know what I’m doing in the game but my bank is only just barely worth 100m
---
Thank you for considering us &lt;3
---
they already do it at rev cave ingame now? we'd just see sparc macs tribe run through and clear out the place every week

I'm gonna keep it real with you, that's bad luck in my opinion.  Boots are like 250k and same rarity as bcp or tassies.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, suuuuper slow. Here's my pics: [https://imgur.com/a/gesiL2O](https://imgur.com/a/gesiL2O)
---
I tried blowpipe originally but died a few times. Got my kill with the rune cbow setup. Ruby bolts to start, then diamond to finish him off.
---
Long toes, sir sees-a-lot
---
Neat. thanks for the info! Maybe saved me some gp down the line...
---
yeah that's how it works
---
and anything with a value of over 1 coin would be protected over the stack, no matter how big
---
Yeah. Good point, thanks.
---
I should be praying range since I've got antidragonfire. Mage was old habit from my blowpipe attempts. I posted a pic of each here: [https://imgur.com/a/gesiL2O](https://imgur.com/a/gesiL2O)
---
Talk to the magic instructor in lumbridge.
---
That potential clue scroll rewards increased in value the more steps it had

This is a suuuuper slow kills, so I wouldn't necessary copy me. :P 
---
Here's my pics: [https://imgur.com/a/gesiL2O](https://imgur.com/a/gesiL2O)

Looks like it was just the alt account of someone or he just bought bonds to buy fashionscape. He didn't level anything so you don't see him in highscores like others have said.
---
Color of hair has a lot to do with it.
---
You can use lfr-learner to look for people to do this with ya
---
I tried blowpipe originally, but got wrecked. This setup: [https://imgur.com/Lrtlcop](https://imgur.com/Lrtlcop). Too poor for BGS or DWH, obviously. :D
---
Yeah a lot of people still White portal pk in populated worlds like w2. It’s lit
---
The easiest way to check the inflation of gp is to check out the [cost of a bond.](https://osrs.wiki/bond) You can see that the cost started low and has increased. 
---
Bonds are good examples because it's directly tied to a real life value and it's effects don't change or anything. 
---
There are very few gold sinks in osrs. Every time I do an action in the game, pure wealth is generated. Every creature I kill generates item drops which is wealth. Every time I click a pre deposit or tree I generate ore of wood which is wealth. 
---
The longer the game stays out, the more wealth is naturally generated by everyone. 
---
If we use coal and magic logs as examples, they are both always used for blast furnace, and fletching and alching respectively. Over time the gp value of these items might increase or double but the cost of coal might always be 1/4 of what magic logs cost. They're value has stayed the same but the gp has inflated over the years. 
---
I'm making up the numbers for everything but I hope it still makes sense. 
---
Consumed items like food and potions don't cost nearly as much as you get as drops from a boss. This is another clear example of wealth being generated with no gold sink.
---
You're alching the wrong things buddy
---
My concern is whether or not they can keep Classic fresh enough to have longevity.  Are they planning updates at all?  Do they really have the resources to develop separate expansions/updates for Classic alongside the main game?  Do they even want to split their resources like that?  OSRS lives because of its great updates.  I suspect Classic will require the same thing.
---
Please note exposing your account creation date is allowing possible hijackers to information to recover your account.
---
Delusional
---
Already a thing. Talk to the magic instructor in Lumby.
---
If you didn't know, you can also do the same thing with arrows. Talk to the range tutor and ammo you pick up will go straight to your ammo slot if you have the same ammo equipped.
---
Uff good thing you saw that, surely his craws bow isnt the problem ^^
---
That's fine. You clearly dont understand the game very well to think classic would even somewhat compete with retail. But that's okay, classic/tbc one button pve rotations with minimal boss mechanics is probably more your speed.
---
Oh word! Thanks man. I’ll delete this post now, good looks on the quick response.
---
Gotcha lol, figured it would be kind of a weird oversight to not have this option available
---
Yes

please add it back
---
110 cmb and regen. Don’t @ me
---
Yea I'm on the same boat as you. I'd just like a math mathematician to calculate the probability of getting these items specifically.
---
I know what you're thinking of but can't remember which quest it's from either. I'm pretty sure you had to talk to that dwarf or someone in the Wintertodt camp about smithing something?
---
Really well explained. Guess I'm a little unclear still on why it's bad though. If the inflation is proportionate across all in game items, does it matter? I may not be thinking this through haha
---
Well, so far two out the four "new leaders" have stepped down, citing "it's in their best interest".
---

He swears I made some threat, but in the same breathe that he's saying "he'll get me banned by talking to someone."Also, he's admitting, once again, that he stole it from me and refuses to change the name.

Wholesome. I lost 2m from being skull baited the other day and it feels horrible.
---
Your statement basically was you saying "im a pussy because bots have power over my fun" but in an elaborate statement.
---
But what if they don't have 50k?
---
Twas Zamorak, Sliske was out fking the Barrows Brothers or something.
---
To add to this make sure you use ranging potions, super cheap and help a TON with dps &amp; thus exp rates
---
That’s good to hear, thanks for the input
---
Thanks
---
Coulda told em about this 3 months ago
---
Peope said this when I introduced my 11 year old nephew to the game. Wasn't shocked when he still preferred fortnite.
---
Thanks for the advice and encouragement man. I see why you love him too!
---
I suggest just playing, then as you think, "I wish X had Y, or did Z" look through the settings for it.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I initiated the Authenticator on my older phone for my first account of 15 years. Old phone breaks, now I have no access to the account. I tried using my email but my dumb ass kid self set up my RS account with my email from childhood which of course I forgot the password too with no backup opportunities to get into the account. 
---
Talk about a stab in the testicles. 
---
TLDR: first account of right at 15 years is locked out and I have no access.
---
Nice I am hoping to get torso after the gloves
---
What
---
A pure for pking
---
Bankcard and username in the same pic, gf accounts.
---
thats sick. claws are a super neat weapon to have early. got mine so late i'll hardly end up using them :(
---
Nice! What lvl prayer?
---
I repost shit so I must deserve karma.
---
They need to be doing hardware bans... something something MAC address... source: vaguely remember network security class I think i took
---
That’s a big no
---
Are you looking to buy one or whats the question? Buying accounts is against the game rules
---
I wasn’t there, just saw this post and another video where he showed how he walked back and forth doing the same thing
---
Imma n00b lol dont worry about it
---
When I was 12 and first playing this game, I thought "Gz" meant "jeez", like people were fed up or unimpressed.
---
Assuming this isn't just the OP and a friend trying to farm karma or something, this person may just not know what it means.
---
Or they're just a bad person.  Either one.
---
What in the actual fuck are those ticket requirements.
---
Does this mean I can attend will readings saying Share I TBed
---
I can’t wait until they release mobile..... wait what!?!
---
Realistically the only efficient boss you can do with those stats is Venenatis using the safespot. Venenatis is very profitable but obviously is in the wilderness so it's up to you
---
You won't save anything but alching a rare item can deny the pker a lot of gold. That's only really relevant if you get smited while 4-iteming or in DMM though.
---
Welcome back
---
From here? None but enough reports went out for them to run a manual check probably.
---
No it’s not - it’s an hour, whether you’re logged in or not.
---
Get your magic up and go do Zulrah or barrows, you can also try any of the lower tier wildy bosses (chaos ele/fanatic, archeologist, scorpia, etc)
---
You aren't missing anything. You play however you wanna play
---
You lose more money by leaving it on the floor
---
Honestly, if a player bans 100 000 bots they deserve a tbow. Its only fair, the price of a tbow devided by 100 000 nearly gets to like 10k for every bot banned.
---
You actually lose ~no~ money by leaving items on the floor lol
---
You could always use an alt/ask a friend or someone at the ge to help when you’ve your buy limit. I’m always happy to help someone who’s hit their buy limit in the ge, I’m sure plenty others are the same.
---
How did you find this GIF of me
---
MOM! BATHROOM!!
---
It should be. It was on the list and I can confirm that a staff of fire is considered warm gear because it was my fourth item on my skiller.
---
Implying any iron would ever hide the helmet.
---
Nobody:
---
Be a man and show your rsn so I can go add you to my ignore list
---
Vorkath may be a bit difficult, acid phase (if you are trying to woox walk) and his one hit kill fireball will be hard to dodge because of connection issues, if I lag out for one second I just die because my character doesnt move while the fireball starts falling on him. Zulrah is much more doable regardless of ping (I play on my laptop with a questionable connection, vorkath is hell but Zulrah is really easy)
---
Just train slayer and get ur stats up man.....
---
Watch the movie, you’ll enjoy it and you get to see “something happen”. This film perfected the western genre.
---
I hear a lot about ironmen and they're almost all i see on videos now, but does that mean regular accounts have lost "credibility" and aren't as neat anymore? I felt the idea of playing imo was the highscores and climbing on the leaderboard, is that lessened by ironmen? Should I just make an ironman?
---
Its a fun idea but I can only see it having a really niche use.
---
It’s called the good bad and the ugly, forgot to mention that
---
Obor
---
2 spooky.
---
Cool, 
---
Last question I have, if it's a good investment then is price the only reason everyone doesn't use one? The blowpipe seems to be the undisputed weapon of choice for pretty much everyone there and part of my trepidation is just imagining that must be for a reason.
---
Its like dropping the soap in prison.
---
Hahahaha gold. Don't sweat about the gp,  just kill Vorkath or Zulrah for 30minutes.
---
It’s easy to avoid this. Before doing any PvM content check what world you’re in. I dc and die a bunch so I just hop on my iphone through LTE and collect my stuff.
---
you dont risk shit with a bp. with craws you risk &gt;1k ether always
---
I have mobile and I don’t think I have PvM skill to do it even if I had a pc :p
---
          w
---
Its just Herblore dude, be cool about it.
---
By that logic, you shouldn't borrow items from others because you might make the money believe that everyone who borrows items would return them.
---
i mean a maxed pure is suboptimal isnt it? you wanna cannon/pump or fish/alch+splash to keep hp low for a super min maxed pure.
---
My body is ready
---
Could be def xp from long ranging
---
This is how I feel trying to get anything done on my ironman
---
A full potion is 4 sips which is 40 damage. 2 brew sips at 99 hp heal 34.
---
The crosspost is from world of warcraft. I'd rather passionate support workers than literal no customer support.
---
This is gold, thanks op
---
Why would he draw Konar non mirrored but Nieve mirrored?
---
kinda sad as I planned to learn the mode yesterday and was met with this
---
If your argument is that getting 2-3 def isn't a ruined account and its actually better then this discussion is pointless with you.  
---
Regardless, people do quit after misclicking/accidently gaining unwanted defence xp and there should be an alternative option in place seen as the only suggestion to change this was voted against
---
Dude we had the same goal and journey. Except I gave up and went a did construction once I got to hard kandarin diaries
---
Is this supposed to be good or bad
---
Is global warming real
---
It's apple tree, barely and tomato seeds from a 3 day wait
---
They wanna be hellhounds really bad
---
Just like cyber security, it's a game of cat and mouse. There is no such thing as a 100% secure system. This can be applied for bots. 
---
If you ban/mute players for certain things, that on the surface seem like a good idea, most likely there will be legitimate players negatively impacted.
---
This is what it's all about fam &lt;3
---
Love this guy lmfao
---
They actually got back to me it was a server error that they are working to resolve. I have been refunded and am being sent signed concept art for the troubles.   I can send you pictures of the messages from jagex.. you just called me stupid over jagex having a server error which I'm being compensated for.. who's the idiot?
---
Does he enjoy being referred to as a god now
---
Youd be pretty hard pressed to find a game more grindy than OSRS. Literally the entire game is built around grinding
---
Ok, I did what you suggested. I did not encounter the bug you described.

Update guys: Jagex are notified of the system error with replies email not working.  I have been refunded in full and they are sending me signed concept art for the inconvenience. 
---
For those that told me I'm stupid I can send you screenshots of the messages from Jagex to prove what I am saying is true. 
---
Thanks for the help for those that did.
---
That's not what I meant. Does the ether I use to charge the bow get stored in the bow for PKers to find, or does it just disappear?
---
Low level alchemy
---
High level alchemy
---
Ground level alchemy
---
Ha, I get it because I started the quest, I am a smartboi.
---
Turned out to be an error on jagex side with the email server, ice been refunded in full and am getting sent signed concept art as compensation.  Thank you for your help twiggled
---
Not with that agil
---
Amazing
---
Wow support is actually trash though, but at least they Rp
---
This is perfection. God tier post.
---
Debatable, that's why it's referred to as "climate change" instead.
---
They get mad when they get def xp
---
Only impressive if you didn't do zeah runespan.
---
Awesome, glad you got it sorted!
---
Verac is better

:thinking:

Did you happen to pick any herbs from the patch before inspecting it? If herb patch loses any lifes, it will display different levels of compost used. More about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bd553t/bottomless_compost_bucketattas_seed_interaction/ekvxq3d/?st=jvw5yml4&amp;sh=c2d30352
---
This was somewhat the solution in terms of alternative contact but the replies email on PayPal should be fixed by now.  They where having internal issues with replies not making it to their emails.   I have been refunded and compensated, thanks for your assistance.
---
inb4 they spike in value just like the zulrah teleports, after jagex change the in-game mechanics somehow
---
Repost for the 10th time.

you and your god damn feet
---
"Finally" -_- My main is 143 kc, almost all on task.. every extra cape gambled. No jad
---
Y
---
Can't find him anywhere anymore....
---
that doesn't explain why the rest of them are just assholes alot of the time
---
Yes, it gets charged in the bow and shows up as a drop on death. Aka you'll always be at least a ~180k pk.
---
What stats are required for zulrah? I have 80/85/80 combat 78 magic and 64 range and 51 prayer
---
I would say it depends on what you’re doing. I’ve played this game for about 15 years, but I’m definitely a noob at raids or pking.
---
In the other hand, I am a pro afker! :P
---
Qroma they messaged me through the ingame message center.  Like when you log in it says how many messages you have so I can confirm it's definitely jagex staff that have contacted me, it's in there with all the generic messages you get each month when the membership renews.  Although I thank you for your advice and appreciate you taking the time to add your input in terms of security.
---
For xp yes but that's not possible if you're not filthy rich. The coal bag is worth it
---
Don't give up now brother.
---
As long as Morgan freeman plays the wise old man I’m in.
---
Why are you mad that this dude has a circle on the blue instead of the green is what im confused about.
---
Think i got it trapped, someone best be quick!
---
Yah you can hide behind the rock and lure one at a time
---
3 fire runes, 1 nature. you know what to do.
---
Why tf do people bring expensive shit to mage arena
---
Literally you just need to cast the spell, not hit.
---
Wear black dhide and take only 100 casts
---
too bad I'm untraceable buddy
---
Happy cakeday.
---
Because its so easy without it im not mad just confused why it is nessesary
---
You can do beginner clues in like 1-2 mins each if you have the correct teleports. The hot n cold steps have like only 5 possible locations, and it's very easy to figure out which one it is at. After doing a few of them you can memorize the spots even without the wiki
---
Teleports what I use for the hot n colds: Draynor manor tabs, Lassar teleport tabs (ice mountain), duel ring, and amulet of glory.
---
I think these teleports would be pretty high requirement for a low level ironman, but I don't think beginners are aimed for those accounts
---
But then again, if you're not looking wiki for beginner clues, try the same with hards :P coordinates would take way longer than figuring out beginner clue hot n colds
---
I use ultracompost and water it.
---
It's a good feel. Keep it up.
---

Thnx man!

The worst part of RFD is realising you dont have enough QP for the last part
---
Kennut smol indiana compani
---
got it thanks!
---
Nah it's cause he hadn't done the quest so there was no option
---
Presumably because 99 cooking is a shit 99
---
Haha, I'm well aware! That quest was easily in my top 5 of favourite pre-EoC quests.
---
Thanks man! It’s a good feeling! You’ll get it done!
---
Different one.
---
You've done an amazing job here!
---
How are Melee G Maulers compared to Ranged Maulers? I could just get Ranged but pure melee is more of my thing. And I like to use something different than the average 'cookie cutter' build that is the Ranger G Mauler ;P
---
I've anti pked so many losers at wildy altar with a dds haha
---
Because "without a god" is atheism lol
---
&gt;	It’s unbelievable that I lost a huge part of my bank over something I cannot control
---
That’s where you’re wrong kiddo.
---
Nice! Glad someone did,  i had to leave it there in the end !
---
Bro he literally has fingers where his toes should be lmao
---
50/50
---
one way or another you're not telling the truth. it's stupidly easy to recover an account granted you have enough info. You claim to have old passwords and payment details. Which is plenty to recover any acc. dont speak about this again lol
---
yes slightly. But you can get some new items that hold some value too, example: Spiked manacles.
---
So overall the loot of a med clue probably has not been lowered.
---
Yes, although it's very niche regarding Purple Portal.
---
At least you are getting unsireds, gl friend.
---
My OCD hurts.
---
None
---
I just splash with fire wave usually. Its 50k exp/h at 6gp/exp. 
---
4 clicks/h just in inventory. (Click once every 15min into inventory)
---
Do something else while doing it.(On a different acc or work or whatever)
---
If you want it really fast bursting at mm2 tunnel is really good. Like 200k exp/h.
---
Go to lettulainens stream and try to get in on his learner raids
---
Melee is my wager. Cheaper aswell. If you go ranged you should stand in melee range and pray protect from melee though. Breaks up the attacks nicely
---
as a UIM
---
I mean, yeah. I meant the normal case, not this specifically.
---
Pretty sure they changed swearing and you annot get muted any more
---
Super combat potions are the best gp/exp you can get, so if you are thight on money go for those after 90. Its a bit more clicks but with the new bank x its quite doable.
---
Dam. Didn't even need a conversation to know you.
---
44
---
Yet every content creator just seems to pay for in bonds or donations of bonds/gp from players.
---
Torvesta is so jewish he ran out of fucking membership while pking because he only uses bonds while making bank on YT. Churning out the same video with a slightly different montage of gmaul spec KO's.
---
He has so many accounts so i definetly understand why he uses bonds
---
This is the comment of a person who does not understand long term relationships
---
Honestly this would be great for slayer. I was just thinking the other day how good something like this would be lol.
---
Why do ppl prefer seers to ww?
---
when has that been the case? most ads i see are like 30 seconds, and it only takes 3 presses of "L" key on your keyboard (or 3 doubletaps right on mobile) to skip it
---
You don't spend time drinking potions btw they dont delay only cancel
---
Im a full time pker when it comes to rs, and I rarely encounter toxicity. Just curious where do you people encounter these toxic pures?
---
Depends how poor the scammer is lol, I've seen people scam 50k
---
Oof
---
Love ash’ bants. Could totally have a pint with him.
---
hygiene bad
---
I don't really bank on any tasks apart from wyrms atm unless I have a full inv of loot since I'm still low slayer, I do have tank legs in the bank though for when I feel like I take a lot of damage, will be switching it up soon anyway :D
---
? It's not mob mentality to not trust money doublers, it's common sense
---
1750 skill total.
---
Demonic ofc
---
haha yes.
---
I tried wearing goblin mail that year
---
Still not a fan of this being partner-based.
---
I'm currently working on 70 slayer for my next video, at 66/70 so far so I'm getting real close! After that I'm gonna be spending some time training prayer/mage then doing some skills/quests so I can access more clue scrolls etc :) gl on your adventure man
---
You're a good person. I always tell them to fuck off then add them to ignore
---
Yo don't even sweat it. I got 48 defense on my zerker pure and had so many people say that it's time to make it a main/med level due to it being ruined..dude I'm 1 cb lvl higher fighting people four levels lower, 1 level lower, two levels higher, thirty levels higher, it doesn't matter. 1 level doesn't change anything.. if you're in a fight and you die, it won't be because you had 1 less strength level than your opponent lol
---
Good eye friend.
---
Ofc it can be faked, but sadly this is true. I'vr been around 1k dry for second zenyte.
---
What about my “the best”??
---
Learned your lesson with a small amount at least
---
This got changed a while back, now it's something like 12 seconds of login time counts against your boost, not that it drops every 12, but if you kept logging in for 12 secs only your Stat would drop after a few tries
---
wily cats almost never die, deffo worth the investment
---
Well with a drop rate like that I gotta ask
---
I really wouldn't play RSPS while playing normal rs, all they need to do is bundle in a rat or use your login if its the same, and you'd never even know.
---
CoX was 6-8m an hour last year maybe, nowadays it relies entirely on t bow drops
---
Forcing people to do shit content rather than fixing dead content is not good.
---
Everyone wants easyscape, no one wants to admit it. 
---
Me neither.
---
occult, book of darkness, do ma2 for the imbued cape. if you have 14.6m or something, you could get tormented bracelet, my only concern would be that buying it will take up almost all of that 15m of yours.
---
Offensive/Inappropriate Language **Major**
---
Yes, but unless they're actually being alched, they won't contribute to inflation.
---
Drugs are what you make of em. I personally like injecting marijuanas.
---
If I was to guess, the only recent thing outside Morytania that can get you into it that has been added to the game recently is the Portal Nexus, and the Kharyll tele therein. I'd be surprised if they didn't just lift the Kharyll tele code from the existing portal however.
---
Found a 2000+ total level ironman botting zmi but his bot broke, everyone seen it and reported him. I added him and to this day his account was never banned for it.
---
The mods are probably all working on the elf quest and Prifddinas.
---
i got 70 agility just so i could do a a konar task efficiently, but now i don't have to touch agility for awhile, so i have that going for me

Ive got perm banned for auto clicking alchs with zero prior offences

I approve

Didn't pay that much attention. Who knows

I dont get it?

Whats the trick to keeping HP at 1 doing NMZ?? I use Dwarven rockcake to get down to 1hp, then take absorption potion.. but my health keeps going up, and become less AFK. Any tips?
---
Underrated post, lol
---
did you recently pray at edgeville monastery or the grotto in morytania?
---
i feels man
---
I don't think I did, as far as I recall, the last place I prayed was at the black knights fortress.
---
If f2p then that's the best you have, if p2p you can get xerician or mystic robes.
---
It’s a runelite thing i think.
---
It may be the graceful?
---
Cannonballs = \~3 minute afk
---
Infernal Eels = \~2 minute afk depending on spawns, never have to leave either. 
---
Anglerfish = \~3 minute afk
---
Redwoods = \~90s afk depending on luck 
---
Everything else is going to be every 60-90s
---
&gt;Other players have access after an hour.
---
This isn't true.
---
&gt;Why didn't OP just loot his stuff, and did the other guy know how much to give?
---
Idk. He probably lost it somehow and that guy saw him talking about it.
---
Did you put a question mark because you weren't sure? Amazon and Twitch Prime are essentially the same thing. You can get a free trial, too.
---
With the guantlets, I thought it was pretty okay gold/xp/hr....
---
Only if you take prayer pots. Otherwise super combats and absorptions for some ultra afk goodness.
---
I got 2 ikkle hydras by 400kc....sorry guys.
---
I don't think you get what DMT is. No offence.
---
People literally call it "the spirit molecule" and it's liquid form, [Ayahuasca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) has
---
  been used in spiritual and religious ceremonies since like forever. 
---
Nobody does it to get high for shits and giggles. People that wanna do that aren't interested in it because it's so intense. It's like a dream only it seems 100% real and feels like it lasts *years* (no exaggeration) despite you only being out of it for 15 minutes, according to a guy I know who tried it.
---
Should be a reward from the Fremenikk hard diary
---
If you buy Rig it'll increase your DPS in lots of places, so should be worth it.
---
You can use it at Vork (obviously), but you can do hydra too (if 95 slay), rev caves with BP it's pretty OP, too.  And you could always just go kill other stuff but not need to use rig unless you wanted to.
---
Tho I can't wait for Ancient Runescape, year of release is estimated to be 2277

How do you camp for dwh? Wiki says you need to be on task to get it?
---
He's projecting.

&gt;like it’s your personality that you watch it.

He thinks that the fact he doesn't watch a TV show that most do is a defining character trait.

Does this mean I shouldn't be hoarding my gp, but spending it because it'll drop in value over time anyway? Or will more items entering the game offset the drop in value of gp
---
you should get a job or something
---
Maybe it’s Mory hard?
---
Good, make sure you don’t shit your pants on the way to 75
---
With camera zoomed in as far as possible
---
Gratz my guy. That's ironman rng btw
---
delete this
---
We get more game updates. A lot of rs3 is MTX updates
---
Ah, thank you
---
Lmaooo
---
Dont forget the 30 tabs of chrome open for it all..
---
Pretending that all sponsors are the same is stupid.
---
Some just want you to play the ad and plug your discount code, which is perfectly fine, but some actually send you a script, and they want to use you as a mouthpiece, manipulating your viewers to get the game with shit like **"I've been playing this incredible game for weeks! come join me!"** Then it all ends up being some pay to win garbage, designed to make you addicted to the cash shop from the moment you first log-in, and the content creator himself is nowhere to be seen in-game.
---
I'm sorry, but if a content creator doesn't have the goddamn backbone to reject these bottom feeders, I'm not going to support them. If it comes down to money versus being honest to your viewers, just choose the goddamn honesty.
---
Or you can build a Bell-Pull so you can summon him whenever he runs off.
---
looks fucking shit
---
Runescape doesn't support Chrome. Is that it?
---
avas + mage arena (2) cape. I would highly recommend bringing a cape switch because you throw darts away without avas, and MA2 cape gives huge accuracy bonuses
---
More than RS3 BUDDY
---
Not using Chrome. Not sure what you mean by that.
---
I came back right as mobile was released and haven’t stopped since. It’s definitely not to late!  Come join the fun!
---
You have 5 Indigo Circles in your 7th inventory slot
---
2 of them were in 1 task.
---
Those are violet
---
Q
---
Waste of marks :,(
---
I honesty could not tell you. I think we were just kids walking around everywhere
---
I just got the theiving requirement so i know this pain..  Blackjacking is absolutely aids but i went from 45-53 in like an hour and a half or so
---
&gt; Currently I am working on only slayer to build up my bank
---
You have decent range -- you might also want to look into completing dragon slayer 2, and start killing vorkath
---
The dark purple is indigo. I've messed with the exchange machine for 30 minutes. Putting in numbers higher than 6 yet I never get an Indigo circle. Idk if I'm missing something or what
---
whole
---
I just Press the J key 3 times to skip the ad
---
My bad, in that case you use the token exchanger to the right of the machine, and you put in any amount of tokens that make up 6 or more and keep exchanging until you get an indigo circle
---
That's really nice, I need money, I love doing clues and I need the thieving.. I'll try that, thanks!
---
Try whale cc
---
Whenever I spot Dragons or Luckys, I hop into a streamer / content creator's cc and shout it out.
---
that helps so much. thanks!
---
That has been fixed for a while bud.
---
HD nipple
---
You’re confusing sociopath with lonely losers who think being edgy online makes them interesting.
---
Fishing monkfish is also afk, if you go to a world where more people are fishing its easy to spot the fishing spot
---
It has more players now than ever in OSRS history  :)
---
Not to be rude but uhh...is it not fairly clear that if you don't have max stats and gear, then someone with max stats and gear could get more kills per hour?
---
Oh... :/
---
RWTers don't hurt Jagex unless you count the lost money from people who would otherwise buy bonds, in which case is a very tiny percent of their revenue that they almost certainly make up the difference from bots who buy membership
---
Stop
---
Would really recommend waiting until Rigour to do Sara/Arma for maximum trip lengths if you're soloing
---
I don't believe RWT to be morally wrong.
---
For dharok, not really. If you really wanna just sit and do nothing you could use guthans on easy mode but it's way less exp/hour
---
M'kayy.....
---
New Item: Goldcrusher.
---
Automatically alchs everything you pick up. No exceptions.
---
It takes like 60 second to make a new Gmail and it's more secure to have your rs account on a separate email anyway.
---
Looks like sarcasm to me.
---
make more :D
---
They dont even drop anything good so atleast you didnt miss anything
---
No worries, wear full H.A.M robes you can get them from pick pocketing, also pickpocket the women members they tend to catch you less.
---
How did you get 1/139,000?
---
Having your game filled with goldfarmers/botters just turns off legitimate players. Ironically not banning goldfarmers/botters would also hurt them because it would make gold worthless.
---
Only reason I did corsair curse was because I needed to do the final battle
---
Can it be stored individually in a POH?
---
How about I pwn u
---
Thanks! You're a real G
---
Gz man, rigour will pay for itself easily if you ever get into zulrah or raiding
---
Bonds at a low level are kind of hard and are based around how much time you have to spend to dedicate to grinding 1 or 2 good moneymakers. However at the moment you can get a free 30 days membership with a twitch.tv event going on! Which would give you a nice headstart to start earning some money.
---
yeah definietely ;)
---
why not regen bracelet
---
Have a group take you to bandos
---
Exactly
---
with Ruby bolts e and diamond bolts e its a pretty easy quest. the requirements can definitely be a pain to get, but it's totally worth it
---
You are correct! I realized I can save a click (and less chances of me messing up on Jad) with a chin to aggro all the healers.
---
i started last week as well its still alive :)
---
Ruined
---
I would assume it helps, but idk when is the best time to use the special attack
---
Best way is to come up with a sob story to get people here to give u the 4m, oh wait...
---
Might try that next task
---
Hmm, good point. I had always tried the fishing guild where people are kind of spread out
---
most of it is new, some of it is obviously rehashed rs3 content unfortunately
---
Pretty sure it’s 50/50
---
Have a look at https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide. Generally it is very time-consuming to get a bond to begin with as F2P, but once you're a member it isn't so bad to maintain one if you play a lot.
---
What are your stats looking like? How easy it is to make money depends on your stats, what quests you've completed, if you're currently free or mems, etc.
---
About begging, yeah it's unfortunately an easy way to make some cash, but at the cost of dignity. People despise people who beg. They're annoying and don't deserve any free money. Some people genuinely feel bad or just want to give back and do give out plenty though.
---
Also, best of luck with the chemo!
---
You think you have no problem with it, but it costs a hilarious amount of money. A week is like 150m I think? It is only worth it for ironmen and even then not really worth it tbh
---
Try wyrm bones on the chaos alter, if you suicide after every inventory then you're risking almost nothing and saving tons of money
---
So is it possible on the 50th kill to get 3 heads.
---
Yea. I'm just not that interested in playing OS at The moment. It's fine on phone for now
---
Wow thanks, would you tell me how to the twitch thing kind sir?
---
yea it just seems like you didn't plan out your quests very well. At this point the best advice I can give you is you just have to find another way to train your range, because chinning isn't really any option.
---
if you're S U P E R desperate to chin you could try getting your slayer up and chinning dust devils since you're obvi done dt. buuttt ive never heard of anyone doing that before, its all I can think of though. I think you're best bet is just to get to 75 range and then bp nmz.
---
Start anew
---
Whip drop rate can be pretty unforgiving :(. I’ve gotten like 11 in 9000+ kc
---
Also a good note to add. Because you can change the benefit you receive by changing the helmet, void is often used when multiple combat styles are needed but inventory is at a premium.
---
Post history seems to check out though.
---
Dude you need to check my luck we literally got the exact opposite luck
---
This has to be recent, I would have heard about it by now.
---
&gt; Now
---
I wouldn't count this as an achievement, if you didn't contribute to the fight, your win means nothing.
---
5/10
---
Yeah but the Wiki states smth like "using falador shield 3 boosts your kills per hour to 50" and I was worried that I forgot some crucial item or prayer that makes my kills be off by a huge kc/h.
---
So? That doesnt hurt them as a business because that doesn't cut in to their profits. Banning every single bot would hurt their profits far more. But its clear you have no idea how business works
---
Range is better here because you can get the vast, vast majority of range dps with just 4 items (dhcb, anguish, assembler, ward) and then all the rest of the stuff is insanely budget (black dhide, snakeskin boots) 
---
Melee is better in max but you need more items to make melee good and so it ends up being worse unless you're risking quite a bit more
---
same wtf?!?!?
---
Yup, maybe dhide over void for trip longevity if you wanna 15 minute afk
---
whatsupdog
---
Years mate
---
Thanks man! I just sold my fury and bought the last of my 3 zenytes, the torture. Hope it'll help. My next upgrade is really pricey, being rigour, then DHL
---
This isn’t true at all. RS3 has more content release last year than OSRS
---
Wiki says August of 2017
---
Lol, i can send you a photo of my only ball if you want
---
2 autos in to a special yeah. if they attack style changes in a predictable fashion its not in a way i have noticed.
---
43kc lol nice?
---
which one do you think is better gp per hour for me? if its vorkath id dump my money into a dhcb and then wouldnt have much left over for zulrah gear i feel like.
---
RS3 is the game for you then.
---
List pls
---
Take my money
---
Learn to raid, those stats are more than fine to start learning
---
I'd be happy if the MTA got axed entirely. People only suffer through it for diaries and the only players you'll ever see there are bots.
---
MFwMA has to be the single worst abbreviation I’ve seen in my entire life. Congrats
---
Maybe about 30 hours~, but it was good fun :)
---
Infernal eels are good if you have 80 fishing.
---
No banking required, spots are more visible than other types of fishing on mobile and they're in a confined area so you don't need to move the camera at all.
---
Decent gold for low effort skilling too
---
 Yep i was at 264qp for ages, only favour Quests Left. Guess what I didnt  finish that in 8 hours of fucking gameplay, 1 quest Left.
---
Someone asked if he made them, and he said over the past few days. I think he just means the models?
---
I never go in there so idk if it’s common. Maybe someone’s having an event? Lol
---
I got muted for a single line of "@@@" spam.
---
Bearing in mind this was in the CW lobby in 06 with literally hundreds of people doing it.
---
They only work with regular ores. Depending on the gloves tier
---
Yeah but if you do gold + mithril with coal bag you nearly break even and don’t lose much xp. Its more efficient unless you make 2.5m+/hour last I checked.
---
For what are you talking about. For slayer you're bis is going to be the str gear, but if you're afk training at nmz or something then obby is your bis until you get 89 str and 89 hp then dh is your bis.
---
H
---
Fake
---
Lol. This game just isn't in a good place at the extreme high level end for any of the major areas of the game. It's fine to play casually &amp; that definitely includes "the new pvm challenges". Just because you don't understand an alternative perspective doesn't mean it's wrong.
---
a trap a lot of newer raiders fall into in the last phase is they're focusing on olms health, their inventory, or their xp drops. you should be looking at your characters feet and prioritize moving out of the shadows above all else.
---
Get a permanent ban , then we'll talk.
---
It’s like it says, minor improvements and stability fixes. When they change something major that will actually be noticeable by the user then they’ll mention it. 
---
There’s no other information about what they changed on their website or Twitter.
---
Here I am, at 83 Farming.  Uber excited to unlock it just to have it unlocked.
---
oldest trick in the book
---
my mom pays my $11 and gp
---
I guess why would Slayer be different than say afking crabs? Wouldn't u want highest dps regardless?
---
Only like a year old
---
I'm tasked to stay at the top nearest to the mage hand on the last phase. However, on that phase, I'm basically just brewing non-stop and not getting off many attacks on olm at all. I look for shadows and try to dodge, but will always get hit
---
Would love to see this, rather than manually picking up items just to alch them anyways.
---
O u mean ppl kill u wow thanks i didnt realize
---
So you support botters, rwters, and rulebreakers if they claim that they're living under poor and miserable circumstances? Do you realise how much of a slippery slope this is?
---
You probably got shit on by a pure recently cause you sound salty af. Why do you care if people don't train defense? 1 def pures have a part of this game forever now and they aren't going anywhere. You're also being toxic by spitefully voting against pures.
---
3-4 brews is like, everyone has a bow and 500 kc level of play. its reasonable but don't worry about that right now.
---
Basically one small favour
---
Been thinking about doing Barrows pretty soon on my account. Stats are 60 stk/str/def 76 range, and 65 mage. Are these stats good enough to be efficient in Barrows? And if so, what gear should I be using? I have done Underground Pass and I have heard that Ibans is good here
---
You were totally being a dick, though.
---
They have other opportunities. Breaking laws in a game shouldn't be tolerated because of someone being in a poor situation. Everyone could use that excuse, and whoops, the game's flooded with botters and violators everywhere
---
If it wasn't for gold farmers and gold buyers this game would die. Think about it, probably 50% of the games population buys gold and wouldn't play if they couldnt
---
They dont. They're country is turmoil. And it's a rule. Not a law
---
I honestly don’t know. I’m not trying to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes. If I had done these things I would understand and accept my ban and move on. After all I don’t really play this game anymore. But it was nice to know i always had the option to go back and play. Now I don’t have that because there’s no way I’m going back to restart from scratch. If I ask for it to show evidence for the chat ban it says they explain the ban in my message Centre but when I go to the message Centre it says you can review the evidence in the account status.
---
Honestly yes. Way better upgrades at cheaper cost buy the most important thing is did you want the SGS. If so then fuck it and enjoy specing mobs.
---
Holy shit. Nieve came into my room to bring me a slayer task and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of bloodvelds out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I  slammed the door on her. I’m so distressed right now I don’t know what  to do. I didn’t mean to do that to Nieve but I’m literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he getting pked? This can’t be happening. I’m having a fucking  breakdown. I don’t want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a  future to believe in. I want Boaty to be mvp and fix this broken tournament. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn’t supposed  to be like this, I thought he was polling well in Twitch???? This is  so fucked.
---
Be prepared to die xD, the learning curve is tough but once you get it down it’s smooth like butter.
---
Gl on the rest of your quests!!
---
Lol sure
---
you can turn off the kourend favour, doesn't have much of a purpose considering you can just check it via quest/achievement screen
---
eh I mean what other gear you got? there's probably something more important, sgs is really useful but not exactly a must have gear upgrade depending on where you're at. I would probably go for the zenyte's first and a blowpipe/decent range gear if you don't have it.
---
Cool mom
---
&gt; can’t be that hard to detect
---
Do you know how many daily are detected and are banned?
---
&gt; I get that actual players might do this but it’s few.
---
That would be a few too many if they got banned.
---
You totally misunderstood my question my dude but thanks for trying
---
Out of curiosity, do you believe any game that offers real life purchases in them unethical? 
---
Even osrs can be pay to win.
---
Can you read?
---
Most people in pure crew don’t pk though they just skill
---
From your other comments they have access to your email account, which is where all of it happened. What email provider do you use?
---
Anyone know what exactly miscellania's approval rating does? I'm just wondering if it affects rate of gold consumption, or like profit per invested gp, and if that's the case, what threshold % should it be kept at?
---
https://haveibeenpwned.com/
---
check that.
---
Some of us enjoy torture :\^)
---
yeah i mean i knew the attk exp was gonna be an issue, but i was thinking it would be an issue way later, but im getting ready to move up to a whole new bracket and i need my range and mage way up there to move to 60 attack i feel
---
SGS is quite good if you're doing slayer. It will passively save you supplies ie gp if you spec with it whenever you can
---
More complicated
---
Now i can more efficiently steal drops
---
Not sure what you mean but I've made a little over 200m flipping so far so I fully understand it xD
---
wut?
---
Personally, runecrafting is far from being my favourite skill but whenever I train it I enjoy it a lot. I find it very relaxing and gives quite a lot of money.
---
Nah the retarded ones are the ones who fall for that shit.
---
I got like 5.5k essence on my first ever brimstone chest, 2 kills into my first Konar task. Pretty sure it's the least valuable reward on the list, but for my Ironman it was exactly what I wanted.
---
i do some serious gymnastics to keep this guy close while i'm training lol
---
Med is great. I have a lower level one but with a leveled-out med you can do bossing and multi pking with ease. A maxed med is only around lvl 108, giving you access to mid and higher brackets in deep wild/pvp worlds.
---
Lava eels, very afk fishing.
---
He had 0 deaths. Look at the screenshots.
---
I would see this as a very niche thing for a small group of people. Not worth adding a potion just for people who have a scythe.
---
this is my main btw, i just started again whdn they made it mobile cuz ive been homeless last year. im not a lil crybaby noob anymore like when i was a little kid and didnt know wtf was going on lol
---
What’s you’re range level? I’ve always had a hell of a time with the healers and am wondering if I should grind range a lil more before dumping my bank
---
What the fuck lol
---
Pack it up guys. We done.
---
we demand justice.
---
South is 89 agility, NW is the 75 one
---
howd you get iron ore at mlm?
---
You set the wrong price and the margins fucked you over
---
Prices change. Lol. I'm really not sure what you're confused about here.
---
Even worse on mobile... currently 76, working towards 83. I cant stand anymore!
---
Lmao reading it back, it does sound pretty crazy. But it happened exactly like I describe it. I'd say check out the vid but I'd rather him not have anotjer view on it
---
Cain’t wait for corpse only iron man mode.
---
i remember getting so frustrated my first gargoyle task bc i couldn't figure out the safespot, and I finally just asked the guy i was training w/ and he immediately showed me.  it was such a small thing, and I could have googled it, but dude had the game knowledge to just show me real quick, and it turned into a fun evening of training slayer w/ the guy
---
Why is this marked humour?? I want this.
---
I didnt insure it as that would tie it to the pure account and my main wouldnt be able to telegrab it
---
There is actually,  alone with about 8 more mutes which are equally as hilarious. I don't have a YouTube channel, but I'm tempted to make a video growing through all my previous mutes 13 years later and discussing how hilarious they are
---
You make me sick
---
So I still get logged out while switching world for no reason then?
---
Well hey nobody who gets hacked wants to admit they let their information slip, but it happened. There is no security problem at Jagex if you take your internet security seriously. You are very poorly mistaken if you think people only get hacked on Runescape, this is common everywhere in every single online service you can think of, we just hear about it so much cause reddit is a hive mind of the worst people on the internet.
---
Op brought his anal beads to class
---
Probably means when you're nitpicking everything and trying to have OSRS be the 'perfect game'.
---
Yea i noticed a lot of the osrs community are extremely negative. I have to close the chatbox as to not let them ruin the game for me, but i notice lots of begging, whining/depression about playing the game, people with superiority complex, bragging, or just displeasure to play with. Didnt ever notice this in rs3 but was ironman and that community wasn’t toxic
---
Honestly it’s been a couple years since it was sorted out so I don’t remember exactly how I did it. They did the same thing to me but I tried again later and got through to them. Honestly if I were to do it again I’d probably start by making a general ticket not necessarily for an appeal but just to get to them then explain what happened.
---
F2p cwars &gt; p2p cwars
---
im going to lol
---
My bad thanks for correcting me then
---
Ferocious will always be better for only
---
Melee tasks, it gets a bit complicated for hybrid tasks
---
depending on the email provider you can check the ips that people have logged on to.
---
100% they knew your email password and got on it. You should ALWAYS have F2A on your email.
---
Im on mobile only also. 70k xp to 83 construction. This has been terrible 4 days...
---
I love the OSRS community (at times) for being so open and not triggered by the slightest words.
---
Yet in real life, I see people getting triggered over absolutely benign things. You can't tell a joke without people getting offended. YES: some jokes are MEANT to be provocative, but people used to suck it up. People are wusses now, crying at the slightest thing.
---
Remember if you ever feel like making commentary about something you don't understand, go to Tom Pendragon for advice
---
That’s the clutchest panic in history. That’s like dropping ur stuff at the varrock gate then the scammers friends start to spam the gate but u hop worlds before it appears and pick ur stuff up
---
&gt; rsmap.uk
---
Looks like an RS work map raster image, converted to vector data and fed into Leaflet as a raster image? I've done something similar for offline maps.
---
So you do a ton of drugs then?
---
Okay, so they've either recovered the account or did it through your registered email. Which is unfortunately the worst that could happen. 
---
Could you reconfirm the "signed into" part? It doesn't make sense to me that a hijacker would waste time changing the email and password. To clarify, you should be looking at something similar to [Reddit's account activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity) and not guess it yourself. Both Outlook and Gmail have that feature, not sure about other email providers.
---
Anyhow, now you need to figure out yourself how they managed to get your passwords. Do you happen to use the same login details everywhere? Or did you in the past? Unfortunately a lot of people do and quite often websites get their database compromised. This means they can use those details to login everywhere you have an account. Check www.haveibeenpwned.com to see if that happened to your email and where.
---
Me dumb
---
Very true, the fairy ring is like right next to it too
---
You're right to be sceptical, but this site is legit. The owner is renowned for is security research. You don't need to enter your password anywhere, just do the email. If you want to see what passwords are in the databases as well you can download the files. It's actually a pretty fun read.
---
I agree. But that’s the problem with a game like osrs. The older it gets the more content that goes into the game. Over time there are so many updates that tons of people don’t know about. 
---
The best way to go about this is to join a clan and ask questions. People will tell you the “best” way to do things and often suggest things you might not know about.
---
You could give PvM a shot, it's pretty enjoyable. If you're a skiller, most gathering skills are pretty profitable.
---
Aug 2 my b day
---
Depends how afk you're planning on going. If you're staying close to 1hp then DH will be best. Use the DPS calculator to work it out though as to where the break point is.
---
Yup
---
I have no respect for rev clans who use scouting bots, which might be all of em.
---
This is exactly how I play RuneScape set a goal and instead of just grinidng out the req just go down the rabbit hole to make the grind faster even though I could have had it done much sooner if I just did the initial grind
---
This is the only logical response
---
Not sure how people can justify hating on someone for taking money for ad-ing a mobile game that they have no obligation to play
---
It means the creator probably is going keep making content
---
Killing someone in self defense irl isnt an asshole thing to do
---
“You wouldnt say it was ok if it wasnt”
---
4head. 
---
Anyone who crosses the ditch purposely has consented to being attacked.
---
Lmao to be honest I did addy for 2 hours then used the money I got to buy like 3k gold ore
---
Currently training Agi to 70, so I can get to the Lava Eel in Taverley Dungeon without needing a Dusty Key, so that I can then finish the Heroes quest to get rid of this Entrana Firebird Feather for an extra inventory slot (This is why most people don't play UIM).
---
Nice 53 hunter pure.
---
Yea as I said above, I was a dumbass and lost my cat to a behemoth. So I just decided to get the skill. I'm going to need higher if I wanna get trimmed qp cape anyway.
---
ergonomics
---
they can only bypass it with a team cape if you are also wearing a team cape i believe
---
Yeah those were crazy times. 
---
Noob! 
---
"Reported."
---
No. No please.
---
Everything stays relevant in this game. You can pick it up whenever and you won’t be missing out
---
its the crab people
---
? What clue scrolls u doin bruv
---
BYE BYE ERZURUM. told you guys they were cunts.
---
If you’re talking about 20 minutes afk at a time then max strength gear is better. 
---
If you’re talking about 5 minutes afk at a time then dh is going to be better with your stats.

A game changer for ice demon.
---
What do you think Weath is doing everyday?
---
This type of thing scares me sometimes because I lend equipment or help out my irl friends here and there. Nothing like bills and tbows but still. It keeps my friends playing sometimes to have some help lol.
---
It's older for sure. I've been using it for longer than that.
---
It’s been fixed for me as well as seeing others post on here that their issues have been resolved with mobile. Have you uninstalled and reinstalled the app? I’m pretty sure I saw someone post that fixed theirs, however I didn’t need to do that.
---
i hope you can still get muted for throwing n-bombs around
---
I just want to run in with a broom at sweep the shit out of them. Would I be overrun and swarmed to death? Probably. Would those little crusty bastards get swept to fuck first? You bet your $11 they would.
---
Come on now. OP was calling people the N word as well.
---
Try bringing less switches. You don’t need to have an 8 way boaty switch if you’re learning.
---
I'm glad you worked out the BP issues, just a heads up if you're still having trouble tanking damage, switching to karil's will help mitigate a lot of the damage from vork's ranged attacks.
---
Finally guildmaster Jane getting some recognition as best girl.
---
You can do it but only if the pet isn't insured. Hard to get the timing right though!
---
Wasn’t self defense though? He asked me to help him because he was getting pked and then when we pked the guy together he started attacking me because he didn’t get the loot. Not saying it’s wrong but it’s just an asshole thing to do.
---
Finished my qp cape yesterday as well. My last 5 quests in order were.

Point blank.

Go back to rs3

Remember, I have the chat logs, you say
---
"how much loot do you have on you?"
---
"have you ever been pked?"
---
"God I want to pk you so bad"
---
for the final bosses, do i need to do desert treasure?
---
I'm at like 3 in 300 lol.  Probably one of the luckier things that's happened to me on my BTW.  I did go 2k dry for whip when boosting +5 with slayer pies, though.
---
Can’t hear you over my smart choices. Stuff it molly.
---
I'm sorry, but if a dumbass YouTube lurker doesn't have the goddamn backbone to not put money into a mobile game, they're the only one to blame here. If it comes down to being a numbskull and knowing when someone is clearly being sponsored, I'm blaming the retard who can't comprehend that. 
---
Ad-ing is selling a product, you think these game sponsors all have 100% free, 100% unlocked games? Are you that daft?
---
If you ever do barbarian assault I'd love to tag along, i suck and nobody plays enough for me to be able to get it. I'm lvl 104.
---
I think he means third age pick.
---
I wouldn’t buy THEM ALL.
---
If Jagex released a Lego Lumbridge Castle id be all over that shit
---
Huh
---
that...wasnt me....I was hacked i swear
---
Boys can be pretty too.
---
And then you take a break, come back to the game and realize they've added another 4-5 quests that you now feel obligated to do since you already have the quest cape, gotta be able to wear it.
---
Make sure you have at least 5hp just in case shes wearing a recoil. Better safe than sorry
---
Too niche of a market.
---
Exactly right, used 'gdal2tiles-leaflet' for making the tiles then passing them through to leaflet.
---
Dungeons were a bit more work as they don't use the same logic and come from a different source :)
---
Just get a third age pickaxe /s
---
If only I could bring a teleport..
---
I thought you were making a joke at first.
---
This is a strange sub. Any post can go any direction. 
---
Here is someone being forgiven for literally making a massive time consuming fuck up and not noticing. 
---
That’s the game bud! Pay attention lol.
---
Love your videos, and I always see you commenting on other snowflake videos, it's awesome how connected to the community you are. Hope to see you in on the next podcast with Settled, J1mmy, and Framed!
---
I love you both
---
You can use [this](https://www.runehq.com/oldschoolquest) link to sort the quests that give the most quest points. It might be missing a couple of the newer quests, but it's a useful tool.
---
My understanding is yes, he would avoid the evasion charge.

I believe the correct term is coprophobic

Fuck u lol

Yeah a lot of times someone has to report you for anything to happen back then.

What devices do you use?

Buy high, sell low 5head
---
Yeah sorry I should have worded that better, but I guess that is what I meant. What situations is it good for based on how much it costs to use the Blowpipe. So I suppose any situation where you can still profit while using it then. So will probably be a while before I can use one without losing money.
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about. Many, many mmos have made zones with distinct PvP zones and pk’ing is never labeled as griefing inside said zones. 
---
In Warhammer Online, the best exp grind was in the pvp lakes, rats, and it was very likely for a party of the enemy faction to gank you from time to time while grinding. Don’t want to be under the threat of getting yanked? You don’t get premium resources. 
---
In BDO if your not in a safe area you can be flagged on and attacked. This rarely happens unless you’re at a premium grind spot (I haven’t played since year 1 of the game or so, so could have changed). Don’t want to get flagged on and killed? Leave the premium spots. 
---
In The Devision (1 &amp; 2) the Dark Zone(s) are some of the best place to get gear but other players can go rogue and kill you. 
---
Stop with your entitled bullshit. If you don’t want to play with a higher risk, you don’t get to expect higher rewards. It’s not griefing, the rules of the wildly are very clear and straightforward. You more than likely understand the rules of the wildly when you enter, so when you enter you are agreeing to those rules. You don’t get to cry and complain about the rules being broken when you come out behind. You knew the rules and risk, either play by them or don’t. If you want then changed, fair, but you don’t get to pretend the current rules are something they aren’t.

"It's too twisted to hold comfortably"
---
I've gotten them hard clues before but have no idea what or where to go with them
---
Ironic
---
or you could bite the bullet and do quests that you'll def want to be done eventually, such as dragon slayer 2 prerequisites e.g.
---
Same can be said for stabbing a wooden staff through OSRS character's baseball shaped hands but I don't see them blocking that feature smh
---
Ehh not entirely correct
---
Yea its pretty expensive but learning how to do everything myself and finding a solid group of people to get it done seemed daunting.
---
Wait so is balloon method law runes more afk than astral runes?
---
Doesn't matter tho, as you won't profit in the long run
---
The door safespot always holds two people per world and you can almost always find at least one of the spots open after hopping 2-4 worlds, then you can stay in the same spot for hours because there’s no need to bank, I’d just check out a quick guide on youtube then you’re set for eons
---
Sounds rough over in Fally bruh. I grew up on the streets of east varrock, I know my street shit but I ain’t even been to anotha city.
---
Yeah the cost of using it per hour is basically fixed, but at higher range levels you just hit so much harder that you get more return. It is still worthwhile at high profit places like zulrah, vork, revs etc. But if you're planning on using it on every single combat slayer task then you're gonna be running at deficit for sure.
---
600 dry
---
Not even gonna give credit to the guy you stole this from who's post is legit one under yours.
---
Why wouldn't it? It's great if your in F2P or don't have Ava's yet.
---
Its just my oppinion idiot
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday, lost 4.5m.... lesson learned
---
How did seeing someone's drawing that they're obviously proud of hurt you so much? Just move on.
---
This is what pvmers actually think lmfao. Actually pathetic analogy.
---
Nope, he and his team are bug abusers. Check out their twitter if you don’t believe me
---
Not anymore sadly :(
---
Probably fake
---
My high school got them banned + Saturday detention if you got caught with them lol. Tbf they were annoying as hell.
---
Think he triggered you with a name..
---
Looks like my first 2k kills.
---
This dude just admitted to this, and has a post of him getting the Phoenix pet where his username is exposed. Imagine.
---

Classic
---
Less click intensive. Doesn't require an alt for best xp/hour.
---
I was in the same spot a few months back and I decided instead to do all the quests I thought I would need for slayer and I'm glad I did. Stuff like lunars/regicide/piety can go a long way and they are enjoyable quests and I think they are worth doing
---
perfect representation of osrs.
---
Sell the damn model file half these people in chat would buy thinking they’re buying the LEGO figures lol
---
LOL this is what happened to me theres no point appealing cause it will never go through
---
if u were a 1 def melee pure (and assuming u don't fight any mages), would there be any difference in having no armor vs full iron + black dhide chaps + fire cape in a pvp fight?
---
No an arument
---
It's possible to type in all caps but it's a trick not many people know about.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
FIRMLY grasp it.
---
Except for the time some guy got smacked, then silently unbanned a week later.
---
I would say block out iron/steel drags ASAP
---
Legally is a civil issue to sell or buy gp, as they violate the ToS. Nobody is going away in handcuffs for it. Either way this just reinforces my point, you can assign value to gp,  people do ti constantly, both through bonds and thrpugh third party websites.
---
I agree, but if the flame square goes against a wall, you can run to the 1 tile that doesn't have flames and you won't take dmg
---
wow nice idea op very original and cool
---
No I got the point, you said he was incapable of doing so, which is why his son created it.
---
My point is you have not considered that it was a decision, rather than a lack of capability to do so.
---
But you're right, why wouldnt a guy like Mat K want an open platform of communication with sweaty nerds who are obviously thoughtful and kind people
---
Yes CoX... sorry i didnt see this response.
---
But you can also look into becomming part of like a barb aussalt clan... if you do it efficiently you earn around 5-6m hour.
---
Isn't it too late if you can hear the sound?
---
Yeee the game is doing great! Theres so much info on the game so starting from scratch you can pretty much make the perfect account for what you enjoy doing in game. (Make a pking account 😀)
---
You can still do the arceuus library method to train RC without needing essence. Just not as great without being able to use imp boxes.
---
Sounds about right, at least the hp part, unsure about str part, so cant confirm that
---
Well first I would think that anyone who plays osrs (not casual kids) would know something about technology. Secondly he was a Mod which like I feel like means he would have been even better with tech... discord is the most basic program ever. It takes more to play osrs then it does to do anything and everything on discord... that’s all I’m saying
---
I knocked DS2 out a few weeks ago, actually! I thoroughly loved it, though. I felt like a kid playing RuneScape again, it was awesome going through that entire quest.
---
Missing the last orb is your own fault. No reason u can’t grab all 3 without them bubbling up. When u are trapped in the flames by a wall u have to move to the exit square and u won’t get hit. Also if u have 99 range and rigor then u don’t even need to absorb the bubble shit. U can just out dps it. Just cuz u don’t know how to do a boss doesn’t mean it needs a rework.
---
You mean like a dwarf quest finale involving the group known as the RED AXE?
---
that was quite recently updated
---
I'm more of a team shirts no shorts kinda guy sorry
---
I hop immediately when anyone shows up period. Even if they leave. Cause when they come w/ the clan I dont wanna be there
---
I don't care that creators want to make money anyone does. But I think it's annoying when they start the video then be like "bUT fIrST LisTeN tO mY SponSerShIp guYS''. Even worse with pewdiepie videos where in the middle of the video he randomly starts promoting dumb merch. Just keep it nice and easy at the straight start or at the end. Like Ironside.
---
A minigame involving pets would be cool, but only so long as it allows you to use cats just as effectively, because
---
1. makes it accessible obviously, but more importantly
---
2. gives even more opportunities to dab on the no-pets
---
A queen's gotta eat
---
Corp pet + any boss pet is basically a buyable pet.. you cant get that shit with a fishing rod, it requires items and stats and often quests + the cost of supplies used..
---
...t
---
osrs has been infiltrated by TRUMP VOTERS I think I’m gonna poo omg :( FUCK
---
ffs this happened to me years ago lol
---
Only for the ranged attack. The mage attack has a sound before the attack is launched, while the ranged attack has a sound that plays at the same time as the attack launching, at which point it is too late.
---
Honestly I quested from lv 3 and have barrow gloves at 63 ish combat. I'd suggest following a barrow glove guide quest list in order and you can pretty easily get a quest cape starting at level 3 aside from combat reqs in quests. If you plan it right you can get like 200qp without training combat outside from quests.
---
shut up retard
---
Btw back then d chain was bis. We were all noobs haha. I remember people flexing the red and blue castle wars armour in f2p back in the day. Said it was dragon. I was so envious
---
only if they also add the ability for cats to eat it
---
Okay, but Jagex does not endorse it at all in order to protect them in court. If people break the TOS, then they are at fault not Jagex. 
---
Your point makes no sense, you can literally assign value to anything in life if you think about it like that. Your poop could have value if someone wanted to buy it.
---
Here for the smackdown
---
fuck yeah so glad we get a first episode that quick!
---
*bwana
---
just don't collect orbs that have grown
---
the prison attack is always escapable; the tile that should've been exit is safe to stand on even if it's against the wall
---
and loot feels kinda same order of magnitude as gargoyles (since they lowered the health of guardians and they're faster to kill now). I mean it's still kinda bad compared to vorkath, but I'm sick of it, and sometimes I'd rather kill something I enjoy, even if it's worse off financially
---
My friend and I had this exact same discussion. Imo, I really dont think rc is a buyable skill. Sure you can buy the essence, but the act of turning the essence into runes is super grindy and click intensive.
---
Asking because I didnt know if any of that is dead content
---
Except the reward isn't actually high for most activities. Rev caves, black chins, and the pray altar are about the only places with actual "high reward." Things like clues, wildy resource area, all the bosses, etc. are pretty mediocre reward.
---
Its because u r on runelite. Runelite sucks.
---
He still got better loot than BO EH did during the first completion lmao.
---
Honestly don't get why people complain about this, anything you'd like to do in the wilderness you can do with minimal risk. Only ones allowed to complain are HCIM/UIM accounts because they're fucked if they die but then again they chose that game mode. 
---
1.  Only bring 3 valuable items
---
2.  Turn player attack options to hidden
---
If you die, well rip you lost a few monkfish. Go vote no to all PvP polls.
---

Is my beginner clue broke? This is the right place according to the wiki but nothing happens. Runelite doesn't even recognise the clue!

What are your requirements?

yeah i was lol
---
They're always watching and listening...
---
I did around 100 kills with it when I was grinding Vorkath. I found it made no difference.
---
It should be the opposite of everything you just said. I think BIS end game weapons should be locked behind high requirements or untradable if anything rather than just buyable.
---
I do use b gloves  + full justi + fury+ dfs
---
Yeah but not if you pay the people to also bring the essence to the altar for you like most people do.
---
Jagex's TOS states that gold has NO value. You can use gold to buy bonds, which do have inherent value, however this merely only implies gold has value. 
---
To take someone to court over this, Jagex would have to justify any implication of value, and then get a court to agree to demand damages. 
---
This is essentially impossible, as their own TOS directly disputes the idea of GP having real value.
---
No they don’t go down anymore there’s nothing to lock
---
Its the same basic concept though, you buy a mat that needs to be used on an in-world item to make it finished and turn a profit (sometimes). While rc may take much longer to complete, it's still the same as cooking but with more clicks, like you said
---
I caught 12k karambwan a while back (~87 fishing at the time) and I used PoH teleport in world 30 for fairy ring, and banked at castle wars with an equipped ring of dueling. 
---
My inventories were extremely fast and I didnt feel like I really had time to be AFK, I sat with a full inv a lot of the time. 
---
Anglers were slightly more AFK, but the spots can move rapidly.
---
I think infernal eels is probably the best middle ground.
---
I'm a combat lvl 27 if you wanna knock some quest out lmk. I would be down.
---
You panicked and dumped as to try and cut your losses. You need to be patient, and learn to that urge.
---
i have 0 zenytes in 1300 kills, but like 4 springs and frames
---
Greatest scene in film. Don't @ me

Because it's too powerful. You need the air flow to keep the genitals cool.

I think fer globes will make u eat more- if u eat means u loss ticks

That could be fixed by making lending items seperate from trading. Of course, you could still ask for money by lending and trading afterwards, or the other way around, but what sane person would do that?
---
Keep it at 100. Why purposely throw away 30% of the profit you make?
---
I think it was Mory hards lol. Already got graceful a while ago. My current long term goals are Base 70 and quest cape, but I was particularly eager for 70 agility haha
---
That was a fantastic edit. Literally all the frustration of trying to glaze over min requirements.
---
LOLOLOLOL
---
Sure, whenever, whats your RSN?
---
Is the there a general recommended boss/raid progression? Also, is CoX and ToB in the same "tier" of difficulty, and are they soloable?
---
Alright, I will check it out, I'm not trying to be 100% efficient, but at least if I go through the guide I can find some stuff to do and which quests should come before which.
---
Sorry I have seen some good looking ones. Just not him.
---
I also prefer plateskirt over platelegs because platelegs are so tight that they crushes your manhood flat.
---
Ahh yes the old "dynamite hack bombing". I'm sure they'll send some agents out to his house shortly.
---
This is slightly flawed in that end-game content would remain accessible (and is easily do-able with non-top tier items if you're experienced) so the items (ie cox/tob uniques) would remain accessible. However, for other reasons I agree that a lending system would be a negative addition to the game.
---
With the amount I traded between my friends and clan, it looks like something else is going on. 
---
I've traded over 10b in various amounts, 10m-400m, at a time over the course of 3 years. I was the primary middle man for my clan. 
---
Sometimes I'd wonder if it would trigger some detection, but I never had a single issue.
---
Dragon stones were still the easiest room, I just world hopped skill total worlds and didn't have any issues.
---
Don't forget Ratting/keyloggers
---

---
No, its like, maybe an indie game on steam. I think its a melee combat type of game, like assassins creed but much smaller scale.
---
Ahh my bad I just kinda group those in with phising links
---
Not information that isn't already obtainable.
---
Do you think that highlighted agility course obstacles is as big of an issue as actual hacking in counterstrike?
---
I thinknits pretty cool being able to tell the difference between low and high effort pking accounts through their unlocked items.
---
XD
---
It counts as warm clothing thus it does exactly what you are asking for
---
lmao you first
---
"Suffering" ironic
---
only do wildy bosses during off peak hours, don't bring so much risk, learn where singles vs multi is so you can run to singles and box. once you're boxing a hobgoblin or something you can x log. but seriously if you're out in the wildy with obvious risk you're gonna get smacked it's just how the game works. You'll probably get smacked with no risk too. because players in the wilderness are either there to pk or to be pked.
---
Sorry for your loss my friend. How much did you lose?
---
Yeah thats a pencil!
---
Blizzard support is known to be one of the best in gaming communities. Why are they exactly trash?

Or you’re a hcim and have to charge 8 rings of wealth at fountain of rune to make an ornate jewelry box for some reason. Not terribly hard to do, but still not something you’d initially think required deep wildy.

Im the friend who lent the tbow. Neither me nor my friend's alt got banned after the trade. What's the point of getting banned for RWT on certain account if the "seller" doesn't also get banned . Anyway, now I'm afraid of being "under surveillance" by some kind of weird RWT-bot considering I just traded a tbow for some account that got banned for RWTing. I guess I can only do ffa raids from now on.
---
have you considered winning your stakes instead?
---
1.  more gp/hr to melee (Assuming banking bones, etc). Faster kills. Ranging is more afk, and you can literally never bank if you don't want to. 
---
2. Easy quests for early levels: waterfall, grand tree thru mm, etc.  IMO - grind out the stats then do the slayer. IE fund it and get the dwarf cannon quest for range xp. do the void route or arma depending on your range lvl. 
---
3. I would get decent melee stats so you can do the tasks easier. I would bring a cannon and cannon everything for fastest xp. IMO get your combat up first before beginning slayer. i would use either vannaka or nieve depending on your stats. 
---
4. if you ever want to do more than being a wyvern alt, bgloves are nice. If not, then just use either void gloves or black vambs.
---
Me too dude.
---
!remindme
---
Hey that reddit post you linked is my old reddit account :P
---
Minor disclaimer: void has been nerfed since I did that analysis, but regardless it is still better at 99 range than using armadyl. You can use Bitterkoekje’s calculator these days for gear comparisons to see what it’s like at lower levels.
---
I still occasionally range skeletal wyverns. They are indeed very afk and you can camp them indefinitely which is nice. If you brought enough bolts you’ll only need to bank if your inventory gets full of visages!
---
They’re pretty crowded though. I usually can’t easily get a spot unless going to a 2k total world, but an alt won’t have that luxury.
---
Im in the same boat, i have just over 1k kills and i have 1 Shard with 12 other Uniques between Frames, limbs and springs.
---
Women?
---
4k
---
I don't even remember lol tbh, was probably just a whip or something. I just remember not being willing to ever try fighting back again back it was easier to eat a spade than risk losing something.

honestly a lot of them, yeah lmao

My comment wasn’t about knowledge of “crossing that ditch”. It’s about locking PvM BIS or BIS pickaxe for skilling/raids 1 behind wilderness content. Can you make do without them, sure. But the challenge shouldn’t have to have PKers in the mix. I’m talking about the BIS items. I don’t think many skillers should care if they die while hunting black chins and like I said clues are fine, just inconvenient.
---
If you want to get into balancing it, you can get a rune crossbow from the archaeologist in the wildy or get the limbs from the non wildy variant. This isn’t the case for mage cape or dragon pick. You are forced as a PvMer to engage with PvP. Its not a surprise to get pked in the wildy, it’s just inconvienent when trying to reach our own goals while the PvPer is trying to reach their own. That’s what causes the segregation and both parties hating each other. It’s bad game design to force that interaction. PvPers should fight PvPers or do PvP content to gain access to BIS PvP equipment in my opinion. And keep PvM, PvM, not PvMP.
---
 It keeps both communities separate without fucking over one or the other. 
---
If you have to resort to killing people engaging with PvM content to get a kill, I don’t think you’re very good at PvP.
---
They only ban sellers, not buyers. Too many players buy (they released stats a awhile ago) so it would wipe out half the playerbase.
---
In my opinion, I’d say stay away from the game at this point, if you aren’t already invested.
---
Terry why the fuck are you so angry.
---
The normal argument against this is that your total levels will help you getter more valuable loot from winterthot, so you shouldn’t go straight to 99 firemaking without “playing” the rest of the game a little and bumping some other skills up. I believe the wiki has a list of the skills that affect winterthot loot
---
The counterargument is that 80-99 firemaking is a pathetic amount of supplies in the grand scheme of things and getting a 99 out of the way early (and a free obsidian skillcape) is more valuable to you than a few extra snapdragon seeds
---
I’m gonna be honest here though the 10hp thing isn’t that big of a deal, I started winterthot at mid-60’s hp and used extra tunas and wines and it wasn’t bad at all, it’s just a matter of how bad you want 99 firemaking or how bad you want better winterthot loot, don’t give the 10 hp too much thought, and don’t restrict yourself from doing things you want to do because it’s not “efficient” for a damn firemaking minigame
---
It be more productive to call out that eye sore of a cape.
---
It's a little bit of tongue-in-cheek, but mostly on top of very consistently going very far out of his way to listen to, interact with, and please the playerbase, he's also considered an exceptional quest writer by both the rs3 and the osrs community (having had a hand in writing some RS3 content) and is personally responsible for a lot of great content that we see. And I'm probably only scratching the surface.
---
In other words, yes it's kind of a circle-jerk meme, but this guy has certainly earned the praise he gets from the community.

Bro I got 6 zenytes in 370 kills
---
Wow. People were able to transmit the virus through skype?
---
Is there a guide similar to Oziris’ for slayer? Like how his guide is to efficient maxed Ironman, but rather getting your account slayer ready in the most efficient way? PVM is my favorite part of the game so I just want to do what is necessary to get me ready for it.
---
I thought I was lucky when I received one lol. That's redic lol. Nice!
---
i know sometimes it can be annoying but take a step back and look at the big picture here- do you really need wintertodt to be easier? is that a sensible course of action? i don't think it is.
---
He's a genuinely nice guy who gets stuff done. He  rarely says something is too hard and if he does, he explains why
---
If it were implemented I wonder how much xp an hour you could get using it too. Could be an interesting magic training method. Wasnt trying to hate on the idea or anything.
---
Nice account you got there my man
---
Great video
---
🦀🦀CRABS ARE POWERLESS VS DRAINS🦀🦀
---
This isn't an argument. This is just contradiction. Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the automatic naysaying of anything the other person says.
---
And what you gonna be doing at gwd with those setups lul
---
I'm friends with Dapper Dharok in game as well lol. Pretty crazy seeing that name in the drawing lol.
---
You can use DeliverItems cc for this in the future
---
The suggestion I found was about once a week just up the favor, since royal trouble significantly reduces the decay rate.
---
That would be literally idiotic lol.
---
It would be better if the dwarves dropped some kind of technological advancement. Perhaps a cannon of some sort, that's small enough to fit in your hands.
---
Im about half way through my impling jars. I have done 150 clues and i've only had 1 casket worth over 100k.
---
You typed your sign in email (not the registered email) into haveibeen owned? Or weleakinfo?
---
Seems something got breached. Also have you checked your recent login activity on the registered email (Gmail allows you to view recent IP/devices)
---
What prevents the bot client from calling itself RuneLite? All information that the server knows about the client comes from the client itself. Jagex would have to add some kind of DRM to the client to make it difficult for botters to modify, but it's probably even harder than just banning bots normally.
---
You do in large swathes of America
---
Yeah the Venezuelan farmer hysteria had begun around only 2 years ago. Before that there were plenty of bots, as well as Chinese farmers.
---
Pretty sure the occult necklace is just better than that set effect.

---
How does it "fuck the economy"? Sure it devalues skilling as a source of resources, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is any negative consequences in the long term.
---
I'm just sad that d pick is hard af to get on my iron
---
I think '07 reddit' was good, 'osrs fb' is popular too. Dunno many others
---
Definitely not. It's a phish.
---
I didn't mention anything about a phone number. I don't think the right way to go about it is to limit accounts. It's a very hard situation they're in where they're trying to deal with bots, but have to value real players experience more then trying to put a heavy anti-bot system in place that annoys/falsely bans people
---
Easy solution: grind hard clues to get the full set and free up the inventory space.
---
You’re kidding right?
---
Do you how little value GP has when alchables flood the game?? Do you see just how worthless resources are now?
---
I don't know if that would be so hard, they could just ban 3rd party clients and work with RuneLite to add some features.
---
I mean, even most video games you can't play online if you haven't bought it.
---
Draw the bloodhound pet
---
The problem is when I went to click on her to hand over my ID she logged and her unskulled friend appeared under her.
---
Check out cell phone privacy screens on Amazon, fellow workscaper
---
It also technically has more magic defense(it's +0 vs -4)
---
Get quest cape and slayer
---
&gt; I'm mad cause I'm bad and I don't have enough confidence in myself or my abilities to try to learn something that I'm unfamiliar with.
---
Just make a pure alt and spend mils dying not learning much each death, among mechanics that can freeze you in place, teleblock you, while a clan piles on in multi
---
I'm not opposed to learning but I feel like the only thing I'm losing out on is an incredibly obscure looking pvp system I'll stack L's in and lose hours of progres with against people who unironically finds runescape pvp interesting and have been with it for years
---
I like doing PVP in a lot of other games, runescape is just the one I've never really felt it with due to how bullshit and weird it seems. I've watched probably 6 hours on and off with various streams and barely learn anything from just watching.
---
&gt;You don't even have to fight back. You can just try escaping and eating food.
---
"Then fight back, you invertebrate." is what I was responding to
---
It's a very 4Head thing to tell people unfamiliar with PVP.
---
For real. Unironically tell me PVP is learnable to a "you lose only 50% of the time" level in even under a month in the current climate.
---
Know anyone in either of these chats? Probably more the reddit one, since I frequent the site. xD I wish you could just join via the chat name ,not a player.
---
You are right. Neckbeards can’t handle the truth.
---
Looks like a Dungeness crab claw
---
Yah!  Only we can use that word
---
You can't? You sure?
---
When does it expire? Can I do it on a phone? Won’t be able to get on a computer tonight and haven’t played in a while.
---
Oh hey I got mine a bit ago last week.
---
Yeah lol, I was wondering what you thought the stronghold had to do with anything. Where’d you think you got em haha
---
i personally dont mind getting jumped in wild, i dont bring risk so it doesnt affect me personally, just a loss of like 2 minutes
---
Wel all know how this goes... see you back on in 4 days.
---
Whatever seems fun
---
what’s your TTL? and yeah you’ll get there.
---
Its easily possible. Just runecraft lol. You may not get the best possible rates buts its possible. There are level 3 f2p ironmen that got 70 and up RC only using air runes lol
---
How??????
---
IF you win, your pet gets 10% bigger.

---
25% chance to increase damage by 30% would be worse than just the flat 10% boost that Occult gives. So hnkess you're an Ironman and don't have access to occult at your Slayer level, I'm not sure why this would be used.
---
This
---
Also Brazilian. It’s always someone else. Certainly never a farmer from the US/Canada/Australia/West Europe. Definitely always someone from a country we don’t like. How coincidental.
---
#How many pencils and magnets do i have to take photos of to get silver?
---
Look at the 2nd post under hot
---
Zeah library, zmi (the long path), lava runes, soul and blood runes
---
Men’t
---
Trees, ammirite?
---
No it is not legit
---
Not really an official guide that I know of, but you should have piety and all the main untradables before starting slayer ideally. Unlock superiors first and make sure you get a good block list for duradel
---
When I click "Join Chat" it brings up in the chat box to type in the player whose chat you wish to join, I see no other way to join a clan. Unless I'm missing it, which is entirely possible.

/r/fakecutenoobs

rune crossbow but no dragon bolts?
---
For the love of god I need friends plz add me: EpicFart7
---
So torso, void, defenders and anything else?
---
Got my second one at 1900\~, then finished all four at 2000. At least you get lots of cash from this
