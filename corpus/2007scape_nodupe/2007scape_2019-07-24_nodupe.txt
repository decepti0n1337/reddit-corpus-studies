When ur 10 years old playing f2p and fishing lobsters on karamja

---
Hopefully this means a video will come soon.
---
Oh dear, what do I do :[]
---
If Warding fails I'd like them to try either the Foraging skill suggestion.

---
Or if possible it would be cool with a stealth skill, sneaking around, could be tied with Thieving and Agility since neither of those have much to do with actual stealth.
---
Dude, do you not know how Reddit works? Use reply, don't make a new comment lol. But ya, comment's gone, looks like you deleted it.
---
Lol "your comment ended the conversation"
---
When I replied to
---
"There isn't enough word space to insult you"
---
As if I'm the one who supposedly "ended" the conversation lmao. Maybe you can grow up a little bit and talk about (and I can't stress this enough) *a game*, without having a flame war.
---
all of them man.

I've seen like 2 poll questions that got under 50% since I started playing osrs, one of which was about mtx. Like half the playerbase just votes yes to literally everything
---
Never
---
Never had a post more true than this
---
Was walking around the wizards South of Falador one day and found a santa hat. Don't know why they were fighting the wizards with no food.
---
I‚Äôd assume both of those would make the market go way up for whatever items are needed to finish those. Warding materials have already gone up just in case, so I guess the crash would be selling them off if warding fails.
---
I really like it, but I wonder how it'd look if the purple was a shade darker.
---
I thought it was thursday
---
reverse psych, they want you to say yes
---
Pure pking isnt about accuracy its about k0 potential with max hits. Getting attack just lowers ur k0 potential. Its like saying get 60 attack on ur gmauler to make training faster
---
I see no difference between a cooking cape and an obby cape.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be spawning my magnum dong for the THICC-ness.
---
I just want advise, what do I do üòÇ
---
A couple of people have asked this already, but if Warding doesn't pass, will there be another survey on whether the idea or concept of warding can be put into other skill areas?
---
Duradel pet
---
So I‚Äôm not the best person to ask but here I go...
---
In a nutshell warding, a possible new skill,  May or may not be coming out tomorrow (you still have time to cast your votes, in game) 
---
That skill is going to be like smithing for magic gear. 
---
That being said plenty of expensive in game gear will drop as people can and will make their own in the process of leveling their new skill. 
---
Me not understanding fully how big changes like this affect the economy of the game made me scared my money will devalue...
---
From all the responses so far it seems I had it backwards, bht again it may not even happen.
---
You can try for the +5 from stews but I'd HIGHLY recommend getting 72 instead given how rare a +5 is in comparison.
---
Oh right the nvm mb.
---
hoes mad
---
Thought baby moles were pink
---
Also its OP
---
In the time it took you to type that you could've googled a time converter
---
damn man that sucks that you had those 99s, but unfortunately they probably wont or cant because it is 2 different games with some people who play both on the same account. Starting all over is a pain but I feel like you'll fall in love with the game again if you havent played since before 2010. I definitely did, but it was easier for me since i never had one 'main' acc and was accountless when osrs came out
---
He
---
Man, that shit was a literal nightmare. That mount was so fucking cool though. Well worth it.
---
DS2 is a really good quest, and I hate questing.
---
Mm2 on the other hand, good luck with that shit.
---
He has no grace
---
Would love to see you 1 tick a 6 way into a barrage if it's so easy bud
---
Blast furnace pump for some of the str exp( hp less exp), get 60 strength and eventually 55 slayer. Then u keep training str or pking
---
Start working on those barrows gloves my man, stats looking good. Qp is a big hurdle
---
I mean you doing a money maker that's like 300k/hr doesn't make it good
---
r/2me4meirl
---
Pretty sure crystal saw works and u can boost from 87 =)
---
I knew the value of mine. 25m, bought me a whip and d chain with it lol.
---
I am very impressed. How many stamina potions did it take to get that far
---
The wildy
---
You're saying ironmen use tent whips for slayer to be fair?
---
That‚Äôs a damn shame. Was through all the shit of when they turned off the wild and created clan wars n shit. I remember they had like a daily spin with a goblin in the middle. I was like ‚Äúwtf is this BS‚Äù a week later they updated the game and didn‚Äôt touch it for years. Haven‚Äôt even tried to hop on RS3. I just now created a acc that‚Äôs lvl 3 but I have lvl 40 fishing, mining, and woodcutting. I always loved grinding those non combat skills and wish there was a way I could use my old acc that I spend so much time on
---
Doesn't sound very in depth though.

Move those goalposts a bit more, clicking a single spot isn't hard in any way.
---
Plot twist: Steve is just Nieve after converting. She faked her own death to live the life she's always wanted.
---
It's a meme poking fun at people who overly censor stuff, who now in turn censor random shit to play along.
---
I for one collect all the untradeable breads she gives you. Maze random is actually decent money, especially for low levels.
---
It would be nice to have a toggle to turn them off for people like yourself who dont want them though.
---
Why is this gilded? ü§¢ü§Æ
---
upwards of 180 QP, and every quest i've done was with this man. Legend
---
I like how you think ahead by having a backup plan! 
---
Now if Warding fails the ballot, now we have a backup skill that pleases the normies, gets money for Jagex without partnerships, and... most importantly, a way to suck GentleTractor's cock for internet points once again! 
---
I love you guys so much.
---
You mean like the stale baguette?
---
I should have definitely said why in that comment it was prob deserved, but it is interesting to see how it‚Äôs faked isn‚Äôt it?
---
Darkscape was flawed but so great I miss it too.
---
I'm saying that ironmen use the dragon lance for stab damage when doing slayer. Dragon lance is upgraded by a better defender if you're not using a dfs. Yes, on boss slayer tasks people use tent whip.
---
I mean I agree it's against the rules and shouldn't be tolerated, but telling them to just work to fix their country is naive. Have you seen what is going on on the streets? Despite the government having tanks and everything, these people are demonstrating and what else. "Just throwing over the government" is difficult when you're dead because you starved btw.
---
If you want pet do solos. Solo = more points, more loot. W9 = more exp. Because of the exp drop when the game ends.
---
Nice lol. Congrats man!
---
Foraging sounds pretty alright, it reminds me of herbalism in WoW, It would compliment herblore pretty well, could be used for cooking, maybe crafting. I'm not sure what kind of items would be valuable with this skill, I didn't really know for hunter either; hunter brought us exploding hamsters for range training, which nobody could have expected, maybe foraging could have an item just as unique.
---
Stealth would require a complete overhaul of how combat and poking works, and otherwise would only be useful for avoiding hostile monsters, it'd be a lot harder to implement than foraging.
---
Ive always thought the snakeskin looked way better than d hide
---
I was only considering the examples you gave. Yeah the bones seems OP.
---
Why are they all ticked tho
---
Just got that one lmao
---
Ayyy shoutouts to Boise.
---
But fuck r/boise
---
Technically they could manually set your stats if your rs3 account isn't banned, but there's no chance in hell they would do it.
---
Nah. If it was possible/they wanted to do it, they already would have. Sorry man!
---
Lost 2k red chins the other day.
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
Eh, I doubt it. I didn‚Äôt start playing ironman til like a year ago and the memes been circulating quite a bit longer than that. Plus that comment was obviously a joke.
---
I think staying inside and providing for your family might be better than fighting a totalitarian regime.
---
You generally wont have perfect rotations which drops the kills/h down from the theoretical max of 120.
---
That means wrong and a circle means correct? I assume
---
Probably, or people getting mad if it passes and selling their gear because they'll try to quit.

Its not. Thats silver.

People pick sides like cliques in prison, weeabos and suicidal people to the east while the sex (porn really, let‚Äôs be real) addicts and high level players to the west.
---
Do you mean agro them all? Will they stop healing?
---
Summoning and dungeoneering. Also artisan in a slayerlike way for skilling
---
O shit
---
You‚Äôre a gem, I‚Äôll try it out on my next task! :) thank you
---
What makes you think you wouldn't have to tick eat sot or the electricity on Verzik still? You think they just wouldn't add the electricity lol? You absolutely wouldn't be able to out-dps the healers still so you'd have to do the same method too.
---
yeah probably
---
Yes, as long as you can aggro them onto you and they're not by Jad anymore, they won't heal him.
---
Summoning and dungeoneering were less powercreep than blowpipe twisted bow scythe and alts so that‚Äôs not a great argument.
---
Tanzoo and Virtoso byfar. So much content to go through and top tier banter.
---
Dude, goddamn everything this game is a multi-hour grind, people would go crazy for content like that
---
We got hallowvale, mortyania, draynor, and the island south of lumby. If that doesnt do it for ya idk what will.
---
I noticed more BTWs and 120+ on west and ‚ÄúWEST SIDE REEEEEE‚Äù every time we had to move to the east, because let‚Äôs be honest, nobody‚Äôs healing that fucking west pyro
---
Happy b day

holy shit dude, JUST use your eyes

Public hide
---
This happened to me 2 weeks ago. Was super stoked to get a mimic on my first elite. Geared up for the fight only to find out that toggling the event on auto-completes the clue. Still salty
---
Fair enough mate :) it's refreshing to see someone healthily in control of their playing. Too often it seems to be "play till I die" or instant reaction quitting that isn't healthy either.
---
Once you can burst nechs/dust devils it‚Äôs plenty fast. Anyone can do that. Not everyone can do 70k an hour lavas, or spend 4b to have runners get them to 99.
---
Sounds about right. But d hally has slower attack speed (3 specs is 12.6 secs vs 4 whip at 9.6) so really it's 86 dmg when scaled for time (113 / 1.3). That puts it below claws and dds.
---
KBD probably your best bet
---
We‚Äôre gonna come full circle and slowly get eoc but done well lol
---
Where can I see when they announce if they released it or not? Ingame?
---

Shamone
---
Holy shit in pretty jealous not going to lie! The pet grader is one of the best gwd pets imo! Meanwhile I'm over 3k dry for hydra pet fml
---
Zulrah has several mechanics and rotations tho, Jad has 2, flicking prayers and dealing with the healers.
---
Definitely needs to be the icon. Looks so natural next to everything else
---
I'm having a bit of a hard time wrapping my head around how they'd make this work outside of having it in a minigame, or other special areas, but  maybe it could work. 
---
I like your idea, but I'm not entirely sold on the idea of it being a skill, I think it could be a great alternative to agility training though (nobody likes agility courses). Imagine being sent on stealth missions by some spymaster and getting agi experience for it, that'd be much better than courses!
---
Any suggestions for a relatively cheap gaming mouse that has mousekeys?
---
Okay, but you mathematically cannot sustain only doing nechs and dust devils, and you don't unlock smoke devils until 93, at which point you can maintain 60k/hr, which like lavas, not everyone can maintain. Up until that point it's even hard to maintain 50k/hr for an average player. Not even considering runners, RC is faster to level to 99 than slayer.
---
Dude. Asmongold the wow streamer currently getting paid to just react to shit got pretty famous off his mount offs. And for good reason. People respect overcoming challenges. Especially if the solution has a dead simple one that makes everyone else look like they're overthinking things.
---
why are you trying to kill bh?
---
The Reddit hive mind fucking hates that show
---
Nice
---
It is still pretty rare tbh
---
2 of the unique instead of the usual trash from medium is pretty rare

That twitter thread just gave me cancer. Imagine being that entitled and saying to a JMod that it's not up to them to make this perfectly valid decision in a game they work for.

I'm so glad I'm not the only one that thought this lmao.

Forgot to also mention slayer nets you tons of combat xp

Osrs came on august 2007 do you even read? Just go play rs3 if you cant play osrs. Where did i say everyone wants 2007 version? Im talking for myself and point the reason why 2007 came out and why osrs players are careful when its time to vote, to not make same bullsht of rs3.
---
is there a way to make my butler auto take money from me and not have to do the dialogue?

Summoning was a pretty controversial skill, I don't think it would ever pass.

Would you want it as is? Or do you have your own version of how it could work?

Wut

Get rid of the ardougne step, theres a ship in catherby you can charter to brimhaven
---
I‚Äôm not sure how to beat explain it, but this is basically the order of events as I remember.
---
1. Finish clue and get casket. 2. Try to open casket and get mimic warning (I wasn‚Äôt geared for a fight, so I teled out). 3. Gear up for fight and go to Watson‚Äôs house with casket in inventory. 4. Try to activate fight, get notification that I need to toggle the event on first. 5. Toggle the event on ‚Äî&gt; ‚ÄúCongratulations! You‚Äôve completed an Elite clue!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt even remember seeing the reward screen pop up.

[Suggestion] Make everything a Waterbirth Creature
---
Hahahaha this comment is so underrated.
---
you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I voted no
---
You seem like you're going to play but a good way to figure stuff out is searching the wiki or typing your question on google and adding reddit at the end. When I started I mostly focused on combat, but the quests are good because they give you skill level goals and rewards after you complete them. PM me if you have any questions
---
That's basically what I was gonna say lol
---
Doesn't feel osrs, can't be confused with some random object. I suggest making it look either more like a pizza slice or more like an open book to confuse children.
---
HAS
---
I will look into this. Thanks for the inspiration!
---
That's interesting, although I only clicked the door once when the game froze for a second. I don't like issuing more commands into the game, than necessary.
---
Reddit was in flames with the regicide/underground pass polls. I disagree with the changes as well, but they got 72%. Here we see 76% of Redditors vote yes to an unofficial Warding poll. And then people think that it won't pass? I truly think it will.
---
I find that, after the catherby fruit tree, using a crossbow and grapple to get to the Taverley tree is quicker than running from Falador.
---
The other difference for me is that at the end of my run I use the fairy ring to the Fisher King realm and blow the whistle to get to the Brimhaven fruit tree patch. Idk if that or going from Ardy is quicker.
---
Will show right when poll closes per mod ash
---
Why is there no option without Runecrafting?
---
My guess is varrock gaurd and the stray dog
---
Great! Glad you like the idea. I have plans to flesh this out a little bit more in a second post; stay tuned for that!
---
gross
---
I honestly don't think that adding warding is that big of a change, at least compared to all of the other updates we've had. it's really not that invasive to the current play style except it appears on the skill tab. This game isn't the same as it was in 2007, so we can't really say that warding will ruin it by being different.
---
I think the skill has a very oldschool feel to it, it is comparable to other skills we already have in how it's trained, and doesn't add anything incredibly gamechanging.
---
Considering the rate that skills were added in 07 and the years prior to it, the fact that osrs hasn't seen a new skill actually makes it less like the original game was during that time period, and I believe that the addition of a new skill will actually bring us closer to what the game was at that time.
---
I went on twitter to actually see the comments. I don't often do this, but I did because I heard that it usually comes with a nerd raging shitstorm. This one is no different, jesus christ. I actually feel bad having to work as a JMod for this game getting constantly harrassed by no life nerds wanting their game to be made so specifically that any new idea that disagrees with theirs, they REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE about. Poor guys (the jmods).
---
Hey thanks man! Appreciate how nice everyone seems on here.
---
por que no los dos?
---
I like this idea, and I'll keep it in mind when I revise this into its second version. Thanks very much!
---
If you havent seen any anti warding posts at the top you havent been paying any attention
---
I'm sure all of these things are possible, but there's probably more specific communities that will be able to give you advice, like other subreddits or maybe discord channels.
---
You got my vote.
---
It‚Äôs always been like that though. Even easyscape hasn‚Äôt made tiered quest capes yet. Although they are making tiered completionist which I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with because the point is that you‚Äôve essentially ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù the game so why go and make tiers when the lower tier obviously hasn‚Äôt completed everything.
---
*pro gamer move
---
racist cops smh
---
I voted no because the skill sounds like a flaming pile of shit
---
Also, any tips for what I should focus on leveling up would be great. Currently I‚Äôm afk training fishing during the days and have just completed my quest grind to finish RFD. It would be good to do some money making and progress levels a bit further for a bit.
---
reading those comments made me hurt. Some people obsess over this game way too much, and jmods having to deal with bombardment of NEETs and other no-lifers must be stressful knowing you're going to work and some dude who's probably barely worked a day in his life is telling you how to do your job. Shit sucks.
---
Ofc its good progress. Ur like 1/100,000. Aka 99,999 wouldnt have been this far
---
Congratulations! More dedicated than I am, that's for sure.
---
NO
---
Do a couple quests for farming xp and then get on those farm runs every 1.5 hours
---
Basilisk and those crazy bird things.
---
And then get another 50k lamp lol
---
Might aswell just use divination icon tbh
---
damn, you earned that shit. I've been going between barrows and eclectics/mediums for masters so far..
---
Yeah but you save like 4 slots so i thought maybe because of that you could 2 trips or maybe 3.
---
I would definitely love a new skill aswell, I would just like it to have an unique way of training it.
---
Which mod designed that THICC beast?
---
Then we start the cooking grind
---
Only did solo rex when I tried kings, definitely going for all three next time
---
NECK
---
wew, lad
---
Cool, I'd love to see more stuff like that. Some new rare fashionscape would be great.
---
Nah. I do 3-4 kills a trip with ahrims and dhide
---
If you use a bond on me I'll send u proof of me voting no, I'd what warding even is but I'm out of membership
---
yes, they look like shit and they're op
---
How dare you assume my species! I‚Äôll have you know that I‚Äôm actually a dragonkin canine anthromorph and I don‚Äôt appreciate you saying that being a sad weeb makes me human!

Gonna try this, thanks!.
---
It should be illegal, but hey, you gotta find new and exciting ways to extort money out of people to increase the police brutality budget!
---
Git gud.
---
Lol dont be embarrassed  to play osrs. There isnt a incongito mode. Youd have to delete the friend then add them back when you aint on osrs
---
because people who dont have an opinion either way will and havent read blogs etc tend to vote with the majority
---
Short answer, yes.
---
Yeah I agree with most of your points and solutions 
---
1) I agree risk is too low in general in wildy and pvp, untradables are pretty lame for multiple reasons. They increase the barrier to entry because in order to make a pvp account you have to grind for those untradables, be it void/rfd gloves/torso etc and they make people not have to risk as much because they just drop coins. Having to make a new account to pvp is already a huge barrier. 
---
2)elo could work but I could see people elo boosting kills. So it would have to have some counter measures. Like killing the same person in a row doesn't count or you elo doesn't go up as much from beating much lower elo people (that's probably implied though).
---
3)I think having a low elo should force you on the +1, good pkers that win a lot would end up in the non+1 world. I think the high risk world should be locked until you are really high elo to make it more interesting. So low elo = +1 world only. Medium elo = normal world only. High elo = normal world + high risk world. we might not need to separate the worlds like that, maybe just create areas within the world. It would also be kind of awkward for people that hover between low and medium elo since they have to change worlds all the time.
---
4) I feel like people would just hop and pool in their house still and just slow down fighting, idk what the best idea is but you could also try making it so you have to be in combat with someone for a certain amount of time/deal a certain amount of damage (50? 100?) to them before you are able to use a special attack and then after you spec you can't teleport out for an even longer amount of time than it is now, if you kill them then you can teleport though. That would eliminate rushers out of the game basically, not sure how it would change the dynamic for actual fights though. I think it would be more interesting personally.
---
5) yep highscores = good but they can't even update the item of the day, it's been zulrah scales forever. We have wanted boss kc highscores forever too. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think your formula idea for the loot is nice too, but idk what the intended order of operations was because of the formatting and usually ELO systems are based on starting at \~1200 and it maxes out at like 2800 (well not really max, but in chess only 3 people have elo over 2800) So keep that in mind for the calculations. I think an elo system in osrs should draw heavily from chess for the best results. There's a lot of math that goes into it and im not that knowledgeable on that topic.
---
First one to take a priff and post on reddit wins!

That‚Äôs a glitch with osbuddy, it counts it even though it doesn‚Äôt actually count. Look into how barrows works, and don‚Äôt get all defensive. I‚Äôm not doubting the counter on screen went up, it does, it‚Äôs just wrong
---
Elder rune armour cost more than superior fremmy and its tank armour too.
---
Yup, but unlike other Classic content, they did not transition well to RS2.

Damn eh

Go to Hans and check your play time. I'm curious :p

Is it actually quite profitable or just to keep food and rent paid?

Any diff than revs atm? And when i say a single part of multi, i should elaborate and say like 3 tiles. Like a choke point of sorts.

Navigating the wilderness effectively with priper protection would be as crucial knowledge as the mechanics of the bosses inside.

yeah im up to 29 fletching in just 8 kills.

Yea pretty much. Just have a glimmer of hope lol
---
71.28% yes
---
Look it up. You can hit 120/99 str
---
73.15% yes.
---
The fact that a redditor can pull this off correctly, but a team of game designers cannot issa big yikes. 
---
Love the designs man, they all look hella crisp!
---
Haha the xp you get isn't based on chance dumb goblin bitch
---
They're not even the bad ones. They, for the most part, actually play the game. They might have like 10 alts going but they're usually not botting. The bad ones are bot farms and they're not usually vennies from what I've seen
---
65.45% yes vote
---
Tired of this bullshit narrative of warding is stupid, sailing would pass today. Complete BS it wouldn‚Äôt even get 50% and makes no sense
---
My dude, fuck this cave.
---
Dude u need 70 rc hurry up
---
So you don't mind that the majority of the skill was made by Mod West, but the symbol was too far?
---
Elder rune's price is overinflated still as they started it at a crazy high price, it's real value is around 150k (alch price). I've got no idea how tank armor vs power armor compares in pvp though, so I won't argue there.
---
i mean whats the gp per hour for like a lvl 80 getting killed every 15 minutes? doubt its higher than green drags
---
Well it doesn't have to be a pure, just a PvP specific build but yea. IMO pures are the most fun to PK on, but zerkers/voiders are good too. If they're actually going to do this gmaul nerf I'd go 60attack for sure.
---
Ok, thanks!.
---
what exactly is a private server, how is it different than vanilla osrs
---
It isn't much different. However, OSB had left click bones before we existed, and OSB was allowed before we existed, and so, we have it too. That's why it is different. I prefer to not break XP rates if I can help it, and so I thought I'd leave out the one click blackjacking. Obviously not everyone agrees.

Queen summons 1 king at a time, which attacks on separate ticks as her. Making it soloable if youre good, but you must dps each king down right away. Because when she summons another king, both kings attack on the same tick as eachother. Regardless of manipulation attempts. By summon i mean she calls for 1 at a time, and they come out of the water or something similar. Not just *poof*

It counts even on vanilla client. Its not a bug/glitch. ANYTHING killed in tunnels accumulates points.

Not sure, yesterday everyone was saying tomorrow but I'm not UK so jagex's dates are always a little ambiguous for me. I thought maybe it'd be after the last game clock reset 2 hours ago, that's why I'm browsing newest rn.

RuneScape was basically the first idle game in the genre. If i spend 6 hours a day playing RS, watching YT, netflix, reading facebook/reddit all at the same time, is that the same as 6 hours of train model building?

Moving goalpost - "Demanding from an opponent that he or she address more and more points after the initial counter-argument has been satisfied refusing to concede or accept the opponent‚Äôs argument."
---
IE, you were proven wrong on something and demand to be proven wrong on something else instead. You original said that the interface 'can't' suck becuase it's fully customizable. Without acknowledging that you were wrong on that point, you proceeded to ask 'what it was lacking'. And then you changed that to 'what is wrong with it'. 
---
"I asked what's bad about it twice"
---
You haven't asked at all actually, this is the second time you 'claimed to have asked though. 
---
"You didn't answer..."
---
I didn't answer the question 'what does the RS3 interface lack', because that question was moving the goalpost. 'You are right that customizable interfaces can be bad...' &lt;- essentially, your post is missing that. It makes it pointless for me to prove you wrong on the next thing, as you will again not acknowledge it, and simply move the goalpost.
---
You also made assertive questions instead of a claim. Which is the same concept as moving goalpost. If I answer your question in a way that proves what you were implying wrong, you don't acknowledge that you implied it. 
---
"...now you're doing this."
---
And you are still doing the same thing. Not acknowledging when you are wrong, and shifting the goalpost yet again.
---
So that‚Äôs where my pieces went. 0 in 20.

I want warding.

To answer your question- yes as long as the thing you‚Äôre building needs a saw. Spicy stew is visible +5 boost and saw is invisible +3 when used. So for things like ornate pools you get +8 max, but since things like fairy rings don‚Äôt use a saw, the max is just +5 from the stew

Because the majority of voters are people who play the game like one hour on a weekend. When they see something being polled that makes the game easier they'll vote for it regardless of whether or not they ever actually make it to that content before moving on to an other game.

Yeah blowpipe is good for killing them, but the range is abysmal for actually hitting them. You end up accidentally luring yourself into jad trying to attack the healers with blowpipe. I usually bring crystal bow entirely for aggroing the healers.
---
Use ahk to remap them to keys you can hit

you don't focus on the bots. There's no fucking way they can't keep logs of player interraction.

Start deleting the people buying gold and what not.

There's no fucking way they aren't interconnected at some point when you can identify them instantly on every single world. Then just do down the line.

everyone who completed an elite or master after the update got the message. you had to enable mimics b4 you're able to get one.

My tips:

Range pot the wave before

Blowpipe with dragon darts (unload and load the wave before)

Fully restore as the last mager dies

Then just pray range every time and only swap to mage when needed and immediately go back to range

Also I used npc indicators to identify and tag the healers

Because osrs doesn't only have the 2007 version of the game, which is what you seem to want.  There's venom with blowpipe/serp helm, there's tridents, justiciar, scythe, tbow, bulwark, ancestral, dragon claws, kodai wand, avernic defender, inferno cape, elite void, diaries, zeah, fossil island, black chins, new MM tunnels for chinning, new slayer bosses with MANY completely new drops (occult necklace, prims/eternals/pegs, kraken tentacle, ferocious gloves), zenyte jewelry, corp, GWD, new quests, plus a ton of other new content that didn't exist in august of 2007.

When you can no longer support your hobby through healthy methods. Ie you begin to sacrifice things lower on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Ie, you lose sleep or miss meals to the point where your health deteriorates markedly from your base or you begin to make irrational decisions, such as quitting your job, that give short term gains at the loss of longterm growth and security.

they were going to add new islands for treasure hunting / pvm that you'd sail to I believe. Something similar to ports I think.

Jagex gains nothing by mass-going after bots. The people complaining about them will continue playing, and the limited people quitting in F2P because of it probably aren't going to be a long-term retain any way.

i know with mac u can make u number keys act as FN keys, dont know about windows though

If you really went at it you could make about $300 a month maybe, but that‚Äôs being generous. It‚Äôs only worth it to Venezuelans because their currency is almost literally worthless, so a couple hundred usd goes a long way to helping them get food and such. Plus the more people that do it, the less each million is going to be worth, so prices will really only go down. You could work 10 hours a week at minimum wage and make as much or more.
---
Try not to bust

I saw a good amount of support for partnerships, also I imagine most of the 30% were players disconnected from RS social media and just voted because the skins sounded cool.

I voted yes but funny regardless. fuck the triggered nerds

Literally nothing cute noob about this. He could be an ironman.
---
Well, if it passes, there's a new skill coming out soon. So you can look forward to that
---
The healers' HP could just scale down. Not a very difficult change. 
---
Only really big change would be the sotetseg maze, maybe from the top of my head make the correct path flash every x ticks, so you have to memorize like 1/3 of it each time to get past it quick enough.
---
For the red bomb at sotetseg, they could just add some randomly spawning "dispersion" tiles and the player needs to go to the spot with as many of them as possible to recude damage taken. Or make the player drop pet rocks around him, :D
---
You can buy members and vote no for the new skill

Ye same really want to know whi is the dryest atm (well not me) and who is the record holder

Also do you turael skip for tasks?

Because it feels good.

you didnt get a mimic, you got the warning to toggle on the mimic chance.

its off by default and the wording is really similar to "you got a mimic"

you might need to work on your reading skills. they are not congratulating the first player to complete the quest because mod wolf wants everyone to read the dialogue. if you can't complete the quest without reading the dialogue, why would that be necessary?

I get that reading is hard, but so is writing so maybe think before you speak.

6 hours a day doesn't = 6 hours straight... Plus with mobile it's stupidly easy to get 6 hours of game time while doing mundane everyday things, and if it's only a few clicks a minute on your phone why not.
---
Also note i was running through the first monkey madness quest on my new hcim last night (I'm not bad at the game, rural internet is bad, i swear) while working on the laptop lol. I was even giving my opinion on reddit, helping someone else with the same model laptop as mine, at the same time haha. Sure i wasn't doing all of those tasks at 100% efficiency but i did MM in probably under an hour 20. 
---
My point is, the very mechanics the game is based on allow you to do other things very easily. And if you're somewhat decent at time management and prioritization (which i believe the majority are, it's only the select few who lack this ability IRL and find themselves addicted to various things) RS is easily a hobby you can sink multiple hours into a day - without it having a great negative effect on your life as a whole.
---
It's not directly comparable to other hobbies, it's a modern hobby and requires modern thinking and values.
---
A little off-topic, but I've been interested in taking up miniatures (mostly medieval themed ones) as a thing to accompany RS, so I've given this particular topic a bit of thought.
---
Blue or green lamp
---
Sounds like you're moving closer to other chunks and the game is lagging while it loads them.
---
Been having that issue for over a month also. They said it was fixed but it‚Äôs not :/
---
Did someone say lower the better?
---
I think that's more of a comment on how little resources videogames take in comparison to other hobbies rather than thier level of addictiveness. I've seen some model sets that absolutely required addiction levels of income and time investment but it takes a remarkably long time for powdered grass to dry evenly and you can't just watch glue dry for two hours after you've assembled everything.
---
With RuneScape there's literally always something more to do. Even if you max there's always one more drop or starting an ironman. Even if you do max, content comes out at a regular enough pace to peak your interest and keep you defending your max/quest/completionist/song cape. At end of the day, each module in most model trains take a week to set up at most with additional miniature tweaks that have long paint/glue drying times.
---
You can buy members and vote Yes to the new skill
---
Anime eyes though.
---
The dev team was really new when they polled sailing. Nmz was the first major update, and it was so broken and poorly done. The assets are all reused, and it was the best for magic training and 6 hour afking as well.
---
If you were playing at the time, you would know that the team should not have been trusted with developing a skill if they couldn't pull off a simple minigame.
---
They have and they do... 
---
example: You are in wildy in single combat and some guy is chasing you. So you run and run and find some low level aggressive monster and hope one attacks you. Now the pker waits for you to kill the monster so You take your weapon off (or equip flowers which have negative attack bonus) and hit X on your client and you will log out within 60 seconds.

I voted yes after the content creator said that but I legitimately want the skill. I remember when Slayer and Farming came out and those were highlights of my childhood. Hanging out with friends in middle school grinding out the new skill until 5 am is a fond memory of mine.
---
Today if it gets released it will be me sitting alone drinking whiskey and watching YouTube videos while I grind it out.
---
How does one afk rc?

There's a lot of people on rs who aren't on Reddit, especially after the mobile release.

Recommended stats to start are 80 range/mage, but the profit/hr is based on people with higher stats and better gear. Probably don't worry too much if your kill times are longer than what the wiki says.

You can use the Black Mask(main component of the helm) without any other reqs, as far as I recall.

"the quest is the longest we ever made" Jesus christ and I thought ds2 was long af, took me like 8 hours
---
I know the exact clip from Matt you are referencing and it was hardly a hot take or an inside scoop. He said the legitimate structure of any and all game developers. 
---
You need content to bring new paying players and keep existing, or you milk what players you have to increase profits.
---
That isn't unique to osrs nor is it new to osrs. It's always been the case. But guess what? That has zero relation with warding specifically. People are using it as if Matt is saying "guys I know something you don't, if this doesn't get through they're gonna start sacking people and considering Mtx". No, they won't, as long as the game is growing, and it has been.
---
So while yes it is a very real concern to have that if our game totally stagnates and player subscriptions plummet that they may take drastic actions. The funny thing is though, the only thing that will cause that is kneejerk reactions based on fear and speculations. Half the playerbase isn't going to stop playing tomorrow unless Jagex shoves an Mtx update in and they *know that*. If they didn't think that would happen we would have Mtx already.
---
What isn't a valid concern in my mind, and what is fear mongering. Is associating this very obvious business based decision to be hinged on warding. We have had 2 skills fail the polls. And the game has only grown since then. So why on earth would a 3rd skill being polled be the determining factor in the game surviving? A skill will always be a good surge in returning players, but like anything that surge subsides, especially if the content truly isn't engaging or new.
---
No reason as to why. They've been fine for 12 years, and are iconic. The game would instantly look like a private server.

They didnt 'add' anything, what the fuck are you even talking about? They REMOVED the congratulations message for the first player to complete the quest.

Did you seriously just open this thread, not read the OP, then scroll all the way to the bottom to find the most downvoted comments, so you could complain about other people 'complaining'?

Dude, you are beyond pathetic. Grow up.

It should be possible. But reliable? Probably not. An average of 3 minute is decent at 80/80 I assume. In your situation, I believe stats would affect time more than gear. This is assuming you're doing everything correctly.

Fossil island wyverns aren't even that bad a task. The only change I think is necessary is to make the number that duradel assigns lower, then they'd be a decent task to do for points.

I made a f2p HCIM with the "endgame goal" of leveling my stats to base 50s (minus Runecrafting cause it's not really worth it in f2p IMO) and completing Dragon Slayer. I spent a lot of time in F2P when I first played many years ago and it was a nice nostalgia trip. Maybe you'll end up enjoying playing as an Ironman and want to continue in p2p.

When I got 99 fm I got one gz and three people telling me to kill myself. Wintertodt is something else.

well there is no meta atm for skilling, it's complete dogshit. who even plays the game for skilling? there's barely any incentive whatsoever to skill on a main, and even if you do skill you will only be doing the most meta methods to max anyway. i think that's why a lot of people switch to iron.

I grinded out 260 marks and then logged off for the night. Just to log on to my account in the same exact place to 0 Mark's and my FM Cape removed....

Could fishing for sacred eels be updated to give more scales per fish? Currently at 99 fishing and cooking you're looking at around 1.5k scales per hour, which is he equivalent of \~7-8zulrah (less than half of what most people can do per hour.).

ros is a bit of a luxury upgrade I think, if you're doing fine with switching rings then it's not necessary to get for now.

First torm, then heart, then anguish. Put ros in there somewhere if you feel like it.

well that's one problem in this game, everything is done for efficiency and only the most meta methods for the most xp. is it too much to ask for if they somehow can make skilling actually fun/worthwhile to do other than just a rush to max

First of all, mostly everything has gone down so your money isnt really worth less. Second, rocktails lol? That would only make sharks go down even more. Third, Magic logs are tied to alch prices so dont worry bud.
---
Banter aside, a lot of skills actually have a lot of content that is under-utilized. Hence why people recommend ironman. You get to play basically all of the games content (unless you go ultra efficient). 
---
I think what people like most about warding is the item sinks and magic buff. The game could use both, but i wouldnt want them to throw it on an exisiting skill or skills.
---
Wish the vennies would just starve to death
---
I‚Äôve looked through your posting history, and you‚Äôre a straight up bigot, my guy. I‚Äôm not arguing with you, and I have no interest in arguing with you. I‚Äôm telling you: Holocaust denialism is very much a fringe belief that will get you ostracized by most people in what we call polite society. I doubt you spend much time outside, though, so that‚Äôs probably not relevant information. Peace out.

Went 53 dry for my last piece. I gave up 3x over the course of like 2 years. Checked my bank multiple times thinking there was no way im that over drop rate.

If you think about it, this entire sub has gone completely mental. Just imagine what this would all look like without the internet medium between us. First, one guy shows everyone a picture, then everybody else begins laughing and parroting phrases back and forth. Everybody in a room, just repeating shit over and over, "He" "He" Then someone takes the picture, and draws something else on top of it; usually something we can all recognize from before. And everybody laughs and parrots the same phrase again, "He" "He" "He" If you imagine it, it looks like we're all in an insane asylum. In fact, that's really all we do here; just drive each other insane. We keep repeating the same shit over and over until one person finally snaps, and everybody agrees and moves onto something else. Then the whole fucking cycle repeats itself. We're all stuck in the Loony Bin and nobody can escape because we just keep feeding into each other's crippling mental illness. And I don't know if I can fucking take it anymore, one of these days I'm just going to lose every last bit of san-

Why should I care if Runescape grows? Jagex profits aren't my concern. My enjoyment of the game is.

&gt;Isn‚Äôt that what Construction did though?
---
Construction fucked the economy so hard on release
---
&gt;The game you describe never existed. Runescape has never been in a state where it would never change or receive updates. Why didn‚Äôt you quit the game way back in the day after they updated it? Why didn‚Äôt you quit when they added new content back in 2005, 2006 or 2007?
---
Because back then I was a kid who hadn't formed an opinion. Kids are malleable, they'll eat up whatever you give them. Also, I did quit in 2007 when they removed free trade and changed the game at a fundamental level. Even as a kid. Started again on rsps's in 2009, was on those til like 2013.

Then sorry but you are toxic to the growth of the game, and people like you, if they get their way, harm the game in the long run.
---
Runescape received new skills throughout its life. New skills every great now and then was a core aspect of Runescape, even before 2007. It was how the game worked. If you oppose new skills on principle alone then you are in opposition to Runescape itself.
---
I don‚Äôt just want a hallow nostalgia trip. I want the game to rewind, reverse its mistakes, and pick up where it left off, growing to become a juggernaut of the MMORPG market. A game that improves over time, rather than festering in close-mindedness.

This is probably the best idea I've seen pertaining to seercull/dagannoth equipment. What I might add would be to incur some cost/skill req to combine the drops from the dagannoth mother to the gear. Maybe if warding passes the poll it could cost vis/whatever resources warding has + a warding skill req to combine. Also as an alternative to adding another boss the drops for each armour set could drop from the dagannoth king of the corresponding combat style. Maybe then the seercull upgrade could be a rarer drop from all three kings.

We started learning Spanish in addition to our native language in 1st grade where I went to school
---
Haha yeah it addictive and pretty good money in the early game. Keep trying, my longest dry streak was only 68 but wasn't very lucky with the items I got tbh. Gl
---
Unfortunately, you'll get smashed at your level PKing. You're like combat 80ish right? You'll be fighting against maxed pures which will devour accounts like yours
---
It's unfortunate (huge criticism of mine is the insane barrier to entry for PKing), but it is what it is. The earliest you can hold your own is 90s STR/range/Mage 75 ATK/def 
---
Try out LMS if you want to get into PKing whilst working on your account for the future
---
To be fair it is one of the better exp tasks with a cannon and really quick to just bust out for points.

You can remap the keys using AHK. Many keyboard softwares that come with it have an option to disable FN completely and treat the keys like normal F-keys. Some laptops have the option to disable FN in the bios.

This.

You can, itll go into your inventory.

Exactly, they vote on what they heard
---
Why should I want the game to grow? Why is that my concern? I don't care if it grows or if it doesn't. That isn't my problem, that's jagex's problem. I'm more than doing my part, I pay them $22 a month, why should I have to compromise on my enjoyment as well, just so they can try make a little more money off me?
---
&gt; In general, I do. If I could vote to remove zeah I would. Some parts are well balanced - eg, blast mining. But I don't trust Jagex to release balanced updates, cos they almost never do.
---
This has been the case pretty much forever. New content is almost never perfectly balanced out of the gate.
---
&gt; Why should I care if Runescape grows? Jagex profits aren't my concern. My enjoyment of the game is.
---
Because Runescape growing means more content and more enjoyment for its players. If your enjoyment stems from a static unchanging game then you shouldn‚Äôt be playing an MMORPG, because that isn‚Äôt what those games are meant to be.
---
&gt; Construction fucked the economy so hard on release
---
Is that the extent of how you measure how successful a skill is then? Based on how angry it made you for changing the market prices for certain items? Big deal. I‚Äôd even say it is a good thing for some shaking up in the in game economy.
---
&gt; Because back then I was a kid who hadn't formed an opinion. Kids are malleable, they'll eat up whatever you give them. Also, I did quit in 2007 when they removed free trade and changed the game at a fundamental level. Even as a kid. Started again on rsps's in 2009, was on those til like 2013.
---
So you think the game itself should evolve to suit your needs, by making itself unattractive to kids, new players and old players who want to see the game grow, just so your items don‚Äôt slightly change in gold value?
---
Meh I thought so too. After 10+ years i created an account for mobile as i don't have a pc anymore. Probably logged 500 hours before taking a break and came back to a perma ban for macroing. I can safely say I won't be returning, even though it's the best game I've ever played.
---
Well at least your honest with yourself about being jealous. Its a good start to rehabilitation.
---
damn, 3 rolls in \~17M XP? that's \*insane\*.
---
What‚Äôs your combat lvl?
---
The key is to have slayer gear and block inefficient tasks. Even then, efficient slayer is relatively slow. I‚Äôd recommend following a guide and grinding for the right gear to ensure you get max xp/hr as quickly as possible.

Yeah, I‚Äôve made bank from farming cadantines and just holding them in my bank because I‚Äôm too lazy to sell. Feelsgoodman accidentally a good merch

Depends on how you feel about gatekeeping I suppose. 
---
There are lots of ways to deal with the multiple account issue without gatekeeping. Why treat them as the same problem? Gatekeeping is toxic. Don't believe me go check out the subreddit.
---
was hoping there was a can in there for someone to miserably fail another shotgun
---
this was close enough though
---
Correct, most of them want a new skill, but this ain't it. It's not an unique skill to train.
---
Sometimes I get sad and cut myself...a piece of cake!
---
When someone says they did ME part 2 and says it was difficult, I still assume that they used a guide.  Considering how ridiculously difficult the quest would be without one, I also assume that anyone who DIDN'T use a guide would make note of that.  Two big assumptions, but prior to MM2 and DS2, MEp2 was widely considered to be the most difficult quest in the game, and if a guide is used, it definitely isn't.
---
Would it be possible to take away the confirmation on paying for farming patches while using the right click option? We're already right clicking to pay, that should be confirmation enough.

Nah, for 1m each he'll trim those capes for them in a jiffy!

This is different. They made the cutscenes unskippable because of the roulette. New people would be matched with people that want to blaze through it and get the exp. So if the new person didnt skip the cutscenes, they would miss all the fights. Bad user experience.
---
Slayer helm is a convenience item. For higher slayer masters and their tasks that you'll be doing, it'll be beneficial for abberant spectres and dust devils. You'll eventually want it, but for your first 400 points, you could do a bit better.
---
Superiors are probably the most tangible unlock, as it directly boosts your exp per task and has a chance at some uniques like the eternal gem or imbued heart.
---
Beyond that, keep a few points in reserve to kill off tasks you don't like with a cancel or block, probably black demons if you can't afford to cannon everything and you don't want a 5 hour task with no profit.
---
And then, when you have points to spare, get some upgrades like slayer rings or broad fletching.
---
As for pking, you probably would need a dedicated account. Try out the LMS beta to get some practice with the combat mechanics before you invest time into making a pure. Most pking accounts have drastically lowered defense and prayer so they can have a powerful offense for their combat bracket.
---

You can get a physical copy of it from "The Collector" in Varrock museum, but you can also build an adventure log in your POH which will also contain the collection log (requires 83 construction, or 75 with +5 spicy stew and +3 crystal saw).

For what it‚Äôs worth I think it had its title of most difficult quest pretty much since its release in 2006, well before MM2 and DS2. Personally I thought DS2 was a bit more challenging, but at least it was fun while ME2 was just a pain the whole way through

Bot was before Heisenberg

Could you guys share your thoughts on the Warding debacle?

I would also recommend bringing like 30 black chins. Throw them at the heals/Jad. It will kill the healers and help you focus on Jad's attacks.

Got all those anyway so not too bad, bet mimic would suck to farm if you didn't already have it though

I think it looks about 500x better then Armadyl.

Wait wdym, I know you get 2 rolls on the table, but there's also a 1/3k drop for the pet and I got a decay jar instead which is also 1/3k. Am I missing something? I'd assume that it could've possibly also been a pet drop instead of a jar drop due to the same drop rate
---
308 is a free to play world.
---
Just use ring of wealth so you have fally park, ge tele for getting to stronghold, and then use varrock tele for the castle tree. I didn't realize people did so much running tbh
---
Mod West's original armor looked a lot more oldschool and actually fitting with the shield
---
It vaguely rings a bell? I can only find some reference to the Jagex username policies, where they use it as an example. Is that right?
---
Ngl everything about Prifddinas looks like the best area the game has had art wise(especially the new town Gwenith) but I do not like the crystal armor or weapons, which tbh seem pretty underwhelming in general(an entire armor set for an effect that makes T70 equipment actually good, that requires maintainence to keep up too?). I understand their caution with balancing but sometimes it takes weeks for content to get updated to be good which automatically kills all hype when 1/3 of the content isn't played on release(the agility course in particular I'm praying to Seren for a day 2 patch to give it an actual use when its exp rates are the same as rooftops and its one of the worst methods to get crystal shards in the city).

Effect*. And you‚Äôre right. It honestly doesn‚Äôt matter today to basically everyone alive today on this planet. It mattered 80 years ago when it was happening to people and right afterwards. But not today. What happened decades ago has no effect on our daily life unless you personally lived through it and were directly affected by it. If it didn‚Äôt happen to you, then why give a fuck?

Awesome cheers mate

You had to walk through this maze and collect colored orbs which you had to bring to their matching altars. You could only carry 1 orb at a time, so you can't just pick them up and run around randomly.
---
There was also a hidden "random room" which would teleport you to a random place in the maze without you ever knowing you were in it.
---
According to the wiki the maze was something like 8 x 8 rooms large, but somehow my map ended up being 3 x 12 or some weird shit like that.
---
Took me about 5 hours to complete it.
---
They aren‚Äôt going to do it. They already have runelite doing it for free, why would they spend months and months doing it at a cost?
---
Probably. Elves need to pay taxes too.
---
Tfw OSRS came out 6 years ago.
---
Yup not much jagex can do besides catching them as quick as possible. This is literally runescapes oldest problem.
---
It looks awful. Almost all of the content from this elf quest that I've seen so far looks so bad. This armor and weapon don't look good. The gauntlet looks so out of place in osrs. Everything they create now a days is grey and (insert accent color). I'm disappointed with the art direction osrs has taken in the last year or 2

It was free all the way from the very first day. They only expanded beyond Falador with members area when the game began to cost too much to run with all the people coming in and wanting more and more.

I'd genuinely like to see a rework of skills. Throw in warding if you like but I'd rather global crafting (smithing, crafting, fletching) and magic-craft skills (runecrafting, warding) than 5 separate, content dry skills.

I would just get a black mask for the time being and use your points on things like blocks and the ability to fight superiors.

That's some quality RP there

They're trying to keep the game going for those top end players who want/need it IMO.
---
Why add it to an old skill that people have already maxed? 
---
I'm not being argumentative, genuine question.
---
Fletching creates the bows and arrows for ranged. Crafting creates armor for ranged. You need ranged to use these things. Why can't u make ranged armor with fletching then??

nah gotta have an impractical one that sounds cool cause that's all that matters with a keyboard
---
I really hate how the proposition of a new skill always makes this shite get posted 100x.
---
Saling will never be a skill, give up on it.
---
Yea
---
That would only mute him
---
Yeah that's the point I was trying to make lol. I guess I didn't really make that clear
---
Relatable xD
---
Thank you Jagex, very cool!
---
Dialogue doesn‚Äôt need to be important. Quests are a piece of work that CAN be enjoyed, they don‚Äôt have to be catering to spacebar spammers like me.
---
I think its a good idea to encourage people to enjoy the content, rather than racing to finish it. If I‚Äôm honest, this is why I fee Jagex don‚Äôt value releasing quests - because a lot of the community don‚Äôt care about them, they only care about the dopamine they get when they cross it off the list.

I'm just saying, you're arguing some random dude on the internet has a lot of credibility just because he claims to be from Venezuela. People on this website say anything to get their upvotes.

And it bugs the shit outta me. My names Joel and have no idea where this is from so from my PoV everyone wants to speak to me.

Slayer helmet is not the efficient option for first unlock, as others have said; though personally I boosted points for it anyway since I can‚Äôt stand the way the black mask looks.
---
As for PKing, at those stats you‚Äôd get stomped. If you want to PK before maxing, I‚Äôd recommend not levelling defence at all until you complete all the quests required for barrows gloves, as well as kings ransom and the knights wave training mini quest. At that point you can level your defence to 70, attack to 75, then your strength to 90+, magic really needs to be 94 too for vengeance, and prayer to 70.
---
In wintertodt is it better to do quicker games where I score around 700-850pts or am I wanting a slower game where I get about 1.1k pts? I've noticed a speed diff in worlds. Cheers again
---
This was my route. Normal trees first so you can do
---
VArrock, Lumby, fally, taverly ( house tab) and then do the gnome stronghold last ( very important) once you finish last try run up the fruit tree, then go to gnome village using the spirit tree , and then from their it don‚Äôt matter, I would go to lleyta using crystal, brimhaven using house teleport tab and then would charter to seers
---
So a quick guide
---
Varrock&gt;Lumby&gt;fally&gt;taverly(house tab teleport) &gt; gnome stronghold
---
Gnomestronghold &gt; tree gnome village (spirit tree teleport) &gt; lleyta (crystal seed teleport) &gt; brimhaven( house tab teleport ) &gt; Cammy (charter boat)
---
Got 99 farming and I looked at every way possible to do this route and this is the fastest one I found.
---
Heh. Boobies. Hehe.
---
I was confused... so i voted yes for warding on my main, and no on an alt. Now im gonna make an alt and vote yes
---
Well in that case she can piss off. Don‚Äôt be that newby who comes on board and instantly try to change everything just cos you don‚Äôt like it.
---
That could be true, but I‚Äôve seen many people say alt accounts are a big problem with voting so I guess this data could eventually prove what you‚Äôre saying! :)
---
What do you think it means?
---
Waaaay to fancy/overstyled

Looking 3rd age colorish

You‚Äôre the one complaining about information being in dialogue format rather than in a virtual book. Literally give your head a wobble, surely you have more pressing things to complain about than the format of information in a runescape quest?

Love it! Looks amazing tbh!

What about me? Maybe I wanna chop some logs and make some fires...I have needs too!

Explain
---
76.7%, too bad reddit is not representative of the entire population and is way more pro-warding than the player base as a whole. i hope it passes but i don‚Äôt see it getting any more than like 60% :(
---
few more hours left, here‚Äôs to hoping i‚Äôm wrong..
---
Ironman btw

You can change the menu from long tap to just a tap

that was my first big drop from gwd. maybe 6 or 7th trip  in sara, started yesterday evening. got all 3 shards on earlier trips also :D

kick jade in the nutsack while keeping your distance whenever he is attacking so he does only range/mage and then you pray flick too

The small feet and large legs remind me of Ed, Edd and Eddy. Nicely Done
---
This almost motivated me to start doing farm runs again.
---
A lot of sample polls for elections only take a few thousand votes
---
Disagree completely.
---
Aside from the fact that afk skills are zero risk, and provide resources automatically (as opposed to monster drops that require attention every minutes),  the bigger problem here is bots devaluing cannonballs, magic/yews logs, etc.
---
Don't mess with the actually pretty well balanced pvm drop tables because some people think it will make skilling more profitable. 
---
I do think wyverns and gargs are the best AFK tasks/pvm, but there's always going to be 'the best.' Everything can't be that good or inflation would be out of control. If someone wants to spend all their time at one specific place, and forgo any slayer xp, or chance at high-level pvm drops, they should have a means to do so.
---
And if pvm is as brain-dead as skilling, than the skillers should have no problem doing that pvm content to earn money, if that's what they care about.
---
The game has options for everyone, what you choose to do, is up to you. Don't force others into your little box, please.
---
No, RS2 was from 2004 to 2013. Where in the dick did you get your years from? Lmao
---
It‚Äôs appealing to have new content offered but I still wouldn‚Äôt come back. Just hard to commit to level up any skills anymore, as I have about an 1-2 a day to play if I wanted. 
---
What would really make me come back is to have more mobile-friendly experiences. It‚Äôs way easier to whip out the phone but so much of the content is still less fun than CPU on mobile. Also I would like to see new ways to level up. For example is sailing gonna be another , click two items together? Use logs, etc. I would rather want to do stuff that adds variation to the same old click to level. Like racing, attacking other players sails, etc all in one. Like fun to play and level up at once - would change it all for me.
---
So informed voting?
---
Iirc jellies also attack with a mage based melee like bloodvelds so his armor and shield is horrible for them.
---
Dorsnitnlog you out immediately? I always assumed it takes a little bit.
---
How long till account is banned for bug abuse
---
It‚Äôs derivative but it‚Äôs still OC
---
Because I see a relatively similar number of people arguing for and against it. 
---
Warding posts tend to be of higher quality though, I'll give them that (especially with some of the artists and OC around it).
---
Can't really create art based on the premise of something not existing.
---
I really like mudkips videos, but devious really is the OG when it comes to maxing Ironmans. He have a maxed iron, maxed HCIM  and is around 2k total on an UIM.
---
Stopped playing in January because of intense schoolwork. High level iron man with almost a billion go worth of gear, over 2k total multiple 99s, started when Ironman first came out. 
---
The reason I didn‚Äôt return was because I had anxiety from bossing. I was doing GWD and I was afraid of dying and losing items that took me a long time to acquire. I know that‚Äôs the thing about Ironman that you ‚Äúlimit yourself‚Äù. Anyway, I didn‚Äôt like it and I found myself not doing those kinds of bosses where there is risk  involved in the event of a disconnect. Jagex said they would be implementing gravestones over a year ago iirc and no word has come from it and Mod Ash wouldnt even reply to me on Twitter when I asked about it. 
---
I know this is just a problem with me but I lost motivation when I didn‚Äôt find it fun to be afraid to play the game. I would probably return if there was gravestones. I have been playing FF14 for the past month since school let out for summer and have been having so much fun with it.
---
Which one is you?
---
I mean i got really lucky and had 2 ranger boot drops within 70 medium clues. That alone could get you a decent chunk of con done, like con is expensive but it's not *that* crazy. Also who knows, maybe he did a slower, cheaper method for training.
---
Phone is already how I play the game.  I'm in the middle of nowhere so unless I use cell data, I have to use satellite internet which has like a 5 second delay where I'm at.
---
The post title was specifically talking about this sub
---
Oh god... fuck this doesnt look good.
---
The poll ends in a few hours, why bother with this?
---
&gt;In response to one of many "your art isn't old school" comments:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;&gt;I feel like you'll just never like what I create. I'm never going to shorten the arms, borf the face and screw up the boobs for ya. I can't bring myself to do it, it looks objectively bad and I would sooner quit
---
&gt;Whether you like her art or not, she finds the 2007 style "objectively bad" and is attempting to change the art direction of the game. Scroll through any of her uploads and you can see the reactions are either "yass slay queen" or "not old school"; polarising stuff. 
---

I felt it was underwhelming at first too, but I kind of like it now. It does feel like it fits the game.

Don't think it'll pass but I really hope it does

I'll predict it'll be 60% No.

I‚Äôll get those tomorrow

---
Pretty much summed it all up with a pretty bow to boot.
---
This is the argument I've been trying to make for a while now when it comes to the "Just break it up into skill X, Y or Z" Having niche things is the whole point of skilling in my opinion... and I couldn't agree more with the magic assessment I mean when they first designed the skill they initially broke it up into "Light" and "Dark" magic... then there's the whole necromancy and geomancy debate that was teased for YEARS back in 06/07. In a way, Summoning did just what we're talking about for RS3. It diversified the broad umbrella term of what constitutes 'magic' into a skill all it's own. And for that alone, it was one of my fav skills. Hope Warding can be too.
---
It makes the void useless
---
100 percent
---
you could melee and mage on  the same time in rsc, and if you had high enough mage lvl you never splashed
---
Holy shit that guy is annoying
---
You need to factor in the twice as many attacks, friend. Dds spec uses 25% while claws use 50%. Redo your calcs doing 1 claw spec + 1 whip hit vs 2 dds specs. You will find I am actually right..
---
Bow also allows you to kill mager first as a solution, or kill the ranger while staying in the north safespot(you can barrage too).
---
Whats the sauce on this? I always forget, but i remember the original video being hilarious

Level 105 combat, 83/85/82, 90 Magic, 82 Range, 86 HP, 70 Prayer.

Noob here. Can you label the 3 pictures for me?

Really? Is there a list somewhere?

Slayer lvl?
---
u big dumb
---
Started playing wow. I really like that wow isn't afkable as rs (rs is basically cookie clicker in a sense) and no warding doesn't bring me back due to my dislike towards skilling besides combat. However, I do think warding brings more longevity to the game.
---
1-77 is hell, but after that bloods are like fishing: you watch netflix or something while doing it and suddenly you have 89 runecrafting
---
Thanks man!
---
lol it's really more of a meme at this point, but it started because account security is so fragile that sometimes people could start with nothing but your stats, then look you up in high scores and find your name, then make an attempt at recovering your account.
---
B L E S S E D B Y T H E C H E S T

hitting 0s is inefficient so train strength and just always hit your max

No chance buddy sorry

How do you know it's at 79%?

Max your combat first

Slayer

Wait

WAIT STOP

Just watch lmao

"Should we add a new player-owned-house house style decoration, themed on the cave goblin city of Dorgesh-Kaan? It would be added as described in the blog - first released with a partnership, before being released to all players at a later date."

Clearly says partnership, doesnt call it anything else, you're out ur mind m8

How do you know the current yes%? All poll results are hidden in game.

missed opportunity to wish a "he-ppy cake day"

69 agi? At which lvl did you start? That seems like an awfully high lvl to get graceful

Gzzz

You are clueless and you suck dick go play rs3

this "he" is already annoying af

this he shit is already annoying af

I'm not even anti warding but it ain't gonna pull through
---
I got a Spirit Tree planted in Brimhaven, so my order is:
---
Grand Tree &gt; Tree Gnome Village &gt; follow Elkoy back to the spirit tree and teleport to Brimhaven &gt; take boat to Catherby (combine with herb patch) &gt; teleport to Farming Guild and continue herb run
---
I lEfT for Rs3
---
You will need to deposit your crafted runes first to make full use of the pouch.
---
You can dump it twice too
---
That‚Äôs what I would work on. Keep getting that slayer up also getting things like qpc and diaries done will really put you into late game

So, high school.. high school with a smart phone

Get a life, no shit it‚Äôs not happening. It already didn‚Äôt pass polls once. No new skill will ever pass because 25% no is not hard for the cry babies to achieve.
---
Okay. If it does I will fully concede that i was terribly wrong
---
Alternatively they could use the grapple shortcut from Catherby -&gt; Taverly tree -&gt; Falador tree to avoid a Fally teleport as well
---
Like bountyhunter?
---
Brand new account just chatting waffle &amp; and if it passes he will be like told you so... if fails he will just disappear
---
Start training slayer! Its the cliche answer but honestly its such an incredibly good skill a and so useful. Look up some guides on slayer for optimal block lists/quests/ other tips you need. Use cannon to train your ranged on cannon-able tasks.
---
Keep training slayer and you‚Äôll start making a decent income which you can use to slowly start upgrading your gear. Get yourself to around 90s in all combat stats (you‚Äôre already close as it is) and 75 prayer and you‚Äôll be ready to start Raids 1. Alternatively I would suggest getting your range to level 90 as fast as possible and then doing Zulrah. At 90/90 you‚Äôll be much better off at Zulrah than 82/90. 
---
Ultimately you‚Äôre gonna want to do both of these things, just depends on what order you have the motivation/time/money to do them in.
---
rainbow
---
He (Downvotes plz xD)

Quest to unlock vorkath, train slayer to do slayer bossing, start raiding.  You have the stats, and should have decent enough gear if you've been grinding zulrah for a bit

You'll have to

Guy dropped subs since this post

NMZ all melee stats to 90+, the higher the better  
---
Get 94 magic through slayer or just burst it if you have the money  
---
Get higher ranged either through a mixture of cannoning while you're leveling your mage or just chin it  
---
Get 77 prayer

Took me like 3 hours to complete that part of the lucid nightmare.

---
Go for the Quest Cape. Just got mine last night and I've never felt more inclined to grind out skills. I feel like I have finally unlocked all areas in the game and can grind optimally.
---
thanks man just get annoyed with all the minor or lackluster achevments people want to brag about somthing they think is good might not be
---
Even the bad ones net a lot of good raw resources and alchables, but it can get disappointing if you don't get mimic or uniques
---
Might be a stupid question so sorry in advance, but what is it about Slayer that necessarily launches you into end game?
---
It comes out today? Wiki says 25th
---
Quest, Vorkath, Slayer, wildy bosses. Pour some cash into the skills that make PvM more accessible and efficient (Slayer and Construction). 
---
Sell most of your bank to get rigour and augury. 
---
Find a cc with some people willing to teach you raids when you get the stats for them.
---
Just use a dds or abyssal dagger if you can afford it, you'll shred the metal dragons. Never use ranged, I always see people use their rune/dragon crossbow and take minutes to kill the dragon.
---
Was hoping you would pull out $11
---
Fine, i'll take a beer.
---
Hanging out in a youtubers cc is usually a good way to find a team or try the We Do Raids discord. They have gear setups and lots of resources there
---
There are a lot of people in from of him regarding their popularity in osrs
---
ETA to closing?
---
holy shit
---
You really think that the OSRS population outside of reddit would have a lower proportion of yes-voters? Completely disagree. If someone doesn't frequent this reddit it is far more likely because they are casual fans than any other reason. The only arguments against warding require a developed view of the game to appreciate. I think warding is great, personally - but either way a casual fan I'd think would be far more likely to vote for a new skill. I predict Yes -78%.
---
When warding fails, we need to re-poll some of the ideas into magic and crafting.
---
old news
---
Then don't use the 'quick' variant
---
I don't know, i don't play for money. But i my closest rs friend says that he needs to make like 20M per day so it's "profitable"

Still looks better than all the Achievement Diary Armor :/

The only issue I have with wyrms is that they blend in with the ground and wiggle so much that they are hard to click on. They look great visually IMO, but the gameplay effect of their design was not considered well enough.

What is RL?

I find it so Ironic that people that play this game 10+ hours a day and made a living of streaming the game actually rage at JMods all the time. I mean, bro. Without this game you probably wouldn't make money..

these posts are horrible

‚ÄúIf you lose you quit or rwt to try your luck again, if you win you quit and rwt it away because you're bored.‚Äù Ya maybe if you‚Äôre already a piece of shit.

‚ÄúWah! The game made me cheat!‚Äù
---
Staking, RWT and donations from viewers.
---
The best moneymaker is combat. Slayer is just a good combat tie-in that offers variety and a power boost. 
---
Big-ticket drops from task-only bosses like Hydra keep their value because they can't be camped, farmed by Venezuelans, or botted.
---
It's worth waking up your mother for this.

I dont get it

are you this stupid or even stupider?

Players said the same thing about the original sword and armor. Then the community made some new designs that were widely supported. The Artists used them instead and most said they were good. Now right before release, it is back to being underwhelming.

But it‚Äôs mainly about the people you surround yourself with in game. If they just do zulrah/slayer you‚Äôll stay stuck. If you find people who do gwd, raids then you‚Äôll have to progress if you want to keep up with them. 
---
Clan I‚Äôm in and absolutely loving it is centered in pvm and the group is really helpful with teaching pvm. They are currently teaching me tob, I never had mates to do it with and they are helping breakdown the mechanics and properly teach it. They say ‚Äúhaving another to do tob will make more gp long term than the carries short term‚Äù

If GP is all you‚Äôre after, learn advanced BA techniques and leech torsos for people. I‚Äôve been told they make ~6m an hour and there are essentially no reqs for that mini game. 
---
Do that until you have enough money for max CoX gear or grab void and do the same for ToB gear. 
---
Again that‚Äôs purely gp-focused though.

That shit would have never passed with a poll, you can insult the user even though he deleted his comment but let's not get delusion here. He's quite an incompetent mod

If warding passes, I will eat a dick.

Shit, this is really good.

No worries, customer support will be replacing a new one right this moment.

Why is voting on multiple accounts allowed? It's just buying more votes, literal MTX. And the people doing this are the most vocal against MTX

Menu entry swapping is getting ridiculous. On the client LyzrdLite they have a left click construction plugin. You literally just spam left click and get max rates.

Damn didnt think it would be that simple, but thanks lol.

That's the point. No-one does. It's completely random and silly.

If you're slaying in the catacombs, superiors 100% give at least 1 of the 3 parts of the dark totem required to fight Skotizo. It also lets you roll 3 times on the normal monster's drop table, with a very small chance of receiving one of the 4 superior monster uniques(mist staff, dust staff, imbued heart, eternal gem). Overall just nice extra benefit to have

Perfect, that will be one gold coin for one of our ice cold beers.

my dad is jad and he said that warding passed

I mean... no, but these people who stay at duel arena all day and all week are addicted to gambling, and have no care about the rules of the game when, 1: they can instantly get back into gambling after losing everything, and 2: can get a huge return or profit in mere moments after winning hundreds of millions or billions, it's no different to other forms of online gambling. Why do you think there's always a world packed with hundreds of people at the arena? Just for fun?
---
It's no secret that the duel arena is heavily related to rwt and a huge source of it in both buying and selling, and has been for years. When that much rsgp is involved and exchanged every minute and hour of the day, it would be completely na√Øve to think it's an uncommon occurrence.
---
its provocative! It gets the people going!
---
Nothing wrong with NSFW material, but usually it's more or less a premium versus fun SFW art, even if it's suggestive.  Just because you're used to Origin or Zuhaar on this sub giving out some average NSFW art every now and then doesn't mean they equate to the same quality or value, especially with decent artists.
---
Plus it's just giving fun drawing ideas, while free porn requests I would usually see on a "chans" draw thread, and this isn't one of them.  Better chance to pay up for a NSFW commission than expect a free porn request fulfilled.
---
Put private to friends or off.
---
Same feeling when I get assigned wyrms... I've gotten 3 100+ tasks for them in the last 5 tasks..
---
&gt;after 75
---
I hate this fucking meme. Wyrms give like 4,5k/kill on task. Even including the price of prayer pots that should still net you at least 300k an hour, mostly depending on how often you bank (i.e. how many bones you bank). Dust devils are easily 300k+ too with bursting. Cave horrors take 58 slayer and shit out over 1k per kill.
---
I think it would be awesome, the guy who originally made them only does the covers, its sort of like an art piece i guess, but he would also hide all sorts of jokes and easter eggs in them, like all the QR codes scan properly and get you to go to some link which shows a picture or something. 
---
If you want a recommendation, might i suggest our swamplord himself, settled as the first offical magazine?
---
And everyone time 1 cums, 2 more cocks take its' place.
---
If the content fits better under Runecrafting in terms of gameplay, they shouldn't make a new skill for it just because the 99RC community would feel like their cape is devalued. Make the game as good and well rounded as it can be.

I‚Äôll give that setup a try. Are you still using full void?

From when I last tested you could have 2 prayer points and still max hit it. Not sure what has changed since Ferocious gloves have came out (other than not needing 120 str to max hit). Just try on POH Dummy

Curious myself. pls let me know.

There is the Crystal Tree, which takes 8 hours to grow. But you need to Woodcut it to gain the shards; it is unclear how quick this will be but it might be longer than the normal "check, dig up, replant". It also doesn't saw how many shards it gives per harvest. But that may be a passive way to gain them. Still, with 1-3 harvests a day, it is unlikely to be enough to maintain the weapon for training on its own.
---
YOUR MOM!!!
---
Any chance we could get a little fix with slayer partners in someway? Just want to kill same monsters and train slayer with my friends without spending hundreds of points on skips.
---
? I'm 99 and 300k an hour is about average if you're doing pretty standard tasks. Sure something like Hydra is amazing profit but thats just one incredible task. What else, Kraken and Cerb? Solid no doubt but not leaps and bounds better than 300k an hour

Usually grandmaster quests have 100k+ exp rewards

This was done to combat bots farming these skilling items. How does it affect you in pvm? It only hurts people who want to make money via skilling, which was never a great option as a real player.
---
it just seems to dominate everything lately constant talk and changes to the dev blog to try to make people want it to pass. its annoying. if people want it it will pass.. if they don't then it wont pass.
---
At 10:30 central time, so about 45 minutes from now.
---
It would be a fun card in a meme deck too. Especially with cards that do piercing to def monsters. In todays meta it's absolutely useless though.
---
you guys are hating but the more bonds this champion buys, the cheaper they get for us.
---
I personally love wyrm tasks. I don‚Äôt get the hate for them.
---
that doesn't change the fact that it looks awfull.
---
The main downside is it can be seen as adding content than is unneeded. You could argue the same for a lot of updates, but a new skill that isn't needed is more impactful than a new boss or a new skilling method. But if it were added, I wouldn't consider anything it brings to be directly harmful to the game even if most of it could be done other, potentially better, ways. It really comes down to preference on how well you think the skill meshes with OSRS and if you like what the skill is offering and how it does it.
---
Nobody will pk with it just like nobody pks with bludgeon or rapier.
---
In today‚Äôs meta anything that isn‚Äôt absurdly overpowered is useless

Runelite (Runelite.net) is a 3rd party cli√´nt (not made by Jagex) it enchances the game with use of plugins and add lots of Quality of life features.

Jesus Christ.  She literally went through 5 different designs for crystal armor, went through loads of feedback, outright rejected anyone who tried to tell her to use RS3's art as inspiration, all in the pursuit of trying to make something the fans would be happy with and y'all are hung up because she said she wouldn't copy Eluned's model from 2005.
---
In how long until the results comes in?

Tanzoo CC ladsssss

You've always been able to do it as far as I know.

Go to house options while you're inside your house. In the top left of that there's a House Viewer (with a picture of a house). Click on that and you'll be in the house viewer menu. You can move the rooms and rotate them! :)
---
The rollback fixed it.  
---
I'm saying the reason it took so long to acknowledge the rollback was they were hoping to just track down and remove the tbows

Imagine needing a video guide for a quest that came out 14 years ago smh

It'll be a number between 0-100 or sure

I mean, I just never really thought about it. I wonder where they would put total level?

After searching the web forever looking for some good info I finally found some, thank you so much! Only tried vork once so far and I realized I will definitely be needing some antifires. Also I had no idea about anti poisons curing venom, so now I'm currently grinding out 64 herblore and will be getting my salve ammy imbued as well. Thanks again.

There‚Äôs sauce floating around, but the tldr is that a jagex support member sent a reply to a player issue with the comment ‚Äúhe‚Äù

Welcome to Reddit.

Daaamn that sucks

So why so much pressure on keeping it out of it‚Äôs not going to hurt the game much?

Why use many words when fee do trick.

How would you rate it for a left-handed?

At what time will the results be released? Are poll results typically released around the same time every time?

3 hours*

it not passing

No don't shout us out, we are tired of all the californians and oregonians moving and thinking they need to bring their bullshit with them lol.

It's not Ashton Kutcher, it's Kevin Malone. Equally handsome, equally smart.
---
What about the people with alts voting yes? is that OK?
---
I'm genuinely disappointed.
---
Regardless of whether or not you liked the skill or not, I still just can't see an argument where the game would be worse with the skill.
---
Distilling all arguments down, that's the one thing I just can't understand. I don't see how the game would be worse with warding.
---
Wish I could say I was surprised - instead I'm just disappointed.
---
Why would a 400k xp/h buyable skill make the game not stale.
---
Wasn‚Äôt even close? 9% isn‚Äôt all that far away..
---
Brainlet on reddit: skill no pass so let‚Äôs lower threshold of people wanting it LOL
---
I would be happy for a new skill but Warding wasn't of interest to me. I want something unique that isn't similar to other skills.
---
Mod West has stated that Jagex is not going to stop introducing new skill suggestions if Warding fails.
---
Lol you're so toxic
---
So what happens to the unused dev time?
---
A majority of 40k, which is about the average number of votes polls usually gets, wants Warding to happen.
---
That‚Äôs the point of 75%... rofl
---
Those 10 no votes were so worth it. Before the crybabies start, Noobs and mobile players shouldn't get to determine the future of OUR game!
---
No. Just because a poll didnt pass that *you* didn‚Äôt like doesn‚Äôt mean they need to change anything. The 75% poll system has been good so far. Create better content and get yes votes. There were many like me who aren‚Äôt opposed to a new skill or new content at all, but in this specific instance I voted no because warding feels like a bunch of shit randomly packed together because they didn‚Äôt know or didn‚Äôt want to add it into the game through other ways. It doesn‚Äôt at all feel like a skill in its own right (like summoning actually was, even though incredibly op). I voted yes to sailing so don‚Äôt strawman me.
---
Sounds like the kind of thing someone who just lost a poll would say.
---
just hop on to rs3 kid
---
Almost resubbed lol.
---
Summoning? Really? Anyways I would be extremely surprised if any new skill passes a poll at this point.
---
You think the game is perfect right now and forever?
---
Likewise

Song of the Elves, Priff, the Gauntlet, crystal armor, crystal weapons and other stuff literally come out in less than 24 hours????????????
---
They already did, it failed
---
Low level players that came in with mobile would quit sooner rather than later with or without warding anyways. See ya bubs.
---
The maxed population is fuck all. So many more people than just them didn't want it. Not a single question passed, and that isn't because of a slim minority of players
---
Bye bye
---
This aged well. Results were actually quite close to the combined Twitter/Reddit analysis.
---
New skills can still be added, just not warding.
---
I wonder what the results would be if Players weren't allowed to vote on multiple accounts :D
---
poll artisan plz
---
Just merge the entirety of Warding into the Runecrafting skill.
---
It works. All the content Warding offers fits perfectly into Runecrafting which is an extremely barebones skill. Instead of new skills lets update the most absolute barebones skills. Like Fletching, Runecrafting, Firemaking, Thieving, etc.
---
Lets try to aim for skills to have equal usefulness to Herblore, Agility, Construction, Fishing, Cooking, etc.
---
LOL loving the tears
---
If I were ever to get a max cape I'd probably just call it quits honestly, until a huge new update launched.
---
That's a false dichotomy
---
You say that like people who voted yes didnt also vote on their alts
---
I've just been afking rune drags while playing other games tbh
---
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHBAHAHHAHAHAH
---
The poll your own adventure sounds nice when it's fresh and new, but people don't understand that a giant collective of brainlets does NOT know what they are talking about. I'm weary because of the past too, but Jagex needs to get a hold of their game at some point if they actually want it to live.
---
People who voted no, please enjoy the taste of my tears. üò¢
---
How would it have brought new people in? Genuine question
---
Yay
---
You sweaty fucks just want to train slayer every day
---
How dare you try to pollute my game from 2007 with new content, ***REEEEEEEEEEEEE***
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
I'd imagine the people that voted no are mostly just hard-headed 'no new skill in osrs!' people, so changing and repolling probably won't make much of a difference.
---
Lots of alts made the no possible.
---
I've been a spite voter since spell resizing failed.
---
Agreed. People kept saying that both sides had people with multiple alts to vote on, but pvp'ers have pures, mains, zerkers, ect.
---
"Boring bankstanding skills exist, so we should add more"
---
  
---
Incredible design!
---
Glad Warding failed but actually quite upset that **everything** failed. Think was a lot of good content in there, just didn't think there was enough to warrant a new skill. I hope this hasn't put the devs off the content, some of it can be repackaged later down the line away from Warding and would most likely be well received.
---
I also hope this doesn't kill the movement for a new skill. I was anti-Warding but am still very pro-new skill, I just want it to be a skill that's worth adding and worth training. Maybe even another Sailing or Dungeoneering rework in the future.
---
Thank you, we dont need more yes voters
---
Sure you are buddy
---
But muh popular vote!
---
Uhhh one of the most active subreddits is the Trump subreddit.
---
&gt;"Expect to hear from us in the next couple of months, but right now are efforts are focused on Song of the Elves, Last Man Standing, ongoing QoL changes, and RuneFest! "
---
We're getting jack shit and if we do get some of the items, it won't be "any time soon."
---
Such a shame.
---
For the most part maxing str is the meta.
---
Sailing and Artisan
---
Despite the absurdly strong push for it to pass from the most upvoted comments/posts on reddit, and despite how much longer a dev blog series it had, it got less than sailing.
---
This was an obvious example of something that we didn't ask for being pushed, and it turns out that it didn't get enough support.
---
The two questions have cared most about passing post-ironman release were wildy ditch removal and sailing. I enjoy watching you people endure the same frustration that I did.
---
Looks like a lot of boring people play this game. How disappointing.
---
2/3 the community wanted the skill wtf u talking about
---
Look at this d00d
---
HA
---
I mean, do people want an "old school-like" skill or do they not? That's another problem here, you can't get 75% of people to agree on a straight fucking answer. Warding was as close of a traditional old-school production skill as already exists in the game. So it gets called too boring. If it was more Dungeoneering like in being more weirdly mini-game based or whatever, then another group of people starts screaming "NOT LIKE OLD SCHOOL AT ALL, DOESN'T FIT" and we're right back to square one.
---
A skill fits OSRS - too boring. A more active and unusual skill is thought of instead - can't have that either, doesn't fit the game.
---
We will never have a new skill because of this shit. And then on top of that you have people too attached to the skilling meta as it is or don't want to ever max again. There's no meeting in the middle.
---
Make skill a minigame &gt; people complain it's not in the spirit of OSRS.
---
Make skill more like a traditional OSRS skill &gt; people complain it's boring. 
---
*shrug*
---
Maybe if they put this amount of effort into a different skill before polling it... Sailing had a bigger yes percentage and they barely said anything about it.
---
Its interesting that minority can essentially control the majority o.o
---
Lmao, who are you trying to delude? Yourself?
---
Oh man, if we don't get a new skill, im definitely quitting!
---
As if warding came out it would completely redefine and reshape OSRS experience for you that it consumer the entire game.
---
120k accounts but yes
---
good job turbo virigns, you get to keep your game pure and devoid of new interesting content
---
Despite the vast majority of the player-base wanting a new skill as shown in the most recent priority poll.
---
HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
---
Sailing and artisan
---
I will always love osrs, but this is def a good time for a break and voting with your membership. Ill be back someday, but not in this state
---
But because it's Konar she specifically tasks blue dragons in the catacombs which only has brutals, so you have to use a shitload of food or prayer, multiple trips, almost no good drops, and they take ages to kill even with 80+ range or melee.
---
Artisan when?
---
XP waste
---
Warding got more percent than Brexit did. Just sayin'
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä OSRS WILL NEVER GET A NEW SKILL ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
I figured. A YouTuber named DVS has maxed Ironman and hcim and he's also working on maxing a uim if you're interested
---
Just update crafting/rc/hunter/magic with warding's content. doesn't need to be all the content so it would be easier to get through a poll, and we can still have the item sink and some fancy mage armors.
---
66% of the brainlets fletching yew bows and rocking their obby capes did
---
Artisan and Sailing
---
Artisan and Sailing.
---
PANIC SELL!!@
---
It didn't even get a 2/3 majority though lol. If we can get bucket loads of content at 75% already I don't see the justification for lowering the threshold just because one specific thing didn't pass.
---
Sailing and Artisan.
---
Sailing was a skill where you built ships and could sail to places and new resource areas/dungeons, Artisan was Slayer but for skilling, ie tasks like "go make 87 yew longbows"
---
When did I say that? Go on twitter and you will see the 1b + total xp players bragging about buying bonds on multiple accounts to vote against warding.
---
I mean, first of all the questions were all incredibly related, so it isn't surprising they have the same results. If you vote no to 1, you probably voted no to all of them. And I would say having just 1 in 3 players be happy with the result doesn't make "the community" clear at all. And I'm someone with no preference either way on the skill.
---
Love when games are managed by 25% of the player base lmao
---
They should poll it as:
---
‚ÄúDo you want warding to not be in the game‚Äù
---
So 33% yes would lose
---
o
---
I wont. Dont suck your own dick too much
---
Exactly
---
You're a prick, it goes both ways with voting.  
---
Voting on multiple accounts should be reportable if proven.
---
Finally
---
Well maybe then, prevent alt accounts from voting but retain the 75%. 
---
Use an official poll site that blocks use of VPN access/Multiple Votes or whatever and use that as the official answer to the question.
---
And make this for all future polls while they‚Äôre at it
---
I voted no on my max account and alts
---
Didn‚Äôt realize I was just a brainless HLC alt and not a real player who put a lot of thought into my decision to vote no. Learn something new everyday, huh?
---
You are free to put a remind me on my comment and see how it goes after Classic has been out for a few months. OSRS hasn't had proper competition in years and that's why it's been growing. OSRS and WoW Classic playerbases are mostly overlapping on a venn diagram. I know personally multiple people who used to play RS, then moved on to WoW, then moved back to OSRS and are now going to go to Classic. It used to be a joke that RS was a gateway drug that leads to WoW.
---
You make very good points, and I don't  really have a good way of wording my opinion on it. 
---
I'm just kinda spitballing here, thinking out loud, but how does taking some cloth to say, the water alter, fit with then creating a robe top with defensive and offensive bonuses?
---
yikes
---
You're acting like the definition of a child. You didn't get what you want so you'll cry it's unfair.
---
I agree.. If the skill was better itself it would of passed
---
Something something democracy is best.
---
Logic
---
yes please do fucker no one wants a doomsayer in the game
---
As if people didn't also use alts to vote yes
---
Mad Lad!
---
I never had a huge problem with RS3 like some people on this sub do, so I don't really agree with the "Jegex killed the game" thing.
---
I actually quite like a few of the RS3 updates
---
til we cant get nice things because of hardcore 2 tick neckbeards
---
Why would they read the other questions on warding if they already voted no to it, stop looking for reasons to invalidate the poll. It failed. Move on
---
Those skills are all different though. 
---
Crafting is (mainly) creating clothing/soft armor and jewelry. There's already certain magical armors made in this skill (warding content could largely fit here, there's precedent).
---
Fletching is the creation of ranged weapons and ammunition. Building bows for precision shooting is inherently different than making soft armors.
---
Runecrafting is infusing essence with magical power. This is inherently different than creation of soft armors or non magical ranged weapons.
---
Smithing is creation of hard armor and metal weapons/weapon components. This is inherently different than infusing stones with magical power, creation of ranged weapons from wood, or creation of soft armor.
---
Attack, strength, and defense may be trained the same way, but are different skills because they do different things. Attack determines accuracy, strength determines damage, and defense makes you harder to hit. They're all inherently different.
---
Firemaking is still pointless though.
---
I agree they should just add it anyways regardless of what the poll says
---
Sailing, artisan, now warding. 3 strikes and you‚Äôre out. Op is right, we won‚Äôt get a new skill unless significant change happens in the community.
---
MRS OBAMA GET DOWN
---
That's a cool idea, never thought of it. But you have to be on task.
---
stop overreacting most polls pass pretty easy with 80-85
---
Not if we dont get an item sink.
---
Mad kids crying over warding, sad really
---
Fucking sad
---
The poll system made this game, it would be terrible without it. If you told people in summer 2013 that OSRS would be a massive success in 6 years time not many would've believed you. Having updates that only a large majority of the game want (75%+) is only a VERY good thing.
---
With 10k less no votes you will still not have 75%, it would have been somewhere around 72%
---
But 2/3 players aren't happy now that it wasn't added.
---
To be fair sailing as a skill was always a meme
---
Sure, but also RC has a much higher ceiling. With all the menu switches, rune pouch emptying into clicking the altar, jewlery teleporting, multiple and changing bank withdrawals, etc.
---
In crafting you're not changing anything and the ceiling for efficiency is very low
---
That is *literally* what a minority is lol.
---
Yes, in this case 33% dictated the results. But remove that extra 8% of votes and it still doesn‚Äôt pass, effectively making 25% still dictate the results.
---
Wipe your tears and stop being a baby
---
I kinda hoped that it would pass and thought that maybe this time.... but alas no... no. Osrs will never get a new skill :(
---
STEP 1: Dehumanize and call people names, everyone is doing this. Acting like your side is above that(which is what OP is implying) is hypocritical, which makes OP far worse than the people they're criticizing.
---
STEP 2: Protest the results of the poll saying it isn't fair.  If Warding did pass, there's a high probability Jagex would be accused of rigging the poll results and a demand to re-publicize polling results. 
---
STEP 3:  Call for a systematic change because you didn't get your way.  See step 2.
---
No voters can act high and mighty because they got their way but to act as if they don't smell like shit(as a general, not any specific people) the same as the yes voters is ridiculous and hypocritical.
---
No

üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª

Drop trade or kill yeah
---
It's so funny. And nah, spent too long liquidating accounts . Maybe spring
---
I sincerely hope this is a troll
---
Some people learn differently than you.
---
There is no definitive answer to video vs text - it comes down to personal preference.
---
Yeah, me too :(
---
Fortunately the 75% threshold is a good way to mitigate their suckiness.
---
No, you have no idea what you're talking about. Don't develop any games.
---
I seem to be the only person in this thread who hasn't resorted to insulting the opposition.
---
I'd appreciate it if you weren't putting words in my mouth.
---
I‚Äôve never had an automated response.
---
Time to start a RS3 ironman
---
*Clearly* the 5,000 virgin maxed players have 15,000 alts that all voted no, and all of the chad non-maxed players have no alts with which to vote yes /s
---
Couldn't be gayer
---
Damn, getting a new skill used to be my favourite part back in the days.
---
Sailing sounds cool but it'd never have enough content to be very interesting. Think Uncharted Isles in the Arc on RS.
---
Go play RS3 if you don't want a fair polling system. 1/3rd of the community didn't want it. That's a huge portion of your loyal playerbase. It failed harder than sailing.
---
Why though?
---
Why does reddit act as if only no voters can use alts? Yes voters are just as free to use alts lmao. 
---
That said I do think alt voting needs to be stopped. No matter what your vote is
---
No official one
---
The game has objectively grown. You can‚Äôt argue that point what the fuck are you talking about. You can say it will decline in the future, but you can‚Äôt say it hasn‚Äôt grown since release with the existing poll system
---
Why not? The devs have said it themselves multiple times; there have never been put more work into a single content update.
---
This is what I want. I loved the content of warding but not the skill.
---
I feel for the Jagex team that put in alot of effort putting together Warding. But I don't think it has to be a waste of time, let's incorporate those ideas into other skills
---
Lmao. Tried that in America but can‚Äôt change the voting structure because it didn‚Äôt go your way
---
1.  Poll a skill that's partly free to play 
---
2. Let F2P vote on it with a 500 total level threshold
---
Then we can see what happens. I think players that are less invested, and have access to less content in general, will be much more welcoming to a new skill
---
It's a glorious day my friend \^ the irl exp we'll get in RC from drinking the tears of reddit noobs
---
This doesn't mean a new skill will never be added to the game. Hopefully when the next idea for a new skill comes around it doesn't feel like crafting with extra steps. I'd like to see this in game at some point, but as a crafting expansion type of thing.
---
and there are plenty of people that didnt like warding but would vote for actual good skill, but you forgot that one.
---
only people who were bad at dungeoneering called it a minigame. It involves the most "skill" out of all the skills.
---
Ah. Yes. The "majority" of players voted no because almost all the yes votes (2/3 voted yes remember) are from people who don't matter. Lmao. Oh but you're right, I need to get over myself. Holy shit Batman.
---
I voted no to warding because I noticed a trend that people who typed pro-Trump comments in clan chats were yes voters.
---
Except there is no logic behind 90%. 75% is literally 3/4 exactly. You understand the entire point is that jagex would rather not piss off more then 1/4 players to make the majority happy? But no I‚Äôm sure you have sound reasoning why it‚Äôs too high
---
Bruh we live in an era with people who own pcs, laptops, tablets, phones, and utilize vpns (and this often only applies to a single person). If you think holding down each ip to a single vote would matterthen boy do I have some bad news.
---
&gt; Polls are for the benefit of the game, so it aligns with what the players want, what you're describing is allowing it to align with whoever pays the most, or is able to grind the most, or who can fund the most alt accounts at the time of a poll vote.
---
How is this not for the benefit of the game? I think you are misunderstanding why Jagex are making a video game at all.
---
I agree with you of course that a no vote has more weight with alts than a yes vote, however I do not see a problem with this. A regular no vote has more weight than a regular yes vote.
---
Myyyyy man
---
I didn't really think so either, so that's why I voted no
---
bruh üëèüòéü§ôüò°üò§
---
UUUH ACTUALLY 66.4% REEEEE
---
75% needed to pass is pointless 
---
The majority suffer due to a minority that could easily have ignored the skill mainly
---
You care too much about your internet points to post ‚Äúgo play rs3‚Äù 20 times on your main reddit account lol
---
Oh man its funny as hell. I‚Äôve rewatched it probably a score of times. I‚Äôve never come across that streamer or this clip and was curious on the context. Thank you!!
---
What about the ramifications of voting no, though? If Jagex throws tons of money and development hours into a skill, making changes with feedback from the community, and it still gets voted down by a decent margin, why do they have any incentive to put time into making other skills?
---
First, thank you for acknowledging my concerns as legitimate. Second, it seems like your issue should be with jagex because they were either unwilling or unable to take two seconds to fix something very simple.
---
Drop you pitchfork and actually think about the post for a moment please.
---
Even worse, for every 1% that just autovotes no there needs to be 3% that autovotes yes. Only with those two groups cancelling each other out can there be a meaningful poll about the merits of a skill.
---
????
---
it would be cool for more content in each skill which we are already getting but dont you think its mostly people who have 99 everything saying that since they wouldnt have to work for new content?
---
lmfaoooo
---
Woah there chill out. People like you are the reason there is so much toxicity. Talk in a civil manner and you‚Äôll get civil answers.
---
Oh yeah true that vocal few completely represents a third of the playerbase. Thank you for invalidating myself and everyone whom I play withs vote, we all voted no. None of us have alts, none of us are even close to maxing. You have no evidence that a higher portion of the no voting community used alts versus yes voters, you're refusing to accept that a significant portion of people think warding is a bad idea.
---
Next poll "Partnerships Reintroduced: Squeal of Fortune"
---
98% yes 
---
2% no
---
Sounds like an absolutely amazing minigame idea, player owned exploration!! Use construction to build the boats or wagons, use wc and fletching and crafting to cut and build the materials. Mining and smithing for the linings and sails and stuff. Make it so that you can see others on the random islands and places where you can end up! Maybe giving new minerals for mining and smithing to create new things, new bosses maybe and all cool stuff. 
---
A skill however? No thanks. I don‚Äôt want a skill that is reliant on others, or stupid slow alone.
---
Uhhh, proxies my guy.
---
Mathematics. If one person votes no with x accounts, it takes 3x+1 accounts to vote yes for the content to be passed. A numerical example:
---
Nay sayer votes no on his 3 accounts.
---
It takes (3x3)+1 = 10 accounts voting yes to pass the 75% threshold.
---
10 yes out of 13 total is 76.9% yes.
---
Victory tastes so ever sweet, let's drink comrades!
---
This sub is a very small minority, and kinda showed here since 66,4% yes only... not even full 2/3 wanted the skill. Just that how many people voted with multiple accounts
---
twitter weeb kpop ehp nerds win again
---
They're not going to.
---
Oh fuck all you assholes who voted no. Have fun when this game ends up dying.
---
Cya üëã
---
Oh I understand now. But I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äòd really change a tele for that.
---
Actually slayer 2 was the worst performing skill poll
---
Yay no new skills ever /s
---
Pretty much everything passes, not much gets wasted at all.
---
oh yeah, nvm, I thought slayer and farming were 2006 but they were 2005
---
Sailing would fail again with the same amount of dev time.
---
Yeah Im with you on this. See a lot of people ITT complaining the threshold needs to be dropped. No. Not really. A lot of great content has been polled and passed with over 75% just because it was good content. Itll bw the same with a new skill. When Jagex hits the sweet spot, a supermajority will want the content. Its so much better to have 75% of the community happy and the other 25% disgruntled than say 60 40 or 50 50. I dont think people realize game companies internally will throw out tens of ideas for new content to games before finally finding one they like. The only dkfference with OSRS is we are included in the "internal" debate.
---
bye
---
WHO!?! I WANNA KNOW WHO!!!
---
Yea because Mining and Smithing fit into each other. Warding is its own thing. Runecrafting is RUNE FUCKING CRAFTING. Nothing about crafting says 'magical crafting'. Crafting should've produced the enchantable materials for warding just like mining harvests the materials for smithing.
---
Didn't pass.
---
50 att gmauler.
---
50 att 70 str 70-80 ranged 1-31 prayer
---
But they are maybe gonna nerf gmaul. So you could always go 60 att after. Most of these stats are easy to quest
---
I'm assuming they went to respond instead of delete, typed one word, their brain was so broken from reading her "review", they hit post and moved on.
---
If i invested time and money for membership/bonds I deserve to have a say on each account. plain and simple
---
I saw another comment saying 30% (reality is probably closer to 15%) are completely against any new skill, so that sets the ceiling at 85%, so finding a skill that 75/85 people approve of is gonna be very tough.
---
Which of our current skills are ‚Äúanything special‚Äù? This filled a big gap where we have no way to create magical robes ourself and was well thought out and would do a lot of positive for the game imo.
---
This chain is about retaining some of the ideas of the failed poll, not about adding the skill just for the mage armor. We're talking about the opposite of that...
---
If it's *seriously polished* and makes a lot of sense, yes, I think so. It will take a lot of discussions, though, and it may only happen once some of the current people leave or get dissolved by new players.
---
making fun of the disabled isn't cool
---
Oh shut the fuck up. This place was a giant propaganda machine just as bad as the max players were pushing against it.
---
Max players are more likely to have alts than non max players and those players are less likely to want a new skill because they would lose a max cape
---
Am I out here asking for squeal of fortune? No lol, but simple cosmetics like red skin or whatever from a YouTube partnership aren't hurting nobody and it brings in new players. And you get the skin like 2 weeks later if you really want it. Win-win :)
---
yes because its hilarious
---
Finally, a use for 99 firemaking
---
this bug has been in the game since release. Really annoying in the fire phase.
---
Why would both sides have the same number of alts, though? That's a bizarre assumption. Most casual players, etc. won't have an alt.
---
I voted no because I didn't think it would improve the game. It might not make the game worse, but the bar for new content should be higher than that.
---
why do you know this...
---
OSRS still gets plenty of updates don't worry. There is a pretty big high level update coming out tomorrow for example.
---
It'd be a year of no updates.
---
That was actually cancer.
---
The 75% threshold is too high. We have lost a lot of great content to trolls.
---
Herbs for herblore too?
---
Also 99 mining at ML mine isn't enough for 99 smithing. So you're gonna be mining well after 99 mining if you want 99 smithing
---
Yea I was asking a few people why they voted no and the answers I got were, "its not old school" and " if you want another buyable 99 skill just make a new account". All pretty lame ass reasons to vote no.
---
Needing 25% of the total 'no' voters to change their vote is pretty insane.
---
nice joke buddy
---
the 1def pure robes that are worse than salad robes
---
The majority of people who voted yes are also ‚Äúsweatlords‚Äù so what is your point? I voted no and I‚Äôm not max nor did I vote on an ‚Äúalt‚Äù. Get your head out of your ass.
---
‚ÄòThe content i wanted didn‚Äôt pass so we should lower the threshold‚Äô 
---
Thats really stupid. So much shit failed at 67-75%, why make an exception for this. 75% is a good number because it means only the most desirable changes are the ones that go through.
---
Lmaooo
---
what do you mean next 5 years ,this game is going die by then . its just gonna RS3 levels of players
---
Oh no, 5 items that correlate to magic, crafting is magical now.
---
Would love to see some serious analysis on these results.
---
As in, are players who spend more time in combat related activities less likely to vote yes in comparison to someone who‚Äôs not?
---
Are people who are maxed more or less likely to vote yes?
---
Etc... etc...
---
Nah, I‚Äôve had this opinion for a while, it‚Äôs exacerbated by this poll, sure, but my opinion stands alone.
---
This is amazing news. Let old school be old school and preserve its fundamental values at  all costs.
---
I think I have an idea for integrating the robes into existing skills. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/chas4w/creating_magic_equipment_via/) briefly describing some mechanics that could stifle common complaints like "overbloating crafting" and "devaluing traditional runecrafting."
---
think about all the garbage content that would be in the game if there wasnt a 75% passing threshold.
---
Thank god
---
Fuck you I want pets I'm no neckbeard
---
Kinda stupid point to make considering this server is based on after those skills came out because they was good and brought something that the game needed.
---
Agreed, but it's very difficult to make a design everyone is happy with.
---
They do listen to the feedback they hear, but unfortunately a lot of the time the devs don't want to scrap the initial idea so just tweak it til people stop complaining as much. They also only seem to ask for feedback on twitter, which isn't exactly the best place for discussion
---
Is there really? Melee skills get a new armor class every 10 defense levels. But the progression of Magic armor is Wizard robes at level 1-20, Xerician robes from 20-40, and then you're basically with stuck with Mystic robes until either you're level 70 with Ahrims(which degrades) or are incredibly wealthy and can afford Ancestral at 65. There's certainly a problem with variety here
---
Cool, but that's not an argument.
---
And now people are talking about lowering the 75% threshold. smh
---
Thanks turbo virgins
---
&gt; Yes you can play like an ironman for all the other skills
---
Firstly that is disingenuous, in what way does that address the ability to afk slayer/ranged with a cannon, or afk magic with splashing? And arguing that paying runners doesn't count because it's expensive is absurd and impossible to exactly define. At want point does the hourly cost stop a skill no longer being considered afk? 100k g/PH, 1m g/PH?
---
Secondly I never did change the goal posts, creation skills are balanced to be interesting around the items needed to create stuff. Any creation skill which needs tradeable goods to craft the end product will also be possible to afk. And any creation skill where the gathered materials were untradeable, to be fair, wouldn't pass any poll.
---
I don't think everyone who skipped the subsequent questions voted no to Question 1. I voted Yes to warding, but skipped some of the subsequent questions that focused on content that I'm not interested in, or didn't feel educated enough to answer.
---
You mean the company that's pulled their product from a lot of shelves so minors can't get them? Guess what, kids are crafty and if they want a Juul, they're going to get one somehow.
---
ü¶Ä ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äwarding failed because your self conscious of your neckbeardü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Every game dies. I never said this is gunna die by this vote. The game runs by the polls, whatever journey we go on, the game will eventually die by it.
---
na they would never lmao, I'd love if they did though!
---
I'd quit if that got voted down. I don't love warding but if they were to just cancel all new skills forever that'd just be depressing. I don't want to plat a snapshot from 12 years ago.
---
!h
---
Doesn‚Äôt look too much of a difference too me honestly, I mean 66% DID NOT want it too fail, hence why they voted yes.
---
As in randomly generated every time you visit, or you save one you like and every time you come back its reset the same way you found it?
---
Damn savage of him to even respond to that.
---
Dillon!
---
The truth hurts sometimes.
---
nah i think ill just continue to vote no
---
Oh I see, I was just reading the comments. My bad.
---
This translator is used a lot on this sub, I really only needed to see it a couple of times to see the pattern.
---
General Reposti!
---
A. Agreed.
---
B. As long as the rates aren't as high as proposed and serve as a slower alternative to running runes, it shouldn't be an issue. The community generally doesn't mind changes if they supplement current rates with slower alternatives.
---
C. Add it to magic, similar comments in B regarding xp rates.
---
Bye zoomer
---
No, because the people who were against it seemed to be max levels and big content creators.
---
Stage 2

pure nhing for the robeskirt &amp; maniacals for bursting ye. basically all of their usefulness.

Current wow is not my jam and I didn't start playing until the end of loch king so I wanna see what classic was like so that'll probably be my home for a while
---
Incel?
---
It's sad that you think people are just afraid of change and can't have a different opinion on things.
---
so many posts like this in this sub right now, where were you guys when this sub was spite voting no to pvp polls.
---
That's not all they want to do, didn't you see the poll?
---
I would. Until it get to the 50s in the skill. I‚Äôm also a free to play player so. I‚Äôll take whatever I‚Äôm allowed to do. I‚Äôm free to play, once you get past the 50‚Äôs in most skills, it gets boring real fast.
---
Your boys already buy bonds. You've already accepted mtx fella
---
It would also fit in Runecraft where we already have imbues.
---
Its a generalization. Everybody* was asking for a thematically correct, oldschool feeling skill.
---
*  Almost everybody to the point where its not worth mentioning the almost
---
I come here for the OC
---
Hahaa nice I posted the same Title xD
---
Yeah, oh, wait, except, all those other maxed players with their many Alts who did want warding in needed 3x the amount of Alts voting yes to cancel out the no votes but wait, I‚Äôm almost getting it.
---
- Mate i doubt you're playing less than 45 minutes per day. 
---
- I do the most efficient methods without 2t or 3ting (because I'm not sweaty). That means I do barb fishing but just not 3ticking it. I average ~55k exp/h. I'm sprry but I don't know any methods out there in fishing that are ~550k exp/h (55*10).
---
How can you "almost guarantee" those 2 statements?
---
I thought there was a chance of Warding passing before the poll. I also thought that the threshold should be changed before the poll even opened. OSRS is never going to get a new skill and I promise you that it will eventually lead to a large drop of subscribers down the line if it continues.
---
So then alts don't really matter.
---
If there are*
---
Imagine being this lonely lmao
---
he is a cute scout :-J
---
Oh no there definitely is a lot I haven't experienced. I'm taking a break from the game since I burnt out in June. I've been pet hunting before maxing either agility or rc.
---
I just wanted some mid level mage filler armors with cool niches.
---
Thanks for this
---
I have been saying the same thing in my discussions with people. Most of them seem to realize and change their tone.
---
I remember hearing that the guy said he was actually severely depressed from that
---
Because it's the most unique skill and unlocked tons of interesting content
---
yeah, I am sure jagex spend hours on reading and reacting to feedback, preparing skill previews, artworks brainstorming for content that would create dozens of playtime hours more than single quest on dungeon, update that can be base for a lot of future content,  in poll that had over 25% more votes than previous biggest polls and 3,5 more votes than last poll... 
---
is just a noise content...
---
I guess time to start grinding for that construction on my ironman
---
So its not dungeoneering anymore if youre using your gp to buy gear inside the dungeon. Its just raids with unqiue gear for inside
---
1500 for normal accounts. 1250 for Ironman.
---
Literally only excludes people that just started playing.
---
and a majority of 1 million
---
Adios
---
Add a Nascar speedpark next to Lumbridge and give us karting.
---
But for you baby, i could be
---
Man you must be talking to much nicer people than me. Everyone I know is in one of two camps: "no new skills ever" and "if we want a new skill we better vote yes for warding even though it sucks since it's all we got"
---
A lot of us that still have fun with this game are the ones voting no. Just cause youre bored with it is YOUR problem not the games fault.
---
Everything in this game could be if you want to exploit it and get technical.
---
What does ironman mode have to do with warding? Most ironmen I know wanted warding to pass.
---
Mate, not everything is an attack alright? It was just a joke lol.
---
&gt; Every skill is samey though lol.
---
-
---
&gt; That's fine for most skills, at least it's what we've come to expect, but a satisfying and enjoyable exploration based skill is just too tall of an order IMO.
---
WE WANT DUNGEONEERING
---
The only people who keep making this quip are the ones who are actually using all new content. Plenty of people still play an ‚Äúold school‚Äù way, just because the nostalgia doesn‚Äôt hit you the same way it used to doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the same for everyone. 
---
I never use graceful because despite its ezscape perks, it‚Äôs ugly as shit and makes me enjoy the game less if wearing it instead of a funky skilling outfit. Same with Zeah, it‚Äôs mediocre content that I really have no interest in regularly exploring. 
---
Although with most updates it‚Äôs still been possible to enjoy the game old school style. Even with all the PvM updates that have destroyed skilling as a money making method. But a new skill, especially Warding, seems like it would be almost impossible to avoid if you wanted to go for an authentic old school experience.
---
yo where is this He coming from?
---
Nice try, you're not getting my RS acc - an Apache Attack Helicopter
---
I am maxed and would love to max again. One of the best part of this game is the satisfaction of leveling up skills, havnt experienced that in a while. Whoever says they don't wana lose max cape is kinda an idiot, considering the max cape is just all the skillcapes added together. You never lose ur perks, u just lose the convenience of having it all in 1 inventory slot
---
I conquer
---
!!!
---
That‚Äôs what I thought too, the content was great but not necessarily a good fit for a new skill. Guess what responses I got? ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want change to come to osrs‚Äù ‚Äúyou want the game to die‚Äù ‚Äúgo back to rs Classic if you don‚Äôt like change‚Äù.......uh
---
Ooo in that case, keep working on flicking, if you can atleast flick mage (and maybe even all minions with practice) you can extend your trips alot. Hope you get Tassets sooner than that though!
---
I probably changed my mind 5-10 times on it. I voted for it, but I am kinda glad it didn't barely pass cause I'm still pretty uncertain on whether I want it or not.
---
I want a new skill in the game, but warding just seemed so uninteresting to me which is why I voted no on it.
---
RS3's problem was microtransactions and too much new shit no one wanted...  Wait that sounds familiar.
---
lol bet u never got lvl 2 summ
---
Just because 50-75% of people vote a certain way, DOESN'T mean that it's good for the game, or even for the people themselves.
---
People will easily vote in stupid shit if it benefits them, hence the cola/brocolli analogy.
---
I wrote it as a response to a comment. Read it, and it may give better context.
---
Just use magic lol
---
I think you guys are vastly overestimating how many people actually did this. Even if everyone only voted once it would probably only reach a yes vote of 70.
---
Shame üîîüîîüîî
---
Which is what we want, I wouldn't be able to vote anymore but it would be a new goal making the game more fun!
---
It feels like you‚Äôre trying to argue when we‚Äôre both saying the same thing lol. Obviously it‚Äôs easier to get a lesser percentage of people to agree on something and ‚Äúalt voting‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sway this significantly
---
Nobody is trying to ‚Äúget‚Äù your account.
---
Winners win. He did not win.
---
Yes - New skill will attract new players, give existing players something new to do. More magic armor is good. Worried about stagnation of the game if new skills aren't added. 
---
No - Don't feel that the content in warding needed to be a new skill, could be added into existing skills. Didn't want another buyable/bankstanding skill. Many just never want a new skill in OSRS. New skills could fuck economy upon release.
---
Wouldn't really call it integrity with the amount of alt account spamming that occurred to keep Warding out of the game.  There surely has to be something that can be done to limit this in the future? Why should someone else have 15 votes while others have 1 simply due to their cash stack?
---
There are some things that are questionable in it
---
Is it banable? depends how you use it tbh most of the plugins are just overlays and jagex can't detect those on the other hand there is this plugin called flexo and that shit is pushing the rules real hard when it comes to macroing and it won't surprise me if you get banned for using it.
---
There are some other plugins that are pushing the rules like left click blackjacking and thats something jagex can detect too as they wont register a single rightclick when you use it.
---
then you have the obvious plugins that should 100% be banned like a scouting plugin, pray against player plugin, pvp safespots etc.
---
use it at your own risk
---
&gt; This was proposed damn nearly perfectly with the last blog 
---
Maybe perfect for you. Warding looked like a train wreck imo.
---
Well I would.
---
I don't even play the game anymore and I logged in and bought a bond just to vote no so I could see fucks like you lose their goddamn minds. God bless
---
I agree that 75% will mostly lead to updates that pretty much everyone wants and all the "garbage" gets weeded out
---
But for controversial topics like these having 1/4 of people being worth more than 3/4 is kind of silly, If there's ever anything sort of debated it's not going to pass, Even 65-70% is still a huge majority.
---
26% of voters shouldn't be worth more than 74%, If we ever get a 74% fail it's going to be a huge shitstorm
---
Every minute I take to complete SotE is a minute I don't have my quest cape. It's the only cape I have that doesn't make me look like a complete noob.
---
we certainly ain't playing "2007scape" either lmao!
---
they voted to lower it but as a community we decided that it would be better to keep the requirement high to avoid bad updates be upset with what happened not the system
---
I mean if you take away 10k votes from no and 10k votes from yes it changes the results quite drastically
---
I love the saying, "A person can be smart, but people are fucking dumb." -Paraphrased by me
---
You sound pretty salty my guy
---
Doesn‚Äôt make any goddamn sense 
---
Literally never pk‚Äôd someone in my ~3 months of game time in osrs and I voted no 
---
Warding looked boring as fuck, get over it
---
It looks lame.
---
Wait, there were plenty of mocking assholes advocating for the no side. You see that guy spamming "sit kid" in the other thread? Come one, every side's got assholes.
---
What?
---
Warding fits better, sailing is weird, but could be fun
---
Hahaha genuinly made me blow more air through my nose than regularly
---
It's summer
---
Dont think they'll go to waste, some of the sailing concepts were used in dragon slayer 2 and  bone voyage quests. 
---
Maybe if they decide to walk away from this skill the ideas will be used for more elemental workshop quests.

I don't care about this whole thread or about warding but bonds don't magically get made. That's still revenue for the company, someone had to buy the bond with real cash for it to exist.
---
Even if they all voted, that's only 6,373 players
---
Laughs in DHCB.
---
I imagine that's most people, they see it rose drastically so they bought in right at the end where the people who bought in at the beginning are selling it to them.
---
Well I‚Äôve know many of them for almost a year now so.
---
Sailing was actually a lot more fleshed out than just islands and sort of dungeoneering and reading back the blogs looks like it could've been exciting.
---
return spend 40 hours maxing it then leave?
---
I'm loving the implication that because I voted no, I must want the game to die.
---
Summoning would get yes votes on all my alt
---
&gt;Invention is a better skill for example, it involves all gear, it's not around magic gear
---
warding is to magic gear what smithing is to melee gear, and crafting is to range gear. its very possible that high lvl mage armor was going to be locked behind warding, and not just the pouches that you seem to delude yourself into believing.
---
you say "invention is a better skill" but dont elaborate on anything but instead shit out dishonest a comment lmao
---
This aged well.
---
Looks like you got plenty if your not maxed icon is correct
---
So let's assume every "Yes" vote was legitimate. Big leap of faith, but let's just assume it for keeping math simpler. 
---
There were 82,633 votes for warding. Total votes would have to be at or under 110, 177 for 82,633 to be 75%. That leaves room for 27,544 votes against when there were 41,726. I'm not here to tell you alt voting didn't happen. But do believe 14,182 or 11% of the total votes were by alts specifically dedicated to voting no?
---
Somebody's a wittle angwy
---
Call the waaahmbulance
---
I like the idea of it. The skill itself unlocking better/stronger gear as well as higher tier dungeons. With the completion of dungeon providing an xp bump based on your performance and role in the dungeon.

The yesfags are the ones who swarmed r/2007scape first with their shit propaganda and their weeb lewds of neive. People started shit talking them after the fact in retaliation because they were acting like complete doofuses from the getgo. Then they act surprised because their targeted audience stooped down to their level lol
---
Absolutely not
---
Not even just combat but just the whole of the game, all of the mule summons are really what drove RS3 to change even further than EOC already allowed.
---
The majority of brits voted for brexit and look at that shitshow
---
you wouldn't know that, since it never got released. This isn't a new pvm monster, this isnt a new way to do crafting. This is a whole new skill that would be beta tested and developed over a long period of time. 
---
In my mind it should be put in beta, run it around, do a few updates. In 6 months time people should be able to vote it, after having tried and see what it is exactly. 
---
How else are skills supposed to pass a poll?
---
i dont get why someone should vote no to a skill literally same as crafting and some diversity for the game like new magic gear. I just dont get this kind of players this game wont last much long how it is atm and WoW is coming so gg
---
Gzgzgzzzzzz
---
*It doesn't feel OS enough.*
---
1900 total is absolutely not the HLC. I‚Äôm 2100 total, and I‚Äôm not considered part of it.
---
This is actually a good point.
---
I enjoy slayer. Particularly wyrms, squahs, and black demons
---
Who would ever train something as boring as slayer. You kill the same shit over and over and after you kill a few hundred, you have to switch and completely regear. You can‚Äôt even spend your evening watching Netflix while playing bc you have to keep changing what you kill. 
---
My mocking banter aside, People have different tastes bro. I‚Äôd legitimately prefer slayer if the tasks could be extended to killing 5k-10k of something before having to switch.
---
Yes, for sure. All I tried to explain with my comment is that even if only high-level players and their alts voted no, we'd be seeing roughly the same amount of 'no' votes as we did, because they own *at least* 30-40k accounts.
---
But then you are assuming all content ruins it integrity... you are literally reaching to the extreme. Just because a lot of people didnt want it added because it could change the game better or worse forever.
---
It boggles my mind that 66% yes isn't a pass
---
I literally said they were going to work with community to help the skill grow. 
---
It says that very fucking thing in the fucking dev blog.
---
Are you this stupid. Really.
---
Sis you even read the damned blog?
---
Probably a mix. 
---
I voted no because I didn't want a skill that I didn't like to require me to level it to 99. Best counterargument anyone had for me was "Well nobody's forcing you to want a max cape, diary benefits, or quest rewards!" Sure, there are already skills that I don't like in OSRS and wouldn't mind if they disappeared, but that doesn't mean I should just vote yes on every skill that I also don't want to train.
---
They should just say ‚Äúhere are the three skills, pick one. ‚ÄòNone of them‚Äô is not an option. You have one week‚Äù
---
I think they just don't want alts which exist strictly for voting. There's others with less restrictive, but similar ideas, 3 months of members, having members from before the poll was announced, etc.
---
Fuck, if only lmao imagine the salt
---
seething
---
Its a simple compromise that would work for everyone. If they actually add a new skill, its hard to ignore it. If its delegated to a talent then its optional and doesn't bother old school purists.
---
Why are they 3 times more valuable?
---
sjw much?
---
2/3rds is 66.7% and warding failed that too
---
This wouldn‚Äôt be an engine thing I guarantee they have these numbers already.
---
Right but it felt way faster in the 40's, now in 50's it's crawled to a halt and I feel like I should be doing something faster.
---
"neckbeards will vote no"
---
"I voted no"
---
Hmm
---
It's not a threat it's not an ultimatium just a fact. I am pretty bored with the game I have't maxed out but I can do pretty much all the content in the game doing that same content another 300 hours doesn't really sound "fun"
---
I wanted something new to reignite actual excitement I will probably fuck with the new elf shit for a week or two then stake my bank and call it quits. I don't have another 5 years to sit around and wait and hope the game gets more fun while EHP nerds and nostalgists vote no to everything.
---
:(
---
Ffs
---
There's barely any end game content. Of that content, most of it is tedious. Perhaps the game's been intentionally designed this way to promote players making ironmen. Personally, since achieving my maxed infernal cape and max PvM gear, I play other games or pk. Depends on your goals, but end game is shit and PvP barely has updates worth doing for main game in the wilderness and aren't very rewarding anyway. Revs pking nets you like 20m a session, but you don't really do it for the gp. It's just fun.
---
How many people do you think have maxed accounts?
---
Because thats the game
---
They have already polled it. People didn‚Äôt like any of the ideas
---
Endgame content? 
---
‚ÄúSarachnis is a new mid-level boss aimed at players around 100 combat who want to try their hand at bossing.‚Äù
---
Are you gonna cry? Like a little baby?
---
Alienating? Literally how have you been alienated?
---
Not getting content that a third of players think would be wrong for the game in its current state is not alienating. Pushing content onto a third of the players that will absolutely affect the game and will make some players quit is alienating.
---
The way America clearly elected Trump because so many people definitely love him, amiright?
---
What a baby
---
That‚Äôs not quite what I was asking as I‚Äôve seen many reasons why players don‚Äôt specifically want Warding, but thanks your insight! I don‚Äôt dispute that Warding shares a little too many aspects with other skills in its mundanity. I must say I was surprised to hear most players dislike the current skills we have in game, but at least we‚Äôve found something out! A production skill isn‚Äôt what is wanted.
---
Why does Sailing need to be a skill? That‚Äôs what I find myself asking. It would make a great minigame - I‚Äôm sure of that - but what about it does it share with other skills? They‚Äôre generally a simple action repeated over and over.
---
Holy shit I was lol
---
:)
---
wahhhh my side didnt win!!! change the rules so i can win!!
---
Yeah I'm one of them. Played the game for over 15 years.
---
I agree personnaly, but I understand from Jagex's pov, people with alts pay more this should get more votes?
---
And?
---
I'm gonna be loving this new quest we get tomorrow along with the new city, new boss, and the gauntlet
---
The full results are already up, and linked in the OP...
---
RC wouldn‚Äôt be devalued lol.
---
I realize what RC means, but it‚Äôs a magical item that you‚Äôre creating through the skill. Warding is the same.
---
well this sucks :(
---
Fuck the alts. 2/3rds of this community wants Warding.
---
While I agree with what you are saying I don't really in the context of specifically warding, since it is after all another bank standing buyable that produces gear that is probably going to sell for alch value on release and I rather see it as a detrimental skill for new player experience since it is expensive and doesn't produce anything useful or exciting for regular accounts. I don't think something new entering the game in itself has any value for a new players who hasn't played the game before the addition and for me warding is the opposite of exciting content. Though it's kinda hard to accurately judge outsider perspective of the game you've known of and played on-off for well over a decade lol.
---
Ok
---
Care to comment on why the suggestions in the initial post wouldn‚Äôt work? IMO increasing the required total level could be part of the solution. It just can‚Äôt be the only change. As you pointed out, raising it too high would be problematic. For example, too high of a requirement may not work well for a player who‚Äôs primarily interested in PVP and only has membership on an intentionally limited account, like a pure.
---
That‚Äôs the way osrs is, every 7 levels the exp doubles, 40 is low as fuck, 50 is too, if you‚Äôre having issues in the 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs there‚Äôs a very good chance you‚Äôre never going to get a 99
---
They should do a repoll and only allow people to vote once per IP :^)
---
These virgin neckbeard losers voting no on multiple accounts .... i would vote YES to MTX right now just to watch their game burn down.
---
Maybe if you're a basement dweller and have 8 hours to play a day, but for people like me with sometimes an hour tops the GE was the best update to come to the game. Iron man mode is briliant, but just not for me. I don't want to spend 5 hours trying to buy 30k gold ore to get my smithing up.  I just want to train some fucking smithing, not spamming endlessly at V west and ruin my eyesight trying to find a good seller for some gold ore.
---
Jagex should re-poll but ban voting from same IP.
---
The quest needs a whole bunch of others and the dungeons need high level gear and knowledge of combat. Kind hard to beat Jad on mobile as it is.
---
The xp/hr will go up pretty linearly, but the xp to the next level goes up logarithmically. So while you maybe gain an extra 1-2k xp/hr per level you gain, every 7 levels the xp you need doubles.
---
That's just the nature of the game, the higher the level the longer it will take to get (usually)
---
Have you trained a single buyable in your life? Where is 1B coming from bud? Most buyables are from 50-200m depending on how fast you want it.
---
Same story as ever, they're afraid of change to their precious game that's already had tons of changes.
---
we'll never know
---
I voted no to warding, first of all. But brainlets like you who skew polls so they don‚Äôt accurately portray the community‚Äôs thoughts are honestly pretty pathetic. On both sides, I should say.
---
Yet you are being angry, sorry about that! hope you feel better soon!
---
I voted yes on my main purely because I really want the rewards added. I could care less about the skill, because like crafting/smithing, I don't level the skill up for the gear I want I just buy it lmfao. 
---
Voted skip on my pure because as much as I want more ez levels for total worlds, I wanted those mage armors to be in the game (more variety in what zerks fight me in). Skill doesn't affect my pure since I just level combats on it, so thats why I skipped.
---
Nothing to really talk about here, this was going to happen
---
Tutorial island plays
---
I just hope, even though warding failed, that they implement the mage sets somehow. I feel like there aren't enough mage sets. I mean, you have mystic then ahrims and ancestral. Nothing between 40 and 70. The ideas of the sets seemed really cool too, whether their added to crafting, runecrafting or whatever.
---
Fuck dude, I had the exact same idea a few hours ago, navigation, you could sail using digsite interface, set up camps in hotspots and shit, all kinds of stuff damn
---
The implication to some of warding was that they wouldn't just add all the new gear to mob's drop tables, and that some of the gear would have upgrades (IE Cerberus Shoes) that require the base gear + warding anyway.
---
That, combined with item dissolving making everything's price kind of go up a little would have honestly been great. Maybe they'll add item dissolving to Magic.
---
Wow ok you caught a mistake in the math. You're still not making a point. Did you not get that the entire argument is that not even one of the worlds superpowers uses a 3/4 majority as its standard for democratic consensus?
---
Still mad about 2016? Just wait until 2020
---
Hello very sad.
---
I was going to upvote this, but I saw it had 788 upvotes
---
OH WOW ITS LIKE YOU GET WHY THAT ARGUMENT IS TOTAL BULLSHIT!! 
---
Gg for you, gf and all that. Have an upvote.
---
We cant know and wont know how this skill could have effected the game and the economy.
---
As far as any of us know, it was a new skill that did stuff. The beta phase would have started if the yes passed. From there the actual theory crafting could start.
---
Ratifying a Constitutional Amendment requires a 3/4 majority.
---
allright boys, unload the 'warding fails' meme folders. My body is ready.
---
...RUNEcrafting.

It has been happening since mostly 2000 that the political left started targeting Reagan's legacy as some sort of stain on American history.

Increasingly polarized politics in America is to blame.
---
Welp, sounds like I'm getting up at 6 am as well tomorrow. See you in Priffdinas!
---
What the fuck.
---
Warding loses fairly (like every other poll):
---
Polling is fucked, corrupt, that guy who bought an ad swung the whole damn thing, No Vote farmers.
---
Do you use items from those additions?
---
If you never heard of it, you wouldn't be "quitting the game xd" right now.
---
You mustve never been to the GE. you see, people dont go to the ge to bank. They go there to buy and sell items, hence the name grand exchange. The only people who dont have a reason to go there are ironmen. I talk to plenty of high level players. Especially with the time i spend on the top level of mlm where everyone has plenty of skillcapes
---
Here it is.
---
The fact that a new skill can't seem to get voted into the game.
---
You are asking what the Ahrim's set is good for? The only reason I can think to use the whole set would be pking
---
Yeah VidZarg doesn't seem to understand that the number of votes is completely irrelevant. All that matters is the % of votes for yes/no. Which was less on this than sailing. So yes my argument is valid, the # of total votes doesn't mean jack shit
---
I think people just don't want a new skill tbh, but that's just my observations
---
Yup dungeoneering is honestly the best skill ever introduced into runescape
---
This is ridiculous hahaha I love it!
---
Someone said Jagex said that if it failed they'd scrap the idea, but who knows.
---
Dont worry dude. I downvoted because of the woosh.
---
Could just make alts a bannable thing again, like it was during rs2
---
Imagine being this distraught over 40 hours of bankstanding for mid level combat gear
---
I'm sorry but why are you talking about cooking? Cooking isn't at all comparable to other buyables. Currently 200m cooking costs approx 110m, 200m con costs around 3b. Crafting is around 1.5b - I imagine warding would lie around there.
---
You obviously haven‚Äôt tried out the new boss lol? Definitely doesn‚Äôt take high level gear. Neither does Jad and neither do quests.
---
Dude people saying slayer is the best are crazy. Its like the farming guild. Go grow a yew tree but instead go kill fire giants but people go fucking nuts over killing big red fire guy like lmfao
---
idk what the correct answer is, but creating a beta just is not a realistic option. I think Warding was just a boring idea and not all that useful if I am honest. I would truthfully prefer seeing the other two skills reworked and polled again. I think if they were to put the same amount of time and revising into sailing, it could very well pass a poll.
---
It is probably too late for artisan now, but people obviously like the idea of it. Farming contracts were very well received, and it is a very similar concept.
---
A lot of arguments against warding were to do with RC. Quite a few people suggested that we can just throw it in with RC instead of it being its own skill.
---
I don't agree with it personally, but I'd rather see some of the new interesting content they were going to release be brought into the game somehow, even if it is through RC.
---
mm2 monkeys are not undead
---
yea sure, at least that makes sense as a skill. my #1 problem with updates in this game is lowering difficulty, and my #2 is content that is non-sensical
---
Emily
---
yeah because it wasnt slayer
---
&gt; Yknow, I didn‚Äôt like warding much but I voted yes because I wanted more content in the game generally.
---
This is, in my opinion, the defining feature of how this subreddit discusses warding. I don't think very many people care too much about this skill in particular. I think for most, it fills the abstract void of "New skill" and therefore gets votes. I also think this mindset explains why redditors speak of no voters the way they do. They just want new content for the sake of new content and so they assume no voters are voting against new content for the sake of voting against anything new. 
---
In my case, I read the blog and I don't think warding looks like a fun skill. It's not something I want to have to train and I don't think it adds much to the game. I'm not against a new skill, just this new skill. I applaud Jagex for trying to think of new things but I voted no on this one because it does not look fun.
---
Chaotics already exist as watered-down versions
---
It is also about consistency, and I feel like they track clicks more than just what tick it was on. If you have a few hundred/thousand clicks all 5ms of margin between them, you can probably conclude that it is a bot.
---
Zeah library isn't too bad for uims
---
That is the crux of the issue for me. The way people are talking you'd think this was some huge revolutionary thing that would massively improve the game. It's not. I actually voted yes, but I cannot fathom why so many people are so upset at its failing. It's not a big deal.
---
Yeah 90% of this subreddit is cancer right now. The other 10% is actually some really interesting discussions about polling in general/new skills in general, which is the only reason I'm still browsing.
---
Im so happy it didnt pass
---
That‚Äôs a reach
---
I was thinking the opposite, 788 players is an extremely low number compared to the percentage of people who skip ordinary questions.
---
The amount of "it's a nice idea but why don't you just add it to x skill or make it a minigame" comments to EVERY SINGLE SUGGESTION are pretty impressive
---
I mean 66% of the community voted yes so isn't not implementing it saying fuck 66% of the community?
---
Daily reminder that Jagex fucks up at every opportunity but has a higher voting threshold than the goddamn constitution.
---
I pray for you little man
---
I mean it *is* what the majority wants. just not the overwhelming majority
---
maybe more brainlet memes would have worked
---
To all the people that are gonna rip on the bad editing I have one thing to say.
---
Definitely my favourite part of the design! I can see it passing the 75% mark if it isn‚Äôt tied with Warding and can‚Äôt be combined with the tomes damage bonus.
---
worked out real well for ya huh
---
Slayer is pointless as an actual skill. The mechanics could still be in the game but without the tier aspect
---
eh you gotta play by the rules to have your opinion noticed. A lot of times I post these things its for discussions sake
---
kill. I ninja edited, but you caught it before
---
All of this was done in vegas and effect wise It's pretty simple honestly. 
---
I used 3 effects, twixtor for the smooth slow motion, theres preset color corrections on vegas, I used "deep contrast" for one and a magic bullet fx called "mojo II". Other than that It's just pan and cropping.  If you were looking for a form of guide/tip I'd probably have to make a vid showing it.
---
dumbest reason I've heard so far for voting no but hey you got what you wanted, gz
---
Exactly this
---
That's actually not how EoC happened. EoC happened because Jagex saw Guild Wars 2 hit the scene and wanted to take advantage of what was potentially ground-breaking MMO gameplay.
---
If you look at the timeline, the Guild Wars 2 beta opened in December 2011 and EoC went into beta in February of 2012 or so. Guild Wars 2 dropped in August of 2012 and EoC dropped in November of 2012. EoC and Guild Wars 2 both have a system of differentiated skills depending on what weapons you use, with different abilities for main-hands, shields, off-hands, and two-handed weapons. The Warrior class in Guild Wars 2 has an adrenaline system where certain skills are available to use depending on how much adrenaline the warrior builds up over time in combat, which is the entirety of EoC.
---
Also, there was the temporary content in RS3 where it was a Lumbridge warzone where Saradomin fought Zamorak. This event dropped a few weeks after Guild Wars 2's Living World Season 1 began, which involved temporary content that drastically changed the game world.
---
Anyways, I'm getting off topic. I am a huge conspiracy theorist in the camp that Jagex copied ArenaNet. Point is, end game players did not want EoC when it was released. The system sucked. Heck, no one really wanted EoC. It looked like higher ups just saw a game on the horizon that suddenly took the MMO world by storm and Jagex wanted a piece of the action. There were stories with evidence that content creators of the time were paid by Jagex $1000 each to just try EoC and say it was fun.
---
While it's true Runescape 3 is dying because the game caters too heavily to the endgame, EoC was not the fault of the end game players.
---
Then the game will be dead in 2/3 years lol. You need new content and why the fuck can't you do both? But sure.
---
Probably not, but a lot of people have alts with membership anyways.
---
This is such a stupid analogy and not at all the same thing, that‚Äôs just people that didn‚Äôt vote at all
---
If you‚Äôre going to count those that didn‚Äôt vote as a ‚Äúno‚Äù then you have to count all the tens of thousands of current members that didn‚Äôt vote on this poll as a no too, and it would have lost by an even bigger percentage.
---
runelite+ has no affiliation with runelite, regardless if its open source, id still highly advise against using it, not only could your account be compromised but you could also be banned.
---
I figured they can put NPCs in some of the Skilling guilds and give out contracts like the farming guild does.
---
So salty ü§£ü§£ü§£

Herblore 2: Herblore Harder
---
No its the nature of the system itself, how 9% of the community can block content (With alts) because it needs 75% to pass
---
I would vote yes on combat skills, construction, farming, agility, and thieving. [I wrote my reasons out here, if you're curious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cha5zz/pretty_much_how_the_warding_poll_went/eurrwut/_)
---
They mentioned during the livestream they're going to poll whether the community wants a new skill or not. The answer to that might prove how problematic the situation is.
---
Imagine if that poll hit 80%, which it certainly could, that seems reasonable. Compare that to the threshhold though, and you've basically got a 5% leeway to work with. That would be a skill that is so all-encompassing that *only* 5% of the playerbase dislike the conceptual idea of it. 
---
That is an impossibly high demand - you've got a situation wherein 80% of people want a skill, but a good 90% of *those* people need to like the concept of it to get into the game. 
---
That doesn't even get much better if the poll hits 85-90%, and I don't know I feel like it won't get higher than that.
---
&gt;Sick, any chance you'd be willing to delve into how you do these kinds of effects / visuals for the less informed?
---
SMORCCCCCCCC
---
Even Firemaking made perfect sense when it was released. At the time, the game had:
---
\- No item banking
---
\- No noted items
---
\- No running
---
\- Very few ranges
---
If you wanted to resupply while grinding mobs, you would either have to walk all the way back to one of the ranges to cook more food, or (the much faster option) light a fire and cook stuff as you caught/killed it. There was only one type of tree in the game at the time, and the sole point of woodcutting and firemaking was to make the process of 'setting up camp' between kills go a little faster. The game changed over time, but even until RS2 came out, you still could only light normal logs: a mechanical relic that betrayed the skill's intended function.
---
Pretty much every skill in runescape (save maybe construction) had a fun and mostly organic function when it was released. They became worse over time because the fundamental structures of the game changed around them, but they didn't start off bad. Even fletching and herblore were impossible to bankstand when they came out (in the era 'certificates'). At first, there wasn't even a way to note/bank the fletching logs! 
---
This was my biggest problem with warding. Because of things like banking, the GE, etc., most skills are now a burnt-out wreckage of what they once were. The design of warding made no effort to account for the developments that damaged these skills‚Äîunlike, say, the 2006 skill Hunter, which tries very hard to keep you isolated, self sufficient, and far away from banks. Instead, warding meekly reproduced the ashen corpse of a 2002 Runescape classic processing skill, as they exist in the modern 2019 game. And why would I vote for a pile of digital ash?
---
Ironic coming from someone who goes by u/420Blazeboy
---
Ironically I think the Slayer Helm kind of takes away from it since you unlock it so early and the whole point of it as a skill is that you need special gear and techniques to kill the monsters
---
How many people do you know high alching bandos chestplates and other higher end items? Dumb ass!

I'll be spite voting anything max toons or pkers like for awhile.  I'm pretty bitter about it.
---
But then you think of it this way - the devs spent time communicating and designing things and it still didn't pass. 9% short from passing. With all the effort put in... and yet we can't have a new skill after 6 years. Three skills in that time failed. We'll never see a new skill, period.
---
Another thing to consider - what in the game is so good that 75% of players genuinely like? Very few things. All are probably pvm related.
---
He's warding
---
and then he's rewarding.
---
Think about it.
---
You're glad it failed because people posted about it in the sub?  That's kindaaaa petty
---
Lol good point. Tho its crazy that the passing percentage is so high
---
But it wouldn‚Äôt be getting extra wc exp, it would be getting xp in a completely different skill that trains at 1/3 the speed. A lot of people are still training slayer at max cb.
---
I heard she is on the opposite side of the political spectrum now, but I haven‚Äôt looked into it much.
---
Dslayer is only the req for the green dhide body.
---
All the other dhide bodies can be used without doing the quest.
---
What other two? Just came back
---
Ooo how edgy
---
... And herblore?
---
Con is one of those "motherfucker I gotta beeline this" skills
---
Herblore is "Yeah man, I'll hit 80 by the end of next year :D"
---
Well yes but aren‚Äòt exactly these votes where it matters that you have to get that much?
---
When you make a new law in my country, you need 1/3 of politicians to be there and you need simple majority. But when you make a constitutional law, which is above all laws, you need at least half of politicians and you need a special majority of 2/3. 
---
Its because the importance of the poll that you want that majority. But this isn‚Äòt a law stating that a company cannot fuck around with your data. This is a company itself that will loose players if it doesn‚Äòt deliver what they want. So by minimizing player loss, you can keep making money. 
---
Or let me put it that way. Who is quitting because warding didn‚Äòt pass? No one. Who would quit if it passed? More than 0.
---
The ratio remains constant, sure. But only if everyone has the same number of alts. As soon as one person doesn't have the same as another, the proportions swing. And given that it doesn't take a simple majority to pass, you still have to concede that if I have 1 alt and vote no with it and my main, you have to have 5 alts and vote yes with all of them to counteract me and bring it to barely passing.
---
Old skills being bad is not an argument for adding another bad skill, if anything, its the literal opposite, if bad/boring skills exist in the game (and they do) they should be fixed before adding more bad/boring skills into the game.
---
I think it should be 70% to pass... I mean, when I was in school a 70% was a passing ‚ÄòC‚Äô
---
I mean, your implied opinion is just as selfish. "I want this skill so others should have to deal with the repercussions of it even if they don't want it."
---
Never going to happen because people gonna be reeing how it devalues their hardworked 77 rc.
---
Good now I don't have to go back to that dump and work a new skill
---
&gt;n
---
doesnt even matter anything that boosts exp rates with something fun/boring will "devalue my effort"
---
Yeah but no votes are weighed so heavily so it gives incentive to the minority to use alts, also most people who voted 'no' have the money and time to vote with alts.
---
And warding is bad because?
---
Where can I find the results from this [unofficial poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHIbrYptXR44g1fGfh-7S8XFcggMpyeESIb_bIEkU2RNphew/closedform)?
---
Imagine thinking that Warding would attract new players. Also I love how all of these posts say "well what if Warding helped" but none of them consider if the player count would have decreased had Warding passed since that's just as likely of an outcome
---
I'm not sure.
---
My prediction was the crystal keys would rise.
---
I bought 200 for 4.5m and sold today for 6m
---
Going forward the discussion should absolutely be there, there is no reason for it not to be.
---
Minority rule only builds resentment.
---
Ahh okay the more I know
---
My points not valid now,
---
The same neckhards that voted down warding would do the same for sailing
---
Bye then! üôÇ
---
Yeah you don‚Äôt really make any money with slayer until like level 60+ by once you are there it‚Äôs a pretty solid way to get you some gp and good exp
---
Also, you‚Äôll have to do it eventually and low level slayer is so shit when your already good combats
---
Blowpipe is quite dominant but other range weapons aren‚Äôt almost useless because of it like they were compared to chaotics. 
---
Compared to blowpipe chins are better xp per hour, crossbows are cheap to use and hit hard and even allow players to use shields. Crossbows also use bolts which have different effects when enchanted. Throwing knives are the highest dps in many pking situations especially when used by voiders. Not to mention the variety of ranged special attacks in the game such as dark-bow, ballista, dragon throwing axe/knives, magic short-bow and magic longbow. Craws bow also out dpses blowpipe and is the highest dps in most wildy situations. You have a point but you seem to have forgotten the dominance of chaotics.
---
Truth be told that was already more than informative! I've been looking to make some backdrops that are more than just static or silly gifs and might just look into grabbing decent screen clips to mesh up
---
This is severely disappointing. We'll never get a new skill in old school.
---
Won‚Äôt not having new skills keep it old school? I like the new/different bosses and armors. But we could have had 3 new skills by now and it takes away from the 07 scape we know and love
---
This is soul crushingly accurate.
---
&gt; He is saying that he believes there was no chance that warding would do nothing other than improve the game, and if not, it wouldn't hurt the game.
---
Bruh really?
---
But yea the only response i need to all that is "opportunity cost"
---
This is why we will never get a skill. Stupid ignorant people
---
hence the whole point of the 75% "overwhelming majority" threshold.
---
&gt;ITS NOT FALSE INFORMATION IF I BELIEVE IT
---
Why? 
---
People would just make more alts and buy bonds to prevent the majority of players who want it from getting it; then proceed to ask for the content to be added anyway, but under a pre-existing skill that they don‚Äôt like to train.
---
Omg wow, 9 whole people in 3 years. Jagex has 337 employees and only 22 of them are osrs mods. Only 7 of those mods are content developers. They know throwing more devs at osrs would end up being a waste cause polls like this will never pass.
---
Can I see your dictionary? You must have a different edition than me, because your definition of ‚Äúvast‚Äù clearly differs from mine
---
Just so you can feel something, anything.
---
Do people really program bots to say nice?
---
How do you get mtx from wanting exp trackers that are already available using runelite?
---
7,369 maxed normal accounts, but there are A LOT more that are close to max
---
50 RC for devious minds, you need 70 agility for song of the elves.
---
I wouldn't have thought alts were a big deal until I saw so many people saying they were going to vote on 5+ of their alts.
---
They should publicly name all the no voters
---
What was the first? Woox completing inferno for the first time?
---
Based on basic principals on how polling and statistics work.
---
Every single question failed. No.
---
This kind of shit is depressing, there's likely never going to be a new skill because of the attitude of a certain portion of the community. I've been playing since 2003, so I get that there's purists that want to keep the game as fundamentally the same as when they first brought back oldschool. I also get that having another 99 to get up is a pain in the ass, especially if it ends up being one you don't enjoy.
---
but damn.. part of the oldschool feel for me was when a new skill came out, there was so much energy and excitement the first couple weeks a skill came out. Remembering as a kid when hunter came out, or the countless hours spent at house parties, messing around with glitches when construction was released... To see a well thought out skill get canned when there's so much potential for growth, yeah depressing to say the least.
---
You joke but Jagex has done this in the past to get some things passed.
---
Ah yeah, that's true. I don't really know the ins and outs of RWT lol. I hadn't considered that they probably could not/would not buy all at once.
---
Nice.
---
Personally I felt like the skill didn‚Äôt have anything to offer after you already hit certain milestones in the game. I know bis gear wouldn‚Äôt be a thing but they should have found a way to give later lvls of warding to tie into raids gear. Just my honest opinion on why I voted no.
---
Right but imagine if construction let you make your houses fight each other or take them on randomly generated adventures with loot at the end.
---
Isn‚Äôt a new skill new content? I just want more things to click on. Bottom line. There isn‚Äôt really an argument here
---
And like I said, the 75% threshold is something I disagree with.  I think it will hurt the long term health of the game.  I used the poll to create OSRS as an example of a time when it was a good thing that Jagex didn't get 75% of their players to approve something.
---
I think warding/new skills in general failing is an example of where it's bad that Jagex required that 75%
---
I watched half of a small raid team dump more than 400m into bonds to vote no. To say it doesn‚Äôt exist is laughable.
---
U mad?
---
Give this to me as a mini game but I wouldn't vote for it as a "skill". Dungeoneering was fun but not truly a skill tbh and I just imagine sailing turning out like the garbage you do for the bone voyage quest. I know this is a meme post but it does sound like a possble fun mini game truly.
---
"wow you wasted the chefs time by sending back this raw meal"
---
&gt;There are countless amounts of people that do it.
---
I disagree and think that is unreasonable. Did you yourself do it? I did not and I have played since release with a wealthy account.
---
Yes, happy something new is being added to do. These people are happy something new was not added so others can't enjoy it.
---
imagine current year
---
removed it, doesn't make my point any less clear.
---
Exactly this whole thing is pretty sad actually.
---
Why would you not be allowed?
---
Which side has new players that just clicked yes because they see something new.
---
I‚Äôd like to see a huge poll like this if they somehow had the ability to block alt accounts from participating. If such a thing was possible I wonder if the vote changes would‚Äôve been large or minuscule.
---
Sure. I could, or instead of wearing melee armor to mage in, they could expand the pool of usable mage armor.
---
Why did the poll fail? Over 66% of players voted for it. The future of countries has been decided with less of a majority. Presidents have taken power with even less of a majority!
---
Yeah people don't understand that an item sink was added in RS3 to help the very broken item economy at the time
---
It wasn't one of the reasons the game went downhill, it actually served to lengthen its lifespan
---
impeach poll-booth for collusion
---
You have to use a css plugin. I don't use it tho because then I would be sus since nobody else is using it in the office.
---
wtf we can add dungeoneering without making it a skill
---
I agree. This process would almost certainly guarantee a skill being added that works with the community.
---
Also fair to say NOT EVEN 2/3rds
---
A majority was for it. Gotta count for something right.
---
 * Plays Runescape
---
Yep, confirmed dweeb.
---
Well... I considered coming back to the game for the sake of trying out a new skill. but now i probably wont, oh well.
---
Hexis alts alone was 4000 no votes, this got massively manipulated.
---
Happy. It wasnt right.
---
Man I really hope they revisit it. Obviously they're going to do a bit of searching to see if people want a new skill at all ever.
---
But I didn't know much about sailing until today, and then I went back and read the dev blog. It seemed SO COOL! Its basically what I would want in a new skill, so even if it doesn't get added, I hope they make something similar. Either a new skill or just a new component of the game.
---
Yup which is fine, they are NERFED chaotics; which makes them ok. They were overpowered, now they're balanced. What I'm saying is we shouldn't get unnerfed chaotics.
---
how dare you assume my race, bwana?
---
\&gt;best possible content 
---
\&gt;another bankstanding buyable
---
Also trump became president with ~49% of the peoples vote... not everyone are as equal as others. Kappa
---
The supermajority requirement for a pass is completely different issue, that the community has voted on, and the results defined the marker(75%), Whining about how it's unfair when you don't get your way is useless. Not everyone can be pleased.
---
IIRC the only indications was that there'd be a way to train warding for it to be 'very expensive' (ex.: mahogany with construction) and take ~20-30h, 'small loss' (ex.: crafting with air battlestaves) and take ~60-80h or 'a profit' (unknow how much, probably little) and take up to 150h.
---
Yes and yes
---
The Russians hacked the polls
---
Jagex stated the max exp/hr would be around 400k. That is not 100 hours to hit 99.
---
No it's not , why do you think that's a general mindset for maxed players when barely anyone says that?
---
People want a new skill, just not a bankstanding buy able one. It's not that difficult to comprehend.
---
That would obviously be under "yes", as stated by your question.
---
Don't forget there's also a similar thing for combat skills. People rail hard against any suggestions of Summoning being reintroduced because it would upset the way combat already works.
---
Feels bad man.
---
They are going to poll it time and time again until it passes
---
Thank you for defending me.
---
And this why Reddit has a bad rep.And when people say but (X) is more afkable... My point is we shouldn't have AFKABLE Bank Standing.... Maybe I'm ignorant but I recall jagex saying it's a buyable for 40 hours.... Thats pathetic. And when people say (People hate time requirements...) Every skill has a time requirement hence the foundation of CML (ehp) .. 1600 hours to max iirc last checking.
---
The skill was only ~40 EHP to get 99 and is a bankstanding skill, most maxed people voting no didn't do it just because it was a new skill. I can't speak for everyone but prior concepts were broken for all levels and Jagex listened by basically providing nothing that would be useful past mid-game.
---
I have to admit I cannot fully blame you, the community is quite toxic at times in it's current state, especially when it comes to these kinds of situations. The problem is that the toxicity is so overwhelming in the group mentality, that any attempt to genuinely fight the toxicity without being toxic yourself is simply futile. It feels like a downward spiral...
---
Wyrms die super quick. Just blowpipe it with protect from magic, it isn't harder than that.
---
Man I really expected more from 420Blazeboy. How could I ever have known he wouldn't be the most mature lad?
---
66.4% is a minority?
---
Support
---
Damn shame, I'd have loved a new skill
---
50m chins? Are you insane. I havent calced it so 50m worth of chins maybe. 50m chins is more than enough for 200m range xp
---
+1 combat outside of bossing was/is boring and a bigger slog than any of the current "skilling" skills in the game for me
---
Unless next poll is: Which skill should we implement (Warding, Artisan, Sailing)
---
ITT: People proving OP's point
---
Democracy!
---
Rip 1/25,000,000
---
inb4 50/50
---
uh so that's it? the entire developing of a fleshed out skill just into the trash can? seems like really harsh considering how close it came to passing
---
Cool
---
3t granite is 100k xp or more per hr depending on how high effort you go
---
Weird way to spell firemaking ?
---
I think the reason for this (people wanting pvm as a skill) is because a good chunk of players just don't enjoy skilling, they view it as a way of unlocking content. If i could achieve all the perks i could gain from skilling, through a more engaging method i would. I have no interest in training runecrafting because i find it boring, but i have an interest in the diary perks i gain from it such as noted dk bones, content i enjoy.
---
People aren't ever going to vote on what benefits the game as a whole, they're going to vote on what benefits their specific playstyle. If enough people feel this way (which i can fully imagine they do, but without data to support that its speculation) its always going to significantly hurt polls for any skill viewed as "similar to the rest of current skills". 
---
Another issue i see is, there's generally seemed to be some pandering to high level players with "prestige" skills, which i feel hurts chances of people wanting to introduce more opportunity for this to occur. 
---
I kind of went off on tangents and struggled to articulate here but yeah, some people just dont like skilling and the way polls work gives them a voice large enough to stop more of said content coming into the game.
---
A skill with more purpose like Artisan would be awesome people would have to skill and stuff, idk this was a really "cool" idea but def not worth being the FIRST new skill in this journey.
---
no, you can't lol, you can go up the other side and attack from there..
---
Its quite a cool questline! Gratz on the achievement!
---
That's probably because the no-voters just voted no on every question, not because they thoroughly reviewed each option.
---
Again that original poll is an absolutely terrible example that can‚Äôt be compared since there was no ‚ÄúNo‚Äù option so there is no way to know what the percentages would have been, so I remain unconvinced that 75% is too restrictive. There is tons of new content that is added to the game even in spite of the 75% threshold, new bosses, raids, zeah, skill updates (farming guild, zeah rcing) fossil island, new quests, tons and tons of things that haven‚Äôt halted the progress, just new skills, which are not integral to progression of the game
---
Again, you have no way of knowing that without any actual statistics. You're just making shit up to support your delusional POV and then claiming it as 'facts'. You can't do that. I agree those people exist, but I really doubt your claim that they're large enough in numbers that 75% is unattainable for a new skill.
---
Well it kind of forced you to do it. Normally a mini game is not required to unlock content with a few exception Dungeoneering had a level attached to it meaning unless you wanted level 1 Dungeoneering you had to level it. 
---
I agree though I did enjoy doing it for a while
---
There's only one solution
---
SAILING BABYY
---
That's a really pathetic reason imo. The quest cape doesn't stop there being new quests, the music cape doesn't stop there being new music tracks and the diary quest doesn't stop there being new diaries. If players were as narrow minded as you when voting, then osrs would never recessive a single update and the game would die.
---
Saying that warding is necessary to save the game is like saying that if we didn't have crafting, the game would have died years ago. New content is necessary, but only if it's good content. I don't think that the staunch "I vote no on everything because I hate new content" voter actually exists. I think most "no" voters did so because they looked at this piece of proposed content, read the blog, and thought this particular suggestion was not a good one. I really don't think there are many new players thinking "If I don't get to bankstand for 40 hours, then I'm not gonna invest in this game."
---
The sad thing is that its solo content :/
---
&gt;We're going to do more digging into whether there's general appetite for a new skill - and if so, what that should look like and how it should be brought into game.
---
Jagex news post today. If there is no support for any skill, or if it's too difficult to find what kind of skill would get support Jagex won't do a new skill. My bet is that Jagex will come up with a skill like Hunter or Divination. You gather materials and some of the materials you gather at higher levels or below efficient exp rates will be worth money. The challenge is finding such a 'gathering' skill that thematically fits. Warding fit very well thematically, but had little else going for it.
---
Thank you for proving my point.
---
Once again a minority deciding what happens to the game =/
---
not everyone would use that 400k xp/h method.
---
It's weird, there are actually people who have literal billions in the game from flipping, etc. It is plausible that for an important poll, a small number of these people with combined hundreds of billions of gold could disrupt the vote quite significantly. Why they would bother doing that is answered in the same way as to why they have billions of gold in the game; they are obsessed with the game.
---
Whether this actually happened is debatable, though, and I don't think it was the main problem with Warding.
---
They‚Äôre insane. I dont have the calcs for it but that number is so far off its not even funny. Possibly 50m worth of chins. But 200m chins would be ample chins for 200m range xp
---
Question: Why?
---
Then why not fucking say "why don't you want a new skill?"
---
He never said he doesn't want new content, so the basis of your question is non-existent.
---
[An actual picture of ironmeme guide users when fm and wt gets deleted](https://i.imgur.com/fijYhTE.jpg)

This is literally exactly the problem with "democracy" in America- I really hope you see how fucked that mentality is.
---
"I mean yeah if you have an extra 12 bucks laying around your vote should definitely count 3x as much as the average person's"
---
I'm voting no of it cums to it daddy
---
sailing
---
Wasn't too excited for warding but voted yes for the sake of a new skill. I really want sailing. I hated dungeoneering, but I feel in a island exploring atmosphere and ship building I would love it. Would use construction, smithing, crafting, combat, and you had to risk your items and could bring friends. 
---
I think there was ship battles. It sounded amazing.
---
Pker's aren't openly accepting warding just to get a couple of new pieces of gear lol
---
Any reason you're not boosting the diary req from level 82/83?
---
Yeah I just started grinding my stats this month and all I need to do now is complete ME1 and 2. All skills and other quests done.
---
when you buy it with gold some one else had to buy it with real cash, bonds just dont appear out of thin air.
---
That says a lot actually. Slayer is a very popular version of it, and contracts are fairly popular these days, yet Artisan failed. Dungeoneering is highly requested and Sailing was talked about back in 2008, but Sailing failed too. They realise that they can't deviate too far from the Old School formula else people will claim it's a minigame masquerading as a skill, or that it doesn't fit...so they naturally pitch Warding as the most Old School skill of all. A buyable with a traditional gameplay loop. And it fails. 
---
We're never getting a new skill. And I honestly think that sucks. At this stage I almost want them to just release the next skill into the game and then poll improvements after.
---
Plenty of new and interesting stuff has passed the polls. The new grandmaster quest releases tomorrow with a new city and items. If warding really sways your opinion color me shocked. 
---
The no'rs are just trying to avoid bad content, you know. The reason that osrs and classic wow are being so heavily hyped and played.
---
skip
---
I think its pretty honest, there are more yes voters in total but that says absolutely nothing about the ratio of hardcore players.  I'd say the hardcore voters lean more towards no from what I've been seeing.  In 2k total worlds many people were against it, in 2.2k most people were against it, in most clan discords I have access to they were talking about voting no on their alts as well
---
Buy high then use bank incinerator when you can't shift them because you took merching advice from reddit 2 days before the update.
---
Sailing poll: *inevitably fails*
---
me: I cant... I'm not strong enough...
---
This is so disappointing. I feel like this skill would have fit osrs quite well. I feel like a lot of people want osrs just to stay the same as it was in 07. But... We're way past that, this game has evolved a lot. The skill might have been a little boring or even buyable, but I think it was perfect to compliment crafting and smithing. Why shouldn't we have warding? Really? It fits extremely well. I understand why sailing failed. But they went back to the drawing board and made a skill runescape needs. A skill that's missing that it should have. That fails too.
---
I don't get this community. Stupid shit that totally doesn't fit the game gets passed, and stuff that would fit fails? It wouldn't bother me if people didn't argue that it doesn't fit the spirit of game. If we were all honest, people just don't want to grind more. I bet that's all it is.
---
It's so pointless though. Bronze-rune armor just isnt used very much and because of this they all sit at alch price and this makes smithing expensive. You spend a bunch of money to make dead content armor that just gets alched.
---
LMAO? They game has a immense amount of content this is what makes games go donw hill, people  like you expect new content every month. The game has a lot of things that needs fixed with it and adjusted.
---
get kourend 4
---
Us Vs them is very prevalent on this sub.
---
Booooo
---
I really liked the idea of a new skill but just didn‚Äôt really think warding was right. This is easily the best idea I have seen on this sub in awhile, you have my upvote
---
The real drag is getting 77 rc. Lavas suck ass. Bloods are chill
---
6:30 for east coast would be 3:30 for west coast just FYI
---
It's currently 2:40PM in Oregon and 5:40PM in NYC
---
I know of a few people personally who voted in the hundreds on either side, even I've got a few accounts to vote with that I use for other things and I by no means play this game in any efficient manner.
---
Reddit for sure caused a bunch of no votes
---
Wtf is it with this community and gatekeeping. Seek help.
---
Warding is the 3rd skill to fail the poll right? Eventually those that vote no are going to want a new skill and im afraid jagex wont want to bother with it. Not saying that this is what they'll do just that its a possibility
---
&gt;Next up they'll ban eating meat in public 
---
&gt;and ban bacon 
---
good ideas tbh
---
Can you explain why you feel that way, though?
---
Explain how I'm wrong. You just made things up.
---
Now delete all the votes that came from accounts that didn't have at least 6 months of concurrent membership. Curious to see how that would change things.
---
Boy do I have the post for you https://i.imgur.com/Txy1maX.png
---
That‚Äôs odd. Most other voting systems only allow one vote per citizen and not one vote for every dollar spent in that systems economy. 
---
And someways allowing one vote per account could be considered a type of micro transaction as you‚Äôre receiving additional benefits in exchange for money spent.
---
&gt;Jagex knows what the players want. No MTX, meaningful updates, no powercreep, etc...
---
Unfortunately, I have to disagree. We've had polls in the last 3 months that show that Jagex is still out of touch with the community in a big way - most recently being the Partnership poll, but also the Elf-related changes including the Underground Pass skip.
---
No you dont.  Everyone‚Äôs vote should count 1...
---
OSRS veterans will never let a new skill pass, shame, I was really looking forward to it, let the game evolve and get some new content for christ sake.
---
Yeah it did convince me. There is cool stuff coming in, but it doesn't really seem like any really big updates ever pass. I was hyped for warding.
---
Well then you're the delusional one for thinking a skill exists 75% of players can agree on
---
788 people voted meh
---
Your question was what it was not what it did so i answered accordingly. If you wanted to know what it did then you should have asked that instead
---
If they can then why haven't they? It's been made clear on the subreddit here that it's an issue (people bragging *in this subreddit* about making alts and buying bonds to vote against warding/pvp). Either they can't or they don't want to. Regardless, the current polling system has a lot of issues in my eyes.

So poll it as a mini game, or would the neckbeards get mad that it‚Äôs not a skill despite sounding fun as Rick?

That‚Äôs exactly what he‚Äôs saying and I‚Äôm not sure how he can claim the other side needs statistics to say that no voters have a higher percentage of alts but he can safely claim there are 3x as many yes alts as no alts

&gt;Player to player interaction
---
Yeah that was fun standing around for an hour trying to sell a bunch of shit while 25% of the people trading you try to scam your ass for a couple hundred K. God I miss that so much. 
---
Every time I go to the GE and see someone spamming "doubling money" or advertising some stupid RNG game or giveaway, I get really upset that I no longer have to interact with them to sell 400 sharks
---
warding is is literally a useless fucking skill you can max in a few days if you have money and once thats done, and the people who only made it to like lvl 70 will be like im bored new content!!!
---
How did you come to that conclusion?
---
Additionally, I wanted to see it pass just to see how the beta went. So many people didn‚Äôt give it a chance, when we as a community could have shot it down as soon as the beta went live.
---
No lol warding is shit content and we don't want to train it. And before you say "tHeN dOnT" SOME of us want to max eventually and didn't want to be forced to train it. 
---
Your side's arguments were hilarious to read too. Especially the ones trying to say how unnessesary other skills are. What was the big point of that argument? These other skills are "unnecessary" so why not add another pointless skill? Genius
---
Game needs to evolve and get new content, but it has to be done right. The game literally died a few years ago, long tenured players know the importance of this.
---
i have a wife, kid on the way, and own a home that i take care of myself, i still find time to play.
---
FPTP vs Proportional rep?
---
I vote no to Pk polls and no to warding
---
OSRS is so deeply complex and diverse that the current skills perfectly suffice for an almost endless adventure. The current skills have the ability to expand infinitely but only need to be combined perfectly with another part of the game.
---
Till 66% of the total votes is not the majority.
---
Practically this exact meme posted the other day, nice.
---
So they can add new content as long it isn't a new skill?
---
How comes you're going 85 cons and not 82/83?
---
You didn't like having someone come up to you and try to scam you every 10 minutes?
---
So much edge ya became a square.
---
I would say that you're entire attitude is toxic to anyone elses opinion but your own. You've been nothing but a twat this whole conversation when I was being pretty courteous to you through most of it. 
---
The entire game is meaningless numbers dude. If you're this upset about it then you need to check your priorities tbh, I have 6000 hours in this game and I'm not this angry about the game slowly being ruined for me. Don't worry, one day we'll all quit when it goes to far and you can enjoy your RS3 knock off.
---
Why. If you invest more into the game you shouls geta bigger say in the future of it
---
It's fine money for the level, but that's not the point. Profit spikes up much higher between 75-99 Slayer, and 300k/hr is nothing compared to the 2m+ of Hydra or Cerb.
---
Lmao so you think warding (i.e. *content*) was designed by a community manager and some artists?
---
If they are just bots I assumed nothing.
---
I am pleased this failed. I want new skills in the game. I just don't want rehashed boring skills in this game.
---
nah I don‚Äôt browse Reddit that often tbh. But twitter is filled with no voters, so that‚Äôs where I came up with my conclusion
---
Ofc it's still a CC :P Getting bigger and better every day, drop by and hang out!
---
&gt; wayyyyyy more afk than any other combat training method
---
Is there anything more afk than NMZ?
---
I mean they may have voted no on those things as well. I voted yes here, but there were updates in the past I hated and voted no on but used when they were in the game. The only two I completely abstained from on the principle that they were ruining a part of the game are Zeah RC and NMZ. I imagine I'm pretty much alone in shunning an efficient afk method just because I was so vehemently against their implementation
---
It means someone sniped your name and has it on a level 3 account - all 1 stats.
---
It seems there are a group of people that are literal die-hard fans of it saying you can‚Äôt be banned and will attack anyone saying it is bad. Becareful of these people because it can easily just be a bait for you to think it is ok. There should always be skepticism in these third party clients
---
every paying account should get 1 vote
---
What in the world are you on about? How does this have anything to do with warding?
---
Only one guy said that and it sounds like he's either near max or maxed within like 6 months or something. 
---
There's plenty of reasons to not like warding when not really a skill and just a bunch of hotfixes pushed together with dissolving and splashing being core to the skill. Those two things plus ring imbues would be controversial on their own. Its also the first time seeing most of the "other items" and armor special effects. So then Jagex asks "should the core skill of warding be added to the game" as in if this is passes you will get some kind of warding. Yet there hasn't been any major opinion polls about anything about specific parts of development. They haven't mentioned that there was going to be further development and voting after the beta on the actual poll question or whether the whole thing could be scrapped if things go wrong and they don't come up with anything that people are happy about. 
---
So for me the question is really do you trust jagex to make warding good. and its an obvious no for me
---
That...is a really negative look at the people in these situations. Change isn't always positive, and it's rarely positive for everyone. The people displaced aren't critical because "change". 
---
There are upsides to bringing extreme wealth to an area. There are undeniable downsides as well.
---
I've posted something like this recently. A series of levels in a single explorable area, one for each biome and region.
---
The level you're in will be randomly generated and have a target/goal, like search and rescue, explore, empty the area of enemies, establish a base of operation, etc.
---
No you shouldn't... but there is no way to limit this in an effective and fair way.
---
Yeah. I really don't know my timezones
---
Imagine being this much of a try hard. Must be cool having no friends.
---
jeez what is this crap lmao
---
It's sad, but I agree with you. I guess the focus should be on exciting new content, areas, bosses, quests etc because skills simply don't seem to pass. And like you say, no matter how well it fits the game, a new skill is a new skill and inherently not old school.
---
It gives good advice for new players too! If you visit "Count Check" in the Lumbridge Cemetery he will send you there one time free of charge.
---
I made a decent profit doing that with purple sweets when they tanked after the inferno announcement.
---
If anyone thinks about doing that then don't be stupid and buy items that have no real uses or demand. Oh and also don't sink all your cash into them since it'll take a while for the price to start rising again.
---
Tbh id like to see a lot of fixes for making content more relevant.
---
But the new skill should be mostly instance, incredibly grindy, locked behind a ton of quests, AFK and overcomplicated.
---
That's the kind of insane shit this community wants. Some punishment for the prestige of actually doing it.
---
Wasn't soul wars affiliated to summoning?
---
So by your logic, rich people should get to vote more than poor people. Makes sense
---
Exactly and I found warding to be boring. And before anyone says x skill is boring well guess what, I trained runecrafting past 99 before zeah came out.
---
I just want sailing tbh.
---
50/50
---
Ahaha
---
r/toiletpaperusa
---
Most of the people in my clan were saying dumb reasons like this for why they were going to vote no, and trying to make the rest of the people vote no. It's so stupid. So so so dumb. They shouldn't even be allowed to vote if that's how their using their vote.
---
That's how democracy works. The average person votes in ways they think will benefit them the most.
---
Now if the average person is an idiot....things can turn out quite terrible.
---
I guess he means in comparison to other skills?
---
I don't think that's a fair assessment since the questions were very specifically asking whether the content in question should be added *to* Warding. It's disingenuous to assume everyone answered with the concept of said content being an individual addition in mind.
---
Here's the thing, the key will always open the chest in Taverly, and this is kinda why it's the price it is.
---
If the key rises more, Taverly chest will be dead content.
---
My guess is that the key will drop back down to normal price when people realise what the new chest holds, and also the fact that they need to combine the crystals with the key to make it the upgraded version. Probably means the price increase will balance out with those crystals funding the raise, and not the key itself.
---
I just expected lots of people to buy them because they wanted to try the new chest.
---
Assuming you can afford it, cannoning with best in slot gear would make it the fastest. Cheapest option would be bone bolting there on crabs
---
Because warding would be so "complex".
---
Username checks out.
---
It's not. Only half of 102%.
---
I love how whenever I say something like this, everyone assumes I'm some tory.
---
This is what a good left winger thinks like (to be a bit cocky, sure).
---
You can't get blindsided by your own views. There's a difference between accepting debate, and accepting debate, if you know what I mean.
---
look if jagex came to you with a skill that provides the content you enjoy then youd want the skill. Im a pvmr so if they dropped a dungeoneering type idea with fun boses id be down. its just a matter of jagex creating content that doesnt fuck the game up but is wanted by a large portion of the game.
---
I would say it's just about outlived its usefulness rather than losing hope in it.
---
Voting yes memes were getting thousands of upvotes. Everyone suggesting no was getting downvoted into oblivion. You do the math.
---
Imagine getting mad at someone on the internet about runescape because he gave an answer to your specific question instead of writing a wikipedia article for you.
---
&gt;The piece of content is just as good within runecrafting. It honestly didn't feel diverse or big enough to be a seperate skill.
---
 The piece of content is just as good within runecrafting. It honestly didn't feel diverse or big enough to be a seperate skill.
---
the concept was pretty dogshit tbf most people just voting yes for fresh content regardless of how poorly designed it was.
---
I literally watched this one guy show off ten alts at once. All had purple graceful and were 126..... they started dancing in the ge....  it was insane
---
U want me to source that motivation affects action? The 2nd paragraph is basic psychology lol.
---
You don't know that. So you shouldn't say surely.
---
Passive-aggressively moping about *muh reely kewl idea!* not passing is not acceptance.
---
Thinking of starting an UIM. Whose got tips and tricks?
---
Chaos gauntlets, mystic, antifire shield, slayer(i), smoke staff  and occult necklace.
---
Super afk, reasonably profitable
---
Cool "I will never vote for anything that won't benefit my exact playstyle, fuck everybody else"
---
I guess splashing and bandits are just as afk, though less viable. But there is no (legal) way to afk more than 20 minutes.
---
Lmao you need more than a majority to get something added to this game, sorry &lt;3
---
Fuck yes! Warding was so lazy from the beginning. Come back with something better, Jagex!
---
It could be a a skill in the sense of the ship upgrades and leveling to go further out to sea and shit
---
Have you been on osrs twitter lately?
---
I wanted max cape to be cosmetic since it was polled, still do. Or at least nerfed a little bit to be more of a QOL cape instead of "BiS when skilling" cape.
---
On trivial shit, sure. On actual game impacting updates no. Lol. There's a reason splashing or NMZ still exist, and it's because of that 75% threshold.
---
"The poll didn't go my way so let's just change the system." You sound just like a left-winger.
---
Hopefully with good FPS to boot. Fingers crossed.
---
Idc any new content would be nice but with this community that will never happen
---
Really enjoyed the warding idea, but I‚Äôm personally not a fan of overloading pre-existing skills with content that barely fits. Sad to see such a promising idea go to waste though.
---
I sincerely hope you don't participate in voting IRL with that attitude.
---
Gotcha, its either that or a new buyable skill.
---
I'm not mad, just disappointed. This is exactly what I expected to happen, so it's hard to be frothing with rage when I'm just like "ya of course it failed" :/
---
Agree but don't touch rc
---
This is what happens when you can't have several characters on one account. Like you can in any other mmorpg.
---
I voted no to warding and ill continue to vote no to all of your pvp polls, bud. But thanks for the help
---
Yeah, no. People say they want a new skill, but they'll just nitpick anything that gets offered. I've watched it 3 times now. It's never happening. It hasn't even ever been that close. 68% is the closest we've been, and honestly I think Sailing would fail harder now than it did then, contrary to what some seem to think.
---
A single bad update (even if it's just bad for a specific player or group!) could be enough to get someone to stop playing.
---
Many medium updates don't meaningfully help player retention.
---
We therefore need to have high standards for what updates get into the game.
---
Words hurt me.
---
Black platebody(g), balenciaga 4,999 gp
---
It's a good thing they didn't do any programming, design, or very much modeling then. The blog post wasn't even that detailed. You could throw that together in an afternoon of brainstorming, and people on here routinely do. And this was even the second version.
---
Being challenging and fun to code -&gt; Unique
---
Warding is trained just like fletching and crafting so of course that won't be fun.
---
Oh yes, I can imagine there are undeniable downsides. Was just saying that it isn't surprising that these people are very aware of these downsides, as you explained how generational the towns are.
---
It was all voted no to anyways
---
Are you supposed to live off of minimum wage? I thought that was for like college kids. And I'm pretty sure you still can live off of minimum wage in the US. You just wont be able to afford luxuries that people most people are able to afford with a better paying job.
---
Every one of you that voted no can burn in hell.
---
Crack the clue 2 armor. Search Youtube how to get it
---
more simple classic looking gear
---
Being realistic, most of the old elves weren't the most well designed models in the world. They were also pretty much just the same model with palette swaps.
---
I think considering the scope of the update and the sheer number of elves with the different clans etc, it was probably the right decision.
---
Facts
---
Because the games grwoth has stagnated for over a year and only surged because of mobile?
---
OSRS is a great idea, but it fails in any way to actually appeal to new players. New people won't come and play the game so the stagnation will slowly bleed out.
---
Lmao the old ‚Äúcool down‚Äù routine, nice. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed it didn‚Äôt at least get closer so it would warrant more work to hit 75, it won‚Äôt personally affect anything I‚Äôm doing, so I really don‚Äôt care much. The point I was making was the comment I replied to was literally saying there‚Äôs no need for any updates ever because ‚Äúif there‚Äôs no changes then it‚Äôs still the same game we love already‚Äù. Which is just patently a mischaracterization or reality.
---
Yes, updates still regularly reach 75%. 90% of the time it‚Äôs just new slayer content, but still yes, new content comes into the game. However, there‚Äôs almost zero diversity to new content and not everyone enjoys every aspect of the game. PvM to me is generally extremely boring and I have no interest in a new 99 slayer boss or raids 3, but I still generally vote yes to those updates because they don‚Äôt negatively affect me and others can enjoy them.
---
However, new skills, warding or not, are basically essential to the game because it diversifies it. If you have levels 1-99 in a skill you can only fill it with so much stuff before it‚Äôs some horrible shit that is crafting right now, and guess what, if someone already has 99, it adds zero content for them.
---
In general, especially for skilling, less so for combat, filling in missing mid level content does nothing for the game and only adding higher level content does. Guess what, eventually you‚Äôll hit 99. Adding a new skill allows you to create an entire new aspect of the game to build from and add tons of new content for everyone regardless of if you‚Äôre a new level 3 or currently maxed. Sailing and artisan addressed this much better than just adding another production skill, but everyone kept asking for a skill more like warding when sailing and artisan were talked about and now everyone is saying it should be more like those skills.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm having fun since I came back to the game a few months ago, but after I get my quest cape and finish up a few achievement diaries I have little to no reason to play anymore and will likely just go on another break until there‚Äôs some decent large new content that isn‚Äôt just slayer 2.
---
Damnit
---
Dungeoneering
---
It's a majority, just not a super majority. Probably shouldn't use words you don't understand.
---
On issues that barely impact the game then yeah.
---
Content is being added. A new skill would just be more content, unlock more potential rather just adding stuff to existing. All I'm saying is it has been a long time, a new skill would be nice imo.
---
?
---
Fletching?
---
RC?
---
How many people who voted no are NOT in one of the following:
---
Maxed or close to max
---
PKers/slayers who are salty about NMZ imbue nerf
---
To be fair, most of the things polled are new slayer monsters, which nobody would vote no to. Any time any other change is suggested there's always controversy. Even something as simple as the spell book filter caused a shit storm
---
Thank you, lets go for 7
---
You lost! Get over it!
---
Slayer is more closely related to dungeoneering than to existing ones skills
---
Altho PVP is the only thing "esport worthy" in this game, guess what will get updates without your votes? "bud"
---
&gt; if they could somehow work in an item sink through it.
---
Maybe be able to feed items to an NPC or some container outside the Dungeoneering place which will, in turn, give you points for either a single Dungeoneering run or "X amount of Dungeoneering runs" which you can spend on better starting items?
---
The items fed will grant points in a given category depending on the item. For example, feeding 50 iron platebodies will give you enough points for a single armor piece that's as good as Black or Mithril armor, and feeding 100 Sapphire Necklaces will give you enough points for an amulet that's as good as 1/5th of an Amulet of Strength. Would that work?
---
It would be completely optional and you would no doubt be able to earn the most points by actually delving through the Dungeoneering instances. You can even put a cap on the total amount of spendable points so people aren't getting a ginormous start and making the entire run free, giving just enough of a push for players with shitty combat skills (or, for the other side of the spectrum, shitty gathering/crafting skills) to get through some of the earlier content.
---
It's almost like people don't want a boring 40hr bankstanding buyable. üòÇüòÇ
---
The strawman is strong with this one.
---
MBA, thanks tho
---
Why not remove them until they get reworked and pass a 75% poll?
---
And thats one sub-reddit out of hundreds.  And its no where near as actually active as a default sub if you are looking at comments and discussion instead of votes on 1-2 posts they push to the top.
---
But Warding was more of a sink that only added new gear.
---
Considering the vote was just for a beta server to test warding, I say they do it anyway and do the vote again afterwards. I bet it would be chill with everyone then
---
I voted yes to the poll, obviously.
---
Imagine mindlessly voting anything into the game
---
Then just make a new email with a whole new acc
---
Jesus that lightning is terrible, made everyone look like they have jaundice.
---
Runescape Esports sounds dogshit
---
&gt; 66% vote yes
---
&gt; omg reddit is such a vocal minority!1!
---
Fuck, had a response typed out then the mods blammed him, big F
---
Good, their efforts went to waste because instead of them working with the community to design the skill, they just came up with their own arbitrary ideas and flung it at us like shit on the wall. Their approach is completly wrong.
---
I would be salty too if I was a part of this dying pk community xD
---
Yeah, but not the worst strawman
---
Dungeoneering and Summoning,
---
This would never work for OSRS. The current dev team is too small to flesh out a skill from 1-99 for a preliminary poll on a skill that might not pass. They put a lot of work into the breakdown on the skill and said if it passes additional data will be gathered and more content will be reviewed.
---
I think they provided plenty of content ideas to build around. Several skills were released with additional content added after the fact. To think a skill has to be 'complete' before it exists is ridiculous.
---
Miss Binu22
---
Sailing
---
We did it Reddit! We ensured the game will stay the same! Keep your max and diary capes on Bois! /S
---
Slayer 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
Sailing wasn't a bankstanding buyable skill and it failed. Neither was Artisan. I'm sure whatever gets offered next (if anything) will have some stupid reasoning for why it failed, and why the next skill won't fail. Tired of these moronic nitpicking people that think they want a new skill but won't vote yes on anything.
---
Damn shame
---
It always bothered me that there's no point to this game. There's no satisfying story to play out. There's no character developments that mean anything. Every quest is done in pursuit of better gear or better moneymakers or better xp. And for what? To get to 99? And then just quit? There's no closure. 
---
It's all for nothing.
---
No... I wouldn't. I'm positive on that, I don't want a new skill.. Period.
---
Imagine being offered content and you said "yes"
---
Hey dmm was around for 10 seasons and lms will for sure be a big hit
---
i think it passed if minus the 10k maxed people that voted no simply to stay maxed
---
For some people it is. Honestly if people want to send a message then skillers should vote no specifically for any PVM or PVP updates
---
It might happen? I dunno.   
---
Coincidentally, Fluffy was telling me to do Zanik as well last night.
---
Scamming?  Most people weren't scamming you just used 3rd party sites and deals either came to you in the case of selling or you went to them.  It was great interaction.
---
&gt;Except something like that would get shot down because it wouldn't fit OSRS.
---
Exact same thing could be said for 90% of the stuff that's passed polls. The vast majority of people got over the "muh oldschool!!" thing long ago when it started to actually kill the game.
---
&gt;I'd say adding some actual proper gear scaling to Magic and filling the mage armor crafting gap is a step to making the game better.
---
Re-read the whole paragraph. The proposed rewards can easily fit into other skills and content, we don't need the skill itself to fix those issues. The actual skill itself doesn't really improve the game in any way, it's just a crafting reskin that 90% of the playerbase won't touch after the initial hype dies down.
---
Jagex will never give the same attention to community-driven content as they will to developer-driven content. 
---
Sounds backwards but their logic is something like ‚Äúwhat do a bunch of potheads and weeaboos know about running a game company?‚Äù
---
Location based Artisan from the start would be a dream.
---
Kinda like forced BTW or UIM mode for a skill.
---
Would give life to so many unused areas of the game that never get touched.
---
Also it really didnt help how they were fairly quiet about the skill for some months, giving people the impression that it was polled before and is being forced again. I've seen a number of people who had that impression
---
Whats 2k hours when you‚Äôre not employed and live with your parents am i right üòé
---
Well I would point you to my first comment in this chain then. Further showing your poor reading comprehension.
---
Yeah it's def going to inflate the price day 1, and they only said it's be slightly better than travely
---
However I don't think it'll make the old chest dead content. Sote is a huge requirement and most people running keys are really low levels that don't have reqs for anything else.
---
uhhh i have no clue what silver does tbh never got one but i guess ill say the barrelchest anchor? No clue tbh i was gonna say dragon sword too but w/e. Why tho?
---
woahhhhhhh good one dude!!!111!!!!1!

He got the big brain smol pp
---
shan't be reading a word of this
---
1876 hcim. Don‚Äôt ever PvP or care for it. I have an old normal account but only voted once. I simply didn‚Äôt want warding.
---
Guess that makes me a neckbeard?
---
I vote based off of question merit and my personal opinions. I‚Äôve voted yes to PvP polls even though I barely go in there do to not wanting to lose my status.
---
Instead of skipping it like pretty much everyone claims to, I just don't even vote on any poll.
---
I miss y'all too, when I can afford Xbox live, runescape and WH40K/AOS it will be quite the day
---
That happened
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt think any new skill would bring me back.
---
The only argument i have towards why people train herb (besides quests/diaries) is for raids 1, 78 herb for standard ovl or 90 herb for ovl+, although it's all tradeable inside it and some bosses drop them so it's not even 100% needed, just useful
---
so u want a dead new minigame? lol YIKES pls dont vote anymore ty
---
How's it feel knowing your skill doesn't have enough community support to be added?
---
Rofl not like you're giving a proper example, ur contradicting urself, get a grip m8
---
it's fun to watch the neckbeards cry and clench their max capes like pearls
---
What a terrible reasoning. Us "losers" didn't cause your content not to pass. Poorly designed content did that. LMS and DMM is testament to good PvP updates passing.
---
What's wrong with that?
---
I'm hoping the theme makes its way in, in whatever form.  We need more magical mysticism.
---
Thank you! I didn't see it in the blog, so I was confused

---
Yea, this is never going to happen. What devs will be willing on aiding a whole other separate OSRS? We need to be a little logical here.

The game doesn‚Äôt need new content because 33% of players said no? What about the other 66%? Do they not matter at all?
---
In approximately 11 hours.

Elf camp teleports dropped like 2.5k in a few hours today.
---
I doubt it.
---
I think most votes have been decent, not on this though
---
Ok, thanks. That's pretty stupid
---
Sorry it's not canon
---
I liked the idea of warding. Having a basic material, secondary skill, was great. But looking at what it offered was way too much, in a way too basic form. It‚Äôs just crafting over again. But now, instead of 4 types of armour (referring to green, blue, red and black d‚Äôhide, that‚Äôs linear scalable) you can suddenly make 12 different robe outfits with different form of tank-gear, mixed and clean mage included. With rings, imbue, dissolving etc. 
---
It felt like a skill that wouldn‚Äôt improve the quality of the game, but smash out a lot of needless items to make us feel happy, even though it contributed nothing to the game. It wouldn‚Äôt make it more fun or interesting. But make it so instead of wearing ahrim‚Äôs we would wear something else. 
---
That‚Äôs not really a skill I‚Äôd like. At least not over something like Sailing. Or a new skill that implemented a whole new form of training instead of simply bankstanding.
---
Fucking lame
---
Alternatively, there are a lot of people who DONT want a new skill at all. Combine them with people who think sailing is a meme skill that would be better as a minigame and combine them with spite voters. Then the alts.
---
If that number is 26% of the playerbase, which I strongly believe it will be, then Sailing will never pass.
---
Plus the more details we get, the more things for people to not like.
---
Someone doesn't want what I want, ergo they must not care about the games integrity.
---
What‚Äôs the mathematical basis for it being 75% for you to qualify it as a ‚Äúunanimous everyone agrees‚Äù? Why not 95%, 70%, or 66.4%?
---
You really think reddit has that much power? 1/10th of the users playing the game are on the sub right now and I guarantee many of those here haven't played in months
---
but then those wouldn't be disguised as plot. hmm? oh yeah we lost this blue crystal. i think those ogromogres drops that, after you have received that go to jangoharro to speak to ungohurro. Maybe you can even help father who has sick kid who looks like she's naked. I am not making this last part up. Relara Whitemoon, child who's sick looks like shes naked from certain angle, mostly because Blizzard had artist that desided to give her shirt that is EXACTLY same color as her skin. brav freaking o. only hinted nudity (there is no nudity because as i said, shes wearing shirt that is same color as her skin you can see shirt buttons near the pants) https://i.imgur.com/26nnTRc.png

Gonna reset my Defence and head to NMZ. Nice.

Most slayer tasks are pretty fucking afkable with a cannon or aggressive monsters.
---
I think Jagex made a mistake by exclusively polling for new content. They should just add some fucking content once in awhile without explaining it in painful detail &amp; polling it first lol. New surprise content was the #1 thing I enjoyed about the game back in the day...
---
I would like to see a poll with just the question: 'would you like a new skill ever to be added to oldschool runescape', to see if they would want a new skill, or they didn't like any of the skills proposed
---
This is an underrated comment, and it‚Äôs pretty deep...outside of OSRS as well.
---
Warding was poorly designed content, hence the no votes? 
---
And yes, people vote no just to fuck with pkers, what do skillers/pvmers care about how to gmaul works? Or magic spells on the normal spellbook vs other players?
---
You‚Äôre getting downvoted this heavily for asking a question. And these nerds wonder why people voted no to spite them for attacking dissenters.
---
Seems good with a bit of tweaking :)
---
If this skill can't pass, no skill will ever pass. It's not a radical change, fits oldschool style, fills a niche. Anything else would be even more contentious. I do not understand how sailing had a higher percentage though, that is crazy to me

&gt;straw man

noun

noun: strawman:
---
&gt;an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument 
---
What you did is literally a strawman  I'm not here to discuss the specifics of your argument. What you did is a fallacy that makes you're argument look better by twisting what he said to fit your argument. 
---
However, by using a fallacy your argument is fundamentally flawed.
---
You can present your point without putting words into someone else's mouth.

Thing with this is people don‚Äôt realise how it was to play back in 2007 when the image was taken,
---
The pure 2007 server would be dead and only autumn elegy and boaty would be playing on it.

Well we aren't shareholders, we're the pats community. The only rules to vote are 300 total and membership so if I invest the time and capital to meet that requirement multiple times I should get multiple votes. It's similar to if a shareholder owns a large enough portion of a company he should have more influence than someone who only owns a small portion. 
---
Reddit's also acting like only anti-warding players used alts to vote no. Plenty of pro-warding players used alts too.
---
Yeah, it is. I think it‚Äôs a reaction to how people use this game as an escape to feel like a kid again and even though I enjoy rs3 and osrs neither really feel like the game I played as a kid. There‚Äôs too much new stuff and too much theory. 
---
That said I like most of the new stuff when it feels like the logical direction for osrs. 
---
My reasons for not liking warding were thematic as in RS magic is kind of arcane and beyond humans in a sense according to the experienced world (idk anything about the lore.)
---
I would seriously love to know how many people made hundreds of accounts to vote yes
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again. Urine is not sterile. Whoever still honestly tells this does not know what "sterile" means. It's also not healthy to consume (also a myth often told) - it's not necessarily harmful, mind you, but that does not mean "sterile".
---
Also, as much as I enjoy sinkpissing, the mental gymnastics sinkpissers on the subreddit go through to "justify" something that's just fun is baffling. You don't "save water" in any meaningful way (and actually hurt your sewage system by reducing the flushing that goes through it) especially since most keep the water running. Unless you are a germophobe all the "microdroplets" of toilet water spraying "everywhere" are complete humbug (and is also true for .your sink by the way). And the "romantic" postings of people remembering a particular sink or their "first time" are just trolling or satire.
---
Wouldnt the dissolving have fixed a big portion of that loss though?
---
The comp cape was pretty near best in slot, nobody with one didn't wear it
---
I'm suggesting that we as individuals or as a community should strive to be better than the people we understand are being shitty. Sorry if that was for some reason difficult to understand.
---
The stranger has just recently stopped following someone who‚Äôs in the middle of the Desert Treasure. I‚Äôm pretty sure if that player logs out or teleports, the stranger will then start following anyone in that area, which happens to be you.
---
That locking a BIS behind thousands of hours of content is poor game design?
---
Well first off we've already established that the variants of the max cape are a cosmetic override for the particular best in slot items so therefore it is not a best in slot item itself. And second we've established that the base variant is not best in slot for anything and has the stats of any other skillcape. So no part of the max cape is best in slot. So your argument is dead on arrival.
---
I've been playing rs3 ironman mode and I'm loving it
---
And less overall votes, almost half
---
It's truely hard to explain for newly joined players. People blame it all on alt polling, but it's really not as big of a factor as people make it seem. The veterans who have been playing for 10 years have seen how every type of addition effect the game. Until the veterans retire and the new generation who didn't experience the downfalls take over, new skills will almost garaunteed fail.
---
To prove alt polling isn't as big of a deal, go to the veteran community forums old generation clanning forums, etc who privately poll the same ingame polls. Keep in mind these communities don't alt poll like you would ingame and they still fail. We've seen how new skills especially such a skill that brings in new set robe effects and the likes effect the game. It's a dungeoneering 2.0 in the aspect of new content. The skill may be completely different but the balance of the rewards are similar.
---
This pool was flawed from the beginning. So many stupid people used alts to vote no because 'my max cape'. God, this community sucks so much sometimes.
---
Tell me about it ha
---
It would bottleneck supplies more than it already is. 
---
Warding at least had new stuff required to obtain to make things,
---
Artisan would have a 99 within the day of release.
---
Whiny? They won. Have you seen the losers in the sub here? It's 2016 all over again
---
Good
---
what?
---
I don't care if im missed lmao I'm just happy I'm gonna have free time now
---
My negative mood about Warding failing already passed. I no longer give a damn about that skill.

Did you know, that you can completely enjoy every single aspect of the game without ever having to come on this subreddit!!!

And the rewards weren‚Äôt broken mega bis in every situation items.

Thanks! Thats a huge help

Since when? I went through the brimhaven dungeon praying mage and still got burnt by bronze dragon fire. Mage and shield may block it 100% but I don't think just praying does
