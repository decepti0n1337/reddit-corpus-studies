I find most Jad guides needlessly long and complicated, clearly trying to get the 10 minute youtube sweetspot.

I’m a low level Ironman, and I’ve met nothing but other polite Im. What level do we unlock being a massive cock to everyone?
---
Exactly. Each name is just as rare as the last. 1/1.
---
multiboxing probably
---
more common in WoW than RS if so
---
Facts
---
He was angry last time I said it looked like they were botting. I’m sure he’ll comment soon.
---
I’m pretty sure a majority of the player base started when those skills were already out, hence “old school Runescape”
---
You make it sound like osrs had a horrible update that absolutely ruined the game.
---
Warding would provide A) a new skill to train, akin to crafting (combat base of range) and smithing (combat base for melee) B) create an item sink for unf pots, materials for new/ reworked mage sets C) make current mage robe sets viable, instead of having 5 robe sets unlocked at 1 benchmark which nobody uses anyway.
---
Personally i hate raids because all it did was add a high level/ end game content that you need high tier gear for and increase items in the game. Yup BIS weapons created but its just getting camped in solo and groups to grind the weapons. Theres no sink to get rid of the weapons, and no common challenge where if you die they get lost. Dungeoneering was a great skill added for all levels, with a high level component and at the time some high tier weapons (untradeable so you couldnt drop that fat stack to buy it yourself) and required you to start with nothing. Raids was a cheap rip off that didnt add nearly the same value.
---
we already have superior antifire potions tho
---
Smithing level?
---
10 mins I like it. Not gonna watch the next 40 tho
---
You should actually be able to mix pie halves too. Always taking the right hand slice first.
---
well theres a part of the minimap that shows more area but its a small portion, so you have to turn it around. but it allows you to check for dots just a little bit further
---
That doesn’t help but thank you anyway kind stranger
---
&gt;Will it mess with any of my progress on rs3?
---
No. Items, quests, stats etc. are not shared between OSRS and RS3. Only a few things like friend lists are connected.
---
Crystals are 1/128 for a random one anyways, should get 1 each task on average.
---
And always switch back to pray melee after he's done
---
What’s that
---
Yeah but 95% or more of hijackings are retards getting phished or having insecure emails. Recovering accounts isn't hard, it just takes a lot more time. They need to find the start of the breadcrumbs and hope it leads to a dump.
---
I'd imagine if you've been very active in a friend group/clan the people in there probably have enough information to go off of to start. But maybe you're lucky like I believe I am, there's missing links to whatever information I have out there.
---
I also suggest maybe adding an armour section,if that's possible for you.
---
Chop Chop!
---
Try looking them up on the wiki, if that doesnt help idk what will
---
Questing has definitely become less tedious for me. A lot of people hated the fremenik trials and isles, I don't really see them as a problem. I've also got pretty much all quest pre-reqs for rfd done, sans desert treasure. More than I anything, I really need a way to make money, I can't find much that doesn't bore me out of my mind.
---
Give me a specific example of a major update that wouldve ruined the game legitimately. Not counting an idea used/ proposed in rs3. Not including something that would cause an uproar in the g.e. (items get made irrelevant all the time, sorry if you lost money from it before)
---
I am Groot
---
Bring Kharil's crossbow and racks.  That's how I did it on my zerk
---
Thank you!
---
Max hit is best in most situations, accuracy is useful against bosses with high def
---
Ain't are first rodeo" ... There are so many things wrong with this.
---
I played a game of castle wars with a guy named "6" the other day
---
Except they made a cheap version in raids. Summoning would give the much needed item sink/ grind/ purpose to underused items. It also only missed the backup date by a few months if i recall correctly.
---
I brought in Rune darts for Jad alone, but then I switched to mith darts to do the round before and forgot to put the rune darts in so I ended up killing Jad with the mith darts lol.
---
Thats what hes saying, yeah. :p
---
Yeah makes sense, they’re just more of a passive boost rather than something to specifically grind for
---
Its braindead easy money though. Got myself 3 magic seeds this week
---
No
---
Riiightt ...
---
According to your comment history you trained hunter for the first time yesterday, and 70 agility is way to high for the new quest for you... yeah no way you did Inferno, ur full of shit and prolly dont even have firecape

Yeah man. I remember the peak time when wintertodt came out new, everyone was spamming like theres no tomorrow. Best part was some people in west placing cannons/bird snares etc. To keep the east boys out lmao.
---
I actually follow him on IG and he’s friends with one of my best online friends 😂😂😂
---
I've done UP and and Regicide and neither of them were as bad as that pyramid. I don't know why but the game really didn't like me that time.
---
Yessir!
---
I don't want it because Jagex are already shit tight with everything they're already doing, especially content. If we were to have this now Song of the Elves would probably be post-poned to like December.
---
Crystals are all 1/512
---
Never going to happen. You will never get a skill designed that has less than 25% of the player base disliking it for one reason or another. If it has a lot of components there’s too many possible things for people to dislike about it, and if it’s too simple then a lot of people will think it’s too weak to belongs as a skill.
---
All hail!!
---
There’s also a 2k CoX challenge mode cape. Arguably better.
---
From my understanding bringing a melee switch for defense lowering specs isn't worth it and it's better to just bring extra supplies for longer trips. However I'm not sure if that applies to blowpipe or only to dhcb and I also don't know how lower combat stats may or may not skew that conclusion.
---
oh my lord that pyramid took my like 5 minutes I was stuck doing UP for around 3 hours, I'm glad UP and regicide where more forgiving for you, I wouldn't wish that one anyone
---
anybody from the name community that isn't new to it would know exactly who 1 is, by real life name. And would give you an answer that isn't quite matching what you're saying.
---
I used it since it was convenient to then upload from my phone.
---
Same. I want Vorki so bad, but I've only just started that grind.
---
and then everything has to become instanced,and you will still see nobody 10/10 lmao
---
Imagine not having regen bracelet for the juicy hp gains
---
why? free con xp is the best tbh!
---
Told ya. Don't know what the B.O.U.N.C.E method is lmao.
---
I wish I had a rare name. I wonder how people get them. Is it as easy as just changing your name? Almost had one a few years ago on name release day but someone got it before me. PID I guess.
---
he hasnt had $11 for 10 years to pay for a membership, or 4m gold at that?
---
You mean Larr'ns chest?
---
and i agree, ecumental keys would be a nice addition to the chest. So far all my rewards have been Raw sea turtles or gold ore.
---
Wrong. Xerican robes are 10 def req and are better than chaos elder.
---
Grinding out RC as my last skill to base 70's right now---9 levels to go
---
I don’t think they will be that much, it’s a passive gain not the reason you do the content, it’s the bonus on top. Sort of like konar or wilderness keys
---
Well they could just add def requirements to items like that.
---
Haha, about 4 hours ago. He had all the accounts equip a stake breadstick and dance with me in the middle.
---
As I said something that got a reaction out of him
---
It’s really hard at first but once you have muscle memory of the course it becomes super easy.
---
don't even bother trying to farm Vork before full Void, preferrably Elite Void.
---
How'd u even get 5 def in the first place?
---
I had a Staff of the Dead just lying around that I never use, so I pawned it off. If this is as profitable as everyone has lead me to believe, I should make that 6m back in a couple hours.
---
I used an arcane spirit shield and ancestral am i good
---
One to enjoy the game with without having to fear that you could fuck your account up at any moment and need to restart.

This is content for osrs. Fucking hell.

But this one's the real deal, apparently.

---
At the moment, I'm not expecting more than two kills a trip if I'm being realistic. So I think speeding those up right now would be a better option, right?
---
Jad hasn't been considered difficult for like a decade but alright man.
---
It is tower of life basement. Not sure why it's there, but I just think it's the texture. Not the actual tower of life basement. This has been around for a few years back and I think Faux from twitch made some comments on it.

WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THIS
---
Controversial opinion: Toxicity means that people of all walks of life are playing the game, meaning that it's in it's golden age. But, try not to be toxic.
---
I'm so fucking garbage at the Fight Caves. Took me four tries to get the Fire Cape with pretty high stats. I'm gonna cry if I ever have to do it again.
---
Nobody brings a looting bag to edge
---
I would do the quest point cape. If you follow slayermusiq1 low total quest cape list, there’s only a few points where you have to grind 1 thing for a little bit. For me the first ‘wall’ was 56 agility where it took a couple hours. Up to that point it was pretty cool doing a bunch of quests going all over the world. I’m 76 combat with 238 qp. Right now grinding out the 69 Slayer &amp; 65 defense. I’m down to less than 15 quests I believe, and like I said before I really haven’t had to grind much at all. Nearly 1300 total too. 
---
Grinding quests out early unlocks a ton of content. I had b gloves at 68 combat, and basically base 50s excluding rc and con
---
Well I guess it could go either way lol. To hunt for a witch. Like the spooky magic bitches.
---
I don't like the thingy at the bottom. Not that it matters, because there's no way I'll ever get the Infernape Cape.
---
People who went to college and got unmarketable degrees / people who don’t want to go through underground pass a second time for regicide are not oppressed classes.
---
Are you only good for shitting on other people's grammar? I use the word "good" loosely here.
---
i never go in wildy to witness this,  but i imagine some twerp with a magnifying glass walking around as if hes looking for ants.  and some foaming at the mouth poison knife wielding old man chasing him down and stabbing him  then gnawing on the shovel that drops
---
Fun way to gamble in RuneScape:
---
*sand casi...* I mean sell your entire bank then buy it back a day later.
---
Im sure he hacked it sometime or later
---
I actually enjoyed Wintertodt because of the interaction between players. I might just do some more Windertodt for shits and giggles even though my Firemaking is 99 already.
---
Yeah you got him
---
did you put it in your house
---
Reported for account sharing
---
oof, thats a rip I guess. eh, back to runite to bonds it is!
---
Why do I put myself through this game?
---
Nope. I'm at 4k and have 99 Slayer. Might go back sometime, but I really don't want to. I don't even like the pet all that much.. just keep thinking, "1 more task!"
---
Literally a multi-billion dollar industry, but ok.
---
If you turn your private to off (right click the private button by the chatbox) then you will show as offline
---
yeah fair play, might be a witch.
---
There’s a reason for it, sure, but it being one of the only activities out of everything that’s out there that they commonly ban for is a bit odd.
---
Edit: they do it for Deadman stuff too I think.

What is chop chop?

On the prayer grind, bought the bones for 99 prayer, not sure if I have the patience for it though...

That's still a hot rock cake. Can't even eat it.

I told you why you make it up, jealousy. You've never spoken to him in your life, you have no way of knowing whether or not that's true. You believe what you want to believe because it makes you feel better about not having it. It is literally that simple. 
---
Ask yourself why you even commented that it's been sold 8348 times? What benefit does that serve to anybody? You're not warning anybody of a scam, because the name hasn't moved since he got it, because he CAN'T. You were seeking validation that you're not getting elsewhere. This isn't unique, reddit does this with every single 1 character name that ever gets posted here. Not a single thread about this singular person and singular account has been accompanied with PROOF. Wonder why this particular 1 character name can't be proven that it's been sold when others can. 
---
You don't know anything, quit pretending like you do.
---
Weird. I never signed up for it tho. Could explain why I'm told I have "x days of membership left" when I first log in.  
---
Any idea how I got it if I never paid for it?
---
There was also a jmod that literally stole money and hacked accounts lol 
---
Jmods aren’t fucking angels.
---
If you go for points, you want to use max str gear and enable all bosses (won't be afk but will be several times faster than the bosses you choose for afk)
---
If you go for xp, use obsidian gear with a berserker neck, and other max str gear. 
---
Either way, you don't want to be using prayer unless you wanna go super afk because rock cake/locator orb and absorbs will last much longer and be much cheaper than ppots.

You started your journey.......

it's more that its a big time sink. people do not want to learn prayer flicking, people have nerve problems etc.
---
if youve already learned all the stuff there is to osrs, stuff like tob, solo raids, starting to learn to offtick minions at gwd post kill/attempting to flick during the kill youll be super set to get the cape in a few days of really solid grinding.

Yea stuff like this is such a grey area it's crazy.

Not pathetic but not a hobby either.

2 hours of camping him would be like 300-400 kills. No way. I'd bet it was probably 30 mins tops and op just likes to exaggerate.

There'd be no way to straight up buy them, just buying a chance to get them

And the "low tier" chest is next to a point hotspot in multi with teleing as your own escape

Lmao are you okay dude? I couldn’t give two fucks about a “rare” name. That doesn’t change the fact that it’s been sold before. Multiple people have said it’s been sold before. Where there’s smoke there’s fire. Why would people say it’s been sold before if it hasn’t? Because they’re jealous? What the fuck does saying it’s been sold fix if they’re jealous? I’m done with this pointless argument

how is "1" cool?

Got an occult not an Ironman just trash

Damn that's whole new level of denial.

This is it. The best runescape meme. We've found it

---
It is literally the most desirable name possible in the game, other than maybe zezima.. it's absolutely ridiculous to try and throw some random ass price on it, rare names are actually a massive market even outside of RuneScape with some people making 6+ figures stealing/flipping them
---
On a game this old and well established, having such an insane name, it not only being one charterer but also the number 1, it's literally a seller's market, he could probably get fucking a few ounces of gold for every pixel in his name
---
You just don't see shit like that, in the name market that is like the most prestigious of the most prestigious possible names on an incredibly well established and popular game
---
Talking about the value of it in gp even is insane, because it very well could go for more than most people make in a year, he could likely trade it for a new fucking car if he really wanted
---
Og usernames are ***stupidly*** valuable, I'll never understand why, or who would ever want to pay anywhere near what people do, but the fact is it does happen, a lot.. and that name if it were a physical asset should be in a fucking safety deposit box

Of course 666. Jagex likes to promote homosexuality everything that's against God.
---
hmm id say bout three fiddy
---
&gt;What else would you do...
---
Mate, that's the whole point of the comment chain that we're currently in right now. The reason why people spam shit in Wintertodt is because it's afk enough to type, but not afk enough to do something else. That's what the comment you replied to was talking about. Spamming is the thing you do, because you can't do anything else.
---
This isn't that complicated. There are many things that require you to click your screen, and they happen at basically random intervals, so you have to keep looking at your screen. It's hard to pay any attention to something else and still maintain good points/exp per game, because you never know when you'll have to click next.
---
idk what ur smoking to unironically believe this but i want some
---
no, there are many 1 kc twisted bows.
---
Lots of people want this game to become a perfect equilibrium of balance where all things should be equal. At the same time, they neglect the fact that these nuances are what keep the game interesting with a plethora of hidden "mechanics" and tricks to be found.
---
even if void gloves weren't a reason why the fuck would any1 use blowpipe over dhcb or lance just because u can pray range instead LOL

There are something like 2400 planes of existence in osrs. Enjoy the fun fact.

I got the idea from knowing I'd have to do it again in the future.
---
This "method" isnt even that good, props to them for working it out, but the door isnt stuck for very long and Ice Barrage doesnt last forever, so neither the door is permastuck nor is the player permafrozen so youd have to be really panicky to die here. Every 20 seconds you have 5 game ticks where you cant be frozen again, thats 5 ticks to open the door and run away, its practically impossible to die here. This clip is just exaggerated because Sparc Mac isnt very good at the game and he panics hard and doesnt even try to get himself out of the situation with calmness he just kicks and screams and cries that the game is broken instead. 
---
TL;DR: If a door is closed you open the door to walk past the door. If the door is stuck, you wait till it becomes unstuck and you attempt this again. If you happen to be frozen as you attempt this you simply wait till you are unfrozen and attempt this again, you have a 5 tick window of invulnerability.  Nothing hard, nothing broken.
---
You buffoon
---
People who say that are usually the ones pushing insane agendas and are complaining because they're getting called out.

Let's check the post history
---
It'd be pretty good to troll your friend by putting their RSN as your own there
---
They’re just slow.
---
yea, there are plenty of people on there that would probably finesse that much, but there’s also people who have invested like 15+ year into that forum that wouldnt risk getting banned for 20b, i get what you’re saying that.

Hey at least you can still turn a profit with that. There was some poor soul on here a few days ago that didn’t know how to do barrows right and he consistently lost money over 1000 chests 😂
---
nope, not at all, as long as you kill all 6 brothers you’ll get the maximum chance of getting an item, which i believe is 1/17.
---
Man, Goodbye Quest Cape
---
That guy was just bullied in school.  Way to much grammar for RuneScape lol
---
He deserves it for listening to Hollywood undead in 2019
---
Why do you keep double speccing people with protect melee on? It never works my dude.
---
Welp too late. Sorry you didn't like my comment though.
---
Why though?
---
Holy shit yes!
---
The number of brothers you kill is what affects the barrows item drop, the percentage affects the other drops
---
chill out with the participation trophies
---
Helmies make the biggest mistake of their career piping up at me revealing that in fact that they cannot recieve items from creatures other players have damaged
---
Too bad
---
Then woox does it with 1 item and potatos
---
The difference is infernal is obtained much, much, much later than fire cape. If youre somewhat good you can pretty comfortably get fire cape at 80-90 combat and its your bis until infernal, so you'll probably be using it for ages.
---
You're gonna have a bad time.
---
Don’t worry about him I know him irl he’s illiterate
---
Sometimes it does man, vls can still slap thru pray melee. Also he's on like 1000 ping at all times, this man pks in the future from the past
---
Everytime I browse this sub it sounds that every fucking one here has an infernal cape. Which is surprising, considering there aren't that many in the game.
---
Only because it's a 1- character name... making it rare.
---
There's less than 30 that exist.

According to a jagex mod In this thread it's 100% legit.
---
When I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So when there i am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece and who walks in but Woox. 
---
I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Woox, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Woox put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.
---
Imagining Neive wearing that...;)

OH

You can msg u/haigom this person seem to have similar stats as you and want to get torso too.

It's the person above/below you depending on how you sorted the questions

These guys are projecting

Sure, it could be, but it would make taking the fury make even less sense. You'd want to wear the occult for the mage bonus vs nibblers, but the most valuable time to wear the fury is on wave start since defense matters the most before the wave is settled/solved.

Putting the karambwans around the jewels I see ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Love the idea of continuing the penguin series as it was always one of my favorites as a kid, but right now the only penguin quest in game is Cold War, which is easily either a novices or intermediate quest, and I think following up with a grandmaster quest seems a little ridiculous. I would, however, really love to see an intermediate or experienced quest (maybe even master) come out at some point

You obviously didnt read it. Its not saying if you are pked as an ironman . Its saying if you pk someone as an ironman. Not introducing more items since those items would be there anyways.
---
Nah its fairly easy to get. I bought my 4 char irl name and we did the swap at the same time while on whatsapp. The chances of someone getting it is very low since name grabbing bots won’t work on the rs website.

They're active players, so people who have quit don't count

As for not caring, only as much as new players, the platform shouldn't matter much

Fair to say we had a bug influx and that might have affected 2fa numbers though

Your range is very low, get it up and you get faster kills @ Vorkath.

Also remember to use voids and salve ammy.

It can't be traded in

Wow I went exactly there myself in may and had a blast! Congrats!

Well said
---
Most "hacks" always been the players ignorance fault, that update post proved that even more. Set up a new security stronghold that actually forces players to think about their security might be a good idea..

Nobody talks about 75 stats and budget gear, also 4-5min is a lot even if you only range

Well i'd say congratulations and i hope your sanity is still existent.
---
not really man, a lot of people still do konar because of the keys (additional profit) and also lower level players use her too. Also she gives more points than duracell, so it would still be viable for some other players, i just don't get why a lvl 95 slayer req boss is only available through a lower tier slayer master only
---
Are they disabled on alt accounts too?
---
Downvoted for being right. The only place you ( /u/TTDbtw ) will find a source for the mouse polling frequency (50ms) is from botting forums, so none are going to be able to be linked here. Also AHK scripts that jump positions aren't really bannable because of that, because touchscreens jump positions.
---
But PvP takes more skill than PvM so I'm told?
---
My range Cape has built in assembler :) 
---
B2P I have with me but the 2 kills I dont get enough bones to use anyway. It's so bad that I brought 6 food and used 3 per trip having to telle out after 2 kills. Blowpipe spec for heal is hit or miss
---
Due to the tasks they assign, Duracell is actually better cash than konar until you get to 95 slayer. 
---
Reasoning for just her is to keep relevant, and because they want her to have her unique mobs.
---
They said no, this is the whole point of konar.
---
So, I am only slightly salty right now, but why do people do this?
---
I mean, sure, its fun to kill people. But at the same time, you just made someones day worse for no reason since you have nothing to gain since they likely have nothing but trash on them.
---
On the slight off chance that they finished a clue and got a valueable item?
---

what are you talking about?
---
What barrows minions should I be killing for the most bloods ? I've seen that 3 skeletons is the way to go but I've also seen 2 worms and a spider.
---
I miss these types of memes
---
Crystal shield is worth a try. B2p I brought but 2 kills wasnt enough to be useful. 2nd trip I brought less pots and 6 food with me. Used all 6 on 2 runs with unlucky blowpipe spec heal
---
okay yeah that's probably true, still would be cool if one other slayer master (especially the highest req master) to assign the highest slayer req monster in game, only makes sense
---
BTW?
---
It would and I wouldn’t be against it.. but at the same time I can tell why they didn’t. 
---
Steve is for xp
---
Duracell is for cash
---
Konar is the inbetween.
---
I dont disagree with your points regarding warding but the way their pitching it, is shit.
---
Yes
---
Just level your defence and play the game normally, pures are dead lmao
---
why what did Konar say/do?
---
I got you homie
---
God, I miss the release of OSRS. Despite me being old now (even though 29 is no age) - I got the need back of rushing home from work - heck, even playing at work, back.

It’s +8 str instead of +4, so it’s a max hit in almost all cases.

---
Lmao dude.
---
He's 56 fishing and 435 total himself, so I'd reckon you're right.
---
Let me clarify,
---
&gt;Being different wasn't the point, making sense is and like you said I couldn't care less about the bankstanders **but it doesn't look fun if you look at it from a new player point of view** and obviously i would like the game to get popular.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; It will also prevent people people from **bankstanding and high alching for houra. What type of gameplay is that?** 
---
You're saying high alching doesn't look fun meanwhile a lot of runescape's gameplay is literally standing in a designated area, usually 1-tile (sometimes even bank standing) and doing a task over and over again. The gameplay of high alching can easily be translated to loads of other things in game, a lot of which are skills.

Well I'm just trying to say that his account is just off of clicking hours on end while there are other more spectacular accs like rendi with 18 cmb firecape or 50 cmb inferno or a lvl 3 hcim that killed a kbd or stuff like that which actually requires skills rather than time

I have the same exact sentiment, glad others do, I hope we get it some day. Perhaps even with the ability to host servers, like Minecraft Java Edition.

Essentially the only ways a bank pin differs from a password is that you can only change it in-game with a couple days delay and it's a bit safer against keyloggers and database breaches. If they implemented an auth removal delay then the bank pin on login would be redundant, since the bank pin on login would act as just another delay. I'd prefer an auth delay over having to type my pin on login every time.

You found the solution to your problem: When maxing is easy (RS3/WoW), it's not about the journey but the destination. When maxing is slow (OSRS), it's about the journey and not the destination.

Did you bother to read the blog? 50% of the player base doesnt use the authenticator to begin with and God only knows how many of those who do have it in the game also have it in their e-mail. the delay woldnt do anything when people clearly aren't using the authenticator.
---
That last part of your comment doesnt make sense at all.
---
 Im not asking for a bank pin confirmation as soon as you login, im asking for a bank pin confirmation before you can trade, enter wild, cw portal, or drop items from your inventory for the first time after login. This way even if someone login to your account the equipped items and your inventory are protected.
---
And not wanting to type the bank pin is not an argument here because the moment you need to take something from your bank, you'll have to type it anyway.

Love this, what makes gaming in general great. Wish more people would see how it helps people
---
Top-tier pvp and top-tier pvm are probably about the same in terms of overall difficulty, but the skills used are quite different. Pvp has a bit more rng than pvm and is also less predictable due to the nature of fighting an actual person instead of a machine, so pvp is more about quick decision making and executing good combos, while pvm is more about managing resources and maximising damage while minimising mistakes to improve overall efficiency.
---
I see where you're coming from but that's incorrect, just not the way probability works...

The chance of getting a d med from kbd in any given kill is always 1/128, regardless of how many times you've killed it before

You should be fine, I can only speculate but I'm sure there's heaps of people in your boat. They should look at other common factors that link upto buying inferno capes. Eg. Password change, Authenticator removal, IP (say you're US and suddenly you have an IP from the UK and do an inferno then swap back to your US IP it will look sus). I'm sure they take into multiple different factors and circumstances to confirm if a cape is illegitimate. 
---
The only false cape removal I have seen was posted on reddit and that person got a previous cape removed and did a legitimate one later which got removed.

I wanted to share this incase anyone wanted to use it.

I'm doing this on android, I can't imagine iphone allow this. Using a app called ultimate rotation control you can force auto rotation, with this switch on open your osrs app. This will give you a small login screen at the top. (This expands when you log in) once you've logged in you can also lock rotation so it doesn't change. 
---
Pros:I found this made Agility training alot easier as you can play one handed. 
---
I'm sure you can come up with other great uses for this.
---
 Cons: inventory ui etc. Is rather small.
---
Probably devalues btw.

When was the last time you actually thought about a comment before posting it? This game needs way less updates and to prioritise quality over quantity. Trying to rush the Jmods into shitting out badly balanced, rushed updates is absolute brainlet tier shit.

Hey man I was typing a comment on how to do it, check it out :)
---
Can't tell if that's a good thing or a bad thing for you?
---
i found the chart to be confusing the first 2 or 3 goes for me, as i got distracted by which phase zulrah went to (theres a phase i think its range where its 1 of 2 possibilites) and just ate a shit tonne of venom, after the 5th kill i finally killed it, i used void and just had the helm switch. 
---
took me 2.53 to kill but i finally got there in the end haha.
---
I afk’d monkfish from 62 to 99, can confirm it fucking took forever

You wanna get your prayer to 43 for overheads, and then get your combat stats to base 60.

And is that a bad thing.....?

My comment is literally saying that they shouldnt update every week and you somehow see this as complaining about lack of updates?

Thats a brainlet tier reply.

If you’re having a hard time with long grinding sessions but still want a 99 you should consider farming. A fruit tree run once a day takes ten minutes and an allotment/herb run takes about fifteen minutes and you can do them every hour or so.

When I was 10 years old (21 now), I was on the beach for my birthday and inhaled some sand accidentally. I had severe athsma as a kid and this caused an athsma attack at the time. I couldn't calm down. I tried everything. Showers. Hot liquids. It wasn't until I got to the hotel room and just wanted to play OSRS. When I finally sat down, I calmed down completely and experienced relief.

To this day I have a sentimental attachment to Runescape and have carried with it during ups and downs. I've never quit.

This is why i want an ironman mode where only ironmen of that type can trade eachother, no g.e allowed. I'd love to see the markets it created (fally park/varrock west etc). Id drop my main in a heartbeat.
---
For those at work:
---
*This week brings the remaining polled changes that were discussed in the* [***State of PvP***](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-state-of-pvp?oldschool=1) *blog in May.*  
---
**Clan Wars: Extra Options**  
---
We have added multiple new options when setting up Clan Wars games:   
---
* **Leaving channel** \- This setting can be used to toggle whether players leaving the clan chat are counted as a death or not.
---
* **Re-joining** \- An option for rejoining a clan chat during the game which would include "Unrestricted" or "60 second limit".
---
* **Team Cap** \- An option to cap group fights to the following:  
---
   * 5v5
---
   * 10v10
---
   * 15v15
---
   * 20v20
---
   * 30v30
---
   * Uncapped
---
  
---
**Teleblock Changes**  
---
Killing the player or NPC that teleblocks you now removes the teleblock effect. A player who successfully removes their teleblock this way will not be immune to another.   
---
**DMM Summer Finals**📷  
---
The Summer Finals are now underway with the top players from the Summer Season currently competing for $32,000 in prize money.   
---
**Mark Your Calendars**
---
* The Permadeath stage begins at **8pm BST on Saturday 29th June**.
---
* The finals will be held live at Jagex HQ on **Saturday 29th June**. This will not be a ticketed event and will not be open to the public.
---
* As with the previous Spring Finals, the 1v1 section of the Finals will include the last 256 surviving players of the Permadeath stage, rather than 128.
---
**Where to Watch the Finals**  
---
The Deadman Summer Finals brings with it hours of content to watch and enjoy. Get to the Twitch directory and you'll find lots of dedicated Old School streamers broadcasting the slaughter of their enemies. Watch the action of the Summer Finals Permadeath stage from the official [**OldSchoolRS Twitch channel**](https://www.twitch.tv/oldschoolrs).   
---
**Account Security**  
---
The Player Support team recently posted an [**Account Security Blog**](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/player-support---account-security-blog?oldschool=1) (the second in a series of four blogs) to examine security measures they are working on now and plans for the future. If you haven't already, make sure to give it a read!   
---
**RuneFest 2019**  
---
RuneFest tickets are still on sale! To join other players and the J-Mods in celebrating RuneScape and Old School, head over to the [**official RuneFest page**](https://www.runefest.com/en-GB/).   
---
This year's RuneFest is shaping up to be totally epic. We're bringing back Skill Chips and adding new activities, new entertainment, and all the biggest announcements from both the RuneScape and Old School teams. RuneFest is a celebration like no other. You can look forward to panel sessions with your favourite JMods and content creators, an awesome 200 PC LAN party, and goodie bags filled with RuneFest Loot.   
---
Food and drink will be available on-site throughout the event, and as the day comes to a close we'll also be hosting a massive after-party for all our guests.   
---
We're packing in plenty of surprises this year, and we can't wait to see you there!   
---
**In Other News**  
---
**The PvP World Rota** is switching over to **Period A**. On the east of the Atlantic, host the Bounty Hunter world (**W18, UK**) and the High Risk PvP world (**W43, Germany**). On the west of the Atlantic, host the Standard PvP world (**W24, USA**) and the F2P PvP world (**W117, USA**).
---
* Larran's keys will now always be lost on death. They are also destroyed slowly if dropped manually, similar to Deadman keys.
---
* The antispam teleport system applied to teleports from the spellbooks in PvP worlds has now been extended to teleport tablets, the Amulet of glory, and the Games necklace. This will be monitored and added to more places should it be necessary. The message displayed has been modified to be more helpful and is no longer filtered.
---
* The player *Demilancer* has been added to Watson's list of clue scroll contributors.
---
* The in-game world map now shows the rivers Hos and Dougne.
---
* The welcome screen will tell you the time since your last session more accurately, after you've logged in and out one more time.
---
* Players trapped on F2P worlds near the top of the lava dungeon ladder in the Wilderness can now escape.
---
* The penguin island that can be accessed through the fairy ring code AJS is now a multicombat area. This has been changed to counteract the Hosidius rework nerfing bird tasks assigned by Turael.
---
* Jimmy Dazzler no longer deforms horribly while trying to wave his hands about.
---
You should be able to tank most tasks that you do in slayer caves with the exception of aberrant spectres (which are skipped, but if you can't afford it then pray with prossy).
---
Efficiency is to cannon everything you can and do as many burst/barrage tasks as possible (not going to get many until you hit 80). You **will** lose money until you're like 80+ slayer, but it's way faster.
---
If money isn't a factor, you can safespot fire giants/bloodvelds in nieve's cave and cannon. This is about a 30-40% xph increase at the cost of way more cannonballs. It's technically possible with hellhounds too but for overall xp efficiency just block hellhounds asap.
---
Once you hit 94 mage, ice barrage is a **significant** speed increase over ice burst for Nechyraels/Smoke devils, although the difference is a lot more minor for Dust Devils.
---
Block list &gt; Superiors &gt; Extends &gt; Slayer helm &gt; anything else for points.
---
So does *everything* in this damn game... Pest control isn't unique in that it takes fucking ages. Worth it though, when I use a DPS calculator for my slayer tasks, void still beats out my normal mage/range gear (67 range, 65 mage, guess it might change if I level up and get better gear), I haven't imbued my slayer helm though because I'm too old school to know what the fuck is going in with the NMZ, which probably doesn't help.
---
The RS3 sub doesn't have any of the softcore hentai that gets posted here, lmao.
---
Great brain robbery
---
This a good throwback Thursday to when I played RS3 before EOC and everyone would accuse you of being a bot if you afked.
---
The canon THICCest human-like NPC is the Giant at 290 lbs.  
---
The canon THICCest human NPC is a draw between the Bandit and Barbarian at 235 lbs.  
---
The canon THICCest non-human NPC is the Cow at 1,500 lbs.  
---
Some honorable mentions I discovered are the Ghost that has its weight listed as "You can't weigh a spirit!", The 30ft tall Giant Spider only weighing 20 lbs, Skeletons that are "About 100 lbs.. or more for "big-boned" skeletons", The 5ft tall "Rat" that weighs up to 70lbs, and finally the Guard Bandits which for some reason only weigh up to 70 lbs.
---
Fuck, now that I think about it, I logged in to cheat at killing mole for the hard Fally diary, but I killed it before I got there, logged out and didn't rake my favour back up ☹
---
wow!
---
I got 99 woodcutting by literally clicking maybe once every 3 minutes for a few weeks while I watched Netflix and youtube videos. Effort has nothing to do with it.
---
No XP Waste!
---
You'll adapt if you really want to play. I myself rather not play than use mobile
---
I agree. I learned it on mobile without ever attempting on pc so I think it was a a little bit of a step. But you’re right.. it is surprisingly easy once you understand the fight
---
Easiest way to find out what u want to do with stats is to go BH World and see what kind of opponents you get, how you doing against them etc. 
---
At start you can safe, so you dont get one ticked. There are many experienced players so you die few times.
---
After you have seen that bracket you can go get some levels, just use combat lvl calculator to see what stats to get.
---
I would not worry too much about hp lvl, even if you have 70 hp someone can stack you.
---
Bro what
---
Salty
---
3 year olds are capable of clicking on things with a mouse.
---
I would even say we dont have the bare minimum when comparing to other first world countries
---
No, you can't do that!
---
....right?
---
This is why we can't have nice things... making us ironmen have to work extra hard so the over entitled normies get everything....
---
Thanks! Almost lost this comment in the sea of notifications I had (total of 3 notifications). Will add it to backlog.
---
I made a new account and have played only mobile. 134qp and 1111 total in ~2months. Its playable but some things are very annoying. And i have iphone se and it feels too small to play this game. Sometimes i cant hit the items i want to.
---
I saw some mudcrabs the other day... hateful creatures!
---
This is called auto clicking and it's against the rules. Just that feature on your mouse that lets u hold down to click is suspect and I'd be afraid to use it in RS while alching cus the click interval is probably the same over and over.
---
Did I stutter? Sell it.
---
Right, you can’t. To be honest, I’d say fuck the bond, get the 1m to insure your pet and go do that in Ardougne so if you ever die with your beaver out you don’t lose it forever. Worth the $11 for one month imo
---
then this update is nulled very easily tbh
---
Blood barrage costs 2.4k per cast lol. Shit isn't cheap.
---
Serious??? That’s insane bro
---
Imp catcher
---
Yes this could be a possibility.
---
That’s how they getcha, now you’ll have to buy membership
---
Scape bro it's chill Rune
---
It is a pretty badass pet.
---
Good on him!
---
Every time Jagex does something wholesome there’s always one asshole making a joke about it.
---
Thanks for being that guy this time so I wouldn’t have to be.
---
The damage is calculated the same tick as the animation starts. In the case of jad, you can predict the prayer because he does a special animation the tick beforehand, then switch prayers for when the projectile leaves him. 
---
Essentially the hits play means nothing, as it will be 0 if you had the right prayer in for the start of his attack.
---
A
---
i met the guy who played guthix in his videos once
---
Thats honestly a nice improvement, good on him
---
It's usually when the projectile is cast on monsters, at the same tick. For this reason, jad has special animations before the projectile is cast so you have a little bit of time to react for it. For some monsters it's before attack animation starts.
---
J1mmy’s by release series is really good. He’s a little goofier but he puts a lot of work into editing as well. And though it’s not really the same at all, if you’ve never seen jakeyosaurus’ taking a noob bossing series, then watch season 1. Its great. And his noob was hilarious before he got better at the game than I am.
---
&gt; keep on paying tens of thousands cause you got a disease.
---
the reality is no one pays those bills.
---
Not really, actually. Everyone gets the base points + their role performance. Base points are calculated how many penances were killed and role performance depending your role (hitpoints healed and eggs picked up). This means in flawless waves attacker and defender gets the equal points, but collector and healer could farm up bonus points by healing teammates and picking up multiple eggs.
---
Penalties in the other hand are deducted from each team member, no matter who does the penalties.
---
So, to answer this post's question: collector and healer are the roles for getting the most points.
---
Another life? No it gives you 1hp that's all.
---
Also one chunk Ironman is pretty good as well as framed’s gridlocked series.
---
This was my original idea but I wasn't sure how people would take it. A separate tradable item that functions the same as an ecu key. I was curious what market value it would sit at, 300-500k was my guess.
---
Sanctions are not the only form of economic war
---
Cox should have a wipe feature
---
Ah ok, thanks!
---
This idiots name is twisted nipples. I’ve seen him in game. He’s just as toxic. Real life threats, racism, nazism, etc
---
&gt;We dont know that do we?
---
your replies are eye bleach
---
This was my original idea, like a tradable item that functioned like a ecu key. I didn't know if that idea would get a good reception though. Im curious at what price it would sit at if it was balanced, ~500k was my guess.
---
You will have to do a lot of splashing to get to the point of high alching for xp
---
Unlucky with attas
---
Wholesome as fuck my g
---
&gt;Loving the pace of updates recently - this game needs way less updates and to prioritize quality over quantity. Maybe even go back to updates every fortnight?
---
what? What quality are you even on about?
---
69pussyslayer420
---
Get one with a thin point the round sponge tips are rubbish
---
He's not even good at reposting stuff, what a clown.
---
I say keep going with the Naruto memes
---
Any piece of hardware needs to be a 1:1. For instance, you can set a hotkey to click the mouse (foot pedal , keyboard button , game pad , etc.) so long as it only does one action. The double click feature would be 2 actions and against the rules.
---
Same applies for mouse keys with movement. You can have one keyboard key move your mouse and another to click the mouse but you can’t have one key that both moves and clicks the mouse.
---
In like 2006. So yeah... a *while* ago.
---
it rly do b lik tht tho
---
- now its a ghost town
---
Have you not seen the updates that this game has had over the past 4 years? Almost all of them have lead to things becoming easier/faster.
---
Hide him away in the meantime
---
I forgot i had my cat with me and died in the wilderness and it made me so sad
---
Congratulations on your PhD, it’s awesome to see neurologists that play OSRS
---
The city of Varrock has entered into an extremely unfair trade deal with the city of Al Kharid and it MUST be re-negotiated. We will not be taken advantage of.
---
Big if true
---
Well he isn't one of the play testers.
---
Clue - spade - dds - stam pot (1) or (2)
---
Well it was that way in osrs for a bit and was reverted back.
---
The tldr is actually half the player base are idiots
---
This post is about going dry at the raids, not dying.
---
It's annoying to wipe in TOB because (other than when learning), you only die when you stop paying attention/trying.  It's also generally just annoying when anyone dies because it slows down your progress and risks wipe.  When you know what you're doing, it's usually greed that causes the deaths.
---
You can complete recipe for disaster with like 1100 total level. That was THE quest of rs2. That’s good enough for me. 1500 is too high
---
This is gold lol
---
I thought that was revealed in later quests though, ones we don't have in osrs
---
it's so weird how everytime this gets reposted it gets posted multiple times
---
Thieving is really easy, got 60-75 in 6-7 hrs
---
Just join splashworlds cc and pickpocket the safespotted ardy knight at bank
---
Perfect thanks! On os I'm not even 1k total yet so I'm sure I can do everything I need to do next few months :)
---
Would devalue scythe
---
Noob question I guess but I saw this guy turn into a cape, how??
---
If you're spending hours safespotting something with a bone crossbow in a busy cannon spot or chopping at smoke devils with a d scim in zeah barrage spot you're getting crashed whether you're an iron or not.
---
The people complaining about getting crashed at smokes get me the most, literally 10 steps north and you can melee to your hearts content. At least with stuff like bloodvelds I understand it's a pain in the ass going canafis/zeah each task.
---
shrooms?
---
Q
---
ring of 3rd age
---
Then don’t give me a reason to not stay quiet... we’re both playing the same game here.
---
Idk when i was grinding mining i crashed a few bots and watch them go until they were, i assume, 6 hour logged
---
76 Agility for Zulrah is good
---
77 RC is a pretty good milestone as stockpiling bloods for bursting slayer is good for irons
---
Whats good anti gear
---
Hasnt been this way for quite some time
---
Yeah I rarely PvP, or enter Wildy in general either so they don't really benefit me the slightest. But I am in favor of the Clan Wars reworks they are currently doing and hope for it to become more popular.
---
The in game clock is in the clan chat window.
---
Can't remember who but someone made like 3 videos while in the lumby chicken farm
---
Someone tell Omnia
---
What's the difference between a job interview for a minimum wage interview and director of a company? They're both going to look if you're qualified and if you aren't an arrogant douche. 
---
What did you think would happen when you decided to insult everyone and then started to fight everyone who showed you the flaws in your reasoning?
---
Of course, my b, it's actually "S1rD1ckh34d"
---
bruh
---
I am pretty heavy on Slayer myself. Approaching 93 at the moment and 2 combat 99s so far. I sometimes like to throw some Skilling in to mix it up but usually not more than 2 or so hours at a time
---
Something iconic like mm1
---
Yeah, also an idea that stands in the way of creative diversity
---
SoulSeek
---
Well everyone has their own bad experiences, not everyone is that guy in the picture.
---
Legendary comment t
---
Chad night mode user vs virgin light mode user.
---
True, but I’m poor as fuck boiiiii
---
Dear god I hope you're afk training while you do this
---
It's a joke, I also can't work out what you mean with that double negative
---
✋🏻we don’t do that here
---
[Oh](https://i.imgur.com/dCLbDeK.png)
---
upvote for neopete, that was my ish
---
Silence, boomer.
---
no good creative director for a games as a service game would only look to themselves for inspiration. you have teams for this, the teams also listen to the community. 
---
so instead of half baked ideas that seem repetitive or not creative you get decent quality content.
---
Yeah maybe so. Tbh you can just start and alt and nmz the balls off of it though, having close to max combat will make basically every alt worth using way better.
---
This so muchb 1v1 and 2v2 would be SOOO good.
---
And two-thirds of one-fifth is the other half of the problem!
---
RNJESUS with me today!
---
I am using my android phone and it's perfect for fishing!
---
At 90 fishing i'm getting around 65k whilst being pretty afk!
---
Good luck friend!
---
Rhys321 is correct.
---
From the Wiki:
---
"It should be noted, that if a player dies in the Wilderness with a clue scroll (or reward casket) in level 20 or higher Wilderness, it WILL DISAPPEAR regardless of whether it's a PvP death or not, unless it is an item kept on death or if the player has a clue box"
---
Blast from the past, got damn
---
Chew.
---
OP is a fucking troll 😂😂😂
---
NO! BAD!
---
It’s a shame because this feels like such a gaping hole in general player lore knowledge. I would like to see a couple of lines added/re-visited in the quest to cover it properly :)
---
Isnt it tehnoobshow instead of tehnoobworld?
---
Didnt even add the 90-180s timer to clan wars even tho people tweeted that to em. Hopping from f2p to p2p back to f2p took 35s x2 alone, then you had to run from lumb spawn to bank to gdz or graves or whatever to where the fight was at for another 0-60seconds.
---
Waterfall quest will bump your melee combats up a little more for very little work and you have to ask yourself the question; do I want to have more fun or make big progressions? Agility is by no means enjoyable to train but wow is it game changing especially with graceful. Id recommend getting bird houses started too. They take less than 2 minutes to do and give good money and xp for hunter.
---
jesus christ
---
Is that new? I have NEVER kept a clue when getting pked with it unless I had a clue box.
---
I do that on my way to Revs bro dw
---
Yeah probably, but there have been a lot more since justiciar but a lot of people still only have 1 kc
---
Ah, I'm glad someone mentioned this! The way I imagined this, Siborea could have initially appeared in the 1st or 2nd age, only to be banished before she could usher in the First Ice Age. Her counterpart, the Wintertodt, would have then brought in the Second (and final) Ice Age and plunged Gielinor into a state of permanent stillness. Naturally, neither of these events actually happened. :)
---
I feel like a live chat like how Blizzard does would at least be beneficial to the game. That or at least active customer support on the forums.
---
I think , THINK, it's two different guys
---
Defend your scamming mate fella, idc lol
---
I'm at work, haven't been able to test it myself. Do we know how it works?
---
25% of 200-250 is 20-25, not 50-70, dumb much?
---
R.I.P. Woox. He’s coming for ya.
---
I've seen 1 letter username training agility, I think it was a number
---
&gt;Is it when you expect the hit splat to show up?
---
No, by time the hit-splat shows up it's too late to pray. The damage is calculated the exact same tick that the attack animations *begins*. This is true for *all* monsters in OSRS, including Jad. The only thing that makes Jad different is that he has a "pre-attack" animation, which is meant to tell you what you should be praying at the beginning of his real attack animation.
---
Only one thing tot say...
---
Nice!
---
Climate change is real. Pretending like my truck is causing it is not.
---
The climate changes. Naturally.
---
gl with that in single combat
---
Lucky af.
---
How are you killing them so fast? Gear set up? And any tips would be helpful!
---
Nope not new, you will keep it if you only have 3 items (4 with protect).
---
I usually bring a spade, teleport, clue, and dds.
---
Worse than Reds post 95 or yews post 85?
---
The videos were made by the same guy from what I can remember TehNoobShow was suspended?
---
I do need to give zmi a try as I love afk type training for slow skills and it will give me a nice surplus of a variety of runes. Do you make a nice profit?
---
Man that's nice, getting around 55k on Reds atm. Fishing will go quicker I think.
---
Yeah you are going to need to do some content before you will be able to make enough to sustain your bond.
---
Ty for the tip! Went from lvl 23-55 without training at all so I gotta get some pouches now as that’s a nice feature for them
---
I really just wanna flush that toilet
---
Hes just being pedantic. Because op said osrs, and technically "osrs" has only been out for 6 years.
---
He knows what OP means, though. Kid probably wonders why he has no friends in life.
---
Fuck that, I would quit if they made OSRS that ugly. 
---
You're also not considering that RuneScape was developed before the time people wrote code in a way that was easy to maintain, there's a shitton of legacy code they don't want to touch so they don't break the game. It's also not as if you can 1:1 port 15+ year old Java code to C#.
---
Why the fuck would it
---
Can we just delete runecraft already.
---
if i was wrong maybe, except im right so that doesnt matter
---
Glad to hear it!
---
This. Infernal eels from 80-87 will net you easily over 10M in profit and is very AFK. You never have to bank.
---
Wiki says 1/5,375–1/4,525 depending on farm lvl, I’m 70 for reference.
---
Fishing. Everything else feels too involved and I would feel like I can’t focus at work.
---
What method takes 20 hours to make 5 mil gp? :/
---
Use royal seed pod as TP
---
Some osrs youtuber does the 1 gp to twisted bow right now. You could check him
---
yeah I catched the best angle possible :D
---
So accurate lmao
---
Voting yes. 
---
Just try and change my mind. Just try it. Go on. Come with one decent reason to make me vote no.
---
Dum Dum Give Me Gum Gum
---
only interface styles, the simple stuff
---
&gt; kc i think you only need 83% for best chance at gear
---
Pretty sure the mods confirmed that KC doesn't make a difference for getting an item. The only thing that matters is killing all brothers.
---
Also you want as close to 88% as possible to maximize blood and death runes (so kill 3 skeletons). So getting over 88 may be advantageous to an ironman who uses xbow.
---
Above 88 and you get bolt racks and at 100 you can get a rare drop table roll.
---
when jagax had the influx of new players i saw someone asking for iron pants
---
He's just going to give up after hitting 10 views 20 videos in, he should make videos about things he's passionate about.
---
For fucks sake someone ban this madman
---
Nah
---
On top of these changes, swap out the Lumby tele tabs for an ardy cape and use the unlimited teleport to the monastery to recharge your prayer.
---
This is probably not the answer you want to hear, but i'd hold off on attempting to sustain membership from bonds. At least until you're close to the late game.
---
The 4m every bond period will be infinitely more valuable to invest into progressing your account, considering you're likely only going to make a few hunderd k/hr right now.
---
Use that money to get your stats higher, and better gear. Soon enough you'll be able to make 2-5m/hr and it will make more sense to sustain bonds.
---
2 buckets in 9 kc, 50kc now haven’t got a bucket since
---
&gt;mean you are talking like this on Reddit. On a gaming Reddit. I doubt any 
---
I vote in every election, local, state and federal, and I play runescape.
---
Lmao, I just did this.
---
Good luck! I hope you find ratcatchers as fun as I did. Ichtlarin's little helper was a bit of a hussle but it was okay :p
---
I believe that’s the right move as sharks are slow as hell. Might be worth to get your fishing higher at barb fishing before you switch to eels for profit.
---
But jagex won't need money the varrock bank will pay for it all
---
Not gonna lie man you got me googling. I guess my confusion comes from people who say they want "socialism" often want a social democracy as it's ridiculous to most Americans to propose something similar to State Socialist governments. 
---
God damn we have people everywhere calling each other facists, socialists, communists and 80% are using their own definition of the word. 
---
I appreciate your correction
---
Try a suffering over archers ring. Twisted buckler over dragonfire shield.
---
Wrong thread, your question belongs in the Q/A thread.
---
She listens for more than 2 seconds, it's just that first part wasn't in the clip
---
A true Ubnub
---
Catched
---
Are you in medicine? As someone who is, take it from me: here in America there is someone that dies from an illness that should have been preventable if only they had adequate health coverage, in every hospital in the country, nearly every day. 
---
Even if your assertion about other countries is true, which I have my doubts about, the question is: would we rather have people die because we only provide healthcare to the wealthy, privileged, and employed? Or would we rather have people die because we gave it our best shot to ensure that everybody gets the care they need and occasionally that meant there wasn't enough resources in a given area?
---
The answer is obvious to me. It's an absolute tragedy if someone dies at a young age from an illness that could have been treated, simply because they don't have coverage (or because even with their coverage they still go wildly into debt)
---
To kill whatever I poison without gaining do..
---
Shit dood he needs to warn her to bring an anti-fire before roasting her like that
---
yes, especially if you have Kronos seed planted in your Anima patch.
---
i start with a birdhouse run, then hit the seaweed patches nearby.
---
then do a hop run, bank, herb/flower/allotment run, bank.
---
then trees/fruit trees/mushroom/belladonna/grapes/gear for Hespori (if ready).
---
then hit the bushes/cacti patches.
---
by the time that's over, the flower patches have regrown (in about 15 minutes) so i hit those again while i'm still in my farming gear.
---
now it's been 50 minutes or more, time for another birdhouse/seaweed run.
---
that leaves about 35-40 minutes until herb/flower/allotments are all ready to be harvested together, so if i'm feeling sweaty i'll hit the Tithe Farm for a game.
---
herb/flower/allotment run again, birdhouse/seaweed, rinse and repeat.
---
Thé editing will make it break it tbh
---
Yeah he's got one subscriber from me lol I'll watch that shit all the time. Better then some of these other things. Seeing honest reactions to that shit would be gold.
---
very nice, thanks for replying. GZ on groot
---
this is what its all about my friend
---
You need to actually hit or you won't ever poison it
---
I don’t think he cares too much about views honestly he’s doing it because he just loves editing and doing YouTube itself. I mean he’s playing osrs which doesn’t really get views anyway compared to a lot of the more popular games. He’s been wanting to get into osrs for a while now so I think he’ll stick at it no matter what
---
Drops like this blow my fucking mind. Congrats mate!
---
I must've been wrong all along then, thanks! Gonna get a life again! :)
---
Eels for certain, keep in mind like half of the profit from infernals come from the tokkul so you need to do it enough to buy stuff with the tokkul, can't just do it for 1h and have enough.
---
Methods that are above 200k an hour. Telegrabbing wines, making some cooking stuff depending on prices, 
---
Stuff that is over 100k since the bond is not 5m is usually around 4m tbh. Cutting yews, tanning hides, making gold bracelets, soft clay, mining adamant, killing the new guys at Corsair cove, crafting jewelry depending on prices. While flipping some stuff on the G.E. Making obscure quest items and leaving them on the G.E to sit above normal value. For example steel war hammers are required in aid of myreque you can put them for 1k each to sell overtime and similar items.
---
Zzzzz.
---
I think the average bank is probably like 100-200m, probably higher for players doing vork
---
What now 😂
---
Didn’t think that was the case.. it poisons even without hitting doesn’t it 🤔
---
Ah, the quality content I come to this sub for.
---
AFK Nightmare Zone while at work, you can AFK for 20 minutes at a time, about to max strength tomorrow doing this.
---
What makes you think that?
---
Cuba has a world class nationalized healthcare system that puts the USA to shame. Last I checked our military didn't have much of a vested interest in their defense...
---
If youve done most quests you’ll be 1500 total or very close xoxo
---
You're just an angry pvmer that's come to the realization no matter how much you grind you'll never have what he has. You do care, it bothers you. That's why you're accusing him in a thread where you're effectively anonymous. You scammed a scythe split from me, dickweed.

He should check out BrailleSkateboarding, the owner made a video about YouTube success. :) Really, you're not going to have fun if you spend half your time on something of sub-par quality that no-one's interested in.
---
People on Reddit won't fight back against anything unless it doesn't align with their political views, especially on this sub where they have this "Keep politics out of the game" attitude while being offended when somebody isn't praising liberals/socialists/commies.
---
Lol I haven't hardly done a quest since I finished rfd and mm2
---
Awesome thanks for being pleasant. Nice stats
---
1500 total is literally reachable in a month of casual play. 1 week of nolifing. It’s a perfectly reasonable voting req.
---
I'm 90% sure this path didn't exist when I started playing. Pretty sure they added this when farming came out, might be wrong though.
---
No problem! Have a great day!
---
There's basically no point to making an alt that isn't at least 3-500k/h cuz you have to play it so much for it to even break even for bonds.
---
Infernal eel is probably the "lowest" requirement alt to set up that I think is worth it and I'd probably say that even takes several weeks (80 fishing, 70-75 ranged, 43+ prayer)
---
Unless you're an absolute NEET and play like 80 hours a week idk live your life
---
Yep. Just like people PKing or anyone playing any competitive game.
---
Plus, when you’re “killing” the monsters, it’s just watching the screen for the hit rolls. Maybe a 3 year old would find the visuals cool, but no way in hell they were “focused on killing every monster on the screen”
---
Alt no banking

He cant kill his friend if you are fighting him unless he is already in multi

Just started playing membs for the first time (actually playing, usually would only get membs to train f2p pkers) I have very low skills and base 60 cbs so I think I’m gonna try and do some starter quests that give good skilling xp

Your attempt to discredit me over my username is lame. You clearly have no clue what you're talking about here, stop pretending you do.
---
I've had 2 D meds in the last 3 slayer tasks at shamans. Jagex is trying to kill me.
---
You can just reset aviansies until you get bandos or just bring a Crystal Bow.
---
I don't know what he has, other than a username on a video game? Create all the subterfuge you need lol, everyone in 416 and the tob community knows. I made a very simple statement and you got incredibly offended by it, when if I WAS actually talking nonsense you'd treat it as such lol. Sucks to either be a scumbag or the friend of a scumbag haha.
---
Yeah that is a fair point. There is loads out there at the minute and the current trend is them ultimate iron restricted zone snooze fest videos. I’ll talk to him and show him this thread.
---
You are correct about not staying 10 hp to kill the boss, mainly because you get 2k def and hp xp from doing the required quests to start it.
---
It stands for Richard
---
Why are people downvoting this? The post reeks of bullshit. Do you guys really believe everything you read?
---
There is a method cuz level 3s can train slayer. I think I'm tedious has a youtube vid on it. I'm not familiar myself
---
I did mith darts at crabs, went surprisingly fast. Like 50k xp/hr ish to 75 if I remember. Msb(I) is faster but more expensive. Cannons and chins are also viable and faster like you said, but the gp/xp ain't too good so its up to you if you want to go that route
---
A typical three year old can without a doubt use a computer, if they've been around it and have seen it used or been taught. At my nephews third birthday party he turned my laptop on himself, opened Firefox (even though they use Chrome, so the icon was different), and was watching YouTube videos when I found him, as he'd seen the icon on my bookmarks bar.
---
Now, whether a three year old could *play Runescape*... I don't think so.

Gonna try to learn to solo COX somehow so I can get the prayers from there. Not even that good at PVM but, I wanna get better. Then inferno, and then corp for pet plus ely. Who knows if I'll have enough free time when I finally get to corp though lol.
---
I think you are confusing “only playing for a couple hours a day” with casual play
---
If you dont know enough to do stuff like go for waterfall immediately you will spend a lot of time being a casual and learning the game.
---
1500 means average skill of 65. That shit takes time. Especially if you say “i like mining” and take that well above 65. Or “fuck runecrafting” and dont level at all.
---
I started playing recently and i didnt know what an amulet of glory was for quite a while. Just because the game doesnt tell you what items are cheap and save a lot of time
---
The version of runescape a person chooses play is a pretty good litmus test of the rest of their character though

Don't quest hard right away, it may be efficient but it's not fun(atleast for me). The achievement dairies are a great way to progress acct that offer a variety of content. Good luck

Probably nothing for bosses yet. You’re pretty close to unlocking good money slayer monsters like wyverns, gargoyles, etc.

Super easy, full obsidian method using normal rumble. Use the 5 lowest level melee bosses you can use (I use king roald /me / tree spirit / vampire / snake).
---
~4 super combat potions and the rest absorption’s. Chug max absorption pots and that should sustain you for a solid hour. Open the remote every 20 min or so to drink another dose of super combat and top off absorptions.
---
With this method there is no need to lower hp constantly or need to chug overloads every 5 min. You just leave your computer on at home and access it via chrome remote to click things. 
---
I’ve done it while at work / cooking dinner / bike rides / at the movies. Anywhere where you can access your phone for like 30s and click some things will work.  Perfect for me since I only get a few hours a day on my computer (cuz life stuff). Take advantage now before they remove it...

Get a torso or sell that guthans top and put Torags on it’s cheaper and better. Then get your barrows gloves and imbue that ring, from there it’s pretty much fire cape and maybe work towards bandos or something.
---
Guess that’s what happens when you actually shit to do in your day.... You guys are so sensitive it’s like you need a friend or a hug or something lol

Do some quests. After you finish getting your Barrows gloves, set your sights on completing Monkey Madness 2 and unlocking the ability to kill Demonic Gorillas. Each time you get a black demon Slayer task, you can choose to kill Demonic Gorillas for a hefty profit. A task of 200 Gorillas is something like 12m in loot.

Funnily enough the armour came around 10 months before the dark bow, only problem is that it takes a large amount of time due to requiring 2400 castle wars tickets, which is ~600 hours of winning games (~300 fastest possible boosting). The Golden tench and Champion's cape are recent additions however.

Get that torso ASAP the +4 str bonus is great. Ofc Fire cape for the same +4
---
 Guess you could get obby legs too
---
Yew logs are both better gp and xp

really you could do iron bars at the blast furnace for like 300k/hr

or cannonballs for 200k/h

those are both far better than magics/yews for gp

That's exactly the point. If he already had ranger boots and still needed more pie, then chompies would be worth it. Because he's doing ranger boots in the future, he's going to wind up with *even more pies*, beyond what he needs.

This would be abused to hell. The chain of custody that an item goes through over the hours/days/weeks it might take for them to process an abuse report would make it basically impossible for them to refund items (without killing the economy in the mean time).

Yes, obviously. He said the only reason that European countries can afford to sustain their national healthcare systems is because the USA is paying for their defense. Cuba has an amazing nationalized healthcare system and has absolutely nothing to do with NATO.

I just finished up 99 cooking with sharks/karambwan. Took 2 weeks afking in kourend with gloves. Made a few mil too

You might want to be checked for anhedonia
---
Don't worry about anything over 15 mil for a while.  Focus on skill upgrades.  Most gear upgrades are marginal and 10 levels matter a lot more.  You probably need to be doing zulrah/vorkath or raids before buying that stuff.

Yeah people bitch a lot, but I had 0 troubles doing both with a kitten. Even got a hellkitten out of it, but I gave it away for the death runes and bank space.

2 skeletons and one bloodworm, or just 4 bloodworms.
---
Seems like a PK'er thing to say...
---
Well, how do you expect to increase the framerate without increasing the number of frames within the actual animation? Not sure if game engines actually tween the animation on the go, but it sounds pretty logical to me that animation durations are implemented by number ticks. Increasing fps without changing models would mean decreasing tick duration.
---
For some reason their first choice was Flash with ActionScript. 🤔
---
No clue. I didnt' research it. Just assumed gems would be better
---
No i was just killing him for the 1st time for the fremenik elite diary and got the tassets. I did the normal tank method.
---
Well I normally do 1 bloodworm and 2 skeletons as that tends to be the fastest (without going over 88%) but that only gives around 86%. Other people do other combinations such as 3 skeletons (this puts you over 88% slightly so you'll occasionally receive bolt racks however).
---
Those bots aren't really used to find people using rev weapons, but rather mostly for people skulled with ags or claws.  Also if you know you're getting scouted then just tele out before you get tb'd, not that hard.
---
I dont really understand what this is doing, but in interested.
---
But no cigar
---
Jokes on you, the days before I kill myself are numbered so the odds are in my favor
---
Where'd you learn that?
---
The animations aren't drawn frame by frame, but I see how that might have mislead you, sorry for being a bit rude.

The engine on pc refreshes 50 times per second, so no matter how good your pc, it cant surpass that fps.

Well I’m sure having that name was fun while it lasted

It literally saves a hardcore Ironmans status. I do not understand what you don't understand about this.
---
Generally I use the highest slayer master i can. You will not be assigned anything you dont have the slayer requirement to kill. Better rates for the most part. Happy grinding :D
---
The golem would just attack you but sometimes the rocks would start smoking and would explode and destroy your pick
---
if you can do it, people are botting it lol
---
Swap the helm out for a black mask, whilst slaying it gives a 16.67% att and str boost. When you have the points upgrade to the slayer helm.
---
If you want to mage or range a task get the black mask imbued from nmz as it will give a 15% accuracy and damage boost to both. The imbue will not be lost when upgrading to a slayer helm. You should also imbue your berserker ring as it will increase your max hit by 1.
---
If you want to lvl melee easily and very afk use obby armour with the berserker necklace and an obby sword with your BiS gloves, boots and Cape at nmz.
---
I got bucket on kc 5 :) I sold it.

(Castle Wars is always running btw)
---
I mean no flame but it’s a kinda clickbaity title.
---
Yeah, I had an inner debate about this myself whether I should post this joke, but I hope the 1 or 2 guys actually going through this can still laugh about it while they are here.
---
I missed a champion's scroll other day. I didn't see it and it just...disappeared into the void :(
---
Rip lil scroll buddy
---
im holding a whip xD
---
and a ship out on the water has anti teleportation properties? XD
---
Just a heads up, GWD is shit money CoX is whatever and gorillas is more gp/hr than zulrah. If you meant vork sure but zulrah is shit atm
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
---
Have you been to world 334? Castle Wars is always running, often with 50+ people.

pretending to be what way?
---
You used to see peoples items after 60 seconds when they died, Jagex changed it because they are too cheap to outsource their ddos protection
---
Yeah great strategy when the tber can just walk the fuck away after tbing you.
---
Big LOL.
---
No he was saying that it's always been like this. They expect the original jmod wanted it to move, but it bugs out after the first movement to the spot we know of and cannot move again.
---
I got 99 cooking and made 5m in two weeks of VERY afk cooking. 200-400k xp an hour. Wasn’t too bad.
---
Damage is calculated and sound plays on the same tick.
---
Is that the name the IRA are going with these days? Seems very uncatholic to me.
---
its an abyssal whip dont you see the pointy thing at the end. xD
---
Yup :) https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dxu8xuKU8AASCNu.jpg . I think the CW helmet technically takes more time though. Plus reclaiming the hats is super annoying on UIM. Takes soo much inventory to get to the gold one. Also need to rebuy the bow everytime.
---
Oh wow yea that would be a good idea, I can see why people are salty at mods for not implementing this. Thanks :)
---
Fucking Sherlock, because of his task I have to spend another 25hrs at barb fishing...
---
Yeah he shoulda just dropped a stack on the ground for me

“No fee” except that your second lowest tax bracket starts at 33% and your minimum wage is $19 an hour. You pay huge fees without even realizing it.
---
“Dead minigame” yet the official CW world has full games running all day lol
---
Love this look
---
just trying my best. im sorry it doesnt please you, i will do better next time for you :)

If you have prayed ranged any tick before the sound effect plays then you're good

Ah, good. Don't mess with my karambwan!

So as long as you weren't using alts you're probably fine.

Hell, even if you did use alts, as long as it was on an unofficial world where nobody else is impacted, you're probably fine.

More likely at this point we will see a resolution to the fairy quest first. If I recall correctly the schedule was morytania quest —&gt; elves quest —&gt; zeah quest —&gt; fairy quest. 
---
Realistically we are a year away from them even starting a maharrajat quest, unless somehow the zeah or the fairy quest are a tie in

I’m not denying that there are people in society that need support such as those who suffer real disabilities and cannot work.

I believe it's a number of factors, and I'd guess the big one is looking for a series of progressively better attempts from an account or from an IP before successful completion. If you just get a new IP and then complete it first try, you'll get flagged.
---
If you have the money, get a cannon and use that on stuff like kalphite and dagonnath tasks to get your ranged up quickly
---
They should add them back into the game as a rare lottery spawn among the newer models. Same with dragons and demons. 1/1000 would be cool. 1/256 chance to drop a disk of returning.

Nope the bot took u down hahah

I'm most interested in knowing what all the cosmic bodies are on the large orerry in the poh study.

What bug did they use?

Vorkath kill? Lemme check on the rewards.... hmmm yes... yes...  you get a summer pie with 500 gp to buy yourself free dinner.

Wasn't that one mostly dead and Zaros and Seren were tasked with taking care of it?
---
Make yt videos while playing? Yeah sure....? Your „friend“ can do what he ever wants lmao. why you asking us?

Excepting lots of people watch it and get massive support from reddit? Most likely not- idea doesnt sound that good at the first place, doesnt sound interesting and the „market“ for osrs videos is already kinda filled what ever you want to find.
---
good point gave her the benefit of the doubt turns out shes good and possibly just tired/didnt care enough to try more on sea shanty? She was able to do far superior plays by listening once and playing compared to this (assuming she doesnt actually listen to other songs and play them off screen which is more realistic )
---
streamer faking is a huge thing but hey shes still pretty good but she dropped the ball hard here

also my talent isnt piano, i was born with a 9 inch dong, ill be more than happy to send you some of my talented vids but you gotta be 18+

Damn this is awesome

They are all bald and half of them are wearing green. Looks like bots indeed!

What'll happen to already owned imbues anyway? Will you need to grind 60 warding to imbue a slayer helm, and a berserker ring?
---
Oh, I only do slayer because it’s my favorite thing to do (aside from clue scrolls) and I’m gonna see if I can get untrim. Thank you for the info!

According to the wiki, it's over 389 hours assuming you won every game and that doesn't include wait time.

You should be able to defeat her, and if you run low on food you can [flinch her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnzOP3LU8VE).

Yes, and RuneScape uses ticks to determine at what speed the game runs.

Tweening is how animations used to work, you make a couple of frames and your computer decides what motion happens between those frames. Other than individually drawing every frame there weren't any other options in the time RuneScape 2 was released.

Is this chick a porn start or something? I remember seeing someone saying that on the other thread? I thought originally that it was a joke or something

That’s what I mean, if you hear the ranged noise and you’re not already praying range then Jad is sending you to the shadow realm

Btw

Not if the depression from the ironman grind to 77 rc makes me kill myself first.

Lol, I got both shards b2b a year and a half ago and at some point just stopped trying to get the rest

It's genuinely funny that someone mirroring your attitude in a reply to you is upsetting lmao.

apparently Konar mentions it when you get a zanaris task

Are you implying that rising average global temperatures mean that everywhere on earth should be setting record high temperatures every day?

I'm guessing you've never taken any statistics or even thought about anything very hard.

Honestly OP is fucked. He didn’t even black out his stamina, and only the last number in his total level is obscured.

I love how they have to brag as well

Ahh! Keep it in the leprachuan and do it between herbs and bird houses on my first herb run of the day. Don't need to change gear to rake and pick berries. :)

I'm sure the sweet green dollar bill***$*** are a great motivator
---
The way you phrased it, boosting CW is like being granted parole :\^)
---
IDK why you think i'm trolling. it's the equivalent of in a shooter when you try to shoot over a wall, but the bullet hits an invisible spot near the wall that really shouldn't be there; my point is that the visuals do not match up with the gameplay. Basically, he had the mage prayer on well before the fireball hit him therefore the prayer should have blocked it.  it truly boggles my mind that something like this remains in the game for 10+ years. at least make it so the mage prayer has a small charge up time that would account for it not really being active for

 a few seconds after you clicked it. as it is the game is lying to you.

That's like asking how it tastes when you mix chocolate ice cream with shit
---
I'm assuming he'll add the people who are helping him catch them so they can just privately pm him.
---
Doubt he'd devalue the achievement by cheating like that
---
The best profit from slayer comes from doing the boss variants of tasks for example dagannoth kings. I recommend going with friends to bosses such as those until you get a feel for it/ higher stats.
---
It's quite helpful to afk nmz when you can't pay full attention to the game so you can get high stats for bossing I know that might not be the best course for getting untrim slay but you'll have to decide if that's worth it for you since going for untrim will make you less money
---
&gt; like double the gp/hr of yews.
---
its actually ~20% less

Porn and porn.

If that was condescending to you, you need to do some serious work on getting thicker skin.

hm hours of yews do i have to do to afford a car
---
I gave him a guam once to see if that does anything... nope!

maybe allow multiple colors to be used for search.
---
Also maybe a player model wearign selectable items (although this would be quite a lot of work probably) to try on your outfit

I'll just end up forgetting it! 😅

I think ironmen thieve in that area bc it's close to the food stalls

How do we get Elon Musk to buy JaGeX?

Was gonna call him out on it, too. Glad to know not everybody is as gullible as people who give away cash stacks lmao
---
You won't have the ability to make it. You actually use a dyed silverlight to kill the boss, the boss's blood upon death turns it into a Darklight, so it's literally impossible to have Arclight before the completion of this quest.
---
except before eoc it was required for the trimmed comp cape and was the most hated requirement by an absolute mile. Id rather get 99rc twice

Didn't see that one lmao!

Obv sparc, sparc cant sell his bank cuz he streams

Lol good idea

Very nice!

Slam packed on weekends. Packed at night PST.

This happened to me back in 2010. My setup was way more potato haha. I was using a dragon sq shield and guthans body and legs... craziest moment of my runescape career, I think. An irl friend was at my house and watched me get my first ever boss kill, bandos solo for tassies
---
What does this mean for the game? Should we expect changes? Or are they hands off?
---
It worries me that an aggressive PE firm purchased it - but that doesn’t mean anything will change.
---
Hoping a Jmod can help us understand what this means!
---
The climate changes naturally over the course of millions of years.  The current observed changes in climate are of equal scale in change but on a time scale of 100 years or less.  The greenhouse effect is a well documented scientific fact and the increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is a measurable observation.
---
Yes, the climate has changed before, the earth will be fine, humanity on the other hand will struggle with rising sea levels and increased extreme weather conditions.
---
This outfit could look cool (not that it doesn't already!) with infinity/eternal boots because the shade of blue would match the armour more.
---
Why did you write "crisis"?
---
Dumb comment award
---
Hope he is right. Custom clients served a purpose back when jagex considered osrs a side project but theyve gone far beyond tue point if simple overlays and data tracking.
---
I felt I was flying looking at those hunter levels go by
---
Good God. For a cheap car even ($6k) 13,712 hours of yew chopping if you make 250k gp per hour.
---
WHAT THE FUCK. WRONG, I NOW KNOW

He will for sure do that

Dum dum want gum gum

He literally said he wished he'd gotten more people to help when catching the baby implings

Go settled!

There’s a 0% chance he doesn’t

Wearing 2004 Green D'hide for 2003 method of getting herbs.
---
He already did it with the baby imps, without scouts it would take so long
---
What happens if he dies in temple trek? Would that kill the series seeing how far he’s gone?
---
Hahaha, these things can be hard to get in the habit of indeed. (Fuck, tears was today :() I used my OSBuddy (Ew, the past was gross) notes and wrote the date (and time) down for my dailies :) Was super effective!
---

Have him do lava runecrafting

Ah yes because making a meme takes fucking hours. This meme probably took about as much time to make as the time you've spent in this thread alone.

Swamp man good

Our dumbass country is full of people that are willing to listen to talking heads tell us “communism is bad!” And take it at face value rather than read any communist theory or look at vital pertinent statistics of the USSR. If communism was truly a failed ideology, the USA wouldn’t need to intervene every time a South American country democratically elects a socialist.
---
His hunter level is 93 at the time I write this comment lol.
---
*sigh* happy birthday Michael
---
Man up and go for it, the death mechanics are very forgiving, you won’t lose anything. That’s exactly what I’ve been doing since I got membership for the first time a few months ago, I’ve died quite a few times learning bosses I’ve never attempted before but that’s just part of learning to “git gud”
---
Cannons are already powerful and AFK, but this would be a nice ornament kit.
---
Rendi definitely deserves one for his lower the better series, I loved settled but nothing is more entertaining than a new rendi video for me.
---
I understand that as well but if he has mental issues he should be streaming fair and simple. Twitch is full of trolls that will trigger his problems so he should stay away if it gets to him that bad
---
its alright dude not like people from iceposeidon2 reddit where swatting paul denino at a nonstop rate. if you wanna approve of the behavior of toxic swatters and callers go for it, but i wanted to speak against it. idk why you half to dig through my profile all day though :( must not much to do besides hang out on here all day :(
---
As I understand, you have to have the cleaned herb in your inventory. I've never personally done it.
---
Corporations get more welfare than citizens could ever dream of.
---
The game is about grinding so I kinda have fun grinding the cash out
---
No $11 crab memes for me
---
true followers can lift you up so much, plus there can be a big mental burden that your letting down so many people by not streaming
---
Yeah!
---
They were actually changed because of Lizard Squad DDOSing the worlds a few years ago. It was genuinely a pain to play this game at the time. What Jagex can do now is just make it so your items simply disappear after a few minutes instead of them instantly appearing for others/appearing after a few minutes. It'd be an item sink and win/win for the economy.
---
Ah the old “upvote trap.” The image is clearly saying “this thing happens,” so if you agree then you upvote. The title says “this thing doesn’t happen,” so if you agree with *that* you upvote.
---
Lame.
---
Well he has said that he supports higher taxes and government watch over many things and suggested it would not be out of the question to have 70 80 and 90 percent tax. If these are things he has and does push for now the elimination of social class is definitely not out of the question
---
hahaha XD
---
If they give a max hit, they’re worth it. They often don’t but it’s dependent on your str lvl/other gear so you’d have to use a dps calc for your specific setup.
---
add bandos bosses to the catacombs too
---
&gt; to spend tens of thousands on the game to gain a tiny benefit
---
The benefits of using binds to do RWT legit can be big if the gp is used to buy the fastest xp rates for buyable skills as well as buying the best pvm gear possible as soon as they unlock the level to us them. Have you seen the mom's credit card warrior posts this sub has had? 
---
&gt; Because it doesn't impact me in the slightest.
---
Yes it does. It devalues the achievements of players who got them without P2W.
---
When did this sub get so tolerant with MTX?
---
!Remind me 6 hours
---
Actually more hype for this finale than GoT
---
I don't really get what you're trying to say... we don't start 'tracking' after the first one drops.  By your logic the chance of getting a d med from kbd is 100%, which is just wrong
---
the drop rate is the drop rate, and in this case it's 1/128, regardless of whether you've already received one
---
Congrats dude.   Took me 321 for the archers.   While it was annoying I was able to take 4 different friends to rex and got them their b rings.   Shortly after I got dwh at 247 kc so I guess it evened out.   :p
---
Idk if you can get 400+ logs an hr at 99 since I'm not 99 wc myself but I do know at like 80 ish wc magic logs is a lot better money since that's where I'm at rn.
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
Filler episode
---
I get in 4 kills with melee (max combat) but that's pretty different from your setup lol
---
I didn't find it too hard to get a hell kitten. I even accidentally fed it milk and turned it back into a regular kitten then went back and turned it into a hell kitten again.
---
Have you pked before?. If you're just starting I'd suggest a low level 50 attack pure. 50attack 60 strength and 70 range would be a good start
---
guthix  is just like 1k to complete is all. If you can afford ancient go for it.

Who did he shit on?

The double standards are funny. This community hated it so much when Lowlander did bandos with an alt because it broke the spirit of the ironman that the fucking rules of the game were changed, yet they'll happily let Settled and Verf have a ton of people search every single world for imps or MMORPGrs have a clan of 20+ people constantly protect him 24/7 at revs. That's really in the spirit of solo gameplay right.
---
I just afk fished to grow my kitty. Can easily spend hours doing that and you always have food for it.
---
You said rs3, how is anyone supposed to know you're talking about pre eoc? Don't attack me because you can't clearly communicate.
---
Thanks I didn't know that
---
Whining about taxes, flair indicates that you’re an ezscape crybaby... you just have nothing but bad opinions don’t you
---
yeah it is, and because of bonds you can even play the game for free.
---
Out of the loop as I have no idea who he is, what's the context here?
---
how does death mechanics being changed help hcim? if they die theyre actually punished
---
I love this!   
---
I wish bone warmth was a skill :3
---
Are people completing or dropping beginner clue scrolls? 
---
The few I have done have taken longer than an easy to complete and have netted me a total of about 79gp... It seems far too inefficient to actually complete them.
---
You act like you never seen a noob before, jaws dropped to the floor like zezima signed into your world
---
HUNTER BAD
---
yep, that’ll happen.
---
You do realize that you're a human being speaking to another, right? Grow the fuck up.
---
Runescape players aren't generally known for their social skills honestly
---
Amen
---
They’re definitely numerous but there’s also a lot of great people playing. Unfortunately you’ll just have to filter through 
---
Complimented somebody on their username (Bread Shoes? Great concept) the other day and was was met with just ridiculous jabs - you just never know and have to move forward.
---
My password is most likely leaked in one of the [public collections from earlier this year.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/17/breached-data-largest-collection-ever-seen-email-password-hacking)
---
How’s it been going??
---
it doesn’t say bone warmth anywhere
---
The splashes take breaks like every hour or someone fucks up the knight I Cba. This place only requires you and a dragon spear spec.
---
Why is this getting downvoted? Are people really that petty towards people who can actually get with someone?
---
You monster
---
Bank made
---
An exclamation, usually sarcastic, about the value of a drop or other benefit. Particularly used of drops (such as dragon boots) which used to be extremely valuable and are now merely "nice".
---
Yeah I died so often when afking, for example in the middle of a quest when letting run energy recharge.
---
And add a bank
---
Not if you don't do slayer
---
:)
---
Can I kill Jad through the healers if I use a blowpipe with dragon darts? I have 95 ranged.
---
Probably through Evil Chicken magic, and IIRC it's underground.
---
I’ll be training there soon but gotta get the slayer points
---
It says so in my comment ;)
---
account recoveries remove your 2fa on your account and assign you account to a new email address, so both of those are useless due to the recovery system. Which Jagex just admitted, is broken.
---
The pin bypassing is usually due to a screen recorder / share trojan.
---
Plate of bacon bad
---
Far worse.
---
But next week is July (((
---
What's that bond symbol for and do on the mini map
---
Google aoc border
---
Death mechanics were changed because people were DDOSING servers for people’s bank. But carry on
---
Atleast you didn't get the pet.. Or he'd be gone.
---
It’s a lot easier to tank f2p pkers tho
---
And I'm saying 71 isn't high. People who don't want to skill for 10 hours are gonna complain regardless, though I personally never really see the point in skill requirements on quests so I'm not too bothered either way
---
I played 03-05 and my first day back in lumby I saw a guy splashing afk in full rune (g). I watched him ignore a the drunken dwarf and got so excited knowing that I was about to snipe little timmy for his whole ~~armor set~~ bank. "maybe later..." The most disappointing change imo.
---
Fuck the smoking rocks though
---
I think he would've understood what was going on if he saw that, given the store name
---
Bless YOUR creator
---
You are a dick
---
unfortunately no. i tried to go back on mobile dressed up in my shitty melee gear to get the 40 minion kc and forgot zamorak/saradomin items. almost died, got away, got sad and pissed off, logged out to prevent brain aneurysm.
---
Doubtful. Killing through the healers is a meme tbh. Just git gud and lure the healers off. It's not what you wanna hear but it is simply the best answer.
---
DDS GO!
---
How much did he pay for his gf?
---
To me, the scum is part of the game’s charm. Gives me a nostalgic 2007 “Wild West” RS feeling.
---
I fucking love this man. Fuckin legend.
---
Thanks y'all!
---
Go get obsidian armor, zerker necklace, and an obsidian sword. Get good exp bosses (use a calc like [bitterkoekje's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit#gid=158500257) to figure that out). It's not hard or complicated, if you're just after exp.
---
They're not worth imo. If they add a milestone reward for them I'll do it but until then meh
---
wow.. did they really host to a million(s) players??
---
It does
