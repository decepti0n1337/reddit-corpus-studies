the ehp is actually listed as 90k/h but people have demonstrated across multiple weeks that 100k/h average is possible, ehp just doesn't currently reflect that.

Just do slayer. From 75-80 slayer i made almost 20m

This is the worst post I've ever seen

Your lack of human compassion over the integrity of your hobby in playing a shitty 20 year old browser game is ridiculous. What a weird moral high ground to take on people literally using this as a means of sustaining their lives.
---
Lol yikes

Would OSRS players want pre-EoC Nex in the game?

Been trying to complete the corrupted gauntlet for thte 1st time. I think I am 0-80 at this point.

this just means you have found your true goal in runescape!, dont go for the easy fix! got get maxed!!

and they make more money than settled...
---
Mom! He‚Äôs copying me. Make him stop. I‚Äôm the only one who can use text to speech.
---
Really? How much have they done in the realm of player support and account security in the past five years?
---
There's plenty to be done, just not much actually being done. Unless you believe the blog post, which would be pretty generous of you considering their history.
---
I think they have to be more transparent. Give us some periodic updates or literally even mention that it's still in progress. Otherwise it just looks and feels like PR and damage control without any intention of following through.

The amount of work to cut and pose this as compared to taking a screenshot blows my mind

... this morning we got a 3 way d claws split at 128kc. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN

What slayer master did you use and what tasks did you block? It seems like i usually get tasks that bring in little to no money

"Gl next"

People arent afraid of f2p wildy I guess
---
Yeah post your comment to that sub cuz you dont understand the reference
---
No worries. My gear set up is full justiciar, lance, dfs, tort, suffering (recoil enabled), infernal, insulated boots, ferocious gloves. Inventory is 2 dose super combat, 2 dose antifire, 5 super restores, rune pouch (house tele runes and nats), lavas, bonecrusher and the rest of the invent is sharks (20 of em). I almost always leave with a full inventory (or at most, 4 spaces empty), so the alchs are pretty essential and save a lot of space. I think I'm getting around 12-20 kills per inventory. There's a lot of variance between runs, so it's hard to say exactly. 
---
I highly recommend justiciar and dfs over bandos and avernic. If you're doing it on an alt then it makes it waaay more afk, even if it's technically a slight reduction in kills/hr. I tried even tankier setups with fury and barrows gloves, but those seemed to be a minimal defence increase (fury and barrows gloves are good if you're taking magic damage, but you are protecting magic here) for a significant decrease in dps.
---
Thanks m8.
---
There's no reason they couldn't completely rework the drop table, though I'm seriously out of ideas for high level pvm drops. I think jagex is too and it shows with their big pvm content bring the gauntlet this year
---
Konar is even better points for the 10th task, I always do her
---
I'd argue it's closer to hyperbole than a strawman, but good job avoiding it.

Gear wise aim for:
---
Dragon Scim, Dragon Defender (warriors guild - requires 130 combined att and Str levels), Helm of Neitznot ( quest req), Fighter Torso (Barb Assault), Dragon Boots, Obsidian Legs, Amulet of Glory/Fury, Combat Bracelet/Best RFD gloves 
---
You'll need to do some quests and also train up stats a bit, 60 defence will be required for some of these gear upgrades but you want them cos they give strength bonus and that gives the best increase in DPS. Which means you deal more damage and get more experience per hour when training melee. 
---
As for prayer flicking, honestly just check it out on YouTube and you'll find some ok guides. Play around with it yourself. But basically since the game runs on intervals of time called 'ticks', there's a specific tick in which your enemy will deal damage to you. And in that tick you'll have the protection prayer up and then turn it off straight away so that 1) you take no damage and 2) you lose minimal prayer points since you turned it off so fast.

I mean the knock-off rapier is just finishing the trifecta of watered down chaotics with G.Rapier vs CR, new LS(don't know the name) vs CLS and Elder maul vs CM. It fits with what they were going for.

As for drop ideas, yeah, it's rough without coming up with new drops since nex sets will never pass a poll if pvp armors couldn't.

You do realize how ridiculous your implications are, right?

You dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb bitch, totally and completely irrelevant to what's being said you dumb DUMB dumb bitch. I didn't tell him to go out there and be a fuckin saint, I told him to get over the integrity of the game because these people are dEvAlUiNg Gp.
---
You dumb bitch, I didn't say he's not stating facts, in FACT my first statement was no one is trying to have Jagex solve the issue but moreover we're okay with turning a blind eye to something that is INCONSEQUENTIAL to our fuckin relatively privileged lives so these people can FEED THEIR FAMILIES.
---
I'm not doubting him saying the people voted in the current government, but blanket fuckin statements mean nothing to the reality of a situation that none of use REALLY TOTALLY UNDERSTAND, you DUUUUUUMMMMBBBB bitch.
---
Jesus fuckin Christ Muhammad Abraham Buddha you dumb bitch why did you even type out your comment as if you really thought you GoT mE after farting out that train of thought. I didn't tell him to go volunteer, or donate, or try and solve the issue himself, I didn't ask of him any REAL active effort beyond getting over some venezulan bot farmers in this fuckin game. 
---
Fuckin good one man, you're right I am probably a hypcrotical, incompassionate bitch sometimes but I don't think this was that time.
---
Yeah China has been dumping since the 90s to get the edge on western manefacturers. The US definitely didn't fire the first shot in that trade war. Also the US has almost zero involvement in Iran. Only thing there is sanctions because Iran wont come to the table.
---
Venezuela's problem is a centrally controlled economy that has been completely mismanaged with heavy subsidies to keep the people happy and keep the govt in power finally catching up. Those dudes just spent more money than they had. The US is definitely leveraging the situation to get another country on their side, but they didn't create it. This has been ongoing in Venezuela since like 1994.

Picking up unnoted essence one-by-one sounds worse than doing standard runs though.
---
Yeah guess I've learned a lesson.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs kinda understandable, bond prices are insane to buy with real cash and turn into GP. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense when you can sometimes get like 4x as much for the same amount. People buying gold will always have a market, we live in the instant gratification generation. And that first 100-200 mill really makes a difference in setting up your account to make boat loads more very easily.
---
&gt; Only thing there is sanctions because Iran wont come to the table.

Yeah it would have been crazy if Iran had came to the table before hand, made a deal, and then the US pulled out. lol that would have been ridiculous

when I was starting out I was killing moss giants in full Sara rune on my phone and eating lunch. I got really into the show and totally forgot I was on osrs on my phone. Like 40 or 45 minutes later, my phone is dead, so ofc I‚Äôm logged out and dead

I run to my laptop and run to varrock ready to hop in every world to check. I forgot my fuxkinf knife or slash wep so I run back to the bank and back to mossies and LUCKILY find my shit just minutes before it would despawn

But one can make the argument that it does not need to be 2 slices of bread, but rather a single one. Either cut or folded. So then... is a taco a sandwich?

Honestly idk, as painful as it is to see, no one wants to do anything about it.

I guess they would be vocal when them making that extra mil or not is the difference on whether they can afford to buy rotting meat for the day or not.

Holy shit how is that even possible?

I think Jagex can bust a lot more bots but they don't because it's revenue. It also helps us because it keeps prices down while also keeping mtx away, as a sudden drop in revenue due to large bot busting systems would definitely make mtx more likely.

You're not wrong in your opinion but you're wrong to be upset that youtubers are doing it if you're not worrying about every other person using/abusing alts

Runescape has run on bots forever. Imagine if 10 years ago there were no bots. Supplies would be astronomical. Similar to slave labour. If we introduced a basic income to all scapers, perhaps we could survive without bots.

I am Venezuelan, and I have been lucky enough to leave the country in 2014 to get an education here in America. It is honestly fucking depressing. Most of my friends are poor as fuck, those who have left the country in search for better opportunities, and have a Bachelor's degree, are taking shitty jobs such as cleaning bathrooms at Mcdonald's just to get by. Venezuela was once a very happy place to be - it was fun, cozy, and just overall good. Everything has changed now however, and it fucks with my mind every time I think about it.

Define bread then, is flat bread not bread? Does bread require a rising agent? Just saying man...

You think those bots are buying one month memberships? they're barely putting food on the table but they'll pay 11$ for membership and the possibility of having that account banned? They're using the free trial lol.

yeah but like if the choices are let people starve to death or feed people isnt it a pretty obvious choice?

How does anyone make money at revs? I tried a few times and just got killed every time. Sometimes I hadn't even been there more than 4 minutes.

No they play all of the roles, there is nothing wrong with venezuela besides everything that isn't socialism. Socialism couldn't possibly be at fault.
---
Do you think murder is wrong?
---
I'm sure you do. Everyone does.
---
Now, why aren't you dedicating your life to stopping murders across the world?
---
Oh you're not doing it? I guess that makes you a hypocrite.
---
This is the argument you're making. It's a bad argument. Don't make it.
---
&gt;You're throwing out the entire comparison because of minor details.
---
Because the "minor" details matter, another really factor that's changing is that we somewhat know the JMods. We see their personalities, can put their names to faces, and what they do for the game, so that also influences the hypothetical question by adding more weight to affected party. The change in premise assumes that all lives are equal to everyone, which isn't a true premise and completely changes the question.
---
I wish we had more duo bosses

&gt;	That's right, I literally am, it doesn't. What a clever fucking deduction. You sound very triggered by this opinion, you pathetic, powerless little fucking keyboard warrior.

imo a lot of people agree BP needs nerfing but they don't want to actually suffer the loss in DPS and gp/hr they'll face if one actually comes
---
I'm not even saying mine is the best idea. Some people were suggesting lowering the range str of it which also works, i just think since some content has already been balanced around the BP speed/strength, this would allow for it to still be used in the same way just a little less accurate
---
There are 190+ countries in the world. Venezuela and the USA are two of them. Venezuela can trade with any of the other 190+ countries if they‚Äôd like to (and they do!). The US has little to no involvement in Venezuela‚Äôs economic crisis. You can blame poor decision making and government corruption on the nation‚Äôs crisis but blaming the US without evidence is founded on conspiracy or lies propagated by Maduro‚Äôs authoritarian socialist regime.

You have to face six jads.

i tried posting it to get more feedback but i don't have the time/skills to do the whole black background yellow text meme shit and so all the responses were just useless

i'm afraid this isn't satire
---
How does that make it crazier
---
&gt; I‚Äôd much rather jagex just turn a blind eye and let these people feed their families than try to actually ban them.
---
Funny enough, it's partially the fact that what they do is against the rules that creates such a demand for their services that allows them to thrive in the first place. If selling gold weren't something that were against the rules, there are groups of people out there that can (and do) make money much more efficiently than killing green dragons with green dhide and therefore would be able to run them out of business just by virtue of the sheer volume of gold they could produce if they weren't worried about their accounts getting banned.
---
With that, I don't mind Venezuelans in the sense that I don't think there's anything I could do to realistically stop them or reverse the negative impact they have on the game economy, so worrying about it is a waste of my time. However, I'll still kill and report obvious gold farmers on sight. It's part of the game they're choosing to feed their families with, and it isn't my job or place to scrutinize the potential real life circumstances of everyone I see breaking the rules. 
---
**Don't get me wrong,** I don't fault these people for doing desperate things in desperate times, ruining the economy of a 20 year old children's games is one of the most innocuous things they could be doing to feed their families, and I guarantee in their position I'd do much much worse things if it came to my family's survival.
---
tl;dr Getting banned is a literal occupational hazard of breaking the rules and they deal with it pretty well.

Correct. Sorry to say if you are a fan of them. Olm is really repetitive and super easy to beat. Verzik with a learning curve you can easily be carried by your team with no risk factor aside from paying 100k to get your stuff back. What we need are dungeons where you have to run and get your stuff back. Everything remotely challenging is instanced and kind of boring..

Ah you can make that back in no time! I believe in you

Lucky dude. I remember years ago I was on my computer by the window and I heard popping sound and I instantly knew it was a fire. Turned around and the neighbours house was going up. That shit was gutted to fuck in minutes, never been that close to a fire before. Gladly no one died or anything.
---
I didn't heal until right as I killed the last healing pillar, then chugged brews, and chug again after the big hit. That way you're constantly doing damage to her while you can instead of trying to heal up the whole fight. Don't forget with brews you can sip one and attack her then sip another etc, even tho your mage lvl is brewed down you can still do a little bit of dps while healing.
---
I didn't even bother with blood spells

The account is fine if the con wasn't straight outta 2016, and you didn't ignore the easy 99 in farming. Everything else is totally normal for a slayer prod.

Well I hate to be a macroefficient nerd. But even picking up a job to fund GP is inneficient, because you can't earn XP at the same time. From an XP perspective, GP is considered 0 time since alts have become the norm.

Yup both extremes do seem to attract similar types of people.  The whole ideology of oh companies are pushing inclusivity and something something SJW agenda. Now as to the quest dialogue, I haven't done the quest but from what I've seen the dialogue isn't really that big of a deal.
---
I don't even think OSRS is even the first game to have an NPC's dialogue refer to someone's character as "player"  instead of "he" or "she". Or "you."

Since I wanted to complete the quest at the lowest possible level, I had to stay 10hp. I figured, since I was going to be 10hp anyways, I may as well do something with it :p
---
Man, a few months ago when the lucky imp grind was announced I thought it sounded dumb and unrealistic. I FREAKING LOVE IT. I am so excited for Lucky Imp luck! Verf u are a legend
---
Hello there
---
a 10% hp boost is in no way worth 10% extra prayer train that would be a nerf to the armour set not a buff lol. That extra 10hp is not making up for the extra p pot youd end up taking and the 10% hp effect becomes useless asoon as you get hit once anyway unless you are constantly eating to full which is pretty much never necessary outside of if your a HC

Same for dota. Dota is nothing but violence and hatred.
---
? its about allocating resources. by putting fewer manhours into bot busting and implicitly allowing RWTing theyre helping goldfarmers. nobody is suggesting they start PUTTING manhours into helping venezuelans (although charity work is not something jagex is inventing). 
---
whats ur big problem with bandaid fixes? its the difference between people starving to death or not. yeah, huuuuge surprise here i also want to fix the LARGE HUMANITARIAN ISSUE and also hope ppl dont starve to death. 2 thoughts at the same time.
---
ok, to reiterate: jagex doesnt need to do anything. they already are incompetent and accidentally helping goldfarmers because theyre idiots. i agree people working to feed themselves wont fix big issues with the government but also i think that feeding them is good (how are we disagreeing on this).
---
?????????? are you talking about something else or just like really mad about... jagex?
---
You saw that guy too?

Back in 2003 I would be selling a Mil GP on eBay for $35. I was one of the first people to sell RuneScape gold on eBay. This was when RS2 which is now RS3 first came out.
---
I'd also sell 1000 packs as well like 1000 coals for like $10 1000 iron ore, etc. I made like $15,000 in 2003 selling in game items and gold. I had an army of bots using Scar Scripts to make gold.

This made me release a decent amount of air out of my nostrils followed by a slight grin on my face

Jeeez that is incredibly lucky especially cos being MVP doesnt guarantee you get those drops.

You gotta be a fucking GOD at dodge ball, you dodge arguments and facts like CRAZY.
---
&gt;The change in premise assumes that for any 2 lives, any other person will see those lives as equal, which obviously isn't a true premise...
---
They're not intended to be carbon-copy examples. They're taking the principle of "Game Integrity &gt; Human Lives" to its logical extreme and demonstrating why it's flawed.
---
The original poster made it absolutely clear that they are EXPLICITLY weighing the lives of people to game integrity. And they EXPLICITLY value game integrity over lives.
---
The reason the lives in the hypothetical are changed Jmods is to give more impact to the lives you're dealing with. Because I would wager that the original poster would ONLY ever place game integrity over human lives, if they were lives he doesn't care about in the first place.
---
The hypothetical forces the original poster to apply the principle of "Game Integrity &gt; Human Lives" and see if it's still something they'll stand by. Which, obviously they won't. It shows that there's a flaw in the principle, or that they're making an exception somewhere.

Im maxed on rs3 and I can tell you that if you have felt lost in this game or unsure of what to do, you will probably feel more overwhelmed trying to learn rs3s combat and all the interfaces.

As far as I know, when you gather a resource you get an "attempt" every certain amount of ticks, starting when you click the resource. The idea behind tick manipulation is to cancel the skilling animation over and over in order to force more attempts in a shorter amount of time, since your attempts to gather resources starts immediately as you try to gather the material.

If you think about it, youre pking them in game AND irl
---
What you encountered was a Brassican mage whom attacks with a typeless attack, meaning its attacks cannot be prayed against. Only way to get rid of him anyway was to tank the damage and prefferably hit back fast.
---
Could have encountered 3 ancient mages all with different attack styles if you happened to get told to dig in a multi area.

As for the bank, I dont think youll have lots of trouble getting it back. Do konar slayer and herb runs inbetween tasks. Good luck.

There's going to be bots either/or, they would really have to beef up their anti botting system but that doesn't seem like it's happening anytime soon.

Thats the thing, there is no point anymore. The dictator gambled 80% of the government budget on oil being stable and expensive, then Iran and Iraq started selling oil on the same market within the same year. You remember how gas just fell like $1 or 2 a few years back? Thats when that happened and gas has been that cheap ever since. So that 80% of Venezuela's economy was only producing like 30%s worth. so the othe 20% started collapsing because there suddenly wasnt 50% of the money. And its only kept getting worse. And now Turkey and Russia are involved, buying their gold to keep what's left afloat. Meanwhile, we're doing a war dance in America because we clearly havent learned that war = bad.

I know some venezuelans that make a few thousand $ a month through this game, obviously not by killing dragons. Possibly making more than some people in the US lol
---
So what are the options? The way i see it is:
---
a) civilians start a civil war and die because vastly outgunned and lasts years upon years.
---
b) we wait till the dictator dies, in which their kids will probably inherit or someone with a similar ideal, aka North Korea.
---
Or c) war for 5 years, maybe 10, let the democratically elected party govern, and assist in the cleanup of their country.

Idk about you, but the first 2 would be significantly worse and long lasting consequences

I remember those days as well as when they introduced grave stones that protected your items when you died. There was an option to pray at someone's grave stone to reset the timer for when the items spawned on the ground. I remember being a f2p noob killing moss giants in the varrock sewers and feeling like a hero for praying at people's grave stones for them so they could make it back in time to get their stuff.
---
Do you send money back home in bitcoin?
---
Even if you reduced it to 14 spaces, or completely took out the extra stash BoBs - you'd still have the ones that help you farm faster and more efficiently. Yes they could bring new content and items, but remember exactly what happened to the game when they did that? EVERYTHING on the market right now will crash. Hard. Theres no way around that unless you make summoning pets not interact with combat, and then it would be kinda pointless unless they just helped you skill faster which in turn would be its own issue.

the fact in an attempt to make other content enjoyable by having more loot by adding sea turtles/manta rays to drop tables has made those items worth significantly less than they otherwise would be, and therefore trawler less rewarding

You are asking the wrong questions. Why were they starving their children? Why did the oio prices suddendly drop? Why did that happen? Then you dig deeper and you will find your answer. Just not in fake news american propaganda
---
The amount of people who will spend the time to level an alt, gear up an alt, and then be forced to play multiple characters at once is VERY slim right now compared to the amount who would use summoning. 
---
Also youre missing the point. Know what happens? Everyone using an alt already will now ALSO have summoning on top of the alt, meaning they'll get EVEN more farm/loot space. The market currently is "as is" with people using alts already. Which is not as many people as you think. Its not like 50% of players use an alt. Add in a skill like summoning and now that number for people using summoning will probably be everyone who plays a main account, and it just doubles for those already using alts and makes alts even easier to use. 
---
Moot argument bringing up alts since the current economy is already the way it is with people using alts. Adding summoning on top would only make it worse.

&gt; You seem like a reasonable person I've had a discussion within this thread. I'm enjoyed making this post and I have no ill will towards you
---
Same, I don't really care too much about the topic but I've nejoyed the debate.
---
&gt;If Jagex were to break their own standards here, it would be a good thing, and they should do it.
---
I don't agree, in my worldview, we're the customers for the game and their responsibility is to make sure the game is at its best for the players. And it is a black and white thing too where allowing the goldfarmers/botters to operate does negatively impact players in the game trying to engage in the same activities with limited resources, in addition to the effects on the game's economy (Zulrah being the prime example at ~2/3 the GP/hr of Vorkath now because of an increase in gold farmers when they've been stable at roughly equal up until this year). 
---
So at least in my eyes, if they help the Venezuelans by allowing them to continue their illicit activities in-game, it'd be something that's morally good for the Venezuelans who they don't have any responsibilities towards but they'd betray the game and the customers who they do have a responsibility towards. Some people brought up that the level of discomfort is hugely disproportionate between the two groups though but I honestly think that's irrelevant to the point of who Jagex has a responsibility to.
---
With regards to
---
&gt;Sounds harsh but I personally care more about the game's integrity.
---
I could see how that could bring up the `Game Integrity &gt; Human Lives` debate that other people brought up, but I'm also not in agreement of the stance that
---
&gt;But to outright say that you care more about the integrity of a fucking video game than people's actual lives is just sick.
---
I think I replied to another one of your comments before regarding that topic so I don't think I need to repeat my views on that.

My biggest barrier to entry when learning the game was crouch canceling. That‚Äôs what I think should be removed. L canceling isn‚Äôt even that bad. Honestly removing it absolutely kills some characters. It‚Äôs not even a barrier to entry because all it does is teaches you to habitually press the button every time your landing. Which is a good thing since it also helps you get better at teching off the ground. At least I noticed an improvement in my teching and on the plus side. It feels good to l cancel. It increases the speed at which you can play which is cool, but it‚Äôs also not too advanced. But there‚Äôs a lot of times I‚Äôd go for an attack in neutral. I‚Äôd get crouch canceled and punished and just be like ‚Äúwtf I got punished for hitting you?‚Äù And felt fucking awful every time I was punished for literally winning neutral. That‚Äôs the real barrier to entry and is fucking bull shit. It removes viable attacks from the game. And feels terrible. It should absolutely be removed and is first on my list.
---
I also don‚Äôt know what you mean by tilt jump, (tap jump?) and it‚Äôs honestly fine. It wasn‚Äôt able to be turned off until smash4, and I know there‚Äôs quite a few pros who still play with it on. It‚Äôs a useful tool sometimes.

Not to be that guy but this is one of the main purposes of bitcoin to act as a store of value in countries that really need it. Shit people that live in high inflation are better off keeping there money in osrs gold. The sad truth is all countries are going through inflation including fiat money which lost 98% of its value over the last 100 years. All these monetary systems were designed to benefit the few. They will all collapse long term followed by great depressions and recessions unless we make a change.

Why was web skipping at Sarachnis buffed. You had to time it perfectly for it to work. All web skipping did was speed up the kill, it didn't prevent any damage from the boss.

Can the frame stuttering while inside the demonic gorilla cave be addressed? It happens regardless of what client you use and it happens nowhere in the game except in that place. The lag has been there since release and I‚Äôm sure lots of other people are tired of it. Please

Do you guys think there are some high level Venezuelenz who farm like ToB legit. Wouldn't it be way more profitibal overall than green dragon bots?
---
&gt;I don't agree, in my worldview, we're the customers for the game and their responsibility is to make sure the game is at its best for the players.
---
This doesn't really address whether or not it's a *good* decision, nor does it refer to situations instances where breaking rules can be a good thing. If you think that rules should always be applied consistently regardless of circumstance, that's a fair position with reasonable arguments in support of it, though I would like clarity on that.
---
Similarly, if you think that your responsibility is always to your group/organization/customer you'll want to make that clear as well.
---
&gt;So at least in my eyes, if they help the Venezuelans by allowing them to continue their illicit activities in-game, it'd be something that's morally good for the Venezuelans who they don't have any responsibilities towards **but they'd betray the game and the customers who they do have a responsibility towards.**
---
I'm fine if they do this. I think there's a greater need for people who need to eat.
---
&gt;Some people brought up that the level of discomfort is hugely disproportionate between the two groups though but I honestly think that's irrelevant to the point of who Jagex has a responsibility to.
---
Correct, it doesn't change the responsibility of Jagex. But it also brings the situation closer to the threshold where the corporate responsibility no one longer outweighs the relative good of letting people put food on the table. I'd say it makes it exceeds this threshold.
---
&gt;The summary being that, the attitude isn't "sick" at all, it's quite normal and he's just being honest about it
---
I agree, kind of. *The base attitude* isn't that bad. I understand that not everyone has the capacity to actually do something about Venezuela's problems, and I understand that dedicating time to care about such an issue (and frankly, ANY global issue) is a mental tax and time sink that no can be seriously faulted for wanting to avoid. There's too much bad shit in the world to care about all of it.
---
But that is *not* the position that the post you're using is taking. They're not trying to safeguard themselves, they're actively choosing the quality of their entertainment over the well being of others.
---
&gt;To be fair its not jagex's or the player's responsibility to let the venezuelans keep their jobs as gold farmers and it does ruin the integrity of the game. **Sounds harsh but I personally care more about the game's integrity.**
---
There's a massive difference between valuing the quality of a video game, versus trying to safeguard your own finances, mental energy, or time. One of those things is NOT a necessary component of living. And that's why people are reasonably furious over the fact that someone would value that more.
---
And to be clear, some posts are even *worse* than that. Some posts are actively trying to dehumanize these people or delegitimize any discussion about the topic.
---
&gt;No one gives a fuck about nobody greasy farmers on the other side of the world. It's not our, nor Jagex's responsibility to let them keep their "job". They're actively ruining the integrity of the game. Sounds harsh but it's not our problem.
---
There is NOTHING in this kind of post that suggests they're trying to preserve their well being. You can tell by their choice in language that there isn't a basic recognition of the humanity of other people. They're trying to lower other people to a status that makes it easy for them to NOT care about other people. I don't think I have to explain why *that* can be a terrible thing.
---
I repeat. I understand that not everyone has the power, time, or energy to dedicate to caring about global issues. That's perfectly fair. But that is NOT what a lot of posts in these threads are doing.
---
It is possible tho. Its just not worth unless you plan to use the paper to falsify other currency.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Are you considering ways to reduce the prevelance of graceful sets being seen everywhere? Doesn't make sense to keep adding more cosmetic items to the game with practically no place to utilize them due to skilling outfits and the graceful set fulfilling practical roles.
---
Small ideas; higher agility requires less pieces to wear. Potential "upgrades" to graceful pieces to make them counter as 2. Maybe a similar approach to skilling outfits.

RNG is RNG and you are an outlier from the norm. Someone has to be and I'm sorry it is you. But you're the person that balances out that dude that gets a pet on 3 woodcutting and stuff. Normal distribution and all that.

I once got a b2b so I can tell you that its 50 50, I did the math.

I'm a disgusting slobby piece of human garbage IRL, but my bank and PC and phone screen etc are super tidy. So there's at least one data point that disagrees with your theory ;)

How many man-hours have been spent on content that didn't reach the game due to not passing a poll?
---
Is there anything that failed to pass the poll that stands out to the couch as the wrong choice by the community?

where and when did you first hear this, and what does it mean, in your own words?

Lmaoooo, rich in heart and friendship mateüñ§

i don‚Äòt get it
---
If you're a member you're putting money into the game one way or another either through creating a demand for bonds or paying for members directly. No one is voting who isn't putting money into the game.
---
Do you think corporations should let all shareholders have equal vote regardless of how much they have invested? People who invest more clearly have more of a vested interest in good content, the same is true in game.
---
The borrow gloves will come. I just dont have enough time do do quests at the moment. I play mainly on mobile during work
---
Not quite we used to have 1 minute from dying to get back to our gear else it would appear to everyone else to pickup and it would remain for another 1 minute onthe ground before despawning.
---
getting most places in the game within 1 minute can be quite tricky at times.
---
The scammers are perhaps the most damaging to the game. They make consistent profit with odds worse than the worst casino game, scam if the pot is big enough, and then RWT the winning back to the children they are scamming so the cycle repeats.
---
Just wait until a Polygon or Kotaku, or hell the New York Times picks up this story.
---
it was on task. :P
---
Can the monsters in the gauntlet scale to a players combat level?
---
Buyable upgrades would be whip&gt;fury&gt;torture&gt;prims&gt;tassets&gt;bandos chestplate and then you've spend ~80m.
---
Would recommend you to get fighter torso and barrows gloves as they're free, and especially the gloves are a huge upgrade. 
---
You could also consider getting a blow pipe and toxic trident if you don't have them yet, as they'll be you're best weapons for almost the entirity of the game. 
---
Maxed House is extremely nice as well. Cost me about 50m, but i fully filled my portal nexus.
---
fires can smoulder underground for months under the correct conditions and come back, even after being "put out".
---
As it seems useful, at the same time I feel like that will make things uncomfortable. With smaller cash stacks seeing how much gold you get/waste is helpful to manage resources.
---
When I sell all items I grinded through out the day and collect them at once from GE, the cashstack going into my inventory tells me about profits and expected results next times. 
---
If that could be turned off and on, then fine. Otherwise I would just skip question or vote no if you can't set a limit for this
---
WHAT THE FUCK
---
You can always get quest stat requirements on mobile if needed!
---
glory to fury is a cheap upgrade, warrior ring is super cheap, whip is a good upgrade, if you want to keep focusing on strength the abby dagger is sweet. I'd recommend saving the rest for a SGS.
---
You could also get 70 prayer to flick piety, it's nice vs difficult tasks and is great for bossing.
---
&gt; open a business and have it ruined by people using it to make money for themselves.

Theres actually ppl from Venezuela that killed themselves after they got their business ransacked. So that concept its not unfamiliar to me. But imagine the crisis you would have to go thru to NOT care to ransack a neighbor.

Its just something that you would have to live to understand, and i wish you wouldnt have to, sincerely.

But it is irellevant when talking about which one is more gp/hr.

Which one you enjoy more is relevant though.

Using the meme the wrong way round
---
I'm Venezuelan and I would never go to Venezuela if I can. it's so dangerous if they notice u are a foreigner they'll think money and that equals kidnapping.
---
When you report them, remember to report the accounts playing with them too. Maybe once Jagex gets their head out of their asses and actually does something about this problem, them potentially also going after the actual root of the issue (the people playing with the bots) isn't a bad thing.
---
How many people's lives do you think Runescape is worth?  Serious question I'm genuinely curious.  If you had the power to shut down the game completely and save a life, how many lives would you shut it down over? Or at least damage the company a decent amount.  1? 10? 100? What would be the cut off point in your opinion.  Keep in mind people's livelihood depends on the success of this game.  
---
To me personally, I value Runescape, or any other hobby I enjoy more than I do random strangers I'll never have any contact with or meet.
---
Could iPhone users get the option to 3D Touch for right click on mobile? It can be done almost as fast as a tap making things like farm runs with moving npcs much less annoying.

When runescape gold is more stable currency than pesos

It probably does. But not all people have the means to do that kind of work, osrs its a lot easier once you understand the mechanics.

All skilling minigames should have better loot, and all resource drops should be erased from monsters drop tables.
---
Why can't bosses and high lvl monsters drop something like spesific skill boosters that give double speed or double loot to a certain skill for a while?
---
That will create problems of its own, but atleast skilling would be relevant again.
---
Never thought about this!

So how much have you donated? I just take obnoxious people like you down a notch, you are trying to shame someone for not caring, yet you are doing fuck all yourself. And now you are whining like a little bitch for being called out, you are a pathetic person and I see right through your bullshit.
---
Rest in cabbage, OP
---
Good luck with that, younger people tend to love fortnite an snyone that has heard of runescape either loves it or hates it .. The rs community is by far one of the most toxic so people tend to stay clear
---
Yeah it will be fine just a big setback when everything was going well
---
In the future can you ask that people only ask 1 question per comment in the Q&amp;A threads? That way it is clear which ideas people want/are supportive of. One if the posts has 7 questions in it.

But he got RotG not a pet mate
---
Plus the retro graphics dont pull many people in
---
Might be stating the obvious but separate that which you actually need the +5 for. Remember that with a crystal saw and gold leaf tea shelves, you can get a +6 boost that can service a lot of bits and means you're doing less under the +8.
---
I also second the suggestion to get preserve. 
---
If you use Runelite, keep an eye on the timer and wait for stats to drop one before consuming the stew.
---
So a huge and powerful country have put an embargo on another country, because  they are claiming private companies property? 
---
How is that remotely fair, if the private companies is against this, they shouldn't build anything of great value in Venezuela and in the long run hopefully the government of Venezuela would realize that seizing their property isn't very smart. 
---
What positives does the embargo have, other than Uncle Sam getting to play police of the World? I genuinely have no idea what good would come from the embargo.
---
Pretty sure this doesn't work anymore, yeah.

---
&gt;1. Can Fist of Guthix work in OSRS? F2P Rewards might be very popular!
---
I'd rather see them come up with an original minigame as opposed to just porting FoG to oldschool.
---
&gt;4. Why is tutorial island still bottable? Little tweaks like other text options or changing copper/tin rock ids or making rats a different kind will do the trick. It doesn't even cost that much dev time tbh.
---
This wouldn't fix anything. It might break bots for a day but it wouldn't take long to update the ids in the script.
---
&gt;5. Players voting YES or NO 2x/3x/4x/5x/6x/7x by using alts, any tweaks to the voting system to prevent players from voting with more than say 2 accounts?
---
I think they should just require accounts to have been a member before the poll blog was released. That way people aren't bonding accounts just to vote on a specific poll.
---
It's so hard to forcefully recreate the passion that most of us players had back in the day. The organic love stems from self sustainment and accomplishment. Saving up for the first Mithril Scimitar! Let them find their course and offer tips and advice when they arise. 
---
Also, this game is rather niche and grind heavy. That only really appeals to a certain audience, otherwise the will lose interest faster than Matt K 3-ticks barb fishing.
---
Can we get a plan to address PVM death mechanics? 
---
Dying with certian untradables (graceful) is zero risk.
---
While others (lunar) get deleted and you have to spend money to retrieve. 
---
Can we get all untradables to break similar to PVP mechanics.
---
My suggestion would be: on death they break and drop low alch value in coins. Cost high alch value to fix.
---
i quit the game on wave 42 after 11 attempts.
---
Yeah you still get the automated message and everything. I‚Äôm one of the few who browse by new so I rarely see tags

You have a twisted sense of time. It takes a LOT more than 10 minutes to kill 28 rat behemoths.

I was talking about the scamming part. They do not scam you and in that sense they are legit.

Now that warding has failed, what will the team be working on during the development time assigned to warding? Are there numerous ideas floating around the team?

It was definitely a hostile tone brother
---
God damn I didn't think that level of degeneracy was possible, not to mention idiocy
---
No one is saying they are getting ddosed just that jagex servers arent reliable.  If I dont connect to a US server, I get about 2 hours max before having a disconnect.  Normally this wouldn't really be an issue but for example I like playing pest control and its frustrating to have the pest control world be German and knowing that I'm going to get DCd repeatedly.
---
I saw one at raids he was clue less

Wow man that‚Äôs shitty. I got two in 30 kills yesterday. Sorry for the rng. Hopefully it‚Äôll come back elsewhere.

Louder for the bots in the back

L-canceling imo is perfectly fine as is. Melee and other smash games are a lot about fighting in the air and moving in the air (at least compared to most other fighting games). Most characters have very important aerials that they need to hit such as marth when he uair combos. You remove the L-cancelling and marth becomes even more brain dead easy. Adding l-cancelling to smash attacks and the like wouldn‚Äôt make any sense because the speed at which you can use some tilts or smash attacks. Aerials are generally better and take longer to do than tilts or specials and not to mention that they speed at which you drop affects the timing of the l-cancel which makes it a skill to be able to hit all of your l-cancels. Last thing I‚Äôm gonna say is think of this match: marth vs Fox but you don‚Äôt have to l-cancel. Marth gets the free combos on fox and then starts uair chaining as he gets a 20% to death combo using his jump button and his up air button with very little room for error. I know the counter to these combos is to DI and it is possible to get out like that but one thing that makes DI so great is that you can mess up the timing of the enemy and cause them to miss an l-cancel which could give you enough time to turn the tables. Most of this doesn‚Äôt apply to the top 20 players because they hit almost all l-cancels but it is another great way to express your skill for the rest of us.
---
Lmao so true
---
I love it haha
---
Posting the rest, kinda not used to Reddit tbh, trying to post the other pictures now
---
I 100% agree, only 2 colours would be boring, I'm not crazy about the boots though.
---
Not sure if I'm misreading your comment, but the boost was never lowered to 12 seconds. This is just not true.
---
The time to log-out to refresh your boost was 12 seconds, but you can have a 60 second boost if you take a potion (e.g attack), wait your that stat to go down, and then drink the stew.
---
There is a global timer that's constantly cycling for boosts. If you boost just before the 60 second timer finishes, you'll lose the boost within seconds.
---
Preserve prayer helps extend the timer
---
How did I know exactly what music was playing before unmuting LOL

5 minutes to empty your piss jugs or 5 minutes multiplied by 50 trips to the bathroom. The only way you could get more efficient is to have your maid aka mother keep bringing down mtn dew bottles to the basement, effectively a never ending supply of piss jugs. In that case you can empty them when you‚Äôre 200m all.
---
bro... you literally have to read the top left corner of the screen to see which attack style/egg/poisoned food to give. it shouldn't take anyone more than a couple of rounds to figure the game out.

I had to grind from 71 mage to 78. Bought ahrims and trident of the seas and I just went at it until I killed her. It was still tough for me but each time I felt more determined to kill her. 
---
It took me about 15 times if not a little more and idk how much I spent on supplies that I wasted but I watched her every move and judge when I should use a brew or restore and only healed fully when she was on her healing stage and I overhealed when I destroyed her pillars. 
---
The thing that was most beneficial for me was keeping my mage as close to my close to my lvl as possible if I had to heal I‚Äôd wait until it take one sip of a restore to get my mage back to what is supposed to be.  
---
But keep going at it and gl and a obligatory Nice! when you get it a lot of higher lvls don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a challenge or nothing to be proud of to beat. But I think it‚Äôs one hell of an accomplishment
---
I hope not. Game integrity should be upheld in a non biased way that is fair for everyone across the platform. Just because a player's country is doing poorly economically doesn't mean they should be exempt from the rules. Punishments for breaking the game rules needs to be blind to the "why" they broke them.
---
Perfectly balanced upvotes, as all should be
---
just mind your business
---
You leave those bots alone! They aint hurting anyone and providing entertainment, a way of gambling and fun, and liven up the Grand Exchange. If they weren't there Jagex would have to come up with some way for players to gamble their GP other than the Sand Casino. If anything we need more than 1 per world as they can get quite busy with multiple players waiting to play.
---
Same I wish I knew the actual context behind his face

It only lasts for first 12 seconds of the boost

**What are your thoughts on making Crystal a Melee / Ranged Hybrid armour?**
---
By shifting the bonuses from 10% Damage and 30 % accuracy to 20% in each, and then offering those bonuses to the Halberd alongside the Bow, it could have its own niche. At the moment, it's comparable to Black d'hide, which is considerably cheaper, with much lower requirements. Though more inconsequential, finesse in multiple combat styles really matches the theme of Elven agility.

It might be a copy pasta.

Also do varrock diaries.  At medium you get 30 battlestaves a day.  You pay 210k for these and they sell for around 250k.  So it's 40k a day or 280k a week/560k per two weeks towards a bond, for free.
---
Doing the easy diaries is half the battlestaves and doing hard is double, though hard has some higher quest and skill requirements.
---
Yes.  But, what I really want is the ability to modify GE offers rather than having to abort them and recreate them at a different price.
---
Youre right, but personally I think death mechanics as he is suggesting would be a horrific change and likely drive many players away from the game, and thats ignoring the massive issue around losing stuff to a disconnect.
---
What the heck? I sold my tool seed last weekend for 19m! Oops...

why not just an overpriced item that accesses your bank from wherever you are.

A little concerning how often this suggestion pops up.

The high priced ones are obvious keeps, apart from that you can keep hop seeds for birdhouse runs, other herb seeds for herblore training (maybe just harralander+?), fruit tree and normal tree for xp, watermelon and snapegrass for supercompost/herblore respectively
---
putting them in seed vault frees up bank space tho so u can just keep all of em and not worry about it

but why do you have all these

You gonna say anything bro?

Okay then, if its a choice thing:

Anyone against that choice can choose to drop the cash any time they like.

Saying no to this will be FORCING restrictive cash mechanics one me.
---
&gt;You might own a gun, but I promise it won't save you, an intelligent person will hit you by surprise and you won't stand a chance.
---
So all those stories where a gun saved someone are just lies? Do you think no one ever used a gun successfully for self defense?

I bet it'll come in the next year or so. Jagex doesn't seem against it, it's just low on the priority list

Tr ygoing to runelite.net and see if that works, if that works you can at least play until you figure it out. Likely a firewall or blacklisted website issue

Most developed nations incentivize forced equality for various reason; sometimes good, sometimes bad, but almost always with some kind of financial pressure or legal coercion. Public opinion probably doesn't matter much.

I couldn't care less what they are trying to accomplish, it's about the fact that they're engaging in politics at all. Affiliating your company with a certain political leaning only helps you lose customers. I don't feel right about giving money to a company knowing they'll use it to promote a political leaning I don't affiliate with. Instead of supporting it or disavowing it, why can't they just shut up about it? There is no reason to be doing this other than trying to appeal to a certain crowd and therefore repelling other crowds, all in all losing customers. If that's the case it seems that Jagex prioritises Politics instead of Playercount and satisfaction.

Take all seeds you need to deposit. Fill bank with fillers. Deposit all. All remaining seeds go in the vault.

Who‚Äôs? Mine? Requirement? My kc is 530 or so at CoX, requirement is 0 and they have gear/room guides and mentors.

makes sense, its not a good idea for companies to officially suggest their in-game currency has real world value.

Will any of the warding magic armours get polled or rolled into the game as other content, I still think we need more mage armour.
---
That's freshhhhh
---
Addy scim? That's a joke compared to the elite step, at least when you need +5 boost for both mining and smithing. It took me 8 +5 mining boosts just to mine the 2 rune ores in time. Probably took me over 2 hours just for that one step.
---
Facts.

You don't know what you're talking about, I make 3 mil an hour without woox walking. You're doing it wrong

Getting to Ardy as a new player is a ballache. You either have to use the wildy lever, fishing trawler tele, walk from lumbridge -&gt; sarim -&gt; karamja -&gt; brimhaven -&gt; ardougne, or falador -&gt; catherby -&gt; seers -&gt; ardougne  
---
Let's be honest not many new players are gonna know about the fishing trawler tele or edgeville lever.
---
That‚Äôs a sick collection

Straw man? Lol

ignore uniques/onyx and its a pretty big nerf though

It used to be Nieve/Steve for cannon tasks before barrage became meta with Catacombs.

Of course I also had the swap between dragon bolts ruby enchanted and diamond enchanted.  You got this man!

I just hit 75 range and got a blowpipe, when I switched to using it my GP/hour went way down(200k/h-&gt;50k/h) Even though my xp/hour doubled(40k/h-&gt;.90k/h). I don't know if I should stay here and keep using my rcb or go find something better. I'm almost to the money makers in Slayer.

Client  updates, such as GPU support have been teased long time ago, and we  were told that it would get into works after mobile release.
---
Now that mobile has been out for almost a year, will we be going to see some really necessary client updates soon?
---
Things  that client could really need are in my opinion: Skyboxes, Longer  render distances, GPU support, Better and more stable FPS, CPU Multicore  support.
---
Is it on your key ring?
---
Does mining cape give you a chance at more resources while mining too? I notice the wiki says it has a similar effect to V4 armor.
---
Medieval era indeed is a huge time frame, and according to sources, Middle Ages is set to 500s all the way to Renaissance period of 1500s, other source claims it to be exactly to 476-1492 and other 500s to 13th, 14th or 15th century, depending the region.
---
Knights in armour existed post-true Middle Ages all the way to late 1500s/early 1600s where their downfall began due first firearms (muskets) becoming even more common and powerful which were effective even against fully armoured knight, thus slowly ending the age of knighthood. I personally feel Medieval Era lasting to mid 1500s, but it's matter of taste or how precise you want to be with history and viral terms.
---
Ps. I think we both could learn from each other about Medieval era. ;)

Tf is that lmao

You really don‚Äôt. Try testing your own results and report back instead of regurgitating what you read on some random forum post or a youtube video. Unoess you have fremmenik elite, western hard, dhcb, and can woox walk, you aren‚Äôt getting 3m/hr. Those are some fucking high requirements to make money where Zulrah you just need a blowpipe and a trident to get 2 min kills, and a brain to last 2-3 kills per trip. Way better and easier money.
---
Can we get a quick travel option on the boat to Zulrah after travelling there once?
---
I think that was his issue last month, he had to come to terms with the fact that he wasn‚Äôt the main attraction.

id like the skill itself obtaining charms to lvl and such just not the familiars benefits if they made a different use to this skill it would have my full support
---
Idk, I just felt bad.
---
LUMBRIDGE. IS. A. DUCHY.
---
nobody would consider it cheating. it would only be cheating if you used an autoclicker so you werent actually casting the spell yourself.
---
I like it.
---
I have a alcohol collection in my bank :)
---
The biggest part of it is that it actually has the Karamja Rum bottle.
---
Yes you should, you'd be basically single handedly paying for the company's bills and workers.
---
The fact is for any alt owner to have any voice they'd have to spend a shit ton of money, and jagex is a company btw, not a charity. Money = more power.
---
Ok, thanks for letting me know :)
---
I have all of those things but don't woox walk and make 3 mil an hour. I've done the calculations, have you even done either boss?
---
He got similar (albeit slightly more) mvp‚Äôs post patch. If the profit for having mvp is significantly lower now than it was before the patch, it means that regular loot must have higher profit to make up the difference.
---

I dont use auto clickers. I find them to be lazy tbh
---
I watch and played both.
---
Your comments are trash because you give zero effort.
---
Yeah I think so. He's getting pretty upset about a RuneScape boss.
---
Account security has always been an issue with this game.
---
Do you think WoW players are just so much more mature that even though they're experiencing the same things, they don't complain about it? Or do you think that they're so much smarter than RuneScape players that despite dealing with the same level of account security, they remain unhacked?
---
The real reason is 3 fold. 
---
First, it's a lot harder to hack someone in WoW (or any blizzard game) than in RuneScape. Their fail-safes and lack of instant authenticator removal makes it a little more difficult to gain full access to someones account.
---
Second, the customer service levels are very different (astronomically different. Blizzard has arguably some of the best customer service in the industry, and Jagex has arguably the worst.
---
Third, whether it's engine or game design or whatever, there's no ends that justify means for blizzard hackers. Expensive items are often soulbound, and on top of that their customer service is good about tracking what went where, so there's no "yea we can see clear as day that your account gave this random account your entire net worth in a single trade for no reason and we can revert it if we want to, but because RWTing exists, you can go fuck yourself you're never getting any of it back" situations.
---
Sure, ultimately, almost every time someone gets hacked it's their fault, but that doesn't excuse Jagex from doing the bare minimum.
---
They do, it‚Äôs called ironman mode lmao. And yeah mine was chucking to get to scythe but now I‚Äôm down to like 400m bank, guess all ima do now is tob till I get it back then stake again till I win lol.
---
Wow. Your pet luck is unreal. Congrats!
---
The game as a whole regardless of the role has a curve for noobies. It‚Äôs not something you immediately get the hang of, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt ever have to go yell at someone to call every once in a while... it doesn‚Äôt have a crazy curve like Vork but it does have a curve. You can‚Äôt tell me you had straight up zero struggle the first 10 waves you did as a level 1 healer with most likely a bunch of sub 80 cb noobies healing them by the 10hp lol
---
Eh, we've all done something mega dumb at some point or another as an adult
---
good, they are definitely against the rules (thus cheating) - casting a spell for xp is not cheating in anyway... its just how you train magic. have fun teleing
---
Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing. People like him just suck.
---
&gt; If that was still around, ~~9~~100% of us would be banned

We've all had this happen to us at some point or another (if you've been playing since the OG days). We didn't "rage quit forever".
---
Are you me?

I did exactly the same yesterday and hate questing more than I hate runecrafting

Well done my dude.

Man, I tried so hard to figure it out aboyt 15 years ago. I finally have up.

Bringing BIS gear to every situation is better than actually having to plan what you are taking?
---
What clan is this?
---
can you explain what fundamentally makes ahk vs keyboard software to accomplish the same thing different?
---
I‚Äôd say try both and then decide. Rs3 is fast and essy to begin, so you get the basic idea pretty fast. It‚Äôs also quite nice looking, graphically I mean.
---
Wish I had the guts to even attempt it lol I‚Äôm still too much of a noob.

I botched a crystal key merch for SOTE. I ended up with 3500 crystal keys that wont sell. I decided to use my keys at the new crystal chest. How many crystal shards am I expected to get per hour with the different methods offered in Prifddinas?

I'd rather bots than hackers though, although neither is preferable.

Everything in your statement is bad xp
---
Dude Gratz this tab is great looking, I love it when people gather data like this. Now, I'm NOT shitting on you at all and this is just my personal opinion; do you think there's a way to revive skilling at all? Why skill when you can just slay? Again, not hating om anyone I'm only thankful you made this, looking at the resource drops and the rune drops it just made me wonder
---
I‚Äôve got some good dailies down including staffs. Almost have the reqs for hard, but too scared to do DT lol.
---
Except it's not "at once". It's a computer. It only processes one thing at a time. In reality, one skill gains exp before another other skill. It follows the order that you'd see the exp drops. If there was a system in place to actually *properly* remember first 99, then it'd be the one that gained exp first. Back in rs2, I got 99 magic and smithing at the same time with a superheat, and it registered magic first.
---
Of course none of this matters anyway, since it's not like you can make a quick trip to a cape vendor for an untrimmed cape and somehow magically pick up where you left off with the notifications.
---
&gt;This dude isn't fucking ignorant of the implications of his lifestyle.
---
I didn't reply to that guy, I was calling u/pm_dolphin_pics ignorant, and I'm not talking about exploited labor, per se, I'm talking about literal wars over "conflict minerals" in your smartphone, where people shoot guns at each other, but this guy doesn't know about that, or surely he'd think it isn't worth the lives of those poor Congolese, and give something up like he's urging this man to do, hence my presumption that the only difference between the two is that one is ignorant of the atrocities they support.
---
&gt;He's saying it's a GOOD thing that people starve for his "game integrity".
---
no, he didn't say anything like that, he said he didn't care about the far away, out of sight, people being terrorized by their own government, who have nothing to do with him outside of a game he enjoys, that they allegedly destroyed. he expressed detachment, not joy in the comments above me, you are right that his priority is in the games integrity, which is logical, as he has more attachment to the game, than those far off people.
---
&gt;Get real. You're not doing to tell people not to buy ANYTHING ever just because almost EVERYTHING we buy is off of cheap exploited labor.
---
again, my point had little to do with the underpaid, and more to do with literal gunfire exchanges to get hands on elements and minerals used in certain tech.
---
&gt;Do you seriously need to be told why it's bad that a person straight-up prefers game integrity over people's lives?
---
I didn't even agree with him, I pointed out hypocrisy and ignorance, in a person who was wagging his finger righteously, we all support atrocities, and we shouldn't be so quick to cast someone as horrible, there are A LOT of people in this world to have empathy for, and many issues to pasionately follow, no one should be expected to be at the moral forefront on every issue, it's unrealistic, and we all have to make compromises, hence I'm typing to you on a smartphone right now, that regrettably someone may have been shot for, or a diamond that may be unethically sourced, or you may be out of gas right in front of a BP after the gulf oil spill, or your whole country's economy may be backed by waging war on developing nations, it's not really our place to judge
---
as for him being an asshole, he might be, but how do you know?
---
I mean if you farming zulrah or vorkath and already have 99 range, mage and hp what exp are you gaining towards? I doubt a lot of peoples goals are 200m all
---
Wdym?
---
Yeah I'd love to pvp but the hunter/prey pvp is just not fun imo
---
Either you're killing people who don't want yo fight back or you're getting clanned out. 
---
Just nothing about that is fun
---
the only fun pking I find anymore is anti-pking while doing wildy slayer
---
I have had pkers call me all types of names while killing me without saying anything so no it is not just them talking back. The pking community has some very toxic players and you will never convince people otherwise because they just exist. I have never been called the n word more than in the wildy on osrs.
---
i didnt get the chance to do vorkath :)

can i ask why you changed your ancestral hat from 2nd last on the right, to last on the right. Are you ok?

the dragonbones are from Cerberus if you mean that, but i didnt do vorkath in this exp count cause i didnt get any blue dragon tasks :)

My sister‚Äôs cat hates me and looks just like this one. Last night was visiting and the cat sat in a chair staring at my just like that
---
I did vote yes? Now what?
---
when people said virgin as an insult they specifically meant incels, before incels was a term/known term
---
when someone called you a virgin they did mean you were just so repulsive or awkward that you couldn't find a sexual partner, not that you were choosing not to have sex.
---
What were you doing wrong lol
---
Apparently idiots that need to be reminded daily to not click on the obvious phishing link
---
i actually really enjoy skilling, im getting my combat stats up to 99 all so im doing slayer for that. but i think people dont enjoy the grind that skilling demands of you, so many hours that you have to put into it, im base 90 atm in all stats tho and i cant wait to max, im gonna keep adding to this tab untill i get 99 defence, 95 atm so ill make another post soon :). thanks for the nice comment
---
&gt;intrusively political 
---
Please explain how allowing a group of female employees to host an AMA on reddit is "intrusively political". Its not and I suspect you just dislike strongly the message they are trying to get across for some strange reason. (seriously, it seems no one can explain whats wrong with the message) 
---
In any case, im not being hypocritical in the slightest, if OP had the balls to be honest and attack Jagex's stance on equality outright instead of skirting around the issue my reply would be different. If Jagex supported political views I strongly opposed, I would attack them for those views explicitly, not demand they suddenly stop engaging in political activity altogether.
---
damn i really want that kbd pet man, i barely got any black dragon tasks :(
---
I mean then you should seek actual help. This isn‚Äôt a site that caters to people.
---
thanks man :)
---
If you're maxed with trimmed quest cape you can probably afford an ely.
---
i do skilling for lvl's (max cape) and not for profit even though doing some skills in a different way than max efficiency is alot of profit. zalcano/mlm is good money when 99, blood runes is like 300k/h,chins catching etc...
---
Enlighten me, which country are you from so I can understand the levels of retardation you are on. If it's Canada, it makes sense. All the pot yall are smoking is really killing your brain. If its south america, I'm sorry you have dengue,  if its AU, I'm sorry you live in such a twisted political mess , if its NZ...been to your country for a rugby tour, not a fan of it the trash everywhere.
---
Plz enlighten me mr.6000000IQ show me the true power of Google search
---
Not sure if this was mentionned in the comments, IMO the easiest way to get healers aggro'd would be red/black chins, also I bring 3 range pots, 8 brews, rest super restores. I dont see the point in the purple sweets. Gear setup would be slayer helm(i)/veracs helm, dhide blessed top, veracs skirt, blessed boots, barrows gloves, anguish, archer ring (i), blessing (ammo slot) and blowpipe. I always have brews and restores left over. 87 range, 85 def.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
yes this is also my slayer helm tab, the heads i gathered for my ava's and pet grind :)
---
knees weak, arms are heavy
---
I believe you can still see stars on the moon when it is nightime.  So your picture checks out!
---
That meme is old school. Even forgot it ever existed.
---
That's probably a good chunk of change even for someone who's maxed unless they have like 1k raids kc
---
Oh fuck im jealous. That's an amazing view
---
Superheat Item and High Level Alchemy are good options. Especially High Alch as you can do it while you do other stuff. Tele-alching is decent XP as far as I know, it can get a bit pricey though. Some alch items actually make a decent profit, so you might offset the cost of nature and law runes.
---
For the most part, or mobs like Demonic Gorillas with a lot of hp that drop good stuff. 
---
On very rare occasions when I really wanna get something done quickly that I can't cannon I'll break it out, but by far the main things I use it for are Vorkath and Gorillas
---
Feel free to splash. It's a good use of afk time and I got like 50 magic in a few days using splashing only on my pure. After around 40/50 the xp rates become kinda crappy but by then you will have high alch soon.
---
HD mode isnt a simple toggle. 
---
I means the devs have to literally create every single model twice. Thats simply not going to happen.
---
imagine getting ice rushed by a guy in the low 30's combat bracket when you're trying to obby maul
---
Wait why were you even in the underground pass if you have a teleport crystal? Don‚Äôt tell me you go back in SOTE....

I was typically getting 1 kill trips until like 50 KC. As you get more comfortable with the mechanics you start swapping gear sooner, you make fewer mistakes, and you generally get in more DPS. I noticed that once I was able to consistently get sub-2 minute kills, I was also able to consistently get 2-3 kill trips. Zulrah is one of those bosses that feels really rewarding to learn, so just keep practicing.
---
Yeah I like your idea but I doubt it'll pass a poll.
---
That actually looks sick. Might steal this once i get my quest cape
---
Could you make it so that each role in barbarian assault has a fixed player position. For example player 2 chooses the defender role so he gets position 5 instead of 2, this would place him closer to the dispenser.
---
Currently arranging the team for the best starting positions is a bit of a hassle.

To be fair, being told that it's the moon, and there being grass there, it's really not much of a mistake. The only thing really confirming it to be underground on the moon is an offhand line about 'not getting sunlight down here'. I always imagined it being on the surface, but in some perpetual blue tinted twilight that let mushrooms grow freely.

Jagex will lock your account if it logs in from a very different IP, so if you use a VPN for other stuff and forget to turn it off before playing you can end up with your account locked.
---
So that's how it works..
---
Yeah they recently made a change for it in lumbridge. It specifically doesn't work there. I find the chickens south of Falador work well

Did you already get 1k kills how long did that take??

Just fyi to all, I unlocked inferno, and have yet to bother to go get another fire cape because I was trying to get 92 farming, got 91, stopped for now, did fruit trees and normal trees (magic n dragonfruits), expensive af, lol.
---
Wait...I said druidic ritual but I meant rune mysteries.  Can you runecraft without doing it. Has he done it?
---
I did it back when the beta worlds were up, a few tries just to see what was up.  I made the same mistake, died like 4 or 5 times, with gear better than what I owned.  Realized the mistake then did it first try on my actual account.  Overall the fight is amazing, Jagex did a really good job, I can't wait to try song of the elves, I just have had too much IRL stuff to sit down and knock out ME1, ME2, and SotE.

Shame it‚Äôs not a toggle, goes off after a few seconds

you should flip those fans, you are sucking in air from the top and back and exhausting through the radiator on the front, other way around would be better airflow wise, otherwise nice build!

Depends on what you do, it's a really diverse skill so there's lots of methods. Like 500 hrs if you do Abyss (FYI you shouldn't ever do Abyss), 350-400 hrs or so at Zeah but it's AFK, maybe like 300 hrs if you do ZMI, 200 hrs doing Lavas, or 100 hrs or less if you use Runners.

I have tried that article without any success

I'll randomly have games that I only get hit like 3 times, and then others where I am hit 20+. The worst was 9 hits while burning an inventory of maybe 18 logs

Oh cool, let's completely ignore all the mechanics associated with both and talk out my ass about how someone else is talking out of their ass
---
Thanks for your detailed explanation for a weird flex but ok. 
---
Go do a simple Google search on why you're wrong and how your personal drop table has no bearing on others because it's all determined by guess what, a drop table. The data is already there and vorkath provides better profit without drops which I've outlined which you obviously did not read.
---
I suppose reading isn't your strong suit considering you don't even read what you type.
---
What went wrong? Maybe we can work through it.
---
I just download the .jar from runelite's site then do

That's what I did. I'm 126 cb and just now got my first 150 kills at Zulrah. I really like it now but Vorkath is infinitely easier and better money too
---
This. Also if you choose to store them, at some point you will have to make the call to open them. Unless you have tons of free bank space, just open away.
---
It's still possible the recovery tool was used to change your e-mail (AKA "I can't access my e-mail address"). This would indicate you inadvertently exposed private information that was used to recover the account. Whatever you do (such as try logging in on your phone or something) do not use the links in the e-mail.

No, I don't think it's worth bailing on trips and collecting all the bones. Over the course of 8 months I've lost around 65m not picking them all up which is not that much really.
---
Birdhouse and seaweed runs are pretty chill on mobile.  Safer slayer tasks are pretty good (ones where you don't have to worry about dropping prayer or something).  If you're looking for less afk activities, I enjoy doing Herbiboar and Agility on mobile.
---
I did fishing on mobile and i would fish a full inventory and then spam click around for 3 seconds, which typically only succeeded in dumping 3/4 of the inventory
---
But thats okay, id just fish to full again and repeat
---
It felt like drop fishing on the computer but with only 20 inventory slots

Yeah gonna be a no from me too dog... Simon?

Bought my gf for 10k. Thanks capitalism!

At nechs?
---
Big difference, some people might learn the wrong thing.
---
Faster kills = less damage. Rig / augury / higher combats will also help you tank more hits. As you get more experienced you'll get better at knowing when to eat for range hits, but there's not much you can do to prevent the damage (just gotta pray he doesnt attack with range too much lol). One thing that helps is bringing rune pouch with veng and venging when you see the range hit coming. I find that helps me stay out of situations where zulrah is combo-ing me for a shit load of damage while I can't do anything but eat.
---
Cause they're probably bad at merching like me. People fear what they cannot understand
---
Superheat item is slightly more XP/hr (~95k vs ~80k) with gold bars, but not profitable unless you do steel, which is then less XP/hr because you can only do 1/3 as many per inv. It's also more click intensive.
---
Curse is far slower - ~35k XP/hr vs ~80k for Tele to Camelot - but more afk and cheaper (1 gp/XP vs 2.8gp/XP).
---
Fire strike at blue dragons is almost certainly significantly slower too, but yes it is profitable, obviously.
---
So yeah, I don't really know what you're talking about but 80k XP/hr at 2.8gp/XP at level 45 is a decent method in my book. Personally I think Cammy Tele is the best balance of click intensity (clicking the same spot over and over), cost (2.8 gp/XP) and speed (80k XP/hr) until you can high alch.
---
its just not possible for either acc otherwise, and even with scouts this grind will still takes weeks or months
---
Which I also said is wrong. Just because you didnt know her before that tape doesnt change facts.

msb (i) with rune arrows is actually quite cheap and the dps is nice as long as monsters don't have too high def. that's what i did when I was range slaying at about ur level

What's worse is that you think your game integrity matters more than people living too.

This is the real suggestion

Ok thanks, think i will.

You have a sick mind.
---
Where can i set my death respawn to priff?
---
Actually the oficiall osrs wiii has money making guides for both vorkath is 1.3 more an hour... Who's talking out of their ass again? Vorkath is objectively better and if you've done 400 kills like you said you have, you would either know that, or are just super biased toward zulrah.
---
Why is everyone getting so butthurt? I'm just saying some of the cham is lost for me personally.

Weird I thought they said this was being fixed last Thursday. Might be moved to this Thursday but they‚Äôre definitely aware of it!
---
are you ok
---
But why would I wanna do that? Lol
---
The kitchen is pretty useless except for training Construction and making Cup of tea for the +3 Construction boost.
---
Some players (like myself) sometimes get a stupidly long streak of bad luck. So for the amount and time and effort to get more orange spice for a +5 boost, it makes more sense (sanity-wise) just to get 2 more levels. Then you could use the +6 total boost to build the Ornate pool, instead of relying on RNG to get +8 total boost (and rushing to build everything you want to use).
---
Once you get the Ornate pool it becomes very easy to reset your stats if the Spicy stews lower your stats.
---
It doesn't matter, but that's not the point. The strength of the item should set the bar at 90. 
---
Adding a new ranged item to the game? How does it compare to current tiers etc.
---
How are you stupid enough to think I‚Äôm seriousüòÇ
---
I'm curious as to how jagex can identify an AHK that has multiple functions? Does it just show up as one input or whatever?
---
I mean technically they are obtainable. I don‚Äôt see the issue with paying for it. If it‚Äôs an Ironman thing then you‚Äôre going to be disappointed later on because Ironman mode really isn‚Äôt a solo game mode. It never has been. Especially with the introduction of Raids. There‚Äôs alt slayer, alt scouting for raids, buying raid scouts, paying for rev protection, using another iron alt to spec Corp down in a separate world. The list goes on and on.

How did the reaction to new SOTE models change how you will approach updates (specifically graphical) in the future?
---
A played named Oziris made a guide on the theoretical most efficient way to max an iron man, his recommendation was to open Wintertodt crates until 200k cash stack.
---
Are they ever gonna fix the bug where your character randomly stops fishing? It's happening every 20 seconds to me and it's been reported many times the past few years. I only get like 15k exp/hr at monks now. Never was an issue back in the day.
---
Its the same as regular antifire, but more expensive and shorter duration
---
We all do that when we transition from a pure to a zerk!
---
if they dumped 100k  logs,   and I bought 24k  of them for 20gp each that would instantly eat almost 25% of their profit. Also I  have had higher offers on alts that  didn't buy during the same time. Not only that,  but the max number of logs you can buy per 4 hours is 12k,  meaning that had to happen twice in 1 night for me to get a full order.
---
 1 million yews sold in 1 day,  and I bought 2.4% of them  for 20gp each. 
---
   I am not saying that offers are soley chosen by age,  but I would bet my cash stack that the age of an offer has a lot to do with being able to snipe items for cheap.
---
Its serene, what do you expect.
---
Mep2 was far worse. Sote is actually really exciting outside of the puzzles.

Yeah, I don‚Äôt mind questing at all. In fact, I usually enjoy doing them. It‚Äôs just that these days I hardly ever have time, so when I see that SOTE is a three hour quest, it kind of makes it easier to put off lol but I‚Äôll knock it out soon enough.

I‚Äôve gotten 2300 in WoW PvP and competed for server firsts in raids. I‚Äôve gotten Global Elite in csgo and I‚Äôm pretty great at any FPS really. But when it comes to Runescape I‚Äôm trash. I‚Äôll never get an Inferno Cape. I might never do raids. I probably could I‚Äôm like 120 cmb with an 200M bank but RuneScape isn‚Äôt a serious game for me. None of my friends play it and my friends list is empty on purpose. I play to game by myself and complete a constantly shifting rotation of short term goals.
---
DMM stands for Deadman Mode which is a open-PvP gamemode played on separate servers with separate account progressions. But there's only 1 world live right now (w345), and the client will never choose that world by default though.
---
If your stats are on RS3, it means that you've never played OSRS. You played RS2 which was the main game from 2004 to 2013 and eventually evolved into RS3. OSRS is a separate game created from a 2007 backup.

I did see that and signed it aswell. It f*cked me up for a while. Still think they should finish it

A legit bow sword with stats would be a good way to counter nh brids, they wouldn't know to prot melee or range

Then how is it that I've been using the OSRS client to log in this entire time? Like I literally just downloaded the RS3 client moments ago for shits just to see what would happen
---
&gt;no, he didn't say anything like that, he said he didn't care about the far away, out of sight, people being terrorized by their own government, who have nothing to do with him outside of a game he enjoys, that they allegedly destroyed. he expressed detachment...
---
That's not true. He doesn't express anything like detachment. He clearly says he *prefers* game integrity.
---
&gt;To be fair its not jagex's or the player's responsibility to let the venezuelans keep their jobs as gold farmers and it does ruin the integrity of the game. Sounds harsh but **I personally care more about the game's integrity.**
---
There's a massive difference between saying. "It's not Jagex's responsibility." and "I care more about game integrity. The first is detachment, the second is valuing game integrity more than people putting food on the table. That's a concerning position. It suggests that if he were given a button that bans a gold farmer and takes away a family's income he'd push the shit out that button. Because he cares more about the game's integrity.
---
You can't fault someone for wanting to absolve themselves of responsibility or detach themselves from global issues. There's only so much mental energy, time and resources that people can dedicate to things. But to *explicitly* weigh the two and say you prefer game integrity is gross.
---
&gt;we all support atrocities, and we shouldn't be so quick to cast someone as horrible, there are *a lot* of people in this world to have empathy for, and many issues to pasionately follow, no one should be expected to be at the moral forefront on every issue, it's unrealistic, and we all have to make compromises
---
Looks like we agree. But there's a difference between showing basic empathy and becoming an advocate for these issues. People are only asking for you to show basic empathy.
---
&gt;...the only difference between the two is that one is ignorant of the atrocities they support.
---
This is the biggest thing I want to address.
---
&gt;Just because you're ignorant of the terrible implications of your lifestyle doesn't make you any better than a man who does and bears that weight
---
This isn't the right comparison to make. We're not comparing people who are ignorant, and people who are informed about their actions. It's highly unlikely the original poster is unaware of the significance of blood-products.
---
We're comparing people who are both informed about it, but one cares and the other doesn't. Remember, engaging in this exploitation and liking it is completely different than engaging it in and wanting the system to change.
---
What separates these people is that one who can care about the issue will be likely to support policy that addresses these issues. And that's crucial. Because even if that dude is aware that people died to make his iPhone. So what? Does he throw it away? Those people are still dead. Does he never buy an iPhone again? That doesn't stop the killings.
---
We get actual change, by getting people to care, and implementing policy.
---
A 1/100 drop rate for an unsired would thereotically mean you would get 33 unsired's, 33 chances (Pet included). Whereas you only got 3 theoretical chances at abby demons.

Anyone ever find themselves in a tinfoil hat, thinking that jagex is actually the owners of these bots and is just trying to remove gp from the game?

Why the downvotes? I'm not saying the game is easy. I'm just saying you learn the mechanics and it gets easy. You beat Jad once the nerves go away and you crush him the next time. Raids require a little more game knowledge
---
I fully agree with that logic, but Jagex doesn‚Äôt seem to (as you said Sarachnis, but also Todt, Chaos Ele from Fanatic, and Mole come to mind).

Can I at least get half?

I mean, you could just scroll past?
---
Ah maybe this is the issue, tempted to test it now.
---
Agh!! Another one of my money makers ruined!
---
Cannon accuracy is the accuracy of the style you are equipped with/selected in the attack style screen. If you cannon with very low accuracy, you won't deal damage but you can draw aggro. So then your ironman can get the kill without being aggrod. They fixed it and perhaps banned a couple people
---
Probably best to send this to a mod to get the guy and all his alts removed from the game
---
nothing.
---
That math is really complicated so don't sweat it. With multiple people rolling you have to account for any number of people getting the pet in a single kill. You go down a rabbit hole real quick.
---
nechs and dusties are catacombs only, there are a few other ones that can be done but they are more expensive/more effort to do.

‚ÄúFamous for being famous‚Äù i.e. haven‚Äôt done anything significant to be in the spotlight but they‚Äôre are. Another great example is Kim Kardashian.

Here's a related tip: in order to use less battery go to the settings and you will find an FPS bar so if you are doing low activity actions such as fishing or cooking you can run it at 15fps and save your battery a ton of life.
---
It'll cost whatever someone who wants it is willing to pay for it.
---
It'll never be worth it for the average person
---
Ffs why the toe detail!! this subs fan art is some real footscape shit
---
Ya my biggest enemy is just getting high and staring at my character fashionscapping at the GE lol
---
Imagine the ranged xp if you chinned those
---
You sir..... hero

Are you able to do 25 plant runs at a time? I tried and it stressed me out so bad, couldn‚Äôt even do it.

Rtrrrrr

I don't think it's a meme at all. People genuinely think rangers is in a boot table that's different to every other unique. And that rolling wizzy means they missed rangers.
---
It's not true. It's sucky, but it's one of the better uniques to roll in that clue pool. So it's not absolutely sucky.
---
Imagine seeing this image as marketing for a game as one of your first impressions. From the outside looking in, OSRS graphics are an absolute monstrosity lol how does it get any new players when this is what they see on the App Store?
---
and who likes you? :(
---
I‚Äôve sort of done the opposite. Rigour makes Vork a lot easier and the dhcb takes so long to save for that I‚Äôd rather have rigour for other bossing/jad tasks, etc.
---
Still don't get how or why this is useful. Phones notification bar does the same and doesn't need a tap in a tiny corner that could register as movement.
---
I agree, I like the fury
---
yeah but that's 8 months mate
---
Have you tried paying 2k for it to be removed and re planting a new seed you've purchased on the grand exchange?
---
GUYS DONT FIGHT ITLL JUST DRAW MEDIA ATTENTION

The potions are crashing hard right now though, the Divine Range pots are still listed for like 14k in the GE, but in reality sell for like 4k.
---
the ultiamate flip , gratz

If I get 99 runecrafting in my entire life I‚Äôll honestly be surprised
---
And an Ironman account is supposed to stand alone, not utilize hundreds of other accounts to benefit just the iron account.  
---
But I'm kinda 50/50 on this one myself. I want content, but understand why he's doing it.
---
I've looked like I'm 30 since I was 14. It's a fine line to balance.
---
this post is for l33t money making guides
---
its ok

I've been working on some other Farming stuff. [This is my latest one](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/clleph/farming_helper_v0100/).
---
It's just the first draft, learning along the way, but I think it helps a bit. Working on v0.200 with a more friendly UI and trying to figure out how to work in inventory stuff. Gonna be neat (I hope)!

oooooooooooooo

Sugar

Honey

Ice

What else would one do at a party?
---
Yeah who doesn‚Äôt love pbr. Also shout out to Canada I visited there (Vancouver) for the first time like 2 months and I loved it

If you are willing to have it cost you 4-5m to access it for 2 weeks you can make an alt account and you get an extra 800 bank spaces.
---
Or make a f2p alt and use it to store all your ftp items
---
So give a genuine answer. 
---
If it‚Äôs genuine and it is ‚Äúused against you‚Äù then you should be able to back up your ideas.
---
Or just continue virtue signaling and never offending anyone by never holding a real position.
---
What's the plan for the months up to Runefest? Maybe September can be a general game improvement and QOL month?
---
wait, you think this is actually worth posting? like everyone has this pet you fucking loser
---
US and canada are almost the same country. They are closer together than say germany and france, even though they both magnitudes larger their social coherence is one and the same.
---
Both like guns, both value personal freedom above collective strength and both have origins as terrorists against hte UK creating independence. (Basically 4th of july for the US is a celebrating terrorism, though since the terrorists won it's called "freedom fighters').
