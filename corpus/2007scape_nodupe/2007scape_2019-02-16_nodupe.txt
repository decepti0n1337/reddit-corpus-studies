bawww my 500k!!! thats like 2 zulrah kills or vorkath or whatever lol there is no need to panic over that jesus christ

If you watch /u/Michael_RS's video on his Youtube channel, he said numerous times that in theory his record could be shattered down to 3 hours.  EVscape was the first to actually seize the invitation.
---
Sure, but there is no tag# in this image.

The boobs look off as well.

Did you use a reference to draw this or did you just wing it?

Oh man, I just shot Marvin in the face.

It's why I don't use the method. I'm terrible at it. I'll take the exp hit. 
---
something to note is, you may want to bring prayer potions at 43 prayer. It drains pretty quickly, an alternative is look up "Prayer flicking" and its a neat little tech that can increase how long you have prayer.

Here's the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ar09dy/alt_account_gone_for_doing_23rd_inferno/

I'm really confused why this didn't pass. It seems like a solid QOL update all around.
---
But now he cant sell his alt cause its banned
---
Nice 
---
Yeah the majority find the ditch nostalgic despite the fact it wasn't there. Same thing is happening with Hatius, talked with a guy in game that's voting no to removing that abomination because of nostalgia.
---
You would rather a crappy mini game over a new bis item? Can’t think of the last time I played a mini game and when I did it was mind numbingly boring for several HOURS to grind for fighter torso and void gear

So OP's screenshot also prove nothing.

Only if it counts as role play

So hard to fake a picture xd

Windows Mousekeys were used here to click (5), move the cursor up (2), and move it down (8).  This is entirely allowed.  EVscape just used AHK to remap the 2, 5, 8 keys to a letter on his keyboard.  Which is perfectly fine.  Jagex has continually said 1:1 keybing remaps are entirely allowed.  What isn't allowed is multiple actions per click, such as the commonly used **right click -&gt; move down [x] pixels -&gt; left click**. 
---
You're right ahrims staff is prob better, couldn't remember how much it costed. It's pretty cheap I assume though?
---
As for the 5m part, earlier you were proposing 6.6 minute chests, not 5m. 9 chests an hour is 6.6 minute chests (well discounting probably 2.25 minutes of your entire hour that is spent running at clan wars assuming 15s per run after each chest). 5m chests is 12 chests an hour which is more reasonable and would be more than 600k/hr
---
Is this r/beetlejuicing material? Can never tell the right way to use that sub. 
---
That's still 4 hours wasted since you should be doing this type of bolt fletching while doing agility or slayer.  The downtime between actions in other skills makes fletching technically a 0-hours-to-max skill.

What phone? I never have an issue using other apps with osrs running in the background unless my battery is below 15% and background data is shut off. 
---
Alright buddy, let's calm down now
---
Sheesh, I'll be glad if I get 1.5m to finish this bond grind! lol
---
People don't seem to mind click intensity, but what really sucks is attention/aim/timing.  People hate 3tick methods not because of the number of clicks per second (which is *way* less than bolt fletching) but because messing it up means failing the method.

Nah he probs just wants to be able to link users to reddit names so he can hack recover them 
---
I'd wear it on my main when bridding, tanking teams for a full tb is already easy enough with spec mechanics, why make it easier. 
---
Even worth bringing extra restores for, a brew is 64 hitpoints, a super restore is 124 prayer points, or 248 damage soaked. 
---
He didn't ask for you rsn retard. I pmd him and gave him what he asked for. What I enjoy doing in RS and why I want the money. My Reddit username doesn't even match my rsn, it isn't even close. Not to mention my security questions have never been answered anywhere on any of my social media.

Stop going full autism anytime something sounds too good to be true. Maybe the guy is seriously just giving away the gold. Based on the post literally above me he seems to have a lot of gold anyways. He's probably just rich.

You might want to try a different game. One that doesn't literally have the words "Old School" in the title, perhaps?

Yup that is why every game turns to shit usually cater to the plebs that are terrible and can’t learn how to put in effort to play the game correctly.

Could I add you in game incase I have anymore questions?

No one is crying or panicking you bloody moron. The term "panic sell" is just a fucking phrase..
---
My question was whether or not it was crashing due to an imcoming nerf or change. And while 500k may not be a lot it's also 500k in one fucking day..and if it drops 500k a day for a week then 3.5m is still a bit of money to me. Ive only played for a couple months. So please keep sounding more and more like an elitist douchebag. Once again, since you're incapable of reading and you lack any sort of fucking intelligence that even a 3 year old has I'll say it one more time: the worry was not 500k. The worry was if i missed an announcement or post about an upcoming nerf or change meaning its going to drop way more than 500k. You stupid, bread of an IQ fucking twat baby-dick shitface asshole prick cunt. Get that through your head. 
---
Phew. Now that all of that's out the way feel free to carry on your douchery to another post. 
---
You can change it
---
Depends on how streamlined it is. They could bot/afk the account in NMZ, transfer gear over, do the cape, boom a few hours of work for $750.

I skipped :)

TFW when you cast Fire Strike on your dad but it splashes.

Cons: catering to every random desire of weirdos posting on reddit. Ffs man just fucking right click - release placeholder. It is not that hard.
---
I thought the library technique was a really cool and unique way of levelling rc fast, until clients made it braindead and told you where every book was.
---
Whilst I personally would like to see the Divine added to reinvigorate Corp, I understand some of the issues you have with it. I think they're limited in that the Divine would have literally no impact on PvM and shake-ups in PvP meta should be refreshing and welcome, but yeah, I understand them. 
---
I don't like you crying fowl to discredit this poll, however. It's dishonest and misrepresents this situation in particularly as being different to any other people. Streamers have always swayed opinion one way or another, in each and every poll, and there will be a certain number who will vote blindly with their favourites. This however is quite frankly absurd:
---
&gt; How can we come to a fair decision if the polls are being manipulated like this?
---
Manipulated? Really? For every person Sparc Mac has convinced to vote yes, do you not think there is another voting no under the influence of another streamer, or, god forbid, of their own free will? Poll manipulation suggests what's happening is insidious. This is some dude in a sea of many other dudes trying to get his fans to vote with him. There's no conspiracy. It's the same with every poll. Dressing up your distaste for the Divine being added as streamers manipulating the poll in their favour is just plan dishonest. 
---
&gt;\- Your prayer points are only drained by HALF of the damage you reduce
---
which is a lot more than NONE
---
&gt; In certain PvM situations where protection prayers aren't needed people will be able to farm bosses/monsters for much more extended periods of  time. 
---
Such as? Most bosses you're limited by prayer.
---
&gt; It'll make many aspects of the game less challenging 
---
wouldn't say *many,* but the guaranteed reduction will make certain activities a bit more easier sure. Won't have to worry about getting 1 shot by Kril anymore, for instance. However he also drains a TON of prayer. You will probably not get longer trips with a divine but you will at least not get comboed out and die instantly.
---
&gt;what viable options does a PKer have versus someone with a Divine?  
---
I don't know what you mean by this though. Do you mean like edgeville pking? They can just refuse to fight them and/or use protection prayers if they attack the person anyways. Not to mention the current 'meta' is ags/gmaul stacking people for 130hp so it's just kind of whatever.
---
God bless
---
Life is so waste
---
thats just fucked up 
---
I really like this.  Might need some number tweaking, but I love the concept.
---
I wish I could erase my mind, just so I could re-watch all of Swmapletic's videos again for the first time.
---
Would make sense if 75 rc was a req as well.  It is the skill being trained afterall.
---
I voted yes. I'm not a PvPer. I vote based on what's healthy for the game, not based on what will affect me or out of spite.
---
Though, i'm getting closer on spite.
---
SPORK MAK BAD!
---
I was prepared for an awful suggestion but this is excellent. Great post.
---
They probably havent completed druidic ritual yet
---
Thanks for the advice dude!
---
are you simultaneously calling for things to be fixed promptly, but also be polled more? lmao, honestly the obsessive need to poll every little change is why shit ends up forgotten because it's not worth it
---
I just finished it at 80 ranged 75 defense. Used rune crossbow with ruby (e) against Galvek until he was partway through his final phase, then switched to diamond (e). Blessed body, Karils bottom, blessed Dhide boots, Verac’s helm for tanking purposes. Brought a couple super restores, a bastion potion, and tuna potatoes for the rest of the inventory. Took a few tries to learn his patterns, but I finished it in a sitting. It’s a great fight
---
This doesn't change the effective rate of xp/hr though, it just means you don't have to get ess from PvM.
---
Damn bro you a real one.i nutted half way through the intro to episode 1.
---
You have not stated which one(s) of the poll restrictions are you complaining about.    
---
There are many poll restrictions: 
---
* F2P can not vote.  
---
* Game time requirement.  
---
* Total level requirement.  
---
If you can state which ones you are complaining about, the reddit community could give you an answer to why that poll restriction exists.

Why does alex jones get more update suggestions than goblin cluescroll only uims?

He's using in-game methods to solve in-game problems. He's technically not breaking any rules.

Can Castle Wars get some love from the devs? Its a real fun minigame. I would also like to rep zammy in my house tho

I still do a lot of the time. For me and my friends its worlds 1-99 then 400+

If you want to learn efficiency, there's several guides on Youtube for how to train a skill from 1-99.

oldschool.runescape.wiki has all the information you need in it.
---
If something like this ever did manage to pass, I would be more in favor of the banking resembling interactions with servants. For every X amount of times you access your POH bank you pay X in GP.
---
Well, Jagex said they'd be polling more changes to fix konar's droptable for good, so I'm not calling for anything that hasn't already been promised?
---
Personally I think the polling system is vestigial.  It was meant to keep osrs old school and only allow changes through everyone liked, but now that the game isn't old school anymore it's just used as a political bludgeon for players to fight against each other.
---
How rare are unicorns I saw one today just walking around
---
Do they have any special drops should I have killed it?
---
people want the original game but as far as i remember to the original game was there was no ditch in general so i dont understand why people are voting no.
---
I rly don’t care. Gl on your trolls m8
---
Thats why i always carry that cape
---
It's a good feeling, my dude!
---
Enjoy the 3 hour fapping grind
---
If the guy is just encouraging people to vote yes then he's manipulating nothing. Do you not share your opinion with your clan? Your friends in game? This is that. His audience is just larger. That shouldn't exclude him from having an opinion. There's likely as many streamers with as much influence telling viewers they are voting no to it. Is it only poll manipulation if it's in favour of something you don't want?
---
Of course, if he's specifically giving away gold to persuade voters as the user below implies (which I highly doubt, as that's almost a guaranteed ban), then yeah, action should be taken. If he's just giving his opinion and encouraging his fanbase to vote for what he believes in, then I see no issue.
---
I think it needs more motivation to play. Revamped reward system perhaps?
---
They have spawns just like everything else. I don't think they drop anything of note. 
---
Don't forget about how much he probably RWTs from his osrs gambling. 
---
Can you smoke weed in this game
---
u have to do that in the beginning anyways, u did that til 100? lol wtf
---
Yeah I just bought the gold and got the item at the ge. Yeah people think I’m a troll for just being honest. I don’t care though I’ll do what I want. Like I said it’s just a game to play to pass the time. Glad you get it.
---
Ah thank you
---
Me and all of my alts voted no, you're vote is invalid.
---
Oof. Thoughts and prayers, man.
---
Dumbass, you just edited the post and typed in [removed]

“It usually doesn’t” you said that explicitly yet I have sufficient evidence to believe it does at least more than you. That is why I said inb4 I get downvoted.

Yea I didnt delete it. All good if people think I did, but thanks mods! Ready for smackdown if it comes. I got the cape legit on my own account and theres indisputable proof- I streamed it. Im not worried about anything. Thanks. 
---
Well, you can deal over 130 damage with one combo in pvp. So the divine honestly is kinda necessary to balance out that aspect.
---
Also you act like the divine never existed before, it did, and it was fine. Wasn't the end of the world, not even that many people used it overall, especially for pvp. Honestly I want it added because it should've been in game from when they added corp, it was strange that it wasn't there.
---
thanks!
---
LMAO he deleted his account. 
---
I don't think they have any effect on how many nests you get, so it really doesn't matter. So anything cheap that you've got just laying around would be the best bet.

---
had to click the tree again, sry
---
They're all technically the same except for Wildbloods which only require half as much. However, value-wise generally jutes are the most effective.
---
A solution that only applies to people who have completed a grandmaster quest? I wouldn't call that fixing runecrafting.
---
Dinhs is 6m and is a good option for tanking for pvmers/skillers in the wild. It'll still have that.
---
The divine eats through prayer. People who dismiss its pray drain as minimal never owned it and used it in rs2 pre eoc. 
---
Rs2 also had renewals, super ppots, YAKS and after sometime, flasks which increased all your renewals/super ppots into 6 doses. 
---
Prayer wasn't as big of a deal in rs2 as it is in osrs. Like all of godwars the bottle neck is prayer, not food. Maybe food at arma, if you get unlucky but usually its prayer bottleneck. Sara its prayer/stam. 
---
Being more tanky in places like godwars doesn't matter, when you already can go in welfare tanking gear and last til all your prayer runs out. 
---
The game is heavily dpsscape. It'd see less use than Ely in pvm in todays game. Which is already hardly ever used anyway. Pvp, maybe? Don't get smited for it. 
---
You can’t bot quests. You can’t bot chinning or bursting. You can bot nmz, but you don’t necessarily need any melee combat stats if you’re good enough, those would be your bot hours.
---
It’s at least 100 hours of work.
---
&gt;If I made that account on my own I’d be giving up thousands of dollars in opportunity cost. 
---
I mean not really... unless you literally spend every waking hour working.
---
With mobile now I do pretty much all AFKable combat training at work so zero opportunity cost.
---
&gt;I like how all of the responses I've received have basically tried to imply that I'm retarded
---
🤔
---
They just feel like the odd one out. The rest are all high DPS or strong KO weapons that you could argue as integrity issues, at least with some like Blowpipe or Granite Maul. Then there are Ferocious Gloves, which are powercreep, but not really an integrity thing.
---
Right, PvM is justified making more money given the effort, cost of gear and using food/supplies, no argument there. I think skills capping at 50% what bossing can provide sounds reasonable imo. Like 1m/hr woodcutting is modest pay, but if people can make 2m/hr bossing it'd still be more popular and worth their time. Right now, woodcutting being ~100k an hour and bossing being ~4m/hr with luck sounds really depressing to a person who just got 99 woodcutting.
---
Uniques added 700k an hour?
---
In which case yeah, gonna go with pretty shady. I'm all for streamers and clans encouraging people to vote based on their reasoning, but gp incentives to vote with you is decidedly grey area.
---
I have said it since the start and i will say it again. Why would you do this to yourself when you know 99.9% of the time your death will be the result of a dc. I couldn't put myself through it
---
time for an Al-Kharid locked UCIM
---
True. It is my dad who is the greatest.
---
Rs2 had renewals, super ppots, YAKS and after sometime, flasks which increased all your renewals/super ppots into 6 doses.
---
Prayer wasn't as big of a deal in rs2 as it is in osrs.
---
It's almost like it's all one game.
---
Do abyss runecrafters and clue hunters get to vote in PvP polls? How about wildy bossers? How about green dragon bots, do they get a vote? Your proposal is asinine. PvP can have exclusive polls when there isn't non-PvP content in PvP zones.
---
Yet another example of why playing HCIM is never worth it. 
---
wait pale gingers don't do well in the sun
---
Yeah
---
A surprise in the video for those who watched.
---
It is a good lesson to learn on a game than having to in real life. For example, now you know to go to official websites for things like this. If you see an ad than go to the actual website, if you went to runescape.com, you’d have realized it was a scam. So if you get emails or calls asking for bank info, go to actual banking website or call the official # of the bank when you get calls from a person claiming things with financial issues etc.
---
Yup 
---
Jagex cant run a lottery.

I think hes just maxing the account

Lol really?

When mom forces you to take your little brother with you.

You can make a sort of xp tracker setting up XP drops but its a bit inconvenient and only shows you one skill at a time and you have to manually reset it :/
---
If you look up his account, he has less total exp as a hardcore, meaning he's gained xp since dying. 100% real.
---
Hence “small percentage”
---
Going dry for something and going 10x the drop rate for something are entirely different. One is possible to accomplish.
---
good
---
He's still a pretty small tuber though, I don't think he makes that much from it. 
---
If it's a dc why wouldn't they just give him hcim back? 
---
He uses the crappy RS client instead of a more stable one like runelite. 
---
H nsfw
---
Just on an unrelated note what kind of comics/superhero movies does b0aty prefer? I really enjoy Marvel but I feel like he's more of a DC man

Ok, I go to sleep now and when I wake up I hope that this was just a dream.

HCIM Comes To An End, He Is Done OSRS

What quests do you need  for inferno? Only req is having a fire cape. Range cape acts like Ava’s. B gloves aren’t a req since clearly 1 def pures can do inferno. Rest of gear can be bought via the GE. 
---
You can alch mage and bot range via NMZ. 
---
You aren’t actually putting in work if you’re botting... 16 minutes = 100 hours botted. Takes 1 min to setup a script. Script goes for 6 hours. 16.6 sessions for 100 hours. Not sure how hard this is to grasp when a bot is doing the work and you aren’t physically sitting at the keyboard doing the work.... only work involved is doing Inferno. 
---
They can’t run a lottery that requires $$ to enter. Any giveaway that a big company has will always say “no purchase necessary” 
---
My sister grinds her weed with a mortar and pestle. Really 
---
I'm sad
---
i voted no because i think regular black dhide chaps should have a defence requirement, i had no idea they didnt until we had that poll. and it makes 0 sense that they dont require defence, its a level 70 range amour
---
Yes you do
---
Late reply sorry, but it was near the start of the stream. 
---
For you maybe, but damn is it boring and slow
---
Can’t believe all women are like this 
---
Ranger boots grind #5 boys
---
FeelsIncredibleMan Clap
---
Yup
---
From Jagex’s perspective, the alt likely bought an infernal. Due to using VPN, they can’t see that a static IP is associated with all of these accounts. The ban on your alt was undeserved and should be retracted.
---
However, there is clear evidence that you sold an account for $750. To some, it’s made worse by the fact the account had an infernal cape. 
---
You should be banned on all accounts.
---
Runelite having 10,000 easyscape features does not make the original client bad. It just means runelite is op, not the other way around.
---
unless you're a streamer
---
I'd say you're sensationalizing it. You don't pk, and you don't understand it. It's a shame that people can actually get angry about pvp happening in a designated pvp area that you do not have to enter.
---
There was an update called 'wilderness rejuvenation' where enticing resources were added into the wildy in order to draw people in. In order to participate in the wealths of the wilderness, you've gotta take the risk.
---
You've never solo pk'd. That much is clear. When you're geared up and you're on the hunt, and you've been running around for 20 minutes and you see someone wearing nothing, you're not going to ignore them. You don't get it. You kill everyone - especially if they're wearing nothing. A lot of people bring stuff they shouldn't into the wild including me sometimes.
---
BAMBOOZLED!
---
he uses runelite
---
I think he does use runelite but with no plugins 
---
I would love there "Quality of life" updates would be something like this it would make tracking skills alot more convenient.
---
I'd say the problem with this (and with profitable skilling in general) is that alts are allowed now. Alting is probably one of the bigger reasons behind the meta shifting away from profitable skilling (outside of Hunter), as you could generate essentially infinite money while you did max XP/hr skills. So if bossing at Zulrah took nearly all my attention and made 2m/hr, but woodcutting took a modest amount of attention at 1m/hr, I think I'd just play alts and do the woodcutting method for more gp/hr than Zulrah or do the Woodcutting method and Zulrah on an alt.
---
jagex
---
They realised their mistake after they made the poll which makes it too late to just cancel it.  
---
Not an ironman (btw) so I could be wrong on this, but it seems that they don't like gathering sand for hours on end to get 99 crafting, so jagex proposed a solution, but then realised it was too good after they polled it - and that they should have split the question into parts.
---
Rather than break the game (maybe I'm over exaggerating), but at the same time not leave the majority that wanted the change disappointed, they offer a compromise, sort of like "we can't give exactly what you wanted in the poll but we can give something that fulfills the same purpose" (more variety in ways to get sand)
---
Nah he uses runelite, died while on it

I played with rs client 12 hours a day for a month w/o getting dced even once. 100% its his internet.
---
So fucking stupid. Seems like every high ranked HCIM gets fucked by a DC. 
---
but the original question is whether it's "integrity threatening" not how powerful it is
---
tbow's gimmick inherently makes it not an all powerful weapon at the majority of places it doesn't come from. (i'm fine with things like tbow and scythe being the #1 item to have at the place that drops them) in the future they can make bosses as weak or strong versus the bow as they want very easily without compromising any other mechanics or resistances.
---
slippery slope 99 meme weapon on every boss is redic because if you dont have to resupply or engage in boss mechanics your kill potential is increasing by like 500%, versus the bow at most places is really only speeding up like 10/20% for a super endgame weapon
---
one is integrity threatening, one is just powerful
---
why are you comparing ultimate to rs3?
---
Sincerely, pro divine squad
---
Goodbye to half the populations quest capes.
---
Seriously though, he's ridiculously good at pretty much everything in this game. Seeing where he actually dies to a mistake would feel so much better. 
---
I will be there sir.
---
I had a lot of fun using the Optimal Quest Guide on the Wiki to get a QPC. If you'd like to use a very efficient route for getting all of the early levels out of the way while getting your QPC then I'd recommend that.
---
he didn't DC to jagex servers tho lol

Smh

Serp helm buff which caused the price of scales to also rise, serp helm crashed after update which also crashed the price of scales

It failed with PvP included. So they tried again with PvP out and now people are complaining that it should include PvP. It's a catch 22, if you want it to happen then you should vote yes and take what you can get.
---
There was a CC I used about a year ago that may still be around. I believe it was “thievinghost”. If not that it’s something very similar.

Getting old? He hadn't even started the good stuff.
---
Yeah, this is a real bummer..
---
Integrity change
---
You can't die if you got the diary unless you dc. You got way more than enough time, the death itself and zulrah's attacks are way delayed after you're ressurected.
---
Exactly pvp content effected me when I got pked but since I dont do it more I dont get a say? That is the part you are missing
---
It is all one game, but just as there pkers and pvmers, there’s safe areas and unsafe. Nothing is forcing you into the wilderness except your own choices.
---
Then people just pull out ethernet cable when they panic.
---
Oh I didn't even know those are in the game they look pretty nice. Happy accident cause I meant to ask under the bucket helm g (didn't even know there was an untrimmed bucket helm also)
---
If nothing else, removing the ability to bank books with Imp boxes would be enough.
---
They need to implement a rule where if jagex kills your hc jagex fucking fixes it. Revert ur account 24hr to the DC or some shit. Literally 0 reason to make one of these accounts. 
---
it is.
---
He said he doesnt plan on making another, said it would take him 2.1k hours to get back to where he was. 
---
Just some weed humor with the boys 
---
this is practically r/swampletics now 
---
And people thought pure pkers were just being fashionable...
---
d
---
I passed because idk who tf he even is
---
The autism is strong with this one.
---
Excuses me? You voted no on colored chaps because you don’t like that Black d hide chaps are only 1def requirement? How does voting no in the god versions affect the black d hide not having a def req? 
---
Classic
---
Could never prove someone didn't just pull the plug after getting into an impossible situation. It'll never happen.
---
I would think 3a would be an exception for me obvious reasons.
---
S
---
cant you just buy extra lives in rs3? ezscape btw
---
Your friend Dylan is the reason 25x is banned.  I'll be sniping that rsn when it frees up
---
I don’t like this collection you can only put on one at a time!! 
---
I don't play on mobile.  Also from the poll question, it looks like I wouldn't be able to have it not resize and have filters.  Is this accurate?  If so, where is the option for me to have a filter and not have it resize outside of pvp if this were to pass?
---
They moved them to Rimmington in the most recent update for whatever reason
---
Down to the depths of rs3 with it!
---
Probably because the books aren't in those shelves..... don't trust the plugin. Just talk to the librarian and search the shelves that runelite thinks has ANY book highlighted 
---
Same question to the people voting yes, it's just an NPC standing there.  Couldn't care less so no reason to remove.
---
An area locked uim would be fun to see even though it’s unlikely he’ll do it, probs best to stay on his now dead hardcore even it just feels like a waste 
---
You can make them say different things, i was doing it earlier
---
AlL pVm RuInS iNtEgRiTy
---
Have you calculated how long it would take assuming the (unattainable) 9 sets of darts per tick, every tick?
---
Again and again and again.
---
For real. Doesn’t matter how far you come, the DCs are unavoidable 
---
Ah ok thank you so much man. Answered my question
---
Nice
---
Based Bwaner. 
---
Nah being hardcore changes early-level playstyle significantly. Mage Arena Rune store is now much riskier, can't suicide for quick teles, have to safe a lot more during quests. Hell, boaty waited all the way until doing Western Elite diaries to kill Zulrah.
---
If you don't care about the status it's way better to just start as a normal ironman and save yourself the extra stress
---
It existed before rs3 genius, it released when the Corporeal Beast did, it should’ve been in osrs when we got Corp, still don’t know why they felt the need to poll it when they didn’t poll its other drops.
---
That doesn't look like Zulrah
---
He doesn’t have the required prayer level yet
---
Yeah, they people will find something else to complain about when all the polls they want fail and they can't blame it on that anymore
---
 He *could.*
---
Let me just do this justiciar + divine inferno run really quick. Won't even need to change my prayers! 
---
I'm kinda confused why everyone is  confused. All I'm asking is which of the  f2p skills have a higher earning potential as a member. The example being that I'm lvl 66 fishing but can't fish monkfish because I'm not a member. Or maybe I can craft some kind of better jewelry as a member that I can't in f2p.
---
I'm trying to make an easy transition into being a member. Something that I'm already doing but can do better with a membership. I know I can do the diaries and slayer and motherload mine...those things just take alot of in members time to finish, and I want to start making some pocket money as soon as I land with skills I either already have or can level up to in f2p
---
I see, so you want to be able to use filters and keep the icons tiny. I misunderstood. No i guess you can't do that. I'm not sure i understand why you would ever want that though.
---
Bar the swastika i think these things are pretty funny and harmless can give you some good entertainment
---
probably all the non-streamer HCIMs who died to DC
---
I’m hoping that it makes some headway over the weekend, but there’s so many people that are just anti everything high lvl that it’ll probably fail.
---
Its really easy to make it impossible to be attacked while bagging
---
UuuUuuUuuuggghhHhhh
---
how can you tell which US worlds are west coast vs east coast 
---
The Ken Jeong episode today was great too
---
He did mention in a stream that if he ever tried a restricted mode it would only be 2 things. 1 skroom bites the bullet and 2 it would be a zeah only Ironman. 
---
I think this would be good to see. 
---
I hope you’re not being serious 
---
Yeah no, this game legit has a more active playerbase than WoW.
---
Or they click a teleport in game? What is the difference?
---
It was originally released in 2008 which was indeed Rs2, not Rs3
---
My cash stack is ready. 
---
I vote for yearly reenactments. 
---
In all fairness it does seem like it wouldn't be the worse update not only due to how expensive it would be to use, but also the shift from the dps meta it might have at certain bosses, with off hand shields at this stage mainly being used as a switch rather than a permanent feature. because of this if it does get implemented they should include a timer similar to the bullwark, that only after having it equiped for a few seconds, will the damage reduction for prayer point ability kick in
---
This
---
Better level up he’d more fast so he can make sunblock then.
---
I *like* beind reminded of my rolls. 
---
Just vote on mobile, problem solved.
---
Retard...
---
Are you.okay
---
But in the instance of god dhide losing its defense requirement it lost purely out of malice over the spell book change. Too many people where burnt and unhappy about that failing that they purposefully voted against something the streamers who destroyed it wanted.
---
lul true 
---
Thus another example of why the entire hcim system is just a waste of time. Your not waiting to die from a mistake, your waiting to die from jagex’s mistakes. Why bother making an account to try to never die when at least 50% of all deaths outside of pking or minigames is disconnect related. 
---
There is just no point. You will eventually disconnect and die no matter what. 
---
What other people said, plus the fact that the DC was on his side. It would set a bad precedent if you could avoid death by pulling your Ethernet cable.
---
If I was a big time streamer I would invest in dedicated connection bonding hardware. You know split it over a few 4g and cable and fiber.
---
I'm not sure why he dc'ed but i haven't dc'ed in months personally :|
---
It still sucks though...
---
RS3 you can buy revives when you get a certain total lvl
---
All I’m seeing is that you’re forcing yourself into pvp situations to die and are butthurt that you’re going to lose your chance to indirectly hurt the pkers back.
---
Best shield for tanking.
---
It's effect was similar to an elys 
---
Press F for respect
---
Yeah you say that but it's to cover things like disconnections so you don't have to create a new account every single time you dc lmao. You get 3 chances to dc instead. 
---
Do you have assembler?
---
vote no fk this shield way to op.
---
I would like to clarify that I understand to everyone a whip may not be a huge accomplishment, but to me I never thought it was possible to get when I was younger so it was somewhat of a meaningful thing to me.
---
Lmao B0aty stream seems more believable now.
---
He doesn’t use any of them....
---
Nah it finds out the worlds best internet connection
---
Justiciar makes it harder to complete the inferno tho
---
Thanks for the feedback I'll try to do that. In later episodes there will be more content because of the clue scroll requirements so it might be easier to get away with a longer video without it being boring to watch. Ill try to keep the content to an interesting minimum going forwards.
---
It's not safe but you can get your stuff back. I think it's 50k to get it back or something.
---
I'm curious, and maybe I missed this in the post, but do you use the crystal on the pure essence? I'd support this if it were so and the exp rates matched/were less than blood/souls
---
Most retarded thing i hear around here. Power creep = progression. Progression = good for the health of the game. Deal with it man...
---
You sound ignorant. I don’t use gmaul 
---
K, point is it was a swampletics reference.
---
le
---
gnome
---
kek
---
Which drop are we looking for in this picture?
---
Seriously if I got paid a shit load of money to make a new account every couple months I would do it
---
Wait, the player betting doesn't get any punishment?!?!
---
Nieve is old and busted, Konar is the new hotness
---
It's been done a million times though. Ironmen doing raids is nothing new. 
---
Future man here, be worried.
---
Oh I didn’t know you were giving them away
---
Alright cool thanks, was nervous about that
---
Nah but I enter the wilderness which is pvp content so I should be able to vote on pvp content
---
Soup died at dags and boaty died at sire. They were doing both of those way before dwh.
---
7 days of no internet failure is good??? Why would you not just set up 2 networks and always have a fallback. Seems careless considering he is oozing money
---
Me Taaaahxic buzzword fad.
---
Broo i thought you died u stopped replying to me
---
Lul
---
Nothing is forcing you out of the wilderness except your own choices. Restrict PvPers from voting on non-PvP polls.
---
No lifting during Christmas break. About 8-10 hours per day of play time. Got to level 85 combat and a fire cape. Not bad for my first month of playing. Then again I already knew what I was doing since I played from 2004-2011. 
---
No
---
It relies more on having hit points
---
And because it's a cancer method that rapidly saps the enjoyment out of your soul. 
---
360kc one unsired, dagger. Could have taken ages anyways ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Lmfao «swamp man good» 😂
---
Partly because Prayer is a lot more plentiful in RS at the time it was released and whilst it was useful. It won't be nearly as good in OSRS.
---
*Wooo* It's your **3rd Cakeday** zombieking10! ^(hug)
---
Rs2's Corp was also locked behind 2 quests, which also required summoning though if you want to talk about being true to the original.
---
Rather than just saying 'please vote yes' why not make a case as to why this should be in the game other than, 'it could allow cool bosses in the future'. I don't think content should require a specific item, sure it could be optimal but new content shouldn't be designed around the divinea
---
That's why I said without using the plugins
---
Well, I don't like your mom because she's not a hat!
---
He was about a month from theater of blood
---
I feel like if you die to dcs they don't count so you can just keep playing as if you didn't dc.
---
When you make a living by putting out content. Otherwise you’re correct, this game mode is a joke because of servers. 
---
“Not expensive to use” what???
---
Literally 200gp every attack and it has a 2tick attack speed. 
---
A lot of comments are saying to get a membership. I'm obviously planning on getting a membership if I'm asking what I should do once I'm a member?  Is this a dumb question? I don't understand the confusion
---
You can look at the ping. Runelite has it listed on worldswitcher plug in, or you can just ling the server with a terminal.
---
Naah, but you're right, if only we could put on them all at once!
---
Marry me. 
---
C ya hick
---
Exactly. The payout has been done a lot. Do something original like the pvp series that made him popular. 
---
It passed twice with PvP included. Then Jagex did not honor either of those, polled it a third time and it barely failed.
---
But yes, I agree with the last sentence.
---
yeah it's so much grinding in runescape, where as in a ARPG like diablo or Path of exile you can spend 2 days getting back to the content you were doing before.
---
I no shit died 10 minutes into my HCIM bc disconnect beside dark wizards on my way to Varrock 😂 but I feel like this could be abused. 
---
Kourend has a lot of content.
---
Sand Crabs are fantastic early game training.
---
Konar is an interesting slayer master. She assigns monsters in specific areas, like Abyssal Demons in the Slayer Tower. When you kill monsters on her task you can get a Brimstone Key which can open the chest near Konar. I think average loot from it is about 100k.
---
Farming guild is awesome
---
Woodcutting guild is cool if you like woodcutting
---
Catacombs of Kourend is a great slayer dungeon with a shit ton of monsters, with stronger variants of some. Everything in it can drop Dark Totem pieces which are used to fight Skotizo and Ancient Shards which is used to make and charge Arclight
---
Karuum Dungeon is a nice slayer dungeon. Has Wyrms, Drakes, and Hydras. Requires stone boots, granite boots, or brimstone boots or you take damage constantly in the dungeon
---
Lizardmen Shamans drop Dragon Warhammers. 
---
You can craft blood and soul runes. It's very AFK high level runecrafting training
---
Ensouled Heads are a good cheap way to train prayer
---
I had a bank pin, and the authenticator was disabled for less than a day. I've never clicked on double xp or any of that bullshit. I'm guessing it comes down to having used third party clients such as OSbuddy or Runelite.
---
cool thx
---
How is being neutral dangerous?
---
And anyway how would we know if it should not be the lifeline of a country? Not quite optimal but better than having no lifeline, i mean it does not effect you that much anyway does it? 
---
why would i vote for the god versions to have 0 defence requirement when i think both should have a defence requirement? thats literally what i just said, pker brainlet
---
I wanted to start a regular ironman and said fuck it I'll just do HCIM so I can see how far I get because I don't care. Truth is, you start caring and when I died I was devastated, granted I was only around 700 total level but still.. I'm over it now just can't imagine getting that far and getting fucked over like this.  
---
Soup and b0aty both going down to technical difficulties...
---
10000000000% easier to die in rs3
---
Gl everyone
---
He said if he goes out on a dc he will continue unofficial hcim and see how far he can get.
---
It's on their back log of thing to do.
---
No problem
---
Should be a feature that only tp’s you if it detects that you’ve dced. I’d say almost all players go a minute or so without interacting with the game at all
---
HCIM is useless because there are no public Boss kc hiscores or any real indicators of how much risk you expose your account to. All skills can be trained safely. Only real thing on the hiscores that is notable for HCIMs is Hard-Master clue scrolls.
---
Try the Aussie servers. They're gr8 I swear
---
Clearly the universe is not ready for such a technique.
---
Dead ginger press F to pay respect to the whale whisperer 
---
Divine has no place in the game as we curretly have the elly which is fairly balance for what it does and offer. For the pking community, the divine will make single pking even worst for those who will have it fighting those who don't. Elly is pretty strong as it is but the divine will make a 70 ags hit only do 49. That is absurd even for the prayer drain which you can make up for with the less damage you will take with an extra super restore potion in your inventory. 
---
I hope you commit suicide genuinely.
---
yeah thats insane, crazy to think i got 4 mutagens somehow. Maybe thats why i havent had a good drop since the good ol zulrah days haha 
---
cool maths 
---
I click on Edward in Canfis bank at least once a week 
---
Wow,not even by a jmod... 
---
100k a death
---
Not only are you wrong, you don't even know how scales are consumed.
---
Kinda funny he “missed” the hardcore icon in his name  
---
True yeah, I just saw the video where he recapped his death. “I’ll confinue as an unofficial hcim which no one cares about but me”
---
He’s still a hardcore in my heart though
---
dont care, its a stupid design choice and on a recent livestream there was a lot of support for making metal armor have larger negative bonuses to range so people stop wearing metal armor for pking with ranged. this is old school not 2007scape, stupid design should be changed
---
Happy to be corrected, but I don't think it is abusable. The user would need to constantly send input to the server to prevent themselves from being teleported. Most players do this anyway, or could easily do so if necessary. If someone was about to die, they wouldn't just pull their internet out and be saved - they would be better off just clicking on a tele tab. This would just mean that your character wouldn't dumbly sit there being hit until it died.
---
No they wouldn't. I have no problem with Jagex helping out streamers as big as b0aty on issues like that. He's one of the games biggest stars. I don't even play rs anymore but i'm still on this sub and follow the game cause of players like him.
---
Hi friend
---
Most slayer bosses follow the same trend of sire. The money is ok but you're hanging out for the black tourmaline core, dagger and bludgeon, primordial crystal. Hydra is the standout where it is good money per kill too
---
I’ll see ya there!
---
Oh shut up, you're only saying this because he's doing something you dislike.
---
I was on that day.  Just watching my bank dry up building planks. Everyone remembers where they were.
---
Haha, wasn’t too bad for fletching or firemaking, but it’s been killing me for farming!
---
Wont save a dead game
---
The Divine is a gateway item... before you know it there are going to be 126's all strung out on nex gear and shooting stars. Not even once.
---
Or you could let people enjoy both the challenge and the masochistic enjoyment of the eventual DC?
---
He jinxed himself. He got off he said he'll go do some sire offstream and die..
---
To be fair he should have died to galvak in ds2. 
---
Actually suggesting that im the worst aspects I'd both
---
It may have been. It is possible that it was just overrated too. Idk if it had the same effect as the OSRS version being polled, but this version at this time wouldn't be OP. Losing prayer points would mean shorter boss trips. 
---
The Ely gives 25% damage reduction 70% of the time with no drawback. That is good enough for what it is. Even still, nobody actually uses the Ely for bossing since DPS is all that matters these days. Boss can't damage you if it's dead.
---
its not even the slowest skill lol. Idk why people cry about it so much.
---
Yeah I feel like Real time is much better for this. Because then you could take like a month and just log in for 5 minutes at a time every once in a while and spam until you get tired then stop.
---
I really don't understand why you would want to make it easier, even though it's impressive and fun when you're good at it it's still pretty simple to learn compared to other games, like how can people not figure out pvp on a point and click java game?
---
&gt;You think you're a pro-ass mother fuckin' csgo player?? Keep your tiny ass heads. Fine. But I'm shit at getting headshots, especially with heads as small as they are. Make the heads big and easy to 1 deag, and I could learn to play csgo like the rest of you big brained russians.
---
&gt; dont care
---
I gathered that much. 
---
It's great for some stuff
---
protection prayers help with that
---
Sure but at the end of the day, you still need 1600-ish ehp to max. 4 hours more or less isn't going to make a huge difference
---
Did he not tank a galvak bomb earlier on?
---
This is fucking retarded.......it’s perfect. I love it. 
---
Lmao preach 
---
Voting yes so Curtis has to go back to corp
---
Or they could just make a report system to submit a clip when you’ve died from disconnection and they could reinstate the status after reviewing the clip. 
---
This is one of those things where everyone’s all cool about it but once it finally happens to you your a pissy shit about it and rage. 
---
Wholsomescape
---
Maybe the client could send a "heartbeat" to the server, which would trigger a teleport (AFTER 5 SECONDS) if the player DCd. But there has to be a delay, otherwise people would just hack clients to DC them before death.
---
How long should i have to do the brimhaven agility arena for in order to get the full blue graceful?
---
I remember him before we went on his farm run...
---
“When was the last time my internet dropped... 7 days? I’ll trust that”

---
Fuck DCs.... ughhhh.
---
Dude, some nights I spend more time playing my spreadsheets than actually playing lol. 
---
Wtf? He had 700kc. 2 bludgeon pieces, 3 daggers, 1 head, 1 jar. 
---
Also I was suggesting a rarely used feature, like something you would activate on your way to do some risky pvm and not use most of the time
---
When the only things that can defeat HCIM are disconnects. 
---
Bring him back.
---
Hes a god damn diddler
---
One man army was like 80% Ironman 
---
Cmon bruh
---
This is how I imagine half the people who vote on polls are.
---
Too soon 🤧.
---
Hahahahahahahaha How The Fuck Is Taking Damage Real Hahahaha Nigga Just Pray Flick The Attack Like Nigga Set Up Quick Prays Haha
---
Pretending to be a gorilla to skull trick
---
Oh look, another high ranked HCIM dies to a dc.
---
I wish there was some way to get a collective data of 1500+ total level HCIM deaths that were followed by a DC
---
He got to raids in his Infernal Cape from Scratch series
---
How does the voting no on the god version affect the defense req on the regular black hides? By voting no on that poll what did you accomplish?
---
Crafting till 80 is probably a good start.
---
It must depend where you live, I can still count the amount of times i've dc'd on one hand.
---
Offlyne
---
I don't have a question but I just got ranger boots from my 101st medium clue and I have no friends to tell. 
---
You’re literally the reason I spite vote any PVM update on every account. Tit for tat. 
---
w334 represent
---
4 hours 
---
Can I add new information that wasn’t originally presented too? 
---
And don’t underestimate autistic uses of extra inv slots, still I think jagex should just log you out effectively instead of trying to re establish which 9/10 ends in a dc anyway.
---
id much rather be in the lobster business. costs more but its worth it
---
it kept at least some of the armor with appropriate defence requirements. if i voted yes then that problem would be worse. seems pretty obvious, lol
---
Trade him a chair flatpack and tell him to "sit kid"
---
Which dev actively PKs though? Im willing to bet none do
---
ZMI level 30-99 is so boring  though.
---
H
---
So crap to see him die to a DC of all things. He deserved a warriors death. RIP 
---
I don't know anything about this method you guys are using, but how fast could it technically be done? I do a lot of typing tests of varying difficult and I can consistently type 150+ WPM on easier tests and around 120-130+ WPM for tests with more special characters or advanced vocabulary. Should I give this a shot?
---
Jagglefox has to hide what the potions benefits are. The only thing listed is that is a significant boost to fighting zulrah. That way people who can’t do it think it’s helping them and maybe they will beat it. Also they would 100% hide what the potion does before they hide votes at the poll booth. 
---
way more pvmers than pvpers, your vote doesnt matter so it really doesnt bother me. i see it bothers you a lot though, maybe you should be kinder to people in game and people wouldnt spite vote pkers?
---
Smh my head 
---
Y u mad tho?
---
Ayyyy ur shit @ the game m8!!!! As useless in game as he is in real life! /s
---
Pkers complain, poll fails. They try to accommodate pkers, still fails. Why can't we have nice things?
---
Just an assembler. I'm just a combat 76 little nooblet.
---
Did his HC die or something?
---
That always happens to me with cows when I’m freaking training Ranged.
---
73
---
this is like those whiney children who go to walmart with their parents and complain that they didn't get the newest edition of the fortnite action figure collection and start screaming wildly like monkies just to make an embarrassment out of themselves 
---
Weird, I'm American too and always read it as goo-thix
---
First things first... fuck you. Second thing... you’ve changed my my mind. Ima do a bit more research but if these figures are true then I’ll probably vote yes. Good job sir
---
Yea it's after the teleport attack that you need to run away from the sire to avoid that 60 damage nuke. It is possible to get stacked out by minions, but if you have decent defence stats you shouldn't ever die without noticing your health dropping.
---
I don't know the max kills per hour, but I think 15 is about right. If you used a tbow and were super sweaty with how quickly you banked/ran back to the boss you might be able to get 18-20, but idk
---
What are your thoughts on f2p magic armors? Might we ever get new gear?
---
what if i told you idk who the frick that is
---
not sure how things have developed, but i just got at 1 pearl and 65 fish.
---
Funny how this time of year(around RS birthday)there's always tons of connection issues....
---
wyrms are decent enough to be botted? they were such a shit task tho
---
Can you please do a non-members world? thanks
---
No, he was being antivaxx
---
Haha I’m almost certain he isn’t. 
---
Both are definitely good. To me code geass is just what death note did but better is all. God complexes, skewed ideas of justice, 5D chess
---
WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT
---
This quest has been out for a while.. 
---
I dont get why people think divine is OP we dont have the methods of prayer restore that the game did when it was added
---
Couldn't care less, an npc is an npc whatever they look like.
---
He's banned now mate
---
I've dcd only a couple times in all the time ive played osrs.
---
I also don't play 12 hours a day. Im sure he has more play time on skroomoomlie than I do on my main
---
You realize you can drink prayer pots or super restores to get more prayer points, right?  The amount of prayer drain is basically meaningless.  At level 99 hp a brew restores 64 hp, and a super restore restores 128 prayer.  That means the divine will block 256 damage just to go through a single restore.
---
That means you have to go through over 9 brews (597 unblocked damage) to have lost just one restore potion.
---
Both of those are literally the same sound lmao
---
jagex are slowly removing stuff from NMZ over time as updates come out also no fuck castle wars
---
I got 5 masks in 3 tasks sub 80 slayer. Since then I’ve never gotten another one. 
---
I have no idea how sparc Mac has a fan base. He’s not terrible at the game but I cannot fucking stand his retarded ass voice.
---
Damn it's just my bad luck...my biggest goal currently is 99 farm and crafting..doing it a fairly average way without blowing 150m on each..doing hardwood trees, fruit trees and herbs I'm hoping that since 80-99 will take me roughly 60-70 days of just mostly tree runs and an occasional herb run that I'll get the farm pet which is my favorite pet of all time...if I get it sooner I'd be ecstatic..if I don't get it at all I'll be pretty bummed honestly...

Do runecraft
---
i fucking hate you so much 
---
Yeah but so many people treat it like the account is pointless once it dies. If you’re okay with playing ironman if you die then yeah it’s worth it, but if not then no it isn’t imo.
---
Thanks, without that comment I’d probably never tried it again.
---
Any updates, i need to know *blackmaskletics*
---
99 cooking; took about 6 days
---
Are..You.. CasuallyExplained?

Ffa or split?

Sorry I’m 400 kills in with two black masks now

Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?
---
&gt; could of

could have or could’ve 
---
Lol how's that bait taste? Correcting grammar is the easiest way to trigger idiots like you. You probably make that same mistake so you got pissed when you saw me make fun of it. Lolololol.

if you hate it then don’t do it??? no one is forcing you 
---
I feel like this really doesn't address the problems that runecrafting has.  The problem isn't just xp rates, its the xp rates combined with training methods being mind numbingly boring.  Also straight xp rate increases don't seem like good game balance and would never pass a poll.
---
Lol it took me 3.2k. I wanted to kill myself
---
I can’t fathom how that could possibly be a limitation in an engine. Unbelievable how terrible it is lol. 
---
customization should be allowed for everyone its stupid you cant

---
Mathematically speaking, it's basically *always* better than an Elysian, even if your Elysian procs 100%.
---
Is it overpowered? Not really. It's just up to 16% more efficient because Prayer is easier to restore than food, saving lots of inventory space. Given the cost of potions vs food, though, maybe that's not a big deal.
---
You can keep telling yourself that, but the high scores will say otherwise.
---
damn that's so fucking depressing, and due to his faulty internet connection. I'd much rather see him get obliterated doing theatre of blood than seeing him die to a DC. F
---
This game was the only, or first, instance of social media many of us had. We chopped logs because it was fun to hang out and talk with our friends. Now that's not as necessary.
---
But many high level gear still pass poll. What are you blabbering about people anti everything?
---
Ayiza was incompetent and hes gone now so no
---
This is the stuff I'm excited for. Love me some B0aty pking.
---
Game is too shit for players to die respectfully.  Yet another feelsbadman.  Que the harambe ‘heaven’ meme..
---
There were things like curses and summoning that made it a lot more effective
---
Do Runecrafting third
---
Did this work? I don't wanna go all the way there for it to be for nothing.
---
RS3 has a few super-rare drops in boss logs. In order to bypass having to get 1 of each, you simply get the cosmetic unlock by getting 1 out of the 4.
---
Sadly, they didn't do anything cosmetic-wise for clue scroll collection logs, but I assume the same system would be in place. 1 piece of 3a would complete it for that tier of clue.
---
ur dumb
---
It sucks because I have all the armor and halos from cwars on my account that was 1 def..now its 45 def and incredibly outclassed when one halo takes longer than a torso yet torso remains BIS even for 99 def in cases when you don't want to shell out money for Bcp
---
This guy is funny, so out of place because of all the noobs that spawns there. That's why I like him
---
It’s use is anywhere food is a limiting factor rather than prayer. So quite a few places 
---
So... why u have they stand in the shape of a swastica LOL
---
Op sold the alt lol, so I guess that's solved? What a retard lmao
---
Are you sure hes been sponsored? critical isnt the type of guy to give a fuck about money, didnt he give all his youtube earnings to charity
---
lmao, I'm at 415 pearls and still haven't gotten it &gt;:(
---
gz though
---
Haha that’s insane. Cheers.
---
It's a REALLY old engine. Can't really blame the mods.
---
Im not saying its low skill, read again
---
I said the skill is about navigating UI instead of having interesting mechanics
---
But last time they tried to add mechanics it was shit so better not

That's a very green clue
---
Ironmen work alone. You’re gonna have to make the insulin yourself bud.
---
Even after reading that you could get some crafting exp (very small) I still don't see why on earth anyone would do that seems like a waste of effort.

Why do you need 99 and why do you need it that fast

That's a good offer but I prefer this way for raids without deaths and a 100% fair split

That's what they said about squeel of fortune. 
---
Oh I'm sure they would, too. But that doesn't change the fact that he might not like doing that again. 2.1k hours of repeated content 3/4 times in a row doesn't sound fun.

If it makes you feel better, the curved bone could be used for Construction exp while Kree'arra is only for show (aka useless for efficiency).

I was thinking that too lol

Or maybe someone can make a tiny little overlay so that its a red helmet but maybe customize it so it wouldnt be just a normal red helm? Idk

Because they imply that it will work, without actually saying it will. 
---
Think of all those religious infomercial shows that say, “if you just donate “x” dollars, the lord will bless you and your troubles! But you have to plant the seed to sow the rewards, and the lord only requires 1,000 bucks to fix your ailments!”

It panders to gullible people who are too weak or to ignorant to question the science behind the method.

The problem with PvP vs PvM is that it’s just not balanced by the time someone wants to feel out PvP they’re probably level 60-80 and lo and behold that’s the range pures and other ridiculous account types are in that have nothing but a fat cash stack given to them by a main and optimized stats
---
In order to be effective in PvP you basically have to make a separate account for it because of the way jagex refuses to fix the defense leveling problem. 
---
When you want to try some content (PvP) and you get shat on instantly because some account gets their rocks off by running around with maxed gear and stats but an artificially deflated “cb level” it turns people off to the idea in general. 
---
That and brainlets who didn’t go that route so they run around with 50v1 dog piles ooo fun 
---
Regardless on what side of the table you sit you have to at least realize there’s a problem with the way players become antiquated with PvP do to “optimized accounts”
---
Switch the way defense levels you and range levels you and watch the tides change drastically

Raids 3: Temples of Zaros
---
Fride maybe, she was a pain in the ass for sure. To be honest, I actually first tried nameless king lol. It was sheer fucking luck though. I got EXTREMELY lucky to the point of comparing it to getting 5 twisted bows back to back to back. Midir wasnt to bad, honestly I dont think he was even the hardest dragon in ds3. 
---
Ds2 while it was the "b" version of the series, i still enjoyed. It was pretty easy though seeing how you could just soul geyser and be fucking OP (and farm millions of souls in minutes lol). 
---
O and S..fuck man they gave me aids. Lol ds1 was so great though. The remastered was awesome to play it again. 
---
Bborne i agree too. Ah man i love the souls series. I love rpgs with actual tactical difficulty and not just mechanic difficulty like most games are, osrs for the most part is mechanical since its very gear dependent/time consuming vs actual skill. Unless you are woox and do 1 item/1 pray/1 health pray flick bosses, thats fucking skill lol. 
---
Did you notice a sign infront of my house that says "dead bwaner storage?" 
---
Poor thing..
---
Maybe crystals are part of Seren in the same way bread is part of Jesus
---
Soloing is one thing, but not too many people do it.
---
Kree Arra doesn't drop pray pots. 99% of time you tele out because you run out of restores.
---
Bandos drops restores, but you still more often run out of prayer instead of hp. Usually your trip ends when boost potions have been used.
---
Zammy perhaps. Havent done that too much, but it's pretty dead content anyway so i'd doubt people invest hundreds of millions for a tank shield for Zammy, especually because the dfs has +7 str and aligned with arclight and slayer helmets accuracy increase makes a shitloads of more dps.

Oh, I thought you had to use it before you die to revert to normal iron. That's pretty dumb. At least they still have the option to play actual hc.

Did you miss the "Revitalizing Greenman's Ale" update?

wc is a much better version of mining

Considering how busy places like Bandos are at times, instances would likely crash prices of some items or at the very least cause a significant drop.

I mean, they didn't even poll adding a pub to Lumbridge, and it's still there... Might as well remove Hatius unpolled too, wouldn't be near as noticeable and it's really an outright nobrainer tbh, just like hiding poll results.

Thank you for being a part of D W D :) I'm just glad it still gives off the same vibes as it did when it was created years ago! Crazy to see how much it has flourished!

Damn, it's been awhile since I've seen this video. Thanks for making it osrs themed, never seen it like that before.

IMO just the same, i dont really care about the highscores i wanna see how far he can go without making a mistake
---
Seriously fucking vote yes, and on top of that I wouldn't even mind a buff to corp to null spec runs make it a real team boss again.
---
He never released the video he said he would after the huge giveaway. The world may never know.
---
He was super creative, always had awesome games/events to do with the community.
---
play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
&gt; Made hundreds of thousands of pounds for playing HCIM
---
&gt; playing HCIM is never worth it
---
????????????????
---
Hahaha that’s hilarious 
---
Also as an unofficial hardcore. Which is basically the game in a lotta peoples mind
---
Duo mage bandos is super chill 100+ kc trips.
---
True and I have in the past, but I just hate trouble brewing
---
nah
---
He's mentioned a few times that he doesn't actually feel like pking anymore. He even made a pure few months back and abandoned it.
---
why does staking gain money, with over 20k stakes it should average out to losing and winning half, and losing small and winning big is also random and should average out to him losing money now with the tax
---
Well since they didnt hide poll results yet we know your vote is meaningless
---
Sub only giveaways with the money he wins through staking is RWT. He does it daily and gets away with it. 
---
Well you do lose the account, but you can also buy a limited number of extra lives so it's not even "true" hardcore then.
---

Ive got 7 from catacombs task of dusties and 8 from another task but dont remember but got like 12 in a b2b2b2b wyrm tasks today(slayer cape effect, no cancling)
---
Yes yes yes
---
Thanks for the info, that looks sick. I'll keep it in mind for when I get there on my ironman.
---
Nope its the same as zero
---
The show is for everyone, so it is a free world!
---
I only want it if you have to consume an Elysian to make it 
---
The game senses your low iq and gives you easier challenges
---
This is a fairly common sentiment and more recent content has been trying to promote group oriented activities. Wintertodt (social even though it's not super group important) and volcanic mining are two newish examples, along with both sets of raids. But yeah I would love more group content.
---
No! Cause storing dead gnomes ain’t my fucking job man 
---
Read some comments above saying that he’d continue playing the account regardless. It’s such a shame he dies to a DC because of how... anticlimatic it is? A TOB death would’ve been his own mistake, but a DC is just out of his hands. HCIM mode sucks :/
---
I DON’T have weapons grade autism... but I suddenly have the urge to employ my 10-year old little cousin for this task...🤔

Oh no my armor that only requires 42 defense isn't the best in the game!! Waahhhh

Osrs is not close to dieing 😂
---
"In other words, the Divine Shield is 15.6% more efficient in terms of inventory space because it is easier to restore Prayer than it is to restore Hitpoints. In addition, Prayer points are restored incidentally as a result of restoring Hitpoints."
---
Except its not. Anywhere in the current game you'd use an ely/divine, prayer is far more valuable than healing, because of non inventory related healing. (BP/SGS specs, bones to peach tabs, blood barrage, food drops). 
---
Prayer is the bottleneck, not hp. 
---
You just found about this in the other thread https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ar2hao/preserving_game_integrity/egkxpr2/

Slippery slope
---
He was kicked out of a clan etc. So there were certain people that had a grudge against him.
---
But seeing how he deleted his post I think it's fair to say this was real
---
Just git gud lmao
---
Coastline-always-visible UIM to make sure he doesn't miss any potential whale sightings

---
More ezscape coming our way 
---
they hate us 'cause they anus
---
There are more skip question votes than  no votes. Just proves how pointless this is
---
I guess the guard has a certain area where he is able to walk. However, he is able to see the players who steal beyond that said area. Then the guard starts to "lag" and tries to lure the player to  his reach by walking backwards, like some monsters do if you try to range/mage them from too far away. Dunno, just a guess.
---
Why are people so freaking attached to the wilderness wall 
---
We make memes about them all the time. We are both immature about it. I wish we could be the bigger community and just ignore them and not meme and talk crap about them. We play our game and they play their game. 
---
Although, that's interesting regardless. I didn't know they actually meme'd us that hard tbh. 
---
Hahahahahahahahahahah 
---
that was a long time ago, the general osrs community has gone to shit since then so it will pass lmao
---
People are stupid and ignorant. 
---
As a casual RuneScape player, I have no idea what this string of characters means
---
[You’re](https://goo.gl/images/xC1D3N)

I voted yes to the original one, but no to this because I don't want the UI to behave differently in different areas. Bad UI is one thing, but inconsistent UI is even worse.
---
Hey its me your friend
---
Yea but most places aren't "gated" due to lack of having hitpoints.
---
Most places like GWD, DKS, slayer bosses, etc. are gated by prayer points. Divine would have it's uses (imo) but at a high level PVM pretty much the reason to leave a boss room is because you ran out of prayer. 
---
Try to claim any double exp, youtube giveaways, see why your favorite streamer is "quitting"? 
---
Buy an electric coffee grinder
---
Congrats!
---
The videos themselves were fine, but the titles were cancer for me. Every time they made me question whether I had a stroke or just forgot how to speak EnglisH.
---
You could make all mobs unaggro when the server drops. Quick fix. Don't act like there is no solution. 
---
The game needs more godwars style bosses, less zulrah and vorkath. 
---
Honestly the divine would wreck you, it would simply make it much harder to wreck the opponent. 
---
The guy who made the post is literally rank 1 with over 2b xp
---
You use 3rd party client or original?
---
It was his internet that crashed though, not the servers.
---
It passed via a confusing question where lots of people accidentally voted incorrectly. Because the question was confusing it was repolled in the form of "Should we NOT add the spell book resizing". Because the second poll was worded negatively, it only required 25% of people to want the update for it to be added. It was finally polled correctly and failed, now it's being polled again and it's failing even harder. Seems like people just never actually wanted it. 
---
runecrafting bad
---
Comparing a divine to an ely is like comparing an sgs to an ags. U clearly have to idea what ur telling about. I bet u never even had an ely on osrs.
---
was nerfed cause a mod wanted to introduce another quest to the Fremmy quest line that would give a helmet the +5 (or more cant remember) that the serp orginally had
---
I don’t understand the screenshot complaints. The man is sharing what he wanted to share. He said what he wanted to say. Let these people live. Lol 
---
It's only 28 slots, if you think that's too much than might as well get rid of hidey-holes, pouches, and anything else that can store items.
---
This would actually be pretty cool
---
Okay, then I guess we’re mostly in agreement. And I appreciate you clarifying your distinction between PvPer and Pker, since I consider myself a Pker (as in one who participates in Player Killing) but i only Pk on BH worlds, PvP worlds, or PvP hotspots, all against other PvPers (no honor bridding, high risk pking, etc), not against nakeds.
---
Also, the people who are vocalizing that PvP is dying and also saying they’re gonna vote no to certain updates, they are the vocal minority, and in no way represent the PvP community. Majority of the PvP community are completely silent from social media and, are in fact, in the game enjoying some PvP. They have no reason to speak up because they’re having fun in game, which leads to a vocal minority creating a biased image for the entirety of the community, which I find unfair. Especially when it’s getting to the point where I can no longer tell if the average player is able to distinguish between what the actual majority of PvPers feel relative to the vocal minority who are loud and obnoxious and toxic.
---
Karils with a dfs and anguish kept upgrading as I went on.
---
gonna vote yes, is poll out already? on prigress of making f2p pure (training in p2p) and i could vote yes to it.
---
&gt; There's certainly not hundreds of posts about spite voting just over the icons. 
---
I didn't say that. I meant in general.
---
Isn't it not major in barraging slayer? Only +3 prayer and +20 mage. You get +10 from ancient book and +5 prayer and I thought most barrage slayer tasks/all were 0 mage defence. 
---
No, I'm a grumpy old man about pretty much everything 
---
No, it shouldn’t be “let’s see how long we last until our connection kills us”, it should be “let’s see how long we can last because of our skill and caution”.
---
Of course it isn’t viable to plan on never disconnecting, since even if Jagex has perfect servers your provider may drop. That’s why I’d just never take HCIM seriously, personally. No point in trying to preserve something that can be taken away from me because of outside powers.
---
Top 5 worst quests? 
---
I’m not sure if this is the place for that mate. You need to contact Jagex support. Or try get a mods attention on twitter. 
---
those 50 years from now.  
---
there support sucks and i can't find anything
---
well if actually knew anything, corporal was originally locked behind quests, that had "actual" law behind it. Not hard for them to make a quest that locks it as a drop. even if it was a new boss that had relations to corp
---
&gt;Also, the people who are vocalizing that PvP is dying and also saying they’re gonna vote no to certain updates, they are the vocal minority, and in no way represent the PvP community.
---
Right, I understand that. You can't really "represent" a community like that. PvPers aren't a monolith.
---
&gt; Majority of the PvP community are completely silent from social media and, are in fact, in the game enjoying some PvP. They have no reason to speak up because they’re having fun in game, which leads to a vocal minority creating a biased image for the entirety of the community, which I find unfair. 
---
Which is why when I say "PvPers," I'm referring the ones that actually speak up about things. I apologize if that was not clear.
---
Given the nature of the joke I was trying to make, it wouldn't be as funny to say **Some very loud vocal minority of PvPers** each time.
---
Nice cat
---
He does walk around, though just about in front of the church.
---
Mainly because they’d probably vote no or some shit lol
---
Did you never see the tons of warped tortoise bots in rs2? Those are quest and slayer locked and were still botted frequently
---
Yeah Jagex is awful at this kinda stuff unfortunately. Go on the website go on account recovery, see if you can answer all the question. If accepted the account will be locked until the account is safe.
---
Not really because he did die so he has a grey helmet now
---
Me like magic rock make skill. 
---
Spending 3 moons to lift level by 1 good! 
---
Change magic rock make bad! me will get less berries and dat is only thing make magic rock make worth do. 
---
I can't think of any at the top of my head, but it would be any quest that intentionally gives you the option to fuck up for trying to think outside of the box, adding a ton of extra time onto the quest. Also any quest that has cheap high-damage marks for something stupid like agility, despite being high agility. (Mourning's End Part 2 was super fun for me until the very last time I needed to use the handholds... I failed it 7 times in a row.)
---
I didn’t know he even existed until this poll.
---
Pretty much. The damage dealt to your Prayer is actually not that substantial. It's only 15% of the damage you take, which in the grand scheme of things is not very much.
---
The benefit the Divine Spirit Shield seems to offer is that it lets you bring less food in place of other supplies. In situations where that is useful, the Divine Shield is just better than the Elysian Spirit Shield, and yeah, the Holy Wrench doesn't play into that.
---
Did that really happen? Mind...blown!
---
I have not once heard anyone asked for the divine to be polled yet again yet now people are in favor of it apparently. Blatant contrarianism.
---
Jagex fucked up by not displaying this model that shows the differences. I’d imagine most people don’t even know what this trash looks like on female models because most characters are male and the helmet isn’t used that frequently 
---
Loot from being retarded and not knowing how to take a screenshot. 
---
no1 cares kid, go back to your room 
---
Ah yes, we really need to drive up that price of prayer pots and super restores even more.
---
If you mean the dev tools you can't change your ironman icon with that afaik, he just used the widget inspector tool while working on that plugin. 
---
You're the one who got mad for being called out on hypocrisy. Retard lmao
---
No 'memers' are original regardless of where they're really from imo. It takes 1 person to create something and millions to regurgitate. 
---
Hope so, very close at the moment though. 
---
Gudi showed that some streamer pranked his viewers that he was first person in osrs to receive their hcim status back in the same video. 
---
wow, yeah he would totally go homeless and go from $30k a month to $20k.
---
Lol nothing you said made sense. Fanboy
---
do you realize how few hcim have tob gear? lol
---
runescapers have autism
---
Uhm my note 9 and all the android phones i used before this all suported mouse, either by otg or bleuthooth what ancient tablet are you using?
---
All the time? You sure about that or are you confusing the year with 2015? Rs3 is irrelevant at this point, hardly see people even knocking it 
---
Agreed. They should have added an image attachment to the poll question exactly because of that. 
---
This. Much this 
---
I think he's talking about himself lmao
---
f it's not dragon, a free player wont know what it is
---
Hmm I think it’s called democracy, just because you think one way doesn’t mean everyone else does. Clearly your in the minority. Twice. So sit down. 
---
Yeah he's gonna die to maiden right away 
---
I agree. Plus the fact that there are already so many top tier items in the game that cost a fortune, I think it's time skills took priority in updates. Just my opinion and not everyone should or will agree and I respect that :) 
---
swampletics good
---
I'd really like some more Poh content, dwarf in the mine for Amethyst is teasing me that we humans suck at Construction.
---
Seeing some Dwarven Construction stuff, Dwarven quests expansions, and Amethyst construction please!  Like Dwarven underground house  with stone walls etc.

just wondering, what do skip votes actually do? are they a no vote? are they a 'dont count this vote' option?
---
they make it kinda hard to see if a poll is passing or not
---
I personally remember pre-eoc having way more overpowered PvP items. Chaotic rapier on everyone, the titans and pak yak, Handcannon oneshotting you, swift gloves, people ragging with goliath gloves and turmoil/soul split, korasi hit ridiculous in single combat areas. I remember one guy would sit in edge with max tank gear and overheads farcasting storm of armadyl on me and it was extremely annoying, you couldn't even fight back.
---
Damn you're a bad troll if you think calling me a fanboy makes you at all seem like you know what you're saying rofl 
---
what was your latest A1C?
---
Magic carpet/genie origin quest reward?
---
71% is far from minority stupid boy 😂 sit down 
---
Yeh that's relatively normal then. OSRS would be the same if the server issues years back weren't so elongated and bad that it became the accepted norm to have graves essentially.
---
Just saying but yk you can already negate all damage from a boss without the cost of a prayer point (1t flicking)...
---
Yet people are STILL voting no on resizing spell icons EXCLUDING PVP AREAS YOU MORONS

“Sit down you lost the argument”
---
Doesn’t provide any support to their argument.
---
it only changes to green at 10m 
---
I thought I saw something about a new Skilling boss that would involve things like mining and runecrafting, but can't seem to find anything on it.  Was I dreaming?
---
WEED
---
Going by the intervals at which he is gaining xp on Crystalmathlabs, this is definitely the case. I don't know how one would go about doing that though. 
---
I think that new content has been overly rewarding. Design-wise, Cerberus is fantastic. The highs will drastically outweigh any of the lows you get over time (primordial vs unholy symbol, etc) New content doesn’t 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘥 to be the best everytime. I’d like to see more drop tables like Cerb’s in the future. 
---
Look for the word minority. It's not hard 
---
Yea it's just the way of the game though. I got DC'ed mid 80s cb. Next HC was a skiller, really the only way I could do it again. Great way to skill tbh, you rise up the rankings quick and occasionally some top ranks die.
---
How is making the poll fail considered losing the argument? You’re actually retarded
---
If u want bleed effects go to rs3
---
Hi A_Dawg25!
---
Isn't this Divine nerfed, it smites you for 50% instead of the 6% from rs2
---
Except that method usually implies gear setups, and I don't recall every combat STYLE having only one setup in the game
---
:thinking:
---
:D
---
Hi OsrsJohnC!
---
1 in 25 for eclectic. 
---
Isn't the polled Divine a nerfed version of the original
---
You could limit the instances similar to how its done with gargoyle boss i think.
---
Because as a hardcore you'll inevitably start doing stuff that slows you down a bunch to try and preserve that status even though you know it'll be gone to some bullshit at some point.
---
That's why I didn't make a hardcore and just went straight for the grey helm.
---
75 RC would be the hardest quest requirement in the game by far.
---
A
---
U stupid retard. He said 71 percent is the minority. It clearly isnt. There I spelled it out to you dumbas brainlet 
---
No worries, they put the word out heavily when they made the change but it's quite hard for newcomers to know
---
then you can just plug the ethernet cable when you are in a sticky situation and say you DC'd...
---
yes, people would actually do that
---
A Spade is a multi-functional tool in RuneScape. One of its major uses is in the Farming skill, though it also comes in handy on many quests and Treasure trails (clues). They are sold in farming shops and an infinite supply can be gained in your house by making a Tool store 2 at 25 Construction. Alternatively, they can be derived from a Rogue kit.
---
Must be hell working for Jagex. Got the most stupid player base out of all the MMO's, but also the most loyal playerbase who pay up that sweet 11$ each month. 
---
Poor devs

I love how you edited your answer after I pointed it out. Biggest brainlet I’ve ever seen. 
---
Too bad you and the other 9 people didn’t get the joke.

Yeah but in rs3 is that the way to nex stronghold?

Why would you use WiFi for gaming? That's never been a good idea... 
---
Who hurt you this bad?...
---
That is the actual sea shanty music sheet
---
Ironman made him lmao
---
It's probably not the game itself that is the problem. I mean, people are flooding to play fucking Fishing Trawler just because of dat Angler. If Castle Wars had something similar, it would get way more traffic.
---
Might be bc of divine spirit shield
---
Hatius is a good boy who has done no wrong.
---
This and the spell icon resizing why are there so many brainlets allowed to vote??
---
I said "teleport", so it acting like every other teleport in the game wasn't really a stretch, was it.
---
Don’t think you understood what I meant. If prayer reordering becomes official but NOT in the wilderness, how do you think Jagex might feel about a plug-in offering that within the wilderness? Aside from that, having your prayers reordered as soon as you hop the ditch would be retarded. 
---
Still annoyed at that mother for not watching her kid. Poor harambwan.
---
It's obvious that there is one group on the OS team that only cares about short term player satisfaction and another part that cares about long term game integrity. Mod Kieren said he wanted a boss' drop table to be just like cerberus and GWD once before the hydra's release and another time after. Yet, they don't care at all about revs, vorkath, hydra, zulrah, konar's drop table and whatever else.
---
My guess is that there are higher ups that are dumb cunts that only care about pulling in new players with shiny new updates, no matter the long term effect. That would also explain why they haven't addressed or just out right banned 3rd party clients.
---
If you want to compete for kills you're gonna want a z spear and crystal hally. Always a bit of a risk running with new people they could walk on a split
---
#MRS. OBWANA GET DOWN
---
Zulrah is easy asf dude what are you on about, my kc is 261
---
The only hard thing is first getting into the boss but after that you should be good lol

He is Disneyscape

Are you a white supremacist or just edgy?

---
my autistic ass was trying to figure what latency has to do with anything
---
See this is a reasonable arguement against it instead of bitching about muh skillgap. I've never thought about it from that point
---
Could never pass, unfortunately. Too many players feel entitled to rewards &amp; convenience.
---
Gave dragon halberd a try , got like 42/47 spec first phase so did it pretty fast ^^
---
Splitting mechanics like that is terrible game design. It isn't healthy for the game. 
---
coles is better.
---
boaty died to his own internet btw
---
Yes! Id love to.
---
Why is the gmaul there lol
---
out of the loop, haven't played in a while. is there really a dock there and if so, why?
---
Or just a grinder?
---
so youre doing this out of spite cus hes better than u? 
---
Making an icon bigger and using aimbot is a world of a difference.
---
But sure, you use aimbot in fps and I use an equally advantageous script, like a tick-swap macro, auto pray-switching and auto combo-eating.
---
Because that's a valid comparison. Aim is the majority skill in an FPS. Being able to click one small spell icon isn't in RS. There are PK clients out there which do this feature anyway, so the argument is brainlet.
---
Making the spell icons bigger is comparable to when a guy made CS buy menu work with hotkeys. Guess what didn't destroy the game meta: being able to buy without breaking your wrist.
---
I got about 18k pess from 70 range grind just safespotted with darts 
---
then by definition, it would no longer be the best internet :)
---
He’s baiting mate. It’s obvious lol.
---
Overpowered things are offset by their costs people are fine with a tbow why not this shield?
---
&gt; 90% of the hcim deaths, i doubt most dc's are on their end
---
wasn't both of boaty's deaths on his end?
---

Tbh the only situation it could even be considered a little OP at, is situations where you don't care how many supplies you waste, you just want to survive, or situations where SGS/blood barrage hp regeneration isn't an option (I guess it would be really good for solo ToB, even though that's less efficient than trios and is just a challenge for fun, so a very niche situation lol). It sucks for any long-lasting PvM trips where you use SGS/blood barrage/bones to peaches, and sucks anywhere where you'd rather have dps with arcane/avernic. So basically in most situations it would be useless, it'd be even more niche than the ely.

In a way it makes it both better and worse I suppose

Ironman btw 
---
Which means you're risking bank in pvp, which is good.
---
 D 
---
I read it as 71% had voted against the change. 
---
yeah that is why I created the suggestion cuz crashing them is hella fun.
---
Come play FPS, bring an aimbot.
---
Then I'll bring a PK client which already features increased spell sizes (I don't know how this part is just magically ignored by all you brainlets).
---
We'd see the results ;)
---
Fuck off, cunt.
---
Lucky.. my record is 1:22 in max gear except for cape and gloves, and I can't get lucky with the d Hally specs!
---
Cons of being 75 93 75 😢
---
Tell the autistic community to vote in more gear then
---
Gonna vote no just because of Reddit cx
---
Oh and let's make the heads twice the size in csgo to make it more accessible for new players. This logic is crazy. 
---
I bet you aren't posting this at vote no posts, as it seems you are opposed and will only express your hate against people that vote yes. People can vote whatever they want, this is just a push in the right direction.
---
Support 100% 
---
I still say that the amount of accounts that actively PVP are very much the minority several times over. Check the population of DMM/bounty/PVP worlds combined at any time in relation to the sum of all other worlds.
---
Right now it is 1.2k vs 76k. That is less than 2% of the players. Add in all the people in the wilderness on normal worlds &amp; the people training up their stats for pking and I doubt that number will budge with much significance. 
---
Jagex listens to the loudest voices, not necessarily the most popular.
---
See the sandstone update that passed with 84%  not being implemented.
---
Pls give me one example where range was meant to be shit but BP was super OP.
---
Only bosses that need tanking are gwd. In those health is never a problem. Prayer is. Making divine bad at even the only places it could possibly be good at.

Cus I’m shit at photoshop and just changed the hue lmao

Hmmm
---
Xp is not linear. It's closer to 700 xp per lamp
---
This was said in the very beginning with zulrah but they just wouldn't listen . Zulrah ruined so many items and killed lots of skilling content 
---
Sometimes I forget casual ironman is equally viable
---
You don’t have to do diaries iirc, it’s just total level and gold. 
---
Divine is not power creep you fucking retards
---
I’ll post it at anyone who tells me or others what we should do and what to vote for. Especially if they state that you’re stupid or whatever for having a differing opinion. Especially as you seem to think that your opinion is “the right direction”. 
---
You’ll actually find that I don’t care too much either way as OSRS is to me mainly for wasting time at work and something that is BIS like that and will cost the projected amount is out of my reach. Hence why I skipped it. 
---
Just saying. Let’s just listen to you though, as the bringer of all knowledge who knows what is and isn’t the “right direction”. 
---
How I feel bout the prayer reorder question failing when this community uses RL/OSB which offers it.
---
I get annoyed when it happens, but would be pretty rich of me to talk shit since i did the same 2 runs ago.
---
You’re a retard
---
Good thing he had the scimmy to beat back all the ladies.
---
bandos
---
I don’t know why Jagex doesn’t mute people for this. It’s the most extreme offensive language in my opinion. I don’t know what you guys do in the UK but saying this word in the US will get the shit kicked out of you. 
---
People say stuff like this so commonly in OSRS. It’s tasteless and most of them do it for attention. I don’t know why it’s allowed.
---
That scimmy looks awesome!
---
The PKing client argument is ignored because it's against the rules. The aimbot argument assumes that it's legally implemented by the devs themselves, dumbass.
---
Stop talking to me, noob.
---
It's not kept in the bank he holds it for you now.
---
yeah it's available for everyone
---
Its still the top result for some less common google searches over the new one.
---
I think this is very fair, seeing as avoiding power creep through the addition of new items is looking more and more to be something of a lost cause. The main downside would be confusion for new players, because they'd basically have to research on the wiki to see which items are and are not allowed for any particular boss.
---
However, this discussion is doomed to be purely hypothetical, as any change which makes the game more difficult will never pass a poll, and one can hardly expect the jmods to want to pass an "integrity update" that potentially invalidates a great deal of their future work.
---
You don't use supplies to restore hp in inferno you sgs spec and blood barrage.
---
If it's a quest that unlocks new RC methods and uses RC as a requirement, I actually agree. I just hate the quests that unlock good content for one aspect of the game but requiring other skills to complete it. For example a new PvM boss unlocked after DSII requires 68 Mining and 70 Smithing. I think that's a dumb concept.
---
If they release a new skilling boss for example, I also don't want it locked behind a boss fight which you would need 75+combat stats and good gear to complete.
---
Shut. Up.
---
Dragon defender looks awful. I’m glad this finally came up. 
---
Still ignore the argument that you claim that the size of the spell being changed is as much crutch as an aimbot in FPS.
---
Yet you yourself said you are bad at FPS...
---
Makes one think...
---
Not the same

u shouldnt see it anywhere, theres a better variant called the inferno cape, if u have a max fcape u should and will get mocked about it, cause ur literally trash :)

It was definitely overrated

For the scale: if you use a monitor with high res or something, try a runelite plugin named "stretched mode". It basically makes the UI bigger. Mind you it's literally scaled, so it's a little low res.
---
Unorganized jagex will let you know a week before it happens
---
What was the method and is there a video? 
---
Yet people voting yes with no osrs pvp experience have no idea how ABSURD max teams already are with camping elys; divine only makes them that much more invincible. Actually invincible. If you're bringing that much risk; there *should* be a chance of dying, with an ely that would be the hits 70% chance of doing the full damage -- with the divine; that chance is 0%.
---
and grind your weed to dust? sure

No they’ll just blame you for not have an Authenticator and say tough luck you can speak the ban tho also change everything and get an Authenticator

Wait, do people really prefer the new wiki to the old one?
---
The old one often times had more information than the same page on the new wiki.
---
I'd look for examples, but obviously the old one is broken right now.
---
Jagex won't ever reimburse you for getting hacked you can appeal the mute tho I believe usually mutes don't last long so you could be unmuted before they even respond to your appeal against it
---
Revoke lolwhat. But nobody should get their status back no matter who they are. 
---
Coincidence that he seems to only DC at end-endgame content 
---
Why not?
---
The only two issues are that it stopped getting updated recently for some reason, and that the site is currently broken.
---
What does the new wiki do that the old wiki didn't?
---
Thanks for this dude. Absolute star
---
I wouldn’t say that osrs will shut down in 5 years but a lot of thing can happen from now till then. The economy could be shot but I don’t think that it will be shut down. I’ve been playing again for a year now, on and off my whole life. This is easily one of my favorite games of all time. I would truly be upset if the game shut down in 5 years because I’ve invested so much time in the last year that I would be devastated. 
---
tysm &lt;3
---
Go out in singles pvp with a 7 restore setup, bring a divine.
---
Not only does this make you completely un-killable; but you'll actually last longer in tanking as well.
---
Absolutely clueless if you're supporting it. It doesn't matter if its not entirely useful in PvM; one must think of both sides of the game.
---
stop being a pleb
---
Because it first came out like 14 years ago and farming as well as the whole game was a little different
---
Yes. Sounds like fair progression over the course of six years. Nerf bp and scythe and we gucci.

---
Bullshit game, they need to reinstate HC’s if they die due to dcs or glitches
---
Step 1: Go to the front page of 2007scape, the one with 20 or so links 
---
Step 2:  Don't click on this one
---
Hope that helps
---
you look like dogshit.
---
Let's assume that your 10-15% figure is correct. Let's also assume that every single one of that 10-15% of pvp'ers that voted ALL voted no. 
---
That is still less than HALF of the no votes.
---
I think it is much more likely that the PVM community is swaying this poll more than PVPers, especially since this poll only affects non PVP areas.
---
If you want to see what spite voting is, look at the PVP polls.
---
All it needs is some NaCl and it will be complete
---
Probably because the question is phrased poorly. "Replaced with a barrier" makes it sound like it would be this big glowing magical thing instead of the ditch. They should've phrased it more like: "Should we remove the wilderness ditch? You would still receive a warning when entering the wilderness which can be toggled off at the Doomsayer in Lumbridge." Mentioning a barrier may be more correct on a technical level, but it doesn't properly convey the change they wanted to make, it only serves to confuse. 
---
OOF
---
50/50
---
That makes literally 0 sense since when we worked we used a complete copy from October 2nd and incredibly few edits have been made to the old site since the fork. Just to be clear, the new wiki is oldschool.runescape.wiki, not the site with a fandom domain. 
---
Please don't spread misinformation. 
---
His example will probably consist of a QoL change.

Apm doesnt matter? So being able to 1tick an 8way switch doesnt give you an edge vs an opponent? Because im pretty sure it does.

I agree I was watching the Ge tracker last night and thought the fucking site was blowing up. What the shit is going on with that thing right now lol 
---
You could just buy comics from mage arena shop it's really cheap there atleast what I did.. I don't plan to do any racing until lvl 50 anyways, quests and tears of guthix when atleast to 59 zmi probably will end up going to 75/77 zmi 😂

Just emptied my slay tab so got about 5.5m in cash which isn't doing anything at the minute so not sure what's worth getting next.

Currently have torso, fcape, bgloves, slay helm (I), b ring, fury, whip, d boots and Torag's legs. Thinking a cannon for slay or a blowpipe but I haven't tried bossing yet so not sure I'd use blowpipe much. Any other items worth considering at this point? Also is there a list of items that aren't bis but are useful until you can get bis stuff?

It only takes like .5secs to turn off your router assuming you prepared and had your hand on it. Sadly, the rule is there to prevent shit like that.

Primarily because testimonials are not medical claims.

Ten people saying "this cured my cancer" is NOT a claim.

Wish there was some way jagex could deter spite voting.

---
If this poll fails, I guarantee some PVMers will rage vote no on the next PVP poll because of the small percentage it's looking like this poll will fail by. One of the highest upvoted posts in this subreddit yesterday was a meme about voting no to PVP polls.
---
In the last PVP poll, the highest "yes" vote was 36%. 
---
I could only imagine the uproar if a PVM poll was destroyed that hard.

Hahahahha what the fuck dude

Btw btw?

Is this what is considered hate speech nowadays..? Damn. I mean, darn.

I don't know why they chose Salem specifically, maybe it was epicentre of witch trials in America?

It's a valuable lesson to teach people not to kill people for doing things you don't like/understand, perhaps it made more impact being a relatively close to home example.

The amount of autism required to type these 12 characters in sequence absolutely astounds me. 
---
Is there any plugin for runellite that measures your average kill time for a boss?
---
They moved to rimmington 
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/205981571-Refunds
---
And Slayer masters straight up tell you to kill Elves. 
---
Don't think about it too much; you'll wrinkle.
---
And they wonder why PvMers and skillers vote no to spite them on PvP polls. 🤔 
---
He definitely PKs on his main. 
---
Can you post a pic here of the turnout for the event?

Would you like to know more?
---
people who voted yes just hate us cuz they anus
---
the idea is to set up your do/skip/block tasks in such a way that you will gain in the long run. If you run out you’ll get stuck doing some pretty shit tasks 
---
I think you misunderstand what I'm suggesting. What I'm suggesting is that when someone disconnects, the server can notice and teleport you, using your ring of life charge. I'm not suggesting disconnects to stop from happening here, I'm suggesting a measure to keep the account safe when it does happen. 
---
Haha.
---
They should totally do this for April Fools for a day.
---
????  
---
You're not giving any examples.  
---
I've been playing since OSRS launched lmao.
---
I don’t understand why something like this has to be polled in the first place.
---
if you have twitch prime they're giving away 14 mem days for the valentines day reward, just letting you know incase you have it. 
---
The real question is why do we need another tank shield when ely barely gets any use as it is? If Jagex feels corp needs another drop then come up with something unique instead of just dipping into the pool of items from the old game.
---
It was 1250 kc before I got my first zenyte.. I also had 2 heavy frames, 1 tail, and multiples off all other drops (totaling 13 non-zenyte drops) before I got my first zenyte :( 
---
Those people are degenerates and deserve it. Imagine getting lured in 2019, that's on the same level of absolute idiocy than falling for nigerian prince scams lmfao.
---
How do you pray flick/is there a good guide for it? Runelite has a plugin that's supposed to help but I don't really understand what it's guiding me to do
---
you shouldn't report on this game. 
---
Bruh. A content creator needs to revive this, that's pretty much the only music I listened to while playing RS back in the day
---
I see.
---
not you, him.
---
You’re taking the meme far too seriously. That behavior you’re talking about isn’t based in reality. If it exists AT ALL, it’s probably 12 year olds.
---
Like wut? I thought we all knew this was a joke. Hahah
---
Harvesting the spines etc? Or planting them 
---
on the poll it says 100% chance to reduce 30% damage while draining prayer. 
---
No u
---
How is range meant to be shit there? He has identical defensive stats for both melee and range. The reason range was shit there is pre-blowpipe melee weapons just straight up had significantly higher dps than ranged weapons
---
Chance to take damage when crushing 
---
Just attack and kill 1 at a time the other wont teleport you unmess you've hit them.
---
Imagine caring this much. I’ve got shit to do. 
---
It didn't pass because people don't want this shit split up between PvP and non-PvP.
---
mice aren't supported yet
---
I thinking something like cutting tree, cooking a fish, smithing a platebody is more easier than following a quest guide
---
Gross, no. 
---
Sounds like you need to quit and find a new game.  I'd suggest Hello Kitty's Online Island Adventure.
---
WeDoRaids
---
If you're going to make drop tables shit out items every kill then the boss need a high barrier of entry in terms of requirements and mechanical skill so it can't be solo farmed by every pleb. Blowpipe is a tbow tier item yet it's worthless and everybody has one because zulrah is so easy.
---
lol did you bother to google at all? 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Game_Integrity_updates
---
I'm not really someone that is for pking. 
---
However, if they make runelite take out the future than they are just shoving the pkers faces in the dirt.
---
Agreed this dude's music is ass.
---
Either way, lets be honest. With the question worded like that, there was no way this wouldn't pass. 
---
Oh shit I remember this, the Gower brothers set him a challenge that was kind of akin to UIM iirc?
---
So? 
---
Implying killing someone you randomly come across is 100% just inconveniencing them with no chance for a drop. Assuming you are in no gear, you could easily be doing something like the Ironman from the OP picture and be risking a few 100k for an easy 10 second kill. Why wouldn’t I kill you? And it’s so easy to log out when a white dot shows up on your minimap that it shouldn’t ever be an issue if you don’t want to get killed 
---
Problem with that specifically in the Vorkath example is that it doesn't have anything good enough on its droptable to consider it being worthwhile.
---
&gt;so sick of these shitty analogies
---
&gt;If you get mugged at night you're still allowed to be pissed off at the mugger.
---
HAHAHAH
---
imagine voting no to armadyl cbow rework when its currently just a recolored hunter crossbow
---
I would have been like listen 100 mil if you dont kill me. And if didnt want that then fuck him anyway
---
What do the J-Mod's feel about of Poll influencing by popular Streamers and Youtubers, or Clans/Groups?
---
And what kind of steps is Jagex taking to prevent the form of an poll manipulation?
---
(These Questions aren't directed to any specific group, or individual, other than Jagex themselves, of course.)
---
Already did.
---
What is BTW in osrs context?
---
When I was like 22 I'd only drink home and alone. Not cause I was lonely and depressed, but so this exact scenario wouldn't happen.
---
Your post history brings me life
---
What about Samsung smart fridges?
---
I have absolutely no idea what the issue with the ditch is, every time I've thought of it for the past few years never been able to come up with a good reason.
---
No.
---
I literally did in my first comment you dumbfuck lmao.
---
Theyre just like jad. Most of the times its a one hit mechanic but there are cases you survive them
---
To be honest, that is the exact reason i like him. Seeing people get angry by him just standing there is kind of perfect haha. 
---
Every single poll is failing except for the last 3. Defender recolor, Prayer Skill Guide updated to show actual prayer icons, and special attack orb being clickable to spec.
---
Stop  👏  using 👏  the 👏  old 👏  wiki 👏  
---
I like this but it has to be 2 powder to 1 molten glass ratio to stop infinite loop, could also have it scale to crafting level so it is infinite at 99.
---
I love that flair lmao.
---
Countdown, woolworths same thing different country. unless your american who probably thinks its fahrenheit.
---
Most of the time i get mad cus its just a waste of time, idc about the loot id lvoe to pay each pker that attacks me 500k to fuck off. its just the time waste thats unbearably annoying, no1 gets anything out of it
---
Kyllä muakin pelottaisi rekallinen tollasia. Varsinkin sivilisaation ulkopuolella.
---
How about uim get white:btwbtwbtwbtwbtw
---
Well luckily for you this question passed
---
Reading comprehension much? I literally said ironmen type gameplay has been around and popular since before runescape even existed, in other mmos and games like diablo 1. B0aty did not popularize a mode that existed years before runescape was even devious mud.
---
Why wasn't anyone complaining about gun control until right after a mass shooting? Because relevant current events spark related discussions.
---
At first I thought u we're just testing at him but now I see you're just a jerk. Grow up loser.
---
I always read it as hashus consayshus, never thought to sound it out
---
It's like on private servers whenver you examine something and it just says "It's a \_\_\_"
---
They are mostly failing across the board. This one, prayer icons in guide, and clicking spec orb to special are passing. Others all fail. Idk how divine has 70% but it does lol
---
Personally, as an admin on both the RS and OSRS wikis (and have been since when we were still on Wikia), I think that it’s fair to encourage others to use the new sites.
---
However, there’s a definite boundary to this, and I don’t think being derogatory towards anyone who doesn’t use the new wiki is the right idea. In my opinion, encouraging people to move over in a nice way will be received a lot better than being all ‘use the new wiki stupid idiot’.
---
It’s clear that there’s definitely more benefit in moving over, and for the most part people understand this but they just aren’t aware of the new wiki. I know that’s sometimes down to Google results, but we are working on this and I hope this is noticeable in results recently.
---
We’re the same community of editors that maintained the old wiki, and I think once those who encourage others to move over explain that, and explain the underlying issues that we covered in our initial announcement about it, people who might be seemingly hostile towards the new wiki will understand.
---
We hope most people have a better experience on the new wiki overall, because even if you used Wikia with an adblocker and thus didn’t feel the effects of the major ad problem the site has, we try hard to add unique features like dark mode and other quality of life changes (checklists for quick guides, for example) that are noticeable. I hope that this better experience is a enough influence alone in encouraging people who might be a little too used to Wikia to move over.
---
This has taken me a few years of very casual playing. Shout out to OSRS for being the most relaxing game ever. It has helped me through college/work related stress.
---
Ah, M'lord Monkletics
---
How come jagex can roll back KempQ Ironman hp level back to 10 but can’t give boaty his hardcore status back...
---
Mobile users voted yes 
---
Okay. So we should setup special attack to a hotekey. Or eating food can just a hotkey as well. That wouldn’t compromise the PVP skillcap at all.
---
Oh thank god we will keep consantius :) i voted no myself
---
I've had it with these gamebreaking suggestions for the sake of improving Ironman mode. You CHOSE to limit yourself, now deal with the consequences. Nobody is FORCING you to play Ironman. SMH, snowflake irons always bitching. 
---
I havent because I use the RIGHT WIKI
---
I wonder how many bots they have running at a time
---
It’s fake.

Why does this even need to be polled. Literally just change it lmao
---
If you thought rcing was cancer, this method will confirm, 100%
---
1500 total ensures that you saw somebody with female player character with arma helmet?
---
It literally looks a bald cap.
---
They need to make it a top priority imo lol

proof that dailyscape made u log in even when you dont want to...

dailyscape is fucking cancer

My Black Speech is a bit rusty, but I'm pretty sure it says "One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."

Jesus janglebux please give this man his stance option finally, poor guy's been at this for a year and we still hold the 2h like a lazy sack 😓
---
Which pre-ironman mode DIY account was more popular than OMA?
---
I'd vote yes to divine if it was dropped by a new boss, no point in adding shit to a droptable that's existed for 4 years
---
Get your eyes checked lmao
---
When you play HC on online games, dying because you DC is a risk you have to take, so accept you died and make a new character. If you die from a DC in diablo or POE you don't continue playing as softcore pretending to be a HC character, that is just stupid.
---
The main reason people do not do this is because once you don't have the fear of dying, you take risks you wouldn't normally have taken if you were still playing on HC. Maybe boaty will decide to harder pvm content without farming all the items he would have needed if he was HC, all of the decisions he makes from here on out wont be the same now that he is playing SC. 
---
I don't play HC on OSRS, but i only play HC on diablo, POE, and grim dawn so i understand the feeling of losing hundreds of hours of work, but his account is not worth playing anymore if he likes playing HC. It wont feel the same and he will make a new HC within a few weeks if playing his fake HCIM. 
---
Oh and I suppose you want me to stop using internet explorer as well?!
---
Isnt this the first wiki that pops up?
---
Is there a better FFA world?
---
The tbow argument diesn't make sense, especially since it's on par with arclight.
---
Unpopular opinion for a good reason. The wildy altar/black chins/revs are the most active spots in the wilderness so of course anyone looking to kill anyone else will probably head there if they want some deep wildy action (which is much different than pvp world spec tab, full void/untradable metas). If you can’t find a pvper to fight when you are hopping worlds but you see a hunter/someone using bones, might as well kill them while you are there. It’s like the in between activity when pking since there is hardly ever constant pvp fights going on
---
Its ok just guthans spear isnt a billion dollar anymore, which is how it should be in the first place. Ahrim is expensive, v skirt is expensive, karil (top i think?) is expensive, g spear still like 1.5m or so, other tank tops and bottoms 300k or so. You get lots of money from double rune drops now too so barrows is fine. 
---
Also question 1
---
I mean it’d be pretty abusable 
---
Shouldn’t be brewing on maiden 
---
Lol they’re even on the f2p worlds, just hangout at the altar with a maple short bow and some addy arrows. 
---
Divine's completely useless anyway.
---
Turn pray on, double click it off/on between each tick. Your rhythm has to be quite good and if your connection is bad it's not really possible. Turn on game sounds to hear prays activating and you'll see what I mean by "between ticks" 
---
Thx for the diagnosis fam ;) Sinking 8 thousand hours into some pixels in the shape of 99 while you can't even interact with others is usually the behavior of severely autistic people btw
---
Nty
---
Someone runs out of supplies mid kill or something, or they get caught in the wilderness or something
---
&gt;His analogy, from an objective standpoint based in reality, is actually quite good.
---
It's objectively not
---
You’d think that but no lol... 
---
It's not a assumption that over 80% of player on PC use it though
---
The guy brought over 100 notes bones to chaos altar. He could've just went to world 330 and use someone's altar. Chaos altar's benefit definitely warrants the risk of being in the wilderness. This is coming from someone who has used chaos altar from 20 to 60 prayer. You can't expect people to not come for those who have an inventory of high value bones. I just don't bring notes bones, if I make a mistake I'd rather not be punished that bad but this guy made the risk and should've accepted it.
---
I have no pets yet and im triple your xp. FeelsBadMan.
---
So implement so corp is better money. Seems like a very poor reason. Vote no!
---
Base 70 is the noob trap level where you are deceived into thinking you're high enough for bosses, but you're actually just not. Either do barrows or keep training. 
---
You can also build one in your poh, it's a feature of the Adventurer's Log!
---
Chymistry
---
It is not worth getting as a main, no. If you already have it then bring it to aberrants if you do those. 
---
Done.
---
Please tell me you are killing them.
---
Thanks
---
That's actually really good advice for HCIM!
---
Which means with real world calculations, and wildly difficulty multiplier that’s looking like OP has to kill just another 1500
---
I don’t often talk to bankers. Devalues my silent mode HCIM. 
---
But in reality players who stay up to date on the game are aware when a new poll is out and they are the ones who should have their voices heard. Also there is a notification when you login that there is a new poll.  
---
I think people forget that toxicity is an attitude thing, not just what you're saying. It's like in Dark Souls if you chug 20 estus vs someone who doesn't heal once, and then point down - you're toxic, but you didn't say anything.
---
Can't tell if trolling or actually disabled
---
I've never been hit more than 60 by that
---
Hey guys i love making these videos for you all! But now that i cant leech i wont
---
MM9 on Zybez had an ironman with a thread that had thousands and thousands of replies that started in 2006 iirc.
---
He was the first big 'ironman' that popularized the format years before boaty did.
---
Boaty was just smart af to get the youtube/twitch grind down and could be entertaining in vids.
---
They’ve been stocking up on genie randoms since the 3rd age 
---
I think thqts the fastest exp. But im not sure
---
You said in the other comment you don't mind grinding quests for requirements. What's the difference here?
---
maybe but even if it is, its not updated or moderated any more and shouldnt be used. 
---
I voted no because I dont like adding things to already existing droptables, pretty sure they haven't done it before for the same reason, just make Corp 2 or somethin
---
If there are no bosses that have guaranteed gp/h that means people will have to spend hours to get rare drops to afford upper echelon gear or simply buy the gold. So I understand why there are guaranteed gp/h bosses in the game.
---
The problem, tho, is the level of gp/h. Why is the expected return/value from doing these guaranteed gp/h bosses higher than from those without it? Max efficient Vorkath expected value is close to 5m profit per hour and it is farmable 24/7. The expected value on almost every other piece of content is lower. This means there's no point in doing anything besides Vorkath as it is the easiest method to guarantee upper echelon gear.
---
And the worst part is that getting to DS2 from a cb3 for an experienced player doesn't even take a week. To do raids, however, it would take atleast 2 weeks to reach all the stats to be considered efficient. For high-tier Slayer it's even more. 
---
I don't understand why statements on Twitter from experienced players and upper echelon PvMers go unconsidered - Cloud rebalanced the Konar drop table. Why can't we decrease the Vorkath maximum earning potential by atleast 1 mil?
---
Konar doesn't count separetely. Only wildy master.
---
well luckily everyone votes against pvp updates out of spite and pvp is dead then I guess
---
Imagine playing something for months, just to lose it all, thanks to something out of your control... this is why i'll never understand the appeal of HCIM
---
You're exactly right on the % uptime. This is how most providers in US work. 
---
Cringe 
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah, but you don’t have to be a dick either. 
---
Jagex can undo the drunk driver they just don't want to.
---
Yes...yes they do dude.  If you do enough RNG based events you'll most likely encounter that.  Unlikely things are likely to happen.  For example, if I have a 1000 side die, and I roll a 4, that's pretty unlikely.  However, just by rolling the die something unlikely is guaranteed to happen.
---
Yeah the lore for it I believe is Zilyana stole it while making a fake peace treaty with kree’arra and kept it as a prize of her own cunning
---
Just do what I do. Play HCIM. When the day comes that I die to something dumb I do then I blame myself. If the day comes that I DC just keep playing regular Ironman. Sure, it's not the same without the title or status but if you weren't going to be HC to begin with then nothing has changed. 
---
Did I say that? The concept of something being somewhat expected and still a reasonable thing to complain about isn't exactpy complicated. 
---
Kiva.
---
&gt; What is autism, Alex?
---
What are you on about? 
---
I am talking about mechanics here, not changes to content.
---
&gt; Yes, that's obviously the problem with PvP. 
---
Am I stating it is **the problem** with PvP?   
---
No. I am merely stating it is a problem. One of many problems.
---
&gt; It's because things might change. Fucking limestone isn't this dense.
---
Again, you've totally misunderstood my point.  So I'm going assume you're talking about yourself with the last part.
---
What is that thing?
---
Hes not waldo
---
Waldo is a streamer btw go check him out
---
Dude. Look at the list of changes. A lot were controversial ones that would never pass polls. 
---
Averages.
---
Lmaooo
---
Nice one. Especislly in f2p 👍
---
Might be because of "the crucible"? We read it in literature class in school
---
Anything 
---
My main issue isnt if it's op or not (it's not) but do we really need this shield? it doesn't fit into the game
---
The whole thing just never makes sense in the first place. Why force PvMers to go to areas where they get PvPed? like yeah the wild is a risky area, but why should someone that doesn’t want to PvP be forced to risk getting PvP while PvMing. Such a bad game design but we stuck with it.
---
We pay we yew
---
You have over a 99.9% chance of going 1000 dry on something 1/128. You’re like 100x more likely to get something on 1 kc than to go 1000 dry for it. There’s your probability dumbass so no nobody goes 10x the drop rate for stuff unless they’re in lottery ticket winning fields of unlucky.
---
The way you calced it doesnt work. You're expecting people to bring half food half prayer pots. At arma for example, you need WAY MORE prayer than you need food. Thats the case pretty much anywhere else. Even if divine is 1 restore per 2 brews saved, it just isnt worth it because you're going to use way more than 1 rest per 2 brews.                  
---
"if you are better off not using a shield at all at Kree'arra, then why did you even bring it up?" Yeah what he meant by that is that its better to use no shield at all than divine cus of the prayer drain. Ely is bis there.              
---
Besides for pking (which people either wouldn't fight cus divine, or cus ragging, or simply people wouldn't bring it cus afraid to get ddosed), i don't see any use the divine would currently have in the game.                                                                      
---
With that said, I hope they do release it so it'll push jagex to bring updates that are harder so that ely or divine would be bis
---
Probably because you ran him down while he was naked doing a clue. You might not be bad, but killing a defenseless target doesn't make you good
---
Even if it's just removing him I thought that's what people wanted, seems not
---
Doubtful
---
Unless you get teleblocked right after it drops...
---
IRONcally
---
What's wrong with the guides? 
---
We should be asking why should it have a 75 RC requirement rather than asking why not. Some quests might deserve it, this hypothetical one just doesn't sound like it does.
---
Kurask head
---
Can you really complain that people don't like you or what you're doing when you're hanging around said mugging street trying to mug people? Jesus fucking christ the PvP manchildren who just cannot accept that people don't have to appreciate them for petty killings. 
---
Bet the guy killing him came in his pants when he heard the pet thing.
---
Thank you. 
---
Name me one place where you would need 3 sharks over 1 dose of prayer 
---
/H
---
If I want to effectively train prayer I am forced to go into the wild.  
---
I know i'm going into a dangerous area. I don't want to. Being there against my will because the game forces me into these locations to not lose money is how the player divide has become so large. Jagex forcing people into the wild by locking content into it (godcapes, altar, wealth charging).  
---
Your analogy is quite bad, because nobody is forcing you to go down the waterslide. You've made that choice on your own free will because you wanted to go down it.   
---
I don't want go down the slide, but I have to get down; I don't want to go into the wild, but I have to get the BiS mage cape.  
---
People are being 'lured' into the wild for the wrong reasons. These people already have negative emotions flowing through them because they don't want to be there. When a pk'er does show up it just confirms their grievances.
---
So basically what you're saying is that instead of getting 77 rc and having an afk mining method, we should just get one immediately??
---
Yeah sure sounds legit lol
---
You should use the free member trial for the cape and just never take it off
---
i thought it was an eyeball until i just looked closer.
---
Lol are you fucking 14 years old? 
---
Your amulet is working perfectly! 
---
You sound like a whiny bitch, get off your high horse and go get fucked in the ass.

Try tweeting mod Ash instead of reposting on Reddit over and over

99 slayer and most white dots I see are going to ruin my experience 
---
And dwarves, goblins, ogres, dark warriors. Sooo many sentient peoples.
---
Jagex give him hcmi back
---
Dammit man I saw this brainlet and thought the same thing, you beat me to it lol
---
Who the fuck uses an arma helm anyway? This is Slayer Helm country.
---
Talking about rs lore?
---
We dont do that here
---
An? An??? AN???? 
---
There is a way tho... Check hiscores :thinking:
---
Probably, but he still has a stupid meme name.
---
Currently hopping between OSRS and smash bros on switch. Can’t squeeze any more in since OSRS takes up too many hours lol. 
---
Something something "Less skill involved because you can position the prayers in a more accessible format." Something something "Easyscape." 
---
Except in those games the servers are much less volatile and don't randomly disconnect players for seemingly no reason while keeping them logged into the server for the potential of a death that is completely out of your control. If it was his personal fuck up that caused his death I'm sure he would restart on the spot, but having a shitty game server be the cause of death is disheartening and demotivating.  
---
Seriously it’s a waste of time to even be on a poll
---
&gt;Your analogy is quite bad, because nobody is forcing you to go down the waterslide.
---
Do you think someone is forcing you to go into the wildy?
---
&gt;You've made that choice on your own free will because you wanted to go down it.
---
Is this satire? Do you honestly not see how that's similar to you walking into the wildy?
---
Do you think it's like an arbitrary thing that the best way to train prayer is dangerous, that Jagex did mistakenly?
---
I hope I'm getting baited here. There's just no way you can't understand this.
---
How long is a tick? Should I just be constantly clicking?
---
He is pushing his opinion onto viewers to sway their vote, im not against divine entirely and voted yes myself. 
---
If he was to say “dont forget to vote in the poll guys” it would be fine

I messaged the okers and asked for some tips on getting started they were exteemely helpful. I now jave a 1 def pure which when im bored i log on and kill people at revs &lt;3 
---
So ty pkers for introducing me to another fun aspect of osrs.
---
Nobody is stopping you from using ZMI
---
Quick maffs were pretty on point. I added them all up and got \~830m. Through these drops alone, each kill gives you on average \~275k (minus food/armor/pots/weapons etc. for profit ofc).
---
And here I am 50+ chests cry :’)
---
lol GET FUCKED IDIOT 
---
He did say this last time i believe but it bothered him so much he stopped.
---
&gt; I am absolutely against having mechanics work differently based on your location.
---
This is why I voted no. Either have it one way or the other, but having something one way and then suddenly have it changed based on your situation is dumb.

Designing drop tables is not simple and I'm honestly not sure how I feel about how it should be done. Whether or not vorkath/zulrah are principally good is a hard question. But from a player POV I  can tell you that I absolutely refuse to touch gwd/cerb/raids. I only do bosses like vork and zulrah. I absolutely 100% cbf subjecting myself to rng and going dry. If a boss existed who dropped an exactly average drop every single kill and removed variation entirely, I would take that in a heartbeat. 
---
Zamorakian scum 
---
No retort for The Clue scroll argument I see
---
It definitely happens. Op is claiming to go a about x7.8 times the droprate dry. Thats not unheard of. You're trying to argue it is extremely unlikely which no one is saying it isn't.  But what you don't understand is that if you do enough events, unlikely things are likely to happen. With the amount of people playing this game performing thousands of probability events every day, these things do happen.
---
Talk about dedication 
---
I think it’s because these devs nowadays are trying to push out big chunks of new content all the time and the new items don’t have a place in the game and will be cheap within a month, so they have to put great alchables in the table to keep people from saying it’s dead content. 
---
100mil for a 1/300 sounds like a scam pker proceeds to kill
---

---
They should just change it unpolled. It's a tiny graphical change that nobody would even notice. Why leave these types of things up to a community of morons?
---
At least the Dragon Defender is going to be red instead of pink now though. We did something right for a change.
---
what if uim got white:btwbtwbtw
---
I agree
---
consider this: osrs would be around place 5 to 7 on steams most played games. it seems active enough to guess another 5 to 7 years running. for instance EVE has less than 30k players and is still online, same with older games such as Tibia, Maplestory or ragnarok. runescape is prolly your safest time investment because it doesnt rely on a "bubble" like PUBG did/does
---
Want to share and compare the size of our.... hats?

So sorry for all the microaggressions, you must be absolutely traumatized.

Only minus for me, is him not using banks... There's freaking banks in morytania, so I really don't get it :D
---
Ok I have idea how long it takes was just asking cheers 
---
i cant believe that we live in a world where people who go into pvp zones die
---
Op isn't even claiming to go 10x over the droprate
---
The only situation id say to bring heart is if your magic level is 96 or lower, that way a bat cant stop you from barraging. I have multiple kcs and found it wasnt that important. Wave 50+ you pray augury at the start of the wave to freeze + def bonus anyway. You can try experiementing for yourself, its not too big of a deal.
---
You must live in a deluded world if you think things would change even if "snowflakes" like me wouldnt care. 
---
There already is a delay, but it's a minute. I think a good solution would be to allow customization of that delay on a per player basis - I certainly don't want to be disconnected every time I drop connection for a tick but I can completely understand any hcim accounts that want to.
---
Either you get it
---
Most of my diablo 3 deaths are from d/c's so they are not as stable as you make them out to be. Even if OSRS's servers are worse, it still does not change anything. He knew the risks when making the account, you can't just make up new rules because you died, it ruins the whole point of playing HC in the first place.
---
You can do some gwd if you have other friends or a clan. Would be tough but not unmanageable. Drops are pretty good too.
---
let's get this item thru the polls so I can read this comment

This is the sort of response I was hoping for.

You’ve got my support.
---
There's a one touch option you could use to bring up the options instantly?

Sorry, I'm confused. What happened here? How are you heing attacked in Seers Village?
---
The only thing that would get buffed by Divine being added is Corp.
---
Don’t do him like that bro lmaooo

Why bother go to ge everyday? I’d just park my account in the shop

He said his goal was rigour first, and then theater of blood. We were thiiiiiis close to ToB content lol
---
Yeah the hate is hilarious,  why I will always vote to keep him
---
I wish we could see death counters
---
Fuck sake :/
---
Literally 100k? You mean 100-400k
---
That's just silly reasoning. 
---
Everything is optional, playing the friggin game is optional.   
---
But, reverting back to my point you seem to not want to adress:   if you're trying to get the maximum out of bossing or PvM in general, i'll want those BiS items. They're currently locked behind shit I don't want to do. Not because it's 'difficult' or I 'cant handle it' (Lmao wat) but because it's annoying and trivial. With this same reasoning you could say the 40 hour grind it took to unlock Darth Vader in BF2 when it first came out is totally cool and if you can't handle the annoyances and grind of getting those characters, maybe they aren't for you.  
---
It's really just a matter of opinion. I don't think content should be locked in the wilderness just to lure people there so PK'ers can pretend PK'ing isn't currently dead. PVP worlds? High risk worlds? locking untradeable/essential content into it?  They're all just incentives to get people to pk. The majority of people don't want to PvP and that's just a fact. And when that majority is forced to there just to get items they can't otherwise get, it creates hatred no matter what.  
---
I know I saw his flair
---
In f2p, well thats a pretty big achievement but 37 runecrafting is even more awsome. You should really try membership my guy
---
This sub lost their shit last week when Jagex over an unpolled boat. They would lose their shit if they changed the defender without polling.
---
Who the hell wants that horrible, horrible pun polluting Lumbridge?
---
Or you dont

---
Averages would only work on linear progression, not on exponential.
---
Yes that's what happened when i solod a sara hilt for the first time, infact i was shaking so hard i clicked the hilt and teled out without picking it up
---
Saw it on Facebook
---
So... this isn't exactly what you asked. You asked if slayer was expensive, and the answer is no not necessarily. If you do it at absolute optimal speeds then you certainly could drop a sizable amount of gold on it. But it doesn't have to be that way, safespotting makes it profitable at pretty much all levels, and it really doesn't slow you down by all that much.
---
Yeah there is. But when i was fly fishing it was not like this. I started fishing in one click even tho you can bait fish there too. I know its not a big problem but doing something in one click is better than in two clicks. 
---
&gt;For the record, my username is the exact same in literally ever game I have ever played.
---
Unless you have a very old account you log in via the e-mail that is registered to the account not the username.
---
Errrm, maybe you should check the roots of the word
---
There is no differnce between being in wilderness on regular world and in wilderness on pvp world
---
There is third party stuff so your mouse acts as a touch input instead of natively registering as a mouse, but I'm not gonna point you at it cause I dunno how safe it is.   
---
It's funny how often this is used for other apps too. Everyone should just be adding native mouse support, or developers should just figure out how to make the mouse actually function well on mobile.  
---
Like with minecraft for the phone you can use a keyboard to move wasd, but if you use the mouse, it still acts as a touch. So you have to click and drag to move the screen which doesn't make sense. You can remap your mouse movement to act as a joystick but you lose the mouse functionality.   
---
A lot of clicker based money games disable mouse for some reason or another too, so there are a lot of controller mapper apps, and mice apps that are really good for mobile.  
---
You can have (against the rules most likely don't do it) a ps3 controller mapped to locations on the screen, and have the joy stick swipe certain directions in a area if you wanted it too. So alching could be as easy as hitting, x, then o. or you could map a whole agility course to all the buttons on it. Again don't do this. 
---
You rarely make 400k, and the raids where you get a pure ess and lizard an fang drop even it out to like 100k profit per raid. My average loot with 30k point raids is probably 250-300k, but supplies I’d say average to 150k depending on the raid. So I guess it’s more like 150k profit for 30 min.
---
your old account is on Runecape 3, everyone had to start over in OSRS
---
thats the point of the suggesttion, and only with the amulet you could see what they are actually saying.
---
couldnt agree more.
---
Albion Online. It's like what PvP worlds on OSRS should be. But PvM is virtually non existent and quite repetitive, so i come to OSRS for that.
---
Isn't that part of the prestige of a wilderness pet (except maybe the chaos ele pet that is so common)
---
Basically the meta for money making is almost strictly pvm. Raids 2 &gt; Raids 1 &gt; Vorkath &gt; Zulrah. Slayer can be decent money while you level, and skills in the 80s and 90s can be profitable. The wiki has a money making page which sorts the best gp/h, id recommend looking at that :)
---
So... it takes a week for a fresh player to do max efficiency Vorkath? Or just a week to get to Vorkath in which their returns are significantly lower than ideal? Where do they get the Gold to train their skills to acceptable levels for the quest within a week, let alone complete the 200 Quest Point requirement along with several long chain-quests? Because that alone is going to take a significant chunk of time that goes over a week of typical playing unless you're playing quite a bit more than the average player.
---
These numbers seem like they were pulled out of your ass and involve someone who's playing incredibly long hours a day(Not to mention skipping basic things like "How do I get the Gold to train to these requirements, let alone for gear?"), which certainly isn't the average player, and I'd argue that most experienced players on a fresh account without assistance wouldn't be able to do Dragon Slayer II within a week.
---
Im wondering if unique supply drops from skilling only bosses and events would help. I agree skilling isnt even close to being able to hold a candle to bossing for money. 
---
UIM might also could be white:btwbtwbtw
---
With Cerb tho you’re kinda lucky to make profit if you don’t get uniques. In my experience, without crystals you’re entirely just trying to break even. 
---
&gt;&gt;your old account is on Runecape 3, everyone had to start over in OSRS
---
&gt; When they rereleased old school runescape you’re freaking right I made a new char and started over with my group of friends.
---
lol
---
YES WE WOULD, WILL
---
I know. I did start over in osrs. Both rs3 and osrs I can’t access my account. 
---
Your router might have a setting that resets every hour. My old one did for some reason. If it was a runescape thing a ton of people would be posting about it, and i cannot say i've experienced this the past few days.
---
What method do you use?
---
Show me where they touched you

limited life span? How old is Runescape? and how many people are addicted to it? You are vastly underestimating OSRS. 
---
In b4 jagex polls question for each player to be able to rearrange fishing options which only works in non-pvp areas.
---
Dharok is expensive too.
---
I'm a pvmer and I agree that it's funny. Shitty, but funny. In the end, it's just a game.
---
Blowpipe is more dps during the first phase of kq than any melee setup without scythe if you use dragon darts and land 2 dwh specs.
---
Lmao chaos ele isn’t an extremely rare drop.  its the easiest pet to obtain. 
---
I’m not arguing whether or not it was a good change. I’m just saying this sub acted like they implemented EOC. 
---
Ice barraging naked people at lava maze tele

Why would you even want to crash btw accs?

I laughed 
---
«use» key at gate?
---
Never know what they're risking.  I personally wouldn't bother killing them because I've killed a few people farming pet and never gotten any good loot, so I've come to accept that it's not worth the resources or time.
---
But there is always a chance that OP brought his whole bolt stack or 4 items, or was wearing 3 expensive items (note he didn't show his inventory).  You can't fault the person who killed them for killing them in a PvP zone.  Calling them a dick like the person above you is just flat out entitled.
---
GAYFORCE UNITE!
---
I don't play mobile much, but I feel like less switches would be better, so I'd go with tank armor, magic boosting jewelry (and maybe boots, depending on what you've got available), with a trident and either a whip or blowpipe. Trident the melee brothers and Karil, then use whip or blowpipe on Ahrim and killcount in the tunnels. Take a few pieces of food and a prayer pot or two incase Dharok or Ahrim is the one in the tunnel.
---
I fucking hate everything Ghost makes. 
---
&gt; Yet people voting yes with no osrs pvp experience have no idea
---
It's not that they necessarily have no idea, they probably just don't care.
---
Still a pseudo bank lol. It’s literally the same thing as a smaller space bank with stupid mechanics to use it. Just a terrible game mode overall lol
---
Doing raids is toxic as fuck with randos. "Show me kc, you need to have 200+ to raid with us" good luck any people starting to raid without friends.
---
"If you dont keep youe dps pre olm im kicking."
---
Imagine going through a raid (40min-1hr) under the mercy of a pissed off random threatening to kick you all the time. A lot of people wont raid with you unless you have 120m+ worth of gear. Raids has an extreme gatekeeper mentality. ToB is more understandable because its more punishing for not knowing the mechanics. 
---
As a type-1 diabetic (Diabetic btw), I approve
---
black ppl lol
---
I don't see the Divine affected the lifespan much either way. Also, given how long RuneScape in general has been around, I'm not too worried about OSRS's lifespan. Like the full lifespan of OSRS so far is 2001-2007 then 2013-2019 and ongoing; so that is over 12 years so far and while some things may be concerning, there is still a lot of room to grow. So the Divine is pretty trivial in the grand scheme of things since it is a pretty niche item, but in its niche, it is pretty strong. I wouldn't say it improves the game much, unless you are a rich chin hunter maybe, but while I don't like it mechanically I still wouldn't say it progresses us towards an end.
---
Would make a good april fools joke to be honest. A nice event about a hermit who lives in some remote place and you go on a small quest to retrieve his trimmed iron helmet
---
Dont i feel silly now
---
Oh i forgot 100+ wyrm bones are enough to fight back...
---
That's really try hard, imagine being that friend and never going under 50hp for a week, it's not logical, the only times people will unplug their router is if they have time for it, minutes before they die, which is almost never the case.

Or gee.. I dunno... Bookmark the wiki?

What's it like only have two braincells to rub together? :o
---
*and 43 days
---
Who the fucks making you go to wildy altar oh right no one haha
---
I never denied that man, I understand the frustration with pkers who target exclusively pkers - that's why I called them shit. The only thing I was responding to was the idea that *no* pkers exist who are out there just to actually fight each other. 
---
There's legitimately 0 reason for any PvMer or clue hunter to go to east graves or shore and those are huge meeting places for brids.
---
Come on tell me again. I want to hear about how you're an absolute legend again!
---
Exactly if the community spites pures and pkers and vote no on every poll just out of selfishness, why do you think the problem will be fixed.  He was in the wilderness he knew his risks.  Not like it was Callisto cub.. it was the easiest pet to obtain.
---
It's certainly easier to find stuff when not being actively vandalized 
---
I can't tell if that dude is trolling or not 
---
Yep, you are feeling the pain as well haha. Gl!
---
If you're calling someone a cunt over losing nothing maybe do some self reflection

Functional and consistent UI comes before "it was always this way so it should stay this way", Everytime. Hopefully we'll get scaled UI's on the default client eventually (runelite already has this, you can double, triple, or even quadruple the size of all icons depending on your resolution) which by the current PKing community's definition is cheating. Runelite currently allows you to cheat in PVP but nobody cares because the functionality of the UI makes far more sense.
---
Moral obligation to kill him to make the wilderness risky. 
---
Agreed. If someone just got a pet drop I wouldn't kill them. Under any other circumstance I would though. 
---
Just imagine if you got venny or Callisto pet and right as the pet drops you get tb'd. Worst nightmare.
---
You must hate him because your not him
---
because if i don't i'll have to spend more money just to get the same prayer xp essentially punishing me for not participating in getting hunted by brainlet pkers hahaaaaaaaaaaa
---
I believe that was one of his earlier works and his more recent stuff tends to be better. The OSRS Art Style is a bit tricky to get down. Also, the defender design did have a lot of community feedback so sometimes the silly things the Artists do, like not making Ferocious Gloves cover the hands, is because the community told them too rather than what they wanted.
---
Doesn't it look the same if you have a bunch and just sell 120 at a time?
---
Run out of supplies? - tele.... wildy?  Disable in wildy os fair enough
---
username checks out
---
The whole reason the drops that come out of the wilderness are worthwhile is because you can be killed at any time, that's the whole point. There's literally the rest of the mainland and an entire other continent for you guys to go pvm in peace. Pvpers have one zone that belongs to us and when you trespass you can expect to die
---
Maybe if the polls didnt fail for no reason, it would give people the want to pk more, and your precious clue hunter wouldnt be as targeted because pkers would be too busy killing other pkers worth something.
---
The pking isnt going anywhere. but with less people doing it because of people voting no on polls that dont effect them, pvmers and clue hunters are going to be targeted and not spared any time soon.
---
its not about just going on and crashing them. It's that they are being really fucking annoying, they feel entitled to every monster and every resource.
---
Yes bringing that 1-2 p pots mow means you take 1-2 less food... in osrs prayer is more valuable
---
Make goblins have 1 in 1b chance to drop max cash stack
---
I have way more PvMers flame me when I kill them than PvPers.  Probably because PvPers accept that they can and should die, somehow PvMers think they're an exception
---
The only reason this failed is cause it said PvP in the question
---
questing
---
&gt; What fucking stupid reason was there for not allowing it in pvp?
---
&gt; 
---
So that maybe *just maybe* it would have a chance at passing.
---
Looks like it was futile.
---
As a medical professional, I can assure you that "reveling in others' misery" is not in DSM-V criteria for the diagnosis or symptomatology for Major Depressive Disorder. 
---
*BTW*
---
I agree with the god capes, I would probably have never touched the wild if not for them, but everything else in the wild is entirely risk/reward. There's no reason you can't train or make money elsewhere
---
'Maxed combat main' which takes like 1-2months of afking to get lol
---
At least do it for April fools day?
---
The desired uniques are always going to be valued for their stats, and inflated due to literally only having one avenue of getting into the game. But, I dont thibk anyone bosses with a reasonable expectation of beinf a visage, for example.  They boss with an expectation 
---
of a saturation point where you just spend hours grinding at 1-2mil/hr an hour, and you have the ability to not only make up supply costs, you can straight up buy whatever you were hoping could drop.
---
No one's going to Grotesque Guardians for the granite ring drops. 
---
Why it’s the same concept
---
Oof edgy
---
????
---
Kinda but cause it also reduces damage taken it’s not gonna be that scary- cause you won’t die in the time it takes you to resip prayer potions.
---
its sad that people thinkg divine is powercreep and overpowered in the era when we have blowpipe and scythe
---
I do care, but bad stuff happens and that's the way of the road. You laugh it off and move on.
---
With burning ammy, getting pk'd with 0 risk is a waste of 30 seconds max.
---
Gamers RISE UP!
---
Literally 90% of the outrage about the last spellbook poll was because it would change PKing, and now that they’re trying to solve that problem everyone is complaining about how it would be different for PvP and PvM. Wonder why they would have thought to poll it this way.
---
&gt;  I don’t think you really understand

Took me about 6000 tokens. Hang in there!

Im calling dragon claws as your next drop. If im right, share cause I tbed 😁

High level Slayer here, I've had many more good interactions while slaying than I've had bad. The only real issue I run into is people trying to jack my spot at dust devils, but they usually leave after realizing that I won't.
---
Look up the jad spawn guide, if you get a specific spawn, center I think? You stand in the corner by the entrance and get jad cornered to a rock so the healers all spawn behind him.  Then just throw a chin to aggro!

Cool, man. Thanks.  We appreciate the coverage.   Don't forget to credit us
---
&gt; If I want to effectively train prayer I am forced to go into the wild.
---
Huh. Why did jagex make it that way?
---
You don't have to ever enter the wilderness. You only enter when you accept the level of risk. The warning says to not bring anything that you don't want to lose.
---
Judging by the amount of replies it's much too late, so I can only assume his username is a relevant description of his mental state.  But he's right, it's not funny - it's hilarious that someone can be that delusional.
---
I kinda find it funny that people aren’t voting yes to it considering it’s already a RL plugin and a large portion of the community uses RL, so that option is already available to them.
---
Exactly this. The only reason I left my nearly maxed account on the old game was because of EoC. Not because I wanted to live in the past with some 2007 remake of the game.
---

Based on the highest xp/hr rate I'm seeing on the wiki's training guide (Agility Arena at 73k) it would take a little over 151 hours to go from 80 to 99

Here's [some context](https://np.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ar09dy/alt_account_gone_for_doing_23rd_inferno/). His post was removed by the mods, but you can see in the comments that he basically admitted to selling capes.
---
Try the regular client, if it doesn't happen then you know what the problem is.

Ok I like scrolled through all the comments and was like im not seeing anything 
---
70-77?  I've done prayer on 2 accounts in wildy, one an ironman, and I've yet to be attacked by anyone except my friend dicking around
---
During the last spellbook poll this entire subreddit was filled with PKers saying that being able to rearrange your spells and change the size of them would ruin the skill of PvP. There were dozens of suggestions saying “just make it not work in the wildy.” They listened to that response and made it only applicable to outside of PvP, and now suddenly everyone hates the inconsistency.
---
Yeah, that dude.
---
Dunno if the zybez forums are still up and running but i know they were posting updates last i checked like 18 months ago.
---
For me personally; theyre the first big ironman.
---
Any claws beside dragon are useless

My laptop is older, but the regular client and OSBuddy run smooth, RL lags terribly.

It's the difference in frequencies that create a third invisible sound. Use over ear head phones, and disable base boosting.
---
for bosses, lava dragons, rev caves, the chaos altar, fountain of rune et cetera, I understand them being balanced around risk/reward but what is the point of black salamanders being in the wilderness, the agility course, clue scrolls, the mage arena or the abyss?
---
if the reasoning for black salamanders / agility course being in the wilderness is for highest xp/hour in a specific level range then you could make that argument for every other skilling method that is best xp/hour for a certain level range also belonging in the wilderness too, but that isn't the case.  
---
medium clue scrolls don't require you going to the wilderness yet have ranger boots as a potential drop, so why should harder scrolls that have worse average reward need to be in the wilderness, plus everyone just 3-items wilderness steps with a clue box anyway, so even if your cask did contain a 3rd age item if you simply don't open it until you're out of the wilderness there's no way for you to lose it, so what's the point of the risk of dying to the person doing the clue?
---
the most you could pk from someone going to the abyss is like a glory and some rune essence. what's the point besides to be a dick and waste someone elses time.
---
mage arena / mage arena 2, what's the point of pvm content with an untradable reward being in the wilderness. best in slot mage cape? there's tons of best in slot items that don't require you to enter the wilderness, so why does this one in particular require you to.  
---
if the only reason to pk someone doing these activities is to be a dick and waste their time, why does this content need to be there in the first place.
---

---
Eh I wouldn’t mind if rl kept it. I guess it’s kind of semantic but there’s a difference to me in people seeking out a third party client to overlay a feature they want vs jagex actually implementing game designs  that dichotomize players. If you want to use it on rl idgaf, but runescape stops being runescape if jagex actually implements stuff like this themselves.
---
I disagree..you have it backwards. Cosmetic updates SHOULD be polled because that has no effect on anything and is solely up to the players if they like it or not. However for other updates, especially with buffing or changing an item, those should not be polled. For starters, if youve seen some of the ideas/suggestions and ways that players would change the game then they shouldnt even be allowed to fucking vote on anything other than cosmetics lol. Because the game would literally be shit if even a few of these suggestions ever took place (there are some that are well thought out and balanced, but its usually pretty rare). Basically the devs are there for a reason. The players as a majority dont know anything about game design or even balancing for that matter, and they should not be able to influence certain aspects of the game that NEED to change. 
---
The only reason that i side still with the need to poll/vote is because jagex has a pretty bad track record of some awful updates. But if im not mistaken this is a completely new team working on osrs, so there is that at least. But seriously - some of the suggestions made by people are just..beyond comprehension..
---
Tldr: certain things should be polled. QoL updates and cosmetic updates I think should. Outside of those they really shouldnt have to poll certain updates due to the fact a lot of times player bias will factor in to much for an update that will actually improve the game. 
---
Twisted bow is OP for sure but it’s also 1b and comes from end game content very rarely. I think bp is much more of an issue.
---
Really poor taste joke man, definitely consider deleting this post
---
Have you considered doing the same advice, but with reddit?
---
You can over half kill it and leave the wilderness and have a friend kill it.
---
There's no hard minimum, but you'll definitely want at least 40 prayer for protect from missiles, since Jad switches between range and mage attacks that can oneshot kill you if you're not praying against it. If you're trying it for the first time, I'd try to get at least 75 range for the blowpipe, probably at least 60-70 defense for extra help tanking hits throughout the caves, and a higher prayer level will also be a big help in saving supplies.
---
Just get avernic defender /s

Hunting chins by putting the trap near a ladder, no where chins? Unless he's hunting the kind of chins only RCers have?

PKers are cancer
---
I really don't understand how you guys (the people who voted no) think. You know people are using rearranged prayers in a non-bannable 3rd party client anyways regardless of how this vote goes so what's keeping you from adding it to the main client? If the problem is that you really think rearranged prayers is overpowered, then you should be looking into getting it removed from RuneLite since it's an unfair advantage at this point.
---
One of my friends has gotten 2 arcanes in 200 raids.
---
Well yeah but they could just poll it both ways.
---
I just said I dont like unique items being added to old bosses/droptables. Maybe it should have been there in the first place but it doesn't matter, make Corp2 or something
---
Sadly the most practical solution to something like this is to code a RuneLite plugin that hides box traps from the menu. It'd take maybe 30 seconds to code, you'd just have to build the client yourself, as I doubt a plugin like that would get added to the main RuneLite client.
---
Uhm no?  He should have 3-4 items. If those items were expensive, it's all too possible he could have like an archers ring that he could get smited for or something.
---
It's also possible that OP protected some black dhide and a crossbow or something.  Who knows.  Dunno why he cropped inventory.
---
Range/2h Pking F2P 
---
Nobody is forcing him but this logic of "dont go in the wild if you dont wanna get pk'd" is just as stupid as saying you are forced to go in the wild. When you park in a public parking lot, you would really like for your car not to get hit or fucked up, but it can happen. What are you going to tell these people? Don't park in a public parking lot?
---
Speaking of killing people for pets, I ran into two ironmen who were 1v1ing in multi with Ven pets, both skulled with Veracs.  Might have TBed both of them and crashed that fight lol
---
It’s because the last time they polled something for both PvP and PvM all the PKers on this subreddit threw a fit about how it would impact PvP, so they’re trying to listen to that feedback towards future polls. Now suddenly the subreddit hates the idea of it not being used in the Wildy but able to be used in PvM. 
---
Yeah, for sure, and not because he is in wildy and might be risking something worthwhile, only cuz of the pet.

Hi PVPmainbtw!

Progressing towards 99 crafting, about to get 91 today, started at 87 two days ago. 
---
You may want to include what your actual hp level is. And yes chances are unless you planned from the start or much earlier on to get an untrimmed cape you probably won't. 
---
Id try to just cannon each task you can and stop around 98 ish incase you need to range a certain task, then like others said use trident for some and etc. Probably not possible though depending on current lvls. Well its possible but it depends on how long you actually want to spend to do it just for an untrimmed cape. Could always do partner kills and get slow exp that way. 
---
Why do they keep re-polling if it keeps failing? Surely the second time through would have been concrete enough evidence. 
---
Wtf that's bullshit
---
Probably dont want to poll too many things in the re-run poll. Could also have been too confusing for some people seeing almost the same question twice.
---
High quality meme please don’t delete. This had me laughing

You can bring only 3/4 items to complete the clue in the wilderness, if youre not doing this already, youre an actual brainlet lol. Being killed by a pker = fast tele out

Hi Copelite!
---
Ehh that’s not the issue, the issue is the hive mindedness of his followers.
---
Larger streamers opinions tend to have more weight because their followers will blindly agree with them, whether the opinion is considered good or bad.
---
PvP purists can just keep their icons where they were without ruining it for others.
---
I didn't say you can't do it, it's just being an asshole.
---
Didn't ask 
---
no, it looks stupid.
---
I guess every maxed main that attacks me is a dick because I don't want to fight maxed mains :/
---
What about when people vote something in, and it's just a terrible update. With that logic shouldn't we be able to vote stuff out of the game too?
---
Some guy is doing the same thing on thieving worlds for ardy knight. He uses a bond on the splasher and then quickly cancels and kills the knight
---
Look, everyone is allowed to prey on the vulnerable.  Just like everyone has the right to fucking hate the people that do it.  Do shitty things, get treated shitty.  The system works.
---
Gear discord?

As another F2P, I congratulate you. Maybe one day I'll have enough time to grind out enough to get bond, and it looks like you have enough skills to do that

Galaxyg was an f2p Ironman account back in classic...

At those points, it's basically just a different language, but I think people here are complaining about actual wilderness pking.

outside of polls nobody other than Jagex should dictate OSRS.

---
Since you're deleting your post:
---
&gt;Please find me where it says in game "when you are in the wild you should kill other players." It's no more encouraged than OP going there to get his PVM items.
---
So, you want me to explain to you, what the purpose of the Wilderness is? 
---
You think they made it back in 2001, so you could do clue scrolls years later when they were released, and kill lesser demons for a rune medium helmet? Or do you think it was made for people to kill/fight each other, which was the only place to do so, besides staking?
---
Should we tell him?
---
I also had a bank pin, I'm so confused how this happened??
---
Power creep? Are you a downie this wouldn’t be useful most places 
---
you're literally hating him because you ain't him
---
So you should be respectful of Hitler cause ded. 
---
Right
---
It's not really encouraged to kill other players there. It's just possible. You're encouraged in duels and bounty hunter and stuff. 
---
Larger streamers have that weight because there’s simply more of them. If the people you describe are 3% of viewers in a stream, then it might not seem like a lot in a stream where there’s only 100 viewers but it will seem like a lot when you have 10k and there’s 300 people agreeing with whatever the streamer says. Plus there’s also no way to determine if they actually are just following blindly or if they actually have the same opinion as him, which is entirely possible. But on the subreddit there’s no way to tell if someone’s a b0aty hive mind follower or if they simply share the same opinion unless they come out and say so.
---
The point is, it would be healthy for the game to restrict something as overpowered as runelite but they don't because they worry that people would quit because of it. Probably one of the most retarded reasons to quit this game in my opinion but a worry regardless.
---
Nah it’s almost like you’re failing to understand why you’re being criticized so you’re assigning blame in a direction that no one is annoyed about

Guess what. Rs2 did far better than either games.. *until it didn't*.

The first major game killing updates came in rs2, not rs3.

dumb question but is there a cc or something out there to find people to do some pvming? Gwd in particular. I tried joining a few clans who advertised that they do pvm, but none of them actually were interested to form a group to do some bossing... don't have any friends either (pepe.jpg) to join me and I don't have the levels/gear to make a solo trip feasible.
---
You can drop trade them. Just do it somewhere nobody else is and you're good

I've done the meme. 👍🏻

The tablet itself supports a bluetooth mouse, but the OSRS application itself does not.
---
The past? You mean 10 years ago in a different version of the game with a different meta?
---
serves you right for using that wiki
---
Touche
---
Not in 2007 though, sure Osrs doesn’t have the same team as it did back then... but here we are 6 years after it’s rerelease and we’ve gone mobile... and there’s still more to go... 
---
I think the problem is that these are some form of "active item" as opposed to just an object that's dropped and available to be picked up.

Dude once again. I did not say osrs is dying lol.
---
I know lol, and I'm not saying strip away the mobile interface by any means. I love it.
---
I'm strictly speaking from the perspective of someone who owns a tablet in place of a laptop.
---
I agree, people often go overboard, but idk if that's much of a fair comparison. If you go down a water slide you expect to get wet. Going in wildy you know there's a *chance* to be pk'd, but are hoping against it. Maybe like going to the beach to sunbathe and are upset when someone splashes water on you. They're doing it for fun, and it doesn't really hurt, but it sure is annoying.
---
yeah, in fact having a video of him dying legit would be a massive piece of content for him; his followers would watch that shit daily.
---
Just so people know you can pick up your pet and drop shit til it's one of your 3 or 4 protected items.
---
I'd rather lose some dhide and a glory over a pet I've spent shit loads of time farming. 
---
Imagine wanting oldschool graphics in oldschool runescape.
---
Think that may literally just be you bro.
---
It would work for zulrah but not for Vorkath in my opinion. On release Vorkath had a pretty meh drop table and it would be dead content if it wasn't buffed. The necklace is very niche and wouldn't be worth very much and the ward is only worth so much because it's bis for Vorkath. If Vorkath was 1-2 m/hr like it was before nobody would be killing it and the demand for the ward would be near 0. I'd imagine ward would be 20m or less (like it was before dhcb Vorkath meta) if vorkath's drops were shit. So you'd have a boss that had sht rares and shit regular drops. 
---
you didn't but OP did... he didn't specifically say OSRS, but I assume Runescape implies either of them. 
---
ikr, just turn your camera or right click. zmi isnt even a group activity so you can also hop worlds too.

The safest way is to just use prayer to protect from everything. Prayer pots to make up for times when you don't have it. If you dont want to waste prayer pots I'd go with something big and tanky like Veracs because it will mitigate damage taken from 5/6 of the bosses so if you take on Ahrim first the only difficulty you'll have is when he's in the tunnel. 
---
One time I was at wildy altar with about 75 dragon bones. I was starting to get attacked, then stopped using the bones. I just sat there changing prayers. The pk'er just stopped and said "you're out, aren't you?"
---
"Yeah."
---
"FFS"
---
And I hopped, saving about 175k left of coins and bones. Quite a hilarious and slightly scary experience. No flaming, just deception.
---
Its easy to understand. Last time they changed something unpolled you saw what happened. This is how the poll system works. What if people prefer the models we have now?
---
Just don’t watch it then? Is that so hard?
---
I don’t know if this is true but I swear the devs made a lot of the zulrah drops catered towards IM. A bit of vorkath too. Like why the fuck do they do that, iron man is a challenge, gather resources the vanilla way, why fuckin give them easy resource drops from all the new bosses. 
---
Add me lad, Ceiny Vock, just got this skill as a first ever 99 too! Gratz :)

Bursting nechs &amp; smoke devils is profit. So bursting has no cost.

The numbers are from the 'old' slayer meta. You did tasks that aren't xp efficient then probably, like cerb, gargoyles, spectres etc etc. Those are more profit, and use more prayer pots.

Not many people enjoy quests but it's a huge integral part of the game you can't just ignore. It's part of the grind and it's a much shorter grind than 91 slayer.
---
Lol he was pointing out 1 update, even if you dont think tbow is op (which would only make u stupid) then you can mention 100s of broken updates. Its not hard to come up with.
---
I’m pretty sure it wasn’t more, it was animation issues. Every animation including combat would have to be made to include the possibility of you wearing the bedsheet all over the game, a huge task for a small but cool gimmick.
---
No I think everyone understands, they just think some PKers are shitty people from deriving enjoyment from wasting other people's time.
---
If you seriously care about PVP, you don't sit around jumping clue hunters. You go to one of the several areas that let you have a fair fight. Don't be surprised when someone thinks a PKer is an asshole for primarily targeting people who obviously can't or won't fight back.
---
No, nothing is stopping you from stomping naked people in the wildy, just like nothing is stopping you from driving 10mph under the limit in perfect road conditions. Doesnt mean people wont think you're an asshole for wasting everyone's time.
---
&gt; some stupid reason

What? Clearly most people don’t care as much as Reddit thinks they do
---
You ain't tricking us, ghost.

Because it should have been in the game many years ago. It shows progress, keeps the game from feeling outdated. And, it doesn't take anything away from the game, the concept of small icons = higher skill is ridiculous.

In RS classic's tutorial island, there's a whole guide on what to do and expect in the wilderness. RIP classic, but it was very obvious that the entire intention of the wilderness since some of the very earliest days of RS was for people to fight.

It's not until (relatively) recent updates that there's such a strong incentive for PvMers to go there. Assuming we're going back in time and considering the intention of the Gower brothers and not modern redditors.

My car getting smashed and fucked up in a parking lot is not something I agree to when I park there.

---
It doesn't matter what your intention is, the point of the wilderness, and the things put in it, is that there's an inherent risk of getting killed by other players when accessing that content.

he's been ddosed before and there are zero posts on the first 3 pages of the 2007scape reddit about the spellbook scaling repoll. Very logical conclusion.

booooooooooo, you suck
---
Not even close to guaranteed. 1) that isn’t even really a hotspot for pkers anymore except maybe a  d spear team. 2) all you have to do is make it to the kbd lair and you’re safe. People try to be warriors and fight back or run south and that’s how you lose your shit. Kbd lair is safe. Even if you are tbed you just have to survive the kbd for a few minutes.

That's the right mindset to have. I just don't think it's a popular one.

This looks great! As a suggestion, maybe have the items highlight yellow in the right panel if they're in the inventory but not in the correct place?
---
Jesus sorry.
---
or you could just say you got 99 cooking, we get it 
---
Did you get your double exp?
---
I thought the reason it's failing is because pvpers think pvmers would be getting something beneficial while they aren't, so they're voting no out of spite. 
---
Agreed, that sandwich lady is a real pain in the arse!
---
This is just how he wants to play the game. Mind your own business.
---
You cant keylog a bank pin you tit
---
noone is primarily targeting clue hunters u randomly find one every now an then an there is the chance they drop something like a master scroll book or cash stack u never know what they have even if they are just nakeds
---
*commitment
---
&gt;Content like this is made for people who enjoy the added risk of the wild
---
Which is an extremely tiny amount of people, while PvM'ers make up pretty much the entirety of the playerbase.
---
So the rest of us who do not enjoy it should just suck it up amirite? 
---
Everything being polled and everyone being allowed to voice their opinion on this shit is fun 'till someone has an opinion that differs from yours amirite?  
---
Wildy without this content is literally dead, there's no denying this.
---
i voted yes to on that i think, though i doubt u make up even 1% of the player base so, go ahead ig
---
I think the difference there is the competition mindset. 
---
If im deep wild pking I'm just looking to have fun and turn a profit. 
---
If I'm at edge or pvp world's I'm trying to turn a profit while showing I'm better at pking than the majority in my combat bracket. 
---
Similar to mobas, fps and other competitive games. You don't want to be bad. 
---
Lmao nice solution 
---
This is a solid post
---
So many services are monthly, and that's how it will always be because that's the only way they make money. Just because you can't find time to use the service enough to make it worth the cost doesn't mean the company should go bankrupt to cater to how little you play. 
---
Counsel and other PC games can just do a one time sale of say $30, but they can only do that because they'll sell millions of copies, then in a few years make a new game and do it all over again. 
---
If Jagex did this they'd make a good chunk of change upfront, and then they'd go fucking tits up after a year or so. Jagex would have to keep making a new game every few years for this model to work. 
---
You really didn't think this through. 
---
50% chance of getting it before 1386 drops.
---
90% chance of getting it before 4604 drops.
---
99% chance of getting it before 9208 drops.
---
The less traffic you give it the faster it'll get replaced as #1 search by google by the real one
---
Lmao gottem
---
I'm not saying they are psychopaths, I'm just saying if you think that you are a skilled pker when you only pk ungeared people then I don't know what to say. 
---
Oh wow, ye olde 'well i'm totally not part of that group, buuuuuuuut I agree with them. But i'm not part of that group trust me! see how even people who are outside of that group agree with them?'.
---
"I'm not racist or anything buuuuutt...."
---
Hes not forcing you but its completely up to you, youll probably go through more effort trying to raise awareness than taking the steps to reduce your own grief. 
---
Thanks man. I knew post would be a bit of a slow starter due to its size, but hopefully it can gain some traction now after people have read beyone "Warding - new skill".
---
Thanks! It's really effective
---
Uh who? That's been a highly. Talked about issue for years. 
---
this is why i dont have a bank pin, sure you can set it so that there is a short time after logging that you dont have to enter it, but everytime you log out for a while you have to enter it again. i'd gladly set a pin if it works like an authenicator
---
It's because adding new content to old areas is 1/2 the work of new content in new areas, and brings back people to nostolgic older areas and/or gives them a purpose to exist in the first place. 
---
F2p?
---
All Hail The Mighty 25 Buttholes!

You're missing the daily Miscellania management for more money

This, we can all agree on.

5k for me, you’ll get it soon

Hahahaha
---
And he's doing not even one of those things. 
---
This sounds so awesome tbh. Is this the actual skill or a player suggestion?
---
This is a link to a chicken being shot with a shotgun.
---
Diaries, or maybe base stats? Like base 70 or 80 or something.
---
That was probably the best reaction I've heard of from someone not originally interested in pking and getting killed gave them the idea that it would be cool! That's dope =p
---
Ah yeah the old slippery slope fallacy 💯 classic reasoning right here ✓
---
You get anima seed, that's good enough for a boss you will pretty much always get from just doing a few farm runs and the boss is extremely easy. The extra seeds are a bonus 
---
Personally I think Jagex should just fix their damn UI, and they clearly want to. But there’s just too many autists in the community who are scared of change.
---
Lol 0.08% of the community uses alts. It's not an issue. 
---
iv been pked twice... and although i'm lvl 105 combat and most of the pkers are too low to matter... occasionally a 105 pker will come by and destroy me... now I just world hop at the first sign of a pker that level...
---
Yeah for sure, but its absolutely unbearable to do wilderness activities when you don't have those things. Not saying it should be freely accessible to everyone, I just think the sheer amount of pkers you have to avoid is ridiculous.
---
Yep. The age of people playing the same game for 5-10 years is over. Everyone is onto the next game after 6months - 1 year.
---
Look at Fortnite, Call of Duty, the last few Halos etc. They're huge for about a year, maybe two, then everyone migrates to the next game that comes out. 
---
The game is capped to 50 FPS so it doesn't make any difference
---
Definitely, I’ve taken to turning all my chats off when using mobile so people don’t think I’m ignoring them.
---
Oh no you have to right click now..
---
anima seeds are very very good, especially kronos. that and the bucket alone is more than enough incentive imo
---

I like this man! Well done! 
---
Kys furfag.
---
Atleast do it for ironmen that have a mute
---
Will do 
---
My friend finished the whole grind in 2 hours... I was pissed, I'm in your camp, it took me two days of grinding, half the time at dragon defender. 2000 tokens alone for dragon.
---
You're not considering you can restore twice as much Prayer per inventory slot than you can HP.
---
If you're using Brews to restore HP, then you're going to bring Super Restores, anyway, so recovering your Prayer is entirely incidental. Bringing extra Brews is completely unnecessary.
---
Very nice. I'm going to make thieving my phone wallpaper. Cant wait!
---
watch out here comes the angry skillers' downvotes 😂
---
FeelsGoodMan
---
We need to poll these ideas first 
---
Couldn't people just take the exisiting code and add it to their Runelite anyway?
---
how about if you post something original for once
---
How is it doing these days? I read it until Tartaros arc os what was it called now but was dissapointed on the too fast story telling  
---
For 40-50 easy basic quests.
---
I saw it all. But it's still more impressive having to do that at f2p speeds 
---
You just shouldn’t feed trolls like this loser right here.
---
OSRS is arguably in the top 5 Most populated and active MMO’s out today. 
---
It’s not going anywhere anytime soon. 
---
That's why I voted no. 
---
Give me what Runelite does or fuck off entirely. 
---
My best advice: dont use sound!!! Look at his back right leg and if it lifts up its a range attack if it stays on the ground its mage. Watch videos and try to call out the prayers so u get used to the animations 
---
Do people ever actually clap after every word in real life? I'm trying to imagine it and it reminds me of kids proselytizing in the quad before class.
---
Not if u write the scripts
---
does this random offer any unique rewards? just the outfit?
---
alright thanks man! 
---
Yeah let’s just spend an hour writing a script for a 4 minute quest.
---
Which is exactly why it would be good there. You can restore twice as much Prayer per inventory slot, so needing less food means more room for Prayer Potions/Super Restores.
---
I don’t play the game all that much; I just get little spurts where I play for a whole day, then won’t play it for a few weeks. I don’t think I’d be as dedicated to making money as you guys are.
---
Plus, if I was a member, I’d want to explore the map and not have to worry about losing everything if I don’t meet the weekly gold requirement. Runescape for me is about being able to jump in and pick up where you left off on your grind towards a goal. I didn’t get very far back in 07-08 (only reached like lvl 63), and I just recently hit lvl 61.
---
cool unlock on collection log though
---
Nice post
---
If u have mad scripts u can crank put alts bro. Saves time in the long run
---
Tbh people are just easily offended nowadays. Some random dude saying something to u on a game isnt a big deal
---
Mammal?
---
The only power skilling i ever did on my ironman was 60-70 mining on iron ores.  Everything else I collected resources that i have used or will use for other skills.  The only skill that i've had to buy things from shopscape for has been smithing a bit since mlm doesn't give enough ores for 99 and also did charter ship crafting for about 1.5m exp.
---
It's not EHP but it's a lot more enjoyable doing it this way.
---
They should be happy someone is fucking with them haha. They spend hours grinding for something that has zero value in life. 😂
---
I just wanted to say that I am a working man also, I work time at 58 a week and still attend classes 3 nights a week for 3 hours each. I still play. They made a mobile app. It’s pretty cool to still get to play some rs on my breaks. If $11 isn’t worth it to you, then maybe it’s not the game for you. 
---
There’s literally no statistical data about what percentage of what RS community is toxic, and your “statement of truth” is really just what you personally think is true. Pretty sure it’s just meant to be a joke though and you took it more serious than you should have.
---
The point is which you autismos failed to understand, is that what he said is incredibly false. Just cause you play 15 hours a day doesnt mean you're more likely to DC thanm someone who plays 30 mins.
---
Can he not just do what he wants? If he enjoys it why stop him because you don't?
---
I'd have to do more math for all the bosses where it's used.
---
In any case, if it's not overpowered or anything, then I really wonder why people are voting no to it.
---
I, for one, welcome our new magical overlords. Take my upvote and support. Warding 2019!
---
Does any RuneLite plugin allow you to not show them?
---
Lmaoooo
---
You can start dropping your inventory, pick up the pet, and keep it as one of your 4 items. That requires you be good and think instead of begging for your life though so it probably doesn't happen often lol. 
---
You don't have pking skill if you kill clue hunters, the moment they see someone in gear those guys log.
---
&gt;implying clues give massive rewards
---
Well there's very few places you can get items worth 700m.
---
Not really interested in your opinion on clue scrolls. The point is risk v reward. If you want some reward, you have to take a risk. I'm not talking about losing items on death. He's crying about being "forced" to the wilderness. He isn't forced.  You want clue scroll rewards, you might have to go to the wilderness. 
---
Perm banning people and making them lose the account they care about will just encourage them to make new accounts and suicide bot on them or go ham harassing people.

Temp bans are much more effective in getting actual players to stop breaking the rules
---
He plays how he wants. You don't own the world. He can play how and where he wants. You don't have a right to certain spots or squares.

Okay? 
---
herd it here folks 99 cooking in f2p is better than 6.5k ehp 2 max accounts 2 ds2 alts almost 4 99 mining, 1.5b xp
---
Yet the chance still exists. So why not? Its 1 freeze and a few auto atks. Costs next to nothing for a chance at decent loot
---
Boots only give half protection because one foot is amputated.

Isn't this the same thing as invention in RS3?
---
Get a better job. I don't know why you're not. 
---
People lose their minds about the dumbest garbage in terms of powercreep.
---
We have powercreep. We will continue to have it so long as new content is released. But it should be slower than what the Blowpipe introduced. It was crazy on release and went into absolute turbo mode with Rigour. The fact that it out DPSs BiS melee with Overloads and Turmoil back in the day is just comical.
---
The bad part is that with the massive HP monsters we have now, nerfing the Blowpipe would really hurt. However, I'm fine with that in order to bring the overcreep down to reasonable levels. 1 more max hit on melee? Sure. +50% DPS over all other ranging methods bar another overpowered weapon? Why.
---
Actually, these Ads pop up off the basis of searching OSRS on search engines.
---
I’ve never once in my entire life of playing Runescape (been playing Jagex games since slime wars when Runescape was being teased as a future release) looked up buying accounts or bottling &amp; see these stupid ads all the time. 
---
These Ads get triggered by searching up OSRS Wiki or Videos on YT. 
---
It was like maybe two weeks ago
---
I didn't know I was replying to you, sorry XxsitkidxX
---
That’s not even close to bis at kbd. U don’t need all that shit there. With a dhcb or lance I’ll do twice the dps even if ur naked
---
This is why I didn’t want to say anything, because I knew I’d get criticized. Sorry that I’d rather work an easy job and have more free time for studying/entertainment while I’m in college
---
You have no idea what their skill level is just because they picked off a clue hunter.  Clue hunters can log just as easily.  That’s not an argument.
---
Because the rewards are for completing the entire diary. You need 68 farming to show that you have mastered the western provinces area content to a high enough level to be granted the hally from the elves.
---
If you're bringing max gear to KBD you're doing it wrong. If you have max gear then you should be doing a more profitable boss like vork or zulrah. If you wanna do KBD bring dragon Hunter crossbow and black dhid you'll be fine 
---
Lots of people to to chin areas to kill other pkers hunting chin hunters, and other pkers go there to kill those pkers.
---
Someone got a baguette up their ass...

Q
---
for what?
---
Way more likely that the person spending 3+ days to inconvenience others is the sweaty nerd but ok
---
That's how I did it, so absolutely yes!
---
Amazing! 
---
Why is this worthy of a report? Just curious 
---
Programmer here, I'm on the case.
---
The bank highlights is a good idea
---
So they don't have to work on something else =P This is probably ready to go or easy to do.
---
Alright ill go get a giftcard. Wish me luck haha
---
Why would I be embarrassed? It's an anonymous reddit account, only a couple of irl friends even know my reddit name. You're a fucking melvin lmfao.
---
Camp the range prayer, you’ll miss less switches and if you need to learn to lure the healers so they can’t hit you once they’re tagged.  I had trouble with jad till I learned those two tricks
---
Good luck friend, see you out there
---
Costs next to nothing? People waste more than 10k in runes.
---
Tell you something mate, even if there was a way to view a player's inv and they had nothing, they are still going to pk them for no reason.
---
Can't afford either of those 2... Zammy Hasta is good enough then...
---
You need to realize there are others who have opposite opinions..
---
Though polls need to be locked for people who don't use the content. Their no votes when they don't have a idea is annoying.
---
I personally don't care at all about what people say in chat. The point is that all of those are reportable offenses that you can banned or muted for.
---
The point of the bond is to make the player stop pickpocketing long enough for the knight to become killable.
---
Aww, is the baby mad he didn't get the upvotes?
---
You can do this in the vanilla client.
---
Go to your settings tab, and in one of the sub-tabs, there should be 2 dropdowns. Set NPC attack option to "Left-click where available"
---
Haven't progressed super far so I dont know about when it comes to bossing and stuff. But I haven't really experienced it myself.
---
That’s actually an in game option, i believe it’s under settings but I’ll go check
---
Not sure if you noticed but this game is about 10% lore and 90% pop culture references.  To me it seems you just don’t like the game in general.
---
I agree.  The male Armadyl helm looks absolutely ridiculous.
---
I'm saying that those "pkers" will run when they see a geared pker yet they try to act tough on ungeared people.
---
Stop. Think before you speak.
---
You can see him putting them down and he just stays there unlike the people actually using the altar who are running to do their trips.
---
pk-ers are bullies, and the fact that jagex actually make content to lure people into situations where they may be easier bullied, is just sad...
---
I can't see Summoning like it was in RS2 would ever pass, it was just too game-changing overall. I loved dung myself, but again it was a minigame with OP rewards disguised as a skill. But I really want a raid/minigame as similar to dung as possible (non-linear progression) which mid-level players also can participate in and enjoy.
---
I got it 1 kc

---
low iq comment
---
Was wondering why this argument seemed so long. If you don't use supplies to heal your hp, with blood barrage/sgs being used instead (THUS HP IS 0 SLOT), then ely would be better, as by bringing divine all you are doing is burning through prayer points necessarily. The divine is NOT worth bringing to almost any content except pking.
---
I can't believe you've done this.
---
Someone didn't play RS before summoning lul
---
Jamflex bamboozled again
---
honestly, no. i don't think it's that simple either. i think adding very high requirements to guaranteed bosses to make them less accessible (i.e. 200 qp and ds2 for vorkath) is a sufficient handicap such that it doesn't need to be overall less gp/h. any nmz botted account can go bandos and do just fine, should it really be better gp/h than vork?
---
Since when can you press a button on your keyboard to spec?
---
The only thing that matters to poll voters is whether the addition of warding would increase or decrease the amount of dead content. If warding does not make salamanders and trouble brewing useful, then it's a bad addition.
---
Golden gnome nomination effort. Good man.
---
I am betting the majority of the no votes are people who don’t even know who he is. Instead of just saying his name they could give a little reason on why so many people want him removed. 
---
Banks tags are literally this but better, with yours you still have to look for the item in the bak, with tags you just go to the tab or search for the tag and get all the items in the same screen.
---
This is no different than taking a screenshot and opening it up on the side.
---
I dont know why but brainlet memes cripple me every time
---
I agree with your sentiment, you were able to word it constructively and in a manner that doesn't attack others with needless ad hominems.
---
The person and whom they were arguing with were the epitome of what everyone hates about both sides- Those saying pvp is just consisted of people who hate pvm and vote no to all updates just to spite people. And those saying PVM is low skill, and that pvm is consisted of people who hate pvp and think all pvpers are low-life assholes who only want to grief.
---
Both arguments are closed minded and just plain wrong- the community is tired of hearing them and its leading only to further divide and not a plan to bring us together so we can all work on suggesting content that fulfills the advancement in the game that we all seek.
---
So because there are other out of place NPCs, that makes this out of place NPC a good thing? What kind of logic is that? How does your brain operate?
---
and don't be surprised by people call you crybabies 
---
At first it seems like a good solution but once you think about all the UI frustrations it will cause it's probably better this fails
---
Just use bank tags and their corresponding tabs
---
Is it hindsight when it's how most hc die and how he died on his first one?
---
This lmao. 
---
Ironically, PVM and PVP clans/guilds aren't the most new-friendly. Expect a lot of elitism from these folks, I'd recommend you make friends and join casual chats.
---
You're more likely to find people similar to yourself in more casual environments. I'd start off in smaller twitch streams or a publicized RS discord!
---
If you’re doing herb runs you may as well keep doing them. Tree runs are obviously best xp for effort though

---
Can a bot edit all OSRS Fandom pages and replace them with the OSRS.runescape.wiki?
---
&gt;Yes or no, a skip question vote is the same as abstaining and accepting the victor as the best choice.
---
Yep.
---
&gt;By skipping the question you've voted for whatever side succeeds, even if it's worse.
---
Nope. Your abstain has no effect on the outcome of the vote. Sure, you're basically supporting whoever wins, but since you don't have an effect on who that is, your "support" isn't decided until the vote is decided. 
---
You've put together the idea of supporting the decision making process of other people and the idea of supporting one side of that decision. Supporting the winner is accepting and supporting the outcome decided by other people. In this case, supporting a side that happens to win is significantly different than supporting the winner, because you have the ability to affect the outcome. 
---
We generally show support for a side of a vote by voting yes or no. In this case, showing support for the winner by accepting the outcome is appreciably different showing support for the winner by taking part in the vote itself.
---
name checks out
---
that isn't many... Completing ToB as a HC is a huge accomplishment.

Ah ok thanks!
---
It’s pointless to use on bursting. You’ll always hit on the burst-able monsters as is regardless of your magical accuracy; that’s why prayer gear can be worn over magical gear.
---
much like your comment
---
Also bring risk

what do you mean by camp the range prayer

I thought he had said his Internet was dropping a lot off stream?

You can click the HP orb to use antidotes/antipoison.

You click the prayer orb to quick pray.

You click the run orb to run.

You click the Special attack orb to...

Can you finish the sentence? This is one of the most intuitive and common sense actual QoL updates from the patch. The fact that PvP kept the game layout from evolving is crazy.

thats fine if you THINK its the slowest skill, but agility is slower, which is a fact.

“Almost nobody would do DS2 or regicide” yeah totally buddy. lmfao

oh really? This is what I was referring too being non-sense.

and I see your concern with new players and forcing a change on them. Perhaps the best solution was to not cater to any one specific group and give updates for everyone.
---
Try submitting a big report about it
---
Jagex HE GOT THE DROP Jaxex OSRS OSRS B0aty HCIM
---
Just Pray Ranged until you see him use a magic attack instead of staying on whatever he used last.
---
It already did with other interface features, such as banking and account tab.

I want to point out that I'm not a supporter of this change.
---
I mean you can sustain a bond off of just buying battlestaves with elite done. Pretty nice imo

I'm so confused about this fucking sub. People cry and bitch when a boat and pub are added in two areas because it ruins their nostalgia, yet support warding which will be f2p that add additional features to f2p? The fuck
---
In context of the past month or so. But he hadn’t dc’d in a while
---
it's the first links that appear if you use google to find what you need, don't gotta be a prick about it

yeah, well people don't have to be crybabies either

doesn't work if you're looking up quest guides

Damn, regardless that blows. Just got the DWH drop too.

No it wasnt, rofl. You dont know what youre talking about because youre ignorant. It was about BOTH the house and the boat. Clueless noob. Ignorant fool.
---
I think I did it in 07' in my first attempt 89 ranged 70 prayer. Ended in 1 SR 1 SB and 1 RP. 
---
True, if you want better tasks and more efficient points/EXP then Konar is not the slayer master for you.
---
This.
---
Impressive runecrafting for f2p, and I like that I can tell you've only done the knights sword quest for that smithing lol
---
Lol noob
---
Honestly I'd love to see Warding happen. However, I doubt any new skill will pass a 75% poll, that's a lot to ask for. 
---
Why revert them in PVP areas? That sounds like it would create a lot of confusion.

you drew that correlation literally the last comment lmfao.

This is dumb. HCIM is about to die, they can just pull the plug on their internet and be safe from an otherwise 'unavoidable death'. Nah, no support.
---
People want to prevent luring, and the replacement they are proposing won't solve the issue in the same way the ditch has.
---
A warning popup doesn't actually stop your character from moving in the same way a physical object does.
---
Furthermore, it failed four times already, so people are sick of it being repolled.
---
Invention in RS3 was massively helpful in revitalizing their economy. OSRS is going to need something similar someday.

All I want is an amulet named Skype that I can use to speak to Joel
---
Source: Common Knowledge, change is bad.
---
So this is basically a skill between runecrafting and crafting that’s a no from me :). 
---
Yeah you can totally fight back against a fully geared pker after being drained of your supplies fighting a boss. 
---
Unpopular opinion: I think they should just add warding without a poll and take the blame, because people sometimes don't know what is good for them or is good for the game.
---
wasnt the point of his post tbh
---
to be fair, this became a thing maybe 2 years ago and was never talked about ever again. Newer players had no way of knowing this
---
Just pray lol
---
Just rag pkers instead of spewing toxicity to them. It's more effective.
---
'If it seems too good to be true, it probably is'
---
What the fuck are you even talking about? The pk community was clearly not the reason it didn't get voted in. It's failing right now even though the current proposal doesn't affect pvp at all.
---
You sir, are delusional
---
1750s are locked by a main and pures clan but not accepting money for protection, just PVM/PK anyone not in clan.

sorry about mouse constantly moving, i created this on my note 8 via remote desktop

at zulrah aren’t recoils/RoS pretty much required?
---
let retards be retards
---
Salty pkers are the reason we get so few quality of life updates like this. It's literally faster to fkey and click spec bar than it is to click the spec orb. Why do pkers even give a shit? It only serves to make the game more consistent but noooo muh pvp skillz will be devalued even though you can just learn whichever new method comes out. This doesn't even change any pking methods so idk man. 
---
Needed to be, “Connection lost, attempting to reestablish.”
---
fanatic\*
---
The ironspeak amulet should be a reward for killing a hardcore Ironman
---
But a Tbow and a crossbow are still more profit, because the loss is incredibly minimal with both.
---
It doesn’t matter though, because when people are bitching about BP being “OP,” I’m pretty sure they’re not talking about Raids. If they’ve ever been there, they’d know the weapon wasn’t OP at that specific content. 
---
"Lol wut" he says with fuckin skulled flair lmao
---
nope. 
---
Really you voted no because it’s old content....
---
How is it Jagex's responsibility? They have no control over their users' connection, and have no way of telling when someone has dced. Even if some sort of failsafe was technically possible, it would end up being a major waste of resources for something only important to a minority of players in a minority of situations.

I'm not sure what he expected, it was so fucking obvious he was going to die again. Everyone does. DC's happen all the fucking time, and it already had happened to him with his first hcim. 
---
Too bad i don't have d boots to compare it with
---
HC ironman is pointless, everyone is gonna die to a DC and get real mad
---
&gt;gam already too eZsCape
---
this, but unironically. literally anything that makes the game easier from an execution perspective is bad. the game is simple enough (execution wise) that it never ever needs to be made easier in any way. 
---
Oh my god back in the day when osrs began and you HAD to do them I got this random during Regicide whilst I went through the Pass and was in Elven lands. Nek minut teleported to Lumbridge and basically had to restart the quest ffs
---
rip that channel

He’s the one who said he plays a lot less than boaty so he has less of a chance to dc retard

Hi everyone! To you who came to my show, thank you so much! I had a blast hosting it and I'm glad you seemed to enjoy it! I now have a clan chat where I will announce my future shows as well, feel free to join! Also, as the title said, screenshots would be very nice to have to share here on Reddit. I couldn't concentrate on taking any myself but if anyone took any, please send them to me and I might use them as PR for my next show! Or share them yourself if you want to! Anyways, I'll continue writing jokes and try to keep the quality at the same level. Maybe I'll see you around GE w. 302 while I'm practicing!
---
You purposely let the healers kill you instead of waiting 2 more seconds after jad died? That's your own fault man. It's not a bug. You were told to survive the fight caves and chose not to. 
---
Thank you!
---
That's against an npc, not a pker. If you're killed by another player I'm fairly sure you lose all untradables past 20 wilderness and I'm sure that includes pets.
---
Why don’t those lances look like swirly come penises???? 
---
cmonBruh
---
hahahahaha how the fuck is dailyscape cancer hahaha nigga just don't log in like nigga stop playing haha
---
Exactly. Easiest solution would be to have a DC tab that you can click and teleport to house just like house teleport but would also automatically click it on DC.
---
This was my guide for ______. Kthanksbye
---
r/rareinsults
---
Love it
---
You can open your 'items kept on death' interface and check for yourself lol. If you pick up the pet then it can count towards your 3+1 items kept on death. If you have the pet following you then yes it is 100% lost. But if you pick it up then it just counts as a normal item.
---
It still there, its just in the back.
---
I do. If I'm looking up a quest guide, I want a quest guide. Not a spade.
---
&gt;is just mot worth it and is silly
---
ok, so if you don't think it's worth it then don't pay and don't play. the people who do think it's worth it will continue to pay, and play. if there aren't enough people who think it's worth it, then jagex will lose money and realize they have to change their business model. the nature of business models is that they respond and change to financial incentive and not "hurr durr i don't think this is worth it". clearly their model is working cuz they're profitable af.
---
Since barbarian assault is an old piece of content, it would take a lot of time to actually improve. But yeah something needs to be done about that
---
I stand by you on this. I have a "work as little as you need to" mentality so long as you're working towards something better like getting a college degree. Working standard low wage jobs has always drained the life out of my soul, I'd rather work 10hrs a week and be able to enjoy myself and get the work that *really* matters done, and done well. 
---
Yeah I pk. Show me one comment where I complained about poll results
---
But you can't trade for the pen so why are you asking
---
The last discord I joined in a clan they tried to hack my account. So I’m never gonna use discord ever again, idk why people try to hack accounts using discord by befriending you,.
---
It's incredible the lengths some people go on this game.
---
I'm sorry, what the fuck, is he tick perfecting every single attack
---
Yeah I’ve heard the jmods say the code for BA is awful, but I would think this would pass a poll with flying colors
---
Couldn't you just teleport. Lol
---
I'll admit I wasn't certain on this one so I only took one pet, although I was fairly confident nothing happens to your untradeables if they are one of your 3 items. 
---
As you can see I kept my pet and barrows gloves https://gfycat.com/MeanBasicCormorant
---
He’s talking about blast furnace, don’t know why he has a picture of the moll though.  
---
You do know mentioning the fact that he's being playing since 2002 is irrelevant and that's my point
---
1. Make the keyword literally anything else that you could want.
---
2. Move into the year of 2004 and bookmark this subreddit and stop googling websites.
---
Thank you for explaining this! 
---
kthnxbay
---
why is it a spade
---
Come on, dude... It's not hard to understand the same person doesn't make every single comment on the sub. Different people comment with their own unique opinions on things.
---
Yeah that's what I was confused about lol 
---
Sadly at work I can only access the fandom site; the new one is blocked for whatever reason :(
---
I never wanted to do it cause I only had 35 agility at the time, but it was a breeze for me. Finished it in about an hour and 15 minutes. Guess I just got super lucky
---
Shit Bwana, that's all you had to say
---
He didn't dictate what will or won't be, he just said he thought it'd be worth thinking twice about making the joke.
---
Clearly didn't read I see
---
I know that hating on rs3 is suppose to be funny n all but try not to seem too toxic. It kills the joke
---
&gt;How is it Jagex's responsibility to create failsafes?
---
because losing connection to the server is a thing that happens.
---
&gt;They have no control over their users' connection, and have no way of telling when someone has dced. 
---
that isn't true, they can tell relatively quickly depending on what caused the dc.
---
&gt;it would end up being a major waste of resources for something only important to a minority of players in a minority of situations.
---
twitch is one of their big sources of advertisement. ofc yeah, it would possibly be a lot of dev work but yknow youd think theyd put effort into maintaining content they've released like an entire new game mode. 
---
Jagex likes to make decisions around if its economically efficient to change something, rather than if its worth it from the player perspective. not efficient to work to improve the hcim-dying from things out of their control-problem but from a gameplay perspective seems like an obvious necessity. 
---
It’s not a power creep you idiot lol, Jesus fuck even if it did pass you would never be able to afford one or use one anyways 
---
Oh no not toxicity
---
Me too, first drop was at 81, got a guthans spear back when it was worth crazy amounts
---
Same, guess I should have put it together after reading about unavoidable deaths from lag at Vork and then never experiencing it myself. Every time I lag during acid phase I cringe a bit expecting to get stacked out but it never happens.
---
There's no difference, one is a subscription and is by month, a bond is a one-time 14-day membership. Both give full members to rs3 and osrs 
---
and yet melee still falls behind ranged
---
Snuggly quest is better
---
Lvl slayer till 75 and do gargoyles, they are pretty afk with guthans and you never have to bank for anything but super combat.
---
Do you have to do Bone Voyage to get skeletal wyverns?
---
Congratz, you can afk kill mobs
---
What if you saved up and paid for year during a promo? Then during that year you could make mills to buy bonds after that year is up and keep it going.
---
Fair enough, fair enough.
---
very possible, however its pretty obvious- boatys had huge peaks during certain content, eg inferno on his series account, he had similar huge peaks during his first few days of hcim bandos flicking, and he maintained that far above avg viewcount. He's said many times since hcim was released that end game hcim pvm content is easily the best osrs content right now, his own opinion even.
---
good thinking mate
---
read what you said to me lad. 
---
Jad is easy its the hour before it takes that sucks
---
&gt;If it's not so rare and is so easy to get, why don't you show the class your Chaos Elemental pet and prove to everyone how it's not so rare.
---
I don't hunt pets, and as a result haven't done much chaos elemental. You can see on the wiki that it has a drop rate of 1/300- which is one of the highest rates of any pet. 
---
&gt;Or accept the fact that theres no profit in killing someone who receives a rare pet that will not drop for you. Yes you argue for valuable drops, but people tend to keep their most valuable items and only bring the barest essentials. 
---
We have no idea what else OP was risking from the information available the screenshot. They could have been in rags or they could have been in riches.
---
People keep 0-4 of their most valuable items when they die(depending on skull and prayer). That doesn't mean that they won't have anything else of value. This is especially true at a boss, where loot accumulates quickly.
---
&gt;If you're killing people grinding on chaos elementals and making gold that way then you must be in a really tough bind. 
---
Chaos Elemental lies between the Obelisk at level 50 wilderness and Scorpia's lair - two common PKing locations for teams and solo PKers. There's no indication from OP's screenshot that the person who killed them was exclusively hunting those at Chaos Elemental, and very well could have just taken the opportunity to go after someone they happened upon. There's also nothing to indicate that they were even at the Chaos Elemental when they were killed - they could just as easily have been making their way to the Obelisk or the lever when they were taken out.
---
&gt;Because you can't possibly be PKing unskulled people for profit since they're not risking their most valuable stuff where as skulled players would drop everything including their fancy Toxic Blowpipe which sells for 4.5 mil. That'd be stupid and a waste of time.
---
Yeah, this is hilariously untrue. Just because someone isn't skulled doesn't mean they don't have risk. Someone killing Chaos Elemental could have mysterious emblems, runes/ammunition, or more expensive items like dragon 2h swords or dragon pickaxes in addition to the gear they bring with them. Just because you're not getting their most valuable items doesn't mean you're not getting anything worthwhile. Smaller(100k-250k) kills add up quick.
---
Unskulled people in the wilderness generally do have a risk that makes them worth killing. This holds true for people training prayer at the altar to people killing revanants to people doing bosses or skilling in the wilderness. You don't need to have a multi-million coin risk to be worth killing.
---
&gt;so you MUST be killing them for a challenge. 
---
That's some pretty poor reasoning. Most people go after people in the wilderness for fun and for profit. The only times challenge comes into play is against other PKers or against people who are good at tanking. 
---
&gt;You're clearly not doing it for experience either
---
I mean, you certainly could be. It's a lot safer and forgiving to learn PvP mechanics against people who don't fight back. It gives you an opportunity to practice things like switches without the risk of dying if you slip up. 
---
&gt;"It's just the wilderness, it's meant to be like this!"
---
Have you even been PKing?
---
Keep it up dude, looking forward to the next show.
---
You can average 50 kills a day at least with 2 hours playtime 
---
I didn't stop playing back in the day because of power creep or the adding of stuff above t70/t75, I stopped because of bullshit like free trade removal, wildy removal, and EoC itself
---
And I asked how much is too much. Literally nothing to do with DCing. Jesus dude it's not this serious. Now I'm a retard? Are you 15?
---
I mean, you just get your diary rewards from him and literally never talk to him again.
---
noone cares its a 300k drop
---
Runelite plugin in 3...2....1...
---
Mobile only ironman here, i voted no 
---
Bro this is hilarious I died laughing 😂😂😂
---
I am very impressed by the level of effort in this post, but I am amiss as to why we need another new skill, where we could bake the basics of warding into other skills to introduce new ways to train and to shake up the experience they provide 
---
Yeh but you only have to put those on for the snakelings, those aren't around for the whole kill.
---
Vote no to warding
---
Just drop it  its not passing
---
Its much better on task but I wasn’t.  
---
Introducing the essential oils armadyl helm.
---
At that range the pellets wouldn’t scatter, they would act more like a slug.
---
Now now, don't be jealous of that guy. He obviously has a ton of free time to not have to worry about playing at max efficiency. Wish I was as lucky as him.....
---
Gay
---
I don't think it's a bad idea, I just think that we don't really need a new skill before we fix the fact that most skills we have right now are kinda useless. A lot of warding's potential features could be put in existing skills to help solve that.
---
Experiments are fine, 100hp, low def &amp; afk
---
Vork/Zulrah are equalizers for casual players. I only have the time to play OSRS an hour or two everyday but can still make decent money over time grinding them while making money consistently at GWD is only possible for the 12+h/day player. I spent a month grinding out Sara GWD and only managed to two sara swords and a shard whereas a month of Vork at this point is 100m+ profit for me. 
---
I wouldn't mind locking zulrah/vork behind say high-level slayer akin to cerb but removing them entirely and only allowing GWD type drop tables will mean that the only way for a casual player to make a decent amount of money is to get lucky - whereas the playing rs all day camp still makes as much money as they would doing vork/zulrah.
---
I need to know this
---
How come there are no ore rates for motherlode mine that I can find anywhere? Only thing I can find is the nugget %, but no info on the chances of each ore.
---
And it’s your choice to pk naked players. You want to get good stuff from pking, go to pvp worlds and hone your skills there. Pretty sure you won’t find a lack of pvpers.
---
So he doesn't get hacked...?

It's taken plot armor way too far so it stopped being enjoyable for me

I have a problem with the early grouping of [rune,mystic,green dhide] [granite,blue dhide,...] [Dragon, obsidian, red dhide] [barrows, black dhide, ....] The dhide is hella out of place, especially by the end. 
---
That must be it

It's still weird tho 80 at 60 prayer?

Goothicks
---
Struggling mightily with understanding how to do the farming in Garden of Tranquility. Do I have to keep traveling back to each place I planted something to make sure they don't die? Should I be using water or ultracompost or something on them?
---
Nah, it’s over the top and the colours don’t suit the rest of the game. Most newer content in general has a slightly brighter and more pastel tone. One of the only newer weapons that looks like it fits right is dragon claws, sword and maybe the elder maul, though even that looks a little too out of place. Much better though. 
---
ACB is fine but dragon hunter looks... eh
---
I can’t pinpoint what it is but it’s like watching First World War footage with someone green screened in. Just they don’t sit right. 
---
I honestly never even thought of this
---
its maybe because arma cbow looks fucking good atm

You're welcome brother :)

If you pick up the wyrm bones and kill off task an average wyrm kill is like 6-7k each raw value. You also get several dragon daggers and rune items, among blood and soul runes. I use bracelets of slaughter when doing Konar Wyrm tasks and usually get 600k-1.8m depending on drop table luck for a task of about 190-220 kills.
---
Kurasks are still way better if your plan is making raw GP, but wyrms are 8 slayer levels lower and can be more profit depending on luck.
---
Blue dragons in taverly are insanely easy..... There's always 150 or some shit.. 
---
Super easy. Don't skip.
---
Good observation lad, and the picture posted is a chicken getting shot at with a bow and arrow.
---
It's a meme
---
The community is autistic and refuses the game to be better 
---
Holy shit. When people said that the difference was "pretty noticeable" I was like "meh, probably a waste of money" Until I saw how fucking insane this shit is. 60hz feels like absolute shit now and I don't think I can ever go back. It's like playing a whole new game. If you're considering getting a 144hz, do it right now, you will not be upset.
---
Use the good wiki you roob
---
Yes, the original RuneScape has gone through Dev stages and become rs3 which is a very different game closer to traditional MMOs in combat style, OSRS started as the 2007 servers and has gone through a vastly different development process. 
---
Oh man lol. Classic.
---
Woah woah woah, there’s a big gap between this and the dude from the Enlightened Journey quest. 
---
After watching some Tetris where ppl press 15times/s+ I actually think that some ppl could break that limit.

Especially since EV did 7 and 8 per tick for quite some time.
---
Na dude kids legit vote no to pvp updates over a lost spade or two sadly
---
Support, but only if its a 50/50 chance
---
You from Toronto?! And you should have been thieving Andy knights

&gt;Now maybe you're saying you bought one of each hat you could possibly find, then checked the stats to each without a outside resource, but I doubt it.
---
uhh yes i did, why would you doubt that?
---
that was back in like 2004, my first language is not english and back then i barely spoke it, barely knew how the internet worked, so yes, yes i bought one of each and compared
---
a little brat and a crotch goblin are the same thing but a crotch goblin is significantly more dangerous as it is generally more menacing
---
Yeah, I'm having the same issue. Didn't think it could be region locked though.
---
There's a sort of running joke in runescape that horses are mythical/don't exist and unicorns are common as fuck. 
---
Metals are a pain though
---
That's some good rng on drop type
---
I PvM. I PvP. I have too many PvM options to reasonably attempt them all. There are countless bosses I haven’t even touched because there are so many. I have so few PvP options I end up killing defenseless players doing RC, wildy slayer, or other wilderness activities with little to no risk. How is that fun? How is that balanced? Every PvP update gets voted on by tons more people who don’t PvP than do. Honedtly, ntil PvP polls require some sort of filter to prohibit non-PvP players from having a say I will take my 4 accounts and vote no on every PvM and Ironman update. 
---
Something like osrs soa

The arclight should be this

Good to know it's not just me at least... Hopefully we get some insight

You can also check his front arms, if he put them above his head it's range attack, if he lifts them below it's a mage attack.
---
I've thought of doing the same thing, but realistically the hackers probably ignore it all when they see it's all coming from the same ip address, so I never bothered. Also I don't know how lmao
---
Can my pure join
---
Yeah but they made it the same attack speed! The fools
---
Me last month

Ahh I didn’t see the 2 weeks bit.  Either of these apply really.

I agree it looks fine, but so did the original graceful and that got changed too
