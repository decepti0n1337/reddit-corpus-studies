Can I get it unpunctuated please?
---
---
---
Insta sold things for med in GE to spit out a coin split, even if that thing never came into the game.
---

---
Resulted in GP becoming worth substantially less over the time it was left in what is now RS3, unchecked (years).
---
Because no one would get the item on coinshare. You would just get the split for the item dropped instead of the item.
---
So basically only coins came into the game.
---
Support. Consolidate pvp mini games to reduce spreading the playerbase too thin
---
The goal of this game was originally PvP and that's what made it popular. It was nuked through shit decisions twice and it drove the player base away. Now we're stuck at 70k players.
---
Stop trying to force this into a PvM game when it's not what made it popular.
---
No chance they are one ticking 8 ways no problem without some sort of auto switch or at the minimum clicking with their keyboard. I’ve one ticked 7 ways but I can assure you it’s not every time.
---
nice keep posting

Yeah same, Jagex wouldn't let me recover my main from 2006 despite me trying to recover it like 10 times between 2011 and 2018. Nobody was on the account either, so not sure why they didn't help. Guess it's lost forever I had to make a new one.
---
Wouldn't the tree... IDK burn?
---
Unrealistic, downvote
---
True, but he did expressly state he was making an f2p alt for f2p Pking. I think it's fair to think he intends to only play it on f2p.
---
But, I may be totally wrong.
---
That's still 3 mil an hour, is that supposed to be bad?
---
I thought the instasell into the he gave the item to the buyer? Just made the process faster and safer
---
That would be the defender role!
---
Honestly, I just wouldn't bother. I'm already playing Runescape 3-4 hours less a day than I used to.
---
I'm 24, work full time, trying to start a family. I play maybe 30mins to an hour a day when I can. Sometimes on weekends I get up to 4 hours, fantastic.
---
Not necessarily Vanilla clients fault but, RuneLite makes things easier &amp; faster for me, and more importantly the data it retains is crucial (xp rates and drop tables etc). I prefer playing OSRS RuneLite edition more than I enjoyed playing Runescape in 2007.
---
You know what they say
---
I feel like id guess higher into the 200m range just by the fact that some pretty commonly owned items or sets are 100m+
---
1900 total, 500m
---
If you ignore what's actually in the quest, which no one does. That isn't my logic at all, as that quest requires much more than 25 range. You're trying to twist my words but you're just wrong. My logic is that it doesn't matter if a higher diary requires less quests than a former one, as it requires that diary anyway. Don't be dumb.

Five hours later, it's the top comic. You did it, u/NoHetro!
---
A third of the tbow was his if they had sold it. This wasn't even a 1b scam, only 660m. This creature literally destroyed his entire online presence (including his OSRS account) for what amounts to $300. Hard to even comprehend how it thought that was worth $300. He can't even PVM/boss with other players now without grinding out or buying a new main.
---
wait I thought it just auto sold on GE. Why would they not do it like that?
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
Make it for WC plz, fuck the "devaluing achievements". I need something that makes the 99 WC i got valuable and not a waste of time
---
So still the best use of Shards if you want to make money, other than potions? No question that divine super combats are the best thing to do with shards, but very few people have 97 herblore.
---
So we can use runelite?
---
No it's not outrageously bad. The abuse of PvP doesn't even compare to the abuse of PvM and skilling.
---
i was using the 3rd party clients...  i switched over and now i got myself 2 def.. Fuck this is what i get for stopping to use the clients ..
---
Not rare enough to do the math on it
---
Jagex’s GE price is rarely accurate anyway. The coin share system didn’t require a counter party to buy the item, it just sold it and put GP in the game.
---
I think Joon the King has a YT Video on it that’s a good explainer.
---
26k accounts have that. Pretty significant amount.
---
Yea it's very possible. Hopefully I'll get enough votes to figure it out with reasonable certainty.
---
Sorry dude, This is definitely a problem Jagex needs to fix.
---
GG
---
One of the main things that got removed from wow was the client knowing where every individual player was at any given time. This meant that people could write add-ons that could tell every member of a raid exactly where to stand to completely negate certain mechanics.
---
Just say, you want to have a family but don’t want to put gaming at a lower priority.
---
At this point of time, if family commitment is more preferred than gaming in terms of life fulfilment. Just let go of the game slowly. Unless you wanna be super man and take on everything
---
So youre blaming the non-pvp community for jagex's sloppy updates?
---
Please, tell me more about how our community is so split and it's all my fault.
---
Upvote and comment to give you attention. I love statistics threads.
---
Sounds like a way to track users with the most wealth and wait for slip ups for personal information that would lead to a phish or hack.
---
They've probably decided that "look up the clue on the wiki" is sufficiently similar that it's not a hill worth dying on.
---
thanks :) will do
---
This reminds me of that youtube video on runescape showcasing that when given the chance, a white guy will steal your shit before anyone else.

I guess he wanted to try out being a solo ironman.

Somehow they don’t understand this basic concept
---
Maybe if you killed jad like a real man, they would be proud of you
---
Well look at all the casuals in this thread who go outside from time to time. Stop wasting xp!
---
People sent just customizing their UI
---
They're changint inputs and theres some plugins that tell you literally where to stand and what to pray and when to click.
---
Like imagine a puzzle boss that you havr to figure out a maze. Welp the 3rd party plugin will do the maze for you.
---
There's also point 3rd party clients that will literally let you interact with all tabs at once(having inventory pray mage and spec bar all clickable as once)
---
There's some that will auto switch for you too.
---
They're basically glorified bots that you have to click for
---
No overall profit if you only get what other players drop. Player A transfers some items to Player B and that's it. Sure, duel arena remains popular like this but that's much higher risk / it's just gambling. There should be some incentive to go pking. When was the last time you went to kill a monster, or play a minigame, without any hopes of a reward? I've heard barb assault can be fun, but I don't need anything there so why waste time? I could go pking and maybe get a kill, but between us both wasting supplies, and maybe having a 50/50 win rate, I would expect a net loss over time.
---
I said wat because the math doesn't work out and it's a strong statement.
---
300m will never be enough to cover the remainder of your gameplay unless your buyable skills are already maxed.
---
Fuck yeah. Sick repost bubz
---
Prostitution. RuneScape girls don't come cheap. Though I hear the male playing female pack is discounted.
---
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted you’re right
---
But... you can still get the diary done before hand... you can do the elite diary diary first and claim the easy reward... then do the easy diary to claim the medium reward... that’s how the game is designed... i.e. I did karamja medium diary first and still got gloves 1...

I find the wording bad, It's an absolute scum move but wouldn't say it's scamming. At the end of the day it's his drop even if they promised to share drops it's not really a scam. It's a risk you take when raiding or bossing with a team  
---
Incoming downvotes but hey just my opinion
---
Anhthing still in runelite is good to go
---
Sure but this would stop you from ever losing chins if you die in any way and I don't think there is going to be a away to have it only work if that was the case. Frankly many of the places chins are used range from fairly op to incredibly op and I'm not sure it should be even better by stopping you from losing chins in the event that you mess up.
---
Ok lol, I’m like 99% that unless that is a scam emulating those updates that it’s just one of those monthly updates. Fair enough tho
---
There’s a comment above yours that explains the math lol
---
Is your attack level even high enough to wield and edge that sharp?
---
For the people!
---
Ironically, I managed to reset the password on an account I didn't own with less information than that.
---
Why? Is it because of religion or something? I remember there was one guy in school that was muslim, because he was circuimsed he always showered with shorts on.
---
Lava runes all the way to 77 for blood runes. If you hate lava runecrafting you can go to ZMI

Don't need support if you don't bot

This wasn't with randoms.

It means you’ve run out of prayer points. With that being said, do you have time to talk about the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints? We have an altar you can use...
---
You act like people never group outside of their clans. If it's someone from another well known and trusted clan you can just report it to them. If its a friend that nobody knows I can just take on personal responsibility for him, ie if he scams a tbow I'll pay out the difference to the rest of the group. If anything coinshare promotes playing with randoms instead of trusted friends, which I don't like. 
---
Also, I told you 9/10 times I can get a group when I want to. You're acting like it's hard to get another 2 people for either cox or tob. 
---
And there is a difference between a couple % of inflation and mass inflation. Coinshare had a massive impact on the economy.
---
You love vork 60 kills in lol you will no longer love vork 1000 kills in. You get really really good at it.

its kind of insane that its come down to making reddit posts but dont give up OP, you could try tweeting at the customer support twitter, maybe they can offer some help. I got locked out of my account when my phone that had the authenticator (and the codes to remove it) on it broke and I couldn't get into my account anymore, the guys on twitter had someone real remove the authenticator and let me set a new one.

Tbh I didn’t even know you could do that, but even so, it seems equally, if not more tedious to remember to withdraw 200 gp, vs just an axe

C bow doesn’t have many uses and low dps due to attack speed. Better off getting and magic shirt bow (I) with rune arrows, basically a budget blowpipe.
---
I'm pretty skeptical of most people, I just go in and establish i'm there for ffa. It takes a real piece of garbage to reap the rewards of others' splits and then log when the drop is in their name.

What the best way to get to Zulrah with a low construction level? So far I’ve been using a summer pie and the fairy ring to practice it but now that I’m comfortable should I use Zul-andra teleports and a ring of dueling to clan wars?

I'm not gonna pretend like an expert, but trioing raids is pretty doable, olm's much more intimidating than he initially seems.

There used to be a world hop timer and they removed it....

Bonds are like paying for someone to buy membership for you. The GP used to buy the bond isn't created out of nowhere, it is transfered from another player, and there is a "tax" to activate traded bonds. It also helps to combat gold trading, that will happen regardless if bonds exist.
---
Be worried when they start implementing cosmetic MTX, that is the start of the end of the game.

I know exactly what I'm talking about.

Care to explain why an AGS disappearing removes gold from the economy?

Once you are 20 levels over on a course, the marks drop 20% less. I would move on to the next one if you’re looking for marks.

yeah lol. it's just dumb. same thing with clues. like who literally gives a fuck lmao. runelite made it so that instead of googling every 3 seconds you are now just getting the information that you would have googled anyway right to you.
---
why
---
They often just give fake "original details"
---
98.2% chance you would have had it by now. RIP.

if he had said he spent all day at GE or something it could be believable, but saying he's staking with those stats means he has probably never staked before, which means he's probably hiding the fact that he did something illegal like RWT

Considering that the army makes me extremely tired and it took like 5 months to get to that point I don't think I'll be able to rebuild that fast unless I buy bonds

Motivation comes from goals in this game.

Finish all medium/hard then elite diaries. I'm on elites ight now and I'm super motivated to play so I can get them done. Try to do x amount of boss kills. Unlock this pool from construction. Get all your stats above 50/60/70/80

I'm in the army and that exhausts me so I barely have time to played. And that money took 5 months to make
---
Lmao yeah right bud.
---
Here's my advice: Move on from this game and go find a new one to play.
---
The support sucks. They don't care about you, you're only $11 to them.
---
Go spend $11 on a new game with an actual support and development team.
---
Good luck!

Fuck off guy I've never seen a phishing link ever before

You gonna give a Nigerian prince your bank account info so he can transfer you money too?

What do you mean? Did anyone get banned for one click Construction, or one click Prayer?
---
Coxie
---
why don't they just put the download link to runelite on the official site? literally no one likes the vanilla client and no one plays on that fuckheap. they might even be losing players because very new players try it on the official client and see how awful it is. 20 fps with 0 features.
---
They could just make Zulrah killable one time without having the requirements in a special instanced version of Zulrah that doesn't drop anything (or it could drop something, it's only 1 kill, gl to first kill ironmen), and if you wanna kill it after that you need to do Song of the Elves. 
---
They did something similar with Smoke Devil for the diary requirement where you didn't need the task to kill it one time.
---
I can almost guarantee you that most deaths while using chins are related to people afking for too long or not rating and getting KO’d by a boss. Server-side DCs really aren’t that common anymore.
---
I've heard of those ones but I've never actually seen them
---
You don't need to use f2p worlds at all.
---
Yeah sure is, I was surprised how many there were.
---

Probably because it’s profitable and fully afk. (Making dart tips/rune plates/legs/2H’s)

well i was speaking for a while after he said that was his main so its not even like he just gave all from another account also im a fairly new player started like a year ago he said he played like 16years ago was this version even out in 2003 i thought it came out in 2007
---
Every world has like 10+ bots with super high mage lvl and like barely any other stats. Their total levels are normally under 1000.

Only if they get found out.

Jagex will never admit it but they can't afford the staff to do actual customer service. Fuckers are so ghetto as a company it's ridiculous. And they're fucking British.

Because you shouldn't be buying them in the first place. It's a punishment for your RWT.

Imagine having to worry about 20m lmao

After removing the prayer icon swapping feature -.- the reason I originally used runeloader and then switched to runelite.
---
Holy shit, he's still going at it.
---
If you visit the main website and look on top of the hat u will see the current player count. Also if you research a bit and try the F2P content you will decide for yourself how grindy game is. If it is not grindy enough try ironman.
---
I've easily lost 500m+ since the GE originally opened doing shit like this. I'm more patient now, but damn.

Just imagine.

I know it's not really advice, but just saying, you don't lose money on items crashing if you don't sell the item.
---
Most likely not. Done about 10 million xp using attas seeds, haven't noticed it being lower than expected (tbf i haven't noticed it being much higher either lol). 6 herbs is the minimum, you're probably just paying more attention to it now than before because you're trying to find a pattern.

But you didn't think to check the URL? Are you new to the internet?

You can find the combat tutors just north of Lumbridge castle next to the wall, they're wearing blue and white clothing. They will give you a sword and shield, or a bow and arrows, or some runes to cast magic.

Blocked out your name, but not theirs. Fucking coward.
---
Bring back 2006 death mechanics but keep instances bosses. This game is too easy.
---
I mean, it would though. Probably why he backed out. I see where he was coming from even if the wording was a little off-putting. I'll be disappointed if the comment ends up downvoted because of a linguistic slip.
---
This would probably severely lower the price of chins as way less would leave the game. This would make skilling even less worthwhile than bossing for any sort of profit. PvM is already 0 risk almost everywhere. You should be at risk if you are using chins to kill a high level boss way faster than it is meant to be (solo). It is actually abusing chin mechanics and [Mod Ash fixed](https://twitter.com/jagexash/status/593095231429414912?lang=en) it but it was met with huge backlash so the change was reverted.
---
“Thank you for purchasing old school bonds! You have been permanently banned for real world trading! This is NOT appealable! Thank you!

I bought mine in April and it's made me like 80M between Vork and BBDs, just ride it out. People are saying that dhl is the meta now but the dhcb method is more accessible so I can't imagine dhcb dropping too far.

just withdraw your cashstack, same amount of effort needed to get an axe lol

Make sure you’re taking care of yourself! In the future try to consume more electrolyte containing drinks or foods. Pickle juice would be good here.
---
Also, were you taking a lot of simple painkillers/fever reducers like aspirin, and/or drinking abnormally large volumes of water?
---
And? What’s your point? It still isn’t a new concept. It’s been around for 10 years. Lots of other content that is in OSRS was introduced after the save file 
---
I never said it was part of the original save file. OSRS has evolved and moved past the 2007 stand point. There’s tons of content that in OSRS that isn’t “old school” - that’s how they keep the game fresh.
---
Depends which kind of kalphites. For the baby ones, you could probably kill them in 2-3 hits each on average. 500 to be safe
---
I see what you did there.

And I wasnt impressed.

I want you to know that I am **completely serious** and am hopeful I can sway(save) you from doing what you're doing.

There are other games out there you can play, tons of games, a lot more fun than Runescape even. You are repeating the same action hundreds of thousands of times and watching a virtual number increase while doing something else on the side/watching a movie or tv show, you could actually be immersed in something and be actually enjoying yourself. On top of this I think you should start going out, there's nothing wrong with you I am sure. Start exercising, go for some walks, just get some air, get off the PC. Theres a lot more to life than Runescape.
---
Please don't listen to these people congratulating you, they have no idea what they're doing by enabling this kind of behavior. Please get away from the game as soon as you can. I don't know how old you are but I can promise you that you are going to regret putting this much time into this game once you get older. I have roughly 20k hours into Runescape and I would take them all back in a second.
---
You will almost always have the number 1 spot for your total level on the Hiscores. That's pretty neat.
---
Lol it's 2019 and you fell for a phishing link.
---
You dont have to have maxed melees to stake, he could have been an odds staker when that was a thing or one of those people that stake with pots on
---
he offered a large bounty
---
Took me second, they drop ashes right? Lmao I love the tricycle head wojak
---
1600 total, under 40m bank.
---
You could do it at low-mid 90s depending on your other gear
---
Try dming the mods on Twitter. It sucks but probabky a good bet
---
Do agility next, I dare you.
---
&gt; Each has 10 charges and trigger 25% of the time, does that mean each necklace should last me on average 40 fail attempts before it breaks? 
---
Correct
---
Great idea
---
I do it all the time lol
---
Just make the game single player and let people play how they want to play. Boom all problems solved
---
4am tomorrow no ty
---
Keep it up! :)
---
Im pretty sure they removed it a while ago. In the meatime let me use osb because i dont click to click mutiple times /s
---
Mmmm don't lie
---
They made 60 million dollars last year. They can afford it. Their corporate overlords won't let them if it cuts into profits
---
Haters will say this is fake.
---
They perma banned my account after i took a break for macroing that I created on mobile osrs and only played on mobile. Took them 5 months to answer me and unban my account
---
You can farm points but not emblems, thankfully a lot more of that gold is going to be leaking into the real player base now though because accounts must be higher than lvl 30 and you can get more targets much more quickly now.
---
Also the pts in the new system are heavily revolved around kill streaks, which is a huge downside for low lvl bh farming accounts.
---
People dont buy bonds for in game money though apart from noobs. High level players buy  bonds in game for membership.
---
It was more of a point that players will always find ways to abuse things set forth by devs. You can't stop this.
---
Bruh I recommend your defender guide to every single noob I meet in BA. Legend
---
Yeah that's what I meant. For instance, when he hits 750 total he will automatically be ranked 1st for everyone with a 750 total level. All the way up to (but excluding) 200m all, which are permanently locked in place.
---
Probably just the standard "use at own risk"
---
&gt; UPON REASONABLE NOTICE TO YOU
---
Wtf is your pray level if you can't manage to take a shit in pray armor before you need to sip?
---
Wow dubber. Things aren't looking good for you fam
---
Not bis gear. Are you woox walking, using piety?
---
Had an account since 07. Hacked 2 years ago. February I finally got access again after a year of submissions. Keep trying friend.
---
Yea most big pk clans have their own clients and bots that scout worlds.
---
Mmm sounds like a lengthy guardians task with slaughters to me
---
I pointed out that i dont have bis gear. And no im not woox walking, for either bp or lance, and im usijg rigour/piety for bp/lance
---
That's a Fletching cape... Which he clearly has a 99 in.
---
funny af

---
Lol.
---
I thought it was in inches and you had a 94 inch waist
---
Exactly, I pugged lv 5 on all 4 roles. 
---
Then I had to go back for a master's clue fighter torso, and was like yeah... Done.
---
Sir pugger is the idiot lmao
---
smackdown commence T-48 hours
---
No? They've banned a client a few months ago that was op in pvp.
---
I'm not trying to paint RuneLite as the villain, I'm just saying because of the open source nature of RuneLite, that deobfuscator was able to get into the hands of almost anybody. I'm not the guy who called RL unethical, that was some other dipshit.
---
Anyways, the issue wasn't just having a deobfuscator - it's highly likely all 3pc still run one. The issue was that it was Open Source, meaning it was easily accessible to other people.
---
I don't doubt Adam had good intentions, but I am annoyed people blindly attack Jagex sometimes. Sometimes they deserve the criticism but back then it really was a matter of fixing cracks before the dam broke.
---
ohhh ok, thanks, yeah I guess I kinda forgot about the mini map too lol
---
Most people probably don’t pay the $11. A small minority pays more than $11 for all of us and then we just give them 10M in game every month. 
---
Jagex is just trying to give all of us the customer service experience you’d expect from a free game while raking in those bond sales.
---
RemindMe! 4 days
---
Money works differently on the other side of the world. This ain't Costco.

ok grandpa, I was wrong thinking it was possible to play video games and also have a social life both online and offline.

oh wait,

---
knew this was bait
---
People do barrows in max.. whats your point? If they enjoy it they enjoy it
---
Jagex you need to migrate into 2019, most companies have a live chat these days, the fact you can't even implement a ticket system is a joke. when will something finally be done? what will it take?
---
This man's in grad school. 1 out of 200 drop chance for that at least.
---
So, are wegoing to talk about your inventory?
---
Think he meant buy in bulk all at once
---
"what the fuck is wrong with ppl"
---
In some other post people were surprised the vanilla client had full screen mode. These are the people who would quit if Runelite was banned lmao
---
:( I've been saving for a lance for raids for like a month now
---
I don't smoke weed. I do meth mom. Get it right. Weed is for pussies.
---
Uhhhhhh m8 what.
---
Shhhh I know I know. I tried so long to line up with a flying vyrewatch. But at least they’re in game wings and not MTX
---
That's a lot of recovery information you just broadcasted buddy. Really hope no one gets a chance to kill your character.
---
Shut up
---
For some skills it will be but so far his EHP is the same as max main. Combats are gonna be aids though. I assume you go for range cannon to 200m first, then HP, and then str.
---
ok boomer
---
It’s bug abuse.
---
Or ya know, obby mauling sand crabs
---
I personally would say best exp would be between Seers or Prif cause of teleports and shortcuts. But I'm a filthy casual so I might be wrong here.
---
I'm working towards a 2nd graceful that's why I wanted marks
---
If they banned that plugin feature somebody would just make a thing like alt1 where you can screenshot the puzzle and it says what buttons to push out loud.
---
Lmao ahh feelsbad
---
I loved nieves death, fucker never stopped assigning me metal dragons and black demons, now bobs death stung a lot.
---
It is without coal bag? Man that would be a crap load of money made for like what- 195m xp?
---
What does them being British have to do with anything? As an American, I can list a dozen companies with terrible customer service...

He's just done it so many times he is at the point where he no longer gives a fuck
---
I emailed this to my dad and his name is Jagex
---
gl kid
---
This is what's keeping me from updating my email on my acc
---
As much as I agree with you, I must play devils advocate. You preach the holy word but everyone gets offended by anything these days so maybe just work on your delivery as to be received better.
---
I have over a 1000 kills with DHCB so that’s over a 100mil profit but the bow still has some value hopefully lol
---
Yes that was considering scythe on rate, ignoring base loot and ignoring kc selling.
---
Good. So when can we expect the official client be improved?
---
That capability is guaranteed to have existed privately for years before Adam even began developing his public tool. In security the rule of thumb is to assume that a vulnerability has been actively exploited for about a year before it was discovered. 
---
Adam's tool likely hurt a lot of the higher end private bot sellers because unscrupulous bot developers with the public tool were able to saturate the market with previously private techniques. Thus generating more data for Jagex to use in their bot detection. This assumes Jagex had a good anticheat team, which they probably didn't.
---
Made 2 bill from this lol
---
Flair checks out.
---
Is that even possible? I know you can do range and str but i wonder if there's something for hp
---
Fucking chud
---
Does the No Weed respawn affect the Micellania patch? Im trying to hop worlds to rake quicker for favor, but it never grows back!
---
Update: only one player can have the stray dog pet at a time. Players feeding the stray dog with bones have a 1/5000 chance of taking the pet.
---
They would just shift click the bones using the other feature. Removing this would impact many more exp boosting activities like 3t fishing and mining where you drop the items.
---
I’ve got over 1000 kills on vorkath so that’s over 100mil profit plus the bow still has some value for now lol
---
I look forward to your 99 thieving.
---
Passively as time goes on, people either stop playing or fall into more efficient shit generally.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Lance is more efficient for various reasons on top of just serving more purposes then a DHCB does. As time went on people transitioned more and more to using Lance due to being more experienced while DHCB stays as the easier way to do Vorkath. Like I would guess if you are going to woox walk, Lance is better but if you are just going to walk that attack out you're PROBABLY better off still using DHCB. Me personally, I would use DHCB because I ain't trying to do that shit.
---
-75M
---
Can't you change your stats while you're staking though?
---
Can I get it without spaces?
---
If the person who currently has the stray dog pet dies with him the pet is deleted from the game forever.
---
Some say that already happened...
---
He
---
Sounds like you shouldnt have botted
---
Pures/zerks are probably 70% of the nmz population. 55 pray doesnt last long in prossy :(
---
Okay now that's funny as fuck. Didn't even notice before jumping to conclusions.
---
Lol, I just take a lot of stuff with me to barrows. :-)
---
The fact that Runelite is compliant with everything Jagex has asked, and they haven't removed the bone menu swap
---
Fuck Jagex I hope it gets shut down
---
Log out log back in
---
Upvoted for true justice.
---
Remind me! 1 day
---
Oh yeah that's smart. I guess you can generalize it into getting information that you're supposed to discern from  a graphical model from text which they don't like
---
Put the mind runes in your rune pouch, and keep astrals and laws/cosmics. You only rarely have to npc contact, so you can just use the runes you get from crafting. 
---
Saves an inv slot for marginally higher xp rates
---
There are programs you can download, but I believe that Runelite allows you to take screenshots too in the top right corner next to the minimize.
---
Nice! What level did you get the screenshot pet at?
---
yep exactly!
---
Same, quit 2 months ago because an account I only played on iOS mobile got locked
---
u/n_ose
---
I see it now! Thank you for that
---
gl, I hope you can find support.
---
agreed
---
No problem bud.
---
something something ok sweaty lets unpack this
---
So you're telling me that a mechanic where player-controlled accounts kill other player-controlled accounts for huge profits is *exploitable?*
---
1% ?
---
I feel like this isn't something he has to worry about for another few years
---
isnt it just 1/droprate ?
---
Nobody getting 200ms has much of a social life
---
Assuming this story is true, this is what makes me timid about really committing to coming back to the game. Literally no customer support and notorious for broken bans. Basically you could get perma banned for something you weren’t doing at any time and have no chance of ever speaking to a real person at jagex to resolve the issue.
---
Lvl 55 mining

If you don’t mind unfuckin your screen shot, showing gear and showing the entire inventory.
---
The deobfuscator isn't the part that makes a bot client function as a bot client, just one of the base tools necessary to build one. The deobfuscator itself isn't the actual problem, it's widespread availability.
---
I'll add the disclaimer: I'm not actually all too familiar with these kinds of programs myself but from what I understand, obfuscators are essentially high quality plastic packaging and deobfuscators are Nippon Steel scissors. It might take 20 minutes to make that plastic but it's worth it because the scissors will take a month.
---
Thanks to how time consuming a deobfuscator is to produce, it's very likely bot creators wouldn't share their own tools that easily. It's a key part of any client and giving other players access to theirs means potential competition.
---
Because Adam's deobfuscator was available readily with RuneLite, it suddenly meant everyone had access to a deobfuscator. This means potential botters formerly unwilling to brute force their way into Jagex's code now had an essential step done. Adam was potentially their golden ticket into the chocolate factory.
---
The reason Adam's tool probably did not hurt existing bot client makers' detectability is that every new botter has to make their own client from the ground up. They most likely didn't know what the other bot makers actually made. This meant programmers with different thought processes come up with different solutions to the same problems.
---
If all of us faced the problem of a baseball flying toward us, each of us would react differently: you might sway it away with your left hand while I lean to the right. Timothy might just take the hit like a man.
---
It would be more obvious that Timothy is a bot if Jimothy, Kimothy, Rimothy, Dimothy, and Bimothy all also took the hit like men. Would you really be able to tell I was a bot and not a player if I was the only one who dodged the baseball?
---
This is the problem with custom botting clients - they don't behave exactly like other bots and the sample size is too small to determine compared to armies of woodcutting suicide bots.
---
The public domain deobfuscator potentially gave way to hundreds of unique botting scripts being used on individual accounts. This was the actual problem - adding too much variability to bots.
---
eh i get what he's saying
---
he's obviously wrong but back in 07, the popular youtubers were almost always pkers. the game wasn't above pvp but it got a lot of people into it i'll give it that
---
Absolutely sick, big gz!
---
Quickest way to get looting bag now?
---
Prif may now be the best course from 80, not exactly sure how it compares to seers
---
Thanks for the advice. I'm praying range, so I assumed my defense didn't make a difference since I am tanking mage hits. I also try to avoid going to busy worlds, since I seem to lag terribly with him. I am definitely going to get rid of the staff and seed though!
---
Damn. Invite me next time
---
Wasn’t trying to be rude.... Think it is funny that skilling isn’t the best way to get materials. Bossing is...
---
"I think he’s pretty entertaining"
---
It seems a lot of people agree with you dude... so there's your answer.
---
It doesn't help that the G.e. has limited slots so selling slow sellers is a pain to sell at normal or higher price.
---
Probably thugs in edgeville dungeon, or skeletons next to the abyss mage (that's a bit more of a hotspot tho)
---
Love the vids, gz!!
---
This is a system inherently flawed though. The concept of "we need content designed to make it unfeasible to fight back so that there's prey players that are easy to kill for us to grief" is under no circumstance an acceptable system. And that is what most wildy content is (I would argue revs and mage arena are not so, but wilderness bosses, agility, black chins, etc. are, with the resource area being questionably so) - funneling non-pkers in to be griefed for the fun of a few pkers.
---
In addition, there's an element you're missing: Those groups aren't only picking on the previous tiers. ALL of them collectively gun down that "bottom rung" of players in the wilderness. Clan scouting bots, any small-medium group, the rare solo tribrid and most commonly the salad/gmaul ragger; all will all dogpile the first person who looks like they can't fight back "because they might have bank on them". In a time when this game was played for fun, the Wildy was more akin to how you described, but these days it's really not so. We live in Efficiency-scape now, and everyone, including pkers, want low-risk high-reward interaction, which is what Jagex is trying to provide when they keep constantly trying to entice people in with no meaningful way of fighting back in most cases. Even in cases where you COULD be arsed to spend the inventory slots risking high-end weapons/armor and other such resources, the odds of you getting ganged up on by 5+ players is high - at which point you absolutely cannot fight back anymore unless you have your own group in waiting.
---
Ask yourself this: How many pking hotspots are designed explicitly for players to fight other players head-on? The Mage Arena comes to mind, arguably the Fountain of Rune as well. But look where most of the pking happens: Wilderness bosses, Rev caves, the Chaos Altar, Lava Dragons, Black Chins. All places where players typically must be geared for a non-pvp activity, to be at a massive disadvantage to pkers roaming around. No one's looking for a fair fight here, they're looking for an easy kill.
---
Of course these people don't want to vote in new toys for these groups to let them grief them even easier than they already can. It's a gatekeeping system - it's an inherently extremely toxic system, and those underlying problems are what needs to be addressed. Skirting the polls and making things progressively more and more imbalanced in favor of the pkers who are already at such a huge advantage isn't going to revive the wildy, it's going to drive off anyone who isn't a bot. Everyone who cries the same fallacious non-argument "then just don't go to the wildy" will get their wish, and it'll be dead for good.
---
As a side-note to that wall of text, I'm glad to have a reasonable talk about this. Thank you :)
---
No relation whatsoever. Not inn oldschool or rs3. Just a coincidence, but it is similar

Jmods dont have to be in office to read and reply to reddit threads? What are on about lol.
---
I had to look this up from the wiki but:
---
&gt;	Magic defence is calculated as 70% of your magic level + 30% of your defence level.
---
You can always hop to w330 for the pool and then back to your preferred world, until you can afford your own pool/teleport. It’s a bit obnoxious though so I don’t blame you for not doing it
---
big gz but he looks a little sick
---
You are correct, though I tried to specify this with "pker-buff". Looting bag droprate doesn't really affect the efficacy of pkers, and rune pouches are useful for everyone.
---
I used a combination of mith darts on swamp crabs and just general slayer/moneymaking to hit 75 ranged and get my blowpipe
---
From that point on ranged levels just came naturally from basically all the PvM I do lol, hit 99 recently without grinding a single level from 75-99
---
nice

nice 10 hp

200m range xp via cannon, 200m hp via range, 200m defense via chinning in catacombs

Hopefully, If I do actually get to speak to a Jagex employee, They arent as dismissive.
---
They're back up to 800k? I just bought one for like 410k
---
You're laughing but I lost my legs 3 years ago in a car accident and playing ironman has helped me cope with my injury for a long time now.
---
This doesn’t seem accidental
---
When it comes to the gold sink conversation, there's no opinions involved. One side is factually incorrect. That side is yours.
---
Please do explain why you would think an AGS disappearing causes **gold** to leave the economy. Not the item, but the gold.
---
Thank you for looking that up! I will definitely level up my defense, then. To be honest, I completely ignored the fact I can hop worlds lmao.
---

If i were you id just buy another account and hopefully you get legitimate info this time.

Lol he’s far past the ability to chill my dude
---
Measure of basicity?
---
Oh boy! Long dick style!
---
Because reddit is brainlet
---
This made me shrivel up i hate needles
---
I, and most people, think 5 or even less.
---
That’s how it used to be on OS, and on release. A few runes at best? Lmao what? People lose far more than that on death. Who goes around 3 iteming with just runes? 
---
People atm take the best gear in game worth hundreds of mil to do bossing, with no risk if they die. That’s not healthy for the game at all.
---
Voted in both :)
---
I’m interested in a skilling-focused poll - basically “what level are you” in each skill, and “what method have you primarily used to gain exp” for each skill.
---
So, did you get the girl?
---
Ill tell u how. 
---
1. Random guy pms u saying he can make u money
---
2. Random guy makes u skull up
---
3. Dude makes u hop to pvp world
---
4. Dude asks u to withdraw ur valuable items but u gotta bank anything else like a tele or food!
---
5. Dude is asking you to stand very close to a safe dangerous zone
---
6. The dude is fucking reading a book in al kharid bank. Its not like hes fucking doing a quest. 
---
Like how do u not think this is a lure. Theres are 1000000000 million things that delay your shit.
---
Pretty sure this is fake Or it’s his friends or something lol
---
op has posted this book scam multiple times on this same account telling people “not to fall for it”
---
And then he falls for the same scam. Maybe RWT the bow and did this to not get flagged?
---
The posts are good for a laugh though
---
Stop buying gold
---
I just started an Ironman account and got 99 firemaking at windertod and banked most of the reward chests. I heard conflicting information about wether the rewards scale based on your resource gathering levels. Does anyone have a suggestion about what I should do before I open the boxes?
---
1 : stop trying to devalue my 3 item rune only UIM
---
2 : would it work in like a pet sort of way where you could possibly pay large sums to get your items insured for a period of time? 5 minutes to get your stuff back, whilst it is doable, and doesnt seem like a terrible idea, wouldnt work for UIM.
---
If you keep zulrah/vorkath bank in, thats fine. However if you just say "lol, no storage for UIM plebs" and put their items on zul-andra, that wouldnt be good.
---
UIM also frequently die and pick stuff up later, I fear that lowering the death timer would probably kill UIM.
---
fucking autists don't understand that the username alone means nothing, otherwise people would just hack anyone flexing at the G.E lmao. it's the reddit info + username that allows potential social engineering to get access. without the reddit account attached the username is useless.
---
Easier on mobile
---
That made his ears burn
---
Its a bug that happens when you tele out during mm2 when riding the gorilla
---
going to take a guess and say you leveled the free stats alot, I'm 1920 skill total, and I'm at 150m~ bank value, but I spent a massive amount on things that could be bought, and I usually took the fastest route, which was usually the most expensive route.
---
That's actually hilarious, thanks for sharin
---
did you miss the part about 10 accounts? 300k/hr
---
Lets look at the small economy between two people named Fred and Sally. Sally has ten dollars. Fred has ten dollars. So far, in this economy there is twenty dollars total.
---
Now Sally uses five dollars of hers to buy a shirt from Fred. Fred now has fifteen dollars and Sally now has five dollars. There is still twenty dollars in the economy.
---
Oh no! Sally loses the shirt she bought! However, she still has her five dollars, and Fred still has his fifteen dollars. How much money is left in the economy?
---
Perhaps if I literally explain like you're five, you'll understand.
---
This is 27 yearold me right now
---
Wonder how many accounts could Pk him at the wildy alter....
---
He still goes to school for something to do with being a mechanic and works as a car mechanic, he streams like 4 to 6 hrs usually. He just does it for fun
---
It has my upvote.

Give this man his account back Jagex you fucking piece of shit

"Gather round the ol swastika for some ghost stories"
---
Meta change to Dragon hunter lance.
---
Dragon hunter lance is also more viable at other places than vorkath.
---
But once DHCB drops under dragon hunter lance, then it will most likely level out, as currently DHCB is more expensive and less viable for the game as a whole.
---
Why tho

you're quite drab.
---
Dude I was mentally aware of this stuff in RuneScape when I was 12; infact I lured myself. You literally have no excuse. Now you know. I also knew al Khar was multi even now; I also know you could have banked the stuff and lied and see where this was going. You wanted to lure; or anti lure. You’re part of the culture and got got screwed.

You don't have transaction info because you don't have your old email?

 thanks for the 5 bucks nerd.

Could be he rented a staking account. I had a noob friend once who made his 700m bank by staking on a rented account.
---
you have owned it for 11 years makes it sound like you bought this account 11 years ago something doesn't smell right here we aren't getting the full story
---
nope, i know him, he was at absurd xp levels before that was ever a thing

Reminder that Jagex made £30m+ in profit but employees are underpaid and support is underfunded

This one time when i was casually selling gold i made from taking loans at the duel arena, i was acting very standoffish to the buyer in zendesk chat. 
---
I think they picked up on it because after the sale instead of asking me to rate their service and vouch for them the dude asked if i was ok. I clearly wasn't, i was literally the scum of the earth scamming kids all day in a game i use to love - through a method (taking loans at the DA) which the developers will never change because a good portion of their bond money comes in here.
---
This random angel in my time of need sat up with me all night on discord voice chat talking about all my problems, and eventually all their problems. You see he was from Venezuela, i know... You've heard all the stories and probably have a cemented opinion but when you actually take the time to sit down and talk and be vulnerable to these people the differences start to fade and the lines between me - a white 20 something living in a first world country with endless opportunities, who has chosen to be a lazy cunt scamming on a children's game for IRL profit - and someone just trying to survive, blur.
---
In a sense talking to someone in this situation really starts to put things into perspective, here i am with endless potential thanks in no small part to where i was born squandering my chance to make a difference, a real difference in the world. Maybe enough that i can help my new friend in some small way. 
---
But to do that, first, guys, I'm going to need a loan to pay back my debts in RS to i can start with a clean slate and MAKE that difference! You can find me on twitch under the name "Odablock".

You'd have to be an utter fucking boomer to think a level 30 dog could stop all of the shit sitting within the theatre of blood from making their way into misthalin.

Heard the same before, but meat is pretty cheap and good source for proteins. I know it contains bad fats, but it depends what sort of meat you use and how you prepare it.
---
The wiki lists [the track](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Unlisted_music_tracks) as a jingle. Jingles can be played on top of other tracks but aren't in the play list. 
---
This seems unintended as the song isn't very "jingle like" and i suspect it might be a limitation in the engine as the track is shorter than anything that is in the music list. 
---
The quest it's used in released late april 2007 and the next quest in that series (land of the goblins) was released in november of 2007. So i suspect that's when they gave the issue a look and got it into the music list. However the version of oldschool we're on is based of a back-up from august 2007 right before land of the goblins. When oldschool came out i don't think they bothered with it anymore. 
---
Ofcourse most of what i just said is a theory but the content being relatively new for the time i don't think it's such a stretch.

GUH

Glad to hear you like this. :) Just take your time and considerations how you start to exercise. \^\^
---
But how your HCIM died?
---
OP on a 35m crafting month, roughly 80 EHP, so less than 3 hours a day and people flaming him like hes logged in 18 hours a day lol this sub is something else
---
Thank you! :) But what you mean by your peak addiction?
---
can we stop trying to combine pvm and pvp.  its not fun for the pvmers and its not real pvp.
---
I appreciate it. :)
---
jibbelree plex pls

Looks like they went back on their statement. Menu entry swapper is the most overpowered plugin. I'm surprised it didn't get axed considering it saves you so many clicks.
---
It's also used in death to the dorgeshuun and another slice of ham according to [the wiki's article on unlisted music tracks](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Unlisted_music_tracks).
---
wait until you hit 5k kills without a claw, because that is my luck.
---
have a cry
---
You're really going to confuse people by calling it runescape classic. Classic was a completely different game that was shut down a year or so back.
---
Jagex went back on their decision about menu swapper.
---
It took a lot planning and considerations, but it was worth it! :D Glad to hear you found my project interesting. \^\^
---
I'm starting to worry about you, this is not healthy by any means.
---
not that impressive when you are transferring that many funds from one account to another tbh.
---
Killing animals = Slayer. Capturing animals = Hunter.
---
And size of the animal doesn't matter. Like, just play with insects and you're good to go. ;D
---
Glad you liked it! \^\^ And thank you for your encouragement. I will look forward what future brings! :)
---
Sometimes I am too\~ :3
---
Showing my naked upper body didn't appeal me, but I may share my current body with a shirt on. Although there's no way I can do a comparison with them what I looked before and after the project. :(
---
You're welcome\~ =)
---
Your odds of getting it by 99 are not great, no matter the course.
---
Perhaps in future, but I am not going for total ripped body since I am already satisfied to my current muscle mass.

They said they're focusing on finishing open-ended story lines, hence the Vyre line update coming.
---
But most importantly, what rewards would even come from Fairy Tale 3? We already have the three major ones that came from the RS2 version. Infinite watering can, weedless farming, staveless fairy rings.
---
I'm not even sure what it is, but it has maggots, some cum, not a pleasant picture. If anyone wants to enlighten me on what it's meant to be feel free. Cause I'm def not looking into that any further to figure it out
---
can't tell if troll post or not
---
1 farming level above him he’s trash
---
This is unreal. How are you going to do Hit points without doing any combat skills?
---
Considering these are all afk buyables he has done, he's probably "having fun" and "getting immersed" on a different account or playing another game. Not realy your place to tell him he needs help. There are people with max xp in all skills, that takes way longer than this.
---
F off
---
I'm sub 1500 total on my bossing account with \~90 base stats and 99 attack and str, and even less on my pure obviously. Don't really care to get skills or max, just like bossing / raids and pvp. Have made a few hundred mil doing mostly GWD and DKs.
---
This proves how valuable player interaction is. Implementing the GE was a mistake.
---
I guess the same way personalities such as Ninja, Pewdiepie and other “scream at the screen” types are popular. They appeal to a certain, rather large, group of people (i guess mainly younger teens).
---
Their chats kinda reflects that, being very immature.
---
Thanks i watched that video yesterday while afking zalcano
---
Haha oh why.
---
"I'm not old enough to cum"

Thats ant-man!

I don't get this but I do

Did you go for a profitable method?

Seeing how your entire post history is about this exact scam, you know very well how it works. Fuck off.

The reqs are only to buy it IIRC

Oh god no. Not another wacky crazy idea....

Part of my issue with BIS isn't just power creep, PvMScape and the economic issues that causes.  
---
I feel like a lot of the content is just, mediocre thematically. It's not very well made to fit the a medieval theme and is too overboard and fancy. Devs have taken too much inspiration from Rs3 and other MMOs. Runescape was made during the more gentle time before WoW, where MMOs were inspired more by D&amp;D with a more reality-oriented thematic style. I wish they would stick to it. Barrows was peak design imo, especially Karils. Equipment like void and rangers armour is great as well.
---
you get lvls as you go, no?
---
That's a lot of head shaking.
---
You okay?
---
I bet you bought it off player auctions.
---
Clan wars portal removes skull and heals health and special attack I believe
---
Probably orders of magnitude more abandoned early-game accounts than ultra rich players, consider how many people checked the game out over mobile and never went further, then those that try Iron on a whim, and so on. If anything the value and total averages would be skewed down.
---
No, it got removed
---
no longer removes skull, there was an update. :(

however master farms are once again absolute cancer so thanks for making the thieving skill even more of a meta slave again i guess
---
Does using bones on wildy altar with menu swapper become illegal now? Not quite sure based on the text.
---
Stop using solvers and try solving them yourself more frequently. You'll eventually catch the idea how to solve them. No 200 iq required.
---
hes 1 attack not 10hp?
---
Yeah sounds about right. So probably have to fish/pump until then for str.
---
What about the medium could step where you have to kill a wizard for a key? Wonder how he'd feel about that, either witnessing or being the target.
---
? He has 66m hp xp
---
ye i remember those user input simulating bots, but even those used on screen visible feedback - something you'd want to see while you was pking because bots are not infallible at this point.
---
to show at what stage autonomous pvp bots are right now, you can see from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9e0McRUhvA
---
Too long for farming runs.

Probably set Anti Aliasing to 16x in the GPU plugin.

Also you can wear serp helm for convenience. Costs slightly more than venom doses tho

Are you legit trying to argue against a post that's written in Spongebob font? LMAO

Im 1920 as well and over 900m bank value, just do a lot of raids and pking I guess

They have multiple swastikas hidden in the game... pretty sure Enahkra’s temple is also a massive one...

so you mean, mobile?

The moment RL becomes an official client, run by jagex, then all the various bugs with it become unacceptable and the client wouldn't be fit for purpose.

Doubt it’s a repost, he just thought of the same Joke as the last guy
---
If anyone could help answer any of the below I'd be very grateful. Basically I've started a new account, ranged combat, and I have a couple dumb questions. I searched the internet but I'm still confused.      
---
First one- Does strength and/or attack level impact mage or range? I keep seeing the words range strength but I don't know what it means. Follow up, would a strength potion do anything for my range pure?  
---
I'm really lost on combat level. Online guide suggested to keep attack at 40, but does it not have to be a percentage of my ranged level as to not increase my combat level? Similar to how magic level needs to stay below ranged level? Right?  
---
Does carrying more kg's slow down running?  
---
Is it ever a useful tactic to wear armor with higher def stats and sacrifice range attack points?     
---
Once again I appreciate it as I'm clearly confused.
---
Those phones are waterproof anyway, everyone throw your phones in the bath
---
Rwt or just gp?
---
Tank the melee hits lmao. You are nuts for back and forth.
---
Vial*, ectophile would be some kind of ghost fucker
---
Just sent this to my IM mate who hasn’t logged in for about a month lol
---
Karambwans are a really interesting one. 
---
Whilst they were released way back in 2004 (and are definitely incredibly useful even today), it wasn't until much much later than the player-base released they could be consumed in the same tick as another food item. Further, this was not an intended feature but a bug in the code which was never removed, and subsequently manipulated.
---
Didnt saw that he copy pasted it from below when i wrote my reply. 
---
And its not like actual "serious" anti pvp comments are written in a less troll way so whatever
---
I hope it is one big bait, I mean if they doesn’t lure all the bots out idk what will
---
How can you get lost in the barrows tunnels lol
---
The bots you are talking about, the bots for raids and zulrah that have their stats (GP/H, kills/H, etc.) posted on reddit are the cheapest bots on the market. These are bots you can buy after 60 seconds of googling and installing a bot client (and paying a few dollars, obviously).  
---
Proper bots are much more costly; they'll usually run into the hundreds or thousands of dollars. They're custom made for the most part.
---
Probably some kind of prize for playing their “mini game” and also that is one hell of a scam. You gotta give em props for the effort but at the same time, that sucks dude
---
Someone just report him for buying gold
---
Also can be used on ecto with slime. No need to ground the bones.
---
I was wondering why I kept going into my own house trying to click the house advertisement. When I decided to try figure out why I realized that the "click box" for the House advertisment seems to only cover the ground tile that it is standing on. This issue occurs when the camera is facing north.
---
In case it isn't obvious the red square is where you have to click in order to interact with the board.

Hey dude, yeah join Destined Few! Loads of helpful guys in there. What's your RSN?

Pffft just hire someone to pot share for the true afk experience
---
For Ironmemes, a power ammulet has the same strength bonus as a glory and has better defence. It does lack the teleports but theres so many options for teleporting anyway. I just figured I'd share because getting a glory seems to be a pinnacle point for early iron accounts and I never got why - Obviously theres the mounted glory but I consider that mid-game anyway
---
someone is using an illegal plugin...
---
Pls don't fix this
---
Really? I’ve never done a diary but now I will ty!
---
"cause you get less gp for your dollars" AND They rise in price in the same prediction?  Wow a real economist on this sub ty!
---
When rsgp is cheap on gold sites, more people choose to buy from gold sites until the value of bonds goes up that people start choosing bonds again.  The difference in price between bonds and bannable rwt (for the same dollar) is entirely the average value runescape gold BUYERS put on the safety of buying bonds over bannable rwt gold.  It has nothing to do with supply or demand.  Supply and demand only is relevant in the conversation of how much rsgp you get from either source.  RWT gold at its rarest will never be more expensive than bonds, bonds will never go up past some unknown factor that the risk of buying rwt gold costs.
---
They are identical products, only the risk and ease of access matter.  Atm we're discussing what effect rsgp crashing due to a made-up scenario where jagex stop giving a fuck entirely about rwt.  The answer is obviously a crash in bond prices because more people will buy $.10/m illegal gold instead of $1.5/m bonds until bonds are like $.2/m or whatever.
---
It means you have to use the perfectly adequate tools provided during the fight to complete the encounter.
---
My worst rng in the game is getting these damn pouches!!!
---
At what point do we acknowledge that Jagex *doesn’t fucking care* about the botting issue, and that they will continue allowing exploits like this if it brings a few genuine players in?
---
Rfd Gloves also turn to coins, most untradables break and drop coins (you need to pay to repair them)
---
At least it's understandable, a "Oh, I can see exactly why that would should up as a bot" moment.
---
Are you kidding me? And Jagex won’t do a damn thing until it’s already ruined.
---
I expected the rewards menu to say Jeffrey Epstein didnt kill himself
---
free membership is never a good thing especially in such a bot/gold farmer plagued game lmao honestly no clue what they are thinking..
---
That’s one way to say removed
---
Tf?
---
there’s a fairy ring pretty close to the farm patch too.
---
Not sure why you'd bring training with blowpipe in nmz of all things lol, that's ridiculous
---
&gt; about 480k per hour which isn't that huge
---
It is a decent dip. How many people use blowpipe at bbd for example? Virtually no one, because the increase kills/h doesn't outweight the increase of cost/h
---
I usually don't as long as they're super sharp. This one looks quite painful though.
---
I checked it out myself and saw maybe 8 bots in 3 minutes.
---
The economy is gonna be fked over the weekend.
---
Every time I ask someone to raid they're busy  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Jagex has control of the botting problem btw guys, no need to panic!
---
the woox walk is the exact same btw
---
Yeah I was thinking of going back to slayer lol I stopped doing combat stuff while I was doing Winter to keep my HP lower lol what's pyramid plunder and NMZ but? Also not sure what chin or iceburst is lmfao I assume ardy knights is a quest :)
---
I say make an in game item than stores puzzle solutions, make it a reward locked behind clue scrolls themselves. Maps name locations, Coordinates show  maps/location names, solutions to riddles etc..
---
People who don’t like Ironman are just jealous they couldn’t do it 😂
---
Imagine projecting terrible images into something so harmless.
---
You don’t get to decide what weapons are used to kill you. You’re a visitor to the wild. If you knew AGS and claws were used to kill you you’d downvote those too. 
---
You want a ham bone to be a spec weapon that all PKers use. Because you want things to be unfairly balanced in your favor, like a child.
---
Once you see one of his pieces of art you will understand
---
Death used to be more impactful, but due to various reasons it has become more of a non issue. Back in the day you had 2 mins to reach where you died to pick up your stuff, after that it would disappear(also at some point during this countdown the items would be shown to everyone on the ground and thus they could pick the items up). At some point during the Original version of RS, now RS3. There was gravestones you could pay for, they increased the time  to a maximum of 15 minutes, someone with high enough prayer could "bless" it and extend that time to 60 minutes if they came across your grave.
---
"Boomer got his anal beads back" has to be one of the most iconic lines representing this sub's culture.
---
That’s a 5k hour grind at max efficiency. Literally 208 days of play time.
---
When your blowing your blowpipe, you gotta take a breather. Does work on your lungs
---
Unfortunately this is why I removed my sub on my 3 accounts. I can only take being a neglected costumer for so long before I go play a game that isn’t actively trying to implode on itself every week due to trash updates everybody hates.
---
bwanana..
---
It’s literally not lol. 
---
You do content in the wild, you’re able to vote. 
---
You don’t, you can’t. And you can’t farm content to spite vote.

&gt;no!!! Ehhh that’s completely unFAIR REEEEEEEeeeee Jagex is really shoving the fattest cock in the woods up my ass!!!! NOW I can’t SPite VOTE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Im maxed and Skilling post 99. I work as an R&amp;D chemist for a company that specializes in synthesis of custom silicones. I don't have any kids, so I have plenty of free time to play, and I'll do afk stuff like redwoods or nmz on my phone if Im doing office work.
---
No I’m not. Personally I think directly after Regicide would be the best timing for it. Possibly after one of the Mornings Ends if the devs think that’s a better time. Either way it shouldn’t slot into the pre existing quest line but instead be an optional quest in the region.
---
Ya I don’t really understand OPs point either. Plus even quoting the change to pvp states that players felt they were voting for the change to blowpipe speed specifically for pvp, so what does that have anything to do with pvm? Why do we NEED the opportunity for a next BiS ranged item at the moment? Why are the devs suddenly unable to develop a weapon that calculates damage differently as the Tbow does that makes it better than blowpipe, or just a better ranged weapon in general?
---
Oh nice, it’s bar0v I’ll be online in a min, send me a message whenever!
---
Streamers get a 1099-miscellaneous, I believe.
---
Its obvious what must be done, ima make 20 alts and get a piece of that action.
---
So glad they're working on banning people using harmless overlays while bots can do whatever they please
---
There are many more ways to get the same problem soved, it takes talent to pick 300 overall and call it a day
---
Indeed. Looks like that bot maker either stopped, or got his bots banned. Or maybe he switched to a less obvious spot. Either way, current BH system can be heavily abused by bots AND by players. Players are able to generate 1.2m gp/kill AND a good amount of BH points every kill, by killing alts/friends in hotspots on 3+ kill streak while both having a tier 4 emblem.

You can still use dharok's set outside of the minigame. Training at the monkey guards on ape atoll was very common back in the day.
---
Maybe on monday, even then it would be to late cause the gp would already be in game.
---
What a steal - he got 1m back on his offer.
---
His account has an average play time of 2-3 hours a day. Still plenty of free time to have a life.
---
When you aren't missing ticks dragon darts is better than dhcb, and rune darts are equal, dhcb is just easier and cheaper to use, but bp still wins in potential damage output
---
You never loose money if you don’t sell the gear.

Right. Lol Big Gz to him for finishing that grind. Knowing now how grinds like this feel, I almost feel a connection to people like him. Would love to chat with the guy xD It will be 9 months since I start in two days. That’s a lot of time to spend doing one thing.. lmao
---
Perfect for clan meetings!
---
IMPEACH KING ROALD
---
How are the two related at all other than being spec weapons? They're used for completely different things and claws have crashed pretty hard.
---
Reminder that the emblem's from rev caves worth up to 16 million gp still exist too lmao. Despite being a "temporary" drop. We have all this discussion about gold sinks then they do this shit.
---
Ill probably get on a bit later as well my RSN is Lividnarwals. Looking forward to seeing you!

Idc if anyone has a pet but all that matters is if the person that has it cares...
---
Pretty sure its the only crossbow for f2p
---
Actually would make sense....
---
i guess technically it's systemic genocide
---
So like 2 hours of gold out of the 100 hours It's being abused
---
That's true. Chinning defense xp is actually really fast
---
Where do you think the bots will go after you disable points? Oh ya back to literally any other activity in osrs PvM/skilling that can be botted
---
Let’s disable zulrah cuz people bot it
---
Mod Reach has infiltrated Jagex once again to make exploits for his buddies and new Audi addition to the collection.
---
&gt; No, remapping keys to mouse buttons is fine.
---
You sure about that? I swore I saw somewhere where Jagex claimed using anything other than the F/Esc keys is an offense.
---
Oh yea im sure. You arent wrong my dude
---
just wanted to point out that it is possible that maybe couldve won a few hundred mil but not likely
---
I can’t see an issue
---
100% agreed. If you’ve completed the step before, the game should show the answer. There is no one who doesn’t either use a client to either automatically solve the steps, or just looks them up themselves. Clue scroll rewards are nowhere near profitable enough for clues to be worth doing without ‘cheating’ on them.
---
I want an username so I searched for it on the official Hiscores and it says it doesn't exist, but I tried to change my rsn and it says "it's already taken"... how does that happen? Is there a way for me to get the name?
---
You don’t need dragon, you could use mithril.
---
Why is this post not 15k upvotes already
---
Damn it's still that high. Was similar price in my local market a year ago.
---
you're posting this just to spite pvpers. it's pathetic honestly. the first update to pvp in 10 years and something that will save pvp which runescape is based on, let me remind you, and you post this (probably) edited footage. this is why the game will die. you're literally killing the game because of your stupid twitter neckbeard "achievements", all don't want carpal tunnel mate.
---
Maybe go back to old BH and wildy slayer and fix both issues at once.
---
Hes happy/hype, let him enjoy what he likes and stock being a stuckup prick.
---
Where that NMZ guide?
---
What items can you get from the boxes?
---
Time to merche these botters.

The lamps in Varrock museum are always worth 500 XP. The only level scaling is genie and exam random events (which does impact your XP rates slightly)

We should remove skilling too, I saw someone botting yew trees
---
Thanks i didnt know it was a vaccine until i read the white text in the arm
---
There was the original guy that owned them then he sold them or gave them someone else, they got shutdown under that person who was given them. Then the original guy opened up a new site and claimed the sites were back.
---
Hey bro, veteran here as well! What's your IGN? I'll add you when I get on later.
---
I woke up and just saw it at that. I’m not quite sure. Good thing I’ve got enough karma to lose a few. 
---
Many irons in my cc went over to/tried wow so it’s not some big surprise some people play both.
---
Why would they need to bot their own game...
---
&gt;I know what I am talking about
---
Well very clearly you don't. OP's average play time is 2-3 hours per day. You're far beyond insane if you believe it's impossible to have a social life, career and health if you spend a couple of hours a day on entertainment.
---
So how does this all tie into the RWT problem? Is this guy going to make a ton of bank irl?

God I love vore. Avian preds are the best

Won't be level 3

Better suggestion: Make this the standard home tele animation

How do you guys make friends in this game? I can never get anyone to hold a conversation.

I'll add you anyway dude(tte)!
---
Absorbs are so much easier... you dont have to flick rapid restore if you dont wanna.
---
I know all the recoveries are correct, I made them.
---
I also gave them 7 old passwords and my new one. I gave them pretty much every zip code Ive logged into the game with in the past 11 years.
---
The original ISP, Zip, and address I made the account at.
---
Exact dates and times of buying bonds for membership and paying for subscriptions.
---
Jagex has always been a shitty company. Everything they touch turns to shit. I'm done competing with bots who make up 90% of the game. I've never seen a company that's so bad at what they do.
---
Good good good, glad to see the twitch prime bots already booming. 
---
Looking forward to seeing lower prices in the upcoming weeks
---
Gratz :)
---
Tf. All those other tjings you get once. The runepouch you loose everytime you die with it. Also the accs people risk the pouch on is normally not the account they do bh pking on. Yous falls under the thoughtless voting 100%
---
I've been thinking about it, You think I should?
---
Absorbs are the least effort you can possibly put into the game
---
Sorry if I sounded like a downer. Probability is strange and it's one of the most fascinating things on this game. This one time I was killing greater demons and got 3 rune full helms in a row, turns out it's a 1 in over 2 MILLION chance of happening. That's the sort of shit many of us play the game for, and you're completely right that these outlier cases happen all the damn time but we only notice the ones that we are actively looking out for.
---
So you think we should keep taking away things and making pvp qol worse. You fucking disgust me dude.
---
The bounty world is STACKED with emblem farmers rn, expect a crash in all pvp items tbh. Those boxes seem pretty OP

Why are you trading a Tbow in a Pvp world?

EZ money
---
Since free membership is back with twitch prime does that mean that air orb price is going to start dropping after sometime when bots get the levels required to bot it?
---
AFAIK the twitch prime acts like a bond. It just adds time to your membership if you already have it. If you do t it just gives you 2 weeks game time, when it runs out you go back to f2p.
---
Herbs, limps, hops, and seaweed on top of farming contracts. 95 farming. I also do papayas and mahogany for xp. 
---
Hard farming contracts are about 100k each and if done right you're almost always doing 1 per run. 
---
About 20k per herb patch and 6k for limps. 20k per hop patch and 30k for both seaweed. 
---
If you have absolutely everything (which I don't) you can make about 500k per run. I make about 300k per run.
---
Remember Mod Reach.
---
+1 for anal beads
---
calling all pkers go to that world... and kill his bots....
---
Have to rock cake and rapid restore, otherwise you end up with 17 hp and get shrekt. Also have to look out for when your overload runs out. Pray melee lasts for like 10 minutes, I don't even ovl on time.
---
I seriously hate you right now.

Depends on how the click works, if it's one click for one click it should be fine.  If it's a hold down the mouse button click you would be in danger
---
If an opponent has a low to zero defense in my attack style can I substitute proselyte or something without accuracy bonus and still hit the same amount of damage as in the example of Armadyl armour?  I know this works with magic but, I was curious if it worked with others
---
The idea is rouge mods bot for the gp for the $$, £  £ . They do this because if they just spawn money then they will be fired/fined/prison time. 
---
It's one of those conspiracy theories that may or may not have merit. But it's good enough to rally players against whenever Jagex fucks up.
---
Kaiba was always my man when I was a kid. He was rich. He had the swag. Turns out he was actually an okay dude. I always wanted to grow up to be rocking his fashion sense. 
---
How dreams change.
---
Look at the 6th picture
---
Actually I’ve worked for several companies with Friday deploy days. They were usually just big enough to have incident response teams who would come in on the weekend should anything breaks.
---
How about we stop using reddit for customer support and actually use the tickets. It's consistently made clear reddit and Twitter will not help you in your problems
---
No I don’t know what happened with reach
---
I cant understand how short sighted you can be. Do you honestly ignore literally everything that poses a threat to your argument? Literally everything?
---
Rune pouches untradable: pker pks another pker with a rune pouch. Pker doesn't get pked's rune pouch because its untradeable. Pked still loses pouch.
---
Rune pouches tradeable: pker now gets the drop. Pked buys another
---
If it's so hard and long to get those, then risking it should be risky. But it also means the other guy should get rewarded for sUcH aN Op ItEm being pked. That goes with defenders too, which they dont, and imbued rings which do get dropped.
---
Why allow some things to be dropped and other dont? You can still buy an rune pouch with emblems, so why differentiate the 2?
---
PVM is also completely safe now unless your computer stops working for over an hour and you cant get back to where you died (which you would have to be an absolute fucking idiot not to). There is zero risk for having an imbued ring in the game outside of pking. Zero.
---
Why is there no risk for pvm with SuCh Op ItEmS but pkers are forced to lose the pouch, on top of the fact the other guy doesnt get your pouch you paid a few mill in emblems for anyways?
---
I didn’t say anything about taking stuff away, did you really read my post? I’m saying that the pker mentality the guy I responded to is talking about is a problem. OSRS is not a private server!!! If you want easy access to items you have to grind for in the real game , maybe you should switch to private severs were all of that is conveniently located in a shop right on the edge of the wilderness.
---
Not bad because Im using the same pc at the same address, Answering 5 recovery questions I know are correct, Giving multiple old passwords and the last 4 digits of my card number. The dates at which I bought membership were very close.
---
Also the isp, date, and zip of when I created the account were correct.
---
then those companies had more money than sense, it costs a lot more to pay people to be on call + any lost profits from a broken product than to just not deploy on a friday lmao
---
Damn, you can get 281710411438055027694947944226061159480056634330574206405101912752560026159795933451040286452340924018275123200000000000000000000 ranging potions from a single crate? That's fucking insane.

Can anyone explain what the video is from?
---
Does anybody else have an alt character specifically for high alching?  If so, has it gotten banned?
---
I made one about a week ago or so and leveled magic up to 55, then started alching items i bought on the GE to make money, but also to increase its magic level further so later on i can have a mage pure.
---
The way I do this is with an old laptop.  I have it next to me and just click away while doing other things, like playing my main (the laptop has a physical mouse button to click instead of tapping on the trackpad so I don't risk moving the mouse away from that sweet spot).
---
I just reached lv 80 magic last night after clicking for around 8 hours (from about 6PM until 3AM with small breaks every now and then).  I got on this morning and was unable to log in due to a macroing ban.  I was not in any way using any sort of macro, I was simply clicking for hours on end while doing other things.  Is this against the rules?  If not, why did I get a perma ban?
---
I did appeal the ban, but I wanted to come here and see what you all thought about this.  Thank you and hope you all have a great day!
---
Cpu always, there’s a gpu plug in if you use runelite
---
Conveniently right after I decided to get 93 herblore for divine scbs
---
Not for the best exp you can't.
---
Zulrah death doesn't cost anything
---
I rather put money in a gold farmers account and get twice the gold that a bond provide than handing over money that 96% of goes into the personal checking account of a chinese dude.
---
its super awful pre-77, after that it's pretty much a joke.
---
I personally didn’t vote for that. I hate ironmen making the game change to benefit them. My rune pouch came from a BH shop and I value it, hence why I don’t risk it in the wilderness.... see how that works?!
---
Money slayer tasks are in the 70s and you can grind them off task too 
---
Kurasks are like 3-4K a kill 
---
Gargoyles are 600kish and hour for full afk
---
Wyverns are a little more than gargoyles 
---
Brutal blacks are like 800k an hour, again fairly afk 
---
All the slayer levels for them are in the 70s
---
I’m grinding to 80 rn for nechreals but just letting you know, it’s EXPENSIVE. I’ve spend probably 2-3m so far to get from 70-79
---
This is good lol
---
you get 230k profit/hr at Ardy from amylase packs
---
both..
---
What was the big update they did? I haven't been on in a bit
---
I don’t get
---
Raids and bossing make such a huge difference. I had never bossed before and at 1800 total was under 100m. 1880 now and been doing zalcano for the pet, right around 250m and that's with pumping millions into my clan for event prizes recently.
---
Changing it would speed up training and provide XP rates Jagex hasn't accounted for, I guess.  Not saying that's a good explanation, but it's similar to the justification for nerfing ZMI earlier this year.
---
Thanks a lot for the help u/bulletbrainsurgery :D
---
Smithing essentially hasn't been updated since 2005.
---
You don't have to use rock cakes or overloads either.. 
---
https://youtu.be/Q0huAx4pGSk
---
Maybe this will help you ¯//\_(ツ)_///¯
---
shrink me potion, i think
---
Yep! Train melee with the highest level slayer master you can.
---
Use dscim and defender till you can afford and use a whip 
---
And melee training can be done super afk at NMZ
---
They look like ants lol.
---
Let's lock bounty hunter behind sote problem solved
---
Dr mosby cc
---
 It’s not an ironman, he’s probably using gold from his main account to train this one
---
disgusting
---
Just tried walking into a raid on mobile, you definitely still have access to the minimap.
---
Jagex literally sells bonds for real money
---
Whoa, interesting build. I'm 1880 total but with base 70s and most in the 80s and several in the 90s. Nothing at 99 though. I kinda want to get like 10 skills at 98 and throw a party for a bunch of 99s at once.
---
crystal armor is not on it tho
---
Soun6d like free stuff to me!
---
I think that first one is an 'issue' because there's a spell on the Lunar book that acts similarly, and a plugin makes that redundant.
---
That said, yeah, I could also just look on the official hi-score page, which is 99/100 more convenient than the spell, so :shrug:.
---
Jagex pays 96% of their income in 2018 as dividend to investors, so what jagex is left with is 3~ million pounds to operate and improve rs3 + osrs.

I 100% voted no on tradeable pouch i like the mechanics they have right now and wouldn't want the mechanics to change if they became tradeable
---
Okay, clearly not here for anything except to argue. I'm not a liar, I'm not covering up for a mistake i've made, and I'm sick of putting up with shit from people like yourself, who have decided to take it upon themselves to halfarsed call people out on something they don't even understand or know about. My authenticator app has been in use since day one, I also use my authenticator as part of my job, so I understand how effective this is and the security measures that are in place. I didn't think this was a hacker from the get go, but I was willing to take on board what you, and others,  had to say regarding this. I have taken measures to protect my account and then provided extra information on the matter for others to read and view. You are adamantly set in this being a hack however, if you want to continue believing this, carry on. Please though, just do it elsewhere.
---
Smithing can make tremendous amounts of profit at ok exp rates, or it can be one of the fastest 99's. Choose your path.
---
I feel bad for whoever has to show up to work at that one bank window
---
Not doing that cause it's no longer gambling if you know you'll always win.
---
Lmao /u/vredditshare
---
It was originally called Damballah after the Voodoo creator God. Honestly, you could expand the region to capture a lot of the Haitian voodoo spirit if they wanted to.
---
And months later the fire cape was removed from the account
---
3 tick barb fishing or 2 tick swordfish
---
What theme are you using to affect the skills page? Also, do you plan on training strength with barb fishing after you max agility and fishing? I’ve always wanted to see someone do that
---
If they got your pin and Authenticator code, it was definitely phishing unless they have a RAT on your computer recording what you do. Otherwise they could’ve guessed from social media information they could’ve obtained. They could also have your email password, etc. Setup 2FA on your email as well.

p2w’s buy bonds and get high level gear that is buyable, the barrows gloves and fire cape are non-tradable near bis gear that can only be achieved through playing the game, basically the burn is “fuck off you don’t actually play the game”
---
Don’t worry I only have mith too
---
People need to stop selling them for less than 8k each. Sellers control the market. Don’t give in to price drops and it’ll go back up.
---
This one's a win, fellas.  Happy to get a clear response and with basically no adjustment on the user part if they were using Runelite.
---
Was wondering why this seemed familiar. I’ve been hearing this song all across BH worlds.
---
Ironman solves all the jealously
---
&gt;Why would I lie in this situation?
---
Because it's the internet and people lie for literally no fucking reason at all? You're not really helping your case here. Obviously the benefit (at least from your point of view) is lying makes you not look like a naive person who just walked into a blatantly obvious phish that isn't even specific to OSRS.
---
That's more of a reason than probably 99% of people lying on the internet.
---
You're playing this out just like everybody else that comes onto Reddit/streams wondering how they just lost their items.
---
If this little thing I found looks, moves, acts, tastes and feels exactly like 99.9999% of ants I've come across before, isn't it reasonable to assume it's an ant too?
---
You're the ant.
---
Counterpoint: unless you've already finished it, grind out 70-75 smithing. I just did adamantite bars to 76 and made I think 6mil. Very worth it for the time spent.
---
My farm :p
---
I've never been to the sand casino, but I also am really tempted to go so I can finish out con easily. And herb and prayer and and and... Sigh.
---
I think you may be doing something wrong.
---
Oh because you were in his house and know more about what happened with his internet than he does.
---
Fair enough I think we all feel that way about certain things in os
---
Yea. And approximately how much was lost? In terms of gp?
---
You can call it spite voting if you want. I voted no because pvp rewards have always and will always be abused by botters and clans, and I'll keep doing it, because it will keep happening.
---
You’re doing a god’s work. Thank you
---
Is the arclight a necessity to kill demonic gorillas? I’ve been bursting dust devils in the catacombs for a couple of days now and I’ve only managed to get 1 ancient shard. Am I doing something wrong or is it just bad RNG?
---
Runelite is a ban now?? Why? What client do people use now?
---
Take the hit. They have no purpose outside of pvp and numbers doing pvp has been going down for ages
---
The only confirmation that we have was that runelite has been officially compliant with recent rule updates. If that doesn't mean it's safe jagex doesn't understand the meanings of the words they used, which to be fair is a very real possibility.
---
Either way, you should be fine. They can't even really detect that shit anyway lmao. Right clicking on an item is purely client side and they receive literally no information that you're only left clicking instead.
---
I would assume they would have to severely improve their anticheat to even remotely detect the mouse movement behavior specifically relevant to right clicking a bone, dragging down to 'Use' and then to an altar, instead of just left clicking.
---
They're too lazy for that.
---
Try the recall follower button in the equipment screen.  If that doesn't work chances are it's gone 😕
---
Looks to be you somehow lost it before you realized it no there’s no way to get it back if you didn’t insure it
---
 jagex explicitly okayed this specific MES like years ago, it was literally the first MES we had.
---
jagex also (read the sticky) said runelite is currently compliant
---
It isn't ban, but yet it is. Basically there was a big shitshow over it not too long ago. I think they just announced that runelite is okay again, but to use it at your own risk.
---
Right? I've had 2 drops in my name in 230 kc. Averaging 25-35k a raid
---
edit: cannon 200m range and then go for 200m hp in pestcontrol while saving every point to dump into atk
---
Why has jagex allowed the bone plug in, which swaps the 1st option(Bury) with the 2nd option(use) and massively increases xp meta rates. But HAM members cannot use the same 1st and 2nd option to swap “talk to” and “pickpocket” for a method that is not xp meta and crap loot just purely for easy clues? Some of the rules are so random and arbitrary.
---
Seems like a fetish but ok
---
Well it sounds like it may have been a ddos attack. Which is why the distinction of if your internet or just your game went down during this time. If your actual internet went down, then you have more pressing issues than your osrs account. Still a good idea to update the password and all. And contact customer service just to make sure it wasn't a glitch or something. But following, and possibly before that, change your information for EVERYTHING, especially bank stuff. And monitor your credit cards carefully over the next few weeks. Could be nothing, but could also be very serious. If it was a glitch, your stuff will either reappear or jagex will get it to you. If it was you being hacked, then they have a lot more info than just your osrs info if you had auth enabled on your account and email.
---
I mean I guess it isn't a guide but zammy is a fairly simple boss. All the setups are on the wiki in detail and this video showcases that method.
---
i just have a real hard time believing configurable shift clicks and menu entry swaps are allowed when they said
---
"We consider features which enable you to bypass gameplay mechanics to be unacceptable, like those which might indicate where projectiles would land, where NPCs might spawn, or which protection prayers to activate.
---
The same can be said of features which might modify how you select actions in the game or change how you click on menus, players, or NPCs, especially where the feature leads to you using fewer clicks than you would when using our client."
---
menu entry swapper undeniably results in less clicks.
---
Because that's just how probability works. It does seem a bit counter intuitive at first, but that's how one falls victim to [Gambler's Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy). Going back to the coin toss example: Each side has a 1/2 chance of success. It is possible in reality for me to get 10 heads in a row. This would be 5x the "drop rate" of the coin. But getting 10 heads in a row is not impossible, just highly unlikely. 
---
If the probability of something is anything less than 100%, then there will never be a point of guaranteed success unless you are able to have infinite n trials.
---
In the run i got 77k/h i had 16 different bosses. Including dream mentor bosses
---
You’re still gonna buy it the first week even though they’ve removed a massive portion of the Pokémon in the game? Personally I’d wait to see if they include any patches due to fan backlash.
---
Pumping more gold into the game will increase bond prices right? Which will incentivize players to buy bonds increasing Jagex revenue. And it could force other players to buy real membership instead of bonds since they can no longer afford the bi-weekly cost of bonds. Look into it. Or, more likely it will drive players back to the black market.
---
Gives me so much anxiety
---
You definitely want to rake those leaves before they get wet and create a leathery layer on the ground that kills all grass and plant life below it.
---
did you have the dt bosses?
---
Lol, wow. 
---
It’s called spite voting whether I want it to be called that or not. You think all PvP content is abused by botters regardless of whether or not the facts reflect this and superimpose it on all new ideas. Now either you’re a sage who can predict when content will be botted or you’re dismissing everything PVP. So when Jagex makes a mistake and allows this to happen you jump for joy. However this is not the fault of PKers or grounds to dismiss ALL PVP content, whatsoever. 
---
But you ignore skilling and PVM content that is heavily botted. 
---
And something tells me you’ve never even participated in Bounty Hunter before. If so, your opinion should not matter anyway. 
---
Just let it sink in that you hate PVP so much that you’re essentially siding with botters.
---
have been thinking about that :D
---
So basically money is going to be worthless now and all major items will probably increase in price from this?
---
Your account is YOUR responsibility regardless of what happens. It doesn't matter if you botted or if your sister did or if some stranger in Cuba did. The account will be banned.

Ok jagex. How can I hold responsibility for it when I had no control on what happened to my stuff?
---
Face tat or no balls
---
So 2m or 2,000,000 gp
---
You're not wrong, and many people have an issue with this and jagex's inconsistency.
---
It can only be explained by they're at least relatively incompitent and don't know what they should allow themselves.
---
And Mod Jed, right? Jagex mods are capable of some sketchy doings...
---
Adding you on discord now, hope you had good turnout!!!
---
Can you ask train range at NMZ too? I think I’ll get base 65 or 70 in melee stats at NMZ then start slaying to get higher task and bosses
---
Nobody cares about swastikas anyway.
---
Looks normal to me
---
Well how can something go to 100% chances if its never guaranteed that it will actually be it since theres no threshold on "Guaranteed at the 10th try"
---
People tend to bandwagon vote instead of making the decision themselves.

Use your brain to think for a moment. They're prohibiting it for thieving in general, not just HAM members. Because the pickpocket/knockout option swap gave insane exp rates for thieving. You have to buy bones to use them, you could afk thieving whenever you wanted it was free GP/exp.
---

---
Ah my first Christmas event! Takes me back
---
There is a special number called Euler’s number or e.  Like pi, it is defined by a limit function and isn’t rational (you can’t write it as a fraction or repeating decimal).  It’s about equal to 2.718.
---
The odds of not getting something within its Drop Rate is (about) 1/e.  The odds of not getting it in double it’s drop rate is (about) 1/e^2.  The odds of not getting it in half the drop rate is (about) 1/e^1/2.
---
If you want, I can try explaining why but while the proof is simple, it won’t make much sense without understanding why e is so important to everything.
---
He's helping out the ironmen who are getting their snapegrass hrs doing a service.

What happened with me, i was 300+ kills dry on anything, and i was getting demotivated and aggravated. So i was at the bank, good 3 minutes after the kill when i actually read the text that i had been followed, no pet to be found however.. teleporting didnt work.. re logged and it appearwd and was able to insure it.
---
 So that probably happened with you, u were in the zone, died before logging out, and lost a pet u never knew u had.
---
If you use RuneLite it may have taken a screenshot of you getting the pet, could be worth checking to see how long ago you go it. Sorry that you lost it though man, at least the log is filled out though!
---
I like being able to buy my membership with gp and it's already going up enough as it is, tyvm.
---
Well it mostly doesnt make sense to me cause i learned maths in french so some of the terms are different for me
---
oh fuck what have you done
---
Everyone needs to start telly other to lumby on these bots..

Clue scrolls are Jagex's welfare plan confirmed

How are they ruining it for you other than making you jealous and salty? if someone monetizes the game, good on them, they're the only ones not wasting their time here.

I relogged on my mobile device under a different world and some of the missing items are now in my inventory. I still haven't received my GP back, but the runes, swordfish and bones are back in my inventory now. I am assuming the GP will appear at some point along with some of the other items. I have still taken the precautions of changing all my account details for my runsecape accounts and others just in case it was anything suspiscious, but it appears to be resolved. Thanks for the assistance.

If they don't get back to you in that time (or if they reject your appeal and you're truly legitimate), you could try getting a Jmod's attention by either making a thread here or contacting one directly (JagexWeath or JagexTyran on Twitter, as these are the two who deal with anti-cheating).
---
Turn off sound and watch the animations. Honestly just sit there for a minute or so looking Jad in the eye. He is completely powerless if you keep your mouse on the opposite prayer and click when he switches attacking styles.
---
Then after that, and I can’t stress this enough, ONE ACTION PER ATTACK! Switch prayer, drink potion, switch prayer, click 1 healer, switch prayer, click next healer, etc. it’s easy peasy with this method.

Yupp I've never had a problem with costumer support. Also never bottled, rwt, been banned or muted.
---
they sent you an inbox message to your message Centre, it'd still be there as August 19th wasn't over 3 months ago.
---
stop it its NNN
---
Jagex literally just said Runelite is good to use. They have never previously "officially" endorsed a 3rd party client like this.
---
Yes, this really is worse than the heavily botted and farmed previous BH system, where people were making far more than 1b a day and there were several farms that went essentially unpunished and ran day in and day out. 
---
No, a rational solution instead of downvoting PVP polls and pretending you care about game integrity while essentially denying content to people who enjoy PVP is petitioning Jagex to correct their mistakes and ban bot farms. This is not a PvP problem but a botter problem.
---
I was assuming they’d accept the trade and expect me to click the pod then I dip but the scam was actually the door trick. Lol I totally deserve it I’m not saying I didn’t, some other person at ge “Becky slays” had made 35 mill off of one of the scammers but it all could of been part of the scam
---
Yeah, 2.6 efficient hours played per day it's a huge cause for concern.
---
I was thinking about the process of pking on my Ironman using all the rune alchs from Slayer and a good handful of dscims and dds. I have a shit ton of dragon bolt (e)s that will never get used elsewhere. Also really wanting it for the sgs, and the bragging rights for pking on a Ironman. I think it's fairly possible with a few days effort if you're already that far along. Probably end up losing a lot but if you get some task kills it couldn't be too bad right?
---
I play a lot with casual ba members, bas members, etc., but I find a lot of the ba community to be extremely toxic so I try to not join any ccs.
---
Lol
---
Hi, 500hr+ account recently got hacked and had all its wealth traded off, and then about 1 week later, it was perm banned for macroing major. What do I do now??
---
How can't you get better capes? What about the fire Cape? If you can afford 50m worth of gear you must have some game experience to kill Jad, unless you of course bought all of your gold...
---
Get as many diaries and quests done as you can, helps you set goals and achieve them in small doses.
---
Get 83 con for a dope POH.
---
oh fuck off with that nonsense. theres ways to make things goid and theres ways to make them bad. this ones bad. doesnt mean there wasnt spite votes because there 100% is spite votes
---
His jmod detection system isn't working
---
Little confused, so all menu entity swappers are banned? even the banker one? and will we have to disable these ourselves or is runelite taking them out
---
As long as they don't change it in PvP situations
---
DIDI MAO!
---
I like that guys vids, but even in a couple of his vids he has been skull tricked/ ends up skulled. It’s fine to be risking 20mill+ when your bank is huge but for me that’s 1/3 of my bank. Also I’m not maxed cmb (105)so I’m also at a level disadvantage 90% of the time, I can’t venge so at best I can bolt back and maybe get a max dds spec for my gear/level and KO them for their 250k dhide risk. Long term focusing on escaping is the more better for gp for me atleast. Also we have no idea how many times he goes down for his 700k risk in that vid.
---
That’s cute. You think that 3b(?) has a long term effect.
---
Good God, that is fucking nauseating.
---
Congrats
---
Wow was not a browser game. So you couldn't play it everywhere.
---
I jizz on my stomach every time I jerk off and smear it around until it dries off, and have done since I was 13. She probably does the same
---
Well. Gold prices are going to be cheap AF and bond prices are now coming down from the 5.5m for the past weeks. Got damn imagine being the dude making the bot  and making at least $600 an hour.
---
We can technically say pking is alive, but actually not.
---
U
---
Isn’t that how wilderness is supposed to be though? A risk? A gamble?
---
No chat logs have been provided or anything that states what rules I broke.
---
thanks for the advice. think i just have to be more relaxed against jad
---
Thanks man. My RNG is fine. Proof is i got the dagger then 30 kills later got a whip.
---
That’s too easy
---
He literally said he wanted the fastest XP in the response to your post
---
Sad, i was expecting an ely on 1 kc
---
?????
---
So you mean probabilities and random distributions are not part of statistics?
---
No, they won't. Why would you even assume that?
---
Better gp/hr and longer trips.
---
Probabilities and distributions make sense of ‘randomness’ to show there is logic and sense to a group of numbers. By being able to show that something follows a statistical pattern or probability you’re showing it’s moving away from randomness.

Upvoted for Jmod smackdown

Pyramid plunder is the only bearable thieving method for me
---
Pking for cash/rewards will only encourage shitty behavior and is the reason we see so many money grubbers ahking and the like to win more money.. We need fun incentives... not monetary ones. Does anybody remember when castlewars was full in every world? The toxicity of efficiencyscape in both gp/hr and xp/hr due to an aging player base will kill this game. People are literally shitting their pants for max eph.
---
Fishing and cooking aren't bad in f2p. I'd do those until I can get membs.
---
Why did Cooler have laser eyes?
---
Because the economy and current players don't matter. They're already suckers paying for membership. The only thing that matters is drawing more people in even at the cost of devaluing the current players experience.
---
How much profit did you make on the tiaras? Gz also

It isn't random on which cage you have to search. Search the one with the cyan circle around it in the above picture.

I was wondering if anyone could give me a rundown list on dailies/ repeatable e g farming that I should be doing. I haven't played since March. Account is Ronan736
---
They were about the same but with infernal and new helm dhl is better. Still very close though
---
thanks for the account
---
*Insert picture of Ryan Reynolds saying "But why?"
---
Im fairly sure they could all have laser eyes if they wanted to. Considering that Nappa fires a blast out of his mouth (Which seems impractical, considering the mouth is kind of a semi weak spot. But Dragon Ball ditched fight tactics in Z anyways.
---
The guy literally cheated his way to a pvm pet on a level 3. It doesn’t matter how many hours he spend doing it.
---
The guy who wrote the script for these bots probably spend 1/2 days writing it and bought a 5k+ usd computer to run 500 accounts. Even implemented machine learning to improve his bots, Jagex is not allowed to ban him because the time and effort he put in it.
---
Sell DHCB buy boosting farms
---
There are certain addons in runelite that are not okay, and will get you banned, if used correctly you'll be fine.
---
Yes runelite works to be compliant. However, the client still contains some plugins that are use at your own risk. Such as the menu entry swapper. This addons let's you swap the order of actions in a menu. For example swapping bury bones and use bones. This means you no long have to right click then click use bones to speed through them on an altar. You can just left click use, click on altar. This will get you banned. One of the update notices from jagex outlined this. Shortly after that announcement a small update was realeased and the game/clients needed to be reloaded. Runelite reloaded with the menu entry swap addon but by default its turned off. Even if you historically used it you had to manually go back in and turn it on again after this update. Use at your own risk.
---
The neitiznot faceguard made it so that fire capers can now get a max of 64 instead of 62 with the lance, which probably helped push the notion that melee is better.
---
Why do people who specifically want to kill other people never use their super power move that kills people from the getgo.
---
Why? Someone could easily recreate a program like that outside of the client.
---
It would function exactly the same just not overlayed on the client and the speed and results of completing the clues would be almost the same.
---
Fruit trees once a day, normal trees twice a day, Herb and birdhouse runs whenever you can, Varrock daily battlestaves, miscellania once a week, if you afk nmz buying herb boxes once a day. 
---
Don’t feel like you have to do everything except the daily staves because that’s free money
---
Pro tip: with infernal cape, you can ditch tassets in favor of justiciar legs; it'll have the same max hit with the lance, but noticeably higher defence and prayer bonus.
---
What have I forgotten? Because I've seen different text come up when people search? I just have searched that specific cage and nothing.
---
Around 1.5m, not much but I was doing it for the xp.

---
Can’t have barrows gloves without completing ds bud
---
I don't have a source because how else would you die chinning monkeys? You take a prayer pot every now and then and tele out when you have to resupply. I swear people who make these kinds of arguements have no common sense.
---
Gotta take the stuff out if you remove it
---
Does it make sense to buy iron ore/rings of forging from GE and smith into unfinished bolts?  It seems to me that it is a guaranteed way to double your money while also getting smithing skill up, but I'm not seeing it in any guides so I'm wondering if I'm missing something.
---
Holy shit, I think this was my first Christmas event
---
I never bankstand, i dont understand it. Im always grinding something out when im on
---
Just add a dark mage there. Problem solved
---
Man... that’s some good shit
---
A few, working on completing every hard diary, but it will take some time :)
---
Nice merch
---
I cant make sense of what is going on ? The bots are teleing to edge and then bank/resupply and run into the wildy to be killed for the new BH rewards ?
---
97 max (48-24-12-13) to 93 max (47-23-11-12). So yeah, that can be considered a big deal for claws. BGS has no max hit decrease though, if you decided to use it.
---
Spelling mistake in the first panel. You wrote "me," I think you meant "noobs."
---
At least your dad's in the shower, mines not even in the house...
---
that and i was 9 years old
---
Toon Town
---
Yeah jagex after lazy and incompetent. The voting system is the only reason they haven't completely dumpstered this game like rs3
---
It’s an old bug from monkey madness 2 iirc. They ban most of the people that abuse it.
---
Just get one made dude
---
1550ish total but with sub 10mil bank
---
It already seems to be dying unfortunately. The mobile launch was amazing but most almost all new players that joined and had never played before have left.
---
It's sadly not the type of game that'll ever get new players pretty much, therefore when an active user gets bored and leave (which seems to be a current trend), there's no one to replace them.
---
And on top of that we all know how awful Jagex is at managing the game...
---
No.
---
Have you ever kissed a man?
---
I mean there's been a shitton of bots for the entirety of the game's history. Gold buying and selling was probably even more prevalent back then when the kids on rs spent their Christmas money on gold.
---
I don't get why people don't understand this. Im glad you do. All I used to do is PK but its so broken with gmaul at every single bracket its ruined it for me.
---
Why do you have two reddit accounts
---
i got my vorki at 8kc :))
---
Tiaras are faster for xp but gold bars to gold amulets (u) give around 30 gp profit per amulet and you still level up pretty fast
---
Typically when Jagex puts dev time into something they're very reluctant to remove it despite it's negative effects on the game. This will most likely be another band aid fix like the old bh fix/lms, where they put some easily by passed req of 150 skill total on the world to be able to participate. Heres to hoping they're willing to evolve from this line of thinking though.
---
I might have, not sure tho...
---
"I can't believe no one saw that coming"
---
"Everyone who PKs saw that coming"
---
"Everyone who DOESN'T PK saw that coming and were accused of spite voting"
---
"Please don't use this mistake on Jagex as a way to further spite pking"
---
&gt;Used as a soapbox
---
You can't be serious here. The dude is directly replying to the comment asking that people don't use Jagex's fuck ups as an excuse to strike down PVP shit in the future. If this is using him as a soapbox, then I guess that's what every back and forth conversation is.
---
And are you seriously going to say there's an anti pker BS circlejerk? If you have 90% of the sub all in lock step and downvoting something through the floor simply for disagreeing, that's a circlejerk. You can't just go and label the 10% that gets pissed off at that as a circle jerk as well. Yeah, the comments that always end up downvoted through the floor by an actual circlejerk, those are actually actually a circle jerk too!
---
Because you can just make iron in the blast furnace for more xp and money per hour.
---
Rs gold dropped 10% in value irl
---
They are lvl 30-35 combat. Lvl 30 combat is the minimum requirement to do bounty hunter.
---
Long tap the red report button above the chatbox and select "hide player report option".
---
Quality is shit but he's holding up 4 fingers. Nice try boomer.
---
Thank you
---
PvP is a tiny portion of the player base and unfortunately you have to be an actual pker to understand how broken of a mechanic it is.
---
Well what did you say then? Surely you've said some borderline awful things if your defense is "I didn't receive evidence" instead of "I didn't do anything wrong".
---
The bots got eachother as targets. Then 1 of them kills the other one, gives bounty hunter points. Every kill is worth around 100k-200k. They don't need supplies to do so, only a glory to get back in edgeville and possibly a weapon to speed up the kills.
---
They have already done it.
---
That’s so sweet
---
Okay but if you have access to OSRS source files, you can literally just create gold and then spoof some backlogs to make it look like it came from somewhere else. Put it on account with further spoofed credentials. It's 10x easier to simply edit a file than it is to create and manage a large scale bot farm...
---
"seems"
---
no proof, didn't happen
---
for sure, i'm english and i'm not doing shit on any weekend i don't care what kind of crisis is happening at work lmao
---
Rings of forging are f2p?? This changes everything
---
tbf winter 2007 probably had some of the lowest bot counts in RS2 history because it was right after the removal of free trade and wilderness which crippled RWT which was the main reason behind bots in the first place back then.
---
how many accts are you enjoying it with?
---
I also think it's because our Lord and Savior Swampletics is leading our people to The Promised Land
---
I can make you the pin.
---
Pussy
---
You blind?
---
Do Slayer until u have gp  for 84 con then grind vork  until u have good mage gear then continue slayer while barraging all the tasks u can. And if u also have good range gear unlock boss tasks and do all boss variances of normal tasks ei dks grotesques cerb etc
---
This was my second favorite holiday event. Nothing can top the toy factory Diango's fairies had where players built an assortment of toys and puppets and were given winter scarfs and hats.
---
why support a game that doesnt ban macros/bots anymore? just move on dude they can care less all they care about is the amount of subs. This game is the same as the last legs of ultima online everybody or 80%+ of the community  botting and the devs not giving a damn sht til it died out. We are at the end game of this game which is scripts vs scripts and the last few that are too miserable to quit this shit show.
---
That's the imp catcher quest?
---
"Everyone gets the joke but there's no way to tell if he's being sarcastic?" What?
---
I still play that. No shame
---
What slayer master are you using?
---
Entry level programmers who have no idea wtf they are doing runing a game for 100000 people its amazing
---
Pvp is done — the game will follow suit. We had a good run.
---
Ultimately decided to go for the Chin pet. Put in atleast like 4/5 hours a day for 2 weeks to go from 80-99 hunter at Red Chins. Sadly no pet yet but the grind continues. Made 64m off the chins btw for anyone interested!
---
Congrats!
---
you probably reset your streak at the slayer master in burthorpe which allows u to get a new task without use of points with the collateral of resetting your streak to 0 and then i think the next 10 tasks are 0 pts before you start ti gain pts
---
See second image.
---
What is the difference between the first 2.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
To those of you who dont understand, the lure is to get the person teled into deep wildy where your team waits to pk the victim. I had it happen to be in RS3 back in the day.
---
Already posted.
---
Never been in to RWT but this is what makes me want to be 😂
---
That was my first 99 about 12 years ago congrats
---
That explains why my f2p alt was the only one at  al kharid furnace. I cant believe i wasted so much time there lol.
---
The points gained is dependent on which Slayer master you get your task from. Sounds like you've been doing 24 Turael tasks. [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slayer\_master](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slayer_master)

no.

1 tick karambwans is around 1m xp/hr at max efficiency, no way you can hold that efficiency without killing your wrists tho
---
Not really
---
Yes, it's a bad way of viewing how luck works. You could kill a million demons and it'd have no effect on your 1,000,001st kill's drop chances of the whip. The drop rate remains the same for every single kill you do
---
1/100 or 1/200 isnt that lucky tbh
---
had pet prior to this! no extra pets achieved.
---
Had this aswell, but dont worry, ive had some luck after. Got vorki at around 230kc and rocky at 68 thiev :) but now all my rng is gone and im 2 times the droprate for a zulrah unique
---
This is one of the most loser things I’ve seen on this sub
---
Mind runew wtf?
---
See second image
---
Well thats too bad :( any tips on what to train next then?
---
^please ^don't ^say ^"alot"
---
Yet my 3 year old account gets perma banned in one day for using macros to get a few firemaking lvls.....nice
---
Fraud 🦀
---
You know the worst thing is, bots are only going to get better until the point where they are completely undetectable, I'm actually worried about the future of online gaming :(
---
Get that hunter/range/slayer up.
---
Damn bro gratz! I got 99 craft in f2p with ruby necklaces and it made me 25m. How much did you make on your grind?
---
A lot of the content creators genuinely like it without exploiting it (Framed, Torvesta, Sparc)
---
Toontown online
---
And it would make it more rewarding for the people who take the risk to do so. Less people farming it, the higher the value of the uniques.
---
This game is in the middle of a nosedive and it just keeps getting steeper.
---
It is exactly that lucky
---
Trust me after the chicken coop you will never have this problem again. This never happens

I completed MM2 but i cant get to the range chinning area without failing the first agility obstacle despite having completed the quest. currently 65 agility what gives...?

Not much, like 1.3m but I like it because it was more afking.

This was the year I started playing rs!! Memories forsure
---
There's no point. Everyone who actually does Vorkath already knows.
---
I hate what I’ve become. I would always log on to do holiday events regardless of whether or not I had currently been playing but I had missed one right before mobile had come out and now I play more than ever and can’t bring myself to do them anymore. Am I the only one? I’m not an efficient scape freak by any means this is just a feeling that haunts me every seasonal event now.
---
I like to grind at work hahaha
---
Let me know when hit gets into the $0.3X. I remember a year or two ago when the market was destroyed and people were trying to offload their gold for cheap
---
Check your tire pressures
---
Marginally, yes. Worth it if you have a pair already or plan on camping Vorkath for a long period.
---
I mean why not p2p :D
---
Even more impressive on f2p though
---
Print 10,000 krakens and we will take over the world
---
I thought 99 was the max for skills on OSRS
---
Oh snap, I didn't know you could scroll images like that.
---
I know your pain but the feeling of getting to log in after days of unsuccessful attempts was just THE BEST.
---
You can say its inflation if you want, but the only other time gold prices have fallen at this rate in this time frame was during the rat pits dupe in 2015, the corp nifl and mod Jed selling large sums of hacked gold. This is also in an era where jagex has a 100b+ a week gold sink via the duel arena.
---
I remember doing a ton of fishing training in Catherby as a kid. It was amazing place to chill, there were so many people to chat with. Only issue was getting there took me forever since, at the time, I wasn't aware you could just tele to Camelot and walk SW. I just went from Fally, through Taverly, and over WWM every time I needed to get back to Catherby. Those white wolfs just tore in to my low-level ass the whole way through the mountain pass every time.
---
My go-to when starting out, and what I told friends who got into the game, Chaos Druids in the Edgeville Dungeon are fairly good gp/hr.I remember rates of 250k gp/hr when I did them, depends on how lucky you get with ranarr drops. Not great for long term, but to train up melee stats a bit and make some decent cash, all the way.
---
Rune scimmy, glory, and maybe even a snakeshin or dragonhide shield and you're all set. 30k setup, 0 risk. Get a looting bag when you're out there, pick up all herbs worth more than 1k, and bank when your bag and inventory are full. Try a run or two out, see if it works for you.(The shield is for their weakening magic spells. Will make em splash more)
---
im not sure if that really applies to classic lol i mean for most people it truly is rose-tinted glasses. the game is literally just a walking simulator where you practically auto-attack or use 1-2 abilities all the way to 60, and at 60 there is no content except getting pre-raid bis (Which you don't even need at all ) for raids literally clearable by people in greens who aren't even max level lmfao. most of the people who play it probably level to 6 and that's that.
---
Lololol damn I laughed
---
See ya in a week
---
Does this mean you have to get 200m hp xp before you can start any combat at all?
---
Post about it on reddit, and hope u get enough upvotes for jagex to do something
---
I played it also, I just didn't like the controls mostly it's like well... Meh
---
Welp, apparently I'm in the same boat LOL. I got my lance at 81m, dhcb for 112. So I guess I'm breaking even
---
this was the best event ever
---
1 min or less consistent kills? You must be always hitting those ruby specs are ya?
---
Yeah they based the original IOS apps on that afaik, back in the same time period. Maplestory Thief edition and Cygnus Knights edition.
---
Nah they need to go back to 4 mil or less
---
Where else can you furnish a house with with poop items

Ways to bypass 2fa on the website, but I mean the bank pin probably wouldn't protect you since it's not terribly difficult to guess with basic information about a person.

Technically "rev caves" includes that entire cave, so the RoW(i) will double the rate you get clue scrolls. It makes cannoning the green dragons the #1 way to get hard clues (Besides imps)

having to ask my dad whenever I wanted to install something was like hell cause he always said stuff like "theres nothing thats free blabla"

I see you are also a man of culture, that shit was so fucking fun
---
For efficient gp/xp I would stick with willows for regular tree patches (if you're bothering to do them at all, personally I wouldn't bother especially if you're above 85 farming) and papayas for fruit tree patches. I got 99 farming off of basically just daily papayas + calquats, with hardwoods and hespori whenever possible. If you have SotE completed then also mix in crystal trees once or twice a day
---
Wow! So you’re saying you should be head of their anti cheat team! 
---
r/Jagex hire this man
---
Yeah i still hop on toontown rewritten sometimes
---
sadly you're wrong. DHL is now the new meta with the new helm. That's why DHCB dropped 20m and is still dropping. DHL rose 10m+ and is still rising.
---
Pretty sure you’re right. I think redwood logs are faster xp.
---
Money will become less valuable, therefore it will cost more to buy things. Bonds included.
---
Yeah with 99 range and max gear I've got 1000 kills and never had a sub 1:00. My average is probably like 1:40.
---
I've been enjoying it too. I feel like most people shitting on it and complaining are people who don't even PK or haven't done a lot of the old BH. Sure it can and should be improved but its definitely better than old BH.
---
