I would call this fair because he‚Äôs not maximizing his possibilities and he didn‚Äôt spend 1000 hours editing that video. 
---
He put in over 1000 hours of effort then released one video, didn‚Äôt stream, didn‚Äôt put out a spoiler. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong his videos are great but If he is trying to make a living off of YouTube by releasing one 20 minute video every 2 months he‚Äôs doing it wrong.

---
I have one actually :) it's in the description of every video but it's pretty far down there
---
Everyday something new comes out proving Jagex has no idea what they are doing
---
Never happened to me once

I've noticed in older osrs videos there were servers beginning from 1, explanation?
---
Understandable, have a nice day
---
I just recently started playing again. I got my mining, woodcutting and fishing all to lvl 40 but my combat lvl is only 10. Maybe I should wait a little before I become a member?
---
As if Amazon is any better... Cute comment

I am ashamed by the fact that I didn't use every random exp boost I've had so far on RC...

Lmfaooo

I'll check it out when I get home. You should plug it more in your videos.
---
some people used to, and the name stuck
---
Torvesta has 3x the monthly views because he puts out more videos.
---
Start streaming I just read the guy under you. 100% agree.
---
That‚Äôs our meme you dip. Everyone in this sub has seen this a million times over.
---
Make a new account and don't be toxic this time if you want to be able to talk
---
The reality of the situation is that long high effort content has been blatantly unprofitable on youtube for 5 years+, all animators quit because of that. You can make a ton of money streaming, though.

Petition for Saitama pet. 1/10000 chance for one hitting monsters
---
11 uniques, aside from jar and pet, at 2850kc is also insanely unlucky man, i feel for you
---
With that whole meme going on idek if this real or not lmao. Did I fell for the meme????
---
We all know YouTube doesn‚Äôt care about the time put in, so why is it ‚ÄúI made $50 on a video that took 300 hours‚Äù? In another comment he made on here he broke it down to ‚Äò16 cents per hour‚Äô.  Could you not see hat for yourself? I think we all would be on his side if he just pointed out ‚Äú$50 for 117k views is low‚Äù but the fact he‚Äôs using his hours put in like it‚Äôs suppose to matter is what‚Äôs causing the divide with some people.
---
When I'm doing shop-shit it takes just a few minutes to buy 5 then value, buy 5 then value and continue down to the point of break even. 
---
So then from that point I know, buy any rune in stock until stock reaches XYZ for example.
---
I have never been "toxic" or mean to anyone on runescape? I always minded my own business
---
That's what you get for voting no to warding.
---
Don't forget the charge cost too. Not sure how much those shards are valued at currently, but it would probably not be that great. Though there is always room for a special spade from elsewhere.
---
Yeah if that was true you wouldn't have been perm muted
---
Oof xD nvm then
---
Okay Bernie Sanders.
---
People keep comparing him to Torvesta. Torvesta has over 3x the monthly views as Settled because he makes more video. I‚Äôm not saying one works harder than the other, but you have to put out more content to get more money.
---
I guess I'll do my part and pause ad block ONLY on his videos
---
As Jagex would say my man, there are no exceptions for self restricted accounts... lol
---
Correct quote ‚Äúwanting more than 16 cents per hour isn‚Äôt greedy‚Äù... so ya, tell me more about how you missed the hours playing a part.
---
thermy
---
That's the thing I dont know how I got muted. When i click on the evidence thing it just says severe advertising or something I've never advertised anything on runescape.
---
Toolbelt takes away tons of the challenges that rs3 brings
---
PLEASE advertise your patreon!
---
Upvote for visibility
---
Makes sense, I was wondering too if the fact he uploads so inconsistently and low frequency has something to do with unfavorable ads placement
---
**THE LEEEVER.... LEEEEVEEER**
---
At least he‚Äôll take a plastic golden gnome at runefest (:
---
Ahhh advertised a phising website or gold selling website
---
Im gonna need to see your loot tab for proof!
---
Shuds stayed in school
---
I'm a support player and used to play Taric from time to time back in the good old days.
---
I came my pants the second an enemy would blind pick Kalista and came a second time when I insta locked Taric.
---
I know what phishing is but how the heck to you sell gold in rs
---
Yes. f2p is basically a free trial. Membership unlocks most of the world, most items, a lot of skills, and most quests.
---
A woodcutter with the lumberjack would be cool next drawing. Sick picture
---

---
Always, good place to start is the optimal Quest guide on the wiki, it will work you through the skills and Quests in member areas. You're gaming experience is way better even if you're still low level
---
Yikes no wonder pots and herbs are cheap as hell
---
can you boost for this quest? and geez herb and construction are going to be expensive...
---
Not anymore sadly.
---
My mistake then, when you said ‚Äúadvertised as if it was offensive‚Äù I thought you were saying it WAS restricted.
---
Which is kinda dumb cause kids don‚Äôt buy shit anyway
---
Bottom line I asked someone I knew how to get help they told me to check reddit. I'm just here for help I have done nothing wrong that i know of nor would i purposely do something sinister.
---
Get membership.
---
A terrible repost at that, so tired of this dumb pic
---
On normal mode its perfectly fine. I'm a pretty low-tier player in terms of skill, but I can consistently finish the normal gauntlet even with bad RNG.
---
Without hitting through prayer, it would make gathering food and armor pointless, and gathering/crafting is supposed to be a central point of the gauntlet. Plus, thats just too much of a reward for "skillful" play considering this is basically a demonic gorilla boss with some extra movement.
---
As for food taking to much time, again, haven't had much of a problem with it. I think people are overreacting to it because they're used to bosses that they can never (or rarely) take damage from. Its just something you have to accommodate for. Bringing T2 armor and more food makes it perfectly manageable. 
---
Can't say much about the hard gauntlet though. That is a bit above my skill range. However, I don't think the normal mode should be nerfed in order to make an optional hard mode more bearable.
---
It's called NH because many years ago it was considered no honour to farcast (barrage and stand out of melee range), pray, pj, safe and tele. It's always been the most skillful way of pking but the name stuck because most people have always pked in Edgeville where you can run or tele if someone doesn't follow the rules. These days "NH" is not considered an insult, just a type of pking.
---
So your saying that less effort/inefficiency gives less resources per hour because it takes longer to kill a monster or perform a task. Is that not what he's complaining about? Not wanted to tick manipulate and getting shit loot because of it?
---
You have to say to yourself badoodle right as zulrah dies.
---
Basically Jagex has been giving massive farms free membership for 8 months+ now and they have done nothing about it.
---
Is there any way to use a streaming platform like a tv platform?  "Stream" the premier of new videos to allow new donations before it is released on Youtube after it premiers?
---
Congrats.
---
rip 1m
---
I just don't use reddit very often and i don't know my other accounts log in info
---
Nice
---
it sucks because I really like gorillas but it's infuriating.  
---
Jagex just doesnt seem to be willing to spend the time to go back and fix existing content.
---
Revolver Ocelot
---
It's quite literally identical to a Ghrazi Rapier but slash instead of stab. It doesn't need a special attack.
---
Imagine not knowing how to take a screenshot in 2019
---
Wow, that is some next level stuff.  I just want to hit dragons with my friend haha.
---
Thank you for the example!
---
Those worlds are still RS3 worlds. OSRS starts at 301
---
Boo downvote this man
---
Isnt it about $4.18 per 1000 ad views?  Which we could assume is a 1:1 for monetized views?  Which would still mean he shouldve made 500, which is still pretty shit.
---
I just threw up in my mouth a bit.
---
But real talk about Amethyst, that dwarf teasing us that we humans couldn't possibly make structures out of it like their skilled craftsmen could still triggering me.
---
Should have a 92-99 Construction set for Amethyst and a new underground Dwarven theme for houses to boot.
---
nice
---
What a cool kid
---
Imagine playing runescape as a full time job and being mad you only make 25$ a month..better call the welfare office if you haven‚Äôt already
---
But that was to distinguish from falador guards. The changes here and from 2012 era were completely "if it isn't broke don't fix it" type of changes. Freaking stupid
---
Got to admire the fashionscape
---
Clicks a computer screen for living, demands thousands of dollars
---
Then you have one more thing in common. :)
---
You need to use the ones with mind runes I think.  Dont quote me, but that's what I remember
---
Just quit playing now and jagex will get scared and replace him with an imp
---
It‚Äôs almost as if capitalism doesn‚Äôt give a shit about good content/ good quality stuff.. ü§î
---
why the fuck does this have 5,000 upvotes and 700 comments
---
pretty sure his gear is meta bro
---
Three weeks in a row and still no response. Why do the highest allotment(Snape Grass) not make supercompost? Fix it you cowards!
---
Someone here posted saying they were getting around 20FPS
---
My 1st reddit post ever too lol
---
So i went to google and asked to refund it and they said alright, but im still member on the noob account so im clueless now
---
Imagine having such a strong cognitive bias that you seriously, unironically think that botting is GOOD for the game. 
---
Holy fuck dude. I hope every account you have gets banned
---
Similar situation with Maplestory. My friend's mom started playing because she saw me playing it. Couple months later, way after we all quit, she maxed her character to level 200.
---
Your twitch prime alone would already be 1/20th of what he just made lol
---
If you think this is bad check out Baby Yaga on Lunar Island. Cunts a straight scammer. Bloods are 1,400 each when shop stock is down to 1 lol.
---
 Improvise.adapt.overcome
---
Although, I 100% agree that you should be paid the correct amount for your efforts you need to just work on better revenue streams. You‚Äôve said that you‚Äôre nearing TOB, but what happens afterwards. 
---
I really hope you get a patreon, stream, and sell Merch or something that matches your efforts. I really hope the best.
---
I hate to break this to you but runescapes not exactly marketed to be some massively challenging game. It‚Äôs a point and click combat system and outside the absolute highest end content (raids, infernal) the games not challenging. Saying something isn‚Äôt challenging is a stupid argument considering no one has ever said clicking an agility shortcut and hoping you succeed is a particularly difficult task. The game is frustrating and grindy and believe it or not people actually like that. Changing something because it isn‚Äôt difficult is just stupid, no skill and almost no quests are even remotely challenging in runescape. The only challenge in basically any skill or quest is literally just how grindy they are.
---
I admit I've only ever bought lunars from her. Is there a list of each store with what rune is worth buying from it?
---
Also bloods in prif were 1200 at like 100 stock lol
---
Go click on his ads to do something abt it
---
Pretty sure Netflix is in debt but brings in enough cash flow to continue operating/investing. They aren't actually profitable.
---
I even clicked on swamps ads so he gets paid. Tbh Swamp daddy just needs a good swamp-patreon
---
Its a meme lol
---
!remind me 2 days
---
Portal on first rope and no ticks lost is a 1:03. Weird thing is having a global timer on it, as it definitely cannot go below a fixed time like that.
---
he responded to my tweet so we are basically friends, if you need something hit me up
---
"I'm going to vape u/MagicbroOS' Swampwater"
---
That's what his mama told him.
---
I use Patreon to support creators I enjoy. I don't care for exclusive content.
---
Yeah that's a smart plan, you could do farm runs but that would take a decent bit longer (5-10 minutes) which you might not want to spend.
---
Nobody fuckin cares you god damn loser lol get an irl life
---
YouTube splits all ad revenue 55 45.
---
Fairy ring code AKQ brings you right there.
---
I imagine there will be an overlay that count exactly what you‚Äôve picked up so you k ow exactly what‚Äôs left that you are looking for
---
Ah yes, i'm a loser for not having a whip on an ironman, except that i do but im also a loser for that too because i have no life. I find it funny that despite the fact that you posted this 11 hours ago, you respond instantly. I think it's clear who needs to get a life.
---
Do some figure drawing, weeb
---
Can someone explain the chestbrah meme?
---
4 cb lvls away rip
---
They'd poll buffs but not nerfs.
---
No this is legit him. I‚Äôm in his clan. 100% serious
---
Well you shouldn't have spent 300 hour making it so. 
---
Know your value. If you make a video for the fans then make it for the fans but don't expect dolla in return for your fan made videos.
---
Fire spells giving a burn effect, lowering damage by x% over time would be cool to see.
---
Earth spells giving a random accuracy lowering effect would be nice too.
---
Water spells would be tricky, lowering run energy/turning off run (forcing players to walk) could be a new meta in game when it comes to pking and would make normal spellbook even more viable.
---
Air spells would be a bit tricky too, a knockback effect akin to a gust of wind literally knocking the receiving player back a few tiles would be cool to see.
---
DoT spells should and would be a nice update to see in game, as long as they are all balanced.
---
the guy has his numbers wrong lol
---
1. Target audience
---
2. Outside sponsorship
---
3. All creators get a 55 45 split.
---
Oh wow. Today I learned. Doesn‚Äôt apply to me though cause I‚Äôm addicted lol
---
They get 55% of the ad revenue.
---
idk if he's just walking around with the intent to making money
---
Yeah, right after he finished drawing her
---
Yep. Ahh the ol days.
---
If there was a DoT poison related spell, an antipoison potion could just lower the time remaining as well as lowering the damage taken, higher versions of the antipoison potion could remove the time entirely (or more time removed) as well as lower the damage even further or entirely.
---
When will you post the results?
---
Fishermen usually make 10-20k in a couple months. Working for a fishery/cannery usually gets you 4-7k after taxes in a month or so (a little bit of June and most of July). You don't need to worry about getting a flight there or back (usually a grand or so) or the more dangerous work environment in a fishery job but everything up in Alaska carries some level of risk.
---
Well said, very insightful.
---
Do you feel awkward?
---
I remember doing that Questline in RS3 not too long ago. That part really stood out to me because it's like the only time in a quest where an NPC processes something for you, and instead them either finishing it right away or you doing another task for them while you wait, you literally just sit there for 40s until the dialogue changes.
---
yeah D scim has a spec bar being 60 attack weapon and all the higher tier 75 main hand weapons now don't have a spec so pking with them is aids lmao mods are fkn dumb
---
I guess this explains why so many resources such as herb seeds are crashing
---
Is it just me or is this a repost?
---
In every video he puts out his friend chestbrah always plays a role and he is always mentioned at least once using a fancy name typed out, as well as with some voice editing software to make it sound cool.
---
No theres not. Waiting for something in a quest affects the time it takes to do said quest. And youre just a bad player if you cant account for the loss of time. 
---
If you have to plant seeds in a quest, does it make sense if they grow instantly because of "unnecessary time gates" or does it make sense for them to grow in the same way all other farming patches would grow? This is really common sense.
---
‚ÄúWild CC‚Äù
---
The clan chat also has an associated podcast! Called ‚ÄúThe Wilderness Podcast‚Äù
---
&gt;there are such a high number of players that dont want a new skill in the first place.
---
To be honest I wouldn't be surprised if 25% of voters were like this. Can't really blame them though, new skill would be something we haven't seen before with big impact on the game. I'd personally love Sailing, not a fan of buyable skills like Warding. But can't see a new skill passing the poll anytime soon, so I hope they drop the idea for now and work on other parts of the game.
---
That's the worst luck I've ever seen I have 270 kc and have 3 full sets + tome and over 150 pages
---
Grats! I got myself 1 kill and didn‚Äôt come back until I was almost maxed total with max gear lol
---
I recognize that smug nose-picking facecam
---
its from the fire cape attempt clip huh
---
Congrats :) I also saw you overshot the original post and typod a 24 ;)
---
If it only needed it to be charged once and made it untradeable I would have totally been on board with it, even without a special attack. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like too much thought was put into this weapon.
---
You keep untradeables so you're good.
---
Yup but there‚Äôs a lot of people in this thread that don‚Äôt understand that
---
That's really cool thanks!
---
Yes typically but this is clearly not the case right now
---
Wonder why jagex chose him to pay for sponsored video. It must be his regular audience are a demographic they are trying to attract to the game. But I'm at work and can't access YouTube.
---
Join the cc and hang out with us :)

You can join before having the req's, we will still take you raiding you just cant earn ranks until you get the reqs

Lots of osu! training helps

Gotcha, thank you!

You probably received it from a previous crate.

Huh?

Settings ‚Üí RuneLite ‚Üí "Enable client always on top". If you don't use RuneLite then a program called DeskPins might work.

Seems like you somehow got shadowbanned or something, in any case it's some bullshit.

Do you have a bitcoin address? It's probably the only way I could donate.

Why would you out me like that? :(

Definitely agree but can‚Äôt afford yet. Would hasta be bestter than bp?

I don't believe this. I've taken multiple weeks off of playing and my offers have sat in the GE.

Shifts the graphical renderings from cpu to gpu

SettledRS I'm sorry my man. Are you able to request manual review yet?
---
I also got that you ascribe yourself to "movements" and believe there are systems at play that keep people down you can change those systems with said "movements." 
---
I don't necessarily blame you fot believing that, you just want to be the good guy. The reality is everything is a chaotic mess of individuals and the idea that there are "systemic injustices" in our so-called system is the irrational identification of nepotism that's a naturally occuring part of human behavior mixed with the absolute clusterfuck of chaotic individual choices. Like I said, that's not really important. You just want to be part of something larger than yourself and manifest it as an online zealot, and when your buzzwords fade away to time you'll move on to whatever new thing your group of 5 or so friends ascribes to.
---
Tl;dr: get laid lol :y
---
I don‚Äôt trust you Mat is literally the best player in the game dude
---
I don't even know where Neat_On_The_Rocks pulled 1.6 million views figure from..
---
Who fucking cares, you little babies are so entitled. I swear you all have massive Aspergers and are are glued to your computer chairs 24/7 from shitting and pissing yourselves, it‚Äôs  the only way you‚Äôd notice and it care about any of these changes.
---
d med helm is the polar opposite of fashionscape

it better be a 13m exp lamp for rc or i'm gonna instantly downvote

I‚Äôm almost 1100 WT kc and never paid attention to that lol

Haha it took me a second to even realise the first time. :)

Lol

The usernames of the accounts are japanese names

Depends on your melee stats compared to range. I think hasta setup is faster than budget range gear.
---
Probably picked it up
---
Settled thing

Literally died doing slayer due to afking too much and the DC'd. Thought I was shit outta luck for about 40m. Close call
---
Reddit is all knowing. That drop rate was 50/50
---
Huskies or riot
---
again, every example you've given are illegal. botting isnt. feel free to try again
---
No. You stand alone.
---
Fairy ring is right there but im assuming you dont have that done/unlocked yet.
---
You need to do the eagles peak quest or whatever anyway to hunt chins. So with that said, buy a necklace of passage and tele to the desert eagle station and take it. It'll get you close to grey chins. Or to the outpost.
---
Nah that's a red cape.
---
Great to know I can only get this form of customer service from reddit with 3K+ upvotes!! (:
---
Excellent
---
:(
---
So the 20 year olds should play it on a loop without adblockers
---
twitch.tv/al\_thanii
---
Both are maxed. Well def is 95
---
I do love grindy mmorpgs lol. I will play it in an hour or so lol
---
Calm down, making a few minor changes isn't going to kill the game.
---
Nah, J1mmy quest when he finishes by release
---
I'm like, 90% sure chestbra is just rendi's alt and there isn't a second person behind it
---
My main
---
Famous last words
---
It's not a few minor changes. Increased Rune stock, making a large amount of quests easier, etc. but here's the thing, it's not the fact that it's these changes it's the fact that these were done UNDER the radar. We had to find these, who knows how many more there are and if they intend to keep doing this with other content.
---
I've thought this while watching many times, I think he would make way more by changing around his ad style. You only get the money if the viewer doesn't skip the ad from my understanding. People usually aren't going to just wait for four 3 minute ads to play during the video.
---
Literally take ALL the fun out of it. And you cant spell efficiency with put most of the word Fun
---
You've 100% gone through all dialogue options with baxtorian? Tried hopping worlds?
---
*cries in ironman*
---
For phone numbers are there not free websites and services for mobile verification?
---
For max attempts at certain credit or debit  cards  can you not just use PayPal to get around that ?
---
Yeah there are tons of things that give xp and no pet. This pic is super fake
---
No you didn't. Stop trying to act big and powerful online. It's already proven that this method is not as overpowered as many have thought. Also I don't understand why do people have a boner lying about their gold bot farms and inflating the numbers by a fuck ton to seem better online. 
---
Successful criminals or people who break the rules don't fucking brag about it because that's how they got successful in the first place. By keeping their low profile. You just act like an edgy kid who pretends to make absolute bank with bots where in reality you are making at best a regular minimum wage in most developed countries.
---
Yes, went 100% through the dialogs. I was able to find the other one in the poison waste. Hopped worlds, logged off, closed client, nothing seems to work :/
---
Ur fault
---
Safespotting..... pvm bosses......  
---
2 words that are not supposed to go together.
---
If you're still gonna argue, i have no more words.
---
Just standardize the elf model, without making it look just like a normal human npc with long ears
---
Farming pet is really rare. You are expexted to get 99 many times over to get the pet unless you do the low xp, high pet chance crops
---
Yeah I fucked that up, mb
---
Those are exactly what I'd call minor changes lol. Would you have noticed them if nobody had pointed them out to you? Do they affect you in any way? This community seems to fall deep into the slippery slope fallacy over every little thing.
---
It probably isn't
---
Yeah I got them mixed up, mb
---
Thats fair
---
I hate you for even putting this quest idea in their head
---
Same thing with my friends mum! My friends best mate got hacked and was miserable about it, so she thought it would be a good idea to make him an account to replace the one had had lost.
---
She ended up maxing the account and i believe still plays. She also got into other MMOs because of RS like WoW, was one of the clan leaders of Echo of Silence back in the golden days of rs, and her clan members and WoW guildies even called/call her mum.
---
Get your magic level up, utilize an imbued heart/magic potion/tormented bracelet/ancestral, check DPS calculator to see if trident is worth using at your level over things like Ibans or Fire wave
---
That's not how drops work my dude.
---
OSRS has been out for the past 6 years and it grew massively over this period of time. If your original game is almost 20 years old, you rerelease Oldschool servers and manage to get over 500.000 active subscriptions over the past 6 years and beat your previous profit records I am pretty sure it has already exceeded any expectations and one could argue that 6 years for an mmo is insanely long term.
---
Dancing around the iron rocks till aggro ran out, or you were saved by a passerby

It doesn't let you know in game.

I'd be more pissed at my non Jewish parents for mutilating my dick and making orgasms less pleasurable for literally no reason, but to each their own I guess

I'd be upset if that alpha male responded any differently.

I miss my w67 danish world ;(

A 20 minute video with 4 ads only netting $50 is extremely low. YouTube is taking a large cut of the ad revenue.
---
&gt; Is vorkath worth it with no melee switch or dhcb?  
---
Doubt it 
---
&gt;Any tips for getting the one zulrah kill for Western hard? 
---
You can try a mage-only kill; there are plenty of Youtube guides for that strategy. Zulrah is definitely worth learning though so maybe just dive in and give it a shot? 
---
&gt; Pest control sucks sucks sucks. 
---
Ye
---
Yeah I can teach you let's play
---
Yes, but its not likely
---
Imagine if he spent 300 hours learning to code as an example. It would have likely resulted in more than a $50 return. It was a good video, but can't be too mad about wasting your time on OSRS.
---
I voted yes i loved warding, and osrs truely needed that skill, saddly it didnt pass, you can vote whatever you want tho
---
Void is iconic
---
Somehow typed that and posted it with my phone in my pocket.
---
Heard there was a bug if you talked to Lady Hefin first.  
---
  
---
Just in case go back to Baxtorian and ask how to find Lord Crwys, also try using the official client if that helps with your problem.
---
Your account wouldn't have its old stats on osrs, those stats would be on rs3. You could try appealing the ban on the website, but you're probably better off making a new account.
---
Onyx armor here i come
---
Okay so this seems to have fixed it...I'm not sure why but...on OSBuddy the tree isn't there like at all...but on Runelite it is....I know it sounds weird but I'm 100% serious right now...maybe some plugin on OSBuddy was breaking it or something? I dont know.
---
not ur buddy, pal

If you were being disruptive, I could see that.

The only simple solution here is streaming

The problem occurs in this "simple solution" when you realize that Twitch is very much the same beast as YouTube, they solely a profit driven derivative of a Mega Corporation that does not care about the user base.
---
In rectifying this problem, you move to a platform that is relatively new, with low traffic, and you make far less money and get much less exposure.
---
I hope you find a way to fight this beast
---
Fuck the chairs. Id buy him a gf

I mean Settled‚Äôs career.
---
If he isn‚Äôt making videos on YouTube, he isn‚Äôt making videos. There is no alternative. If you‚Äôre telling the man to abandon his entire career path because of some unfavorable circumstances I can‚Äôt get behind that. 
---
I‚Äôm a firm believer that corporations can get too big for ‚Äòvoting with your wallet‚Äô to work. When something has achieved complete cultural penetration like YouTube/Google have, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible. It works in small scale, it even works in large scale, but it doesn‚Äôt work on a Google scale.

I remember reading sometime around 2012-2013 that 8/10 twitch viewers use ad blocker

one of the earliest deaths I remember is from a regular scorpion... not even the king scorpion... yeah I don't know how I died to easily avoidable shit like that as a kid lol

Not a bad idea.

This post exactly. All these fools...merely *living*! Do they not know there are gains to be made!

The answer will always be yes

Sounds perfectly reasonable to me

How do you kill em? BP + prayer?

Ranching is stupid

Same! In Al Kharid lol

you dont stand next to vorkath in melee so he can melee you....

That‚Äôs more than enough as a kid who *isnt even in college yet*.

You have my support. Anything to bring back dogs like how they were back in 2008.
---
If the quest was F2P and Gertrude's Cat was made F2P, this will be a win-win as free players would then get their choice between cats and dogs.

I think it's if you place an item on every pillar, and at least one is wrong. The room gets flooded and you appear outside the tomb.

Yeah he didnt get chain banned. Isnt that interesting
---
i mean click wise, it's a lot more clicks per xp. which given op listed two very low effort mining methods seems to be his goal
---
It's also similar to collegiate wrestling where you want to decrease your weight to get into the lowest weight class possible for your skeletal build
---
I don't really understand the purpose of the gathering timer in regular guantlet. Like in the challenge mode sure whatever, but seriously if someone just wants to chill and take their time gathering shit and do a boss fight I don't see what the problem with that would be. Sure it'll be easier if you get all tier 3 but it'll also be less runs per hour so I feel like it's totally a fair trade off. Not really something I feel strongly about them changing, just a weird design choice imo

Cant wait to say "Swampman is live, cya" in boto's chat

I tried to do some runecrafting and watch some YouTube livestreams at the same time on mobile(s8) but when I press my screen the tap isnt accurate. Like I click the run button but turns on my prayer. Another example is when I tap what I have on equipped it clicks my inventory where food is at. Has this been addressed?
---
You have more than enough time in regular but it‚Äôs just off-putting exploring 90% of the dungeon finding a second weapon frame and t3 monsters. The whole point is a timed challenge and normal is way more forgiving. That being said I really feel like they could at least add a couple more t3 monsters even 2 extra would be nice.
---
For a fun new skill..
---
then people are gonna grind bosses just for highscores and bring more of the already overflowed items into the game. Its not a problem if a boss isnt the best, theres gonna be someone doing it
---
Give me some credit I was really high when I made that comment.
---
The only people that would log in would be people who already want to pvp. If you think the average joe pvmer/skiller is still going to go about their normal business while risking, you're out of your mind.

I remember waiting in the queue to log into world 1 so I could merch in Varrock west bank

Have fun going to jail I'm under age

Already done by someone who did it on a dxp weekend too for as many people as possible to see the broadcast. I've also seen announcements to maxed hcims die to a fire, a cow, a gnome child and the desert heat.
---
You used to be able to switch the language on the homepage and those worlds would have like 30 people in them. Made gathering resources soooo much easier
---
Only if they made it apply to all shops
---
The herblore pet is pretty easy it has a 1/1 drop rate if you stand in seers bank wearing full iron making ppots, btw if it doesn't drop trying hopping to world 420.
---
Can I get the link to this?
---
I think you've got the wrong adblocker lol get uBlock Origin
---
Might be better as a minigame. Or to generate income via micro transactions
---
you're half right, every new bit of pvm has been balanced around blowpipe unfortunately.
---
Yes
---
How old are you?
---
As somebody whos done and still done all types of pking i feel the main reason its dieing out is because of clans. Too many people pking 10+ at revs, the main active soot They log in and every ones dead. ive gone a few times and its not even fun. And its also not fun dieing to them constantly when theres 5 different teams of 10+ people hopping around constantly. This forces the people who are pking solo or 3 man to pk singles, which pisses off other solo people, or to go other dead ass multi spots. Gmaul nerf is a step in the right direction for pvp world/bh though
---
Tl:dr: 10+ man clans killing pking no fun, forces u to either also mass or go singles and die to a 3 man squad in singles since theyve also been chased out of multi
---
I see you all the time in 302/301. Very cool accomplishment. You once allowed me to control the samurai train. Was fun haha
---
Nice, combat lvl?
---
Half ur runs? Do u look for dark beast and skip 6 bears and 12 dragons or some shit? U can easily do t2 bow t3 hally boss kills. Also killing the same demi boss never gives a duplicate t3 upgrade but one u dont have yet.
---
Btw
---
I‚Äôm 124 combat this is just from dying to corrupt a few times lol. Was in discord with my buddy like ‚Äúif I get the mith plate I complete the set‚Äù and then I got it and was laughing about it for a bit
---
That was actually based off of my own observations, so I guess I'll act like I wasn't.
---
This was before finding ANY. T3. There‚Äôs only like 4 spawns and half of the time they‚Äôre in a big clump on the opposite side of where I am.
---
Man I had a series stack of rune med helms by the time I got 99 smithing lol. Thnx for the flashback
---
Actually nice
---
holy fuck. Most I ever did was 20 and I thought that was insane
---
&gt;  I don‚Äôt know how /u/Static_Love can so confidently cite that NO ONE has been banned or hacked as a result of using R+.. he  categorically cannot prove that.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; There are a lot of people claiming that they were hacked days after using R+ and there are a raft of people claiming they were banned for using it.
---
I'd say show proof, but well that would be pointless because no one ever provides proof when asked.. But I can say you can say the same thing with normal runelite since well you see the same claims from people using normal runelite as well, again as usual with no proof whatsoever that runelite was the cause of their ban, and it always being because of something else that caused their ban, not runelite nor runelite+ or any other client (other than actual botting clients obviously).
---
Another thing is there are over 1k+ people who are using R+ (including myself), don't you think if people where getting hacked/banned there would be people complaining about it in the R+ discord server?
---
You can have your own opinion on the plugins, but I can say that people being hacked/banned are for different reasons other than R+
---
Also, most of the time when I kill a duplicate I just get shards so I‚Äôve stopped wasting my time doing that on corrupted.
---
I'm guessing this is why everyone is getting a patrion.
---
For gilded altars how long do the essence last for when you light them?
---
Curious to see if I should use my own altar or use someone else's.

If you have elite diary then chompy bird.

Jad is 1/100 on task.

Easiest i guess is chaos elemental 1/300.

me fucking too, proposed is ugly af
---
Can you link me to a video with a timestamp of this? I'm looking through his videos and I cant find it.
---
You need to watch out. All that luck in one go can set you up for trouble.
---
I now have you tagged as feet boi
---
How did that get into a spongebob episode lmfao.
---
I know, but why have it then? I tried making a set of t3 because I was curious how long it would take.. took me the whole 10 minutes, ending up only having a t2 bow and barely any food. You need 54 resources and on top of that, a crazy amount of shards.
---
That is one of cringiest things I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
Blowpipe if pepega
---
Just want to mention that I found it difficult using a blowpipe and I was taking too much damage, so I switched to dragon crossbow (not dhcb) and it was much easier and I was still getting kills quickly enough. I had ranged in the high 80s though
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so much about having the full set. It‚Äôs more about if you have extra time and resources close to the spawn you could upgrade your legs or something with the extra time.
---
75 for blowpipe would be a big upgrade but it's definitely doable with your stats. All depends how quickly you wanna start. I'd say give it a go right now and see how it goes then reevaluate if necessary. It's unlikely you'll win first try either way so getting some experience now wouldn't hurt and you might find you don't need the blowpipe.
---
You can do it with those sure but if its your first time youll make it harder for yourself. Getting 75 range for a blowpipe will make it a lot easier
---
Get 75 range for blowpipe and you good if you want to make Jad easier.
---
Petition to change that. Jk
---
108 games for me
---
World 102 checking in!!!!!
---
Our corrupted kc size is much smaller we only have about 120 done where our reg kc is 700 odd but we believe it is better loot in general, like same loot items but higher quantity coins arrows etc and a better chance at hitting the unique table at around 1/35 but with only 120 done the numbers could be way off
---
There are west and east coast servers, they just have the same icon

About to get off but I'd be able to take you along tonight or some other time. Just drop me a message on here if you're still looking later and I'll respond when I'm on.

I don‚Äôt understand why people choose to make YouTube a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù it‚Äôs EXTREMELY evident that the platform is awfully unstable.

Sweet

I picked up 150k fire runes on my grind to 87 slayer. I‚Äôm now 91 slayer and have to buy them as I‚Äôve run out, and I still always pick them up
---
Hahahahahahahahahah
---
I‚Äôm level 62 agility and like most people, I‚Äôm hating the grind.
---
What‚Äôs my fastest way to clear these next few levels off? Already doing some diaries for the lamps haha
---
Can someone please explain all of this to me? Who is modmatk (saw a few posts lately) and Emily? Why is this funny? Started this year
---
YT as a whole. Fuck the creators. Lets dump all our bullshit to big news media and turn this shit ass platform to a TV station.
---
Can somebody explain to me why he's getting paid so little?
---
Facts, the best thing to do with your big YouTube channel is use it to advertise, ironically, for your twitch or something else
---
R I P  should go to the Plane of Death should such content ever be implemented.
---
Its really about who makes more content to contribute to the youtubde algo
---
Eventualy yes
---
I‚Äôd say start streaming, whilst also posting your videos on twitch, but only allowing them for subs to watch 
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. I‚Äôd pay for quality, hence why I pay for HBO.
---
Yeye cry me a river and enjoy making videos to 20 ppl.  I mean thats your average viewcount. "You havent even got famous yet" like im trying lmao. Still i have almost same amount of karma even tho your acc is way older. Affliate on twitch? Are you fucking kidding me?
---
Because things like Jad on task have a better chance to drop a pet 1/100 than chaos elemental (1/300) but doing only chaos elemental you would get the pet a lot faster than doing only Jad tasks. You can't evaluate everything on droprate.
---
cool cheers :)
---
Thanks and yeah, I like to kill stuff just to sell the drops.
---
It gives a feeling of accomplishment and makes killing seem less as a grind like most games do.
---
Only difficult to prioritize which combat skills I'll level and at what level I should start other ones.
---
For now I think I'm going 30 ranged and magic and after that 30 atk and ste through waterfall quest.
---
After that it'll be searching as to when to level which skill because I'm already so used to only train one class at a time and now I've got 3 lol.
---
Did you watch the video? My man did it right there.
---
They didn't change that much that would result in more profit. This post is an example. They get a cut from the revenue the creators create, and if that is small, YouTubes cut is also small. And for every clickbaity trendy video that does well there are probably tens of thousands that don't do well, thousands that aren't even monetized, a lot of content overall that doesn't really make a profit for them but costs a lot to host anyway.
---
Its not my post thats sitting at negative karma when trying sadly to selfpromote while encouragin botting. Jesus you are dense.
---
Would be great if the trees before this part could be toggled off too. Sucks trying to navigate around it on Mobile and spoils what is otherwise a nice course.
---
I think botting to a certain degree is beneficial for the game. Could you imagine what would happen to the prices of items if bot did not exist? The prices of all resources would be volatile as all hell. The merchers would buy up the stock and tax the living shit out of legit players. You would always be paying a premium to skill, and probably waiting to do so.
---
The revenue Jagex makes from botters far exceeds the amount of money they spend trying to catch bots. I've ran 100-125 p2p bot farms before this memb exploit. Someone is buying those bonds and selling them to me on the GE right? If we assume i receive 0 bans over 14 days Jagex still pockets $6.99 * 125 = 873.75 per 14 days. Jagex is Taxing the living shit out of people who want to bot via bonds rn.
---
Jesus Christ. What a terrible company. They bog your video with more ads and you get less than ever. No wonder everyone streams on twitch now instead of making YouTube content.
---
Thats your graphics
---
&gt; They say flipping requires patience, is this why?
---
Yes. 
---
Everything you mentioned is determined pretty much on a case-by-case basis, depends what item it is and what the trend is with other items/overall etc.
---
Hot Take: They should add heraldic surcoats that you can wear in the necklace slot.
---
I know Shroud is a long time RuneScape player and has played it consistently on his second monitor while he streams other games. He apparently streamed it a few months ago, if they could convince him to stream more regularly, they'd have it made.

Don‚Äôt they just have the power to mute players? Banning on the spot seems incredibly abusable
---
Must've been cleaned from the duel arena
---
or maybe youtube should just start paying more... last time I checked they had obscene ammounts of profits, thx to content creators
---
Then how do you get runes on one?
---
Nah its put in a chest outside and you buy it back for like 100k or something
---
My memory is reall blurry. Just talking about point and click heal, shield and stun. and ulti that big smash. AP Taric was awesome back then. fucking love it.
---
Maor666as (or maor666aa, cant zoom in on phone) it's in the first trade window op forgot to blur it out
---
I just buy them from the varrock rune store. For chaos and mind runes. Later in the game I think you can kill the barrows brothers and get quite a bit as well
---
I started jad in the lvl 70s with 60 def/ 65 hp/44 pray/70 range. Tbh got to jad 3x after my first attempt and almost had him every time but made silly errors on my part i was 73 range at that point and just trained for an hour or 2 and got 75 then did it first try with bp. 
---
Cbow is extremely slow compared to bp. If ya gotta sell whip for it id still do it - it makes life incredibly easy there. Your stats are more than fine though, use verac skirt/helm/blessed body/boots (or pegs)/anguish/archer ring (I) and b gloves. That'll stomp it with bp. And with 70 def its way easier as you take barely any damage.
---
How do you know what to do? Eg. Unfinished potions have dropped by about 50-100gp per item from what I was expecting them to sell for, is it unrealistic to see this come back up?
---
No. New. Skills. yall already got your ass clapped with Warding. it's never going to happen, stop being stupid
---
no they don't it just depends on your body type.
---
Yeah no kidding, went to his stream last night and he was literally killing kalphites for a couple hours without a cannon in the shitty pre-GWD he was allowed.
---
Still had a few thousand viewers because he's an interesting streamer.

I am 6'3 but besides girls liking it i dont see any benefits actually. So much back pain when im cooking because the counter is made for 5'6 people for example.

SettledRS, you should put a plea at the beginning of your vids for people to click on ads, so  you can eat, mate.
---
How? For me it doesn't even show up. When I check via PC it shows as not compatible with my Chromebook.
---
Wait they really did change it what the hell, i voted option a thinking it was the old chat head
---
I‚Äôm low level and also f2p but I made around 40k from mining and smelting iron in 2 hours, mine till you get around 1000 iron, buy some rings of forging off of the GE and smelt then sell back on the GE, hope this helps :)
---
Still a big savings. I hope it becomes what YouTube used to be
---
I don‚Äôt think that is true regarding companies, many strive to provide the best quality service or product and profit and market gain is a product of that. A lot of ventures start with quality in mind and fall at the wayside when profit gain and external influences to ‚Äúmaximise profit‚Äù.
---
Not everybody in the market plays that game.
---
your point being?
---
I actually had Morgz in mind when I wrote that rant. I know MrBeast is genuine enough

Idk, but he called them a nerd. Usually in the context like that, someone would mean you play too much.

Lmao

Ah my mistake, isn‚Äôt he the one who always copies MrBeast?
---
Stick with 1 prayer for now. Enjoy f2p pking after you get a few more str levels. When you get bored of f2p, get 50 attack for p2p pking.
---
Tbh, 1 or 13 prayer when p2p pking isn't a big difference. Pkers just like to min/max everything.
---
30.4m no pet checking in
---
It actually feels decent now. I get a ton of enchanted items and books. It used to be trash but it feels buffed now.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought until I said in his stream chat I‚Äôm here for chestbrah and then they were like.. he‚Äôs playing another game hold up I‚Äôll see if he‚Äôs in disc. Turns out he‚Äôs one of their boys and chill a f

To be fair, it doesn't have any defensive bonuses

Yea if anything id say the opposite of what he described is true.

What‚Äôs some good early Game advice? Just got the game yesterday and haven‚Äôt played in 10 years probably
---
Give me rune legs and ill trim them for you
---
In addition, 80 smithing is recommended
---
300 hours of work, REALLY?? 300 FUCKING HOURS OF WORK? or thats how it feels for u ?
---
if u had a regular 9-5 job u would get paid more with less hours...
---
Which tier armour are u using? I usually do tier 2 armour and tier 3 melee&amp;range weapons, if u get prayers correct damage is halved
---
He motivated people to train their combat stats to prevent being attacked. A well-needed flame torch.
---
cut teaks instead
---
Bro I‚Äôm just trying to mine.
---
I spent a day where I just killed that cunt when I got back into osrs.
---
Extra clarification.
---
consider 1shard = 25k gp if you're 97 herblore
---
For every 10th, 50th, 100th, 250th and 1000th task you get multiple points.
---
5x points every 10th task
---
15x points every 50th task
---
25x points every 100th task
---
35x points every 250th task
---
50x points every 1,000th task
---
So if you're using Chaeldar, which gives 10 points per task, and you completed your 10th task in a row (10, 20, 30, etc.) you'd get 5x10 points, 50 points in total.
---
If you'd complete your 50th task you should get 150 points.
---
Nah, that would be insane. I'm on a 740 point streak. I'd be getting 630 points per task from Konar.
---
Voted :) how many people have filled the survey atm?
---
shit man I didn't think of that

No buff for crystal armor so now it's singular use is cosmetic. Oof
---
The client is 100% open source, from the client itself, to the website, to the launcher. They can all be found on the runelite-extended GitHub repo.
---
We also have players who have 5b+ banks using the client (we know this due to them showing their pvming activity via discord).
---
Some people claimed we hacked them, yet they provide us with 0 evidence when asked for it. They are either fake accounts trying to tarnish RuneLitePlus because they are from another 4th party client, or because they are scare mongering. We have never hacked anyone, and never will. Period. We can‚Äôt just ‚Äúsneak code into an update‚Äù. Each developer who requests to add code has To be approved by another developer, they cannot just sneak it in without no one knowing. If someone was found trying to do this, they would loose all access to the repo and would be removed from their role.

Glad to see option C won.

Or you know, there is an actual reason why they are doing it like that...

There's a damage threshold needed to get any drop at all, I assume you just need to qualify for at least a minor drop to have a shot at pet.

How far are you from spirit tree. And how expensive is the wildy obelisk? Im more likely to use the ancient teleports for going into wildy since most clue steps are near the teleports
---
Fuck that garbage
---
We also have players who have 5b+ banks using the client (we know this due to them showing their pvming activity via discord), we have also had streamers and youtubers use the client, Some even notably within deadman and got a top 50 placement.
---
we have had a few reported bans...
---
1 person claimed they used RuneLitePlus and the zulrah plugin, and got banned.
---
Further up in the discord they were bragging about their zulrah botfarm and how they botted 4000 kills over the past week.
---
Another claimed blackjacking got him banned, he got banned for real world trading...
---
Another got banned for 1 click agility, he was
---
botting it with an AHK script.
---
Should you not break the rules by botting, or real world trading, you will not encounter a ban.
---
If you do have any questions, or queries please speak to people who actually use the client, not from a user on here who‚Äôs formed an opinion because they heard a rumour from their uncle because their uncles friends son knows a boy at school, who spoke to someone else at another school who botted 2 days of agility and got banned for it and blamed RuneLitePlus.
---
Peak male performance here
---
Coincidentally, just wait 10 minutes for the update and watch as all these people flood the RuneLite discord crying over how they can't play the game because RuneLite is down. Yet take any chance they can get to cry and attack RL+ because 'ruining game integrity'.
---
Game integrity was lost a long time ago.
---
From a dev point of view, why would we be logged out early, as opposed to other updates?
---
You is right lol
---
I kind of agree with your last sentence.
---
Considering no one on reddit can tick manipulate I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd use the word elitist. Most of the accomplishments I see on here are 77 rc lmao.
---
UNPLAYABLE.
---
There's already a threshold to get loot.
---
I disagree with almost all of your points. Stay in singles. You have no idea how fun it is to have an actual war with other clans. I bet you joined lil cards or one of those other cancer open ccs. 
---
The only thing i do strongly agree with is singles clans running around with 10+ and one dude in max gear.
---
\&gt; Non-sweatyboys no longer get shafted at Zulcano
---
Lets fucking go boys! 
---
Big question though: Is my non-sweaty reward based on how far behind the  MVP I am, or based on the total amount of damage done?
---
In other words, is it better to play in a large group of players that don't tick manipulate (so e.g. the MVP does 50 damage, I do 30), or is it better to be in a smaller group where I do more damage but the distance to the MVP is greater (MVP does 200 damage, I do 70)?
---
Same i was actually so surprised because i generally have a disdain for youtube as of late hahaha
---
I really wanna comment to explain all this and correct the guy. But I can't be bothered to explain all that in the novel I'd have to write to explain it all.
---
Meanwhile I did 19k shamans and de-ironed cuz it was getting rly rly too disgusting . 
---
Gratz man
---
&gt;Community will just end up voting no for all of it.
---
Do they need to poll client changes? Nothing runelite or OSB does it polled
---
Because then they have to balance around it.
---
you clearly need help
---
So.. I should just guess exactly when my antifire potion is going to expire? I should go to the wiki and look up high alch values as well?
---
Whats to understand about a group of 15 trogdolites in salad robes screaming racial slurs at you?
---
No, seriously I am missing the fact that says that the total drop will not change from zalcano.
---
I am reading the newspost as it suggests that doing it with 100s is better since everyone gets a drop regardless of the amount of people.
---
Please consider keeping 1.5t for the long term health of the content above anything else. If you don't have at least 4 players you can't fight the boss efficiently without tick manipulation. It's a fun and unique mechanic that makes the boss far more interactive and rewarding. I don't see why rewards aren't solely based on a personal "point" value like Wintertodt really.
---
That's normal. The only alternative was to force people to log into their Google account to restrict votes, and that would have drastically reduced the amount of responses. Hopefully people have some integrity and vote only once.
---
Later today. :)
---
Where else should discussion occur? Honest question. Twitter doesn't work since stuff is too short and there are too many toxic people, the osrs forums are dead, so where else? At least on reddit *really* good suggestions normally get attention and a decent amount of real feedback, and sometimes jmods even reply.
---
Mobile is always going to be a second-class experience, why should (what is effectively) boss mechanics be removed to put everyone on an even playing field? 
---
By the same logic, all 3-ticking methods should be removed because they're "locking" mobile users out of achieving the best xp rates
---
I just dislike unfair fights that are like 1 v 20 (clans in multi)
---
Groot would like a word...
---
That I'm not quite sure on. It would depend on if prayer makes hits act as an always 0 hit or always 0 miss.
---
Imagine trying to shit on someone for *only* having 200 hours in a game. I get for osrs it's not a ton but that's significant regardless.
---
It killed my ironman
---
If you say so. In the end, I didn't 'change' anything since I worked on this idea in early 2017, a year and a half before PoF came out.
---
As I want the gmaul nerf asap. I have to agree. If it‚Äôs going to be worth 5m it shouldn‚Äôt drop for 1m.
---
If they leave it in and loot potential is based off damage done then they have to balance entirely based on 1.5ticking. not a good precedent imo. They need to rework the entire boss damage being the loot determination of ticking was to stay.
---
Unless you know the person there is little to no need in trading a random person
---
It's the 1/07 and zulcano already meme of the month

How is it a valueless player base when rs twitch is literally the most generous out of ANY game?
---
I mean, there area also a lot of 1750+/2k+ total players and some 2.2k+ ones as well. I don't know if anyone has actual data on demographics of the reddit participant though.
---
how can that possibly even happen lol? no offense..
---
Prayer flicking has to do with combat. How does making a paste and then stopping kid animation have anything to do with mining.
---
The good ol' days.
---
No wonder shitty, low hanging content is the MO of YouTube by and large, it's the only way to get a decent amount of money. Google fucked the platform nice and good.
---
They could at least buff the defense stats to that of black d'hide, so it's basically the same with a better prayer bonus.

Surely the 'risk' is irrelevant over a large enough sample size. Snaps are ~30% more profit on average over avantoe (not taking into account Catherby/Hosidius)

---
I've been playing since beta, I "quit" about two years ago but every couple of months I'll play for a few days only to quit again. The community has sucked every drop of joy out of this game, everyone is so elitist and try hard (I haven't played ranked since the first time I quit so it's not even that) that it ruins the game. That and one person going afk basically wastes 30 - 45 minutes of your time. why bother playing a game that simply isn't fun. Yeah sure it's great when you're winning but 3/4 of the time there's some idiot either on your team or the other team constantly complaining or flaming or both and it just makes it a shit experience
---
That's what I love about osrs you can feel the human error in everything they make
---
Clicking on a prayer icon once every .6 seconds has no more or less to do with combat than manipulating ticks with a pestle and mortar.
---
this, im still not sure if getting shards is considerd the lower drop table because it gives you less items on top of shards.

No need to be a genius to know that rwt is ruining the game...

---
Its not even that. When Jagex was offering mobile they PROMISED it wouldn't affect the main game whatsoever, including compromising the main game experience to make mobile more accessible. That's already been broken, for what its worth, but the principle still stands that the game should never be designed around a less intuitive platform.
---
I'll vote no to any change until they make a new skill.
---
it‚Äôs the first thing listed in the link my guy
---
I think there was a few frames in one episode where Spongebob reaches into his underwear and pulls out an item (he usually does this with his clothes on), and then that face was edited onto that.  Also that scene of Mr. Krabs wasn't on Spongebob's TV.

What is jerma doing on the left there?

Dont forget to change your shit/piss bucket every few days.

Which is a valid sentiment, but has far more to do with the way Zalcano's loot worked and the way MVP worked than 1.5. The sentiment I'm describing has been around since way before Zalcano.

haha yeah EUW released and was like OMG this is a dream but couldnt account transfer for over a year lmao

Thank you! I have yet to go there

Youre the one claiming to be too busy cuz you cant make money at the game ... i just tell you that you can easily do some rly quick id even be willing to give you tips , dont feel upset about that :p
---
It it was an arbitrary number and yes I'd expect jagex to put up reasonably logic explaining the cutoff  but I don't expect it to happen
---
Also as I said I'd think the longevity of the game is more important then being inclusive of players giving their opinion when it contributes nothing, myself included at 2k total I dont feel like my opinion on raids matters much when I've never even set foot ether

I guess we just need to try it out and see if it improved anything besides pet chance. Tho thats all i really care about... Never had MVP after first day so never got a chance for the pet... All i really want is that cool looking pet and one tool seed...

You just further explained how the system is fucked.
---
I‚Äôve never heard the oar story, but I have read in several places that one of his favorite tactics was to show up late to mentally fuck with his opponent. They would be so mad that it would give him the advantage. Very interesting character

You're right, they won't change that's why Youtube is fucked.

Anybody else find it insane she has gotten away with blatantly view botting her streams for this long now?

It's degradable and crystals are work 20-25k per Crystal, so charging and recharging the set is extremely expensive for what's essentially Void(t)

From the one single picture I saw, there were five spawns right next to eachother. The spot was better than the spot named "Red Chin Hunting Ground", which requires a Hard diary.

How is that balanced compared to Vorkath, which is over twice as profitable for less effort

highest I've seen is 13 with t1 armor.
---
Then if that's the case all ezscape content added by jagex needs to go, no incinerator in the bank, no bank tabs or placeholders, no quest adjustments to make it easier; stock 2007 client then. See how well that'll last, we both know it wouldn't.  There's a reason why runelite and other clients exist, the game client is outdated as hell and needs QoL improvements to make it palatable to newer players and returning players.
---
Those forums were pretty clunky compared to what social media is today though, serious question: have they updated the forums and changed their layout in the past decade?
---
The way I remember it was *very* 2000's-esque and I feel like I just went on there a few months ago briefly and it felt the same.
---
But of all things to change they pick a dialogue tree?  The polled changes were for shortcuts after you already finished the quest not something like this.  Short cuts after finishing areas already exist in lots of other quest so it was a more reasonable suggestion then just straight removing a dialogue option.  I also don't agree with this conspiracy that it was some attempt to sneak them in its just stupid.
---

---
You think Jagex makes money off bot farms because of bonds? You know they make way more money off regular players who purchase bonds, bot farms are just a little percentage of it. But bots still change the game in many ways, some positive, but mostly negative due to the core idea and integrity if the game shifting away because of greedy people like you. It is true Jagex could do more about the botting problem but it us hard to be 100% certain that someone is a bot with a point-and-click game.
---
? Reddit is elitist most of the time
---
Im not a Youtube contributor but like everyone else i use it very nearly on a daily basis.  I wanted to preface my question with that statement to give it a clearer context.  Does the demonetization of some content providers and the reduction of income per video of others seem like a repeat of the dot com balloon popping?  Im all for people making money and those who capitalized early on in the youtube payouts werent lucky, they were on the ball and had a mind for making money.  It just seems to me that this is in a way just another market correction, the only serious difference is that the market is controlled by one entity and thats not their fault.  Hopefully this gives rise to a rival for youtube.  If that were to happen, i think the fact that they all of a sudden arent the only show in town would lead to a return in the higher payouts in order to keep the popular content providers.  Thoughts?
---
Which one are u?
---
The red chin spot was capable of getting 240k+ exp an hour which is honestly ridiculous for red chins, and really cut down the usefulness of black chins. All chin spots should be the same exp, but ones behind requirements have the benefit of less people there. Elf one is still useful for people who want to hunt red chins in peace, but not a complete meta changer like it was temporarily.

The Winterthot only gives a supply crate (and bonus exp) if you get 500 points. More points = better chance for an extra drop.

Remember how fucking hated autumn elegy was a few years ago when he said he didn't want the game to be easier lmao

i have 200m in this skill so i dont care how you fucking market the skill

I DO NOT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK

There are more casual players than hardcore players. Not sure what you are trying to prove. Not like the real polls take place in reddit. And twitter is all Kpop profile pic maxed players who vote no on anything that might make things easier for newer players that won't even effect them. It's not even mid level content changes they vote no on, it could be something that helps players in lumbridge and they will vote no.
---
Yeah, according to one of the old RS novels it took days to walk to Taverly from Falador on foot, so with that logic Ardougne to Varrock would take a very long time.
---
You're right, they won't change and Youtube won't be a staple forever because of it. There's no better options that exist right now but there will be in the future and after enough people have been fucked over by Youtube, the creators may all collectively decide to move somewhere better.

---
&gt;Don't let this sway your vote for future quests, as they are completely unrelated to this.
---
Actions speak louder than words. You cant poison the well and expect no impact. From Jagex's ACTIONS during this release we can expect any new release to contain massive graphical overhauls, and unannounced nerfs to existing quests. 
---
This HAS to be considered by the playerbase every time we vote on a new quest going forward.
---
How long did the kills take you ?
---
W118 was my home back then...
---
were the results from the google poll that the reddit mods did for warding ever posted?
---
It absolutely isn't. Gem mining is 1m gp per hour + 89k xp per hour 4t. Its like 600k gp per hour and 50k xp per hour without 4t. Why would I ever do Zalcano at 1m per hour now when I can do that?
---
I could also do
---
One hour of iron powermining and one hour of vorkath for 80k mining xp and 3m gp
---
Or one hour of volcanic mine and one hour of vorkath for 100k mining xp and 3m gp
---
Or Blast mine for 70k xp per hour and 700k gp per hour
---
Zalcano gives almost no xp per hour. It is dogshit compared to any other use of the mining skill in the game at this point.
---
It's not an issue that I have personally. It's a general issue that there are those people that are keyboard warrioring profanities for the sake of doing it to anyone and everyone they can. There's no reason for it. Kill whoever's for the 5k you want and move on. You don't need 10 pre-typed vulgar messages to harass someone when you dogpile the guy with nothing.
---
This is not correct. Nobody VOTED on removing 1.5t mechanics at zalcano.

Given that 11% voted for the worst one, we can conclude with absolute certainty that this kind of vote manipulation did _not_ happn.

[Context](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c90fed/evscape_gets_called_out_for_his_misinformative/)
---
TL;DR: 
---
- EVScape makes a video on how to GUARANTEE personal ToB drops. 
---
- A high level PvMer tells him this is wrong and doesnt actually increase the rate at which you get drops, all it accomplishes is taking away drops from your teammates
---
- EVScape goes on a 2 week long rant against all high level players
---
When did I mention PvP?
---
200 hours in runescape is barely anything though. When i first started playing after 200 hours i was probably like level 60 cause i had no idea what i was doing
---
I feel you. I took a few month break before sote, just did that last night. The atmosphere around Twitter and this sub felt like it changed in that time. Although I see more of what you said in Twitter it sucks to see it at all.
---
The worst thing is, games with a small player base that can't get abs retain new players wind up needing MTX to survive after awhile. So yeah, if people try to drive away new players they're inadvertently inviting MTX.
---
Also runescape is fun. It's got a quirky charm and great writing. Yeah it's dated but so what? I'd like as many people to experience it as possible, if they're willing.
---
Should be 5'11 vs 6' not 6'1
---
Omg just got d warhammer
---
Then he types out "Is what I would say if I got a d warhammer" as he finishes the kill
---
Then keyboard spam
---
Can‚Äôt speak on that one I didn‚Äôt think that it was exclusively for mobile either
---
I don't care what you do with your life.

How about adding warding AND sailing in without a poll now? Fuck the no voters let's get this bread

I say good for that last part.

I never knew the wiki had this awesome calculator. Thank you
---
So if I kill two bears, what does the second bear drop?  A different t3? Or regular loot?
---
Don't hate the game or the player, the one that's changing is you.
---
Youd expect more from a golden gnome nominee wouldnt you, lol
---
&gt;they want to have the feeling that they‚Äôre actively working on the game
---
Even if they don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre voting on, contribute further to the decline of the game by pushing bad updates and then leave when they get bored leaving the long-term players to deal with the shit they voted in? Not referring to any specific updates but in general imo a 300 total player shouldn‚Äôt be allowed anywhere near a poll concerning endgame boss drop tables or similar
---
There is a reason that bot clients exist too. The same logic applies there as well. 
---
Like I said, its not our fault you need a crutch. If it were removed, youd learn to play the game yourself.
---
? You really don't understand. Any 4 tick thing (normal logs into arrow shafts/bows etc) can be used to 2 tick. 2 Ticking is still 33% better than afking.

Repeating yourself how much you dont care only shows that you do care a lot lol

There is singles no to far from these, a clue box will save your clues + reward if you didnt open it but dont understand why you arent instanting running to the obalisk or heading south in singles the second you see a dot if you dont want the fight.

Also still doubt youre running into clans often enough for it to be a valid complaint unless its revs since revs is the only populated area besides lava maze teleport these days.

‚ÄúAccording to the legend, Miyamoto arrived more than three hours late, and goaded Sasaki by taunting him. When Sasaki attacked, his blow came so close as to sever Miyamoto's chonmage. He came close to victory several times until, supposedly, he was blinded by the sunset behind Miyamoto, who struck him on the skull with his oversized bokken, or wooden sword, which was 110 centimeters long. Miyamoto had supposedly fashioned the long bokken, a type called a suburit≈ç due to its above-average length, by shaving down the spare oar of the boat in which he arrived at the duel with his wakizashi. Miyamoto had been late for the duel on purpose in order to psychologically unnerve his opponent, a tactic he used on previous occasions, such as during his series of duels with the Yoshioka swordsmen.‚Äù

This one might get weird, people with alts would just have them fight each other in the wild to check off kill count boxes and get a say without actually having to participate in real PVP
---
In my experience it drops no upgrade, just shards
---
exactly!
---
If you're 2 tiles away from a box you generally want to click under it, then pick it up, then 3 tick set it, but starting the herb-tar animation and then walking/setting should be the same amount of ticks anyway, just a bit more click intensive. It's worth bringing a magic shortbow and shooting far away chins to force respawns too. Finally you can also do some aching or magic imbuing if you want, but that's just for the passive magic exp.

Say a boss has 1/1,000 chance. When you hit 1k you now have a 2/1,000 chance. Doubled the rate woo! When you get to 2k it increases to 3/1,000. So 1/333.3, not doubled. 3k kc is 4/1,000 and so on till you hit a cap which I believe is 10 so by 10k kc you have a 10/1,000 or 1/100 chance.
---
Example of different thresholds:
---
Dks pets are 1/2,500 with a threshold of 1,500.
---
Gwd bosses like Kree'arra are 1/5,000 thresh of 1,000
---
Rax 1/500 thresh of 200
---
Telos 1/1,400 thresh of 300
---
Tick manipulation was ruining the zalcano for everyone that didn't do it.
---
You talk like you are a child
---
Why does everyone screenshot ash‚Äôs responses looking for karma
---
It does auto update. Just restart the client.
---
Maybe if you turn the monitor upside down, squint your eyes, close your eyes and turn off the monitor it's kind of like Verac's? And even then only like 4%.
---
Here's your logic. Goes into MULTI combat zone gets UPSET when a team kill him I'm so illogical. I pray to god you're trolling plzzzzzzzzzzz
---
"This guy's 'nostalgai' would be ruined. No change."  
---
\~Jagex probably.
---
Looooong streak of jizz...
---
Don't do it in masses. It's literally dividing your kill participation 15-20 ways no shit your loot is god awful. Are you braindead
---
You joke, but... /u/HiMyFishIsRemy/
---
Thankyou, so I won't cram with 3-4k Deaths and Bloods for barrage then lol!
---
Oh I gotcha.
---
So i've been doing the quest and i wanted to solve the big light puzzle myself. One of the biggest problems is just how massive the place is and the books blocking the way (which dont show on maps). Any map i tried to look up either didnt have the blockages or just showed the answers so i took the day out to make this blank map for everyone
---
Basically its a map with no solutions for people to use to plan out their solutions for themselves. It shows where all the pillars are, which ways they can face, fixed crystals, where all the seals are, colour coordinated teleports and most importantly where all the book blockages are
---
100 logs an hour. is that really how long chopping magics takes?
---
And here I am lagging to basically shit frames when I go to fossil island or Prif Library.
---
I feel like once you hit 4x the drop rate you should be guaranteed the pet. This kind of bad luck is ridiculous.
---
id prefer them to tidy up the game a bit before trying to poll another skill. But if a good one comes along Im keen
---
So basically everyone hated the new one?
---
Yo honestly have you ever pk'd a spade because I haven't X'D
---
Any beavers yet?
---
Probably did this with every kill
---
In what way is it 'so fucking bad'? 
---
Just because other software provides you additional functionality does not mean such features should be implemented in the default launcher. In my opinion, the vanilla client should perfectly allow you to _play the game_, and that's it. Want to auto-type? Use 3rd-party software. Want a stopwatch so you can time certain activities? Look one up online. Want to keep notes of quest requirements? Grab a piece of paper and write it down. It is not the job of the client to augment your RS experience with things external to the game itself.
---
OSRS houses thousands of elitists, 'nuff said. A lot of the population is chill, but a lot is also made up of assholes.
---
Over 75% of people voted for it to be changed, and of those voters most of them chose option C what difference does it make?
---
obviously a bot farm
---
It'll be pretty obvious once the hitsplat changes go in.
---
34% of people voted for it to stay the same it was before the update?
---
I do remember stop meaning they'd stop in the middle of a quest.  I'm not sure if they mentioned if those players would go on to quit or not
---
/r/egg_irl
---
Jagex could also potentially have a problem with that.
---
Yes I agree entirely, I don't like the reward system. I mostly mean the feeling and general effort of doing it.
---
I actually made my first rs friend by protecting someone from that scorpion while they were training their mining
---
They should just be merged into one client that has all the legal functionality they want. Then they can ban the illegal clients that take stuff to far.
---
Ooh, let's math.
---
Assuming your friend doesn't care which pet he gets (that's right lil' Rex, we love you too) the odds of getting a pet is 1 in 5000 per kill.  Since this isn't a game of Russian Roulette and the system has no memory, we can calculate the odds of getting any pet with the formula of 1-(4999/5000)^X, with X equalling the number of kills.
---
1-(4999/5000)^33820=.998846 and then the number just sort of goes on for a bit.
---
So let your buddy know that someone setting out to kill over 33 thousand DKs would have a 99.9% chance of getting at least a single pet.
---
Always C
---
I was speaking specifically to the bare-chested, bulky shoulder armor look, but I like your take, too. Hell, even the helmet is *sorta* similar if you squint your eyes hard enough. :)
---
and that is exactly why the game is going downhill for older players. jagex is very good at marketing towards a more casual audience. easy money babyyyy
---

No way is Zalcno only 1m/hr, it was over 1.5m/hr before without tick manipulation and should be relatively unchanged.
---
Would love to see an ultra rare drop added to the spider to go alongside the other bosses.  
---
Jar of Sriracha. Could be used in cooking too.
---
Sorry but you're not even close to being dry yet. 
---
Assuming you killed each of the kings, that's about 10k kill of each. 
---
The drop rate of a pet is 1 in 5k. That's BARELY over 2x the drop rate. 
---
I have to keep reminding everyone, **you're not dry unless you're at 10x the drop rate or higher.** 
---
The takeaway is: tell your friend to STOP WHINING.
---
Is there a way to report the ads as having been watched but still having them blocked?
---
Exactly! :D
---
Killing a bear when you already have a spike gives you bowstring/orb instead which helps significantly. Not sure if it was like that on release, but I only noticed it today.

Let's be clear, ~240k xp/hr is the number Thurco gave for tick manipulating the chins and also shooting stray chins with an alt. Just 3t tick manipulting them I've gotten ~140k xp/hr.

And before anyone proclaims he's spending time providing free content to watch, yeah and so what?
---
If he's complaining about revenue, this is no longer a small hobby project for him. I've never understood the pull of watching people play the same video game you already play.
---
It was not relatively unchanged. The entire way it distributes loot is change. The average loot is roughly 40k per kill now. That's only 2x the poor loot table from before and its pretty much impossible to get over 150k on a single kill now. Multiple people have done an hour and its right around 1m.
---

I recommend starting in f2p with a low leveled account, something like 20 attack, 43 strength, 42 range, or lower. That way you can risk next to nothing while you get a feel for fighting other people and you can work on timing when to switch to your 2h.     
---
Later on when you feel like you're ready to move to p2p, that same account can be easily transitioned into a 50 or 60 attack account (normally I'd recommend 50 but if the gmaul nerf hits before you're ready, 60 is going to be the better option).   
---
Overall, just don't get discouraged if you run into bullshit rng or cocky people. If you die to something 50 times, maybe by the 51st time you'll have figured out how to deal with it; then you'll die to something else 50 times and the cycle will repeat, but you'll be better than when you started. Best way to learn imo.
---
Lol stfu get a first dk kill then talk

Of course it is, you can't see a joke when its sat on your face and you're flaming OP for making content that is apparently far beyond your understanding.
---
No offence but the numbers that randomers can get is not really what things like this should be discussed around. Thurco can't get close to 240k at the other red chin spots, so its significantly better. We can't balance the game around people who don't know how to optimize things.
---
Fair enough. Can definitely agree on some of those points.

To avoid this risk they‚Äôd have to outright hire the team that works on those clients or pay them to close the source code and from that point only Jagex maintains that code.

Openly advertising a 3rd party solution outside of their scope is a huge risk.

Go is getting pretty big now, I've seen it on a ton of job postings recently. It's carved out a pretty good niche where you want performance close to C/C++ but want faster development at the cost of memory usage, binary size, and GC.

what is the 77 meme about?  i keep seeing it but as far as i can gather, runecrafting itself doesn't change after that level, so what makes it better?

If it‚Äôs based on contribution wouldn‚Äôt 1.5ting still stop players from getting loot? They have twice the orbs and double the damage during mining phase, effectively lowering the potential damage others can do who aren‚Äôt tick manipulating. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, this is just how I understand it.

The idea is that right now if we flipped a coin 3 times (or 100 times), the outcome is more likely to be farther from 50/50 (the theoretical odds/predicted outcome) than if we flipped a coin 1000 times. Basically, the more events that occur the closer your outcome should be to the predicted outcome/theoretical odds.
---
This doesnt apply when things have already happened because we already know the outcome of those roles  - if I've already gotten 5 heads in a row, the 6th flip is still 50/50, which means the outcomes of 5-1 and 6-0 are equally likely
---
Because if you want something you should grind for it.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand. 
---
They didn‚Äôt change the chathead because of Reddit.
---
They polled it - just like you wanted, because there was an obvious uproar.

I would like to know how much black marks (Or old offences in general) affect your chances of getting pmod. I remember back in the day people said even 0.1 black marks would stop you from getting pmod status, but the game was pretty new back then so there really wasn't anything like "old offences". Like for an example, my latest offence is from over 10 years ago, would that affect my chances of getting mod?
---
Can you compare all torv videos vs all settled videos, in the last month?
---
Of course I read you're comment, I read all of it. How do you think I stumbled this far down the rabbit hole to this point?

And people have gotten the XP rate. 240k is in the above comment from /u/Yew-Ess-Bee. That number wasn't pulled out of Jagex HQ.
---
&gt; There's like 2 sports for short people

I disagree with this, everything else is true though. I'm quite small (1,72m or 5'8 feet) but there is so much sport you can be good at. Also, I like to compensate my height with building muscle. People joke about compensation but it is true, it does make you feel better.
---
Nope. 1 in 5k doesn't mean that you "should" get a drop after 5k KC. You can read about it here https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bdia29/quantifying_dryness/

Ok, but the notification that shows in chat is set with GE values not HA values.
---
Sure, if thats how its calculated, but that also is exactly the same for having additional players there. If, hypothetically, a tick manipulator could deal double the damage of another person, it's just like he brought along a friend and they are both dealing the normal level of damage. More loot for him, exactly the same loot for the guy.
---
C without a doubt in my mind.
---
Not currently
---
Set goals like quests or achievement diaries. Elite diaries have high requirements
---
You're misunderstanding what it is.
---
From the wiki:
---
"According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed."
---
Say we play a game. Everytime we flip a coin if it lands on heads you get $1, if it lands on tails you lose 90c.
---
Every time we flip the coin, your expected value is 10c ($1.00 - 90c). In other words, you expect to win 10c every time you flip the coin. So if you flip it 100 times you expect to win $10 and you will if you get heads and tails equally. 
---
All the law describes is over a large sample size, the average return of all your flips will trend towards the expected value (10c).
---
This is me in the clip, my brother uploaded it. Got it on [KC 58](https://imgur.com/a/RYr2vXG), was just doing a slayer task never expecting to get anything lol
---
This is wrong. Zalcano can't double dutch like Sal can.
---
I don‚Äôt like that, kills should have independent drops from each other. Kinda a big thing in fair statistics and probability.
---
Is the pet at zalcano still mvp only?
---
You choose to limit yourself.
---
Well, everyone who confirmed me that (including the wiki) was, then. Sorry about that
---
Each event is independent. So if you flip a coin and it comes up heads 99 times, your next coin toss is still 50/50. No amount of coin flipping will change the probability of the next coin flip.
---
However if you are going to say flip a coin until it comes up tails you could calculate that would have an astronomically low chance of reaching 100 coin flips. That doesn't change the fact that every coin flip was independently 50/50.
---
Lol I see 80+ stacks in the 50s bracket all day. Ignorant fuck
---
I normally don't comment on reddit but I just had to after seeing this amazing skill. @Jagex plz take a look at this! This might be something worth putting the time in.
---
Does anyone have the 3 pictures comparison?
---
I'm in the camp that content that is more difficult or expects more from you should be more rewarding. Prif is fantastic at 75 and matches ardy at 90, but honestly, for being locked behind a tedious questline and then a grandmaster quest with a bunch of requirements, the rate is actually kind of underwhelming. If anything, it should surpass the ardy course by a decent margin, by like 10k xp rather than just a sliver at max efficiency. Thankfully the shards do make up for it in some way and are technically worth 2x a mark of grace. That can easily change, though.
---
Holy shit I needed this LOL
---
No one is forcing him to work like that and try to make a living this way. When you only make 1 video a month you're gonna have a hard time making a living off it.

No need for a penile bone in order to find a correlation. The size of ears and most other organs also correlates with body seize despite them not having bones. They attach to your skeleton and if your skeleton is bigger, attachments probably are bigger too.

I don't know what your point is?
---
You agree with 240k, which was my comment by the way. So you agree the new red chin rate is 240k, great. I said just because it's the rate doesn't mean people will actually get it, which is obvious. So what do you disagree with me on?

This concept is super exciting, better than warding or anything like that. I love the skill but it is definetly lacking.

Technically it doesn't have to be running away like OP had it, maybe you run around an arena style where you go from obstacle to obstacle across different platforms similar to the agility arena launching attacks at a boss in the middle
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
The fuck?
---
Obby shield allows me to afk for longer and has only 2 lower str bonus than defender and the bosses have 0 defence so it doesnt really matter too much. But yeah my setup is not perfect but it allows me to afk pretty effectively when i dont have time to play

It sounds more like he'd be of the opinion that the game shouldn't survive, vs the radical changes that have happened.

I see 80 stacks in any combat bracket you ignorant fuck
---
I don't believe it's as bad as everyone makes out, but there's definitely a few small quality of life features they can add.
---
I don't think people are asking for clue scroll helpers or anything like that, but adding timers that show when potion effects run out and perhaps ground indicators for rarer/expensive items isn't too much to ask, and plenty of other MMOs have similar features.
---
RL will always exist because Jagex will never add all of those features to the base client, but there's certainly some small QoL features they can add.

They're not that loud then, I've not seen a single person suggest bringing back the 2004-2006 ones. I've seen people requesting the old chat head in place of the new one. I've also seen a lot of support for a compromised version before Jagex announced this poll.
---
It's such a fun puzzle to do yourself. I wish people appeciated the time put into creating this massive puzzle. This map would've been so helpful without spoiling anything, if I hadn't already completed it. Thanks for this.
---
I fully agree prif being more click intensive should be more rewarding.. just feels weird for a lvl 75 course to surpass a lvl 90 course.. maybe prif should have 2 courses lol? Idk... It's just strange lvl req wise... It's like saying rune armor is better then barrows..
---
I don't know if you know this, but PKing has ALWAYS been an afterthought to the main game.  It's something to do with the stuff you earn from PVM.  Just because it's your main focus doesn't mean it's what the game is based around.

Lol have you ever played a multiplayer videogame in your life?

---
Pet thresholds shouldn't be there, but kq head is a requirement for diaries, and the 256 kc head can only be used for diaries. It's not a vanity item, and untradeable things that lock content away from the player shouldn't be even theoretically possible to never get. Same with vorkath head, it's a low drop chance but still it is theoretically possible to never get it as a random drop, so adding one threshold head is fine.
---
The point of the threshold is another story though, and lots can be said about that, but maybe not in this comment

---
No one really mentions that there is no gear or supply requirements or any risk other than lost time, so why should the rewards be just as good as other pvm activities?
---
I think it‚Äôs better with trash normal drops because the input required is nothing, where at vorkath the 100% drops are enough to sustain the supplies input required for each kill.
---
I was thinking more like "when you use the last charge of your Glory to teleport to Karamja"

Hey there! Sorry for closing it early. The survey managed to gather over 3,500 replies, which I felt is enough to publish results and insights from those results. In the end, this is very much just preliminary work: the goal is to create a roadmap to help Jagex with the design of a new skill.

Playing on the official client is like playing on Legacy mode on RS3. You can do it, but you won't be competitive in anything. Except in the case of OSRS, you need to trust a third party with your login details in order to get out of Legacy mode.

Having membership kinda takes away the motivation to do them, it did for me at least
---
I dunno, but I'm addicted.
---
Much higher, I‚Äôd go for it. Also it‚Äôs such fast levels even at that I‚Äôd go for 75. Wouldn‚Äôt be too much longer maybe an hour or two
---
Seeing the new one, feels like 90% of the issue is fucking anime eyes
---
I think it would be nice to have it removed from the Costume Room to prevent redundancy, but I could see it being an addition. There may be complaints of lost outfits if it is removed from the Costume Room.
---
My job isn't necessarily concerning myself with implementing the content, and that shouldn't be a big concern for me or any reader. I'm here to convey an idea--a concept that balances and fits into the world of OSRS.
---
I think he‚Äôs directing that toward the other guy
---
Combined with chair-shitting EHP anime neckbeards for extra efficiency.
---
Tfw you do it and your dick goes down like 1500 gp
---
Most people prefer old models.
---
We should also make the 200m hard cap on skills lower too. 
---
I started to try to get to 200m agility and only made it to level 86. They lost a customer that day and another 10$. I just lost complete interest.
---
Just read what you said again and try to see how stupid your comment was
---
Let me dream.
---
Will never vote anything, even on my main.
---
400 clues too
---
I‚Äôm sure they need go to buy bonds and that‚Äôs why they are asking.
---
Meh.. the most common argument is that it‚Äôs not something that people feel that strongly about.
---
Problem is half of that time that people love to brag about are probably them being afk doing something or just bankstanding and skilling  lol. That's why I'm always never impressed by long hours, it's mostly artificial. Other people do it in other games especially in steam dropping reviews with 3-5k hours saying a one liner but when you check their profile they only have a couple of achievements on there...
---
Well shit, the more you know
---
Naw he‚Äôs not really right though. He‚Äôs confused on what the word *should* means here. 
---
In a stats context the word *should* is used to denote expected values. In 5,000 kills you *should* receive a pet, and the original poster even clarified by adding the qualifier *on average*. Saying this is false is wrong
---
E all of the above
---
Second option bias
---
398 is the max you could possibly get
---
You are essentially what you‚Äôre making fun of
---
Yep. You tank and spank with your pointy stick.
---
height is all rng just like drops on runescape
---
I really disagree
---
Unless you boss you rely on rare drops or it's just very SLOW money while SLOW combat xp 
---
Not until 80-85 will you start making decent gp AND xp an hour
---
They look bad. Game will die.
---
World 46 numba one
---
imagine having bad rng
---
But wouldnt crystal bow with armor do more dps? And fairly low cost, no shards needed for armor either.
---
But people weren't complaining about option C, they were complaining about option A
---
It's the same as 99% of the game, do you find the other chatheads hideous as well?
---
I took your advice very seriously last time, put it into this idea, and now you say this? I'm not offended, just confused. Can you elaborate?
---
Yeah, its completely reasonable for someone to choose not to have any kids, but that sub looks scary.  I just read a rant and they referred to the parents as "breeders" and the kids as "failed abortions" and a "burden on the earth".  I don't understand the disconnect that you must have to justify your own existence, but think all children are a burden on society and a waste of space.
---
cant, garg boss only available if  i get a garg task
---
You dense motherfucker...
---
It does. Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs really not a lot in osrs. You can accumulate 200 hours playing pretty casually in about 2 months and still not have a ‚Äúgood‚Äù account unless you have a lot of money to spare and know what you are doing.
---
Fully agree.  I thought a similar thing about the numbers during the partnerships poll.  That poll gained about 60k votes, and granted it was shut down early but with something that big you would think there would be a bigger turnout.  
---
Another interesting fact, hiding poll results did very little to affect voter turnout.  Most polls clock in under 80k votes, which is barely 20% of this subreddits subscribers and you know that number is worse if you compare it to total members.
---
So, if you press the big red report button by the chat box that says ‚ÄúReport‚Äù click report abuse, then type in their name. Please open your eyes before you rag on something.
---
I don‚Äôt understand your post. Please describe more
---
In RS3 it's Nex. But in OSRS there's really nothing there in actuality. well technically Nex IS there at least according to the lore.
---
Care to list a source? I know plenty of unamabitous people in their twenties who spend all day on Reddit and YouTube 
---
Not me of course
---
Ok thanks!
---
I guess it would require perfect RNG which will never happen.
---
You could do the same pre nerf too, it's just that it's a ton easier now to get faster times since you take half damage.
---
No not really, this is about Elena, a human, she is not an elf. in a matter of a day we were given 3 previews on which we could vote and the cicle jerk on here for a big part kep insisting most people prefer the old "good" design.
---
im doing a faux ironman gameplay and want to take my time with everything and experience it all to the fullest and not buy my skills like i did when i was 10 years old. I say faux ironman because obviously i will be using ge for selling stuff and making money but for the most part im gonna try to tough it out and make runes, aromor, weapons etc. 
---
thanks for the reply and good luck on your adventures. i just started on sunday and so glad to be back into it
---
Not that i agree with anything they are doing this is agaisnt subrules to call out a player acuse them of wrong doing.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
shit now i gotta use my hand and multitask
---
I prefer this one https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SlxbHJokMGsPGqIHcY4SXvzouuYdbZ8TYHYCbFRTWXA/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Looks like ranarr is higher based on it.
---
I was high af and logged in forgetting that I was in fally mines so I went and took a piss and came back to me being in lumbridge oof.
---
again..its cus ur a casual. its just how it is. you dont know what you are doing. thats why you are still mid 1600s, havent experienced most of osrs contents, dont have any backstory or history on any updates, dont know or consider what updates you read on polls will affect the game. your opinion just matters less than the people who actually play the game
---
I just don't understand why people make such a big deal out of a little chat head. Get over it.
---
really? ill test it out!
---
Shit when did Archie leave jagex
---
People like your content and you. Make a patreon. People will donate just to support your video making habits. Currently you don‚Äôt have any avenues for fans to choose to support you directly.
---
ur name's Clarence
---
Why wouldn't it be a 1/5000 on first kill? You kill one, which has a 1/5000 drop rate, so your chance to get one in one kill is 1/5000...
---
Someone didn‚Äôt read dev blogs lul
---
Mind runes are the fastest way to get the RC pet.
---
So you get off to rubbing rings, do yuh?
---
If you're wanting to get runes, it's probably best to buy them from shops (e.g. Varrock Rune Shop).
---
Not the worst bosses to dry on a pet in terms of loot. Archer and Zerk rings for days but that's still a huge oof.
---
2 months of 3+ hour a day every day is still a lot for most people..Sure weekends add more time but I'm talking in averages.
---
4 from max hit
---
How do you make enough money for a bond in f2p? I‚Äôm approaching 50 in each f2p skill and I‚Äôd really like to switch to p2p :)
---
You‚Äôre overthinking this. If hundreds of people flip a coin thousands of times, statistically they are all incredibly likely to be near 50/50, with that likeliness increasing with each coin flip. In regards to the duel arena, there is no system deciding who wins or loses, it is 100% rng on every whip attack. Everyone is just as likely to have good rng in a stake as they are bad rng. It‚Äôs that simple. The more stakes you do, the more closer your ratio will get to 50:50.
---
Back to your thesis calling this platform small, it shows who the dense one really is.
---
Correct, when you open the world map in prif it treats it like a dungeon
---
&gt; I guarantee the ratios would not even be close to each other by the end...
---
This isn't true. The more you toss, the more likely you are to trend toward the 1:1 ratio, and 3000 tosses is definitely enough.
---
Oh I'm well aware.  My comment was half serious, half mocking.  For the complaints I see here about new players being sheep who vote in everything, I'm willing to bet most new players don't even vote.  It's a small minority of the player base that actually votes in polls.
---
You are not taking into account variables? Are you? I mean think if you had wind and a bunch of different environmental factors at play. In OSRS the only variables for that are FPS and internet connection and those are big variables, but it seems the system balances itself.
---
Just a little bit of technique. So humble for being the best
---
Holy fuck that's sweaty.
---
Agreed. But don‚Äôt forget that some players are wee kids and don‚Äôt have jobs lol.
---
Is it still viable to get into this game? How freemium is it?
---
Did I give a name?
---
Haha wait seriously can some please explain for those OOTL?
---
He used to be a mod right? And now he‚Äôs started streaming? 
---
I AM NOT TROLLING I GENUINELY DONT KNOW
---
.
---

---
Can confirm... I'm... OP's...Chair... God help me.
---
4pm? Sad day
---
It's hard to make consistent good money in F2P. It'll take you waaayy longer in F2P in comparison to the same stats in P2P.
---
The usual suggestion is that if you can afford membership, buy it with IRL money rather than bonds. If you're really tight, try 1 month and it'll be a lot easier to maintain it once you've started.
---
Shards are worth more than marks of grace though, even with divine strength pots you make about 10k a shard. I think it‚Äôs even more with divine combat pots. Unless the value of divine pots has lowered since the other day.
---
When farming patches are inspected, it'll say if the patch was treated with compost or not. If the growth tracker is finding out what stage of growth a patch is somehow, could the data for whether that patch has been composted also be found similarly?
---
Try it out man! I just finished 99 made 130m
---
Thanks!
---
I don't know why you said it so rudely! Goodness!
---
And clearly many more liked the old design over the new one they put in so the point stands. A vs b, b has 75% of that vote.
---
I really dislike how they feel like they can add large amounts of content unpolled just because they release a new quest and "it isnt BIS".
---
Just stick to yes and no questions where it takes 75% to change the game from its original state.
---
I thought them not specifically polling Ballistas would have showen them that new content even if they think its not a big deal can have a huge impact on the game. 
---
These blank checks when designing content really should stop especially with the more recent track record.
---
Are you still on this?
---
... okay.
---
I would be fine with a q p requirement.
---
unfortunately, after the Mod Jed scandal, simply having someone on payroll isn't quite enough to eliminate or even lessen risk.  which also kind of counters the point, if you can't trust their own staff, is it really that much bigger of a risk to use a third party client?  
---
Respectfully, a neckbeard still on vanilla client.
---
\*tips boater\*
---
I got my answer above! :D I just want Jagex to be more strict with bans, I guess. We've reported this player several times, as their account was made specifically to harass me. But thanks!
---
They said at the start this one was short so they could put the results in today's update.  The community demanded they be listened to so Jagex catered.  
---
Remember that all it takes to vote is pulling out your phone and running to the nearest bank.
---
He‚Äôs not
---
&gt; This is what the argument has been about, he never suggested it increased drop rate in a group, he just suggested that it was a way that ironmen could boost for items
---
Yes he did. Go check the video and watch his tweets lmfao. He suggested you can "guarantee" drops, youre not guaranteeing anything, you get the same rate of drops but youre taking away drops from your teammates. The worst thing ive ever heard that cant be defended. Stay subbed to him for more misinformative garbage content lmfao.
---
Lmfao
---
I lost a few mil buying nats from her before I realized what was going on
---
Dude you are tremendously stupid.
---
Fuck... Alright you guys are probably right. I really hope the system doesn't overtake the RNG. I just don't want to play and gamble and it be predetermined by fixed RNG.
---
Approved
---
This is what y‚Äôall get for letting warding fail lol
---
I must just have bad luck but you can't tank a clan if they know what they are doing
---
im gonna ask the audience
---
Can we get 5 instakill darts pls, not opop
---
When they bother to patch it i'll stop reposting it
---
If they did it should be an opt-in thing.
---
That's not how polls work.
---
I guess things are just so well with the game now that people find time to argue about a chat head lol.
---
Big Jiant Snake
---
ok thanks for the tip! i realistically am not gonna get my rc to max any time soon but i do want to start getting my magic up? any tips on that l? i plan on using air staff until i can use water strike and then using water staff for a bit but not sure how long i should use that combo for and when to switch spells to something more rewarding xp wise
---
Eat candy ofc
---
Yes. 20mins
---
Or another
---
Congratzz brotherrr
---
I think I agree, it would.
---
Ags gmaul max main here. spec 120 easy all day
---
Lol wtf? If you make a guide and its wrong so people correct it and you respond like this you're a fucking sperg.
---
Perhaps, but that risk is significantly lowered. There‚Äôs no way to fully eliminate risk, just migrate it to the best of their ability
---
Ok, I‚Äôm sure I can scrape ¬£6 together for such a great game :)
---
Guess not didnt see the bracketed name.
---
You could always try use the in game report feature though if they dont speak, Just type their name in there.
---
Seems like it lol
---
This is what you should be looking at as any starting account.
---
I never said it was small lmao. Again with the reading comprehension.
---
I said that 1-3k upvotes out of 400k people on the subreddit is not an indication of the community views. The vocal minority on any social media is not a reason to change or cancel an update as a reaction, without actually getting data from the more general player base. Not sure how that's so hard for you to follow.
---
I agree they really need to take action on the accounts that are made solely on the basis of bullying.
---
well not if it doesn‚Äôt work lol I‚Äôll just go find a rat
---
You didn't say content devs you said mods flat out.
---
The game is the shit already bro.
---
I gave an account to a friend like this, weirdly same stats...
---
Keep the stats and go low level Pking in F2P.
---
Once you get bored with it, get 50 att 75 str 1 def.
---
Try to keep the HP between 40-50
---
Hydra if 95 slayer
---
.....
---
While you may not be smithing it directly, perhaps your advanced knowledge of metallurgy somehow aids in the enchanting process. I haven't done the quest btw, just throwing out ideas.
---
What is that? I didnt know that interface was in the game
---
Maybe isn't the greatest idea to reveal his username for a bunch of crazy people to contact.
---
There‚Äôs no fault. Nobody is being harmed.
---
Cool Thanks man. I joined the cc earlier on. All sounds good. I will definitely be around for some godwars (As long as it's not Sara I'm a pleb with 66 agi)
---
I was just trying to help and keep you informed? You gave next to no context until you replied. Guess I'm glad you got scammed now, dumbass kid
---
You are using stretched on runelite. Game works as intended on vanilla. Talk to runelite not jagex.
---
Its more of a pain to get around cus of the sheer size of the area and books blocking the way, but theres nothing to attack you so you can take all the time you want, theres no danger
---
call it an 'integrity change' too :)
---
Yeah casuals keep downvoting me cuz u dont like people getting rewarded for effort!!! Keep it up
---
Yeah I have nothing against people who choose not to have kids. It's all good. Your life, your choice, etc. But jesus they act so damn smug about it, as if they're part of some elite, higher class of society, and that anyone who even dares speak to them about their kids is a stain on the fabric of their beliefs.
---
They don't delete accounts.
---
I went 4:11 nobody was there lol
---
Basically modern day Babe Ruth calling his homerun.
---
So you ended up not in the safezone sounds like this is your fault.
---
This exact post was posted yesterday...  other things are way more important.
---
I just punched that one into my calculator and it's saying "Invalid input".  So I guess that's why.
---
The majority of people dont want to tick manipulate, or do everything at 100% efficiency. That's not fun. We play games for fun. Just because someone isnt doing everything maximizing every possible way to get the most xp out of every half second doesn't mean they're a casual. I dont like staring at my runescape screen 24/7 when I'm playing. I watch youtube Netflix and hang out on discord. I would lose my mind if I was prayer flicking piety every hit when I'm training slayer. It's a game for fun. Stop being a dick.
---
You. I'm voting for you in the next presidential election.  
---
Thank you kind stranger.
---
That doesn‚Äôt explain how they got your pin?
---
Guarantee if they had a poll first to change it everybody would have voted no
---
zezima apparently ^_^
---
Everyone in a pvp world wants your shit. Don‚Äôt involve yourself with anyone except for using your keyboard to type/talk. This is completely on you mate. Not all people have to learn the hard way. WAHH...my pixels!
---
Is zamorakian hasta worth it for slayer? I was thinking of getting it for dragons like steels or should i jusr block/skip them
---
remember when members was $7? same
---
Which somebody already has done better, long before you. Making yours irrelevant.
---
Literally been on there for years bud
---
They definitely used the broadcast system for this poll, as they have with every poll. Im not sure if they used the town criers or not, but those are pretty insignificant anyway, and its not really worth it just for a poll about changing a single chathead.
---
Youre acting like jagex is doing all this shady stuff to try and subvert people so that they can keep their old chathead, but the reality is they really dont mind. Im not sure why this has been blown so out of proportion by this sub. Its a chathead. Yes it looked derpy. Most people dont care that much, there are already plenty of derpy chatheads.
---
In the good ol days it was like $7-8
---
The 'new new' one is literally a mix between the old and the new one and looks closer to older chatheads. So this actually proves the vast majority want older-looking chatheads.
---
I play runescape.
---
And with 30 years I've literary been there right at the start when the first multiplayer games became popular. From the very start I have rejected the constant verbal harassment and I cannot and will not accept that.
---
Why? Why do video game companies not just hold the same rules as say Wimbledon or any tennis court? -- Flaming is a disqualification and actual harassment or homophobia is a lifelong banishment of the whole sports.
---
You really made an infographic for the poll results, mad lad
---
Again you‚Äôre the 7th person to say something dumb like this. I traded someone standing in the middle of the bank and the next thing that happened is I ran backwards out of the bank through the southern entrance and before my character stepped through the double doors I saw the animation of ice barrages rain falling onto my character and then I was frozen one step out of the bank.
---
Try joining the discord and asking in #support
---
&gt;Omg D warhammer

The fact that you wrote

---
after actually getting it, determined that was a lie
---
I can't believe this, I grinded all the way to 80 smithing and only just realized i'm missing the 80 smithing requirement...
---
This is true, for some reason when I read the .998846 it registered in my brain as .998846% instead of 99.8846%. I was wrong.
---
iirc it comes with 500 charges by default but it can hold more. For long trips you‚Äôll want to add more shards before use.
---
He makes runescape videos, even advertisers know runescape video viewers are poor lmao
---
He was trying to save you from the mistake that is making a pure.
---
The neckbeards in there weren‚Äôt happy :)
---
C looks like an older model, so yes the majority want older looking models, this thread really backfired on you
---
It took a very long time i dont know exact hours but estimate of 130hours -140 75-99 if your on it and if you want an afk method mlm will still make you a nice 90m profit but will take twice as long lol i switched up alot 70-75 for afking at mlm its not so bad with some good music in the background
---
Pretty sure duradel is the best for both gp and xp. Do xp tasks until you unlock like cerb then swap to gp.
---
Dynamite also sells alot lower then what ge says
---
Hahaha someone got me with that in like 2006. Glad to see old habits dont die lol
---
Well I‚Äôm just glad some lowlife sits at his computer at 2 am trying to bug the game to make fake money. I‚Äôm sure iRogue Kills is a super in shape and well mannered kind of guy outside of the game for sure. Everyone should add iRogue Kills and tell him how cool he is.
---
It's karils armor but reskinned and with a pray bonus basically.
---
This is completely false. If a bot needs to use the official client that just means the devs haven't properly setup their bot client. Client side info can always be spoofed.
---
If yes, you're a capitalist!
---
Capitalism has no incentive to solve world hunger because profit comes first! and MY GOD knows those filthy negros yield no gold anymore. 
---
Yay.
---
No, the lift puzzle is a longer but;
---
No inventory management as the mirrors stack
---
No aggressive shades( even though now they changed that in mep2, they now no longer close the interface)
---
Closer to a bank
---
Teleports around the maze (using completed seals)
---
Agility handhold is easier( purely anecdotal at 71 i failed mep2 4/5 times each, but in sote I only failed each of them once
---
It‚Äôs fairly linear: it‚Äôs split up into zones and has transport up and down in each room
---
Also has the best song in the game, I listened to it straight the whole time I was doing the quest
---
TLDR: maybe slightly longer but much easier and straightforward
---
You sound like an asshole
---
This is a great idea, adding imbues as a common item to the mini-game shops would be a good step towards making NMZ less necessary too
---
Yeah sorry, exactly what I was thinking!
---
https://i.imgur.com/43TAaEs.png Incorrect
---
While I agree with you, I think if a task-based skill was polled, it would be a lot closer to passing than Sailing, Artisan, or Warding were.
---
What I said is correct. You personally insulting me at the end of all of your posts is not gonna make what I said less correct. Stay uninformed lmfao.
---
this is the single most necessary thing that needs to be fixed/implemented before LMS can be taken seriously by anyone. the fact that such a gamebreaking bug has been around for so long is kind of a joke. glad they are finally getting on the ball and attempting to fix it though
---
Wrong.  Though our points are similar, we came to different conclusions.  Thus, my point is still irrelevant which corrects your mistake that is misinforming the sub.  You're welcome.
---
Jagex could create gold or items and trade it around if they wanted to, no reason to go through the trouble of building a bot farm and waiting for it to produce.
---
That stream clip is the same one used in the clip of him doing Zulrah and barb fishing. Not sure whether to call it a repost or shit post.
---
Doesnt feel very old school... but i love it.
---
Hunter is my least favorite skill and while I'm not sure I'd really enjoy all of this content, I have mad respect for how much work you put into it to try and make Hunter something people want to do.
---
r/IncelTears
---
I'm pretty sure the ones who wanted the original are fine with the compromise, which actually looks like an older model, so your sarcastic title is correct
---
Well the conclusions are pretty underwhelming, we already knew all of that. I guess its never a bad thing to reconfirm
---
this is insane
---
Collection log. Book from varrock museum or you can make one in you poh
---
Yeah, it's clear people want a new skill, it's also clear we will likely never get 3/4 of the community to agree on one. Good luck Jagex.
---
I'd buy it

Collector--&gt;Healer--&gt;Attacker--&gt;Defender. when the queen spawns she will drop yellow eggs that must be made into omega eggs to kill her. Collector picks up eggs and gives them to the healer (use the egg on them), the healer dips it in either poison or lava (i forget which) and gives it to attacker, attacker dips it in the other one and gives to defender, defender puts spikes on it and gives it back to collector who loads it into the cannon. you need 8 eggs to kill it, but there is a 1 egg method as well. watch a video about it and only bother with 1 egg if everyone is on board because it requires marginally more coordination. also remember the yellow eggs despawn pretty quick so you gotta keep your eyes open.
---
Can't do this in F2p iirc
---
Thats animation stalling, classic lure. Epic goof buddy
---
It‚Äôs only close to 2m a hour if you get blade. If you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs more like 800k a hour. That is pretty shit when some skilling methods offer more per hour then an extremely click intensive wannabe DG.

Criticism is healthy when worded constructively.

The wiki quick guide is incredibly easy to follow. Just go for it.

If you have the extra gold but not the points to skip then sure. But I skip all metal dragons other than rune.

There's an onion patch in Northeast(ish) Priff
---
Any onion patches in elf land? Talk to NPC's that are around / tend to patches, if any. Maybe dig at one of them if there are any?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What's the scientific name for onions? Maybe that's a name of an NPC or something, or maybe there is elf speak for onion that will line up. 
---
Just some thoughts.
---
What did you sell for, I know they started to crash earlier.
---
Step 1 - pick flax
---
Step 2 - profit
---
This is interesting. Thanks! Makes sense.
---
If you bot wisely and reasonably jagex will never detect you. Avoid bots with excessive downloads (generally), bot reasonable playtimes and hours, don't use super basic bots, and you'll never be caught even using top Google search result bots.
---
Most botting clients using mirror and similar safer methods to interact only do so on the default client. Runemate for example doesn't recognize anything but default client and it's the 2nd most popular bot used.
---
I'd normally agree but I think skilling bosses were intended to be more cooperative than competitive
---
What do you mean? I'd love an Electric Light Orchestra system
---
Post it bro. Expose the secrets

I don't hate them but it is annoying that you have to right click the gate and click the "pay 10 gp" to pass, even if you have completed the quest, there is just no logic to it, same with the gate at Port Phasmatys, they should both be left-clickable after the quests have been completed.
---
Did they remove it from zulrah drop table?
---
Because the problem isnt the chaos elemental is getting team killed too much lol
---
Yeah I quit a little after Summoning was introduced, I know every little about Runesxape after that. I wont lie if a new skill is added it could very well be just RS3 all over again. I can say from my point of view that as of now a new skill isnt that important to me. Im a mid-high level account and have barely touched end game activities. I personally have plenty of stuff to do in game and as for higher level players they aren‚Äôt begging for a new skill and they are probably the most bored of anyone. I understand that the 1% shouldnt be what the game is balanced or updated around, but other than the ‚Äúnew toy‚Äù aspect of a brand new skill I dont see the need for it as of now. Let the 1% get bored and in a couple of years I bet a new skill passes.

Please post some of the inside! Ive always wondered what it contained lol

Are you telling me that the purchase of bonds is real-life taxable? When using in-game gold?
---
Slayer is my 2nd least liked skill (only Farming is worse in my eyes), but I still voted for another task-oriented skill.  I like the idea of adding 2 new task skills: Gatherer and Producer (names are a W.I.P.).
---
Gatherer is Slayer but for Mining, Woodcutting, etc.
---
Producer is Slayer but for Crafting, Smithing, etc.
---
I like the diversity that Slayer brings to combat training, I just wish it was easier to filter out bad/unenjoyable tasks.  I think 1 or 2 skills that bring that same diversity to gathering and producing would be a welcome change.
---
However, I'd also accept a minigame reminiscent of Stealing Creation instead of new task skills.  Imagine a minigame where you utilize mining/woodcutting/etc to make your way through obstacles in a maze, and crafting/smithing/etc to build traps/bridges or fix machinery.  You'd get skilling exp from playing the game, and maybe get rewards based off your score (rewards could either be purely cosmetic or could give bonuses to skilling instead of combat).
---
Now that I think about it, a Rogues' Den minigame for other skills would probably be my favorite update to OSRS, if it could pass the poll.
---
I read your name as rune farting for a moment lol. Alright, you didn't specify which jar so I could plenty of empty jars I can give you for 11 dollars.

What are your stats? if you don't mind letting me know! i am at the point where i want to but i'm nervous!!
---
Yeah I only came back with mobile and last i played was before the ge existed in any version of the game. No way in hell I'm voting for dungeoneering. Any skill that you can't realistically train as soon as you step off tutorial island is just bad imo. I also don't want a group based skill. Wt is different cause there's no real teamwork, you just show up and do your thing. I don't want to have to organize a group just to get some xp.
---
Ignorance is bliss.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. Not at all. Read the damn discussion. This guy abused a bug and got my items. I NEVER left the safe zone and had absolutely no intentions of doing so. Yes I understand all you‚Äôre poorly worded statements but it‚Äôs really hard to avoid doing something when it‚Äôs like this. This is all on @jagex for having a poorly coded game.

I meant that I‚Äôm assuming OP is not native to the UK, so he‚Äôll have to pay a small international transaction fee when purchasing Jagex services. Given that OP made multiple transactions and each one went back and forth from Jagex to the bank multiple times, the international fees probably stacked up a lot.

Wanted advice on Vorkath upgrades. I just hit 50 kc for assembler, and it usually takes 3-4 minutes per kill, with one kill per inventory.
---
Stats are 78 range / 75 att / 75 str / 73 def / 70 prayer. Currently using god dhide top/bottom/coif, snakeskin boots, salve (ei), god blessing, and barrows gloves. Using blowpipe and bgs spec to start. 
---
What should I get next to upgrade? Trying to decide whether to start chinning range up, go for void, buy Karil's, get serp helm, buy blessed boots, get a ring, etc.
---
I currently have about 4 or 5m liquid, so should I just keep trucking until I have more cash?
---
Why do I want to eat them?
---
I guess it takes one to know one? I like rig but you are actually one of the saddest stories in OSRS lmao
---
They stated in the blog it didn't need 75% to pass since it was opinion. So they'll change it to C.
---
Didn't hide mining exp, gf acc!
---
I guess I should've been taking notes
---
Lmao the Armadyl Chestplate drop
---
Coming from literally any other mmo a new player would assume it doesn't work. I started with mobile and when I downloaded the desktop client I honestly thought it was broken. Then I found out it doesn't have gpu acceleration or ui scaling or anything else.
---
Like I legitimately thought something was wrong with my pc or the client but no that's just how it is. I've played the game for maybe an hour total on the default client.
---
Yep. Vorkath and Zulra are basically the Same fight they should just put them together.
---
"toon" is used in every game except rs.  Character is a pain in the butt to type out lol.
---
around 226k gp each via BH shop
---
t10 is 2,1m =5m pts
---
540k pts per seed = 0,226M **M A T H S**
---
source from bh won't make them drop prices until they get over 220k ea... kinda silly
---
Huh. Any reason for that? I feel it shouldn't be like that.
---
Yea I would agree, if one is cheating than they both are. I think people don't realize how powerful runelite already is.  A good example would be clue puzzles. When is the last time you saw someone do one legit?
---
so what? people prowarding should have done the same thing if they really cared
---
Blessed boots and archers ring will help for sure. Make sure to imbue the ring.
---
Chinning for range gets real expensive real fast, almost certainly not worth it for now.
---
After boots and ring, Karil's will mostly just help with having to use less food because of slightly better range def. Serp helm you don't want, it'll tank your ability to hit.
---
After that its a while until big upgrades. DWH should be a priority, it helps a lot compared to BGS because of consistency. After that you can maybe upgrade to some arma pieces if you want, but they're big cost for not huge upgrade. Its mostly just a grind until DHCB after that. DHCB will be by far the biggest upgrade you can get, and its basically worth liquidating your bank to get if you want to farm vork.
---
The way you described yourself is the epitome of being a casual. It's not a bad thing and you shouldn't feel insulted by any means. The point I'm trying to support is just that doing a bit of slayer each day on a 1600s total account doesn't make you qualified to make big decisions on the vast majority of high level content you haven't experienced.
---
Lumby Diaries for extra slayer block and no draman staff for fairy rings.
---
Kebos Lowlands Diary for no boots of brimstone needed in Karulum Slayer Cave.
---
Also Karamja agility shortcut in Shilo Village.
---
Back in the day, training rc was tolerable because it was really good money compared to other things. Now it's just..not.
---
Artisan is a task based skill though and got destroyed in this poll
---
Does Turael reset your task streak is you get a task from him? I'm on a streak of 69 (lol nice) mostly from Konar, but I'm thinking about doing Turael tasks until 99 streaks so I can get the 100 point boost. I just wasn't sure if Turael reset your streak.
---
Gotta consider that osrs is a game that requires a little more time played to truly enjoy it. It‚Äôs a Grindy game and ~3 hours a day on average isn‚Äôt much to ask of a gamer. It‚Äôs not like FIFA or 2K where you can play a couple games and get immediate enjoyment
---
Loaning money to an alt isnt the same as RWT.  You might make 9m an hour, but YOU made it.  Once you RWT the money loses meaning, and the game quickly ceases to be just a game.
---
I only got 69 slayer for my quest cape and it was utter hell
---
Nope, he only resets your streak if you use him to cancel an existing task. As long as you get a task from him while you currently dont have one, you're fine.
---
Yes, only sources are 1 per acc after the questing to unlock these weps, and the gauntlet (time/effort to farm one is over 6h of sweat for a consistent corrupt 10min runner).
---
Dude like everyone I can think of that‚Äôs big does their own merch it‚Äôs pretty simple.
---
Your comment with the guide doesn't show up by the way, probably the Amazon links is my guess, might want to message the mods
---

---
Yeah the Barrows teleport spell/teletabs made that aspect completely bunk. I don't really mind it though, even with that shortcut behind the bar, running through the swamp every time for years got pretty old
---
I'm a dumbass. I read the skip as total. Yeah that's a fair sample size.
---
So I could boost to 99 streak from him? I currently don't have a task.
---
You don‚Äôt combine the enhanced teleport seed with another teleport seed, you combine it with 100 crystal shards.
---
Because Jagex will take the easiest and laziest route every time so you end up with a mess of spaghetti code
---
I'm sorry can you elaborate? Everything looks fine on my end, let me check by logging off of reddit.
---
All these chat head redesigns were most likely finalized before warding even went to the polls dumbass
---
I got mine on 14kc while casually doing a task on mobile during a road trip. Just shows you that you should never pass on an opportunity to play some OSRS.
---
You should have just set up the canifis tele from ancients as a portal in your house, you can do that with 50 con which was pretty easy to get with Barrows money back then
---
But Jagex doesnt want us to know them : /
---
You get them from pickpocketing and killing elves within Priffdinas (and maybe Lletya, I haven‚Äôt checked).
---
Well I don't use RuneLite so I did one legit last weekend but I totally agree that RuneLite is way too op in some aspects. It kinda ruins game integrity tbh. I would like to see Jagex improve the official cleints performance and add a few plugins and then ban 3rd party clients.

Unsure why my rates are higher, im also using varrock armour 3
---
Ngl would be interested in that again if DDOS'ing was guaranteed to not re-emerge
---
I mean it's good money if you do it while building your account, when the 400k/h from nats is pretty much the best you can consistantly do, rather then neglecting it until the point where you're farming zulrah/vork. Can't recall there ever being a point where RC could compete with the top methods besides RS3's mud runes before double XP weekends
---
How many days in a row are you post this?

Yeah they only show up for you and(maybe) the mods, I believe. I only saw it by looking at your profile

You make absolute bank after 99 smithing, its a good skill to 200m first if you're trying to fund a project like this.

the boss isnt the issue its the 7:30 time cap and rng making it very difficult to get what you need
---
Sorry man just kinda busting your balls at this point, don't want to antagonize you

I'm very well 99.  685 KC at the time of this message, and nearly 17M exp. LOL.  The pants dream is real.

Thanks, everyone! I got my answer. I wish I could report players' actions using the correct category though.

Does your well informed really smart opinion take into account to that new players might want to see something other than 800x600 cpu rendered 30fps unscaled in 2019?

By the time I unlock hydra in like the year 2050 they will probably be 1m lol

remind you to never PK because one guy is insanely good? this mentality makes no sense

So your advice for making money is to spend money?
---
It's really not shady... it's actually more open source than regular runelite is. Coming from someone who's never touched rl+.
---
No, the probability is 0.00115. Converted to a percentage it's 0.115%.
---
And u pretty much proved my point by saying stay in singles( or join a huge clan like me). Exactly why its dieing out. Again just my opinion
---
I loved bragging about killing nearly 7000 abby demons before getting a whip just because not a single person believed me.
---
The gauntlet is much more stressful and focus-dependent. Surely, you should be rewarded more gp/hour for this pvm challenge that is much less likely to a have 100% success rate than a simple swamp snake or undead dragon. Loot needs to be buffed in both normal and corrupted imo. Corrupted is at most 2.5m per hour based on current statistics and that‚Äôs assuming you NEVER FAIL. This is unrealistic in an heavily rng dependent boss like this. Hopefully they can address this because otherwise, I undoubtably see this becoming dead content soon enough.
---
I did this quest yesterday, props to wiki for being very clear on it. Half my screen was the game and the other half was a map of the puzzle (map has numbered locations) . The only ones I had to re-look at the guide for was when the light needed to go

Up or down.

At least get a 99 to make fireworks go off on rs and irl at the same time

I have a fresh idea for contracts that I might make a post about, it's essentially contracts using a bunch of different skills but it would hopefully have open ended choices, more immergent gameplay and will be more thematic like a minigame. I'm just not a proper designer for it

they became friends when pigsfly77 convinced OP to come into the wilderness so he could "film something for his Youtube Channel".  He has been plotting his revenge ever since. You know what to do.

How do kronos plants work? I had a kronos seed planted and was training herblore at the farming guild to keep an eye on the herb patch there so I could do an herb run when it was fully grown. When it grew and I did the herb run, most of the other herb patches were fully grown as well, except for the ardougne and falador patches, which were still only about halfway done. Any reason why this might be? I thought if an herb patch skips a growth cycle, all other herb patches will skip a growth cycle too?

I would think having an OG name would make your account more secure. No way for your email address used for both your account and email to get phished at the same time. Since it‚Äôs OG, there is probably no record of your old username on the internet and if there is, it‚Äôs probably on some long dead forum by now. I like not having to put in an email address
---
Fuck kempqüòÇ
---
That entire paragraph is one sentence. Nice.
---
Maybe the way I define something not working is just say too different from yours.  When I think of something that doesn't work I think of something that black screens constantly, crashes all the time, lags like all hell, or is completely unresponsive to clicks.  I don't think of something that is lacking utilities.  
---
I don't know if you've ever played League of Legends but their client is something I would consider, for the most part, as broken.  If you leave it open for long periods of time it starts to run at like 3 FPS and it will take like 30 seconds to respond to what you clicked on, sometimes when you click on a new tab it will just be a black screen and you'll have to click on a different tab in the client and then back on the original tab you wanted to get it to work, and other random errors will pop up from time to time that I don't even know what I did to cause them (although the error itself doesn't even appear to be anything).  That is what I think of when someone says the client is broken or trash.
---
not everyone is hella poor man.

How did ho not properly place ads on the video?  He said he had 4 mid roll ads.  Is there something I'm missing?

That post is made up of one sentence. nice.

I mean the url says .ru, they're not trying very hard
---
There are people like me who enjoy the diversity Slayer brings to training combat, but hate how hard (and/or grindy) it is to tailor your tasks to things you enjoy and/or make a decent profit.
---
I can understand how other skills pretty much have a definitive "best method" for training at a certain level, and therefore you could feel burnt out by doing the exact same thing over and over again, but there are technically options with how you train.  Take WC: there's a best xp/hour method for just about every level (and eventually 3-ticking Teaks is just best exp/hr), but if you'd rather be more AFK or make more money you have some options.  Slayer, on the other hand, tells you how to train, and you have to earn enough points to skip/block tasks you find boring or unprofitable.  There's really no way to tailor your Slayer experience until you're a decently high level (at least in my limited experience with the skill).
---
In corrupt gauntlet, the most I've been hit through prayer today has been a 14 (In 22 runs), so it's likely that's what they've reduced it to from 20 max.

There's already one at front page let's not flood it with this shit

Why are the pie charts not proportionate? [This](https://i.imgur.com/r06XQDt.png) is definitely not 51%. It's a little misleading don't you think?

I feel ashamed for not realising what an absolute beast mat k is until now
---
A very small percentage of the overall player population are competitive about high scores. This would be one of those features that a lot of people would check once say neat and then never interact with it again.
---
Its one thing to /flex your vorkath kill count between your small group of friends its another to see that you are 15,521st place having 7k kills. Are you really telling me a lot of people are going to see that and find motivation in getting another 100k+ kills to hit the front page?
---
Yeah
---
Which DPS calc do you use? I've been meaning to find one/figure out how to use it for exactly this type of thing!
---
You can buy like bankspace and presets and cosmetics but you can't use th to buy xp on irons.
---
Yep, I got around 9 MVPs in around 45 kills and even without getting MVP I was getting an average per kill of over 100k. Got an onyx as well.
---
It doesn't matter there. Her clones and healing thingies work as small plants at the farming boss.  Always 5hp hit. 68range tho, mith darts.
---
Hihgly doubt, I was just lucky with hits, so, I assume, they are one hits
---
Sorry, but I can't see any good ways for a boss like this to work. From what I can see either the time to kill the boss has to be very long like at least 2 min per kill I would say even more or the gp/h has to be way higher. 
---
The problem with higher gp/h is people would just use cheap gear so they never actually loose anything big and still makes bank.
---
I fucked up the last two charts.
---
Your previous 2 commwnts proved you know nothing about botting so might aswell just shut up now.
---
Because the formula you‚Äôve proposed wouldn‚Äôt give the right answer...try calculating it for yourself
---
2007 slayer no uniques
---
I bring dragon darts for just had, that with rigour/99 range and Slayer helm makes it so you can out damage the healers
---
Personally, MLM wasn't afk enough for me. I ended up switching to amethyst shortly after 92 because it requires way less attention and clicking.
---
I don‚Äôt get it either. They assume reasons we do this which are just not there.. Idk
---
This was my life on wow. We ran normal and heroics every week and I didnt get my first drop (at all) until week 3 and it was weaker than an item I had got from mythic dungeons lol. My luck was so bad that I was running mythic 10s and getting the same items every single time and by girlfriend was doing regular content and out gear leveled me.
---
I got 15 kills as well so far today and only got 750k... mining is 85. Could not get any MVP.
---
It's meant to be low range and faster, like darts, hence why its a throwable class weapon. Same speed as crossbow? Do some research...
---
I never said it was the only thing that made it valuable. But gutting the blowpipe dps would kill its value all together.
---
There are a bunch of "mystery box" websites that operate like this. So I'm guessing it's legal right now. Even though it is essentially gambling. This would be different though because you're guaranteed to get what you paid for, with just a small chance of getting something extra. As long as the something extra is available to purchase elsewhere I don't aee a problem with it.
---
You do not have to believe me, I do not want to get into it too far. But I know it is just not true.
---
RL+ has never upstreamed me anything. This is from PR #4708 which is from Aug 2018.
---
whenever i step toe in wildy i run into these john wicks.  thats what i call them atleast.   when you get attacked by a john wick your dead. i cant even type when these guys attack because i panic eat so hard.  i beg for mercy but they have no idea what that is.  after i die they dont even say anything. no "sit" nothing...   im almost convinced they use two mouses.
---
then maybe a random event shouldnt spawn as soon as i start combat &gt;&lt;

Probably day 1 prices. The blade was hugely expensive, and each shard was worth like 10k based on divine potion prices. The weapon seed is worth nothing, and the armor seed has stabilized at \~2mil, but I doubt that will last.

Your prayer is low, also the lower your stats/gear are the longer they will take to kill so the more the passive prayer drain effect will hit you

What is this poll? Was it conducted by players or Jagex? Why have I not heard of it until now?
---
In conclusion, under 4000 is a shit sample size if we are being honest. And if it was conducted on reddit only then it's even more shit because you're only asking people who are likely potentially influenced by reddit content/memes
---
This poll was made in good faith but to collect proper data, Jagex should run it in-game
---
what?
---
Thanks a lot
---
He didn‚Äôt vote. He doesn‚Äôt care.
---
The most fun way was probably chinning mm1 caves, because you get INSANE xp/hr. It's WAY more expensive than cannoning, which sucks. It's also not as AFK safe as cannon, because you have to pray pot every couple mins or you will die lol

That‚Äôs not a bad idea I‚Äôll look at how I can add this to my concept

Bear in mind that it is literally only profitable because of boots, all the other stuff (pages, cosmetics, etc.) Are just helping break even on implings. So if you get bored after 100 and didn't get boots you made no money at all, slight loss probably. You really have to commit to getting the boots.
---
I'd say close to 500k an hour, but I went dry on crystals for some time, got pet at 600kc though.  
---
Cerb can be insanely profitable per hour with drops on rate, I've heard 1m+ easy once you hit that prim crystal. Best of luck to ya
---
I think he can do better honestly.
---
I support having it be a GWD style loot pool, where your average run isn't going to be great money, you're looking for those big drops. But right now its kind of silly. 
---
Blade of Saeldor - 125mil
---
Armor seed - 2mil
---
Weapon seed - lol
---
I think there should be some other drop that people want, at like twice the droprate of the blade. Or maybe add elite clues? I dunno. 
---
I definitely don't think your average chest needs to be worth more, but I do think there should be a bit more at the top end.
---
This nigga, grade A cunt. Twat hits 25s through prayer. 
---
Like tf nigga. We get it you chin
---
Well that's depressing. I've playing on this account for over a decade, and now all that time and energy is gone for no reason. Fucking hell
---
How are then unnecessary? You also started this chain complaining about 20v1's... It really seems like you don't understand the wilderness thanks.
---
People do it because it‚Äôs good passive income and semi afk for a lot of tasks. It also trains all 5 combat stats (and hp I guess) while lvling slayer skill at the same time. It‚Äôs not bad once you are able to cannon and burst tasks for good xp/hr
---
Originally I thought the join button would do that, it doesn't.
---
I mean it isn't *that* hard to swallow. I would like one but also I've been content with the rate at which they've been adding other content so I'm never bored.
---
I'm guessing it'll be around 1/500. At big gamer efficient rates and with the price of the blade at 150M, that's 3m gp/hr with the blade alone. They're definitely going to change the blade to make its upkeep worth using and the value of the blade will increase in turn. It all depends on an unconfirmed drop rate, but the team are fairly consistent with drop rates and 50-75 hours for the blade is probably all it'll take to get the blade. There are two points to this post as well. We don't need another great gp/hr and great uniques boss. If anything Vorkath and zulrah need a tune down. We also certainly don't need gauntlet to be made any easier after the most recent patch.
---
&gt; People need to get payed for what they do for a living regardless of what it is

LOL reddit in a nutshell
---
He's counting shard prices as they relate to Divine potions. Those prices aren't sustainable. But I agree with his increase of shard/swing count, it's stupid low at the moment
---
When you cast bones to peaches without any bones in your inventory
---
Never said it did
---
Yeah no problem, i just really enjoy doing clues so it's nice to not only lose money probably
---
Vorkath is doable with BP and elite void+salve; however, you take more dmg, spend more on scales darts, and have to bank more frequently. Overall less effective, but still 3m an hour if you have rune darts rig and 92+ rng. As for zulrah... learn one rotation , and if it doesn't do that rotation at the start hop world's and try again. Hopping puts you back on the dock to reset the kill, and can help greatly. Additionally just learn money snake if you cba doing pest control for elite void rn, but I highly suggest grinding it out for raids, corp, vork, and other high level pvm
---
I thought he just had 1 mouse in each hand and foot for this
---
Loot is wayy better in smaller teams (4-6) than in masses. I get average 200k per kill in small teams and 50k in masses.

---
I got 1 in 2258 kills took me 600 hours rip
---
Every time I pk I expect to lose money. For every sotd or AGS I pk I die enough times that I'm not really profiting, just making back some of my losses. PKing is not a consistent or practical way to make profit unless you're ditterbitter or mmc. It's very hard to come out on top. Technically I could make money if I was just ragging pvmers in salad or mystic all day, but that isn't really fun.

Edit: Kinda off topic but goddamn I wish ahrims sets would crash. Ahrims is bare minimum to actually land barrages on mains. 1m ahrims set would be a wet dream. Cheaper return sets FR

Hi everyone! Longtime Runescape player, first time poster here. 
---
I'm currently working on a project for a class at my university and I need to develop a model for a set of data of my choosing. I'm looking to build a model for xp rates for Barbarian Fishing since this is the most common method of training fishing and the xp rates increase with level. The goal is to create a model that accurately represents the xp rates of Barbarian Fishing for the average player (so please only provide non-tick manipulation rates). Hopefully with this model I can develop a tool for people to use to determine an accurate time to achieve their fishing goals by inputting their current fishing xp and their goal level. 
---
Thanks for all of your help!
---
Ah I gotcha. The contradictory wiki pages are really confusing me now. Do you remember what the most you were getting hit from those attacks while praying mage were? The clips in the vid I think you tank all 0s which can happen often even without praying so no evidence either way from those specifically.
---
Cheap af? Not all people buy gold, some people play the game as it was meant to be played.
---
Don't spend too much time on this account you just bought, because it will get recovered and you will lose all the stuff you put on it. You are gonna be posting in 5 months how you got hacked out of nowhere through auth and it is jagex's fault. I'm telling you now, it's your fault.

They made it so the more damage you do, the more loot you get. Since you can do damage in smaller teams, you get more loot.

---
Someone in my clan said I might have gotten hacked overnight and they tried to RWT my bank. It's only worth around 70m though so idk
---
It has elite clues and they're fairly regular. Wouldn't be against another item being added either. But the blades price will change when it's made to be worth using. Some reason the jmods thought 1 shard = 25 swings was worth while with shards/hr being like 30.
---
What are you talking about? Suffering is only defensive, it is way worse than either arch or bers at demonics.
---
Thanks for clarifying!!
---
Shards are included in the realistic estimate of 1.5m~ /hr. He's just straight up out to lunch with 4-5m/hr.
---
Selling the accounts lmao. I never used them personally.
---
If u really want to, all bosses except Vorkath are possible on a pure.
---
Venenatis with craw's bow is very decent money (look up Synq's guide). All slayer bosses are doable if u have the required lvl and task. Giant Mole and KBD are ez and can net u a decent income. All bosses in osrs have a pet drop, so if u want to collect those there's plenty of grinds awaiting u. Good luck!

damn my bad

I did something similar 3 years ago on DXP (rs3) I reconnected with someone I hadn't talked to in a very long time. Felt great.

you should get base 60s in your melee stats and magic before you start bossing
---
Mmmm I think it could happen eventually. Warding was kinda meh, and it still got 66%. I could easily see that boosted to 75% with a better skill. I think the number of people who never want a new skill is definitely lower than 25%, people just didn't like warding.

Well, the thing is, Settleds vid got 400k views, so he SHOULD make a decent amount off it, I think he shouldve focused on that rather than the fact that it took him so long.

make an ironman that's what that mode is for

Did not inquire
---
Thank you for weighing in! What ranged level are you getting that time with? I'm going to be getting elite void before going at it, and pretty much my plan is do it until I can afford to train for ornate pool anyways.
---
It breaks at the very low levels, but yes very neat.
---
Kinda impossible since ironman exists.
---
Didn't ask
---
Imo rune cb and broad bolts is more cost-effective if you're hurting for gp
---
It doesn't
---
Anyone have a Gauntlet guide for dummies? This shit is stupid hard.
---
They usually fix those small annoyance too(like how they're redesigning that rune armour in your example)
---
Yeah gotta do that PC grind but the minigame is so annoying. If I could fix one thing it would be to take away portal shields, sitting around waiting for them to drop is the worst part.
---
plz dont cry, the agility course needed to be buffed.
---
Pretty sure I hold the record for worst bank at my level. Level 90 combat with my most expensive item being a saradomin sword and a 200k cash stack.
---
E: All of the above
---
or better yet, make them more expensive and have a portion of proceeds go the Jagex execs bonuses!
---
I dont think this is the way to go just because someone is scared to have a little risk or doesn't like an area of the map. Especially when its all through their own decision.
---
If you dont like the wilderness then thats **you're** decision to not go and **youre** locking yourself out of the content by **your** own choice.
---
Its like saying i dont like Killing shamans because theyre annoying. so add the DWH on a low drop rate to  something somewhere else.
---
I'm more of an imperial fist man myself

I thought corrupted was 25 through prayer. Normal mode used to be 20 max through prayer
---
Take your glorified cheat client and shove it into the depths of your crusty asshole, kyle.
---
Would be kind of neat if they didnt all look the same.  More varied dungeons, Lava theme, forest theme, other stuff like that.
---
You can buy runes from npcs or GE. You can't  pay to access a shortcut. Closest to that is paying a Venezuelan to train your agility.
---
From what I understand, this means there's just one ongoing thread about osrs usually kept alive? That doesn't seem particularly good for structured discussion, seems more like one long rambling mess about the game.

---
second poll; 86.5+8.7=95.2+5%=100.2% again.  
---
Rigged polls confirmed, REEEEEEEE
---
I‚Äôm not exactly sure what OP is proposing but if it happens for a lot of high level items that wouldn‚Äôt change? If everything can break potentially but very rarely at the same risk of breaking. 1/2000 is rarer than the drop rate of the rare item so there would be a net incoming of unqiues into the game so prices shouldn‚Äôt change too much for the boss uniques just for uniques which already have an almost endless supply (blowpipe or whip)
---
So prices would be relatively steady just have a higher floor. Not to mention it‚Äôs rare as fuck if OPs idea is what it would be. 100 hours of actual use on one item isn‚Äôt going to happen very often for most things, I‚Äôd suggest that is made smaller. Same with 1/2000, stuff would rarely break but when it does it‚Äôs annoying
---
Ground items are huge too, the mobile long tap is sooooo laggy and you basically have to check every loot pile with it
---
Ban.
---
If you have only been playing osrs for 2 months you aren't going to be knowledgeable at all.
---
I  am completely indifferent to the xp rate of it being buffed. Main point is jagex shouldn't be allowed to run a poll for that only 1 day
---
Yeah but getting 77 takes like 50 hours
---
&gt;on a farm
---
Something's fucky
---
Summoning was broken and will never be passed to OSRS. Lots of familiars that basically made it so you could stay at Bandos or any boss for an extremely long time without having to bank. Dungeoneering won't pass for not being old-school, not unique to OSRS in any way, and wouldn't offer any rewards to OSRS. In RS3, Dungeoneering was mainly done for its T-80 weapons.
---
Masochistic you mean?

How much it cost ya? Usually around $45ish?

Curious, thanks to zolacano for money, or for affecting prices?

Downvoted
---
This was the only problem i had with dungeoneering. 120 was the last thing i needed for comp, and i ended up paying to "leech" my last few floors once i got to 115+ because there was never anyone making random teams with that level
---
Lol that wasn‚Äôt the justification the justification was needing an actual item sink and risk for high level items
---
And I mean no shit there‚Äôs some magic involved in RuneScape but that‚Äôs when it pertains to the PLAYER not random items
---
Dude seriously?
---
You know he was being metaphorical with the use of the word "broken" but you're purposely taking it literally for the sake of arguing...

he probably means educated as in having degrees, not saying he is dumb

Thanks for your valuable input

Runelite plus makes blackjacking pretty afk

Interesting, sounds like the cats outta the bag boys. If you got hacked and your gear RWT‚Äôd, you would know about it. My moneys on a RWT ban because of OPs actions.
---
Why though
---
&gt;Also why doesn't anyone suggest summoning???
---
Summoning literally broke the game, BoB and adding a 4th column to the combat triangle (combat square?) really messed with a lot of things, new content had to be balanced around it and old content became much easier because it wasn't balanced around it. Summonning was kinda fun but not healthy for the game in the long term.
---
You're welcome üòä
---
-Dr Evil
---
yay as a minigame. just make a strawpoll
---
That goes for basically all skilling. Everyone pvms -&gt; pvm gets new content -&gt; pvm gets better -&gt; everyone pvms is the cycle the game is stuck in and until we start getting some actual focus on skills instead of lazy bandaid updates this game will stay pvmscape.
---
Oh I just looked it up, i didn't realize it's a game lol.  It looks like its only called that in Britian.  I thought he was saying chinese people are telling lies about RL+
---
Being able to see items that are on the ground would be pretty nice for mobile
---
The long tap is super laggy so having to long tap every little drop is very very painful.
---
Game shouldn‚Äôt be based around iron men but I guess it would need a rework to make it a bit more fair for them
---
Did the main make it out?
---
Ah, I see you hate yourself as well.

For real congrats tho lol

How would I know about it? I can't log in

There's a lot of sarcasm that I'm guessing you aren't seeing
---
What does your title for this submission have to do with the content in the video?
---
Are you suggesting that his opinion and the way he goes about it makes him not eligible for an award based on the content he created?
---
Game balance aside, this suggestion would annoying af, because 
---
&gt;Not sure if this would be implemented in terms of RNG (1/2000 chance your items breaks every time you use it after X amount of use)
---
Is just retarded, I shouldn't need to explain why, just imagine it happening. Having literally every tradeable item degrade would be annoying af too. Just imagine having to check all your switches everytime you go PvM lol.
---
Yah that's one way, think people would hate it though. You send me back to the fishing trawler and I'll be mad lol. It'd be cool to have more incentive to play CW and stuff though.
---
Tbh, the old model should have stayed.
---
RS models are supposed to look like our characters. Most NPCs ingame look like they could be made with the character creation template, but the new one didnt, even the compromise doesnt.
---
I still have two guys I used to chat with all the time waaaay back in 06-07 on my friends list, who are still using their OG usernames and actually seem to play OSRS a fair bit (or at least did at one point, both are just under 2000 total lvl). However, I'm not using my original username and they both keep their private chats off public permanently, so unfortunately I'll probably never reconnect with them.
---
26k is not an appropriate sample size?
---
For telling people to not be cunts? Okay cunt, lol.
---
But 1 it is viable to not barrage the task, 2 you can get a reasonable amount of deaths from other sources to make the rc grind feasible. According to wiki abyss runecrafting is 3k essence an hour. Sure compared to buying from shops which is 1k a minute it's well 1/20th the rate but that doesn't it isn't viable for people to rc some instead of just buying.
---
DG was the best SKILL in the game. Was fun and was fast. My first 200m exp in rs3.
---
The wiki still lists like 35k per shard, but the prices are entirely wrong. Each shard is worth about 20k if you have 97 herb or can boost to 97, and only 10k if you have less than that.

I got inspired to try barrows with only a level 58 defense by watching Swampletics.  I was like, yeah I could do a few 4 kill chests and get used to it.  He used this kiting method around the crypts to kill the brothers without them hitting him.
---
Turns out theres an actual way to do that.  I panicked on Dharock because he kept hitting me each time i would walk out and cast a spell.   Ended up using over half my food and all but 10 prayer. 
---
Went to claim the chest and went back to making glass.  I got 230gp from the chest though.  Learned a lot that day.

I meant it that you spend hundreds of hours to make money on the side

Damn dude why do you take so much offense from people just giving you advice?

The fact is you put

Thousands of hours into the game, but can't justify $100 on a laptop.

You can play how you want bro, but there's no reason to take so much offense when people are being totally respectful.

It's perfectly understandable why people are confused at your logic.

If I did something for 9 hours a day, paying 100$ to make it way more enjoyable would be a no-brainer, but you do you...

Hey man. I got the same ban about a year ago. I appealed via Jagex's channels by opening a ticket, even though it was an unappealable offense. I was unbanned on the next business day. It turned out my account was hacked and had been used as a Zulrah bot. Upon getting unbanned I had a +300m bank value in a Zulrah tab. Good luck bro. I suggest you make a ticket if you want a quick reply.

Another thing I wanted to try was getting chaos gauntlets with lv 53 magic on an Obby Mauler with lowish hp.
---
I'm thinking something like lv 53 ranged / mage, 1 or 2 att, and as high of a str lv you can get without raising combat, probably around lv 75.
---
You could farcast a firebolt, hitting up to 24 with tome, chaos gaunts, and occult, and run in and stack a maul hit hitting up to around 34.
---
yeah but you need herbs for that, as an ironman that's not the easiest to come by, still energy pots don't give access to shrotcuts
---
Except rs has the most whales (big donators) and the amount of subs per average viewer count is stupidly high compared to other games. Sick nerf was donated 70k by one person a couple months ago, do you think that‚Äôs common for other games for streamers with 1k subs. Also, rs has by far the most full time streamers for a game that averages such low view count.
---
That could be the case

Always finding something to cry about.

Can someone link the original post that this guy shamelessly stole from?
---
Big ol' downvote from me
---
Where did I argue that its better dps?  It's not.  But it's definitely not 15k, and definitely not "2-3 times slower".  You're moving the goal post, and also don't take into account that rune arrows cost over 4 times as much as broad bolts

Rigendeaux has over 23k in each DK

How about this:

Just sell all your gear, start with some basic pvm gear and acquire further gear yourself through bosses. Limit your GE usage to supplies and resources only. Hunt for things on the collection log and don't care about efficiency.

This. As a skill, it did not make much sense in the realm of what runescape classifies a skill as. But as a minigame, my god it was arguably the best minigame ever added to runescape. A lot of diversity in it, had beautiful looking floors, unique mechanics and bosses, and just an overall fun vibe. The only fuck up in it were the rewards and they were not super hard to obtain and they were op asf.
---
The trick answer is C but we all know it's D
---
In the attack style menu the first option will grant attack xp, the second and third will grant strength and the last option will grant defense and strength
---
Click the crossed swords in the toolbar and use the first attack option on most weapons, instead of the second option.
---
The hell you on about?
---
zulrah is also slightly like that
---
I think one of the best bosses is still Jad. Yeah he's old but there was and still is some genuine fear of not reacting quick enough with your prayer switches and then panic brewing and fucking up another switch.
---
How did they convince you to do it ?
---
about 300 kc each and got rex jr. worst one imo but still love it since it is my first boss pet
---
I think the bond prices only dropped to 3m because of the influx of players from mobile release buying so many to get gear. Now most of us are competing for fewer bonds. I could easily imagine a 7m bond.
---
Oh man that's great news, those things  are the only reason I didn't like the other puzzle, they are super stressful. Thanks.
---
Its quite a bit faster
---
Rune arrows : 79gp
---
Broad Bolts  :59gp
---
I'm not wasting my time doing the math for cost per hour to use each set but both answers will be so small that the cost difference will be negligible.
---
It's also chill af. Sorry you don't enjoy it
---
*Everyone disliked that*
---
You seem angry little man
---
This happened to me but my account was hacked through authenticator and then banned for RWT as an ironman. Twitter support for jagex said make a new account to keep playing because RWT cannot be appealed. This was a few weeks ago and all of it happened within a 5 day period.
---
Bye bye 3 years of gameplay on an ironman. 
---
I hope your situation goes better than mine as I just gave up and quit. Jagex really need a better customer support system.
---
Idk guys I really don‚Äôt like runecrafting. Then again I probably won‚Äôt get better after 77, option c it is.
---
The kitchen knife out of the culinaromancer's chest wouldn't be too bad either.
---
All right, let's go through it all!
---
The forced camera perspective is reminiscent of the Pinball random event where the entire gameplay design of it was that you can't easily keep track of where you are. Of course, Jagex changed this but in the original iteration, it existed to make the random more reactive. This is similar.
---
Reactive obstacles and courses also exist in oldschool. The Agility pyramid requires you to know when to move because of those shifting sand blocks that will push you off if you mistime the run. Likewise, the Brimhaven agility arena effectively randomizes agility and causes you to constantly replot, react to failing, and adapt. 
---
Firing stationary weapons is already part of oldschool Runescape in a few minigames. You see it at Castle Wars with the catapults. Or trebuchets. Funny word, trebuchet... Anyways, stationary siege weaponry being used to hurt people is fine.
---
At the end of the day, every mechanic in this is oldschool in some way. It's just combining a bunch of mechanics.
---
I did but they dont say shit
---
this
---
Went to train at chaos altar the other day. Came prepared for your run of the mill salad rober. In case of a PKer appearing, I had minimal risk with few bones, intending to finish the inventory then dying for the free tele to the bank.
---
One of these, as you call them, john wicks maxed dude appears and starts ranging me. "It's ok", I think, since I have like 10 bones left so I turn on my pray. I don't know how the fuck he killed me so fast. Didn't even have a look at wtf he specced me with. Needless to say I didn't have a chance to offer one more bone after he came up.
---
Prices, bought them all at 2005 a piece.
---
Big deal, I have ass naps all the time
---
Is it really a scam if you right click on your  most expensive items and press the drop button?
---
im no expert but i dont believe the stats suggest that it has. In regards to pking theres always action at rev cave entrance/chins, and w65 chins is unique. Low level chin hunters are constantly training there, and low level pkers often go to try and take them out with dbows, which in turn attracts bigger fish, and even bigger fish hunting those pkers. Theres always someone there to fight.
---
90 slayer not even a dust staff yet.
---
You can‚Äôt stand still or else the timer doesn‚Äôt go down. You can escape a pker there tho
---
You're describing how pures level lol. Mains do a lot more variety.
---

where's the lube?

Dinosaur boss/monster expansion on an area accessed through fossil island (time travel boat/machine) or a 'journey to the center of the earth' type deal
---
I got an automated message saying they wouldn't look into it, and that future attempts would immediately be denied, but hopefully an actual person will look into it
---
The precise floor requirements issue was fixed, any floor of the correct type will count towards completion of an uncompleted floor of that type that you have access to. So if you have completed floor 34 but not 33 and you do 34 again it'll tick off and give the xp for floor 33. The downside to this is that you get the lower xp if you did floor 34 to tick off say floor 40.

Real unpopular opinion: A

diamond wins
---
It‚Äôs another streaming platform. Originally was called Beam, owned by Microsoft. It‚Äôs been around for a few years. 
---
It‚Äôs in the news today because Ninja, the fortnite streamer, announced that he‚Äôll be exclusively streaming on Mixer.
---
I get it, I'm just in a frustrating situation and people constantly saying I'm going to get smacked down is getting kind of annoying. I just want to be able to play the game I love without completely starting over again
---
Repost alert
---
Wow his beard really grew
---
Agility is the simplest I can think of
---
a pker of focus, commitment,  sheer will....something we clue scrollers know very little about.  i once saw a wick pker kill 3 pures in mage arena....with a $11... a fucking $11...
---
Unpopular opinion: the vanilla client is perfectly fine for new players.
---
UI scaling is definitely needed and GPU would be very nice, sure. I'll give you that. That said...
---
New players don't need boost timers. New players don't need words popping up on the floor telling them what they got. New players don't need to know how much experience they're getting per hour, or what the price of some random item is, or the KC someone got their Skotizo pet.  They don't need to know how many cannonballs are in their cannon, or where to dig for clue scrolls, or where to fucking click on an agility course.
---
And don't tell a new player to just turn all those things off if they're getting in the way. They're a new player, they have no idea what they're turning off in the first place.
---
The current UI is good because it's simple. It's a simple UI with simple options for a simple game.
---
If you want an example of an absolutely shitass nightmare clusterfucking shitstorming diarrhetic mess of too many god damn options upon options upon options within fucking tabs full of god damn options, just look at Runescape 3. If you're a new player in Runescape 3 and you just finished taking a shit on their discount tutorial island Ashdale pile of shit in their ocean, you're gonna have a bad time. There's like 500 million different options for loot highlights based on where you're getting the loot, a million different chat options, a little thing that says, "OH I WANT TO SEE HOW MANY SLAYER CREATURES I GOT LEFT DURRR" and all that fucking discount elevator jazz.
---
I mean, what happened to the good old days when we took a slayer gem with us because we wanted to see how many more scorpions Turael wanted us to kill? That was a good part of being a noob.
---
 if you call it every kill you'll eventually be right
---
there's no category for oldschool runescape, also can i use obs to stream? how's it any different than twitch and why would anyone else use it
---
I think they would have to redo the rewards for two reasons - chaotics would probably not pass a poll and they have already distributed some of the rewards through other methods.
---
Did you shit yourself
---
Sounds like when you turn 16 you need someone to teach you that the real world doesn't screw around.
---
You say that, but a brew at 68hp only heals 12 (17.6% hp) instead of 16 at 99hp (16.2%). It's really not that big of a deal UNLESS one's using blood spells, where it makes a huge difference and I absolutely agree.
---

I‚Äôd say sometimes, but not always.
---
stonks
---
let alone an amulet lol
---
They all went after your main like some hungry wolves that hadn't eaten in a week lmfao
---
For Zalcano 'more effort' should be gathering an appropriate amount of rocks and participating for 100% of the kill. Not bringing swamp tar and a fucking guam, two things entirely unrelated to the boss. 
---
Imagine if you didn't get any loot at wintertodt unless you fletched darts and magic imbued while running between the brazier and roots
---
Not irrational. 11/11 should die painfully
---
U stole my friends post
---
Good lord this is kinda disheartening lmao. Never gonna stop tho
---
Salty pker detected, I enjoy pking but baby rage comments like this are so hilarious, imagine being so salty that you type this out
---
For me it was age of mythology spamming junk food night and trojan horse for sale
---
If that is the case then Jagex should be able to see that plaintext, the digital trail from the offenders network session, trading an account it‚Äôs never interacted with before, the evidence should obvious, makes me all the more curious
---
Yea at first I thought he was just fucking with people but after I saw a few more pop up I figured it was others doing it.
---
do you have to do song of elves quest first?
---
Dang always missing the 99 partys :(

remember opening one of this guys streams recently and let me tell you, what a fucking gamer. His opening intro was just this fast paced trance music and it cuts into him doing 1tick 6 way gear swaps and fakies in this tribridding fight. He literally destroyed this guy so hard and dropped him for max gear it was fantastic quality and skill. I dropped a follow and subscribed with my twitch prime. Just on the side of this pking screen, he had another account doing 3tick 5g mining in the quarry. His next stream that I caught, he was completing a solo ToB and it was like the 5th in a row he had done. This guy is a fucking gamer and probably the most versatile and experienced player in Oldschool aside from Woox. He's top tier in skilling, PvP and PvM. What a fucking gamer

Lop you think the only social part of osrs is whats wrong with pvp.. ok maybe go try make some friends
---
!Remindme 1 day
---
Nice build
---
It's all clearly explained in the wiki
---
That's what I think should be the case, but I've had several people tell me that they got perm banned after being hacked and they managed to get it fixed. Hopefully it'll be the same for me, but I'm not optimistic
---
I think that the people that happened to be logged in that day (random), were aware of the vote (active reader), and cared enough to vote (motivated), is the profile of all the voters for all polls with the exception of the really big ones.  The only difference here is that less people logged in that day because there were less days available.  All we should lose is volume.

The inquisition has not begun.

Oh come on! Everyone knows the Armstrong family has had 99 rc for GENERATIONS!
---
Yeah ive got friends and we 2-5 man pk. There friends, not clan numbers like ures are they aint ur friends
---
As somebody who‚Äôs always used Mixer over Twitch (not for osrs, but other games in general) I can tell you there is a category for osrs, and there are a couple of streamers already there. TheHillionaire is one as well as Loki_The_Smokey.  I can‚Äôt wait for more people to jump on over... Mixer is a high quality platform and has a helpful support staff. Only good things can come from this!
---
That is indeed a good example where mobile is good. Worth noting you can do the same on PC with mouse keys.
---
I like to train rc, agility, &amp; theiving without the graceful set

Didnt know there was a poop green phat

... settle down bro. My crew is quite small atm. We are all extremly close from spending many ours in voice calls and working as a team. I value these friends just as much my irl ones.
