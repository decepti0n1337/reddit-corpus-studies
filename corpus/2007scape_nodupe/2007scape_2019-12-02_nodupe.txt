Read my other reply

They don‚Äôt benefit you at all. Just do them if you want the cosmetics otherwise don‚Äôt bother with hem
---
Just wait til Sea Shanty 3 comes out
---
I mean who is Georgia
---
Okay?
---
It would respawn in a different part of the same zone...and there would be over a hundred resources per region its not like those terrible quests where you have to search 50 bushes to find one item.
---
D med + d chain combo is always so fresh
---
Not sure, I don't play it. I just figured people enjoyed it outside of the tournament because of pvp, it seemed to me the leagues was just the same thing, xp multiplier but without the pvp and you compete for xp. But I've played nethier modes. If I'm wrong I guess I'll be enlightened
---
I'm addicted af. I usually play from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. Maybe a hour or two break. I just don't care to be honest. My life is depressing and I'm depressed.
---
(I saw someone mention it happened on f2p, but even then..)
---

---
It would make zero sense to dupe with Ely. Say you dupe 1b, and lose the Ely, you've made 400-200m or so. All you need to do is spend a bit of time and gp on figuring out what better item to use to make each dupe worth 700m more.
---
Remove wildy and make battlegrounds. 
---
Lol aka give me all the wildy content without risk and put the already dead pvp into a matchmaking system that will be doa
---
No
---
I remember getting pulled at the ge and going along with it because I had nothing better to do.
---
I also forgot about the 10m I had in my inventory because I was trading. Years of experienced reduced to getting owned because I‚Äôm a shitbag who didn‚Äôt put the money away before going for a scam.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
There's a prototype in the works at the moment. Probably expected to come out early 2020.
---
I would really like to do the skilling XP rates thing, but unfortunately a lot of it is based on data we don't have. We might be able to pester the relevant people or crowdsource it enough, but skilling success rates can be kind of a nightmare (for example, every &lt;tree, axe&gt; combo has a separate interpolation for success rate between 1 and 99).
---
If I still played this game I would be outraged. The duel arena was the best part.
---
You‚Äôre spawning a lot of shitty memes
---
Updoots for you
---
It was my favourite skill back in the day but it's too overpowered so I wouldn't like it to come back.
---
Peak addiction
---
Why would it be doa? If they removed the wilderness and gave a ton of PvP alternatives with amazing rewards, why wouldn't people who PvP in the wilderness now play those alternatives?
---
&gt;give me all the wildy content without risk
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm arguing. When I played WoW I loved both PvP and PvM, because I didn't need to risk hours worth of work every time I wanted to PvP. I just hopped into an arena with a friend and had a blast; if we won then I got to upgrade my PvP gear and moved up in rank and it felt awesome, and if I lost then no harm done. In this game I'm not touching wilderness PvP with a 10 foot pole because I don't play anywhere near enough to want to risk losing a ton of gp if I lose. I played LMS though and had  a blast because I could PvP without that risk. Why do you think risk is necessary for PvP to be any good?
---
RS3 MTX makes insane profits, saw a post that said it was more than half for them. If RS3 does die there's no sacrificial lamb for MTX anymore.

It should be included in some sorts in the prototype dps calculator in the work. Bear in mind that any non-standard attack from a monster is essentially individually hardcoded, which can lead to many special quirks that may not be accounted for in any general calculator, especially because it's impractical to ask jmods about every exception or to even know where all the exceptions are.
---
Fair enough üëç
---
Clearly he rock caked a 99
---
Grats. What's with the inventory though? I thought at first it was some drops from your journey to 99, but Robinhood hats are indeed not from Slayer lol.
---
thank you for the detailed and helpful reply! while I like the idea of ironman, I don't feel like I would fully appreciate it and be able to excel at it as a brand nee player. I feel like I should start a normal account first so that I can learn the ins and out of the game and then dive into ironman whenever I feel ready. I think I would fully appreciate it then
---
Really cool! Are you planning to keep to post updates as the league continues?
---
It's still around and people still play it. It's not as popular as osrs though.
---
i'm totally on board!
---
I do birdhouses. They're pretty darn quick if a bit annoying, but there's no compelling reason not to.
---
&gt; gave a ton of PvP alternatives with amazing rewards

lol

you mean runescape classic? it was shut down last year because not enough people played it to justify jagex keeping the servers alive

r/runescape
---
05-07 was far from the "golden era" Did you even play from 07-12?
---
everything I'm hearing is getting me really excited about starting! going to try and dive right in
---
Not yet. I have the requirements, just haven't sat through it.
---
Idk if that means you think the username is good or you hate it so bad you would pay me to change it.
---
I'm maxed and this is about the same gear I train with
---
Legally they don‚Äôt have to pay anyone/entity to fork the project and have an official copy/modified version of the runelite client for download on their website
---
ok sure
---
Isn't the whole point of playing video games to have fun though? Not gonna lie, going back to walking does not sound like fun to me anymore. I probably will stop playing once Twisted drops, but I'd never want any of that shit in the main game that other people clearly still enjoy. A Twisted world seems like a nice compromise?
---
Ok well at 40att 50str is rune scim/2h viable or should u always goto 60str before pking Like that
---
How can I fume over something that wasn‚Äôt said? If you called me a nonce because I‚Äôm fuming over it, you would‚Äôve somehow had to say it before that. Use your brain and connect any logic buddy. 
---
&gt;	You‚Äôre typing paragraphs cause someone you‚Äôve never met or spoken to called you a nonce on an internet forum. Let that sink in for a minute or two then come back lmao. Nonce.
---
You‚Äôre.. literally doing the same thing lol.. the irony is insane. You‚Äôre legit brain dead man. You sound like a 4 year old repeating a word you just learned and don‚Äôt know the meaning of it lmao.
---
Also ‚Äúfuming over it‚Äù, you mean pointing out the hypocrisy in your own replies yet you‚Äôre literally too stupid to understand it? Good job, hope your mom is gonna carry you through life
---
Stonks
---
Fair, suppose the client itself is free anyway so that wouldn't be a problem
---
If this is how the playerbase feels about it jagex should definitely go for it

No it isn't. A phone may be. But not internet.

Here I am 17m Dry.

Oh no uncle please stop

Is there a friends chat for collectors? Im looking to sell some crushed gems and burnt food

I just started my defender grind today! Wish me luck on that hell.... but ive had my fury, prossy, torso and black mask until i unlock slayer helm! But i have been using slaughter or exped bracelets instead of my barrow gloves!

I don't think you understand how strong augury would be if it had the equivalent damage boost that rigour and piety enjoy for their styles. It really would be nuts, but a lot better for magic overall as a DPS buff rework than the new staves will be. To make those staves good for their auto attacks, you need the tome, but since they're not a trident and you can't wield a tome of fire, their only valuable addition is as a mage special attack weapon. The new tome will probably be more expensive than the staff and way more useful because it buffs all magic. Still the new volatile staff is going to be interesting, but I feel augury should be changed before the staff comes out rather than after it at any point
---
Probably the rounded healthbars and the prayer bar
---
It‚Äôs a race for a higher total League Points. There are tasks throughout Zeah, some skill based, some task based. A large chunk of points comes from raids (obtain pet, a unique item, solo raids, challenge mode, so on). You also get points for doing certain amounts of raids (1, 10, 25, 100, 200, so on). So a lot of people plan on raiding. 
---
It‚Äôs also sort of fun. Some of the perks make it more interesting.
---
gotbulks or got bulks or something along those lines
---
You got banned, what an analysis are you expecting? Who knows what happened to an inactive account.
---
The whole point of F2P is to not be a drain on dev resources (time and money), while being a nostalgic trial period for old players and a get to know the basics for new players. For the Oldschool purists, it remains largely untouched apart from a few staggeringly different changes to meta grinds that shouldn't be encouraged further.
---
If its a fresh account, Just make a new one.
---
I can't see why it would be banned if it wasn't in use.
---
lol what you clicked green and then didnt bother to change from it? xd
---
And just over the grassy knoll, sat the true PKer with his Twisted Bow

Im still just trying to get a rune scim in league... almost level 80 magic EXCLUSIVELY through fire striking...
---
By the way, while Yews are Tier 5 wood in OSRS, they are Tier 1 in Fable/TLC/Anniversary with Yew Longbows (starter bow in Fable) having damage power of 60 and no augment slots. lol But Oaks are Tier 2 in both games. After that, in Fable, comes Ebony, then Master.
---
So, which piece of fine wood is the stronger wood?
---
I've been playing a lot of Fable Anniversary a lot lately and just finished the game as a good hero and an evil hero.
---
do you use the dagger as your main weapon?
---
Uninstall and reinstall the client
---
No, luck is better,

Expected xp/hour for 5 tick barb fishing! There‚Äôs a graph on the wiki but no formula given to how that graph was made.

i got 99 fletching as my first 99 too,  how long did it take you?
---
Dam mr detective you ask some hard questions, except it seems in his post he states some info that may have answered your questions for you, he says He started osrs thinking this is a game he can finally get into and enjoy with friends, perhaps his friends told him about the GE, and he was curious so went to check it out. Then he also states a players name and that they were so kind to give him a few million gp cause he felt generous, perhaps that‚Äôs how he had money to do anything at the GE, so quit being so nosey and mind your own dam business.
---
did you just do use magic long bows? im at 94 rn, and wanna finnish it out eventually
---
Not louder than Marlyin Monroe.

You do pray melee yeah?
---
Oh I‚Äôve got all those hours just on osrs, my rs3 account I don‚Äôt play anymore
---
After looking at master clues, these will really help me to commit to a random skill, exactly what I need!
---
Supplies calculator. There are plenty of "your can make x gp/hr at y boss" but a lot don't account for or at least track the food/pray pots/etc. 
---
This may take some work or some surveying but it'd be amazing to get an idea how many pray pots and food to get to camp x boss for y hours. Or at least a general ratio of supplies. 
---
Also easier to calculate: pray duration calculator. Input gear/pray bonus, output how long you can protect from melee/protect + preserve/protect + piety/etc will last. Add how many pray pots you have and how long that would add. To expand further, how many pray pots do you need to last x minutes/hours.
---
I think soft cap isn't really the right word to use here, but rather just deminishing return kicking in. Here's the value of +5 magic accuracy at different thresholds according to bitterkoekje's DPS calculator based on an enemy with 0 magic defense, as discussed in the example above.
---
0 = 0.31%
---
15 = 0.2%
---
30 = 0.15%
---
49 = 0.11%
---
65 = 0.08%
---
80 = 0.06%
---
106 = 0.04%
---
121 = 0.03%
---
143 = 0.02%
---
&gt;This lol always blows my mind how many people do this in game thinking they're really smart for it.
---
But are you going to be working any of that extra time to make back that time you "saved" from not buying with in-game gold? 
---
I'm saving my $11 a month rather than spending it on osrs because I know for a fact I won't work any extra time and I actually enjoy playing the game. 
---
You can compare it to minimum wage or whatever you want. But if you're spending money and not making it back from actually doing that minimum wage / whatever, you're still spending money. 
---
Blows my mind that people don't realize that spending money is still spending money
---
Also bonds are so ridiculously cheap for any decent mid to end-game player who isn't a staking addict. It doesn't make sense to buy membership with irl money.
---
Didn't know that because I play alone. Not an Ironman btw, just lonely.
---
It's not even that they're merchers, they might just have a collection of them. People collect weird stuff.
---
Thought he was talking to someone else. But no, I don‚Äôt remember anyone in osrs ever standing in varrock square
---
How long getting a skill level will take doing X activity with Y efficiency.
---
Most of the exp rates on the wiki say "up to XXXXXX exp per hour" as in you're shitting your pants sweating for 60 minutes without missing a single tick of efficiency to get this rate, which is a bit unrealistic for the average player. What about when I'm watching netflix and I'm casually harpooning sharks or something?

They've got a 13k buy limit, it would only take a day and change to get 100k of each. There's not anywhere you could get them faster, at least not that I know of.
---
Rekordbox, I prefer it over Serato
---
You've played roughly 5 hours a day since OSRS was released. You're now free to go outside.
---
It was a joke. Torags used  to rag people because of it's high defense and it's lame attack.
---
Gz, also fuck you
---
But can we see the poster?
---
I feel that's an equal take!
---
Haha trust me... I didn't like it.. But, had to be real.
---
I picked up OSRS because I wanted to play a game where I felt my progression was meaningful and not lost due to a ladder reset or patch coming out. 
---
I spent years of playing Diablo 2 in middle school and Phantasy Star Online 2 during my early college years. I felt extremely rushed to get to end game in the season or patches. The moment something new comes out, all my progress would go out the window and I felt I didn‚Äôt really gain much out of it. 
---
I used to play Runescape 2 in 2004 when I was in elementary school then lost interest years later. My friend introduced me to OSRS (when I thought only RS3 existed) and it was a breath of fresh air. I was able to play a little bit when I was busy, or when I was free I could grind it out and chill with friends. If I ever felt burnt out, I would take a break for three-four months then come back and continue where I left off. 
---
It‚Äôs a great game; I really like it and playing it many years later (compared to when I was in elementary school), it made me realize there‚Äôs so much content to explore.
---
if you sweat it out bursting or something i guess thats true
---
...what?

Lmfao these people remind me how pathetic this subreddit is.

You gotta watch a tutorial of how to get google play store on it. Amazon has its own weird store and OSRS isn‚Äôt on it. It‚Äôs possible to get it though I‚Äôve done it.
---
Thanks bud
---
What lvl are you?
---
Well at least the discounts are still accurate, if not underselling, even if the numbers don't add up. I think the issue might be that the crossed-out prices are the rate before discount, but there are two discounts. If you take 3 months at $11 then take 8% off, it does come just over $30, which is what the crossed-out 3 month price is. But the $11 price isn't what is being used at the moment since the one month price is reduced to $9.50.
---
So it is saying 3 months at $9.50 with 8% off is $26 (bit over and they round down). Both prices are 8% off, just with different start values. And if I had to guess, the reason it is showing two prices is from Grandfathered prices so the crossed-out price is the normal and the left price is your discount.
---
get a 99 you monkey. Perhaps cb ones since theyre fun. Or maybe one which requires barely any attention (which are probably most) then it comes down to what tv shows you can find to watch while still progressing your acc.
---
Added
---
Why would they not just use that number as the one with a line over then? Would make the deal look even better
---
Sire gives x2 of any roll on the rdt. So technically you got double nothing hehe
---
Wait people are still complaining about Runecrafting with ZMI and Zeah rc being available?
---
Ive done 400 hards and only 2 were above 2m :( one was a robin the other was arma boots/chest back when they were worth way more. I feel like i never get uniques from clues lol.
---
:D
---
GUH
---
The poll is confusing, as the poll is asking yes/no to new tome but you are asking "is it too op". 
---
This poll might go as bad as the current statistics exam I'm writing..
---
Because when they dont have a discount it still shows how much you save in comparison, its always the 20%.
---
You did all the boring parts of the game first, nice. Now you can go do skills.
---
Makes sense to me.  The price of the 3 month package is 91.3% the price of buying 1 month of membership three times at $9.49. 
---
If you really want to nitpick  I guess Jagex should have put "save 8% per month" because the multiple month packages obviously cost more than 1 month of membership.
---
Pet could drop from offering bones on an altar. The game text does read ‚Äúthe gods are very pleased with your offering‚Äù when you use an altar...

I was considering making an iron but after playing league I have changed my mind.
---
Time is money. You're spending more time than it's worth, even at minimum wage. The argument then would be, if you enjoy the time in game you spend earning bond money. A lot of variables. Overall I strongly disagree with it being worth it, unless you're very poor and/or you have nothing but free time, as well as enjoy the time grinding in game obtaining the gold for the bond. Either way, there's nothing "smart" about it. I WOULD say If saving 11 dollars in the period of 1 month constitutes something smart enough to brag about, you need to start making different career choices... But that's not applicable because even at minumum wage, 11 a month is negligible. These are the same people that won't think twice about buying a AAA game for 60$ that they get 1/100 of the play time/ enjoyment out of. Especially seeing as everyone who plays OSRS makes 6 figures a year irl and is a cool badass drug dealer what bangs hot girls daily
---
Yeah you need to grind your social skills first, no friends available at lvl 1.
---
Lol...no. Rapier is a rare from a raid, which is one of the hardest pieces of content in the game.
---
100k? Doesn't maxing take 36k?
---
Thanks dude, this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.
---
This is actually a marriage site.
---
Oh or if you are totally loaded in game. Then I guess it's whatever, probably worth it at that point to just buy bonds.
---
I‚Äôve played RS on and off since 2005, have had probably over 20 accounts that I‚Äôve spent at least a somewhat meaningful amount of time with, multiple high level accounts. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had higher than like, 65, 70 rc lol.

wwll the poll is whether or not youd like to see it, currently i want the discussion to be in here as it is easier and theres no way i can account for every discussion option onto a poll

Okay I‚Äôm here. Now what?

Lost count on how many times I've already seen this.
---
we dont do that irl either
---
nice rsn, hacked now.
---
I know that 'do the quest' isn't the answer you're looking for, and jagex definitely needs to fix this.
---
But isn't it literally as easy as using the slayer ring tp that takes you straight to him, and killing the dude? That is like a 20 second quest.
---
Huh, well that's good to know, I'll leave me serpentine at home then lol.

Turn regular cell service on. Fuck the other passengers‚Äô lives your xp gains are far more important

I very much doubt it. All that could really be done is having middlemen who take bets and let them fight in the duel arena, but that just opens up a whole new avenue of scamming similar to dicing, and would be bannable as it is.
---
Unless you get two people who trust each other, I don't really think it's possible at all. If you go deep enough that people can't run, then someone can PJ and fuck you over. If it's not deep enough to stop running, people would just run.

Gz brother, onto quest cape next man! I recently got mine and the feeling is awesome

How so

You could try a VPN
---
I think people were saying that gangs dropped noted planks, I don't know if that's correct or not. You need like 120 or somewhere in that ballpark.

this looks really cool! I've been doing research and kind of looking for a sense of direction and been kinda struggling where to start.
---
would this be a good way for a complete beginner to get on track and get a good experience even though it a little more "hand holding" (in the sense that theres a script telling you what to do) than normal?

Hey. That's me

Lol narrows gloves then some quest cape action may, tho I‚Äôm sure there are much harder/ longer quests ima have to still do üòÇ

Is there any kind of calculator that shows how much bonus XP a monster will provide to combat skills? For example Greater Nechryaels have a 2.5 XP modifier, which is based off their combat levels/stats.

I guess to summarize my question, do I need some sort of baseline to get started on this? or can I jump right in as a complete blank slate?

&gt;FCC regulations ban the use of cell phones on planes in order to "protect against radio interference to cell phone networks on the ground." Meaning at 40,000 feet in the air, active cell phones would be picking up service from multiple cell towers on the ground. This could crowd the networks on the ground and disrupt service.

literally nothing to do with plane safety

I live in Cambridge myself and you're right cost of living is fucking gash here but thats still above average for the city. The average rent for a one bed here is more ¬£600-900. I'm not justifying it but a lot of tech jobs absolutely shaft us here. But saying that theres shit loads of tech jobs here than dont shaft you. The pay per cost of living isnt a jagex issue, but most UK company issues
---
That's it, I'm getting me mallet!
---
Relax dude it was a joke
---
So you would rather him get some instant gratification meaning quick burn out and quitting. Those 6 hours may teach him the discipline needed for some of the other intense grinds osrs can offer. 
---
Personally i let my mates struggle for a while and then only give them a tiny bit to help keep the motivation high.
---
Just a guess, I don't honestly know, but I am guessing even if you did that there'd still be a publically available paper trail. Pretty sure you could just look at the LLC and PO box listed, then lookup the individual who opened that LLC, and BAM personal info doxxed. All that does is make it a bit more of a pain because you have to go the extra step to find the public record of who owns the LLC.

I think i'm gonna burn them til 50 fm (for wintertodt), and then i'll fletch the leftovers.

OP delivered now I can die happy.

You can just go to the settings menu in the game and zoom from there then.

I'd say don't crash people, but also yikes. I'm fairly sure a report will mute these people, though honestly I think jagex needs to start throwing out a few more permanent mutes.

Also, use the "Crop to Selection" function when editing.

Damn, I wasn't aware! Very smart way to include these items! Thanks for clarifying!

So... legit wasting your own time and others. Not sure if you know but ive seen the ge tracker graph for this posted over 4 times in the past few days. None have good discussion.  The only reason i can think you would want to post this was to influence the panic market so you can make some coin flipping.

Unfortunately Runelite doesn't support gpu on mac right now :(

I would 100% give it a try. Everything you detailed is apart of OSRS in some way. I would ignore those advising in an iron man for your first account, especially if you want to PvP. Now PvP in OSES isn't like any other mmo. You want certain stats and such depending what "build" you want to play and what combat bracket so keep that in mind too. I've played this game for 15+ years on and off but always coming back and getting sucked back in after burning out over the trash MMOs on the market.
---
I play this game every waking moment and browse this sub simultaneously in a separate screen to maximize Runescape related content intake.

It's definitely less relevant because you end up with more than you need, but you still need ~8gp/xp for construction via mahogs and 75k/day for managing misc, also ~13 mil for 99 crafting via sandstone machine, a bunch of others I'm forgetting, you can also train smithing by buying gold from the blast furnace guy at like 8-13gp/xp (though you should do zalcano now probably). You end up needing ~10-40m for end game (83 construction, 83 smithing for lumb elite, 92 crafting for Zenyte, etc.) and easily 100m for max.
---
Tons of stuff. Plus you can still buy bonds via a main, or just drop it to your main.

Collection log with KC and confirmed 99 ranged: [https://i.imgur.com/O5JGEwe.png](https://i.imgur.com/O5JGEwe.png)
---
I didn't keep count of the kills but based on the bones it was about 1200 kills. Give or take maybe 50 or so from bones I never picked up. There is some profit missing here too since gold drops went straight to my cash stack as well as maybe some other odd drops.
---
I'm pretty sad about the lack of a visage or a pet, since the chance of getting any of those is 1/1500 (1/5000+1/5000+1/3000), but that's why I made the goal 99 ranged, so I could still reach a goal despite rng and be satisfied.
---
edit: oh ya, and I used dhcb with full elite void. Everything bis, (pegasians, dragonfire visage, enchanted dragon bolts, all that jazz). Personal best time was 52 seconds. Average kills per trip was 7, always killed 6-8. Best was 9 kills in a trip.
---
As I understand it...
---
Most of the reeeEE @ Rendi is unsubstantiated, and then complaining that "exposing" the dupe bug is considered bad, but that not exposing it would also be bad?

There's not really an optimal order for F2P quests but some quests have combat challenges (Vampire Slayer, Black Knights Fortress, Dragon Slayer) so it'd be wise to have higher combat stats and gear before trying them

A while ago someone posted about how great of a song it was, I think it blew up cuz most of us if not all could relate that as a kid, walking through port sarim was a blast because it‚Äôs a banger. It‚Äôs mostly a nostalgia thing but shit it‚Äôs still a great song
---
1800kc here. Here‚Äôs what I think is relevant information: 
---
The crystal pickaxe is a marginal upgrade over dragon at Zalcano, especially in masses (groups of 6+). Mining level matters more than pick used. 
---
You gain shards so quickly in masses that the shard cost of using the pick is peanuts compared to the shards you receive. 
---
The seed price is in a nosedive with no signs of stopping, so you could probably wait and pick it up even cheaper down the line.
---
This is great and terrible at the same time, I guess you could say it's... biddasweet
---
was gunna say, dang 25k/hr average is pretty low then looked up and u got 600m xp not 300m xp. i'd been had.
---
If your combat is maxed its the best build for pking imo. Zerkers aren‚Äôt that good. Not used mine in a long time cause it just gets slapped about by 60 attack med levels.
---
Sounds like you picked the wrong relic, guy.

I was banned roughly 7 years ago for macro and someone shared this on the sub and was unbanned the next day. As long as you truly are sorry for what you've done, I'm sure it'll work out. Let's face it, a lot of us who botted back then we're just ignorant teens.
---
Imagine my joy signing in after 7 years on my very first original account.
---
A calc for how much xp/gpspent you'll get in mm2 caves for gear and level for bursting and chinning
---
As an example : 
---
If I'm wearing these items at this mage/range lvl Its likely I'll get around X Xp/h and spend around Y amount of gold if I used red or black Chins.
---
Guides Ive looked up elsewhere tend to not provide this info apart from that it's "good xp"  or what "you'd get in elite void / ancestralüòÇ
---
Explain? Because the way I see it, they've changed quite a few game mechanics for this and past temporary game modes. I don't understand your point.
---
If our IQs are so low, then surely you can explain it better than anyone so that we can understand
---
"Evolve Clan" are pretty sweet
---
There is an empty option or something similar to remove the cannonballs.
---
Its probably your boss choice as in hard mode they have a lot of defence. With nmz the more bosses you put in the more points youll get per hour but its only really worth it once you do dream mentor quest as they give a lot of points. You can still do hard mode but the bosses i would pick would be count draynoy, king ronald, tree spirit as they have low defence. Then adding in bosses like moss giant, ice troll king, dad will give you more xp ph as they have exp multipliers on them
---
If you miss you can just double spec
---
wow, nostalgic
---
Didn‚Äôt ask
---
The game is pretty static and there‚Äôs a fixed ceiling. Endgame content doesn‚Äôt come around often enough that you can‚Äôt catch up. That said you will be stuck in the mid levels for what feels like forever. Then you‚Äôll randomly get inspired or maybe depression and go from 85-99 in a skill over the weekend.     
---
The most rewarding content is quests and achievement diaries in terms of lasting benefits.
---
They were never meant to be genuinely useful
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôm going to donate to a women‚Äôs shelter after seeing this meme

It was used to bot chins and stripped of most of them. Enjoy the little money you have for free and the 99 hunter to use to rebuild.
---
Change your email, secure it this time and practice better online safety.
---
The Brimhaven fruit patch is right by the docks whereas the Catherby fruit patch is waayyy out east relative to the docks. It's only a 240gp charter. They're both annoying detours but I'm pretty sure Catherby first would take longer. The Ardougne teleport is a good idea, kudos. 
---
This is probably not an optimal route, though. I have 96 farming and my route is much more convoluted, this was just a shot at thinking up a route that would work for someone at OP's stage of progression.
---
You need a lockpick to steal Artefacts. They're a hard diary task and also many league points are rewarded for different milestones (25, 50, etc)
---
Nope, enjoy your 99 hunt.
---
Honestly just the dps calc would be great.
---
mr. white knight not following his own advice. There has been many since time memorable of reposts with the same scholastics book.
---
It‚Äôs probably just your str lvl, 50k seems low but is not bad for your str lvl I remember getting around 55-60k on my alt at 80 str. You could do hard mode and get more points with the same bosses and you wouldn‚Äôt be sacrificing much if any xp (as long as you‚Äôre choosing low def bosses) just the amount of time in nmz (if using absorbtions). If you use super combats and absorbtions it‚Äôll be way more afk aswell(assuming you have a means to lower hp).
---
Enjoy ban
---
My kind of "dad" joke.....
---
Take my upvote and leave !!
---
Seems like you more or less have the gist of the dupe. Some players used a bunch of accounts at clan wars to cause a server crashed and use that to dupe. It happened like twice before an update resolved it. I'm not sure how much the duping impacted the economy since Rendi reported it fairly early on and the coins may not have transfer far; it was probably more panic over the existence of a dupe once it got out, especially since Jagex never publicly said it was fixed.
---
But does it bring awareness, or does it make it seem ok not to have empathy and laugh at someones struggle?
---
Pretty sure titan has like one million defense get rid of him. Id disable dad too.

Pray the 10% str pray, its cheap

None of the duel arena scams work outside duel arena as well
---
No monsters to farm for specific loot
---
The scams are different between the two, it is easier to scam in duel arena as I understand it.
---
Duel arena enables RWT in several ways, allowing people to dive their match and successfully cover up the fact that they are doing so.
---
Also, you're literally betting on the fact that you will win, that is the precedent. It is gambling, ie. A 'stake'.

Crafting cape seems a bit overrated to me, there are so many ways to quickly get to a bank, one of which is teleporting to your house and using your jewelry box which you can do indefinitely with the construction cape.

theres nothing in the game that comes close to nmz 20 minute afk or sandcrabs 10 minute afk.

redwoods @ 5minutes &gt;&gt;&gt; magics/anglers that are generally like 3-4 minutes &gt; stuff like karams/cooking that is like 90s afk

afking is a good way to max your combats.

In case you're not joking:
---
That's a very rare skilling pet (agility), some people get unlucky and don't get one even at 99 agility. If you die with one following you it dissapears, you can pick it up and put it in your bank to avoid that.
---
You can insure the pet for 500k gp, if you die with it afterwards (with the insurance) you can reclaim it for 1 million coins.
---
Thanks. I actually had no idea why I got it. I got it after 15 agility and before I even got 10 Marks
---
For the next league, on the page where it lists all the tasks and you can highlight them, have it so it calculates your total points at the bottom based on which are highlighted. This would have really helped me when working out the fastest tasks to my 10k point goal.

Hi, sorry I didn't link evidence of chatlogs from Bea5. I'm on mobile so I have no idea how to link stuff.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e376lj/video_proof_of_bea5_answering_questions_in_rendis/
---
That's the URL to a reddit thread showing video evidence of Bea5 discussing Rendi's whole shebang. If you're unfamiliar, Bea5 is a friend of Rendi's who has assisted Rendi in numerous videos and is the current record holder for highest Slayer level on a level 3 skiller, just in case you're going to try to doubt their association.
---
Is it possible that Bea5 is lying? Yes, but as of right now it's effectively his word against Rendi's. Rendi has been very much silent after all of this, however, and the motive detailed is rather logical seeing Rendi wanted to take advantage of update rollbacks at first.
---
Also, you do know that Twitch Prime also comes with free trials of Amazon Prime and it's actually shockingly easy to abuse that system? I argued that point because I thought everyone knew about it. Honestly, if you didn't know, you should seriously take advantage of the free trial to claim 14 days of membership ASAP. Anyways, my point is, this does create the possibility for a ton of accounts to be mass produced with free membership.
---
Remember that EVScape ban drama? Yeah... based solely on that incident I think we have enough information to gather that Jagex has a past of incompetence, that the community would definitely be in an uproar if Rendi was banned over a MERE COINCIDENCE (especially after you realize these bug abusers could easily crash servers over a long period of time to normalize them first and it does not even need to be a one time occurrance), and that Jagex does not operate as smoothly as other game companies, thus making them unfair comparisons.
---
Next, you cannot deny there is no logical reason the exploiters would have told Rendi when and where they would be executing the server crash. And no, simply dismissing this point because I have no evidence is proof you're not as smart as you think you are. It puts Rendi's innocence in reasonable doubt, whether you want to believe it or not.
---
Anyways, you keep asking for evidence but you have provided no real logical counterpoints to anything said about Rendi's alleged motive or associates. Innocent until proven guilty still requires evidence presented against the defence be disproved adequately in a situation where the original case is "He said, she said."
---

Oh wow I didn‚Äôt know the lance was that cheap. If I have 89 range, but have 92 attack and defense, would the lance be better? I have a 150m bank so I could sell to get it technically
---
I had a 7 day mite or suspension for "account sharing". Evidence, part of a conversation with me and a friend taken out of context that said "want to help me train wcing?". A guy standing near us reported me, and I explained that I wanted company while training, and yet Jagex decided to punish me anyway.

Uim, this will create more inventory space, if items are bound then jagex has no reason to not bring the old death mechanic's back. This also feels very private server, were the three main negatives I have. 
---
Pros would be ironman can rebuild quicker as items are bound, creates an item sink which RS really needs.
---
Yes that is 2 actions so that would be against the rules.
---
He's an ironman, and he stands alone
---
Reported and banned
---
A lot of transport wifi services don't allow streaming or gaming. I tried this on a train once and I could only get normal webpages to connect.
---
&gt;Uim, this will create more inventory space
---
Firstly it would be optional and you cannot cater the game towards UIM - so nothing there changes.
---
&gt;if items are bound then jagex has no reason to not bring the old death mechanic's back
---
Bound does not equal invulnerable to loss, it could mean that item cannot be dropped/traded/sold - death could still drop that item to be lost.
---
&gt;This also feels very private server
---
Pretty subjective view, but whenever i watch a streamer with all their RL plugins on i get the same feeling. But again - it would be optional.
---
Maybe you should just clean off your screen
---
I mean lance is the only truly expensive item you *need*, rest are couple mil each, or can be reasonably substituted with cheaper items. Also it seems you didn't include rigour into your range setup price, did you?
---
Didnt block out them runes say bye bye acount.
---
I lost 1.7b on my scythe so far :)

No, its not accurate. It can never be 100% as 100% is a guarantee, there are no such guarantees. 99.99% is the correct number here, not 100%.
---
Noone is going to pay for this when you wouldn't be able to protect shit. All you have left is non-total worlds which get trashed nonstop by literally everyone.
---
With the Keldagrim/Blast Furnace Shop stocking 100 of almost every ore, is mining even necessary on an Ironman?

Outside of quest requirements, I can‚Äôt seem to find a reason.

thanks, i hate it
---
Its a single player game mode. Ie another form of iron man.  Im getting downvoted by spoiled pvmers in their reddit safespace, obviously I don‚Äôt give a fuck. If I did id sick back while I let them kill the game so streamers can have more lazy content, which is the only thing twisted leagues was made for.

It's always the seller. The tax is attributed to the convenience the online sales allow.

What about Crystal pendant
---
I tried it recently. It's quite enjoyable. If you ignore both subreddits and enjoy the game at your own exploration, it's quite good. The quests are magnificent. The Pvm is refreshing and challenging in its own right and when compared to osrs. If you do plan on playing it, then I'd say you'll need to shoot for a PvM playthrough progressing through bossing from low to end game.
---
PvM beginner hurdles are stats and ability unlocks, which are either bought or obtained as a drop or from activities or quests. PvM mid level hurdles are gear and unlocking invention perks. High end bossing hurdles are going full manual to control your ability rotations yourself and making good dps rotations/understanding them alongside your defensive rotations. Set yourself a milestone boss in each tier of PvM that will be a good short term goal for you to complete once you're finished with a previous goal.
---
so osrs helped!

The wiki page says she's already there. Under "slayer category" it says boss.

I did go get my cape immediately afterwards!

Id say work on untradeables, fighter torso and b gloves and f cape. Other than that the first upgrade should be a torture so youll have to save up a bit more

Alt* for manual layout

Dont worry bro you are just in nmz

because in both pvp and pvm theres a skill involved in clicking the right prayers, since every good prayer is near the bottom of the list. by allowing rearranging, youre allowing prayer switches to be faster and lowering the skill ceiling. particualarly in pvp, this update removes a lot of skill. im very glad it didnt pass.

As one of the people who is able to buy a tbow - I'm not covering a 10m tax loss, I'll trade in person and avoid it - you effectively hurt the poorer as, people like me, are fine paying 100k and under and those over it will w2 it. Those who struggle will feel it the most, I imagine the main reason jagex haven't entertained the thought

Its dmm v2 ironman mode edition.

Its all specifically made for streamers to have easy access to no brain content because they are lazy.

The time and effort would have brought similar player interaction with content that would benefit the longevity of the game, rather than delete itself in a couple weeks.

Having a gold sink is great, but removing a room us wayy to much of a benefit for 100k.
---
How about this,

Ban the scouting plugin.
---
Add a coffer next to the entrace
---
And have it take 100k out each raid you start that it has scouted for you?
---
Fixes the problem and adds a nice gp sink.
---
This is depressing:
---
Runelite is the official client for all intents and purposrs. The vanilla client is as much a handicap as area restricted ironman that you are using just so you can be a snowflake

It's even worse when your dad talks bs like "oh if someone DDoS's then you should just track him and jail him/execute him/whatever".

Runelite is not affiliated with jagex
---
It is not an official client.
---
It is only governed by jagex so they can have overpowered plugins removed. Nothing else.
---
The vanilla pc client and mobile app are the ONLY official clients.
---
I am collecting all of my screenshots right now. Wait for the community to find out exactly how you're scamming them.
---
Rs3 pvm is allegedly (I've never tried it) great but there is one thing you need to realize: despite the community dichotomy, rs3 is literally a completely different game with different mechanics and different playability. Really, it's almost entirely different from osrs aside from certain similarities.
---
That said, osrs has amazing pvm content and whoever gave you the impression that it doesn't is misguided.
---
Just use runelite mate
---
Yeah you're dense
---
I really appreciate the community for being so encouraging and welcoming. Everyone has been super helpful and I'm excited to start my adventure! Hope to see you all in game

It's great due to the massive defense it gives. Also mage helps when attacking mage hand

Only if they fix the bug where you have to start the raid in order to rescout, currently if you go in, then just leave you sometimes have to wait a minute before you can create a new one due to the raid still being open

You're not going to find much intelligent discussion relating to third party clients on this subreddit I'm afraid. 
---
I'm with you though. Runelite really straddles the line between being just "quality of life" and straight up broken. I wish Jagex would take a stronger stance on what is and isn't acceptable. Their previous blogpost was weak in this respect.

I keep trying to get them to implement a PvM boss that has no special death mechanics.  Its instanced, and if you die you lose all but your 3 items. Just like the old days.  I get downvoted to hell because people don't want to lose their shit.  They completely forget the current fucking mechanics were unpolled, nobody wanted them, they were forced onto us because they would never have passed a poll at the time.
---
This would all be done automatically, right?
---
Or course people could mess with it to give it false positives on purpose, but that could be done to the bad Grammer one as well.

What is some feedback for leagues that the team would like to discuss?  Like what are some ideas that the team liked and would consider incorporating into future leagues, and what are other ones that were seen, but ultimately rejected?
---
For example, lockpick bottlenecking changes, the gem stall 250 points being too high, and acknowledging but not changing how the prayer relic makes it harder to get dbones for the alter.
---
An additional topics I'd like to bring up about leagues:
---
What quests could be considered unlocked for future leagues?  This league, spirit trees are inaccessible, all dragon weapons except sword and claws are locked, and even climbing boots.
---
Can you add a message to zalcano, that tells you if you didnt get a roll on the unique drop table. The minimum damage needed to get any loot, and a roll on the unique drop table are not the same, therefore u can still get the regular loot but not know that you didnt actually roll the unique. This would be very useful in masses, as it is very hard to see how much damage you are actually dealing.
---
Do you have auto smashing of vials enabled on potions?  Do you have runes enabled to go into your rune pouch when you pick them up?  If so, why is this significantly less OP version of these QOL improvements so bad?  Like you said, it is simple to get rid of them, so why not just allow the player to choose to have them disappear right after burning?

This happens in a lot of other games that allow addons.  The vanilla client works great for newer players and is good enough to where development can be focused on game updates, not client updates.  
---
Since 3rd party clients exist, the devs know that all the experienced players will use them for their addons anyways, so it's pointless to add these features to the vanilla client.  It's expected that players will start using 3rd party clients once they start taking the game seriously.  
---
So yes, using the vanilla client is unnecessarily handicapping yourself.

---
Nice screen name, pretty specific.
---
First of all if you think that adding prayer re ordering to the game will attract new players I have no idea what to tell you. It barely fails when it‚Äôs polled because of the ‚ÄúI had to learn it this way so everyone else should as well‚Äù mentality. I do think there is an argument somewhere within there though. Next do they add prayer favourites on auto pray? Should you be able to assign prayers to hotkeys? I think the poll is a great way to decide things like that. It‚Äôs not a game integrity change.

I've posted this the last couple of weeks:

Is there any word on reducing the chat clickbox and reducing the time for long-tap on mobile?

You're right that it's a very common tactic though.
---
Considering slayer is about each gargoyle kill in your task, it‚Äôs surprising that the boss didn‚Äôt originally count as two kills towards your task, and the perk would‚Äôve only counted it as one kill for the purpose of keeping you killing the bosses, on task?

Jagex either goofed hard, or they designed the content with certain players in mind...

Yeah, the guy you're replying to read that about Nigerian prince scams and is now spouting it here in an attempt to seem smart for upvotes.

The reaction to Magic weapons seems wrong.  
---
With Magic you can freeze mobs and players, prevent players from teleporting, do massive damage with the spells like Ice Barrage and Fire Surge, you can train Prayer for a very low cost (And still gain exp in other skills), you can teleport to almost anywhere in the game, you can even resurrect Farming.

The new staff/staves and Tome will just make it insanely overpowered, plus the Tome will speed up Barrage Slayer even more.

Honestly I feel that unless items carry over from one League to another (which I am against), then they shouldnt be in the League game at all.  Alternatively is allow all items to be used with the proper stat reqs, ignoring quests reqs. 
---
Obvious example: Not require lost city to hold dragon longsword
---
Other example: dragon longsword removed from clue scroll rewards and replaced with either an item that is usable in TL or simple cash/runes.
---
Holy shit, I didn't even realize I used it that much.

Recently btw.

I guess we're talking about different things then, because I wasn't referring to stuff like tool assisted speedruns or anything with minecraft and rust. I mostly meant sanctioned third party support. I meant like how osrs has runelite, rs3 has alt1 toolkit, wow has countless addons, I used to play blade and soul and they have bnsbuddy client because vanilla is terrible, I've played world of tanks and they have lots of ui and overlay mods. Sounds like ESO has a lot of addons, and FF14 doesn't have addon support but the community doesn't sound like they'd be opposed. It makes sense that larger communities step up and fill in the blanks of where official game clients are lacking.
---
The majority of the osrs community seems to accept runelite and its addons, but the vocal portion against it are the most vehemently opposed to 3pc and functionality that I've ever seen in mmos.
---
A rigorous definition of "unfair advantage" is probably needed, because there are a lot of addons in a lot of games that you could say give an advantage over vanilla. Vanilla osrs especially is a low baseline. I'm not sure if we should also account for availability of the advantage too when judging fairness, because anyone can download runelite or install addons in those other games. Cheat clients that are bannable give advantages that aren't available to everyone without risking ban.

The two values you see are the values not wearing the ring of wealth and then wearing the ring of wealth. So 1/36,393.87 without the ROW and 1/4,222.71 with the ROW worn. The values are calculated using the chance to roll the table and calculated with the RDT subtable chances for each time. Each page has different values due to different chances to roll the RDT.

Bursting is also like the best defense exp m/hr you could ever get. It's fine to use defensive casting if you're not concerned with magic exp.
---
To be fair, and I may be giving people too much credit, but if you can't solve a sliding puzzle without the puzzle solver plug-in, it sounds like a "you" problem more than a plug-in problem. I think the main issue here is efficiency. A lot of players, especially a part of this subreddit, grew up playing RuneScape, back when nobody had full-time jobs and could play 15 hours a day or pull all-nighters. This was back when everyone just went to RuneHQ to look up quest guides and where coordinate locations were. This is also my personal experience, but now, since many people work full-time and have more important commitments, play time goes way down, but everyone still wants to progress and not fall behind. Some plug ins, like clue step solvers and puzzle solvers just save time. But this exceeds just RuneScape though, everyone's looking for ways to save time outside of the game. I think this is the reason why most players support these plug-ins.
---
I believe where most people draw the line, and Jagex themselves, is when a plug-in replaces the skill needed to perform certain tasks, like bossing/where to stand/prayer notifications (certain things are arguable of course, but I'm speaking generally), rather than mundane repeatable tasks that just take more time, which I think is a pretty fair line to draw. I mean yeah, certain things may affect how many raids you can do an hour/affect item prices, but I'd like to see a lot data related to that extrapolated over time and see if the plug-ins had a major effect. I feel that if Jagex doesn't deem raid plugins, such as the one you've mentioned, as an integrity issue, it may not be. But maybe it is and they haven't been paying attention, and in that case, everyone is at the mercy of the majority when it comes to polling (unless of course Jagex deems it an integrity issue themselves and doesn't poll it). Overall,  I'm okay with the plug ins that exist currently on RuneLite, and i'd rather we have these ways of saving time rather than a Pay To Win system (excluding bonds, which i agree are a better alternative to buying from sketchy websites, because that isn't going to go away).  
---
When it comes to actually updating the game to improve the middle ground between the official client and 3P clients, i think the unfortunate reality is that if the majority of players are using 3P clients, it's not a priority to update their own client if the majority already has that feature, they may view it as a waste of development time.

Can we have peoples twisted league relic choices displayed on the hiscores?

As far as I'm aware, there hasn't been any official discussion about changing prices of the rewards.
---
Like other people have said, Vorkath is the second best solo moneymaker after Hydra and arguably the best consistent solo moneymaker in the game (other than solo raids). Vorkath with DHCB and Vorkath with Lance are only a 200-300k profit per hour difference, and profit exceeds 3m per hour. 
---
Dagannoth Kings are pretty easy to do if you have high melee stats and decent gear. However doing all three takes a bit of practice and good timing coupled with good gear, and you definitely need Fremmenik Elite and SGS to extend trips and maximize profit. 
---
Hydra is the best solo moneymaker in the game hands down. It also has a pretty low gear requirement, just blowpipe, blessed dhides and anguish/Archers ring. But it‚Äôs 95 slayer, and even though it‚Äôs the highest weight task from Konar, it‚Äôs the same frequency as really shit tasks like Drakes and Wyrms (which arguably should be blocked), and you may go a thousand points worth of skips dry. 
---
Other than these, I‚Äôve found Revs to be an excellent and also low requirement moneymaker during off peak hours when I want a little variety, and profit widely varies from 2m an hour to 4m an hour with craws bow. However you‚Äôll be shooting yourself in the foot without at least 84 agility, and revs are extremely difficult during peak hours with all the teams that come by.

Venenatis and Callisto are decent 1.7-2m per hour moneymakers but their drops are RNG dependent. These by far have the lowest requirements to do. Venenatis requires craws bow, and Callisto requires veracs set or viggoras mace. All are very cheap nowadays. 
---
Finally GWD bosses like Armadyl and Saradomin are good solo bosses but they require at least 100m in gear and so are not for everyone. Efficient strategies require max ranged, t bows and chinchompas, and rely entirely on rare drops to bring profit. I don‚Äôt recommend this for anybody but late game players.
---
Nothing is ever forgotten it's just stored in their ever expanding backlog that is probably a thousand or more ideas deep.
---
As a beginner iron man her videos have helped me so much.
---
Can an extra day of Twisted League be added with PVP turned on and points turned off? Kind of a last man standing deal. Would be fun since everything is going to get wiped anyway
---
He be on mixer now
---
Well rip, everyone is saying "oh they will lower prices" I just want the helm recolor but jesus triple harvest ruins everything for me
---
It depends what you primary goal is. If you want tons of magic xp, don't use defensive casting.
---
Think of it like using the shared xp on a whip
---
Scorpia is fucking awful dude. It‚Äôs also shit money too. Venenatis is easy, safespottable and profitable.
---
I'll be honest I'm not new and I didn't know this.
---
I quit right before invention I got like 80 divination I think? but it just got ridiculous with crystal city the prerequisites went from like I need 2 or 3 quests to like i need over 25 lol.
---
It doesnt require a lot of attention so it's easy to game or watch TV while you do it, or for hackers to play on multiple accounts while doing it.  And back then it was like 500k/ hr, which isnt amazing but it's a lot when you're bank is worth 5k because you just got hacked and the input for doing salamanders is only 5k
---
I mean if you have a regular main account, I don't mind helping you out by bringing you stuff if need be. I have Prif unlocked so it would be easy to get there for me. If you're an Ironman, you're fucked. BTW.
---
When I start a grind and don't get what I want, I makeover mage my character to female. I mean, if random dudes give girl characters free stuff and Jagex is mostly dudes, then Jagex must be willing to give stuff to female characters, right?
---
Or I'm just a creep.
---
Any shot we can get the shop restock times improved for dynamite in the blast mine shop for TL? Similar to how the rune shops work etc?
---
It'd be a great training method but the shop restocks at normal speed and thus is completely bought out all the time.
---
It'd still be much cheaper to make your own for those of us that are too lazy I love the ability to buy it also.
---
I have 75 mage, 83 defence. I want 99 both. I'm willing to cast or chin. I'm just making sure choosing magic to get defence exp isn't so inefficient compared to chinning that it's exp waste.
---
How come left clicking ham member menu entry swap is not allowed, but something like left clicking bones offering a way bigger advantage is.
---
You are the absolute worst.

---
Big congrats man. Probably the rarest thing in the game.
---
Weak
---
are there PKing plugins for third party clients? I haven't seen or heard of it before.
---
I disagree that they shouldn't do stuff like this. Area locked ironmen like we see on YT have literally no competition for their resources they just need time and effort to collect them. When you throw a hundred thousand accounts into 10 or less worlds you're begging people to lose their minds over something like this. This league was made in such a way to minimize the amount of strain and insanity that the area locked ironmen actually endure in order to appeal to the common player so that action makes sense. If anything you can just call that a mistake that they didn't do in the first place and maybe they have it ready to go first thing next league.
---
Good point, lets get jagex the spend a ftonne of money developing content thats virtually not accessible on their own client.
---
Pretty sure the possibility of rollbacks allowing for this to happen has been known for a while, yes, but no one knew how to reliably force a rollback until recently. I'm pretty sure that was explicitly stated in the video, so I'm not sure how you missed it, being a huge Rendi fan and all.
---
Should Jagex have fixed the dupe bug before now? Absolutely. Would upper management have allowed them to? Almost certainly not. That requires time and resources being spent to fix a bug that no one knows how to take advantage of yet, instead of developing content that brings in/keeps players and rakes in $$$. You have no idea how businesses work, and as shitty as it is, that's just the reality of capitalism.
---
Also whilst you're right Rendi made the exploit known to the devs, we all now know he did it purely because he wanted to profit off of a failed attempt to exploit the bug himself, but maybe you just don't know that or you're selectfully ignoring it, I don't know. Rendi should definitely not be hailed as some kind of "hero" who "saved" the economy, when he was the one who helped in attempting to destroy it.
---
You can only pick seeds from monsters only you damaged which is unlikely, so the main should pick seeds.
---
You get overloads from monsters if you dealt over half damage. Usually when I duo with my friend on my noob ironman, he lets me damage little mutta so I get the ovl.
---
Potion drops from ironman kills give no points to anyone
---
You can't take anything from shared chest, even if you just put it there yourself
---
It is usually beneficial for the ironman to get secondaries to both players since the main can't get secondaries to the ironman
---
I got mine at 267. Yours might be at 201. Keep at it brother.
---
huh i guess that was before my time if black sallies were 500k/hr
---
Why would they do that when runelite costs them nothing
---
I think they should stay . Why ? You can still sell or alch them. 
---
If they did like that on things like clues or monsters like on a Slayer task , it would make the already easy game mode far far easier to obtain your desired items faster.
---
But if you don't want to compete for resources don't play the gamemode or do something else on the worlds.
---
Why did you say I have no idea how businesses work? My family has run our business for 40 years and I have a fucking business degree
---
Auguste did 9/11
---
Scorpia is fun for me. Yes, drops suck that‚Äôs why I mentioned it. I find venenatis boring as you wait forever to kill her after safespotting.
---

Or at least some insulin
---
I know this isn't the point of this post but I know like 10 people in my med school who play osrs or RS3. I don't 3 tick though.
---
I kinda want to know what the rarest single drop from any monster is now
---
Well depending on what you're asking there's many different answers.
---
Are you asking for the chance to get 3 dragon spears?  Or the chance to get that EXACT combination of drops?  Do you want the answer to assume you hit the RDT or the overall droprate?  It's tricky.

good lord i couldnt imagine if i started over.. i would still be playing 07 if the stats transfered over but they didnt so i quit.

Oh my bad, I thought it was a competition to get the most points, and just ten minutes ago you said "You do need it for points."

So is it a casual thing or is it something you "need"?

He's still a piece of shit, just on a different platform.

Since the Abyssal Sire changes were received well, could the Grotesque Guardians get some love? Even with max stats and gear, this "mid-level" boss takes a very long time to kill with sub-par loot. Do you guys have any plans to change them?

It got rotated to 492 and all the bots are gone. Minigame is dead you can only get casual games now.

Right, but could they really sue you for damages in court? Just because you broke their user agreement doesn't mean you owe them money. It just means they don't have to provide the service for you anymore.

Watch slayermusiq1's guide and remember the pattern
---
It's 1/5, you either get 0,1,2,3 or 4 spears per drop
---
A very valid point, but maybe they make it area restricted, leaving out a lot of the content that people are really looking forward to, and shorten the league so it doesn't seem to drag on like this league. I've already noticed people playing and watching less. I just see there being a few things on launch that players may not like as much in practice as they may choose on a poll, or technical limitations that may need to be addressed prior to a full launch

Crazy, I see so many posts of people getting beavers on regular trees or the one guy who got 3 in one day.  Then you see stuff like this and the guy who went over 100m xp before beaver. RNG is a motherfucker sometimes but it‚Äôs also the reason it‚Äôs such a dopamine rush when you finally get your drop.
---
Haha I had someone approach me at Kurasks to try this scam! Jamflex needs to add a warning to the tele like all the other wildy teles.
---
Relic bonuses on side of screen
---
Interesting ideas and concept. I support all of the above except for making anymore weapons or armor degradable. Degrading armor is awful.
---
One of the draws of Twisted League is how niche activities are the best way to play the game limited by the resources available in that area.
---
Same goes for skill capes. 
---
One obvious exception is the recent update for lockpicks. It made sense to add them to the region because they are required for an activity in the region. Bob Barter on the other hand doesn‚Äôt have much use in the area.
---
Yes, already done them
---
What do you mean that the looting bag is locked behind BH2?  I got one just last week from killing the NPC from a clue scroll.  Seems like you can still kill NPCs to me.
---
Using that logic, there are millions of people playing powerball so winning it is not actually that rare either...
---
This is a calculation based from the probability of a single event happening once. This is less likely to happen than winning the powerball.
---
Crashing isn't being a dick. There I said it.
---
It's a competition for twisted league points. You do tasks to get those points. Competition can be to be top 1% or whatever percentile you want or you can actually have a casual experience to get 6000 points for the helmet.
---
A Lockpick is needed to get points. In order to obtain these points, they've made the experience of an area locked ironman as casual as you can make it in order to feel like account progress can actually be made. 
---
Getting the lockpick from an impling is like everyone on day 1 of ploughing the fields except fate is given to RNG on two different fronts and a one or two people if you're lucky gets the implings in their spawn and you have another chance in 30 minutes in 3 areas of zeah across multiple worlds. This shouldn't turn into a hunt to get a RCB from a lucky impling.
---
Judging by the text on the left side it's not flipped
---
&gt;People now have to kill lvl npcs for a looting bag after every death for 3 mins. This has created unintended downtime which is not enjoyable.
---
If you get membership, prioritize slayer and farming to make some money
---
Well, if you've actually done the Gauntlet/Corrupted Gauntlet (it's not called hard), you would know that, like Corp, it really is not easily farmable. So, I'd like to see proof that you have actually ever completed the corrupt gauntlet.
---
Anyways, it takes at least 5 minutes for the corrupted gauntlet with amazing luck, averaging 7:30 for an exceptional player and 11 minutes for an average player while having droprates comparable to GWD bosses who die significantly faster. The normal Gauntlet has a 1/2000 droprate which is literally comparable with sigils from Corp while taking the average player 7 minutes per kill. This is significantly slower than a group Corp kill unless you're doing a spec to 0 solo, which removes all mechanical difficulty from Corp.

On Twitter it's evident that the ban rates have been increasing with a ton of false bans (just from observing the feed of the Jmods who get tagged), yes there will always be human-error and that is why there is an appeal system for macro bans. My question is the people who have been falsely banned out of human error for Real World Trading bans, do you guys have any intention of giving those certain players a voice to get their bans quashed?
---
And if the poll fails arcane will surge back up
---
Now what‚Äôs the arcane to alt ratio I need to ensure it fails?
---
- Vast majority of skills are useless. Any chance Crafting, Smithing, etc. could actually be useful for producing the intended goods? Nothing BiS but good, say for example ironmen. Room for niche items as well as long as it's not the focus of the update.
---
- 3-ticking currently make it impossible to poll alternative training methods to existing skills into the game. Any chance you could nerf 3t and replace it with something that is actually part of the game and doesn't require obscure items in inventory? Something everyone can partake in?
---
- Zeah RC has proven to be quite popular update. Any chance this could be expanded to other altars as the de facto method of training RuneCrafting? Mining was originally designed to be part of the skill, this would be a nice way to make it relevant again (isntead of most essence being given through mobs from combat)
---
- Could you concider making veins in F2P personal so F2P don't have to suffer because of bots? Bots will get resources anyway, all it does is penalize current F2P's.
---
make a zerker i guess
---
I didn't know that but jagex has also been pumping huge amounts of gold into the game through alchables, slayer drop tables, wildy drop table, bounty hunter etc...
---
Ok, i just realized that link might look suspicious...
---
Just go to official osrs page, on left find "buy membership", log in with account and youl see prices there. Which are twice better than on amazon.
---
So questions stands same. Can i buy membership from there and give it somehow as a gift?
---
I have 100m bank so definitely not me haha
---
It‚Äôs still insanely strong, but it was also one of the reasons the staff was broken strong.  You could literally 1 hit anyone who wasn‚Äôt 99 hp or above.
---
thanks
---
I'm planning to go and splash Ardy knight at world 302 to help other players because there was no splasherfor days.

How could she not be? She has 99 firemaking...

Agree with both of you. Would love more content in those places.

Tbow shoots every 3.6 seconds and there‚Äôs delays between phases.  Even 10 straight 50s is ~45 seconds.

Can we get some quick-menu options for Murphy at port khazard? For both diving and getting the fishbowl helmet and diving apparatus back.

The dialogue now is just annoyingly long for nothing and this would be valueble QoL.
---
Not sure when tbow was nerfed, but there are a few clips of people getting 33-34 second kills in 2017. Afaik nobody has gotten a sub 30sec kill.
---
you pick teams like in grade school
---
$54 dollars for a sweater
---
&gt;and maybe drop it to other people around after too

And just like that, every server is DDOSed nonstop.
---
People sell chaos runes for tokkul, and use the tokkul to buy onyxs
---
Not the actual pineapple plants around Brimhaven.
---
But it back.  Poll won‚Äôt pass and it will go up again.
---
Yeah, but you'd think they would at least put it through some basic spell/grammar check. It's not gonna be perfect that way, but it should catch most egregious errors.
---
If it were me, I would want it to seem as official as possible, which would include having proper grammar and terminology. Would just make you more likely to fool people imo.
---
So by that line of reasoning, you don't see an issue with doing something considered by most to be discourteous unless there's a specifically something stopping you from doing it. They had it coming to them because they dared venture outside of areas where they're vulnerable to such behavior.

I do believe 10x was a very slight power creep as it allowed you to hit what are now decimal hits and rounded down.  IE my max with dds is like a 41.9 but with 10x I could hit a 419

Not with 1 slayer :)
---
Never even had real life friends that played but I've stuck with it for this long as well. 99 farming was my first non combat 99 and definitely a fun achievement to get. The fact your old friends aren't playing to see it doesn't devalue it, congratulations man!

Can't think of anything that would be a particular problem with that tbh. A relic like the current one to choose slayer tasks alongside the task-only areas would solve that problem a bunch. And the important bosses are instanced.

Has the team thought of any ideas for good item sinks? So many mid level items like barrows and dragon equipment is at alch value or incredibly low, as no items leave the game anymore.

A one or two-tick rhythm might be good enough for some CPR.

I personally was like this as well because I made 100m from Zalcano before I got my firecape

I dont understand why some nerd downvoted you, why....
---
I mean I get that through a series of convoluted steps you can technically achieve this, but that's pretty dumb. I shouldn't have to go through the hassle of 'preparing' my bank for any skill I want to train. My suggestion would obviously be a huge improvement.
---
Most of the famous HCs have lost their status to instability/internet issues. Rarely do we see them losing to mechanics.
---
It is similar to PvM players. 10 minutes to resolve an internet issue is very stressful. Jagex probably wanted to reduce the number of incidents of this nature, since they probably got a few billion reports for these very issues.
---
Discerning which is legitimate, etc. is also impossible, so you'd 100% would leave a sour taste in those who had legitimate issues, and lost several hundred hours to uncontrollable problems.
---
They legit sounded retarded on the Q&amp;A when they were talking about it.

Cool who was it and what forum did they use to advertise?

Because its blatantly obvious you don't.
---
I feel I'm in the same boat as you. I use the vanilla client and solo raiding feels so disappointing. It's a little demotivating to know that no matter what I do, I'll be raiding like 50%+ slower just because I don't use a third party client.
---
I really wish they would address this, but until then I guess I'll just deal with my terrible raid times.
---
What are some must have quests to get done?
---
Isn't it more efficient to train slayer using range? More dps, get the tasks done faster so more xp/h as well? Not sure though, just a thought.
---
I can tell you have never pk'd no pker wants to chase clue hunters in the wilderness they want real fights. But killing clue hunters while you hunt pkers can be massively profitable, people are stupid and take all kids of stupid risk when on clues the other day I pk'd a guys rune pouch with max laws/astrals in it.

Arcane is BIS mage off hand. If you have the money, like many people do, it‚Äôs worth buying. There‚Äôs no reason for jagex to kill the one clear BIS item from Corp.
---
4: Main, hc and 2 pures. Currently only playing with hc and main.
---
We need a recipe for disaster 2. It would involve the same people and would be tricked again but the quests would be much harder and with more dumb requirements. It would also require you to have completed all quests. Completion of the quest would unlock a cooking boss who awards a pet, BiS food, and a x2 hp regen ammo slot item.
---
It takes a really long time now, like 100 hops in thirty minutes or similar.

oh damn that's sick

Nah fuck that. People stack items hoping for a buff so they can cash out big. Change the book

That's crazy you can have almost 1500 total with only 13m xp.. Nice job keeping your account well rounded! Good luck on your virtual 200m ;P

---
Many 99‚Äôs can be ‚Äúbought‚Äù by spending 100‚Äôs of millions to billions of gold using methods that have extremely high cost/hr. Top tier equipment also costs between 100‚Äôs of million and billions of gold. There‚Äôs also the duel arena where people stake similar amounts of money.  
---
Last I saw on Reddit, gold was about .40 usd per mil, so spending 400 for a bill is a bit crazy but totally inside there realm of what people spend on micro transactions in other games.
---
I mean I could be the fact that you have to basically have a 2nd account just for pking or you're at a disadvantage
---
Gz mate. What was your set up like? I've been putting off fight caves until I can afford blow-pipe (which is now), so thinking of attempting this weekend. Way back in the day I think I did it with 90 range and a crystal bow. Hope BP is as OP as people say.
---
It's not detectable. Thousands of people use it and no one has ever been banned.
---
On average, that‚Äôs probably true. 
---
For the record, I seriously doubt that sang/BP would get a faster time than tbow.
---
Someone send this to DVS for his rarest drop vids lol
---
Get outve here noob
---
the issue is, nowhere you mage do you value that accuracy save for bandos (definitely not meta) or crimson zulrah (which yeah, it's significant there)
---
Now that's how you get some trim.
---
This is just not true
---
&gt; Listen, its clear you havent even tried this. 
---
What? Tried what?? I already use the bank fillers, I know how they function. If you have more than one item you are wanting to 'lock' in your inventory then it's going to take additional steps after to get it back up. If you had different equipment over different tabs then you still need to make sure each one gets deposited back into the right spot.
---
&gt;Again, yeah, this is way more clicks, way less than individually tagging and untagging items. 
---
Sorry, how so? Also, do you have any counter point for the several other concerns I raised about your 'method'?
---
&gt; you act like there was zero thought put into the current system- there was. 
---
Please, please explain to me how my suggestion isn't a direct improvement? 
---
I know the current complicated process to doing this, I never even said it wasn't possible. Just unnecessarily annoying. I don't understand why you are pretending it's out of the question that it could possibly be improved?
---
Honest ignorance here, but what does fally elite do to help with mining?
---
Great chance to just powermine

it's not yet detectable but it definitely will be at some point and it's explicitly "against the rules."
---
1/73 chances
---
I love it Enko!
---
Implying context doesn't matter when u know full well if that exact conversation happened in 2019 you'd be able to go on reddit and beg to be unmuted and supported lol.
---
It's unfortunate that after you max you'll be indistinguishable from a regular player.  Still neat achievement tho
---
Put some respek on his name
---
i believe the delay holds indefinitely and youd then idle log. i'd highly recommend testing it though.
---
Plenty of things fail the majority then go on again to succeed.
---
What you're saying is if it doesn't affect me directly then i dont care about it, regardless if it's right or not.
---
I suppose you also vote no to every pvp poll
---
you can't die x-logging or DCing at Zulrah anymore, so long as you dont try and spam click when you DC. The fight restarts as soon as you have an input in-game after the restore.
---
I support this
---
Doing my first master clue so I‚Äôm training my crafting up to 82 to do this step.
---
imagine having such terrible goblin taste
---
Use those runes to get 31 mage to telegrab ur dick and drag it through a meat grinder.
---
Money making is considered 0 EHP because you can do it on an alt.
---
Since when does RL offer mobile?
---
Group ironmen is target to streamers and you tubers. No other reason to play it, other than clout.
---
It's not even a challenging game mode... It makes things easier.
---
But I will admit, the clan channel settings update and all that along with group iron looks sweet.
---
Pig

When will the poll results shown on the website stop including the skip votes? This has only led to confusion and unnecessary arguments for tons of players when it appears a question has failed when looking on the website, but it passed in reality as the in-game poll ignores skip votes when showing the final result.
---
I know on my old laptop if I pressed the very top right corner it would close whatever was open. Kinda like hitting the x in the corner of the screen. Try avoiding the very top right corner?
---
Why was there no mention tho. Only noticed it cause i saw jase stream it today. I think you guys deserve the positive feedback from it
---
I think this scam is called the chromosome count test
---
Yes yes there's no need to be nitpicky Im sure most people know what I meant when there's only 3 attacks in the game (ranged, melee, magic), and that's obviously not a melee attack. And it's obviously not ranged if you're praying ranged. It's just the only magic attack that hits thru antifire for some reason.
---
Good advice
---
Damn, I just started playing agian only to notice a lot of people "Doubling" and saying visit their youtube channel. Does this only happen in f2p?
---
yes and yes to both questions. They can kind of take down your hp slowly but surely so tanking 2-3 is probably fine just watch your hp. 
---
Also about 25 dragon darts is what got used from my stacks of like 70 so bring around 50 and you'll be good
---
I think only dying in a mimic battle counts.
---
we are all going to die in real life, not all of us will get a 1kc tbow pet drop though
---
I think dismantling can simply be an expansion of existing production skills. They all lack meaningful non tradeable reasons to level them, thus making them pretty much just act as requirements for quests and diaries, and maxing.
---
I'd say herblore is probably in the best spot in this regard. Raids requiring / desiring higher herblore, and now divine potions being a good way to turn a profit by having higher herblore.
---
But I don't see why smithing can't dismantle metal based components, fletching dismantle arrows and range components etc. Etc.
---
What reward / bonus that gives you? Idk, could be a way to regain supplies but some might say that changes the flow of skilling too much. I think the concept is good but it doesn't need a whole skill because we would never actually pass something like invention with all of its augmentations and such.
---
That's crazy! Congratulations, man!
---
Have mercy good sir
---
Too damn many
---
This. I have made so many prayer potions with the ranarrs.
---
Well there have been Area restricted iron men before swampletics, he just caught all the hype. Not to say he isn‚Äôt still a big influence on the project, But he didn‚Äôt invent anything, he reinvented it.
---
There is no evidence anyone has ever gotten that onyx.
---
Does this clan do any learner raids? Or is it usually more for knowledgeable members?
---
40.5 Mil and no groot.
---
Nope it happens at p2p too. Just never trade anyone. If someone seems to be buying stuff for too much, it's a scam
---
*Laughs in "Rust" squeels*
---
Ohh I grow my own pineapples! If y'all didn't know, you can cut the green top off of a pineapple and replant it, and there are lots of better pineapples that you can get besides the ones you find in Walmart. The Kona Sugarloaf is amazing.
---
You mean you bought gp
---
Nice, a little more than half way there!
---
What a noob. I had like 5 99s in 2006-2007.
---
You obviously did not understand my post. Everything was done to make osrs like other mmos and power creep is just one element. 
---
I don‚Äôt expect a bunch of people in their early 20s to get this. You guys just want better graphics and better weapons and armor that hit higher
---
Change world and teleport away and do something else, let him find youüòÇ
---
Hahahaha, thx for the laugh! :P
---
Thank you king, I no longer have to xpw on my alt.
---
It‚Äôs not so hard to come up with a good idea, it‚Äôs hard to execute it well :)
---
Funny how regular luck isn't notable enough to be put on reddit, but extreme good luck and extreme bad luck *is*.
---
Dope
---
Well, since magic trees have yet to have been discovered outside of Runescape.... yew bow ;)
---
I've done a similar thing.. I think I have 89,000 total tracked. But I think my calculations are messed up for the older snapdragon logs. Now I only really care about torstols which is 25,000.

---
At my level they provide the same amount of prayer points but super restores were cheaper at times. It really just depends on which is cheaper at that point. They are usually around the same so I'd just buy one and go with it. Wasting time checking prices for maybe a few thousand gp saved is a bit much
---
Thank you :)
---
I'd quite honestly say a new continent or continuation of an old quest line has gotten more excitement from old friends who don't play anymore than warding, artisan or even sailing got.
---
New skill is like "okay cool but I never even got high level in other skills, now there's another one added into the list?"
---
Old players who've quit likely did for a reason, and not because they ran out of content to do. So new skilling content would only appeal to those who truly love the skilling side of the game (which I myself do. I honestly think sailing was the best offering we had for a skill with potential to be totally new, while feeling old-school, and offering awesome unique rewards and the first ever truly group-based skill in OSRS, similar to dung)
---
Ah.
---
Osrs.
---
Osrs Reddit.
---
Porn.
---
Oh that's a TIL for me then! I really thought they did. Sorry for my confusion there then.
---
Mobile is super good for lots of skills, I personally used it for hunter while maxing, along with afk skills like WC and fish. Sorry if I came off negative was just trying to provide criticism :)
---
Dying is xp waste so try not to
---
disabled as in locked? he needs to recover it.
---
disabled as in banned? he needs to appeal the (assumably) macro ban- theres a page specifically for hijacking macro.
---
Check the latest poll. They are addressing these things at some point.
---
In before "it's photoshopped".
---
Social media post about Bootcamp? Future Moto boot coming right up
---
If you tele away does it count as a death?
---
Hahaha thinking the justice system has anything to do with people changing.  You should look up recidivism rates in the USA.
---
Don't use the 3rd sound bar. Annoying af. You here people fletching and shit
---
it's actually hp cape and rapid regen that don't stack
---
hp cape + regen works, as does regen + rapid heal
---
Look you can't even argue the point because he still acts the same
---
Vorkath cause it was easier to learn, and i had to for quest cape. I have about 300kc on vorkath and 1 on zulrah(diary)
---
Maybe f2p clan wars just isn't popular. I only played it when they first made it f2p because there's different strategies, and as a maxed main you are essentially invincible.
---
Lmao. Welll.... I've got pneumonia so fingers crossed!
---
Check out my other comment on the op. It has ~89k herbs with maybe 1500 runs or so. Some of it was before ultra comp, some after.
---
Dadgum. I think I would have rather afked at barb fish on my HCIM than do this. You got the stuff boy.
---
Did you get back in game?
---
The support website isn't allowing him to appeal sadly. As I understand it, there is an option to do it, but he just gets redirected to a page that says he's been permanently banned without any other options available.
---
Still, thank you for helping!
---
that's a while away, regen is bis mage, also the healing effect is probably really strong coupled with normal 4x regen
---
just YES
---
Wales Gang rise up.
---
Im down but how am i not gonna forget this?
---
I kinda got a CC with friends so :/
---
It helps alot with the gameplay, specially for activities like ToB.
---
Yes, the issue seemed to be to do with me using cellular data, which was strange as this is how I always play RS, when I turned on wifi though, I am now able to play normally. Thankyou for the concern though, much appreciated.
---
they did, with the bounty hunter rework
---
Ya but when did you start playing?
---
haha! iv been thinking of things to do and thats pretty much the only thing that makes sense
---
O
---
runelite patches for last week(?) added an option to their music plugin that mutes those pets, i haven't noticed running into any since but well i guess i wouldn't
---
As another commenter mentioned, it really comes down to the amount of time you have available. You're looking at sub 5 minute games on an official world and 45 minutes for a solo game (with concentration).
---
You're my savior!
---
Ah fuck me lmao. Larrans keysarent bad though, but damn the emblems made it worth it to do wilderness slayer.
---
This is literally just current osrs compared to 2007scape.
---
Except I guess gathering skills aren‚Äôt disabled, there‚Äôs just next to no reason to do them.
---
Yeah 'skulled pvm' its in the post
---
No one talks in this game anymore and if they do It's when they bring their friends with them and speak in incomplete sentenses and lots of cringy acronyms.
---
Bursting monkies I feel is the best xp if money isn‚Äôt a factor.
---
if you don't have the emotes unlocked it is a black pixel
---
The fuck did you just say?
---
Yup, noticed that on my ironman lol
---
Start over make an ironman and you will have more fun
---
No pet, was hoping to along the way but apparently getting 99 w/o it isn't even considered unlucky. Gonna be one I miss out on.
---
My main account hasnt been touch in 6 months and its poor af. I play hcim only
---
Well I doubt you're older than thirty, and yet you still manage to be a complete joke.
---
If you rock cake down then you just let your health slowly regen anyway?  Constantly flicking rapid heal is really why it doesn‚Äôt feel afk to me.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt change the answer much
---
Membership is done in a few weeks (need to get some space from the game) so not sure how good of a friend I'd be haha
---
With unnatural selection does konar not assign a specific area to slay? Got black demons but no location given
---
YES.
---
I would be ok with that.
---
There are no lizardmen on either path. If you get attacked you're doing something wrong
---
That was literally the point of it. 5 minute silly edit y‚Äôall take this so serious lol
---
:) the cc isnt very active at the moment we are a lot more active in the discord as whe hosting raids we scout in ccs etc :) but feel free to join :)
---
A multi-combat area, so if monsters are aggressive, more than one can attack you at one time.
---
She doesnt assign locations no matter what on TL.
---
This is rs3 artwork, so where's the prayer brother that wasn't important enough to get his own barrow?
---
Swampletics
---
May I ask why you suggest to add titan? I posted last night about ways to increase my XP/hr and multiple people told me to get rid of titan due to the extremely high defence
---
I love the super pigmented blue contrasting the white
---
Just more convenient cause you can just keep spamming left click and it does a bit more damage.
---
I just use these
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Harmony_island_teleport
---
Sorry to offend I guess
---
That means you are in a multi combat area. You can attack multiple monsters at knce, and they can attack you all at once as well.
---
its for everyone :) we can take people on learners, we do all aspects of the game :) from pvm to pvp to clan events etc :) join the discord and post ur rsn in the welcome room to get access to the server and you will be able to talk to everyone :)
---
Don‚Äôt blame me when Jagex shows the incriminating evidence to a court of law. You‚Äôll be sorry John.
---
Lol nah dude it‚Äôs the new j mods; I got perm muted by people mass reporting me because I‚Äôm gay and my account was mems since 08; insta deny appeal within seconds. It was because a cc didn‚Äôt like me and 60 ppl reported just over my orientation... I believe this 100% and wouldn‚Äôt have until I was a victim myself. Just wait bro; it could be you next; I had the same line of thinking  b4. Lol; that mindset is gone now; totally different support it actually got worse... than say 3 yes ago and before. I‚Äôd take 2005 support over now üíÄ
---
This is better
---
Huh, TIL.
---
Probably wrong.
---
Would it be possible (possibly for the next league) to have completion of master tasks be announced to nearby players similar to pet announcements?
---
Sorry, forgot that there are lizardmen in Molch. But the other path is perfectly safe
---
But your number doesn‚Äôt make sense.  1/10^10 is something we should expect to see as a community a few times per year.  1/10^12 is something we may see as a community but is not likely.  1/10^18 is something we as a community should never expect to see.
---
I got my first vorki kill today &amp; no one on my cc gz'ed me. I feel it's time to move on.
---
It's not that people can't change it's the prison system that sucks ass in USA
---
Ah that explains it. Thanks
---
h
---
r/ontheledgeandshit
---
redberry yum yum
---
Y double eye patch
---
How do you get that Valuable drop message to come up in chat?
---
Oh cool man glad it‚Äôs all sorted
---
In all fairness I'm pretty sure he's right and it's a US car. Euro models don't have the reflectors in front of the front wheels (which I think are mandatory in the US)
---
so it takes 4 seconds to get to 1 hp instead of 6?
---
Thanks.
---
When I first started playing I would crash people without even knowing it. People would get mad but not say why. I assumed because they wanted the spot all to themselves. That‚Äôs probably why my rng is shit.
---
racist
---
name checks out
---
swamp ass bad
---
Gotum
---
actually funny nice work
---
You wont be able to raid solo but i dont mind teaching you. I went with focus. The 2x xp one is a lot better for points and such but its just not as fun as focus. Some people chose Resilience alond with the prayer one and you pretty much can pray overheads without draining any prayer so its good for that. But raids is so dps focused idk if its worth it.
---
Lul
