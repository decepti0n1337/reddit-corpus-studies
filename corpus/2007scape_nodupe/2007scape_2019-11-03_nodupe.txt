Nice.

I made it for the Falador patch. It was great!!

Gonna lose your hcim status irl all it takes is a split second but I guess you gotta learn the hard way.
---
Its the same cake from the birthday event, it will be removed from accounts like it was before.
---
He means prayer flicking cause no altar
---
What did you do to get it?
---
nice.
---
I've done all the level 5 diary requirements in two days on 306 w/randoms as well. I've only had one walkout, almost everyone else came back after a while. You could  try Casual BA as mentioned here, but I think the best experience is just learning it with randoms. I'd also be glad to take you along for some games.
---
See you at the top brother
---
what's that addy armor gon do without a scimitar
---
yeah but the good thing about rs is you don't have to pay attention while doing boring things like skilling. the problem is fun and engaging content is only really at the endgame so...i guess people just don't have motivation.
---
Hi it's me Deadly Farts
---
Where u at
---
Kurasks/Barrows
---
I mean 40 minutes is really long for a quest with a guide. If you don’t count all the quests that have been made since osrs release, one small favor is one of the longest quests in the game. Iirc the only quests that are longer are mep2, regicide, maybe underground pass, legends quest, desert treasure. I’m probably missing some but compared to the vast majority of quests that can be completed in 10-15 mins one small favor is really long
---
I want cheaper herblore secondaries though
---
Buying bonds
---
It takes 2 seconds to kill them, I've probably  pked about 30m from people bringing cash stacks, runes, teleports, etc.
---

---
And I anti pk while a do clues... none of the pkers expect an ags to wack them.
---
Prayer pots and super restores are about the same.price last I checked. Currently and iron sinfo might be old. Basically you get 4 more prayer points for the same price tho
---
Zulrah can be considerably faster with those levels. Keep at it and upgrade the gear when you can. Blowpipe first.
---
You’ll make some money and learn the boss for even faster kills.
---
Wow, you beat me by 7,395 kc!
---
I got the image from this post https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/dqn8yq/invest_in_this_under_used_format/
---
Worth mentioning as well that RL already removed the plugins Jagex was banning, so as long as you don’t circumvent what RL already offers, you’re fine.
---
I stand by my last week and a half experience of doing it that sacred is worse xp and almost 2x better gp per hour. I told you my own gains. Most people would probably find fishing sacred is more/faster money as well.
---
Never knew I felt this way until I read it. I hate bots and it activates me a lot.
---
So...?
---
? They made a list of banned plugins, and runelite has removed them all
---
How was Underground Pass? :\^)
---
[removed]
---
Seems weird to assume OP is talking about one specific throwaway line instead of the entire second half of the video, but sure.

16 ashes in 17 kills?

Do forget suilscep mushroom woodcutting u get wc exp and them shrooms

no, the 3 part ones are different to sherlock steps

[Here's the context for the big farm run](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dmzvsu/on_november_2nd_be_sure_to_do_your_farm_runs/)  
---
  
---
TL;DR, Big group run in honor/remembrance of OP's mom. Very wholesome
---
\-\_- same. Had to stop a few minutes later though. couldn't get over it.
---
Ok boomer
---
Staking isnt grinding to get money as you say you were doing. Back on the grind!
---
You can get dupes of every pet, but you won't actually receive another one. It just increases the counter in collection log if your pet is still alive and says you would have been followed, or gives you a replacement if you lost it when you died.
---
Zulkath* and Vorrah
---
You didn’t light fires in a 69 pattern restart your account kid.
---
It was actually Friday night around 2:45 am in the morning I literally wanted to cry bc of how tired and angry I was like it
---
and then they fucked
---
7 Karambwanji and 3 Headless Arrows
---
Nice
---
Nice collection log
---
I can show you how to do barrows with tome of fire with fire blast if you'd like. Bit less profit than ibans blast but oh well
---
who?
---
Thanks :D
---
You on im back
---
YEah but historically speaking theyve been below ppots at some points in tome fluctuating pretty constantly throughout the day. So i mean it just depends when the person making the guide bought them.
---
Ty! Gl on your clues
---
If you know someone's stats you can hack their account with no trouble at all.
---
I hope you get that cape of skulls one day :)
---
Shes just a famous streamer
---
At least this one was in color.
---
my membership ran out :( i had a reminder set and everything
---
No need, hunting every pet is already a ridicolous grind you are getting into. Rates like this cant be changed at this later stage..
---
That’s a penis
---
What's the profit per hour of Theatre of Blood these days? All the estimates I see are from when it was first release, but nothing recently.
---
It's .5 a mil now afaik
---
The Bloodveld CentiPad
---
It's under the 'Runelite' setting. Tooltip font to bold from the default of regular.
---
I do the same with extended antifires, since an extra food when you're meleeing Vork is pretty nice
---
I am sorry I could not make it. I was out with my family for a much needed day fishing. However, what you accomplished today was more than a 99 for sure!
---
I think because Jagex cancelled 7 day free membership so now bot owners buy a lot of bonds for their farms.
---
They get scared L
---
But wasn't Drake the musical one so clearly they should swap
---
D4 looks so good! Sadly it sounds like it’s not even close to a release date being announced
---
Mostly used by pures for training strength before they bother doing MM
---
Gz, I totally used tears of guthix to get my rune crafting from 0 to 65 lol
---
Is he missing any skilling pets?
---
HumancentiPad
---
Whats the story here
---
Please and thank you
---
Is there like a discord or forum for best methods on getting pets? I want to start pet hunting and wonder if there's a good play to start.
---
After reaching [base 85s with 85 Mining](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d163rl/officially_14_maxed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) a good little while ago, I’ve gained 45 other levels apart from the 2 Mining levels, including 91 to 98 Runecrafting, and 87 to 94 Woodcutting - doubled my exp in each.
---
What’s next?
---
98 Woodcutting, maybe a little post-98 if I’m near a Firemaking level. Redwoods have exceeded my expectations, and ~60k exp/hour is a refreshing change from ~35k at Blood runes.
---
Following that, I want to push on with Fishing, but I’m pretty uncertain how to level it. I’ve refined my technique at 2t harpooning, managing to maintain ~100k exp/hr, but it is quite RSI-inducing. I enjoyed Infernal eels around 80-87 Fishing but the rates are pretty abysmal compared to Barbarian... though the inventory fills up a bit too quick to effectively AFK on mobile. Need some suggestions!
---
I came back last week on a new account after quitting several years ago and I noticed this pretty quickly. It made me sad.
---
Just got my first one in 60 Kc, cheers brother!
---
*Hand Z*
---
Boom! Hero &lt;3
---
So you can even do them solo?
---
Blast furnace. Quest up ur mining and smithing, grind coal bag, grind bf until you get a bond
---
Lol yeah. Both are wayyy harder. Beating jad is like beating someone in Rock Paper Scissors but there’s only 2 options instead of 3 and they tell you what they are going to chose before they go lol.
---
Thank you! :D  I will not rely on the wiki
---
e
---
do underground pass for ivans staff and get a range of 61 and you should be fine
---

---
That's his mom reincarnated
---
He didn't. He's using other people's money.
---
For someone with 80 in all combat stats what would be a better raid to learn? I'm assuming Chambers of xeric?
---
I solo rev pk daily on stream and don’t have a issue with these bots.... It’s your big +1 items that they’re hunting for.
---
29m xp still waiting
---
Oh that gave me chills. Super wholesome :)
---
Goblin diplomacy might be dumber than shit, but it gives FIVE quest points for doing basically nothing. It’s great.
---
maybe at 10x droprate but below that no thanks
---
Aberrant spectres? Some people dont like them cause they are mediocre exp and you at most profit like 200k if you pick up the good herbs/alchs. Mains should probably block them. Or if they are low weighting for the slayer master you use, just skip.
---
I love doing this task because how afk it can get. Its quite a fast task if you blowpipe + cannon in stronghold dunteon.
---
Bonds lol.
---
Next time just cut out the middle man and play online poker.
---
If you do ever have to go to gambler anonymous society will at least find that more respectful than being addicted to gambling fake-ish money in a children’s fantasy game.
---
CoX is gonna be rough with base 80s, but possible. You'll still be getting carried pretty hard without 95+ str/mage/range
---
Don't touch tob without pretty much maxed combats, if you're learning
---
Babe 2: pig in the city
---
???
---
This. It ain't *that* expensive, and once you have it, you will find yourself using it **A TON** every single day for almost any activity in the game. I actually subconsciously changed my playing style around it to incorporate some part of my POH into everything I do, be it the pool, portal nexus, fairy ring, spirit tree.
---
Construction should be the top priority on any new account. This is actually one of the main things I like so much about OSRS when comparing to RS3. Back when I played RS3, a POH there was absolutely worthless. On OSRS, it is invaluable.
---
Oh fuck, sound the alarms, keep your girlfriends inside, I repeat this is not a drill.
---
Ps - mage cape homie, ya hair ain’t long enough for a man bun.
---
He might be trying to grow another one. 1/50k chance of gf from mithril seeds?
---
How much did you sell your grilfriends for?
---
I'd say prayer/spell reordering is the best example of how a game where every addition is polled and clients clash. Reordering is far from an OP feature and most were fine with it... Yet it still failed a poll and despite that, clients offered and continued to offer it. Jagex does sometimes step in with OP features, but they tend, or tended, to be pretty lax. If they did something like they are doing now from the start, that probably would have helped. But either way, they'd be allowing clients to bypass polls unless they also ran polls for what clients could do.
---
Yea
---
Nice work King.
---
Did my first post-99 farm run @ 3 today for you pal. Best wishes.
---
Yea I could understand if he is saying toxic things and just doing anything possible to disrupt another player
---
But if he was simply attacking him... its the wilderness... thats what happens in the wilderness, thats the whole point of it; you can take someone else out if you hate them
---
Only for it to be removed soon. Tsk tsk
---
Same thing happened to me. Got pet at 955kc at fanatic. Poker showed up and attacked. I didn't even realize pet dropped until I was trying to run away.  Twas a sad day. took another 500 kills at fanatic, but I finally brought one home.
---
Some feet would be nice
---
All jokes aside that guy seems like a dick
---
Young implings also give beginner and easy clues
---
Beast coast
---
Minigames such as pest control. Barrows likely
---
Yes cudgel unless wiki shows a weakness to slash.
---
Missed the party but I did all my runs. Gotta love moms reminding you to do shit.
---
I had to work tonight, but ill def do my runs when i get home.
---
Interesting. I don't follow the RS and lion connection, however that could be personal. If so, send it
---
Yeah, OP, listen to u/Its_All_Me. He posts on r/2007scape and r/realdubstep so he knows what's gay when he sees it
---
Oh
---
(Welcome to the superior game my lucky guy)
---
I wasn't able to make it but I did keep it in mind during my hops run.
---
Awesome. Yeah I'm perfectly fine with not being able to do ToB.
---
Don't! He's going to use it for no no time!
---
I don't know a lot about farming and I'm kinda out of the game recently, but I went and planted 1 tree in honor of your mom. You have all my sympathy and I wish you and your family to be stay strong.
---
Sounds good! Can't wait for my adventure.
---
Lmao how’s your run energy treating you?
---
Not new, but can help with some beginner stuff. I'll PM
---
And I had a great time
---
- coming from the 2nd place guy on the lucky imp leaderboard
---
Ok
---
Couldn't make the official group run, but started farm contracts for the first time today, and did a nice full tree run--even got 60 farming in the process. 
---
Glad to see there was a nice turnout, I'm sure your mom would be very proud.
---
That’s the best way to do quests tbh
---
Honestly, I have to agree. Hate me all you want, but the story seems pretty unbelievable to me. The stories don't line up. It also has all the trappings of a story meant to tug on your heart strings. It's well written, for sure, and that's why it's gained so much traction. But nah. I don't believe a word of it.
---
I'm in this photo and I dont like it
---
Cool!
---
Well, you can still participate in the activity, you just might not be able to pull off a solo. Just like Chambers of Xeric, you can FFA ToB for the items, but you’ll have to get lucky and get them in your name.
---
Plant a real tree make a change.
---
You are one step away from a diary cape and you’re scared to raid? Come now bro, don’t be afraid.

Even some of the worst quest requirements are what, 70’s?
---
I come across a lot of nice people, even when i'm being the quiet one I love when someone strikes a conversation even if I fail at responding with a engaging response some people still add me for at least communicatiing back. I'm still attempting to find a raiding crew at ge, all I run into are the arrogant nerds who scoff at people with a slow jad pb or something similar or ignore me while i ask what gear I should assume for a group while dicking around with a 9k cox clear and a scythe.  
---
Sorry for the wall of text im drunk and angry.
---
Also I’m 25 years old you fucking zoomer.
---
Buy a bond and sell it
---
its like 140-250k/h and u just spam click something. easy as fuck. i could literally run on a treadmill or play a different video game and do it. invest in a different clicking device if u hate clicking with ur index finger
---
Now rc or mining? lmao.
---
Im poor
---
I had a babysitter named tina, she spit on my forehead and called me caddy.
---
Yea, 70 rc no biggie.
---
&gt;Play the game noob
---
No i wont, no lifer.
---
I feel like they dont drop clues and that might be why i blocked them,
---
How many u killing each trip
---
Your rsn is: nutslits.... Not the best editing to hide it
---
Every username is original :p
---
&gt; you will need the gear to not get smacked down by everything in gwd, which means clue scrolls for god items
---
Or just get a god book and cape
---
google "we do raids" discord
---
Bruh you just spoiled it for me. I was going to get to that quest within the next couple of years haha.
---
How to find the gear discord?
---
I generally only play osrs in the background while playing other games like league or wow, or while watching movies etc. Getting into a boring conversation just means you need to stop doing whatever else ur doing and focus on the rs screen, so I rarely turn private on. Just my take
---
Fishing in the bright beaches of catherby, my life will never be so good.
---
I get to hydra and cerb just fine without running out of energy and no stam. Are you not using the shortcuts?
---
it's 13k points for 27 rolls, since the first 500 counts double
---
Anyone can go and put time in at Wintertoldt and make more than the 4 mil you lost. It’s a game, just go play it instead of stressing like you just had a stock crash IRL
---
No that’s how the Reddit community sees it. And we’re all a bunch of retards here. For example, look at all the people who make posts about breaking rules. You might even find them on this thread talking about how they buy gold and justifying it because of the OP. I also see them discussing how to pay less by using a VPN to change your location to a country where membership is cheaper. 
---
Then they turn around and wonder why Jagex needs to make more money from the game and why the devs are underpaid.
---
The wild is dead, you take who you can find. The only truly active spot is rev caves and thats not groups of people its massed clans with 15 people
---
Theirs discord’s for world record times/kc, which most high lvl people post in, so if they have the most usually it gets posted, on the other hand their could be a few people with more who wish to remain annon so they probably do have the highest known kc’s
---
got\*
---
No construction cape?  Peasant.
---
I don't believe you.
---
Wonder how you know that 🤔
---
I found Galvek to be way easier. You don't have to react really, just follow a health bar decreasing. In both cases you do react to fireballs of death, but in Vorkath you get punished much faster for not knowing what to do. Galvek is more of a stat check thanks to its 1k hp and huge defence, but it's not harder.
---
Assuming a crate with 27 rolls, it's (27 C 2) * (1/5000)^2 * (1 - 1/5000)^(27-2) ~= 0.000014, a bit rarer than 1 in 71k
---
Turn sound on. It gives a distinctive sound when he breathes fire. Then you have 2.4 seconds to react properly.
---
correct if you had a crate with only 2 rolls, OP is doing solos so he's likely getting a lot more
---
C Engineer as well
---
I’m just kinda pissed, I got like 40 fire making and membership ends tomorrow night
---
last I checked scythe uncharged is still 2nd best melee dps at olm hand and range dag so there's that.
---
Any equipment that has a stable price is worth it. If you buy it and then just do 200 kills and re-sell it without the price suddenly dropping, you basically didn't pay for it, just loaned it for a few hours.
---
Cute butthole dude no homo
---
How is a story of a mom playing a video game to bond with her child and eventually passing away from illness unbelievable in any way? Cancer is so common and there are so many people that things like this are bound to happen. There is no cost or consequence for showing some sympathy. There is no benefit to being a skeptic in this scenario.
---
Bots have no affect to me at all lol. And I could not care less about any of the devs.
---
I'm same level using duradaddy and I block wyrm,fire giant, hellhound,  spiritual creatures, and greater demons.

Cough auto weeder cough.

Have you ever considered pures do the Varrock easy diaries to last longer at crabs?
---
https://imgur.com/6fJLX3F
---
No actually. The first 150ish were done with a blowpipe, then next 365 or so were done with the dragon hunter crossbow. I just got bored of the ranged method so I switched it up to melee and got the pet about 5 kills in. The obsidian legs aren’t noticeably worse than tassets in my experience, and the bonuses from the salve amulet don’t stack with the bonuses from the slayer helmet which makes the torture better on task.
---
Love it!!
---
Too bad my membership just ran out.
---
Did u just assume my sexuality?
---
Construction 99 is not rich Af, cus my bank is empty.

I grew up on a farm and we used these all the time.

Pouring one out for you, my dude.
---
Pretty sure they are friends though, at least C Engineer and Framed, they help each other pking.
---
Demonics on-task and Cerb are both 5m gp/hr at max eff, so slightly better than Vork. Solo raiding is the best you'll get, it's like 6-7m gp/hr
---
Na bro make the special be used to smack wintertodt, make it do like 5% damage (scaling with amount of players). And make it give like 250 points or smth, ez fix
---
Nope and no current plans AFAIK he is going for all easy and med clue items then pets now
---
There's a blue jad phase?

Iirc there's a bug in resizable when you use the fixed device on the colored sheep in ardounge that completely breaks the quest

You should look into it. The guy you responded to is kind if right, but also probably doesn't know the situation either. The mother said things to him like, "monsters eat little boys." As well as dressing him in girls clothing without him saying he wanted to wear it. Seemed very much so the mother was the one making the choice. Personal beliefs aside, no one should ever coerce or force a child into a position like that. Also, i think he is ~8yo. 
---
The mom said something like his favorite superhero is a girl(iirc starfire from teen titans go) and reasoned that's why he want's to be female.
---
There was an ongoing legal case for a few months, there's plenty of info about it. I can't remember the exact outcome, but I believe the judge ordered the parents must work together and iirc gave the dad more custody.
---
Google OSRS boss highest kill counts and look for Jagex's twitter posts (often by Former Mod Lottie). 
---
There isn't actually a "highscore" at all, but these people can prove that they're Rank 1/Rank 10 by showing their current KC and showing that it matches these statistics.
---
Not sure that works. I did chaos ele for a bit, and anytime the chaos ele hit another player running past, I wouldn't get the loot because it counted as someone else tanking. I believe the ironman has to take a certain % of the hits to get the loot (assuming of course they do all the damage), and since you're in a safespot you don't get hit.

Trust the DPS calc. There are a lot of factors (What boost you're using, prayers, darts in blowpipe, or if you're using tbow, etc.)... But the DPS calc is going to tell you what's best for your exact situation.

You're the one being shitty here. I just believe that we should put more effort into trying to fix the mind's view to fit the body, rather than fit the body to the mind's view.

They can do what they want though, the problem is when they tell me that I have to recognise them as something they're not.
---
Trans people exist, but there is no medical procedure or drug that can change your sex. Come back when some futuristic chromosome therapy is invented
---
Find something you enjoy or move on. Personally I can't stand skilling anymore, which kinda sucks since I'm 2200+ total and really want to max... But if I skill for 20 minutes I just wanna log off. Really enjoy raiding tho, so that's what I do. But if you aren't getting any enjoyment out of any part of the game, then there's really no reason to play. You can always come back later, and everyone needs a break some times.

I understand you meant the mobile release when talking about the "early days", but the same thing happened when 07 came out in 2013. I even recorded tut island completion on the first day (within first hours of release) and it was *packed*. Within a few weeks it really did feel like old runescape without the GE and noobs roaming the world.

I really hate to be the one to break it to you, but there is a medical procedure that can change one's sex, and it is appropriately called a sexual reassignment surgery.

Make sure the time, date and time zone are all set accurately on the device where you have the Authenticator app installed.

Or enable the option in the Authenticator app to take the time from an Internet time server, if it has that.

If you reached 500+ total level you can ware zamorakian monk top an bottom and you can climb up that ladder..  You will find 1 monk up there.. Just kill him and you can get about 6 wines before he spawn again... Also after he die you can take tge wine with your hands no need for magic.

Almost as big as when you found out RS stood for RuneScape.

I refuse to deal with it

There is no bots doing this method just players so try to find empty world for yourself :)

That's no longer true as of the coin pouch update. Master farmers with left click pickpocket can't be trapped in one location, and ardy knights you can't *just* left click because you have to open the pouches every 28 picks.

Good idea :D

The yellowish green ones are papaya.

I feel like he should have used sq'irk fruits, hence the thieving grind mentioned in the title, but OP didn't want to put actual effort into this post.
---
Prospector. The sack is kinda low priority cause you just have to bank less, get it last (unless you have no use for gem or coal bag)
---
Oui
---
Agility is like 8 an hour, I’m not sure what killing the warriors/stuff in the slayer dungeon is
---
Ok thanks. I was hoping it would be the fashionscspe option, kinda feeling like the odd one out over here at the mine atm.
---
Same. That one hit close to home...
---
Do you get nervous every time you're in that situation? sounds like it happens a lot
---
You can buy some of the materials (crystal armor seeds) to make the armor but you have to complete song of the elves and earn crystal shards to make the armor. You need (I think) 300 shards and 6 crystal armor seeds. Also requires I think 76 smithing and 76 crafting?
---
Gust get that 99 and you will change your mind, you can afk Master farmer and get 1.3m+/hr.. Or 1.2m/ 100k exp   ;)
---
Prospector to do the diaries then sell back and buy what you want
---
I didn't come to the official farm run because I had errands to run, but that day I did 452k exp worth of just farm runs, no tithe farming at all. That's my new record.
---
I wouldn't want to talk to someone having an orgasm over seeing my name tbh
---
Yes, 2013 release was great, but the player count peaked only with release of mobile. Also, back in 2013, there was not that many well estiblished players and there wasn't much high level content. The game felt less complete. With release of mobile, you literally had every type of player logged in. The whole map was filled. I personally came back and started a hardcore ironman.
---
Took me 436 u don’t have my sympathy lol

If the burners have different sizes and effects its understandable to not choose bottom right since you want the biggest area and highest heat. Gas stoves are not popular here but I have 2 Electric stoves, 1 induction top where every "burner" has the same heat and surface area and one older stove that has 2 big and 2 small borners where bottom left big burner and top right small burner has an extra "gear" where they get hotter than the other ones, on this one I use bottom leftthe most for the extra heat and surface area.
---
I got 450 kills without any unique gl fam

Don't fucking stream then, he still did something that is absolutely against the spirit of the game mode LOL fuck off man

If you have attack skill cape, yes you can go straight to d defender. Wiki explains this

Confirmation bias in regards to thinking the playerbase is all about efficiency because of this subreddit. This subreddit thinks they represent the entire playerbase where as that isn’t the case at all.
---
Have you ever cleared weeds with a scythe in your life?
---
Stock up on essence beforehand.
---
Basically wear an air tiara and pickaxe. From rally bank near the mining guild, put a ton of laws and water runes in inventory. Fill the rest of the inventory with essence. On your way to the Crafting guild, craft the inventory of air runes from essence (takes an extra 5 seconds). Afterward walk to the Crafting guild and mine the silver, hop until full. Once full do a Fally Teleport with your newly crafted essence and repeat. You could also just smelt the bars as soon as you tele because you end up right next to the Falador furnace.
---
Basically got a decent rc lvl in f2p (45-50?) just training crafting for Power ammy.

Sir this McDonald's is no place for your thesis.

Holy fuck
---
Some of these just sound like jealously...
---
It's just that it's so expensive that you run out of money getting max.
---
2nd would be chin in mm1 cave surely?
---
This is REAL i got 99 fm from it
---
even though I don't have a rune or dragon defender?
---
recently did reanimate dragons to max. I used extended anti+DFS/DHL, barely took any damage. Rarely was I lower than 90 hp per trip.
---
potted super combats/extended anti at bank and only brought house tabs (pool/fairyring/bank)+ pouch
---
Yeah I hate it, but it's my only option unless I want to play at 10fps on a 10 year old computer.

&gt;Like Fishing but easier

Does the pet protect over stuff like potions and food?

This picture warms my heart ...what a way to honor your mom's memory! I did several farm runs yesterday in the am and later at night for your mom....unfortunately had to be somewhere in the afternoon so I couldn't make the group run but it looks like it was fun....I'm sure your mom was smiling down on you! Hugs!
---
If you’re going for 99 you’re gonna hate life doing extra stuff like the staff and antifire. Get a dfs, don’t use the staff and you don’t need a spec weapon since you have lance. You should just one shot them a good amount of the time. Pray piety and just let it run down and refill when you get home and bank at seers like you said. I dropped 6 at a time when I did it so you can just reanimate it off the ground instead of having to run to the right spot every time. Also I’d bring the cannon, it will speed it up a pretty decent amount on those times when you miss with the lance. You won’t use too many balls either. 
---
Just finished the grind myself a month ago and felt like it was so much more relaxing when I started doing it how I described above.
---
You mean Lotr with that mithril chainbody Bilbo gave to Frodo?
---
Don't play RS anymore but it was a huge part of my teenage years, seeing the original post and then this one truly warmed my heart💕
---
I didn't know there was a word but I did one alone.
---
These are from the fruit stalls you donkey
---
Yh I was saying cmb only money making. I know there are better gp/hr methods that are noncmb at low levels, but some players just want the cmb options.

Or mage of zamorak is swamp man as he came 1st.

The difference is when you die your normal whip will be at your grave for an hour. With a lava whip it stays in your inventory along with your 3 most expensive items and other untradables. Not a huge deal as you can get to your grave really fast but if you died in gwd and needed whip to get back in and kill count it might be more beneficial.
---
Edit: in PVP if you lose your whip by not protecting item or having it not in your 3 items while unskilled, you lose the whip when you die and ornament disappears
---
Yea most of people with rare names like this are full on introverts or just plain rude
---
Nah not really...if you use a third party (up to you) you can see bank value and if you remember you can look at how much it drops
---
That's fucked.
---
Its probeably bought name tbh
---
lmaoooo. 19k pts on your 6th cox. i still die to olm like 4 times per raid. smol brain
---
I don't know
---
And it's all deleted
---
Over half your skills have to be 90+ in order to get the diary cape. It may not be extremely close, but odds are if you're invested enough in the game to have 12 skills at 90+, do all quests, and get the chompy kills needed (not to mention the rest of the laundry list of non-skilling reqs), it's safe to assume you're also invested enough to max.
---

---
I had enough nuggets to unlock full prospector and the upper level by 72 mining, so I disagree. If you won’t have enough for the upper level when you hit 72, sure, the upper level upgrade is more important.
---
Im really sorry i couldn't go, membership ran out on Halloween :(

How can you 1 tick cut trees while typing. I always play with chat off and render everyone off aswell. best xp.
---
It’s supposed to be a smiley but it looks like shit since each eye should be two vertical fruit.
---
Whoever does most damage gets the drop and usually you talk before going about how loot is being split.  Its generally a 2,3,x-way split or free for all where whoever gets the drop gets the loot.  Splitting is much more common though.
---
Ags gmaul actually isnt that easy to 1tick.
---
Bro get some karambwaji, sharks are expensive
---
I can't stand mlm, so I was either going to do blast mine or 3 tick granite. But most people play for casual fun, and watch shit while they play or play other accounts or play at work so mlm is just viable for any situation. Plus, who really wants to mine and drop 200,000+ ores/granite.
---
CrytpoChris is right but people will downvote him to oblivion still. Of course transgenderism is a mental health issue. If it were not, trans individuals wouldn’t have the highest suicide rate of any group. It’s not wrong to say we focus on the mental aspects of the issue, it could literally save lives. So fuck getting internet brownie points to mimic the right politically correct jargon. People are dying. It is affecting people’s minds first and foremost.

I was playing league of legends, and noticed xeraths dance is technoviking. I was so happy.

You don't crystal bow with the armor at hydra, you're using at hydra because it's the best prayer armor with good range bonus.
---
Infinite? How woke of you.
---
Tell me what Hijra in India or Two Spirits in Native American cultures are then if not genders?  
---
ALso you can get 2 Herblore, you just gotta use a boost to get to 3 before you make a potion. Alternatively using Antipoisons on green Broodoo victims.
---
No doubt
---
Wait so bring range cape for hydra?
---
Why do you artistic folk always put the markers you use in the photo?
---
Even with addy darts fletching is faster... I think someone got 1-99 fletching in like 3 or 4 hours, you can get insane XP rates with darts
---
Luckily those godless heathens only care about RS3 for the moment.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think everything is protected over the pet. So you need to make the pet your 4th item then throw protect item on.
---
Assembler, offensive bonuses &gt; defensive bonuses for making money 99.9% of the time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The niche situation being if range skillcape somehow extends your trips and lets you reliably get multi-kill trips where with assembler you typically only get 1 kill per trip.
---
I feel so called out for the mage cape one lol. I was so cheep I would still walk to the ancient altar to change spells before Tob until 99 mage.
---
Btw?
---
Can someone please explain slayer streaks to me? I use Runelite and it said my streak was back to 0 despite getting all my tasks from Vannaka. Any ideas? Is there a specific time they last for and then reset?
---
Dumb noob who needs to show of 😂
---
There will be a time that comes where, for whatever reason, you’re forsaken from getting an item you really want. That is when you will remember these boots; however, you will feel some type of anger. This anger will manifest itself and make you spiteful. You will return to reddit, aged and bitter. No newcomer will ever be happy again. You will preach that they will need to be alched, that they shouldn’t be happy out of spite and finally you realize.... You’ve become what everyone else already was when you started. The cycle repeats
---
Awesome that's good to know thanks :)
---
On my hcim I did sack - upper level - prospector and had a wayyy better time than on my main.
---
What is ehp?
---
Not an artistic person, but I assume it's to eliminate the question "what kind of markers you used?"
---
It’s done manually if the group agrees but be aware so it worth ppl you trust not to bounce with the drop
---
Guess it depends on how weak and tiny u are,  the back burners are for tall men, the left burners are for those who are strong enough to use their non dominant hand to place things far away.  i use the bad left because i am 6 foot and weigh 240 lbs of pure muscle, anyone using the front right is a tiny manlet and pathetic lmao!
---
Feel better now that you got that off your chest champ?
---
It is good exp/h, best after granite
---
I think it’s like RC or hunter where it’s shit until a certain level.  Like 1-60 blows. After that it’s not too shit. Hunter has birdhouse which saves it.  Rc you can pay runners which sucks but helps a bit.
---
Yup lol
---
oh man, that would be so good
---
He's too cool to be seen with these nobodies.
---
Not for xp, which is what he meant.
---
You could just make it 75 attack, but the guy you're responding too is right. Getting into pking on a med lvl will be difficult. You'll be fighting other meds and maxed mains. On top of that, making a viable med lvl isn't quick. I also suggest making a pure and practicing on him while afk training this account. Eventually you'll feel comfortable on a pure and this account will be pk ready.
---
discord . gg / FXPUrUp

Making a viable 50 attack pure takes like a week if you don't play much
---
Zulu actually started something similar on Twitter. For every 1m WC xp you have you donate trees.
---
I hate this fucking game. Over 700 cox kc and no tbow splits either. 200+ tob and no scythe or rapier either. My luck is literally garbage.
---
Well yeah, he's a banker.
---
OP. I saw this last night and totally realized I forgot. The ironic part is that morning I went to a friend's funeral service. I wrote a poem if you'd like it man.
---
Same, except I've never actually done RC so I can't say. But yeah, agility, thieving, and mining are my least favorites.
---
I could use 122 zulrah scales. Gz
---
But do you have pets or a muta?
---
It's the part where I have 1k raid kc and zero tbow splits and my fuck boy friend has 22kc, the pet and a tbow split already. I fucking hate the reward system in this game at its core.
---
No and no
---
You could try playing another game for awhile? If you do make an Ironman because of burnout, I recommend not going for efficiency. Like ya, wt to 99 fm is the recommended path, but you don't have to follow it, and I can't imagine doing wt that many times in a row would exactly rekindle anyone's passion for anything.
---
I have 2 questions for this 
---
1. How old are you now?
---
2. If your not 11, why did you keep this paper for an extended amount of time?
---
I have 1 dhcb split in my 700+ raids and it wasnt in my name
---
further away means less splatter on my clothes and less chance of it falling to the floor and ruining the whole meal! also the corner of my kitchen is on the left side, so top left is meta for least splatter on stovetop
---
Every so often I see people with 1 letter names...
---
Preach
---
You should try ironman. It would be a lot better on your wallet and it's a lot more enjoyable than staking. The non-ironman trap has always been duel arena, it really is the cancer of this game.
---
Y fletch?
---
Dude?!? Wtf do you think I am a no lifer? I can't do 20 minutes of farming a day PLUS my 4 hours of bankstanding! There's just not enough hours in a day!
---
We've all been there.
---
Thats the canadian equivalent of fuck off.
---
I thought it was 100m trees

Yeah making 100-500k a herb run is so gay, imagine spending 3 minutes doing 8 patches :o

It's like 75 cents a mill if you use bonds as you're rwt basis for conversion. But that just good for us and jagex not the venezualians.

Congrats!! I'm currently on the POH grind as well and I just hit 81 construction this morning. 
---
If I'm trying to get Nexus and pool and all the POH upgrades for PVM/ QOL, would you recommend getting only 82 (and get lucky with spicy stew boosts) or maybe get higher construction level first?
---
I have 11 I missed my free karma post a while back

Thank you, I ended up just temporarily disabling the Authenticator so that I could get in

BIS for hops patches /s

Set small goals that are achievable and then from the steps leading up to finishing that goal I usually discover an avenue I want to explore of the game for my next goal.

If by back in the day you mean in rs2 it was definitely more than that

Straight up def noob
---
Haha awesome.
---
just accept that you'll probably plank at first, that's just part of learning the game. Just try to focus on getting the right prayers/standing in right places at first so you won't instantly plank though. Also watch YT vids there are lots of guides out there. asukayen has vids for pretty much all bosses
---
get 83 and then boost to 91 for the final jewellery box
---
One of us! One of us!
---
the joke is that no matter what people say 95% of the content of the game is non-pvm related content. honestly you should be concentrating on getting skills and doing what you actually enjoy.
---
you arent enjoying bossing partly because you're probably 10 defense levels below most people doing that content
---
I need a 3rd party client to tell me to move so it dorsn't matter :p
---
I wish you luck my friend 🙌
---
Addendum: maybe 35 def to be useful for existing 34-35 def accounts with Rune Gloves after accepting Monkey Madness xp reward. Either one (30 or 35) would be interesting and help diversify the scene a lot if the armor set has a high prayer bonus. Picturing the Black Knight version of the Temple Knights armor.
---
Mage tank armor. Magical accuracy bonus of mystic(maybe more but not less), melee defense of barrows, moderate amount of mage defence and very poor ranged defense.
---
With magic countering melee there should be at least one set of high level mage armor that can tank melee at the expense of accuracy.
---
Reddit username checks out

First I thought it was a cake/marzipan figure and I was disappointed to learn it wasn't. It's still a great model though 10/10.
---
why even make this comment
---
Those are copics which are super nice so could be a flex
---
Not rlly tho what the other commenter said is I'm sure the reason
---
Ye man i enjoy my ironman and the early game is probs the best part of it. Could follow a guide like i did or forge your own path. It’s well worth it. Maybe give it a month and see how you like it. I did that and now i play my iron more than my main
---
censor your name/stats next time, knowing your username, hp and prayer level is enough to recover the account.
---
I think I’ll give it a shot, thank you
---
I frickin love asukayen
---
That's so goood :3
---
New account or max out
---
So, pretty decent then?
---
Yeah.. eventually I'll git gud
---
Proud of you buddy!
---
Wouldn’t a 40 defence requirement just make it the new rune pure armour? Unless it had like a 70 pray requirement.
---
You really need 94 mage if you have 70 def. For vengence 
---
If you get 94 mage and a bit higher str you should be able to pk! 
---
Try alching addy/mith/steel platebodies and green/blue/red/black d hide bodies
---
U can alch them for +-150 gp profit.
---
MMOs are (mostly) old news and RS especially is grindy AF as pointed out. Hard to say how much of the mobile bandwagon was just returning players and not even new customers. There's a fine line between maintaining your core playerbase and attracting new ones. I think Jagex is at a decent point in terms of keeping existing players happy while also slowly edging towards new markets with an arguably easier and more content-filled game then we had a few years ago. I'm certainly no exception, I only came to 07 because I was an existing RS player and got bored of my RS3 account. If I never played RS, period, before.. it's not likely I'd have enjoyed 07 as much.
---
If I'm going for the level 92 portal nexus, do I need to first build the level 72 (marble) and then upgrade to 82(gilded) and then upgrade to 92(crystalline)?  
---
I have never build one yet and want to make sure I'm doing it correctly before boosting.
---
Isn't it even cheaper doing super combats? When I did 90-99 super combats were occasionally like half a gp profit per xp.
---
took me til 1401 to get a BP, then got another at 1415... fuckin game lmao

It's already established in the lore that some justiciars sided with the enemy and dyed their armour, so that's perfectly fine imo

Dan "got a daughter, better hide her" Schneider

Can’t expect to be a pro first try or even second or third try, gotta practice. For something like boss fights you have to try and keep trying, you can’t take long breaks in between attempts otherwise the next time you go the jitters will be back. I’d say throw yourself at fight caves until you beat it. I ran out of food supplies my first attempt one wave before jad, my second attempt I died to jad from misclicks with a few supplies left and then my third attempt I not only beat jad but I still had 6 brews and 2 restores left. My point is the more practice you have with it the better you will get. And don’t take guides you watch on YouTube as gospel sometimes they’ll tell you to do things and yes they will be the most efficient way to do them but that doesn’t make them the easiest way. For example when the healers come a lot of guides tell you to get all of the healers on you and attack jad but I found it much easier to attack one healer and focus on prayer switches while killing that one healer then move on to the next until all of them are dead sure this made the fight last longer but i took basically no healer damage cause it was only one at a time and it was so much easier to maintain switches. Basically what I’m trying to say is use guides as a base line and then practice and figure out what works for you this is the best way to go about getting better.
---
Yes you have to upgrade it like you would upgrade the pool
---
He big boy, he legal

Grats stranger

made \~130m afking master farmers over the course of 6 months. got 99 thieving. got an okay-ish bank.
---
Wait you can burn your branches without fletching?
---
Seems kinda pointless... I'd rather have the jar just automatically drop at 1000kc rather than taking 1000kc to fill up. I don't want to waste an inventory space whenever I do a boss just to eventually have a useless jar.
---
Sometimes ill go to the ge and ask if the ge is down or not working, usually gets someone.

Upgraded prosy type set?
---
I see
---
Isn't this simpsons?

Then stop paying if you cant play. If the problem was a 5 minute fix and super easy the multiple teams with degrees in computer programming would fix it. Theyre doing their best. If thats not good enough for you, unsubscribe.
---
Congrats lad.
---
You sure you haven't just filtered the message or have been on clan/public chat instead of all/game?
---
Yes... but Cezzie has done a lot of Pokemon mashups
---
Not necessarily, it could be a special armour type had certain bonuses against bosses inside the raid only.
---
Are you not allowed to mark tiles anymore then?
---
Nope
---
1kc mole slippers from beginner clues on both me main and my pure
---
Agree something with 20 or 30 def could be nice. Definitely an option to keep the armour valuable and useful while also limiting powercreep on high-end gear. Variety in PvP is good and give players a reason to go for a slightly different build than the standard 1 def/45 def pures.
---
As for its stats I'm not entirely sure, but accuracy melee armour hasn't really been explored before, also maybe add a small str bonus for wearing the full set?
---
??? Winter todt? And that was a year ago
---
Oh that's awesome thanks!
---
If you could I'd appreciate it whenever you get the chance!
---
How about only adding this armor set and not feeling the need to offer 10 other uniques that weren't necessary in a single update? 
---
Never understood why raids had to come with like 12 bis items plus bis prayers, then as if that wasn't enough they added preserve and the dragon uniques too. For absolutely no reason. 
---
Bit of a rant yeah I'd love this armor but stop shoving so many new items in to new updates if they aren't necessary or don't actually have a niche to fill. (Case and point: dragonstone armor).
---
I was on a similar boat as you. I know pretty much most things about OSRS and know what's BIS, what's the most effective way to train etc. 
---
I started soloing GWD a few weeks ago and I was getting 1-2 kills per trip. The more you practice the easier it gets. Now I'm comfortable most bosses except for COX and TOB which I haven't attempted yet. Practice!
---
Just give it +100 to all stats and be done with it.
---
if i didnt love the game i wouldnt pay them anymore but cant stop playing i tried twitter support too they never reply back anymore they just dont care coz they know we are a minor group that have this bug
---
Imagine splashing in this though. Tough choice
---
The later you get 99 Agility, the more value it loses. You're 100% right. This also means you should max Fishing first I guess. Been fishing for a week now and just passed 14m Agility. I'm not a rank hunter at all.
---
Hey if cheating makes it fun for you its whatever, but dont act like it took you hard work to get there. Btw cheating negates your "winning" no matter how you want to twist it.
---
Honestly all items crash because absolutely nothing leaves the game, safe death mechanics are so bad for the game, items only come in nothing comes out.
---
I play a f2p ultimate. I’d be happy to give advice if you’d like.

i was *trying* to have a good time cutting down willows on this new defense pure in the f2p pvp world for no competition and this absolute legend wandered in, called me and this dude i met "botes" and then tried attacking me
---
i aint gonna bitch about being attacked in a pvp world, thats the risk i have and im not concerned about dying on this account, but i am personally offended by being called a bot
---
I started playing with this account when the mobile app first came out in November of 2018. I became a member in March of 2019. I stopped playin last month for a bit after reaching lvl 70 mining and trying to log back in someone has changed my email address and added an authenticator. I remember what the bank pin I used but am unsure if that matters at this point. I looked up my account online and it looks like they have been using a bot to train thieving (I never trained that skill and am now lvl 90). I filled out an account recovery ticket but am wondering if anyone has any other suggestions to recovering my account. The picture is the only screenshot I have from when I was playing.
---
Bankers make bank
---
You clicked on something without ever realizing you fucked up, doesnt matter if you accept it or not, it's the only way.
---
Agreed.
---
You can statically mark tiles yourself, such as this. They removed the illegal options from runelite in their patch when osrs released a statement. The bad tile markers were dynamic ones which runelite set for you to help defeat bosses such as the raids 2 fight
---
Oh because you got some mining levels
---
A water monkey

Depends which combat style you use most, and you can always sell one and buy another

I want this as a tattoo lol no joke I love it.

oh psh, considering how long ive killed him im past that. Im already at a dhcb with pegasian boots and a dfw. I'm just continuously killing him for the pet and potentially reaching 99 in the process.

It looks out of place same with the chainskirt it's missing something in the front, can't really view the back with the cape on. Besides that it looks pretty decent but still a recolored justiciar set imo maybe better as a ornament kit from clue scrolls.

First trip and first batch of Dust Devils on my remake, never got anything even remotely rare on my other accs. Didn\`t even know how rare it is before checking the drop rate and it was the first thing that i saw on the ground. (Probably was first of 5 kills or even the first but needed to finish the batch to check the log)
---
As everyone says, practice. We all struggled at the start but the beauty of runescape is that learning one thing prepares you for something else, I learned how to change prayer and armors from demonic gorillas and i took what i learned there and went to zulrah. Now i'm pretty confident in most bosses. Keep at it and eventually you'll get it and gain some experience on the way. You'll get it.
---
no competition on the trees
---
This is beyond dope and I'm tripping balls. Where'd you get that?
---
$20 is $20.
---
If you're doing slayer range is pretty good for most tasks so go for the anguish
---
Mod West, we still want the headlamp helmet too!!
---
TBH if you can't afford members you probably have issues in your life far more important than late game OSRS.

It’s a good thing it’s not bankable, because my hoarder ass brain was tempted to keep it as a collectors item

Did you click on any shady links? You might have been phished

Lore wise it makes sense. Although it does make it a little weird I still enjoy it

Well i started a new job last month and the first paycheck was only 1 week worth and thats all I got for october, should be fine in november but i have some over due bills so I would say december is where its going to stabilize. And I had to spend 600$ for feet orthesis for the job
---
I have them available on my etsy for $9.99. 
---
Shop name: **OSRSTuffs**  i cant post links automod deletes the comment.

Have a good trip man :) hope you're using the buddy system and not tripping alone.

I would buy this

Still one of my favorite 99 capes, congrats.
---
Hi guys, I was wondering if there exists a resource that compares EHP for f2p skills between f2p and members.
---
It seems pretty niche but occasionally I play on an account that used to be members with 1700 total level and even though I don't play enough to warrant getting members right now I'd still like to know which f2p skills are the best use of my time comparatively.
---
If anyone knows the answer, or knows of a resource which could help, it would be appreciated.
---
Thank you!
---
Looks like a Warpriest or Battle mage, IDK but could fill some weird pure niche
---
Lol nice play on words
---
Haha thanks man!
---
MTX bad.
---
Thanks!!
---
They're guessing/lying/clickbaiting
---
How did you access the game's 3d models? I might want to print some  myself.
---
Because it’s obvious if they do release the armor it’s gonna be a Zamorak spin on justicar armor. Or they wouldn’t release it. It’s going in the guidelines that make jagex content
---
Perspective I suppose
---
You’re like MrNoSleeps cousin..... MrNoNaps

i liked the helmet when it wa more pointy.

i like the shoulders.

i dont like the crown on the helmet.

Thank you, hopefully 99 strength doesn't take ages Haha

I've really enjoyed my account actually

Crazy I’d be jelly if I didn’t have a completed log. Gz on early drops

Jagex releases the highest kc once in a while. They don't list usernames but it's easy to tell if you're number 1.
---
*you eat the kebab, it wasn't very good
---
Range is king in this game so you'd usually go for an Anguish since blowpipe is used a lot during bossing. Torture is good if you do a lot of slayer with melee, and Tormented is good if you do a lot of Zulrah. I'd just figure out what activities you plan to do a lot, and purchase items based on that. You can also just sell one piece of jewelry and buy another when you need it.
---
What if the markers are comically large?
---
Yeah I'm a regular account so I bought cballs when I needed them

Did you bote your defense?

Yeah, it does look like you’re not alone, I saw another thread saying Jagex is working on it

I cannoned each and every task I did, I made sure to not do certain quests so that my task list was very small. And I just purchased my cballs from the ge when needed! Anything else? :)

95% of the abuse I get in the wildy is from pvmers

Indeed you may be very proud! Especially of having pretty even base stats most leave runecrafting insanely low.

This is actually pretty clever and follows along with the whole Zamorakian thing really well...

I agree his name gets beaten to death, but there is not much arguing he is one of the most prominent creator's in the history of the game

I am confusion

You mean the lettuce cape isn't the best?
---
Thats an assload of people
---
It looks like evil Justiciar armor.  So maybe it can do something like the opposite of Justiciar?  Like it makes you take extra damage (that will hit through prayers) but it can give you something like a 20% damage boost
---
I almost forgot that claws below Dragon existed
---
F! I missed it! I got 99 farming at 3pm yesterday too! Wtf. I’m sad now. I waited to get 99 farming for this they also. Didn’t know you guys were all getting together.

Okay thanks, guess I'll focus narrows more

and two of the coolest pets imo, thats awesome dude good shit.
---
it would be really cool if there was like a master level quest that requires like dream mentor and tower of life where the one dude from nightmare zone renovates the tower and lets u fight bosses there
---
I think the zamorak symbol looks good, just not on the chest. Perhaps on the shoulder pieces it would be more fitting.
---
Corrupt degrade to dust PvP armour. 30 def req. 20% PvP dmg bonus as set effect.

i just don't like the crown on the original helmet or the cloth on the body for the original design
---

I'm terrible at bosses too I have tried the fight caves like 5 times and never got it done.  Ive killed Zulrah once to get the hard diaries done.  I get wrecked at the Kalaphite queen almost instantly.  I still have found some bosses to do and you can definitely learn them too.
---
The giant mole is the easiest.  Literally if you die it's because you forgot to pay attention.  Go and do that.  There are Obor and Bryophyta that you should try, you just have to get the keys.  The mimic can also be learned after only a few tries if you ever get him on an elite or master clue.  The deranged archeologist (on fossil Island) and Sarachnis aren't hard to learn at all.  With the deranged archeologist you just mage him and move when he throws his books.  Sarachnis, you just have to change to protect from range when he hisses and kill the mage spider when it spawns.  If you have the farming level, the Hespori can be done pretty easily.
---
You're thinking that the only bosses that exist in the game are the big bosses that drop the BIS equipment but it's not true.  There are plenty of other bosses that will help you learn basic mechanics of boss fights and improve your reactions in the game.
---
The easiest big boss to learn in my opinion is Vorkath.  Her patterns are a lot easier to learn than Zulrah and she's pretty fast to get to so it can be repeated much faster than Jad. The only thing is you need to have beaten Dragon Slayer 2.  But the good thing is during DS2 you get to fight her on easy mode so you learn the strategy without as big of a punishment
---
A big thing I did to help was get 99 prayer.  For me it meant one less thing I had to pay attention to because my prayer was likely to last the entire fight.  Another thing is I feel for learning bosses the ring of life is underrated.  For instanced fights it can save you from either losing your gear or having to pay the fee to get it back.

gotta watch out for when they do the fish planting charity.

Bringing the Bandos doesn't make sense in that case

Question about slayer unlock order:
---
I already have:
---
* superiors
---
* block list set up the way i want
---
* extended dust devils
---
* slayer helm
---
Wondering what to unlock next. I don't think I would get that much use out of slayer rings since I have unlocked pretty much every other transport system so getting around isn't an issue.
---
I am planning to extend nechryaels when I get to level 80 slayer. Considering extending suqahs as well. I would prefer to do high gp tasks like wyverns and gargoyles rather than skipping them but not sure if that makes them worth extending.
---
I am planning to unlock all of the convenience upgrades (ex: no rock hammer for gargs) as those tasks get assigned to me.
---
Ogresses warriors or zammy wines
---
No such thing unless its a plugin.
---
Would be cool if Jagex had a list like the hiscores
---
Imagine actually being mad over blue dragons when literally any world would be open.
---
nah dude that's bs and you know it
---
What about a leech effect that recoils 10% of enemy damage at the cost having no str bonus. Would be higher dps against enemies that hit higher and more accurate but less dps against weak enemies. 
---
Not sure if that would be previewed as broken. Just spitting off ideas that come to mind for the design.
---
Nice stats, 18 inch BBC
---
If you actually knew anything about this specific charity you’d know how amazing true to it’s word it is.
---
When will they learn 😢
---
*cries in asthmatic*

Probably torags or dh body and legs, dragon boots, fury, neitiznot

I don't think this is a bot farm. Just a bored sweaty with a lot of free time.

That's because Justiciar was redesigned to look more like this.

Haha Batman reference

I haven’t played in like 6 months but this is crazy if these are real.

Yes

You seen how slow it is to fire strike these at low level!

Also, good reddit post

Probs a clan event, a lot of people wearing same team cape

Be happy. Bonds will go back to 3m for a full month. Prices may get cheaper as well for other items, but if you were smart enough, it would be a flipping opportunity for you.

yes, you have to pay the points each time you block
---
no, you cannot just dont pick up the lamp until you get the r/c level
---
I dont know the rwt gp/dollar rates dont hurt me
---
your big issues i see are your very low range/mage for your combat. your gunna want to get those up before you want to participate in endgame content. with a bank that small your severely undergeared for engame content as well. take a look at more midgame content like demonic gorrilas or barrows, and spend more time learning zulrah to make some money. zulrah is super doable with your stats and bank, your issue is just withneeding to learn the mechanics
---
While i sort of agree. Ive been playing the past 2 months on my shitty laptop at like 15fps. Runelites plugin doesnt actually help. Only place is nmz where you have those 100 orbs doing the animation at once. When i said need i also meant want, no one wants and before today ive seen no one mention it on this sub, discord or twitter.
---
Fashionscape so on point. You're rocking the runway my friend.

What if all these bots were taking break from zulrah??
---
Tsk tsk, op supports zulrah bots...
---
I can’t see framed and Torvesta having much efficient skilling/PvM to offer compared to some of the unknown HLC.
---
depends on what you are doing, the bracelet is used a lot but if your doing mostly melee slayer, no point in getting it. go by what you are doing or planning on doing the most in that order. 
---
for example if you plan on camping Zulrah suffering(unless ur good at recoil swapping), tormented, anguish then torture
---
For you
---
Same way you’ve been tracking your kills, the loot shows up on the right side in the bag space
---
Thanks! Sadly I haven’t actually gotten a spirit seed yet, but curious which slayer you suggest doing for them? I’m 89 slayer and have never gotten one :(.
---
if you start regicide and get to the point where u get into elven lands, and can step over traps then you can get to your clue. however, it's usually worth just finishing it so you can charter there

Interesting, is your computer literally a hamster in a box?

But seriously, yeah I could def seeing this being a low level want compared to other things.

Its weird to me about your fps. Literally any computer sold is the last 10 years should be able to run it perfectly .
---
Malware maybe?
---
Is there a legitimate reason why the individual bludgeon pieces aren't trade able? I mean it makes no sense when you think about the god sword individual pieces, individual Armour pieces or kits. 
---
Sucks for people like myself who got an abyssal demon task, go get a Sire kill to check it out, get an unsired on 1kc and now 350 kills later still looking for the final piece but I have no interest in killing the Sire anymore. I just want to kill demons to continue leveling my Slayer. But I'm stuck with 2 bludgeon pieces in my inventory that I wish I could sell for 1/3 the cost of a bludgeon.
---
Did you ask them all?
---
/$

And then it was nothing to me but grinding
---
people totally use grok :p

Bro what are you doing to my small brain

What are you on about mate it straight up is almost always BiS when on task
---
Lmao there’s no excuse for ever using a firecape with mage accept pking op is obviously not pking what r u talking about
---
I'm sorry I was hostile. As I've posted elsewhere, if this wasn't on RL I wouldn't play.
---
Nostalgia is a huge part of the game, and this to me is very important.
---
And osrs is such a "bad" looking game I would be surprised if people really cared that much.
---
MM2 monkeys with chins is the fastest range xp in game. It is faster than MM1 monkeys. The MM2 monkeys also drop p-pots as well so it’s cheaper.
---
Dirty fucking easties!
---
Black mask works the same for almost all tasks
---
Boomer mindset. Boomers love anything that benefits them personally.

That is a really arbitrary distinction.

Dumb noob man
---
Lmao how did you do that quest whilst pregnant, that's awesome!
---
I call bs. You don't notice the difference. I'd love to be proven otherwise.
---
I mean im working on 3 rune dragon alts right now and they will look exactly like the accs you posted when done. I even plan to give them similar names.
---
See reddit this i why witch hunting is against tos here. Op has called out someone for botting, stated their name, and tried to get others to hate on them. Imagine if one of the mans accs got a false ban because everyone on reddit reported him, shame on you op, shame.
---
the biggest reason why that is is because points are dependent on what slayer master your using and thes best ones have combat level requirements, HOWEVER wilderness slayer gives significantly more points than most masters and has no such requirement, so if you are trying to bum rush helm at low levels, that is your best bet just being rag gear and keep an eye out for white dots
---
you look like thurgo lol
---
Freaking def noobs man
---
Which armors do you mean? For the Waterbirth Armors, I think they are fine just being lower level gear, but I would like to seem them more useful for their level; for example, they could get a set effect against the Waterbirth Creatures or something like that.
---
For the Battle Helms, I'd love to see the Warrior, Archer, and Farseer get upgrades like the Berserker got with the Neitiznot Helm. But I think they are better saved for new Quests than just added into existing Quests. There is still one quest left in the series and there could also be side quests too...
---
For the Seercull, it seems doomed to obscurity. I'd like to see it upgraded to be a good level 50 bow; nothing more. Like even if you just make it a Shortbow with the MSB(i) stats, that would be something...
---
I know. I prefer the way justiciar looks now as compared to this design as well.
---
pures have low hp so they can keep cb level low and easily kill mains around their level, while still hitting hard
---
but if you only have 1 def then theres a chance the dude doing a clue in wildy will roll high on dds spec and kill you instead
---
Can always make it where each piece of the sets a % buff so it can be used during slayer
---
Can start out with a bp if you go that way, ive seen plenty of people using bp at bbds
---
obviously you can enter chambers as a lvl 3 in the nude so these arent "real" requirements, but in most learner groups there are a few things wrong with your reqs i figured id point out  
---
void is typically allowed but you take a ton of extra damage, void switches will be the same amount as real switches usually anyway, just take the better gear unless you dont have it
---
trident of the seas is not acceptable usually, bring toxic trident
---
regular whip is not acceptable usually, bring tent whip
---
its not dragon boots or god dhide boots, bring both
---
the spec weapon for lowering defense is one of the most important items to bring. chally is not an acceptable replacement. you will have a very hard time finding someone to go with without at least a bgs
---
rune pickaxe will do just fine and a crush weapon for tek isnt neccessary since we all bring our spec weapons like i said above ;)
---
It’s good for the economy
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide
---
here is a (fairly accurate) list, obviously for all combat methods they are assuming max efficiency so if you are not doing that method do not expect to reach that gp per hour
---
but to answer, no max efficiency melee vorkath is best money in the game.
---
L0l you call like 10m an hour each.. shit profit? If they taking 500k off you and it only took 2 secs, imagine a few hours worth. Whats wrong with making dank money, chilling with the bois on discord, and looking for a big team v team scrap. 
---
Legit bet you dont make anywhere near 10m an hour and you taking the piss out of these kids. Lol smh dude.
---
Imagine being the one stuck with the attack cape.
---
I wonder if he regrets, it seems 1-2 times a year he makes a video promising to make more, sometimes deletes it, doubt the pay is that amazing for his position, the only reasons hes employed is for pr damage control it seems, doesnt seem as active in the community as was before. 
---
I miss the old archie. Hope whatever he is doing now makes him happy.
---
That guy must have never figured out that you have to go to the dungeon for the dragon defender.
---
Right, anyone who says gf is a clown. Dont worry op, we will say the n word next time as to avoid being called clowns.
---
I know alot of people who bot, then come back to read chat...this proves nothing....reported
---
only risk would be that it would end up being slightly OP in slayer, as you wouldn't need to pay the price of ppots and most tasks don't need overheads
---
I got b2p + infin boots, and dipped.
---
Accomplishing 99 str is way more than many normies have ever done with their lives.
---
So on pvp and bh worldw there is a hard pj timer after getting a kill. Its 2019 though anyone that is looting knows how to triple eat and tele when it looks like they getting rushed.
---
How long did it take?
---
Of the two, a rake would better, but your point is well taken!
---
Never had to clear ground elder, mostly used a gardening spike for dandelions when younger or hand weeding a planter
---
Oh sorry, I thought you meant long term.
---
Every time I've had a clue scroll on my 'kill x tasks' that I've uploaded to reddit, I've always finished it, and it's included in my loot screen.
---
I do them as soon as I get them, incase another drops in the task
---
Haha well I’m gonna work on a low hp/def range build early game to kill the imp and goblin rev for early late game drops. I’m just working on 99 fm so I can get cape for best in slot def
