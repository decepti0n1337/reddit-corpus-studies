It sounds more like Paranoid personality disorder than Schizophrenia or Bipolar disorder. Both present with pretty prominent features (psychosis in Schizo and mania in BPD) which you have no evidence of in his posts.

Ofc you can't diagnose any of these without qualifications.

Wait, really? Literally? They actually take your $4 and all stack on top of one another? Wow that is some odd behavior.

Nah i don't really play often and I've never been hacked before because I'm careful and know not to click on dumb crap. This doesn't apply to certain other people though lol. I'm not upset I had no way to anticipate this and didn't really lose that much. I lost my void, magma mutagen (that one hurts). Imbued slayer helm and fire cape. And about 20m gold which isn't the end of the world. I also learned a valuable lesson. Don't lend your laptop to osrs players if you play osrs.

If you were permanently banned from chat, you'd want the offense to contain some sort of proof to rationalize the actions taken against you. No proof was provided to the player. That's messed.

You know what else starts with s, sIlluminati.

He claims to be a "social engineer". Well, he's certainly socially engineered me into thinking he's some deranged retard with a persecution complex. He's mentally damaged to the point where he blatantly harasses others and immediately assumes that there's this elaborate conspiracy to silence him. I also find it absurdly funny that he thinks Chris the fuck Archie is out to get him, and that they share some unacknowledged rivalry.
---
Woah dude chill. He clearly has a mental disorder and that's just awful to say to anyone

Anyone else here who hasnt actually logged into the game in a long time but stays subbed for this trainwreck of a community?

I haven't played Runescape for years and I am thinking of returning (It's been 10+ years). Two questions here:

Ironman seems interesting, but is it a smart thing to do without a main?
---
I see there are clans/community's now. How to find/join one?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Yeah not a fan of no delay. I agree. 
---
Yea this guy is definitely *something*. IDK whether it's like full blown schizophrenia, or regular narcissism levels of delusion. 
---
Either way, he's an admitted RWTer so fuck 'em.

I loved the Skiller slayer idea instead TBF

Yup. Pretty much. I just started 2 years ago and have been caught up with school so I didn't know that. Thanks though!

Imp Catcher?

A lot of people would recommend sand/rock/ammonite crabs for your level, it's no drops but the best xp rates you can get. The idea is the faster you break out of the lower levels, the faster you can move up to better and profitable monsters. 
---
Moss giants are basically an upgrade from hill giants, and better drops too. You can go to the catacombs of kourend if you want a spot close to a bank. But the spot west of the fishing guild is somewhat accessible with a teleport (skills necklace) and pretty chill. Ogres are slightly stronger than Moss giants with more hp, but their drops are more mediocre. They can be found at the combat training camp if ranging is your preference, or south of ardougne.

Unless you look at Blizzard before they were a giant. When all they had was Diablo 2 and Starcraft and some single player RTS'. Starcraft and Diablo being buy to play, not a recurring monthly membership as well mind you.

They still had customer support even back then, before they turned into a mega hit through WoW.

In my mind, the tiers would need to be the same. Rcb, trident, and D scim are used at different levels. Like 41 range vs 75 magic, right? That's a pretty big gap.

Yeah it's funny because I made a thread about how Blizz has a team A and team B that cycle between expansion production (team A is working on next expac already etc.) and how the pattern shows we have good expac -&gt; bad expac -&gt; good again -&gt; bad again. And WoD sucked, Legion was good, so I made the prediction BfA would be crap before it launched.

I'm not that knowledgeable about Blizzard when it comes to their early days. I'm just saying in the current state, not just with customer support, people make comparisons between Jagex and Blizzard when they're on completely different business levels.

Haha dude. Maxing takes forever. It's a homour tag for a reason. You can max even if you play consistent but not crazy hours.

Ive used this setup with both dragon, dragon hunter and blowpipe. Using a crossbow and shield helps a ton. It's very defensive compared to blowpipe Which is what you want when you are learning new mechanics. The ruby specs are nice too
---
Once you have the mechanics down and you arnt dying then you can go for speed kills. Try different methods and go which which way you like.

Maybe they should fix how much battery it uses I can only play it for 30 minuets before my phone dies

There's no huge benefit of having a main and an iron.  You can buy bonds through your main to fund an iron, or drop excess items over to your main.  Every once in a while I use my main to scout for my iron in the wildy.  You could learn mechanics like fight caves with a main or test stuff out without risking much.  Also for raids (high level content) it's normal to split drops, but you could probably work that out.
---
If you are going to jump straight into iron Man it will take quite a lot of research to learn.  The main downsides are having to do every part of the game, you can't skip a boss you don't like or a skill.  And you do have to do all your own gathering that normal players get from bots, other players, and high level bosses you won't have access to while you need the items.

Yeah man, I've had dry streaks over 100 chests and then sometimes I'll get 3 items in 4 chests...Just all about luck mate

Q
---
How were you able to pay for all this in 2 months?

it‚Äôs on the person who brings high hp items or untradedables that are a pain to get, the solution you‚Äôre looking for is common sense, not make safe wilderness. 
---
In Chrome you can set certain file types like images to open in whatever default your computer has to open images by clicking the 3 dots and going to "Always open files of this type", but you specifically need to toggle this on for every file type, and perhaps more importantly it will *never* give you that option for dangerous file types like executables or scripts for obvious reasons.
---
If there's a bug that both allows for the download and auto-runs dangerous filetypes, that's a highly critical RCE exploit that would most certainly make security headlines because of how serious that would be. There's nothing of the sort quickly looking at the public disclosures from what I can see. It's probably misinformation.

Get a rune scimitar before you go f2p. You can camp Fire giants or Zamorakian Warriors(these have a better drop rate) Other than that do quests that boost your combats early on. (Witches House, Waterfall, fight arena, tree gnome village.)
---
Lmao if it's about money they jump instantly thats what every company does....

"Player gets drop that could have been other drop #4719473517"

There's no confusion, it sounds like you want it all. In this case you will have to choose the defense of g b gloves or the offense of assembler, what's the issue? 
---
Only 2002 more days to go!
---
Don‚Äôt do any agility. It doesn‚Äôt affect f2p players so you would just be wasting time. If you decide to go members agility is op but if you‚Äôre only doing it for the week I wouldn‚Äôt waste any time. 
---
If it's hard to remember won't you just make a screenshot and open the image on the side when you're doing the boss?\`

In that case, wouldn't it be wiser to wait for it to drop more and train other skills meanwhile? You won't loose out grinding back the money lost with the dhcb crashing.

yeah, giving me money back because I made a mistake, I know companies can't wait to do that.

Forgive my noobness, but is this a members skill?

If having money tied up in DHCB limits your ability to slay/PvM then sell it. If you do Vorkath/Raids a lot, keep it. If losing 30m+ hurts you, then sell and cut your loses, but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it pops up again.

Its an easy guess tho lol

idk if bloods are worth it with the abyss. you ruin the only good aspect of it being afk. at that point i would just do astrals instead

Sure you could do that but nobody knows that it‚Äôs gonna drop more. Maybe it goes back up and then you‚Äôre stuck buying it back at a higher price later when you need it.

You‚Äôll get it for sure.The most important thing is to squeeze as many hits as you can per phase and timing your eating and swaps between phases and you‚Äôll for sure cut your time. I‚Äôm about to hit 900 money snake kills myself. If you have any questions you can add me rsn : Ashetro
---
I agree that it's not a real security measure.
---
Being someone who has had their account recovered with authenticator removed *without* them having access to my email, at this point I just want at least something more to improve account security, whether it be a delay or anything else Jagex can viably offer. 
---
im a 1 runecraft pure you fucking pleb

git gud
---
    git: 'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
---
True, I'm mostly talking about skill grinding and money making.
---
The top mechanically sound PKer is no where near the caliber of say a top MOBA player or FPS player in terms of actual effort.  The top any E-sport is no where near the actual effort of a top tier athlete.
---
Just do the best rooftop course you can until 70
---
Anyone can use a cheat engine to spawn in another clue scroll on client side and then record it with their phone.
---
Does your dad not work at jagex?
---
Bad bot
---
Wasnt there like a dungeon thing you had to do tho?
---
You don't really need it besides a few niche activities like runecrafting. You can use staminas for quests. I never use graceful, ornate pool covers most things like farm runs. 
---
Get hit more at windertodt then so it just adds more risk later on 
---
The highest gp/h money making methods are:
---
Merching - requires starting capital
---
Staking - requires starting capital and incredible luck if you want to make real profit
---
Raids - ToB and CoX can easily be 5m+/h (ToB can be as high as 15m/hr) - these require extremely high combat stats and good gear
---
Bossing - Vorkath and Zulrah are the money bosses, you can get up to about 4m/hr with max stats and gear
---
Basically if you're looking to make millions an hour you're looking to max combat and get hundreds of millions in gear, or have hundreds of millions in seed money to merch with.
---
Aight, thanks mate ;)
---
I don't understand lmao
---
it is horrifyingly boring, i heard barb fishing is good
---
If he isn't tech savvy, it's sadly the most probably explanation. If you disable your ad block and search for runelite, the first result will be an ad from a pishing site that clones the correct site.
---
Oh, with skills then heck yeah. Lord knows I domt have the patience to chop wood to get 99 wc lol. 
---
Graceful is worth it at Seer's alone I'm pretty sure. You'll have a momentary lapse in efficient xp from like 50-58, but beyond that everything is normal and you'll save money from using staminas more frequently.
---
That's exactly what i'm doing actually. Realistically it isn't that bad at all
---
Is it being built with an open-source, cross-platform toolkit?
---
Actually you should be getting 9 magic and doing witches house for the 6k hp xp to be eFfIcIeNt.
---
Well done, you saved yourself a dollar irl.

He said in a vid he used to not stream on twitch because their double standard on sexual content (chicks could get away with a lot, guys couldn't) and thought YouTube was less shitty. Now YouTube is demonetizing and twitch is getting better at having equal standards so he switched to twitch because YouTube is fucking terrible.
---
Yeah, full hdd wipe and install windows from a fresh installation, system restore may not get rid of it and it‚Äôs not worth the risk if it‚Äôs keylogging or allowing remote access 
---
He shows right click menu on both of them. They're both elites.

What do you mean by twitch streams are scams? You mean if they have an offer it's a scam? Surely nothing can happen if you're just watching a stream...
---
Yeah, he had a convo with Twitch before the switch and Twitch staff chills in his chat too.
---
Barb fishing is around 3k xp/hr starting off. So unless you want 99 fishing I would just do rooftops. 
---
Eh, it's just going to be 2 novice quests. Won't be long before I'll have it on again.
---
Damn, that is a lot of clicking. 
---
I love the fact you were just sitting there fletching and went "Ha! Yeah, that's good stuff. Better post this on Reddit!" Lol
---
Don't system restore, do a clean install of Windows.
---
What's it at right now? I'm looking to buy one
---
Clue rewards are not decided when the clue drop, so no, they would not have the same reward.
---
It's a meme at this point due to how often a PKer will kill a player obviously doing a clue scroll risking nothing. They waste more in supplies than the "potential" loot, when the player doesn't even have d'hides on.
---
They're called twitch staff and they're all busy jacking off in the IRL section.

we don't have any kind of lootshare or damage pooling, those failed many polls, the person who deals the most damage gets the kill, in a clan or out of a clan makes no difference

1. Keep slaying bc it will start making money but takes time. 72 is gonna be the start of good combat money making. If you have cave horrors unlocked I would camp them with only 55 slayer needed, and very fast kills. 
---
2. In the meantime my best suggestion for your stats is maybe nats in abyss? I believe that‚Äôs around 400k go/hr. Not positive though. 
---
3. Mage lvl is 62 and I‚Äôm not sure how that is with barrows. 
---
thats it?
---
Yes it's super weird I'm not lying, I'm a distracted guy but I was always checking if I got the pet or not, there were 3 drops in the same game two hours before I got the collection log maybe one of them was my drop, I don't know but I didn't die that's for sure.

That's dumb logic.  I killed two naked people my last session.  One had 400k loot on him from a greater demon task, and I presume removed their armor to look like a clue hunter (they were out of food).  The other had a full inventory of superiors.
---
I get it can be annoying to die while clue hunting, but realistically if you're actually risking nothing then the only thing you lose is maybe a minute or two of travel time, which should hardly be an inconvenience.

You lock yourself out of a lot of content being free to play.

Ya I know what you mean. Hard core grinding can take fun out of it. Having played since 2003 I def have been through the hardcore phases and looking back I found casual playing more enjoyable at times.

But it literally says OSRS even BEFORE the high &amp; low part.......
---
Question is, will it still continue to crash? Just sniped one and don‚Äôt know if I should sell.

Damn have people really not seen this? you can get as many clues as you want if you don't have it in your inv/bank all you need to do is just drop it for the chance to obtain another one.

Pvmer attract pkers which attract other pkers looking for action. Everything is centralized in revs now but people genuinely enjoy deep wild... especially small man trips. Every place you mentioned is an entirely different style of pking from multi lol.
---
No reason for a pker not to kill someone if action is sparse even if they aren't there for them. If you don't want to get attacked don't enter the wilderness.
---
Ya he is the real legend 
---
They don't need your phone they just need your access code which can phished just as easily as a password as long as they use it before it expires.
---
Also any 2-step verification that uses SMS is vulnerable to a social engineering attack. All they need is your phone number and carrier and then they can call your carrier and say they just got a new phone and need to switch your number over to a new SIM card. Most customer support employees are happy to do this with as little proof as your name and birth date. Once that's done they'll receive all SMS messages sent to your number, including all 2-step codes.
---
This is why authenticator applications are much better than SMS for 2-step verification. But again, the code can still be phished if you aren't careful.

Thank you for responding haha. I guess I can understand the backlash from advertising one's own channel here.

Same here actually. I'm from Australia and I've spent NYE in Italy, Nepal, other parts of Australia, etc, and just felt a full blown "fuck it" this year. Didn't plan anything, although I asked around. But the people I asked didn't have much going on. So I scaped like a bauss. Saved myself a couple hundred bucks by not going out. Winner.
---
The risk of slightly more damage at WT doesn‚Äôt at all outweigh the risk of jogging around with 10-20 hp lol
---
I wasn't aware that 2FA can be removed without access to email. If that's the case then the real solution would be to not allow support to remove 2FA without email access. That would actually prevent some attacks unlike an authenticator removal delay.

This has nothing to do with Java and their choice of database backend has nothing to do with the programming language that their server side code is written in. Please stop spouting pure conjecture from a position of ignorance.

---
Well personally I'd just break up with him if hes really that scrubby to be doing blood runes all the way to 99 runecrafting. Any efficent player with half a brain is either doing lavas if they're poor or paying zmi runners. But alas 99% of of this games community is filled with illiterate baboons who can't play properly.
---
Dude I asked a question and you start to rant about this, no one asked you to rant, don't like it? Ignore it then no need for you to comment.

dude you get barrows gloves from the fishing trawler minigame.

Lol now I'm not so sure you could calculate the chances of getting 4 in a row in 10k rolls.
---
I have morytania hard diaries complete. I also did cannonballs from 35-60 smithing and 60-73 I did iron bars. 489 kc at barrows that equates to roughly 51M. And the blast furnace equated to easily 10+M. I got gifted a bond to initially get members and used gp since. I don‚Äôt spend irl money on a free game. But I appreciate the compliment of my hard work to seem as if it were bought. Additionally, I‚Äôve only done birdhouses for hunter, Miscellania for coal and whatever is selling better weekly. Also NMZ for herb boxes, sand and seaweed for molten glass. So I have many money making methods, my credit card isn‚Äôt one of them.
---
Been there broski. I woke up January 2nd after a long stooped, gf left me, I was staying with her and didn‚Äôt have anywhere to stay, had no job because my job after college fell through, and I had no idea where to go or work and had about $67 to my name. I don‚Äôt miss 2014. It always gets better man, grind it out full autismo mode and before you know it you‚Äôll realize life isn‚Äôt that big of a deal and there‚Äôs always more to enjoy than you think. 
---
Great finally some people in this community actually know how to skill!
---
Don‚Äôt do swamp trident, stay ibans staff until 75 mage then do trident of seas. Also if you don‚Äôt have morytania hard diaries done, barrows is a waste.

Mind sharing the method?

Doubly hilarious because you could have bought like 4m worth of amylase crystals instead of full graceful

Morytania hard diaries too. And rng is kinda average on drops but prices of drops is what matters. I pretty much have nothing in the bank to purchase tassets dagger and dfs, also bought when tassets were 33m and dfs was 8.9. And dagger was a while ago, forgot price.
---
That was actually some gay fight attendant if I remember correctly. He pozzed the world up with his toxic seed. I'm not fully gay myself but I've always kind of wanted to get pozzed up but I don't think my wife would be to thrilled about that. I mean we barely fuck anymore regardless but alas maybe that'll change one day.

Again, I think it has something to do with the way apps are allowed to be named on the iOS AppStore. There‚Äôs probably already an OSRS on the AppStore so they had to use the full name.

---
Yeah that‚Äôs my plan. I want to do double astrals for a while to get a nice stack of runes for casting magic imbue for passive xp. I‚Äôll also probably do lavas here and there. I‚Äôm a fan of higher xp methods like that.
---
Yeah I was trying to get a good angle to have dfs in the picture and dagger, but you get the point. Lol
---
No, I got the top gloves and torch early on. I was lucky though. 1 hp nation boy.
---
A: they don‚Äôt know what you have or don‚Äôt have. Rev loot is usually big money and they can‚Äôt see your inventory. Not killing someone is a bigger risk than letting a bare minimum rev killer go. 
---
B: It really isn‚Äôt hard to coordinate a DD with discord, etc. If they even did scout you and specifically dd‚Äôed on top of you. Most likely a coincidence that you were on their dd when they logged.
---
C: they aren‚Äôt going just for you, there are multiple people per world and with 15 people it‚Äôs really fast and easy to clear worlds. They‚Äôve been doing that for every world hop and most likely are very efficient about it.

Whenever people make posts like this, I encourage them to watch The Tatami Galaxy. If you didn't have the discipline to control yourself and get your life in order, it's unlikely you would've had the discipline to take advantage of the 'what if' situations you thought about. At least with these choices, you did the things you wanted to do, were good at, and achieved some form of success.

Nah dont have money for a dhcb and haven't done ds2, are brutals still good? I want to primarily play on mobile and I heard nechs arent good for cash.
---
this system is fine as other companies do this as well, there is just no follow thru or recourse if you get fucked. they don't verify real world ID's on an ownership dispute, they don't rollback (controversial issue in this game i know) and they just have a generally robotic inhuman approach. even the addition of live chat would be a step up from web ticket only support.

I remember my first mil. Purchased a whip with it for 1.1m, I think I didn't have the str requirement for it, so I tried to sell it. Someone offered my 1.3m! 1.3m at the seers village bank for my newly purchased whip, what a profit.
---
He swapped the stack of cash to 130k or whatever and I didn't notice. Got scammed for my first mil in just a few hours.

Got scammed of my first full rune set in a similar manner too actually. This is in the RS2 days.

I know I am going to come off as a real jerk here but the following makes me think you might be having a bad time mentally
---
&gt; you believe the jmods are aware of your posts to the point that they are whispering to each other about your contributions in the stream chat. Also that because they implemented some of your ideas that they must have seen your video.

I'd say every three weeks is about average

XP &gt; GP.

Although you will need a large sum of GP in order to get real good XP gains.

we not passing the poll to give pkers that 4m tho so it‚Äôs staying that way

Loot tab so far 200+ kills

Had 150+ scrolls but i sold them in need of some cash.

I can't find virustotal on my computer

It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve done the quest, but pretty positive it‚Äôs very close to the end. Like you have to go through all of the shitty content to unlock it, might as well finish the quest 
---
Why the fuck are you using brews 
---
Ahh that brings back memories, I miss those days. For me 2010-2012 (just before eoc) was my personal best time in RuneScape. Although right now we are in another golden age on osrs. 
---
I agree completely.
---
Kbd, giant mole, chaos elemental even!
---
Classic multi-combat bosses that you could kill with a group were awesome.
---
This is such a good idea, I get task all the time that I haven‚Äôt done in forever. I just completely forget what i do for it, do I go pray or do I bring food, so I bring bandos or Guthan it goes on and on.
---
Make GE Cancer Again

And the price of blood runes over the course of selling all these?
---
Warding let other ppl wear ur clothes 
---
Had this happen to me at dks before. Was juggling a hard+got another one as a drop, was able to pick them both up casually without being denied the 2nd one. 
---
Later on, the same scenario happened where I got 2 hards at once during DKS but I couldnt pick both of them up as intended. Its a strange glitch for sure
---
Don‚Äôt tempt us
---
imagine someone doing a method that earns some gp on the way to 99 instead of playing for max efficiency and a negative profit, it‚Äôs hard i know but maybe you should try it. 
---
"spell"
---
But yeah it only takes 2 complete tithe runs and you'll never have to worry about weeds again- super worth imo
---
Don't use super on herbs, use ultra
---
isnt that a prayer? is this even a thing?
---
i play purely mobile except certain tasks where the F keys come in useful
---
Brutals are solid but much more money to be made. Keep up with slayer. Brutals if you really need to grind cash rn
---
That is pretty much entire pure community from my experience
---
reported.
---
working on getting those stats. try going for diaries now thats my second achievement 
---
The thing is, this is probably not your main game. Everyone has a game they play the most. If I put the same hours into this game as I do in COD/BF I would be a decently good player aswell..same applies to you. That's my assumption atleast
---
I once dropped some energy pots to a player who looked like he needed a boost üòÅ
---
I have 83 con bud
---
Start slayer. I started around 75 and now I'm 50 slayer, and I absolutely love the tasks. I was assigned iron dragons and got mage from 55-62 in that task itself haha. Hopefully you like it, also, I was just shown Nightmare Zone minigame that's super fun, great do and can afk 
---
More like you scammed yourself by not doing any research
---
What slayer level should I stop at? Like what's my goal?
---
and why fighter torso and bandos tassets? it's better + cheaper to have bandos body + obby legs, no?
---
Why not do some agility pyramid for some cash?
---
Granite boots will raise more in % 
---
Explain?
---
That sucks for you, next time you should try to know what you are doing instead of assuming you know whats going on... its with a better owner now 
---
I fail to see how Jagex scammed you. 
---
You choose yourself to swap names, which you did with bonds. You needed 3 bonds anyway.
---
1. To get membership on your F2P alt &amp; change the name.
---
2. To unlock the cooldown period on this alt &amp; change the name.
---
3. To unlock the cooldown period on your main &amp; change the name.
---
You could have waited out the cooldown period on your main before starting this process, but for some reason you didn't. Even so it would cost you a minimal of 2 bonds. If you think its a waste of money, then why do it in the first place?
---
I mean, 99 lol if you want to stop at a certain level for content then the new hydra boss would be the highest level required, which is going to be 95 slayer. But 85 slayer for abyssal demons, then kraken and smoke devils, Cerberus as well which  is some of the best money in the game 
---
1 nice m
---
advice on getting 63-99 rc? not done the skill in years.
---
Fremenik isles where you get animation locked fir 15s repairing the bridge while two trolls throw rocks at you.
---
Also the low level mourner who throws a vial at you that does like 60 damage almost made me shit myself.
---
Yup, more features for free
---
Don't you get bored of it?
---
I don‚Äôt get it? This sounds like a funny ass joke but my feeble mind needs an explanation. 
---
ice
---
99 fishing would be nice. I've done barb fishing to 85 and it's really nice on mobile. So fast to drop fishes.
---
Ya that‚Äôs fair. Def been there 
---
And until they do, they should put a delay on the authenticator so owners at least get a chance to get their account back before their entire bank goes poof.
---
Uhh 6 to 8 weeks? 
---
It is once you unlock the spell upgrade from volcanic mine.
---
There are tens of thousands of new players thanks to mobile. Many of them aren't as saavy as those of us with over a decade of experience.
---
Back in high school I used jerk him with my hands
---
This is bait on a level seldom seen nowadays....
---
Is it not normal to not be annoyed that we don't have trade logs, purchase ORDER logs (Like 3x Bond following the date etc.), chat logs, text authenticators, or an osrs version of the bank authenticators? Jagex Support is actually really helpful. But the tools they use should somewhat be public. Here's some context.
---
They resolved an issue I had where I fell for that (still active) high view count twitch phishing "double XP" scheme. It would be so reassuring to know that my hacker's account was banned. The Jagex Support report I recieved said a third party had accessed my account, but left it at that. The issue was resolved and any charges were "returned to the account" or whatever, but I'll never forget that my hacker got away. I'll also never know if the hacker used my card or not, all I know is there was a custom message left by the hacker on the billing info saying "bill bazyn". 
---
Mines from around 2005...you can use your original rs account.
---
All they need is an authenticator delay so I at least have a few days to realize my accounts been compromised before my entire bank goes poof.
---
Yeah they have, people have also died from blood clots due to sitting for too long.
---
Forgot to censor Apple pay, rip ur bank
---
messaged you too. love to know how.
---
Not every day that someone‚Äôs highest stat is Agility. Congrats 
---
If they put a delay on removing it, it would likely save trillions in gold from being stolen.
---
Already hit 7m lol. Bit late to jump in on that. 
---
F
---
Wait what is this?? This would be so helpful
---
It wouldn't help if it was implemented the same way as regular 2fa...they'd probably still make it instantly removable 
---
Get an imbued heart, full inv of sharks or better food, 1 bastion potion, 3 prayer pots, veng the range attacks on magic phase, u should easily get 3-4 kills at ~2mins kills or less.
---
Just climb too the top then trade it the pyramid treasure to npc for cash. By no means it's not insane money but u don't have to invest too much into it
---
Sal as in Sals realm?
---
Actually, no.
---
PayPal is a *maybe* since you can't just siphon money out....but you CAN use it to rwt. PayPal will chargeback fraudulent charges, however.
---
So will your bank.
---
But Jagex won't, and there lies the issue.
---
You lose etherum bracelet on death every time 
---
Finances? Sure. But I prefer to break all of these down as:
---
- Gaming addiction
---
- Spending addiction
---
- Gambling addiction
---
A gaming addiction can lead to a spending- and gambling addiction. But it isn't necessarily the case.
---
At the end of the day as long as you're enjoying yourself and you're happy, that's all that matters. What's the point in doing something you hate? It sounds miserable. 
---
keep it to the incel sub buddy
---
Did you solo all the way and if so whats your final kc and total points from there?
---
The necklace is used by essentially nobody. It gives less prayer at 99 then a single dose of a potion. The Phoenix Necklace sees some use in PVP, since it heals 30hp.
---
If anything the necklace of faith needs a buff.

Agility? 
---
yeah i have a graveyard shift job where im at work from 10:30pm-6:30am so im going to do monkfish till i can do sharks then do sharks till 99. not going for exp but for profit and since im working 8hrs anyways get paid to play a game. it also makes time go by slightly faster since my job consists of waiting for certain time before im allowed to do my task also i got an ipad which i watch movies or catch up on podcast (PKA is my favorite)
---
Why do people make accounts with restrictions.. like it makes no sense

It's cuz u most likely "eat dark crab" after killing ever 1k that baby pet doesn't want to be around that! U just ate it's mother

There is a setting for this in the basic settings section. I had the same question at one stage. Maybe it‚Äôs moved to a right click on the ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù tab or something?

The totem pieces will always drop one you dont have (impossible to get 2 of the same). Once you have a full set you have to complete the whole thing or it wont drop anymore. Once you complete it the parts will drop again.

Why does this get pinned and important info about phishing and scams is just left to fall off the front page into nothingness
---
Yeah I know him, there‚Äôs a bunch of lurers and scammers... he usually has a account with the name Kelsey in it.

Can we please look at grotesque guardians, possible suggestions are: During transitions allow us to deal damage at reduced rate of 50%, similar to vorkath. Let us sell granite dust to improve gp rates for boss. This boss is only used for pet hunting and is very underwhelming compared to other bosses.

They could make it so you can choose to enter a pin on log in to access your inventory. Also if you die without entering the pin it disappears instead of dropping on the ground to avoid hackers suiciding accounts.

How do you know what he needs and doesn't? Do you know how his autism works? How he functions specifically, what he needs in his life - all the intricate details? If not, then you can't go around telling others how he should and wants to live his life. 
---
You keep saying he's being enabled, but some people are so autistic they can't function in society. Can't attend school or work because of it. You don't know how mild or severe it is. Also, being depressed isn't the same as having autism. They function very differently. 
---
* Don't leave personal details out in public-view; this includes leaving a state or country on a Facebook profile or the likes

They can only restore tradable items (by literally spawning them manually on a mod and trading them over). That and they couldn't handle the influx of requests if it was allowed. I believe it was said that they didn't have the manpower to sift through all the fake requests

Reported for rwt
---
If you have a powerful-ish computer, you can also copy links and paste them into a browser on a VM. If it tries to get any sort of malware on your PC, it will only affect the VM.

Or just use a VM for everything: set it up as you like, and reset it to that point on every shutdown. 
---
\&gt; I don't enjoy anything else so I guess I like skilling
---
That's exactly what I hear from that statement, you have nothing else to do but play OSRS, you can't do/don't enjoy the things you want to do so you just default to the very last thing on your list because, well, it's enjoy that or nothing, right?
---
If a hijacker has access to your (likely) personal email to click a link, you have way worse things to worry about.

Along with 2FA for the RS account, you also need to enable 2FA on your email.

Technically this would count as gaming addiction wouldn't it? If Lynx didn't literally have autism.

&gt;Gaming disorder is characterized by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behavior (‚Äòdigital gaming‚Äô or ‚Äòvideo-gaming‚Äô), which may be online (i.e., over the internet) or offline, manifested by: 1) impaired control over gaming (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context); 2) increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and 3) continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. The behavior pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern of gaming behavior may be continuous or episodic and recurrent. The gaming behavior and other features are normally evident over a period of at least 12 months in order for a diagnosis to be assigned, although the required duration may be shortened if all diagnostic requirements are met and symptoms are severe.

Oh wow, using profit as an argument when comparing content of 2 different games is on a whole new level of retardation.
---
Take the profit part away and you have a shallow dungeon that's about as big as 3 dungeoneering levels.
---
It's an incredibly fun skill, incorporating everything what makes RuneScape distinct from other RPGs.
---
Give me please one good argument why dungeoneering is a bad skill.

I‚Äôm not actually gonna give you reddit gold, but if I was drunk or actually had any money, you‚Äôd have reddit gold right now

If you click the two swords tab on your interface, you can switch between attack styles, each one trains a different combat skill, defence is usually "Block"
---
Top left is attack top right is strength and bottom right 'block' defence
---
Click on your attack type tab, it‚Äôs the two crossed swords. 
---
There you want to select a different attack style, different weapons can train different stats. However a scim can do them all. 
---
Accurate - attack
---
Aggressive - strength
---
Defensive - defence
---
Controlled - all three (whips and spears)
---
Enjoy
---
My theory is they went with an 07 back up due to the state of the game and it's thriving player base back then and this is now a what if we didn't rape our game version.

You played 17 hours of runescape a day, on your fucking phone? For 30 days straight?

I'd suggest making it a right click on the inventory icon. That makes more sense to me :)

Yup.. But fuck getting actual xp so u can earn more after a while of playing amirite
---
bloods are really afk compared to nats.
---
what is the exp rate for death runes?
---
So..... yes?
---
Man, now I wanna get a maxed account that uses D long and combat bracelet. 
---
And bandos.
---
i imagine that the scythe taeks a good amount of them out of the game since a single attack costs 3 runes
---
I‚Äôm so proud of us
---
still not as bad as 99 slayer
---
And you have to take your entire bank
---
2.2k total get 99 smithing and elite diaries
---
Well everyone seems to be stoners lmao
---
I thought this was entirely through the abyss? I assumed the method is the same where you get past the obstacles, then jump into the portal which takes you to each altar? Sorry, as I say I havent played in a very long time. Dont think i've seen inside the blood altar

*sigh*

I would like to assume that because he finished before the new year that he is taking a break and is spending time with his family.  It‚Äôs not uncommon for Europeans to place a big emphasis on family during the new year and Christmas holidays.

best christmas gift!

I can confirm I was there I saw this happening live 
---
he's still in the process of washing his chair. will likely take him until march
---
Nope, you can do it no problem. Looks tor a transparent inventory option in advanced settings.

If you bot you're also more likely to get banned and do other things with your life. :thinking:

If he's a person that can make 3m/h, and it takes him more than 6 minutes to go to the shop and buy them himself, you could argue that it's worth it.

Well first off i dont subscribe to forums,  and back then i didn't even have a reddit account , im not really a person that cares about forums at all and i dont create accounts on them, and on the few things that i needed to create an account on like imgur lets say i dont use my gaming password, my gaming password is specific to battle.net steam and runescape and nothing else, so no you were not right.

you preferred the 0 content runescape of 2007? where the best thing you was gonna kill was kalphite queen ok

A delay upon removing an authenticator does not change the fact that **your account is compromised**. It only *delays* the inevitable as your account is still vulnerable. As soon as you take a break on that account you're screwed. 
---
I fully agree we need better security, but please suggest things that actually work.

---
I understand the bank PIN despite having one. When you're PKing on 3 accounts it becomes annoying to put it in each time, because the PIN remember thing doesn't work if you log into another account.
---
But, there's no excuse for the lack of authenticator. It's the best protection by far as long your email is secure, and you literally only have to type in a code once a month. 
---
That's unnecessary. Just turn sounds on, watch his animation, and do 1 thing in between his attacks (like tagging a healer or drinking a sip of praypot).

uh no, that was actually Zezima.

He could thoroughly maintain a gf while doing RuneSpan V2, it's so afk.

But again in any case im only arguing for myself and telling my experience on how i got my account recovered on very basic terms, this might change from person to person and indeed others might have had their forum accounts compromised from dataleaks etc...

But the point im trying to make is that this kind of stuff doesn't get taken this lightly in other gaming platforms like Steam or Blizzard and it seems that people just say "well jagex is smaller" or "you should have proteceted yourself better" ... I mean as someone who never got their information compromised on these even though i could have been using a Blizzard authenticator, which i didnt, or a Steam authenticator , which i didnt , i still get hacked on Runescape specificly... Im not saying its a bad thing to use extra protection but i never needed to because i played it safe at all fronts. Now i do use these extra authentication steps but over 10+ years of gaming ive never needed to untill around 2 years ago.

There‚Äôs nothing in osrs that takes 6min to travel to.

I don‚Äôt think he was trying to make money as much as simply trying to get a cool screenshot.

Well if it's any consolation everything is kind of pointless anyways

Was there a leak about kebos update? or is it just merchers dumping stock before the announcements today.

The DHCB is a grand investment for anybody actually using it.

I think it's worth it to do some grinding.

No? I very clearly said that a lot of things are easy, just that they're not always fun and/or tedious.

I hope you're trolling. If not, you should feel ashamed of yourself.

Sang is better. Whether you want to spend the money or not is up to you. Try to find how many charges you use per kill
---
If you're being serious then that's pretty good proof that it is a viable option for those looking for a free world.

But I'll admit, I get the feeling you may be trolling, haha.

My magnifying left eye lens was able to fetch some info and it seems like this photo contains a zulrah kill with a pet drop. Gratz man!

Lmao, what is your problem? 
---
What reason did I give you to suddenly start insulting me? Did you really get so upset by my post? Jeez, it sounds like you're the one... what did you say exactly... "vent your shitty fucking life at me" Yep, that's exactly what you're doing right now. Oh the irony. 
---
Oh, and I didn't even downvote your other post.
---
It's a blessing
---
Thanks for the info

Hey thanks! Your guys support means a lot to me and the rest of the team.

Yeah it is :)

It was never 1M gp in the past, I don't know where you get your information but it's certainly nowhere reliable.  It's also always taken over a month for names to be released after changing them once.
---
I didn‚Äôt interpret your comment that way!
---
It‚Äôs a valid question. No one with actual real life responsibilities can maintain playing as much as he did.
---
Lmao... This dude makes a post whining about Jagex because he fucked up, everyone basically calls him a dumbass so he copy/pastes a "IT NOT MUH FAULT THO" response to everyone. To top it all off he then edits the original post to call every one who responded a retard.
---
I love it.
---
We are talking about the same thing, I edited and added it as an option to see under you without needing to use entity hider or renderself.
---
I am currently using your suggestion since you pointed it out.
---
Too bad you can't control what you sound like, huh.
---
It's ironic that Vox posts this, but not really though, they are experts in that field ^(don't woosh me)
---
Dude I forgot that site existed
---
Being able to play 17 hours a day consistently is just crazy. If someone offered me 50k US to do what he did I'd probably say no, I don't get how he was able to do it.

Just a regular main, I'm still excited for it either way though haha.
---
This or nothing else in 2019. /s
---
I think this would be a cool addition, but i think this is the typical task that is far easier to be handled by a 3rd party client than upgrading the engine of the game itself. Probably resource wise they won't really push this as atop priority qol update.

Nats is pretty simple, use glories to get to edgeville bank and then abyss to the altar.

I thought they patched that ages ago

Ah, I'm not trying to mock or anything (just to be clear) I just am trying to get a full insight to why that feature is used, for I have tried it several times on several occasions and it never really tickled my pickle, per se. 
---
it's 76 not 700

No it doesn't take away a bit from the achievement! I was just curious because sometimes i do solo trips too on my regular main :)

He kept his EHP extremely high, while playing on several alts. FYI he didn't just do agility, he trained mage while he did agility which makes it fairly click intensive. Together with doing things on multiple accounts, it becomes very impressive.
---
You think you can do it go get 50m fishing FULLY efficiently and then come back to me. (I believe he 3 ticked fished, while doing the little cooking trick, and playing on alts) but i just care about you fishing
---
Back on rs2 I auto clicked 99 mage, botted all 3 combat skills to 99 and 70 agil with no ban. Needless to say, I havent touched any of those things since osrs came out. Botting skills wasnt rewarding enough, so I've dont everything legit this time lol.

---
a year ago he was doing the exact same thing.  just because YOU won't look at the evidence, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  we've all seen it, tried to tell you about it, and by your own confession wouldn't even read it cuz "too long" but you come in and make your own assumptions about him?  based off of absolutely NOTHING, even though everyone here has spoon-fed you the evidence?  yikes.
---
Ive been working on a concept grandmaster quest  idea.
---
Basically, a RFD style quest built around the varrock stray dog, Bob or the ghost of bob (f), and gertrude and her cat.

I wish I had more free time to sit down and flesh it out. :/

Maybe one day.

I beg to differ. Try walking to the elven lands from lumbridge or from like the area that tob is in (i forget the name lol) 
---
best time for runescape imo

Ty for making me feel better x
---
You should never trust a serene comment. Misleading propaganda!
---
I'm gonna go and say that it's probably the opposite of what you just said. What kind of parent allows their adult child to sit at home and play video games all day? Most parents would get fed up with it and do something about it. 
---
Why doesn't he sell his accounts?  He could keep playing and doing what he loves, while also starting fresh and making good money.  If he made every account 99 overall they'd sell for thousands each.  I wanted to ask him this in his AMA but I was too late and didn't see anything else ask him 
---
Make it so if you run, you take constant 5s and shout "ouch" as the rock smashes your ankles.
---
i was just talking about this with some friends thats crazy gratz 
---
I clearly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about I guess. I should have just stuck to telling serene to shut the fuck up. Sorry

It was a legit email and I didn‚Äôt click on the link in it. I went to the jagex website to do all of this.

Just phone is enough. They can't bot that. Right? Well then again my phone receives daily confirmation messages from 2 apps that i use to get passive money. And I assume that they show those messages at some website.

I wish i had the sang staff ngl but its expensive. But the healing and more dps are something to consider.

As mentioned voids only better than arma if you use blowpipe.

Oh hey it's the bpaptu numeral

"get in contact with Jagex" are you fucking crazy?

Nice i didnt think i could do corp beast but we have similar stats, i just need a dwh to drop for me now and a bandos sword. Grats with the drop :) Ely next?

Most probably would, but there‚Äôs a good amount that won‚Äôt. And if the offspring can pass as disabled in some way and claim government checks, there‚Äôs less motivation to change the situation.

But they got your email and they can start the account recovery process. They have unlimited time and unlimited attempts to gather information on you until they have enough to unlock your account through the recovery system that never lets you change the recovery questions on your account, and instantly bypasses the authenticator you have on both the account and your email.
---
Its best to just have a separate email or two for each online account you have everywhere. Otherwise, you'll just get ridiculed when your security is compromised and you were using the same email in multiple places.
---
Aren‚Äôt we supposed to downvote you now?
---
i accidentally cast hunter kit spell and randomly decided to sell everything on the ge. it insta sold for 100k so i was confused as shit, cast it a few more times and another insta sold for 200k. I dont merch or anything, this is just a really really weird coincidence.
---
Sup with the whack playstation, sup
---
? I fail to see the hypocracy sorry.
---
It slightly improves when you have access to the Mining Guild.
---
At certain times of the day, there's at least one bot in every world at the Mining Guild mining coal. All the bots have 60+ mining and 9 prayer (and 4 combat level). I hopped around 20 F2P worlds and I saw at least a bot in every world, with some worlds having 2 of them. It's as though a single person made like 30 accounts, did The Restless Ghost quest and bot-mined to 60 mining just to access the Mining Guild.
---
Nah, who cares about cats. They suck
---
Whos mod ana?and how does she relate to this suggestion? 
---
I probably will but I still wanna push myself and see if I can make enough for a bond by then because I already pushed for full mystic since its the best mage armor I can wear 
---
How u gonna hang urself with a flat pack tho???
---
I‚Äôll post a pic in the post.
---
So he should just sit on the accounts then and make no money at all?
---
i tried revs up to 2k couldnt last  for more than 1 kill,  though I havent tried during 8am-11am europe time people say its empty those time mostly
---
Dam that's amazing ill definitely check that out.
---
Uhh, people definitely bring restores to vorkath, why wouldn‚Äôt you?
---
No those cap at dragon gloves, after Dragon Slayer 2 though.
---
Damn man. I‚Äôm on the same path as you stats-wise and quests-wise. I have about 10 quests left and 1400 total skill (89 combat). Your account now is where I would like mine to be in another month. Very balanced, as all things should be. 
---
Yes. It is a recurring charge that has worked fine in the past.
---
Has this been done yet? I'm still annoyed, I get defaulted to a 1k+ populated world every time.
---
Less AFK and costs 100m+. Probably the 100m+.
---
They wanted to train in f2p. I told them members was faster and that there was moneymaking methods to sustain a bond. Both of them currently are going to pay for a month to get more time as they really enjoyed questing and have 80qp in like 2-3 days. I'd say they are really well off.

One slightly stronger free chin every couple of minutes just isn't worth fumbling around and switching weapons and speccing.

Yes, from within the OSRS mobile app. Your Google Play balance should be an option. Although I cannot confirm if this is available in the Netherlands.

love the "i merch and stake on main" lookin ass rwters

They have scouts, yes.

Good idea.

How is it the most efficient if you have the diary completed? Serious question I didnt know.

u can try perfect tick this iron ore

i did this before mobile came out
---
i mined like 30k ores just fine on pc
---
Nobody knows if it's BIS for Hydra yet. And because people flip before updates release.
---
Hardly worth the effort for the next to minimal boost in exp, could even be less exp
---
A one way switch is so hard for the noobs. Imagine fumbling around clicking from a crossbow to china lmao
---
wauw
---
50 con for poh portals would be my first suggestion.
---
"Chiseling" refers to how Bloods and Souls use a different form of essence than other runes. Can't remember the exact order, but you need to mine the essence blocks, chisel them into fragments, and enchant them before you can craft with them.
---
That Ice shield would be completely broken in pvp.
---
undetected by a malware scanner isn't the same as zero day though. considering antiviruses and such work by scanning for heuristics/known signatures if ur virus hasn't spread much it's very likely that it will be undetected from a scanner.

I played f2p for years when I was younger, it's completely fine to start there. This isn't like WoW where you're gonna hit lvl20 and be forced to subscribe. f2p has a lot of content but for someone who has never played runescape before it would probably be overwhelming to become a member right off the bat.
---
It doesn't have to be bis if it doesn't cost anything to use. Those dragon bolts add up and could make the lance more profitable.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it like 5-6m at one point
---
yeah I just checked one, they have u log in, then ask for pin and auth code... I could see maybe asking for auth code, but asking for pen?
---
I just imput my rsn as somebody famous and the password being fuckyou or something like that.

how do they get past your auth if the code changes every 30 secs?
---
Boah halt einfach dein Maul junge und geh in die Schule

Hey guys, I haven't played runescape in my life, ever. I've only been watching some videos from youtube and some streams from time to time. Told myself, why not give it a shot after all this time? So I made my account, bought a bond, but I couldn't realy find any detailed guide on what to do once you start, could you guys give me some advices on that ? What should I focus on, and what would be the best thing to get into at the very beginnig? Thanks a lot and have a nice evening !
---
Well, you don‚Äôt have to do it, then.
---
how would an auth delay help here? they got ur auth code can trust their pc for 30 days, and make gains for 30.

People are unsure if it will be BIS at hydras. People just selling early

Right click on the bank tab and click remove all.

Make it scale with hitpoints remaining until you're down to 1 health and if you move again you get a message and then if you still continue it hits you and you die

Then I'm going to wait and hope it rises before release 
---
What's next, eoc?
---
How will the Alchemical Hydra death mechanics work? Will it be like Vorkath or Zulrah..? 
---
Then I'm going to wait and hope it rises before release. That what I thought happened.

Yeah I'm not buying it. Post that Hans report OP.
---
I once got flamed by an elitist who shood the dog, when I told him not to waste xp on that he instantly attacked me for my ingame name lmao
---
yeah it is stupid and xenophobic to not want illegal immigrants coming into the country unfettered. America is the only country in the world that protects its borders.
---
Your post makes a ton of assumptions that we don‚Äôt know yet when compared to mine which is a generalization. What happens to the dps when you mix in a bgs Spc? Bgsing is not done in the current vorkath meta but would be done in a vorkath melee meta. 
---
Your second paragraph is actually embarrassing. The logic you just used makes literally no sense. 
---
...Did he leave his right hand in the sand??
---
That would be a really nice feature for chatting with a lot of friends whilst bankstanding! Good job OP
---
But it IS legal to seek asylum. So when  the border is ill equiped to handle 1,000+ people at once and your family's life is in danger you will do whatever you have to.
---
I'd like them to not have to break the law to save their lives, but unfortunately that is not the reality.
---
It's like they don't even look up, I press send recovery appeal, 2 seconds and email comes back with reject. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to remove all of them though
---
True. BP takes about 500k operation cost/hr and DHCB is about 250k operation cost/hr. It ends up with the BP being #3, Lance being #2, but DHCB still being #1 even after the operating costs are taken into account. The speed difference of 9.8 vs 10.8 is a big gap.
---
It will eventually stabilize back at 100-120m. It will continue to be bis at vorkath and to be good at chambers; so it will have it's uses.

Yeah I liked seeing it so thanks, I somehow didn't understand the melee Dodge sorta maneuver and I think this helped sort that out. Nice Acc btw.

I think it‚Äôs more likely about the sheer number of people. I‚Äôve been hunting black chinchompas the past few days and here haven‚Äôt been more than 3 people on a single world unless I was hunting with my clan.

The reason splashing doesn't exist for range is because range *only* gives you exp for dealing damage, whereas mage gives you exp for casting the spell and then gives bonus damage for dealing damage. If you only hit 0's with mage you still get a baseline amount of exp/hour, if you only hit 0's with range you get exactly 0 exp/hour.

I use blue for mage weapons/gear green for range gear/weapons red for melee weapons/gear and purple for items you don‚Äôt standardly use as weapon gear for example: infernal pickaxe/dwh/imbued heart that kind of stuff. Mostly for raids.

Only difference is the HP so hard is much more beneficial for points and xp

No no no no. I get where you think that's where they come from, but really I've gotten them on dozens of accounts. They are from that one chest in the lumbridge castle. You know, the one in the Dukes room from cooks assistant.

It‚Äôs clear you have put a little time and thought into this post, so how did you not realise at some point that the items you are suggesting are dumb, just completing negating a level 94 spell? 
---
Because a lot of the time it's people's lives at stake and as a decent fucking human being I would think you would want to make sure that nothing bad happens to another person.

Dhcb is bis. If you dont have that or can't afford it, bp is 2nd best

She was a former Lead Developer for RS3 who was against making seagulls drop feathers as 'the time could be better used elsewhere' and it became a bit of a running joke
---
Ah okay thanks so hard is decently better in the long run

Nice deflecting homeboi. 
---
Where are you going that A) You don't know the stats of the enemy you're fighting B) Don't know what you'll be fighting and C) Aren't bringing enough runes
---
My bad, was multitasking
---
Absolutely, im not saying don't mage him, I'm saying a DDS can speed this up. If you get lucky and hit a double 16 or so on him or even a 13/13, you will still do more damage in that attack than a magic attack could. May as well,  as you wouldn't spend your special attack on anything else
---
Panic buy!

How does firemaking not make sense? There are different level tree tiers makes sense to have different level to burn them. Slayer could be more called be a mini game. Strength makes sense, Attack makes you hit higher more often strength makes your max hit higher. How would a skill that‚Äôs just based around doing god related activities be a skill I stand by that it should be a mini game with some unique rewards. Most would like to see the osrs further develop. I again would recommend putting actual some sort of effort into designing a mini game add some graphics and purpose Mabey some rewards or you will have to do it with that your low effort post you made now will never be seen or taken serious.

so many misleading comments here. it's not the (strange) old man at barrows you get them from, just the "old man" found north of veridian city. let him show you how to catch a pok√©mon. After that you fly to Cinnabar island and surf at the eastern cost. note that you must have rune gloves (smithable at lvl 91) in the 6th inventory slot. surf until you get an encounter with a missingno, and voil√° barrow gloves. WARNING! this may cause your runescape cartridge to go corrupt and you will have to buy a new one. A small price to pay if you wanna "git gud".

Why make content for low levels that's like making food for it to go stale new players come and go and low levels come and go when's the last time you went to make a full bronze armor set or sat out and fished anchovies so you can do a quest? New content should mostly be flashy so new people and low levels want it but not to difficult so that mids can't do it but have end game qualities so that veterans don't breeze past it.

thanks for the replys so far guys , this post is not a troll . I would genuinely like to see the normal animation returned to the motherload mines . thank you
---
Same I burned through like 40 with a friend in a couple days. Adderal is a dirty disgusting drug though, fucking worst comedown I‚Äôve ever had and it destroys your ability to sleep. Never again. 
---
I'd rather spec out Ahrim tbh. Without a blowpipe he's usually the slowest brother to kill.
---
Thanks for the info here :)
---
I'll give this a go soon. I just spent most of my bank on dharoks so I'll be wearing that this time :)
---
If I end up not losing money on each run, then I can shoot for the armour drops! 
---
Ahh thank you!
---
So you want new content that you arent even able to do?
---
How many downvotes can we get on this?
---
Just get them, it's easy. I got them at 0 kc.
---
What about if I‚Äôm trans ? 
---
It's a good meme. But I wanna know where the picture is from. I recall its from a movie or something 
---
It's my favourite skill. My main has 200m agility and I recently started a fun agility pure account to train when I'm bored. At 20m on that account so far.
---
I like to mix up the courses. I'll do brimhaven, ardy, dorg, werewolf, wilderness (even if it's slow it's really fun) and ape atoll. 
---
Nah I just turn on gpu rendering with runelite and never drop fps. 
---
Clip?

No Fucking shit?

if you take like 40 of a pill a few days of a drug you aren‚Äôt prescribed. Idiot. Amphetamines are useful drugs if you don‚Äôt fuck around with them like that. Hopefully you learned your lesson
---
Nice 
---
Could be. Its up to 143mil right now. If it does end up being useful for the hydra it could hit 200 mil. Just depends on if the range phase has high magic level or not for the tbow.
---
Teleports?
---
Forrest Gump silly :) 
---
Fuck me that must be one of the rarest things I‚Äôve seen. 
---
It's actually slightly different, as it has arm guards. And dude, we don't need a separate high level piece of gear for every single God. There are plenty of mid tier God items.
---
I just do agility when I have a shit ton of alchables from slayer.
---
I'd frick anyone for 100m
---
&gt; who was against making seagulls drop feathers as 'the time could be better used elsewhere
---
RS3 contempt aside, she certainly has got a convincing point there. Pretty much a completely useless suggestion if the memes are laid aside here.
---
Is there a difference between a rock cake and a dwarves rock cake? In my mind an overload provided a similar feature, albeit less efficient
---
I don't know. I've seen some really gay shit 
---
Same here. I do most skills ‚Äúefficiently‚Äù if I can, but blood runes are just too ez, and 500k an hour isn‚Äôt really that bad given the effort. Easily my favorite thing to do on mobile. 
---
Yeah you can do it. Me and my buddy did the same thing. First 10 or so raids sucked, but we eventually figured it out. Tbow drop at 78 kc too
---
Infernal Eels easily. Never need to bank. Makes lots of money too.
---
AFK Sandcrabs as well.
---
This is the only way. Computer at home, mobile at work
---
Isnt it 20?
---
99 farming was mainly funded by farm runs, had to sink some additional gp cuz I was getting antsy at the end.
---
99 pray was funded by a buddy who left me his account when he died of cancer. I thought 99 pray would be a cool way to honor him due to the skill cape emote :)
---
I lost 4b recently to the duel arena and blame it on relationship stress lol, my gf pissed me off so I chucked my bank 4 different times and lost each fight
---
Good thing I bought 8 at 140.
---
Mid level is probably around 75-100 combat level, or around 1000 total level.
---
I'm talking about new as in oldschol RuneScape. Since release of the game in 2013, there have been *many many* low and mid level item and content releases
---
Maybe if you actually said something intelligent with more then condescending marks maybe you could be of some use but you seem to just want attention. You might be a old school person but some people like to see progress. When was God wars released? 07. When osrc came back when was gwd released 2013. So if you enjoy getting your same old same old then you do your thing but I would like something new that I don't see in every pk video. 
---
Good to hear, fury is honestly overrated unless you want the defence/prayer bonuses. Anguish and torture on the other hand is definitely worth it whenever you have that kind of money

I was doing Client of Kourend a couple of weeks ago, and realized I forgot the feather to start the quest (Veos needs to enchant it so you can get signatures). Thinking I was being smart with my game knowledge, I was like "oh, they're seaguls on this dock somewhere, I'll just kill one and get a feather drop." Go find one and kill it, no feather.... TP back to GE and buy one for 2 gp.
---
But also never mind just saw ur previous posts ur a absolute brainlet with shit stats that thinks Arceeus spell book should replace summoning. It‚Äôs for prayer not to have a monster follow you to help you in combat or skill related activities. I know you won‚Äôt make a high effort post and that‚Äôs fine. Just understand that your ideas also won‚Äôt be well received.

Banging your Ex cost way more than 11$ and only lasts 1 minute. 2 minutes if your lucky. Osrs membership cost 11 for a month of soul sucking grinding. It‚Äôs not worth it. 
---
Alright thanks I'll do it up some.
---
 I've only see people spit ball and others just destroy it with hate so i figured i got a idea why not.
---
I believe it - I did a kill with only the dhcb (without woox walking) and got 56 seconds. The ruby (e) hits can really come in clutch. 
---
I totally agree with you!!! I remember the days when the new animation was introduced (in 2008 or so), we all laughed at it... and actually, I wanted not to laugh but to weep...
---
Fortunately, the new disgusting thing is only at MLM and Lovakenji. But I spend lots of time there, and I really hate the look. My female character looks like she is giving birth constantly. (((
---
Well. I suppose it's good we have at least  some variety in this. And tastes vary...
---
What others have said, you don‚Äôt use punches for this. It‚Äôs afk mining, you chisel some blocks really quick, then it‚Äôs back to the mine. Craft and repeat. No banking.

You realize this entire sub is a meme right? Stop taking everything people say so seriously
---
send me a screenshot of your stats/your RSN!
---
Imagine getting 99 prayer there, it's worse than best f2p method
---
Dude just do yourself a favor and cough up the 11 bucks.  Games are meant to be fun.  With your stats you'd spend a huge portion of your time in game grinding for cash just to sustain members.  
---
Pay the cash, enjoy your time in game, and keep the cash you earn to upgrade gear.  Down the road you can make 3m/hr and then bonds start to make sense if you're short on cash.
---
If you have even a minimum wage job working 2 extra hours per month covers that membership after taxes.  
---
When people think that every clue should be 1000k +, because they have spent an hour doing it
---
I conducted a research on this and this was also my conclusion.
---
Imagine being someone who knows literally nothing about oldschool RuneScape (I know this because you seem to show a complete lack of knowledge about updates we've had) and telling people they don't want progress. Dude go surf the wiki for 5 minutes before you start spouting nonsense all over the place.
---
Blood runes are a dream. 77 is worth it. Knock it out
---
No, I think it's genuine. I also fell the same way.
---
Probably has to do with the investors seeing a rapier being used in the teaser video as opposed to a dhcb. Rapier shot up 20m in a few days after the release of the teaser. 
---
Kind of surprised that the Alchemical Hydra isn't the Elite requirement instead of the regular Hydra, like how other slayer bosses are tasks in the other diaries. Very useful information!
---
Convincing costume. Looking like that I bet you can even click the Ice Barrage icon!
---
but keep 1234 total obviously
---
CIA would like to know your location
---
That's nuts
---
Personally I'm not a fan of instance-only bosses, game's becoming too much of an ironmeme. With many content I can sometimes not tell when I'm playing a regular or an IM account I'd love to see bosses where you can group up if you wish... Put back that MM in MMORPG.
---
But I like how it's task limited. It's been said that AH's better money that Vorkath, it'll be good to have a limiting factor on the income output of it.
---
Smash bros, nuclear throne, overmeme, Pok√©mon 
---
"Kill a Hydra"... So it isn't the boss, which means it can be killed off task with a boost.
---
Yeah its stupid to blame xenophobia, and I say that as someone who would be considered a liberal in the USA.
---
I don't care what u have you bimbo. And yeah video will prove 1sec response from jagex. How I hate you trolls 
---
you pay coconuts to protect the new fruit tree iirc.. idk what else would have done it.
---
Yeah because they make you leech this one to 120 for comp
---
&gt;forgetting that less than half a year ago a jagex staff member was involved in stealing over $200,000 worth of gold
---
I believe we already have too much money sinks tbh. 2018 gave us Torfinn's scamholding 2nd death policies, duel arena taxes and ToB failure fees. 
---
Very little do they.
---
I think they have said that the work they did for mobile including GPU compatibility would be ported over eventually. No idea how long though, may not even be this year.
---
Ooh damn, thanks man.
---
Wow maybe if you weren't obsessive with the word skill and took a second to read my response i added at the end "could also be favour" sound familiar?
---
Also it is a reskin has the same stats just added prayer bonus. And yeah that's better at high slayer? but if your doing really high slayer and you need prayer bonus you should have some better gear.
---
"Hey can you go get me something from the other side of the world map? And maybe hit up Draynor for some dyes?"

Though their quests were enlightening to hear about. Sure there's plenty of fetch quests, especially the easy ones in F2P, but there's a lot of quest specific content in this game, I thought that was the norm... this is the only MMO I've ever played
---
&gt;but a LOT more enjoyable than rc lmao
---
far from it lmao. i'd rather get 200m thieving pickpocketing men than do slayer
---
Gear?
---
Can you finish only the elite diary and get the new blessing? Or do we have to finish them all? Also do we have to finish a new raid, or is previously completed one going to count towards the diaries?

I truly hope so. Kinda have the feeling it won't stabilize in a very long time since it's been like this since the buff. 
---
Thanks for everything you all do!
---
What gear is better? Blessed dhide for range/prayer or arma for def and a bit higher range. Dhide is also useful in situations where you need range and melee becuase arma has negative melee bonuses. Its useful in some high level pvm, its just mid level gear. Either way, we're not getting new items simply because one person wants to look better or sport a specific God

Yeah especially in F2P there's a good amount of fetch quests. The first one you do, Cook's Assistant is a fetch quest.
---
Nah, no lie OSRS is run great when it comes to community interaction. Yeah, customer support could be better, but when it comes to having a say in what happens to your game, OSRS is one of if not the best.

Nice, completely dodged the question, ignored the context of what I was responding too, and even managed to somehow misuse direct quotes.

---
It isn't awful, but the amount of kills per trip isn't that great which cuts the gp/h drastically to the point that Zulrah is way better for consistent money. 
---
Green stuff honestly. 
---
Bgs for spec, zammy hasta + d defender, obsidian top and legs, serp helm (or slayer), torture necklace if on task, a salve amulet (ie) if off task, berserker ring, b gloves, dragon boots.
---
think of it as an investment for future games
---
It's called signalling. He doesn't have statistics but something that sounds believable to like-minded thinkers like himself. His comment is an opinion piece.

---
Yeah I know, it's just a matter of waiting. I want scaling UI more than that, but I think they go hand in hand. 
---
Yeah, they just said in the Q&amp;A that they felt that high runecrafting requirements were already in enough diaries so thought they'd keep it lower.
---
You can buy like 7 million rs gfs

I like to alch when I train agility and I like trying to be as efficient as possible with the alchs like trying to get in as many as I can before I do and obstacle

I would be upset too if I had to make responses that centered around something the other person had already denounced. Maybe if you were more mature or at least could grasp the idea of reading you would know: 
---
I don't want summoning in osrc 
---
My "skill" was also said to be "favour " since it could just be tasks 
---
Unrecognizable Runescape? Why because i said it would be cool to get some new weapons armor and items? 
---
Dam you must have downvotes every update for this game if that's all it takes 
---
Change? Add ons? New fuck that it would break that game.
---
Try not being so braindead when it comes to talking to someone you try so hard to win a argument but there is not one happening. 
---
This kinda surprised me too. Karamja has a 91 rc requirement. I woulda figured they would make a task to craft a soul rune :P
---
Reeeeeee 
---
You could carry it around but keep in mind that a lot of armor and equipment has a minus to the other styles but you can carry around a melee outfit in you backpack as well, nothing wrong with that.
---
But I'm pretty sure ranged and melee are more meta for continuous combat as the runes are pretty epensive for higher level spells.

How do you track the number of immigrants crossing over the border if they do it illegally? You can track people coming by plane because it's documented. Those statistics are biased and skewed.
---
The OG ridiculous ironmeme concept
---
shoulda been souls, 77 rc isn't really "elite" level.
---
So let's pretend that what you said is the case. 
---
You genuinely believe that in American history (or at least the recent portion that's relevant) that a huge portion of our illegal immigrant population was crossing the border by foot and up until now nobody thought of putting up a wall? You think that years ago when illegal immigration was at its peak our top brass were discussing what options we had and they just didn't think to build a big wall? If anything back then it made more sense. The numbers were way bigger, projected savings at the time would've been much higher. So if it didn't make sense then, why would it make sense now? and why would you know better than the people who were discussing this years ago?
---
Short answer: it doesn't, and you don't. 
---
I'm so happy to read that; I've got 48 and some nerd wrote "60 recommended" in the wiki and I *really* don't want to do twelve more levels of agility before a quest. 
---
Is that before or after they run a train on your wife 
---
Tell shoe size and height? 
---
Is the Karuulm Slayer dungeon not task only?
---
You can get every skill to 99 if you include those boundaries..
---
Nice irrelevant tangent you went on there. Walls have been proven to work time and time again. Are you trying to tell me you don't lock your door, or your car at night to deter strangers and criminals? You think the Vatican built a wall for aesthetic purposes? You're only lying to yourself if you think walls don't work. There's absolutely no reason *not* to build the wall regardless, illegal immigrants are an expensive net loss to this country and the wall would pay for itself by not allowing these people to come in. There's plenty of homeless people and veterans that need our assistance LONG before any of these aliens do.

That's awesome... Need to boost for quite a lot of potions... Thanks man :)
---
Amylase crystals ( Õ°‚óâ Õú ñ Õ°‚óâ)

cba to raid jagex ruined another update with dumb reqs
---
If you can trade stuff, a bunch of them. Can get 99 fletching in a day (honestly a few hours) with enough gold.
---
Wool gives xp
---
70 defence and 70 ranged before your first try my friend, the stats you have only people experienced in the fight caves and game mechanics will be able to complete 
---
It‚Äôs not **the** Balrog, it‚Äôs **a** Balrog. It‚Äôs an entire species of beings, not just one monster.
---
Fucking nerd.
---
Dibs on the Varrock Dark Wizards, gonna pwn all the noobs.
---
Come back to us when it's 123,456,789... Either go all the way or don't go at all, shame...
---
Requiring 96 rc for that would be perfectly in line with previous diary rewards though.
---
Just look at KQ shortcut
---
&gt; Serene is talking out of his ass
---
Nothing new about that.
---
That's true for almost anyone's first time with pretty much any stats...
---
By putting in the time on rooftop agility courses to get the required marks if grace.
---
I better get some itelligence now before the whole game needs to do it
---
keep running those laps, boy
---
No one grinded 95 slayer just for the diary. People who grinded 95 slayer for the update is clearly because of the new boss. Using common sense is hard isn't it?
---
Was this on purpose
---
Regular hydra can be killed off task though, so it's boostable
---
I think salas will always be fastest xp, but chins at that level just become a good viable money xp method
---
Already need 90 woodcutting and 95 slayer for the diary so it's fair 
---
Play
---
You can just get boosted through a raid though, not very hard.
---
Why is this in r/2007scape?
---
 if theres a link and it says there quiting its a scam woox had a lot of these scammers 
---
What is that blue item called? Or furniture
---
Invention? Fuck that. Item sinks suck. I quit EOC because of Invention 
---
lol just keep at it
---
Sort of like WoW set in Gielinor, the skills, quests and everything stay the same. As does the map except it's more vast. But with improved combat but not EoC style, I'd like it if they tried something new entirely. Perhaps more  mount and blade style thing. 
---
not worth it tbh
---
Drugs are substances that cause a physiological response or change in your body.
---
The word ‚ÄúDrug,‚Äù does have a negative stigma attached to it, but the definition is legitimate. 
---
Google will help you.
---
Since you haven‚Äôt left your stats, or what you did to make the gp to buy a bond, I‚Äôd guess whatever you were doing before might be easier in a p2p world without as many bots.
---
I‚Äôd recommend paying for the first month of membership so you can focus on levelling and questing to get to the point where you can do blast furnace, herb runs, staves, etc
---
Could do it like EOC. When you die you go to Death office and have to pay for your items back. You can pick and chose what you want back as well. 
---
Lol you stopped talking to him because he sells gold üòÇ?
---
Could be spoofing the from address. 
---
Is nmz still an ez 99 max melee or did they patch it 
---
If I was crafty, I‚Äôd photoshop Nieve onto that notorious black couch... but I‚Äôm not.
---
But it's not rng so that's why
---
1 bond is 14 days
---
abortion is a meme
---
Omg i kinda feel bad for participating. Hes probably joking and now he hs negative karma üòÖ. 
---
If it was a month i wouldn't be so stressed rn
---
That's what he means... Runelite can change the shift click option on any item so you make the tar and herb do ''use'' on shift click, and keep all the fish on ''drop''. Have shift always held with on screen keyboard or sticky keys, and all you gotta do is click on everything without caring about shift.
---
You can craft a soul rune with a +5 boost at level 85 Runecrafting. 
---
You need level 86 for karamja elite, which rewards you with being able to jump on a stepping stone. üòÇ
---
FFS I needed to buy those for my Magic Tree‚Äôs REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Imagine runecrafting or agility
---
Faux said it would be level 40 :(
---
You will have it easily by level 65
---
Hey just a heads up but I started looking more into doing this method but it seems that it's not worth it because you actually mixed up your xp. You got 404k fm and only 150k prayer. Which pretty much nulls it being any good for ironmen.
---
This was my first time finishing up Monkey Madness and I couldn't stop laughing when the Quiz Master appeared in the middle of the boss fight, thought I would share. Too bad he couldn't help out in the fight!
---
Same. But I play other stuff like league which totally justifies it and definitely requires a 1080ti
---
totally
---
The week I played FF15 was glorious though
---
Totally agree. I think that the problem right now is that legal entry and asylum claims take insane amounts of time to process due to under funding and under staffing. If we sent the same number of case workers instead of military, we would not have the problem we do right now.
---
I'm all for control of immigration, but in order to do that we need to staff and fund appropriately.
---
Just never turn off mage pray from 31 onward until after the 360s been killed. Bats, 90, then 360, pray off then the melees and pray back on before the next wave starts. Don't even worry about trying to flick, you're restores and pray puts should last you.
---
Last q&amp;a they all mentioned they think it‚Äôs too strong for leveling.
---
I‚Äôd guess were a ways off it being nerfed, but it‚Äôs a definite possibility in the near future. After Kebos I‚Äôd guess they‚Äôll do it as an integrity change cause nerfing it would never pass a poll
---
He's a 1 hunter pure, noob
---
that splash sesh was lit fam
---
If you 3 tick red chins they will be faster. 
---
Black chins are probably faster even without 3 tick.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm just seeing how I do with those stats. I most likely won‚Äôt succeed but I‚Äôm pretty lucky when it comes to doing hard things on mmos so I was just gonna dabble with it
---
When I was 18 I was prescribed, I shit you not, 90 30mg IR Adderall a month. It was fucked up.  
---
Lol those make me chuckle.  I use maybe 10 prayer points, a bolt or two, 2 freezes, and like 40 seconds.  Not exactly a ton of resources, and you might have a full inventory of superiors or something 
---
New source of battlestaves? Better sell mine now
---
so you can have more ~~porn~~ youtube video tabs open at once 
---
Do you blowpipe any tasks?
---
Thanks!!
---
At 99 black chins are about 240k/hr and red chins in the hunting grounds are almost 200k.
---
No where did I mention Invention....
---
All I said was item sink. Also there's nothing wrong with an item sink, it helps maintain the item prices.
---
If you're low level, chaos druids underneath  edgville drop valuable  herbs. You can always do dragons. Or flesh crawlers.
---
I can‚Äôt believe they made steel 2h a real thing in irl based off runescape 
---
You‚Äôre full of shit if you went from 1-50 on rooftops with only 60 marks. You can‚Äôt even start rooftops till lvl 10.
---
only 71 range lol... that is one thing I have always been slack on is range.  
---
I could possibly buy a bunch of chins and get that up?
---
Go do Chambers of xeric then, same thing pretty much 
---
Purple is my least favorite color so I agree completely
---
You could easily use genie lamps to get to 20 agility, and that would give you access to the agility course in Al kharid :p
---
Don‚Äôt get DFS. Dragon defender takes priority, unless you‚Äôre hellbent on dragon tasks - the only time DFS would really make sense for slayer. 
---
Get prims, tassets, then torture. 
---
Did it take you 10 hours to complete the quest?
---
I ended up using the flinch method, felt cheap but it worked.
---
Because you added nothing to the conversation lol
---
Once I unlocked them of course there keyboard warrior
---
Use elite void. Bonuses stack with salve ammy so it's always best to use at vorkath 
---
Thank Ash 95 slayer isn't an elite diary req 
---
For his final phase?
---
Thanks, I have DD already.  
---
What about Bandos chest? where would you put that in? after torture?
---
What do you even do with that much gp? I feel like I would have nothing to work for anymore.
---
My wife the other day actually commented on the point of me getting new alienware/MSI laptops for all I do is play OSRS, New Vegas and sit on reddit. Its for the feels
---
A lot of people have a hard time getting to the back of the pickup truck.
---
Bastion potions are where it‚Äôs at for ranging now. That‚Äôs why dwarf weed is cheap
---
It can be done, But i think you are going to need to Range pot all the 360+ waves.
---
So like 4 brews, 4 ranging pots rest restores. You will need to be good at not taking damage though
---
If you‚Äôre using total level worlds you‚Äôre doing it wrong
---
they dropped again
---
YOU NEED TO PAY 10GP TO PASS!
---
If you don‚Äôt like the drop, you don‚Äôt have to pick it up. No one forces you. 
---
This is a thing? The reason I've never set a pin is because of how annoying it used to be whenever hopping. Good to know maybe I'll set on up now 
---
Can‚Äôt run it 6 hours anymore but I afk it all day on mobile 
---
What announcement?
---
Same here
---
Sweet 
---
1. There's more than just str to train, but attack and def too. You can argue def isn't required since you can wait for 70 atk and a whip, but the attack is absolutely required and needs to be counted in the time saved by the scim.
---
2. Quests are 100% worth doing, especially on a main, and monkey madness is required for a lot of other insanely good quests like RFD and MM2 that give amazing rewards.
---
3. Reread the very first sentence of your comment and take your own advice, cause you're so wrong there's nothing you can say to justify your statement.
---
Let's be friends 
---
He‚Äôs not talking about the security and performance being the reason he won‚Äôt go back tho.
---
He has like 4 alts with well over 99 RC and is usually doing xp rates that arent optimal because he is doing it for money 
---
Am I understanding this correctly? The way I read it, they meant to say "incompetent" instead of "competent"?
---
So as to say:
---
*WoW would look like runescape if the WoW art team had the same competency as the WoW dev team.*
---
Meaning that, since runescape looks ugly, WoW has a poor dev team because they are saying if the art was equal to development, then WoW would look ugly (like runescape).
---
Is this right..? Or did I misunderstand? Because I don't see how calling runescape ugly in order to insult the WoW dev team is "praise for runescape".
---
Smash and new games that come out, otherwise usually just OSRS, play some mobile games too 
---
The roasts are real lmaoo
---
I mean how annoying is it that you‚Äôre training and some guy just comes to kill you for your 50-100 noted d bones when instead if they were skilled they could fight people who bother fighting back and make more money. 
---
You could scout raids and just do ones without tekton
---
Whatever I want, mainly lots of platinum tokens 
---
They really need to switch around completing one raid and teleporting to raids. 
---
Completing one raid should be a hard req and teleporting to raids (requires 1/10 drop from raids) should be elite. This doesn‚Äôt make sense as is.
---
Which is very good, due to milions being added to the game every minute just from zulrah only. This game badly needs a moneysinks untill some kind of punishfull death mechanics are finally implemented. Gravestone to unlock for 1k* your lvl (so 126k at max) should be enough. 
---
Tbh BCP isn't really that high of a necessity unless you have everything else and can afford it. Torso works just fine. I just got combat 85 and am really starting my slayer grind, 57 slay atm. Youre gonna be pray flicking most tasks anyways (especially for someone like me who is 66 def, working on 70 for piety) but regardless you'll want to flick for faster exp. I would just use torso and tassets. At least thats what I'm aiming for. 
---
Just my opinion. If you have everything else and can afford BCP then get it since its better defense than torso. If not though just use torso and ob legs until tassys. 
---
You cant afk for 6 hrs anymore, it stops you at 5 or 20 mins i forget.
---
Are you from zchat?
---
No one cares about your opinion 
---
I'm not 90 herb so I need tekton or muttadile 100% of the time. And cause I can't hit I need muttadile only. Its doable, but frustrating.
---
Im in that golden player level where when I get attacked doing wildy clues, it's almost always a pure, and I get that rush of seeing who wins: Their ice blocks or my 3 sharks and DDS spec. 
---
Mostly, it's the ice blocks, and I lose a spade and a couple minutes going back. But once or twice you get those magic numbers and you get yourself a sweet 100k worth of wildy rags in addition to your 50k clue chest.
---
You can finally play the game now
---
Did you log into a deadman world?
---
Actually super combat with range pot is meta, use both then BGS/DWH spec.
---

Looks like an entertainment folder but WhatsApp is throwing me off

Omg that d1ck in the map
---
You don‚Äôt want to do the highest rooftop course you can do. look up most efficient for marks 
---
It was the very first diary to come out. They probably were still working out the kinks. 
---
How would you incorporate an item sink?
---
haha the helmet...
---
lmfao I got a brand new alienware for Christmas and all I've done on it is play chess and runescape lmfao
---
Figured the quest would take 3 hours or so. If the using a d scim doesnt save more time than it takes to do the quest, then it isnt worth it if you wont ever use the scim later.
---
Invention was one of the best things to happen to the rs3 economy lol
---
Development team is still stuck in 2004
---
Let critical have his fun
---
Nope, just looked on world 301 with a fresh acc.
---
Totally expected to get a bunch of screeching replies like this
---
The fact of the matter is the quest does not save more time than it takes to do in regards to leveling. Its worth doing the quest later. If all you're trying to do is level an account, which I was, its faster to use a d long to get to 70/70. I also mentioned attack but you somehow glossed over that.
---
Cancelled the promised bank rework.
---
Prime hits pretty hard if you're not paying attention and you're sitting in melee tank.

Looks accurate. Completely overkill, yet still does a poor job because of the single thread CPU and max. 51 fps limitations.

The elite reqs are raid boss compared to the other elites though

You're right, my bad..

I dont know if it's still up or not, but they claim to post their sources on their website. I haven't checked it out, but if that is the case, going to those sources would be a good way to confirm or deny what is said. 
---
I‚Äôve notice a sort of 50/50 trend on that front. I still don‚Äôt get it, really, but someone‚Äôs said like ‚ÄòNew Year, New Serene‚Äô so I guess we‚Äôll see. 
---
It‚Äôs supposedly even harder with a Mac to get viruses, but after helping my tech illiterate friends with their shit I‚Äôm not so sure lmao
---
I was afraid we had to get the farming outfit but luckily that doesn't seem the case. 
---
Hey Mod Kieren,
---
One more question regarding the Diary. If you already have completed a Raid, will this task be already ticked off for you or do you have to complete an additional one?
---
I assume the rest of the requirements would require re-doing, regardless of if you've done them before. As raids 1 tracks KC I wondered if this would be the case :)
---
No tome, rip. Stopped wintertodt on my iron man at 94 fm, was just too boring lmao
---
Yeah, your membership pays for both games.
---
Your stats dont carry over though.
---
I used to do this at sand crabs, if I used 'bot, botter or botting' in sentences it did work.
---
Yes. Stats and shit won't carry over though
---
What carries over then? Only membership?
---
Now just need 123,456,789 overall xp
---
I‚Äôm prescribed  30 70mg vyvanse, 30 36mg concerta, 120 10mg Ritalin IR and 120 diazepam a month
---
I only use the vyvanse but somehow (don‚Äôt ask me why) I can still pick up the rest of em. I just collect them all tho never sell them no one buys them here (UK)
---
You can touch my goose instead :) 
---
no one cares about you
---
Probably just forgot there's an i9
---
Most of the Raids ‚Äòreqs‚Äô are in gear in a way... You can get away with lower stats in high-end gear, but raids are more difficult with cheap gear if your stats are not high
---
nice thx
---
Doesnt say kill boss hydra, just kill a hydra. Also one of the wildy tasks is teleport using ghorrock if im not mistaken, which is 96 mage req.
---
Bobnob50
---
Tekton is first in the challenge mode raids. Go do challenge mode to practice Tekton! Then reset after each attempt
---
Luckily he didn't, good guy
---
You're right
---
I would hope he didn‚Äôt forget what the $500 CPU he bought was.
---
I cry about getting pked at literally the only area in which one can be pked. 
---
Can you? Yes. Should you? Absolutely not.
---
Yeah.
---
I did this for a while, its how I've got the movement down and take no damage. My issue is dealing damage. I might have to go back into challenge mode with an Elder maul at this rate :(
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt realize they were actually 2 different monsters.  Also you can use imbued heart to boost up for ghorrock teleport (not 100% sure).  
---
This hits way too close to home. Recently bought a *gaming* laptop after selling my gaming desktop thinking I would play more demanding games on the go, but after the first week of basically playing games just to benchmark them I returned to playing OSRS, mount and blade, and dungeoncrawl stone soup(an ascii based game). The sad thing is I still haven't learned my lesson. Just built another gaming desktop and the pattern repeats. I just enjoy the high of testing out new equipment too much I guess. 
---
Pretty rare, not too rare
---
why though, I like osrs it's why I started years later but rs3 seems like a legitimate upgrade
---
If I watch a stream while in that area the stream literally stops working for RS to render and keep the game going. Super pretty, badly optimized.
---
A
---
Im sorry, gl
---
What do you pray?
---
Don't grind the rune scim if you ever plan to actually p2p in the future, rune sword is nearly identical and you can buy it from the champions guild. Grind agility and buy laws and nats from shops. Getting those runes in f2p is an absolute pain. 
---
Aw gl sir

Cool, thanks for the confirmation!
---
Lots of sitting behind rocks
---
Lead him to a new website to join the White Legion

The lack of exposed feet this time make me sad

That‚Äôs the point. It was made as a straight upgrade.

Okay and i just checked it out, it seems like hes pretty mentally healthy, and also he has done 60 push ups and sit ups a day for a few years which is more physical activity then probably 90 percent of us
---
What do you mean by Macs being lighter on resources? Why do Mac cost so much more even when compared to PCs with equivalent specs?
---
I challenge someone to Pi Exp
---
what? hybrid = using 2 attack styles. range into melee is hybridding. almost all pures do this.
---
Only if you allow people that created accounts before the change and have used the gate at least once a month (continuously) to still pay 10 gp
---
Im so confuaed about what everyone is seeing. Can someone explain
---
NMZ is also significantly less afk
---
This is the first comment in a while that gave me a range of facial expressions from reading. Well done. 
---
:(
---
Edit: the fine folks at the Deliveritems cc helped me out!
---
There is a mechanic where you can drop a clue, kill a monster and get that clue again, and pick up both. 
---
Its really only used for accounts that limit themselves to a particular area (karamja). In your case, maybe just a glitch?
---
I‚Äôd add on doing wildly slayer for your rune pouch (buy it using emblems from the BH store, don‚Äôt bother buying it from the slayer master), and you‚Äôll get a nice pile of points for your troubles. Also don‚Äôt forget that keeping up with crafting uncharged orbs + charging those orbs + zaff‚Äôs  daily battlestaves + alch those mfers will keep your cash stack steadily growing for any task you may need to tackle.
---
Talk about power creep... this quickly becomes Bis pet. smh. 
---
Wrong. He‚Äôs talking about the GPU itself, which is not an APU. It‚Äôs an integrated GPU. And APU would be the whole chip: the CPU and GPU combination.
---
Yeah you probably could
---
Thanks ! I messaged them
---
That is not what hybrid means... hybrid means mage melee
---
Yeah, we know. Thanks for being the 1,002,243,785th person to tell us. Want a gold star?
---
is it still there?
---
Thank you. I'll try that.
---
Shut up serene
---
That's... the point?

Fire strike and spot them at the east wildy location for them which will be like 10k risk. Or do babies

Removing wildy and implementing a trade limit was the only way of combatting Real World Trading and the lawsuit/fine they were about to get from companies/banks.  
---
Rs3's microtransactions are keeping OSRS alive.
---
In addition all the things you just complained about are RS3 things, which has no place on this Subreddit though, this is Oldschool.
---
Judging by the comments it seems I'm the only person up to now who has always seen two legs.. damn. 
---
It‚Äôs strong enough for people with 45 Defence 
---
They also poll all new content so the players can decide what gets made, make fantastic content, and actually communicate with the community. Sure they have their issues but they (The old school team, at least) is one of the better game dev companies imo.
---
I was not aware that was the case with the other boss storage units
---
You haven't shown anything, you've just ignored obvious facts and cracked jokes. 
---
Karamja Elite has one of the worst rewards and is locked behind 91 RC. I'd argue that the Kourend diary rewards are much better and require, with souls as a requirement, only 90 RC. I fail to see the problem.
---
What did the comment originally say?
---
It is rng you just don‚Äôt have a chance to get it till you get the diary
---
There are few who can
---
Only comes in XXXXXXXL
---
Legit question: how profitable is double Nats really? Isn't it only like 2m/hr, putting it at a solid middle of the pack in terms of money making?
---
Fuck I wish that were me 
---
Doubt it. Most people who spend less just buy whatever is cheapest. Enthusiasts who buy their own parts know their shit 90% of the time and spend the most.
---
probably would have been a hard tier task too, i‚Äôm so happy. 
---
They should have made is a quiver or something that can be used with ammo, this is ranger racism!

It really is considering i7s don‚Äôt have hyperthreading anymore. I7 is the old i5 and the i9 is the old i7 with a couple more cores

World hop before 12 seconds - the stat drops are counted on a 12 second timer, when 5 are reached (60 seconds) the stat drops.
---
Fucking Christ, you got me right in the feels!
---
Something I'm going to clarify since it's not mentioned in your post.  You rock cake down to 1hp in NMZ then drink absorb potions.  Overload is simply a -50 hp for increased combat stats for 5 minutes (and you gain 50 hp at the end of it).  
---
You can do hard customized rumble, and the bosses are suggested on the wiki because some bosses come in sets and some have annoying mechanics.  Just read up on each one that is annoying enough for you and disable it.
---
You can do NMZ without prayer or dharoks, but you still need to be at 1hp with absorb up for the training to work efficiently enough.  And prayer flick rapid heal every 45s so you don't Regen up to 2hp (or just guzzle rock cake again) 
---
Infinite tele to the current highest lvl slayer master and double tokkul is pretty good imo

Nah rocktails are from rs3 in the living rocks cavern

You could genie lamp up to 9 Hunter, and then catch baby implings until 99

Hard mode just makes the bosses have higher hp and str but not defence so you always want hard mode. Always use ovls nomatter if you use dh or not. Depends on what you're trying to achieve, since you want xp i would go: count draynor, sand snake, the kendal, tree spirit, me
---
The more money it gets from tax the area gets more wealthy looking! 
---
&gt;They also poll all new content so the players can decide what gets made
---
They implemented a mob rule into the game. Bravo. Now, 49% of the players have their freedom taken away by the other 51%. Simple majority bullshit. Wonderful! 
---
&gt;and actually communicate with the community.

Lol.

is there somewhere else you would recommend for learning raids? I am interested but intimidated by raids
---
Not everything needs to be bis somewhere.
---
i know, but they have said that there was gonna be a big overhaul aswell. 
---
Calquats, clue scrolls, getting to shilo... IDK just a lot of stuff takes me from brimhaven to get somewhere else. I route a lot of stuff to pass by the coconut tree though in order to harvest them even if it's not the fastest route.

Alright, nice. I can't type out a full response since I'm on mobile myself for the moment.
---
I'll say this though, the zenyte jewelry might be a bit underwhelming when you first get them. It's not like when you buy, for example, a brand new abyssal dagger when you've been using a d scim for the last 10 levels. But if you think about it, you use that necklace whenever you use melee (unless you use salve ammy) and in the long term it will give you very good value over time. 
---
Then why do you want a new PC? Just save your money. Keep using the current one until it's so shit that it won't turn on.

If we‚Äôve already completed a task before release will it automatically be completed after release? Or do we have to do it again after the update
---
APUs are different. While the integrated graphics processor on Intel chips are embedded into the processor silicon, essentially making it one monolithic functional unit at a higher level, AMD's APUs actually put a full discrete graphics chip on the same processor die as the CPU. Of course, the fact that they have to share the same physical space means sacrificing CPU and GPU complexity, but you still get a fully capable GPU.

i got core 45kc and jar 77 kc and another jar 290 ish kc now im at 1k kc + think iv had 2 or 3 jars and 4-5 cores and alot granite drops still missing the pet tho :d

Chat is at the top instead of the bottom.

I can imagine an ad at the beginning bringing the total in my head to 7. But yea ad block.
---
It might be bought accounts that was hand made somewhere that values time way lower than the 1st world countries.
---
Then the botters are betting on having them run long enough to recoup the cost and make profit.

Did both clues shit rewards 2nd clue only had to do one step 33k reward lol

I have never in 15 years see someone refer to range melee as hybrid.

---
There is also an ad at the very end if you zoom in on the picture, making 8 ads in a 10 minute video. Fuck that 
---
That‚Äôs really all I‚Äôm doing is pet hunting and trying to grab some granite dust. I‚Äôll do maybe 50 of these and head back to regular gargs

Actually it seems that the slayer helmet is indeed better when using melee with his setup.  Using void most definitely eliminates this difference, but without void, slay helm is better than salve.  
---
grats i got my first unsired on 25th and another one on 40th or so now im 20 kc dry, got 1 bludgeon and 1 abby whip, always nice to see a pet pop up when you used it wish i get this next grats
---
Yeah, training agility felt like a time waste. Graceful being less useful than I though it would didn't help either.

Most likely a GBA rom. So you can play it on mobile using some apps or a GBA emulator

I have never in my 14 yrs of rs seen someone say hybrid is only mage/melee
---
99 farm and despite the very high success rate of the spell at 99....it still fails for me so frequently. 
---
Now make an account with that total level but one of the stats is already 99 and then go for over 100m xp to have 123,456,789
---
He's ban on sight.
---
You bring additional switches such as a couple soul runes and salve (e) and then drop them, making room for more brews before verzik. You also drink and eventually drop your range pot and one of your super combats, making even more room for brews.
---
Typical void (no bandos) setup will walk into the raid with 6 brews and into verzik with 10 - unless verzik is really scuffed you likely will leave with 6 or more brews.
---
I did and I had no virus or anything. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what in the heck happened, but in the end I don‚Äôt really care. I made my goal of maxing and haven‚Äôt played since.

I did reenable auth and change my password....again, just so my account wouldn‚Äôt get abused/banned.

RSM channel sucks anyway . I made YT stop suggesting that channel

I have used a PC without antivirus other than windows defender on win10 since it's release and have never had a virus because I'm not a fucking idiot who downloads .exe files from porn or movie sites. The virus argument is just used by mac fanboys to justify their overpriced machines.

&gt; It's also always taken over a month for names to be released after changing them once.
---
Completely incorrect, otherwise youtubers with 100k+ subs wouldn't be making videos saying ''Make sure to change your name through the website as this reserves the name while changing in-game does not''
---
Has to be a recent change

It's not illegal if people use a legitimate ROM and modify it by injecting new code, and your new code does not contain Nintendo assets. It's basically like buying a Mario painting, then paying someone to paint over top of it. It's legal. Not all projects or programmers have the diligence or ability to completely separate the assets though. 
---

STOP RIGHT NOW, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

You guys are talking shit through a paper asshole... XD

Plus you can have 50 fucking characters for that amount.
---
Pretty sure you don't know how any of this works.
---
Scales are not money, thus money is not added to the game at Zulrah. For you to get money out of it, someone else has to pay for it = no money is generated

Can we get 12345 upvotes?

What‚Äôs your RC level? Lol

Lol no.  If you really want me to drop some math on you I will but the short answer is lol no.

I‚Äôm also on the middle of getting void knight armor would that be better than everything else

You've ruined chaps forever

no

I was more shook when I realized that the newcomer map wasn't an arm tbh

Never noticed the arrows on the leg either.

Hows the chemo going?

some people like the idea of getting everything without paying, I personally find f2p terrible but I kinda understand it

You‚Äôre all wrong. The APU correlates to the transient electric current between the ACPU and the TGM, nothing to do with graphics.

What is your favourite guild and how does it make you feel?

I played a lot in 2005, and I still think dragon long/d platelegs/granite shield/berserker helm/rune armor/glory looks cool.

I wanna do the morytania hard diaries so I can make money at barrows but apart from that just back to slayer

whatcha mean?

anyone know if it's possible to boost for the level 74 tithe farm seeds? they're the only req i don't have for the hard diary
---
And how long did it take you to realise a plateskirt is actually a bed. Hmm?
---
Because they don't think of it in a rational way like how I laid it out. Similar to people that don't understand opportunity cost and think that because they got say mithril bars as a drop it's free smithing xp.
---
Thanks so much! Now I can plan out routes without pulling everything apart in Sony Vegas.

All of you are completely wrong. It's 7.

Two things:
---
- I think instanced rooms make for better singleplayer fights, even if it's an MMORPG. I don't want bosses to become something like Corporeal Beast where you can just have a bunch of players smacking the boss until it's dead. Also, Ironman mode exists and that will allways be taken into consideration. I'm on and off with the idea of instanced fights but it feels like the best out of a bad set of choices.
---
- The chest fee for item recovery. Now this is the kind of "ezscape" features that the community should be adamant against including. We have stopped rewarding getting good and confident at a boss and just encourage players to either look up guides on Youtube or die endlessly until they sort of brute-force it.
---
I don't want death to become just a nuisance or a slap in the wrist *(Seriously, if you are 95 Slayer then you probably have 10-100 times 100k just in items in your bank)*.
---
Nah, should mimic irl al Kharid, just have a prince behead journalists and build a 800 billion dollar estate. The rest of al Kharid‚Äôs infrastructure should be failing.

Im usually not brainded. Its not that hars setting up or out a auth lmao. Was wondering if service was down but obiviously fucking broke.
---
Use an elder maul, he melts
---
Nope regular hydras are not required to be on task to kill. 
---
Clueless based on what? Controlled gives rounded experience for all melee. Explain how I'm clueless, because it's a fact you get str xp from it. 
---
I remember way back when rune essence bots had an auto responder, so when you would say ‚Äúare you a bot‚Äù at varrock east bank, hundreds of them would say ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù.

Did you mean to reply to the guy I replied to? I didn't say anything about the diary equip being bad. I just think it would've been cool to go with a quiver since then we'd have another rehash of something from RS3 (which I like seeing, as a former RS3 player).

There are a lot of skills that have a level 70-80 skill being a (pretty much) sole requirement for an elite, so it's not like this is a new idea:  
---
* Palm &amp; Calquat trees (Karamja)  
---
* Magic tree (Western Province)  
---
* Dwarf Weed (Kandarin)  
---
* 140+ water runes (Lumbridge)
---
* 100+ earth runes (Varrock)
---
* Steal from the Dorgesh-Kaan chest (Lumbridge)  
---
* Chop Magic Trees (Lumbridge)  
---
While looking at the list, I also realized there isn't a single "Hard" requirement that requires a skill to be 76 or above.
---

Just rescout

Now make a new account and do it again so that in order, left to right, top to bottom, your skills are as close to numerically ordered as possible.

The issue comes from redistribution, not creation. Realistically you should be fine if you make custom assets based on preexisting work, but in theory a company can cease and desist your work based on the fact that they own the rights to the concepts you replicate. Companies often don't bother (mostly because of the bad press involved and the free advertising that mods do for the games they're based on) but companies like Nintendo are pretty litigation happy. Even if a judge would eventually rule in your favour you might well find yourself tens of thousands of dollars down due to legal fees. In shouldn't be a thing that companies can do to shut down individuals but it is, and there's very little that can be done to stop it outside of disallowing companies from suing private citizens. As with a bunch of shit it's who has the deepest purse.

If you're high enough level to smelt cannonballs, it's a pretty good profit to buy steel bars and sell back as cannonballs, I think it's around a 200-300gp profit per bar. It's a pretty afk method too so I like to watch shows while doing so.
