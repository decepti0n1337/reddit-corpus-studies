This is actually better than settled's, watch it!
---
Big if true
---
wtf is this army of strawmen.
---

---
&gt; There shouldn't be risk of your bank value going down.
---
never said there should. no risk of bank value going down = only risking your time.
---
&gt; The only two encounters in pvm that risk your bank value going down in pvm are ToB and Vorkath, which btw, the gear you risk at revs is worth more than that.
---
relevant how?
---
Hahahaha so true
---
Can't you go to the Wise old man and let him delete them for you? I believe he won't remove the quest items that are usefull outside the quests such as the Holy wrench
---
&gt; Make an ironman
---
&gt; Stop wasting your time
---
Choose one.
---
What image do you use for looking rotations? I have been struggling to find a good one. 
---
Also, gz on the nice drop.  
---
Regards,
---
Guy who keeps dying at Zulrah...
---
Too much engine work
---
that guy hit the gold mine with his content
---
i mean i love it as well, why did i not come up with this
---
k, thanks for the help. 
---
#O
---
pls no
---
No green patch? C'mon RS, you're letting IRL do it better.
---
Yeah, the ovl is weaker than a super combat but much stronger than ranging or magic potions. So not adding it is not a problem with me
---
Thank you!
---
88% is the goal. 
---
ooooooooooooooooo wahhhhhhh
---
You got it man. It’ll take a few tries to get over the jitters of Jad but it’s not so bad once you get used to him 
---
Costs a bit to do efficiently and servers little to no purpose.
---
Well you can use it to save of for a bond if you want to try membership, or put it toward leveling a skill or even some gear!
---
I posted a rough draft to guage responses and make changes before making a higher effort post...
---
sorry i forgot about the lance, but the rapier, there is nothing wrong with that, i made this before the kebos lowland updates. Ow and about barrows gloves, these are 130k... and the kbd is a LOW level boss, so this guide is not just for high levels
---
Yes!!! Do this please!
---
I feel you, today I had pet at 160kc 😅
---
The first few pics are my untrade able and quest items. But yeah majority of what I have are trade able stuff.
---
ya, I am going to hop on a tournament world tomorrow and start really learning everything.  most depressing part of this all is im 120cb
---
Run energy was gone too... I was freaking out
---
Wanna buy a box?
---
No idea but personally I'm not going to think about it for a longgg time
---
How do you fall for this? The syntax is beyond ranarrded. 
---
I play RS3 and I got to 93 the good ole' hard way. Remember RS3 players love to play osrs also!
---
Yeah probably around 3 bil for everything. :( 
---
The game survived because the balance of progression and nostalgia that the game has to offer in its perfect form. PvP is a big part is osrs but I’m no way is the staple in which the game has survived. It’s got the player because it has today because they have had years and years of trial and error with content in the game and a well balanced system that makes up every quality of a good mmo. There’s wayyyy to much enjoyable pvm content and skill progression that the game has to offer for it to be looked over for just pvp.
---
If you want afk then BP + NMZ + Blessed d'hide = your best bet. Mith darts, some range potions (or extreme ranges from nmz if you have some points) and auto retaliate. You're good to go. It'll be a bit more pricey for the cost of afk however.
---
Gzz mate :) I know it's common to say "literally shaking" but I was literally shaking after I killed zuk. Called my friend and my voice was wavering lol
---
Gratz man! Just got my first 99 ever too!
---
no point replying, they will check logs when they have motivation to resolve this.
---
'Mitch'
---
The hero we didn’t know we needed. 
---
Underrated comment
---
oh no theres def xp waste, but its multiplied by like 5 so it just looks like less lmao
---
That's what he told me it was for.
---
I don't watch his vids so idk if he's finished it yet. Perhaps he's waiting til he actually hits 99 to release it, or perhaps there's just a lot of content. 
---
How is it any different? You never have to move your mouse. Just hold down and fkey and click
---
This is in no way related lmfao
---
Firemaking was 6th rarest cape before wintertodt was released. It's now right behind fletching now lol.
---
i cant see the amount ofm axed players?
---
Pest control with chins/blowpipe (not sure if chinns are better) but chinning at shitty spots arent more efficient. You cant chin at mm tunnel withput attack xp, idk if you missed that or what you mean. 
---
Q
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Eh? How? I might wanna do it while I feel lazy and I want to afk. 
---
88 kc? Just got my first tanzanite at 1050 yesterday 
---
Not sure if you are braindead but if there are 120k+ people online at one given time, that doesn't mean there's only 120k members playing.
---
Yes it is idiot
---
Only 1 strength level to go until you ruin your account! &lt;3
---
How are they doing the animation smoothing and GPU stuff then? 
---
Even with access to ancients, chinning is the fastest possible hp xp in the game. Ancients are not.
---
&gt; rare and difficult
---
I did 88-99 smithing lately with adamant platebodies and it was as easy as wintertodt imo, probably even easier.
---
Loved the vid again!
---
Could be wrong, but I think you missed an obvious troll.
---
his music is trash
---
Let's not act like Runecrafting is hard in any way, shape, or form. It's *tedious*. It's *not fun*. It's 99% bank running, 1% crafting runes. No skill involved.
---
Removing some of the tedium wouldn't make the game *easier*, it would make the grind *easier to tolerate*, and there's a HUGE difference between the two.
---
Who these guys? The guy who made this thread did not start range yet and the other one did not chin hp. 
---
I really would love to see more skills tie into construction. The vat idea for tinctures is cool, and could be worked on in par with construction - like higher level vat yields better tinctures.
---
When sailing was seriously being thought of as a skill, I thought it was silly they didn't want it to tie into construction. Like you're building a ship, using VERY similar skills to an already existing skill. It could have been very cool.
---
&gt;Surprised that fishing is lower than woodcutting considering it's better and easier in most ways.
---
WC is a lot easier from lvl 90. Redwoods are literally 5min afkable, decent xp and you only have to drop like 5 inventories per hour. Compared to barb fishing, where you fish like 1k fish per hour, making it like 40 inventories, not to mention barb fishing being way less afk.
---
Nope. :(
---
It was possible for a little while because of a bug I believe, but not possible as of right now.
---
2.14% is the probability of doing 244 kills and not getting a 1/64 drop.
---
Uim restricted to tutorial island, imagine the content
---
But that is not what is happening here. Updates don't make it harder to do engine work, at least for the most part. Something like the recent Farming Update would have made it harder to rewrite the Farming Ticks, but adding new monster or tweaking stats won't cause an issue. But sitting around for a few month-years with no updates wouldn't make the engine work be done much quicker and it wouldn't be good for the game.
---
The 50 different variants of charged DFS should be interesting 😂
---
I can help if u want :p
---
Someone who 1 tics range attacks and only range attacks can be blocked fairly easily, but someone who can 1 tic mage as well is very difficult to deal with. If someone switches to mage but they can’t 1 tic I only need to flash mage prayer for the tic they would attack, and then if they decide to fake back to range, I would already be on range prayer after flashing mage pray. But if they 1 tic barrage me there’s a bigger margin for error and adds to their unpredictability. 
---
Got them on the 251st kill in the end &gt;.&gt;
---
77 rc is nothing. And you don’t need to get noted bones. And you don’t need to do DKS. 
---
I got 3 rune scims in 1 task before. Love fire giants 
---
you should train your combat stats on controlled and hit 99 attack strength defense and hp at the same time instead of wasting months for no reason 
---
Are you doing it on a level 3 or a main? Either way Im sure it was terrible 
---
Just like myself in bed
---
would devalue my devalue meme
---
Wouldn't say godsend but it makes it a bit better. 75-77 didn't feel as bad as the other levels but I kinda just pushed through it at once. 
---
Actually, this would be less AFK I think. You'd just spam click the Altar instead of getting a nice jog. But with some altars, the walking is the most AFK part.
---
Allow me to correct myself from earlier. Range void would be better over d'hide if you have it. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RFiL56LMBQ) a video I found that should help you out!
---
Alch urself
---
You should add the weird foods you learn to cook in Tai Bo Wannai Trio to the food tab!

---
Whilst I’m selling kills for bounty hunting, is there a faster way to get back to edgeville?
---
Actually given how the icon generator works, I'd imagine you could have a base object that's just a flat box or something, and texture it with the object sprite on one side while making the rest of it transparent (though idk if the engine supports transparent textures? It should). Then you just have the "camera" on the icon generator look straight down, and it should look identical. Of course there's always the chance that some engine fault stops this from working either.
---
Well deserved. Don’t donate to streamers.
---
Was looking at Vorkath comments and came across this post. I would highly encourage you to just use a ranging potion and a super defence potion over the Bastion pots.
---
Ranging is like 1.8k, super defence is 1k and yet Bastion are 9k.
---
Just a heads up - how's it going with Vorkath? 
---
[fuck you :(](https://i.gyazo.com/224c7da564711d52dd70f3280639a264.png)
---
I believe that if it ain't broke don't fix it. The wilderness ain't broke. So no advice is necessary. Not gonna explain straw man arguments to you...
---
F
---
Gz! Best looking pet for sure!
---
Imagine getting mad about people voting against updates in a game that polls the community on updates LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Why you haven't posted since for some of the other 5 skills?
---
You can pay 5m to have your respawn point set to edgeville.
---
What if your friends and family is the price for 99 
---
Wouldn't really be a 1 at a time account doing 4 at once.
---
Yes it is. What are you talking about?
---
Yes but the method is unlocked way lower. It's boring and monotonous.
---
Runecrafting is the same crap 1-99. You bank, run to an altar, make runes, and tele. Why not give variation?
---
So I can go here on my main, but not on unrestricted??🤔
---
Can believe hunter is that low over say woodcutting
---
Big feet
---
“Need to change the oil and a spark plug on our server”
---
M.A.H
---
You missed the mark with your point by using a terrible example. I profited doing both Crafting and Fletching. I did amethyst for Crafting and longbows for Fletching and both gave me a profit and decent xp/h. You saying what you did just tells me you either don't have either at a decent stat or didn't think it through properly. Likewise these stats can be done extremely quick (13h for Fletching?) if you drop big money on them. The same goes for RC.
---
Also nats are the price they are because they're widely used runes. one person alone making a new pure might buy 120k nats alone for 94 mage and that's just for one person and account. That doesn't include accounts that already use the runes in everyday skills. For example wraths only come from 2 places, offer better xp than nats but come in at a lower gp/h than nats because they're pretty much useless unless you're a normals brid.
---
also do yall think with the firemaking and woodcutting is good for wintertod?
---
Why don’t you try to use the glider without doing the gnome quest? It’s not a requirement for OSF but i think access to the gliders period requires the gnome quest.
---
It seems like a new farming cape gets posted to this sub every day. I guess today is my turn.
---
Uh maybe you should check that lol. It's an average of 110k per konar table drop.
---
In briefing they do, but not in edge pking. 
---
I also do bar mitzvahs please PM me
---
Only thing I like is the “incense.” Seems like a decent idea. 
---
It's literally on the wiki page.  If you're too lazy and can't bother reading the first result on Google then that seems like a personal problem
---
The reasoning I read was that it’s a quest any account should be able to start but only completed with generous account progression 
---
Cos people like you exist
---
Ah, yes, the good old "one side bad other side good" routine. 
---
If you walk into the only area in the entire game where you aren't safe from players and you're mad when a player kills you, that's completely normal, and you have every right to be mad about losing your things. 
---
If you're going to blame the people itching to kill you because they enjoy PvP content for ruining your PvE content when you walk into the only domain they get to be cheeky bastards, sure, I'll give you the card that let you be mad about that too, and justifiably so. 
---
The only problem with your way of thinking is that in order to make your gameplay perfect and hunky dory, you ruin their experience. I don't care how toxic wildly pvp is, if someone wants to have a bit of fun collecting shovels like a brainlet, the PvPers know they'll find victims because the potential victims (cluehunters or otherwise) know the risks and take them both knowingly and willingly. The only way to completely fix this griefing "problem" that has been put forth is to revert back to safe wildy, which I don't like very much. I'm fine with the wilderness just the way it is, and if you aren't, I'd love to hear a way to fix it that makes everyone happy that isn't just "PvP bAd!"
---
Nice
---
If you don’t mind me asking what gear should you get with that 100-200m for raids and high lvl pvm.
---
hes probz chasing pet seen a few 200m without the pet
---
Well prepare to quit this year then. 
---
good bot
---
Lmao
---
Yeah I haven’t bothered to hunt it at all. I keep up with misc and do bird tree runs when I can. I should try some mole stuff 
---
It's Feb. Only 28 days in Feb. 
---
cmonBruh
---
Voldesad needs rent money
---
Some friends and I did MM2 day of release and as you can imagine there was not much information out there yet. It was a lot of fun, but if It'd been just me doing it I think it'd of been terrible. Some find it fun though!
---
Yes i am too confused
---
The way I see it, d hide is an armor and all armor should have some defense requirement, just like most melee and mage armor does. It makes sense lore wise and is consistent across classes.
---
I do sympathize with pures who just want more content, but this pretty much the epitome of “you chose to limit yourself.” We shouldn’t be balancing content around these type of account IMO. 
---
This happens every febuary im pretty sure
---
during olm you need to stand next to your team while burning but move far as possible away when the teleport thing comes. it gives your team a challenge.. we call it "tele-other"
---
You paid for a monthly recurring membership. Feb is 28 days. This is how your rent, electric/water/gas/phone bill etc works
---
Drop it in another quick go back to another world get 99 go back to the world you dropped cape at tele grab it l boom
---
Um... Yeah i would do wilderness  slayer to get my rune pouch if i didnt have to go nearly naked or risk bank to do it.
---
Yes i would love to farm out both wards, even though they are easily outclassed by other items, but i cant because some asshole kid who thinks im holding my cash stack while in monks robes kills me.  
---
And what xp?  Wilderness xp is the same as everywhere else, if anything they should buff xp rates BECAUSE its dangerous.  Honestly pvpers should just kill each other but they dont because they dont want to actually risk anything, they would rather burn 20k in runes, pots, and degrading gear killing me for my FREE monks robes then fight another pvper who likely has a full barrows set or a whip or half a mil in runes on them, because at the end of the day pkers are giant pussies.
---
So, I pay the same amount every month I should get billed for 30 days just like every other website on the whole of the internet, is this some kind of effed up limey metric bullshit?
---
For the meme
---
It would take next to no time to do this for every skill. I seriously hope they think about it.
---
It's actually more gp efficient to do the highest level tree.
---
Got them on clue #33 and clue #37 :D
---
Willows and maples are actually almost 2x as much gp/XP
---
It's way better to do magics it's a lot cheaper
---
found the ironman
---
Just like any other bill in life, February has only 28 days.  Like your membership.  It’s not metric bullshit, use your fucking head. 
---
runelite 2005 interface plugin
---
You need a money maker first. Blue drags are a good first one to keep up your bond money. Once you have that established start working on quest that’s a good start
---
Do you include the time getting back to what you were doing in that time?
---
Idk dude seems normal to me
---
I stand corrected
---
Osrs also has a very prevalent non toxic good side though. Like that's the only reason things like 'selling 13 trouts' works. People love helping each other out in this game. The salty stuff is normally found in places where some sort of competition is present, like mining or slayer tasks and sand crabs etc.
---
If you want to see a game where the player base feels like it has no good side, look at LoL
---
It’s a free lesson to git gud
---
Yeah but what if I became a member halfway thru the month,? By that standard does that mean I should pay full price and only get the remaining 14 days of membership? 
---
I’m sorry 150 kc and 2 shards :(
---
You can’t even use the blowpipe so yeah I would definitely recommend a rune cbow
---
Think about it this way, do you pay for the 31st day of the 6 months that have one?
---
It’s fun at first when you actually have to think for yourself and plan, but once you get all the way through the underground pass and realize you forgot one item, well then it’s not so fun anymore 
---
Regardless of whos at fault, scamers/hackers should never be supported. For now its ice poseidons acc, but whos next? It will never stop unless the security loop holes in jagex system get fixed.
---
I blew air out my nose
---
There would be a Hunter tea, which fills that role (:
---

---
It's a lot harder now with authenticator, but email leaks are a real thing
---
I hate you but gz
---
Dude mithril is blue for sure 
---
Antici-
---
He meant players actually logged in.
---
One time I became a solar eclipse and watched a guy poop in another guys mouth
---
It be like that
---
Low hanging fruit
---
I chuckled
---
Have you tried bringing a clue box?
---
Cya in 3 years!
---
This is a whole different level of mental gymnastics rofl
---
The part they enjoy most is being an asshole to someone else for their own enjoyment. I do not care to preserve that enjoyment.
---
Lol I’ll be done in like 4-5 days 
---
If you’re comfortable, use the blowpipe to dps jad until healers, tag with each with some type of a bow for extra range, then switch back to bp. 
---
Otherwise for a first timer not comfortable with jad/switching just use a crossword or crystal bow for the whole jad fight. 
---
Biggest tip i can give is get comfortable with using f keys to navigate menus. Easily switch between prayer and inventory. Its easy to get flustered your first time but just try to stay calm and hes cake
---
zulrahguide.co.uk helps a bunch 
---
Then yes you have to do the quest 
---
Hello Hello Hello....
---
Farming is one of my lowest stats. Impressive, well done!
---
What is mystic lul
---
It’s cheapest there
---
This is really nice! Awsome work man!
---
Honestly it's not worth my time trying to explain something that you're obviously unwilling to accept. Every time I type one sentence you type 20 so this is a cheap way to waste your time.
---
Dragonstone jewelery (glory, cb brace, skills neck, wealth), ring of life, seed pod from mm2, slayer ring (inc eternal variant) can all be used at 30 wild.
---
Teleports on any spellbook, dueling, games neck, silver jewelery items (burning ammy etc), home tele can be used at 20.
---
Chronicle and minigame teleports cannot be used in the wilderness iirc.
---
Most common ones are glory and grand seed pod from mm2.
---
Obelisks work from any wildy level if you count that as a teleport out of the wilderness.
---
higher range/str levels &gt; +15 magic accuracy that doesn’t add any extra damage, and also doesn’t really matter if you’re primarily fighting other people with low def 
---
Yea I've ran into more then a few people doing this type of account ik I'm not alone lol 
---
Is there a lucky 150k item hiding below the cut?
---
All that's shown is less than 20k, and these averages aren't impressive. Not that low level slayer should be impressive.
---
13 and 20 defense builds are complete shit dude.
---
Yeah like 3 ranarr seeds boyo
---
I've got genie lamps set aside, and since they give 980 xp at lvl 98 and they are all less then 1k I can do it in one location 
---
I'm hitting 85 tonight, only got 30k xp left.  Hope my lucks just as good. My arc light has waited a long time to go poke some denizens of the abyss 
---
No.
---
There’s honestly not much that changed.Just some new content for skilling and such. What would help is just giving the news section a read and also checking the wiki for training guides. Tbh just keep reading everything.
---
You’ll want to use a void setup for melee and range. You’ll want a blowpipe, assembler, your zenytes (anguish, torture, and torment), prims and pegs (if you can afford, if not use dboots and blessed dhide). You’ll want a toxic trident, occult necklace, and ahrims top and bottom. An armadyl crossbow as it’s a big improvement over rune, and a book of law or a twisted buckler once you get comfortable only using 1-2 brews. If you can afford it, a dwh; if not use a bgs. Abyssal tentacle will be your melee weapon until you can afford dh lance. Mages book if you can afford, if not its not a big deal, but make sure to have a god cape 2. Salve amulet (ei) for mystics. 
---
Dragon pickaxe is pretty mandatory; rune will work but its trash in ffas. 
---
As you improve, work on getting ancestral hat, full ancestral, sang staff (sell ancestral hat once you have full ancestral and sang, as it doesnt add max hit), dragon hunter crossbow in place of acb and bp on olm. 
---
Eventually you’ll want to use arma/bandos over void, but the difference honestly is not that big. 
---
I prefer ffas, especially if you find a competent clan. 
---
That's what, less than an hour? Smokin'!
---
Improper grammar kills it.
---
Anyone who falls for this deserves to get phished haha.
---
o-: but in reverse
---
I think we need to steer away from skill boosts. Maybe add some functionality. Let's see, if I was to plagerise Pokemon:
---
Incense was a nice concept. How about Max Repel remake? Adjusts monster aggro for 100 levels or something? Might be of use for low levels. Likewise you can make onme for reverse affect? Helps higher levels train at low Slayer monsters to gain aggro?
---
Certain incense to increase yield of items. Maybe Tuna + Weed to attract more Swordfish over Tuna when spearing?
---
Gz. First drop?  Now get that serp to make things infinitely easier. 
---
Also dont ever forget, bp spec is useless
---
I’m assuming there’s no split in ffa correct?
---
If you can’t figure out how to get a cracked file of photoshop use gimp. Great software for beginners. The wiki is a great source for high res photos.
---
That's what you get for buying defective saplings.
---
Next time buy them over the counter, you cheapskate.
---
It's a VERY dated engine, which is why it gives so much trouble. Hopefully we'll get a total overhaul someday.
---
Is this satire? Coming from the dumbfuck who thinks your account can be hijacked without recovery appeals, and changing your password without password recovery requests 😂😂😂😂 "I'm a software programmer!!" lmao literally some idiot who just started playing RS this year. 
---
skillnchill cc shoutout! Hot progress man
---
I remember world switching in Varrock buying runes in RSC. I forget but something about a vender in the wild had the stronger runes. Anyways the skill is brutal, it wouldn’t hurt my feelings if it disappeared.
---
I have an internship this making 35/hr, full time with housing and transportation paid for; and I’m only a junior :D. 
---
How are you able to get 1.1m xp/hr?
---
Imagine dying doing Wildy slayer lmaoo get good at the game 
---
Gottem
---
Go browse by new and read comments
---
Blast furnace Str? That would be the simplest route imo. I’m sure there is something more efficient I’m not considering but something like:
---
Blast furnace STR to 99
---
Train Str at Pc  or something up to 99 HP 
---
Then easily do attack, ranged and defense one at a time. 
---
Lastly slayer any way desired. 
---
Use the wiki 
---

---
Number of people who used Murgee's Autoclicker for like 250 hours
---
Yeah, you might get unlucky for a while but it pays off in the long run. My longest dry streak in 600 raids was 130. 
---
suck ur toes
---
but defence with a c is the canadian _and_ UK spelling (where the game was made)
---
sure you dont own an american version of excel lol
---
You seem like you don't appreciate the osrs grind.
---
600-700k ish most likely. On average you're going to get between 2-3 drops an hour with the average drop being 110k. So a bonus of about 250k an hour with only minor decreases in xp rates. Amazing for iron men and great for mid level mains.
---
No it's not lmao. If it was 1/25m, that would mean the tanz fang is 1/5000. It's a 1/262144 drop.
---
If your suggestion for incense is implemented, I'd be willing to be it'd be referred to as an amazon echo
---
Currently 900 kills dry for Limbs.. two of my other clanies are also 800+dry when they’re 1/800 
---
Make an ironman 
---
Yea I was wondering that too. Best I've ever got with mahogany tables is 850k exp/hr, and that was super intensive. I maybe could've gotten a bit more, but +250k? I doubt.
---
With what money for bond lol
---
Mitch
---
Konar is nice for a bit of extra money (sort of) but can be slower all together. Nieve is good for when your combat is a bit lower as she gives more quick tasks. If you eventually level up and do more boss tasks (cerberus, thermo, sire, etc.) Then duradel is better.
---
gz buddy
---
If you plan on making multiple accounts  then definitely do it without a guide. If you can manage to do it yourself once, you will remember how to do it in the future
---
Should have killed one less! Nice loot though!
---
No unless you get some amazing BGS specs or get a DHCB
---
One of the top comment suggests it’s exp and that time varies per skill
---
Dusty old man! Full of green dust!
---
Do duradel asap
---
Dragon sword?
---
It's 2019 guys, phone pictures should be illegal.
---
Learn how to screenshot haha
---
I love mach1n3girl
---
4th and 5th i think I burned with a blowtorch, and then I just kept eatin'. 
---
Sooo ima tank then? Lol ohhhh jeez get ready for a lot of deaths lol
---
I can buy you a year membership if you want?
---

I hate animation smoothing and prefer the choppy animations. It's part of the games charm imo.

Myybe because it's an iron. It shouldnt take.a main 2 hours to go from 9-30 rc. don't train the skill if you don't like it.

Is what I would like somebody to say to me if i where in ur situation :/
---
Lol
---
DPS calc puts the mace ahead but I'm just not sure if it's counting the wilderness stuff because it's ahead by a lot.
---
Idk man, you don't have to be the greatest pvmer to teach people how to pvm. Chym isn't woox or anything but he shows that raids aren't impossible and teaches newbies how to do it, don't know why you feel the need to flame.

First lesson in gambling.

Don’t bet what you can’t afford to lose.

viggoras chainmace does more dps than scythe 
---
Damn son. With levels like yours I’m shocked it took so long to 99 something.
---
If you want to know for sure, compare it with dscim instead since the mace is the same thing stat wise.
---
Also just for clarification I'm talking about the dsword, not dlongsword
---
Who sees ads in 2019 wtf
---
Fuck off with your shitty cell phone pic of your computer screen. You are honestly retarded.
---
I do but after 6 hours at airel fishing getting 15 pearls on a 1/75 drop rate and doing barb fishing getting 40k experience an hour it doesn't match any other skills in the game tbh 
---
Hahah 
---
Scythe isn't a training weapon.. lul
---
Wow nice I'll get on that. I've finished all but 2 of the f2p quests in one night I think I'm ready :)
---
Only in the wilderness though right?
---
I feel like if an item is so core to the gameplay, specifically PvM for this example, it makes the game less interesting than if you had many options to choose from. Maybe if they kept the blowpipe as is but buffed other similarly leveled ranged weapons in terms of PVM strength, that would fix the low diversity of options.
---
 However I believe that ranged already overpowers magic so much that such a move would further cement magic as a purely utility skill rather than DPS. That's why I think a nerf to the toxic blowpipe (that didn't make it useless but instead an option among others depending on preference) would actually make the game more interesting to play.
---
Lmao his username said a thing
---
With a tbow and prostate massage sure
---
Lmao autumn elegy was vilified because he advocated against QoL changes that made Skilling much more entertaining solely because it "devalued the achievements of those who did it without these QoL changes" WHEN HE USED AHK THE WHOLE TIME.
---
Confirmed, I got it.
---
Is attack bad?
---
I can't imagine doing 8k demonics. Absolute aids for mediocre gp/hr
---
ive had 5 in 3 days lol. i just staerted fighting these but theyre now my new favorite monster
---
that’s more up to interpretation i feel, but on top of the armor they also get vengeance which can be pretty big 
---
personally playing on a pure i felt like zerks were free money, other people say they get demolished by them. 
---
The other guy is better and is working on strength already so this guy is far af behind and the other cats account isn’t “ruined” anymore as he is now working toward 99 str with everything else truly at 1 or 99 unlike this pleb with 10 hp.. nice try tho 
---
I was thinking the same thing. Seems like an afternoon of work actually.
---
it does tho

&gt;listening to asmr

#MAYBE JAGEX WILL REVERT IT BACK TO LEVEL 1 LIKE THEY DO TO ALL THE STREAMERS.
---
What a ridiculous excuse.  Yeah, things do require engine work; work on your fucking engine instead of adding more content to your broken ass engine.
---
Just checked, it would only track if I took it off and picked it up off the ground.
---
It doesn't, or at least it didn't use to. 
---
Shout-out to this cc. I've been guided from f2p to members through them and it's been a great spot to hangout with. Friendly people and helpful services.
---
I would've thought it would be range, strength, hp, cooking, mage, attack, defense
---
There are a ton of pures so I thought attack and defense would be lower
---
lmao all I saw was you miss your range flicks player.
---
Buy you for 10k
---
I'm sure you can joke around with the chat and see if it works out :P
---
Personally I think the quests the best part about RuneScape and that it’s a waste to go through a guide. It’s the journey not the destination!
---
D
---
thats actually not a bad idea didnt realize you could sell bonds in game for money. though you could only buy them in game with gold. getting an ez 3 mil for 6 dollars isn't bad and would def help me regain most if not all of what i lost.
---
there's an option to not show ignored items. you probably have that on.
---
Dont talk like you're right when you know nothing about pvp
---
How afk are these?
---
hey so maybe since its their fault they will help me out?
---
probs not so im just going to do as someone else suggested buy a bond and then sell it. Sucks that I need to spend more money now but w/e
---
You only need 91 since you can boost 8 levels to make everything.  Con is easy though it's just expensive as balls.  
---
Well ill tell you now thats my account and it is true. Im currently 159 kc, nothing but trios/3+1/3+2 my entire kc, not a single split. believe what you want ya monkey
---
No runecrafting is 
---
Just get 75 att and 42 defense. Now the account is even better
---
Engine work is just a go-to excuse for "we don't feel like it".  What are they supposed to do, only update their game with simple things that require no engine work? 
---
Ridiculous.
---
Clean!
---
or void
---
But why would anyone do this to themselves
---
because he got 2 defense
---
I'm fine if overload tincture is scrapped, but figured I would add it since it would be such a nerfed version. You're one of the few to comment on that regard!
---
Thats not a bad idea about the incense either. If it stacking with other boosts is too powerful, namely slayer helm, that could be a great way to reel it back in. Depends on how powerful it is and the cost of upkeep.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
How long did this take you too make?
---
Now it all makes sense..
---
yeah 
---
Bruh I feel that. Been playing for years and my highest is 72. And that's only like 1/4 of the way to 99 at best!!! How tf do all these people have maxed accounts!?!?!
---
nah
---
I don't want to have giant list of ingredients added to the game. There's already enough random items in the game, why do we need this.
---
So basically what you’re telling me is that Agility and Runecrafting suck 
---
Does 11 yrs describe your time playing or your age because you post could be either. 
---
Barrows to 99 hp!
---
how is this not already done? this seems like such a basic fix for any game that is making money 
---
72 is a million xp..  
---
people get that in a day lol 
---
Scythe in mm2 caves offers the best melee training xp in the game. 
---
Yes I feel like it's got something to do with either the boss or the seed pods, that's just what I always thought. 
---
I had 97 fm in Maples from
---
Kingdom and I got hacked right before wintertodt game out so my goal of 99fm from kingdom was double crushed 
---
Purple.
---
Yea, either by manually clicking or using goblin staff for autocasting (since it gives you 0 magic attack). Means you gotta use full runes though.
---
I am really surprised this suggestion didn't gain traction. It's easy to view on mobile reddit this time. and I did a better job with the photoshop. IDK i guess it's just not a meme
---
When I commented this on the post where 991atatime got 2 strength I got downvoted to oblivion. Glad to see people have changed their minds

did mommy give you her credit card so you could have BiS?

I just wana know where all the money gets funnelled. Like god damn ive lost my bank to many times.
---
It is ruined though, it was 99 1 at a time and now it isnt 1 at a time because he got 2 str during another skill, defeated the object of the entire task.
---
Be like sayinf 99 1 at a time but got to 2277 doing them all together, but it counts because theyre all 99 now!  
---
THis is well over 200m with the current prices.
---
“The other guy is better” how? I’m not saying he’s not, I think they’re both on equal footing since they’re doing the same thing, don’t you? The difference is 991atatime got 2 strength, something the community won’t forget which creates the dent in his account which won’t get fixed even if it’s his current 99. There’s no reason to be a dick to either of the players bro, cmon now.
---
you LITERALLY just spelled out the problem, the pvpers dont KNOW i have wealth and chose to kill me for a CHANCE at an item that i MIGHT have.  Farming bosses is systematic becuase eventually you WILL get the drop, killing some random player becuase he has a Dscim and hoping he somehow skulls and drops it, or was stupid enough to bring his cash stack, thats like 1/10k.  PVPERS SHOULD KILL OTHER PVPERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHIT, leave PVMers alone, if you kill a PVMer in the wilderness you are basically trolling for no reason.

He literally never stated that he hated casual players. When people would ask his opinion on casual players in stream he would say he doesnt care and to play how you want to play. He didnt want the game to become too easy and casual, yes, but he was never negative towards laypeople.

This is mostly a relic from RS Classic. Back then you could 'fail' spells and be locked out from casting for some time (about 20 seconds). Additionally there was no auto-casting as far as I recall, and gear switching mid-combat wasn't really a thing.
---
So in that context it makes more sense that you might want to (or need to) occasionally staff-bash your opponent.
---
Now with auto-casting and no possibility to fail spell casting, the melee stats don't make as much sense, but they remained in place for whatever reason. People do use Staff of the Dead as a legit melee weapon, it's actually quite strong.
---
I literally just got it too and haven’t had a chance to use it yet.

I think it’s time to log off

because it will take them a month to make this and another week to fix whatever they broke when they released it.

ely is too OP for pvp. cant even die 1v20, now imagine if its a legit 1v1. shouldnt be able to buy yourself out of being killable when there isn't an ely equivalent  f a dps boost

Honestly, I was waiting for when the first one came rolling in. I was shocked when I hit 85 with no comments.

I’m surprised smithing and con are so los

75 attack and piety

85 is 1/4th to 99, not 72 lol

Being smited while skulled rev pvming. Ive done over 5k kills without loosing one. But i know how to not get smited.
---
your point?
---
i really dislike this suggestion because it doesnt look good to me
---
If you haven't got it yet Id recommend bringing as few switches as possible, void would be ideal for this. Choosing one single rotation to learn,memorizing the shit out of it and logging out if you don't get it and trying again.  I recommend starting with range first phase since the start of the fight is relatively calm compared to others.

Nice to see Abyss still doing laps between edgeville and black chins with all his friends.
---
imagine comparing sitting still with actual sporting
---
Even if some people wanted they couldnt instsntly run a marathon without training for it
---
With runescape all you need to get 99 is have free time and nothing better to do, no training required
---
Well, that's one way to advertise in someone else's post. We don't force anyone to use our chat. The reason for the recommended tip for deliveries is because our users use it for some bonus gp on top of killing ogres for bond money or otherwise, and people pay with ogre loot as well.

Thanks for your post anyway.

You: &gt;"stop saying I’m wrong based on your anecdotal evidence"
---
There's no data on this so thats the only way to present a argument, as you've just admitted to as bellow. 
---
You again: take my anecdotal evidence as well as pker's anecdotal evidence that it happens.
---
Obviously no ones going to tell stories about all the times they pked some one for nothing. Its equivalent to me saying that lizard man shamans drop DWH super often because i see clips of it happening and if you dont believe me just ask all the people who got drops. But unlike PvM there's no drop rate to see if you get lucky in the case of someone being forgetful.
---
We can just agree to disagree as we're not arguing anything that can be proven and disagreeing on opinion/anecdotes. It can go on forever just saying the same things in different ways.
---
Vorkath if you have a  maxed poh with pool, lunar isle portal/fremmy elite done and bgs/dwh + blowpipe or just dhcb along with void+salve(ei) amulet. Otherwise do zulrah.

Yeah, that I know of.

How do rangers feel when a dragon arrow breaks and they hit a 0?  Do rangers get free xp for not doing damage?  what about barrows, specifically melee users, who hit a 0 and low a charge of their gear?

Good guide. But I feel like you've missed out on some important things like mentioning to turn run off. Besides that good guide :)

You can get 99 pray for 116m...

Members content, members pick. Simple. The f2p od restricted. People spend real hours of their lives working to give you the opportunity to rely a game, and if you like said game, you are encouraged to pay for it. Because it gives you much more access and much more variety. F2p gives you the basic understanding. What's with the f2p wanting more content. Some of the shit, ok, but some.. really? You have to even ask?
---
I voted no, because changing your protect to magic is one of the few elements of skill that can keep you alive when being PKed.
---
I'd rather they just flat increase the base duration of standard spell binds and keep the magic protect.

One week to several years.

Nice.

He would get Hitpoints xp

There are literally dozens of posts about group ironman. We all agree it is stupid, and you are stupid for suggesting it. If you don't want to use the ge, then don't use the ge. Problem solved.
---
I wouldn't bother with void unless it's elite and you DONT have tormented bracelet.
---
If you've got tormented then elite void is less DPS magic wise.
---
For range it would be a nice switch in the above situation. God dhide is fine otherwise
---
Personally I didn't but thanks for asking.
---
I didn't see many, sorry.
---
Mind informing me why this is stupid? If there are dozens of posts about it, then obviously its an opinion that others are casting.
---
I appreciate your honesty 
---
Let's keep making rs objectively easier while hypocritically screaming ezscape at things that DON'T actually make things easier

---
If you need a better way to get to a fairy ring the [Salve graveyard teleport](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Salve_Graveyard_Teleport) on the arceuus spellbook is really close to one and has low requirements to use and is fairly cheap, 40 magic, 60% favour and costs around 550gp to cast. You can also go with the (teletab version)[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Salve_graveyard_teleport] but that one is much more expensive and will cut your profit by a fair bit.
---
Are you getting a harpoon every hour? Or am I just taking too long to kill wyrms (which is every 5 tasks basically)? Maybe 400k/hr or something, it gets hard to actually know while mobile only and using a blowpipe which nearly negates profits.
---
How u get 6 jad ???
---
Lmao pathetic.
---
We pay we play
---
Thanks brother. Yep that makes sense. The partner slayer system is not exclusively rewarding but also has wonky mechanics in that it is easy to lose or misaissgn tasks upon get-go. I guess it is engine work.
---
Maybe they need to include a new unique drop like a scroll that is given on solo tasks to allow a partner to join the scroll readers' task! That would be EPIC!

absolute state of /r/2007scape, downvoted for askin a question.
---
however i found [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUQ5wFpXIAAEvOf.png) which shows that bronze dragons determine loot on death. this still doesn't mean that vorkath's loot is determined on death as he is quite different from a normal npc (makes it very likely, though).
---
Yeah I literally just noticed that you can set up multiple quick prayers at once. I don't really see the difference in EXP gain but maybe I'm just unlucky.

Thanks for the answer though!

Devalues my skill guide, no wiki Ironman
---
Idk.. but i laughed out loud
---
i see, yeah got everything except my fm level isnt that high, so that could probably be it
---
If it's your first time doing fight caves karil cbow until jad is your best bet since you aren't experienced in safespotting. Using BP makes things faster but the range can also screw your run up.  
---
  
---
For jad you can swap to a rcbow with dia bolts or stick with karils. South italy rock safespot is the easier for tagging healers and not worrying too much about their damage since they'll usually be lined up instead of attacking you at once. 
---
Bludgeon is hardly as required now as maul was pre-nerf. Maul is still bis for solos yeah, but once again, Lance is still "viable". If flinching didn't exist I probably wouldn't bother bring it for solos to be honest. But that's just because I still need as many brews as possible for noprep.
---
Even then you have double exp right?
---
At lower levels (i assume as you're F2P you are low-levelled) the xp increase will be small as your normal damage is also small. At 99 strength however, a prayer like piety can increase a max hit of 36 to 44, which increases xp rates phenomenally.

above and beyond suggestion: wieldable glassblowing pipe and 13  buckets of sand
---
Damn.. i'll go crazy if that happens 
---
since skeletal visage and draconic visage are 1/5k at vorkath, and vorkath has two loot rolls. would that mean the effective drop rate of either would be 1/2.5k? or is that already accounted for on the wiki page?

"Shirt" and "Shorts", both in brown. They're dwarfen clothes, that's why they are small. You can also buy them in Keldarim. Don't know about the hat.

Burned pages and Tome of Fire make it worthwhile. and at least interactive compared to line firemaking

Typically your target shows up and asks if you selling if he notices you in a safe spot or rags. Then you make an agreement on the amount of gold, followed by the assassination and a meeting at Edgeville’s bank to make the payment.
---
Pros: quick and easy money.
---
Cons: not going to make you rich, nor is it going to give you any experience in a skill. Also, you could be scammed and not be given anything for your services.

People love romanticizing when you could buy lobsters in Catherby and then sell them in Varrock for like 20 gold extra per, but they forget how terrible it was to spam for three hours to get something that wasn't a often traded commodity 
---
Haha not at all. But thanks for your input :)
---
I known that, but you’re at a loss. 95k for a skill which you profit on is huge.
---
I would say yes. I see these kinds of requirements as an opportunity to level up my skills and as others mentioned you will need the outfit for falador diary later anyways.  
---
It's a way of life man
---
Someone replied with the reason idk how that missed the mark
---
Yes please. I am just starting raids and this would be amazing. some tips for the Olm as well would be awesome.
---
I think they mentioned something about this not being possible, due to an engine limitation of only being able to show items in these menus, not any icon of their liking.
---
The prayer and magic has been brought up many times before, and I would love if the engine team could update this.

Now that I reached 100 combat I'm ready to use Duradel for slayer. What's the preferred method to reach him, though, since he is significantly more out of the way than e.g. Nieve.

The storage unit flat packs don't require a construction level to use in your house

I prefer it the other way and I would probably quit the game and start killing people if it were to change

For ironman yes. However this is a post about being surprised about a skill.
---
I am surprised to see thieving so low since it is literally the same gp/hr and a little bit more exp/hr while being more afk then firemaking.

Uh, in case you're confused, these threads are automatically posted every day by the automoderator and the questions are meant to be answered by other players.

It's a sell offer.

Obviously these people get a sense of accomplishment for getting high level hard cores or they wouldn’t play it. Most of these people have maxed mains and wanted to try something knew. Having a hardcore just gives them a new perspective on the game and allows them to enjoy the entire game over again. If you

Chill burning magic logs is still better than wintertodt.

But look at it this way, you give players an option, One: Do one boring thing for ton of hours for a cape OR Two: Do one less boring thing for ton of hours for loot and chance of pet, and eventually a cape.

To put this in prospective using the binomial probability distribution equation going ~15k dry is ~4.9% chance.

I see many have not studies statistics.
---
The ground floor ones are based on ores taken from rock, the upper floor is a timer.

Ground floor, along with things like wood cutting+fishing, is essentially a dice roll every time you mine an ore and if it hits a magic number the ore depletes.

It isn't relevant. If you flip a coin and get 20 heads and you're no more likely to get tails. Killing 13k lizards with no hammer is the same as killing 1 with no hammer. The odds are the same every time. 
---
Yeah, you can wild pie for Hydra from 90 slayer though but you probably already knew that. By the way it's only the normal Hydra you need to kill for the diary not the boss (Alchemical Hydra).

its definitely not lol

And also the rewards from the boss.

Reminds me of the time I tried to buy like 20,000 water runes for 5gp each and ended up buying 5 earth runes for 20,000gp each. I didn't pay the full price somehow but still.

Better yet, deposit all/empty button when the bank is open.
---
what the fuck is wrong with you? lmao
---
No, it’s not. You end up with 65.6 after all 6 brothers, which is what Mod Kieran’s tweet says you should have after all 6 brothers. 
---
Im more into hot cocoa and energy drinks
---
This could be bullshit but someone said the drop rate is like 5x normal servers.
---
Just pick them all up and try again.
---
Good old zchat shout out  (: 
---
YEEET
---
Skillcapes are the least fashionable fashionscape if you wear H.A.M
---
Literally watching them before I started wasting time on Reddit. You've reminded me to go back and finish them.
---
im gonna be real I forgot a comma  didn't mean to refer to redditors as tryhards
---
no.
---
I don't think he or the vast majority care that much.
---
Another legend who 99'd farming first! Welcome to the untrimmed farming guild.
---
Congratulations brother
---
Wintertodt was a shit update, it turned a skill that both made the world alive and used resources into a contained skill that is only trained in one world in one place that also gives random loot to give players dopamine kicks to distract them from the fact that the only reasonable course of action to train is to do the same minigame over and over. 
---
I'm not saying firemaking was perfect but there are other methods that could be introduced.
---
lol. i wonder if there will be again somebody opening their umbral chests in tutorial island and they receive then 200m while they are at there.
---
Probably because no one bothers look at the in game guides so there was no real point in updating them. Especially for prayer, that's the most pointless guide out. 
---
Its literally being polled under QoL rn, idk if its passing, but its being polled as QoL, when it is a direct change to one of the most farmed bosses in the game.
---
What about using those potion mixes made via Otto's barbarian training that no one uses instead of just using the herb for the tinctures?
---
Slayer should be strictly along the Mississippi river only. 
---
"Rigondeaux" it's a streamers clan and it's always social/chill
---
But making potions is just part of the lore
---
UGG HATE READING TOO, BUT UGG HATE STUPID VOICE MAN MORE.
---
But that’s worth nothing....
---
Remember that the construction cape is so useful
---
Even some non buyable are capable of doing that
---
Oddly enough, Fishing was the favorite because in my childhood it was always my closet one to 99 back in 2006. So it felt satisfying doing that skill. 
---
Fastest? Had to be either prayer, or cooking for me
---
That looks hella good for new people...
---
He was just afking them while playing on another account 
---
A QoL update may be considered a buff, but it should be the effect of streamlining something. Changing something for the sake of buffing it is a buff and not QoL.
---
lmao wow
---
I know you can’t reply, but this is a neat idea. 
---
I got a third age piece that finished in the duel arena
---
Ugh, use a D Scim?
---
Oh now I remember why I never sort by new. 
---
If you have money, go for Primordial boots
---
You do not need to do it in F2P.
---
I think it's perfect u could add a blessing for the bonus prayer i guess...
---
Happy cake day, brother 
---
 sub 2 pewdiepie  
---
its not too bad once you get the timings right, also after the first jad is dead it gets a lot easier
---
Oh and use a none poisonous dagger that would make it that u get more hit that equals more exp
---
E N Z A   D E N I N O
---
Yeahhh...
---
Drop the looting bag and pick it back up?
---
Cheers fella
---
I've moved countries several times, would I never be allowed to recover my account then? Lmfao
---
Cool story bro.
---
Nope, that's actually how I teleported there.
---
Also, why tf do you need favor if you have the farming cape? Why doesn't it work like every other guild? 
---
QoL would be never requiring a outfit in the first place /s
---
Exactly! I can't stand it when people measure length to 99 in xp instead of time spent. 
---
A piety pure is an account with 60 attack/70 or 75 defence/77 prayer, and 99 all other combats, sits at around 100cb which isn't much higher than a maxed 75 attack zerker.
---
I guess I should have worded it better. Anyone who wants to max without taking over 5k hours to do it cares. 
---
NO ONE show this to wild_mudkip on twitch.tv or just mudkip on youtube. NO ONE SHOW THIS TO HIM (he went 2,250 dry for a tanz fang)
---
They have no personality so they cringe at everything to feel less insecure about it
---
Brilliant idea, lets move all items to Slayer. 
---
Buy 6b more yo
---
Maybe I spoke out of place
---
Sorry, but this is a really stupid argument.
---
You can get 300 raw sharks as a drop  from barbarian assault hard gambles, but nobody gives a damn. The reason isn't because we can all do barbarian assault hard gambles, it's because the overall rates and other content drops make it not overpowered.
---
Zulrah was being farmed constantly, brought in insane wealth and kinda made fishing sharks obsolete. Konar is an awful source of sharks and is balanced around lower exp rates.
---
NOBODY WILL USE GOD D’ HIDE CHAPS IN DEEP WILD.
---
Why?
---
It has the EXACT SAME STATS AS REGULAR BLACK D HIDE. With a +1 to prayer and nobody wants to risk 400k to 1,5m for 1+ prayer bonus.
---
Not even kidding, you are seriously braindead with the way you think.
---
It is.
---
They literally have no life outside of runescape
---
Found this from unknown sources but it believe it could help you understand. 
---
"Though it is difficult to articulate, the feeling of cringing can be traced back to the feeling of empathy. Essentially, cringing is vicarious embarrassment."
---
I would say it’s easyscape, not QoL
---
Yep it is.
---
Quests are always good, or slayer for combat experience. You should always try and train combat skills through slayer to save you time in the long run. 
---
Magic has plenty of fireball attacks and there are already hot air balloons in game lol
---
Ty, is torso hard to get ?
---
Atleast he tried, smh. So rude.
---
Yeah, was poking fun at the continuously blurring line between the two on Reddit lol. 
---
Wrong
---
Yep.
---
Yeah lol, the line is really blurry sometimes
---
This is complete bogus.
---
Account=gone ggwp
---
Elaborate
---
I'm sorry, i'll elaborate. You are wrong.
---
He is also selling ranks in his CC. Once the account gets locked again the CC stays up and those who bought rank get to keep them I believe
---
If you did wildy slayer, you would at least have 400/800k loot I reckon.
---
k
---
why would Jagex use the U.S justice system?
---
Nobody wants a shit statted player to their clan, get max combat and try again
---
If you think this is cringy, you probably need to get out more
---
Lmao, wines are 500k/hr tops whiles darts are 1.4m / hr ~ . And if u really want to talk what is faster, 1 tick karamwans is and thats around 1m/hr, so no, wines are not faster
---
Don't even know what it is tho so don't matter if he is or not 
---
Yea, back when it was 5$ there was no RS3, that's the joke. I was implying i don't give a shit about RS3 and would love the option to just pay for OSRS
---
Um. Yes it has been but ok.
---
Imagine getting 99 mining with no combat
---
Rune pouch with laws and dust runes here
---
You're braindead.
---
Oh, I thought I read on the wiki that it rolled 27 loots at 13500. This makes more sense, but I'd definitely still like it to allow me to open it and have items drop to the ground after a warning message. 
---
all well guess I have to suicide lol
---
who eats pizza without cheese?
---
Agility is by far the worst of them all in my opinion. For a skill I can get 60k/h in i'm going slower than both RC and Mining.
---
Thankyou
---
Get 60 attack for claws. Quest it though...
---
Taverley walk of shame

Good bot
---
Ironically slayer is the slowest of them all
---
Apparently it wont destroy my crate, so that's always a possibility. It's just a hassle I wish I didn't have to do. 
---
You shouldn’t be ashamed of your hobbies, bro
---
Dodging lightning and teleports can result in missing a few ticks, so why wouldn't everyone learn it
---
Subtle flex
---
That shit slaps lmaoo
---
Phishing
---
After like 66 raids, I watched your video on scouting raids and how people are complaining it's leaving just because of things like vespula, and I was inspired to finally learn her and thanks to you I no longer have to scout non vesp raids 
---
PLEASE DO THIS.
---
I somehow always click for 3 airs, and 60% of the time end up with 2.
---
Yeah, agility sucks. It's my second lowest at 79 below hunter.
---
What am I missing here? Can’t you just bank the looting bag?
---
Nico Op Zijn Wagen
---
Slayer is the most popular by far and all you do is run from the slayer master to the bank, from the bank to x location for task. You then sit there afk for 40+ minutes. With that said I've gotten 99 in all the terrible skills and my Contruction is still 72.
---
With u/Faladorable who knows
---
Killing Moss Giants turns them into a fully grown magic tree patch
---
Issue is they replaced raw shark with manta ray. which meant all the other 22hp healing foods went down in price anglerfish / dark crabs etc, also vorkath drops a bunch of manta rays/revs so the 20hp foods like shark go down in price. 
---
good job jagex :) 
---
De-iron
---
Except if they were to release high output fishing, woodcutting, mining, content with only ironmen in mind. It would completely destroy the economy in no time. 
---
The reason skilling is complete dogshit profit wise, is because everyone can do it. At least with bosses, it weeds out the people who are too “vacant” upstairs to do them. 
---
Fish lvls?
---
Undeserved
---
They don’t 
---
Theres been multiple price raises, you know? And neither of them.made you able to acess both games. You got p2p for both games since osrs day 1.
---
11$ has nothing at ALL to do with getting p2p for both games, like you claimed. 
---
Sell bcp, get fighter torso
---
Sell fury get torture
---
is this in Estonia?
---
Sharks crashed because people were dumping their accumulated shark drops, because sharks were removed from Zulrah's drop table.
---
There was a large volume of sharks suddenly taken out of banks and dumped because they would no longer be dropping.
---
I'd try entering some random details and if a bank pin window pops up its fake
---
Mines usually sitting in there full of dusts, chaos and laws. If I ever emptied it out and filled it for tps, I'd likely forget and Vork would exploderize me.
---
Are you f2p? 
---
Yes, Tallinn
---
I carry a mystic mist battlestaff, and use laws, lavas, and then deaths/bloods/wraths depending on what kind of attack spell I want to be able to cast
---
You're a terrible person. 
---
As if Jamflex would ever clean up their game LMAO
---
Could go 70 def 74 pray for rigour and stay ranged only idk
---
It's fake. Everything is through the message centre
---
It’s a phishing attempt, Jagex won’t threaten to sue you lmfao.
---
That blurry shit is annoying to look at, makes it feel like I’m not wearing glasses or im blind. Especially with text on it wtf
---
Could you print dragon platelegs? 
---
I would love to see something like that 3D printed! 
---
It's like scratching a scratchcard for lottery; no expectations, but hey there's always a chance for jackpot.
---
Why not run laws, lava and airs then?
---
Real men use tabs 
---
Let it serve as a noob's first foray into skipping undesirable tasks. 
---
It's unfortunate construction costs so damn much
---
Who were?
---
ya 20-50 would suffice
---
That's a real power move right there
---
I actually play mostly different style pure accounts for pking and I don’t want a change from the traditional options for pure gear. 
---
Not really man 60 attack zerks are in that bracket, who risk 400+ or double that if they anchor and fighting pures for gmaul loot blows for them
---
The funny thing is Zulrah really didn't affect shark prices at all. Meanwhile minnows made them crash down to 400 at one point. 
---
I did Lumby first, and it's pretty nice to have. The ring gives you high alchs to use when barraging and removing the need for a Dragon/Lunar staff is useful for just about anything
---
Fair reason, I guess. Thanks for your honesty!
---
Jagex didn't remove the shark drop from zulrah because people complained, but because you shouldn't have been able to profit food from a boss. If you remember the incident, people complained that it was removed. You do not profit food from slayer because of the rarity of hitting the drop table x getting sharks from it. Sick Nerd with the retarded take yet again, why do people listen to this clown? Lmao
---
0 skill in that 
---
Problem solved if you get your construction up and just use house teleports
---
Mist is air and water... The reason people do lavas is because of the dueling ruing Tele right by the fire altar..
---
So condescending and so ignorant
---
The reason that dusts are cheap is dust devils. And the reason lavas are cheap is because everyone does them cus they are the best xp.
---
Too poor for portals m8
---
I feel like you're trying to uncover some form of conspiracy but I can't figure out what it is
---
No it doesn't? QoL changes are changes that need to be made to extend the life of the game....... (Literally stands for QUALITY OF LIFE)
---
Which isn't that many people honestly. 
---
Awesome thanks for the input. Do you mean that you'd feel pressured to use the blessed chaps? Or that you like the established meta at the moment and like I guess the look of pures atm?
---
It requires a slayer cape and max gear
---
Yoyos are still a fun way to waste time. Titanium ones spark when you walk the dog on concrete, looks nice.. for cutting up a $200 toy.
---
First one I did was lumby because not needing a dramen staff seemed like a great perk and also the rc requirement is one of the lowest.
---
Bandos has unique drops because its a boss.
---
Last time i checked abberent spectres weren't a boss so why the hell they get uniques?
---
Don't listen to the other comments. Void is trash compared to dhide at your current ranged level. Google bitterkoekje dps calc and compare set ups more in detail yourself instead of relying on reddit. 
---
Reminds me of the South Park WoW episode. 
---
This
---
Removing defense requirement is a QOL change now? Holy shit lol. 
---
Sound electrifying. Nah I love yo-yo’s, used to have loads as a kid 
---
Update please 
---
nah you missed the mark. interacting with members objects is for members only, it's the basis of the F2P system.  
---
if you don't have membership, and you don't have a bond...buy a membership. It isn't fucking criminal for Jag to want you to spend money on their game, that's the whole reason they have the game, it's a business. you want to talk about a marketing strategy but here's a bit of free business advice: don't give away your product for free if it has value!  
---
I know, fucking mindblowing.
---
Yeah, I’ll have to...just wanna hear back from the community
---
This took some balls to do
---
Dust runes cheaper than airs
---
I wouldn't worry about getting an Arclight. I switched to a whip after using the Arclight for a while and didn't really notice a significant drop in DPS. 
---
Still took 750 kills to get a single shard though. 
---
Rookie numbers
---
f2p problems
---
nope. atleast i hope im not a bot
---
I have to admit, all the ideas people are coming up with for Runecrafting are getting creative. 
---
It's not changing any time soon though. 
---
Got my first RC pet last night BTW. 
---
Hes right, you did it on 4 accounts not 3, checkmate
---
Pick and shovel, maybe. Flute salad? Strong contender. But barbarianism? No way 
---
Or you can use the max cape/fletching cape perks to get a mith grapple
---
Lmfao
---
He said “unless you are below 90 range” which means if you’re over 90. Void range is BiS against monsters with low def if you have a high range level
---
Just started my first account in years and decided to do a HCIM. I'm struggling to get a cash stack bigger than 3k, any tips on how to make some money so I can finally start training mage? Walking around all the time is getting tedious
---
How would it benefit non PvPers lol?
---
Not if you're me and insta buy 5k mists for 1k each at 4am
---
Those jads look way better than fight cave jad imo.
---
I second this. It would be fun to chat in the center between runs. Seems like it would be pretty simple to implement too.
---
Instead, he made history. 
---
I got this task the other day, 175 of them. 
---
I think i lost money on prayer pots and antifires. 
---
That equates to more. Thinking about it, if he invested it/got interest, he coulda gained even more
---
Read the edit
---
ehhhh, central ontario IS cananda, get used to it
---
Can we stop telling me what to suggest? 
---
I started running yanillian hops with my herb runs because people are lazy and they sell for 1k each.. adds 5 mins to my runs and makes me an extra 40-80k a run
---
Made such a great move to get 99 con as my first 99. Made everything so much easier
---
If I played during that time they had 5$ memberships but I stopped playing and just came back, would I be able to still get men’s for $5?
---
He got 200m rc, pretty sure he could handle 17 hours
---
Honestly I farmed 5k slayer points to prep for hydra using cannon/blowpipe the entire time and ran into pkers maybe 3 times, even anti-pked one of them because most of them are indeed terrible players. You guys grossly overestimate how competent the majority of pkers are and just how often you run into them, then you have the cheek to complain when you get caught in monk robes with shitty food and no prayer on your shitty ironman account.
---
can't afford tabs gang
---
Mailing lists can take a bit to update. Next one should be sent to the new one.
---
Suggestion: proofread your comments.
---
Continuity always makes the game better. 
---
I house tab so often that I have tabbed within my own POH to get back to the portals and pool. 
---
Cannon isn’t really the meta anymore 
---
They litterally used to have dedicated agility themed world and the bastards took it away....
---
I'm still salty.
---
Ya like books?
---
I seem to have no problem remembering that a Varock tele requires one fire rune but I keep forgetting "how many air runes again?". It's easy to forget when you got used to walking around with an elemental staff for a long time.
---
i talking about black d'hide top having a def req but not the chaps. seems like an oversight from 2004.
---
It's a reasonable question, especially considering some of those plugins are quite powerful. I would say it's because the community essentially demands it, and has threatened to quit in large numbers if third party clients were banned, *especially* if that ban were applied only to RL and not OSB. This came to a head around a year ago.
---
I’d assume people saw them removed so assumed they’d get a high price so put them for sad
---
!remindme 2 months
---
Can we have the ability to use keypad to input bank pins? It would be way faster and would stop streamers/youtubers from having to hide their screens
---
S

I'm pretty sure you've never worked a 17 hour day.

&gt;Carnivorous

&gt;&gt;feeding on other animals.

&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;Fish
---
 &gt;&gt;Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate **animals** 
---
This _is_ a QOL change. The compost whether used from bin/buckets or with the spell all has the same affect, this doesnt change that.
---
Totally agree with you. Had to skip that one and the abberant spectres tasks. I just hit cb 90 as well so while i know i could, it just isnt worth the time. 
---
nah bogan is australian slang for white trash basically. 
---
Madlad
---
I would rather use an rcb and dia/ruby at that level. Your accuracy will be super low otherwise.
---
My magic is still 1....
---

---
Im certain you havent played osrs for 17 hours let alone rune craft for 17 hours
---
I think all of you misunderstood my question. I was more so asking towards, what motivated them to do tree runs, and not just fruit tree, calquat and hardwood tree runs. I'm 93 farming and I've only planted regular trees for diaries. All my other xp comes from Fruit/Hardwood/Calquat and now Celastrus.
---
But to come back to your "Willows and maples are actually almost 2x as much gp/XP" statement, I fear that is not correct.
---
Willows are -4.01 gp/xp, maples are -12.9 and magics are -14.96.
---
Compare that to Mahogany (-0.59), Calquat (-0.12), Celastrus (-4.89) and Papaya (-1.65) or Palm (-4.67), you would save so much money to just skip tree runs. Sure, you will take more days to complete it, but you also have to plant fewer trees a day.
---
Whats your point? People are still throwing money at it.  There's 0 reason to give your money to someone else lmao
---
my pc is reqally weird, one day i need the GPU plugin to play at a stable framerate, the next day i have to turn GPU off because it laggs my game. i keep switching every couple days.
---
Great data and write up, love it. Looking forward to loot from 100 hard contracts, though the dev team have hinted at changing up contract rewards to vary with time so that could become obsolete information soon.
---
I was doing contracts myself when the content first dropped but im finding thats its not really worth it for me, somewhat mediocre gp and too much xp lost since im constantly forgetting what i last planted like an idiot so i keep having to ask the farmer.
---
Hespori on the other hand, i swear that boss is 3m/hr if u kill it in 1:30 on average.
---
Tbh I do lol
---
"Screenshot"
---
It's also enabled by default
---
Barely an hour old on a Monday, that's probably why.
---
Great post though, thanks man.
---
&gt;at 44 wilderness, with lobsters, at 56 prayer
---
There's your problem, you aren't ready for the wilderness lol, you're trying to cheese your way through the content because you're entitled.
---
Also how are 4 people "bursting" you at 44's? Even if it was multi though you realise with the correct gear you can actually tank 15+ people right? I'm expecting you to just turn around and say "but i'm an ironman, I can't prep for this!" well unfortunately for you the wilderness isn't balanced around ironmen and never will be.
---
Can ultracompost be recolored from supercompost when it's in the bin? Currently it remains the same color after volcanic ash is put in.
---
Make sure you clear that shit with your boss first. B2p tabs are only about 90s afk.
---
100 x 7.7k = 7.7mil???
---
Void range isn’t bis at cox, please don’t try and claim it is if you’re not sure what you’re talking about 
---
definitely weird since you can get konar drops in kraken boss instance, I swear I heard mod ash talking about how it should work for garg boss too. but i’ve done like 2 and a half tasks there and no konar drop.
---
I get weird lag so I'll end up with 1 law 1 fire and 2 air.
---
all i gotta say is i was very very happy with my 2 blue dragon task in catacombs. 2 visages in 2 tasks, was veryy happy lol
---
Does need to be looked at but just skip 4Head
---
I got them as well, thought it was an oversight. I did maybe 6 or 7 kills depending on rng per trip. the worst part was the terrible ranged xp, but other than that it was mostly tedious. Did it with ancient d'hide, arch ring and a rune xbow w amethyst bolts. really wish I had 140mill for a dhunter xbow
---
I just like the word 'Carnivore' and thought it was catchier than 2HNoFish, my other idea
---
if you opened 100 contracts and got 7.7m, wouldnt the average worth be 77k rather than 7.7k?
---
Still doesn't change the fact that 15/hr isn't minimum wage... 
---
I can't think of any skill that takes 1/4th the 99 time to 72.
---
Are u on linux?
---
That's why I don't go there in general. Too scared to risk 100k lol
---
r/SmokeStaffSquad
---
Harmony island elite diary?
---
i use tele tabs or a air staff because of this lol
---
You should get Karamja gloves.
---
Working a 17 hour job and playing runescape for 17 hours are totally different things and you know it.
---
You're just committed to your hypothetical scenario. 
---
Yes.
---
Lmfaooo man i feel for your pain, it really is all a big circle jerk with the articles
---
For real, instead of cleaning myself at sand casino now i have a 99 con cape to rebuild with. Best part is i can never lose my house at sand casino lmao.
---
Edible my ass, fondant is gross.
---
When you're so insecure about your own opinion you add "kid" just to justify your authority.
---
YOU AS COLD AS ICE
---
What's the problem?
---
At least more herbs are being added to the gme through skilling, not pvming
---
So you're spite voting, causing 1 def pures to get angry at you zerkers and in return spite voting against anything benefiting zerkers.
---
Is this community so retarded that you don't get that when you vote against something to spite someone, you're getting spite voted back. And then you both have **nothing**
---
yeah but if you cannon and walk away for a minute you're getting subpar xp.
---
They were made optional because people did not like them. Bots were made to be able to handle random events and would be able to be modified to handle new/changed random events. The only thing that random events were punishing were players who were afk like fishing or woodcutting. Nobody liked looking at a different window for a couple minutes only to find themselves half dead from an aggressive random or in some random location in the world because the random teleported you for ignoring them.
---
well we are men of culture, we can not allow such bullshit enter our game.
---
Weird? This is the most appropriate flex
---
cringe lord LOL
---
Because god versions are exactly that, versions of common base armor (black d'hide, rune) with a minor prayer bonus. They're not their own thing. 
---
Why are players new to Slayer going to konar lol
---
Or just vote no xd
---
Option to get ores as noted from motherlode mine like you get from blast mine. It could be one time fee with nuggets.
---
Can we move the poll booth away from the deposit box in Motherlode mine? Especially on mobile it is way too easy to hit poll booth instead of deposit box. Maybe put it like 2 squares away, or just get rid of it entirely since I bet nobody uses it anyway.
---
What was your order of elite diaries done?
---
I've done Lumbridge, and I think I'm going to do Kandarin, Varrock, Fremennik in that order next
---
Yeah, but you gotta take into account that i suck
---
but... it's when you use earth runes to make lavas?
---
Bloods have gone down in price a lot.  So it makes the spaghetti staff cheaper to use!
---
Imo atleast 50 days of playtime and 1500+ total would be a good start.
---
Of course, look what happened shortly after minnows came out. 
---
1remindme 2 months 
---
Because they're literally the exact same as black d'hide apart from the +1 prayer bonus??? Jagex nerfing Black dhide but not God dhide would be retarded. 
---
Barbarianism is definitely the first song I would have thought of, especially as I spent most of my previous time in Runescape killing hillys for their b bones.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I might that and way more edited path, but I wanted this video to be my night at full length, just showing what I do and how, so that if someone wanted to help me improve, they could point out stuff I'm not doing right. In highlights, people would most likely not notice that.

Level 89 range and I decided to commit to my brutal blue task it's been 3 days and I have 70 left still. I thought it would be a decent money maker but it is not. I've come to far to skip this task now, wish me luck.

Slayer is really easy mate, you'll get it
---
Oof
---
I've never seen anyone this mad for being called out on their shit. Yikes.
---
can you give an example of the stats of such an account?
---
That's not an upgrade at all. They both have the same +15 magic attack bonus. 
---
only works on herbs, and is a glitch. 
---
Yes very worth to sell prospectors for upper level.  Upper level is a game changer.
---
How can this many people not see a shortcut symbol on their map?
---
Nice downvotes, casual.
---
A third of you teleports and the rest of you is on fire.
---
Two more slightly more than QoL sized suggestions that are less realistic but I would like to suggest.
---
4.  Give us a use for ecto tokens.  Currently the only real use is bonecrusher, and even that you don't need that many.  Maybe some go or something to offset the cost of bones, maybe a ghost deciple robe to let you crush bones quicker or additional prayer xp when offering at the ecto.
---
5.  Maybe a phials equal at the ecto, letting me unnote slime and bonemeal so I can sit and pray without a bunch of teleports.  Getting the slime and crushing the bonemeal already is the time sink, banking shouldn't be.
---
Suggestion: using earth runes on a pillar consumes the whole stack
---
Got it to 58 in one go from those &gt;.&lt; from 30 orso can’t remember the minimum req.

Always reminds me of the Hellena Prison from Legend of Dragoon. idk why
---
Thanks but when I do that it manually resets the colors of the bars. No idea why. 
---
Pretty much that yeah. The western provinces diary has comparatively low reqs but also comparatively low value. Still, I'll probably end up doing that next. 
---
That except seas &gt; sang. No point in spending an extra 700 gp per cast when you 3 shot the brothers anyway

Good shit

Improve harvesting and filling/emptying compost bins speed (1 item per 1 tick, or the whole thing at once like flowers)
---
I like this idea, just a universal world for any and all agility training.
---
Would be nice to have themed worlds for other skills too, though it might get a little hostile with the gathering skills...
---
Fix the weird delay after closing bank which ignores some actions (i.e. using an item on another item) for a few ticks
---
I mean you can do whatever you want but 99 fm followed by 99 thieving is one of the best starts you can have. 
---
Make magic secateurs work from inventory
---
Hey can we get a NMZ type mini game for skilling? I’m almost finished maxing out my combats so it would come in handy to be able to train other skills too. Right now skilling training is too annoying and too slow so we NEEEED a mini game where you can just click once in a while and get like 100k xp in a skill u want.
---
Well I got told I should switch to konar as soon as I could because the gold rewards were so good.

Wow this is wonderful!

Bingo! So you can save 25k per tree aka 75k a run or you can make an extra 600k+ a day
---
But this is literally streamlining something. Aka a QoL update... 
---
Well... I have 80 thieve on a 2100 total main. So I will not be doing 99 thieve haha. I HATE the skill with a passion. 
---
I played osrs in a 15 hour session on my day off once, it was a lot less exhausting and much less difficult than working an 11 hour shift

Man, this is great content!

Just to check, you read the second sentence and are affirming you don't play for even a couple hours a day, right?

Fishing levels?

You doing the ogress or the ogres?  I enjoyed doing the Ogress a lot more on my low level pure and both are cannonable.

Not only do randoms have audio cues for when you're offscreen, but they can be adjusted to where they don't gank you for a set amount of time to give the player time to acknowledge them.
---
I'm not saying to put them back the way they were. I'm saying to give them a serious look and change them in ways that will combat bots again WITHOUT handicapping players. 
---
More like loot from one bouncer conversation 
---
Hmm that's interesting you note that. I've had a few pot. cac. and regular cac. but didn't notice a difference in amount of contracts.
---
I might have to start logging which contracts I get as well. 
---
Personally I am ok with the the new herb patch in Prif. I feel like it is a fair reward for a questline that includes MEP2 and the new grandmaster quest.

Herblore QoL suggestions:
---
1) Make-all for Coconut milk. Currently you have to use half coconut individually on empty vials for every coconut milk.
---
2) Make-all for Weapon poison (+) and similar potions. Similar to above, you have to use cactus spines individually on coconut milk (for weapon poison (+)).
---
3) Auto crush all coconuts in your inventory when you use a hammer on one, similar to how turning dark essence blocks to fragments works. 
---
Make it possible to catch implings barehanded while wielding a butterfly net but without any jars in your inventory
---
Runescape music videos are making a comeback.

... you use a cannon to lure smoke devils for barraging

From where I am now (83 Slayer), 93 Slayer is something like 100 Hours of slaying away, so that might end up being one of my lasts

I will ALWAYS drop my "burn a redwood log" clues, because I've already done the 85 fm grind once on my main and I'm not about to do that cancer again.

This.  With 13 prayer you can still do desert treasure also. 
---
Please add a “Treasure Vault” perhaps in Varrock west basement - a standalone bank that can store unfinished treasure trail sets. 
---
WE NEED SICKO BAMBA 
---
Cooking and fletching are significantly faster and cheaper and are pretty easy bankstanding skills. 
---
Magics, redwoods, anglers, and sharks seem to be pretty popular afk activities.
---
Efficient smithing is just too expensive, and the click pattern of Blast Furnace is tedious and punishing of small mistakes (glove switch delay, missing a stam pot) that people try not to do more than needed
---
The blowpipe in almost every case. 
---
Accuracy has diminishing returns, so when you're fighting low defence monsters the difference in cannon accuracy between an ACB and a blowpipe is going to be extremely small. 
---
Put your 5 def lure away kiddo. 
---
I believe just doing DT will leave you with 11 prayer. So are you recommending to just bury bones to cover 11-13? Or just have 11 prayer until 64 combat then do Restless Ghost for 15?
---
Is there reason why browsing between Quest / Archievemnt diary / minigames / Kourend favor tabs cancels for some skilling like blowing molten glass?
---
No it’s not retard. They released minnows at the same time that they nerfed zulrah 30%. Minnows were so heavily botted that they tanked sharks down to 600ea. 
---
Get your “facts” straight

What the fuck

Charging orbs is quite profitable actually
---
Agreed, it just looks like bad game design from their pov. 
---
"literally the point of the game is to max your account. oh, unless you dont want to"
---
....aaaaaaaaaand if you dont want to work on maxing, then maybe you shouldnt want to max...?
---
all it is is just entitlement from people who think they deserve everything even without actually doing it. i dont know about you but i dont think i deserve an inferno cape or that they should make it easier because i never completed the inferno. i dont think the pet rates should be nerfed even though i only have one.
---
i think it would be perfectly fine if achievements were reserved for those actually willing to do whats required for them.
---
I don’t know what requirements this should be put behind but this is a great idea! Not sure about the double speed thing but having a faster way to mine and bank it like noting it would be so nice
---
just literally dont click it...

On the bright side at least you know the color of your energy

Can the ardy cloak be allowed on etrana? This would allow for more convenient combination of herb and hop runs.

Can the dialogue for paying Alan in the farming guild be removed? Currently, he first asks what you want to have protected, but this question can replace the "Select option" text in the dialogue where you make your choice.
---
Can the smithing interface get buttons to set a default quantity?
---
may steal this pattern :)
---
I don't get it
---
Imagine doing Slayer for those first 9 levels reeee
---
Was good until overload. Overload has no place in osrs outside raids and nmz. Also incense seems like it would be frustrating for ppl trying to be efficient. Also requiring making friends with my arm for such a big upgrade is not a good idea.
---
First one is just you
---
This data and the way you've presented it is fantastic. It's clear you put so much hard work into this! I'd be interested to know, if in the future you cover hard contracts, the amount of time it takes to complete 100, to give a (very rough) idea of average time / contract. With that said excellent data, I hope you do more! 
---
Fuck efficiency, play for fun
---
The ability to combine the gold smithing gauntlets with ice gloves.

Just pay Venezuelans to work for you instead and pocket the money they make while maxing on rs?

---
All I've really done is Slayer. 
---
How many fakes you got? 
---
Pets, at least, are significantly more likely. Not sure for other rare drops.
---
I don't think dropping of barb fish was intended though, my idea will not punish players for dropping barb fish or anything like that but instead allow them to choose if they want to cut them because this will just add value to cutting them, is all. 
---
Seconding the other guy, when I was poor I charged orbs to 71, made a bit of cash to buy other runes with too.
---
Waterfall, witch's house, fight arena, tree gnome village, grand tree. 
---
These are essential beginners member quests that get you a massive head start
---
Balanced? Ranged is already op asf and there are many suggestions for nerfing ranged. The overload would be a huge buff to ranged.
---
It's weird because it is kind of fitting
---
who gives a shit lmao
---
Regarding 2. I'd say that there should be an upgraded version of the ectophial that can refill automatically by absorbing ectoplasm from the air.
---
I made a money making guide back in the day, it was a decent guide but it was just after RS got a big graphics update and running Runescape + Hypercam just absolutely raped my frames so the guide is at like 3fps.
---

---
Good it shouldn’t be predictable 
---
Tanking and dks
---
Hard rewards average like 100k.  Its important to prioritize quick contracts, so magic and yew trees are pretty bad in that respect as well.  I preplant maples and papaya, and skip most other tree/fruit tree contacts.  Most times I can complete an easy contract and a new hard in the time it would take for a palm tree to grow.
---
To the top of the hiscores 
---
As a skill? No. However similar contracts for all skills in their respective guilds would be amazing. Basically artisan without the actual skill would be awesome 
---
Nah devalues my 14 water sources and 13 cooking ranges only pisc only ultimate ironman. Would ruin my YouTube serious Can't have that piss off easyscape main kid

Have you even read the whole conversation? I'm comparing old a friend to settled. Do you think 5 daily 10 hour loot videos of bosses are low effort?
---
it's in the picture: 116,113
---
"Abberant" spectres when assigned in the catacombs is not fun aswell. I know deviant spectres are not as level as that, but at mid level it  is painstaking and slow, especially since she assigns a high amount.
---
Suggestion: delete Zeah

**RUNESCAPERS RISE!**

Questing. It gets you some nice and quick early levels and most quest bosses can easily be defeated with just safespotting with strike spells.

Is it that bad these days? I'll admit I haven't done it yet since my return to RS. I remember it being way easier in a BA clan chat to find a team, rather than team up with noobs in the lobby. 
---
When doing pyramid plunder, the chance to get a sceptre is 1/1k, but you only roll when a swarm doesn't appear. 
---
Is this the same for the pet rolls, or do you get a roll regardless of a swarm appearing?
---
But muh efficiency bruuuhhhhhhurrduurrduuurr.
---

---
Dust law and chaos
---
And allow Vorkath to give us oral after we wake him up, fair trade
---
When Hespori is fully grown have vines grow on/around the cave's entrance so players don't have to constantly run inside the cave to check if it's fully grown or not.
---
Also some kind of indicator or notification when the Kronos seed effect skips a growth cycle would be really helpful. Maybe we could use the Amulet of Nature on the Kronos plant so that the amulet notifies us when the Kronos plant activates?
---
To add to all of this it would be pretty cool if we could build something similar to portals in our PoH that allows us to use Geomancy from the lunar spellbook an unlimited amount of times so we can check up on our plants more easily and realistically. 
---
Alternatively some kind of item (maybe the amulet of nature, or an upgrade to it?) that we can fill with Geomancy's rune cost that we can use to check up on our patch statuses without having to change our spellbook and then using the spell to check up on our patches. I personally think it's too much of a hassle to check up on the status of our patches in-game, especially considering many 3rd party do so with much more ease, although less accurately.
---
Used a of em for pray xp  Gives lots as well.
---
Mice
---
Only use tent for pvm or pvp reg whip is fine for slayer or training 
---
You have 15 prayer probably.Time to restart
---
I have no problem with overload being scrapped from the idea entirely.
---
And thats a good point about the quest lock, maybe having the salt as an ingredient is good enough (makes it a req for ironmen)
---
French Canadians. Looks pretty par for the course.

Rank 1 slayer

Im a maxed main and I have this task as well with no points left because I was trying to get a hydra task. RIP slayer.

Or even better, create some way to automatically carry those tools on your account instead of having them litter the ground. I can't believe nobody else has thought of this idea before.

Hell yes I do! Use fusion 360!

All about play time and using your time wisely. As you level you’ll learn more and progress quicker just be open to advice

Oh that’s good too! It was crowded there as I was playing at a peak time but you are right, that spot is pry best

looking forward to semi finals with classic sea shanty 2
---
That's $132/yr or $0.36 per day. Do you get 36 cents of enjoyment per day from runescape membership? I think it's pretty reasonable for them to have raised the price since 2001

TL;DR: Reduce the cost of Zamorak's Grapes charges OR have Bologa's Blessing create a Zamorakian Seed which is then harvested for Zamorak's Grapes.
---
As it stands right now, it costs 2 points to obtain a grape seed, and then a point for each Zamorak's grapes. Keep in mind playing the minigame gets you about 1 point per minute.
---
My suggestion is that instead of the Bologa's Blessing expending charges when each harvest occurs, to instead have the ability to be used to turn a standard Grape Seed into a Zamorakian Grape Seed. This would cause all grapes harvested from that bush to be Zamorak's Grapes. If this was the case, each point from Tithe Farm would go much further in terms of harvesting Zamorak wines.
---
Perhaps if this change was implemented, the cost of each charge of Bologa's blessing could be increased from 1 point to 2 or 3 points. This way, each plant could cost up to 5 points. As it stands right now, 5 points would only get you 3 Zamorak wines (2 points for the seed plus 3 points for the harvested grapes).
---

I have 99 combat and 77 slayer. Ive been doing neive for the first 9 tasks, then do Konar for the 10th, 50th, etc task. When I get to 100 I may switch to duradel but we will see. Maybe try that. You get some good xp with neive and then every 1-th task you get some konar rewards.
---
Make sewing needles unbreakable and also unstackable 
---
Yes
---
I'm still killing hespori for one since I'm a btw :(
---
Except Zulrah was constantly farmed and the drop was not that rare. I've never seen a shark drop during several hours of Konar slayer.
---
I feel like removing them from Zulrah hurt ironmen, but isn't the point of ironman mode to be inconvenienced somewhat?
---
I think that's my spirit animal
---
The part where pures might actually risk more than 50k to kill you, giving you some sort of reason to fight back. Or the part where the price increases for clue scrollers. Or maybe there really isn't a benefit to you, in which case why vote at all? If you think the +1 prayer bonus would actually do anything you're definitely mistaken. 
---
I guess it moreso comes down to the fact that I'm not trying super hard to get 99. I'm just doing whatever I feel like. 
---
Maples are too expensive to make the profit worth imo
---
And I thought my 23k kills was a lot.  How many daggers did u get?
---
"Completely over-saturated"? Careful, Jagex might take that as a challenge.
---
Tbh i'd want a cake like that if i only had 2 weeks left to live too. 
---
Can pay in gold and it's not against the rules.. but Tom will not be cheap by any means 
---
Right, context.  
---
During a dev stream Mod Ash pitched an idea for a brewing buff.  
---
The idea was to make beers give persistent boosts. 
---
You seem to have a solid view on keeping the longevity of the game though so 1500 would be a good a start no?
---
and it's QoL
---
wow some actually relevant QoL suggestions, good shit
---
You can safespot them with ranged. It'll still be slow but it might help.
---
Can the lucky rabbit's foot be improved in a few ways? Seeing that nests should come from skilling, allowing woodcutters more access to nests fits both thematically and improved WC's meme-tier money-making.
---
- A notification when the rabbit's foot procs, similar to ring of wealth shining more brightly.
---
- An option to have lucky rabbit's foot auto pick-up nests, preferably locked behind western diary or charged via bird eggs at the guild?
---
- buffed possibly via an unlock to increase bird's nest chance or improved rarity of seeds?
---
Picking flax should give farming XP
---
* It makes sense, you're handling a small plant
---
* RS3 does it already
---
Nah mains have it easy with silverhawk boots, forgot about them. Aren't wines insane cook XP? I only play ironman on both games so not sure 
---
You definitely can. You need to link it through the account management page I believe.
---
It's not about whether I think they already have enough content or not, it's about what the devs think. What they think ultimately decides how the updates go. And plus, there is still a significant portion of the player base that wants more content to be added
---

OP is right, this is an oversight, there's too many of them assigned. It should be like 50 max.

Ok.  I'll paraphrase then.  I can get why a fella like you might struggle with two entire paragraphs.
---
&gt;If we balance content, people will quit, so let's have unbalanced content!

That's what you're saying, I hope you see how stupid that is
---
It's the 3 week anniversary since my cat died of cancer.
---
You mean the runecrafting pouches? I think that would make a significant difference to runecrafting xp/hr, especially for methods with quick runs like lavas. Not saying that's a bad thing, but that's a significant change and not just a QoL.
---
Bots?
---
Makes sense to keep them standing still like the leprechauns.

Keep em coming.

There's no reason to require over 100 kills of a lvl 271 npc.

I've honestly never seen bots at volcanic ash. And you can get it from blast mine.
---
If you use turael to reset, you lose your streak and start over from 0. So if you're at 99 tasks and use turael to cancel a task, you won't get the 100th task bonus points, because the turael task will count as #1 on a new steak. 
---
You're reading an awful lot into my words and coming up with false implications and assumptions, getting angry over nothing. Please reconsider your attitude
---
You're saying that it's supposed to feel like RS did 2007, this is not true anymore. This was the point when it was released, we had euphoric nostalgia trips we didn't think was possible, and 6-9 months down the road the game became stale. 
---
Why? Because the game was literally empty at high level. There wasn't any point in a lot of skilling either, because high reqs in quests/diaries didn't exist. New methods for skilling is necessary, doing some cleanup here and there is necessary as well. Problem is that few QoL's can dramatically increase xp rates. The best example is being able to use keyboard in conversations/interfaces, making construction insanely high xp/hour.
---
The game is not '07 scape, nor is it really "OSRS". It's RuneScape 2 taking another path, which is 100x better than the RS3 path. Everything they design these days still has an OSRS feel to it imo. You can start out the game, and it will still feel like it's 2007.
---
I've never been in Lumbridge castle cellar without seeing splashers

Kinda like farming the cows in Witcher 3.

"Take a seat, Skywalker"

The spider will grant them the opportunity of magic training but they will not receive the rank of being a master mage.

No they aren’t because you use way more air runes for most teleports than you use fire or earth runes.

Are you trying to log in to a f2p world?

You just have to start mep1 it if I recall correctly.

House tabs for everything. Every portals for every teleport in my house. Only thing I'm missing is ornate and fairy ring. But I dont have 200m to drop.
---
Killer dude. Those are some of the best ones in the game. I try to keep as many cool quest items as I can, but I've run out of bank space and had to drop some. My favorite that I still have is the demonic sigil so I can still do the Agrith-naar chant whenever I want to.
---
There were 'Agility Training' worlds for a long time. There was no reason for them to take them out.
---
* Increasing the rate at which you can fill up buckets at the Large Compost bin in the farming guild. Maybe make it limited to just the Bottomless Bucket so no extra compost hits the market? Or alternatively just make it so you can instantly add the charges to the Bottomless Bucket for the same reason.
---
* Make the statue outside of the Hespori cave strike a pose when it's ready to harvest. This would save having to go in and out constantly to check.
---
* Add White Lily seeds to the Hespori Collection Log. It's unique to its drop table.
---
* Make the Bottomless buckets have different models depending on what Compost has been added to them.
---
* Make the compost inside of the bins have a different colour if it's Ultra Compost. Allow us to sprinkle some volcanic ash before you close it as well to turn it Ultra.
---
* Allow you to use the Seed Box on a patch to plant a seed from the box in that patch. 
---
* Add an option to buy a Spade from a gardener, like how you can for other farming related gear. Alternatively, make it no longer dialogue based and make them shop NPCs who sell all the stuff they currently offer.
---
* Magical Secateurs bonus from inventory.
---
* Amulet of Nature from inventory.
---
Of course this is a thing, haha
---
wow lmao
---
Yeah I was expecting like a Bank and a couple shops or something. Nothing too significant, but I was expecting it to feel like another town (which right now it doesn't). Something like Jatizo (maybe a bit smaller).

I mean 3 is considered several. Several is a very subjective word, typically meaning over 2. 
---
Either way the argument about what quantifies several doesn't seem to really matter. The point is the task is more than unreasonably long for someone of lower combat or less gear.
---
Interesting read about Few, Several and Many discussed in line with LSAT.

Can we plz speed up how we take out compost from compost bins? Rn its a lot slower than putting fruit in. Only way to match it is through click on each bucket. I dont get the need for this slow to be applied to it.
---
How long did it take to make, looks mazing
---
My dude that's still basically 2 hours and you're estimating. No matter how maxed you get it's gonna be around 2 hours. That's a long time for a task no matter how you look at it. The fact you defaulted to saying you were simply correcting that it's a couple and not a few was a semantic last ditch defense. That's all I'm saying. The guys point was still obvious, that it takes a long time even at max. Even your math now proves it takes absurdly long. You bringing up the semantics of it didn't contribute anything and just looked like an effort to backtrack.

He is level 63. With 1 def. Not hard for a dark bow spec to hit 10 hp

It's a guaranteed purple on the wheel, not a guaranteed 200m, iirc
---
That's the problem. It's nothing revolutionary. I want a skill I'm excited to train, not another skill I have to train. But I also wanted sailing so what do I know. 
---
&gt;It's not good design at all, you're still running from bank to altar 99% of the time you're training.
---
I don't know why you've convinced yourself this is a bad trait, like I don't understand how running across karamja crafting double nats is worse than standing still by 3 iron rocks in one place and dropping them. Or going through the abyss which is dangerous for some accounts, risks getting pk:ed and can look at what's happening in the edge bank, the most interesting bank in runescape. 
---
As long as you don't just grind the same altar for hours on end I don't see how RC is boring or bad design, every activity is tedious if you do it for 2+ hours imo.

Contracts in all guilds would make the game so dailyscape tho

I recently did 84 -&gt; 99 with oak dungeon doors. I found a method that lets you do the entire process without moving your mouse, while constantly holding down the 1 key from [this video](https://youtu.be/BAwbLydgmzs?t=17) which made it rather easy.

Just do slayer until 85-90 att and 90 str 92+ hp then use dharoks for like 95k xp/hr with absorption and overload pots

Nice.
---
Reporting them does nothing. I tried that. I knew exactly where I was standing in the pvp world was safe, I’ve played this game for 14 years and I know how pathing works in this game. Luring I don’t think is bannable. But bug abuse is. I would never have been killed if it wasn’t for the animation stall. Their character appears inside the bank for up to 30 seconds, even their white dot on the minimap. But in reality, they’re standing outside the bank when you click trade, and your character runs out of the safe area. GG LIFE.
---
I voted no because I don't pvp and I don't want to make it easier to kill/smite me when I'm out in the wild. I understand +1 prayer isn't much, but there isn't any incentive for me to vote for buffs for pures/PKers. It's not that I blame them for attacking/killing me, it's the wild and it's fair game so I'm fine with that, but why would I vote to increase their power even marginally? 
---
I get that it's shitty being in a group where any potential updates get voted down by another group, but on an individual level it just doesn't make sense for me to vote yes. For stuff that doesn't affect me, I'm happy to vote yes because I'm not voting out of spite, just in my own interest

I'm not saying it was perfect, I agree, I remember playing from original RS2, and It was hell spamming.... But the fact of the matter is that the G.E. ultimately changed the dynamics of the gameplay... Its no longer about how hard is a certain boss, and can I beat that boss... i
---
Its now, can i sustain killing 'xxx' monster long enough to afford the gold to get that weapon so i can breeze through the game....
---
From the perspective of an ironman character build... the game in its original Form is why it was so damn popular... 
---
I'm not saying the G.E. was entirely bad... It's that, why restrict a set of players from content if there is a desire for that content...
---
In the same way that people aren't forced to play Deadman or Ironman, they wont be forced to play Merchantman....

Honestly, There's so much hostility in this sub about this Idea and I just don't get it...

Alright, thanks for the info. I'll be getting my whip next and then do controlled.

Thanks for the reply. I hadn't actually thought about this, but I did look it up and looks like I can do Death Plateau. Thanks for the help! Hopefully I can find other ways too
---
They already addressed this multiple times: The bank needs that 1 extra tick to close properly or else there could happen major bugs.

What better weapons do you mean? Abyssal whip or?

Some people don't enjoy wintertodt and there's no motivation to rush 99 fm on a normal account unless it's your last skill (the cape is just a lightsource that never goes out... so is the kandarin headgear, which takes less than an hour to get on a new account). I have 99 rc but only 90 fm for that reason.
---
Bringing a mage cape with ancients switch still requires the same amount of inventory spaces, and can only be attempted 5 times in a day. We are discussing the utility of the standard spell book, I can invalidate any argument of balance by bringing in alts and teams/clans. That's not the point, in it's current form the standard spell book is outclassed by ancients, virtually unusable against dhide/mage pray, and requires an unreasonable amount of risk/inventory to use for what it does. That's why its seldom used, pretty much everyone who pks is in agreement about this. The fact that it's not passing is just pvmers voting in blatant self interest/ignorance
---
Get 70 attack and then just play the game. Around 70/70/70 alot of content becomes viable. Don't get into the max mentality of "well if i get a strength level first I get my next attack level .00001% faster".
---
They are specifically talking about the brutal here... 
---
Death plateau, vampire slayer, tree gnome village
---
ya just avoiding the boss coz i dont like the concept of farm xp upon kill and pet chance
---
Honestly once youre 60+ attack i would keep strength at least 5 levels higher, or a few at minimum. Theres a few reasons for this. Higher str means faster attack training, higher attack means faster defense. So its actually faster/more efficient to have str higher then attack, then do attack then defense. 
---
I get that. I think my point still stands,
---
You know? Something like this doesn’t necessitate a change, in my opinion. Desktop playing will probably always be the meta for efficiency, except in special cases.
---
smoke staff is justified if you run seers agility and alch :~)
---
Just make it a new skill, call it Aviation. 
---
Are there any recc weps at 70 except the aby whip?
---
I've done both and the skills definitely dont translate 
---
&gt; By the way if we have more data and find out later that the average medium contract is indeed ~70k and a hard one even more, then surely it's worth it to do the white lilies, right? 
---
Probably, and I was under the assumption that Lillies were still pretty expensive, seems they're down to just 20k now, which is within reason for me to not risk getting a Tree/Fruit Tree contract on a downgrade.
---
I have probably done about 100 contracts as well, mostly medium, many hard, few easy.  Unfortunately, I have not kept up with any data from my Seed Packs.  My personal anecdotal experience would be WAY more mahogonies, quite a few more Torstols.  Everything else seems on par.

I wish the Wildy wasn't a boring apocalypse. You go out to do something, get teleblocked by a zombie who's been there all day, attempt to run away or fight back and then you die. PVP, just like everything else nowadays, is all about efficiency. I could at least chuckle if I died to some guy who wore something wacky, gave a 1 liner or ripped on your name like "John Cena?! More like... John Cya later!" I've only ever had boring and negative experiences with PKers when trying to access more interesting content. I remember it being different back in the day, but maybe that's just nostalgia.
---
Anal beads
---
ya brain runs 100mph i could never learn punctuation dyslexic
---
If you're going for the first 99 attack with all other combats 1 and 10hp, good luck
---
People in this game like to find any reason they can to take the moral high ground 
---
At 99 rc with mouse keys and crafting cape you can get 78k/h absolute maximum, just a fun fact.
---
Ah typical one of those guys who thinks content that they’ve clearly never done should be a certain way 
---
Why do people who clearly dont raid bother to speak about raiding? Actually stfu about shit you dont know anything about
---
I though there was another one to offer recolors for black (kbd) and blue (vorkath) as well, but I cant find it in the poll archives actually.... i know they showed pictures in one of their dev blogs though and it seemed like people were interested 
---
Haha yeah that’s true I forgot about that.. also that would be cool. I was thinking there could be an armor that actually has lower stats but as you take damage maybe your defense increases to what damage you are taking. (Obviously I’m only talking about pvming effects)
---
You could end streak or train ranged fast
---
Sadly it wouldnt be viable, like at all. Strength bonus is the end-all BiS when it comes to any combat stat. 
---
I DO wish though this game operated like other mmos where you would need a designated character to actually tank, one guy for dps, one for healing or etc. 
---
Now what *could* be interesting is new tank armor that aggros monsters to only you (that have non AoE attacks) and then having negative offensive stats could be useful. However depending on how tanky it is, it could become pretty broken for doing like duo bandos or something. BUT that would at least be a cool mechanic.

I’ve done both and I think they do. Now I’m not saying it’s a 1:1 translation as if you can practice for inferno by doing solo raids because that’s laughable. But it’s also laughable to think that someone who’s never solo raided before will be equally as likely to complete inferno as someone who has solo raided

People are opposed to ezscape and methods which leads to rs3 and its devalued skilling scene. If every skill could be finished off by afking and basically  sleeping (guthans/splashing in the past), no one would put in effort since there's no payoffs. 
---
I would offer to give you a set, but I pet your original intent was for that very thing to happen, so I refuse to walk right into your trap.
---
Well not yet. But I will in the future. I recently came back to beading after a 3 year break. So I’ll try to get going, see what I like to do and then choose a community where I think people would be interested enough to buy my work. Also shipping is a nightmare. 
---
you have to click every 20 minutes otherwise you log out, and no matter what thr game will automatically log you off if you've been online for 6 hours nonstop. You used to be able to do what you just said, but they changed that long ago

---
It's far from zero effort
---
A bit late to the party, but does it affect everything simultaneously? Because if not, I don't see the use outside of farming contracts. For herb/tree/fruit trees, most people will only do the run when all of them are complete. 
---
I know I wouldn't be making a separate trip to check one papaya that finished an hour before the others. In fact that'd just fuck up my rotation next time regardless of if I still had a kronos

I saved slayer for last thinking that "saving the best for last" was a good idea. I ended up just wanting to be maxed so much that it partially ruined it for me. If you can make another skill last (something fast) then that would be the best idea, I think.

---
Don't think that's what he was getting at, I believe he's trying to say you just spend money on casts, click the rat/spider, then you're free to go AFK, so it's basically buying XP without any interaction from the player, unlike construction where the player has to be active.
---
Personally I don't really care, people can train how they want and I don't think clicking high alchemy repeatedly is all that interactive either.
---
nice save!
---
If u get 3a it will be more than 1.7m/h tho... /s
---
That's kind of my point though...
---
It has just bred a feedback loop of laziness on Jagex's part and those who are unwilling risk and leave their accounts to the mercy of thidparty developers are left behind.
---
It's not a 'solution' because no one should feel compelled or be encouraged to use something thirdparty just because the actual company can't get their heads out of their own ass. 
---
Same. Slightly higher stats. I've been doing quests. Just made it to about 110 quest points just following the "optimal quest guide" on the wiki. It's nice because its leveling some members skills past those early levels. More importantly (in my eyes) its allowing me to kind of learn where things are in the huge addition to the map. That was definitely a daunting aspect upon becoming a member. 
---
I can say, although I'm sure it wont be a popular opinion, that I think they put too much behind the pay wall. I think I'd be enjoying membership even more if I knew more of the map and ways to level skills from playing f2p. I just dont think that initial shock of "oh my God, theres so much to do" would happen if you were eased into it a little more. But hey that's just me.

You should read up on some stats yourself. FM was like top 5 rarest before todt. now its basically tied with fletching.

Could we just scrap 'Dominic's Coffer' and just allow him to take directly from our bank?
---
And while we're at NMZ - can we change it so 'Take Potion' to be the first option on the barrels?
---
The Catherby teleport would be better. I will plan on using it when I have the magic level for spellbook swap. 
---
For myself personally I rarely use lunars so the time to switch spellbooks each farm run would have to be factored in until I got the level for spellbook swap.
---
I am just waiting for the bottomless compost bucket to settle in price. I will be buying it soon. Great suggestion for any farm run!

Also I am doing watermelons for cheap experience anyways. I find the time to turn them into compost to be well worth GP I get back.

Umm it’s hard saying an exact figure. But 1000 beads are about 2-2,5$, depending if you buy in bulk or not. This is about... 2-3000? Took me about 2 hours for the design since its heavily edited, downscaled and pixelated manually (there are softwares for this). And then another 2 hours to drop the beads, + 30min for ironing. It might seem a bit nerdy at first, but I highly recommend it.

PM me if you’ve got any more questions. I’ll be happy to answer what ever you might wonder!

I guess my point is at the end of the day, there's no reason to not have HD graphics, because every excuse Jagex have used so far is invalid, and a third party have already done 99% of the work for them.

Alright, let's suppose each premier vault gave you 200 downs every month (which is a ridiculous huge amount to get). If you were level 80 agility, you'd still need to do premier vault for 33 months to get to 90 or half that, 16.5 months if you use them on a dxp.
---
And that's assuming you get 200 downs every month. It's still incredible unfeasible. 
---
And you didn't die? Did you have to skip a bunch of things?
---
I read his post and I don't think he means one hit the player, that's just an unfortunate result of Venenatis' tuning. What I got from it was that he wants more bosses that have attacks on different tick cycles, such that the attacks will eventually overlap, similar to how you can be targeted by Olm specials while dealing with its regular attacks too, or how you have to fight a Jad while still managing the Zuk fight.
---
Difference between casually llaying and putting in 1k+ hours for 200 whips

Mining cause one u get 85 u can go to deep wildy and mine those runite rocks. Save the ores and go for 99 smithing and start making rune plate bodies, those sell for bonk
---
What's difficult to do is tick manipulation via mobile. If there was a way to correct this it'd be cool. 
---
Why would I buy an arma cbow for +5 more accuracy on slayer monsters? 
---
Idk even things like 3 tick mining seem more tolerable to me because at least you can go afk if you need to.
---
Practice on the test realm for now, it's no cost geat
---
I'd vote yes, they seem like good butlers
---
depends on how many members, think it's like 1/3k for solo, its scaled based on party size tho.

Yes, probably skipped anywhere from 25-30 tasks using turael.

Whip on controlled is fine. If you start at 70/70/70 and micromanage what you level first perfectly, with a bludgeon for str, you'll only get to 99 in all melee stats around 4% faster than if you just used a whip on controlled.

Herblore is/was the toughest skill on an IM because of how hard it is to get the herbs/seeds. But now that you get enough irit seeds to maintain 3-4 farm runs minimum a day.
---
Basically the limit used to be on the amount of seeds Ironmen could get. Now it's on the patches.
---
It should go back to seed struggles IMO.
---
Alch myself

This is how it is though ;( dirty boys everywhere 
---
Do you mean blue robe top? Also I get that it's fine, I'm not going to die, it would just be nice to wear yellow or purple and actually get a small bonus. Most people wear ghostly because the stats are slightly better anyway, but for those who don't have prayer or DT done, it would be cool to get a bit of variety. 
---
FUCK SHIT BITCH
---
I think if you afk splash for too long at some point you stop autoretaliating. I kill peoples spiders and rats they arent autoretaliating all the time. It makes them insta log out.

Hydra - tbow/BP, DHL almost tied with BP but melee makes mechanics trickier (but more fun!)
---
Vork - lance is good but hard to use properly. DHCB still beats it out with bolt specs but not by much.
---
Brutal black Dragons - don't use it. Combination of magic and melee attacks make it impossible to avoid damage, resulting in slower trips with less kills per trip.
---
Anyone else never have members because their parents were too paranoid to use it on the internet?
---
I stole it once and tried but it didnt work and somehow they still found out :( finally got my friends mom to get it for me eventually
---
This would definitely allow people to wear some fashionscape items without sacrificing efficiency.
---
If I’m on OSRS, I’m baked. Simple as that.
---
Yes they should just let scouting be available on the regular client if they don't plan on making all the other rooms worth doing. Other than that no one really cares if ice demon or thieving gives decent pts because the pts/time there is still quite low. Just decrease the completion time of ice demon and thieving to 2-3mins is fine but I've heard for soloers in particular it takes sometimes 2mins just to kill ice demon after the braziers light and thieving room can do one of the of the following or both(noone cares about how much pts u get from it) : 
---
1) attempting to picklock any chest that is not poison or bat chat will guarantee a grub no matter what
---
2) Decrease # of grubs required by 50% turning this room from 4-&gt;2mins hopefully
---
Yeah it's so easy you just have to 1 tick flick without fail for a few hours then somehow kill the healers while they continuously hit you for high numbers but ok

[citation needed]
---
game was already declining pretty heavily after 2007, so
---
They've mentioned potentially adding a notice board in the farming guild to show plant status. I think it was on one of the Q&amp;A streams.
---
really at that point in the game if you havent gotten one, just pay someone to get it for you. No infernal cape is really bottle necking your account progress by level 65.
---
Bruh you wanna share some of those Mark's with me? Lol
---
Every time brotha 
---
I was thinking last night that the games good enough. No need for anymore changes or updates. The majority of players arent maxed. And rhe majority of maxed players dont have 200m all stats. So still plenty to do. 
---
In the past 6 hour afk was a thing, but that has not relevant point to this discussion. You pay decently high gp per xp and get a maximum of 46k an hour at fire wave levels. 46k an hour means you are not only burning through 350k gp/hr you're stilling looking at 300 hours to 99. Or about 260 hours if you take away the 1.4m you need to cast fire wave in the first place.
---
260 hours at 350k gp/hr comes out to you not doing anything for 5 full work weeks in-game and a total loss of 91 million gold.
---
That is not an acceptable trade off to you? You can only afk it for 15 minutes and it costs you a month of time + 100m gp.
---
The elitism of others is astounding.  Barraging could be considered ez scape if you start doing mental gymnastics too much but because you're talking about the meta people don't consider that ezscape.
---
nah trade me and ill fix you right up
---

---
&gt;When you start writing a sentence before you've thought it through but when you realise it's poorly constructed you can't be bothered fixing it and you just send it
---
this one single sentence. Yikes the irony.
---
ehp is 145 k/h for rc if you have millions of gp to delete. Anyways I'll admit i mostly thinking of agility in this example. And if you want to count total xp/hr slayer + combat xp probably would still beat the 145k/h for rc
---
Botting plays the game for you. You’re still actually playing yourself if you’re splashing. Afking a lot of things get the same outcome of botting. Are we supposed to always stare at the screen?
---
The best idea I saw for this was the Swole Giant Rate that appears after you have been splashing for a while and he comes and mercs you.
---
Some people are good at games, i know rare in the RS community but yea. 
---
Sorrey i’m nub
---
The test realms are up right now if you want a free shot at trying jad mechanics! It’s disheartening to waste an hour+ on your first attempts to only be 1 shot by jad or panic once his healers show up. Doing some practice before the real thing will help you 100%!
---
[Jesus the angers really burnt out the few brain cells you had left](https://youtu.be/7-Sm4cCpmEc?t=16)

Especially when it requires what, 90+ Fishing to be any good? Brutal blacks and Wyverns are both over double that and have arguably easier requirements.
---
 Do wear glasses. It's not because i can't see, it's just a better reading experience haha. Valid point though. That's why I had the blur enough so that if you're doing slayer or something, you could TELL if there was something behind the chatbox. 
---
Usually I see something behind the chatbox and move my camera before actually interacting with it. Just personal preference i suppose.
---
Nah he's got all the stats needed to complete it, a tbow and prayer is all you need if the user is experienced.
---
i bought about 6k fire , 10k air and 250 law runes a long time ago and i'm still going strong on the fire and air, but i'm low on law. Do what i did, but buy more law and you'll be set for a while.

ITT people don't understand how links work
---
Frankly, if you don't understand hyperlinks, you shouldn't be allowed on the internet. It is the most powerful tool that our species has ever created - reading the instructions should be mandatory.
---
Fair enough, there are a lot of brainlets out there. Trust me when I say I have exhausted all options and I am completely at the mercy of Jagex right now. I'm very concerned I'll use a bond and be stuck in F2P limbo for the duration of it since they refuse to help me.
---
It's funny that their competitor Blizzard would've responded within the hour and probably gifted me a free day of playtime for the inconvenience. Jagex needs to take a long hard look at their customer support in 2019. It's archaic, clunky, and usually completely useless.
---
Lol so this is why people look whack as fuck PKing sometimes
---
To me, PVM is the only fun thing, not training skills. I can do raids for 10 hours straight and have an awesome time, but to get there requires a fuck ton of skills that I don’t enjoy.
---
Well well well...  
---
hope you enjoy that black mask while it lasts, it appears you didnt black out your name, hp level, or ring of dueling charges. your account is basically already hacked.=
---
because not everyone cares about ehp
---
i have way more fun when im just playing the game casually without worrying about muh absolute max efficiency reeee. Sometimes I just want to fuck something up with a dragon scim so i do that
---
Hey am friend. Could you give me a little bit of money?  Just want a small amount for a T-Bow is all
---
Literally no reason for that. Can you give me one that makes sense? 
---
Only ever done a few raids like a few months ago, got like 5kc. Friend has never attempted any high level pvm
---
Total XP might not be the best requirement (same goes for total level) because it may alienate certain players (maybe pkers or people who quest). 
---
Being able to make 10m an hour with improve your quality of life. Would adding a 10m gp/h method of moneymaking be quality of life? Fuck no.

The ability to “open” the herb bag and seed box in the same way as the looting bag so that you can pick up herbs and seeds from the ground and they go straight into your herb bag/seed box.

that's exactly why they say it, to bother you, people lie on the internet to get reactions.

Really doesn't matter if he never posts his username

That might have been what happened and I might have just started playing Members.

Enh. It doesnt have his username or any other Information. Gratz op!

I see there are alot of different opinions, this topic interest me so i decided to make a video about it,  I will upload it next week. Make sure to check it out!

"ironman cc" or "ironmancc" are ones I know of. I think "ironman cc" is 2000+ skill only though, and I've read they're both pretty toxic.

Hopefully this saves me ❤️

Why do we need a solution, its a mechanic not a problem.  Fix prayer flicking first.

imagine typing that all out while claiming you don't care what people do with theirs, see the irony :-)
---
Reality is nothing will happen unless this gets to top page on reddit or b0aty retweets u on twitter. Such a shame social media is the only way to get things like this sorted.
---
You mean after it grows? to train woodcutting you have to climb up the rope ladder
---
Tbh, this picture brings up old memories. I had a similar setup, with a router on the table. Thanks for this post!

Why do people do this? Is it just to raise magic level?

Humer
---
yeah mind numbing stuff, needed 74 for a hard diary req not sure which one, just trying to meet all hard diary and quest cape reqs without any boosts and plan on just knocking all of that stuff out in hopefully a couple days :)
---
Kraken because I have the pet and Spectre because I have access to much better tasks and don't want to waste prayer pots on getting herbs
---
Yeah but he has an account on reddit. Social engineers will go to much greater lengths to find that information, and the username is the easiest to come by.
---
Oof yeah was walking home and mistyped 2 instead of 3. I forget to proof read sometimes...thanks for pointing it out.
---
By hawk OSRS?
---
you don't have to look for the worst in everything, but you can encourage others to not be obsessed with collecting karma on reddit by lying to each other. how about encourage them to contribute good, new content? they would feel happier and they would explore their creative side.
---
You’re logic is on a whole nother level of autism 
---
Lmao wow
---
Yknow I forgot about that. Still rather use Duradel or Konar, personally. Konar for hydra, Duradel because Duradel.
---
10/10 math bud
---
Username DOESN’T check out then. 
---
I don't think I've ever given out my username but out of interest how come?
---
yikes
---
yes and thats when he goes 1 step in safe, skips, repeat with an account boxing. 
---
Can't believe I forgot about that, yes, I would definitely like to see this.
---
imagine trying to use autism as an insult because you aren't smart enough to express yourself in any other way
---
We know hes using controlled attack style, a counts as good as gone.
---
Can we get eternal rings of wealth and skills necklaces the same way to get the eternal glory? Recharging in the wildy?
---
What do you mean by " took me to wintertodt to anti scam"?
---
For sure.
---
i agree, this is a better explanation. i was responding specifically to your point that leveling the skill doesn't really aid you in any way.
---
Correct account creation date is a significant piece of the recovery process.
---
Not like people can't monitor his post history to see if he posts it in the future.
---
Just tried did not work for me. 
---
Nope, just RNG luck.
---
I am talking about earning some gp, but in any case Nieve is better xp than Konar
---
Well dang then, I agree lol. I'd say good work? But it's more like scary. 
---
I’ve taken 3 classes of comp sci and I’m pretty sure I could fix this game entirely! Jagex really are just a bunch of wankers!
---
I'd say they don't do ANY polls correctly
---
It sucks that the only way cheating like this will be sorted is if it either gets to the front page of reddit or b0aty retweets you on twitter.
---
You gotta zoom in and out super fast and spin around to sicko mode
---
Yeah and you spent a lot of money on that cbow so why not use it lol
---
Woodcutting contracts in the woodcutting guild, but the trees have to be cut in a given location (lore explanation, different type of wood grain or composition). It would give use to some of the trees out in the world despite how far they are from banks. Maybe give an xp reward and a little reward for completing them.
---
In general I'd be a fan of more guild contracts. They really diversified my farming training.
---
Could we PLEASE get some love for the music track selector :D?
---
There are SO many great music tracks, yet no way to store or even search up your favourite tracks.
---
This often leads to listening to the same track forever until you turn off sounds, cause finding a new song every 2-4 minutes when you have to scroll through the ~600 songs in alphabetocal order is just too hectic.
---
A search function, or, preferrably, a favourite-tracks list would be really nice, it’s sad that so many great music tracks go by without being listened to because the music player simply isn’t user-friendly.
---
Ok I know this is a shitpost but this is the best idea I've seen on this sub in awhile I'm all for this
---
You're a sick man.
---
Yeah, typical Jagex stupidity. Fix the problem then make it literally just as bad again 2 months later because Ironman players bitched.
---
“Please, my optional game mode revolving around limiting myself is too limiting!”
---
Ok but you’re not exactly proving a point. You can do the task both quicker and more afk than how you were doing it. Just doesn’t make sense to do it with a dhcb in any situation unless you enjoy having your task take longer lmao 
---
Do seed packs roll on the pet or no? 
---
terrain lacks depth
---
A couple years ago it used to be riddled with 99 range bots 24/7. Have no reason to go there so I have no clue what the current situation is like. 
---
Lets say then youve been subbed since jan 2004 and pay £36 a year.
---
Thats £540. So people who argue current rates are bad pay £5.99 a month and would have to play for like 7 and a half years to start missing out on the difference.
---
On topic damn thats a long time
---
78
---
Steels are really fast and you get so few of them. Irons are Def blocked tho.
---
Using a trident on steels makes it take 15 min for the task or less
---
Your creation date is the #1 deciding factor in whether or not a hacker can successfully recover your account. So if they ever get a few more details in addition to the username they can recover and bypass authentication.
---
Can this be a miniquest where we divorce Princess Astrid and the gnome moves in with us?
---
Can we just rework the herb sack to give it an interface like the seed box? It'd be easier to use in so many ways. 
---
[Https://www.youtube.com/thisisgoogle](https://www.google.com)  you can change the text for the link to whatever you want. Hover over it to see where it's going

Wouldn't they also need a login email/name?
---
Massive yikes
---
I get good drops from the snek. Vorkath missed out on giving out
---
Remove the word "staff" from that sentence, and I can relate.
---
And many people respond to these posts by asking the person if they need someone to talk to or a friend to play RuneScape. So it seems like they are doing exactly that. Also, why are you coming to the ridiculous assumption that people lie for karma because they’re depressed? 
---
You don’t need to imagine shit when I’m doing it in front of you riri 
---
I mean, it's a dumb and vulgar name, but there have been far worse out there.
---
You're doing exactly that right now lmao. If they're so horrible for doing it I don't understand why you're spending your time literally doing everything you claim is horrible, the defending it in a million comments on this thread. You look like an idiot. If this bothers you so much do what everyone else does and downvote then move on with your life instead of obsessing about it on a stupid subreddit for a 10+ year old game..
---
And the early 2000s Dell Dimension.
---
What you've literally just said is no body should even mention anything about their lives even if it's related to RuneScape. Not only is that boring and also not at all in the sub rules, but it's also insensitive. Like I said before, you're right some might be lies for karma. Who gives a shit. Some of them might be genuine and there's nothing wrong with showing support for every post like this so the ones that actually are real get it. You act like it hurts you to see sympathy posts, but it really doesn't affect you in any way. You just wan to feel like you're more clever than these 2007 brainlets. You made this post trying to prank the sub with your mighty intellect and show them how gullible they are. In reality it's not about being gullible. The people here just could give less shits if you are "tricking" them for karma. They are just showing their support in case you're being genuine. All this post actually shows is your ego, your cynicism, and your insensitivity. Also maybe an obsession with internet points. Like who cares if some guy sympathy tricked the sub for some upvotes.
---
You can use chins instead
---
+600 upvotes. I think you might be the only one.
---
If there a dog and a cat in this, it would be cat vs dog vs lesser demon vs mark gerhard.
---
As an avid BH pker this pains me to see..
---
I don't mind seeing an iron man boosting with his friend so he can get a rune pouch; I see that almost every day. The line has to be drawn somewhere though, and this is obviously far beyond what is acceptable. Using \~10 of his own accounts to boost himself multiple Tier-10's is a clear exploit of the BH mechanics. He is no different than the level 20 emblem farmers that get banned for this and should be punished as such. Disgusting.
---
Dope art.
---
This exists. Use a spade on the patch.
---
Ha
---
This is one of the dumbest comments I've ever seen
---
Some people *are* just better at some  games than others. 
---
Happens with totem pieces as well. I think it happens if you dont pick up one of them right away. 
---
you are quite cute :) what undergrad degree do u need ur stats class for?
---
Use your cat to chase the rats they're splashing
---
I got 99 slay over a year just afking with whip or msb/bp and doing every hellhound task at cerb. I probably only did slayer like 30% of the time that I played. 
---
QOL Update: Add warding skill
---
Or make the spiders stealable after like 5min of splashing
---
99 RC. Such unrealistic expectations.
---
Finding smart ways to avoid playing the game is what playing the (or any) game is all about, for me.
---
Splashing isn't one of those ways though.
---
Is that a microwave with OSRS?
---
Reminder 
---
I think hes on holiday for Archie's birthday

You mean you don’t play on your microwave ?

But you're all standing there doing nothing so there's xp waste happening.

theres a way to make 18m an hr selling stuf?????
---
What kind of car/truck
---
My Tacoma has BFG K02s
---
Also i first thought my mobile reddit glitched when i saw the forum you posted too lol 
---
I changed what I wanted to say, sorry lol
---
Ah sounds like it needs delt with but the way you explained it initially isn't really accurate. 
---
You guys know there are bots running rampant throughout the game with literally 0 playtime. Run script for tutorial island and run your mining script to 99. Stop complaining about people missing spells on rats, get your priorities in order.
---
Na I think I'll take it down tbh lol. 
---
Dude don't you see what ur doing? This is just yoir way for attention.
---
Why bother doing it again and again since everybody already know theres fake drama on the internet just to get upvotes.
---
one time is for proof, if u repeat its just for ur own attention secretly.
---
Can we add lasagna to the game?
---
Whilst I think the premise of not showing results before you voted it correct, people aren’t retarded they don’t just look at a poll and vote for the winning one. Most people either have an opinion on something and vote accordingly, or don’t have an opinion on it so vote with the majority as hell if I see an update for something I’ve never done and it’s sitting at 88% I’ll assume it’s probably a good update. 
---
This was the idea behind Artisan, but it was scrapped and sent to the grave along with Sailing. The farming guild took some inspiration with farming contracts, and from what I’ve seen people want to expand the idea to other skills, but I doubt it would be a skill on its own.
---
Fixed it 
---
If you find good tires hit up my man Hajedy he's been in the market for some new wheels for a while
---
Yeah, that's kinda the joke. 
---
Its also banable. Abusing the minigame with alts is whats breaking the rules.
---
If abusing a minigame to goldfarm would be the issue they would have to ban BA clans
---
My irl hcim almost died after this betrayal 
---
Always incredible that people still don't understand the concept of afking
---
The issue here is not the boxing mechanics lol, the issue is him logging on 10 of his accounts to farm gold for his iron man
---
Girth is important too
---
Could OR various requirements like total xp, BH kills, and quest points.
---
Can’t m8, they’re still working on the ditch
---
They're very rare. I get at least half of my hespori seeds from checking grown crops. 
---
If you are willing to do boring things for hours you can get barrows tires
---
Achievement
---
I think part of the problem is how stingy Jagex is regarding names. Never clearing out banned names and only having name wipes once every few years, and when they do wipe them their criteria is not lenient enough.
---
So naturally you get a lot of people with shitty names like this. Pretty lame.
---
Rocking the XP
---
&gt; teleing away

&gt;10 second cast

Also just a heads up I found your username on a twitch chatlog dump for the channel 'alfie'. I won't post the link here since the someone without proper antivirus could potentially get a virus from the dump site. But i'll link it in pms if you want it.
---
Just about everyone I know had that blue router.  Good work my dude!
---
Sure
---
I'm not thinking of shades... I'd have said shades if that were the case; abby spectres, or in this case deviant spectres, have an attack range of 5, rune crossbow on rapid has a range of 6. I can show you the safespot if you like.
---
Part of the issue, I think, is that there isn't as much crossover between Pvmers and Pvpers as there ought to be
---
Wow... you're a sad person. An upvote is free and takes less than a second, you're not some mastermind for revealing that people are willing to upvote a sad story. You're honestly pathetic dude, and you need to do some introspective thinking about how you spend your time. I honestly pity you. 
---
Well, feel free to make your own game that works the way you imagine. 
---
I can show you the spot. A rune crossbow works just fine, I wouldn't have said that you can safespot them there if you couldn't, lol.
---
Why are the edges red anyway? 
---
Nothing wrong with splashing 
---
Make it require 50 smithing too
---
Devalues my anti dragon shield only ironman
---
Ah I see. Never that. Thanks for explanation!
---
That's called integrity change
---
The suspense is killing me but I cant load youtube on my phone
---
He said cat not kitten.
---
Water is wet
---
Yes I see that. The way op originally explained it couldn't have happened. That's why I asked questions. I understand now. No reason for downvote simply becuase I didn't understand what op was saying
---
I honestly don't see how 1 mistake makes you lose points. I've literally missed over 10 clicks once and still didn't lose anything. 
---
No. It’s the original rotation. 
---
Holy fuck the air pods 😂
---
Doesn't RuneScape have a maximum of 4 layers so what if they added a roof  to poh 
---
Him boxing isn't the primary focus of this thread though, it just adds insult to injury as it allows him to get away with his gold farming with little to no repercussions
---
This is a really pathetic cry for attention. I hope you're okay IRL man, because okay people don't usually do this sort of thing.
---
Maybe something that grows on walls? Maybe call it ivy or something...
---
Used to work at a CT plant, they are great tires. As long as you don't plan on leaving them on your vehicle and letting it sit without moving them for 4+ months, you won't have any issues. Their off-road and season tires are much better than their everyday tire, but they are very high quality. 
---
Gold is so easy to obtain on Ironmen idk why anyone would waste time doing this. Slayer and PVM shit alchables for great cash
---
How the fuck are you gonna fly outta ur house exactly?
---
All this is missing is some lo-fi music👌
---
I asked myself this question too. But in Shaperka’s latest Jagex HQ vlog, he’s sitting somewhere in that footage, so he’s alive and working for jagex.
---
People have lost all touch with what wholesome means because of that stupid subreddit 
---
You can still skip your tasks. If you go speak to Turael (The low level slayer master in Burthorpe) he can cancel your task and give you a new one. It does reset your task streak but if you've just started that shouldn't be a problem
---
In that case I recommend trying to click the alter for better rc xp
---
I was feeling bad for skipping them yesterday, but i got Suquahs after (extended) and was excited. Am I on the right track? 
---
Well yeah they go through the portal and take ~6 seconds to load in and then a few to realize they're not where I was supposed to port em, and then to scroll back in chat to pm me. And while that is all happening I'm teleing back to wherever I was when they messaged me to buy a port in the first place.
---
As I responded to your last post, I understand that now. 
---
Just revert the model entirely.
---
and yet you choose to post a comment trying to make me feel guilty and sad, i hope the irony isn't lost on you, how many seconds did it take you to type that?
---
Literally any ironman streamer’s cc
---
Yeah you get the joke
---
Maybe make a diary plugin for runelite where users can post achievements and goals in a blog format, then in a seperate tab it can list all the different quests achieved. Online profiles would be made when the user first logs on to RS using runelite. The game fetches the player's name and checks whether or not their profile exists.
---
Meh, idk, probably a terrible idea. Problem with all this is there's always going to be a security risk.
---
MORE OF THESE PLEASE LMAO

&gt; You can still complete this task with a DHCB or Lance in 2 hours or less id wager
---
You can kill 90 brutal blue dragons an hour? That's 1 every 40 seconds. That's 6.13 dps on average. That's absurd.
---
What about your boots?
---
What? What is your definition of very close. Because if 1/4th of the time to 99 was 1-72, with the exp rate caping at 75, than you think that 75-99 which is over 11.5m exp, is 3/4th of 13.5m at exp cap.
---
Wrong.
---
Thats why I added that condition, yes
---
so why did you post that comment, if using your logic, it's for your own attention secretly?
---
Fair enough. It's a shame, I thought he was a really good host for the stream.
---
Tournament world
---
I always liked playing orbs of guthix. I think that would make a great addition
---
This isn't a joke?
---
Allow us to dumo all items into super compist bins immediately like weeds.  No, noone is going lose their stack of 5 ranarrs by accident mod ash.
---
Idk man, I've met some interesting people and had some great conversations during layovers. It's nice to pick your head up sometimes and just take in the surroundings. There's much more to life than an extra 30 pixel herbs.
---
Blurring in real-time with the cpu is very resource intensive. Runelite could add this feature, but definitely the official client won’t get this even if they wanted it. 
---
Why dont you suck his gamer dick a lil more
---
I can add the 14 days to an account that's already subbed?
---
I play guitar aswell man 
---
Lol. The price got lowered because only bots were fishing sharks. It was dead content. Minnows made it not dead content so people are fishing them now.
---
&gt;What you've literally just said is no body should even mention anything about their lives even if it's related to RuneScape. 
---
yes that's right, having no friends or family isn't anything to do with runescape
---
I was thinking it
---
Really cheap and slow magic xp.
---
Bursting is way better and faster xp with just a bit more effort (afk if you use alts) yet nobody complains about that.
---
I am currently 81 ranged and doing this slayer quest since yesterday. Only 48 more brutal blue dragons to go. Jagex dindu nothing wrong. Y A H O O
---
Just started running there and indeed annoyed the hell out of me! 
---
Heck yea
---
Real question is what sub were you even aiming for lmao
---
Just spent 4 hours killing 129 of these....
---
Sucked.
---
\&gt; If this bothers you so much do what everyone else does and downvote then  move on with your life instead of obsessing about it on a stupid  subreddit for a 10+ year old game..   
---
weird, because the thread yesterday was on the #1 spot of the subreddit  
---
ask yourself why you didn't move on from this thread without posting those comments within  a stupid  subreddit for a 10+ year old game..   
---
because you write in such a convuluted way its hard to follow lmao  
---
\&gt;using the word yikes
---
No. You just did not protect.
---
Lol OP, your life is sad. Imagine spending your time grasping at attention from internet strangers by baiting sympathy with made up stories about dead people. You're either alone and unloved irl or a complete narcissist, possibly both. I hope you make a change soon OP cause you're on the path of becoming a real waste of a human being. Shame.
---
grats! go insure it asap
---
Huh, interesting. Although the actual profit will likely be a lot lower for bots, as you're locked out of worlds for a while if you're switching too fast. Dunno if you calculated for that?
---
and i cannot stress this enough haw
---
move the poll booth away from the bank in the fucking farming guild too. I click on it more than I click on the bank.
---
But then no one will be able to sit on that chair /s
---
I'd be happy with just one 99 level skill lol. I'm sure Mark is proud of you, buddy. 
---
Tbh I fucking hate Slayer.
---
If you try this, your character asks why you would want to remove perfectly healthy plants.
---
so you say i need your attention?
---
..clown, im saying this so all the reddit browsers don't have to deal with these misinformed, lieing crap posts. Just to have 1 person (you) makes them feel good about themself with the attention he needed.
---
deep thoughts is everything my bro, i've got you red handed.
---
It absolutely is, but not for comments in a thread a long way down about a discussion. Vote manipulation exists to boost posts because upvoted posts will be featured on the front page of subs where they will be seen a lot more than in the new section and thus gain a lot more upvotes after the initial vote manipulation.
---
Why the fuck would you name your account after a drug that lowers cholesterol levels?
---
because it's true :-)
---
PSA that you can make your cat eat the mice, even when its being splashed
---
So you basically do the exact same thing as runecrafting now but you cash in your xp later for bonus xp? Lmao, sick suggestion. This is basically equivalent to: Get up to 15% xp bonus in runecrafting in exchange for the runes. No reason to add this but for lazy kids like you who need ezscape to get their levels up. What's your RC level at, 45?
---
Wasn't very interesting, I can tell you that.
---
The real question is who the fuck cares?
---
imagine editing your old post because you sat there trying to think of something different to post in the message, don't spend too much time thinking about it 
---
Sucks to suck
---
Yeah same. Just sucks that the major part of the community doesn’t aggree on this.
---
Can we change the fishing spot graphic throughout the game to be the same as the new one used for Aerial Fishing.
---
It's so much easier to see than the sparkles/bubbles used elsewhere and would make fishing on mobile feel so much nicer.
---
You list fwend?
---
Thank you! Yup, already done!
---
I've had people approach me in a similar fashion. Usually they will keep you added for a few days. They will  have you "anti lure" somebody (their friend) where you log on with nothing under the "lurer" and pickup some item  that's worth a few mil. The guy who initially added you will try to get you to do the same thing again later but this time they want you to have your items out or something to that effect. Obviously don't go for it. But you can make a decent amount from their initial bait on you and just delete them afterwards. 
---
The game normally prevents you from having two of the same tier clues in your inv/bank. Totems aren’t prevented, just dropped in order. Op probably got a hard and elite clue and thought they’re both hard
---
Isnt it some other dimension or something hence the portal? I forgot how housing works
---
It seems like Jagex doesn't even care about this, as I think they would have just disabled it for them if they did.
---
Shit, my merchanting level will be 22,829 then!
---
Well important question is, are you reducing your HP down to 1?  That prevents all of the bosses from hitting more than 1 dmg at a time on your absorb.  Typically people use a rock cake.   If you don't do that, then you wouldn't last very long.  I personally can last several hours with only torso and d platelegs.
---
I also wouldn't suggest using breakable gear for NMZ unless it's dharok set.
---
Imbued graceful outfits that give a percent of run energy back with successful runecrafting.
---
 This was an idea I was holding back for a warding suggestion, but I can't use my busted laptop rn so I might try that later. Not many other suggestions come to mind for skilling. 
---
 Reminder about slashing webs from inventory suggestion and feeding fish chunjs to cats/kittens suggestion as well ig.
---
This is a stupid question I’m sure but you are defo going down to 1 hp by using a dwarven rockcake?
---
Do you know how insanely slow 13k xp/hr is? Doing that would actually take 1000 hours of splashing to get 99. 
---
It is related to the community of runescape. What a title like that tells you usually is the person does not have a group they belong to in real life, but they do feel like they are a part of the runescape community. It's in its own way showing an appreciation of the sub for existing because this is one of the few places they feel they belong. It's a justification for why they are sharing a simple achievement like their first maxed skill here instead of to a friend. That's perfectly relevant to the sub and RuneScape.  Of course the focus isn't the 99 skill, but on the personal story. But that's fine, the sub is a community. A post that is about showing that community seems appropriate to me.
---
If it is simply boring to you or you think it's bad content, tbh there's plenty of stuff on this sub I don't even click cause it's boring or bad content to me. Like if this didn't have the personal story. I skip almost every post that's like "got my first 99". I'm glad for them but I'm not really interested so I scroll past. You don't see me making a post like "99 runecrafting" and then spamming the comments with "lmao you guys are so gullible, this is a fake screenshot. stop upvoting this shit"
---
How about no
---
\&gt; one time is for proof, if u repeat its just for ur own attention secretly.  
---
use your own logic to deduce what is happening right now, that's your second reply to me.
---
i tried, the camera still moves with you and ruins it.
---
support
---
Because you said so? Epic :) 
---
Nah, unless you meant they were splashing on rats not spiders.
---
Did you download the sprites or something? 
---
Wise Old Man never robbed Seer's Village because he cbf to climb that stupid ass ladder.
---
Im all about that girth, the ladies call me The Tuna Can
---
Could we have a fossil storage unit at either the beginning or the end of the Sulliuscep mushroom path?  There is one at the wyvern cave on fossil island, which means this wouldn't be out of place by adding another fossil storage unit at a place where you can obtain fossils.
---
I know it’s not a lot but I just hit chest 37 with 0 drops yet. Feelsbadman. Nice loot
---
Pretty sure they patched this a few years back, now the doors reset every couple of minutes instead of when ever someone enters... 
---
nice projection, i hope you find love and a cure for your narcissism   
---
your first thought was to approach that post with negativity and your last thought was feeling ashamed, now take a step back and think about if you're ashamed of what you just wrote or not :-)
---
Runecrafting
---
It's not relevant to Konar, but it is relevant to the balancing of boss drop tables. It's why bandos is an amazing boss, despite its mediocre other drops. Everything else has to be a balance between alchables and resources.
---
I don't think their goal is to totally remove skilling resources from pvm, it just has to be balanced. Zulrah wasn't balanced, as it was providing too much of everything and outshined the genuine skilling methods. Essentially nobody is going to mitigate their need for sharks by doing Konar, and those that do will probably end up with more exp and sharks by just doing nieve/duradel and then fishing minnows. That's why Konar is a modest, balanced bit of content for mid tier players. The *only* benefit to Konar is those sorts of drops, too. With Zulrah it was basically incidental that you got swamped with sharks. 
---
Strength
---
That's the whole point of the game lmao. Holy shit ya'll crack me up.
---
He said in the post you can bypass the hop limit using VPNs, so you wouldn’t get locked out. Whether or not that’s true, I’m not sure
---
\&gt; I hope you're okay IRL man   
---
well that's not true, otherwise you wouldn't start a comment by being so passive aggressive, sorry friend
---
Yea except theres alot less poop covered crack heads In rev caves.
---
But what are ur other levels.
---
Nobody is arguing against that, the point is that someone is using a well known persons account that they hacked to take money from them
---
When i posted this, i got half the upvotes. Time to hang myself in draynor. 
---
That's cool my dude nice 👍
---
Boots. 
---
Doesn't work with spiders unfortunately. 
---
I really consider it pity head at that point
---
Zezima.
---
Totally agree. 
---
Their one mistake was assuming that I'd follow some random's youtube channel lol. 
---
Hosidius is getting its update pretty soon and I hope the other houses will follow. It'd be so much nicer if some existing areas were downscaled and the left over landmass filled up in a better way. 
---
You know the person who made this doesn't actually play cause nobody talks like that in game. 
---
It's just, 
---
"wc lvl?"
---
red is the sharpest color
---
Also missing the guy slicing all his fish open, and the guy furiously 3 tick herb grinding 
---
If your not a guy, then I’m buying, I offer 1k GP. 
---
People will vote no because people’s xp will slightly increase by a few xp an hour from messing up.
---
Why when’s? I usually get 1m in loot alone from those tasks
---
I mean i wouldnt mind seeing the spot, as a lower level who had to skip them before hah. Ive safespotted the regular ones at the slayer tower before
---
I'm really bad at them /:
---
Thivong buff the drops lololol youre nuts
---
I don't see why you felt the need to necro this from 2 months ago when there hasn't been any further disputation.  I also don't see how your post is relevant.  All I stated is that I didn't care for Adam making a decision on his own to remove the plug-in.
---
I'm all for avoiding game-breaking mistakes, but how boring and disappointing it would be to be stuck playing a 2007 backup.
---
Actually he is rank 1 for slayer in ironman hiscores!
---
Isn't using an autoclicker basically just the same as botting?  Just go play rs3 if you want afkscape.
---
Ok I surprised myself here elder maul is better dps than rapier at bandos EVEN WITH 1 DWH SPEC https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OZb_rg0d5xwF0lWCp7Fc530XfsHe-CSmSnk1UkRZcbg/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
They said they were gonna address it at the beginning of the year but haven't even said anything yet
---
Plenty of skilling methods make money. It’s by no means ruined
---
Yeah I do the same thing, I only plant expensive trees like magics and palms for diaries (And sell the rest), I use ultracompost for herbs and things that give over 10k farm xp, supercompost for everything else.
---
Please make one of Woox's room with the infernal cape and stuff! 
---
I love this!
---
Different kind of variety, even if just cosmetic, can bring a lot of joy at any levels!
---
Every single unique item on the medium clue scroll table has the same weight. This is literally the same thing as having 3 red boaters and 1 adamant platebody(g)..
---
ohh wow ok ty for this lol
---
Disgusting arrogance thinking that your way of thinking is correct.
---
Maybe it is, but maybe it isn't.
---
Have you tried using humility? 
---
You can also use your cat to kill the rat, even in combat.
---
OMG 2m absolutely cleaned
---
When I was younger I used to play stoned because I had a bunch of time and a job that didn’t random.  Now I don’t have much time and have to be able to pee clean.  Definitely took it for granted back then and am pretty jealous of you all that can.
---
That explains why whenever I accidentally cut myself it always leaves some red liquid.
---
Then I hit them with  “Uhhh” and run off 
---
I actually am unsure about that 
---
it's not going to be interesting almost the same as everything else
---
I bet you are really fun at parties...
---
It does, it is significantly harder for 3 people. I would say if you're trying to do TOB casually you don't want to go below 4.
---
That being said, hardcore players can go down to even duo's, so it's all about the gear and intensity you want to play at.
---
Blood from invisible leprechaun. Poor thing 
---
If you're not an iron, don't do them period unless u want pet, and in that case wait til better gear.  If your an iron id still wait til better gear.  Blowpipe at least. 
---
RuIns my nostalgic emersion REEEEEEE
---
I quested/lamped to like 45, then did lavas/cosmics/ZMI to 77. You obviously know nothing about the game so you shouldn't put your input in. Come back when you're over 1500 total.
---
After bankrupting yourself training con you're pretty much forced to use it to justify it.
---
Oh that's me! 
---
Gonna try my luck again, hopefully I hit the drop table again
---
tell us the name you got promise i wont hunt you down
---
If your goal is to ruin pvp, you are on the right track!
---
If that was true then I didn't even see it. That's the nice thing about Reddit, nobody has a gun to your head and makes you click on posts. If you see one you can downvote it and move on. 
---
I commented here because I thought it was hilarious to see you basically saying "how pathetic are people who do this thing that I'm doing right now lol." It's dumb. If you hate it so much just don't click on it.
---
What is the origin of "Oh my Quentin/ Squintin"? I hear streamers say that but I don't get the reference.
---
Can you trade my lumbridge only ironman one?
---
Holy shit you just reminded me how hard I went on heraldic shields
---
You mean if other spell books would have fighting chance against ancients and regular spell book?
---
I bet you are too mr. 39 Runecrafting. Nice 1183 total level btw. Please don't put your input on content you've never even played.
---
Gravestone sounds like it could have a lot of potential for abuse. Like purposefully dying in GWD after you're out of supplies, then re-stocking and teleing straight back for more kills. Or suiciding at runecrafting altars. Probably lots more potential problems there. I don't think it could work, even though it's a cool idea.
---
Also it depends if you re-plant in same trip as harvesting, 20 is easy without re-planting them, but requires really good timing if you do.
---
I was about to say that lmao 
---
powerrrrrrrrrrrr
---
Well over 2k total but thanks for assuming bud ;)
---
add cats to f2p pls
---
the whole point of construction exists as a money sink.
---
I think all the replies are wrong tbh. I think splashing is balanced, it's shit xp but extremely afk. I just think it's ugly. Imagine being a new player and having to wonder why there's hordes of people decked out in armor casting spells on really weak enemies but failing every time.
---
I can't tell if this is the normal one or with more added
---
You have to have it blessed though, which requires 31 prayer.

Can 2 half pies be combined together to make a whole pie? Currently this is not possible, and you can't even sell the halves.
---
Rip mat
---
Thank you very much
---
old one looks so much better, new one looks garbage. ive been hating on this for more than 13 years
---
I would almost guarantee I’m older than you. Age has no bearing on what humor I find amusing. Check that attitude mate and lighten up a little.
---
People will still be right next to you like a urinal meme.
---
I appreciate the feedback
---
Half the comments on this post hating on splashers are currently splashing in the lumbridge basement as they type. 
---
I’m the same way, I’ve done about 70 runs and  have only gotten 2 pieces. Guthan’s Warspear and Torag’s Hammers. 
---
Suqah my balls.
---
Why not just use airs at that point lmao
---
no i don't have a job, why would i feel insecure enough to lie about something on the internet? 
---
Sounds like dailies
---
Well, it's not far from that atm... Is it? I mean, you can just go to wilderness crab yourself  5 ecumenical keys and die 4 times inside bandos room and you have lot of supplies. This spell won't allow you to teleport inside boss rooms or instances, but outside of boss rooms.
---
do you even know how annoying raggers are if you like pking and you get bullied day in day out by people who play the game 12 hours a day just to make sure you cant pk lol...
---
Soooo... this is what you do for fun? 
---
maybe take note of the fact that me saying my language skills are bad have nothing to do with the original comment and it was just a distraction, which worked.
---
Babooony or Lilbaboony
---
U can choose which one 
---
that's twice you've replied to me, are you sure you're not wasting your precious time with irrelevant threads on the internet.. maybe you have too much time on your hands? self reflection is a wonderful thing
---
not on my old school reeeee
---
Armadyl cb definitely going to make some money, just not a mad profit.
---
Because they didnt really nerf it. It only made botters have to re-enter which was no problem.
---
now show me where i claimed my statements are correct. you're just assuming that i think i am correct beause you're unable to accept the fact that i think differently to you.  
---
now look up the word "irony"
---
Yeah it’s bad. I was also assigned that very first tasked, skipped it and haven’t been back to Konar since 🙄. I’m still only level 60 Slayer so maybe I’ll go back to her when I get better stats. 
---
I’m lying in bed talking to you my love whilst waiting to drift off as I have university tomorrow. Wubu2? X
---
Nice try but you didn't pixelate the login enough, my account now
---
this is actually the original, holy shit
---
I though he added extras, but no
---
\&gt;whilst waiting to drift off   
---
must be hard to stop thinking about it, right?
---
My only concern with this is that currently the Mining Guild is *heavily* botted. 
---
Adding an ore pack would mean there would be even *more* incentive for bots to flock there. 
---
It's already super annoying since bots will camp the iron ore and you can't outcompete them since they're programmed to literally never give up.
---
Protip: cream your pants
---
Smh my head.  If you're on this sub and you splash do yourself a favor and do teletabs to 55
---
Konar is better for money not the best for xp
---
Yea, pretty sure it's the part where you raid a HAM base with the 2 big ass goblins
---
Train defense
---
it's good you felt the need to inform me that you reported the thread otherwise i would have never known, thank fuck you did that
---
Why would they put an actual QoL change into their PvP balance polls?
---
Wearing a charged glory at Gem Rocks makes them faster to mine. Maybe some item (even Varrock Armour or Lumbridge/Draynor Ring) could make them mine faster too?
---
